ABSTRACT

Motivation: Changes in gene expression levels play a central
role in tumors. Additional information about the distribution of
gene expression levels and distances between adjacent genes
on chromosomes should be integrated into the analysis of tumor
expression profiles.

Results: We use a Hidden Markov Model with distance-scaled
transition matrices (DSHMM) to incorporate chromosomal distances
of adjacent genes on chromosomes into the identification of
differentially expressed genes in breast cancer. We train the DSHMM
by integrating prior knowledge about potential distributions of
expression levels of differentially expressed and unchanged genes
in tumor. We find that especially the combination of these data
and to a lesser extent the modeling of distances between adjacent
genes contribute to a substantial improvement of the identification
of differentially expressed genes in comparison to other existing
methods. This performance benefit is also supported by the
identification of genes well known to be associated with breast
cancer. That suggests applications of DSHMMs for screening of other
tumor expression profiles.

Availability: The DSHMM is available as part of the open-source
Java library Jstacs (www.jstacs.de/index.php/DSHMM).

1 INTRODUCTION

Chromosomal mutations like ampliﬁcations and deletions of DNA
segments are one of the key genetic mechanisms leading to changes
of gene expression levels in tumors. Different studies have shown
that between 40% and 60% of genes in highly ampliﬁed regions tend
to be overexpressed (Heidenblad et al., 2005; Hyman et al., 2002;
Pollack et al., 2002). Also epigenetic changes of DNA methylation
or histone modiﬁcations are known to locally bias expression levels
on chromosomes (Frigola et al., 2006; Stransky et al., 2006).
Due to such mutations, gene expression levels of adjacent genes
on chromosomes tend to be positively correlated. Moreover, gene

Adjacent Gene Distance in kb

Fig. 1. Distance—based spatial correlations of log—ratios measured for directly
adjacent genes on chromosomes in the breast cancer gene expression dataset
by (Pollack er al., 2002). Adjacent genes on each chromosome were grouped
into distance classes between 100 and 1500 kb in steps of 100 kb. The
Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient has been computed for the log—ratios of
all pairs of adjacent genes in one distance class for the tumor data (red) and
for 100 random permutations of log—ratios per chromosome of the tumor data
(black).

expression levels of adjacent genes in close chromosomal proximity
tend to be higher correlated than those of adjacent genes in greater
distance. This is illustrated in Figure l for breast cancer gene
expression data from (Pollack et al., 2002).

In recent years, different approaches have been proposed for the
analysis of gene expression data in the context of chromosomal
locations of genes. The Human Transcriptome Map (Caron et al.,
2001) was the ﬁrst large—scale approach to study genome—wide
human gene expression proﬁles. This mapping of gene expression
data to chromosomal locations revealed a complex organization
of the human genome in which highly expressed genes tend
to be localized in clusters. Besides this, methods like CGMA
(Crawley and Furge, 2002), or MACAT (Toedling et al., 2004),
and LAP (Callegaro et al., 2006), both modeling chromosomal
distances of genes, have been developed to improve the analysis of
gene expression proﬁles in the context of chromosomal locations.
A common characteristic of all these methods is the requirement of
replicates of two deﬁned separate samples (e. g. tumor and healthy
tissue) for the identiﬁcation of differentially expressed chromosomal
regions based on speciﬁc test statistics coupled with permutation
tests. These methods cannot be applied to studies designed to analyze
individual tumor expression proﬁles using two—color microarrays
without replicates (e. g. Pollack et al., 2002). In this situation, often

standard log—fold—change thresholds are applied to individual tumor
expression proﬁles for characterizing differentially expressed genes
(e. g. Hasegawa et al., 2002; Pollack et al., 2002).

A similar problem, closely related to the analysis of individual
tumor expression proﬁles, is the analysis of data measured by
comparative genomic hybridization experiments (e. g. Beroukhim
et al., 2010; Pinkel and Albertson, 2005). In the last years, different
methods have been developed for the analysis of these data in
the context of chromosomal locations of probes for identifying
chromosomal regions with decreased or increased copy numbers in
tumor compared with healthy tissue. Two studies by Lai et al. (2005)
and Willenbrock and Fridlyand (2005) have put great efforts on
the comparison of these methods, and the best—performing methods
have been made available by the ADaCGH web server (Diaz—Uriarte
and Rueda, 2007) enabling their application with standardized
input and output. Especially, ChARM (Myers et al., 2004) has
been demonstrated to work on tumor expression proﬁles. Thus,
all these different methods could be useful for the identiﬁcation
of differentially expressed genes in tumor.

In order to incorporate spatial correlations between gene
expression levels of adjacent genes in tumor, we develop a Hidden
Markov Model (HMM) for the analysis of tumor expression proﬁles
in the context of chromosomal locations of genes. Motivated by
the trend that adjacent genes in close chromosomal proximity
tend to have more similar expression levels than adjacent genes
in greater distance (Fig. l), we further extend this model to an
HMM with sealed transition matrices (SHMM). Adapting the use
of HMMs with switched transition matrices (Knab et al., 2003), the
idea of scaling transition matrices by state duration was initially
proposed by Seifert (2006) for improved modeling of spatial
correlations. The resulting SHMM was further extended in Seifert
et al. (2009) to distinguish between gene pair orientations in the
analysis of promoter—array ChIP—chip data. Here, the SHMM is
modiﬁed to integrate chromosomal distances of adjacent genes
on chromosomes into the identiﬁcation of differentially expressed
genes in tumor. This is done by distinguishing between adjacent
genes in close chromosomal proximity and adjacent genes in
greater distance. To overcome the potential limitations of this
ﬁxed separation, the SHMM is further extended to an HMM
with distance—scaled transition matrices (DSHMM) that directly
integrates individual distances of adjacent genes into the state—
transition process.

Moreover, we make use of prior knowledge about the distribution
of measurements of underexpressed, unchanged and overexpressed
genes during the training of the three proposed HMM—based
approaches. This is realized by extending the standard Baum—Welch
algorithm (e.g. Durbin et al., 1998; Rabiner, 1989) to a Bayesian
Baum—Welch algorithm.

We apply the HMM, the SHMM and the DSHMM to a breast
cancer gene expression dataset by Pollack et al. (2002). Based on
this, we investigate the effect of incorporating prior knowledge into
the training on the identiﬁcation of overexpressed genes in breast
cancer. We further analyze the impact of modeling dependencies and
distances between adjacent genes on chromosomes by comparing
the HMM approaches against a mixture model (e.g. Bilmes,
1998) ignoring dependencies and distances. Additionally, we
compare our models against existing related approaches for the
analysis of comparative genomic hybridization data including
two other HMM—based approaches by Fridlyand et al. (2004)

and Marioni et al. (2006). The ﬁrst of these two approaches
integrates chromosomal locations and the second additionally
models chromosomal distances. But, both approaches do not
incorporate prior knowledge into the training. Moreover, we also
determine hot spots of underexpression and overexpression in the
breast cancer dataset and evaluate these genes based on the Breast
Cancer Database (Telikicherla et al., 2008), additional literature
searches and database searches using Oncomine (Rhodes et al.,
2007).

2 METHODS

First, the breast cancer gene expression dataset is introduced. Then, the
HMM for analyzing tumor expression proﬁles in the context of chromosomal
locations of genes is developed. Next, this model is further extended to the
SHMM that integrates chromosomal distances of adjacent genes into the
analysis of tumor expression proﬁles by making use of two ﬁxed scaled
transition matrices. This model is further extended to the DSHMM utilizing
distance—scaled transition matrices. Then, the integration of prior knowledge
into the training of model parameters is considered. Finally, details of the
initialization and other basic settings are given.

2.1 Breast cancer gene expression dataset

The breast cancer gene expression dataset by Pollack et al. (2002) is used to
identify genes that are differentially expressed in breast cancer in comparison
to a reference sample consisting of a mixture of normal tissues. This dataset
contains gene expression levels for 4 breast cancer cell lines and 37 tumors
across 6095 genes of the 23 human chromosomes leading to k e {1, ...,943}
tumor expression proﬁles. That is, for each chromosome in each cell line
and in each tumor, a chromosome—speciﬁc tumor expression proﬁle 5(k) =
(01 (k), ...,0Tk (k)) was measured. This proﬁle contains the relative expression
level of each gene t e {1, . . ., T k} given by the logz—ratio 0, (k) of its expression
level in tumor divided by its corresponding expression level in the reference
sample. All log—ratios in a tumor expression proﬁle are ordered from the
p—arm to the q—arm of the chromosome based on the chromosomal locations
of the corresponding genes. Summary statistics of the dataset are shown in
Figure 2.

2.2 Standard HMM

A three—state HMM with state—speciﬁc Gaussian emission densities is used
to identify differentially expressed genes in tumor expression proﬁles. The
set of hidden states of the HMM is denoted by S :2 {—, =, +}. Motivated by
the quantile—quantile plot of the log—ratios in Figure 2b, the three states are
deﬁned to model the following gene categories. State ‘2’ models unchanged
genes with log—ratios of about zero, underexpressed genes in tumor with log—
ratios much less than zero are represented by state ‘—’ and overexpressed
genes in tumor with log—ratios much greater than zero are modeled by state
‘+’. The state of gene t is denoted by qt 6 S. A state sequence 312011, ...,qu)
underlying the tumor expression proﬁle 5(k) is assumed to be generated by a
homogeneous ﬁrst—order Markov model. This model is parameterized by the
initial state distribution 7?:=(71,-),-€S with initial state probability 71,-6(0,1)
so that 2,65 :1,- =1 and by the stochastic transition matrix A 2: (ail-)1; jeg with
state—transition probability aije(0, l) and Zjesaijzl for each jeS. The
state sequence Z] belonging to the tumor expression proﬁle 5(k) is hidden.
To model the log—ratio 0t(k) of gene t by the HMM, it is assumed that
or (k) is generated by a state—speciﬁc Gaussian emission density 19,-(0t (k)) :=
1 /(me,)exp(—0.5(o,(k) — “if/0,2) of state q, = i e S. The corresponding
emission parameters are represented by the matrix B 2: (Mi, (ml-GS deﬁning
the state—speciﬁc mean ul- 6 IR and the state—speciﬁc standard deviation 0,- e
R+ for each state ie S.

In summary, the parameters of the speciﬁed HMM are denoted by
A :2 (7?,A,B). The three—state architecture of this model is illustrated in

Supplementary Figure S1. The HMM realizes dependencies between log—
ratios 0t(k) and 0t+1(k) of adjacent genes t and t+1 on a chromosome via
its internal ﬁrst—order Markov model.

For the identiﬁcation of differentially expressed genes, the HMM is used
to compute the probability with which a gene t in tumor expression proﬁle
5(k) is assigned to a state ieS of the HMM. This is done by computing
the state—posterior probability ytk (i) :=P[qt :i |5(k),k] using the Forward—
Backward algorithm (Rabiner, 1989). That enables the ranking of individual
classes of genes (e. g. overexpressed genes) as well as the assignment of the
most likely underlying state of each gene using the state—posterior decoding
algorithm (Rabiner, 1989).

2.3 HMM with scaled transition matrices

The extension of the standard HMM to an HMM with scaled transition
matrices (SHMM) enables the integration of chromosomal distances of
adjacent genes into the analysis of tumor expression proﬁles. This allows
to model the trend shown in Figure 1 that two adjacent genes in close
chromosomal proximity tend to have more similar expression levels in
tumor than two adjacent genes in greater distance. Inspired by HMM—based
approaches for ﬁnancial time—series (Knab et al., 2003), tumor expression
(Seifert, 2006) and ChIP—chip data analysis (Seifert et 01., 2009), the
integration of this trend is realized by extending the homogeneous ﬁrst—
order Markov model, responsible for the state transitions of the HMM,
to a speciﬁc inhomogeneous ﬁrst—order Markov model that integrates the
chromosomal distance of adjacent genes in a tumor expression proﬁle into
the state—transition process of the SHMM.

To include these distance information, each pair of adjacent genes t and
t+ 1 measured in a tumor expression proﬁle 5(k) of a chromosome is assigned
to a transition class

2, genes t and t+1 in distance d, 5 b
1, otherwise

C[(k):={

in dependency of the chromosomal distance d, of both genes and a globally
predeﬁned distance threshold 19. This transition class is used to select one of
the two transition matrices A1 2: (6117(1)),‘JGS and A2 2: (ail-(2))1-J-GS realizing
the state—transition process of the inhomogeneous ﬁrst—order Markov model
of the SHMM. A1 is assumed to be identical to a basic transition matrix
A 2: (owl-Jag as speciﬁed for the HMM, and A2 is computed based on A by
increasing the state duration 1/(1—al-i) of each state i ES by a predeﬁned
scaling factor f2 > 1. Based on this, the parameters of transition matrix AC of

transition class c 6 {1,2} are expressed by

air-1+fc

re 4:].
Ac:=(aij(c)):= at” . _ (1)
f—C’ .175]

with respect to the parameters of the basic transition matrix A and a scaling
factor fc Z 1, fulﬁlling A1 :A for f1 2: 1.

Thus, the SHMM transitions from state qt 6 S of gene t to state qt+1 e S of
gene t+1 in a tumor expression proﬁle 5(k) using the transition probability
aqtqt+1 (ct(k)) of the corresponding transition matrix ACIUC). This realizes that
adjacent genes in close chromosomal proximity modeled by A2 have a higher
probability to be represented by the same state of the SHMM than gene pairs
in greater distance modeled by A1, because the self—transition probability
ail-(2) of each state ie S in A2 is greater than ail-(1) in A1. Similarly, the
general usage of different transition classes was ﬁrst proposed by Knab et al.
(2003) for the analysis of ﬁnancial time—series data. In contrast to that, the
SHMM has a reduced number of transition parameters by making use of
scaled transition matrices enabling the separation of adjacent genes into two
ﬁxed distance—speciﬁc transition classes.

In spite of the extension of the state—transition process, the initial state
distribution and the state—speciﬁc Gaussian emission densities deﬁned for the
HMM can still be used without modiﬁcations for the SHMM illustrated in
Supplementary Figure S2. The variable parameters of the SHMM are denoted
by A 2: (7?,A,B). This model reduces to the standard HMM by setting f2 : 1.
The identiﬁcation of differentially expressed genes is done in analogy to the
HMM under consideration of the speciﬁc transition classes assigned to pairs
of adjacent genes.

2.4 HMM with distance-scaled transition matrices

A conceptual extension of the SHMM is achieved by replacing the ﬁxed
transition matrices by a continuous transition function of gene distance.
This leads to an HMM with distance—scaled transition matrices (DSHMM)
directly integrating the distance of adjacent genes into the state—transition
process. Such a model avoids potential discretization effects caused by non—
continuous changes of transition probabilities for small variations in gene
distances.

For realizing this, the transition class C, (k) of each pair of adjacent genes t
and t+ 1 in a chromosome—speciﬁc tumor expression proﬁle 5(k) is redeﬁned

to represent a standardized gene distance

dt/b, genes t and t+1 in distance d, 5 b
1, otherwise

C[(k) :={

in dependency of the chromosomal gene distance d, and a globally predeﬁned
distance threshold 19. This standardized gene distance deﬁnes a linear ramp
function of gene distance taking values in the interval [0,1]. The ramp
characteristic allows to limit the relationship between distance of adjacent
genes and similarity of their gene expression levels to biologically relevant
chromosomal distances. Based on that, a distance—speciﬁc scaling factor is
deﬁned by

fc,(k)2=1+(F—1)-(1—Ct(k))

with respect to the standardized gene distance c, (k) and a globally predeﬁned
maximal scaling factor F 3 1. This distance—speciﬁc scaling factor is used to
rescale the state duration 1/(1—al-i) of each state i ES in a basic transition
matrixA 2: (ail-)1; jeg utilizing the transition matrix AC deﬁned in Equation (1).

That is, for each transition from gene t to gene t+ 1, the corresponding
distance—scaled transition matrix Amk) is used. This transition matrix deﬁnes
a continuous function of gene distance for which adjacent genes in close
chromosomal proximity have a higher probability to be represented by the
same state of the DSHMM than adjacent genes in greater distance. The
distance—scaled transition matrix AMI.) reduces to the basic transition matrix
A for adjacent genes in distance greater than 19. A continuous reduction to
the basic transition matrix is realized by the distance—speciﬁc scaling factor
fcxk»

In comparison to the SHMM with two ﬁxed transition matrices, the
DSHMM with distance—scaled transition matrices improves the modeling
of adjacent genes in close chromosomal proximity having more similar
expression levels than adjacent genes in greater distance (e. g. Fig. 1). Similar
concepts were proposed by Marioni et al. (2006) and Rueda and Diaz—
Uriarte (2007) to integrate chromosomal distances of adjacent probes into
the HMM—based analysis of Array—CGH data.

As for the SHMM, the same initial state distribution 77: and state—
speciﬁc Gaussian emission densities with parameters B are used for
the DSHMM. The variable parameters of the DSHMM are denoted by
A 2: (7?,A,B). Differentially expressed genes in tumor are identiﬁed in
analogy to the standard HMM under consideration of the distance—scaled
transition matrices. The DSHMM reduces to the standard HMM that ignores
chromosomal distance of genes by using a maximal scaling factor F 2: 1.

2.5 Modeling of prior knowledge

A problem—speciﬁc characterization of the model parameters of HMM,
SHMM and DSHMM is achieved by including prior knowledge about tumor
expression data into the training. This is done by deﬁning a prior distribution

P[M9]I=D1(7?|@1)-D2(A|®2)-D3(B|@3) (2)

over the parameters of the model A2:(?T,A,B) with respect to
hyperparameters ® 2:(®1,®2, @3). This prior represents a product of
independent prior distributions for the initial state distribution 7?, the
transition matrix A and the emission parameters B of A. For each class
of model parameters, a conjugate prior distribution is used enabling the
analytical parameter estimation and the integration of prior knowledge
about potential parameter values during the training. The following prior
distributions used for the initial state distribution, the transition matrix and
the Gaussian emission densities represent the usual ones used for HMMs
(e. g. Bishop, 2006; Durbin et al., 1998). A transformed Dirichlet distribution
is used as prior for the initial state distribution (MacKay, 1998). The prior
for the transition matrix is a product of transformed Dirichlet distributions.
A product of Gaussian—Inverted—Gamma distributions is used as prior for
the state—speciﬁc Gaussian emission densities (Evans et 01., 2000). Details
to these distributions are given in the Appendix A of the Supplementary
Material.

Generally, the choice of hyperparameters for the prior should enable the
model to distinguish between underexpressed, unchanged and overexpressed

genes in tumor. Appropriate choices are problem—speciﬁc and depend on
the size of the dataset. A histogram of log—ratios (e.g. Fig. 2a) helps to
characterize each state of the model. Details to used hyperparameters are
reported in the Appendix A of the Supplementary Material.

2.6 Training using prior knowledge

The training of an HMM, a SHMM or a DSHMM is typically performed with
the Baum—Welch algorithm (Durbin et al., 1998; Rabiner, 1989) belonging
to the class of Expectation—Maximization (EM) algorithms (Dempster et al.,
1977). Starting from initial model parameters, the Baum—Welch algorithm
locally maximizes the likelihood by a two—step procedure. This procedure
adapts the parameters of the model iteratively to the tumor expression proﬁles
without integrating prior knowledge.

To overcome this limitation, a speciﬁc extension of the Baum—Welch
algorithm to a Bayesian Baum—Welch algorithm has been developed. The
Bayesian Baum—Welch algorithm integrates prior knowledge speciﬁed by the
prior distribution of the model. This is realized by iteratively determining
new model parameters

A(h+1):argmax (Q(A|A(h))+log(P[A|®]))
A

maximizing the posterior density of the model A with respect to the current
parameters of the model A(h) (h : 1 initial model). The estimation of the new
parameters is done based on Baum’s auxiliary function Q(A|A(h)) deﬁned
in analogy to Rabiner (1989) in combination with the logarithm of the prior
distribution P[A | @] speciﬁed in (2). This combination enables the iterative
estimation of new model parameters with respect to prior knowledge about
the data.

Details of the parameter estimation for the HMM are given in the
Appendix B of the Supplementary Material. Due to the usage of different
transition classes by the SHMM for distinguishing between adjacent genes
in close chromosomal proximity and that in greater distance, the estimation
of the transition parameters must be modiﬁed. Details to this are given
in the Appendix C of the Supplementary Material. The estimation of the
transition parameters for the DSHMM is outlined in the Appendix D of the
Supplementary Material. This parameter estimation is done in analogy to that
of the SHMM, but the computations are slightly more complex and require
more memory because of the usage of distance—scaled transition matrices.

The process of estimating new parameters A(h + 1) is iterated until the log—
posterior density increases less than a predeﬁned threshold in comparison to
the value obtained for the previous parameters A(h). The training is stopped if
the increase of the log—posterior density is less than 10‘3 for two successive
iteration steps. This iterative scheme reaches at least a local optimum in
dependency of the initial parameters A(1) (Dempster et al., 1977).

2.7 Initialization and basic settings

The initial HMM, SHMM and DSHMM must be able to differentiate between
differentially expressed genes and genes with unchanged expression levels
in tumor. A histogram of log—ratios (e.g. Fig. 2a) helps to ﬁnd appropriate
initial parameters.

Proportions of underexpressed and overexpressed genes in tumor are
much less than that of genes with unchanged expression levels. Thus, the
initial state distribution was set to 77: : (0.1, 0.8, 0.1) using 71. : 71+ : 0.1 and
71: : 0.8.

The initial transition matrix A : (ail-)1; jeg was chosen to have a stationary
distribution identical to a? by setting all diagonal elements to ail-:1—s/Jrl-
and all non—diagonal elements to Cll‘j :s/ (271,-) using s:0.05 to control the
state durations.

State—speciﬁc Gaussian emission densities were characterized by proper
means and standard deviations for representing the measured log—ratios.
This was done using the means p._:—2, u::0, and u+:2 and the
corresponding standard deviations o- : 0.3, o: :0.5 and 0+ :0.3.

HMM-based analysis of tumor expression profiles

 

Additionally, the ﬁxed global distance threshold 19 and the ﬁxed scaling
factor f2 have to be speciﬁed for the SHMM. Both parameters are problem—
speciﬁc depending on the dataset. The relation between the distances of
adjacent genes on a chromosome and the correlations of their log—ratios
(Fig. 1) helps to ﬁnd appropriate settings. For the breast cancer gene
expression data, the log—ratios of adjacent genes in distance greater than
1000 kb showed generally only weak positive correlations comparable to
that obtained under permuted data. For that reason, the maximal distance
threshold was set to 1000 kb. The scaling factor f2 allows to adjust the
probability that two directly adjacent genes are represented by the same
state of the SHMM. Too high values of f2 could lead to undesired predictions
like pairs of overexpressed genes in which one gene has a log—ratio slightly
less than zero. Under consideration of this, each global distance threshold
17 e {10, 20, ..., 1000} kb was assessed in combination with each scaling factor
f2 6 {1.1, 1.2, ...,2.0} for the breast cancer gene expression data.

In analogy to the SHMM, each global distance threshold be
{10, 20, ..., 1000} kb was tested in combination with each maximal scaling
factor Fe {1.1, 1.2, ...,2.0} for the DSHMM.

Each initial model was trained with all tumor expression proﬁles of
the breast cancer dataset using the developed Bayesian Baum—Welch
algorithm.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

First, the coupling between gene expression levels and gene
copy numbers is considered to provide the basics for comparing
different methods. Next, the inﬂuence of prior knowledge on the
training and the identiﬁcation of differentially expressed genes by
HMM, SHMM and DSHMM is investigated. Then, the effect of
modeling dependencies and distances between adjacent genes on
chromosomes is analyzed. Next, the best—performing method is
compared with existing methods. Finally, hotspot—genes of under—
and overexpression in breast cancer are investigated.

3.1 Coupling of gene expression and gene copy
numbers

Gene expression proﬁles of individual breast tumors are known to be
highly diverse (Perou et al., 2000). Information about differentially
expressed genes in individual tumors are widely lacking. This
complicates the comparison of different methods for their ability
to identify such genes. The coupling between gene expression
levels and directly underlying gene copy numbers is considered to
overcome this, because a large proportion of genes located in highly
ampliﬁed chromosomal regions were identiﬁed as overexpressed in
breast cancer compared with healthy tissue (Hyman et al., 2002;
Pollack et al., 2002).

Motivated by this observation, information about copy numbers
of genes in each of the 4 breast cancer cell lines and each of
the 37 breast tumors are used to determine each gene in the
corresponding tumor expression proﬁle with an increased copy
number in comparison to healthy tissue. This is done using the
comparative genomic hybridization experiment by Pollack et al.
(2002) providing a measurement of the copy number of each
gene in each individual tumor expression proﬁle. Each gene in a
tumor expression proﬁle is labeled as a potential candidate gene
for overexpression if its underlying gene copy number is at least
3—fold increased in comparison to healthy tissue. This leads to 228
candidate genes of overexpression with increased copy numbers in
the breast cancer gene expression dataset. The majority of these
genes has increased expression levels in tumor (Fig. 2c), providing

a good basis for evaluating the accuracy of different methods
to identify these genes. These candidate genes of overexpression
are considered in the following studies. Corresponding results for
candidate genes of overexpression with a at least 2—fold or at
least 4—fold increased copy number in tumor are provided in the
Supplementary Material.

3.2 Inﬂuence of prior knowledge: comparison of
Baum—Welch and Bayesian Baum—Welch training

The standard Baum—Welch algorithm trains the parameters of an
HMM, a SHMM and a DSHMM without including prior knowledge
about the distributions of log—ratios representing underexpressed,
unchanged and overexpressed genes. The proposed Bayesian Baum—
Welch algorithm integrates prior knowledge using the speciﬁed prior
distribution. Exemplarily, the inﬂuence of both training algorithms
on the emission parameters of the HMM is shown in Figure 3. Nearly
identical emission parameters were obtained for the SHMM and
the DSHMM (Supplementary Table 81). The distributions of log—
ratios modeled by the states ‘—’ and ‘—l—’ clearly overlap with each
other for the HMM trained by the Baum—Welch algorithm. A much
better separation of these distributions is obtained for the same model
trained by the Bayesian Baum—Welch algorithm. This leads to a
better modeling of underexpressed and overexpressed genes that
are expected to have log—ratios much different from zero (Fig. 2).
Figure 4a shows that this is also applicable to the identiﬁcation of
candidate genes of overexpression by the HMM. As expected from
the nearly identical emission parameters, this is also observed for the
identiﬁcation of candidate genes of overexpression by the SHMM
and the DSHMM (Supplementary Fig. S3).

Consequently, only models trained by the Bayesian Baum—Welch
algorithm are considered in the following studies.

3.3 Inﬂuence of modeling dependencies and distances
between adjacent genes

Gene expression levels of adjacent genes on chromosomes in the
breast cancer dataset are positively correlated and tend to be more
similar for adjacent genes in close chromosomal proximity in
comparison to adjacent genes in greater distances (Fig. 1).

To investigate the impact of modeling chromosomal locations
and distances of genes, the abilities of HMM, SHMM and DSHMM
to identify candidate genes of overexpression are compared with
a mixture model. A mixture model of three Gaussian densities
(e.g. Bilmes, 1998) for modeling underexpressed, unchanged and
overexpressed genes is a basic model for analyzing tumor expression
proﬁles. This model neither integrates chromosomal locations
nor chromosomal distances of genes into the identiﬁcation of
differentially expressed genes.

To enable the comparison with the HMM—approaches, a mixture
model was trained on the tumor expression proﬁles using the same
basic initial settings and incorporating the same prior knowledge as
for the HMM—approaches. The parameters of the Gaussian densities
of this mixture model (Supplementary Table S2) were very similar
to that obtained for HMM, SHMM and DSHMM trained using
the Bayesian Baum—Welch algorithm (see Fig. 3 for HMM). This
is expected, because these models are speciﬁc extensions of the
mixture model.

The performance of these four models to identify candidate genes
of overexpression was initially compared at a ﬁxed false positive

rate of 3% (Supplementary Fig. S4). The HMM identiﬁes candidate
genes of overexpression clearly better than the mixture model.
This is further improved by the SHMM and the DSHMM that
both achieve nearly identical results with a small tendency that
some DSHMMs can identify candidate genes of overexpression
slightly better than corresponding SHMMs. That indicates that the
DSHMM might be better suited for the analysis of breast cancer
tumor expression proﬁles.

Based on this, one of the best DSHMMs with distance threshold
[9:350 kb and maximal scaling factor F: 1.9 was selected for a
more detailed comparison. The identiﬁcations of candidate genes of
overexpression by the mixture model, the HMM and this DSHMM
are shown in Figure 4b (see Supplementary Fig. 85 for all methods).
The HMM modeling dependencies between adjacent genes on
a chromosome reaches a higher accuracy for identifying these
candidate genes in comparison to the mixture model ignoring
these dependencies. This accuracy is further improved by the
DSHMM that additionally models distances between adjacent genes
on chromosomes.

In summary, the largest proportion of the improved identiﬁcation
of candidate genes of overexpression is obtained by the transition
from the mixture model to the HMM modeling dependencies
between adjacent genes on a chromosome. Additional beneﬁt is
reached due to the modeling of distances between adjacent genes
by the SHMM and the DSHMM. Both characteristics are modeled
best by the DSHMM.

3.4 Comparison of DSHMM to existing methods

The analysis of tumor expression proﬁles in the context of
chromosomal locations of genes is closely related to the analysis of
data coming from comparative genomic hybridization experiments
(e.g. Beroukhim et al., 2010; Pinkel and Albertson, 2005). Such
data are typically analyzed by modeling dependencies between
adjacent probes on a chromosome to identify probes with log—ratios
much greater or much less than zero (Lai et al., 2005). This is
comparable to the identiﬁcation of differentially expressed genes
in tumor. For that reason, the DSHMM with distance threshold
[9:350 kb and maximal scaling factor F: 1.9 is compared to the
best—performing related methods of two comparison studies (Lai
et al., 2005; Willenbrock and Fridlyand, 2005) provided by the

ADaCGH web server (Diaz—Uriarte and Rueda, 2007), ChARM by
(Myers et al., 2004) and the basic log—fold—change analysis (LFC)
used by Pollack et al. (2002). All these methods are summarized
in Supplementary Table S3 and were applied with their standard
settings to the breast cancer tumor expression proﬁles to identify
candidate genes for overexpression. We are aware that these standard
settings could also be ﬁne—tuned by expert knowledge.

The predictions and corresponding scores obtained by all methods
are available as Supplementary Material. The results are shown in
Figure 4c. In comparison to all these different methods, the DSHMM
reaches the highest accuracy for identifying candidate genes of
overexpression.

3.5 Hotspots of under— and overexpression in the breast
cancer dataset

The publicly available Breast Cancer Database (B CD) (Telikicherla
et al., 2008) contains genes identiﬁed to play a role in breast
cancer. In the BCD, 1361 genes overlap with the genes measured
in the breast cancer gene expression dataset by Pollack et al.
(2002). However, the individuality of breast tumors in terms of
duplications, deletions and other mutations (Perou et al., 2000) does
not allow to use all these genes simultaneously as candidate genes
for underexpression or overexpression in each individual tumor
expression sample by Pollack et al. (2002). Yet, genes that are
frequently identiﬁed as being underexpressed or overexpressed in
different tumor expression proﬁles can be compared with the BCD.
This provides additional support that a method is able to identify
tumor—relevant genes, and it also provides the opportunity to further
investigate frequently identiﬁed genes that are not contained in the
BCD. In the previous sections, the DSHMM with distance threshold
[9:350 kb and maximal scaling factor F :1.9 has outperformed
the other HMM—approaches and also related methods for the
identiﬁcation of differentially expressed genes. For that reason, the
following analysis is only done for this model.

To identify genes with frequently altered expression levels
in the breast cancer dataset, the expression status of each
gene (underexpressed, unchanged, overexpressed) in each tumor
expression proﬁle was initially computed under the DSHMM
using the state—posterior decoding algorithm (Rabiner, 1989). For
a stringent selection, each gene that was identiﬁed at least 7

genes of overexpression than the mixture model. This is further improved by the DSHMM that additionally models distances between adjacent genes on a
chromosome. The combination of integrating prior knowledge into the training by the Bayesian Baum—Welch algorithm and the modeling of gene distances
by the DSHMM leads to an additional improvement of the identiﬁcation of candidate genes of overexpression. The largest proportion of this improvement is
obtained by the integration of prior knowledge into the training (compare Fig. 4a). (c) Comparison to Existing Methods: comparison of the DSHMM to existing

This provides further support that the DSHMM is useful for the The three developed HMM—based approaches trained by the
identiﬁcation of differentially expressed genes in breast cancer. Bayesian Baum—Welch algorithm integrating prior knowledge on
expected log—fold changes clearly improved the characterization
of differentially expressed genes in tumor in comparison to
corresponding models trained by the standard Baum—Welch
algorithm ignoring these prior knowledge. This is also applicable
to the identiﬁcation of candidate genes of overexpression in breast
cancer. Models trained by the Bayesian Baum—Welch algorithm
substantially improved this identiﬁcation.

The comparison of the HMM—based approaches to a mixture
model neither modeling chromosomal locations nor distances of
adjacent genes has revealed that the SHMM and the DSHMM that
both make use of these two features achieve the highest accuracy
for identifying candidate genes of overexpression. Both models
performed nearly identical, but the DSHMM might represent the
better suited model because of the direct integration of individual
distances of adjacent genes. This comparison has also revealed that
the integration of prior knowledge into the training is more important
than the additional modeling of chromosomal distances of genes.

Moreover, the DSHMM has shown the best identiﬁcation of
candidate genes of overexpression in comparison to other existing
methods. Additionally, genes frequently identiﬁed by the DSHMM
as being differentially expressed in breast cancer have been

4 CONCLUSIONS

We analyzed breast cancer expression proﬁles by integrating three
sources of prior knowledge into extended HMMs for identifying
differentially expressed genes in tumor.

First, the analysis of tumor expression proﬁles in the context
of chromosomal locations of genes has been motivated by the
observation of strong positive correlations between expression levels
of adjacent genes. This has inspired the application of the HMM
modeling dependencies between adjacent genes on a chromosome.

Second, the trend that expression levels of adjacent genes in
close chromosomal proximity are higher correlated than that of
adjacent genes in greater distance has led to the extension of
the HMM to the SHMM. The SHMM additionally incorporates
chromosomal distances of genes on a chromosome for identifying
differentially expressed genes in tumor. This is done by two
ﬁxed transition matrices enabling the separation of adjacent genes
into genes in close chromosomal proximity and genes in greater
distance. To avoid potential discretization effects caused by this ﬁxed
separation, the SHMM has been further extended to the DSHMM

compared to two public breast cancer databases. In combination
with additional literature searches, this comparison has provided
further support that the DSHMM is useful for the identiﬁcation of
tumor—relevant genes. All these results indicate that the DSHMM
could also be considered for the analysis of other tumor expression
proﬁles.

Abstract

Summary: 3Dmol.js is a modern, object—oriented JavaScript library that uses the latest web tech—
nologies to provide interactive, hardware—accelerated three—dimensional representations of mo—
lecular data without the need to install browser plugins or Java. 3Dmol.js provides a full featured
API for developers as well as a straightforward declarative interface that lets users easily share and

embed molecular data in websites.

Availability and implementation: 3Dmol.js is distributed under the permissive BSD open source
license. Source code and documentation can be found at http://3Dmol.csb.pitt.edu

1 Introduction

Molecular visualization is an essential tool for computational chemists
and biologists. Due to the demanding nature of three—dimensional
(3D) graphics, most molecular viewers are desktop applications. The
need to install specialized applications and, in some cases, the restrict—
ive nature of the software licenses, introduces hurdles to the sharing
of molecular data. Unlike a desktop application, a standards—based cli—
ent—side web application comes pre—installed with every computer and
mobile device with a modern web browser and can be seamlessly inte—
grated into online environments for accessing and analyzing molecular
data.

Currently, Jmol (Hanson, 2010) (http://www.jmol.org) is the
most used web—based molecular viewer. Jmol is implemented as a
Java applet and includes a custom rendering engine for efficiently
rendering common molecular data representations, such as spheres
and sticks. Due to this custom rendering engine and Java’s optimiz-
ing just-in-time compiler, the performance of Jmol can approach
that of native, desktop applications. However, due to heavily publi—
cized security failures, the Java install base is shrinking (Yegulalp,
2013). Even when Java is installed, users are presented with multiple
security prompts that must be correctly navigated before a Java app—
let, such as Jmol, can run. To address these concerns, JSmol
(Hanson et 61]., 2013) was developed. JSmol is the product of apply—
ing a Java to JavaScript translator to Jmol. However, particularly

for large and complex visualizations, the performance of JSmol lags
behind that of Jmol.

An alternative to the software—based rendering of Jmol/JSmol is
to use hardware—accelerated graphics, as is done with desktop appli—
cations. This is enabled by the recently adopted WebGL 1.0 stand—
ard, which is now supported natively by all major desktop and
mobile browsers. PV (http://biasmv.github.io/pv) and GLmol (http://
webglmol.sourceforge.jp) are two examples of WebGL—based mo—
lecular viewers. GLmol was the first WebGL viewer and uses the
Three.js (http://threejs.org) framework for interfacing with WebGL.
However, GLmol lacks a full featured API and the use of the
Three.js library results in performance inefficiencies. We forked
GLmol and radically reworked its architecture to overcome these
deficiencies and create 3Dmol.js. PV, like 3Dmol.js, uses WebGL
directly, but has a focus on displaying protein structures and does
not provide the same set of features as 3Dmol.js.

2 3Dmol.js

3Dmol.js is a pure JavaScript, hardware—accelerated, object—oriented
molecular visualization library that enables web developers and cas—
ual users to visualize and interact with molecular data in any mod—
ern desktop or mobile web browser with near native performance.
The focus of 3Dmol.js is providing a full-featured API for online

Molecular styles include lines, crosses, sticks, spheres and cartoons,
and atoms and surfaces can be colored by user specified properties,
such as partial charge or atom type. An example of programmatic-
ally controlling a 3Dmol.js viewer to create the scene shown in
Figure 1a is provided in Figure lb.

2.2 Embeddable viewer

HTML authors do not need to use JavaScript to embed 3D viewers
within their websites. 3Dmol.js will automatically turn any HTML
element annotated with the viewer_3Dmolj 5 class into a viewer.
The contents of the viewer are set and styled through the use of
HTML data tags, as shown in Figure 1c. The molecular data can
be retrieved from a remote URL or from an element that is
embedded within the web page.

2.3 Hosted viewer

End users may use 3Dmol.js through a hosted viewer as shown
in Figure 1d. In this case, the molecular data is set and styled
through a URL specification. Data may be retrieved from a remote
URL, such as a publicly accessible shared folder on cloud storage.
This allows users to easily share complex scenes without requiring
that the recipients have any software other than a modern web
browser.

3 Performance comparison

The performance of 3Dmol.js is compared to Jmol, JSmol, GLmol
and PV in Figure 1e. The time to create the scene of Figure 1a, which
contains several visual styles applied to 12 375 atoms, and then to
perform a single rotation was measured using JavaScript wall clock
time. The scene was rendered in a 600 pixel square HTML element.
Firefox 31 on a 2.4GHz Core Duo 2008 MacBook with 4GB of
RAM running OS X 10.9.5 was used to time the operations and the
average of the three best times of five trials is reported.

The initial creation time for a scene can be more time consuming
in 3Dmol.js compared to a software—rendering approach like Jmol.
The scene needs to be decomposed into a mesh of triangles since this
is what is expected by the graphics subsystem. However, once a 3D
scene is created, interactions with the scene that do not change its
fundamental geometry, such as rotating, translating and zooming,
are extremely fast (a few milliseconds) since the 3D scene data are
managed by the native graphics subsystem. Consequently, even
complex scenes can be smoothly manipulated by the user.

4 Conclusion

3Dmol.js is an high-performance interactive viewer for 3D molecu—
lar data that requires no plugins to work in modern desktop and mo—
bile web browsers. 3Dmol.js provides a full—featured API to
JavaScript developers, but can also be used by HTML authors and

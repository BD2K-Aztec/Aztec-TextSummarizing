Abstract

Motivation: When analyzing a case group of patients with ultra—rare disorders the ethnicities are
often diverse and the data quality might vary. The population substructure in the case group as
well as the heterogeneous data quality can cause substantial inflation of test statistics and result in
spurious associations in case—control studies if not properly adjusted for. Existing techniques to
correct for confounding effects were especially developed for common variants and are not applic—
able to rare variants.

Results: We analyzed strategies to select suitable controls for cases that are based on similarity
metrics that vary in their weighting schemes. We simulated different disease entities on real exome
data and show that a similarity—based selection scheme can help to reduce false positive associ—
ations and to optimize the performance of the statistical tests. Especially when data quality as well
as ethnicities vary a lot in the case group, a matching approach that puts more weight on rare vari—
ants shows the best performance. We reanalyzed collections of unrelated patients with Kabuki
make—up syndrome, Hyperphosphatasia with Mental Retardation syndrome and Catel—Manzke syn—
drome for which the disease genes were recently described. We show that rare variant association
tests are more sensitive and specific in identifying the disease gene than intersection filters and
should thus be considered as a favorable approach in analyzing even small patient cohorts.

familywise error rate (FWER) which is the probability to report at
least one false association. An inappropriate genetic matching of
cases and controls in the presence of population substructure can
lead to inﬂation, unless properly accounted for in the analysis. Over
the recent years several effective methods have been developed to
control the inflation of test statistics in association studies. These
can be subdivided into approaches that select suitable controls for
cases prior to the statistical test such as genotype—based matching
(Guan et al., 2009) or a stratification score—based matching (Epstein
et al., 2012) and strategies that correct the P—values afterwards due
to differences in the group substructure such as genomic control
(Devlin and Roeder, 1999), principal component analysis (Price
et al., 2006) or other variance component models (Devlin and
Roeder, 1999; Epstein et al., 2012; Guan et al., 2009; Kang et al.,
2010; Price et al., 2006). Most of these methods have been exten—
sively studied in association studies that work with common vari-
ants in complex diseases.

However, as the genetic risk modifiers that were identified in
many GWAS do explain the disease susceptibility only to a limited
degree, it was suggested to extend the search to rare variants to find
the missing heritability (Eichler et al., 2010; Zuk et al., 2014).

The statistical tests that have to be applied for rare variants differ
substantially from those, which are suitable for common variants.
Like in other studies, we will use in hereinafter the abbreviations
CVAS and RVAS to make a clear distinction between common and
rare variant association studies (Bansal et al., 2010; Zuk et al.,
2014). Over the last few years many new statistical approaches have
been developed or adapted to analyze associations for collections of
rare variants. These methods can be divided into two main types,
namely multiple—marker tests and univariate tests that are applied to
genotype data that are combined within a region of interest, e.g. a
gene (Asimit and Zeggini, 2010).

The issue of appropriate methods for multiple testing corrections
has been extensively discussed in CVAS and it took several years to
agree on 5 X 10_8 as an acceptable significance threshold for indef-
initely dense maps of common single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) (Dudbridge and Gusnanto, 2008). For RVAS, a careful ana—
lysis of significance testing has just begun and is an ongoing field of
research (Bush and Moore, 2012; Sham and Purcell, 2014). In the
meantime, computationally intensive permutation tests can be used
to correct the P—values empirically and to compare different test stat—
istics (Sham and Purcell, 2014).

GWAS for common variants in complex diseases usually require
hundreds of samples for sufficient power. For rare variants that are
functionally relevant and thus exhibit higher effect sizes, significant as—
sociations might already be detectable for smaller case groups (Asimit
and Zeggini, 2010; Zuk et al., 2014). However, the limited number of
cases that are available for the analysis of ultra—rare diseases will remain
a challenge and in such studies ranking genes by P—values may serve as a
stopgap solution to identify promising disease loci in the genome.

In this article, we analyze how test statistics perform on exome
datasets of individuals from diverse ethnic backgrounds and varying
data quality. We focused especially on strategies for selecting controls
and studied how this may inﬂuence the disease gene discovery. We
show that an appropriate choice of controls is of utmost interest when
studying individuals with rare disorders, as these collections show usu—
ally a substantial population substructure due to diverse ethnicities.

2 Material and Methods

We worked with exome data of healthy, unrelated individuals that
had been sequenced with the approval of the ethical Board of the

Charité over the recent 5 years in Berlin (referred to as BER cohort)
as well as with publicly available exome data of the 1000 genomes
project (referred to as 1KGP cohort) (Clarke et al., 2012; Genomes
Project Consortium et al., 2010, 2012). All participants or their
caregivers gave their written informed consent for their clinical re-
cords to be used in this study.

As cryptic relatedness is a known confounder in case—control as—
sociation studies (Voight and Pritchard, 2005), we first removed
related individuals. Then we used PLINK (Prucell et al., 2007) to
compute the kinship coefficients of all sample pairs and excluded
individuals that showed cryptic relatedness in an iterative manner as
described in Turner et al. (2011). This procedure yielded 207 unre—
lated individuals in the BER cohort and 2289 unrelated individuals
in the 1KGP cohort (Supplementary Fig. S1).

Similarity metrics: We conducted our rare variant association
studies on case—control groups comprising different numbers of indi-
viduals N. In our simulations we considered scenarios, where the
number of affected individuals in the case group, N a, is equal to the
number of unaffected individuals in the control group, Nu, as
well as scenarios with Na 3 Nu. In general, a distance matrix
d,,,-:d(x,-, x,),~),~=1.__ N can be computed on any pool of samples,
where x,- is a vector of genotype data for individual 1'. Several similar-
ity functions have been suggested in the statistical genetics literature
that put stronger emphasis on different aspects of the underlying
data, such as rare or common variants. In this work, we focus on
three different functions that differ in the weighting scheme W of
genotypes and that we will explain in the following. The distance be—
tween two individuals is computed by considering all genomic pos—
itions k at which other alleles than the one of the reference sequence
have been called:

al.-,- = 1 $21,700 * W)
k

The function I,,-(/e) indicates whether the genotypes at a certain
position [a of the genome agree in individuals 1' and j:

1, if we) == we)
0, if we) 7A we)

The weight Wﬂe) is a function of the genotype frequencies and
c : Slew/(la) a normalizing constant that assures that d,,~€[0, 1], with
d = 0 if and only if x,- equals xi. By changing the weighting function

117(k) = 1(xl-<Ie>,x,-<Ie>) ={

Wﬂe) the distance function will change into different similarity-met-
rics, which we will discuss in the following. If genotype frequencies
are ignored, Wﬂe) : 1 for all k, the mere number of agreeing geno—
types between two samples is quantified. In the literature this metric
is often referred to as identity by state, IBS, that is similar to the
hamming distance. A stronger weight on rare genotypes can be
achieved by using the inverse of the frequency, f, that was deter—
mined in large population genetics studies, W(k)=1/f(x,~(k)). The
metric that results from this weighting function, W1, was shown to
be especially suitable for measuring the quality of variant call sets of
exome data (Heinrich et al., 2013). A similarity metric that uses
stronger weights for shared rare alleles has also been studied by
Guan et al. (2009) and showed best case—control group matched
stratification in association studies that were based on SNP data.
Another weighting scheme and the corresponding metric, W2,
that we used in our current study is based on Shannon’s concept of
information content. Here, the genotype at a specific position [a of
the genome is treated as the outcome of a discrete random variable
and the information content of this position is defined as the entropy
over the probability mass function of the frequencies of all the

genotypes 1 that have been observed for this position, W72 (k) = —Z;
f(/e,l) log f(k,l). For a biallelic position of the genome at which the
genotypes are in Hardy—Weinberg equilibrium, the weight is max-
imal for an allele frequency of 0.5 and thus a common variant con—
tributes in average more to the distance than a rare variant. A
visualization of the similarity between all analyzed samples is shown
in Supplementary Figure S2 for all three weighting schemes.

All three similarity-metrics (IBS, W71 and W2) that we studied
serve two purposes: They may be used to identify the next nearest
neighbors for any sample and can thus be used for matching con—
trols. Second, they may be used to characterize the population sub—
structure in the case— and control—group after the individuals have
been assigned. Many approaches to account for the effect of popula—
tion substructure in CVAS have been described. Since most multi—
variate procedures require invertibility of kinship matrices, these
approaches usually work with matrices that are based on IBS, or ver—
sions thereof which are weighted by allelic frequencies such as W71
and W72 (Nievergelt et al., 2007; Schaid, 2010).

Simulated case-control-groups: All case-control groups of vary-
ing sizes were set up as follows: After choosing randomly N a individ-
uals from a pool of unrelated individuals (e.g. BER or 1KGP) for the
case group, Nu individuals were selected from the remaining pool
for the control group either also randomly or most similar to the in-
dividuals in the case group. We also studied the effect of increasing
sizes of control groups at a fixed case group size, Na 3 Nu, by adding
stepwise additional samples from the remaining pool, either ran-
domly or similarity—matched. Once a sample had been selected as
the next similar individual to a case, it was removed from the pool.

After selecting the samples for the simulated association study
we added pathogenic mutations that had already been reported in
the literature to the exomes of the case group (Supplementary Table
S2). We studied altogether eight different monogenic disorders,
three dominant disorders (Noonan syndrome, Neurofibromatosis
type I and Kabuki make—up syndrome) and five recessive disorders
(Mabry syndrome, which is also known as Hyperphosphatasia with
Mental Retardation syndrome, HPMRS, Cystic Fibrosis, Tay—Sachs
syndrome and hereditary non—syndromic hearing loss, Catel—
Manzke syndrome). Five of the analyzed disorders were caused by
mutations in single genes (NFI, KMTZD, CTFR, HEXA, TGDS)
and the other half was heterogeneous (Supplementary Table S1). For
the recessive disorders we added either a pathogenic allele in a
homozygous state to the exome or two pathogenic alleles in a com—
pound heterozygous state. For disorders with locus heterogeneity we
used data summarizing the prevalence of pathogenic mutations in
the known disease genes from GeneReviews and the diagnostic la—
boratory of the Charité.

Statistical analysis: All the sequence variants of the individuals
were annotated on the functional gene level with Jannovar and fil-
tered for non—synonymous single nucleotide variants, SNVs (Jager
et al., 2014). As all analyzed disorders are ultra—rare, we removed al—
leles with a population frequency above 0.001.

We examined the remaining variants by different statistical ana—
lysis strategies for rare variants (Asimit and Zeggini, 2010; Bansal
et al., 2010). As an example for an univariate marker test we used
the Cochran—Armitage Trend Test, CATT (Asimit and Zeggini,
2010). For CATT we collapsed the genotype frequencies of all rare,
non—synonymous variants within a gene between cases and controls
in a 2 x 3 contingency table. As a multivariate marker test we used
CMC that was suggested by Li and Leal (2008).

We used Receiver Operating Characteristic(ROC)curves for
power and FWER comparisons at different significance levels. For a
comparison of the test statistics we corrected the P—values

empirically by label permutations and based the figures of the results
section on the test statistic that performed best (Sham and Purcell,
2014). As an additional method to evaluate the performance of the
RVAS setup we assessed the probability that a disease gene has the
highest test statistic compared with all other genes.

3 Results

3.1 Defining rare sequence variants

When conducting a RVAS a suitable definition of rareness is
required. However, the rareness of a sequence variant depends cru—
cially on the choice of the reference population. In many NGS stud—
ies the frequency of a variant or a genotype is based on how often it
was observed in individuals that were sequenced in the 1000 gen—
omes project, 1KGP (Genomes Project Consortium et al., 2010,
2012). Currently, high quality genotype data of 2535 individuals of
26 different populations from all over the world is available from
the project site. We studied systematically the effect on the filtering
process when genotype data of certain populations were included or
excluded in the definition of the allele frequencies. Besides the popu—
lations of the 1KGP we also analyzed a cohort of over 200 unre—
lated, healthy individuals that were subjected to exome sequencing
over the recent years at the Charité, University Hospital Berlin, and
that we refer to as BER. First, we filtered for SNVs, that were pre—
dicted to cause missense or nonsense amino acid substitutions on the
protein level in a consensus target region of the exome comprising
28 Mb. All European populations of the 1KGP, as well as the BER
cohort showed a comparable distribution of such variant calls.
Exemplarily in Figure 1 these distributions are depicted for 88 indi—
viduals from Great Britain, GBR, 99 individuals from Finland, FIN,

Fig. 1. Distribution of rare variants in individuals from different populations
and sequencing studies. (A) The number of non-synonymous sequence
variants in the consensus coding DNA sequences is comparable for individ-
uals from different population backgrounds. (B) However, the definition of
the allele frequencies, AF, that are required for computing the subset of rare
variants, has a great influence. The profile of rare variants depends on the
specific subpopulation as well as on the data quality. If individuals from a
subpopulation are filtered for rare variants and the subpopulation is not con-
sidered in computing the allele frequencies the number of rare variants is
considerably higher (FIN and BER in B). (C) A lower mean data quality and
more genotyping errors in the BER cohort result in a substantially larger num-
ber of singletons explaining the higher mean number of variants after

and more than 200 individuals from the Berlin metropolitan area,
BER. Prior to filtering the mean for all three cohorts is around 8000
variant calls (Fig. 1A). The variance for the BER cohort is markedly
larger, mainly due to more heterogeneous data quality and higher
population substructure than for a single subpopulation in the
1KGP, due to diverse immigration background in Berlin.

In a second filter step we applied an allele frequency cutoff of
0.001, which is commonly used in rare variant association studies.
However, depending on the definition of allele frequency there are
considerable differences in the number of variants passing this fil-
ter. If the entire pool of samples that is used to compute the allele
frequencies comprises ~1000 individuals, a cutoff of 0.001 is ba—
sically a filter for singletons. That means a variant that is present
in two individuals will not pass. When an individual is filtered for
rare variants without considering further cases of the same popula—
tion in the computation of the allele frequency, the mean number
of variants after filtering is markedly higher (FIN and BER in Fig.
1B) compared with individuals of GBR where all variants of that
population have already been used to compute the allele frequen—
cies. In Figure 1C the distributions for individuals of all three
populations are shown when all individuals of the 1KGP as well as
of the BER were considered in defining the allele frequencies. In
contrast to Figure 1B the expected mean of rare variants passing
the filter is now considerably lower for an individual from FIN as
all the population—specific variants are now accounted for.
Interestingly the expected number of rare variants in a random in-
dividual from FIN is even smaller than for a random individual
from GBR, as the FIN population is more homogeneous and thus
less rare variants remain in the lower frequency range. This is in
agreement with the findings of the 1000 genomes consortium that
showed a higher proportion of shared alleles and a higher median
length of haplotype identity for FIN in comparison to GBR
(Genomes Project Consortium et al., 2012).

The proportion of variants passing the frequency filter in an indi-
vidual of BER is also markedly lower when considering the rare
variants of that cohort in the frequency definition. However, lower
data quality and consequently more genotyping errors, as well as
more diverse population backgrounds result in more singletons that
are not filtered out by a 0.001 frequency cutoff.

3.2 Influence of data quality on RVAS performance

As already shown in the previous section, the genotyping quality,
the population background and the definition of the allele frequen-
cies affect the rare variant count in an individual. We hypothesized
that these factors will also inﬂuence the performance of RVAS and
therefore studied different compositions of case—control groups sys—
tematically, while the definition of allele frequencies that is based on
all individuals from the BER and 1KGP cohort was kept fixed. First,
we restricted the selection of cases and controls to individuals from
the BER cohort. In this sample collection there is substantial popula—
tion substructure due to migration to Berlin from different countries.
In addition, variability in data quality also plays a major role, as
exome genotyping quality improved over the recent years substan—
tially. After selecting cases randomly from the BER pool we spiked
in pathogenic mutations of a monogenic disorder.

We tested different strategies of matching controls that have al—
ready been shown to reduce spurious associations in GWAS on com—
mon variants in complex diseases (Guan et al., 2009; Nievergelt
et al., 2007). For all different rare monogenic disorders that we
studied we found a similar qualitative behavior for the selection
strategies. Whenever we discuss the different effects of the matching

Fig. 2. ROC curves for different selection strategies in RVAS and power for dif-
ferent monogenic disorders. (A) Case and control groups of size 5 were simu-
lated by choosing individuals from the BER cohort either randomly or
matched by their similarity. Three different metrics were used to infer kinship
matrices, a simple identity by state matrix, IBS, and two allele-frequency
weighted matrices (W1: high weight on rare variants, W2: high weight on
common variants). Pathogenic mutations of Mabry syndrome (HPMRS) were
spiked into the rare variant sets of individuals of the case group and permuta-
tion-based P—values from CA'I'I' were computed for every gene. The value
pairs for power and FWERs were plotted for a range of significance levels.
The ROC curves show a lower FWER at comparable power for similarity
matched control groups indicating that performance is improved if popula-
tion substructure is accounted for. (B) The detection power increases for
growing group sizes. It is more difficult to detect significant associations for
dominant disorders that are heterogeneous (Noonan syndrome) or disease
genes that are large and highly variable (Kabuki make-up syndrome)

approaches, we will focus on the heterogeneous recessive disorder
HPMRS for the sake of simplicity. Whenever we want to discuss the
differences of the single disorders, we will work with the similarity
metric W1, that uses a higher weight for rare alleles.

For most simulations the performance was superior if the control
group was set up with the closest unrelated matches of the BER co—
hort. The receiver operating characteristics, ROC, for three different
similarity-matching approaches show lower FWER at comparable
significance levels and detection power of the disease compared with
a simulations where controls were randomly chosen (Fig. 2A).

The power increases for all different diseases that we analyzed
when the size of the case—control—groups is growing (Fig. 2B).
However, there are substantial differences in the detection power de—
pending on the mode of inheritance, the heterogeneity of the dis—
order and the variability of the genes. In average it is more likely to
detect a significant association for recessive disorders (Tay—Sachs
syndrome, Cystic Fibrosis, Catel—Manzke syndrome, HPMRS, auto—
somal recessive non—syndromic hearing loss), than dominant dis-
orders (Neurofibromatosis, Kabuki make—up syndrome, Noonan
syndrome). Furthermore significant associations are more readily
detected for disorders that are caused by pathogenic mutations in a
single gene (HEXA in Tay—Sachs syndrome, TGDS in Catel—
Manzke syndrome, CFTR in cystic fibrosis and NFI in
Neurofibromatosis) than in heterogeneous disorders such as
HPMRS, Noonan syndrome or hearing loss. The power of the
RVAS was the lowest for the Kabuki make—up syndrome as the dis—
ease—causing gene KMTZD is large and highly variable, which also
results in many rare variants in the controls.

For almost all rare disorders it is challenging if not impossible to
build up case groups that are large enough for significant associ—
ations. As an alternative readout for performance we therefore
looked at the probability that a true disease gene will yield the low—
est P—value. We found that the probability to rank the true disease
gene at the top increases with growing case—control group sizes for
all different population subsets (Fig. 3).

Fig. 3. Influence of population substructure and data quality on disease gene
identification. (A) The percentage of the target region in a sample that is cov-
ered by more than 20 reads is a good indicator for quality. The larger this per-
centage is, the lower are the expected false positive and false negative error
rates for genotyping. BER is the cohort with most low quality datasets. (B)
The probability to rank the disease-causing gene at the top position increases
as the case-control group size increases in all cohorts. The BER subgroup
which has the highest population substructure and most low-quality datasets
shows the lowest performance. Restricting the analysis to datasets in which
more than 80% of the target region are covered by more than 20 reads (*_H)
improves the performance of RVAS

We hypothesized that excluding samples of lowest quality could
further improve the performance. We thus computed the mean per—
centage of the exome target region that was covered by more than
20 reads and chose 80% as a cutoff for quality. Limiting the RVAS
to a better subset increases the probability to detect the disease caus—
ing gene in all cohorts. We assumed that the similarity metrics match
the control group not only by ethnical background but also their
data quality. By this means we should be able to select high quality
controls for a high quality case automatically without detailed infor—
mation about the coverage.

For BER we could see a major improvement in performance
when controls were similarity matched (Fig. 4A and C). The metric
that overweighs rare variants shows the most prominent gain in per-
formance. As this metric is especially sensitive to data quality differ—
ences as shown in Heinrich et al. 2013, it is most effective in BER,
which is a cohort with large variability in data quality (Heinrich
et al., 2013). To a smaller extent this can also be seen in the 1KGP
data that also show differences in coverage and exhibit technology
specific error signatures (Moore et al., 2013; Nothnagel et al.,
2011)

Interestingly an optimum is not achieved if the maximum avail-
able number of controls is selected. Instead the similarity matching
strategy will ensure that the last suitable controls will not be selected
and spurious associations can thus be reduced.

3.3 Matching controls in ethnically diverse

case groups

Case groups for ultra—rare disorders are often extremely small and
the individuals are from different ethnicities. In Ehmke et al. (2014)
for instance three of the individuals affected by Catel—Manzke syn—
drome originated from Northern Germany, the fourth individual
was of British descent and the fifth individual came from Cameroon.
While the size of the case group might be small due to the rareness
of the disease in Mendelian disorders, there are no such limitations
for the control group. In GWAS of common variants it has been
shown that expanding the control group size may increase the power
(Zhuang et al., 2010). We therefore analyzed the probability to have
the disease gene at the first rank, when gradually including add-
itional controls while keeping the case group fixed at size 5 or 15

Fig. 4. Performance of rare variant associations with increasing control group
size. The simulations were performed on exome data from two different
pools the BER cohort (A and C) and a subgroup of the 1KGP of equal size (B
and D). The subgroup of the 1KGP was also matched to the BER cohort based
on W2 similarity to minimize differences in performance that are due to dis-
tinct population substructure between these pools. The size of the case group
is kept fixed at 5 (A and B) or 15 (C and D) individuals with pathogenic muta-
tions for HPMRS. For both case group sizes the probability increases that the
disease gene has the highest CA'I'I' test statistic if additional controls are
included. All strategies that select the controls by similarity (W1, W2 and [38)
outperform a random selection of controls. In the BER cohort, for which the
data quality is more heterogeneous than in the 1KGP, the best strategy to se-
lect the controls is W1. This similarity metric is especially sensitive to data
quality. The effect of a similarity-matched control group on performance is
more prominent for the smaller case group size N325, where an optimum is
reached when 60—120 suitable controls are selected

position with a growing number of controls. However, in our RVAS
analysis the maximum is not necessarily reached if all remaining in-
dividuals from the pool were added as controls. This is especially
true if the controls were added based on their similarity to the cases.
In the BER cohort we had an optimum in the performance when
around 60 most similar controls were added (Fig. 4A and C). The
probability of identifying the disease gene was also considerably
higher for all similarity—based selection strategies of the controls
compared with a random setup of this group. The probability for
identifying the disease gene decreases again if controls are included
that present an unsuitable match with respect to data quality or eth—
nic background. The tipping point depends also on the substructure
of the available data pool. When we performed the same simulations
on a subset of the 1KGP project that has a similar population sub—
structure as the BER cohort we saw a better performance overall
due to higher average data quality and a maximum for similarity
matched control groups around 120 samples (Fig. 4B).

3.4 Disease gene identification in three case studies

As real case scenarios we tested the performance of RVAS in the dis—
ease gene identification of three monogenic disorders that were
recently resolved, Kabuki make—up syndrome, HPMRS and Catel—
Manzke syndrome (Ehmke et al., 2014; Krawitz et al., 2013; Ng
et al., 2010). For all three disorders, the disease gene was identified

Fig. 5. RVAS for three recently resolved monogenic disorders. Kabuki make-
up syndrome, Mabry syndrome, and Catel—Manzke syndrome are Mendelian
disorders for which pathogenic mutations have been identified in new dis-
ease genes by intersections of candidate variant sets in case groups of unre-
lated, affected individuals comprising 10, 7 or 13 cases. For fewer cases the
approach of an intersection filter would have been inconclusive. By a RVAS
approach with 40 controls, however, the probability of identifying the disease
gene in such cohorts is still considerable even when the number of cases
with pathogenic mutations in these cohorts is reduced markedly (A, C and E).
Additionally, a selection of similarity-matched controls may also help to re-
duce spurious associations effectively: The 00 plots (B, D and F) show the
observed versus the expected P—values for instances of the RVAS simulations
where 5, 3 and 7 individuals had pathogenic mutations in the disease genes
KMT2D, TGDS and PGAP2 and showed the lowest P-value only when similar-
ity-matched controls were used. When random controls are used, the P-val-
ues of highly variable genes such as NFX1, KRT1 or CSHL1 are inflated

by analyzing cohorts of unrelated, affected individuals with an ap—
proach that is commonly referred to as intersection filtering
(Gilissen et al., 2012; Robinson et al., 2011). In the case of Kabuki
make—up syndrome 10 individuals were analyzed, the HPMRS co—
hort comprised 13 samples and the disease gene in Catel—Manzke
syndrome was identified in a case group of size 7. The example of
the study of the Kabuki make—up syndrome shows also the limita—
tions of the conventional intersection approach: First, the authors
considered genes that showed rare non—synonymous variants in all
of the affected individuals. This filtering criterion was fulfilled by 34
genes and didn’t allow the disease gene identification. Only when
the authors restricted their set of candidate variants to loss—of—func—
tion mutations, they could pinpoint a single gene, KMT2D, that
showed such mutations in at least 7 out of 10 patients.

We hypothesized that a RVAS should be more straightforward
and also more sensitive for disease gene identification and reanalyzed
the Kabuki make—up cohort by subsequently increasing the number of
pathogenic variants from 1 to 10. With the same set of pathogenic
variants as previously published, a RVAS approach using 40 similarity
matched controls would have ranked the disease gene at the top pos—
ition in almost 100% of our simulations when at least 6 out of 10 in—
dividuals had a pathogenic non—synonymous mutation (Fig. 5A).

Also for the other two disorders, Catel—Manzke syndrome and
HPMRS the disease gene identification is highly effective even if the
fraction of samples with pathogenic mutations is smaller than in the
initial study. Especially the disease gene TGDS in Catel—Manzke
syndrome, has such a low variability, that it can readily be identified
with as little as four affected samples (Fig. 5C). Spurious associ—
ations often occur for highly variable genes, for example, genes from
the mucin family or for genes that show a higher rate of calling arti-
facts e.g. due to pseudogenes, such as in KRTI. Interestingly, the

false positive error resulting from such genes can also be reduced by
using a similarity—matched setup of the control group.

4 Discussion

The increasing availability of high—throughput sequencing technol—
ogy has revealed the cause of multiple rare monogenic disorders
over the recent years. Many of these discoveries could be made be—
cause classical linkage analysis in large affected pedigrees could limit
the genomic search space. However, it seems that many of the low
hanging fruits have been picked by now and that collections of un—
solved cases are building up that require different analysis strategies.

In some of the rare disorders a single pathogenic allele does not
need to be fully penetrant and might require additional modifiers to
develop the phenotype. In autism spectrum disorders it seems to be
the mutational load of functionally compromising variants in several
genes that seems to matter (Krumm et al., 2015). Especially in these
instances case group association studies that focus on rare variants,
might help to find further disease—related loci.

Although GWAS have been a big success in identifying target
genes for complex disorders there are some key differences when it
comes to rare. Mathieson and McVean (2012) showed that popula—
tion substructure from rare variants is systematically different from
stratification that is due to common variants. They demonstrated
that existing methods to correct for confounding effects in CVAS
cannot account for the substructure introduced by rare variants.

As correction of substructure is not feasible in RVAS, strategies
to identify suitable controls seem to be a promising alternative. In
our work we therefore focused on methods that match controls
based on their similarity. For associations studies that build on SNP
data there has already been pioneering work by Guan et al. (2009)
on genotype—based matching approaches and the metrics that we
analyze for selecting controls also build on these efforts. We studied
systematically how NGS data quality, as well as different population
backgrounds influence the chances of identifying the disease gene in
small case groups of individuals with ultra—rare. We also found that
in RVAS a similarity metric that puts a stronger weight on sharing
rare alleles shows the best performance in the statistical analysis, es—
pecially if the data quality is heterogeneous. We also showed that
the profiles of rare variants between different European populations
and different sequencing studies do vary considerably, which has im—
portant consequences for the setup of RVAS. Whenever ancestral
components are potential confounders, stratification—based match—
ing approaches such as described by Epstein et al. (2012) should
also be considered.

From a statistical point of view it is often not optimal to include
as many controls as possible, if they are not matching due to data
quality or ethnicity. The best performance may be achieved if sam—
ples that are prone to cause spurious associations are not included.
Whenever there is high variability in the quality of the datasets in
the case group a matching approach that is also sensitive to the rate
of genotyping errors seems to be the method of choice. However,
there is no simple rule of thumb for a selection strategy that applies
to any case cohort. In some datasets simulations with known patho—
genic mutations such as described in this work might help to decide
whether sequencing of additional controls would improve the statis—
tical power.

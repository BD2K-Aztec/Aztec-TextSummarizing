ABSTRACT

Motivation: The determinants of kinase-substrate phosphorylation can
be found both in the substrate sequence and the surrounding cellular
context. Cell cycle progression, interactions with mediating proteins
and even prior phosphorylation events are necessary for kinases to
maintain substrate specificity. While much work has focussed on the
use of sequence-based methods to predict phosphorylation sites, there
has been very little work invested into the application of systems biology
to understand phosphorylation. Lack of specificity in many kinase sub-
strate binding motifs means that sequence methods for predicting
kinase binding sites are susceptible to high false-positive rates.
Results: We present here a model that takes into account protein—
protein interaction information, and protein abundance data across the
cell cycle to predict kinase substrates for 59 human kinases that are
representative of important biological pathways. The model shows
high accuracy for substrate prediction (with an average AUC of 0.86)
across the 59 kinases tested. When using the model to complement
sequence-based kinase-specific phosphorylation site prediction, we
found that the additional information increased prediction perform-
ance for most comparisons made, particularly on kinases from the
CMGC family. We then used our model to identify functional overlaps
between predicted CDK2 substrates and targets from the E2F family
of transcription factors. Our results demonstrate that a model harness-
ing context data can account for the short-falls in sequence informa-
tion and provide a robust description of the cellular events that
regulate protein phosphorylation.

1 INTRODUCTION

Regulation of cellular processes occurs on multiple levels, with
epigenetic modiﬁers and transcription factors (TFs) controlling
gene expression, while various post-translational modiﬁcations
regulate many protein functions (Blom et al., 2004; Choudhary

et al., 2009; Hwang et al., 2010). The most ubiquitous of post-
translationalmodiﬁcations is phosphorylation, with at least 70%
of human proteins estimated to be phosphorylation substrates
(Olsen et al., 2010). Phosphorylation is likely a signiﬁcant factor
in regulating the function of complex organisms, with a signiﬁ-
cant increase in the numbers of phosphorylation sites in eukary-
otic compared with prokaryotic proteins (Gnad et al., 2011).
Phosphorylation is known to have numerous regulatory roles
across the cell cycle, and speciﬁc kinases have been implicated
in the regulation of G1 phase (Harbour et al., 1999), the G1 /S
phase transition (Sherr and Roberts, 1999) and DNA replication
and damage repair (Coverley et al., 2002). Phosphorylation is
particularly ubiquitous during mitosis where many complex op-
erations such as spindle formation, centrosome maturation/sep-
aration and chromosome attachment to the spindle are
controlled by kinases (Johnson, 2011).

While advanced phosphoproteomic technologies have suc-
ceeded in identifying thousands of phosphorylation sites across
multiple proteomes (Huttlin et al., 2010; Olsen et al., 2010), there
has been an ever widening gap between known phosphorylation
sites and the kinases responsible for those sites (Diella et al.,
2004). Currently just over 10% of the phosphorylation sites re-
corded in the eukaryotic phosphorylation site database
Phospho.ELM is annotated with a kinase. There have been ex-
amples of in vitro studies identifying kinase-substrate binding
events (Mok et al., 2010), and while these studies offer interesting
insights into the consensus motifs of kinase binding sites, it is
unknown whether the binding events observed in vitro would
occur in vivo. Determining kinase-substrates in vivo is non-trivial
however, though there have been promising results from combin-
ing in vitro kinase detection assays with in vivo phosphoproteo-
mics 0(ue et al., 2012). As a result of the inherent difﬁculty in
determining in vivo kinase substrates, there has been a great inter-
est in developing computational tools to predict kinase-speciﬁc
phosphorylation sites, with over 40 phosphorylation site-predic-
tion methods published (Trost and Kusalik, 2011). While some
methods aim only to predict phosphorylation sites (Blom et al.,
1999; Ingrell et al., 2007), the majority predict kinase-speciﬁc
phosphorylation sites.

Historically, phosphorylation site predictors have operated
primarily on protein amino acid sequences, relying on the
information contained in the sequence region surrounding phos-
phorylation sites. It has long been recognized that short sequence

Modelling cellular context to map kinase-substrate phosphorylation events

 

motifs alone are insufﬁcient for achieving respectable accuracy
in predicting kinase-speciﬁc phosphorylation sites. As a result,
prediction methods have often complemented sequence infor-
mation with other types of data such as knowledge of 3D
structure (Saunders et al., 2008; Durek et al., 2009), sequence
disorder (Gao et al., 2010) and kinase family similarity 0(ue
et al., 2011). While such additional data typically improve predic-
tion performance to an extent, they do not reﬂect the wider cellu-
lar regulatory mechanisms that cause kinases to target their
correct substrates—a protein with an appropriate kinase binding
site will not necessarily come into contact with that kinase (Zhu
et al., 2005).

The phosphorylation of a target substrate by a kinase is not
determined solely by its binding afﬁnity, but by various context
factors that determine how a kinase comes into contact with its
substrates (Kobe et al., 2005). This is recognized by the
NetworKIN predictor (Horn et al., 2014), which combines
sequence-based scores with a score generated on the basis of a
STRING network (Szklarczyk et al., 2011). Context factors can
include cellular location (Scott and Pawson, 2009), mediating
and activating proteins such as scaffold proteins (Good et al.,
2011), cyclins (Lim and Kaldis, 2013) and cell cycle-speciﬁc ex-
pression of kinases and their substrates. Protein—protein inter-
action (PPI) data can certainly be used to represent such context
factors; though while there is vast amounts of PPI data currently
available in databases such as BioGRID (Chatr-aryamontri
et al., 2013) and STRING, incomplete coverage and variable
certainty means that the integration of context features into a
model is non-trivial.

In this study, we explore a probabilistic model to accommo-
date missing values, seamless combination of protein interactions
and cell-cycle expression, and to provide ﬂexible options for
querying potential kinase substrates. The model we present
here, named PhosphoPICK (Phosphorylation in a Protein
Interaction Context for Kinases), integrates known kinase-
substrate relationships, PPI, and cell-cycle data to predict
kinase substrates for 59 human kinases. PhosphoPICK shows
high prediction accuracy, with a mean AUC of 0.86 across the
59 kinases. We then demonstrate how our method can boost the
prediction accuracy of kinase-speciﬁc phosphorylation site
prediction by combining PhosphoPICK predictions with the
phosphorylation site predictions from three previously published
methods. We ﬁnd that PhosphoPICK improves kinase-speciﬁc
phosphorylation site prediction for most comparisons made,
though greater performance increases were noticed on CMGC
kinases—in particular cyclin-dependant kinases (CDKs), where
we observed substantial performance gains as measured by
AUC50. We show that proteins predicted to be CDK2 substrates
by PhosphoPICK have GO terms consistent with known CDK2
substrates, and investigate the functional overlap between known
and predicted CDK2 substrates, and the targets of speciﬁc E2F
TFs using ChIP-Seq data.

2 METHODS

2.1 Bayesian network model

We used a Bayesian network (BN) to design our model. BNs differ from
machine learning tools that have previously been used for

 

Fig. 1. The PhosphoPICK BN model. Each of the kinase (K) nodes,
representing a phosphorylation event by that kinase, are conditioned
on a latent variable incorporating protein abundance across four stages
of the cell cycle: Mitosis (M), G1, S and G2. The ‘leaf’ nodes represent
protein interaction (P) events between the proteins represented in the
nodes and a potential substrate. These nodes are conditioned on relevant
kinase-speciﬁc phosphorylation events

phosphorylation site prediction in several important ways. BNs are trans-
parent, allowing for an understanding of how the variables in the model
inﬂuence the ﬁnal outcome (Patrick et al., 2012). Furthermore, the prob-
abilistic nature of a BN means that even in the absence of missing data,
the model can still infer the most likely value of the unknown variables on
the basis of the known data (Bauer et al., 2011; Mehdi et al., 2011). We
represent observations about protein interactions, kinase-speciﬁc phos-
phorylation events and cell-cycle proﬁles as Boolean variables in a BN
model (Fig. 1). The model represents observations about a phosphoryl-
ation substrate—the kinases that bind to it, protein interactions, and
whether it is upregulated during the cell-cycle phases. The kinase nodes
are linked to PPI events that are believed to be relevant for the kinase to
phosphorylate substrates. A latent variable is used to capture information
from the cell-cycle data, and the kinase nodes are then conditioned on this
latent variable.

2.2 Data resources

2.2.] Known kinase-substrate relationships We obtained kinase
substrates from Phospho.ELM and HPRD, after converting HPRD
IDs to Uniprot identiﬁers. To identify protein interactions between kin-
ases and their substrates we selected kinases for which we found greater
than 10 substrates. In total, we use 59 human kinases along with a total of
1210 substrates. Table 1 shows the numbers of substrates that were iden-
tiﬁed for each of the 59 kinases. The 1210 substrates contained 2964
unique phosphorylation sites that were annotated with at least one
kinase.

2.2.2 PPI and association data To identify and model interaction
networks of kinases and their substrates, we used PPI data. In cases
where physical interaction data are unavailable, associations inferred
on the basis of other sources such as gene coexpression or literature
mining may be informative, and such information is available in the
STRING database. PPI information was taken from the Biological
General Repository for Interaction Datasets (BioGRID) (Chatr-
aryamontri et al., 2013) by selecting entries that were of type ‘direct
interaction’ or ‘physical association’. As PPIs are represented in binary

format, this information was incorporated into the model as a
Boolean value. The STRING database scores an association probability
between two proteins, with a score of 0.4 deﬁned as medium conﬁdence.
To convert this probability into a Boolean value we deﬁned cutoff
probabilities, such that given some cutoff 0, any association with a
probability :0 was classiﬁed as true, and any association with a prob-
ability <0 was classiﬁed as false. We tested three cutoff probabilities,
starting at the medium conﬁdence level of 0.4 and increasing in incre-
ments of 0.2. We found that a cutoff probability of 0.6 provided the best
overall performance (Supplementary Table S1), and is the cutoff used in
this work.

To identify relevant connections between kinases and PPI events, the
following steps were taken. Substrates were ﬁrst grouped according to
their kinase (one substrate could be assigned to multiple kinases).
BioGRID was then searched for proteins that interacted both with a
substrate and with its kinase—these proteins were added to a pool of
potential protein interaction connections. For each kinase, the proteins in
the pool were ranked in descending order according to the number of
interactions that were observed with the kinase’s substrates. An observa-
tion is deﬁned as a substrate—protein interaction occurring in BioGRID
and/or the STRING database. A count c was deﬁned, so that for each
kinase only the top c protein interactions were used to form connections.
To ensure that there would be enough observations of substrate-protein
interactions for setting model parameters, a lower bound of 10 was set
such that for a given kinase, at least 10 substrate—protein observations
were required for the protein to be considered as a connection to that
kinase. We tested three different upper bounds of c: 25, 40 and 50 to
determine the effect of varying sized interaction networks on prediction
performance.

2.2.3 Protein cell-cycle data. In order to model the availability of
substrates during the cell cycle, we used data obtained from the
experiments by Olsen et al. (2010), who measured the abundance of pro-
teins at six stages throughout the cell cycle—M phase, G1 phase, the
transition between G1 and S phase (G1 /S), early S phase, late S phase
and G2 phase. An asynchronous population of cells was also measured,
and the signal used to log normalize the measurements from the cells
arrested during the six stages. A protein with a value of 0 during a
stage of the cell cycle has an abundance equivalent to the asynchronous
population, whereas a negative value indicates downregulation and a
positive value indicates upregulation. To avoid ﬁtting the model
too strongly to data generated from a single cell type, we represented
proteins’ cell-cycle proﬁles in a simple binary format across four
stages—M, G1, S and G2. We collapsed the G1 and G1 /S stages in
to the single variable ‘G1’ and the early S and late S stages into the
variable ‘S’. If a protein has a value greater than 0 that stage is labelled
as true; otherwise it is labelled as false. The G1 and S variables were set to
true if at least one of their respective collapsed stages had a value greater
than 0.

2.3 Model parameters and training

The variables in the network were represented with two kinds of prob-
ability tables. A conditional probability table (CPT) represents all pos-
sible values that a variable X can take given the set of parents, pa(X), it is
conditioned on. Parameters are set during training by calculating the
frequency of occurrence of all possible conﬁgurations of pa(X). If X
does not have parents, the CPT simply represents the observed frequency
from training data of X being true.

For situations where a variable is conditioned on greater than six
parents, we used a variation of the Noisy-OR approximation (Onisko
et al., 2001). In order to set the parameters of the Noisy-OR table
during training, each row (representing a parent variable) in the table
was calculated as follows: each training sample where the parent is

observed as being true was identiﬁed. A weighted frequency for each
parent pa was calculated such that

1 ” t
freqqm) n  ((t +f)pc0nf,-)’

where n is the number of conﬁgurations of parent variables where pa is
observed to be true, pconﬁ is the number of parents set to true in conﬁg-
uration i, t is the count of the variable the Noisy-OR node is representing
being true during the ith conﬁguration of parents and f is the count of it
being false.

For the latent variable, and variables that are conditioned on it, par-
ameters are calculated using the expectation-maximization algorithm on a
training set (Do and Batzoglou, 2008).

2.4 Evaluation and deﬁnition of negative test sets

A common problem to phosphorylation site prediction is that of deﬁning
a negative test set (Trost and Kusalik, 2011). However, as our model is
not trained using sequence data, we were able to use a sequence scoring
method to deﬁne negative test sets for each of the 59 kinases in the model.
To score protein sequences for kinase binding sites, we used the Predikin
web server (Ellis and Kobe, 2011) to obtain position weight matrices
(PWMs) for 53 of the kinases in the model. For the remaining six we
constructed PWMs using phosphorylation sites from curated data
(Supplementary Methods S1.1). For a given kinase, we scored each
substrate in the training data set by obtaining the highest scoring
potential phosphorylation site. We then ranked the substrates based on
the highest scoring site from lowest to highest, and assigned an equal
number of positive and negative substrates for that kinase. As very low
scores indicate a protein that the kinase cannot phosphorylate, this
gives us a high-conﬁdence negative test set for each of the kinases in
the model.

We evaluated the model for each kinase for its ability to correctly
predict known substrates compared with the negative set. To score the
probability of a kinase phosphorylating a query protein, all nodes in the
network were set according to the relevant data for the query protein
except for the kinase that we were inferring. Model performance was
evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis by
calculating the area under the ROC curve (AUC) (Baldi et al., 2000).
We used 15-fold cross validation, and performed the cross validation 10
times with different data set splits. To avoid the possibility of the
model gaining information about the test data during training, we
ensured that each protein interaction variable was only connected to a
kinase if, within the training fold, there were 10 (our previously deﬁned
lower bound) or more kinase substrates interacting with that protein.
The data sets used to train and test the model are available in the
Supplementary material.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Model performance for predicting kinase substrates

We generated ﬁve BN models by grouping kinases according to
their family similarities (Manning et al., 2002): CMGC, AGC,
TK, CAMK and a combined model that incorporated kinases
from the CKl, STE, atypical and other families. We tested the
ability of the model to classify kinase substrates with varying
numbers of protein interaction connections, and under three con-
ditions. To gauge the level of inﬂuence that substrate abundance
during the cell cycle has on prediction performance, we evaluated
a version of the model excluding the cell-cycle variables (PPI only
model), and compared the performance to the full model. When
making inferences about a kinase-substrate phosphorylation

Modelling cellular context to map kinase-substrate phosphorylation events

 

event, the model relies on the knowledge of other potential kin-
ases phosphorylating that substrate. However, for the majority
of proteins there is little, if any, experimental information on any
known kinase-speciﬁc phosphorylation events. Therefore, to de-
termine whether the model could be reliably extended to the
wider proteome, we tested model performance when setting
non-query kinase nodes to false on the basis of their sequence
binding motifs (Supplementary Methods S1.2).

The AUC results (Table 1) for 10 cross-validation runs eval-
uated on all 59 kinases in the model for the three different con-
ditions demonstrate that the prediction accuracy of the full
model is quite high, with most kinases having median AUCs
surpassing 0.8. The average AUC over all of the kinases is
0.86. The generally low-standard deviation indicates that these
results are consistent regardless of the breakup of training/test
data that is presented to the model. We tested three different
values for maximum number of protein interactions that could
be connected to a kinase variable (25, 40 and 50), but found that
increasing the number of protein interaction events connected to
the kinase variables had very little effect on the performance of
the model (Supplementary Table S2), indicating the model’s abil-
ity to make classiﬁcations based on a relatively small number of
connections to the individual kinase nodes.

When comparing the performance of the PPI only model to
the full model, we found that on average the inclusion of protein
abundance data collected across the cell cycle offered modest
improvements to prediction performance. For some kinases
there was a greater performance improvement—for example a
15% increase for PRKC kinases, a nearly 10% increase for the
tyrosine kinase CSK—but for many other kinases the inclusion
of cell-cycle data seemed to have little effect. This demonstrates
that while the PPI data provide the main source of information
for the model, the use of cell-cycle data can offer improved
prediction performance for some kinases. This performance
increase occurs despite the fact that we only have cell-cycle
data for less than half of the substrates in our set: the model
infers the cell-cycle proﬁles for the remaining proteins. This
indicates that the model, when trained on cell-cycle data, can
still be applied to query proteins that have no associated cell-
cycle data.

Table 1 also shows a comparison between setting the kinase
nodes with database (“Full model”) versus sequence information
(“Seq. approx.”). We found that for many kinases, using se-
quence to set the kinase nodes actually resulted in an increase
in performance. The median AUC for the CMGC kinases went
from 0.87 using database information to 0.91 using sequence,
and the median AUC for the tyrosine kinases increased from
0.88 to 0.94.

The possibility was raised that as the kinase-substrate data
from HPRD and Phospho.ELM is sourced from the literature,
and the STRING database also includes text mining from the
literature, a system of circular logic could be inﬂating the per-
formance values. To determine whether such an effect was occur-
ring, we re-ran our simulations for each kinase with the text
mining information for that kinase removed (Supplementary
Methods S1.3). We found that while for some kinases this infor-
mation appeared to have a large impact on prediction capability,
it was not the case for the majority of kinases (Supplementary
Table S3).

Fig. 2. Comparison between predicting kinase-speciﬁc phosphorylation sites with three alternative scoring methods, and when the methods are informed
by PhosphoPICK. AUC50 was calculated for each kinase as a measure of the predictive performance at low false-positive levels. Shown here are the
average values for each individual BN. The comparison is made by normalizing the scores of the alternative methods to a value between 0 and 1, then

summing this value with the PhosphoPICK prediction for a substrate

3.2 Improving sequence-based prediction of
phosphorylation sites

For the remainder of this article, the results were generated using
the full model, with a PPI count of 25, and setting non-query
kinase nodes on the basis of their sequence binding motifs. We
tested the ability of PhosphoPICK to complement two phos-
phorylation site predictors that operate on sequence data:
Predikin (Ellis and Kobe, 2011) and GPS Oiue et al., 2011).
We also tested NetworKIN (Horn et al., 2014), which combines
sequence scores with a context score generated on the basis of
STRING associations. Comparisons were made by normalizing
the values of the methods being tested against, and summing the
PhosphoPICK prediction (Supplementary Methods S1.4).
Figure 2 shows the AUC50 (the AUC obtained when calculating
ROC up to the ﬁftieth false positive) comparison for Predikin,
GPS and NetworKIN across the ﬁve BNs, where the highest
false-positive rate for serine/threonine kinases was 0.0005, and
the highest for tyrosine kinases was 0.002. Individual results for
each kinase are shown in Supplementary Tables S4—S6. The re-
sults show that across all kinase families, there is an average
increase in performance when the Predikin and GPS scores are
complemented with PhosphoPICK predictions, with largest per-
formance increases observed with kinases from the CMGC
family. We found that the performance of GPS improved by 2-
fold for predicting CMGC sites when combined with
PhosphoPICK, and that the performance of Predikin was im-
proved by over 6-fold. The smallest performance increases were
observed with tyrosine kinases, where we found a 15 % perform-
ance increase for GPS and a 40% increase for Predikin.

We found that in most cases, PhosphoPICK was unable to
improve the performance of the NetworKIN predictions. As
Figure 2 shows, the differences in AUC50 between classifying
phosphorylation sites with NetworKIN alone and
NetworKIN + PhosphoPICK are minor. However, as the

NetworKIN score is already a combination of a STRING and
sequence-based score, it is possible that a simple summing of
scores cannot yield further performance increases.

3.3 Understanding E2F and CDK2 regulation

To evaluate the ability of the predictions made by PhosphoPICK
to provide biological insights, we used CDK2 as a case study for
a proteome-wide analysis. To determine whether predictions
were consistent with what is known about CDK2, several GO
enrichment analyses were performed (Supplementary Methods
S1.5), comparing signiﬁcantly overrepresented GO terms
(Fisher’s exact test, Bonferroni correction, E—value<0.05) ob-
tained for known CDK2 substrates with those obtained for the
predicted substrates. We found that the known CDK2 substrates
were enriched most strongly in various terms related to the G1 /S
transition of the cell cycle, such as DNA damage response and
DNA repair (Supplementary Table S7). This is consistent with
the role of CDK2 in the regulation of the transition from G1 to S
phase in response to DNA damage (Coverley et al., 2002).

To investigate the agreement of PhosphoPICK predictions
with known CDK2 substrates, we performed a proteome-wide
scoring for CDK2 and took the top 300 novel predictions,
excluding known CDK2 substrates from the set of predicted
substrates. We again performed a G0 enrichment analysis, and
compared the values of the prediction terms with the signiﬁcant
terms that were found during the analysis on the known sub-
strates. Supplementary Table S7 shows the GO terms found to
be signiﬁcantly overrepresented among known CDK2 substrates,
ranked from most signiﬁcant to least signiﬁcant. Over half of the
terms (31/59) were found to be signiﬁcantly overrepresented
among the novel substrates predicted by PhosphoPICK.

CDK2 is known to be a regulator of the TF E2F1 (Lorna
Morris and Thangue, 2000), a member of the E2F family, that
is known to play a role in the G1 /S transition and DNA

Modelling cellular context to map kinase-substrate phosphorylation events

 

replication during the S phase (Attwoll et al., 2004; Lammens
et al., 2009; Biswas and Johnson, 2012). The E2F family is com-
prised of three classes of TFs: transcriptional activators, retino-
blastoma (Rb)-dependent repressors, and Rb-independent
repressors. What is currently lacking is an understanding of
what speciﬁc roles in the S phase are controlled at transcriptional
level by E2F, and at the post-translational level by CDK2.

In order to investigate what overlapping functions may exist
between E2F-regulated transcription and CDK2-mediated phos-
phorylation, we took ChIP-Seq data (ENCODE Project
Consortium, 2012) for E2F1 (activator), E2F 4 (Rb-dependent re-
pressor) and E2F 6 (Rb-independent repressor). Supplementary
Figure S1 shows a Venn diagram of the unique and overlapping
gene targets that exist among the three TFs (Supplementary
Methods S1.6). It has been shown previously that overlapping
targets between E2F1 and E2F 4 are enriched in DNA replication
and repair GO terms (Lee et al., 2011). We found that the over-
lapping targets of all three TFs are also enriched in such GO
terms.

We then combined our set of predicted CDK2 substrates with
known CDK2 substrates and identiﬁed proteins from this com-
bined set of substrates that were in the unique and overlapping
groups of E2F targets. GO enrichment tests were performed with
the CDK2 substrates as the foreground and the remainder of the
TF target group as the background. This allowed us to detect
what role CDK2 plays within these TF target groups.
Supplementary Tables S8—S14 contain the GO terms found to
be signiﬁcantly overrepresented (E-value <0.05) among CDK2
substrates in the TF target groups. While we found signiﬁcantly
overrepresented GO terms in all TF target groups, we noticed a
larger number of process-speciﬁc terms among the unique E2F1
targets (Supplementary Table S8), unique E2F 6 targets
(Supplementary Table S9) and the overlapping targets among
all three TFs (Supplementary Table S11). We found that
CDK2 substrates among unique E2F1 targets and unique
E2F 6 targets were enriched in several terms relating to the regu-
lation of apoptosis, as well as ubiquitination. Substrates in the
overlapping group of targets of all three TFs were enriched in
terms relating to DNA replication and DNA damage repair.

4 DISCUSSION

Protein phosphorylation is a highly regulated process, being con-
trolled by the binding speciﬁcity to the protein kinase catalytic
site, as well as various cellular processes that further enhance the
kinase-substrate ﬁdelity (Kobe et al., 2005; Zhu et al., 2005). We
have demonstrated how a probabilistic model of PPIs and cell-
cycle data can be used to accurately classify kinase substrates.
Importantly, we found that our model, when combined with
sequence-operating methods, was able to improve the accuracy
of kinase-speciﬁc phosphorylation site prediction at false-positive
levels below 0.002 for tyrosine kinases and below 0.0005 for
serine/threonine kinases.

One potential point of concern in this approach is that we only
had access to cell-cycle data for a single cell type, and whether this
could result in a tissue-speciﬁc inﬂuence that impeded predictions
in some cell types. However, as the phosphorylation site data we
obtained from Phospho.ELM originates from multiple cell types
[including, for example, HeLa cells Wells and Hickson, 1995;

Kraft et al., 2003), HEK 293T cells (Johnson et al., 1999),
MELN cells (Medunjanin et al., 2005) and T98G glioma cells
(Hansen et al., 2001)], the performance of the model across
these varying cell types validates the appropriateness of the data
we used. We attribute this largely to the simple representation of
the cell-cycle data as four Boolean variables, which would be un-
likely to result in a cell type-speciﬁc bias. Somewhat counterintui-
tively, we found that the cell-cycle data did not improve prediction
performance for the CDKs—kinases whose activity is strongly
linked to cell-cycle progression—while offering performance in-
crease to other kinases. Though this study focussed on the use of
protein abundance data for representing protein cell-cycle pro-
ﬁles, we note that dynamic gene-expression data across the cell-
cycle also exists for human proteins (Gauthier et al., 2010).
Further study could investigate what inﬂuence dynamic gene-ex-
pression data can provide to kinase-substrate prediction.

We observed some variations among the performance evalu-
ations for the individual kinases, indicating that the model works
better on certain kinases. However, we found that the perform-
ance for prediction of kinase substrates (Table 1) was not neces-
sarily an indicator of what improvement would be seen when
applying the model to phosphorylation site prediction. For ex-
ample, the PhosphoPICK algorithm had excellent performance
when classifying tyrosine kinase substrates—in several cases with
AUCs greater than 0.9. However, when predicting phosphoryl-
ation sites of tyrosine kinases using Predikin and GPS, we found
that the prediction of tyrosine kinase phosphorylation sites ben-
eﬁtted the least from the addition of the PhosphoPICK score,
and the score appeared to be detrimental to predictions made by
NetworKIN.

The kinase family where PhosphoPICK consistently demon-
strated the most powerful prediction performance was the
CMGC family—principally CDK and MAPK kinases. We
found that PhosphoPICK generally improved the prediction of
phosphorylation sites for the CMGC kinases as tested across
each of the three methods, though there were some cases
where PhosphoPICK resulted in a decrease in the accuracy of
NetworKIN predictions. As the kinases in these families have
very similar binding patterns, it is likely that mediating proteins
captured by the PhosphoPICK model make a greater contribu-
tion in the correct assignment of a kinase to a substrate. These
results lend support to the intuitive notion that the addition of
context information would support sequence-based predictions
most powerfully when the kinase binding patterns are less spe-
ciﬁc, or are very similar among family members—or both, as is
the case with CDK and MAPK kinases.

It was interesting to note that the putative CDK2 substrates
within the overlapping E2F 1, E2F4 and E2F 6 targets groups
were overrepresented with G0 terms related to DNA replication
and DNA damage repair. Considering this group of genes was
itself already enriched in such terms (when compared with the
proteome), this underscores the importance that CDK2 has in
regulating DNA replication and DNA damage repair (Deans
et al., 2006; Satyanarayana and Kaldis, 2009). There are several
potential responses to DNA damage, but in some cases cells may
undergo apoptosis (Zhou and Elledge, 2000; Bakkenist and
Kastan, 2004). We also noticed that putative CDK2 substrates
within the unique E2F1 and E2F 6 target groups were both
overrepresented with terms relating to the regulation of

apoptosis and ubiquitination. These are both processes that
CDK2 has previously been implicated in (Hayami et al., 2005;
Huang et al., 2006), and ubiquitination is also known to play an
important role in regulating apoptotic proteins (Zhang et al.,
2004). E2F1 is known to be a regulator of apoptosis
(DeGregori et al., 1997), and similarly E2F 6 can negatively regu-
late apoptosis Wang et al., 2006), so it was interesting to ﬁnd
that the putative CDK2 substrates within the unique E2F1 and
E2F 6 target groups were enriched in apoptosis and ubiquitina-
tion GO terms. These results seem to suggest a dynamic regula-
tory interplay between the E2F family at the transcriptional level,
and the CDK2 kinase at the post-translational level.

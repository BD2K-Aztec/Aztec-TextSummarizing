ABSTRACT

Summary: Interactions between various types of molecules that regu-
late crucial cellular processes are extensively investigated by
high-throughput experiments and require dedicated computational
methods for the analysis of the resulting data. In many cases, these
data can be represented as a bipartite graph because it describes
interactions between elements of two different types such as the in-
fluence of different experimental conditions on cellular variables or the
direct interaction between receptors and their activators/inhibitors.
One of the major challenges in the analysis of such noisy datasets is
the statistical evaluation of the relationship between any two elements
of the same type. Here, we present SICOP (significant co-interaction
patterns), an implementation of a method that provides such an evalu-
ation based on the number of their common interaction partners, their
so-called co-interaction. This general network analytic method,
proved successful in diverse fields, provides a framework for assess-
ing the significance of this relationship by comparison with the
expected co-interaction in a suitable null model of the same bipartite
graph. SICOP takes into consideration up to two distinct types of
interactions such as up- or downregulation. The tool is written in
Java and accepts several common input formats and supports differ-
ent output formats, facilitating further analysis and visualization. Its key
features include a user-friendly interface, easy installation and platform
independence.

1 INTRODUCTION

High-throughput experiments resulting in interaction data
require computational methods that enable the identiﬁcation of
their key interaction patterns. If the interaction is observed be-
tween elements of two different types, the data can be modelled
as a bipartite graph in which the elements are represented by
nodes and their interaction by edges. More than one type of
interaction, e.g. up- and downregulation, can be represented
this way by the edges of the graph.

Existing tools for the analysis of bipartite graphs like the R
packages bipartite (Dormann et al., 2009) or networksis
(Admiraal and Handcock, 2008) are mainly tailored to the

purpose of understanding principles in community ecology.
Systems biology applications pose three important challenges
that these tools cannot cope with: (i) large-scale experiments
that are often prone to noise, (ii) mild interaction effects that
are difﬁcult to detect and (iii) simultaneously observed distinct
types of interactions.

A recently suggested method deals with these problems by
using a network analytic approach (Uhlmann et al., 2012;
Malumbres, 2012). In this procedure, the number of common
interaction partners of two elements is compared with its
expected value in a randomized null model that maintains the
number of interaction partners of all elements. The approach
adopts and extends the general procedure for assessing the stat-
istical signiﬁcance of the so-called network motifs (Milo et al.,
2002). The underlying assumption is that two elements with a
statistically signiﬁcant number of common interaction partners
share the same functional role according to the so-called guilt-by-
association principle (Quackenbush, 2003). The method sketched
in Figure 1 is based on the theoretical insights formulated in
Zweig and Kaufmann (2011) and uses a more realistic null
model than other existing approaches. The open source software
SI COP (signiﬁcant co-interaction patterns) implements the algo-
rithm as an easy-to-use client-side tool. It is able to detect sig-
niﬁcant mild co-interaction effects by taking into account up to
two different types of interactions.

2 SOFTWARE FEATURES

From interaction data between elements of two distinct types,
SICOP computes the signiﬁcance of the number of common
interaction partners for all pairs of elements of one of the two
types. The most important functionalities of SICOP are as
follows.

Data import from diverse input file formats. The tool accepts a
list of the observed interactions stored in a text ﬁle, a matrix
containing the measured level of all interactions in a csv ﬁle
(comma separated value) or a graph representation of the net-
work in a gml ﬁle (graph mark-up language) as produced by
graph editing programs such as yEd.

Simplex and duplex network support and precomputational edge
ﬁltering. Given the experimental data, SICOP ﬁrst constructs a
bipartite graph model (Fig. 1a and b). If the observed inter-
actions are assigned weights, the user may add a threshold to
ﬁlter them. If there are two types of interactions, the user can
treat them as a single type (simplex network data) or use both of
them (duplex network data).

Statistical significance assessment of co-interactions. SICOP
detects patterns in the bipartite graph that are non-random
when compared with a null model, which consists of a set of
random graphs generated through a series of permutations
(Gionis et al., 2007). During permutation, the following key
structural properties of the graph are maintained: the number
of elements and the number of different types of interactions per
element (Fig. 10). In duplex networks, it is possible to differen-
tiate between common interaction partners regarding all
combinations of the two interaction types. On the example of
up- and downregulation, the number of co-up-, co-down— and
antagonistically regulated partners is evaluated for all pairs of
elements. The statistical signiﬁcance of the individual co-regula—
tions is then quantiﬁed by a z—score or a P—value (Fig. 1d).

Multiple data export formats. The same edge selection options
are available when exporting the data as when importing it.
Thus, the user may create and store multiple networks with dif-
ferent threshold values corresponding to different P—values or
z—scores. The obtained co-regulation networks may be exported
in any of the input ﬁle formats or alternatively as Graphml.

High configurability. Besides the key functionalities described
earlier, SICOP allows more conﬁdent users to modify the
parameter values. The default values are based on theoretical
and empirical considerations and are automatically adjusted to
the size of the input data. Increasing the preset values enhances
accuracy but comes at the cost of additional computational time.
We refer interested readers to the manual provided with S1 COP.

3 DISCUSSION

The algorithm was applied to the data from high-throughput
screening experiments that show the effect of various
microRNAs on a set of proteins that are highly relevant in
breast cancer (Uhlmann et al., 2012). MicroRNAs have recently
been recognized to act as tumour suppressors and have an onco-
gene role. Uncovering their targeting patterns is difﬁcult because
they are known to only have a moderate effect on the protein

expression level. The extensive null model approach behind
SICOP enabled the identiﬁcation of key microRNAs that were
shown in subsequent experiments to inhibit cell-cycle progression
and proliferation. This speciﬁc result conﬁrms that the algorithm
behind SICOP is a powerful tool for the detection of statistically
signiﬁcant protein co-regulations. However, as described earlier,
SICOP can be applied to a wide range of datasets, for instance,
transcription factors binding to DNAs, gene-coding RNAs
interacting with co-transcriptional non-coding RNAs, genes in
relation with diseases or diseases and their symptoms. Our
ﬂexible tool offers an effortless way to explore such data to its
full potential, considerably reducing the required amount of
further experiments.

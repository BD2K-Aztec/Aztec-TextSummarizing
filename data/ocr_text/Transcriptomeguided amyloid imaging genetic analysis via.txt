ABSTRACT

Motivation: Imaging genetics is an emerging field that studies the
influence of genetic variation on brain structure and function. The
major task is to examine the association between genetic markers
such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and quantitative
traits (QTs) extracted from neuroimaging data. The complexity of
these datasets has presented critical bioinformatics challenges that
require new enabling tools. Sparse canonical correlation analysis
(SCCA) is a bi-multivariate technique used in imaging genetics to iden-
tify complex multi-SNP—multi-QT associations. However, most of the
existing SCCA algorithms are designed using the soft thresholding
method, which assumes that the input features are independent
from one another. This assumption clearly does not hold for the ima-
ging genetic data. In this article, we propose a new knowledge-guided
SCCA algorithm (KG-SCCA) to overcome this limitation as well as
improve learning results by incorporating valuable prior knowledge.
Results: The proposed KG-SCCA method is able to model two types
of prior knowledge: one as a group structure (e.g. linkage disequilib-
rium blocks among SNPs) and the other as a network structure (e.g.
gene co-expression network among brain regions). The new model
incorporates these prior structures by introducing new regularization
terms to encourage weight similarity between grouped or connected
features. A new algorithm is designed to solve the KG-SCCA model
without imposing the independence constraint on the input features.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm with both synthetic
and real data. For real data, using an Alzheimer’s disease (AD) cohort,
we examine the imaging genetic associations between all SNPs in the
APOE gene (i.e. top AD gene) and amyloid deposition measures
among cortical regions (Le. a major AD hallmark). In comparison
with a widely used SCCA implementation, our KG-SCCA algorithm
produces not only improved cross-validation performances but also
biologically meaningful results.

1 INTRODUCTION

Brain imaging genetics is an emerging ﬁeld that studies the
inﬂuence of genetic variation on brain structure and function.
Its major task is to examine the association between genetic
markers such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and

quantitative traits (QTs) extracted from multimodal neuroima-
ging data (e.g. anatomical, functional and molecular imaging
scans). Given the well-known importance of gene and imaging
phenotype in brain function, bridging these two factors and
exploring their connections would lead to a better mechanistic
understanding of normal or disordered brain functions. The
complexity of these data, however, has presented critical bio-
informatics challenges requiring new enabling tools. Early stu-
dies in imaging genetics typically focused on pairwise univariate
analysis (Shen et al., 2010). Many recent studies turned to regres-
sion analysis for exploring the joint effect of multiple SNPs on
single or few QTs (Hibar et al., 2011) and bi-multivariate ana-
lyses for revealing complex multi-SNPs—multi-QTs associations
(Chi et al., 2013; Lin et al., 2014; Vounou et al., 2010; Wan et al.,
2011).

Canonical correlation analysis (CCA), a bi-multivariate
method, has been applied to imaging genetics applications. It
aims to find the best linear transformation for imaging and gen-
etics features so that the highest correlation between imaging and
genetic components can be achieved. Based on the assumption
that a real imaging genetic signal typically involves a small
number of SNPs and QTs, sparse canonical correlation analysis
(SCCA) has also been applied in several imaging genetic studies
by imposing the Lasso regularization term to yield sparse results
(Chi et al., 2013; Lin et al., 2014; Wan et al., 2011). However,
most existing SCCA algorithms are designed using the soft
thresholding technique, which assumes that the input features
are independent from one another (Tibshirani, 1996). This as-
sumption clearly does not hold for the imaging genetic data [e. g.
the existence of the structural and functional networks in the
brain and the linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks in the genome].
Directly ignoring the covariance structure in the data will inev-
itably limit the capability of yielding optimal results.

In this article, we propose a new knowledge-guided SCCA
algorithm (KG-SCCA) to overcome this limitation as well as
to aim for improving learning results by incorporating valuable
prior knowledge. The proposed KG—SCCA method is able to
model two types of prior knowledge: one as a group structure
(e.g. LD blocks among SNPs) and the other as a network struc-
ture (e. g. gene co-expression network among brain regions). The
new model incorporates these prior structures by introducing
new regularization terms to encourage similarity between
grouped or connected features. A new algorithm is designed to
solve the KG—SCCA model without imposing the independence

constraint on the input features. We demonstrate the effective-
ness of our algorithm with both synthetic and real data. For real
data, using an Alzheimer’s disease (AD) cohort, we examine the
imaging genetic associations between all SNPs in the APOE gene
(i.e. top AD gene) and amyloid deposition measures among cor-
tical regions (i.e. a major AD hallmark). In comparison with a
widely used SCCA implementation in the PMA software pack-
age (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/PMA/) (W itten et al.,
2009), our KG—SCCA algorithm produces improved cross-
validation performances as well as biologically meaningful results.

2 MATERIALS AND DATA SOURCES

To demonstrate the proposed KG—SCCA algorithm, we apply it
to an amyloid imaging genetic analysis in the study of AD.
Deposition of amyloid-,8 in the cerebral cortex is a major hall-
mark in AD pathogenesis. Our prior studies (Ramanan et al.,
2014; Swaminathan et al., 2012) performed univariate genetic
association analyses of amyloid measures in a few candidate cor-
tical regions of interest (ROIs), and identiﬁed several promising
hits including rs429358 in APOE, rs509208 in BCHE and
rs7551288 in DHCR24. In this work, using the proposed KG-
SCCA algorithm, we perform a bi—multivariate analysis to exam-
ine the association between all the available SNPs (58 in total) in
the APOE gene (i.e. the top genetic risk factor for late onset AD)
and 78 ROIs across the entire cortex. We use two types of prior
knowledge in this analysis: (i) a group structure is imposed to the
SNP data using the LD block information (Fig. 4), and (ii) a
network structure is imposed to the amyloid imaging data by
computing an amyloid pathway-based gene co-expression net-
work in the brain using Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA;
Zeng et al., 2012). Below, we first describe our amyloid imaging
and genotyping data, and then discuss our method for creating
the amyloid pathway-based gene co-expression network in the
brain.

2.1 Imaging and genotyping data

The proposed algorithm, KG—SCCA, was empirically evaluated
using the amyloid imaging and genotyping data obtained from
the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data-
base (adni.loni.usc.edu). One goal of ADNI has been to test
whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron
emission tomography (PET), other biological markers and clin-
ical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to
measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
and early AD. For up-to-date information, see www.adni-info.
org. Preprocessed [18F]Florbetapir PET scans (i.e. amyloid ima-
ging data) were downloaded from LONI (adni.loni.usc.edu).
Before downloading, images were averaged, aligned to a stand-
ard space, resampled to a standard image and voxel size,
smoothed to a uniform resolution and normalized to a cerebellar
gray matter reference region resulting in standardized uptake
value ratio images as previously described (Jagust et al., 2010).
After downloading, the images were aligned to each participant’s
same visit MRI scan and normalized to the Montreal
Neurological Institute (MNI) space as 2 x 2 x 2mm voxels
using parameters from the MRI segmentation. ROI level amyl-
oid measurements were further extracted based on the MarsBaR

AAL atlas. Genotype data of both ADNI-l and ADNI-2/GO
phases were also obtained from LONI (adni.loni.usc.edu). All
the APOE SNPs were extracted based on the quality controlled
and imputed data combining two phases together. Only SNPs
available in Illumina 610Quad and/or OmniExpress arrays were
included in the analysis. As a result, we had 58 SNPs located
within 10 LD blocks (Fig. 4) computed using HaploView
(Barrett, 2009). A total of 568 non-Hispanic Caucasian partici-
pants with both complete amyloid measurements and APOE
SNPs were studied, including 28 AD, 343 MCI and 196 healthy
control (HC) subjects (Table 1). Using the regression weights
derived from the HC participants, amyloid and SNP measures
were preadjusted for removing the effects of the baseline age,
gender, education and handedness.

2.2 Amyloid pathway-based gene co-expression network
in the brain

Because we examine cortical amyloid deposition in relation to
genetic variation, we hypothesize that amyloid pathway-based
gene co-expression profiles among cortical ROIs may provide
valuable information in search for APOE-related amyloid dis-
tribution pattern in the cortex. Thus, we used the brain tran-
scriptome data from the AHBA (Zeng et al., 2012), coupled
with 15 candidate genes from amyloid pathways studied in
(Swaminathan et al., 2012), to create such a brain network.

Gene expression profiles across the whole human brain were
downloaded from Allen Institute for Brain Science. One of their
goals is to advance the research and knowledge about neurobio-
logical conditions, with extensive mapping of whole-genome
gene expression throughout the brain. Among various organ-
isms, AHBA is one of the projects seeking to combine the gen-
omics with the neuroanatomy to better understand the
connection between genes and brain functioning. Gene expres-
sion profiles in eight health human brains have been released,
including two full brains and six right hemispheres. Details can
be found in www.brain—map.org.

Brain-wide expression data of all 15 amyloid-related candidate
genes, reported in (Swaminathan et al., 2012), were extracted
from AHBA to construct the brain network. Because an early
report indicated that individuals share as much as 95% gene
expression profile (Zeng et al., 2012), in this study, we only
included two full brains (H0351-2201 and H0351-2002) to con-
struct the co-expression network. First all the brain samples
(~900) in AHBA were mapped to MarSBAR AAL atlas,
which included 116 brain ROIs. According to Ramanan et a].
(2014), cortical ROIs are typically believed to hold the amyloid

different rows) for two individuals and their combination

signals, whereas other ROIs hold similar amyloid measures across
individuals. Thus, 39 pairs of bilateral cortical ROIs (78 in total),
from frontal lobe, cingulate, parietal lobe, temporal lobe, occipital
lobe, insula and sensory—motor cortex, were included in our ana-
lysis. Correlation among ~900 brain locations was ﬁrst calculated
based on the gene expression proﬁle of 15 amyloid candidate
genes. Due to many-to-one mapping from the brain locations to
AAL ROIs, for each ROI, there are more than one connections,
represented by correlations between two brain locations.
Therefore, we calculated ROI-level correlations of two individuals
in ﬁve ways: minimum, maximum, mean, standard deviation and
median. In addition, the ROI correlation structure based on the
combination of both individuals was also generated in the same
way for comparison (Fig. 1). Clearly, for all ﬁve statistics, the
pattern remains highly consistent across individuals and their
combination. For simplicity, in the subsequent analysis, we
adopt the brain connectivity matrix generated from the combin-
ation sample using the median statistics (i.e. the panel in the lower
right corner of Fig. 1). Figure 2 shows a network visualization of
this matrix, where edges correspond to matrix entries with values
2 0.5 or g —0.5.

CCA seeks linear transformations of variables X and Y to achieve the
maximal correlation between Xu and YV, which can be formulated as:

max uTxTYv s1. uTxTxu= 1, vTYTYv=1 (1)
where u and v are canonical loadings or weights, reﬂecting the signiﬁcance
of each feature in the identiﬁed canonical correlation.

Similar to many machine learning algorithms, overﬁtting could arise
in CCA when the features outnumber the participants. In addition, the
CCA outcome could spread non-trivial effects across all the features
rather than only a few signiﬁcant ones, making the results difﬁcult to
interpret. To address these issues, SCCA was proposed in (Witten et al.,
2009) by introducing penalty terms, P1(u) 5 c1 and P2(v) 5 62, to regu-
larize the weights, as shown in Equation (2).

Here the objective function is bilinear in u and v: when u is ﬁxed, it is
linear in v and vice versa. But due to the L2 equality, with u or v ﬁxed, the
constraints are not convex. This can be solved by reformulating the L2
equality into inequality as ||Xu||§ 5 l and ||Yv||§ 5 1. For easy compu-
tation, Equation (2) is commonly rewritten in its Lagrangian form.

Transcriptome-Guided Amyloid Imaging Genetics via KG-SCCA

 

Lasso penalty promotes the smoothness of weight vectors and encourages
neighboring features to be selected together. To incorporate other struc-
tures, group- and network-guided penalties were introduced (Chen and
Liu, 2012; Chen et al., 2013). As mentioned earlier, most of these methods
were designed using the soft thresholding technique, which was ﬁrst pro-
posed to solve Lasso problem when the features were independent from
each other (Tibshirani, 1996). This condition does not hold in imaging
genetics data. Thus, direct application of those methods into imaging
genetics studies limits the capability of yielding optimal solutions.
Below, we ﬁrst present our KG-SCCA model and then present an effect-
ive KG-SCCA algorithm without using the soft thresholding strategy.

Brain has been studied as a complicated network. The SNP data have
structures like LD blocks. Given these prior knowledge, we propose the
following KG—SCCA model by introducing two penalty terms for genetic
loadings u and imaging loading v, respectively.

In penalty P1 (u), SNPs are partitioned into K1 groups H1 = {arkl},1;1=1,
such that {ui}::kll 6 711,1, and mk1 is the number of SNPs in 711,1. While the

K1
group term ,81 2 Ha"1 ||2 helps select all the SNPs in relevant LD blocks,
k1 =1
L1 penalty manages to suppress those non-signals within selected LD
blocks. The P1(u) penalty is essentially the group Lasso penalty applied
to the CCA framework.

Penalty P2(v) applies the network-guided constraint to encourage the
joint selection of ‘connected’ features (i.e. their connectivity matrix entry
having a high weight) as well as uses L1 to impose global sparsity. E is
the set of all possible imaging QT pairs and |E| is the total number of
QT pairs. C e ERIE'X" is deﬁned as follows. The row of C is indexed
by all pairs (i,j) e {(i,j)|i e {1, ..., q},j e {1, ...q}, i<j}, C(j,j),i:Wl'j and
C(21)]- : Sign(W[j)Wjj. T(Wij) provide the fusion effect that promotes similarity
between v,- and vj of related features. In this article, we use r(w,-j) =  With
Sign(w,-j) we can have positively related features being pulled together and
on the other hand the negatively related features being fused with opposite
direction. Thus, for strongly connected features with a large fusion effect,
they tend to be jointly selected or jointly not selected.

In this work, as mentioned earlier, we formed the group structure for
the SNP data by partitioning them using LD blocks generated by
HaploView (Barrett, 2009). We formed the network structure for the
amyloid imaging data by constructing amyloid pathway-based gene co-
expression network using AHBA. Because the model could be easily ex-
tended to estimate multiple canonical variables, we only focus on creating
the ﬁrst pair of canonical variables in this article.

We now present our algorithm to solve this model without using soft
thresholding approach. By ﬁxing u and v, respectively, we will have two
convex problems shown in Equation (5).

Here, while u can be solved by the G-SMuRFS method proposed in
(Wang et al., 2012), optimization of v can be achieved by the network-
guided L21 regression method proposed in (Yan et al., 2013). In both
solutions, a smooth approximation has been estimated for group L21 and
L1 terms by including an extremely small value. The solution for u and v
in each iteration step is as follows:

diagonal element as  Algorithm 1 summarizes the KG—SCCA opti-
mization procedure. Further details on how to solve for two objectives in
Equation (6) are available in (Wang et al., 2012) and (Yan et al., 2013),
respectively.

In Algorithm 1, six parameters y1, y2, ,81, ,82, 61, 62 need to be tuned
to control the global sparsity as well as structured group or network con-
straints. Chen and Liu (2012) studied a similar problem using a different
method, and found that their results were insensitive to y1, y2 settings.
Following their observation, we set yl and y2 to 1 for simplicity. Nested
cross-validation can be used for parameter selection but will be extremely
time-consuming for the remaining four parameters. Thus, we followed the
strategy proposed in (Lin et al., 2014): parameters ,81, ,82 controlling struc-
tural constraints were ﬁrst tuned without considering sparsity constraints.
Then based on the obtained optimal ,81, ,82, another nested cross-valid-
ation was performed to acquire the optimal 61, 62.

in the PMA package (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/
PMA/) (Witten et al., 2009). For PMA experiments, the SCCA
parameters were automatically tuned using a permutation
scheme provided in PMA. Below we report our empirical results
using both synthetic data and real imaging genetics data.

4.1 Results on simulation data

Because it was not straightforward to manually construct a
dataset with a network structure, we simulated group structures
for both datasets and then converted them into network struc-
tures for one dataset by connecting all the pairs within each
group. Synthetic data (n=200, p=200, q= 150) with diagonal
block structure was generated with the following procedure: (i)
Random positive deﬁnite covariance matrix M with non-over-
lapping group structure was created, where correlations range
from 0.6 to 1 within group and are set to 0 between groups.
(ii) Dataset X with covariance structure M was calculated
through Cholesky decomposition. (iii) Repeat Steps 1 and 2 to
generate another dataset Y. (iv) With assigned canonical loadings
of X, we calculated the ﬁrst component Xu. (v) Given a desired
correlation between components, we calculated the second com-
ponent Yv. (vi) For simplicity, in this article, only one group in Y

was assigned to have signals. Therefore, based on predeﬁned
canonical loadings of Y and component YV, ﬁnal obtained
group signals, added with some white noises (Signal to Noise
Ratio (SNR) = 0.5), will replace the data in original dataset Y.
By repeating this procedure we generated seven datasets with
correlation levels from 0.6 to l. The canonical loadings and
group structure remained the same across all the datasets.
KG—SCCA and PMA have been both tested on all seven data-
sets. All the regularization parameters were optimally tuned
using a grid search from 10‘2 to 102 through nested 5-fold
cross-validation, as mentioned before. The true and estimated
canonical loadings for both X and Y were shown in Figure 3.
Owing to the difference in normalization and optimization pro-
cedure, the weights yielded by KG—SCCA and PMA showed
different scales. Yet, the overall proﬁle of the estimated u and
v values from KG—SCCA kept consistent with the ground truth
across the entire range of tested correlation strengths (from 0.6 to
1.0), whereas PMA was only capable of identifying an incom-
plete portion of all the signals. Furthermore, we also examined
the correlation in the test set computed using the learned models
from the training data for both methods. The left part of Table 2
demonstrated that KG—SCCA outperformed PMA consistently

and signiﬁcantly, and it could accurately reveal the embedded
true correlation even in the test data. The right part of Table 2
demonstrated the sensitivity and speciﬁcity performance using
area under ROC (AUC), where KG—SCCA also signiﬁcantly
outperformed PMA no matter whether the correlation was
weak or strong in 11. Because v is relatively simple structured,
both KG—SCCA and PMA can restore the signals without any
loss. From the above results, it is also observed that KG—SCCA
could identify the correlations and signal locations not only more
accurately but also more stably.

4.2 Results on real imaging genetic data

Both KG—SCCA and PMA have been performed on real amyloid
imaging and APOE genetics data. Similar to previous analysis,
5-fold nested cross-validation was applied to optimally tune the
parameters. Five experiments were performed with ﬁve different
partitions to eliminate the bias. For each single experiment, the
same partition was used for both KG—SCCA and PMA. Table 3
shows both the training and test performances of KG—SCCA and
PMA in all ﬁve folds of ﬁve experiments. Both methods demon-
strated stable results across ﬁve trials. KG—SCCA was observed
to outperform the PMA in every single experiment on both
training and test performance. Paired t-test was performed to
compare the performance across ﬁve experiments, and KG-
SCCA outperformed PMA signiﬁcantly in both training
(P = 3.08E-6) and test cases (P = 8.07E-5). We also tested two
simpliﬁed KG—SCCA models: one with only the penalty term for
the LD structure and the other with only the penalty term for the
network structure. Interestingly, both performed similarly to the
original KG—SCCA, and signiﬁcantly outperformed PMA.
Figure 4 demonstrates the canonical loadings trained from
5-fold cross-validation in one experiment, suggesting relevant
genetic (top panel) and imaging (bottom panel) markers.
Although LD block constraints were imposed on relevant SNP
markers, L1 penalty managed to exclude irrelevant signals. Only
APOE e4 SNP (rs429358) was identiﬁed to be associated with
amyloid accumulations in the brain. PMA also achieved a similar

pattern as KG-SCCA, but including a few additional SNPs from
multiple LD blocks. The bottom panel of Figure 4 shows the
canonical loading for the imaging data. Both methods identiﬁed
similar imaging patterns, which are in accordance with prior
ﬁndings (Ramanan et al., 2014). Figure 5 shows a brain map
of canonical loadings generated by KG—SCCA.

5 CONCLUSIONS

We have performed a brain imaging genetics study to explore the
relationship between brain-wide amyloid accumulation and gen-
etic variations in the APOE gene. Because most existing SCCA
algorithms are designed using the soft thresholding technique,
which assumes independence among data features, direct appli-
cation of these methods into brain imaging genetics study cannot
yield optimal results owing to the correlated imaging and genetic
features. We have proposed a novel KG—SCCA algorithm, which
not only removes the above independence assumption, but also
can model both the group-like and network-like prior knowledge
in the data to produce improved learning results. A comparative
study has been performed between KG—SCCA and PMA (a
widely used SCCA implementation) on both synthetic and real
data. The promising empirical results demonstrated that KG-
SCCA signiﬁcantly outperformed PMA in both cases.
Furthermore, KG—SCCA could accurately recover the true sig-
nals from the synthetic data, as well as yield improved canonical
correlation performances and biologically meaningful ﬁndings
from real data. This study is an initial attempt to remove the
feature independence assumption many existing SCCA methods
have. The empirical studies designed here are targeted to identify
relatively clean and simple multi-SNP—multi-QT correlations.
Given only 58 SNPs analyzed here, this work is not a demon-
stration of a genome-wide analysis. Comparison with other com-
plex SCCA models, building scalable KG-SCCA models, and
applications to more complex imaging genetic tasks warrant fur-
ther investigation.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Data from metagenomics projects remain largely un-
tapped for the analysis of transcriptional regulatory networks. Here,
we provide proof-of-concept that metagenomic data can be effect-
ively leveraged to analyze regulatory networks by characterizing the
SOS meta-regulon in the human gut microbiome.

Results: We combine well-established in silico and in vitro techniques
to mine the human gut microbiome data and determine the relative
composition of the SOS network in a natural setting. Our analysis
highlights the importance of translesion synthesis as a primary func-
tion of the SOS response. We predict the association of this network
with three novel protein clusters involved in cell wall biogenesis,
chromosome partitioning and restriction modification, and we confirm
binding of the SOS response transcriptional repressor to sites in the
promoter of a cell wall biogenesis enzyme, a phage integrase and a
death-on-curing protein. We discuss the implications of these findings
and the potential for this approach for metagenome analysis.

1 INTRODUCTION

The unprecedented coverage provided by next-generation
sequencing technologies has enabled direct sequencing of hetero-
geneous bacterial populations in their natural habitat.
Metagenomics projects, therefore, offer a unique window into
the genetic composition of microbial ecosystems (Riesenfeld
et al., 2004). To date, a substantial amount of work has focused
on pathway analysis as a method to analyze and compare meta-
genomic populations (De Filippo et al., 2012). This approach is
particularly suited for reconstructing the multispecies genetic or-
ganization of metabolic pathways across a metagenome
(Abubucker et al., 2012; Nelson et al., 2010). In contrast, non-
metabolic transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs), such as
stress responses, present a different challenge. These networks
are typically defined by the functional regulation of their com-
ponents, rather than by their biochemical interconnections, and
their genetic composition can vary significantly across bacteria

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

(Cornish et al., 2012; Erill et al., 2007; Lozada-Chavez et al.,
2008; Rodionov et al., 2005). Hence, the mere presence of a
particular gene or set of genes within a metagenomic sample
does not imply their belonging to a given TRN or the existence
of such a network in the sample. Membership to a TRN can be
instead deﬁned by the ability of a regulating transcription factor
to bind upstream of and directly regulate an operon (Ptashne
and Alexander, 2002). In well-studied bacterial transcription fac-
tors, the binding motif is known to be conserved at the class or
phylum levels (Gorbunov et al., 2010; Kotelnikova et al., 2005;
McGuire et al., 2000). If the binding motif for the regulating
transcription factor is known and can be shown to be conserved
for a given subset of the sampled taxa, it is hence theoretically
possible to reconstruct its associated composite TRN, or meta-
network, at the metagenome level by analyzing sequence data
from metagenomic projects. Conservation of the binding motif
can be assessed through comparative genomics analyses, which
can also be used to validate robust multispecies scoring matrices
that are well suited for metagenomic analyses (Cornish et al.,
2012). The analysis of regulatory networks at the metagenome
level presents several potential advantages over genomic ana-
lyses. First, it leverages a large and increasing amount of data
for regulatory network analysis. Second, it complements a
genome-centered perspective by providing a glimpse of the regu-
latory network organization in its natural environment. Finally,
it can capture the contribution of uncultured organisms and
mobile genetic elements that are poorly represented in genomic
data. Here, we explore this approach by analyzing the compos-
ition of the bacterial SOS regulon in the human gut microbiome
through in silico and in vitro analyses, providing proof-of—con—
cept for the use of metagenomic data in the inference of regula-
tory meta-networks.

The SOS response presents several properties that make it a
suitable target to validate this type of analysis. It is a well-
studied, widespread and relatively large network (~40 genes in
Escherichia coli) aimed primarily at addressing DNA damage
through the activation of repair enzymes, translesion synthesis
polymerases and cell division inhibitors (Fernandez De
Henestrosa et al., 2000; Wade et al., 2005). It is also of clinical
relevance due to its implication in virulence, mutagenesis and
dissemination of antibiotic resistance through the activation
of mobile genetic elements (Abella et al., 2007; Kelley, 2006;
Wade et al., 2005). In addition, it is governed by a repressor
(LexA) with a remarkably different distribution in the
two clades that constitute Bacteroidetes, but it targets a

well-deﬁned binding motif in the Firmicutes (Erill et al., 2007;
Segata et al., 2012).

2 METHODS

2.1 Metagenome and genome data

Metagenome data were obtained from the MetaHit project (Qin et al.,
2010). Only records from 86 healthy patients were used for analysis. A
library of 122 gut microbiome complete genomes was compiled as refer-
ence for BLAST analysis and subsequent taxonomic typing (Qin et al.,
2010).

2.2 Identiﬁcation of putative LexA-binding sites

A multispecies collection of experimentally validated Gram-positive LexA-
binding sites and a reference set of LexA-regulated clusters of orthologous
genes (COGS) across the bacteria domain were derived from the published
literature (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). Putative LexA-binding sites
were located by scoring all metagenome sequences on both strands using
the R,- index as implemented in FITOM (Erill and O’Neill, 2009;
Schneider, 1997). Only putative sites with scores >l.5 standard deviations
below the mean of the original collection (>836 bits) were considered for
further analysis. Promoter regions were deﬁned as spanning from —300 to
+50 bp of the translational start site of a predicted protein-coding gene
(McGuire et al., 2000; Rodionov et al., 2004; Sanchez-Alberola et al.,
2012). Predicted protein-coding genes in the same orientation and with
an intergenic distance <100 bp were considered to constitute an operon.
All identiﬁed LexA-binding sites were associated with the predicted pro-
tein-coding gene in the metagenome sequence whose translational start site
was closest to the LexA-binding site.

2.3 Functional annotation and taxonomic ﬁltering

Predicted protein-coding genes and their COG annotations were obtained
from the MetaHit gene dataset (Qin et al., 2010). Protein-coding genes
were functionally annotated using BLASTP against a database of 122 gut
microbiome complete genomes with an E—value threshold of 10—10 on the
UMBC High Performance Computing Facility. The predicted protein
function and full taxonomic information for the best BLAST hit asso-
ciated with each gene was obtained from the NCBI Protein and
Taxonomy databases, respectively. Phylum-level taxonomic information
was used to ﬁlter identiﬁed sites by excluding all sites not associated with
protein-coding genes assigned to the Firmicutes or the Actinobacteria.
Site and gene data were integrated in a mySQL database and interrogated
with custom Structured Query Language (SQL) queries.

2.4 Identiﬁcation of prototypical SOS COGS

For all COGS reported in the MetaHit data, the cumulative distribution
of site R,- ScoreS was computed by counting the number of ﬁltered puta-
tive LexA-binding sites (Supplementary Table S3) above a given score
threshold, using lbit intervals in the l2—20 bit score range. Prototypical
SOS COGS were deﬁned as those having a regression coefﬁcient of de-
termination (RZ) >0.85 in the l2—20 bit range, at least one Site with score
above the mean (16 bits) and a minimum of 10 Sites in the 12—20 bit
range. The R2 cutoff value of 0.85 was set Simply by ranking COGS
according to R2 value and gradually decreasing the R2 threshold until
the inclusion of additional COGS corresponding to known SOS genes
(Supplementary Table S2) incurred the inclusion of a larger number of
COGS not known to be associated with SOS genes.

2.5 In vitro validation of LexA-binding sites

The Bacillus subtilis lexA gene was overexpressed in a pETle vector
provided by Dr J ordi Barbe. The B.Subtilis LexA protein was puriﬁed

as described previously (Guerin et al., 2009). DNA probes were con-
structed using two complementary 6l-bp synthetic oligonucleotides
(Supplementary Table S4). Electrophoretic mobility Shift assays
(EMSA) experiments were performed as reported previously (Sanchez-
Alberola et al., 2012), using 40 nM of B.Subtilis LexA and 20 ng of each
Digoxigenin—marked DNA probe in the binding mixture. For EMSA
competitive assays (Supplementary Fig. S1), 200-fold of either Speciﬁc
or non-Speciﬁc non-labeled DNA was added to the binding mixture. In
all cases, samples were loaded in 6% non-denaturing Tris-glycine poly-
acrylamide gel. Digoxigenin-labeled DNA-protein complexes were de-
tected following the manufacturer’s protocol (Roche).

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 Identiﬁcation of LexA-binding sites in human gut
microbiome metagenomic data

We used a position-speciﬁc scoring matrix derived from a
multispecies Gram-positive bacteria motifs (Fig. 1A; Supplemen-
tary Table S1) to search the combined 7.1 Gbp sequence of the
human gut metagenome of 86 healthy individuals (Qin et al.,
2010; Cornish et al., 2012). This led to the identiﬁcation of
more than half a million putative LexA-binding sites. As ex-
pected, average site scores were signiﬁcantly higher in putative
promoter regions (Supplementary Fig. S2). We ﬁltered the initial
results by requiring that putative LexA-binding sites be located
in such upstream regions (—350 to +50 of predicted translational
start site) and that their associated genes mapped to Gram-
positive bacteria. This two-pronged ﬁltering step resulted in a
ﬁnal count of >40 000 sites associated with >38 000 genes with
products assigned to COGS (Supplementary Table S3). We vali-
dated this approach by analyzing the distribution of gene counts
per COG category as a function of the score threshold (Fig. 1B;
Supplementary Fig. S3) and comparing it with a reference en-
semble of 18 known SOS regulons (Supplementary Table S2).
The ﬁt of the inferred network with the reference ensemble im-
proves with increasing score threshold, leading to a progressive
enrichment of all canonical SOS categories [repair/replication
(L), signal transduction (T) and transcription (K)] except for
cell cycle control (D). This canonical SOS category (Supplemen-
tary Table S5) is not enriched because SOS-regulated cell division
inhibitors in Gram-positive bacteria were described after the cre-
ation of the COG database and their associated COGS are as-
signed to several different categories (Chauhan et al., 2006;
Kawai et al., 2003; Ogino et al., 2008; Tatusov et al., 2000).

3.2 Functional analysis of the prototypical human gut
SOS regulon

An interesting property of the use of metagenomic data to ana-
lyze TRNs is that it can provide an estimate of the relative gene
composition of the TRN in its natural environment. We ana-
lyzed the gene composition of the human gut SOS meta-regulon
contributed by Gram-positive bacteria by assessing the relative
number of site counts per COG as a function of site score. As
expected, COGS mapping to known SOS genes are enriched in
high-scoring sites, capturing roughly half of the sites with scores
>16 bits (~200) in promoter regions. This trend is not seen out-
side promoter regions, where the percentage of high-scoring sites
(>16 bits) for COGS mapping to known SOS genes is similar to

The B.subtilis recA promoter (leftmost experiment) was used as a positive control

that observed for all COGS (~0.5%). To accurately identify
prototypical SOS COGS, we ﬁrst analyzed LexA-binding sites
upstream of canonical SOS genes (lexA and recA) drawn from
genomic sequences. For these reference genes, LexA-binding site
scores follow a normal distribution with a mean of ~16.2 bits
(Supplementary Fig. S4). In its central range (l2—20 bits), the
cumulative distribution can be ﬁt by a linear model, providing
a simple means to deﬁne prototypical SOS COGS on the
MetaHit data. Data for other well-known transcriptional regu-
lators suggest that this is a general property of TF-binding site
distributions upstream of regulated genes (Supplementary
Fig. S5). We used the coefﬁcient of determination (R2) of the
linear regression for the cumulative distribution of site scores on
each COG, together with the presence of at least one high-scor-
ing site, as an indicator of the likelihood of a COG being a
prototypical member of the SOS regulon. Using these criteria
and a conservative cutoff, we identiﬁed 12 putative SOS COGS
(Fig. 1C). Nine of these COGS correspond to well-established
SOS genes, such as lexA and umuD (COG1974) or the excision
repair helicase uvrB (COG0556). The remaining three are pro-
mising candidate additions to the SOS regulatory network.
COG0732 maps to Hst, a type I restriction endonuclease
linked to virulence in Streptococcus suis (Li et al., 2010).
COG2001 is deﬁned by the cell division protein MraZ, known

to be involved in cell wall biogenesis and induced by antibiotic
stress in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Bagge et al., 2004), and
COG4974 maps to the B.subtilis CodV protein, a site-speciﬁc
recombinase involved in chromosome partitioning (Sciochetti
et al., 2001). By relaxing the R2-cutoff, we identiﬁed several add-
itional COGS linking the SOS network to cell wall biosynthesis
and export processes potentially involved in virulence
(Supplementary Table S6). COG0399, for instance, is linked
with the biosynthesis of a phase-variable 0 antigen and the extra-
cellular matrix of Vibrio cholerae (Rashid et al., 2003; Seed et al.,
2012), whereas COGll36 is involved in antimicrobial peptide
transport systems that have been linked to virulence in multiple
species (Matthysse et al., 1996; Pethe et al., 2004; Pietiainen et al.,
2009). The number of sites associated with each COG (Fig. 1D)
reveals that the composite gut microbiome SOS regulon is domi-
nated by four molecular functions: transcriptional repression
(lexA), sensing of DNA-damage and stabilization of DNA
(recA), translesion synthesis (umuD, dinB, Liva and imuB) and
excision repair (uvrB, Lier and uvrA). In agreement with the
experimental evidence uncovered in different phyla (Erill et al.,
2007), the comparatively large number of sites associated with
error-prone polymerases highlights the importance of translesion
synthesis as a primary component of the SOS response, aimed at
guaranteeing the completion of chromosome replication in

response to DNA damage. Previous work has analyzed the com-
position of the SOS response in Gram-positive bacteria through
comparative genomics, recognizing cell division inhibition, but
not translesion synthesis, as a key component of this system
(Cornish et al., 2012). Furthermore, none of the additional
SOS COGS reported here was identiﬁed in the comparative gen-
omics analysis. This illustrates how the environment-speciﬁc en-
richment of functional groups in metagenomics data can enhance
regulon analysis, complementing conventional analyses with
population-based estimates of functional importance.

3.3 In vitro validation of selected binding sites

A further asset of leveraging metagenomics for TRN analysis is
the ability to identify regulatory targets in uncultured organisms
and mobile genetic elements that may be underrepresented in
genomic data. We selected three high-scoring putative LexA-
binding sites for in vitro analysis to conﬁrm in silica results and
to explore putative novel additions to the SOS network: an
MraZ homolog (mraZ), a phage integrase (intP) and a death-
on—curing protein (rhuM) (Supplementary Table S4). We vali-
dated binding to these sites through EMSA using puriﬁed
B.subtilis LexA protein (Fig. 1E; Supplementary Fig. S1). Our
results conﬁrm that these LexA-binding sites are bound by LexA
in vitro, suggesting that they are functional sites in viva regulating
the activity of their associated genes. The potential regulation of
the cell division protein MraZ by the SOS response coincides
with recent reports of distinct cell division regulators under con-
trol of LexA in Gram-positive bacteria and gives credence to the
idea that the link between the SOS response and control of cell
division may have evolved multiple times in this clade (Cornish
et al., 2012; Ogino et al., 2008). Similarly, the presence of a func-
tional LexA-binding site upstream of a XerD-type phage inte-
grase suggests that the reported induction of integron integrases
by the SOS response may also extend to some phage integrases
(Guerin et al., 2009). Finally, the putative SOS regulation of a
death-on-curing protein is in agreement with and extends recent
reports on the regulation of toxin-antitoxin systems by the SOS
response in E.cali, which have important clinical implications
due to their association with persister phenotypes (Dorr et al.,
2009; Singletary et al., 2009; Wagner and Unoson, 2012).

4 CONCLUSIONS

In this work, we provide proof-of—concept that metagenomic
data can be effectively leveraged to study TRNs by analyzing
the SOS meta-regulon contributed by Gram-positive bacteria in
the human gut microbiome. The use of metagenomic data in
conjunction with a known conserved regulatory motif and
in vitro techniques allows us to interrogate this regulatory net-
work in its natural setting. Our analysis allows us to deﬁne the
core components of the human gut SOS meta-regulon, revealing
a substantial presence of error-prone polymerases, and identiﬁes
putative novel SOS members involved in control of cell division,
virulence and mobile genetic element dissemination. The meth-
odology introduced here is not constrained by regulon size or
motif information content and can be applied to other metage-
nomic datasets and transcription factors meeting two basic cri-
teria: a well-deﬁned binding motif and experimental or in silica

evidence of its conservation among the taxa of interest. This
provides the means to exploit metagenomic data to enhance
regulatory network inference.

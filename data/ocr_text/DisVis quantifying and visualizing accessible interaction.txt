Abstract

Summary: We present DisVis, a Python package and command line tool to calculate the reduced
accessible interaction space of distance—restrained binary protein complexes, allowing for direct
visualization and quantification of the information content of the distance restraints. The approach
is general and can also be used as a knowledge—based distance energy term in FFT—based docking

directly during the sampling stage.

1 Introduction

Structural characterization of protein complexes is of paramount
importance for a fundamental understanding of cellular processes,
and with major applications in rational drug design. As the quantity
of experimentally determined complexes is only a fraction of their
total predicted number, complementary computational techniques
have been developed for predicting the structure of complexes from
their components (Petrey and Honig, 2014; Rodrigues and Bonvin,
2014). Additional low-resolution information in the form of dis-
tance restraints can significantly benefit the modeling, with a variety
of experimental methods providing such information, such as chem—
ical cross—links detected by mass spectrometry (MS) (Rappsilber,
2011), and distance measurements from electron paramagnetic res—
onance (EPR) and FRET (Kalinin et 61]., 2012).

When two biomolecules are known to interact and no high-
resolution model is available, the structure of the complex
can naively be any one state where the molecules are in contact. We
define the accessible interaction space of the complex as the set of
all these states. If a distance restraint is imposed on the complex,
the accessible interaction space reduces, depending on the
information content of the restraint. The interaction space is

further reduced if multiple restraints are included. So far, how—
ever, no computational method has been reported that
quantifies this reduction or allows to visualize this accessible inter—
action space.

To aid in this task, we have developed DisVis, a GPU—accelerated
Python software package and command line tool (disz/is) for quan—
tifying and visualizing the accessible interaction space of distance—
restrained binary complexes. Disz/is takes as input two atomic
structures and a file with distance restraints, and outputs the sum of
complexes complying with a given number of restraints together
with a density showing the maximum number of consistent re—
straints at every position in space. This indicates whether all data
are consistent and can be combined without violations, and allows
identification of false positives, quantification of the information
content of the restraints and visualization of interesting regions in
the interaction space. The method is generic and can easily be incor—
porated into existing Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)—accelerated
docking programs as a distance—dependent energy function, allowing
the ‘marriage made in heaven’ of direct sampling and scoring of
FFT—generated docking poses (Vajda et 61]., 2013) at a small compu—
tational cost.

2 Methods

We discretely sample the accessible interaction space by treating the
two biomolecules as rigid bodies and performing a 6 dimensional
search over the three translational and three rotational degrees of
freedom. We use FFT—techniques to accelerate the translational
search using a 1  grid spacing (default). These have long been used
in the docking field (Katchalski—Katzir et 61]., 1992). One chain is
fixed in space and considered the receptor molecule, while transla—
tional scans are performed for each rotation of the ligand molecule.
Two atoms 1' and j are considered to be interacting if the distance, d,
between them is 1’de < d g 1’de —1— 3A (by default), where 1’de is
the combined van der Waals radius of the two atoms ridw —l— ridw,
and clashing if d g rvdw. A conformation is deemed a complex if
the volume of interaction is above— and the volume of clashes below
threshold values (300 and 200A3 by default, respectively).

After every translational scan, all conformations that comply
with each restraint are determined. Next, disz/is counts the number
of complexes consistent with each number of restraints, as well as
which restraints are violated. This is repeated until the rotational
sampling density reaches a pre—set value (default 9.720, 7416 orien—
tations). During the rotational search, disz/is stores the maximum
number of consistent restraints found at every scanned position of
the ligand’s center of mass, which ultimately results in a discrete
‘density’ map. The output thus consists of the sum of accessible com—
plexes complying with each number of restraints, a percentage of
how often each restraint is violated, and a discrete—valued density
map.

We implemented DisVis in Python2.7, using the OpenCL frame-
work to ofﬂoad computations to the GPU. The code can be down—
loaded freely from https://github.com/haddocking/disvis together
with documentation and examples.

3 Examples

To illustrate the capabilities of disz/is, we applied it on two systems,
using MS cross—links data (see the Supplementary Information for
details). A fine rotational search (5 .270, 53 256 orientations) was
performed using default values. First, we investigated the accessible
interaction space of two chains of the RNA polymerase II complex
of S. cerevisiae (1WCM, chain A and E) for which 6 BS3 cross-links
were available (Chen et 61]., 2010; Kahraman et 61]., 2013). The
allowed distance was set between 0 and 30A (Cl; — C3) for every re—
straint. Two false—positive restraints were added with a distance in
the crystal structure of 35.7 (FP1) and 42.2A (FP2) to test whether
they could be identified. Applying disz/is shows that none of the 18.9
X 109 complexes sampled are consistent with all 8 restraints, though
a small number are conforming to 7 cross—links (9716 complexes).
For the latter, only restraint FP2 is violated. The accessible inter—
action space consistent with at least 6 restraints is less than 0.03%
of the full interaction space (Fig. 1). The density clearly indicates the
position of the E—chain. Interestingly, both false—positive restraints
are violated in 100% of the complexes consistent with at least six re—
straints; in contrast, the highest violation percentage of a correct
cross—link is only 0.1%. Thus, a high—violation percentage is an indi—
cation of a false—positive restraint.

Second, we applied disz/is on two proteins of the 26 S proteasome
of S. pombe, PRE5 (014250) and PUP2 (Q9UT97), with 7 cross—
links available (Leitner et 61]., 2014). The acceptable distances for
the adipic acid dihydrazide (ADH) and zero-length (ZL) cross-links
were set to 23 and 26  (Co, — C0,), respectively, as 95% of distances
found in a benchmark were shorter (Leitner et al., 2014). The PRE5-

cessible interaction space of the 27 kDa polypeptide consistent with at least
six cross-links in gray. The smooth yellow sphere represents the center of
mass of the polypeptide

PUP2 complex is significantly smaller than the previous example
with the full interaction space consisting of 6.9 X 109 complexes.
Still, the accessible interaction space consistent with all 7 restraints
is heavily reduced to less than 0.04% of the full interaction space.
The accessible interaction space of the PUP2 chain with respect to
PRE5 is overlapping with its center of mass deduced from a hom—
ology model (Supplementary Figure S1).

The computation for those two examples took 74 and 27m on
16 AMD Opteron 6344 processors and 76 and 19 m on an NVIDIA
GeForce GTX 680 GPU, respectively. However, by increasing the
voxel spacing to 2A and using a coarser rotational search (9.720,
7416 orientations) rather similar results can be obtained in only 19
and 8 m, respectively, on a single processor (cf. Supplementary
Tables S2 and S4 for example). It should further be noted that the
bulk of the time is spent on computing the FFTs and a negligible
part on computing the consistent distance restraint space
(Supplementary Table 811).

4 Conclusions

We have introduced DisVis, a Python package and command line
tool to quantify and visualize the information content of distance re—
straints, and a powerful aid in detecting the presence of false—posi—
tive restraints. Our novel approach can be easily incorporated in
FFT—accelerated docking programs, allowing the use of any form of
distance—dependent energy function.

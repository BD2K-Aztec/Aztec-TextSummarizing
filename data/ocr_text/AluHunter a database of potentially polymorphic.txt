ABSTRACT

Summary: AluHunter is a database of taxon-specific primate Alu
elements for use in phylogeny and population genetics. The software
automatically isolates potentially polymorphic Alu insertions in
sequences submitted to GenBank by screening the elements against
reference genomes. The resultant database of variable markers is
a valuable resource for researchers interested in characterizing Alu
elements in their primate taxon of interest.

Availability and Implementation: The AluHunter database can be
accessed at http://www.aluhunter.com.

1 INTRODUCTION

Alu elements are a class of primate-speciﬁc short interspersed
elements (SINEs) that replicate through the genome Via a ‘copy
and paste’ mechanism. Inserted Alu elements are rarely precisely
excised and always ancestrally absent, making them nearly free of
homoplasy, of known polarity, and thus ideal markers for inferring
phylogeny (Hillis, 1999; Ray et al., 2006). If two taxa share a
retrotransposon insertion at a certain genomic location, it is most
likely due to shared descent. As a result, one can easily infer
the phylogeny of a group of primates using presence or absence
data for a sufﬁcient quantity of Alu elements by grouping Via
D0110 parsimony those that share a particular Alu insertion to
the exclusion of the taxa that do not. Their use has allowed the
resolution of certain phylogenetic problems within primates that
traditional DNA sequence-based or morphology-based methods had
failed to decisively resolve, such as the placement of tarsiers within
Haplorhines (Schmitz et al., 2001).

Determining whether an Alu known to be present in one taxon is
present in another can be easily accomplished with the standard
laboratory techniques. Given ampliﬁcation primers ﬂanking a
known Alu element, a researcher need only to amplify the region
with PCR and use gel electrophoresis to determine the amplicon’s
size. Sequencing can then conﬁrm whether the Alu is present in an
organism’s genome, since relying on size estimates alone is prone to
misinterpretation of rare shifted parallel insertions of Alu elements
(Schmitz et al., 2001). Unfortunately, the process of ﬁnding novel,
phylogenetically informative Alu elements—ones already known to
be absent in other taxa—can take weeks of lab work, a process that
can beneﬁt from an efﬁcient in silico solution.

Because of their prevalence in primate genomes, Alu elements
are often unintentionally sequenced, meaning sequence repositories

such as GenBank are sources of millions of non—human primate
Alu elements. However, most of these insertions are useless for
purposes of phylogenetic or population genetic analysis, because
they are not variable at the generic or subgeneric levels. The human
genome, for example, contains over 1 million Alu elements, but
<0.5% are polymorphic within the species (Roy-Engel et al., 2001).
Isolating useful Alu elements for researchers of primate phylogeny
or population genetics requires the determination of whether an Alu
was inserted before the diversiﬁcation of a taxon of interest and is
therefore ﬁxed, or was inserted recently and is therefore potentially
polymorphic. One simple bioinformatic solution is to search a sister
taxon’s genome for the Alu element’s ﬂanks. If the ﬂanks are found
in a sister taxon’s genome with no Alu element in between, one
can assume that the Alu was inserted since the split with the sister
taxon and is therefore potentially polymorphic within the taxon of
interest. This method has only recently become possible with the
availability of a large amount of source DNA sequences in which
to ﬁnd Alu elements and the advent of multiple, publicly available
primate genome sequences against which to screen them.

AluHunter uses this screening process to bioinformatically isolate
polymorphic insertions on a large scale. The project is an attempt
to broadly characterize all Alu elements in GenBank sequences and
isolate those that may be informative at the generic or subgeneric
level.

2 METHODS

AluHunter consists of a suite of scripts written in Perl and Python that
automate the process of isolating polymorphic Alu elements. AluHunter
automatically retrieves novel non-human primate sequences from GenB ank.
It then identiﬁes Alu elements in the sequences using RepeatMasker
(Smit, et al. (1996—2010), http://repeatmasker.org), and stores their source
information, sequences and 200 bp long ﬂanking sequences in a database.
Each Alu is then screened against one or more closely related genomes, Via
a BLASTN search of the genome for the AIM element’s ﬂanking sequences.
If the ﬂanks are found in the genome, with a gap in between that is within
10% of the original Alu element’s size, the AIM is considered to be present
or ﬁxed in both the taxon of interest and the genome. Alternatively, if the
ﬂanks are found in the BLAST search with no gap or a small gap of <10%
of the original Alu element’s size between them, the AIM is considered to be
absent in the genome and therefore potentially polymorphic in the taxon of
interest. The use of fuzzy size matching is to allow for sequence variation
between taxa. Flanks that have multiple close matches in the genome—
possibly indicating the presence of repetitive elements within the ﬂanks—are
removed from further analysis. Finally, information on polymorphic Alu
elements is uploaded to an online MySQL database, which is accessible
from http://www.aluhunter.com Via a front end written in PHP.

On the website, a user can select his or her genus or genera of interest,
and the site will display available information on AIM elements present in the

taxon that have been found to be absent in a closely related genome. Each Ala
returned has a link to the source sequence in GenB ank. Either singularly or in
batch, users can download the Ala element sequences and ﬂanking regions in
FASTA format as well as primer sequences designed with Primer3 for typing
the Ala elements (Rozen & Skaletsky, http://fr0d0.wi.mit.edu/primer3l). The
primer sequences have been screened against a mispriming library to avoid
designing primers that would match to repetitive DNA, and they can be
tested against several primate genomes Via linkage to UCSC’s in silico PCR
website (http://gen0me.ucsc.edu/). Users can also easily BLAST the Ala with
or without ﬂanks against genomes 0r GenBank Via interfaces with NCBI’s
website.

As an example, a user interested in determining the evolutionary
relationships of baboons (genus Papio) could select the genus and download
primers to test for the presence of > 3000 Ala elements present in baboons and
absent in the rhesus macaque genome. PCR on samples from various baboon
species using these primers can be Visualized with gel electrophoresis.
Sequencing the amplicons will conﬁrm if the Ala element is present or
absent. Though some will be ﬁxed in baboons, other Ala elements will group
some species or populations to the exclusion of others. A D0110 parsimony
analysis can then be used on these binary characters to reconstruct the
evolutionary history of the taxa. When tested in multiple populations, the
Ala elements that are variable within a species can be used as markers in
population genetic studies.

The algorithm is similar to that of Farwick et al. (2006), but differs in that
its goal is identifying recently inserted Alu elements that are informative at
the subgenus level. Since conservation of ﬂanking regions for PCR primer
design is more likely for closely related taxa, AlaHanter does not have
stringent requirements for conservation of ﬂanks above the necessity of
successful BLAST searches in the outgroup genome. This allows for the
inclusion of unannotated source sequences and greatly increases the number
of Ala elements found.

3 RESULTS

As of August 2011, there are 1963 554 Ala elements present in
66 primate genera in the AlaHanter database. These have been
selectively screened against nine primate genomes, resulting in
the isolation of 42 055 Ala elements (2.1% of the total) that are
polymorphic at the generic or subgeneric level. These include:

0 31 785 Ala elements in Nomascas (gibb0ns) that are absent in
the great ape genomes (Homo sapiens, Pan troglodytes, Gorilla
gorilla 0r Pongo pygmaeas),

0 2417 Ala elements in Papio (baboons) that are absent in the
rhesus macaque genome (Macaca malatta),

0 2645 Ala elements in Saimiri (squirrel monkeys) that are absent
in the marmoset genome (Callithrix jacchas),

0 2687 Ala elements in Colobas (c010bus monkeys) that are
absent in the rhesus macaque genome (Macaca malatta),

0 1106 Ala elements in Chlorocebas (vervet monkeys) that are
absent in the rhesus macaque genome (Macaca malatta) and

0 526 Ala elements in Callicebas (titi monkeys) that are absent
in the marmoset genome (Callithrix jacchas).

Ultimately, the AlaHanter database aspires to be a classiﬁcation
of all Ala elements ever sequenced and deposited in GenBank.
Despite its simple algorithm, its utility derives from the scale that
its degree of automation allows. The database grows with GenBank,
and will have increasing resolution as more genomes are added.
The Ala elements isolated by the AlaHanter program and available
in its database are a useful resource for researchers studying the
phylogenetic relationships or population genetics of primates.

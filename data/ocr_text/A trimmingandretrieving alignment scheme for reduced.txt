Abstract

Summary: Currently available bisulfite sequencing tools frequently suffer from low mapping rates
and low methylation calls, especially for data generated from the lllumina sequencer, NextSeq.
Here, we introduce a sequential trimming-and-retrieving alignment approach for investigating
DNA methylation patterns, which significantly improves the number of mapped reads and covered
CpG sites. The method is implemented in an automated analysis toolkit for processing bisulfite
sequencing reads.

1 Introduction

The advancement of next-generation sequencing technologies offers
the opportunity to investigate the epigenetic modification on gen-
ome-wide scale and at single-base resolution (Krueger et al., 2012).
Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) has emerged as
a popular tool for profiling DNA methylation at CpG rich regions.
A major advantage of the RRBS method is its reproducibility over
time and sample types. Compared with traditional enrichment based
methods, RRBS is more applicable to formalin-fixed and paraffin-
embedded clinical samples, due to its low DNA input requirement.
However, there are considerable challenges when analyzing
the reads from RRBS due to the complexity induced by the
bisulfite conversion. Highly specialized analysis pipelines are
needed—to target different data types and different platforms.

Bisulfite treatment converts all un-methylated cytosines into ura-
cils, which causes a C—to-T change in forward strand reads.
Consequently, the processing of RRBS library reads involves two
steps: the alignment of converted reads and the calling of methyla-
tion level (i.e. the methylated/unmethylated ratio) on each site. The
challenge in the mapping of converted reads to reference genome
has been extensively studied and multiple methylation-aware align-
ment algorithms and associated pipelines have been proposed, such
as BRAT (Harris et al., 2010, 2012; Krueger and Andrews, 2011; Xi
et al., 2012). In this manuscript, we specifically consider the issue of
low alignment performance caused by variable sequencing quality.
As shown in the Supplementary Figure 51, we often see low read
quality for the first few bases of a read, a pattern consistent across

An alignment scheme for bisulfite sequencing

all samples sequenced by the Illumina NextSeq platform. An import-
ant feature of reads from an RRBS library is that most sequences
have Gs at the second and third bases. Consequently low read qual-
ity will thus be observed at positions 2 and 3 on NextSeq 500,
because ‘G’ bases do not have a dye attached.

The easiest remedy appears to be trimming the first few low-
quality bases from each read to improve the subsequent alignment
process. The first base of every sequence, however, is particularly in-
formative in indicating methylation status at one CpG site—which
should predominantly be a ‘C’ if it was methylated and a ‘T’ if not
methylated. Another possible solution is to mask the low-quality
bases by replacing their reads with ‘N’s. We tested this solution but
did not observe any improvement compared with the mapping based
on raw reads. This is understandable because the ambiguity of base
calls still exists. Such issues can be largely alleviated when libraries
are sequenced on a HiSeq platform. The downside is that one would
obtain even fewer reads per library per sequencing run. Although
this may be compensated by decreasing multiplexing (the number of
individual libraries sequenced at the same time), the sequencing
costs per library increase accordingly. Furthermore, many smaller
laboratories do not have easy access to HiSeqs, while a desktop
NextSeq is both cheaper and easier to operate. NextSeq is also
widely used in large sequencing facilities due to its fast turnaround
time. Therefore, it is critical to adapt the current RRBS processing
pipeline to incorporate this issue.

2 Methods and implementation

In this manuscript, we propose a trimming-and-retrieving scheme
for accurate mapping of bisulfite converted reads from RRBS libra-
ries. The workﬂow of this scheme is illustrated in Figure 1. The pro-
posed scheme includes two major steps. An initial alignment step is
first performed based on the trimmed reads. The trimmed bases are
then retrieved and one alignment is kept only when the first base is a
C in the reference. The methylation percentage calling is performed
by counting methylated and unmethylated bases (and their ratio) on
each site that is a C in the reference genome. This strategy ensures
both accurate bisulfite-converted read alignment and methylation
calling.

We have developed a robust and automated analysis toolkit
BStools to incorporate the proposed scheme. BStools runs on Unix
platform and is implemented with a combination of Perl, R and
Unix shell scripts. This toolkit is built on top of a previously pro-
posed pipeline (Sun et al., 2013) for bisulfite-treated methylation
sequencing quality assessment, in which BRAT (Harris et al., 2010)
was used as the upstream aligner. A computationally efficient script
is provided for fast retrieval of trimmed reads. Note that the new
toolkit not only incorporates quality control and alignment pro-
grams but also includes functions to perform methylation calls and
to analyze the subsequent differentially methylated regions (DMRs).
Some useful graphical functions are also provided for convenient
visualization of methylation calls and DMRs. This package provides
a seamless integration of multiple functions of bisulfite sequencing
analysis by fine-tuning the input and output file formats and objects.
Here, we provide an example of the potential of the proposed
scheme. We analyzed 45 samples (including 25 tumor and 23 nor-
mal samples) with three mapping methods based on: raw reads,
trimmed reads and retrieved reads, respectively. As shown in Figure
1B, the alignment performance of the trimming-and-retrieving
scheme is greatly improved compared with the mapping results
based on the raw reads. Compared with the raw read mapping, the

proportion of uniquely mapped reads increased from <20% to
around 60% on the sample tested. Note that there is a slight de-
crease in the alignment rate compared with the trimmed method, be-
cause the false-called reads (i.e. the first base is not C in the
reference) are removed in the retrieving step. These false-called reads
may arise for many reasons, for example, incorrect enzyme diges-
tion, sequencing and alignment errors. However, the number of cov-
ered CpG site is significantly improved as compared with the simple
trimming method (around 30% increase) when using the trimming-
and-retrieving method. This demonstrates that our method
can boost not only sensitivity but also specificity of methylation
calls.

Although the processing pipeline introduced is mainly used to
address issues with the NextSeq platform, the same scheme can be
adapted to fit other sequencing platforms with low read quality
bases at the 5’ end. One limitation of this pipeline is that it relies on
directional sequencing, which is widespread way of RRBS. Users
need to take extra care when analyzing the non-directional or
paired-end RRBS libraries.

3 Conclusions

The new alignment method proposed and the associated RRBS
anlaysis toolkit provides a timely tool for the accurate mapping and
calling of RRBS, especially with NextSeq data.

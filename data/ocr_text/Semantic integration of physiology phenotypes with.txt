ABSTRACT

Motivation: The systematic observation of phenotypes has become
a crucial tool of functional genomics, and several large international
projects are currently underway to identify and characterize the
phenotypes that are associated with genotypes in several species.
To integrate phenotype descriptions within and across species,
phenotype ontologies have been developed. Applying ontologies to
unify phenotype descriptions in the domain of physiology has been
a particular challenge due to the high complexity of the underlying
domain.

Results: In this study, we present the outline of a theory and its
implementation for an ontology of physiology-related phenotypes.
We provide a formal description of process attributes and relate them
to the attributes of their temporal parts and participants. We apply
our theory to create the Cellular Phenotype Ontology (CPO). The
CPO is an ontology of morphological and physiological phenotypic
characteristics of cells, cell components and cellular processes. Its
prime application is to provide terms and uniform definition patterns
for the annotation of cellular phenotypes. The CPO can be used
for the annotation of observed abnormalities in domains, such as
systems microscopy, in which cellular abnormalities are observed
and for which no phenotype ontology has been created.
Availability and implementation: The CPO and the source
code we generated to create the CPO are freely available on

1 INTRODUCTION

Phenotype studies on all scales and levels of granularity are now
an invaluable tool for functional genomics research. Phenotypes
of targeted mutations in animal models are now systematically
recorded to reveal the role of individual genes within a biological
system. These phenotype studies now play a key role in translational

research and are being used to reveal candidate genes for orphan
diseases and to identify chemicals that may have effects on these
diseases (Schoﬁeld et al., 2011).

The large volume and diversity of phenotypes within different
species and across multiple scales and levels of granularity
necessitates the application of ﬂexible strategies for managing
and integrating data so that it becomes amenable to automated
comparative analyses. To integrate biomedical data across
heterogeneous information systems, biomedical ontologies are
being developed (Smith et al., 2007). An ontology is an explicit
speciﬁcation of a conceptualization of a domain and can be used
to make the meaning of terms in a vocabulary explicit (Gruber,
1995; Guarino, 1998). They play a crucial role in the annotation of
biomedical data and the integration of model organism databases
(Bada et al., 2004; Gene Ontology Consortium, 2010; Goble and
Stevens, 2008).

Ontologies increasingly rely on the use of Semantic Web
technologies (Berners-Lee et al. , 2001). The Semantic Web provides
a stack of protocols and languages to include explicit semantics in
websites. In particular, the Web Ontology Language (OWL) (Grau
et al. , 2008) has been designed to express and share ontologies within
the Semantic Web. OWL is a language based on description logics
(a group of formal languages based on ﬁrst-order predicate logic).
Automated reasoners have been developed within the Semantic
Web to perform complex operations on ontologies formulated in
OWL. In particular, automated reasoners can verify an ontology’s
consistency and use deductive inference to perform powerful queries
over ontologies. To beneﬁt from automated reasoning and the rapidly
increasing number of software tools that are being developed within
the Semantic Web, most biomedical ontologies are now available
in OWL or can be converted into an OWL-based representation
(Hoehndorf et al., 2010b; Horrocks, 2007).

In the domain of phenotypes, multiple ontologies have been
developed. In particular, ontologies to characterize mammalian
(Smith et al., 2004), human (Robinson et al., 2008), yeast (Engel
et al., 2010) and worm (Schindelman et al., 2011) phenotypes
are now available, while several more phenotype ontologies are
under development. To beneﬁt from automated reasoning, integrate
phenotypes across species and reuse the content of anatomy and
process ontologies, we have deﬁned process classes using the
framework of the Phenotypic Attribute and Trait ontology (PATO)

(Gkoutos et al., 2005). According to the PATO framework, a
phenotype can be decomposed, using an Entity—Quality model, into
an affected entity and a quality that characterizes how the entity
is affected (Gkoutos et al., 2005). Such decompositions have been
created for several widely used phenotype ontologies (Gkoutos and
Hoehndorf, 2011; Gkoutos et al., 2009; Mungall et al., 2010a),
and are being applied together with methods for reusing knowledge
contained in anatomy ontologies (Hoehndorf et al., 2010a; Mungall
et al., 2010a).

Although the PATO framework is now successfully being applied
to semantically integrate phenotypes across species, the diversity
and complexity of phenotypes in which biological processes (BPs)
and functions are impaired continues to limit the interoperability
between phenotype ontologies. Major challenges for representing
and integrating process phenotypes include establishing the link to
the components of biological systems that have the capabilities to
exhibit such a behaviour, and that attributes of processes are often
measured indirectly and inferred from other attributes.

Here, we present the foundations for an ontology of process
phenotypes. We present a theory in which several kinds of process
attributes can be distinguished so that normal and abnormal
physiology of biological systems can be formally characterized.
We apply this theory to cellular processes and create the Cell
Phenotype Ontology (CPO). The CPO is linked to reference
ontologies for qualities, BPs, functions and cell components, and
its prime application is the uniﬁcation of phenotypes on the cellular
level across different species as well as for annotation of cellular
phenotypes in domains in which no such ontology exists.

2 SYSTEM AND METHODS
2.1 Gene ontology

The Gene Ontology provides a set of ontologies for molecular and cellular
biology, originally designed to support structured annotations for genes and
gene products in all species with respect to molecular function (MF), BP and
cellular component (CC). MF and BP both describe processes, but at different
spatiotemporal scales; in particular, BP includes processes that unfold within
cells and within tissues and organs of multicellular organisms. Gene product
annotations can be interpreted as identifying participants in the processes.

Over time, GO development has increasingly emphasized a normalized
approach that includes supplementing existing human-readable text
description with formally speciﬁed explicit deﬁnitions for GO classes. The
formalization of G0 is readily apparent in its representation of biological
regulation.

Regulatory processes may regulate other processes, at either the MF
or BP scale or biological qualities. GO accordingly includes three broad
categories of regulation terms, regulation of ME, regulation of BP, and
regulation of biological quality. The ﬁrst two are explicitly deﬁned entirely
with respect to other GO terms, whereas the third comprises classes in which
the regulated qualities are speciﬁed by terms from PATO (see below) or
anatomy ontologies.

All GO regulation terms use one of three relations, regulates,
negatively_regulates and positively_regulates, to link regulation terms
to process or quality terms. The regulates relations are deﬁned in terms
of qualities: a regulatory process causes a change in magnitude to some
quality, which in turn has an effect on the frequency, rate or duration of
some other type of process. Effects that results in increases and decreases
use positively_regulates and negatively_regulates, respectively (Mungall
et al., 2011). The existing ontology structure would also support the addition
of subclasses to distinguish, for example, regulation of the rate of a process
from regulation of its duration or time of onset.

2.2 PATO and the EQ model

PATO was envisaged and designed to provide a platform for allowing the
integration of quantitative and qualitative phenotype-related information
across different domains, levels of granularity and species (Gkoutos et al.,
2005). PATO is an ontology of phenotype qualities that form basic entities
that we can perceive and/or measure such as colours, sizes, rates etc. One of
its classiﬁcation axes is based on the basic type of entity to which a qualities
belongs, and PATO distinguishes between qualities of physical objects and
qualities of processes.

PATO allows for the description of affected entities by combining
various ontologies that describe the entities that have been affected, such
as the various anatomical ontologies, GO (Ashburner et al., 2000), the
Cell Type Ontology (Bard et al., 2005), SO (Eilbeck et al., 2005), etc
with the various qualities it provides for deﬁning how these entities
were affected. PATO can be used for annotation either directly in a so
called post-composed (post-coordinated) manner or for providing formal
(logical) deﬁnitions (equivalence axioms) to ontologies containing a set of
precomposed (precoordinated) phenotype terms. For instance, to describe
the decrease in the length of the sexual cycle of female animals, we can
combine the PATO term Decreased duration (PATO: 0000499) with the
Gene Ontology term Estrous cycle (GO: 0042 698), while if such a term
existed in a precomposed ontology (for example, the MP: 0009007 term
from the Mammalian Phenotype) it could be used to provide an equivalence
statement between that class and the above PATO-based description.

2.3 Axioms for physiology phenotypes

We implement our theory of physiology phenotypes using OWL, a formal
language based on description logics. Using OWL, we formulate axioms
that can be used by automated reasoners to infer additional information.
Automated reasoning and the axioms we provide are intended to satisfy
three aims. First, we use the axioms to infer information from background
knowledge. In particular, we aim to automatically generate a class hierarchy
of physiology phenotypes when an ontology of physiological processes,
such as the G0, is provided as background knowledge. Our second aim
is to provide interoperability with phenotype ontologies of other domains,
including species-speciﬁc phenotype ontologies that have been formalized
using the EQ method (Gkoutos et al., 2005; Mungall et al., 2010a). Finally,
our third aim is to query physiology phenotypes based on physiological
processes that are affected or based on the way in which they are affected.

Our three aims rely on the possibility of using automated reasoning
over a resulting ontology of physiology phenotypes. However, OWL is
an expressive formal language, and automated reasoning in OWL has a
high computational complexity (reasoning in OWL 2.0 is 2NEXPTIME-
complete). Consequently, due to the exponential increase in worst-case time
complexity for automated reasoning in OWL, we would not be guaranteed to
achieve our aims once we consider more than very few phenotype classes. In
particular, using an ontology of the size of G0, with more than 22 000 classes
for processes, as a foundation for constructing an ontology of physiology
phenotypes would not allow us to achieve our aims through automated
reasoning.

The OWL EL proﬁle is a subset of OWL that signiﬁcantly decreases
the expressivity of OWL and the resulting time complexity of automated
reasoning (Motik et al., 2009). Highly efﬁcient automated reasoners have
been developed for OWL EL, which are capable of processing very large
ontologies (Kazakov et al., 2011). To achieve our aims and use automated
reasoning for large ontologies, we limit ourselves to the OWL EL proﬁle.
As a consequence of the restriction to OWL EL, we cannot make use of
negation (not), disjunction (or), universal quantiﬁcation (forall) and
several other types of operations in our axioms (Motik et al., 2009).

The lack of expressivity in OWL EL requires a formulation of axioms
so that the inferences we desire (i.e. the subclass relations resulting
in the ontology’s taxonomy) are maintained without using features of
OWL that go beyond OWL EL expressivity. Consequently, we formulate
abnormality and absence similarly to current formalizations of EQ-based

phenotype ontologies, without the use of negation, disjunction or universal
quantiﬁcation (Mungall et al., 2010a). A detailed description of the axioms
we implement is available as Supplementary Material.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Attributes of processes

We develop a model of process attributes that is applicable for
representations of physiology and related phenotypes. In principle,
we distinguish between three different kinds of process attributes:
the ﬁrst are process attributes that arise directly from processes and
include Duration and Temporal location; the second are attributes
that arise from processes and their temporal parts and include
Frequency and Onset; and the third are attributes that arise from
processes and qualities of their participants, and include Flow rates.

Attributes that can be directly linked to a process arise from
processes’ temporal extension. For example, a duration is an attribute
that characterizes the temporal extent of a process and is similar
to Length, Area and Volume for one-, two- and three-dimensional
physical objects. A Temporal location positions the time interval
at which the process occurs with respect to a reference coordinate
system.

However, the majority of attributes that characterize processes
are not based on these types of process attributes alone, but rather
relate attributes of process participants with the duration of a
process. In particular, a Rate typically refers to an attribute of
some entity with respect to an attribute of another entity, and in
the context of processes, rates often refer to attributes of a process
participant with respect to the duration of the process. For example,
a Mass ﬂow rate refers to the Mass of a process participant with
respect to the Duration of the process, that is, how much matter
is moved (from one point to another) through the process. As a
more complex example, a Rate of change of position refers to the
Distance that an object is moved with respect to the Duration of the
process.

However, not all rates of a process depend on attributes of the
process participants. In particular, a Frequency of occurrence or
Event rate refers to the number of occurrences of a type of process
during a reference process. For example, a Rate of heart beating
refers to the number of Heart beating processes that occur within
a reference process (e.g. a process in which the heart participates
with a duration of 1 min). Further attributes that depend on types
of processes with regard to a reference process are distribution
patterns, that is, how the occurrences of processes of a particular
type are distributed within a reference process. For example, the
heart may beat rhythmically or arrhythmically within a period of
time (see Fig. 1).

Related to distribution patterns are changing qualities of
processes. For example, the rate of heart beating may change
(increase or decrease) throughout the course of a reference process.
A simple analysis of increasing (decreasing) rates would be that
the rate of a heart beating within the ﬁrst half of a process is
lower (higher) than in the second half of the process. To make
such an assertion, we divide a process into two temporal parts.
Mathematically, this process of subdivision can be iterated until
processes occur within inﬁnitesimally small time intervals.

Although some processes can be subdivided indeﬁnitely while
retaining certain kinds of attributes, others cannot. Examples of

process attributes. We assume that the processes labelled a, b, c and d are
all instances of the class of processes P. On the left side, three regulation
(of P) processes are illustrated which exhibit non-comparative attributes.
The ﬁrst process has an attribute of Rhythmic occurrence of P because the
instances of P are temporally equidistantly distributed. The second example
shows an Arrhythmic occurrence of P, and the third examples shows an
Increasing frequency of P. A regulation process with an Increasing frequency
of P attribute is a process in which the value of the Frequency of occurrences
of P attribute is lower in the ﬁrst half of the process than in the second half.
The right side of the ﬁgure illustrates comparative phenotypic descriptions
of processes. On the upper right, the normal reference process is shown.
The second example illustrates a Late onset of P, i.e. the attribute that
P processes begin later than normal processes. Finally, the lower right
illustrates a Decreased frequency of P, since fewer processes of the type
P occur within the reference process than normal.

processes that can be divided include Continuous movement or
Mass ﬂow processes, for which all parts have a Speed or Flow rate
attribute. On the other hand, some processes can be subdivided into
stages of activity and stages of inactivity (with respect to a particular
process type) and cannot arbitrarily be divided. For example, a
process of Heart beating has periods of activity in which a heart
beat occurs and periods in which no heart beat process occurs.
Consequently, not all parts of the process have a Heart rate (Rate
of heart beating) attribute.

We may further attribute a Frequency or Rate to an object instead
of a process. For example, a heart that beats now with a frequency
of 80 bpm, or a car that is moving at a speed of 180km at a
particular point in time (e. g. as observed with a speed camera) can
be considered attributes of the objects (the heart or the car), not
attributes of the processes in which the objects participate. However,
these are diﬁ‘erent kinds of attributes. Rates, when considered
as attributes of objects, may be explicitly deﬁned using rates of
processes. For example, the heart beating frequency of a particular
heart h at a time point t is the frequency of a reference heart beating
process in which h participates. Such a reference process is necessary
to obtain a value for a frequency even when no Heart beating
process is occurring. However, the frequency is only an attribute
of the heart in Virtue of such a reference process in which Heart
beating is actually occurring. This reference process can be uniquely
determined for processes such as Continuous movement, where the
rate of an object at a time t is the rate of the inﬁnitesimally small
process that occurs around t. The reference process is ambiguous

for processes such as Heart beating, and the reference process must
be explicitly stated.

3.2 Cell phenotype ontology

Although our considerations about process attributes are only
the beginnings of a full-ﬂedged theory, we have derived several
phenotype formalization patterns and a high-level taxonomic
structure of process-based phenotypes. To evaluate our approach,
we created the CPO by automatically applying our patterns to
the GO.

Phenotypes in the CPO are either based on structural
abnormalities or abnormal physiology involving cells or cell
components. Structural abnormalities in the CPO are based on
GO-CC hierarchy. GO-CC contains 2918 classes for cell parts
(including Cell) and extracellular components of cells. For each
CC class C in the GO-CC, we create a new class labelled C
phenotype in the CPO. For example, for the class Mitochondrion
(GO: 0 0 0 573 9) in the GO-CC, we create the class Mitochondrion
phenotype.

Among the structural phenotype classes, we ﬁrst distinguish
between normal and abnormal phenotypes. An Abnormal phenotype
of C is a phenotype of an organism that does not have a normal C
as part, while a Normal phenotype of C represents the state in which
an organism has a normal C as part.

Among the abnormal phenotypes that we include for all cell
components listed in GO-CC, we distinguish Abnormal morphology
and Abnormal physiology phenotypes. An Abnormal morphology
of C is either the (abnormal) absence of required parts of C, the
(abnormal) presence of additional parts, or abnormal qualities of
C (Hoehndorf et al., 2010a). For example, an Absence of caveolae
(MP: 0004150) would be a subclass of Abnormal morphology of
plasma membrane in Virtue of caveolae necessarily being part of the
Plasma membrane (GO : 0 0 0 5 8 8 6).

Abnormal physiology of a cell component refers to abnormal
functionality of a cell component. We assume that a functionality
of a cell component is (the potential for) a process in which the
cell component is (causally) involved. We use the deﬁnitions of
GO classes that were created based on lexical decompositions of
GO class labels (Bada and Hunter, 2007; Mungall et al. , 2011; Ogren
et al., 2004) to identify the processes in which cell components are
involved. For example, the deﬁnition of the GO class Mitochondrial
ﬁssion (GO: 0 0 0 02 6 6) is explicitly deﬁned as an Organelle ﬁssion
(GO: 0048285) that results-in-the-division-of a Mitochondrion
(GO: 0 0 0 573 9). Based on this deﬁnition, we make the assumption
that Mitochondrial ﬁssion is one of the functions of a M itochondrion
and that an Abnormality of mitochondrial ﬁssion is a subclass of an
Abnormality of mitochondrion physiology.

Among abnormal physiology, we distinguish between
abnormalities in a single occurrence of a cell component’s
functioning and an abnormal pattern of multiple occurrences of
a cell component’s functioning. For example, abnormalities in
cell division resulting in Aneuploidy refer to abnormalities of Cell
division processes, while an Increased rate of cell division refers
to an abnormality in the pattern of occurrence of multiple cell
division processes. In the CPO, we follow the GO and represent
abnormalities in the pattern of occurrence of X as abnormalities of
Regulation of X processes. In particular, an Increased rate of cell
division is not an attribute of Cell division processes, but rather

arises from the collection of all Cell division processes that occur
within an organism at a given time. In the GO, Regulation of X
processes refer to those processes that determine how often and in
which way one or more X processes occur. Therefore, we assign
the attribute of Increased rate of cell division to Regulation of cell
division processes.

Single occurrences of processes can be abnormal in multiple
ways, depending on the type of process. First, common to all
processes is the quality of Duration and consequently, each process
can have an abnormal (increased or decreased) duration. For
example, a part of an organism may participate in an Inﬂammatory
response (GO: 0006954) that lasts longer than normal, that is,
the organism has an Increased duration of inﬂammatory response
phenotype. We deﬁne such a phenotype as a phenotype of an
organism which has a part that participates in Inﬂammatory
response, and this Inﬂammatory response process has an Increased
duration (PATO: 0 0 0 0 4 9 8).

The second common type of abnormality are abnormalities based
on process participants in relation to the duration of the process.
These include all kinds of rates such as Mass ﬂow rate, Energy ﬂow
rate and Velocity (the rate of change of position). In each of these
cases, an object participates in a process and a quality (or change
of quality) of that object throughout the duration of the process is
considered to form a new quality. If the process has participants that
are distinguished into inputs and outputs, then a recurring pattern is
that the amount of inputs or outputs that participate in the process
can be increased or decreased. For example, an Increased rate of
cytoplasmic streaming can be deﬁned as an increased amount of
inputs or an increased amount of outputs of a Cytoplasmic streaming
process.

Finally, some objects may be divided into stages during which
particular states of affairs obtain, and a process may be abnormal
in that these states of affairs do not obtain at a particular stage.
Notably, at the beginning and the end of a process, pre— and post-
conditions may obtain that are abnormally changed in a process. For
example, Aneuploidy—an abnormality during cell division at which
the chromosomes do not separate properly between the two cells —
may be considered the result of such an abnormality.

We implement the ﬁrst two types of abnormality in the CPO.
First, as a subclass of each Abnormality of P class, we create
Abnormal duration of P, which in turn has Increased duration of
P and Decreased duration of P as subclasses. Second, if we are
able to identify inputs I (P) or outputs 0(P) of the process P in the
formal deﬁnitions of the GO, we automatically generate Abnormality
of I (P) in P as well as Abnormality of 0(P) in P. The left side of
Figure 2 illustrates the schema of classes we generate for single
process abnormalities.

The second type of abnormality in the CPO relate to abnormalities
of multiple occurrences of some process X. According to the
GO, regulation processes are processes that maintain or modify
the occurrence of processes of a particular type. Following this
convention, we call an abnormality of multiple occurrences of X
Abnormality of the regulation of X .

A ﬁrst kind of abnormality of regulatory processes are abnormal
temporal distribution patterns of a process. In these abnormalities,
the way in which processes of a particular kind are temporally
distributed is abnormal. The most common abnormal distribution
pattern is an increased or decreased frequency, and we use
PATO’s frequency class to deﬁne Abnormal frequency of occurrence

of X. For example, an Abnormal frequency of occurrence of
apoptosis is deﬁned as an abnormality of Regulation of apoptosis
(GO : 0 042 981) with respect to the Frequency (PATO: 000 0044)
of Apoptosis (GO : 0 0 0 6 9 1 5) occurrences.

There are further types of deviation from a distribution pattern.
For example, a kind of process that is normally rhythmic can be
abnormal in that it is arrhythmic. A typical example of this kind of
process is Heart beating (GO : 0 0 6 0 0 47), in which Cardiac muscle
contraction (GO: 0 0 6 0 04 8) processes occur in a rhythmic pattern.
In Cardiac dysrhythmia, however, Cardiac muscle contraction
processes occur arrhythmically, and we consider this to be an
abnormality of the regulation of Cardiac muscle contraction.
Although these abnormalities are often highly informative in clinical
diagnostics and biological investigations, we usually lack the
necessary information that is required to automatically determine
meaningful types of abnormal distribution patterns.

A second kind of regulatory abnormalities is related to the onset
of a process. With respect to a reference process, a particular
kind of process may be Delayed (PATO : 0 000502) or Premature
(PATO : 0000694). For example, Delayed apoptosis refers to an
abnormality of the Regulation of apoptosis in which apoptosis
is induced later than normal. We use the PATO quality Onset
(PATO : 0002325) and its children Delayed and Premature to
deﬁne these types of regulatory abnormality. Similarly, we use
PATO’s Oﬁ‘set (PATO: 0002324) quality and its children to
characterize regulatory abnormalities in which a process ends
prematurely or too late.

Finally, a third kind of regulatory abnormality refers to abnormal
rates with respect to a participant of the process that is being
regulated. For example, a cytoplasmic ﬂow rate can be increased
or decreased not within a single Cytoplasmic streaming process
but rather the total cytoplasmic ﬂow rate, as a summation over
all cytoplasmic streaming processes that occur within an organism
(or a particular anatomical location), is increased or decreased.
Although a ﬂow rate of a single Cytoplasmic streaming process
is a quality of that process, an increased total cytoplasmic ﬂow
rate is a quality of the regulation of Cytoplasmic streaming. In
particular, it is possible for an organism to have a normal—
or even a decreased—cytoplasmic ﬂow rate in each individual
cytoplasmic streaming process while at the same time having an
increased total cytoplasmic ﬂow rate due to a large increase in

the frequency of occurrence of cytoplasmic streaming processes.
Similarly, the frequency of occurrence of cytoplasmic streaming
may be normal or decreased while the total cytoplasmic ﬂow rate
is increased due to an increased cytoplasmic ﬂow rate in each
individual cytoplasmic streaming process. We include total rates
as subclasses of regulatory abnormalities in the CPO because these
are the attributes of processes that are often measured or observed,
while the rates of individual processes are inferred.

3.3 Implementation

We were faced with two choices for implementing the CPO: we
could either implement a pre-composed ontology in which all classes
and their deﬁnitions are pre— generated according to the patterns we
deﬁne, or we could develop an annotation software that enables
the selection of our process phenotype patterns based on the current
structure of the GO. To maximize the utility and compatibility of the
CPO, and to provide stable identiﬁers for its concepts, we selected
the ﬁrst strategy and developed a software to automatically generate
a pre-composed ontology from the GO.

We developed a software that uses the OWL API (Horridge et al. ,
2007) to generate an OWL representation of the CPO. The software
requires three input ﬁles: a version of the G0 on which to base the
generated CPO, a version of PATO that is used to deﬁne abnormal
qualities and a copy of the GO cross-product deﬁnitions (Mungall
et al., 2011) that is used to relate cell components to the processes
in which they participate as well as identify the participants, inputs
and outputs of processes.

We automatically generate a unique numerical identiﬁer for each
class in the CPO. Since the CPO is based on the GO and need to
be updated with subsequent versions of the GO, we must ensure to
keep identiﬁers stable in subsequent versions of CPO. Therefore, we
use the identiﬁers for GO classes to generate CPO class identiﬁers.

In the CPO, identiﬁers contain two components and are of
the form CPO:XXGGGGGGG, where GGGGGGG is the seven-digit
identiﬁer of the GO class on which the CPO class is based, and
XX is a preﬁx that identiﬁes the type of phenotype pattern that is
applied to the GO class. For example, based on the class Apoptosis
(GO : 0 0 0 6 9 15), we generate the CPO classes Abnormality of
Apoptosis, Abnormality of single occurrence of apoptosis and
Abnormality of regulation of apoptosis. We use the preﬁxes 12,

14 and 15 for each of the corresponding phenotype patterns
and consequently generate the class identiﬁers CPO : 1 2 0 0 0 6 9 1 5,
CPO: 140006915 and CPO: 150006915. As long as the GO
maintains its identiﬁer for the Apoptosis class, the identiﬁers in the
CPO will remain stable even when it is regenerated.

We use the labels of GO classes to automatically generate class
labels for phenotype classes as well as textual deﬁnitions for classes
in the CPO. For example, the label of the class for increased number
of occurrences of Apoptosis is Increased frequency of occurrences
of Apoptosis, and its textual deﬁnition states that an increased
frequency of occurrences of Apoptosis is a phenotype of Regulation
of apoptosis in which the number of occurrences of Apoptosis within
a given time period is increased in comparison to a reference process
that is considered normal.

As of November 2011, CPO contains 125 466 classes of
which 79 236 are explicitly deﬁned. The ELK reasoner (Kazakov
et al., 2011) is able to perform a classiﬁcation of the
ontology in under 10 s. We make the ontology and the
source code that is used to generate it freely available on
http://ce11—phenotype.googlecode.com.

4 DISCUSSION

4.1 Applications of the CPO

The Fission Yeast Phenotype Ontology (FYPO), a new
ontology developed to support annotation of phenotypes in
Schizosaccharomyces pombe, consists of pre-composed terms
describing normal or abnormal cellular phenotypes. Over 80%
of FYPO deﬁnitions reference descendants of GO-BP’s Cellular
process as the entity; a further 11% reference GO-CC terms. All
FYPO explicit deﬁnitions reference qualities in PATO, including
normal, abnormal and several process qualities including Increased
duration and Decreased occurrence. FYPO will, thus, ﬁt neatly
under the CPO umbrella and stands to beneﬁt from the automated
synchronization between CPO and GO, as well as the integration
of cellular phenotypes across species that the CPO can provide.
S. pombe annotations to FYPO terms will provide a rich body of
highly speciﬁc, well-supported data to be integrated with data from
other species.

A further domain that will greatly beneﬁt from the CPO is systems
microscopy, which aims to understand complex and dynamic cellular
systems by combining automated ﬂuorescence microscopy, cell
microarray platforms, quantitative image analysis and data mining
(Lock and Strmblad, 2010). If we consider some of the studies,
which have been published in this ﬁeld in the last few years (Fuchs
et al., 2010; Neumann et al., 2010; Schmitz et al. , 2010), the need for
CPO becomes evident. In the three studies, live-cell imaging assays
and RNAi knockdown were used to generate phenotypic proﬁles
that quantify the cellular response to a given siRNA thus allowing
identiﬁcation of hundreds of genes involved in diverse biological
functions including cell division, migration and survival. In each
study, several phenotypes were detected and described by the authors
without the use of ontologies or controlled vocabularies, making
the integration between datasets extremely difﬁcult. For example,
it is evident that cell division phenotypes were observed in all
three datasets and referred to by terms such as Mitotic delay/arrest,
Prolonged mitotic exit, Methaphase delay and Methaphase cells).

Without a controlled vocabulary of cellular phenotypes, the overlap
between such phenotype descriptions is unclear.

Data integration is also complicated by the lack of standardization
at the level of data production and processing; all these
issues are currently being address by the different groups
involved in the Systems Microscopy Network of Excellence
(http://www.systemsmicroscopy.eu/) and the ﬁrst step towards data
integration can be achieved by further developing CPO. This
ontology will be used to integrate phenotypes’ deﬁnitions across
existing datasets and will then become an integrated part of the data
processing pipeline and used to annotate the data as it gets generated
(Conrad et al., 2011).

4.2 Future research

Our main contribution is an analysis of process phenotypes that
are used across multiple domains and scales and which are crucial
for understanding and representing physiology of living systems.
The Ontology of Physics in Biology (OPB) (Cook et al., 2011)
is an ontology that has recently been proposed to characterize
physiological processes and the physical qualities of biological
entities based on a theory of ﬂuid dynamics. It is an important goal
for future research to incorporate the OPE in phenotypic descriptions
and make our theory of process phenotypes compatible with the
physical descriptions of processes and their attributes as outlined by
the OPE.

We implemented the CPO using a pattern-based approach to
formulating phenotypes involving processes. The patterns we
identify are based on pre-existing ontologies; in particular, the PATO
ontology and the classiﬁcation of cellular processes as well as
CC in the G0. The result of our method is a large ontology in
which classes for phenotypes are pre-composed: they are named
and deﬁned within an OWL ontology. However, the large size of
the resulting ontology may impair its utility for data annotation
and integration, and software tools may not always support such
very large ontologies. The alternative to pre-composing all possible
phenotype classes using the patterns we describe is to dynamically
generate appropriately deﬁned classes at the time at which they are
being used. To achieve this goal, software must be developed to
support ontology users in applying these patterns and generate the
appropriate class description when required.

A further important task is to develop the theory we outlined and
applied for the CPO. In particular, a precise formal characterization
of this theory in terms of axioms will further improve the clarity of
phenotypic descriptions of processes and enable its integration in
well-developed formal ontologies of processes (Herre et al., 2006;
Ozgovde and Griininger, 2010).

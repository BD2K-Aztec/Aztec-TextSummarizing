ABSTRACT

Summary: Sequence—structure—function information is critical in
understanding the mechanism of pMHC and TR/pMHC binding and

on pMHC and TR/pMHC interactions, MHC-Peptide Interaction
Database-TR version 2 (MPID-T2), is now available augmented with
the latest PDB and lMGT/3Dstructure-DB data, advanced features
and new parameters for the analysis of pMHC and TR/pMHC
structures.

1 INTRODUCTION

Major histocompatibility complexes (MHC) or human leukocyte
antigens (HLAs) in human are important elements of T cell-mediated
immunity. They are cell surface glycoproteins among which MHC-
I proteins are ubiquitously expressed by most cells and MHC-II
proteins are expressed by antigen-presenting cells (APC; Lefranc
et al., 2005). MHC proteins bind immunogenic peptide epitopes
(p) derived from antigens and present them as peptide—MHC
(pMHC) complexes on the cell surface, for subsequent recognition
by T—cell receptors (TR), leading to TR/pMHC complexes, which
are responsible for T—cell activation and triggering the adaptive
immune response cascade (Khan et al., 2010). Understanding the
physicochemical basis for the selection of certain speciﬁc peptide
epitopes by MHC alleles and the consequent recognition of pMHC
ligands by TR proteins is critical for the design of T cell-based
peptide vaccines (Khan et al., 2010).

An early collection of pMHC X—ray crystal structures in the
Protein Data Bank (PDB; Berman et al., 2000) led to the
development of MPID (Govindarajan et al., 2003), comprising 86
classical pMHC structures, reporting pMHC interaction parameters.
With increasing pMHC and TR/pMHC structures in the PDB and in
the IMGT/3Dstructure-DB (Kaas et al., 2004) and reports of new
interaction parameters (Kaas and Lefranc, 2005), MPID—T (Tong
et al., 2006) was developed, with 187 pMHC and 16 TR/pMHC

structures along with interaction parameters for the analysis of
pMHC structures alone.

With recent rise in TR/pMHC structural data in the PDB and
in IMGT/3Dstructure-DB (Ehrenmann et al., 2010), and updated
interaction parameters (Kaas et al., 2008), there is an increasing
demand for more effective and efﬁcient computational protocols
to predict T—cell epitopes. Hence, we have updated MPID-T,
augmenting it with advanced features and new parameters for the
analysis of both pMHC and TR/pMHC structures, to gain an in-depth
understanding of the structural determinants underlying TR/pMHC
binding and recognition.

2 RESOURCE DESCRIPTION

MPID—T2 is a semiautomatically curated structure-derived MySQL
database hosted on a Linux server, containing interaction
information on all available experimental X-ray crystal structures of
pMHC and TR/pMHC complexes extracted from PDB. MPID—T2
(November 2010 update) comprises 415 entries from ﬁve MHC
sources (human: 282, murine: 127, rat: 3, chicken: 2 and
monkey: 1), spanning 56 alleles; 353 pMHC structures, 62
TR/pMHC complexes; 352 MHC class I (MHC-I) complexes and
63 MHC class II (MHC-II) structures. Overall, 327 entries are non-
redundant (MHC-I: 279 and MHC—II: 48). MPID—T2 includes non—
classical structures (structures with T—cell receptor like antibodies,
cluster of differentiation {CD} molecules and natural killer cell
immunoglobulin like receptors {KIR} associated to the pMHC) and
complexes with non-standard residues. For PDB structures with
multiple molecular assemblies, the most accurate and complete
structure is stored. Each structure is manually veriﬁed, classiﬁed
and analyzed for pMHC and TR/pMHC interactions.

2.1 Deﬁnitions of interaction parameters

2.1.] Predeﬁned interaction parameters Existing MPID-T
interaction parameters namely (i) intermolecular hydrogen bonds;
(ii) gap volume; (iii) gap index; and (iV) interface area have been
applied to all new pMHC complexes and extended to all TR/pMHC
structures (Tong et al., 2006, 2007).

2.1.2 New interaction parameters Speciﬁc new interaction
parameters in MPID—T2, Vital for characterizing pMHC and/or
TR/pMHC binding, computed from the 3D coordinates of the crystal
structures, are listed below.

MPID- T2

 

Binding energy: binding energy (BB) is a measure of the strength
of the interaction between the ligand and the receptor in terms
of binding free energy (AG). Values for BB between peptide and
MHC for all structures and between pMHC and TR for TR/pMHC
structures were calculated using DCOMPLEX (Liu et al., 2004).

Molecular surface electrostatic potential: interactions between
TR and pMHC depend vastly on charges displayed by TR and pMHC
binding interfaces. Hence, we used webPIPSA (Richter et al., 2008)
to calculate and ICM (Internal Coordinate Mechanics; Abagyan
et al., 1994) to Visualize molecular surface electrostatic potential
(MSEP) at the binding interfaces (Supplementary Fig. S 1a, b).

TR docking angle: TR docking angle is the angle formed by the TR
interface (paratope) on the pMHC interface (epitope) with respect
to the linear axis of the cognate peptide within the MHC groove.
This value ‘9’ (Supplementary Fig. S 1a) was calculated by matching
the respective pMHC and TR interface MSEP for complimentarity
of charges, augmented by TR/pMHC interacting residues from the
literature. The charged residues at the pMHC interface form an
ellipse. The angle between the major axis of the ellipse and the
Ca backbone axis of the peptide was measured using ICM.

Contact area: contact area (CA) is the area enclosed by the
interacting residues of the two molecules (Supplementary Fig. S 10),
as compared to interface area, which is the interaction area at the
molecular level. We have used ICM to compute CA values between
peptide and MHC for all structures and between pMHC and TR for
TR/pMHC structures.

3 IMPLEMENTATION

Each entry in MPID—T2 is given a unique identiﬁer for ease of
identiﬁcation, comparison, characterization and rapid Visualization.
Information for each pMHC and TR/pMHC structure in MPID—
T2 is classiﬁed into ﬁve major categories: (i) MHC (chain-
id, allele, class and source); (ii) peptide (chain-id, sequence,
source and length); (iii) computed pMHC interaction parameters
(intermolecular hydrogen bonds, gap volume, gap index, interface
area, BE, CA and MSEP); (iV) structural information (structure
determination method, resolution, PDB release year and publication
reference); and (V) hyperlinks to related external databases like PDB
(for sequence—structure information), SYFPEITHI (Rammensee
et al., 1999; for MHC ligands and peptide motifs), IMGT/HLA
(Robinson et al., 2001; for HLA sequences) and IMGT/3Dstructure-
DB (for annotations on pMHC and TR/pMHC sequences with
3D structures; Ehrenmann et al., 2010). However, TR/pMHC
structures in MPID-T2 have additional TR/pMHC interaction
parameters (BE, MSEP, TR docking angle, CA, gap volume, gap
index and interface area). Search page of the database presents
a web interface that allows searching for pMHC and TR/pMHC
complexes based on different categories (MHC class, allele,
source organism, peptide length, user-deﬁned output required and
TR type) or PDB information (PDB—ID, resolution and release
year; Supplementary Fig. S2a). The search output (Supplementary
Fig. S2b) shows various ﬁelds; noticeably, TR/pMHC, pMHC,
MHC, peptide and TR 3-D coordinates are downloadable for
structural Visualization. The alignment page illustrates pMHC and
TR/pMHC structural alignments based on species, MHC allele,
peptide length and TR type. To portray Vital pMHC and TR/pMHC
interactions, precomputed schematic diagrams, generated using
LIGPLOT (Wallace et al., 1995), are provided. Also available in
the patterns page of MPID-T2 are consensus patterns, obtained

using WebLogo (Crooks et al., 2004), showing the conservation of
residues among peptides with same lengths and alleles. MPID—T2
help page lists database usability details, deﬁnitions for interaction
parameters and other useful resources.

4 DISCUSSION

MPID—T2 aims to facilitate mining of fundamental relationships
and structural descriptors hidden within TR/pMHC and pMHC
interactions for in-depth characterization. Inclusion of structural
descriptors like BE, MSEP, TR docking angle and CA have
facilitated in understanding the principles underlying TR/pMHC
binding (Khan and Ranganathan, unpublished results). These
descriptors can be used as parameters deﬁning pMHC and
TR/pMHC interactions, thereby facilitating rational development of
methods to identify strong MHC binding T-cell epitopes with greater
propensity to activate T cells. This highlights the utility of MPID—
T2 in vaccine research. We have now enabled TR-speciﬁc searches
by classifying TR/pMHC structures based on TR types. Future
enhancements will include listing post-translational modiﬁcations
(PTM) for peptides to help understand the effect of PTM on
TR/pMHC binding and interaction. MPID-T2 will be updated on
a quarterly basis.

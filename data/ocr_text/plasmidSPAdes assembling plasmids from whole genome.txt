Abstract

Motivation: Plasmids are stably maintained extra-chromosomal genetic elements that replicate in-
dependently from the host cell’s chromosomes. Although plasmids harbor biomedically important
genes, (such as genes involved in virulence and antibiotics resistance), there is a shortage of speci-
alized software tools for extracting and assembling plasmid data from whole genome sequencing

projects.

Results: We present the plasmidSPAdes algorithm and software tool for assembling plasmids
from whole genome sequencing data and benchmark its performance on a diverse set of bacterial

genomes.

Availability and Implementation: PLASMIDSPADES is publicly available at http://spades.bioinf.spbau.

1 Introduction

Plasmids are common in Bacteria and Archaea, but have been de-
tected in Eukaryotes as well (Gunge et al., 1982). The cells often
have multiple plasmids of varying sizes existing together in different
numbers of copies per cell. Plasmids are important genetic engineer-
ing tools and the vectors of horizontal gene transfer that may harbor
genes involved in virulence and antibiotic resistance. Thus, studies
of plasmids are important for understanding the evolution of these
traits and for tracing the proliferation of drug-resistant bacteria.
Since plasmids are difficult to study using Whole Genome
Sequencing (WGS) data, biologists often use special biochemical
methods for extracting and isolating plasmid molecules for further
plasmidome sequencing (Kav et al., 2012; Williams et al., 2006). In
the case of WGS, when a genome of a bacterial species is assembled,
its plasmids often remain unidentified. Obtaining information about
plasmids from thousands of genome sequencing projects (without

preliminary plasmid isolation) is difficult since it is not clear which
contigs in the genome assembly have arisen from plasmids.

Since the proliferation of plasmids carrying antimicrobial resist-
ance and virulence genes leads to the proliferation of drug resistant-
bacterial strains, it is important to understand the epidemiology of
plasmids and to develop plasmid typing systems. Carattoli et al.
(2014) developed PlasmidFinder software for detecting and classify-
ing variants of known plasmids based on their similarity with plas-
mids present in plasmid databases. However, PlasmidFinder is
unable to identify novel plasmids that have no significant similarities
to known plasmids.

Lanza et al. (2014) developed the plasmid constellation network
(PLACNET) tool for assembling plasmids from WGS data and
applied it for analyzing plasmid diversity and adaptation (de Toro
et al., 2014) PLACNET uses three types of information to identify
plasmids: (i) information about scaffold links and coverage in the

coverage (bin size = 5)

Fig. 1. E. coli coverage distribution for long contigs. The number of long con-
tigs (greater than 10 kb in length) with a given k—mer coverage (k: 55) in the
E. coli dataset (accession number ERA000206) assembled with SPADES. The
coverage of a k—mer in a genome is defined as the number of reads spanning
this k—mer. The median coverage for long contigs is 231. Each bar in the histo-
gram represents all contigs with the coverage in a bin of size 5. For example,
the tallest bar in the histogram corresponds to the contigs with coverage be-
tween 230 and 235. The long contigs with minimum (160) and maximum
(268) coverage have lengths 10438 and 13 078 bp, respectively

WGS assembly, (ii) comparison to reference plasmid sequences and
(iii) plasmid-diagnostic sequence features such as replication initi-
ator proteins. PLACNET combines these three types of data and
outputs a network that needs to be further pruned by expert analysis
to eliminate confounding data.

While combining all three types of data for plasmid sequencing
is important, the focus of this paper is only on using WGS assembly
for plasmid reconstruction in a fully automatic fashion. We argue
that while the analysis of scaffolds in Lanza et al. (2014) is import-
ant, there is a wealth of additional information about plasmids
encoded in the structure of the de Bruijn graph (constructed from
k-mers in reads) that Lanza et al. (2014) do not consider. Recently,
Rozov et al. (2015) demonstrated how to use the de Bruijn graphs
constructed by the SPADES assembler (Bankevich et al., 2012) to sig-
nificantly improve the plasmid assembly (focusing on data generated
using plasmid isolation techniques) as well as reconstruction of plas-
mid sequences from metagenomics datasets. Below we describe a
novel tool (PLASMIDSPADES) aimed at assembling plasmids from the
WGS data. Recently, this problem was addressed in the case of long
SMRT reads (Conlan et al., 2014) but it remains open for datasets
containing short Illumina reads, which represent the lion’s share of
bacterial sequencing projects.

We show that PLASMIDSPADES has the potential to massively in-
crease the throughput of plasmid sequencing and to provide informa-
tion about plasmids in thousands of sequenced bacterial genomes by
re-assembling their genomes, identifying their plasmids and supple-
menting the corresponding GenBank entries with the plasmid annota-
tions. Such plasmid sequencing efforts are important since many
questions about plasmid function and evolution remain unanswered.
For example, Anda et al. (2015) recently found a striking example of
a bacterium (Aureimonas sp. AU20) that harbors the rRNA operon
on a plasmid rather than on the chromosome. Thus, re-sequencing
10005 of bacterial genomes with the goal to reassemble their plasmids
will help to answer important questions about plasmid evolution. We
illustrate how plasmidSPAdes contributes to plasmid discovery by
analyzing the Citrohacter freundii CFNIH1 genome with well-
annotated plasmids and identifying a new previously overlooked plas-
mid in this genome. We also show how PLASMIDSPADES was used to

discover eight new plasmids in ten randomly chosen shotgun datasets
derived from bacterial genomes and deposited in the Short Reads
Archive. We further benchmark various tools for plasmid sequencing
and provide the first analysis of accuracy of existing plasmid sequenc-
ing tools across diverse bacterial genomes.

2 Methods

2.1 Separating plasmids from chromosomes by read
coverage

PLASMIDSPADES uses the read coverage of contigs to assist in distinguish-
ing between plasmids and chromosomes. Illumina DNA sequencing
platform typically produces reads with highly uniform coverage of
the bacterial chromosomes. Figure 1 and Table 1 illustrate that 92%
(78 out of 85) of contigs greater than 10 kb in length in the assembly
graph of the E. coli genome have coverage within 10% of the median
value and 99% (84 out of 85 ) have coverage within 20% of the me-
dian value. The coverage of most genomes in this table is rather uni-
form with exception of Bacillus anthracis A1144, Rhodococcus J21s
and Thermus filiformis ATT43280 (shown in bold).

Depending on the copy number of the plasmid, its coverage can
be higher or lower than the chromosome coverage. For example, if a
plasmid has a copy number 10, we expect it to have a much higher
coverage than the chromosome coverage. Similarly, if a plasmid can
only be found in 1/ 10 of the sampled cells, it will have a much lower
coverage than the chromosome coverage. In order to distinguish
plasmids and chromosomes by coverage, PLASMIDSPADES first esti-
mates the chromosome coverage. The naive strategy for estimating
the chromosome coverage as the average coverage over all contigs
often leads to an inﬂated estimate because some plasmids have very
large copy numbers. Since such plasmids have high coverage, the
average coverage may be skewed towards the plasmid coverage.

To avoid this pitfall, PLASMIDSPADES computes the median cover-
age (denoted medianCoverage) using the assembly graph constructed
by the SPADES assembler (Bankevich et al., 2012). SPADES generates
the assembly graph by first constructing the de Bruijn graph of all
reads and further performs various graph simplification procedures
(e.g. bubble and tip removals) to transform it into the assembly graph.

An edge in the assembly graph is classified as long if the length
of the contig resulting from this edge exceeds the parameter
longEdgeLength (the default value is 10 000 bp) and short other-
wise. The median coverage is defined as the maximum coverage for
which the collection of all long contigs of that coverage or greater
covers at least half of the total length of the collection of all long
contigs in the SPADES assembly graph. We focus on long (rather than
all) contigs for two reasons. First, analyzing long contigs allows us
to exclude most repeats from consideration since the longest repeats
in most bacterial genomes are shorter than 10 kb (Koren et al.,
2013). Second, long contigs have a lower variance in their coverage
compared to short contigs. Figure 2 illustrates the larger variance in
coverage for medium-sized (longer than 1 kb but shorter than 10 kb)
contigs. These medium-sized contigs for the E. coli genome vary in
coverage from 200 to 1702. For comparison, the long contigs
(>10 kb) vary in coverage from 160 to only 268.

Given a parameter maxDeviation (the default value is 0.3),
PLASMIDSPADES classifies a long edge e in the assembly graph as a
chromosomal edge if its coverage satisfies the following condition:

Coverage(e)

For each dataset, we computed the median coverage and then counted the
number of long (>10kb) contigs within x% of the median coverage (for
x: 10, 20 and 30%). For example, for E. coli, the median coverage was 216
and 85 out of 86 long contig had a coverage between within 20% of the me-
dian coverage. The table is divided into three parts corresponding to species
with known plasmids (upper part), species that have no plasmids (middle
part), and species for which it remains unknown whether they have plasmids.
For the datasets with known plasmids we also computed the fraction of
chromosomal contigs with a coverage within 10%, 20% and 30% of the me-
dian value among all chromosomal contigs (shown in parenthesis). The de-
scription of these datasets are provided in section 3.1 and Appendix.

Figure 3 shows the differences in coverage between B. cereus
chromosome and its plasmid and illustrates the utility of using
medianCoverage to identify chromosomal contigs. For this dataset,
the long contigs can be separated with perfect sensitivity and specifi-
city into chromosome contigs (coverage varying from 120 to 156)
and plasmid contigs (coverage varying from 170 to 184) based on
coverage. The medianCoverage (vertical green line) corresponds
closely to the center of the bacterial contig distribution because bac-
terial genomes are typically much larger than plasmid genomes.

2.2 plasmidSPAdes algorithm

PLASMIDSPADES utilizes SPADES for transforming the de Bruijn graph
into the assembly graph (Bankevich et al., 2012) and finds a sub-
graph of the assembly graph that we refer to as the plasmid graph. It
further uses EXSPANDER (Prjibelski et al., 2014) for repeat resolution
in the plasmid graph using paired reads and generates plasmidic
contigs.

We define the size of a connected component in the assembly
graph as the sum of the lengths of the contigs resulting from its
edges. An edge (12, w) in the assembly graph is called a dead-end
edge if either the node v has indegree zero or the node w has outde-
gree zero (but not both). PLASMIDSPADES classifies a connected com-
ponent in an assembly graph as plasmidic if it is composed of a
single loop edge of length at least minCirc (default value is 1 kb) or
if its size exceeds minCompSize (default value is 10 kb).

To transform the assembly graph into a plasmid graph,
PLASMIDSPADES iteratively removes long chromosomal edges and
short dead-end edges from the assembly graph. Chromosomal edges
are removed because they are presumed to belong to chromosomes
rather than plasmids. Dead-end edges are removed because plasmids
are not expected to generate dead-end edges.

The PLASMIDSPADES algorithm outlined below works best when
the plasmids are circular and have a copy number significantly dif-
ferent from 1.PLASMIDSPADES (Reads, k, maxComponentSize)

1. construct the de Bruijn graph using k-mers from Reads and
transform it into the assembly graph.
2. compute medianCoz/erage

end edges and a size less than maxComponentSize (default
value is 150 kb)

b. if 3.a removes at least one edge, remove all short dead-end
edges and replace each non-branching path in the resulting
graph with a single edge

4. remove all non-plasmidic connected components from the as-
sembly graph to construct a plasmid graph.

5. launch EXSPANDER to perform repeat resolution on the plasmid
graph

6. output all resultant plasmidic contigs and assign them to a con-
nected component in the plasmid graph they originated from.

The minCirc and minCompSize parameters (implicit in step 4) serve
an important goal of removing relatively short chromosomal contigs
that evaded the step 3 of PLASMIDSPADES.

For example, error-prone reads sometimes aggregate into short
paths in the assembly graph that are represented by short isolated
edge with low coverage. These erroneous contigs are not removed in
step 3.a because they are short and their coverage differs from the
genome coverage. They are not removed in step 3.b because they are
not connected to any long edges. However, they are removed in step
4. Step 6 aggregates plasmid contigs into connected components
(that are expected to originate from the same plasmid) rather than
outputting all plasmid contigs as a set without attempting to assign
them to individual plasmids.

Ideally, PLASMIDSPADES should capture all plasmids and no
chromosomal fragments in the plasmid graph (with the exception of
chromosomal segments that share highly similar segments with
chromosomes). However, it is not entirely true since some short seg-
ments of plasmids are sometimes missing from the plasmid graph
and some short chromosomal segments are often present in the plas-
mid graph. Also, it is difficult to distinguish tandem repeats from
plasmids by analyzing the assembly graph. Indeed, tandem repeats
often form whirls in the assembly graph (Pevzner et al., 2004) result-
ing in cycles with high coverage by reads. To distinguish plasmid
from tandem repeats, one should perform the plasmid-diagnostic
tests for each putative plasmid identified by PLASMIDSPADES, e.g. a
test on the presence of the replication initiation (Rep) and relaxase
proteins, which are used for classification of plasmids into incom-
patibility groups and mobility types (Shintani et al., 2015)

Ideally, PLASMIDSPADES should assemble each plasmid into a sep-
arate contig. In practice, it is unlikely when plasmids contain long
repeats (or share long repeats with other plasmids) with lengths ex-
ceeding the insert size.

3.1 Datasets
Accession numbers and links to the datasets and reference genomes
are available in the Appendix.

3.1.1 Genomes with annotated plasmids

Table 2 describes six datasets that we used for benchmarking
PLASMIDSPADES (see the next section for a detailed description of all
columns). These datasets are composed from paired-end Illumina
reads (at least 100 bp in length) from Bacillus cereus ATCC-10987,
Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1, Providencia stuartii ATCC 33672,
Citrobacter freundii CFNIH1, Burkholderia cenocepacia DDS 22E-
1 and Corynebacterium callunae DSM 20147. These genomes,
abbreviated as Bce, Rsp, Pst, Cfr, Bcen and Cca, represent well
studied bacterial species with completed reference genomes and
annotated plasmids. The number of plasmids of different types in

these datasets varied from 0 for Bcen to 5 for Rsp. The average copy
numbers (estimated as coverage ratios) varied from 1.4 for Bce to
14.0 for Cfr. The lengths of plasmids varied from 4109 bp for Cca
to 272 297 bp for Cfr. Analysis of B. anthracis A1144 genome is
excluded from analysis in Table 2 since it has highly non-uniform
coverage.

Interestingly, plasmidSPAdes assembled an additional previously
unidentified short plasmid (5410 bp) in Cfr with high copy number
(14) that is not listed in Table 2. This plasmid has a high-scoring
BLAST hit to the plasmid pCAV1335-5410 in Klebsiella oxytoca
strain CAV1335 (alignment length 4454 and percent identity 99.9).

3.1.2 Genomes with unannotated plasmids

Table 4 describes ten datasets that we used for benchmarking
PLASMIDSPADES for the cases when the plasmids have not been anno-
tated yet (see the next section for a detailed description of all columns).
These datasets are composed from paired-end Illumina reads (at least
100 bp in length) from Acinetobacter sp. UNC434CL69Tsu2S25,
Butyrivibrio sp. INlla16, Lachnospiraceae bacterium NK3A20, Lutei
bacter sp.UNC1 38MFCol5 .1, Prevotellaceae bacterium HUN156,
Pseudoalteromonas sp. ND6B, Rhodococcus sp. J21, Ruminococcus
ﬂavefaciens YAD2003, Sphingomonas sp. UNC305MFC015.2 and
Thermus filiformis ATT43280. These genomes are abbreviated as Aci,
But, Lac, Lut, Pre, Pse, Rho, Rum, Sph and Tfi in Table 4. Datasets
Aci, But, Lac, Lut, Pre and Rum were downloaded from JGI read
archive while datasets Pse, Rho, Sph and Tfi were downloaded from
NCBIS SRA.

As Table 3 illustrates, SPADES and RECYCLER showed somewhat similar
results but RECYCLER generated more false positive plasmids.
PLASMIDSPADES detected more plasmids than SPAdes and RECYCLER but
often assembled them in multiple contigs rather than intact
plasmids. We believe that PLASMIDSPADES and RECYCLER may comple-
ment each other since PLASMIDSPADES focuses on sequencing data from
genomes of cultivated bacteria while RECYCLER focuses on plasmidome
and metagenome data. Appendix ‘Evaluating PLASMIDSPADES on anno-
tated plasmids’ provides additional information about this
benchmarking.

We boldfaced the putative plasmid composed of a single circular contig
(the edge representing the contig is a loop edge).

° Number of long contigs in each putative plasmid (shown in par-
enthesis) and the number of all contigs in each putative plasmid
(# contigs)

° Longest contig in each putative plasmid (max contig)

° Median coverage of the dataset (med cov)

° Coverage ratios for each putative plasmid, i.e. the coverage of
each putative plasmid divided by the median coverage (cov ratio)

° Conﬁrmation status (conf). A ‘Y’ indicates that the putative plas-
mids best blast hit to NCBI NT database was to a plasmid. A ‘N’
indicates that the best blast hit to NT database was identiﬁed
within a chromosome (for some related species). ‘N/A’ indicates
that there are no signiﬁcant matches to NCBI NT database. We
further analyzed all plasmids annotated as ‘N’ or ‘N/A’ and,
whenever possible, classiﬁed them as ‘N/A (plasmid)’, ‘N/A
(phage), ‘N/A (rRNA)’, ‘N (phage)’, or ‘N (mobile).’

In order to validate our results, we ran a blastn search of longest
contigs from putative plasmids constructed by PLASMIDSPADES
against the NCBI database of nonredundant nucleotides (NT). The
best BLAST hit, defined as the hit with the lowest e-value (ties are
broken by the highest bit score) for each putative plasmid compo-
nent from this search can be used to identify each of the compo-
nents. If the best hit for a component is to a plasmid sequence in the
NT database, then we classify it as a confirmed plasmid and mark
by Y in the last column of Table 4. We note that this confirmation
approach is unable to confirm still unknown plasmids that have lit-
tle similarity with known plasmids and so is prone to false
negatives.

To further investigate the putative plasmids marked as N/A, we
annotated them using RAST server (Aziz et al., 2008) to check if
they harbor plasmid-specific proteins. If RAST identified plasmid-
specific proteins, we labeled the corresponding putative plasmidic
component as ‘N/A (plasmid)’ to emphasize that it likely represents
a previously unknown plasmid. Interestingly, we found that some
putative plasmids annotated as ‘N/A’ or ‘N’ likely represent phages
(labeled as ‘N/A (phage)’ or ‘N (phage).’ Also, one of the putative
plasmids annotated as ‘N/A’ harbored an rRNA gene cluster
(labeled as ‘N/A (rRNA)’).

We also conducted further analysis of putative plasmids anno-
tated as ‘N’ and found that many of them are formed by mobile
elements that plasmidSPAdes failed to remove from the assembly
graph (labeled as ‘N (mobile)’).

3.2.3 Analyzing sequencing datasets with non-uniform read
coverage

To investigate why some datasets (like B. anthracis A1144 dataset)
have a rather non-uniform coverage, we ordered contigs along the B.
anthracis A1144 genome and represented each contig as a bar of
height equal to the coverage of this contigs. The resulting histogram
(Fig. 4) reveals a characteristic shape with the minimum around pos-
ition 2.5 Mb. The shape of the histogram in Figure 4 is similar to the
shape of the skew diagrams that are used for identifying the origin of
replication in bacterial genomes (Compeau and Pevzner, 2015). This
similarity between the histogram of coverage and the skew diagram
(albeit with a few outliers) suggests that the B. anthracis A1144 cul-
ture was sequenced in the growth phase when some cells have been
replicating. The abundance of replicating cells leads to the increased
coverage near the origin of replication (around position 0 Mb) and the
decreased coverage near the origin of termination (around position
2.5 Mb) in B. anthracis A1144. See Korem et al. (2015) for the link
between uneven coverage, rate of bacterial growth and the origin of
replication. Since the coverage of the B. anthracis A1144 dataset is
non-uniform, PLASMIDSPADES (run with the default parameter
maxDeviation=0.3) is unable to remove a significant fraction of
chromosomal edges in the assembly graph. Since the median coverage
of the B. anthracis A1 144 dataset is 130, PLASMIDSPADES only removes
the edges with coverage exceeding 169 thus retaining a large number
of chromosomal edges (Fig. 4). While increasing the maxDeviation
parameter to 0.4 or even higher removes nearly all chromosomal
edges, it also removes some plasmidic edges (B. anthracis A1144 has
two plasmids with coverage 135 and 183, respectively). This example
illustrates additional challenges in reconstructing plasmids from
sequencing datasets with highly non-uniform coverage.

4 Discussion

We described a novel PLASMIDSPADES algorithm for assembling plas-
mids from whole genome sequencing data. Since PLASMIDSPADES
does not require any specialized sample preparation to isolate plas-
mids, it has a potential to increase the throughput of plasmid discov-
ery. It thus complements a recently published approach mainly
aimed at analyzing plasmids after plasmid isolation (Carattoli et al.,
2014). As Table 3 illustrates, PLASMIDSPADES identifies eight plasmids
in ten randomly selected SRA dataset (three of them are not similar
to any previously identified plasmids). We thus expect that 10008 of
new plasmids will be identified when PLASMIDSPADES runs on all bac-
terial and achaeal SRA genome datasets.

PLASMIDSPADES uses coverage to remove chromosomal contigs
from the assembly while retaining the plasmid contigs. We have
demonstrated that in many cases it successfully removes over 99%
of the chromosomal contigs while retaining over 99% of the plasmid
contigs. However, PLASMIDSPADES has the following limitations:

° PLASMIDSPADES may misclassify contigs from plasmids with copy
numbers close to one as being chromosomal. However, in certain
cases, PLASMIDSPADES correctly assembles circular plasmids even
when they have similar coverage to the chromosome. For ex-
ample, an isolated cycle in the assembly graph is classiﬁed as a
putative plasmid irrespectively of its coverage.

° The ﬁltering procedure in PLASMIDSPADES relies on estimating a me-
dian chromosomal coverage. As long as the chromosomes are sig-
niﬁcantly larger than the total length of plasmids, PLASMIDSPADES

reliably separates edges in the assembly graph into chromosomal
and plasmidic. However, when chromosomes and plasmids are
comparable in size (like in the case of megaplasmids (Zheng et al.,
2013), ﬁltering based on the median coverage may fail.

° While the vast majority of plasmids are circular, some bacteria
harbour difﬁcult-to-detect linear plasmids. The performance of
PLASMIDSPADES deteriorates in the case of linear plasmids. For ex-
ample, PLASMIDSPADES assembled only one out of ten linear pas-
mids in Borrelia burgdorferi B31 (SRA accession number
SRR1772332) into a single contig.

° Since coverage of some short edges in the assembly graph signiﬁ-
cantly differ from the median coverage, PLASMIDSPADES may mis-
classify short chromosmal edges in the assembly graph as
plasmidic.

° Since chromosomes are typically much longer than plasmids, if
even a small portions of a chromosome is not ﬁltered out, the
small percent remaining can result in some false positive putative
plasmidic contigs.

In the future, we plan to improve and extend PLASMIDSPADES by add-

ing the following features:

° When two plasmids share highly similar sequences, they may as-
semble into the same connected component in the assembly
graph. However, If these plasmids have signiﬁcantly different
copy numbers, it may be possible to separate them from each
other by analyzing their coverage using methods similar to the
one described in Rozov et al. (2015). For example,
PLASMIDSPADES merged ﬁve annotated plasmids in Rsp genomes
into a single component in the plasmid graph (Table 2).
However, four of them feature signiﬁcantly different coverages,
which would permit the identiﬁcation of individual plasmids
from this connected component.

° Identiﬁcation of plasmidic contigs can be improved by analyzing
plasmid-diagnostic sequence features using methods similar to
Lanza et al. (2014). For example, because plasmids are often
self-regulated, they contain certain plasmid-speciﬁc genes to con-
trol their regulation. Similarly to PLACNET, these genes could
be used as the basis for plasmid classiﬁcation.

° Identiﬁcation of linear plasmids can be improved by using a less
aggressive approach to removing tips in the plasmid graph.

° The PLASMIDSPADES algorithm can be extended to sequencing
organellar genomes using the coverage arguments that were re-
cently applied to sequencing the spruce organelles (Jackman et al.,
2016) by combining Illumina and Paciﬁc Biosciences reads.

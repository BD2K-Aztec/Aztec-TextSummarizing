Abstract

Motivation: Single cell time—lapse microscopy is a powerful method for investigating heteroge—
neous cell behavior. Advances in microfluidic lab—on—a—chip technologies and live—cell imaging ren—
der the parallel observation of the development of individual cells in hundreds of populations pos—
sible. While image analysis tools are available for cell detection and tracking, biologists are still
confronted with the challenge of exploring and evaluating this data.

Results: We present the software tool Vizardous that assists scientists with explorative analysis and
interpretation tasks of single cell data in an interactive, configurable and visual way. With Vizardous,
lineage tree drawings can be augmented with various, time—resolved cellular characteristics.
Associated statistical moments bridge the gap between single cell and the population—average level.
Availability and implementation: The software, including documentation and examples, is avail—
able as executable Java archive as well as in source form at https://github.com/modsim/vizardous.

1 Introduction

Single cell analysis with time—lapse (ﬂuorescence) microscopy has
been widely established in the life sciences in recent years . Whereas
microarray analysis and ﬂow cytometry yield population level data
at a particular point in time, time—lapse live—cell imaging targets the
assessment of individual cell parameters with their spatial and tem—
poral (lineage) context. Microfluidic lab—on—chip technologies have
enabled the parallel cultivation of hundreds of cells over several gen—
erations (Nobs and Maerkl, 2014; Wang et 61]., 2010). Combined
with time—lapse imaging, it has been used, e.g. to study the dynamics
of cellular regulation mechanisms and stochasticity of metabolism
(Kiviet et 61]., 2014; Levine et 61]., 2013; Locke and Elowitz, 2009;
Young et 61]., 2012), to investigate cellular size homeostasis
(Campos et 61]., 2014; Taheri—Araghi et 61]., 2014) and phenotypic
heterogeneity in dependence of stressors as well as the detection of
rare events (Balaban et 61]., 2004; Rosenthal and Elowitz, 2012).

The easy availability of time—resolved data poses new challenges
on data analysis by the mere amounts and complexity of acquired
information. While several, typically organism—specific, image ana—
lysis tools are available for cell detection, feature extraction and
tracking tools for the generic task of analyzing and understanding
this information are lacking. We developed the software tool
Vizardous to assist researchers with the following single cell data
related tasks: (i) visualize data with single cell resolution in the lin-
eage context, (ii) visually detect emerging structural patterns such as
(a)symmetries in subtrees and (iii) assessing joint cellular properties
and structural motifs.

cellular development and to link time—resolved data to the tree
structures. Here, in particular a flexible ‘pattern and outlier’ detec—
tion based on spatio—temporal phenotypic observables of individual
cells is essential. Because the objectives in single cell analysis are not—
ably different from those in evolutionary biology, conventional soft—
ware tools for analyzing phylogenies are unsuitable in the single cell
domain (see Supplementary Table S2 for a characterization of se—
lected tools).

Vizardous is an open—source software that is designed as out—of—
the—box solution to deal with the data from live-cell imaging experi-
ments. The software is implemented using published methods and
available libraries wherever appropriate (see Table S3). Mother—
daughter relationships are provided in the standardized phyloXML
format (Han and Zmasek, 2009) and cellular characteristics (e.g.
cell length, area, volume, fluorescence reporter signal) as well as
population average information in the specially designed document
format MetaXML (cf. Supplement 5). An intuitive user interface en—
ables experimentalists to browse quantitative single cell data in the
lineage context. While the major use case of Vizardous is the visual—
ization of lineage trees, the underlying information can also be
acquired from the data models using an API (cf. Supplement 4)
which allows users with programming experience to script the data
analysis tasks directly with Java, Jython (www.jyth0n.0rg), or by
using the implemented export capabilities. Vizardous’ features are
summarized in Supplementary Table 81.

3 Vizardous exploration workflow

The most important analysis steps are explained with a representa—
tive evaluation workﬂow using pre—processed time—lapse videos of a
growing Corynehacterium glutamicmn population under transient
carbon limitation (for details see Supplement 1):

Step 1: Importing experimental data. Single cell data are read from
phyloXML and MetaXML ﬁle pairs containing lineage information
and ﬁgures about individual cells, respectively. One or more of such
ﬁle pairs can be imported from a local ﬁle system or an external
storage location, e.g. OMERO (Allan et al., 2012).

Step 2: Visualization of lineage trees. Lineage trees are generated
and visualized alongside population distributions for a complete
experiment or a speciﬁc time point (temporal slice). As an indica—
tor of population heterogeneity statistical moments (mean, SD) are
calculated for the selection.

Step 3: Highlighting individual cells. When screening for rare events
or outliers in populations, the highlighting of single cells in a lin-
eage tree according to cellular properties is especially useful. Two
different approaches are implemented:

1. Change the property of a lineage tree element (node or
branch) according to a speciﬁed cellular property, e.g. nodes
are sized according to the cell area.

2. Set a threshold for a cellular property and highlight all cells
that exceed the deﬁned value.

Step 4: Selecting cells for inspection. The user has the possibility to
interactively select (and deselect) individual cells of interest from
the lineage tree. The associated information is visualized in trace
charts (Fig. 1). These charts unlock the contextual interpretation
of feature dynamics along the temporal axis therewith bridging the
gap between the ancestral relationships of cells and their meta-
information.

Step 5: Exporting lineage trees and charts. The lineage trees and sin—
gle cell traces are fully customizable and exportable to publication
ready vector graphics (SVG) or bitmap formats (JPEG, PNG).
Additionally, the data underlying single cell traces can be saved to
tabular data formats (XLS, CSV) for further processing.

4 Results and conclusions

Vizardous has been used in several studies, e.g. (Binder et al., 2014;
Mustafi et al., 2014; Nanda et al., 2014; Probst et al., 2015), by sci—
entists with different backgrounds to answer a variety of scientific
questions. These and further case studies (cf. Supplementary Data)
show that Vizardous is a versatile tool that supports researchers in
various aspects with the discovery—driven, explorative analysis of
single cell experiments. By supporting additional input formats and
seamless integration with available bioimage analysis software we
anticipate that a range of fields including biological and medical sci—
ences will benefit in the future.

Abstract

The standard method used by high—throughput genome sequencing facilities for detecting misla—
belled samples is to use independently generated high—density SNP data to determine sample iden—
tity. However, as it has now become commonplace to have multiple samples sequenced from the
same source, such as for analysis of somatic variants using matched tumour and normal samples,
we can directly use the genotype information inherent in the sequence data to match samples and
thus bypass the need for additional laboratory testing. Here we present BAM—matcher, a tool that
can rapidly determine whether two BAM files represent samples from the same biological source
by comparing their genotypes. BAM—matcher is designed to be simple to use, provides easily inter—
pretable results, and is suitable for deployment at early stages of data processing pipelines.

1 Introduction

Sample mislabelling or mix-up is a common problem, particularly
in projects and facilities that have high sample throughput
(Koboldt et 61]., 2010), with several recent studies placing the error
rate at around 1% (Grimm et 61]., 2010). When working with
next generation sequencing (NGS) data, a mislabelled sample can
lead to incorrect data processing and analysis, resulting in conflict-
ing results or false conclusions. Even if the error is identified, valu—
able data resources have typically been wasted, delaying analysis or
diagnosis.

A common practice in major genome centres is to use custom
high density SNP panels to generate a SNP profile for each sample
(Koboldt et 61]., 2010), and SNP panels specifically designed for sam-
ple identification have recently become available commercially. The
principle behind these panels is to provide an independently

generated SNP profile of each sample that can be used for sample
matching.

However, as the cost of NGS technology has steadily decreased,
it has become affordable and commonplace for research laboratories
to sequence multiple samples from the same individual such as
for analysis of somatic variants using tumour and normal sam—
ples, monitoring disease progression using longitudinal samples, or
discovery of pathogenic variants in rare diseases using samples
from multiple individuals in the same family. As these NGS data
already contain significant amount of genotype information, we
can directly use these data for sample matching without expending
additional resources or sample material to perform additional
profiling.

To facilitate sample matching using existing NGS data, we have
developed BAM—matcher, a tool that provides rapid pair—wise

comparison of binary Sequence Alignment/Map (BAM) files (http://
samtools.github.io/hts—specs) by comparing the sample genotypes at
pre—determined genomic locations. BAM—matcher has the following
features: first, it is easy to use and can be deployed at early stages of
processing pipelines. Second, BAM—matcher is very fast: by limiting
genotype—calling to predetermined positions, a comparison between
two samples can be made in N2 min using the provided default set
of variants (Intel Xeon E5, 3.6 GHZ). As BAM—matcher caches sam—
ple genotype data, subsequent comparisons involving previously cal-
culated samples can be much faster (N1 s), thus significantly
reducing overall processing time for large cohorts. Third, BAM-
matcher is ﬂexible; it can compare different types of NGS data,
including whole—genome sequencing (WGS), whole—exome sequenc—
ing (WES) and RNA—sequencing (RNA—seq) data. If an appropriate
genome reference and suitable list of SNPs are provided, BAM—
matcher can also be used for non—human genomes.

2 Implementation and features

BAM-matcher is a Python command line tool (Python v2.7) for
Linux operating systems. It relies on external third party tools for
genotype calling, and currently supports the Genome Analysis
Toolkit (McKenna et al., 2010) and Freebayes (Garrison et al.,
2012)

The only sample—specific input data required by BAM—matcher
are mapped read data, thus it can be used at early stages of process—
ing pipelines to facilitate early detection of sample mislabelling. By
default, BAM—matcher compares sample genotypes at 1500 exonic
SNP sites extracted from the 1000 Genomes database (The 1000
Genomes Project Consortium, 2012) with global minor allele fre-
quencies between 0.45 and 0.55. If required, users can also substi—
tute a customised list of loci.

BAM—matcher can write the output report (Supplementary
Figure S1) to a file (TXT or HTML) or to the command line. A
short—form tab—separated output is also available, useful for batch
processing. Although 1500 SNPs were used for comparison, geno—
type comparison at any site is only carried out if the coverage is
above a depth threshold (default 15) in both samples, thus the re—
ported number of sites compared is typically fewer than 15 00. The
sub—classification of genotype discordance is particularly useful
when comparing WGS or WES data against RNA—seq data because
the latter can involve allele—specific expression (Supplementary
Text S1).

3 Results

To demonstrate the utility of BAM—matcher, we examined three sets
of NGS data: (i) WES data of 120 samples from 39 patients with at
least two samples from each individual, (ii) RNA—seq data of 63
samples from the same group of patients as (i), (iii) WES data of 53
samples belonging to 48 individuals from eight families. NimbleGen
SeqCap EZ Exome kit was used for exome enrichment in the WES
samples, and Illumina Ribo—Zero rRNA removal kit was used for
rRNA depletion in the RNA—seq samples. All samples were
sequenced on Illumina HiSeq platforms. Research involving human
tissue was conducted with institutional ethics review board approval
and in conformance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

Results from WES—versus—WES comparison (Fig. 1A) show a
clear demarcation between pairs of samples from the same individ-
ual (matching) and from different individuals (non-matching).
Matching samples shared >95 % identical genotype calls, which
reduced to ~80—95% if one of the samples involved had low

Fig. 1. Scatter plots showing results of (A) 7140 unique pair-wise compari-
sons between 120 BAM files representing samples from 39 individuals (‘LD’,
low depth, denotes comparisons involving samples with significantly lower
coverage than expected), (B) 1378 pair-wise comparisons between 53 BAM
files representing samples belonging to 48 individuals from 8 families. The fa-
milial relationships between samples are classified into ‘siblings', ‘parent—
child’, ‘related' and ‘unrelated’. ‘Related' includes all familial relationships
other than ‘siblings' and ‘parent—child'

coverage depth (marked ‘LD’, with average coverage of ~20>< com—
pared to typical ~70>< coverage). Non—matching samples only had
about ~30—5 0% common genotype calls. These results are consist—
ent with our choice of global allele frequencies of loci to compare
(Supplementary Text S2), and similar to the performance reported
for high-density SNP array (Koboldt et al., 2010).

BAM—matcher is also able to match WES samples with RNA—seq
samples (Supplementary Figure S2). However, the levels of genotype
identity are generally lower between matching WES—RNA—seq sam—
ples than matching WES samples due to allele—specific expression in
RNA—seq data, and more careful examination of the results may be
necessary for some samples (Supplementary Text S1).

BAM—matcher can also identify familial relationships be—
tween samples, as shown by the results for familial samples
(Fig. 1B). For this type of application, better separation between dif—
ferent groups can be achieved if more sites are used (Supplementary
Figure S3).

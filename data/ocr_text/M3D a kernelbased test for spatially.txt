Abstract

Motivation: DNA methylation is an intensely studied epigenetic mark implicated in many biological
processes of direct clinical relevance. Although sequencing—based technologies are increasingly
allowing high—resolution measurements of DNA methylation, statistical modelling of such data is
still challenging. In particular, statistical identification of differentially methylated regions across
different conditions poses unresolved challenges in accounting for spatial correlations within the
statistical testing procedure.

Results: We propose a non—parametric, kernel—based method, M3D, to detect higher order changes
in methylation profiles, such as shape, across pre—defined regions. The test statistic explicitly ac—
counts for differences in coverage levels between samples, thus handling in a principled way a
major confounder in the analysis of methylation data. Empirical tests on real and simulated data—
sets show an increased power compared to established methods, as well as considerable robust—

 

ness with respect to coverage and replication levels.

1 Introduction

DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark associated with many fun—
damental biological processes of direct clinical relevance, such as
imprinting, retrotransposon silencing and cell differentiation
(Gopalakrishnan et 61]., 2008; Laurent et 61]., 2010). Methylation
occurs when a methyl group is attached to a cytosine. In mammals,
methylation is observed predominantly in the CpG conteXt, and,
consequently, studies tend to focus on these loci. The canonical
understanding is that methylation of CpG regions in promoter re-
gions (CGIs) is associated with gene silencing; however, recent stud—
ies have shown that CpG methylation correlates with gene
expression in a more complex and context—dependent manner
(Varley et 61]., 2013). Methylation profiles are altered in many dis-
eases, most notably cancer (Das and Singal, 2004; Sharma et 61].,
2010), and as such epigenetic therapies are being developed, which
specifically target methylation (Yang et 61]., 2010).

Bisulfite treatment of DNA followed by next—generation
sequencing provides quantitative methylation data with base pair
resolution. Unmethylated cytosines are deaminated into uracils,
which amplify as thymines during PCR (Krueger et 61]., 2012). Reads
are then aligned to a reference genome, permitting changes of C to
T. The resulting counts of cytosine and thymine at registered cyto—
sine loci form the basis of further analysis. This general procedure
has been adapted in various ways, with reduced representation
bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) being one of the most widely used.
RRBS involves using a restriction enzyme such as MspI (or Tan) to
cleave the DNA at CCGG (or TCGA) loci and selecting short reads
for sequencing (Gu et 61]., 2011). This results in greater coverage of
CpG dense regions at lower cost.

Several methods have been proposed to statistically test for dif—
ferentially methylated region (DMRs). Almost all these methods per—
form a search for DMRs by testing individual cytosines followed by

a post hoc aggregation procedure. Early methylation studies used
Fisher’s exact test (FET) to identify differentially methylated cyto—
sines (DMCs) (Li et al., 2010; Challen et al., 2012). BSmooth
(Hansen et al., 2012), one of the most widely used methods, per—
forms local likelihood smoothing to generate methylation profiles
for each sample, before testing individual locations in the profiles to
identify DMCs. More recent methods, such as BiSeq (Hebestreit
et al., 2013) and methylSig (Park et al., 2014), also employ local
smoothing, together with a beta—binomial model of methylation at
individual cytosines; both of these methods then aggregate the re—
sults of tests at individual loci to compute a measure of significance
for DMRs. The beta—binomial method models biological variability
at each cytosine location and hence requires a high replication level
to achieve power. Coverage can also be problematic, as low cover—
age precludes statistical significance and high coverage can lead to
over-confidence in calling DMRs, although the latter effect can be
ameliorated by having a larger number of replicates. For instance,
methylSig requires a minimum of three replicates per group and ig—
nores loci which are covered by fewer than 10 reads by default. A re—
cent method, MAGI (Baumann and Doerge, 2014), takes a different
approach by testing directly for DMRs, rather than computing region-
wide measures of significance from tests of individual cytosines.
MAGI assumes the availability of genome—wide decision boundary
methylation levels (which can be determined either from annotation
or in a data—driven fashion). Methylation levels at each cytosine are
then given a binary representation based on whether they exceed the
decision boundary, and a single FET is performed over each region by
counting how many cytosines have changed state.

Although these methods can be highly effective, no current
method explicitly accounts for spatial covariation (MAGI implicitly
assumes spatial homogeneity across a region). DNA methylation
levels are often strongly spatially correlated: accounting for such
correlations in a testing procedure could then lead to considerable
increases in statistical power. Some examples of spatially correlated
changes in the ENCODE data analysed in Section 3.2 are shown in
Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 1; notice that in all these ex—
amples, the change at individual cytosines is modest, and hence
these regions would not be called as DMRs by currently existing
methods. We remark that, although local smoothing methods like
BSmooth (Hansen et al., 2012) attempt to capture spatial coherence,
the local coherence is not an integral part of the testing procedure.
Smoothing in this setting serves the dual purposes of filtering noise
and highlighting large-scale changes in the methylation profile.
Moreover, the shape of the methylation profile has been suggested
as an important factor in predicting gene expression (VanderKraats
et al., 2013), leading to a potentially functional role for methylation
patterns. To our knowledge, there are no methods that test higher
order properties, such as shape, of the methylation profiles over a
region.

Here, we present maximum mean methylation discrepancy
(M3D), a non—parametric statistical test for identifying DMRs from
pre—defined regions, explicitly accounting for shape changes in
methylation profiles. Our method is based on the maximum mean
discrepancy (MMD), a recent technique from the machine learning
literature, which tests whether two samples have been generated
from the same probability distribution (Gretton et al., 2007, 2012).
Similar non—parametric tests have already been applied to ChIP—Seq
and RNA—Seq data (Schweikert et al., 2013; Drewe et al., 2013).
Our contribution is to adapt the method for the specific challenges
of bisulfite sequencing data, introducing an explicit control for con-
founding changes in coverage levels. Our method is used to test for
changes in methylation profiles across regions, as opposed to

individual cytosines, and we call as DMRs those regions whose vari—
ation cannot be explained by inter—replicate variability. We demon—
strate the performance of M3D against existing methods on real and
simulated data, showing a considerable increase in power and im-
proved robustness against reduced replication and coverage levels.

2 Methods

The M3D method is designed to analyse aligned methylation data.
Rather than testing individual cytosines and pooling them into puta—
tive DMRs, M3D considers changes in the methylation profile’s
shape over a given region. To quantify shape changes, we compute
the MMD over each region and adjust it to account for changes in
the coverage profile across samples. Finally, we use a data—driven
approach to compare test statistics based on the empirical likelihood
of observing between—group differences among replicates. We re—
strict our analysis to Cst only and combine data from both
strands.

Selecting which regions to test is an important feature of a differ—
ential methylation study and must reﬂect the specific question being
asked. Regions can either be pre—defined, such as a list of promoter
regions, or generated from the data by selecting regions of dense
Cst (clusters) as in (Hebestreit et al., 2013). We keep this as a flex—
ible option and instead focus on a general framework for region-
based methylation analysis.

2.1 Maximum mean discrepancy

Formally, the MMD is defined as follows. Let .7: be a class of func-
tions f : X —> R over a metric space X with Borel probability meas—
ures p, q. We define the MMD as

MMDIT-apaql = 3:; (Eplf(x)l —quf(x)l) <1)

Intuitively, we are finding the mean over a bounded function that
maximizes the difference between the probability distributions. For
a sufficiently dense function class, this is equal to 0 if, and only if,
p = q. Choosing .7: to be the unit ball in a reproducing kernel Hilbert
space (RKHS) on X provides a searchable class of functions that re—
tains this result (Gretton et al., 2007). For x, x’ —independent random
variables with distribution p and y, y’—independent random variables
with distribution q, the square of the MMD becomes:

MMDZIJ'U 1?: 6II = Epra x’)l — 2Fatal/€067 WI + qu1€(% y’)l (2)

In practice, for X : {x1, ...., xm}, Y : {y1,. . ., yn} observations inde—
pendently and identically distributed from p and q, respectively, we
can compute a sample—based approximation to the MMD metric,
giving rise to a feature representation in the RKHS, as

methylation status of that C,- on one mapped read, x,- : (Ci, Methi).
Thus, there are as many x,s in a dataset as the number of mapped
cytosines (within a CpG context). To define an MMD between data—
sets, we need to define a kernel function operating on pairs of vectors
x,, x,- to evaluate Equation (3). A natural choice is a composite kernel
given by the product of a radial basis function (RBF) kernel on the
genomic location and a string kernel on the methylation status:

kfu11(xz,xj) = kRBF(xiaxi)kSTR(xiax/') (4)
Where kRBF(x,-,x,-) : exp[—(C,- — Ci)2/202] (5)
1,  Meth,‘ = Methl-
and kSTR(x,-,x,-) = (6)
0, otherwise

The RBF kernel, kRBF(x,-, xi) retains spatial information at a scale
determined by the hyper—parameter 0', which corresponds to the dis—
tance along the genome that displays methylation correlation. We
model this parameter independently for each region, R, to reﬂect the
local correlation structure, as 01% = f2 / 2, for x E R, a heuristic sug—
gested in (Gretton et al., 2012). Here, X refers to the median distance
of all observations in region R across the datasets being compared.
MMD distances computed using the above procedure would capture
both differences in coverage profiles and differences in methylation
profiles. A particular challenge of bisulfite sequencing data, and a cen—
tral tenet of the RRBS procedure (Gu et al., 2011), is that the fre—
quency with which a cytosine site is tested (the coverage) is unrelated
to the methylation status. This poses a challenge in all bisulfite
sequencing analysis, as the sampling distribution becomes a confound—
ing factor in our attempt to understand methylation. We control for
changes in the coverage profile by subtracting the analogous MMD of
the coverage; the M3D metric is then given by:

M3D[X, Y] = MMD[X, Y,lefu11] — MMD[X, Y, lam] (7)

where lefull and kRBF(x,-, xi) are as described in Equations (4) and (5)
and the MMD terms are as in Equation (3). Henceforth, we refer to

the first term, MMD[X, Y,/efu11] as the ‘full MMD’ and the second
term, MMD [X , Y, kRBF], as the ‘coverage MMD’ for convenience.

The last term in Equation (7) represents the MMD of the data on
a methylation—blind subspace. This implies that, in the large sample
limit when the sample estimate of the MMD converges to the exact
MMD of Equation (1), the M3D statistic is non—negative.

The M3D statistic will therefore be different from zero when
there is a change in the methylation profile, independently of a
change in the coverage profile. As a consequence, M3D between rep—
licate RRBS experiments (which do not necessarily have identical
coverage) should be close to zero or, equivalently, the full MMD
should be equal to the coverage MMD. This is borne out in the
data; the metrics strongly agree over replicates. Testing equality of
metrics over 102 ENCODE RRBS datasets gives an R2 of 0.95. This
can be seen in Supplementary Figure 2; specific examples can also be
seen in Figures 2(a—c) and 4(a—c), where the dense region around the
diagonal represents unchanged DMRs with M3D close to zero.

2.3 P—value calculation

We use the M3D as a test statistic by comparing the values observed
across groups to those observed between replicates. We define our
null distribution as the observed M3D values over all the testing re—
gions between all replicate pairs. For a given region r, we compute
the mean, u, of the M3D values over all sample pairs across testing
groups for r. The P value for r is the probability of observing u, or
higher among the null distribution. We use the Benjamini—Hochberg
procedure to calculate false discovery rates (FDRs), rejecting clusters
at a 1% significance level (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). Because
each test corresponds to an entire region, this correction is less puni-
tive than methods testing each cytosine location.

In general, we calculate the P value empirically. In order for the
method to scale, we also provide a model—based approximation by
fitting an exponential distribution to the 95th percentile of the null
distribution. P values are calculated in the same manner using the
fitted exponential. An example is shown in Supplementary Figure 3.

At a given FDR cut-off, identifying DMRs amounts to identify—
ing a threshold M3D value, tde and calling all regions r with
It, > tfdr. We find the empirical method to be marginally more ac—
curate (Fig. 3) and report results with empirically calculated P values
for the rest of this paper.

3 Datasets

We benchmarked the M3D method on a simulated dataset and two
real datasets. We brieﬂy describe here the two real datasets and the
simulation procedure used. Summary statistics and figures of the
testing regions are shown in Section 4 of the Supplementary Data.

3.1 Simulated data

To benchmark the ability of our method to detect true changes with—
out introducing false positives, we resort to a simulation study. To
simulate methylation profile changes with realistic statistics, we con—
structed our simulation from a real RRBS dataset.

We used an RRBS dataset of human embryonic stem cells,
H1-hESC (described in the following section), consisting of two
replicates. Dense CpG regions were identified using the procedure
by Hebestreit et al., (2013), and for simplicity, we focused on
the first 1000 on chromosome 1. We then simulated two more repli—
cates to act as our testing group, as described in Section 5 of
the Supplementary Data. The coverage statistics for the result—
ing dataset have a mean of 34.5 and a median coverage of 23

and with simulated changes (red), log scale

at each CpG site. We then selectively altered the methylation profile
of randomly chosen regions in the simulated replicates to create
known methylation changes and used the M3D method to test for
DMRs.

To simulate methylation changes, we randomly selected 250 of
the CpG clusters out of a possible 1000. We selected a short region
within each cluster, at least 100—bp long and with a total coverage of
at least 100, in each replicate. If necessary, we increased the size of
the region until it occupied at least 11 CpG sites, where n was uni—
formly sampled from [4,20]. The methylation level, Lfld, was calcu—
lated at each cytosine site, C,- as the proportion of all the data points
mapping to that site that were methylated. We measured the mean
methylation of the sites and created a simulated methylation level,
Lilcw, by hyper-methylating the region if it was <5 0% methylated
on average and hypo—methylating it otherwise. The degree of methy—
lation change was controlled by a parameter or E [0, 1], such that the
new methylation level Lilew : (1 — oc)L:-)ld —I— or if the region was being
hyper—methylated and Lilew : (1 — oc)L§-)ld if it was being hypo—
methylated. To vary the strength of methylation change, we tested
the methods different values of alpha.

Simulated data were then created by sampling data points
{x1,. . .,x,,,.} at site C,- with corresponding {Meth1,. . ., Methni}
sampled with probability [)(Methi : methylated) : ijw, where n,-
is the coverage at location C,-. Pseudocode for creating simulated
data is shown in Section 5 of the Supplementary Data.

3.2 Human data

To test the M3D method on real data, we compared two Tier 1
tracks from the ENCODE consortium, GEO series GSE275 84
(ENCODE Project Consortium et al., 2012). RRBS data from
human embryonic stem cells, H1—hESC, were compared against leu—
kaemia cells, K562. Both datasets were produced by the Myers Lab
at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology. The data are avail—
able pre—processed and aligned to the hg19 genome, and we used the
resulting BED files. H1-hESC cells came from a human male and
K562 from a female, so sex chromosomes were removed from the
analysis. Testing regions were defined by clustering CpG sites in the
same manner as for the simulations, and regions with no coverage in

each method, reflecting the proportion of regions called at each FDR. From
highest to lowest, we see M3D with empirical P-values, M3D with modelled
P-values and MAGI. AUCs for the methods are 0.99, 0.96 and 0.77, respectively

at least one sample were excluded from the analysis; this resulted in
14,104 genomic regions for testing.

To investigate the relationship between differential methylation
and gene expression, we used the corresponding 200—bp paired end
RNA—seq data for H1—ESC and K562 cells available in release 4 of
the ENCODE consortium (ENCODE Project Consortium et al.,
2012). Reads were aligned using TopHat and gene expression esti—
mates in fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped
reads (FPKM) were produced with Cufflinks (Trapnell et al., 2012).
Gene expression estimates were averaged across the three replicates
within each group and analysis was performed on the resulting
changes across groups.

3.3 Mouse data

We compared a 4 replicate data RRBS data set from mouse strain
B6C ESCs (GEO: GSE56572, Booth et al., 2014) to a 3 replicate
data set consisting from sciatic nerve cells from postnatal day 10
(P10) mice (GEO: GSE45343, Varela—Rey et al., 2014). To define
testing regions, we used the list of exons for Mus musculus provided
by Ensembl in release 75 (Flicek et al., 2013). We excluded any
exon regions with no coverage in one of the ESC cell samples or
with <5 CpG sites in total, leaving 2359 regions in total. Again,
data from both strands were combined. The median coverage at the
remaining CpG loci was 24 for the ESCs and 11 for the P10 sciatic
nerve cells.

4 Results

4.1 Simulations

We first benchmarked our method on a realistic simulated dataset
generated as described in Section 3.1. Results were compared
against BSmooth and MAGI. BiSeq and methylSig were also con—
sidered; however, because the dataset had lower replication than the
minimum recommended by the authors, we decided not to use them.
BSmooth was designed for whole—genome bisulfite sequencing
(WGBS) data; to adapt the method to RRBS data, we followed the
authors’ suggestion and altered the maximum allowable distance be—
tween neighbouring cytosines before smoothing (bioconductor mail—
ing list: https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/bioconductor/2013—February/
051020.html). Details for implementation of BSMooth and MAGI
are provided in Section 6 of the Supplementary Data.

overall change being smaller, M3D retains good performance by considering
spatial correlations in the data.

Figure 2 summarizes the results obtained with the methylation
strength parameter or (see Section 3.1) set to 1. Of the 250 differently
methylated regions, the M3D method called 232, with no falsely
called DMRs. Figures 2(a—c) show scatterplots of coverage MMD
on the y axis versus full MMD on the x axis for all 1000 regions,
with colours denoting the results of the testing procedure using the
different statistics. Individual regions are represented as circles, col—
oured according to whether the region was a true positive (green), a
false positive (red), a false negative (blue) or a true negative (black).
As discussed before, changes in methylation are likely to occur for
regions that are mapped far from the diagonal. The figures show a
clear cluster of regions about the diagonal (the unchanged regions)
and a clearly identifiable group with much larger full MMD (the
changed regions). Figure 2a shows the results of the testing proced—
ure using the M3D statistic. As we see, M3D correctly identifies
most of the 250 simulated changes. Receiver—operating characteristic
(ROC) curves are shown in Figure 3. Note that BSmooth is omitted
as the method does not test regions as a whole, rather identifies
groups of DMCs within the region and hence does not output a rele—
vant statistic for comparison.

We present the results of BSmooth and MAGI in same frame-
work in Figure 2(b and c). BSmooth correctly called 67 of the re—
gions with an additional 10 false positives, typically calling regions
with similar coverage profile, which we expect is due to the effect of
local likelihood smoothing. Figure 2b shows the BSmooth results; as
we see, even regions with very marked shape differences (as quanti—
fied by M3D) were missed, which is to be expected as BSmooth does
not include spatial correlations in the testing procedure. MAGI
called 211 of the regions correctly, with two false positives (the FDR
was set to 1%). Figure 2c shows that while many of the regions
missed had a low M3D statistic, this was not always the case and
there is not a simple relationship between the two methods indicat—
ing that the M3D method performs a genuinely different computa—
tion, as opposed to simply being more powerful. A histogram of the
M3D test statistic is shown in Figure 2d for the replicates and the
cross—group comparisons. The empirical testing distribution is
shown in blue and is seen to be consistent around zero and sharply
peaked. The simulated DMRs are easily distinguished.

We then investigated the sensitivity of our method by systematic—
ally altering the strength of the methylation changes using

or = 1, 0.8, 0.6 and 0.4. We compared the M3D method with
BSmooth and MAGI and our results are listed in Table 1. The M3D
method maintains a very creditable performance level for all the or
values. This is due to the fact that neighbouring cytosines are being
altered, and hence there are spatial correlations in the changes. Were
the changes scattered randomly in the region M3D performance
would weaken, whereas MAGI would remain robust. The sudden
dip in performance of MAGI at or = 0.4 is due to fewer of the cyto—
sines’ methylation levels crossing the threshold value. It is remark—
able that at all levels of 0c the use of the M3D statistic does not lead
to any type I errors, though we note that the other methods have
consistent type 2 error levels across these tests.

To assess the sensitivity of the various methods to spatial correl—
ations, we ran a further simulation, this time adding a ‘Gaussian bump’
of to the methylation profiles of the regions, at randomly chosen loca—
tions, with varying widths and strengths. Details are described in
Section 5 of the Supplementary Data. Here, we found a more marked
contrast in the performance of the methods, which we show in Table 2.
ROC curves are shown in Section 7 of the Supplementary Data.

4.2 Human data

We now describe the results of comparing two human datasets gener—
ated by the ENCODE consortium (see Section 3.2). We focus on three
aspects: a general comparison of results between M3D and BSmooth,
an analysis of the robustness of the results with respect to the
coverage and an analysis of the functional relevance of our results.

4.3 DMR detection

Out of the 14,104 CpG regions selected for testing (see Section 3.2),
M3D identified 4137 DMRs, and BSmooth and MAGI identified 1649
and 3101 DMRs, agreeing on 1328 and 2353 of the regions, respect—
ively. In Figure 4, we present the results in the same form as Figure 2,
where we again see that the M3D method produces genuinely different
results. Figure 4a shows the method applied to the replicates only,
where the methylation—blind and aware metrics agree. Figure 4(b and c)
show the results of between—group testing by M3D and BSmooth,
respectively. The data have a striking similarity to Figure 2a; this sug-
gests that, on this real dataset, the M3D statistic provides an excellent
measure of changes in methylation profiles. Similar to the simulated
dataset, BSmooth does not behave in a consistent manner with respect
to the M3D test statistic and many CpG clusters are missed (Fig. 4c). A
histogram of the M3D test statistics is shown in Figure 4d, again
confirming that the M3D statistics identifies a clear group of changed
profiles between the two conditions. Comparisons to MAGI are shown
in Section 8 of the Supplementary Data.

4.3.1 Robustness to low coverage
To test the consistency of the M3D method to low coverage, we
simulated a reduction in the coverage levels of the H1—hESC and

K5 62 data. We discarded at random reads for the datasets to simu—
late a reduction in coverage by 75%, 50% and 25% in both data—
sets. The M3D method was used to find DMRs, and the results were
compared across coverage levels; to alleviate the computational bur—
den, we only considered CpG regions on chromosome 1.

Of the 1345 CpG clusters on chromosome 1, the M3D method
identified 403 DMRs. Reducing coverage to 75%, 5 0% and 25 % of
the original level, the method identified 395, 399 and 386 DMRs,
respectively, with 0, 1 and 1 DMRs not in the original set. To see
the consistency of the calls, we show a Venn diagram in Figure 5.
There is a strong overlap in the calls at all levels, indicating robust—
ness in the method. Interestingly, although fewer regions are called
at lower coverage levels, at each stage we do not see many new re—
gions being called as might be expected. Although the empirical test—
ing distribution is less accurate, the structure remains intact. Both
BSmooth and MAGI showed similar consistency, although the num—
ber of regions called was lower in both cases. Results are shown in
Section 9 of the Supplementary Data.

4.3.2 Functional analysis of differential methylation regions
To investigate the functional relevance of our results, we interpreted
the called DMRs in terms of the functional annotation and expres—
sion level of nearby genes. We used three sets of genomic regions,
gene bodies, first exons and promoters; gene and exon regions were
downloaded from Ensembl release 75 (Flicek et al., 2013) and pro—
moter regions were defined as being 2000 bp upstream from the
transcription start site. Tests were run on gene, promoter and first
exon regions separately. We excluded regions with fewer than 5
Cst and tested the remaining regions for changes in the methyla-
tion profiles using the M3D method.

As the M3D method provides a measure of the strength, but not
direction of the methylation profile change, we measured the cross
group expression change as the absolute value of the FPKM log—fold

change and excluded all genes with <100 FPKM in one sample to
avoid noise at low expression levels.

We identified 8747 gene body regions with sufficient expression
and CpG content; among these, the M3D method called 404 as
DMRs. We tested the absolute log—fold changes in expression be—
tween called and uncalled regions with a Wilcoxon rank—sum test
and found the former was higher (P value: 2.2 x 10‘“). Similarly,
103 of 4916 promoter regions were called as DMRs and showed an
associated higher absolute log—fold expression change (Wilcoxon
rank—sum test, P value: 1.18 X 10T6). Rather more first exon regions
were tested, with 411 of 19473 regions being called as DMRs.
Again, there was an associated increase in the log—fold expression
change (Wilcoxon rank—sum test, P value: 2.2 X 10‘“). None of the
411 first exon DMRs were in the gene bodies of the gene region test—
ing group, hence this is not a duplicate result. The median log—fold
expression change for genes associated with uncalled regions was
0.15 for gene, promoter and first exon regions. In genes associated
with called promoter regions, this rose to 0.24, and in genes and first
exon regions, the median was 0.37 and 0.34, respectively
(Supplementary Figure 12). These results support earlier studies out—
lining a stronger link between methylation in the first exon, as
opposed the promoter region and gene expression (Brenet et al.,
2011)

We performed an enrichment analysis for gene ontology (GO)
terms using the Ontologizer software for the gene, promoter and
first exon regions separately (Bauer et al., 2008). In each case, the
population group was chosen to be the set of genes associated with
the regions being tested, i.e. those with sufficient coverage and CpG
counts, and the study group was the set of genes associated with the
called regions. For this study, we examined the DMRs called by the
M3D method against all the regions tested, independently of
gene expression data. We used parent—child analysis and adjusted
P values according with a Benjamini—Hochberg procedure at
10% FDR.

For the gene regions, we tested 2,692 called genes against 15,321
tested genes resulting in 208 GO terms being called. Among these,
GO terms for embryonic morphogenesis, organ formation, growth,
developmental growth, regulation of cell differentiation, pattern
specification process and cell fate commitment were discovered, as
might be expected in a comparison between ESCs and fully mature
K5 62 cells. This suggests a connection between gene body methyla—
tion and cell function.

The first exon group was smaller, with 1,087 called gene associ—
ations in a population of 10,811. Thirty—one GO terms were statis—
tically significantly enriched. Twenty—four of these terms were also
enriched in the gene region analysis. Again, terms associated with
cell differentiation, such as cell fate specification and cell fate com—
mitment, were observed. This is striking, because these first exons
were not in gene bodies of the gene testing regions.

The promoter group had 506 gene associations called out of a
population of 8,114. Interestingly, we found no statistically signifi-
cantly enriched GO terms in the analysis. The top 10 enriched GO
terms, by statistical significance, are shown in Supplementary Tables
1, 2 and 3 in Section 11 for the three types of genomic regions
tested.

4.4 Mouse data

To examine the robustness of the M3D statistic to changes in repli—
cation, we considered a comparison between two mouse datasets
with larger replication, the ESCs dataset of (Booth et al., 2014) with
four replicates and the neural dataset of Varela—Rey et al. (2014)

Fig. 5. Venn diagram of calls with reduced coverage. Three-hundred eighty-
two calls are consistent at all coverage levels. The method misses clusters at
lower coverage levels, yet it does not call many DMRs that were not identified
at higher coverage levels

with three replicates. Robustness to low replication is important; as
remarked before, although many methods require at least three rep-
licates in each dataset, many experimental protocols (including al-
most all the ENCODE RRBS data) provide only two replicates. We
used the M3 D method to identify DMRs with three and with two
ESC replicates, and compared the set to those identified with the full
four ESC replicate sets. DMRs were identified at a 1 % FDR.

Of the 2359 exon regions tested, the M3Ds method identified
689, 676 and 609 with methylation profiles that differed signifi-
cantly with respect to inter-replicate variation with 4, 3 and 2 repli-
cates in the ESC group, respectively. As is shown in Figure 6, the
overlap between the three sets of called regions accounts for almost
90% of the total. Importantly, although the testing lost power with
lower replication (as can be expected), only one additional region
was called, indicating that the method does not introduce many false
positives with reduced replication levels.

4.5 Computing times

We report the running times for non-parallel implementations of all
methods on the dataset used in Sections 3.2 and 4.3. This dataset
represents a complete RRBS experiment consisting of 14,104 testing
regions. On an ordinary desktop PC, MAGI took N30S, BSmooth
took almost 6 min (including smoothing) and M3D took N2 h. The
M3D algorithm is linear in the number of testing regions and com-
binatorial in the number of replicates.

5 Discussion

We proposed the first kernel-based test for DMRs which exploits
higher order spatial features of methylation profiles. Empirical com-
parisons on simulated and real data show a considerable increase in
statistical power in comparison with the widely used BSmooth
method (Hansen et al., 2012), as well as considerable robustness to
low coverage and low replication. The M3D method also outper-
forms MAGI (Baumann and Doerge, 2014) in our simulations, as
well as calling more DMRs in the real dataset, though this comes at
a computational cost.

The increased power of the M3D approach is due to a number of
factors. Firstly, the method is sensitive to spatially correlated
changes in methylation profiles. Methylation profiles are known to
be highly spatially correlated in general, and the results of our ex-
periments imply that spatial correlation is also a feature of

 

ilirp»

and two replicates for ESC cell control group

differences in methylation profiles between conditions, at least in
the datasets considered. Secondly, the method explicitly accounts
for differences in the coverage profiles between conditions, a con-
founding factor for other methods, as demonstrated in Figure 2.
Thirdly, the method models inter-replicate variability on a regional
basis along the whole genome. Each regional cross-group methyla-
tion change is compared with this distribution, and test statistics for
each region represent how well the change in methylation profiles
can be explained by inter-replicate variability. At present, other
methods that consider inter-replicate variability do so on a CpG
site-by-site basis, which lacks power with low replication and cover-
age and does not consider regional, spatial changes. When testing
the method with different strengths of methylation change at CpG
loci, we saw a sharp decrease in the number of regions being called
as the methylation profile change over the regions became compar-
able to inter-replicate variability. Other methods experienced a less
pronounced change in this regard.

Other studies have suggested that changes in shape of methyla-
tion profiles are important in predicting gene expression
(VanderKraats et al., 2013). To test whether our method is able to
capture functionally important changes in methylation profiles, we
performed gene expression analysis with human data and showed a
link between methylation changes called by the M3D method and
gene expression changes between conditions. Further, the results
support the hypothesis that gene expression is more closely linked to
methylation in the first exon of a gene than to methylation in pro-
moter regions (Brenet et al., 2011). GO analysis of first exon and
whole gene methylation changes both revealed links to cell function,
despite none of the exons overlapping the gene regions, a result that
was not apparent for promoter methylation changes. Although our
findings confirm a potential role for methylation profile shape as a
predictor of gene expression, they do not provide biological mechan-
isms for linking methylation shape to gene expression and regula-
tion. Although sequence variants and protein binding have been
shown to be predictive of epigenetic variability (Gertz et al., 2011;
Benveniste et al., 2014), we believe that further investigation of the
mechanistic underpinnings of changes in methylation shape could be
a valuable direction for research.

The M3 D method provides a considerable increase in power over
existing methods, yet it comes at the cost of computational intensity.
In this study, we have restricted comparisons to datasets of low rep-
lication, as beta-binomial methods should prove effective with
higher replication. We have also focused on sub-megabase scale
changes for two reasons. Firstly, such an analysis is likely to be ex-
ploratory, in the sense that testing regions are not pre-defined, a key

requirement for our method, and secondly, because BSmooth has
proved adept at identifying large—scale changes in this setting and is
computationally cheaper.

The M3D framework was developed with RRBS data in mind,
yet, given its robustness to lower coverage, we expect that it may
also be well suited for WGBS data. In the future, it will be interest—
ing to develop models that explain the predictive power of methyla—
tion profiles in terms of other epigenetic marks.

Abstract

Motivation: Similarity search is the foundation of bioinformatics. It plays a key role in establishing
structural, functional and evolutionary relationships between biological sequences. Although the
power of the similarity search has increased steadily in recent years, a high percentage of sequences
remain uncharacterized in the protein universe. Thus, new similarity search strategies are needed to
efficiently and reliably infer the structure and function of new sequences. The existing paradigm for
studying protein sequence, structure, function and evolution has been established based on the as—
sumption that the protein universe is discrete and hierarchical. Cumulative evidence suggests that
the protein universe is continuous. As a result, conventional sequence homology search methods
may be not able to detect novel structural, functional and evolutionary relationships between pro—
teins from weak and noisy sequence signals. To overcome the limitations in existing similarity search
methods, we propose a new algorithmic framework—Enrichment of Network Topological Similarity
(ENTS)—to improve the performance of large scale similarity searches in bioinformatics.

Results: We apply ENTS to a challenging unsolved problem: protein fold recognition. Our rigorous
benchmark studies demonstrate that ENTS considerably outperforms state—of—the—art methods. As
the concept of ENTS can be applied to any similarity metric, it may provide a general framework
for similarity search on any set of biological entities, given their representation as a network.

1 Introduction

Recent advances in whole—genome sequencing and high—throughput
techniques have generated a vast amount of sequence and omics data.
One critical bottleneck in the post—genome era is the discernment of
the biological meaning of uncharacterized sequences in the context of
complex phenotypes. Similarity search, as the foundation of bioinfor-
matics, plays a key role in establishing structural, functional and evo—
lutionary relationships between biological sequences. In the case of

protein function annotation and structure determination, although
the power of the similarity search has increased steadily in recent
years, the protein universe still contains a high percentage of ‘dark
matter’, which consists of proteins that cannot be characterized by
existing experimental or computational techniques (Levitt, 2009).
Thus, new similarity search strategies are needed to identify homologs
of new sequences efficiently and reliably and to infer their structures
and functions in the context of biological systems via integrating het—
erogeneous omics data.

New method to improve network topological similarity search

2107

 

An increasing body of evidence suggests that protein space is
continuous in general, although there exist discrete islands
(Berezovsky and Trifonov, 2001; Efimov, 1997; Kolodny et 61].,
2006; Lupas et 61]., 2001; Nepomnyachiy et 61]., 2014; Pascual—
Garcia et 61]., 2009, 2010; Petrey et 61]., 2009; Sadowski and Taylor,
2010; Sadreyev et 61]., 2009; Shindyalov and Bourne, 2000; Skolnick
et 61]., 2009; Szustakowski et 61]., 2005; Taylor, 2002; Tendulkar
et 61]., 2004; Tsai et 61]., 2000; Xie and Bourne, 2008; Zhang et 61].,
2010). It implies that two proteins could be related even if their pair—
wise similarity is undetectable. Thus, the protein universe is better
represented as a graph, where each node is a protein. Two nodes are
connected if there is a detectable relationship between them
(Dokholyan et 61]., 2002). In this way, two remotely related proteins
can be connected through a transitive path (Nepomnyachiy et 61].,
2014). However, widely used sequence similarity search methods
such as PSI—BLAST (Altschul et 61]., 1997) and hidden Markov model
(HMM, Eddy, 1998), and conventional protein sequence and struc—
ture classification schema such as Pfam (Finn et 61]., 2008), structural
classification of proteins (SCOP, Murzin et 61]., 1995) and CATH
(Orengo et 61]., 1997) are built on the assumption that protein space
is discrete and hierarchical. As a result, novel structural and func—
tional relationships can be missed if two sequences are very diver—
gent. A network—based method, which connects all sequences into a
graph model and exploits the global network structure of similarity
relationships between proteins in a database, provides an alternative
solution to explore the protein space in a continuous fashion (Chen
et 61]., 2011a, b; Chipman and Singh, 2009; Melvin et 61]., 2009;
Singh—Blom et 61]., 2013; Vanunu et 61]., 2010; Wang et 61]., 2013;
Weston et 61]., 2004). Although it has demonstrated its potential in
detecting novel relationships that could be missed by the pairwise—
based method (Atkinson et 61]., 2009), the existing network—based
method has two fundamental limitations. First, it provides the rank-
ing of similarities but gives no information on their reliabilities. A
model that can assess the statistical significance of similarity is one
of the key components in both pairwise—based and profile—based
methods and is critical in distinguishing true and false positives and
enhancing the sensitivity of a similarity search. Second, few net—
work—based methods can combine sequence and structural similar—
ity. The incorporation of structural similarity into sequence profile
has been successfully applied to detecting novel sequence—structure
relationships, as the structure is more conserved than the sequence
(Petrey et 61]., 2003; Tang et 61]., 2003).

In this article, we introduce a new similarity search method,
Enrichment of Network Topological Similarity (ENTS), to address
challenges in protein similarity search in terms of the continuous
protein space. ENTS synthesizes several concepts: network inference
to detect the global similarity of a protein, grouping of relevant pro-
teins as a network profile, incorporation of structural information
into the sequence search and an efficient statistics model to assess
the reliability of the network topological similarity profile. We apply
ENTS to a challenging unsolved problem: protein fold recognition.
Our rigorous benchmark studies demonstrate that ENTS signifi-
cantly outperforms state—of—the—art profile— and network—based
methods for protein structure prediction. Moreover, ENTS can inte—
grate different similarity measurements (e.g. sequence similarity and
structure similarity) and biological classifications (e.g. SCOP) to
infer novel protein structure and function. As the principal concept
of ENTS can be applied to any similarity metric, ENTS provides a
new general framework to boost the performance of the similarity
search and may inspire novel methodologies in broad areas of bio—
informatics, such as RNA structure prediction and disease gene
identification.

2 Methods

2.1 Overview

The rationale of ENTS is that when clusters of instances share com—
mon features, a cluster ranked closely together is more likely similar
to the new instance than a cluster ranked randomly or spread out
across the ranking. In addition, network topological similarity pro-
vides more robust and accurate global ranking across an entire hy-
pothesis space than pairwise similarity does. Unlike conventional
local ranking (e.g. k—nearest neighbors), global instance ranking
can support statistical enrichment analysis because it draws valu—
able information on the ranking for all instances in a cluster from
lower, non—randomly ranked cases. Figure 1 shows the scheme of
ENTS.

2.2 A weighted graph representation of structural
similarity

To initialize ENTS for structure prediction, ENTS builds a structural
similarity graph of protein domains, which is essentially the same as
the protein domain universe graph described by Dokholyan et al.
(Dokholyan et 61]., 2002). The structural similarity graph is a
weighted graph with one node for each structural domain and an
edge between two nodes only if their pairwise similarity exceeds a
certain threshold. In this article, the structural similarity score is
determined by TM align (Zhang and Skolnick, 2005). The threshold
is 0.4 of the TM align score. In other applications, the threshold de—
pends on the features and the pairwise similarity metric. Any simi-
larity metric (e.g. Euclidean distance, Jaccard index, HMM and
kernel—based similarity) can be applied here.

2.3 Classification or clustering of protein structural
domains

Next, some or all the structural domains in the database are
labeled with SCOP (Murzin et 61]., 1995). If pre—classification is not
used, clusters of structural domains can be assembled using
structural similarity under unsupervised clustering techniques
(Estivill—Castro, 2002) such as k—means (Hartigan and Wong, 1979),
mean-shift (Comaniciu and Meer, 2002), affinity propagation
(Frey and Dueck, 2007) or p—median model (Brusco and Kohn,
2008), etc. These domain clusters are applied to the next step. In
general, the labeled clusters are not necessarily disjointed. They can
overlap.

2.4 Network topological similarity

Given a query domain sequence and the goal to predict its structure,
ENTS first links the query to all nodes in the structural similarity
graph. The weights of these new edges are based only on the se—
quence profile-profile similarity derived from HHSearch (Soding,
2005). Then random walk with restart (RWR) is applied to perform
a probabilistic traversal of the instance graph across all paths lead—
ing away from the query, where the probability of choosing an edge
will be proportional to its weight. The algorithm will output a list of
all instances in the graph, ranked by the probability tiq that a path
from the query will reach the node i. In this way, RWR can capture
global relationships that may be missed by pairwise similarity (Tong
and Faloutsos, 2006).

We modified the RankProp algorithm (Melvin et 61]., 2009), a
variant of RWR and implemented it using the boost library (http://
www.boost.org). The graph is represented as an adjacency list to
save memory and speed up the iterative algorithm. The current im-
plementation is scalable to a graph with millions of nodes and hun—
dreds of millions of edges.

Fig. 1. Schema of ENTS-Struct, a special case of ENTS. ENTS-Struct connects protein structural domains (hexagons) into a graph whose edges are weighted by
their structural similarity. Structure domains are grouped by their structural or functional classifications (e.g. SCOP). Each group is assigned with a label Fi(e.g.
SCOP fold). A query sequence 0 is linked to the graph using the sequence profile-profile similarity. RWR computes global similarity scores for the query to all
structure domains in the graph. In the figure, darker nodes denote stronger similarities. Set enrichment analysis calculates statistically significant differences be-
tween observed distributions of similarity scores for each labeled group and a random one and ranks the labeled groups for the query with statistical significance

(z-score)

2.5 Statistical significance of network topological
similarity

A network topological search only ranks instances based on their
similarity and gives no information on the reliability of the ranking.
To assess the statistical significance of the ranking of a structural
cluster C,- generated previously, ENTS compares the score distribu—
tion of the cluster C,- with that of a randomly drawn cluster of the
same size. When the mean of global topological similarity scores X
in a cluster is used as the statistic, an efficient random—set method is
used for the parametric approximation of the null distribution
(Newton et al., 2007). The random—set method compares an en—
riched cluster of size m with all other distinct clusters of size m
drawn randomly from a case graph on N nodes. The exact distribu—
tion of X is intractable but can be approximated by the normal dis—
tribution with mean and variance as follows:

1 N
M = NZI-Zl Pi

 

a: = a (1:?) (($31. Pi) — (axle-)2)

Where p,- is the global topological similarity score of the structure
j in the graph to the query.
The enrichment score of the cluster C,- is then normalized with

_Y—M
— 0

Z

 

2.6 Benchmark

The SCOP database (Murzin et al., 1995) version 1.75B is used as a
gold standard for benchmarking. SCOP manually classifies approxi-
mately 40% of protein structures in the RCSB Protein Data Bank
(PDB, Deshpande et al., 2005) based on similarities in their three-di-
mensional shapes (i.e. folds) and amino acid sequences. If two pro—
teins have a similar sequence, they are classified into a common
‘family’. If two proteins have dissimilar sequences but similar folds
and common evolutionary origin, they belong to the same ‘super—
family’. Two proteins from different superfamilies may share the
same fold. The benchmark in this study is to recognize the fold of a
protein by searching for a database that does not include any protein
that shares the same family and superfamily as that of the query

protein. The SCOP 1.75B release includes 1195 folds and 1962
superfamilies. A list of 36 003 non—redundant protein structural do—
mains with sequence identity less than 40% (termed the 36 003 set)
and their pairwise structural similarity that is determined by
FATCAT structural comparison software (Ye and Godzik, 2003)
were downloaded from the RCSB PDB (August 2013) (Deshpande
et al., 2005 ). These proteins and their similarities were used to build
graph models for the structure prediction. It is noted that only
23.9% of the structure domains in the 36003 set have the SCOP
classification. If a structure domain does not have a SCOP assign—
ment, it was assumed that the non—SCOP—assigned domain shares
the same superfamily as that of the SCOP—assigned domain to which
it is the most structurally similar. It is noted that temporary SCOP
assignments were not used for the gold standard to evaluate the per—
formance of algorithms but only for building a benchmark (details
below). To reduce the bias in the existing fold coverage of the pro—
tein universe, one structural domain was randomly selected from
each SCOP superfamily as a benchmark if its SCOP fold had more
than one superfamily. A list of structural domains was compiled (the
885—set). Then a separated subset B,- of the 36 003 set was assigned
to each structure S,- in the 885 benchmark structures, such that all
structures that have the same SCOP superfamilies (including the
temporarily assigned SCOP superfamilies) as that of S,- were
removed from the original 36 003 set. Overall, the benchmark is de—
signed to evaluate the performance of algorithms in detecting novel
structural relationships when sequence similarity is weak and noisy.

2.7 Performance evaluation

For a given benchmark structure 5,, a true positive is defined as a
correctly recognized fold when searching S,- against its corresponding
B,. The incorrectly assigned folds are false positives. In total, there
were 885 searches and 1 057575 combined fold hits, including 885
true positives and 1 05 6 690 false positives. To reﬂect the situation
in the real application, the performance of the algorithms was eval—
uated by the ratio of true positives on the top—N ranked hits
(N <=2000).

2.8 Experimental design

2.8.1 HMM-HMM similarity of protein sequence

An HMM sequence profile model was built for the amino acid se—
quence of each structural domain in the 36 003—set and 885—set using
the HH—Suite package (Soding, 2005 ). The UniProt20 sequence
database (preiler et al., 2004) was used to generate multiple

sequence alignment. The similarity between two HMM profiles was
determined using HHSearch (Soding, 2005 ). All parameters to build
and align HMMs used the default setting of the programs.

2.8.2 Fold recognition by HHSearch

Given a query sequence S,- and its corresponding HMM profile, its
HMM—HMM similarity to each HMM sequence profile of struc—
tural domains in the set of B,- was determined by HHBlits. HHBlits
is a fast implementation of HHSearch, but the performance of each
implementation is comparable (Remmert et al., 2012). For each
SCOP fold F], its association score 19,-,- with the S,- was assigned the
best HMM—HMM probability score of the HMM hits that were
classified as Fj. All 19,-,- were ranked. The top—ranked statistically sig—
nificant F,- is the candidate fold assignment to 5,. It is noted that the
HHSearch probability score incorporates the similarity of secondary
structures.

2.8.3 Fold recognition by CNFpred

Fold recognition of each query sequence S,- was also done using
CNFpred, another fold recognition program that correlates various
sequence and structure features by using a conditional neural field’s
model (Ma et al., 2012). The same procedure is applied as
HHSearch.

2.8.4 Construction of homology models

The three-dimensional homology model is constructed using the se—
quence alignment derived from CNFpred by Modeller v9.14 (Sali
and Blundell, 1993).

2.8.5 . Construction of HMM-HMM similarity graph

An HMM-HMM similarity graph GH, was constructed for each B,-
in which each structural domain was a node. Two nodes were con—
nected if they had detectable HMM—HMM similarity according to
HHSearch. Each edge was assigned with a weight whose value was
the probability score of similarity determined by HHSearch (ranging
from 0.0 to 1.0).

2.8.6 Construction of structural similarity graph

All-against—all pairwise structural comparisons of non—redundant
structural domains were downloaded from the RCSB PDB
(Deshpande et al., 2005 ). A structural similarity graph G5,- was con—
structed for each B,- in which each structural domain was a node.
Two nodes were connected if they had similar structure, which was
determined by TM align (Zhang and Skolnick, 2005 ) (0.4 <=TM—
align score < 1.0). Each edge was assigned a weight whose value
was the TM—align structural similarity score.

2.8.7 Fold recognition by network topological similarity search
Given a query sequence 5,, the RankProp algorithm was applied to
rank all structures in CH, or G5,- to S,- based on their network topo—
logical similarity score. For each fold, the fold association score of S,-
was assigned using the same method as the fold recognition by
HHSearch. The RankProp is called RankProp-HHSearch and
RankProp—Struct, respectively, when applied to GH, or G5.

2.8.8 Fold recognition by ENTS
As shown in Figure 1, ENTS was determined as follows:

1. All structures that were classiﬁed as the same SCOP fold were
put into a commonly labeled set.

2. A query sequence S,- was connected to its corresponding similar-
ity graph GH, or G5,. The edges and edge weights between S,- and
GH, (or G5,) were determined by HMM—HMM similarities.

3. The RankProp algorithm was applied to rank all structures in
CH, or G5,- to S,- based on their network topological similarity
score.

4. The distribution of the topological similarity score in each
labeled SCOP set was determined. Set enrichment analysis was
applied to each set in terms of its score distribution. A z-score Zil-
was calculated for each set that corresponds to a single fold Fj.
Zij was the fold association score between S,- and Pi.

5. For the purpose of benchmark comparison, all Zij from 885 ex-
periments were combined and ranked.

6. When applied to GH, or G5, ENTS was called ENTS—HHSearch
or ENTS—Struct, respectively.

3 Results

3.1 Overview of ENTS algorithm

We have developed a new algorithm, ENTS of Structure (ENTS—
Struct), to infer protein structure based on the network topological
similarity of a protein structure similarity network. As shown in
Figure 1, ENTS—Struct consists of four key steps. First, we connect
non—redundant protein structure domains found in the PDB into an
all—against—all structure similarity network (referred to as
StructWeb) based on a pairwise structural comparison. Second, if a
structural domain has an existing annotation (e.g. SCOP), the struc—
tural domain is labeled with this annotation. Third, given a query
protein, we connect the query to the StructWeb based on HMM—
HMM similarity from HHSearch (Soding, 2005 ) and apply an RWR
algorithm to define the network topological similarity between the
query protein and other proteins in the StructWeb. Finally, to assess
the statistical significance of the topological rank derived from the
RWR, we apply random set theory to estimate the enrichment of a
protein set that is associated with a structural or functional class
(e.g. SCOP or G0) in terms of the distribution of its network topo—
logical similarity scores. The final output of ENTS—Struct is the stat—
istical significance (z—score) of a list of inferred putative structures or
functions for the query protein.

3.2 ENTS—Struct considerably improves the
performance of fold recognition
The performance of ENTS—Struct was evaluated using HHSearch
and CNFpred as baselines. HHSearch is one of the most sensitive se—
quence profile—profile comparison methods developed so far, outper—
forming PSI-Blast and HMMER (Eddy, 1998). In addition,
secondary structural similarity is incorporated into the probability
score of HHSearch. CNFpred correlates various sequence and struc—
ture features by using a conditional neural field’s model (Ma et al.,
2012). As shown in Figure 2, ENTS—Struct (black line) clearly out—
performs the state—of—the—art algorithm HHSearch (red line) and
CNFpred (purple line). With the same number of the highest ranked
hits, ENTS—Struct consistently identifies more true positives than
HHSearch. There are approximately 50% more true positives in the
top 1000 ranked hits identified by ENTS—Struct than those identified
by HHSearch. Although CNFpred improves the quality of sequence
alignment, it does not perform as well as HHSearch in the fold rec—
ognition in our benchmark set.

The improved performance of ENTS—Struct benefits from the use
of the structural similarity network StructWeb. As a comparison, an
all-against-all HMM-HMM profile similarity network of structural

domains was constructed using HHSearch (referred to as ProfWeb).
The ENTS procedure as shown in Figure 1 is applied to ProfWeb ex—
cept that the StructWeb is replaced by the ProfWeb. The resulting al-
gorithm is referred to ENTS-HHSearch. The performance of ENTS—
HHSearch (orange line in Fig. 2) is much worse than ENTS—Struct.
Although ENTS—HHSearch has the potential to identify more true
hits than HHSearch, the false—positive rate is high in the top ranked
regions. This is not surprising as the structural similarity detection is
more accurate and less noisy (few false positives and false negatives)
than the HMM—HMM similarity in terms of detecting remote rela—
tionships between proteins.

ENTS—Struct shares the RWR as a key component with
RankProp, but ENTS—Struct is distinguished by its set enrichment
analysis for statistical assessment of the ranking. Both ENTS—Struct
and ENTS—HHSearch outperform their corresponding RankProp al-
gorithm—RankProp-Struct (blue dashed line in the Fig. 2) and
RankProp-HHSearch (green dashed line in the Fig. 2), respectively.
It is noted that the sensitivity of RankProp is not as good as
HHSearch for the top—ranked hits.

When only the top ranked hits are considered regardless of their
statistical significance, the percentage of queries that can detect
the correct fold at the top 1 and top 3 are shown in Fig. 3. The
overall performance is ENTS—Struct > Rankprop—Struct N ENTS—
HHSearcn > Rankprop-HHSearch > HHSearch > CNFpred. ENTS—
Struct ranks approximately 25% and 100% more true positives
than the baseline HHSearch at top 1 and top 3, respectively.

A recent study suggests that the continuity of protein space is de—
pendent on the structural class of the protein (Nepomnyachiy et al.,
2014). The proteins belonging to SCOP oc/ﬂ class can be linked with
each other through an evolutionary path. However, other classes are
relatively discrete (Nepomnyachiy et al., 2014). Consistent with this
observation, Table 1 shows that the performance of ENTS varies
when applied to different structural classes. ENTS improves the fold
recognition in all classes. In regard to the ratio of true positives
ranked at the top 3, the order of performance by both ENTS
and HHSearch is oc/ﬂ > all 6 > oc—l—ﬂ > all or, as the oc/ﬂ class is
more evolutionarily related than the or, 6 and oc—l—ﬂ classes, as
observed by Nepomnyachiy et al. (2014). However, the improve—
ments of ENTS relative to HHSearch vary by class, in the order of
all 6 > oc—l—ﬂ > all or > oc/ﬂ. This implies that different network topo—
logical search parameters may be needed for different structural
classes to balance the global and local perspective of structural simi—
larity network.

3.3 Application of ENTS—Struct to hard targets of

CASP1 1

To further test the performance of ENTS—Struct, we carried out a
blind test of its performance on fold recognition for hard targets of
CASP11. The hard targets are selected such that the highest
HHSearch probability of profile—profile similarity between the
CASP11 target and the PDB structural domain is <95 .0% (e—
value>0.1). It is noted that all structural domains used in the
benchmark were released by PDB prior to August 2013, 1 year ear—
lier than that of CASP11. Table 2 lists nine hard targets that have
released PDB structures, their most similar SCOP folds, the top 1
prediction from ENTS—Struct with medium and high confidences,
their confidence levels, GDT—4.0 score (the percentage of residues
in the model structure falling within 4.0  of their positions in
the experimental structure) and root mean square deviation. Among
these targets, ENTS—Struct correctly predicts the folds for the
five domains of four targets (T0765, T0769, T0781 C—terminal,
and T0808 N—terminal and C—terminal). Five structural domains of
these targets (T0761, T0763, T0767, T0771 and the N—terminal
domain of T781) do not have closely similar structures in the PDB.
ENTS—Struct has four false—positive predictions and two true—
negative predictions. Overall, the successful rate of ENTS—Struct is
63.5% (7 correct predictions over 11 cases) with a sensitivity
of 83.3% and a specificity of 40.0%. It is noted that ENTS
only assesses the statistical significance and re—ranks the hits of the
structure prediction. The quality of homology models is dependent

Using target T0769 as an example, Figure 4 and Table 3 demon—
strate how ENTS—Struct improves the performance of fold recogni-
tion over HHSearch and RankProp—Struct. HHSearch only detects
extremely weak similarity between T0769 and several structures
that belong to SCOP fold d5 8 (e—value ranges from 3.7 to 13). In
addition, there are two false—positive hits d1ghha_ (SCOP fold d5 7)
and d3bypa1 (SCOP fold d.52). They rank above the correct hits.
These highest ranked hits of HHSearch are corrected as a graph, as
shown in Figure 4. There are multiple edges linking the target to
structures that belong to SCOP fold d.58. As a result, RankProp—
Struct improves the ranking of d5 8 to rank 2. By applying the set
enrichment analysis of the RankProp score distribution, ENTS—
Struct correctly ranks d5 8 as the top 1 hit. Moreover, ENTS—Struct

In summary, the superior performance of ENTS—Struct comes
from its addition of global set statistics of topology similarity scores
as well as hybrid HMM—HMM and structural similarity onto the
RWR topological similarity ranking of protein space. The RWR
captures the global structure of protein space. However, conven—
tional statistics models may fail when applied to global similarity
problems, as it is not straightforward to normalize topological prop—
erties. Global set statistics is more powerful than the fitted paramet—
ric statistical model. However, it is less useful when only the nearest

neighbors are considered, as the scores of most entities in the set are
zeros, providing no information for hypothesis testing. When ENTS
is applied to HHSearch directly, its performance is worse than se—
lecting the hit that scored highest in a set of hits belonging to the
same fold (data not shown). ENTS by integrating RWR and global
set statistics provides a general framework to enhance similarity
search and association detection. Although this article focuses on its
application to protein structure prediction, it is expected that ENTS
may improve the performance of other bioinformatics applications
such as drug target identification, RNA structure prediction and dis—
ease gene identification.

4 Discussions
4.1 Potential broad applications of ENTS

In this article, we introduce the new computational framework
ENTS to assess the reliability of network topological ranking and

apply ENTS to the challenging problem of fold recognition.
Network topological rankings have been widely applied in bioinfor-
matics, such as in the cases of homology detection (Weston et al.,
2004), gene—disease association (Chen et al., 2011a, b; Li and Patra,
2010; Singh—Blom et al., 2013; Vanunu et al., 2010), genetic inter—
action prediction (Chipman and Singh, 2009), drug target prediction
(Wang et al., 2013), side effect prediction (Berger et al., 2010)
and drug repurposing (Ng et al., 2014). However, they lack an
efficient and generalized statistical model to normalize the ranking
and to assess its reliability. As a result, it is not straightforward
to determine a threshold for the selection of ranked hits in practice,
especially when dealing with data on a large scale. In one applica—
tion, the top first ranked hit could be a false positive. In another ap—
plication, multiple top ranked hits can be true positives. The set
statistical model introduced in ENTS is applicable to any similarity
metric. Our benchmark studies clearly demonstrate that the applica—
tion of ENTS to network topological rankings improves both the
sensitivity and specificity of similarity search. Thus, it is expected
that ENTS may have broad applications in bioinformatics and other
domains.

Another unique feature of ENTS is that it can integrate heteroge—
neous similarity metrics. In the case of fold recognition, both reliable
protein structural similarity and noisy sequence profile-profile simi-
larity are used in the construction of the network. The integration of
multiple omics data, which are often noisy, biased and incomplete,
is one of the great challenges in the post—genome era. ENTS presents
an alternative approach to integrate reliable and complementary re—
lationships between biological entities with noisy data from hetero—
geneous data sources into a unified network model. As shown in our
benchmark studies, the direct incorporation of structural similarity
into sequence similarity search improves the performance of fold
recognition. Similar strategies may be applicable to other bioinfor—
matics problems.

4.2 Improvement of global topological similarity

ENTS can be improved in several aspects. The RWR step in the cur—
rent iterative implementation of ENTS is computationally intensive.
More efficient RWR implementation will make ENTS feasible for
handling big data. Recent MapReduce—based graph querying and
mining systems [e.g. GBase (Kang et al., 2011, 2012)] can support
graphs with billions of nodes. They can be incorporated into ENTS.
In principle, all steady—state probabilities of RWR are defined by the
inversion of matrix Q : I — 6 W, where 1 — ﬂ is the restart probabil—
ity and W is the edge weight matrix. If Q_1 is pre—computed, instant
query response can be achieved. For graphs with specific block-lin-
ear structures that are common in biological and chemical networks,
efficient linear system solvers that balance the pre—computational
cost and on—line query response are available (Tong et al., 2006,
2008)

Other methods for computing global topological similarity may
possess advantages over RWR. One of the disadvantages of RWR is
that the convergence requires the normalization of edge weights.
The normalization may result in the loss of similarity information
between instances. For example, one instance has a similarity score
of 1.0 with respect to its two neighbor instances. Another instance
has the similarity score of 0.1 with respect to its two neighbor in—
stances. After normalization in a graph representation, all edge
weights may become 0.5. It has been suggested that diverse k—short—
est paths analysis may overcome the shortcomings of RWR, thereby
improving the detection of global topological relationships (Shih
and Parthasarathy, 2012).

4.3 Improvement of set enrichment analysis

The mean set statistic calculation and the significance assessment
using random set theory in the current implementation of ENTS are
computationally efficient but may be suboptimal for performance,
as the mean score distribution may not follow the normal distribu—
tion. Several other choices for the set statistic are available, for ex—
ample, Kolmogorov—Smirnov statistics (Subramanian et al., 2005 ),
maxmean statistics (Efron and Tibshirani, 2007), Wilcoxon rank
sum test statistics and the conditional local false discovery rate
(Efron, 2008). To assess significance, a non—parametric permutation
test by shuffling labels may provide more accurate estimation when
the underlying probability distribution is unknown. It is possible to
adopt a two—step procedure for the significance assessment. The ran-
dom—set method is first applied to filter out less significant hits, so
only significant hits will be subject to the permutation test.

4.4 Integration with other methods for structure
prediction

When ENTS is applied to protein structure prediction, it relies on a
protein threading algorithm to link a query sequence to the struc—
tural similarity network and to align the sequence to the structure
template. The threading method must detect structures similar to
the query sequence, although confidence level does not need to be
high. Indeed, the performance of ENTS is strongly dependent on the
threading algorithms which are applied. The sequence similarity
based on HHSearch outperforms that based on PSI—BLAST and the
performance based on PSI—BLAST is better than that based on
BLAST (data not shown). Thus, the incorporation of state—of—the—art
protein threading algorithms such as MRFalign (Ma et al., 2014)
into ENTS may further improve the performance of ENTS for struc—
ture prediction.

Although ENTS improves the performance of fold recognition
over existing methods, the false—positive rate is still high. One pos—
sible solution is to build multiple conformational models for all top
ranked hits. Then energy—based scoring functions can be used to dis—
tinguish true and false positives (Petrey et al., 2003). In addition, the
nodes in the existing structural similarity network are structural do—
mains. SCOP domain classification is used as the node label, mainly
for the purpose of performance evaluation. If the query has a novel
fold, the prediction is doomed to be a false positive. In principle, any
structural classification, either automatic or manual, can be used to
label the structure. Moreover, it is possible to use the recurrent
structural fragment as a node to construct the structural similarity
network. The query may have multiple statistically significant frag-
ment hits. Many structure prediction methods [e.g. I—TASSER
(Zhang, 2008)] then could be applied to assemble these fragments
into a final structure.

5 Conclusion

Similarity is a fundamental concept in bioinformatics and the emerg—
ing discipline of data science, which seeks to harness big data to im—
prove data—driven decision making. In this article, we propose a new
method for computing statistically significant similarity via integrat-
ing similarity profiles, network topological similarity and set enrich—
ment analysis. Because ENTS applies to any similarity metric, it is
poised to make several contributions to bioinformatics. Individual
predictive reliability is essential in risk—sensitive applications. ENTS
is able to determine the statistical significance of any similarity met-
ric and provides guidance for reliable discovery in large data sets.
Robustness to noisy and incomplete data sets is important in

bioinformatics applications. Many bioinformatics tasks need to han—
dle data sets that are partially and/or positive—only labeled. ENTS
provides a new approach to handling noisy and incomplete data.
Thus, it is expected that ENTS has broad applications in
bioinformatics.

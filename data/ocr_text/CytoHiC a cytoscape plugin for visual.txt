ABSTRACT

Summary: With the introduction of the Hi-C method new and funda-
mental properties of the nuclear architecture are emerging. The ability
to interpret data generated by this method, which aims to capture the
physical proximity between and within chromosomes, is crucial for
uncovering the three dimensional structure of the nucleus. Providing
researchers with tools for interactive visualization of Hi-C data can
help in gaining new and important insights. Specifically, visual com-
parison can pinpoint changes in spatial organization between Hi-C
datasets, originating from different cell lines or different species, or
normalized by different methods. Here, we present CytoHiC, a
Cytsocape plugin, which allow users to view and compare spatial
maps of genomic landmarks, based on normalized Hi-C datasets.
CytoHiC was developed to support intuitive visual comparison of
Hi-C data and integration of additional genomic annotations.

files and documentation are available at: http://apps.cytoscape.

1 INTRODUCTION

The development of the Hi-C technique by Lieberman et al.
(2009) introduced revolutionary concepts to the research of
genome organization. A following analysis suggested a fractal
globule organization, at le resolution, where loci interact
within (intra-) and between (inter-) chromosomes (Lieberman
et al., 2009). Since then, signiﬁcant efforts were made to
remove bias and normalize the data (Hu et al., 2012; ImakaeV
et al., 2012; Yaffe and Tanay, 2011), to identify governing fea-
tures, such as CCCTC factor and binding sites (Botta et al.,
2010), and to suggest the role of nuclear architecture in regula-
tion (Dong et a1, 2010) and translocation events (Engreitz et al.,
2012; Zhang et al., 2012).

Hi—C data can be considered as an end result of dissembling a
puzzle or shuttering a globe into small pieces and reporting the
pieces that were found together. Normalization methods attempt
to remove biases and, in turn, report a corrected contact value
between the different pieces. Assembling back the pieces, or gen-
omic bins, into the underlying spatial map is an important chal-
lenge. The ability to View and compare Hi-C maps as spatial
networks with respect to genomic landmarks of interest can

provide important insights about the properties, dynamics and
role of the nuclear organization.

Through Visual comparison, researchers can instantly identify
what has changed and what has remained conserved between
different Hi-C datasets. One may be interested in comparing
the interaction map of orthologs, or View the spatial changes
through a progress of a disease or through developmental
stages. Comparison of cells with different functions may reveal
common and cell-speciﬁc spatial arrangements. Finally, compar-
ing the same Hi—C dataset under different normalization meth-
ods, or before and after normalization has been performed, can
aid in assessing differences in coverage and correction.

We have developed CytoHiC, a plugin for the Cytoscape plat-
form (Shannon et al., 2003), for generating and Visually compar-
ing spatial maps from normalized Hi-C data. CytoHiC provides
a user-friendly interface for uploading Hi-C data and genomic
landmarks and exploits the Visualization power of Cytoscape to
draw the corresponding spatial maps. Its implementation was
designed to allow for easy identiﬁcation of spatial changes and
for Visual integration of related properties such as methylation
and gene expression. As a Cytoscape plugin, CytoHiC also
makes it easier to combine and convey multi-omic information.
To the best of our knowledge, CytoHiC is the ﬁrst tool
developed for the task of an interactive Visual comparison of
Hi-C data.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

After a simple installation (placing the CytoHiC plugin in the
plugins directory of Cytoscape before launching Cytoscape), the
CytoHiC plugin is available from the Plugins menu of
Cytoscape. The user can then choose either to View or compare
Hi-C networks.

Through simple dialogs, the user can upload a set (when View-
ing) or two sets (when comparing) of normalized Hi-C data and
landmarks of interest. A Hi-C dataset consists of two ﬁles: a bin
ﬁle, specifying the segmentation of chromosomes and the gen-
omic location of each segment (bin), and a contact ﬁle, specifying
the contact value (or expected and observed values) between the
different bins. The ﬁle format should be speciﬁed by the user
(two main formats are supported: a contact matrix or a list of
observed and expected values). The landmarks ﬁle consists of the
names and genomic locations of the landmarks of interest. The
user may also specify a numeric property of interest (e. g. methy-
lation level or gene expression level) that will be incorporated
when Visualizing the network (see Section 2.2 for details). While
CytoHiC is mainly intended for normalized data, the user may

upload data before normalization, if they are given in one of the
supported formats. A user manual is incorporated in the
Cytoscape’s help content, providing details on general usage
and supported ﬁle formats.

2.1 Network generation

Given a set of bins, a contact matrix and landmarks of interest,
CytoHiC matches landmarks to bins and calculates the contact
value between each pair of landmarks. When a landmark is
spread over more than one bin, the contact value is calculated
as a weighted sum, so that the weight is proportional to the
overlap between the bin and the landmark. The spatial network
is then generated, where landmarks correspond to nodes and
(undirected) edges are weighted by the inverse of the contact
value, for an approximation of physical proximity. A relation-
ship of inverse proportion between contact frequencies and phys-
ical proximity was previously suggested by Fraser et al. (2009).
When the contact value is not available or when the contact
value is zero (owing to limited coverage of the Hi-C data or
owing to normalization correction), there will be no edge
between the landmarks.

2.2 Network visualization

The network is drawn using a force-directed layout algorithm
(available from Cytoscape’s layout algorithm collection), based
on the edge weights. Users may also explore other layouts based
on the edge weight attribute. The details of the nodes and edges
are available by hovering and from the node and edge browsers
of Cytoscape.

By default, nodes are colored by their chromosome afﬁliation
(i.e. landmarks in the same chromosome will have the same
color). However, when the user speciﬁes an additional property
of interest (for the landmarks), nodes are colored by a blue and
red gradient with respect to the range of the property’s values.
For example, if a methylation level is speciﬁed, each node (land-
mark) will be colored accordingly. Highly methylated landmarks
will appear in dark red and under-methylated landmarks will be
colored in dark blue. Intermediate methylation levels will be as-
signed with intermediate colors. The edges are labeled by their
weight (approximation of distance), with a line style matching
the interaction type they represent. A solid line corresponds to an
interaction within a chromosome (intra-interaction), and a
dashed line corresponds to an interaction between chromosomes
(inter-interaction).

2.3 Visual comparison of landmarks

The option to visually compare networks is available from the
CytoHiC menu and from a right-click pop-up. The user may

compare two networks or compare a current network with an-
other network. The nodes (landmarks) are labeled with indices so
that matching landmarks can be easily compared (the indices are
given according to the ordering of the landmarks ﬁle).

3 CONCLUSION

CytoHiC is a platform-independent easy to install plugin for
Cytoscape. It offers visual exploration and comparison so users
can instantly and easily observe trends and changes in the spatial
environment of genomic landmarks. Users may explore spatial
changes from evolutionary, functional, developmental and clin-
ical point of Views. As Hi-C data take its important place in the
research of nuclear architecture, Visual exploration applications
such as CytoHiC become an important part of the required
toolbox.

While the spatial networks generated by CytoHiC provide the
user an approximation for physical proximity based on inter-
action frequencies, we hope to offer better methods for predict-
ing the nuclear positions of landmarks and to ﬁx coverage and
correction errors in the future. Incorporation of such methods
with a Visualization tool can provide a more accurate represen-
tation of the nucleus topological map.

Abstract

Motivation: Hashing has been widely used for indexing, querying and rapid similarity search in
many bioinformatics applications, including sequence alignment, genome and transcriptome as—
sembly, k—mer counting and error correction. Hence, expediting hashing operations would have a
substantial impact in the field, making bioinformatics applications faster and more efficient.
Results: We present ntHash, a hashing algorithm tuned for processing DNA/RNA sequences. It per—
forms the best when calculating hash values for adjacent k—mers in an input sequence, operating
an order of magnitude faster than the best performing alternatives in typical use cases.

Availability and implementation: ntHash is available online at http://WVWN.bcgsc.ca/p|atform/bio

info/software/nthash and is free for academic use.

1 Introduction

Hashing is a common function across many informatics applica—
tions, and refers to mapping an input key value of arbitrary size to
an allocated memory of predetermined size. Among other uses, it is
an enabling concept for rapid search operations, and forms the
backbone of Internet search engines. In bioinformatics, it has many
applications including sequence alignment, genome and transcrip—
tome assembly, RNA—seq expression quantification, k—mer counting
and error correction.

Large—scale sequence analysis often relies on cataloguing or count—
ing consecutive k—mers in DNA/RNA sequences for indexing, quer-
ying and similarity searching. An efficient way of implementing such
operations is through the use of hash based data structures, such as
hash tables or Bloom filters. Therefore, improving the performance of
hashing algorithms would have a great impact in a wide range of bio—
informatics tools. Here, we present ntHash, a fast function for recur—
sively computing hash values for consecutive k—mers.

2 Methods

We propose an algorithm to hash consecutive k—mers in a sequence,
r of length l > 13, using a recursive function, f, in which the hash

value of the current k—mer H is derived from the hash value of the
previous k—mer:

H(/e — meri) :  — meri_1),r[i —l— k — 1],r[i — 1]) (1)

Such a recursive function, also called rolling hash function, offers
huge improvements in performance when hashing consecutive k—
mers. This has been previously described and investigated for 11—
gram hashing for string matching, text indexing and information re-
trieval (Cohen, 1997; Gonnet and Baezayates, 1990; Karp and
Rabin, 1987; Lemire and Kaser, 2010). In this paper, we have cus—
tomized the concept for hashing all k—mers of a DNA sequence, and
implemented an adapted version of the cyclic polynomial hash func-
tion, ntHash, to compute normal or canonical hash values for k—
mers in DNA sequences efficiently. In hashing by cyclic polynomial,
ntHash uses barrel shifts instead of multiplications to make the pro—
cess faster. To compute hash values for all k—mers of the sequence r
of length l, we first hash the initial k—mer, k—mero, as follows:

H(/e — mero) = rolk-1b(r[01)erolk-2h(r[1])e . . elm/e — 1]) (2)

where 701 is a cyclic binary left rotation, G9 is the bit—wise
EXCLUSIVE OR (XOR) operator, and Io(') is a seed table, where the
letters of the DNA alphabet, Z = {A, C, G, T}, are assigned different

Fig. 1. Performance of ntHash. (a) A good hash function should have its values uniformly and independently distributed across the target domain. One way of
measuring that is through correlation coefficients between the bits of hashed values. The plot shows natural statistical fluctuations for smaller sample sets (100

data points, the area above diagonal). The correlations dissipate rapidly for large sample sets (100 000 data points, the area below diagonal). (b) Runtime for hash-
ing 250 bp DNA sequences with different k-mer lengths from 50 to 250. ntHash outperforms all other hash methods when hashing more than two subsequent k-
mers, i.e. k< 249. (c) Comparing multi-hashing runtime of ntHash with the leading hash functions for one billion 50-mers. ntHash performs over 20x faster than

the closest competitor, cityhash. Grey, orange and blue bars refer to calculation of one, three and five hash functions, respectively

random 64—bit integers. The hash values for all consequent k—mers,

k-merl, . . ., k-mer;_k, are then computed recursively as follows:

H(/e — meri) : rollH(/e — meri_1)®rolkb(r[i — 1])®h(r[i —l— k — 1])
(3)

We note that the time complexity of ntHash for sequence r is
0(k +1) compared to 0(kl) complexity of regular hash functions. In
some bioinformatics applications, one might be interested in com—
puting the hash value of forward and reverse—complement sequences
of a k—mer.

To do so, we add in the seed table integers that correspond to the
complement bases, such that table indices of base—complement base
pairs are separated by a fixed offset. Using this table, we can easily
compute the hash value for the reverse—complement (as well as the
canonical form) of a sequence efficiently, without actually reverse—
complementing the input sequence, as follows:

H(/e — merd) : Io(r[0] —l— d)®rollb(r[1]—l— c009 . . .GBrolk—1b(r[k — 1] —l— d)
H(/e — mer’mu’pk) : rorlHUe — merf_1)®ror1b(r[i — 1] —l— d)
orolk-1h(r[i+k — 1] +d) (4)

where ror is a cyclic binary right rotation, and d is the offset of com—
plement base in the seed table Io(').

Further, ntHash provides a fast way to compute multiple hash
values for a given k—mer, without repeating the whole procedure for
each value. To do so, a single hash value is computed from a given
k—mer, and then each extra hash value is computed by few more
multiplication, shifting and XOR operations on the initial hash
value (Supplementary Data). This would be very useful for certain
bioinformatics applications, such as those that utilize the Bloom fil-
ter data structure. Experimental results demonstrate a substantial
speed improvement over conventional approaches, while retaining
a near—ideal hash value distribution (Fig. 1, Supplementary
Tables 81—88).

In the Results section, we have used sequencing data on the
human individual NA19238 from the Illumina Platinum Genomes
project, as well as simulated random DNA sequences, as detailed in

Supp. Data.

3 Results

A good hash function should generate hash values that are inde—
pendently and uniformly distributed across the target domain, re—
sulting in fewer collisions. To evaluate the independence of
ntHash values, one way is to use the correlation coefficient be—
tween the bits of 64—bit hash values. That is, if each bit x,,
i: 1..64, in a 64—bit hash value vector X:{x1, x2, ..., x64} is an
independent random variable, then there should be no correlation
between them. To test this, we first generated sets of hash values
for a given input. We next computed the (Pearson) correlation co—
efficient matrix for each sample set. Figure 1a shows the correl—
ation coefficients of two sample sets of size 100 (above diagonal)
and 100 000 (below diagonal). The plot shows natural statistical
fluctuations for smaller sample sets. The correlations dissipate
rapidly for large sample sets (Supplementary Figs 81—85).
Comparing the computed correlation coefficients with a confi—
dence interval around the theoretical zero correlation shows that
for all hash functions tested, the number of observations outside
the 99.7% confidence is around 0.3%, in agreement with theoret—
ical expectations.

We have also evaluated the uniformity of different hash methods
by utilizing a Bloom filter data structure. Here, we first load a
Bloom filter with a number of unique k—mers, and then query the
Bloom filter with another set of unique k—mers. The results show the
false positive rates of ntHash and other hash functions comply with
the theoretical false positive rate for Bloom filters, indicating the
uniform distribution of hash values generated by the tested hash
methods (Supplementary Tables 81—88).

We have compared the runtime performance of ntHash algo-
rithm with three most widely used hash methods in bioinformatics:
cityhash, murmur and xxhash (unpublished tools; references to web—
sites provided in the Supplementary Materials). ntBase is the hash
function for the base equation of ntHash (Eq. (2)). Figure 1b shows
the runtimes for hashing different length k—mers in 5 000 000 DNA
sequences of length 250 bp. In the inset, we see ntHash outperforms
other algorithms when hashing more than two k—mers in a DNA se—
quence. Figure 1c illustrates a typical use case of computing multiple
hash values for 50—mers in DNA sequences of length 250 bp, and

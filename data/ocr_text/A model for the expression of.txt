Abstract

Motivation: We propose the third-order model equation of the Jeffreys type for concentrations
of gap gene proteins in order to take into account particle inertia. Gap genes are responsible for for-
mation of body segments in Drosophila melanogaster embryo during its early development.
Usually the expression of the genes is described by the model of protein transport based on con-
ventional diffusion equation. However, the model is known to govern the Brownian (non-inertial)
motion of particles; hence, it is hardly applicable to the description of protein transport.

Results: Analysis of the Jeffreys-type equation results in the necessary condition for the problem
to be well-posed. Application of the Jeffreys-type equation with non-linear terms to description
of the dynamics of gap gene network demonstrates better fitting to experimental data than the
conventional model.

1 Introduction

Segmentation genes play crucial role in early development of
Drosophila melanogaster, being responsible for formation and
positioning of body segments (Nusslein-Volhard and Wieschaus,
1980). The segmentation genes are divided into four classes: ma-
ternal genes, gap genes, pair-rule genes and segment polarity gen-
es—according to their mutant phenotype (for details, see
Nusslein-Volhard and Wieschaus, 1980). At present, gap genes
have become popular investigation object, in particular, for sys-
tem biologists due to the following reasons (Jaeger, 2011). First,
the gap gene system is the most upstream regulatory layer among
zygotic genes, controlling D. melanogaster embryogenesis and
determining both the position and the identities of body seg-
ments. Second, availability of big amount of experimental data
on gene expression enable to model mathematically and

reconstruct the gap gene network in silico (Gursky et al. 2008;
Jaeger et al. 2004; Reinitz et al. 1995).

Usually the gene expression is described by means of con-
ventional model based on the parabolic reaction diffusion equation,
written for an unknown protein concentration function u(x, t) as:

at =Duxx+R(x,t,u(x,t)), (1.1)

where x is space coordinate, t is time, D is the diffusion coefficient
and R(x, t, u(x, t)) is a reaction term representing protein production
and its degradation.

Equation (1.1) was proposed in (Mjolsness et al. 1991) for de-
scription of the dynamics of internal state of nuclei in blastoderm of
D. melanogaster embryo and originally contained the diffusion term
in discrete form. The model took into account three major processes
essential for embryo development: synthesis of proteins, their

diffusion between nuclei and degradation. The same approach was
used in (Driever and Nusslein—Volhard, 1988) to explain the dy-
namics of the Bicoid maternal protein in D. melanogaster embryo. It
is known as the synthesis-diffusion-degradation model (Gregor
et al., 2007). The model equation (1.1) with diffusion term in con-
tinuous or in discrete form have been widely used in the last two
decades for description of diffusive transport of proteins, e.g., syn-
thesized by maternal gene bicoid or gap genes in D. melanogaster
embryo blastoderm during early embryogenesis (Drocco et al.,
2012; Gregor et al., 2005; Gursky et al., 2004; Mjolsness et al.,
1991; Reinitz et al., 1995).

However, (1.1) has a crucial drawback: it is based on the phe-
nomenological Fick law for mass ﬂux, which was formulated
for Brownian motion of non-inertial particles, and, therefore, it
is applicable only for description of light particles motion, for
example, in an ideal gas. Proteins are heavy complex organic
molecules, and for this reason, the classical approach is hardly
applicable for modelling of protein transfer.

Mathematically, non-inertial description of inertial particle
transport leads to an infinite velocity of disturbances propagation
defined by (1.1). For example, when R(x,t) E 0 and with initial
condition u(x, 0) = 6(x), where 5(x) is the Dirac delta function, the
fundamental solution to (1.1) has the form:

u(x, t) = (1/\/2—7tt) exp (—x2/4Dt), (1.2)

and it is positive for any finite values of x, therefore a sudden change
of a substance concentration somewhere will immediately transfer
to any arbitrary point. The profile of (1.2) at certain time moment is
shown in Figure 1a (see, e.g. Masoliver and Weiss, 1996; Sobolev,
1997; Weiss, 2002), and we call this phenomenon of an infinite
velocity as ‘the diffusion paradox’ for brevity. Immediate disturb-
ances propagation contradicts with experiments, in which proteins
move in an embryo very slow, with the velocities about 1—5 um/s
(see Gregor et al., 2005, 2007).

In 1948, Cattaneo proposed the telegraph equation, containing
additional ‘relaxation time’ and, therefore, free from the diffusion
paradox, to model mass (heat) transfer. The fundamental solution
to the equation describes propagation of disturbances with finite
velocity, but due to the wave-like behaviour it may reach negative
values inappropriate from biological viewpoint. Furthermore, the
fundamental solution to the telegraph equation with the Dirac delta
function as an initial condition contains two discontinuous wave
fronts, propagating in opposite directions.

In 1989, Joseph and Preziosi proposed the description of heat
transfer based on the refined model for flux of rheological ﬂuid in
the Earth crust introduced in 1929 by H. Jeffreys. Similarly, one can

Fig. 1. Profiles of the solutions to (1.1) and (1.5) without synthesis terms for
x>0 and the Dirac delta function 6(x) as an initial condition (Joseph and
Preziosi, 1989b)

obtain an equation for determination of mass transfer via elimin-
ation of the ﬂux function from the mass balance equation:

ut(x,t) = —]x(x, t) + R(x,t,u(x, t)), (1.3)
and the Jeffreys refined formula for ﬂux:
](x, t) + r]t(x, t) = —(D + D1) ux(x, t) — rDluxt(x, t). (1.4)
The resulting Jeffreys-type equation:
tut, + u, — tD1 um = (D + D1) um + R(x, t) + tR,(x, t), (1.5)

contains two additional parameters, as compared with (1.1), namely,
the relaxation time t and the second diffusion coefficient D1, thus
taking into account the particle inertia. The particular solution to (1.5)
at certain time moment under the assumptions R(x, t) = 0, u(x, 0)
= 6(x), ut(x, 0) = 0 is shown in Figure 1b. It can be seen that a small
amount of particles occurs at infinity, and the diffusion paradox for
the Dirac delta function as an initial condition is not completely elimi-
nated by the proposed model. However, even in this case the Jeffreys-
type equation describes formation of a smooth wave front from an ini-
tial sharp discontinuity, that is always positive, and its propagation
with finite velocity. Applications of the Jeffreys—type equation to differ-
ent physical problems can be found in (Joseph and Preziosi 1989a,b;
Rukolaine and Samsonov, 2013; Sobolev, 1997).

Due to similarity between heat and mass transfer both the tele-
graph equation and the Jeffreys-type equation are of interest for de-
scription of protein transport in biological systems. Nevertheless, the
maternal and gap genes expression in D. melanogaster embryo is often
modelled by means of the parabolic reaction diffusion equation, which
limited applicability has been widely discussed (see Fort and Mendez,
2002; Masoliver and Weiss, 1996). The conventional model is still
popular due to simplicity and similarity at large time scales of the fun-
damental solutions to all parabolic, the telegraph and the Jeffreys-type
equations, as shown in Rukolaine and Samsonov, (2013).

In this article, we apply the mathematical model consisting of the
coupled Jeffreys-type equations with non-linear reaction terms to
study the dynamics of protein concentrations in gene network of four
gap genes. The equations are solved numerically, and the results will
be compared with experimental data and with numerical solution to
the model based on the conventional diffusion Equation (1.1).

2 Methods

2.1 Model problem of dynamics of protein
concentration

Consider the model problem of finding the distribution of pro-
teins in an embryo, when maternal gene protein behaviour is
described. According to the simplest model (Gregor et al., 2005;
Houchmandzadeh et al., 2002), a protein of the maternal gene
bicoid (bcd) diffuses through an embryo and decays uniformly with
constant rate )2, therefore the reaction term R(x, t) in (1.5 ) can be
written as —yu(x,t). The embryo is assumed to have no mass
exchange with an external environment. The protein is synthesized
at the point source located near the anterior pole of an embryo, and
the production rate is assumed to be constant in time (Gregor et al.,
2005 , 2008), that leads to the boundary conditions:

(J(x7t) ' nin(x))|x=0 : q)  t) ' nin(x))|x=L : 0’ (2-1-1)

where n,” is the internal normal, q is the source intensity. Initial
conditions are specified in general form:

“(xit)|t=0 = (p(x)aut(x7t)|t=0 =  (2-1-2)

Taking into account the continuity of ] (x, t) in [0, L] X [0, T] and
constant ﬂux at the domain boundary, the equation for ﬂux, written
for x = 0 and x = L, leads to the differential equations for functions
ux|x=0 and ux|x=L, respectively, which depend on t. Initial conditions
of the Neumann type for both equations can be obtained from
(2.1.2) in a form:

We rewrite (1.5), now containing R(x, t,u(x,t)) = —yu(x, t), in
the form:

where 53 = 881:; + at + 68x,” — cram is the differential operator of the
problem, the equation coefficients are a = m, 5 = —r D1x,
a = (D +D1)x, [3 = —vx andx E 1/(1 + W)-

The Fourier method leads to the exact solution to the problem:

u(x, t) = w(x, t) + fcos (nkx/L) Sk(t), (2.1.6)
k=0

where w(x, t) is an auxiliary function, and both w(x, t) and Sk (t) are
defined in Supplementary notes, available online.

2.2 Analysis of initial conditions

Integrating (1.3) with R(x,t,u(x,t)) = —yu(x, t) and boundary
conditions (2.1.1) over [0; L] and applying the Laplace transform,
we obtain the following equation for the Laplace image 5:

L L
(p+))[0u (x,p)dx=%+[0 (p(x)dx. (2.2.1)

After the Laplace transform of the Jeffreys-type equation (2.2.1)
and integration of it with (2.1.3), (2.1.4) and (2.1.1), we obtain the
following integral condition:

L L
[ tux) dx = q — v) <p(x) dx, (2.2.2)
0 0

which means that in general the function ¢(x) cannot be equal to
zero within [0; L], since (2.2.2) may not be valid. There is a different
way to obtain (2.2.2) by integration of (1.3) over [0; L], assuming
t: 0 and substituting the initial conditions (2.1.2). Therefore,
(2.2.2) implies the mass conservation at the initial time moment.

2.3 Model for dynamics of gap gene proteins
concentration

To define the reaction term R(x, t, u(x, t)) in (1.5 ) a synthesis func-
tion g(r1(x,t)) was introduced (see Mjolsness et al., 1991), which
takes into account that upstream segmentation genes (e.g. maternal
genes) regulates the expression of downstream genes (e.g. gap genes)
and interactions between the gap genes in the gene network.
Furthermore, the gap genes are supposed to degrade uniformly with
constant rate, that leads to R(x,t,u(x,t)) = —yu(x, t) +g(r1(x, t)),
and therefore (1.5) can be written as:

531496, 1‘) — ﬁu(x, 1‘) = xg(11(x, t)) + 8g:(11(x, t))- (231)

Therefore, the dynamics of protein concentrations in the gene net-
work consisting of four gap genes is described formally by means of

the Jeffreys-type equations together with boundary conditions and
initial conditions:

53(2) “(0 _ ﬁe) “(2') 2 X0) game) 1, 8(2) ggi>(,7(i)),

coupled via the non-linear terms g(i)(-), which determine synthesis
of protein 2' and depend on 110), representing a contribution of all fac-
tors to regulation of gene 2' expression. The gene reaction on regula-
tors inﬂuence has the threshold behaviour, therefore the synthesis
function is assumed to be proportional to the ‘sigmoid’ curve, and its
argument contains the additive contributions of all regulatory factors:

where the constant GU) denotes the maximum intensity level of
gene 2' protein synthesis, the matrix coefficients Tl characterize
the level and type of regulation of gene 2' protein by other gap
genes, Eik are the coefficients of regulation by maternal genes,
which concentrations denoted as 121‘, and 1‘“) denotes the contribu-
tion by external factors, that is assumed to be homogeneous in
space and time. The function g(r1(x,t)) is widely used in gap
genes expression modelling (see, e.g. Gursky et al., 2004, 2008;
Jaeger et al., 2004; Kozlov et al., 2012; Mjolsness et al., 1991;
Reinitz et al., 1995).

For numerical simulation, the initial protein concentrations data
were taken from the database FlyEx (FlyEx: Electronic database on
segmentation genes expression in Drosophila; http://urchin.spbcas.
ru/flyex, http://flyex.ams.sunysb.edu/FlyEx), containing experimen-
tal data for concentrations of the Drosophila gap gene proteins at
different stages of development.

Analysis of initial conditions for (2.3.1) is similar to that for
(2.1.5 ). The boundary conditions on ] (x, t) are homogeneous, since
gap genes are expressed inside an embryo, but not at the boundaries.
Taking into account the condition:

L L L
J ¢(x) dx =J g (r1|t=0) dx — yJ (p(x) dx. (2.3.5)
0 0 0

one can guarantee the problem (2.3.2) to be well-posed.

2.4 Implementation of numerical simulation method

The system (2.1.2) was solved numerically using the explicit finite
difference method in spatial domain (0; 100%) of an embryo length
(EL) from t = 0 up to 68th minute of development. We used the cen-
tral difference approximation for a)” and the backward difference

3 Results

We compared the results of numerical simulation in the framework
of the new model based on the coupled Jeffreys-type equations
(2.3.2) with the experimental data from the FlyEx database in
the bounded region (from 47 to 92% of EL) along the anterior-
posterior (AP) axis. The model parameters were obtained via fitting
the numerical solution to data. The value of residual mean square
(RMS):

 

RMS = \/<1/N>Z (49(4),... — 49(4)...)2 (3.1)

n,i,k

was used for the evaluation of the solution quality. Each difference
in (3.1) was calculated between the numerical solution unum and
the experimental data udata for concentrations, and summation was
performed over all nuclei n, proteins 2' and time moments tk, for

which the experimental data are available. The expression patterns
were estimated also visually by biologists.

We decided to obtain one and the same parameter set suitable
for fitting the experimental data for both the wild-type embryo and
the mutant in gene Kruppel (Kr—l simultaneously. To do so, we per-
formed the numerical simulation to model an embryo development
during 68 min of cycle 14 for two different genotypes. The spatial
distributions of gap genes proteins concentrations in comparison
with the experimental data for each gene at time classes 3, 5 and 7
in the division cycle 14A is shown in Figures 2 and 3.

The first set of 10 calculations was performed in the whole
domain (0%; 100%) with the Neumann boundary conditions, while
the parameters were found in such a way, that the approximate solu-
tion fits the experimental data only in truncated domain (47%;
92%) of EL. One of the reasons of narrowing of the fitting region is
that an embryo has nearly an ellipsoidal form, and, therefore, the
whole EL interval (0%; 100%) cannot be in a microscope focus at
the same time. As a result, the data near the ends of the AP axis both
in wild-type embryos and in the Kr' mutants seems to be unreliable.
Moreover, our computations show unsatisfactory results when
fitting region was equal to (35%; 92%) of EL. The failure may be
explained, in particular, by that the gap genes have different cross-
regulatory actions in the AP parts, consequently, representation of
the regulators action on their targets along the whole AP interval via
one and the same parameter TI is simple, but not sufficient to de-
scribe gene expression in details (Kozlov et al., 2012). Among 10
calculations the best value of RMS was RMS 2 8.502. The obtained
values of the regulation matrix coefficients are presented in Table 1.

The second set of 10 calculations was performed and the ap-
proximate solution was fitted in the region (47%; 92%) of EL with
the Dirichlet boundary conditions. The FlyEx database contains the
values of protein concentrations only in certain discrete time

4 Discussion

An application of the Jeffreys-type third-order non-linear partial dif-
ferential equation to description of gap genes expression was con-
sidered. We analyzed also the statement of the initial-boundary
problem for the Jeffreys-type equation and obtained the relationship
for functions in the initial conditions, necessary for the problem to
be well posed.

The results of the first set of 10 calculations demonstrate slightly
better quantitative fitting to the experimental data on gap gene ex-
pression in Drosophila blastoderm as compared with the conven-
tional model (1.1) with lowest RMS: 8.502 value for the model
with the Jeffreys-type equation and the Neumann boundary condi-
tions, while for the conventional model the lowest value is
RMS 2 8.532. Therefore we conclude that the numerical solution of
the new model fits the experimental data with better accuracy. The
obtained values of the regulation matrix coefficients, presented in
Table 1, are in good agreement with results of regulation type
shown experimentally (for review, see Jaeger, 2011) and with regu-
lation type data presented for conventional diffusion model (see
Kozlov et al., 2012).

Graphs in Figure 2 demonstrate qualitatively similar behaviour
of concentration profiles as compared with the conventional model,
i.e., the experimental concentration profiles in the wild-type embryo
are fitted with reliable accuracy, except the expression domain of
hunchback (bl?) at the left end of the region. The same problem
exists in the Kr‘ mutant model. Moreover, the expression domain
of Giant (Gt) in the Kr‘ mutant was narrower, than in experiment,
and its maximum was sharper. Finally, the position of hi? maximum
concentration was shifted to the right from the position of experi-
mental concentration maximum, and domain expression of hi? is
spread to left side.

To avoid these disadvantages we performed another set of 10
calculations in the narrowed computational domain (47%; 92%) of

EL with boundary conditions of the Dirichlet type. The lowest
RMS: 7.317 demonstrates substantially better fit to experimental
data in comparison to the Neumann boundary conditions, therefore
we conclude that the Dirichlet boundary conditions provide better
results for modelling the gap genes expression than the conditions of
the Neumann type. The values of the regulation matrix coefficients,
presented in Table 1, are also in good agreement with experiments
and with results for conventional model, as well as for the model
with the Neumann boundary conditions.

From the graphs in Figure 3 it can be seen that the modelled con-
centration profiles are similar to those for the model with the
Neumann boundary conditions in Figure 2. Nevertheless is should
be noted that the usage of the Dirichlet boundary conditions allows
us to predict the expression of all genes very close to the experimen-
tal data near the computational domain boundaries for both geno-
types. However, the narrower expression domain of Gt protein,
its sharp maximum and the shifted hh expression maximum in Kr—
mutant require further study.

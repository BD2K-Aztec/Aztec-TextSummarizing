ABSTRACT

Motivation: In early stage drug development, it is desirable to assess
the toxicity of compounds as quickly as possible. Biomarker genes
can help predict whether a candidate drug will adversely affect a given
individual, but they are often difficult to discover. In addition, the
mechanism of toxicity of many drugs and common compounds is
not yet well understood. The Japanese Toxicogenomics Project pro-
vides a large database of systematically collected microarray samples
from rats (liver, kidney and primary hepatocytes) and human cells
(primary hepatocytes) after exposure to 170 different compounds in
different dosages and at different time intervals. However, until
now, no intuitive user interface has been publically available, making
it time consuming and difficult for individual researchers to explore the
data.

Results: We present Toxygates, a user-friendly integrated analysis
platform for this database. Toxygates combines a large microarray
dataset with the ability to fetch semantic linked data, such as path-
ways, compound—protein interactions and orthologs, on demand. It
can also perform pattern-based compound ranking with respect to
the expression values of a set of relevant candidate genes. By using
Toxygates, users can freely interrogate the transcriptome’s response
to particular compounds and conditions, which enables deep explor-
ation of toxicity mechanisms.

Availability and implementation: Toxygates is freely available to the
public at http://toxygates.nibio.go.jp.

1 INTRODUCTION

Toxicogenomics is one of several recent ‘omics’ approaches to the
safety assessment of chemical compounds in early stage drug
development. Gene expression analysis of animals’ target
organs after drug administration can help assess potential tox-
icity before phenotypic appearance through the use of biomarker
genes (Fielden et al., 2007; Uehara et al., 2008).

The Japanese Toxicogenomics Project (TGP) (Uehara et al.,
2010), an initiative that set out to collect a large amount of

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

toxicogenomics data systematically, began in 2002 as a joint
goverment—private sector project. This project lasted for 10
years, ending in 2012. Its ﬁrst outcome was the original
T G-GA T Es (Toxicogenomics Project-Genomics Assisted
Toxicity Evaluation System), which is not open to the public.
TG—GATEs is a data storage and toxicity assessment system for
data analysis as part of the project. In early 2011, most of the
TGP data, including the gene expression, biochemical, blood and
histopathological data, as well as high resolution images of
in vivo organ samples, were released to the public through the
Open T G—GAT Es (OTG) Web site (http://toxico.nibio.go.jp).
However, given the current form of OTG, it is not easy for
users to explore these gene expression data on their personal
computers, because of the large amount of data as well as its
static organization and raw format. For example, to extract cor-
relations between gene expression and variables, such as time or
dose level, the user would have to download binary ﬁles (in the
Affymetrix CEL format), extract human-readable expression
values and perform tasks such as normalization before this
kind of analysis could begin. To make it more accessible, we
now introduce Toxygates, an integrated web-based user-friendly
analysis platform.

The TGP data have been produced in accordance with well-
planned experimental conditions. There are two main types of
data: in vivo data and in vitro data. The condition pattern of the
in vivo data, which was collected from Rattus norvegicus, is the
combination of four time points (3 h, 6h, 9h, 24 h), four dose
levels (control, low, middle, high) and two organs (liver,
kidney). These samples were taken after a single dose of the
studied compound was administered. Repeat dose data are also
available for in vivo experiments. In the case of repeat dose
samples, the parameters are identical to the single dose ones,
except that the time points are 4 days, 8 days, 15 days and 29
days after the initial administration. The condition pattern of
the in vitro data, available from R. Norvegicus and Homo
Sapiens, is the combination of three time points (2 h, 8h,
24 h), four dose levels (control, low, middle, high) and one
cell type (primary hepatocytes). These parameters potentially
allow investigators to conduct not only classiﬁer analysis, but
also time series analysis, dose effect analysis and vivo—vitro
bridging analysis.

The value of a particular dataset is greater if a larger number
of perspectives on it are available. It is simply possible to answer
more questions when datasets can be related to each other.

Toxygates

 

Clearly, it is desirable to integrate OTG with other datasets to
the greatest possible extent. In Toxygates, data such as pathways,
proteins and compound targets from a variety of databases are
integrated and displayed alongside the microarray data, and the
basic architecture is designed to allow for easy integration of
additional data sources in the future. This is achieved in part
by making use of linked semantic data in the resource description
format (RDF) (Berners-Lee et al., 2001) (http://www.w3.org/
rdf/). RDF makes it easy to combine and evolve datasets in an
ad hoc fashion while still obtaining well-deﬁned results. Thus,
Toxygates is a rich analysis platform that allows for easy inves-
tigation of the OTG data, offering several different kinds of ana-
lysis functions and data perspectives as well as extensible data
integration.

2 RESULTS

Toxygates allows users to explore the available data interactively,
optionally downloading them at any stage of processing.
Analysis begins by choosing a dataset. A dataset is a group of
related DNA microarrays (targeting messenger RNA) with a
common species, dose type (single or repeat) and organ
(if in vivo) or in vitro cell type. For example, one dataset would
be rat/in vivo/liver/single dose (RVLS). Table 1 gives an overview
of the six datasets in Toxygates.

Data are viewed from the perspective of sample groups; we
deﬁne a sample group as a collection of samples. Typically,
each experiment, speciﬁed by a combination of the compound,
dose level and measurement time point, was done in biological
triplicate (for the in vivo data), and thus such a combination
includes three samples (microarrays). For example, a sample
group can be deﬁned as consisting of methapyrilene, high dose,
24h and acetaminophen, middle dose, 24 h. In the RVLS dataset,
this group would contain six samples: three from each com-
pound, dose and time combination.

Such groups can easily be contrasted with each other, and
genes can be analyzed for differential expression. Microarray
expression values are stored in a prenormalized format (see
Methods for the normalization details) and can easily be inte-
grated with annotations from external datasets, such as Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways
(Kanehisa et al., 2012), Gene Ontology terms (Gene Ontology
Consortium, 2000) and ChEMBL (Gaulton et al., 2012) or
DrugBank (Knox et al., 2011) compounds. Such annotations
are obtained dynamically from linked data (Resource
Description Format, RDF) endpoints. These tools economize
the researchers’ time and enable them to proceed to more de-
tailed analysis more quickly.

2.1 User interface

Toxygates is structured around a loose workﬂow consisting of
six different screens. For the most part, it is assumed that the
user wants to proceed from known compounds and experimental
conditions to extraction of interesting genes and proteins (cor-
responding to microarray probes). However, by using the com-
pound ranking feature, it is also possible to proceed from genes or
proteins to compounds. By alternating between these two

analysis types, users can iteratively reﬁne their initial hypothesis
and gather more evidence.
The six main screens are the following:

0 Dataset selection. On this screen, the user selects a basic
dataset to examine, such as RVLS (see above). In general,
data analysis in Toxygates is performed within a single
dataset. Because of the lack of a standard procedure for
comparing cells from different species, or in vivo data with
in vitro data or repeated with single doses, we do not per-
form such comparisons automatically. However, by using
the tools available in Toxygates, users can easily carry out
such comparisons manually.

0 Sample group deﬁnitions. On this screen, the user deﬁnes
sample groups by selecting ﬁrst compounds, and then
sample times and dose levels that they are interested in
(Fig. 1). On this screen, compound ranking can also be per-
formed (to be discussed below).

0 Probe selection. On this screen, the user can optionally
choose the microarray probes they would like to view in
the next step. If the user does not want to select a subset
of the available probes, they may simply skip this step to
view all probes (about 31 000 for rat and 50 000 for human).
Probes can be selected based on annotations such as
Gene Ontology terms, KEGG pathways, ChEMBL and

DrugBank compound targets and so on. In the latter three
cases, data are obtained from remote RDF endpoints (see
Methods for implementation details). Toxygates was de-
signed to let us add new probe information sources easily
in the future, to further assist probe ﬁltering and thus toxi-
cological hypothesis testing.

0 View data. This screen is where the main data inspection and
analysis is performed. The user can view expression values
for the groups that they have deﬁned by viewing pages of
25—100 probes (the amount is user conﬁgurable) at a time.
Welch’s t—test, Mann—Whitney U-test and the fold-change
difference columns can be added to identify the most signiﬁ-
cant probes for discriminating between any two different
groups. It is possible to display or hide a number of dynamic
columns, which fetch associations such as KEGG pathways
and EggNOG (Powell et al., 2012) orthologous proteins
from remote RDF datasets, displaying them alongside the
related expression values. Of the 170 compounds in
Toxygates, some are known to interact directly with rat or
human proteins, as annotated in ChEMBL and DrugBank.
These compounds are also displayed as dynamic columns
alongside genes that produce the target proteins. As with
probe annotation sources, it is easy for us to add additional
dynamic columns over time as the need arises. In addition to
these features, the user can view charts to inspect the behav-
ior of a certain probe visually, as well as export the data
(under the Action menu) to comma-separated value (CSV)
ﬁles or to the TargetMine system (Chen et al., 2011) for
further analysis, such as biological enrichment, a type of
analysis that Toxygates does not currently perform.

0 Pathologies. This screen displays the pathologies that were
found in those samples that are part of the current user-
deﬁned groups. Pathologies are described using a controlled
vocabulary that is speciﬁc to OTG (http://toxico.nibio.go.jp/
open-tggates/doc/pathology_parameter.pdf).

0 Sample details. This screen displays all metadata associated
with those samples that are part of the current user-deﬁned
groups, such as blood composition and biological data (for
in vivo samples) and the experimental conditions.

2.2 Example: glutathione depletion analysis

As an example use case, we next show how to apply Toxygates to
the study of glutathione depletion. The liver and the kidney are
major detoxiﬁcation organs. In the liver, glutathione, which scav-
enges reactive oxygen species, is one of the major detoxiﬁcation
players. It conjugates target toxic compounds using its thiol
group and exports the conjugated compounds into bile ducts.
Thus far, two toxicological mechanisms have been reported for
drug-induced glutathione depletion. One is inhibition of glutathi-
one synthesis, and the other is excessive usage of glutathione. An
overdose of glutathione depleting compounds, such as acet-
aminophen, may lead to hepatotoxicity through depletion of
glutathione (Gao et al., 2010). Here, by using Toxygates, we
explore the differentially expressed genes that are affected by
glutathione depleting compounds, which are known in advance.
Toxygates helps us conﬁrm the hypothesis as well as gather add-
itional evidence for it and discover related compounds.

As glutathione depleting compounds, we selected acetamino-
phen, methapyrilene and nitrofurazone. We deﬁned a sample
group for this positive set using the data points at 24h of all
three dose levels. The 24h time point was chosen, as the toxico-
logical effects of each compound are visible more clearly here
compared with 3 h, 6 h and 9 h. Although Toxygates provides six
different datasets (shown above), in this example we focus only
on rat/in vivo/liver/single data for space reasons. As non-gluta-
thione affected compounds, we selected erythromycin, gentami-
cin, glibenclamide, hexachlorobenzene, isoniazid, penicillamine
and perhexilline and deﬁned a sample group for this negative
set using the data points at 24h of all three dose levels
(Fig. 1). After deﬁning these two sample groups, we may focus
only on the probes corresponding to relevant genes, to obtain a
more helpful perspective. In this example, we selected the 42
probes belonging to the glutathione metabolism pathway. After
making this selection, we can display the log-2 ratio fold change
of the individual probes. By clicking ‘Add T-test’, we can per-
form Welch’s t-test to compare the mean of the two sample
groups and add a column to show the P—values calculated. The
top four ranked probes are Mgst2 (microsomal glutathione
S-transferase 2), G6pd (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase),
Gsr (glutathione reductase) and G010 (glutamate—cysteine
ligase). Gclc is known to accelerate glutathione synthesis, and
Gsr and G6pd are involved in the conversion of glutathione
from the oxidized form to the reduced one. Mgst2 is glutathi-
one-S-transferase, which is the main enzyme for detoxiﬁcation of
toxic compounds by the conjugation reaction.

By clicking the icon on the very left side, we can view the
temporal and dose changes of the values graphically (Fig. 2).

2.3 Compound ranking

For the most part, the features mentioned previously help the
user discover interesting genes, proteins or probes or annotations
such as pathways, for some pre-selected compounds and experi-
mental conditions. However, by using the compound ranking
feature, which is available on the sample group deﬁnition
screen, it is also possible to go from genes or probes to com-
pounds. Compound ranking assigns a match score to each com-
pound and sorts the compound list by descending score. Ranking
is done on the basis of match rules, each of which consists of a
match type and a gene, the time series of which will be the
basis of the matching. The end result of the ranking will thus
highlight compounds where a single dose level ﬁts the speciﬁed
behavior of the speciﬁed genes as closely as possible (Fig. 3).
Precise details of the ranking methods are given in the
Supplementary Material.

As an example, we apply compound ranking to the glutathi-
one depletion data that were inspected in the previous section.
The two probes in the glutathione metabolism pathway with the
smallest P—values were G6pd and Mgst2. We deﬁne two ranking
rules based on these genes. By inspecting the charts on the data
screen, we ﬁnd that glutathione depleting compounds tend to
upregulate these genes. Thus, initially we select total upregulation
as the match type for both. With these rules, the top nine match-
ing compounds include the original three that we used in our
group deﬁnition (Table 2). The scores simply reﬂect the sum of
all positive log-2 folds. We also attempt a second ranking by

Fig. 3. Compounds have been ranked by their behavior with respect to the Mgst2 and G6pd genes

using the reference compound rule, which attempts to ﬁnd com-
pounds that behave similarly to a given reference. By attempting
rankings based on each of our original three compounds, we ﬁnd
that using nitrofurazone and high dose as the reference ranks all
three highest. In this case, the scores (Table 3) are based on
Pearson correlation and, therefore, cannot be compared numer-
ically with the scores from upregulation.

Only the highest scoring 14 of all 158 compounds for RVLS
have been shown. Out of these 14, 9 are shared between the two
ranking methods. H/M/L in the parentheses indicates the best
matching dose. We also indicate whether the compound is
known to conjugate with glutathione (GSH) and deplete GSH,
respectively. Given that we are aiming to ﬁnd compounds that
deplete GSH by conjugation, the top ranked compounds can

broadly be classiﬁed as true positives, false positives and com-
pounds with unclear or different relations to GSH. True positives
are, for example, phorone (van Doorn et al., 1978), bromoben—
zene (Comporti et al., 1991; Monks et al., 1982), coumarin
(Luchini et al., 2008), omeprazole WVeidolf et al., 1992), diethyl
maleate (Boyland and Chasseaud, 1967) and phenacetin (Hinson,
1983). False positives are propylthiouracil (Banerjee et al., 1998)
and butylated hydroxyanisole (Borroz et al., 1994). Examples of
compounds with unclear or different GSH relation are methima-
zole (Mizutani et al., 1999), carbon tetrachloride (Beddowes et al.,
2003), bortezomib (Nerini-Molteni et al., 2008) and thieoaceta-
mide (Lotkova et al., 2007). A full classiﬁcation of the top ranked
compounds is given in the Supplementary Material. As would be
expected, the top ranking results contain not only compounds

whose mechanism is similar but also whose mechanism are dif-
ferent but induce similar expression patterns for focused genes.

As we mentioned previously, glutathione uses its thiol group
to the conjugation. The sulfur in the thiol group is provided from
L-cysteine amino acids. To gather additional evidence for our
hypothesis, an examination of the expression level of other en-
zymes, which are affected by the amount of L-cysteine, might be
valuable. To ﬁnd other enzymes that use L-cysteine, we surveyed
the pathway maps where L-cysteine appears. Furthermore, to
simplify the interpretation of data, we extracted only enzymes
that irreversibly use L-cysteine as a substrate. Thus we found
‘Ppcs’ in the coenzyme A biosynthesis pathway. This enzyme
acts on L-cysteine directly, and thus would be affected by the
amount of L-cysteine. By adding upregulation of Ppcs alongside
G6pd and Mgst2 and ranking again, the false-positive com-
pounds like buthionine sulfoximine and ethionine, which do
not conjugate glutathione but inhibit Gss enzyme activity, are
ranked down from 45th to 56th and 94th to 131st, respectively.
Thus, by considering the possible interactions in detail, it is pos-
sible to gradually reﬁne the ranking to extract more probable
compounds.

2.4 Data architecture

The Toxygates data analysis platform is based on the integration
of diverse linked data—obtained from RDF datasets from e.g.
SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL) end-
points—with a large DNA microarray core dataset. This hy-
brid—and, we believe, novel—architecture combines the beneﬁts
of two different approaches to data integration: data warehous-
ing and linked data (Goble and Stevens, 2008). The former pro-
vides high performance for static unchanging data, and the latter
provides ﬂexibility for diverse and frequently updated data
sources. Because many of the RDF datasets are stored and
updated remotely (Supplementary Table S1), updates will trans-
parently feed into Toxygates at the time when they are published.
Many RDF datasets are displayed as dynamic columns in our
main data screen alongside expression values and probes. Our
fundamental design permits us to add additional columns
quickly based on data from remote services, as long as
SPARQL queries that allow us to look up the information
based on gene, protein or probe identiﬁers can be written.

3 DISCUSSION

3.1 Toxicogenomics databases

A small number of databases that are open to the public and
closely related to OTG and Toxygates exist. In general, toxico-
genomics data are transcriptomics data of animals that have
been treated with drugs or chemical compounds. Thus, transcrip-
tomics information, the kinds and dosages of administered com-
pounds, studied organs and associated information like
biochemical parameters other than gene expression data are all
essential parts of toxicogenomics datasets. To the best of our
knowledge, there exist no other open toxicogenomics databases
fully comparable with OTG, if this deﬁnition as well as the mas-
sive size and the well-documented standard operating procedures
of the latter are taken into account.

Toxygates

 

Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (Davis et al., 2013) is
a knowledge base of relations among drugs, genes and diseases
that were derived from published literature by curators.
However, this database does not contain actual transcriptomics
data measurements. Gene Expression Omnibus (Barrett et al.,
2011) is the largest repository of gene expression data in the
world. This database contains a large amount of gene expression
data associated with treatment by bioactive compounds. The
number of such experiments is being increased, but the experi-
mental targets and protocols, such as species, strains, adminis-
tration methods, time points and dose controls are not uniﬁed.
The lack of such uniﬁed experimental conditions can sometimes
be a critical obstacle to making efﬁcient use of the data from a
toxicological point of view. ArrayExpress (Rustici et al., 2013) is
another large expression data repository, maintained by the
European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI), with characteristics
similar to those of Gene Expression Omnibus. DrugMatrix
(Ganter et al., 2005) has in vivo rat microarray data for >600
compounds. However, although having just 170 compounds,
OTG has a larger and uniform amount of dose levels and time
points for each, enabling deep and systematic exploration.

The Connectivity Map (Lamb et al., 2006) is an integrated
microarray database where samples are associated with the ad-
ministration of some compound. Like Toxygates, it permits a
form of compound ranking. For pattern matching and rank
scoring, the authors have chosen to use the Kolmogorov—
Smirnov statistic to gracefully handle situations where several
different platforms are present. Because OTG is based on a
single platform, Toxygates is able to use a simple Pearson cor-
relation statistic instead.

ToxBank (Kohonen et al., 2013) is a project that aims to pro-
vide a comprehensive web-based resource for toxicity research
data and protocols, as well as related compound and biomaterial
information. It also aims to be a platform for data sharing be-
tween investigators. Like Toxygates, it makes use of both linked
data and data warehousing approaches. ToxBank has a broader
scope than Toxygates, which aims to provide well-integrated
tools for microarray data analysis only.

3.2 Data warehousing and linked data

Data integration is a central problem in bioinformatics.
However, there are not yet universally accepted solutions for
data problems such as varying quality, heterogeneity of identi-
ﬁers and accessions and unclear semantics. A useful general
review of bioinformatics data integration is provided by Goble
and Stevens (Goble and Stevens, 2008).

In Toxygates, we combine two approaches with different char-
acteristics. First, data warehousing is perhaps the most heavy-
weight approach but also most efﬁcient if the data perspectives
and usage scenarios that are needed can be relied on to be rela-
tively unchanged over time. In this approach, data are scraped
from multiple source databases and cleaned to ﬁt together for
particular usage scenarios, often by using custom parsers. Data
access can be quick and efﬁcient, as all of the data are located in
one place. One drawback is that updating the integrated data to
a new version when the source databases are updated may
require a lot of manual work. A popular data warehousing
framework is InterMine (Lyne et al., 2007), which was originally

developed for the FlyMine database; it is also used by e.g.
TargetMine (Chen et al., 2011).

In recent years, semantic web technologies such as SPARQL,
RDF and Web Ontology Language (OWL) have become in-
creasingly popular in bioinformatics. These technologies are ex-
amples of linked semantic data, the second part of our hybrid
approach. Linked semantic data emphasize identifying objects by
using Uniform Resource Identiﬁers (URIs), and encoding
resource interrelationships as links to these URIs. Ontologies
are used to help make sense of data that has not previously been
encountered. We believe that semantic web technologies repre-
sent one of the best hopes for bioinformatics data integration so
far. On the other hand, the performance of this essentially
ﬂexible approach cannot always be as good as that of a static
approach like data warehousing. For this reason, Toxygates
combines the strengths of both approaches selectively.

4 METHODS

In this section, we discuss the essential data processing methods used and
design decisions made for Toxygates. A more extensive discussion is given
in the Supplementary Material.

4.1 Microarray data and normalization

Starting from the raw Affymetrix GeneChip data from OTG in CEL
format (available from http://toxico.nibio.go.jp), expression and call
values were extracted by using the Bioconductor Affy package for R
(http://www.bioconductor.org). Two databases were constructed: the ab-
solute value database and the fold database. For absolute values, the
mass function was used with the normalize ﬂag set to ‘true’. The masScalls
function was used to extract calls (present/absent/marginal). For fold
values, the mass function was used again but with normalize set to
‘false’, and the data were normalized by the median value of each
sample. Further details on our treatment of the microarray data are
given in the Supplementary Material.

4.2 RDF-ization of OTG

As a preparatory step in the creation of Toxygates and to support inte-
gration with semantic linked data, OTG data were converted into RDF
format. Included in this conversion were experimental conditions, bio-
chemical, blood and histopathological data, that is, everything except for
RNA expression values and image data was converted. Expression values
were omitted due to size and efﬁciency considerations, and image data
were omitted due to images having no natural representation as RDF
triples (however, in the future, we plan to include links to these images in
the data). The result of this conversion was about 2.4 million triples, ~72
triples per sample for 33 566 samples. The number varies, as samples can
have different numbers of pathological ﬁndings.

Many biological RDF datasets are made available to the public
through SPARQL endpoints, which anybody may query on the web.
Such endpoints are used extensively by Toxygates to retrieve and display
auxiliary information. In this release of Toxygates, as our main focus has
been to provide a user-friendly analysis platform, we do not make our
sample data available through such an endpoint, although we may do so
in the future. Further details on our use of RDF are given in the
Supplementary Material.

5 CONCLUSION

We have described Toxygates, a novel user-friendly analysis plat-
form for OTG, a comprehensive toxicogenomics database

developed in Japan during the span of 10 years. OTG is in itself a
resource of potentially great value for the understanding of tox-
icity mechanisms and the identiﬁcation of biomarker genes, as-
sisting preclinical drug development. Toxygates adds further
value by making this data collection accessible to a large
number of individual researchers and users, providing unique
integrated analysis tools, which include dynamic views of
remote data, as well as making data access simpler and easier
than previously. Toxygates allows users to query OTG both by
going from compounds and experimental conditions to relevant
genes, and by going from relevant genes to compounds, although
currently we place greater emphasis on the former style of inves-
tigation. The current release of Toxygates represents the ﬁrst
public release, and we hope to make several improvements. We
aim to curate and expand the collection of remote RDF datasets
that have been integrated as probe sources and as dynamic col-
umns. We also aim to integrate other gene expression datasets
into Toxygates. Finally, we hope to provide additional valuable
perspectives and data analysis methods in response to user
feedback.

Abstract

Motivation: Next—generation RNA sequencing (RNA—seq) has been widely used to investigate alter—
native isoform regulations. Among them, alternative 3’ splice site (SS) and 5’ SS account for more
than 30% of all alternative splicing (AS) events in higher eukaryotes. Recent studies have revealed
that they play important roles in building complex organisms and have a critical impact on biolo—
gical functions which could cause disease. Quite a few analytical methods have been developed to
facilitate alternative 3’ SS and 5’ SS studies using RNA—seq data. However, these methods have
various limitations and their performances may be further improved.

Results: We propose an empirical Bayes change—point model to identify alternative 3’ SS and 5’ SS.
Compared with previous methods, our approach has several unique merits. First of all, our model
does not rely on annotation information. Instead, it provides for the first time a systematic frame—
work to integrate various information when available, in particularthe useful junction read informa—
tion, in order to obtain better performance. Second, we utilize an empirical Bayes model to effi—
ciently pool information across genes to improve detection efficiency. Third, we provide a flexible
testing framework in which the user can choose to address different levels of questions, namely,
whether alternative 3’ SS or 5’ SS happens, and/or where it happens. Simulation studies and real
data application have demonstrated that our method is powerful and accurate.

With continued development and improvement, next—generation
RNA sequencing (RNA—seq) has become more and more popular,
owing to its affordable cost and advantages over existing technolo—
gies. In addition, its superiorities in detecting transcripts in undeter—
mined genomic sequences and very accurate digital resolution make
it a more attractive technology which is expected to gradually re—
place microarray technology (Wang et 61]., 2009). Many compelling
biological problems, once hard to tackle, can be solved by new
methods built upon RNA—seq. In particular, alternative splice forms

number of genes. They provide a major mechanism for enhancing
transcriptome and proteome diversity, and critically regulate various
biological functions (Kalsotra and Cooper, 2011; Keren et 61].,
2010). Using RNA—seq, people observe that more than 90% of
human genes undergo alternative splicing, a much higher percentage
than anticipated (Blencowe et 61]., 2009; Wang et 61]., 2008). Of vari—
ous alternative splice forms, alternative 3’ SS and 5’ SS are particu—
larly important and constitute more than 30% of all AS events as
revealed by RNA—seq (Wang et 61]., 2008). Several studies have

found that alternative 3’ SS and 5’ SS events are relevant to many
diseases. By analyzing alternative 3’ SS and 5’ SS events, we can ob—
tain precious diagnostic and prognostic information for therapies
(Hammond and Wood, 2011; Singh and Cooper, 2012).

Thanks to high-throughput RNA—seq, genome—wide quantitative
studies on AS events become feasible (Pan et 61]., 2008; Wang et 61].,
2008). Quite a few computational methods have been developed to
detect and identify AS events. These methods can be roughly classi—
fied into three categories based on their strategies. The first cat—
egory, represented by Cufflinks (Trapnell et 61]., 2010), performs
differential splicing detection based on transcript quantification,
which is the most challenging. Short reads, sampled from RNA—seq,
can be aligned to multiple transcripts due to the similarity and over—
laps between alternative transcripts (Huang et 61]., 2013; Li and
Dewey, 2011). It makes the expression estimation of individual tran—
script an undetermined problem. In addition, various sampling
biases, including position—specific biases (Bohnert and Ratsch, 2010;
Li et 61]., 2010; Roberts et 61]., 2011; Wu et 61]., 2011b) and sequence—
specific biases (Roberts et 61]., 2011; Turro et 61]., 2011) in the RNA-
seq data, incur daunting difficulties for accurate transcript quantifi-
cation. Consequently, the efficiency of these methods is diminished
by the uncertainty in transcript quantification.

The second category of methods aims to detect differential splic—
ing by testing differential expression of the annotated events ob—
tained from existing splicing databases. Representative examples in
this category include ALEXA—seq (Griffith et 61]., 2010), MISO (Katz
et 61]., 2010), MATS (Shen et 61]., 2012) and SpliceTrap (Wu et 61].,
2011a). Among them, MISO employs a statistical model to estimate
expression of alternatively spliced exons and isoforms (Katz et 61].,
2010); MATS leverages a Bayesian statistical framework to ﬂexibly
test the hypothesis of differential alternative splicing patterns (Shen
et 61]., 2012). These methods may work well when splicing events
are well and accurately annotated. They are not applicable to detect
novel AS events not cataloged yet in existing annotation databases.

The third category of methods, including DiffSplice (Hu et 61].,
2013), DEXSeq (Anders et 61]., 2012) and FDM (Singh et 61]., 2011),
utilizes splice junction read information to overcome the annotation
dependency limitation. The performances of these methods are
highly dependent on the number and quality of splice junction reads.
Sequencing costs often set limits to sequencing depth and coverage
of RNA—seq datasets (Sims et 61]., 2014) and, consequently, perform-
ance of these junction read—based methods. Furthermore, the num—
ber and quality of aligned splice junction reads will also rely on
sequencing technology as well as read—mapping tools (Engstrom
et al., 2013).

Very recently, Wang et al. (2014) propose a change—point model
which requires no annotation information. It relies on characterizing
the coverage change for detecting alternative polyadenylation
(APA). In principle, it can be applied for detecting 3’/5’ AS events.
However, compared with APA, a key difference for 3’/5’ alternative
splicing is that junction read information can be useful and utilized
for locating splice sites. For example, a simple strategy for calling 3’/
5’ AS events is to identify locations supported by at least N inde—
pendent splice junction reads with different alignment start positions
(Wang et 61]., 2009). It is noted that when sequencing depth is not
enough, a significant proportion of 3’/5’ AS events may not be cov—
ered by junction reads, in particular when using a stringent N
threshold for ensuring quality. Due to the junction read coverage
limitation, there is room for improvement even when sequencing
depth is high. Exon read coverage may be used as clues for 3’/5’ AS
events. We expect that using both coverage and junction read infor-
mation will improve both sensitivity and specificity of AS 3’/5’ calls

compared to relaying solely on junction reads or read coverage. It is
therefore desirable to develop a method that can systematically inte—
grate both junction read information and coverage information.

From a methodology point of view, Wei’s method is a frequestist
approach and fails to pool and exploit information across many
genes under investigation. In addition, it tests only whether there is
a change—point, but not where the change—point is. Thus its change—
point location estimation does not guarantee any multiplicity
control.

In this paper, we develop an empirical Bayes change—point model
for identifying 3’/5’ AS events. Our approach requires no annotation
information and is applicable to detect novel aberrant splicing
events. Compared with previous methods, our approach has several
unique merits. First of all, our model does not rely on annotation in—
formation. Instead, it provides for the first time a systematic frame—
work to integrate read coverage information and junction read or
annotation information, when available, in order to obtain better
performance. Secondly, we utilize an empirical Bayes model to effi—
ciently pool information across genes for improving detection effi—
ciency. Thirdly, we provide a flexible testing framework in which
the user can choose to address different levels of questions, namely,
whether alternative splicing happens, and/or where it happens.
Simulation studies and applications to real data have demonstrated
that our method is powerful and accurate.

2 Methods

2.1 Alternative 3’ SS and 5’ SS selection and change—
point problem
We formulate alternative 3’ SS and 5’ SS selection as a change—point
problem and illustrate it via toy examples in Figure 1. As shown in
Figure 1, different mRNA isoforms, with different expression levels,
are generated from a single gene through the alternative selection of
3’ SS or 5’ SS. The common regions (constitutive exons), shared by
the two isoforms, are expected to have a higher expression level
than the extended regions (spliced regions). As a result, for RNA—seq
data, we expect that the common regions will have higher short read
densities than the extended regions, and the exons with alternative
3’ SS or 5’ SS will have change—points at their 3’ or 5’ splice sites as
illustrated in Figure 1. Thus, we can detect exons with alternative 3’
SS and 5’ SS and their splice sites by detecting the change—points
where the short read densities change.

We model exon 1' with length L,- as a sequence of observations
S,- : (xi1,x,-2, . . . ,xiLl.) ordered in position, where x,,- is the number
of reads (read—count) whose first base mapped to exon 1' at position
1'. Following previous change—point models (Barry and Hartigan,
1993; Denison, 2002; Xuan and Murphy, 2007), we assume the
change—points divide the sequence of observations into K unknown
homogeneous segments, TI : (H1, . . . , UK), such that the data is in—
dependent across different segments

K

P(Si,1zL,-|H) = HMSLHI.)
[3:1

For our alternative 3’ SS and 5’ SS problem, we further assume K = 1
or 2, namely, expecting there is at most one change—point in an exon
read—count sequence. We introduce variable )0,- E {0, 1, 2, . . . , L,- — 1}
for sequence S,- to indicate whether there is a change—point and
where the change—point is. Specifically, p,- = 0 indicates there is no
change—point and p,- : t(t > 0) means that there is a change—point
at position '5, before which read—counts in 5,312, : (xﬂ, . . . ,xir) follow
one homogeneous distribution and after which read—counts in

Fig. 1. Illustration and notation of change-point model for alternative 3’ SS
and 5’ SS problem. (A) and (B) show two AS events: alternative 3’ SS and 5’
SS selection, respectively. Blue rectangles represent constitutive exons (com-
mon regions) and purple rectangles represent alternatively spliced regions
(extended regions). Solid lines and dashed lines indicate the introns and
splicing options, respectively. (C) and (D) are examples of isoforms generated
from alternative 3’ SS and 5’ SS selection, respectively. In (C), isoform 1 has a
higher expression level, while, in (D), isoform 2 has a higher expression level.
(E) and (F) show the results of mapping short reads to the reference genome,
respectively. The reads from isoform 2 are marked as dark red, while reads
from isoform 1 are marked as blue. (G) and (H) show the detailed results of
the exons that contain alternative 3’ SS and 5’ 88. Because of the alternative
3’ $8 or 5’ $8, the common region shared by the two isoforms has a higher
gene expression level than the extended region. Thus, the average number of
short reads (read-count) mapped to the common region will be larger than
the one for extended region. This generates a change-point at the splice site,
which partitions the whole region into two different homogeneous segments
with different average read-counts (Color version of this figure is available at
Bioinformatics online.)

tion, as described in details below.

2.2 Negative Binomial—Beta model

Considering the over—dispersion of RNA—seq data, we use a
Negative Binomial (NB) distribution to characterize the observed
read—counts. As shown in Figure 1, we assume that, when there is no
alternative 3’ SS or 5’ SS in exon 1', the read—counts across the whole
exon 1' will follow a homogeneous Negative Binomial distribution
NB(r, qio), and when there is a change—point, the alternative 3’ SS or
5’ SS exon contains a splice site at position I, dividing the read—count
sequence into two homogeneous parts governed by two homoge—
neous Negative Binomial distributions NB(r, 61,1) and NB(r, qiz), re—
spectively. Formally, we have

0

NB(raqi0)7  pi
xiii/01 N N30, 6111), if pi = T andi S T
NB(r,q,-2), if p,- : ‘L' and j > ‘5

Furthermore, we assume qik follows a Beta distribution
qik N Beta(oc, ﬂ), a conjugate prior of the Negative Binomial distribu-
tion, in order to characterize ﬂuctuations in technical and biological
variation across exons (segments). The hierarchical structure of this
Negative Binomial—Beta model is illustrated by Figure 2.

Differently from a conventional Bayesian approach, we will
estimate the hyperparameters or and ﬂ from the data using an

2.3 Prior information and hot points

When no additional information is available, we assume every pos—
ition has the same prior probability of being a change—point.
Suppose that each sequence S,- has a change—point with a prior prob-
ability P, and then we assign it equally to each candidate position as

If additional information is available, such as splice junction
reads or isoform annotation, we will integrate it and build a more
sophisticated model. Specifically, we assign different weights to dif—
ferent candidate positions allowing them to have different prior
probabilities as derived from extra information. We define as hot
points the positions which are supported by splice junction reads
and/or isoform annotation and more likely to be splice sites. The
basic strategy is that we assign weight W Z 1, which can be esti—
mated from data or pre—specified by the user, to hot points and
weight 1 to ordinary positions. Then the prior probability for each
position will be

short, and

egies. It is very useful when the user has different kinds of prior in-
formation. Assuming that various information has additive effects
on the weight of a candidate position, our model can make full
use of all kinds of information. Suppose there are m different kinds
of information, we can assign weights to candidate positions as
follows

wil. : 1 + ﬁlm’s?) + [3(2) 511]?) + . . . + Mm) 511;”),
where ﬂag) ([2 = 1, 2, . . . ,m) measures the additive effect of informa—
tion [a and 513k) : I {position (i, 1') supported by information k}.
Moreover, interactions of different information can be considered
and added into the weight assigning procedure by introducing inter-
action terms ﬂ(k’)5§ikl’ (12,1 : 1, 2, . . .
notations and splicing reads, a weight assigning strategy can be

where ﬂ(1),ﬂ(2) and ﬂm) measure the additive effects of splice junc—
tion reads, isoform annotation and their interactions, respectively.

By assigning different weights to different candidate positions
and distinguishing hot points from ordinary ones, we can effi—
ciently leverage domain knowledge to improve our model. Since all
parameters (ﬂ(k)) are estimated from data through the empirical
Bayes approach, it does not matter if the domain knowledge is du—
bious or totally wrong. It is noted that there are trade—offs between
simple versus sophisticated strategies. Adopting more sophisticated
strategy will make better usage of prior information on one hand,
but on the other hand, it will introduce more parameters and cause
difficulty in parameter estimation. Thus, appropriate strategies
need to be chosen to balance these trade—offs for different
applications.

2.4 Empirical Bayes estimator

Empirical Bayes estimates combine the Bayesian and frequentist rea—
soning that the prior probability is estimated frequentistically in
order to perform Bayesian inferences (Efron, 2005). This kind of
combination not only gives the Bayesian accurate, objective and
data—related prior information, but also enables frequentists to ob—
tain more test efficiency in solving scientific problems (Efron, 2010;

Zhao et al., 2013). For simplicity and generality, we denote q) as the
set of the parameters for the Negative Binomial—Beta model (r, or and
ﬂ) and the parameters for characterizing prior information (P and
W). The change—point location p,- is latent and we sum them out.
The maximum likelihood estimation of 0), applied to the total N se—
quences, is then

N L,—1
GA) : arg max log  Z Pr(p,-|q))f(S,-|p,-, Q»).
(I)

The optimization algorithm L-BFGS—B (Byrd et al., 1995), a lim—
ited—memory modification of the BFGS quasi—Newton method with
box constraints, is applied to estimate the parameters q). We set ap—
propriate upper and lower bounds for each parameter (e.g. 0 g P
g 1 for the prior proportion of sequences with change—points). All
these procedures are implemented through R (http://www.r—project.

orgl) and Java.

2.5 Empirical Bayes testing and decision procedure
There are two questions we aim to address:

Q1: Detection, which genes have change—points?
Q2: Identiﬁcation, where is the change—point, if any?

For Q1, we only care about whether there is a change—point or
not and are not concerned about where the change—point locates.
For Q2, we aim to find the accurate location of the change—point. In
other words, if we correctly detect a sequence with change—point but
wrongly locate its position, it is still considered as an error. Given
the estimated parameters 0), we have

Pr(pi : 175i; 
2,231 Pro).- = 195502}

 

P7001" = 119191)) =

Let

m0 = P7001: OlSiid’)
it’l‘ : max{Pr(p,— : t|S,—;&>)} ‘L' : 1,2, . . .,L,- — 1.

1

For both two questions, we want to control the false discovery
rate (FDR) (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995) at a nominal level or
and find as many sequences with change—points as possible at the
same time. To obtain this goal, we propose the following two empir—
ical Bayes testing and decision procedures for Q1 and Q2,
respectively.

An empirical Bayes testing and decision procedure for Q1:

1. Order sequences by mo in an ascending order and denote them

Through simulation studies, we will show that these two testing
procedures are powerful and can control FDR at the nominal level.

3 Results

3.1 Simulation settings

We first perform simulation studies to investigate the numerical per—
formance of the proposed method. We randomly generate N = 500
sequences, each with length L,: 100. Then we select P >l< N se—
quences to have change—points. We simulate two scenarios, the first
one without hot points and the second one with hot points. For the
first scenario, we randomly pick one position with equal probability
to be the change—point for all the P >l< N selected sequences. For the
second scenario, we set positions 25, 50 and 75 as hot points with
weight W: 32 while the other points with weight W: 1. one
half of the selected P >l< N sequences have change—points at hot points
and the other half don’t. As a result, we will have (1 — P) >l< N —l— 2>l<
P >l< N = (1 —l— P)N homogeneous sequence segments. For these
homogeneous sequence segments, we generate q,- for each of them
based on a Beta distribution B(oc, ﬂ), which is then used together
with r to generate the number of reads aligned to a position based
on a Negative Binomial distribution NB(r, 61,-).

We set r = 10, or = ﬂ = 4 so that the simulated exons have expres—
sion levels close to real data (Mortazavi et al., 2008). We vary P
from 0.05 to 0.7 (P = 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7) and set
the nominal FDR level at 0.1. The simulation was repeated 100
times for each parameter setting, and we report the averaged FDR
and sensitivity.

For our empirical Bayes models, we also evaluate two settings.
The first one does not consider hot points by setting W: 1 rather
than estimating it. The second one considers hot points by allowing
W to be estimated from data. The method in Wang et al. (2014) es—
sentially scans the whole sequence and selects a position exhibiting
the most dramatic difference as a potential change—point to be deter—
mined by a statistical test. Following their strategy, we implement a
frequentist testing procedure as a competing method to be compared
with our proposed empirical Bayes method. Specifically, this fre-
quentist method scans the whole sequence and finds a position with
the most significant difference as quantified by rank—sum testing
statistic. It is an extreme testing statistic and its original P—value may
not be valid any more. As a result, this frequentist method could not
guarantee multiplicity control. To make comparison, we just rank
exons based on their maximum rank—sum testing statistic and then
claim the same number of significant exons as our models.

3.2 Simulation results

Figure 3 shows the results for the scenario without hot points. We
observe several interesting results. First, our model without con—
sidering hot points (NB model without HP), which is ideal for this
scenario, can control FDR precisely at the nominal level 0.1 for all
settings. Second, our model considering hot points (NB model with
HP) can also control the FDR at nominal level 0.1 for all settings. In
addition, it demonstrates similar sensitivity as the ideal model which
has the information of W: 1. This comparable performance sug—
gests that our model considering hot points, which estimates W
from data, is more general and robust. Third, both of our empirical
Bayes models outperform the frequentist method which demon—
strates a higher FDR while with a lower sensitivity. Fourth, the sen—
sitivity for the detection problem (Q1) is much higher than the
identification problem (Q2), which is expected, as the latter indeed
is more challenging. Figure 4 shows the results for the scenario with
hot points simulated. Again, our empirical Bayes models, consider—
ing hot points or not, both demonstrate significantly better perform—
ance than the frequentist method. Our model considering hot points
is the optimal model. It can precisely control FDR at the nominal

sult, it either could not guarantee FDR control for the detection

points. Therefore, we conclude that our model considering hot
points is robust and superior.

3.3 Integrating junction read information

Splice junction reads are informative for locating 3’/5’ AS events. A
simple strategy by counting splice junction reads support has been
used for calling 3’/5’ AS events (Wang et al., 2009). It is therefore de—
sirable to exploit this junction read information. Meanwhile, it is
noted that additional genes are still being detected even at high read
depths of >1 billion reads (SEQC/MAQC—III Consortium, 2014),
which suggests that many alternative 3’ /5’ AS events may not be cov—
ered by junction reads in most current RNA—seq studies and there is
room for improvement.

We show that integrating both coverage and junction read infor-
mation will bring further improvement over the simple strategy that
utilizes only junction read information. We use similar hot points
simulation settings as in the previous section except that we simulate
only one candidate splicing point (hot point) at the middle. We then
assume 40, 50, 60 and 70% 3’/5’ splicing events are captured by
junction reads (thus the sensitivities achieved by the simple counting
strategy), which are used as hot points in our identification model.
Table 1 shows the sensitivities of our method averaged over 100
runs. We observe a significant improvement brought by our method
in all settings. For example, when junction read coverage is low
(40%), our sensitivities are almost doubled. Even when junction
read coverage is high (70%), our method can still bring more than
10% improvement.

3.4 Real data application

We then apply our proposed method to analyze a real dataset.
Flockhart et al. (2012) conducted whole transcriptome RNA—seq to
study melanoma cell migration. Their RNA—seq datasets have been
deposited to the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) with ID GSE33092. We down—
load their raw reads data from GEO. There are 69 925 376 paired—
end reads in the control sample SRR354040 from primary human
melanocytes infected with RFP lentivirus, and 62 884 955 paired—
end reads in the case sample SRR354042 from primary human mel-
anoma sample (Flockhart et al., 2012). We align the raw reads to
the hg19 reference genome using the popular RNA—seq mapping
tool Tophat (Trapnell et al., 2009) v1.3.1 with default settings.
Exons with short reads found in both samples are used for our ana—
lysis. As a result, 62 209 exons from 13 290 distinct genes remain.

We calculate the number of reads starting from each position in
every exon and bin them every 5 BPs as one point to reduce the ef—
fect of sparsity and noise. In addition, we exploit junction read in-
formation in our model by setting junction read—supported positions
as hot points, whose weights will be estimated from the data.
We apply our model considering hot points on the whole genome.
Table 2 shows the estimated parameters for the two samples. We
can find that the estimated weights of hot points are bigger than 1
(W > 1), which indicates that the positions supported by junction
reads do have higher prior probabilities than other locations. Our
model can capture and make use of this information effectively.

To find biologically meaningful 3’/5’ AS events, we try to detect
the exons that have change—points in one sample but not in the other
sample. We set the FDR level or = 0.05 and detect 7222 such exons.
Figure 5 shows four representative examples of the detected exons
and their estimated change—point positions. For Figure 5 (A) and (B),
we observe clear different short read densities before and after the

change—points in the melanocyte sample (SRR354040) but not in
melanoma sample (SRR354042). In contrast, for Figure 5 (C) and
(D), there are clear changes in the melanoma sample but not in mel—
anocyte sample. Figure 5 (A) shows an example of a detected 5’ AS
event which is also covered by junction reads. Figure 5 (B) demon—
strates that our model can also detect 3’/5’ AS events precisely in the
situation when there are no junction reads covering the splice sites.
In addition, as shown in Figure 5 (C), our model can detect exons
with multiple alternative splice sites. The detected AS events in
Figure 5 (A), (B) and (C) are supported by gene annotations as well,
as the detected change—points are close to the splice sites cataloged
in UCSC Genes database. We present in Figure 5(D) a potential
novel 3’ AS event detected by our model, as it is supported by clear
change in read density in the melanoma sample. This potential AS
event is not covered by junction reads. The new isoform is not found
in RefSeq Genes, UCSC Genes or the AceView database, suggesting
that this may be a novel splice site yet to be cataloged.

As a comparison, we also apply the tool developed by (Wang
et al., 2014) and the simple strategy, which counts only junction
reads, to analyze this dataset. Wei’s tool only detects 3366 exons
with significant changes between the two samples at the same FDR
level, which suggests a lower power compared to our method. For
the simple strategy, we call a 3’/5’ AS event if it is supported by one
or more junction reads. This strategy detects 796 exons that contain
3’/5’ AS events in one sample but not in the other sample. This im-
proved sensitivity of our method over the simple strategy shows that
utilizing junction reads together with read coverage information
could obtain a better performance than using junction reads only.

We compare these detected AS events with the isoforms cata—
loged in the AceView database. When the algorithm detects an AS
event and there is one in the matching AceView exon as well, we de—
fine this detected AS event as supported by AceView. It is noted that
this is not an experimental validation but serves as a proxy to the
‘truth’. As summarized in Table 3, 5234 out of the 7222 AS events
our method finds are supported by AceView and 1988 AS events are
novel, while for Wei’s method, 2308 out of the 3366 AS events are
supported and 1058 AS events are novel, and for the simple strategy,
772 AS events are supported and 24 AS events are novel. In contrast,
for the whole genome, 64.7% exons contain AS events annotated in
the AceView database. Here, our model only uses the junction reads

ation purpose. The exons reported by our method have a statistically
higher supporting rate of 72.5% (P—value: 0).

Finally, following Wang et al. (2014), we also conduct the gene
set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of the genes with 3’/5’ AS events re—
ported by our model in order to evaluate the results from a systems
biology point of view. We use the canonical pathways definitions
(Version 4) downloaded from the Molecular Signatures Database
(http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp). We identify
12 significantly enriched pathways as shown in Table 4 at an FDR
level of 0.05. Interestingly, many of them are relevant to melanoma
or cancer. For example, recent studies demonstrate that activation

of the Smad2/3 pathway has inhibitory effects on tumor cell plasti—
city of melanoma (Pardali et al., 201 1). Regulation of the actin cyto—
skeleton contributes to cancer cell migration and invasion
(Yamaguchi and Condeelis, 2007). The Notch signaling pathway
plays a key role in melanoma growth and progression (Bedogni,
2014). The meaningful GSEA results from a systems biology point
of view provide supplementary support to the accuracy of our re—
sults. They may provide insight into the role of 3’/5’ AS in these
pathways.

4 Conclusion and discussion

We propose an empirical Bayes change—point model to identify 3’ /5’
AS events. Simulation studies and real data application have demon—
strated that our method is powerful, accurate and efficient for ana-
lyzing the next-generation RNA sequencing data. Compared with
previous methods, our approach does not rely on annotation infor-
mation. Instead, it provides for the first time a systematic framework
to characterize coverage change while being capable of integrating
other information, in particular the junction read information which
is very helpful for detecting 3’ /5’ AS events.

We utilize an empirical Bayes model to efficiently pool informa-
tion across genes. Our Negative Binomial—Beta model, which allows
the over—dispersion in the real data, could estimate the hyperpara—
meters from data efficiently. This makes our model more powerful
compared with frequentist methods, as our model applies Bayesian
inference (Zhao et al., 2013). Since the hyperparameters are esti—
mated frequentistically from data, it also overcomes the defects of
subjective priors of Bayesian methods.

We provide a ﬂexible testing framework in which the user can
choose to address different levels of questions, namely, whether al-
ternative splicing happens, and/or where it happens. This gives users
more flexibility in solving real problems. When exact splice sites are
hard to determine, we could choose to only report the exons that

contain alternative splicing. In addition, a Bayesian confidence inter—
val for the splicing point can be constructed based on the posterior
probabilities calculated by our method if it is of the user’s particular
interest.

Recent studies have revealed that RNA—seq data sampled from the
transcriptome exhibit various biases, including position—specific and
sequence—specific biases (Huang et al., 2013). These biases may incur
great difficulties in detecting 3’/5’ AS events and cause false positive
reports. When applying our model, the user may circumvent this
problem by using additional control samples and doing further filter-
ing. For example, an XOR filtering, (pfasc > 0) XOR (p,gontrOI > 0),
or an even sophisticated filtering |pfasc — pfontr°1| > a threshold,
may be applied.

Our testing and decision procedures allow the user to solve either
the detection problem (having or not a change—point) or the identifi-
cation problem (locating the change—point), but not both simultan—
eously. The identification problem is more informative as it provides
location estimation, but it is also more challenging leading to a
lower sensitivity. The detection problem is the converse. To take ad—
vantage of both, an idea is to do identification when signal is strong
enough and do detection when signal is weak. We are working on
this extension within a multiple testing framework and have ob—
tained some promising theoretical results (Sun and Wei, 2015).

It is hard to precisely evaluate the accuracy of the real data ana—
lysis results without experimental validation. We use the number of
exons detected vs. the number of exons with AceView ‘Support’ as
an implicit indication of the validity of the results. We also conduct
GSEA and use the meaningful enriched pathway results as supple—
mentary support to the accuracy of the results. It is noted that both
of them are not an experimental validation. We believe that as our
tool becomes popular among biologists, a rigorous accuracy valid—
ation will be possible and available in the near future.

We assume either one or no alternative 3’/5’ splice sites, repre—
sented as the alternative model (M1) and the null model (M0),
respectively. It is noted that there can be more than one alternative
3’/5’ splice site. In principle, we may extend our model to search for
more change—points. To do so, we can replace M1 (Equation 5) with
a more general product partition model MK allowing 3 K change-
points (Barry and Hartigan, 1992). Given multiple change—points,
M1 will fit less well but still better than M0 assuming no change—
points. The null hypothesis (no change—points) we test remains the
same. Thus, our testing procedures would remain valid, though not
optimal, under some circumstances. Our method may not always be
optimal when the signal is subtle. However, we do not expect many
such instances. Moreover, if they are interested, the users may
manually inspect further those identified genes to see whether there
is more than one change—point and where they are. In addition, seek—
ing the optimal model for multiple change—points would impose
great computational cost. Computational time is linear to scan for
one possible change—point, and becomes factorial when considering
multiple change—points. There is also a caveat of over fitting to con—
sider. Because of these implications, the potential gain may not ne-
cessarily warrant seeking a perfect model. We would leave this
extension for multiple change—points to future work.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Alternative Splicing Effects ASsessment Tools (AS-EAST)
is an online tool for the functional annotation of putative proteins
encoded by transcripts generated by alternative splicing (AS). When
provided with a transcript sequence, AS-EAST identifies regions
altered by AS events in the putative protein sequence encoded by the
transcript. Users can evaluate the predicted function of the putative
protein by inspecting whether functional domains are included in the
altered regions. Moreover, users can infer the loss of inter-molecular
interactions in the protein network according to whether the AS
events affect interaction residues observed in the 3D structure of
the reference isoform. The information obtained from AS-EAST will
help to design experimental analyses for the functional significance
of novel splice isoforms.

1 INTRODUCTION

In higher eukaryotes, genes often produce alternatively spliced
transcripts (AS transcripts). Many AS events have been actively
detected with high—throughput experimental methods, such as
RNA—Seq and microarrays (Hallegger et al., 2010). However, the
functions of putative proteins encoded by AS transcripts (termed
‘AS isoforms’) have not been experimentally analyzed in many
cases. Functional annotation tools for transcripts with novel patterns
of splicing are desirable to infer the functional signiﬁcance of AS
isoforms. There are few tools for analyzing AS isoforms translated
from novel transcripts queried by users. AltAnalyze (http://www.
altanalyze.org) identiﬁes AS events using RNA—Seq or microarray
data and shows how these events may affect domain composition.
However, it does not provide information on the effects of AS on
the 3D structures of AS isoforms. MAISTAS (Floris et al., 2011)
assesses whether user—queried AS isoforms are structurally plausible
proteins, but explicit functional annotations are not provided.
Previously, we developed a pipeline that detects regions altered
by AS events (termed ‘AS regions’) in AS isoforms using genome
sequences and full—length transcript data (Yura et al., 2006).
The pipeline then evaluates the impact of AS events on the

interactions between the AS isoforms and other molecules by
identifying interaction residues from 3D structure data of relevant
molecular complexes. All of the data derived from the pipeline
are provided in the AS—ALPS database (Shionyu et al., 2009).
In this article, we describe AS—EAST that annotates and analyzes
user—uploaded transcript sequences using AS—ALPS. AS—EAST
determines whether the transcript encodes a novel AS isoform
and annotates such functional sites in the AS isoform as residues
interacting with other molecules. We provide an example: AS—EAST
predicts that a novel AS isoform of mitogen—activated protein kinase
1 (MAPKl) in human skeletal muscle inhibits the signaling pathway
by removing residues that interact with ATP and substrate proteins.

2 OVERVIEW OF AS-EAST
2.1 Input data

To detect and annotate AS events in a user—submitted transcript
(termed ‘query transcript’), AS—EAST accepts a FASTA—formatted
transcript sequence. A novel pattern of splicing detected with RNA—
Seq or exon junction microarray often determines whether a certain
exon in a known transcript model is skipped. AS—EAST has a user
interface for generating an exon—skipped transcript sequence from
the known transcript sequences stored in AS—ALPS. For example,
RNA—Seq data (Wang et al., 2008) shows that the fourth exon of
the MAPKl transcript tends to be skipped in human skeletal muscle
(Fig. 1a). This splicing pattern is novel because no fourth exon—
skipped transcript is found in RefSeq or Ensembl transcript datasets
stored in AS—ALPS. Users can build a fourth exon—skipped transcript
sequence by checking the checkbox of ‘exon 4’ and selecting the
‘Generate’ button. Then, the transcript sequence excluding the fourth
exon is shown in FASTA format.

2.2 AS region detection

First, a genome contig sequence aligned to the query transcript
sequence with the largest value of both length coverage and sequence
identity is selected using MEGABLAST (Altschul et al., 1997).
An alignment of the query transcript and the contig sequence
is performed using SPLIGN (Kapustin et al., 2008). AS—EAST
searches the AS—ALPS database for transcripts mapped on the
same region of the contig as the query transcript. The user can
select one of the transcripts as a reference transcript. Second, the
protein—coding sequence (CDS) of the query transcript is predicted
by identifying the longest open reading frame (ORF) or FrameDP
program (Gouzy et al., 2009). Users can also use the ORF starting

Fig. 1. (a) User interface for generating query transcript data. As a reference
of exon— skipped transcript sequence generation, the mapping results of RNA—
Seq data from Wang et al. (2008) are shown at the top of the schematic
ﬁgure in the human dataset. Mapping of the RNA—Seq data was performed
using the TopHat program (Trapnell et al., 2009) with default parameters.
(b) Interaction residues obtained from 3D structure information assigned to
a reference isoform. The deletion—type AS region is shown in red. Interaction
residues are denoted with arrowheads in the schematic View and stick models
in the 3D structure View. The ligand is shown in a space—ﬁlling model. The
3D structure is shown with Jmol (http://www.jmol.org/)

with the users’ chosen ﬁrst codon as the CDS. By comparing the
genomic regions corresponding to the CDSs of a reference transcript
and the query transcript, AS—EAST identiﬁes CDSs changed through
AS (termed ‘AS CDSs’). The AS CDSs of a reference transcript that
have no corresponding region in the query transcript are classiﬁed
as deletions, and the AS CDSs of the query transcript that have
no corresponding region in a reference transcript are classiﬁed as
insertions.

From the AS CDSs, AS—EAST identiﬁes amino acid sequence
regions changed through AS, termed ‘AS regions’. An amino acid
sequence encoded by a deletion AS CDS whose length is a multiple
of 3 is identiﬁed as a deletion—type AS region. In addition, an amino
acid sequence encoded by an insertion AS CDS whose length is
a multiple of 3 is identiﬁed as an insertion—type AS region. When
the length of an AS CDS is not a multiple of 3 and the reading
frame of the 3’ —ﬂanking CDS is shifted, the amino acid sequence
encoded by the AS CDS and the 3’ —ﬂanking CDS is identiﬁed as a
substitution—type AS region.

2.3 Functional annotation

To analyze the functional effect of AS on a putative protein encoded
by the query transcript (query isoform), annotations of the query
isoform with functional regions are performed using InterProScan
(Zdobnov and preiler, 2001). From the results of InterProScan,
functional domains from the Pfam, Gene3D and SUPERFAMILY
databases and transmembrane regions predicted with TMHMM
are shown in AS—EAST. Moreover, AS—EAST annotates the query
isoform using functional amino acid residue information (Fig. 1b).
Amino acid residues interacting with other molecules (interaction
residues) are identiﬁed from the 3D structure data of protein
complexes (Yura et al., 2006). AS—EAST assigns 3D structures to
the query isoform with BLASTP (Altschul et al., 1997). AS—EAST
determines whether 3D structures are assigned to AS regions on
the basis of the criteria by Yura et al. (2006). According to the
alignment of the sequences of the reference isoform and the assigned
3D structures, interaction residues are projected to the corresponding
residues in the AS regions. In the MAPK1 example, the query
isoform has a protein kinase domain, according to the results of
InterProScan. However, the query isoform lacks a region that has
some residues constituting the ATP—binding pocket and interaction
residues and is predicted to lose protein kinase activity. Therefore,
the expression of the AS isoform encoded by the fourth exon— skipped
transcript in human skeletal muscle might inhibit the MAP kinase
signaling pathway and regulate cell proliferation/differentiation as
a result.

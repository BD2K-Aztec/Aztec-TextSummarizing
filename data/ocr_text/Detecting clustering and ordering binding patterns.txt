ABSTRACT

Motivation: Recent development in ChlP-Seq technology has gener-
ated binding data for many transcription factors (T Fs) in various cell
types and cellular conditions. This opens great opportunities for study-
ing combinatorial binding patterns among a set of TFs active in a
particular cellular condition, which is a key component for understand-
ing the interaction between TFs in gene regulation.

Results: As a first step to the identification of combinatorial binding
patterns, we develop statistical methods to detect clustering and
ordering patterns among binding sites (883) of a pair of TFs. Testing
procedures based on Ripley’s K-function and its generalizations are
developed to identify binding patterns from large collections of 883 in
ChlP-Seq data. We have applied our methods to the ChlP-Seq data of
91 pairs of TFs in mouse embryonic stem cells. Our methods have
detected clustering binding patterns between most TF pairs, which is
consistent with the findings in the literature, and have identified sig-
nificant ordering preferences, relative to the direction of target gene
transcription, among the 883 of seven TFs. More interestingly, our
results demonstrate that the identified clustering and ordering binding
patterns between TFs are associated with the expression of the target
genes. These findings provide new insights into co-regulation between
TFs.

1 INTRODUCTION

Gene expression in high organisms is regulated by the combina-
torial binding of multiple transcription factors (TFs) to the DNA
sequence in upstream or other regulatory regions of the gene. A
set of interactive TFs often shows complex binding patterns.
Clusters of multiple TF binding sites (TFBSs) co-localized in a
short DNA region form the so-called cis—regulatory modules
(CRMs). More complicated patterns, such as ordering preference
among binding sites (BSs) of different TFs in a regulatory region,
may exist and encode hidden regulatory signals. Detecting com-
binatorial binding patterns and CRMs is thus an important step
toward a comprehensive understanding of cis—regulation.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Consequently, computational methods have been developed for
this purpose based on different types of genomic data.

Early methods build probabilistic models for TFBSs and their
occurrences in CRMs to identify clusters of TFBSs from DNA
sequence data. For a recent review of these methods, see
Hardison and Taylor (2012). When the TFs involved in a
particular cellular condition are known, methods have been
developed to detect clusters of motif matches appearing more
frequently than expected given a background model for the
DNA sequence (Berman et al., 2002; Frith et al., 2002; Halfon
et al., 2002; Markstein et al., 2002; Rebeiz et al., 2002). There are
also de novo methods for the discovery of CRMs, such as Gupta
and Liu (2005); Zhou and Wong (2004, 2007) for a few examples.
Essentially, this group of methods finds clusters of TFBSs based
on the enrichment of motif matches compared against a simple
background model. Because motif signals are usually weak in
high organisms, sophisticated binding patterns, such as the
ordering and other location preferences among TFBSs, cannot
be reliably detected from sequence data alone and thus are often
not incorporated in these methods.

Recently, ChIP-Seq technology has been applied to generate
genome-wide binding data for TFs in various cellular conditions.
The accumulation of such binding data for multiple TFs in the
same condition makes it possible to explore the relation among
the binding of these TFs. For example, more than 10 TFs have
available ChIP-Seq data in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs)
(Chen et al., 2008; Heng et al., 2010; Marson et al., 2008). One
may want to find out whether the binding of two TFs is inde-
pendent of each other and, if not, identify speciﬁc binding pat-
terns suggested by the data. Such results may indicate how two
or more TFs work together to regulate the expression of target
genes and help detect novel regulatory signals. However, those
motif-enrichment methods reviewed above are not directly ap-
plicable owing to the different data type and their simplified
model assumptions. On the other hand, ad hoc methods have
been used to define and detect clusters of BSs or ChIP-Seq
peaks in recent studies. Chen et al. (2008) defined multiple TF
binding loci by peaks within 100 bp. Lee and Zhou (2013) iden-
tified context-dependent co-regulators from co-bound regions
constructed by ChIP-Seq peaks of two TFs with distance
<50 bp. Ji et al. (2006) determined whether binding regions
have a clustering tendency based on the empirical distribution
of peak-to-peak distances. Orlov et al. (2009) found clusters of
BSs by iteratively merging peaks within 100 bp and then con-
structed some test using Poisson approximation. Kazemian
et al. (2013) identiﬁed inter-site spacing bias for some fixed
range between 0 and 100 bp by a Fisher’s exact test on the

contingency table of site pair counts within or outside the range.
One sees an arbitrary use of distance thresholds and simple em-
pirical tests in ﬁnding clusters of BSs (or peaks) in existing work,
without any consideration of ordering preference among TFBSs
or the individual location distribution for BSs of a TF. Clearly,
there is a pressing need for new statistical methods to infer com-
binatorial binding patterns from ChIP-Seq data.

In this work, we develop statistical methods to detect cluster-
ing and ordering patterns between BSs of two TFs from their
ChIP-Seq data. We assume that under the null model the loca-
tions of BSs of a TF follow an inhomogeneous Poisson point
process. Test statistics for clustering and ordering binding pat-
terns are constructed based on Ripley’s K-function (Dixon, 2002;
Ripley, 1976), a widely used method for detecting point patterns
in spatial statistics, and its generalizations to pairwise TF binding
data. Our approach does not rely on a pre—speciﬁed distance
threshold for the detection of clusters of BSs and can automat-
ically ﬁnd the distance level at which the clustering pattern, if
exists, is most signiﬁcant. We make use of the large number of
BSs in ChIP-Seq data and demonstrate that the null distributions
of the test statistics can be accurately approximated by large-
sample theory. This eliminates the need for computationally in-
tensive simulations and allows for efﬁcient large-scale analysis.

2 METHODS

Our methods are designed for the discovery of binding patterns from
ChIP-Seq data of two TFs, X and Y. In this work, we focus on the
upstream (—8K, 2K] region, relative to the transcription start site
(TSS), of a gene, which is arguably the region that contains most cis-
regulatory signals. We collect all upstream regions that contain at least
one ChIP-Seq peak from each of the two TFs, as our goal is to infer the
relation between the binding of them. The corresponding genes of these
upstream regions are called the (common) target genes of the two TFs.
To simplify notation, we regard the location at —8Kbp as the origin and
choose the direction of gene transcription as the positive direction, so that
an upstream region has coordinates (0, L] (L = 10K). This data collection
procedure gives a meaningful deﬁnition of the ordering among BSs, rela-
tive to the direction of gene transcription. Suppose that x and y are the
coordinates of two BSs (x, y e (0, L]). We say x precedes y if x<y. For
the sake of understanding, we ﬁrst describe our models and methods
assuming that the exact locations of BSs are given, and then discuss a
computational approach that predicts the exact location of a BS from a
ChIP-Seq peak.

The input dataset for a pair of TFs X and Y consists of N upstream
regions, R1, ...,RN, and a set of BS locations on each region. For
r=l,...,N, let x,=(xr,,,i=l, ...,n,) and y,=(yr,j,j=l, ...,mr) be
the BS locations for X and Y in the region Rr, respectively. Because we
assume the same model for each region, the index r may be suppressed
when we describe the methods for a generic region.

2.1 Inhomogeneous Poisson processes

Under the null model, BS locations of a TF are modeled by an inhomo-
geneous Poisson point process independent of the binding of other TFs.
A Poisson point process on the line is a model for the occurrence of
points in a one-dimensional interval. Denote the interval of interest by
(0, L], which represents an upstream region in this work. A Poisson point
process can be equivalently speciﬁed by a counting process for the
number of points that have occurred in any subinterval (a, b], denoted
by N(a, b]. For an inhomogeneous Poisson process with intensity func-
tion Mx), x e (0, L], the count N(a, [7] follows a Poisson distribution with

[7
rate kg], = / A(x)dx, i.e.
a

A. Z
P{N(a,b]=z}=@e-M,z=0,1,2,.... (1)
z.
In addition, N(a1, b1] and N(a2, 172] are independent if the two subinter-
vals do not overlap. Given the total number of points N(0, L]=n, the
points (their locations) can be regarded as i.i.d. with density function
M96)
f(x) = T (2)
0L
for x e (0, L]. This important property of an inhomogeneous Poisson
process is most relevant to this study. So far we have been assuming
that a region of interest is a continuous interval, but the upstream regions
are composed of discrete base pairs. This technical difﬁculty can be
resolved by assuming that the intensity function 2(x) is piecewise con-
stant: for X1,X2 e (k,k+l], where k is an integer, we always have
2(x1) =A(xz). Under this assumption,

b b
/ A(x)dx= Z Mk) (3)

k=a+l

for two integers a<b.

The Poisson point process is a reasonable model for BS locations of a
TF. First, when the considered region is large, such as L: 10K in our
case, observing a BS in a small interval (x — A, x] is a rare event with
probability oc A(x)A and it is independent of the occurrence of BSs in
other non-overlapping intervals. Second, the inhomogeneity allows us to
capture the common observation that BSs tend to occur more frequently
in regions closer to the TSS. Therefore, we expect Mx) to have peaks
when x is close to the TSS.

We make a key assumption that the conditional density f(x) in (2) for a
particular TF is identical across all regions. Denote by fX(x) the density
for TF X. By Equation (2), the intensity function of TF X for the rth
reg1on

x5?(x)=x§20LfX(x), (4)

L
where AQOL = / Ag?)(x)dx. Note that the expected number of BSs of TF

X in the region R, is AQOL. Thus, our null model accounts for the fact that
each upstream region may have a different number of observed BSs, but
assumes that the location distribution of the BSs is identical with a
common density fX(x), which can be reliably estimated with enough re-
gions. The intensity function of TF Y is deﬁned in the same way as (4).

From Equation (1) with a = 0 and b = L, one sees that AQOL can simply

be estimated by n, and 232% by m, for r = l, ... , N. To estimatefX ande
from BS locations (x,, y,), we further assume that the densities are piece-
wise constant where the length of a piece is 11 bp. Denote the pieces by B,-
for i=1, . . . , L/h. Thean(x) for x e B, is estimated by

2.2 Clustering detection

Ripley’s K-function (Dixon, 2002; Ripley, 1976) is a broadly used analysis
tool for summarizing and detecting point patterns in spatial data. In this

Detecting clustering and ordering binding patterns

 

section, we develop a method based on a bivariate K-function for detect-
ing clustering binding patterns between two TFs.

For two point processes, the bivariate K-function is the expected
number of pairs of points, one from each process, with distance 5 1,
normalized by the product of the intensities of the two processes
(Baddeley et al., 2000). Consider a generic upstream region with BS
locations x=(x1,...,xn) for TF X and y=(yl, ...,ym) for TF Y. An
estimated K-function for this region is

A _ 1 " m w(x.-,yj)—11(dx,,y, : z)

1mm  mximoj) ’ (7)
where I(-) is the indicator function, w(x,, yj) is a weight function for edge
correction and dxm = Ix,- — 32]] is the distance between x,- and y]. Ignoring
the edge correction at this moment, if there are many pairs of points
within distance 1 relative to the intensities, XXI/(1) will be greater than
its expected value under the assumption that the binding of the two TFs is
independent of each other. Reversely, if the BSs of the two TFs are mu-
tually repulsive, one would expect fewer pairs having distance 5 1 and
thus a small XXI/(1). By varying the distance 1 over a wide range, we will
obtain a curve of the bivariate K-function to summarize the clustering/
repulsive pattern for all distance levels. This is the overall idea behind our
method.

There are a few technical issues about the estimated K-function (7).
First, edge effects may arise. There may be points lying outside the study
area, (0, L], even though they are within the distance 1 from a point
located in the study area. Thus, to avoid bias in estimating the K—func-
tion, an appropriate edge correction should be applied to data points
close to the boundaries of the region. Several weight functions have
been suggested for edge correction (Y amada and Rogerson, 2003), and
Ripley’s method (Ripley, 1976) is used in this work. In a plane, w(x,~, yj) is
deﬁned as the fraction of the circumference of a circle centered at x,- with
radius dxm that lies inside the study area. In the one-dimensional case
where x,- and yj are located on the line, the weight function reduces to

1 if[-xi _ dxiJ/ja xi + dxid’j] g (0? 
W06, 30') Z { (8)

l / 2 otherwise.

Second, since the intensities AX and 2y are unknown, they are estimated
by an and me according to Equation (6).

To detect a potential clustering pattern, we calculate the K-function for
each region, 13):},(1), given the BS locations x and y,. To evaluate its
signiﬁcance, the expectation and variance of [Adi/(1) are calculated under
the null hypothesis He that BSs of the two TFs are independently dis-
tributed according to inhomogeneous Poisson point processes. For any
distance 1 e (0, L], conditional on the numbers of BSs, n, and my,

[E[1€§?Y(z) | n,, m,, 71,] = 2:, (9)

Var [Egg/(1) | my, my, He]

[0r(t)]2,

where V(1), C X and CY can be calculated by numerical summation. See
Supplementary Document for the detailed derivation. Note that V(1), C X
and CY do not depend on r and thus are identical across different up-
stream regions, which makes the variance calculation efﬁcient even for a
large number of regions.

If the two TFs tend to bind in a cluster of distance 1, observed value of
13):},(1) will be substantially greater than its expected value 21 for many
regions. Conversely, if it is substantially smaller than 21, we may conclude
that the two TFs have a signiﬁcant repulsive binding pattern. Because we
are interested in such overall binding patterns, it is natural to construct a

test statistic that combines the K-functions from all regions. To this end, a
normalized Z—score of the K-functions is deﬁned by

N "(V)

Z1(X,,(z)— 21, (11)

where each term in the summation has zero mean and unit variance under
H6. Thus, Z6 is the sum of independent random variables with identical
means and variances (although their distributions may differ). By
Lindberg’s central limit theorem, which only requires independence
among random variables,

ZC(1) | HC~N(0,1), asN—> oo. (12)

This leads to a simple null distribution for our test statistic when N is
large. The accuracy of this asymptotic approximation will be evaluated
for the data in this work by simulation. So far, we have been focusing on
the procedure for a given 1. In practice, we consider a range of values of
IE (0, 5000]. This range is expected to be wide enough to capture all
interesting clustering distances.

The testing procedure for detecting clustering patterns is summarized
as follows.

(1) Estimate by Equations (5) and (6) the intensity functions of the two
TFs, A900 and 2902), for all r.

(2) For each value of 1:

(a) Calculate the V(1), CX and Cy in (10).
(b) Calculate [gig/(1) and o,(1) for r= l, ...,N.

(c) Calculate ZC(1) and its P—Value by normal approximation.

Our method also reports the most signiﬁcant clustering distance 1* that
maximizes ZC(1), i.e. 1* =argmaleC(1).

2.3 Ordering detection

For a pair of TFs with signiﬁcant clustering binding for some distance
level, we further test whether their binding also has an ordering preference
relative to the direction of target gene transcription. For a generic up-
stream region, let X=(X1, ...,Xn) and Y=(Y1, , Ym) be two random
vectors that represent the respective locations of the BSs of the two TFs,
X and Y, showing the most signiﬁcant clustering pattern at distance 1*.
Our ordering detection method is based on modeling the conditional
distribution of Y,- given X. We assume that Y,- is generated independently
given one and only one X]- from a conditional distribution,
P(Y,-=y|XJ-=x), for y=x — 1*, ...,x+1*, and call X]- the parent of Y,-.
As )2 ranges between x — 1* and x+1*, we are only considering those Y,-
such that |Y,- — X1] 5 1* for some j. This makes the ordering analysis
meaningful and well-deﬁned. Hereafter, n and m, or n, and m, for the
rth region, refer to the numbers of BSs satisfying this distance constraint.
Because there may be more than one X]- whose distance to a particular Y,-
is 5 1*, we introduce hidden variables Z; to indicate which X]- is the
parent of Y,-, i.e.

1 if XJ-is the parent of Y,-,
I)": . (13)
0 otherw1se.
We parametrize this model by 6: (64., . . . , 6,*) with
6d=P(Y,-=x+d|Zy=l,/Xﬂ=x)f0rd=—1*,...,1*, 

subject to the constraints that 2 6d: 1 and 6d 2 0. With this param-
eterization, the null hypothesis that the binding of the two TFs has no
ordering preference is expressed as

H0 : ZQdZZQd- (15)

d<0 d>0

That is, Y,- has an equal chance to be located to the left or to the right of
its parent. Moreover, we assume that in priori every X]- has an equal
likelihood to be the parent of Y,-.

Because the model is essentially a mixture model with hidden variables
(Zij), an EM algorithm is developed to estimate 6 under H0
(Supplementary Document). Denote by 6 the estimate of 6 output from
the EM algorithm. Before we use this estimate for detecting ordering
patterns, we apply some simple method to smooth 6d over d, as many
spikes often exist in 6 because of having no or few observations for some
distances d.

Let x = (x1, . . . , X") and y = (yl, . . . ,ym) be the observed binding loca-
tions of the two TFs on a generic upstream region R. We propose a new
statistic XYIX(1*) for ordering detection,

A * _ 1 m C(yi,X)

where

and fy] X(y|x) denotes the conditional probability of Y,- = )2 given x for any
i (as they are i.i.d. given x). Under our model assumptions,

fylx(le)=% Z 6w), (18)

jethy)

where JX(y) = {i2 lxj —y| S 1*}. Under the null hypothesis H0, the ex-
pectation and variance of K YI X(1*) for a region R,, r= 1, . . . , N, are

where A(x,)=  UN- and U,,j=[xr,j — 1*, xr,j+1*] ﬂ (0, L] for
j = 1, . . . , nr. SeeJSlllpplementary Document for the derivation of these

results.

We did not include edge correction in the deﬁnition (16) of X12] X(1*).
This is because the distance 1* for most clustering pairs is much smaller
than L, the length of the upstream regions. For the signiﬁcant ordering
pairs we detected in this work, the percentage of BSs located within 1* bp
to either boundary of the upstream regions is around or <1%. Thus, the
edge effect is largely ignorable for the ordering detection method.

Finally, by the same argument as in the clustering analysis, a normal-
ized Z—score is used as the test statistic for ordering detection,

"(V)
N KY]X(I*)

* _ l

(21)

which approximately follows the standard normal distribution N(0, 1)
under H0 when N is large. From the deﬁnition of c(y,-, x) in Equation
(17), Z0(1*)> 0 implies that X binding precedes Y.

Now we summarize the testing procedure for ordering detection.

(1) Estimate 6 = (6_,*, ...,6,*) from all regions using the EM algo-
rithm and smooth 6.

(2) For r= 1, . . . , N, calculate X$]X(1*) and t,(1*), where 6 is plugged
into Equation (18) to estimate the mixture density anozlxr).

(3) Calculate Z0(1*) and its P—Value by normal approximation.

Obviously, one may switch the roles of X and Y in this procedure,
modeling the conditional distribution of X given Y. In practice, we cal-
culate two P-Values using the above procedure, one from 13le and the
other from XXI y, and then take the geometric average of the two P—Values
as the combined evidence for ordering patterns.

2.4 Predicting BS locations

A ChIP-Seq peak for a TF is recorded as an interval in which a TFBS is
supposed to locate. We need to pinpoint the exact BS locations from
ChIP-Seq data before applying our methods for clustering and ordering
detection. To do this, we ﬁrst extract the DNA sequence for a ChIP-Seq
peak using the software CisGenome (Ii 61 al., 2008). Then, we scan the
sequence, as well as its reverse compliment, with a sliding window of
length w, where w is the length of the position-speciﬁc weight matrix
(PWM) of the TF from the database TRANSFAC (Matys et al.,
2003). We score a w—mer in the DNA sequence by a likelihood ratio,

.2 
I 1301190),

 

(22)

where s,- is the nucleotide sequence of the 1th w-mer, ® is the PWM for this
TF and 60 is a background Markov model. The w-mer that has the
maximum score among all w-mers scanned from the sequence is chosen
as the exact BS, whose location (start position) is used in our analysis.

3 RESULTS

In this work, we study binding patterns in ChIP-Seq data gener-
ated from mouse ESCs. ESCs are pluripotent stem cells derived
from the inner cell mass of the blastocyst, an early-stage embryo
(Thomson et al., 1998). They are known to have two distinctive
properties, pluripotency and the ability to replicate indeﬁnitely
(Pan and Thomson, 2007), which make ESCs especially import-
ant in clinical research. It is expected that many complex diseases
might be treated by transplanting cells generated from ESCs
(Odorico et al., 2001).

There has been a substantial amount of recent work on the
gene regulatory network in mouse ESCs, which involves the
combinatorial regulation by a number of TFs (Chen et al.,
2008; Ivanova et al., 2006; Kim et al., 2008; Zhou et al., 2007).
For example, Oct4 is known as a master regulator of pluripo-
tency, and a valid amount of Oct4 is needed for dedifferentiation
and for sustaining ESC self-renewal (Pan e1al., 2002). Four TFs,
Oct4, Sox2, cMyc and Klf4, can reprogram somatic cells back to
ESC-like cells having the characteristics of self-renewal and plur-
ipotency (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006). Genome-wide ChIP-
Seq data have provided the binding regions of >10 TFs that play
key regulatory roles in mouse ESCs (Chen et al., 2008; Heng
et al., 2010; Marson et al., 2008). Computational analyses have
been performed to identify the sequence motifs of these core TFs
(Bailey, 2011; Mason et al., 2010; Thomas-Chollier et al., 2012)
and to detect other co-regulators that may regulate genes by
working with these TFs (Chen and Zhou, 2011; He et al.,
2009; Lee and Zhou, 2013). However, except for some ad hoc
analysis on the co-occurrence between binding peaks, it appears
that no principled approaches have been applied to detect com-
binatorial binding patterns from this rich collection of data. In
this analysis, we apply our methods to 14 TFs with available
ChIP-Seq data from three recent publications (Chen et al.,

2008; Heng et al., 2010; Marson et al., 2008) and systematically
identify clustering and ordering binding patterns between all 91
TF pairs. The 14 TFs are Oct4, Sox2, Smadl, Stat3, Nanog,
Esrrb, chcp2ll, ch3, Nr5a2, E2fl, nMyc, cMyc, fo and
Klf4. We also suggest potential regulatory roles of the identiﬁed
combinatorial binding patterns by examining the expression pro-
ﬁles and functional annotations of their target genes.

We ﬁrst veriﬁed Via a simulation study that the normal ap-
proximations to the null distributions of the test statistics, Z6 (1 l)
and Z0 (21), are accurate for the data analyzed in this work. One
key feature that distinguishes our methods from other ad hoc
methods is the use of inhomogeneous Poisson processes in mod-
eling BS locations, which takes into account the location prefer-
ence of TFBSs in upstream regions. In the simulation study, we
also compared our approach against a simple method that ig-
nores the location preference in detecting clustering. The simple
method produced substantially more false discoveries. This
shows that modeling the marginal binding distribution of a TF
is a critical component for the detection of signiﬁcant binding
patterns. See Supplementary Document for a detailed description
of the simulation study.

3.1 General clustering patterns

In this section, we analyze the potential clustering patterns of the
91 TF pairs. Because Oct4 and Sox2 are the most well-known
and important master regulators in ESCs, we illustrate the details
in each step of our analysis with this pair of TFs.

The analysis starts with estimating the density function f X for
each TF. To construct a robust estimate, we chose the bin size n
so that every bin has at least one BS in at least one region. Then,
we estimated the density function fX by (5) and the intensity
function Ag)(x) by (6) for each region. As expected, both TFs
tend to bind more frequently near the TSS of a gene
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Such marginal location preferences
are captured by the estimated densities. As demonstrated by
our simulation study, ignoring this fact would lead to false posi-
tives in clustering detection.

With the estimated intensity functions for a pair of TFs, the
bivariate K-function (7) for each upstream region and the
Z—score (11) were calculated for a sequence of distances. See
Figure 1(A) for the K-function of Oct4 and Sox2, averaged
over upstream regions bound by the two TFs, which lies far
above the expected value 21. This suggests that the two TFs
have a signiﬁcant clustering pattern for all distances, which is
conﬁrmed by the large positive values of Zc(1) in Figure 1B. The
maximal Zc value, 66.9, occurs at the distance 1* = 50, and thus
the clustering between Oct4 and Sox2 binding is found most
signiﬁcant when examining the BSs from the two TFs located
within 50 bp. The monotone decreasing trend of Zc(1) as 1 in-
creases (Fig. lB) shows that the clustering pattern becomes less
signiﬁcant as the distance threshold increases. This result is
clearly consistent with the known tight clustering between the
BSs of Oct4 and Sox2. In fact, in some regions, the two TFs
bind adjacent sites with only a few (or even no) gaps (Chen et al.,
2008; Mason et al., 2010).

To summarize the results of all 91 TF pairs, we consider the
average of Zc(1) over 1 e [50, 1000], denoted by 71000, for
P—Value and false discovery rate (FDR) calculations. First,

using 71000 is more conserved than using the maximal Z—score
Zc(1*) because the latter will cause a selection bias and artiﬁcially
increase the signiﬁcance level. Second, for most applications in
deﬁning clusters of BSs or CRMs, the maximal distance thresh-
old is often a few hundred base pairs. Given 71000 we calculated
the P—Value from N(0, l) and the corresponding FDR for all T F
pairs. It turns out that 86 out of the 91 pairs were found to have
signiﬁcant clustering patterns with an FDR <2%
(Supplementary Table S1). This is in line with the ﬁnding that
most of these TFs show extensive co-binding in mouse ESCs
(Chen et al., 2008; Marson et al., 2008). The statistics 71000 of
all the TF pairs are shown as a heatmap in Figure 2. For almost
all signiﬁcant pairs, the most signiﬁcant clustering distance 1* is
within 1000 bp (Supplementary Fig. S2), conﬁrming short-range
co-occurrence among BSs in regulatory regions. We further ana-
lyzed 11 TF pairs with 1* =50 bp, as these TFs are likely to
cluster at closer distances. After calculating their Zc(1) for
1<50, we found seven pairs having most signiﬁcant clustering
within 6bp and the other four pairs close to 50 bp
(Supplementary Table S2). BSs with a gap less than a few base
pairs are often considered a composite site bound by a complex,
while those separated by a few hundred base pairs have been seen
in CRMs (Zhou and Wong, 2004).

We compared our approach with a simple overlapping ana-
lysis for the co-occurrence of BSs of two TFs in the upstream
regions. We calculated the X2 statistics and found that all TF
pairs but one (ch3 and cMyc) are signiﬁcant. The X2 statistics
and our 71000 are positively correlated, but there is no exact
correspondence between the two (Supplementary Fig. S3). Our
method gives more information than the simple overlapping ana-
lysis does. It not only suggests that the TFBSs co-occur in up-
stream regions but also provides the signiﬁcance levels for
different distances. Furthermore, our method is able to detect
a clustering pattern where two TFs bind a certain base pairs

apart, reﬂected by a peak in the curve of Zc(1), such as the ex-
amples shown in Figure 1C and D.

Our clustering statistic 71000 can provide detailed information
about the co-binding pattern among a set of TFs. To demon-
strate this, we performed single-linkage hierarchical clustering of
the 14 TFs with 21000 as the pairwise similarity measure. The left
margin of the heatmap in Figure 2 shows the resulting cluster
dendrogram, in which TFs that merge at a lower level have a
more signiﬁcant clustering pattern. One sees that a tight cluster
can be formed by cMyc, nMyc, E2f1 and fo with high values of
71000 between them. These four TFs are the members of the so-
called cMyc group deﬁned in previous studies (Chen et al., 2008;
Ouyang et al., 2009). Further moving up the dendrogram, the
cMyc group merges with Klf4 and other TFs from the Oct4
group, including Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, Esrrb, chcp2ll, Smad1
and Stat3. As expected, one sees another tight cluster of Oct4,
Sox2 and Nanog from the heatmap. In addition to partitioning
the TFs into two separate groups as suggested by Chen et al.
(2008), our result reveals that some Oct4 group TFs extensively
co-bind with the cMyc group as well. The existence of a large
number of genes extensively bound by both groups has been
reported in previous studies (Chen et al., 2008; Chen and
Zhou, 2011). An integrated analysis of ChIP-Seq, motif and
gene expression data suggested that the co-binding among the
Oct4 group TFs occurs in a Myc-dependent way (Lee and Zhou,
2013). In both ESCs and induced pluripotent stem cells, genes
associated with cMyc binding, by itself or in combination with
Oct4, Sox2 and Klf4, are signiﬁcantly enriched for regulators of
metabolic processes, while genes co-bound by Oct4, Sox2 and
Klf4 in absence of cMyc are mainly implicated in regulation of
development (Sridharan et al., 2009). Combined with these pub-
lished data, the tree structure in Figure 2 provides new biological
insights with interesting functional implications into the co-regu—
lation among these core TFs in mouse ESCs. We also noticed
that ch3, a component in the Wnt-signaling pathway, showed

signiﬁcant clustering patterns with the core ESC regulators,
Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog, consistent with the observation in
Marson et al. (2008). It was veriﬁed in a recent study (Zhang
et al., 2013) by electrophoretic mobility shift assay that ch3
competes with Sox2 for the Sox motif in Oct-Sox composite
sites, which may counter pluripotency. This shows another ex-
ample of complicated interactions among multiple TFs to imple-
ment diverse transcriptional programs. These examples support
the View that combinatorial binding patterns may have import-
ant implications in the expression and functions of target genes.
Thus, we performed a systematic combined analysis of clustering
binding patterns and gene expression data (see next subsection).

3.2 BS clustering and differential gene expression

Zhou et al. (2007) have generated gene expression proﬁles in
mouse ESCs by sorting cells according to the expression level
of the gene Oct4. The expression data consist of eight samples
with high Oct4 expression and eight samples with low Oct4 ex-
pression. By two-sample comparison between the two groups of
samples, they deﬁned 1325 Oct4-sorted + genes, which showed a
strong positive correlation with Oct4 expression, and 1440 Oct4-
sorted— genes with the opposite expression pattern. It is interest-
ing to examine whether the clustering binding pattern between a
pair of TFs is different between the upstream regions of these
two gene sets. To give a concrete example, among the 375
common target genes of Oct4 and Sox2, 56 of them are in the
Oct4-sorted + set and 11 in the Oct4-sorted— set. We wish to test
if the clustering binding pattern of these two TFs shows any
difference between the upstream regions of the 56 Oct4-sorted +
genes and those of the 11 Oct4-sorted— genes. In general, for a
pair of TFs X and Y, denote by $1 and 52, respectively, the sets
of Oct4-sorted+ and Oct4-sorted— target genes of the two TFs.
For each gene in either set, we calculate a Z—score for a distance
level 1,

AU)
29(1) = W forr e s, u 52, (23)
0r(t)

which is one term in the summation of (11). Note that every
Zg’)(1) has zero mean and unit variance under the null hypothesis
H0. Now regarding {29(1) : r e 51} and {Zg’)(1) : r e 52} as two
groups of standardized observations, we use the two-sample
t-statistic, denoted by T (1), to test if the two group means are
identical. Again, an overall statistic, 71000, is calculated as the
mean of T (1) over 1: 50, . . . , 1000 for each pair.

Among the 86 TF pairs showing a clustering pattern, 15 of
them also have a signiﬁcant 71000 at an FDR of <5%
(Supplementary Table S3). The signiﬁcant 71000 statistics are
all positive, indicating that the mean of the 29> statistics of the
Oct4-sorted+ target genes is greater than that of the Oct4-
sorted— target genes. In other words, the clustering binding pat-
tern between a TF pair in the table is more signiﬁcant in up-
stream of the Oct4-sorted+ genes than in that of the Oct4-
sorted— genes. One possible explanation for this difference is
that these TFs work in concert to activate Oct4-sorted+ genes,
which are upregulated in ESCs, but may regulate Oct4-sorted—
genes and promote early differentiation with other co-regulators
not included in our analysis. This result demonstrates a clear
association between the co-binding pattern of two TFs and the

Detecting clustering and ordering binding patterns

 

expression of their target genes, suggesting that how TFs co-lo-
calize to the DNA sequence may serve as some subtle signal for
downstream gene regulation.

3.3 Ordering among TF binding

We apply the ordering detection method to the 86 pairs of TFs
with a signiﬁcant clustering pattern. To better understand the
detailed procedure, we describe each step of our analysis for
the pair of E2f1 (X) and fo (Y).

For this pair, the most signiﬁcant clustering distance 1* = 300,
and thus, the model parameter 6 = (6_300, . . . , 6300) as deﬁned in
(14). We counted the number of pairwise BSs, 99- and 32,-, with
distance d =0, ...,1* and added a little pseudo-count to each
value of d to avoid zero counts. These counts were normalized
into frequencies Cd, d =0,  1*, which were used as the initial
estimate 6(0) with 680) =00 and 6:021:62?) = cd/2 for d 2 1. As a
result, the initial estimate of 6 was symmetric. Starting with 6(0),
the EM algorithm developed in the Supplementary Document
was run until convergence. We then smoothed the EM estimate 6
by a cubic smoothing spline (using the R function
‘smooth.spline’). The plots for the initial value 6(0) and the EM
estimate 6 (after smoothing) for this pair are shown in
Supplementary Figure S4, with a demonstration of the mixture
density fleQ/lx) (18). Note that although the initial estimate is
symmetric by construction, the EM estimate is not symmetric but
satisﬁes the constraint (15) speciﬁed by the null hypothesis H0.
With this way of initialization, the EM algorithm often converges
after a few iterations. Given 6, it is easy to follow the ordering
testing procedure to calculate Z0(1*). For E2f1 and fo, we ob-
tained Z0(300)= 12.0 with a P—Value of 0. Clearly, there is a
signiﬁcant ordering binding pattern between the two TFs
within a distance of 1* = 300 bp. Moreover, the positive Z0
value indicates that the BSs of fo (Y) are much more likely to
locate to the right of those of E2f1 (X), along the direction of
gene transcription. We also repeated the same procedure but
switched the labeling of the two TFs to see if the result is con-
sistent. The resulting ordering statistic ZO’ = — 12.7, which sug-
gests the same ordering between the binding of the two TFs with
an almost identical signiﬁcance level.

At an FDR of < 1%, we detected seven pairs of TFs showing
ordering preferences between their BSs (Table 1). For all these
pairs, switching the labels of X and Y gave essentially the same
conclusion on the ordering pattern with comparable absolute
values between the two statistics, Z0 and Z]. The geometric
mean of the P—Values of Z, and Z0’ was calculated as the overall

measure of the statistical signiﬁcance for a pair. Note that in the
table all pairs are labeled so that X precedes Y (i.e. Z0 >0) for
easy understanding. The ordering between two TFs may be a
local feature that only occurs for BSs within the clustering dis-
tance 1* or a global feature that reﬂects that the BSs of one TF
tend to locate in upstream of those of the other one. Both pat-
terns can be captured by our testing procedure. We performed a
two-sample comparison on the BS locations for each of the seven
pairs and found that three of them, E2f1/cMyc (P = 7.4 x 10‘15),
E2f1/fo (P=7.2 x10—11) and chcp211/fo (P=3.8 x 10—5),
showed signiﬁcant global difference in their binding locations
consistent with the orderings reported in Table l. The other
four pairs showed no signiﬁcant global difference and thus the
detected ordering patterns here are speciﬁc to tightly clustered
BSs.

The pairwise ordering patterns can be combined to produce an
ordering relation graph among multiple TFs. Regarding cMyc
and nMyc together as the Myc TF, we encapsulate all the de-
tected pairwise ordering patterns into such a graph in Figure 3A.
In this graph, an edge from X to Y means that X precedes Y
along the direction of gene transcription. If X precedes Y and Y
precedes Z, we conclude that X also precedes Z and link the three
TFs into a chain, X — Y— Z. One sees three chains ending at
fo, meaning that the BSs of fo tend to be the closest one to the
TSS. In addition, there is a full ordering among the cMyc group
TFs (E2f1, cMyc/nMyc and fo) and Klf4, which is often re-
garded as a TF in between the Oct4 and the cMyc groups
(Ouyang et al., 2009) (also see Fig. 2). A example region with
the exact full ordering is provided in Figure 3B. This seems to
suggest a special sequential ordering in the co-binding of the
cMyc group TFs. We found 866 genes whose upstream regions
have BSs from all the three cMyc group TFs within 300 bp, the
maximum 1* value between pairs in this group (Table l), and 233
of them have at least one 300-bp region in which the BSs follow
the exact ordering (E2f1—Myc—fo). We call the 233 genes the
ordering group (Supplementary Table S4) and the other 633
genes the non-ordering group. Enriched gene ontology terms
with P—Value < 10‘9 in the ordering group include ribosome bio-
genesis, translation, macromolecule metabolic process and RNA

processing, suggesting involvement in some most basic and fun-
damental biological processes. There are 28 Oct4-sorted+ but
only 5 Oct4-sorted— genes in the ordering group, showing a no-
ticeable depletion of genes downregulated in ESCs. We then
examined the expression proﬁles in the Oct4-sorted series
(Zhou et al., 2007) of the ordering group (Supplementary Fig.
S5) and those of the non-ordering group (Supplementary Fig.
S6). The expression proﬁle of each gene was normalized to have
zero mean and unit standard deviation. The ordering group has a
higher normalized expression level in the Oct4-high samples than
the non-ordering group (P: 8.0 X 1075), while the non-ordering
group shows a higher expression level in the Oct4-low samples
than the ordering group (P: 1.3 x 10‘5). These observations
indicate potential association between the ordering among BSs
and the expression pattern of the target gene. Further experimen-
tal investigations hold the key to understanding the regulatory
role of the exact ordering among the BSs and its relation to the
functions of the target genes.

4 DISCUSSION

We have developed new statistical methods to detect combina-
torial binding patterns from ChIP-Seq data. More speciﬁcally,
we have proposed test statistics for clustering and ordering ana-
lysis for a pair of TFs. To construct ﬂexible and threshold-free
statistics, bivariate K-functions for Poisson point processes are
used and further developed. With a proper normalization, the
null distributions can be well-approximated by the standard
normal distribution, which avoids the use of simulation-based
P—Value approximation. This makes our approach suitable for
large-scale data. The test statistics can be used not only to make a
binary decision, but also to measure how strong a speciﬁc bind-
ing pattern is between two TFs. Our procedures also offer simple
ways to extend the pairwise analysis to multiple TFs, as demon-
strated by the hierarchical tree among the binding patterns
(Fig. 2) and the ordering relation graph (Fig. 3A). Novel and
interesting biological insights can be provided by such new ana-
lysis. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the ﬁrst
systematical development for detecting ordering patterns
among TFBSs. This work reports strong evidence (with small
P—Values and FDRs) for the existence of speciﬁc binding ordering
among a set of TFs.

In this study, we predict the exact BSs from ChIP-Seq peaks
by scoring w-mers, assuming that each ChIP-seq peak has exactly
one BS. The maximum-scored w-mer is regarded as the BS for
the region. One future direction is to take into account the un-
certainty in the exact location of a BS. For example, we may
normalize the likelihood ratio scores (22) to deﬁne a probability
distribution for the BS in a ChIP-Seq peak and incorporate this
distribution into our detection procedures. We may also consider
the possibility that some peaks are false positives and may not
contain a BS. In this case, exact P—Value calculation (Touzet and
Varré, 2007) will be needed to decide which w-mers are more
likely the BSs. A direct generalization to multivariate K-functions
seems infeasible when the number of TFs becomes large. To
extend our methods to the study of multiple TF binding patterns,
we may analyze the change in pairwise patterns with respect to
the binding of a third TF or some score constructed by the bind-
ing of a few other TFs.

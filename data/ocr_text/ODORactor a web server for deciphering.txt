ABSTRACT

Summary: ODORactor is an open access web server aimed
at providing a platform for identifying odorant receptors (CBS)
for small molecules and for browsing existing OR-ligand pairs.
It enables the prediction of ORs from the molecular structures
of arbitrary chemicals by integrating two individual functionalities:
odorant verification and OR recognition. The prediction of the ORs
for several odorants was experimentally validated in the study.
In addition, ODORactor features a comprehensive repertoire of
olfactory information that has been manually curated from literature.
Therefore, ODORactor may provide an effective way to decipher
olfactory coding and could be a useful server tool for both basic
olfaction research in academia and for odorant discovery in industry.

1 INTRODUCTION

The detection of volatile odorants is mediated by odorant receptors
(ORs) in the olfactory sensory neurons of the nose (Buck and
Axel, 1991). Mammalian ORs comprise the largest subfamily of
G protein-coupled receptors on the cell-surface membranes of
these neurons. To understand how the plethora of ligands in the
environment are detected and discriminated at the molecular level,
it is essential to match ORs with their cognant odorant molecules.
Previous studies attempted to compile pertinent information of ORs
into a database format. The most comprehensive OR database to
date is the Olfactory Receptor Database (ORDB), which includes
sequence, expression and orthology information for ORs in >50
species (Crasto et al., 2002). The Human Olfactory Data Explorer
(HORDE), which is also accessible through ORDB, is specially
formulated for human ORs to include practical genomic information
(Safran et al., 2003). In addition to the sequence and expression
information, many studies have provided functional proﬁles of ORs
using a diverse array of techniques. Recently, large-scale matching
of ORs to ligands was made possible though the establishment of

a number of heterologous expression systems. With an increasing
number of deorphaned mammalian ORs, it became imperative to
integrate these data into an all-inclusive database. However, to our
knowledge, there is yet no such chemical biology database detailing
OR—ligand pairs in mammals.

While extracting OR-ligand pairs from literature to a database
may provide accessibility, the power to infer novel candidate
receptors for a given ligand would ultimately fuel further research
in the ﬁeld. Several studies used computational models to predict
olfactory responses based on existing ones. For example, Khan et al.
employed principle component analysis (PCA) for the reduction of
the dimensionality of percept and of physicochemical descriptors
to explain the pleasantness of novel molecules by their properties
(Khan et al., 2007). The same group also demonstrated that a
multidimensional metric may be a better predictor of differences
in olfactory neuronal activities (Haddad et al., 2008). Recently,
using an OR heterologous expression system that supports efﬁcient
OR functional activation upon ligand stimulation, we robustly de-
orphaned 62 human and mouse ORs and used the data to develop a
model for predicting odorant-receptor activation (Saito et al., 2009).

In this study, we present for the ﬁrst time a web server for
predicting the ORs for small-molecule compounds, made possible
by the permutation of two individual models aimed at deﬁning an
odorant and then predicting its candidate ORs. In benchmark studies,
the model for odorant determination shows a high accuracy of ~95%
on the test data and the model for receptor recognition has improved
performance by ~20% in comparison with the previous method
(Saito et al., 2009). More importantly, the prediction of the ORs for
several odorants using ODORactor was experimentally validated in
the study. Thus, the dual prediction capability and the user-friendly
interface of this web server can be readily applied to experiments
involving mammalian ORs to serve as a starting point for identifying
the respective receptors for chemicals of interest by allowing a more
informed approach in selecting odorants and receptors.

2 SERVER DESCRIPTION

2.1 Olfactory resource

All olfactory data collected from scientiﬁc literature and resources
are stored in a MySQL database and available in the ‘Browse’ page
of the ODORactor server (Supplementary Fig. 81). It contains two
types of data: (i) odorants; (ii) ORs in both human and mouse. In
total, 3038 odorants and 1608 ORs are curated and fully annotated
by the server developers and experts in the ﬁeld. Of the 1608 ORs

ODORactor

 

in ODORactor, 1451 (90.23%) proteins are included by ORDB and
HORDE. Contrary to the receptors, >96.8% of the odorants are
not previously covered under the ‘Odor Database’ in ORDB. Users
can access information on ‘odorant’ annotation, such as molecular
weight, formula, SMILES, CAS ID. Furthermore, the known ORs
for the odorant are listed with original references (Supplementary
Fig. Sl). Alternatively, users have the option of retrieving relevant
‘receptor’ information, including all veriﬁed odorants and external
links to GenBank and Swissprot.

2.2 Odorant Identiﬁcation

Odorant Identiﬁcation in ODORactor performs on two individual
steps: odorant veriﬁcation and OR recognition, which are thoroughly
described in the ‘Materials and Methods’ of the Supplementary
Material. Four input options are provided for a certain organic
molecule query, Viz., entering the SMILES under ‘SMILES’,
uploading a molecular ﬁle in the MDL mol format under ‘Structure
File’, sketching the structure under ‘Structure’ and selecting a
deposited CAS ID under ‘Inclusion’. After deﬁning query molecule,
two mandatory parameters must be set in order to submit a job:
specifying a ‘Job Name’ enables the users to easily locate their
queries in the Job Queue and selecting the ‘Organism’ for the
retrieval of potential ORs from our OR repertoire against the query
molecule. Once the run is submitted, a transition window pops up
with an associated Job ID. Each job submission is provided with
unique Job ID based on the current date and time that serves as a
permanent bookmarkable link to the data. The users can apply the
unique Job ID or Job Name to track the progress of the calculation in
the ‘Job Queue’ page of ODORactor. Atypical run of ODORactor j ob
takes 15—30 s, depending on the complexity of the input molecule.
Therefore, huge molecules with more than 250 atoms are not allowed
to run in current version of ODORactor due to extended running
time. Upon completion of a job, a button labeled ‘Finished’ emerges
in the ‘Job Queue’ page and can redirect the users to the result. In
the future, we plan to update the list of ORs every 6 months in order
to provide the latest receptors to screen.

The output in ODORactor is split into three main sections, namely,
‘Details of Molecule’, ‘Receptor List’ and ‘Download’. ‘Details
of Molecule’ provides the ﬁrst result of ODORactor on odorant
veriﬁcation and some important descriptors of the molecule are
also shown in the panel. If the query molecule is predicted as an
odorant in ‘Type’, the subsequent prediction of ORs will be run
in ODORactor to give the second result of ODORactor on OR
recognition, shown in ‘Receptor List’, which includes all predicted
receptors along with their overall conﬁdence scores in probability.
The conﬁdence score is provided for each potential receptor—
ligand interaction as described in the ‘Materials and Methods’
of Supplementary Material and ranges from 0% to 100%, with
0% indicating maximum conﬁdence for noninteraction and 100%
indicating maximum conﬁdence for interaction between odorant and
OR. For example, a potential OR for a query molecule with the
estimated probability of 90% should be more likely to be the receptor
than one with a probability of 60%. Therefore, only potential ORs of
the query molecule with probabilities >50% are ranked as positives
in descending order. In addition to the Visualizations, all results and
annotations in ODORactor can be downloaded as XML text for
analyses under the ‘Download’ panel.

We have extensively tested our algorithm (Supplementary
Tables Sl and S2) and two examples of these are provided in
the Help page. To further test the reliability of ODORactor server

in practice, an in—house fragment library, which is composed of
210 small organic compounds and used to screen the fragment-
based hit discovery, was evaluated for their olfactory responses
among the mouse ORs Via the server (Supplementary Table S3).
Among the compounds, three were predicted to be odorous and their
potential receptors were outputted. Furthermore, the interactions
between the three compounds and their respective top ﬁve receptors
identiﬁed Via the ODORactor were evaluated using a luciferase
reporter gene assay (see ‘Materials and Methods’ of Supplementary
Material). Among the predicted candidates, seven OR-odorant pairs
were experimentally validated (Supplementary Fig. S2 and Table
S4). Therefore, we believe that our computational models represent
an effective means of deciphering olfactory coding and could be
a useful tool for both basic olfactory research and industry-scale
receptor-odorant matching.

3 DISCUSSION

We have developed the ODORactor web server that functions as a
platform for the advanced identiﬁcation of chemical odorants and
their cognate receptors in combination with an olfactory repository
covering annotated odorants, receptors and their interactions. To
the best of our knowledge, this web server is the ﬁrst of its
kind and will be of considerable value to scientists interested
in olfaction. We have demonstrated that ODORactor is capable
of identifying novel odorants and their receptors. For example,
we predicted and subsequently validated additional ligands for
MOR271—1 and MOR272—1, which were previously matched to
ligands of diverse structures. The potencies of these newly identiﬁed
ligands, as assessed by their respective EC50 values, fall within
the same previously described range for each of the receptors.
In addition, using ODORactor, we were able to successfully de-
orphan two mouse ORs, MOR244—3 and Olfr42, matching them
to 3 and 1 ligands, respectively. Finally, a prominent strength
of this web service is its ongoing integration of up-to-date
information of both odorant and its receptors from literature for
improving its prediction power. The ODORactor server is available
at http://mdl.shsmu.edu.cn/ODORactor.

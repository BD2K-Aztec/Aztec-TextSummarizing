ABSTRACT

Motivation: RNA-Seq uses the high-throughput sequencing technol-
ogy to identify and quantify transcriptome at an unprecedented high
resolution and low cost. However, RNA-Seq reads are usually not
uniformly distributed and biases in RNA-Seq data post great chal-
lenges in many applications including transcriptome assembly and
the expression level estimation of genes or isoforms. Much effort
has been made in the literature to calibrate the expression level esti-
mation from biased RNA-Seq data, but the effect of biases on tran-
scriptome assembly remains largely unexplored.

Results: Here, we propose a statistical framework for both transcrip-
tome assembly and isoform expression level estimation from biased
RNA-Seq data. Using a quasi-multinomial distribution model, our
method is able to capture various types of RNA-Seq biases, including
positional, sequencing and mappability biases. Our experimental
results on simulated and real RNA-Seq datasets exhibit interesting
effects of RNA-Seq biases on both transcriptome assembly and
isoform expression level estimation. The advantage of our method is
clearly shown in the experimental analysis by its high sensitivity and
precision in transcriptome assembly and the high concordance of its
estimated expression levels with quantitative reverse transcription—
polymerase chain reaction data.

1 INTRODUCTION

RNA-Seq, or deep sequencing of RNAs, takes the advantage of
recent high-throughput sequencing methods to detect and quan-
tify transcriptomes (Mortazavi et al., 2008). The RNA-Seq tech-
nology is becoming a standard and fundamental protocol in
transcriptomic research and has successfully been applied to
study different organisms, diseases and cancers. Various
bioinformatics algorithms and tools have been developed for
RNA-Seq data analysis, including read mapping and junction
discovery (Au et al., 2010; Trapnell et al., 2009), the expression
level estimation of genes/isoforms and differential expression
analysis (Langmead et al., 2010; Mortazavi et al., 2008),

transcriptome assembly from mapped reads (e.g. Feng et al.,
2010; Guttman et al., 2010; Li et al., 2011a, b; Trapnell
et al., 2010) or de novo assembly (e.g. Birol et al., 2009;
Grabherr et al., 2011; Peng et al., 2011), etc. Despite the success
of these RNA-Seq applications, many challenges remain in the
analysis of RNA-Seq data, one of which comes from the under-
standing and handling of biases in RNA-Seq data.

The term ‘bias’ refers to the non-random, non-uniform distri-
bution of the sequenced fragments (or ‘reads’) across the
involved isoforms [or messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts] in
an RNA-Seq experiment. Both positional (Dohm et al., 2008;
Mortazavi et al., 2008) and sequencing biases (Hansen et al.,
2010; Li et al., 2010b) are routinely observed in RNA-Seq
experiments. Positional bias is the non-uniform distribution of
reads over different positions of a transcript, while sequencing
bias refers to the distribution of reads related to the sequence
content and priming method (Li et al., 2010b). Since many
next-generation sequencing applications (including RNA-Seq)
require the mapping of reads to the reference genome, the mapp-
ability bias is also an important source of biases in RNA-Seq and
ChIP-Seq (Rozowsky et al., 2009; Schwartz et al., 2011). The
mappability bias arises when read counts are biased due to
read mapping. For example, some reads may not be mapped
due to sequencing errors and some applications discard reads
mapped to the repeat regions of the reference genome; the num-
bers of reads are thus under-counted for these regions. Also,
incorrect read mapping leads to incorrect read counts for regions
where the involved reads are mapped to.

Biases in RNA-Seq data may cause inaccurate expression level
estimation of genes (or isoforms), where most bias correction
methods try to overcome. For example, positional biases are
handled by learning non-uniform read distributions from given
RNA-Seq reads or modeling the RNA degradation ON an et al.,
2012; Wu et al., 2011). In Srivastava and Chen (2010), a general-
ized Poisson (GP) model is used to calculate the expression levels
of genes affected mainly by sequencing biases. Other approaches
include checking the repeat regions of the reference genome to
handle mappability biases (Lee et al., 2010; Richard et al., 2010),
modeling the dependency between neighboring positions to cor-
rect sequencing biases (Li et al., 2010b) or a combination of
several strategies (Roberts et al., 2011). However, some methods
can handle only one speciﬁc type of biases (e.g. Richard et al.,
2010; Wu et al., 2011) or correct biases only at the gene level
(Srivastava and Chen, 2010). Other more general methods use
sophisticated probabilistic generative models that require the
learning of a large number of parameters and thus have to

RNA-Seq Transcriptome Assembly and Abundance Estimation

 

make some simplifying assumptions to make the computation
tractable (Li et al., 2010b; Roberts et al., 2011).

Besides expression level estimation, the RNA-Seq biases also
have signiﬁcant effects on transcriptome assembly. For example,
RNA-Seq biases may generate ‘gap regions’ on the reference
genome where no mapped reads are observed. Because of these
gaps, two broken transcripts may be assembled instead of one
complete transcript. Also, incorrectly mapped reads may lead to
incorrect transcript assemblies. As far as we know, most work in
the literature concerning RNA-Seq biases deal with correcting
gene (or isoform) expression level estimation, and the effects of
biases on the transcriptome assembly remain largely unexplored.

In this article, we propose a statistical framework based on the
quasi-multinomial distribution model (Consul and Jain, 1973;
Consul and Mittal, 1977) to capture the above-mentioned
RNA-Seq biases, including positional, sequencing and mappabil-
ity biases. The framework allows us to develop an expectation—
maximization (EM) algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977; Nicolae
et al., 2010) for both transcriptome assembly and isoform abun-
dance level estimation from biased RNA-Seq data. Compared
with other algorithms in the literature that use sophisticated
probabilistic generative models to handle biases, our EM algo-
rithm uses a single parameter to capture the property of
RNA-Seq biases of different types. Utilizing the isoform enumer-
ation algorithm of IsoLasso (Li et al., 2011b), the EM algorithm
assembles isoforms and estimates their abundance levels at the
same time. Moreover, both principles of prediction accuracy and
interpretation (or ‘sparsity’) considered in Li et al. (2011b) are
achieved in the assembly.

The statistical framework and the EM algorithm are intro-
duced in Sections 2 and 3, we demonstrate the superior perform-
ance of our EM algorithm compared with other algorithms in
the literature through simulated and real RNA-Seq experiments
and analyze the effects of RNA-Seq biases on both transcrip-
tome assembly and isoform abundance level estimation. Due to
the page limit, we defer some ﬁgures and technical derivations to
the Supplementary Materials.

2 METHODS

2.1 The quasi-multinomial model for isoform abundance
level estimation

Consider a gene G consisting of M exons with length ll, .. . , [M (or more
generally, the so-called ‘expressed segments’ as deﬁned in Feng et al.
(2010), each of which is a contiguous region of the reference genome
not separated by any exon—intron boundary). If G induces N isoforms
(denoted as T = {t1, ..., tN}), then these isoforms can be represented as
an N x M binary matrix A 2 {am}, where am 2 1 if isoform t‘ includes
exon (or expressed segment) j, and 0 otherwise. Let X]- be the random
variable of the read counts falling into exon j. Under the assumption that
a read r is sampled uniformly from an isoform (the ‘Poisson assumption’),
X]- follows a Poisson distribution with parameter A]- proportional to
the length of exon j and the total abundance level of all isoforms con-
taining exon j (Jiang and Wong, 2009). The abundance level is usually
measured by RPKM (Mortazavi et al., 2008) or FPKM (Trapnell et al.,
2010) and can be estimated by maximizing the joint probability of obser-
ving x1, ...,xM reads in M exons, as proposed in Jiang and Wong
(2009).

In the following, we develop a quasi-multinomial model (Consul and
Mittal, 1977) to capture biases in RNA-Seq data. Consider a single-end

(or paired-end) read rj of length L that is mapped to exon j of length 
from gene G. Denote 0,- : P(t’) as the prior probability that read rj comes
from t‘ with the constraint 1 0,- = 1. We may think of the process of
sampling rj as follows: one of the isoforms t‘ is ﬁrst randomly selected
with probability 0,- and then a read rj belonging to exon j is sampled from
t‘ with probability P(rj|ti). To model positional (and other) biases, the
probability P(rj|ti) can be deﬁned as a distribution f(k,,j) depending on
the location km- of rj in t‘. Note that if f is the uniform distribution, then

dial]; — L + 1)

P(leli)= L._L+1 ,

(1)
where L, is the length of t‘. f(kj,j) can also be an exponential function to
model the RNA degradation process which plays an important role in the
formation of the positional bias (Wan et al., 2012).

Several strategies can be used to construct a non-uniform distribution f.
For example, a non-uniform positional distribution can be determined
empirically and incorporated into f (W u et al., 2011). The ‘effective length’
of isoforms excluding repeat regions of the reference genome can be used
in Equation (1) to handle mappability biases (Richard et al., 2010).

The probability of observing read rj is thus

N N
Pa) = 2 130110130") = Z earn), (2)
i=1 i=1

and the joint probability of observing R reads mapped to gene G follows
a quasi-multinomial distribution:

“RIG” T): (Xi, ...,XM)(1+ Rt)1—R
M
HP<rJ~><P<rJ~> + maxi—1, <3)
j=1

where r> — 1 / R is the bias parameter. The value of 1 indicates how read
counts differ from a multinomial distribution: if r>0 then too many
reads are observed (called ‘over-dispersion’) and if r< 0 (called
‘under-dispersion’), fewer reads are observed.

Note that the GP distribution GP()tJ-, ,0) (Consul and Jain, 1973) is
used in Srivastava and Chen (2010) for modeling RNA-Seq biases,
where —1 5 ,0 5 1 is the parameter to account for the biases. The GP
model can also be used to estimate isoform expression levels. In fact,
Equation (3) can be approximated by a product of M GP distributions
(Consul and Mittal, 1977), and ﬁnding an optimal I would be equivalent
to ﬁnding an optimal ,0 in the GP model (see Supplementary Materials).
However, the GP model uses only the information of read counts and it
does not consider the fact that a read may come from different isoforms
with different probabilities due to the sampling biases.

2.2 Transcriptome assembly

Transcriptome assembly (for a ﬁxed gene) from mapped RNA-Seq reads
usually generates a set of candidate isoforms (i.e. the isoform matrix
A = {a,-,J-}), and then selects one or more of these candidates according
to several criteria such as prediction accuracy, interpretation and complete-
ness (Li et al., 2011b).

We use the candidate isoform enumeration algorithm introduced in
IsoLasso (Li et al., 2011b), which is proven to generate the same set of
candidate isoforms considered by Cufﬂinks (Trapnell et al., 2010). The
algorithm ﬁrst enumerates all possible paths in the connectivity graph
(Guttman et al., 2010) constructed from the mapped reads. Then two
additional steps are applied to remove infeasible paths and non-maximal
paths.

IsoLasso uses the LASSO algorithm (Tibshirani, 1996) to select can-
didate isoforms and estimate their abundance levels. However, the
LASSO algorithm is solved by constrained quadratic programming
which could be very slow if many constraints are imposed. Moreover,

it is unable to handle biases in RNA-Seq data. We will develop an EM
algorithm (called component elimination EM) in the next section based on
the above quasi-multinomial model to select candidate isoforms and
estimate their abundance levels from biased RNA-Seq data. Note that
EM algorithms are routinely used in RNA-Seq data analysis (e.g. Nicolae
et al., 2010; Trapnell et al., 2010), and several EM algorithms have been
proposed in the literature to use information beyond read counts to im-
prove the accuracy of isoform abundance level estimation. For example,
multi-reads (i.e. reads mapped to several locations of the reference
genome) are utilized to estimate the abundance levels of isoforms
(Li et al., 2010a) or homologous genes (Pasaniuc et al., 2010). Also, the
distribution of the fragment length in paired-end RNA-Seq data can be
incorporated into the EM algorithms to address the effect of fragment
selection in RNA-Seq library preparation (Roberts et al., 2011; Salzman
et al., 2011; Trapnell et al., 2010). Such information can be readily
incorporated to our quasi-multinomial model and the EM algorithm
(see Supplementary Materials).

2.3 Component elimination EM

It is commonly believed that a gene usually has only a few highly
expressed isoforms (Li et al., 2011b). For this reason, ensuring a good
interpretation (or ‘sparsity’) (Hastie et al., 2009) is critical in transcrip-
tome assembly. Generally speaking, in the context of EM algorithm, a
good interpretation is to keep the number of components (i.e. the number
of models whose probabilities are to be determined in the algorithm) as
small as possible (Figueiredo and Jain, 2002). However, if the number of
isoforms (or components) is large, the standard EM algorithm may
deliver results that lack sparsity, i.e. solutions with many components
having small non-negative probabilities instead of solutions with only a
few components having large probabilities while the others having zero
probability (Figueiredo and Jain, 2002). To achieve sparsity, a negative
Dirichlet prior distribution of 0 is added multiplicatively to the
quasi-multinomial likelihood function in Equation (3) (Bicego et al.,
2007; Figueiredo and Jain, 2002):

N
13(0) oc H 0;“, or > 0, (4)
i=1

where or is the negative Dirichlet parameter speciﬁed by the user. The
negative Dirichlet distribution assigns a higher probability if one or more
of the values of 0,- are closer to 0 (see Supplementary Fig. S1). Hence,
solutions with fewer non-zero values of 0,- are preferred.

The likelihood function is the product of Equations (3) and (4)
(see Supplementary Materials). To obtain a maximum a posteriori esti-
mation of 0,- and I using EM, a latent binary variable 2,3]- is introduced to
indicate whether a read rj comes from isoform t‘, 2,3} = 1 if rj comes from
isoform t‘ and 0 otherwise. In the E step of the EM algorithm, the ex-
pectation of 2,3], y”, is evaluated using the current values of 0,,r and
P(rj|ti) as follows:

0,-(P(rj| t‘) + 391)

And in the M step, by maximizing the joint likelihood function with
respect to the constraint 10, = 1, 0,- is updated as (see
Supplementary Materials for a detailed derivation):

Ni—Ol

The maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) value of r can be obtained
using the following equation:

 

i i VLJ'XJ'OCJ' —  =  —  
1.21 1.21 P(7'j|l“) + )9"? 1+ RT

We use the Newton—Raphson method (Ypma, 1995) to calculate the value
of I (see Supplementary Materials for details).

A component elimination EM algorithm (Bicego et al., 2007; Figueiredo
and Jain, 2002) can be used to ﬁnd solutions that favor a small number of
highly expressed isoforms. Compared with the standard EM algorithm, it
applies an additional component elimination step to exclude components
with small probabilities. This method is able to determine the number of
components automatically without having to invoke any model selection
criteria such as the Bayesian Inference Criteria, Minimum Message Length
principle, etc. During the EM iterations, a component elimination step
eliminates isoform t‘ if N,- <a (or set 0,- = 0). Here, the negative Dirichlet
parameter or can be interpreted as the minimum number of reads required
for each isoform to proceed to the next iteration. In this component
elimination EM, 0,- is ﬁxed to 0 once its value reaches <0 in Equation (6).

However, in some component elimination steps (especially at the
beginning of the EM iterations), there could be too many (or all) com-
ponents satisfying the elimination condition N,-<oz. This is because the
probability of each component is initialized randomly, which could be
very small even for highly expressed isoforms if the number of compo-
nents is large. Deleting all of them in one iteration may lead to a poor
choice of components. As a result, we eliminate only one component with
the minimum value of N,- — oz in each iteration.

The parameter or controls the number of isoforms to be output.
The higher the value of or is, the fewer isoforms are reported. Based
on our empirical experience from simulation tests (Section 3), we
set or = max{10, 0.01R} for a gene with R mapped reads in our
experiments.

3 RESULTS

In this section, we test the algorithm on both simulated and real
RNA-Seq data and compare its performance with two
state-of-the-art algorithms for transcriptome assembly and iso-
form abundance level estimation that do not consider RNA-Seq
biases [i.e. IsoLasso (Li et al., 2011b) and Cufﬁinks (Trapnell
et al., 2010)], and a recent extension of Cufﬁinks that takes
biases into account (Roberts et al., 2011). For convenience, we
will refer to the last algorithm simply as ‘Cufﬁinks-bias’. To our
best knowledge, Cufﬁinks—bias is the only algorithm in the lit-
erature that considers RNA-Seq biases and is capable of assem-
bling transcriptome. Note that although SLIDE (Li et al., 2011a)
was published after IsoLasso and Cufﬂinks, we do not compare
with it here because it was only tested on Drosophila melanoga—
ster transcriptome in Li et al. (2011a). During the comparison
study, the parameters of all programs are tuned empirically to
achieve their best performance.

3.1 Simulation

We simulate biased RNA-Seq reads as follows. Known isoforms
from the mus musculus (mm9) annotation database are ﬁrst
downloaded from the UCSC genome browser (Fujita et al.,
2011). Each isoform is then assigned a random abundance
value that follows approximately a log-normal distribution
(Alter et al., 2008; Bengtsson et al., 2005). Afterwards, different
numbers of reads are generated from each isoform according to
the assigned abundance. Sequencing errors and different pos-
itional biases are then simulated to generate the actual reads.
During the simulation, three different positional proﬁles are
provided to determine the position of each read, and 80 million
single-end reads are generated for each proﬁle, including the uni-
form positional model (‘Uniform’ for short) and two Illumina

positional bias models (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Both Illumina
models reﬂect positional biases caused by different fragmenta-
tion methods, including complementary DNA (cDNA) fragmen-
tation (or ‘cDNAf’) and RNA fragmentation (or ‘RNAf’)
(Howard and Heber, 2010; Wang et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2011).
We use the sequencing error proﬁle in Dohm et al. (2008) to
simulate sequencing errors (Supplementary Fig. S2B), where
higher sequencing error is observed for positions at the end
of a read.

The positional bias [i.e. f(k,-,j) in Equation (2)] is learned from
RNA-Seq data using a method similar to Wu et al. (2011).
Basically, RNA-Seq reads are ﬁrst mapped to the RefSeq tran-
script sequences using Bowtie (Langmead et al., 2009), where all
possible mappings for each read are reported. A RefSeq sequence
is selected to estimate its positional bias if the reads mapped to
the sequence satisfy two conditions: (i) they cannot be mapped to
other RefSeq sequences and (ii) the number of the reads is
>1000. The average of the positional biases in these sequences
(~2000) is then fed to the CEM algorithm. Supplementary
Figure S3 demonstrates that the estimated positional biases
from different datasets are close to the real positional biases.

3.1.] Performance on transcriptome assembly The perform-
ance of transcriptome assembly results is evaluated in terms of
both sensitivity and precision, by comparing the predicted sets of
isoforms with UCSC mm9 known isoforms (Hsu et al., 2006). A
predicted isoform is matched to a known one if both isoforms
include the same number of exons and their exon—intron bound-
aries are identical. If K of M predicted isoforms are matched to
K out of N known isoforms, then the sensitivity and precision
are deﬁned as K/M [or TP/(TP + FN)] and K/N [or
T P / (T P + FP)], respectively.

To compare the effects of both positional and mappability
biases on transcriptome assembly, we plot the sensitivity—preci-
sion curves in Figure l for four programs: CEM, IsoLasso (Li
et al., 201 lb), Cufﬂinks (Trapnell et al., 2010) and Cufﬂinks-bias
(Roberts et al., 2011). Here, four different RNA-Seq reads are
provided to the programs: reads with Uniform/cDNAf pos-

 

itional distributions and reads with/without mapping.

Sensitivity

For ‘reads without mapping’ (or ‘w/o mapping’ for short), the
exact locations of the reads on the reference genome are pro-
vided; otherwise (‘reads with mapping’ or ‘mapping’ for short),
simulated reads are mapped to the reference genome using
Tophat (Trapnell et al., 2009) to obtain the locations of the
reads. Compared with the ‘reads with mapping’ case, ‘reads with-
out mapping’ serves as an ideal dataset which is not affected by
mappability biases. Various values of sensitivity and precision in
the curve are obtained by setting different abundance cutoffs
used in the output of the programs. That is, for each cutoff,
only predicted isoforms with estimated abundance levels higher
than the cutoff value are output.

Figure 1A compares the curves of both CEM and Cufﬂinks-
bias. When provided with the correct mapping information (i.e.
w/o mapping), CEM and Cufﬂinks-bias both achieve high sen-
sitivity (>0.45) and precision (>06). A high abundance cutoff
allows only a small number of highly expressed isoforms to be
retained. These isoforms are more likely to be correct (than those
lowly expressed ones), which leads to low sensitivity and high
precision for both CEM and Cufﬂinks-bias (except in groups 3
and 4 due to reasons explained below). Compared with
Cufﬂinks-bias, CEM achieves a better precision for the same
level of sensitivity. CEM also performs best among all four al-
gorithms, as seen in Figure 1B which shows the curves of all four
algorithms using the cDNAf positional bias proﬁle and ‘reads
with mapping’ option.

Both non-uniform positional biases and inaccurate read map-
ping have negative impact on transcriptome assembly. Compared
with non-uniform positional bias dataset, higher sensitivity and
precision values are observed for data generated using the Uni-
form positional proﬁle. Interestingly, positional biases mainly
affect the inference of lowly and moderately expressed isoforms.
This could be seen from the diminishing differences between the
sensitivity—precision curves for data with the Uniform and
cDNAf positional biases in Figure 1A (see groups 1 and 2 and
the CEM curves in groups 3 and 4). The reason is that lowly
expressed isoforms are less likely to have sufﬁcient read coverage
to be assembled completely, since their junctions are less likely to
be fully covered by reads (Feng et al., 2010).

The values of sensitivity and precision decrease drastically
when correct mapping is not guaranteed. Figure 1A shows a
10—15% decrease in sensitivity and a >20% decrease in precision
in groups 3 and 4 compared with groups 1 and 2. Both repeat
sequences of the genome and sequencing errors account for the
decreased sensitivity and precision. This shows that mappability
biases have a more profound effect on transcriptome assembly
than positional biases. Different from positional biases, mapp-
ability biases affect both highly and lowly expressed isoforms.

Interestingly, Cufﬂinks-bias shows reduced performance in
both sensitivity and precision in groups 3 and 4 on ‘reads with
mapping’ for high abundance cutoffs. By inspecting the isoforms
predicted by Cufﬂinks-bias carefully, we found that Cufﬂinks-
bias is highly sensitive to mapping errors. For example, when the
abundance cutoff is set as high as 500 FPKM, ~60% of the
isoforms predicted by Cufﬂinks-bias come from regions with in-
correctly mapped reads. Reads from the junctions of isoforms
located in other regions could be mapped to these regions by
TopHat because these junctions share identical sequences with
those regions. As a result, the predicted isoforms are short com-
pared with the read length, and Cufﬂinks-bias would greatly
over-estimate their abundance levels, since it uses a fragment
length model that assumes short fragments (short DNA se-
quences after fragmentation and before sequencing) are rare
(Trapnell et al., 2010). A speciﬁc example is given in Supplemen-
tary Figure S4 and some statistics are given in Supplementary
Figure S5. A similar observation of this behavior of Cufﬂinks is
also reported recently in Li and Dewey (2011). CEM is less af-
fected by this issue because it makes no assumption about the
distribution of fragment lengths.

3.1.2 Longer read length improves both sensitivity and
precision To investigate the effect of read length on transcrip-
tome assembly, we generate 80 million simulated reads of various
read lengths (from 32 to 200 bp) using the uniform positional
model (i.e. without positional biases) and compare both values
of sensitivity and precision of two programs (CEM and
Cufﬂinks, especially on read with mapping) in Figure 2. Here,
no abundance cutoff is applied to the results of either program.

Figure 2 shows that both sensitivity (A) and precision (B) in-
crease as longer reads are used for assembly. However, such im-
provements tend to slow down as reads get longer. For example,
when read length increases from 32 to 50 bp, the sensitivity of
CEM (on reads with mapping) increases from 0.35 to 0.41. This
increase is much more drastic than the improvement obtained
when increasing read length from 100 to 200 bp, which is only

around 0.03. Similar trends can be observed for Cufﬂinks
(on reads with mapping) and for the value of precision.

Longer reads incur less ambiguity in mapping to the reference
genome. For example, among all 32 bp reads mapped to the
reference genome, 25% can be mapped to multiple locations.
But for the 200 bp reads, only 12% are mapped to more than
one location in the reference genome. However, in spite of the
reduced ambiguity in mapping when longer reads are used, the
differences in sensitivity and precision of both programs on reads
with/without mapping are consistently observed in Figure 2
(which is always ~0.l). This shows that even for long reads,
the mappability bias still affects the accuracy of transcriptome
assembly.

3.1.3 Performance in abundance level estimation We assemble
transcripts from simulated RNA-Seq reads using the above al-
gorithms, and then match their results to known mouse isoforms.
For the matched isoforms, we compare the logarithms of the
predicted and true abundance levels in Table 1 using coeﬂicient
of determination (i.e. the RZ-Value).

As shown in the table, all algorithms achieve high precision in
abundance estimation on both Uniform and RNAf datasets
(R2>0.8), but CEM outperforms the other three methods on
all datasets. The cDNAf positional proﬁle contains more biases
compared with the RNAf proﬁle, since it has a more extreme
head and tail positional distribution as shown in Supplementary
Figure S2A. Not surprisingly, lower RZ-Value is obtained for all
methods on data with cDNAf positional biases. On the other
hand, Cufﬂinks-bias demonstrates a clear advantage over
Cufﬂinks on data with cDNAf positional biases.

3.2 Real data analysis

3.2.1 Correlation with microarray quality control data We
compare the abundance estimations for the microarray quality
control (MAQC) (MAQC Consortium, 2006) Human Brain
Reference (HBR) sample between Taqman quantitative reverse
transcription—polymerase chain reaction (qRT—PCR) measure-
ments and RNA-Seq analysis. The RNA-Seq reads and
qRT—PCR measurements are downloaded from the NCBI
SRA archive (accession number SRA012427) and Gene Expres-
sion Omnibus (accession number GSE5350), respectively. Since
Taqman qRT—PCR only measures the expression levels of genes,
we only compare gene abundance estimations between RNA-Seq
and qRT—PCR. In RNA-Seq, the expression level of a gene is
obtained by summing up the abundance levels of all isoforms
induced by the gene.

RNA-Seq Transcriptome Assembly and Abundance Estimation

 

Among 1097 Taqman qRT—PCR measurements of genes, 289
and 276 are correctly assembled by CEM and Cufﬂinks-bias,
respectively, as shown in Figure 3A. The intersection of both
programs covers 251 transcripts (> 85%), showing a high con-
sistency between both methods. CEM recovers slightly more (13)
transcripts than Cufﬂinks-bias. For the 38 and 25 transcripts
uniquely assembled by CEM and Cufﬂinks-bias, Figure 3B
plots the distribution of their qRT—PCR measurements. A few
highly expressed transcripts are correctly assembled by CEM but
not by Cufﬂinks-bias (for example, the isoforms of the AES gene
shown in Supplementary Fig. S6).

To compare the abundance estimations, we run the four algo-
rithms in two different ways. In the ﬁrst case (the ‘de novo’
approach), the algorithms are invoked to assemble transcripts
and the results are matched against the known structures of
RefSeq transcripts corresponding to Taqman gene measure-
ments. (Note that here the term ‘de novo’ has a different meaning
than it does in ‘de novo assembly’.) The abundance levels are
compared with qRT—PCR measurements only for the matched
genes. In the second case (the ‘refonly’ approach), the structures
of all Taqman transcripts are provided, and the estimated abun-
dance levels of all genes are compared with qRT—PCR
measurements.

Figure 4 shows the RZ-Values between RNA-Seq and Taqman
qRT—PCR measurements for both ‘de novo’ and ‘refonly’
approaches. We ﬁrst compare the RZ-Values of the top 100 pre-
dicted highly expressed genes in Figure 4A (note that different
numbers of genes between 50 and 200 give similar results). For
these genes, the ‘de novo’ approach shows higher values of R2
than the ‘refonly’ approach. And among the four compared
methods, CEM achieves the highest correlation.

However, when comparing RNA-Seq-based abundance esti-
mations of all genes (instead of only highly expressed genes),
Cufﬂinks-bias shows a clear improvement over Cufﬂinks as
shown in Figure 4B and achieves the highest correlation
among all four algorithms. This increased performance of
Cufﬂinks-bias suggests that Cufﬂinks-bias corrects biases the
best in the estimation of the abundance levels of moderately
and lowly expressed genes, while CEM algorithm works the
best for highly expressed genes. This is consistent with the
observed advantage of CEM in the simulated data experiments.

The expression levels of genes also have an impact on the
performance of the ‘de novo’ and ‘refonly’ approaches. For the
100 genes with the highest predicted expression levels, the R2-
Values from the ‘de novo’ approach are higher than those ob-
tained by ‘refonly’ approach where known transcript structures
are provided. However, for all genes, a large improvement in R2-
Values is observed for the ‘refonly’ approach over the ‘de novo’
approach as shown in Figure 4B. This suggests that knowing
correct transcript structures is crucial for estimating the expres-
sion levels of lowly and moderately expressed genes, since it
might be difﬁcult for the algorithms to correctly assemble the
isoforms of these genes from RNA-Seq reads.

We also analyze the regression line between RNA-Seq and
Taqman qRT—PCR measurements in Table 2. The regression
slope reﬂects the fold change between the expression levels of
genes, where the ideal slope of 1.0 indicates that two methods
are perfectly consistent in detecting fold changes between genes.
Table 2 shows that although the RZ-Values are relatively low for

the top 100 genes using the ‘refonly’ approach, CEM, IsoLasso
and Cufﬂinks are able to detect fold changes quite accurately
(slope >0.9). On the other hand, Cufﬂinks-bias is unable to
match the performance on these highly expressed genes
(slope = 0.75) for some reason (e. g. perhaps due to incorrect cor-
rection of their expression levels). Table 2 also shows that
providing transcript structures helps the fold change detection
(the slopes in the refonly columns are >0.75 while the slopes in
the ‘de novo’ columns are only between 0.4 and 0.5).

Supplementary Figure S7 compares the running times of all
four algorithms for processing 80 M paired-end reads on a Linux
machine with 16 G memory and 2.6GHz 8-core CPU. Since
both Cufﬂinks and Cufﬂinks-bias provide the option of multi-
threading (‘-p’ option), we also include the results of both
Cufﬂinks and Cufﬂinks-bias using four threads. We can see
that for both Cufﬂinks and Cufﬂinks-bias, using multiple threads
greatly reduces the processing time needed: only about
one-fourth of the time is required for four threads compared
with one thread. This is partly because transcriptome assembly
can be trivially performed in parallel, allowing reads mapped to
different genes to be processed simultaneously. If only a single
thread is used, the speeds of all algorithms are approximately at
the same level, with CEM slightly leading the edge.

3.2.2 Exon inclusion ratio analysis The exon inclusion ratio
(or ‘percent spliced in’ value, lI!) measures the percentage of
mRNA transcripts that include an exon to the total amount of
transcripts that include or exclude that exon. The lIJ-Value is

frequently used to study the mechanism of alternative splicing
(Pan et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2008; Xiao et al., 2009). In Xiao
et al. (2009), both qRT—PCR and mRNA-Seq experiments are
performed to measure the lIJ-Values for human HEK 293T cells,
including hnRNP H knockdown (or ‘KD’) cells and correspond-
ing control (or ‘CTRL’) cells. RNA-Seq reads are ﬁrst mapped
to the human reference genome, and the lIJ-Value is calculated as
\11 2 d1 / (d1 + dE), where d1 (inclusion density) is deﬁned as the
read density of the test exon and its two ﬁanking junctions and
dE (exclusion density) is the read density of the exclusion junction
formed by the two ﬁanking exons (see Supplementary Fig. S8).
However, this method (called the ‘direct’ method) is sensitive to
the value of dE, which may not be accurate if few reads are
mapped to the exclusion junction. Alternatively, the lIJ-Value
can be calculated based on the abundance levels of two isoforms
including and excluding the test exon: \11 = q1 /(q1 + qE), where ql
and qE are the estimated abundance levels of two isoforms
including and excluding the test exon, respectively, as illustrated
in Supplementary Figure S8. We calculate the lIJ-Values using
both the ‘direct’ method and the above method based on isoform
abundance levels estimated by our CEM algorithm and correlate
the results with the lIJ-Values calculated by qRT—PCR experi-
ments in Table 3.

Table 3 shows a signiﬁcantly improved correlation using the
isoform abundance method based on CEM over the ‘direct’
method. The CEM algorithm achieves higher RZ-Values on
both CTRL and KD datasets, and the regression slope (>0.9)
on the KD dataset shows that the lIJ-Values obtained by CEM
are quite consistent with the qRT—PCR data.

4 CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION

Biases in RNA-Seq data are difﬁcult to deal with because they
affect both transcriptome assembly and isoform abundance

estimation. The current literature focuses on correcting biases
for isoform abundance estimation, but little has been done for
transcriptome assembly. In this article, we present a quasi-
multinomial distribution-based statistical framework and
component elimination EM algorithm for both transcriptome
assembly and isoform abundance estimation from biased
RNA-Seq data. Biases are captured by a single parameter ‘E in
the quasi-multinomial model, and the component elimination
EM algorithm ensures that good interpretation (or sparsity) is
achieved in transcriptome assembly.

Both simulated and real data experiments reveal interesting
effects of different biases. Although the precision and sensitivity
of a method in transcriptome assembly are affected by both pos-
itional and mappability biases, the recovery of isoforms/genes
with different abundance levels are affected differently. While
mappability biases reduce the sensitivity and precision for all
genes, positional biases have a negative effect mainly on lowly
or moderately expressed genes. A comparison between our CEM
algorithm and the other methods in the literature shows that for
highly expressed isoforms, our algorithm achieves higher sensi-
tivity and precision in assembly. Also, our algorithm shows a
higher accuracy in isoform abundance estimation (validated by
MAQC gene expression level measurements).

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Protein domains are fundamental units of protein struc-
ture, function and evolution; thus, it is critical to gain a deep under-
standing of protein domain organization. Previous works have
attempted to identify key residues involved in organization of
domain architecture. Because one of the most important characteris-
tics of domain architecture is the arrangement of secondary structure
elements (SSEs), here we present a picture of domain organization
through an integrated consideration of SSE arrangements and residue
contact networks.

Results: In this work, by representing SSEs as main-chain scaffolds
and side-chain interfaces and through construction of residue contact
networks, we have identified the SSE interfaces well packed within
protein domains as SSE packing clusters. In total, 17 334 SSE packing
clusters were recognized from 9015 Structural Classification of
Proteins domains of <40% sequence identity. The similar SSE packing
clusters were observed not only among domains of the same folds,
but also among domains of different folds, indicating their roles as
common scaffolds for organization of protein domains. Further ana-
lysis of 14 small single-domain proteins reveals a high correlation be-
tween the SSE packing clusters and the folding nuclei. Consistent with
their important roles in domain organization, SSE packing clusters
were found to be more conserved than other regions within the
same proteins.

1 INTRODUCTION

The 3D structure of a protein is crucial for understanding its
physiological function in living cells. Since 1958, numerous
efforts have been spent on determination of protein structures,
and the number of proteins with known structure is increasing
with an exponential speed. By the end of 2013, over 96000 pro-
tein structures have been determined and deposited in the Protein
Data Bank (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/) (Berman et al., 2000).

ven the complexity of protein structures, researchers have
attempted to decompose them to compact and fundamental
units, so called domains, and thus several databases including
CATH (Sillitoe et al., 2013) and Structural Classiﬁcation of
Proteins (SCOP) (Murzin et al., 1995) have been generated to
provide valuable resources for the understanding of protein
structure and function at domain level.

As the fundamental units of proteins, understanding the
organization of domain architectures would deepen our insight
into the relationship between protein structure and function,
which could further facilitate protein structure prediction,
design and simulation. Previously, a number of efforts have
been devoted to identifying key residues involved in organization
of domain architecture, and these works could fall into two cate-
gories. One was to identify a speciﬁc group of residues based on
structural features like hydrophobicity and compactness
(Heringa and Argos, 1991; Swindells, 1995; Zehfus, 1995,
1997). For example, Zehfus (1995, 1997) examined the compact-
ness of hydrophobic clusters within proteins and revealed a cer-
tain correlation between the hydrophobic clusters and protein
folding units. The other attempted to characterize domain archi-
tecture by identifying tertiary packing motifs within domains
based on geometric properties (Bandyopadhyay et al., 2009a,
b; Day et al., 2010; Kannan and Vishveshwara, 1999). For ex-
ample, Day et a]. (2010) applied the Delaunay tessellation to
deﬁne the tetrahedral packing motifs within proteins and
found the general repetitive tetrahedral packing motifs in protein
tertiary structures. All of these works mainly focused on residue-
level contacts, but they did not explicitly consider the important
roles of SSE packing in the organization of domain architectures.

As we know, one of the most important characteristics of
domain architecture is the spatial arrangement of secondary
structure elements (SSE), especially of these regular ones like
oz-helix and ,8—strand (Branden and Tooze, 1991; Lesk, 2001).
The SSE arrangements have been well explored in many pro-
tein families, including helix-turn-helix motif in a class of
DNA-binding proteins called BZIP family proteins (Brennan
and Matthews, 1989; Harrison and Aggarwal, 1990), four-helix
bundles present in many hormones (De Vos et al., 1992) and the
Rossmann fold (8048048 unit) present in nucleotide-binding pro-
teins (Rao and Rossmann, 1973; Rossmann and Argos, 1976).
Many works have been developed in mining SSE motifs in pro-
tein structures (Aung and Li, 2007; Comin et al., 2008; Richards
and Kundrot, 1988); however, most of them treated an SSE as a

simpliﬁed vector representation and did not uncover the details
of underlying residues mediating SSE packing.

To gain a comprehensive picture of domain organization, our
work integrated the previous efforts at both residue level and
SSE level by considering the SSE interfaces as the basic units
for packing of SSEs. We ﬁrst constructed an effective contact
network among side chains within a protein domain, and then
identiﬁed the well-packed SSE interfaces within the network as
an SSE packing cluster. Such SSE packing clusters not only
characterize the domain organization but also shed lights into
the molecular mechanisms underlying domain formation.

2 METHODS

2.1 Domain structure database

The ASTRAL SCOP40 database (Chandonia et al., 2004) was used for
large-scale analysis of domain organization. It is a subset of SCOP data-
base (V1.75) (Murzin et al., 1995) with at most 40% sequence identity
between any two sequences. The domains with missing main chain atoms
or low resolution (>3 A) were excluded. The g—k classes deﬁned in SCOP,
namely small proteins, coiled-coil proteins, low resolution proteins, pep-
tides and fragments and designed proteins, were also removed. In total,
9015 domains were retained in our ﬁnal dataset.

2.2 Definition of scaffold and interfaces for regular
secondary structure element

Regular SSEs play important roles in organizing local conformations of
proteins, and the speciﬁc interactions between different SSEs constitute
the structural basis for protein stability. Previously, PreiBner et a]. (1998)
pointed out that SSE interfaces consist of pairs of matching molecular
surface patches between neighboring SSEs. Based on this concept, in our
study, an SSE was viewed to be composed of main-chain scaffold and
side-chain interfaces (Fig. 1A). Usually, the side chains of an oz-helix sit in
two panels and formed two different interfaces. But when an oz-helix is
fully surrounded by other structure elements, such as within a ,B-barrel, all
its side chains form a continuous cylindrical interface. As for a ,B-strand,
it could offer two separate panel interfaces formed by alternate side
chains at the ﬂank of its main-chain scaffold. One interface consists of
odd-numbered sites and the other consists of even-numbered sites.

2.3 Recognition of SSE packing clusters

Given the decomposition of SSEs to scaffolds and interfaces, the inter-
faces, rather than single residues, could be regarded as basic interaction
units in the arrangement of structure elements within a protein structure.
Based on such interface-mediated interaction model, those interfaces in
close contacts in protein structure were identiﬁed as an SSE packing
cluster, and the recognition of SSE packing clusters was carried out by
the following four steps:

Step 1: Identiﬁcation of buried sites. The residue solvent accessibility
(RSA) for each residue in protein structure was calculated with
NACCESS v2.1.1 (Hubbard, 1992). Those residues with RSA <25%
(the widely adopted criteria as in Bloom et a]. (2006) were identiﬁed as
buried sites.

Step 2: Identiﬁcation of SSE and its buried interfaces. A secondary
structure state (helix, strand and coil) for each site was assigned by
DSSP v2.1.0 (Kabsch and Sander, 1983). Only the two regular secondary
structure states, helix and strand, were considered for deﬁnition of SSE.
A fragment of 27 amino acids with helix state was assigned as an oz-helix
SSE, and a fragment of 24 amino acids with strand state was assigned as
a ,B-strand SSE. The buried interfaces of an SSE were identiﬁed based on
the structural properties of the SSE and the distribution of buried sites.

(SSE PCs). (A) The types of side-chain interfaces in ot-helix and
,B-strand secondary structures. (B). Key steps in recognition of SSE pack-
ing clusters from protein domains

Brieﬂy, for ot-helix, if the i-th buried site and the (i + 1)—th buried site are
within sequence separation <5, they were considered to be in the same
buried interface; otherwise, they belong to different interfaces. For
,B-strand, one interface consisted of odd-numbered sites and the other
consisted of even-numbered sites.

Step 3: Construction of an effective contact network. To characterize the
direct interactions between residues, we attempted to identify the effective
contact between side chains within a distance threshold 16.0A (distance
between side chain centroids). Two side chains are considered to be in
effective contact if the line connecting the centroids of two buried side
chains does not pass through any atoms of the main chain. Such pairs of
side chains constitute an effective contact network.

Step 4: Recognition of SSE packing clusters. Based on the effective
contact network of side chains, the sites that mediate SSE packing
were identiﬁed and grouped into SSE packing clusters. Supplementary
Figure S1 illustrates the process of recognition of SSE packing clusters
from SSE interfaces and effective contact network. In brief, we ﬁrst se-
lected an SSE interface with a site having the biggest number of contacts
within the effective contact network as the initial SSE interface for a SSE
packing cluster. Next, the interfaces of SSEs having sites with over two

contacts with the initial SSE interface were included in the SSE packing
cluster. Then, the remaining SSE interfaces having sites with over two
contacts with all the sites in the SSE packing cluster were included. The
sites that do not belong to SSEs were also included in the SSE packing
cluster, if they have over two contacts with the SSE packing cluster. This
step continues until no such SSE interfaces were satisﬁed. If there remain
sites in the effective contact network, new SSE packing clusters could be
identiﬁed by following the above procedure. After all the SSE packing
clusters have been identiﬁed, they were further merged as follows: If the
number of contacts between two different SSE packing clusters exceeds
the number of sites in smaller SSE packing cluster, the smaller SSE
packing cluster was merged into the bigger one. These SSE packing clus-
ters of less than seven sites that could not be merged were not considered
in our analysis.

2.4 Structure comparison between SSE packing clusters
and identiﬁcation of SSE packing patterns

An SSE packing cluster identiﬁed is actually a cluster of sites that mediate
the association of SSEs. To compare the geometric similarity between two
SSE packing clusters, we ﬁrst reconstructed their intact structures by
including the structures of whole SSEs with an extension of one residue
at both ends. If there existed sites that do not belong to an SSE, the
structures of the extension of three residues at both sides were included.
Then a non-sequential structure alignment method named MICAN
(Minami et al., 2013) was used to compare the structures between two
SSE packing clusters. Based on pairwise structure alignment, SSE pack-
ing clusters derived from SCOP domains with similarity score TM-score
20.4 (a statistically signiﬁcant threshold for structural similarity) (Zhou
and Skolnick, 2007) were linked to form a network. Then, based on the
network, the complete-linkage clustering algorithm (Johnson, 1967) was
used to identify groups of SSE packing clusters with similar geometry.
Each group was regarded as an SSE packing pattern.

2.5 Conservation measurement of SSE packing clusters

The effect of substitution was used as an indicator for the degree of
conservation of SSE packing clusters. For a pair of domains belonging
to the same family, the structurally equivalent sites were derived by per-
forming MICAN structure alignment. Given a site pair, the substitution
effect between any two amino acids could be evaluated based on the
overall physicochemical similarity between them, ranging from 0 (dissimi-
lar) to 8 (identical), as described in the McLachlan matrix (McLachlan,
1971) (AAindex entry: MCLA710101). If the sites involved in SSE pack-
ing clusters are conservative, it was expected that they tended to substi-
tute similar amino acids; thus, the average score of substitutions, named
as conservation score, would be close to 8. The degree of conservation on
SSE packing clusters was further compared with that of other regions
within same domains.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Overview of the method for recognizing SSE packing
clusters

To explore the organization of domain architecture, we Viewed
an SSE as a combination of a main-chain scaffold and several
side-chain interfaces (Fig. 1A). For an a-helix, the deﬁnition of
its side-chain interfaces depends on the structural context it
locates in. Generally, the side chains of an a-hehx form two
panel-like interfaces, except that they form a cylindrical interface
when sitting inside a ,B-barrel (Fig. 1A). For a ,8-strand, the even-
numbered sites form one panel-like interface, and the odd-
numbered sites form the other interface. By decomposing an

SSE to a scaffold and several interfaces, the arrangement of
SSEs was regarded as interactions among different interfaces;
those interfaces in close contacts were identiﬁed as an SSE pack-
ing cluster. To effectively recognize the SSE packing clusters, we
ﬁrst constructed an effective contact network among side chains,
then identiﬁed those interfaces in dense contacts and further
decomposed domains into SSE packing clusters (Fig. 1B, see
Section 2 for details).

3.2 SSE packing clusters could be regarded as common
scaffolds for organization of domain architectures

In total, 17334 SSE packing clusters were derived from 9015
non-redundant domains of ASTRAL SCOP40 database (see
Section 2). Most domains (90.4%) contain one to three SSE
packing clusters, and only few domains can contain up to 11
SSE packing clusters (Fig. 2A and see Supplementary Table S1
for details). These SSE packing clusters mostly (77.8%) consist
of approximately two to eight regular SSEs (Supplementary Fig.
S2A), with a peak at ﬁve SSEs. The size of SSE packing clusters
(the number of residues) also exhibits a unimodal distribution
with the peak appearing in the range of 17—24 sites
(Supplementary Fig. S2B).

SSE packing cluster

 

Based on their geometric similarity, the 17 334 SSE packing
clusters were further clustered into 6497 classes, so called SSE
packing patterns (see Section 2). Among the 6497 SSE packing
patterns, 1160 SSE packing patterns contained two or more
packing clusters, which covered 69% (11997) of SSE packing
clusters. In SCOP, the 9015 domains could also be classiﬁed
into 1004 folds of distinct architecture. As the SSE packing pat-
terns derived from domains are more basic structural units, we
wondered whether they were able to capture organizational cor-
relation between folds of different architecture. Indeed, 576 of
1160 SSE packing patterns were found across different folds
(Fig. 2B). The most commonly used SSE packing pattern
spanned 582 domains across 158 different folds. If we connect
those pairs of folds sharing an SSE packing pattern, this will
result in a network of high connectivity in protein fold space
(see Supplementary Fig. S3 for details). Notably, >80% (837)
of the folds were involved in the network. Moreover, we
observed signiﬁcant amino acid patterns of at least ﬁve amino
acids (P<0.05) underlying the 21 SSE packing patterns with
>100 packing cluster members (see Supplementary Methods
and Supplementary Fig. S4 for details). Taken together, we
argue that SSE packing clusters as lower level structure units
than domains are common scaffolds for organization of
domain architectures.

3.3 SSE packing clusters correspond well to folding
nuclei in small protein domains

To ﬁnd out the potential roles of SSE packing clusters in domain
organization, a set of 14 small single-domain proteins, which
have been studied with detailed CID-value analysis, were retrieved
from literatures (see Supplementary Materials for details).
CID-value analysis is an experimental protein engineering method
used to study the structure of the folding transition state in small
protein domains that fold in a two-state manner (Fersht and
Sato, 2004; Ozkan et al., 2001). Using this method, point muta-
tions are performed and their effects are estimated by CID-values.
The CID-values obtained are generally grouped into low
(CD-value<0.1), medium (0.1 g CID-value<0.4) and high
(CD-value20.4) regions (Chiti et al., 1999). Usually, sites with
medium or high CID-value are possibly essential for the formation
of folding nucleus (Chiti et al., 1999).

There are 170 residues in the SSE packing clusters, namely 170
PC sites, identiﬁed from the 14 small single-domain proteins
with detailed CID-value analysis. Remarkably, 81.8% (139) of
them have either medium (89) or high CID-values (50) (Fig. 3A).
Further, the percentage of PC sites with medium/high CID-values
for each domain was calculated, and it was shown that most of
the PC sites possess medium/high CID-values in each domain, ran-
ging from 52 (ubiqutin) to 100% (FKBP12) (Fig. 3B andsee
Supplementary Table S2 for details). When comparing the loca-
tion of the PC sites of medium/high CID-values with those of low
CID-values, we found that PC sites with medium/high CID-values
located closer to the centroid of SSE packing clusters than
the PC sites with low CID-values (t—test, P< 0.05) (Fig. 3C).
Figure 3D—G showed the CID-values of PC sites in four represen-
tative proteins belonging to different structure classes: all-oz, all-,8
(,8—sheet and ,B-barrel) and 05/,8. Clearly, the PC sites with
medium/high CID-values (in purple and red) mainly sit in the

center of SSE packing clusters, whereas PC sites with low
CID-values (in blue) are scattered in the periphery. The high cor-
relation between the packing cluster and the folding nuclei as
determined by medium/high CID-values suggest the important
role of SSE packing cluster in formation of protein domains.

3.4 SSE packing clusters are more conserved within
domains

To further shed lights into the important role of SSE packing
clusters in domain organization, we looked into the conservation
of SSE packing clusters in the evolution of domains. Here we
selected 1437 pairs of domains, each of which belongs to the
same family. Based on the structure alignments of these
domain pairs, the conservation of SSE packing clusters could
be evaluated by measuring the substitution effects on the aligned
sites with McLanchlan matrix, and further compared with that
of other regions in domains (see Section 2 for details). Figure 4
shows the distributions of conservation score for SSE packing
clusters and other regions in domains. On average, the conser-
vation score for SSE packing clusters (5.0) is signiﬁcantly higher
than that for other regions (4.1) (t—test, P<2.2e-16). Similar
results were also observed when we attempted another two dif-
ferent amino acid substitution matrices, BLOSUM62 matrix
(Henikoff and Henikoff, 1992) and CSSM matrices (context-
speciﬁc amino acid substitution matrices) (Goonesekere and
Lee, 2008) (Supplementary Fig. S5). The higher degree of con-
servation for SSE packing clusters further indicates their import-
ant role in domain organization.

3.5 Case study: implication of SSE packing clusters of
kinase domains in human diseases

Kinases are essential enzymes in human proteome, which phos-
phorylate the serine, threonine or tyrosine residues of target pro-
teins with phosphate groups from ATP. It is estimated that up to
30% of human proteins are modiﬁed by kinases (Hubbard and
Cohen, 1993). Thus, mutations on kinases could underlie many
human diseases, such as developmental and metabolic disorders,
as well as certain cancers (Lahiry et al., 2010). To shed lights into
the roles of SSE packing clusters of kinase domains in human
diseases, we collected 729 disease-related mutations for 16 kinase
catalytic domains with high-resolution crystal structures (see
Supplementary Materials for details).

We ﬁrst identiﬁed SSE packing clusters from the 16 kinase
domains, and it was found that kinase domains usually con-
tained two SSE packing clusters of different size: the bigger
one corresponds to the C-terminal lobe of kinase domain, and
the smaller one corresponds to the N-terminal lobe (Fig. 5A).
Further, we investigated the overlap between the catalytic re-
gions and SSE packing clusters of kinase domains. Previous
studies have identiﬁed ﬁve functional elements or subdomains
as catalytic regions for kinases (Hanks and Hunter, 1995),
namely SD I (P-loop, ATP-binding loop), SD III (or C-helix),
SD VIB (catalytic loop), SD VII (activation loop) and SD VIII
(P + 1 loop) (Fig. 5A). On average, of 1791 sites involved in the
SSE packing clusters, 28.9% are found to locate at the catalytic
regions; reversely, of 1472 sites belonging to the catalytic regions,
35.6% are found to participate in the formation of the SSE

packing clusters (Supplementary Table S3). Such a moderate
overlap suggests that the catalytic regions and the scaffolds of
the kinase domain are distinct, but with close spatial relationship.
For example, in ACVRLl kinase domain, SD VIB (catalytic
loop), SD VII (activation loop) and SD VIII (P + 1 loop) were
linked to the C-terminal SSE packing cluster; and SD I (P-loop)
and SD III (or C-helix) were supported by the N-terminal SSE
packing cluster (Fig. 5A).

Then, we looked into the distribution of the 729 disease-
related mutations on these kinase domains. Only 281 were dir-
ectly involved in kinase activity as they occur on the catalytic
regions. But how the remaining 448 mutations affect kinase ac-
tivity is unclear. Remarkably, we found that 213 disease-related
mutations occurred in the packing clusters, indicating that the

SSE packing clusters as scaffolds for kinase domains accounted
for many disease-related mutations in kinase. Notably, for some
kinase domains, such as ACVRLl kinase domain and BTK
kinase domain, the disease-related mutations are signiﬁcantly
enriched in packing cluster regions compared with that of
other regions in domains (Fig. 5B, see Supplementary Table S4
for details).

In this study, through recognition of interfaces mediating SSE
packing, we have attempted to identify the structural and physi-
cochemical features underlying the organization of domain archi-
tecture. The packing clusters identiﬁed not only depicted the

arrangement of structure elements in domain architecture, but
could also capture the underlying residues mediating SSE pack-
ing patterns in domain formation.

Previously, hydrophobic cores have been analyzed within do-
mains (Alexeevski et al., 2003; Swindells, 1995; Zehfus, 1995).
We compared the structure model for recognition of hydro-
phobic core (left panel of Supplementary Fig. S6A) with that
for identiﬁcation of SSE packing clusters (right panel of
Supplementary Fig. S6A). A hydrophobic core usually consists

While in SSE packing clusters, only the residue pairs in effect
contact are considered (see Section 2) and thus the hydrophobic
residues involved are less densely packed (comparing left and

right panels of Supplementary Fig. S6B). Moreover, as shown
in Supplementary Figure S6C, for a protein domain with com-
plex architecture, SSE packing clusters can give a better struc-
tural delineation than hydrophobic cores do.

There arose an interesting phenomenon, when domain archi-
tectures were decomposed into SSE packing clusters. It was
found that >80% of domains of different folds in SCOP could
be related by sharing at least one SSE packing pattern, result-
ing in a high-connectivity network in protein fold space
(Supplementary Fig. S3). The SSE packing clusters could also
be derived based on CATH database, and we found that the
recognition of SSE packing clusters is not drastically affected
by different domain assign algorithm (see Supplementary
Results for details). So, what puzzles us is why the SSE packing
patterns are commonly shared among domains of different fold.
Because the domains of different folds usually originate from
different ancestors and perform different functions, the sharing
of SSE packing clusters across domains of different fold could
indicate the important role of physical constraints rather than
evolutionary or functional constraints on formation of SSE
packing clusters as common structural scaffolds.

Furthermore, we observed a high correlation between the SSE
packing clusters and the folding nuclei for single-domain pro-
teins. As most of the small single-domain proteins used in this
study was found to fold via a nucleation-condensation mechan-
ism (Nolting and Agard, 2008; Wetlaufer, 1973), several key resi-
dues would form a folding nucleus that serves as a scaffold for
directing the rapid folding of the whole domain. The good cor-
respondence between SSE packing clusters identiﬁed and folding
nuclei for these single-domain proteins suggest the important
roles of the SSE packing clusters in initiating folding and orga-
nizing structure elements. Moreover, through investigation of the
distribution of 729 disease-related mutations on 16 different

kinase domains, it was observed that SSE packing clusters could
account for ~29.2% (213 of 729) of previously reported disease-
related mutations on kinases. The association between SSE pack-
ing clusters and diseases reinforces the importance of SSE pack-
ing clusters in domain organization not only in terms of
structural scaffolds but also in terms of functionality.

5 CONCLUSION

In this work, by considering the SSE interfaces as the basic inter-
action units for the packing of SSEs, we developed a new descrip-
tor named SSE packing cluster to characterize domains of
different fold. Moreover, our analysis showed that SSE packing
clusters were more conserved in domain architectures and corres-
ponded well with folding nuclei in small single-domain proteins.
Therefore, SSE packing clusters could be regarded as common
structural scaffolds underlying the diverse protein structure space.

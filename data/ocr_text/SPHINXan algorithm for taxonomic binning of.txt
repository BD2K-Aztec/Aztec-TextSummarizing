ABSTRACT

Motivation: Compared with composition-based binning algorithms,
the binning accuracy and specificity of alignment-based binning
algorithms is significantly higher. However, being alignment-based,
the latter class of algorithms require enormous amount of time
and computing resources for binning huge metagenomic datasets.
The motivation was to develop a binning approach that can
analyze metagenomic datasets as rapidly as composition-based
approaches, but nevertheless has the accuracy and specificity of
alignment-based algorithms. This article describes a hybrid binning
approach (SPHINX) that achieves high binning efficiency by utilizing
the principles of both ’composition’- and ’alignment’-based binning
algorithms.

Results: Validation results with simulated sequence datasets
indicate that SPHINX is able to analyze metagenomic sequences as
rapidly as composition-based algorithms. Furthermore, the binning
efficiency (in terms of accuracy and specificity of assignments) of
SPHINX is observed to be comparable with results obtained using
alignment-based algorithms.

1 INTRODUCTION

The enormous microbial diversity prevalent in natural ecosystems
represents a rich resource for discovery of hitherto unknown
microbes and the novel genes/proteins they encompass. Estimates
reveal that 99% of these microbes cannot be easily cultured
in the laboratory (Amann et al., 1995). The rapidly growing
ﬁeld of metagenomics directly investigates this microbial diversity
by obtaining and sequencing the entire genomic content present
in any given environmental sample (Hugenholtz, 2002; Rappe
and Giovannoni, 2003). Since majority of these organisms in
environmental samples belong to hitherto unknown taxonomic
groups, one of the biggest challenges for computational biologists
is not only just to catalog the known organisms, but also to identify

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

and characterize new organisms belonging to known or unknown
taxonomic groups. These organisms could belong to an entirely new
species or genus or family or order or class or even a new phylum.

Researchers typically catalog taxonomic diversity (a process
referred to as ‘binning’) by using computational methods that
identify the taxonomic afﬁliation of all the sequences obtained
from a given environmental sample. Sequences sharing the same
taxonomic label are subsequently grouped (binned) together.
Accurate binning of metagenomic sequences is a crucial step in
any metagenomics project since wrongly binned sequences will
affect/hinder in the downstream analysis of many subsequent
steps, such as sequence assembly, gene prediction and functional
annotation, etc. Existing binning algorithms assign a sequence
to a particular taxon/clade if ‘features’ of the sequence are
‘similar’ to sequence(s) belonging to that taxon/clade. The extent
to which these ‘features’ are ‘similar’ determines not only the
accuracy, but also the speciﬁcity of assignment (the taxonomic
level at which the sequence is assigned). Besides, binning methods
are challenged by sequences generated by current sequencing
technologies, such as 454 (Margulies et al., 2005) and Illumina.
The short lengths of sequences (35—100bp) produced using these
sequencing technologies make it difﬁcult to identify ‘features’ which
are similar between sequences from closely related organisms and
are distinct from those from distant organisms.

One class of ‘features’ used by binning algorithms is based on the
similarity of the ‘compositional’ characteristics of the query and the
target sequences. A few examples of ‘composition—based’ binning
algorithms published in recent years include Phylopythia (McHardy
et al., 2007), TACOA (Diaz et al., 2009) and PhymmBL (Brady and
Salzberg, 2009). Phylopythia (McHardy et al., 2007) utilizes support
vector machines and uses oligonucleotide frequencies as training
features to initially build organism/clade—speciﬁc classiﬁers. These
classiﬁers are subsequently used for assigning a query sequence
to an organism/clade whose genome(s) is/are most similar to the
query (with respect to oligonucleotide usage). However, SVM—based
classiﬁers used by Phylopythia are not robust enough to predict
the taxonomic labels of ‘short’ query sequences having lengths
< 1000 bp. As a result, in addition to most of the ‘short’ sequences
remaining unclassiﬁed, this method has a high misclassiﬁcation rate.
Another composition—based binning algorithm, namely TACOA,
also uses oligonucleotide frequencies as features for building
organism—speciﬁc models (Diaz et al., 2009). Based on the GC
content of a genome, TACOA builds a genome model, represented in
the form of a vector. The elements of these vectors contain the ratio

of observed and the expected frequencies of all possible nucleotide
oligomers (of kmer sizes 4 and 5). TACOA employs a modiﬁed
k—nearest neighbor (k—NN) approach during the prediction phase,
wherein the vector corresponding to the query sequence is scored not
only against the neighboring vectors of the highest scoring model,
but also against the complete set of (precomputed) genome models.
The ﬁnal assignment of a query sequence to a taxa/clade is based on
the pattern of the obtained scores. Although TACOA outperforms
Phylopythia, majority of the ‘short’ query sequences are assigned
at non—speciﬁc taxonomic levels such as super—kingdom by this
method (Diaz et al., 2009). Thus, this method has limited utility
since it prevents end—users from assessing the taxonomic diversity
of samples at ﬁner taxonomic levels. For example, sequences from
two samples may be very similar at a higher taxonomic level, e. g.
phylum, but may have sequences belonging to two entirely different
classes within that phylum. The recently published Phymm binning
algorithm (Brady and Salzberg, 2009) computes variable length
oligonucleotide frequencies and generates interpolated Markov
models (IMMs) for each genome. Subsequently, it scores a given
query sequence against all precomputed organism—speciﬁc models,
and assigns the query to an organism that corresponds to the
highest scoring model. Phymm assigns all query sequences at the
taxonomic level of strain, irrespective of the value of the obtained
(highest) score. The end—users then need to interpret the score and
appropriately reduce individual query assignments to corresponding
higher taxonomic levels. However, the absence of a linear correlation
between the score and the correct taxonomic level of the predicted
assignment makes this task difﬁcult. In principle, reducing the
taxonomic level of all predicted assignments to higher taxonomic
levels (such as phylum or super—kingdom) would result in high
accuracy. However, the utility of assignments at such non—speciﬁc
taxonomic levels is limited.

The other class of binning algorithms uses ‘sequence similarity’
as a ‘feature’ to assign a query sequence to an organism/clade
(Huson et al., 2007; Krause et al., 2008; Monzoorul et al.,
2009). These algorithms, referred to as ‘alignment—based’ binning
algorithms, follow a two—phase approach. In the ﬁrst phase, an
alignment algorithm such as BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997), is
used for comparing each query sequence in a given metagenomic
sample with all target sequences present in a reference database.
Subsequently, in the second phase, the pattern and quality of the
generated BLAST hits are analyzed, and information from this
analysis is utilized for ﬁnally assigning each query sequence to
an organism/clade. Given the robustness of the existing alignment
algorithms (BLAST), alignment—based binning algorithms are
observed to have greater binning accuracy and speciﬁcity as
compared with existing composition—based methods. However, the
ﬁrst phase of alignment—based binning algorithms represents a
major bottleneck since enormous amount of time and computing
resources are needed for generating alignments of each of the
sequences in a given metagenome with sequences present in the
existing reference database, such as nr (presently containing more
than 9 million sequences). Thus, one of the challenges is to
develop binning approaches whose performance efﬁciency in terms
of taxonomic assignments is not only comparable with that of
alignment—based approaches, but also have improved efﬁciency in
terms of computational time required for taxonomic assignment.

In this article, we present SPHINX, a hybrid binning approach
that aims at reducing the overall time taken by alignment—based

binning approaches by approximately an order of magnitude. The
approach is termed as ‘hybrid’ since it utilizes both ‘compositional’
and ‘similarity’ features of the query sequence during the binning
process. Binning of sequences by SPHINX involves three steps. In
the ﬁrst step, ‘compositional’ features of the query sequence are
utilized to identify a small subset of sequences (in the reference
database), which are similar in composition to the query sequence.
The second step uses BLAST to perform a ‘similarity’ search of the
query sequence against this small subset of database sequences. In
the ﬁnal step, the output of these BLAST searches is analyzed, and
the query is assigned to a taxon/clade with which ‘signiﬁcant’ hits
were obtained.

2 METHODS

2.1 Clustering reference database sequences

Clustering sequences present in the reference database based on the
compositional characteristics is the only preprocessing step in SPHINX.
For this purpose, ffn ﬁles (which contain only protein—coding gene
sequences) corresponding to 952 completely sequenced prokaryotic genomes
were downloaded from NCBI (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Bacteria/).
Frequencies of all possible tetra—nucleotides in each coding sequence were
computed and stored as a 256—dimensional vector. Tetra—nucleotides were
used since previous observations had demonstrated that tetra—nucleotide
frequencies carry an inherent taxonomic signal (Pride et al., 2003). Using
k—means clustering approach (Hartigan and Wong, 1979), more than 1.9
million vectors corresponding to the coding sequences were clustered.
The Manhattan distance (L1 norm) between individual vectors was used
as the similarity criterion for clustering. Once the clustering process
was completed, individual cluster centroids were computed and stored.
Subsequently, coding sequences tagged to each cluster were translated into
protein sequences (using the appropriate genetic code). These translated
sequences resulting from each cluster were stored as separate databases.
A schematic workﬂow depicting the preprocessing steps (described above)
is given in Supplementary Figure 1.

2.2 Steps for taxonomic assignment

The following three steps were followed by SPHINX for identifying the
taxon/clade to which a query sequence belongs. A schematic workﬂow
depicting these three steps is given in Supplementary Figure 2.

2.2.] Step a—reduction of search space A vector representing the
frequencies of all 256 tetra—nucleotides in the query sequence was generated.
The distance of this query vector to each ‘cluster centroid’ was computed
and the cluster having the least distance to the query vector was identiﬁed.

2.2.2 Step b—identiﬁcation of similar sequence from the reduced space A
BLASTx search of the query sequence was performed against all translated
sequences present in the identiﬁed cluster.

2.2.3 Step c—taxonomic assignment of sequences Alignment parameters
(bit—score, alignment length, identities and positives), organism name and the
alignment subsequences from each hit were parsed from the BLASTx output
obtained in Step b. Using an approach similar to SOrt—ITEMS (Monzoorul
et al., 2009), each query sequence was ﬁnally assigned to a taxon/clade based
on the quality of alignment and the degree of orthology observed between
the query and the hit sequences.

2.3 Validation of the SPHINX approach on simulated
metagenomic datasets

The performance of binning methods is usually validated using a ‘leave one
(species) out’ strategy, wherein sequences belonging to only a single species

are removed from the reference database. Subsequently, test sequences
derived from the removed species are queried against this modiﬁed database.
This strategy is intended to simulate a scenario of only one ‘unknown’ (new)
species being present in the metagenomic sample. However, in this study,
a ‘leave one clade out’ strategy was adopted, wherein sequences belonging
to an entire clade (genus, family, order, class and phylum) were removed
from the reference database. Subsequently, test sequences originating from
genomes belonging to the removed clades were queried against this modiﬁed
database. This strategy was adopted to closely mimic sequences derived
from a real metagenomic scenario, wherein majority of sequences belong to
entirely hitherto unknown (new) clades at various taxonomic levels.

2.3.] Generation of a simulated reference database For creating a
simulated database scenario, coding sequences corresponding to 300
randomly selected genomes (out of 952) were removed before creating
clusters for the reference database. Tracing the taxonomic lineage of these
300 genomes revealed the complete removal of certain clades (species,
genera, families, orders, classes and phyla) from the reference database.
Supplementary Table 1 lists the 300 genomes that were not considered while
clustering the reference database.

2.3.2 Test datasets used for validation Validation of the SPHINX
approach was performed using 140000 test sequences of varying lengths.
These test sequences were generated using MetaSim (Richter et al., 2008).
Supplementary Table 2 lists the genomes from which these test sequences
were derived. To mimic a typical metagenomic scenario, 1 32 000 (94.2%)
of these test sequences were derived from genomes belonging to those
clades that were removed while creating the reference database. Based
on the lengths of the read sequences, these test sequences were divided
into four validation datasets, termed as Sanger dataset, 454—400 dataset,
454—250 dataset, 454—100 dataset, each containing 35 000 sequences. Test
sequences constituting these four datasets simulated the typical sequence
lengths and errors models obtained from the four commonly used sequencing
technologies, namely, Sanger (read length centered around 800 bp), 454—GS—
FLX—Titanium (400 bp), 454—GS—FLX—Standard (250 bp) and Roche—454—
GS20 (100 bp), respectively. Taxonomic assignments of sequences in all four
datasets were carried out following the steps described in Section 2.2.

2.3.3 Categorization of taxonomic assignments Taxonomic assignments
obtained with SPHINX were categorized as ‘correct/incorrect’ using the
following approach. Taxonomic assignment of query sequences to either
the taxa corresponding to their source organism, or to taxa that lie in the
path between the root to the taxa corresponding to the source organism of
the query sequence were categorized as ‘correct’. Assignments of sequences
to taxa that did not lie in the path from the root to the taxon corresponding
to the respective source organism of the query sequence were categorized
as ‘wrong’. For example, query sequences from Burkholderia ambifaria
AMMD, which were not assigned to any of the taxa mentioned below were
categorized as ‘wrong’:

root; cellular organisms; Bacteria; Proteobacteria; Betaproteobacteria;
Burkholderiales; Burkholderiaceae; Burkholderia; Burkholderia cepacia
complex; Burkholderia ambifaria; Burkholderia ambifaria AMMD.

To evaluate the performance of SPHINX in terms of speciﬁcity of
assignments, the percentage of query sequences ‘correctly’ assigned at
the taxonomic levels of phylum or below were considered as ‘speciﬁc’
assignments. A binning algorithm with high speciﬁcity is expected to assign
more number of sequences at ‘speciﬁc’ levels.

2.3.4 Comparison with other methods The results obtained with SPHINX
were compared with those obtained with two alignment—based methods,
namely SOrt—ITEMS (Monzoorul et al., 2009) and MEGAN (Huson et al.,
2007). Results were also compared with those obtained with a composition—
based method, namely TACOA (Diaz et al., 2009). All three programs
were run with default parameters. In order to accurately compare the effect

of database clustering on binning time and binning efﬁciency, results of
SOrt—ITEMS and MEGAN were obtained by performing similarity searches
against the same (translated) ffn database (used for validating SPHINX), but
in an unclustered format. Similarly, taxonomic assignments were obtained
with TACOA using a modiﬁed database containing only those genomes that
were present in the databases used by SPHINX, SOrt—ITEMS and MEGAN
during their validation process.

For various assignment categories, the overlap between the sequence
assignments by SPHINX, SOrt—ITEMS, MEGAN and TACOA were
analyzed.

2.4 Validation of the SPHINX approach on a real
metagenomic dataset

The performance of SPHINX was validated on sequences belonging to the
hyper—saline saltem metagenome (Dinsdale et al., 2008). This relatively
small metagenomic dataset (with only 35 446 sequences) was chosen since
it enabled a quick comparison of taxonomic assignment patterns obtained
using various binning methods. Results obtained with this dataset, would also
indicate the suitability of SPHINX for use with much bigger metagenomic
datasets.

Taxonomic assignments for the 35 446 sequences constituting this
dataset were ﬁrst obtained using SPHINX. A database (in clustered
format) consisting of coding sequences belonging to completely sequenced
prokaryotic genomes was used during the binning process. Taxonomic
assignments of all sequences were also obtained using SOrt—ITEMS and
MEGAN. Assignments obtained by all three methods were then compared
at the level of phylum, class and order. For this purpose, assignments obtained
at or below the desired taxonomic level of comparison were ﬁrst collapsed
to that level and subsequently enumerated.

2.5 Testing of the SPHINX approach on mouse gut
metagenomic sequences

The performance of SPHINX was tested on the metagenome datasets
corresponding to the gut from lean and obese mice, which were previously
analyzed by Tumbaugh et al. (2006). In contrast to the hyper—saline saltem
metagenome, the two datasets of the mouse gut metagenome represented
a typical metagenomic dataset in terms of sheer volume and taxonomic
complexity. Analysis of such a huge and complex dataset would help
in evaluating the performance of SPHINX in a real—world data scale—up
scenario.

The two datasets (hereafter referred to as lean and obese dataset),
consisting of 1057022 and 687 244 sequences from the lean and the
obese mouse gut, respectively, were analyzed using SPHINX. Taxonomic
assignments by SPHINX for both datasets were compared at the level of
phylum, class, order and family in the following manner. All assignments
obtained at or below the desired taxonomic level of comparison were ﬁrst
collapsed to that level and subsequently enumerated. For each desired
taxonomic level, a 2x2 contingency matrix (for that taxon) was then
generated using the approach described by White et al. (2009). The
cumulative number of assignments obtained for that taxa in both datasets
and the total number of assignments at or below that taxonomic level in
both datasets were used for generating the matrix. A chi—square test was
subsequently performed on this contingency matrix. Based on the results
of the test, taxa (having more than 1000 assigned sequences) showing a
statistically signiﬁcant difference were identiﬁed.

2.6 Assessing the impact of non-coding regions on
binning efﬁciency

The efﬁciency of alignment—based binning algorithms is expected to differ,

when test sequences are queried against a reference database which contains

sequences originating from not only coding regions but also sequences

from the non—coding regions of known genomes. In order to study the

SPHINX

 

impact/contribution of non—coding regions on binning efﬁciency of SPHINX,
a simulated database was created in the following manner. All completely
sequenced genomes from NCBI were downloaded, and each genome was
dissected into lkb fragments. Using the same steps described in Section 2.1,
these fragments were clustered using k—means approach, followed by
computation of cluster centroids and ﬁnally storing of translated sequences
belonging to each cluster into separate databases. For the purpose of
comparing the results of this approach with other methods, sequence
fragments obtained from the same 300 randomly selected genomes were
not considered while clustering and subsequently creating the database. The
performance of SPHINX was evaluated with this simulated database variant.

3 RESULTS

The summarized binning results obtained with SPHINX, SOrt—
ITEMS, MEGAN and TACOA (for all four validation datasets) are
given in Supplementary Table 3. A graphical representation of these
results is illustrated in Figure 1. As mentioned previously, these
results were generated using the ffn database in clustered (SPHINX)
and unclustered formats (SOrt—ITEMS, MEGAN and TACOA).
The results of SPHINX, SOrt—ITEMS and MEGAN obtained
with ffn database are referred to as results with ‘SPHINX—FFN’,
‘SOrt—ITEMS—FFN’ and ‘MEGAN—FFN’, respectively. Results of
SPHINX obtained using a reference database containing both
coding and non—coding regions are referred to as results with
‘SPHINX—FNA’ .

3.1 Impact of database clustering on binning time and
binning efﬁciency

Supplementary Table 3 shows a comparison of results obtained with
SPHINX, SOrt—ITEMS, MEGAN and TACOA. These results are
discussed below.

3.1.] Correct assignments As expected, the percentage of correct
assignments (by all four methods) shows a progressive increase
as the length of the query sequence increases from 100 to 800 bp
(Fig. 1). The percentage of correct assignments by SPHINX—FFN is
slightly less (by 2—10%) as compared with SOrt—ITEMS—FFN for all
the datasets. This indicates that the ‘reduced search—space’ (database
clustering) strategy used by SPHINX does not have a signiﬁcant
impact on binning accuracy. At the same time, this reduced search
space strategy of SPHINX helps in achieving a 15— to 20—fold
reduction in the overall time taken for binning (Table 1).

Furthermore, it is also observed that the number of sequences
correctly classiﬁed by SPHINX—FFN is 1.2—1.9 times higher as
compared with that by MEGAN—FFN. This is expected, since
MEGAN uses only a single alignment parameter (bit—score) to
judge the quality of hits in BLASTx outputs and subsequently
assigns sequences using the least common ancestor (LCA) approach.
Adopting this approach was earlier shown to be associated with a
high misclassiﬁcation rate, especially in a metagenomic scenario,
wherein majority of sequences originate from hitherto unknown
organisms/taxonomic clades (Monzoorul et al., 2009).

Though the percentage of correct assignments by SPHINX—FFN
is seen to be comparable with a composition—based binning method
like TACOA, it is observed that a majority of the correct assignments
(85—90%) by TACOA are at the level of super—kingdom. The
assignments made at such non—speciﬁc levels have limited utility.

assignment categories are given on the x—axis, the scale on the y—axis denotes
the percentage of sequences assigned. (Database—variant FFN contains
coding sequences from completely sequenced genomes)

3.1.2 Speciﬁc assignments As in the case of correct assignments,
the percentage of correct assignments at speciﬁc levels (i.e.
assignments at the taxonomic level of phylum or below) increases
with increasing length of the query sequences (Fig. 1). It is seen
that SPHINX—FFN, SOrt—ITEMS—FFN and MEGAN—FFN assign
76—80% of the correct assignments at speciﬁc levels, indicating that
the reduced space strategy does not signiﬁcantly affect the binning
speciﬁcity. The only exception to this pattern is observed in the
454—100 dataset, where SPHINX—FFN is able to assign 64% of
correctly assigned sequences at speciﬁc levels. On the other hand, it
is observed that < 14% of query sequences are assigned by TACOA
at speciﬁc taxonomic levels. This demonstrates (and conﬁrms) the
high binning speciﬁcity of alignment—based binning approaches.

Supplementary Table 3 gives a breakup of speciﬁc assignments
by all four methods at various taxonomic levels, namely, phylum,
class, order, family, genus and below. These results indicate that,
in most datasets, SPHINX assigns a relatively higher percentage
of sequences at phylum level as compared with that by SOrt—
ITEMS, MEGAN and TACOA. No clear pattern can be established
between the results of SPHINX, MEGAN and TACOA at the class
level. However, it is observed that SPHINX assigns a relatively
lower percentage of sequences at class level compared with SOrt—
ITEMS. Though it is observed that SPHINX and SOrt—ITEMS
do not assign any sequences at order level, very few sequences
(0.4—4%) are assigned by MEGAN and TACOA at this level.
Furthermore, the percentage of sequences assigned by SPHINX at
family level is consistently higher than that by MEGAN and TACOA
at this level. Furthermore, the percentage of sequences assigned by
SPHINX at family level is consistently higher than that by MEGAN
and TACOA. However, the percentage of sequences assigned by
SPHINX at this level is relatively lower (0.4—7 %) than that by SOrt—
ITEMS. At the taxonomic level of genus and below, it is seen that
the percentage of assignments by SPHINX is comparable with that
by SOrt—ITEMS and MEGAN.

However, SPHINX assigns a signiﬁcantly higher percentage of
sequences at this level as compared with TACOA (in all four
datasets). In addition to the above observations, the percentage of
assignments by SPHINX at non—speciﬁc levels (above the level of
phylum) is observed to be consistently lower than that by SOrt—
ITEMS and MEGAN (in three out of four datasets) and TACOA (in
all four datasets). This further indicates that the reduced search space
approach of SPHINX does not impact the speciﬁcity of assignments.

3.1.3 Wrong assignments Only 5—12% of query sequences are
incorrectly assigned by SPHINX—FFN (Fig. 1). This is comparable
with the percentage of sequences (4—10%) incorrectly assigned by
SOrt—ITEMS—FFN. This further indicates that the reduced space
strategy adopted by SPHINX does not signiﬁcantly affect the
accuracy of binning. In comparison, a much higher percentage of
sequences are misclassiﬁed by TACOA (22—31%) and MEGAN
(23—35%).

3.1.4 Unassigned As seen from Figure 1, the percentage of query
sequences categorized as unassigned increases with decreasing
length of the query sequences. Though, the number of unassigned

sequences is slightly higher for SPHINX—FFN as compared with
SOrt—ITEMS—FFN and MEGAN—FFN in the cases of 454—250,
454—400 and Sanger datasets, it is interesting to note that in
the case of 454—100 validation dataset, the number of sequences
categorized as ‘unassigned’ by SPHINX—FFN is signiﬁcantly lower
than that of SOrt—ITEMS—FFN and MEGAN—FFN. The number of
sequences categorized as unassigned by TACOA is signiﬁcantly
lower than other binning methods. However, as observed above,
the assignments made by TACOA are of limited utility, since most
of these assignments are at super—kingdom level.

3.1.5 Pattern of overlap between sequence assignments by all four
binning methods Venn diagrams depicting the overlap between
the sequence assignments by SPHINX, SOrt—ITEMS, MEGAN
and TACOA (for various assignment categories) are given in
Supplementary Figure 4. Except for the 454—100 dataset, the
pattern of overlap for correctly assigned sequences indicates that
assignments by SPHINX and MEGAN form a subset of the
assignments by SOrt—ITEMS. For the 454—100 dataset, the correctly
assigned sequences by SOrt—ITEMS and MEGAN form a subset
of the correct assignments by SPHINX. Furthermore, the correct
assignments by TACOA are seen to have a partial overlap with
the correct assignments by other three methods. However, all the
additional sequences correctly classiﬁed by TACOA (in comparison
with the other three methods) are observed to be classiﬁed at non—
speciﬁc taxonomic levels. The overlap between the non—speciﬁc
sequence assignments by all four methods also indicates that a
high proportion of correct assignments by TACOA are classiﬁed
at non—speciﬁc levels.

For all datasets, a clear pattern of overlap is observed between the
assignments at ‘speciﬁc levels’ by all four methods (Supplementary
Fig. 4). SOrt—ITEMS is seen to have the highest set of speciﬁc
assignments. The speciﬁc assignments of SPHINX, MEGAN and
TACOA are seen to form progressively smaller subsets within the
set of speciﬁc sequences of SOrt—ITEMS. In contrast, for the wrong
assignments category, the set of sequences misclassiﬁed by SPHINX
and SOrt—ITEMS are seen to form small subsets within the set of
sequences misclassiﬁed by MEGAN and TACOA.

The pattern of overlap seen for the set of unassigned sequences by
all four methods (Supplementary Fig. 4) indicates the following. For
the 454—100 dataset, the set of unassigned sequences by SPHINX
and TACOA are seen to form a subset of the unassigned sequences
by SOrt—ITEMS. In contrast, for the other three datasets, sequences
categorized as ‘unassigned’ by SOrt—ITEMS, MEGAN and TACOA
are observed to form progressively smaller subsets within the set of
sequences categorized by SPHINX as ‘unassigned’.

3.2 Impact of non-coding regions on binning efﬁciency

The results obtained with both variants of SPHINX (FFN and the
FNA variants) are graphically illustrated in Figure 2. Supplementary
Table 3 gives a comparison of results (at various taxonomic levels)
obtained by the two variants of SPHINX with those obtained using
SOrt—ITEMS—FFN, MEGAN—FFN and TACOA. Results indicate
that 54—74% of sequences in test datasets are correctly assigned
by SPHINX—FNA as compared with 37—70% by SPHINX—FFN.
Interestingly, for datasets containing short query sequences
(100 bp), using the SPHINX—FNA variant (that performs searches
against a database that contains fragments originating from both

coding and non—coding regions), results in a noticeably higher
percentage of correct assignments (54%) as compared with the
SPHINX—FFN variant (37%). This is probably due to the fact
that some of the assigned query sequences in the 454—100 dataset
may have originated partially/entirely from non—coding regions.
However, as the length of the query sequences increases, it is
observed that the difference between the percentage of correct
assignments by both variants of SPHINX becomes smaller.

For both variants of SPHINX (except for the 454—100 dataset),
it is observed that the percentage of speciﬁc assignments out of
the correctly assigned sequences ranges between 69% and 80%.
Furthermore, the difference between the percentage of wrong
assignments by both variants of SPHINX ranges between 0.33%
and 2.25%. This indicates that for datasets containing sequences
having lengths 2250 bp, the inclusion of the non—coding regions in
the reference database does not signiﬁcantly alter the accuracy and
speciﬁcity of binning. It is also seen that the inclusion of the non—
coding regions in the database increases the overall time taken for
binning by three to four times (Table 1). The increase in time for FFN
datasets is due to the added volume of the non—coding sequences in
the database. Based on the above observations, it can be concluded
that it is optimal to use the SPHINX—FNA variant only in cases of
datasets containing short sequences. It is also important to note that
the binning time of both variants of SPHINX increases linearly with
increase in the size of the datasets (Supplementary Table 5).

3.3 Validation results of SPHINX for hyper-saline
saltern metagenomic dataset

A comparison of the total numbers and the cumulative percentage
of sequences (in the hyper—saline saltem metagenomic dataset)
assigned at phylum, class and order levels by SPHINX—FFN,
SOrt—ITEMS—FFN and MEGAN—FFN is shown in Table 2.

Results in Table 2 indicate that SPHINX is able to assign 48.6%
of the sequences in the hyper—saline saltem metagenomic dataset.
This is roughly similar to the percentage of sequences assigned
by SOrt—ITEMS—FFN (49.9%) and MEGAN—FFN (50.5%). For
SPHINX, it is also observed that 15 773 (i.e. 91.6%) of the assigned
sequences (17 227) are at taxonomic levels of phylum or below. A
similar pattern is also seen for SOrt—ITEMS (93.8%) and MEGAN
(89.7%). Furthermore, it is observed that a majority (98.3—99.64%)
of assignments (by all three alignment—based methods) are to
microbial species belonging to two orders, namely Halobacteriales
and Sphingobacteriales. This observation is in conformance with
earlier reports which indicated the over abundance of these two
orders in hyper—saline environments (Dinsdale et al., 2008; Willner
et al., 2009). Further, all three methods show a similar pattern of
taxonomic assignments at all taxonomic levels (Table 2). These
observations reafﬁrm that the ‘reduced search—space’ strategy used
by SPHINX does not have a signiﬁcant impact on binning accuracy
and speciﬁcity. The binning efﬁciency of SPHINX is further
highlighted by the fact that SPHINX takes only 88 min to analyze
this dataset, as compared with >30h taken by SOrt—ITEMS and
MEGAN. For all the three methods, the execution time indicated
above includes the time taken for the BLASTx comparisons.

able to assign 54% (5 71 921 out of 1057022) and 41% (2 86 945

respectively (Supplementary Table 5A). Besides, in both datasets,
an examination of the BLAST hits revealed that alignments obtained
for approximately two—thirds of the assigned sequences were of poor
quality. Consequently, these sequences were assigned by SPHINX at
the taxonomic level of phylum. In contrast, only 0.2% of sequences
generated BLAST hits with alignments having identity values of
>90% and were subsequently assigned at the level of genus or
below. These observations indicate that the majority of sequences
in the mouse gut metagenome have originated from genomes of
hitherto unknown organisms. Table 3 provides a qualitative analysis

taxonomic levels, namely class, order and family, are given in
Supplementary Table 5B—D.

Analysis of assignments at the level of phylum indicates the
presence of organisms belonging to 24 and 23 phyla in the lean and
obese datasets, respectively (Table 3). Results with SPHINX indicate
that a signiﬁcantly higher percent of sequences in the obese dataset
are assigned to the phylum Firmicutes (23.7%) and Euryarchaeota
(6.6%), as compared with percentage of sequences assigned to
these phyla in the lean dataset (14.5 and 5.4%, respectively). In
contrast, the phylum Bacteroidetes is present in a signiﬁcantly higher
proportion in the lean dataset (6.9%) in comparison with that in the
obese dataset (4.8%). The above observations are in line with the
previous ﬁndings by Turnbaugh et al. (2006). In addition, results
of SPHINX indicate the new ﬁnding that most of the sequences
from the obese and the lean datasets are assigned to the phyla
Proteobacteria (49.4 and 43%), Actinobacteria (8.5 and 5.2%) and
Cyanobacteria (5.5 and 5.9%).

An analysis of assignments to various classes under each identiﬁed
phyla revealed interesting patterns of taxonomic diversity in lean
and obese datasets (Supplementary Table 5B). In the lean dataset,
5584 sequences are assigned to the class Actinobacteria, 1936
sequences to class Alphaproteobacteria, 1926 sequences to class
Betaproteobacteria and approximately 600—700 sequences each to
classes Chloroﬂexi, Spirochaetes and Methanomicrobia. In contrast,
none of the sequences in the obese dataset are assigned to any of
these classes. This observation could either be due to the complete
absence of organisms belonging to these classes in the obese dataset
or due to the presence of hitherto unknown organisms belonging to
these classes, the genomes of which have signiﬁcantly diverged from
the known organisms within these classes. Since sequences from

SPHINX

 

such diverged genomes will generate BLAST hits having extremely
weak alignment parameters, they are assigned by SPHINX either
at higher taxonomic levels (phylum or above) or are categorized
as unassigned. Similar to the pattern observed at the level of
phylum, while a signiﬁcantly higher proportion of sequences of
the lean dataset are assigned by SPHINX to class Bacteroidia
(belonging to phylum Bacteroidetes), the classes Clostridia and
Bacilli are present in signiﬁcantly higher proportion in the obese
dataset. Many sequences from both the lean and obese datasets
are assigned to classes Gammaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria
and Chlorobia. However, differences in the relative proportion of
sequences assigned to the latter classes in both datasets are not
statistically signiﬁcant.

Assignments at the levels of order and family also show
assignment patterns similar to those seen at the level of class. The
obese dataset is characterized by the conspicuous absence of many
orders/families which are present in the lean dataset (Supplementary
Table 5C—D).

It is to be noted that all inferences mentioned above were
based on similarity searches against a clustered sequence database
created using genomic fragments from 952 completely sequenced
prokaryotic genomes (available in the NCBI database at the time
of analysis). Though the overall pattern of taxonomic assignments
conﬁrm to those obtained in earlier studies (Tumbaugh et al., 2006),
these results are expected to improve as sequence information of
more and more genomes becomes available.

4 DISCUSSION

Current alignment—based binning methods depend on exhaustive
database searches. Performing such exhaustive database searches
for millions of sequences (present in typical metagenomic samples)
would take enormous amounts of time. This hinders research groups
having modest computational resources from using similarity—based
binning methods. The hybrid approach—SPHINX presented in this
article addresses this issue by adopting a ‘reduced search—space’
approach. Using this approach, SPHINX achieves a 15— to 20—fold
reduction in the time taken for binning, compared with other binning
approaches which depend on exhaustive database searches (Table 1).
On a single desktop with modest speciﬁcations (Intel Xeon quad
core, 4 GB RAM), SPHINX—FNA takes just about 88 h for binning
1.6 million sequences of the mouse gut metagenome. Binning the
same set of sequences using SPHINX—FFN would have further
reduced the time to an estimated 20—24 h without signiﬁcant loss in
accuracy and speciﬁcity. In contrast, exhaustive search approaches
(against the same database) would require an estimated 6 weeks
for completing the same task. Furthermore, validation results of
SPHINX obtained with simulated datasets indicate that the binning
efﬁciency of SPHINX matches those obtained with alignment—based
binning algorithms, which depend on the output of exhaustive
database searches (e. g. SOrt—ITEMS).

An examination of the results obtained for the same set of
sequences with different variants of databases indicate highest
binning efﬁciency (in terms of accuracy and speciﬁcity) with
the SPHINX—FNA database variant since it contains fragments
originating from both coding and non—coding regions (including
fragments spanning both these regions) of completely sequenced
genomes. However, results of SPHINX obtained with a database—
variant devoid of fragments spanning coding and non—coding regions

(referred to as SPHINX—C—NC in Supplementary Table 3) indicate
that using such a database variant results in an increase in taxonomic
assignments at non—speciﬁc levels, as well as, an increase in the
percentage of wrong assignments (as compared with the SPHINX—
FNA variant). These results show that the most optimal results are
obtained using the SPHINX—FNA database variant.

Since our observations with clustered and non—clustered variants
of the FFN database indicate no signiﬁcant loss in binning efﬁciency
using a reduced search—space strategy, it will be beneﬁcial to
adopt the latter strategy even for the nr database (which is more
comprehensive in terms of having sequences even from partially
characterized genomes in addition to sequences from completely
sequenced genomes). This will help in signiﬁcantly reducing the
overall time taken by alignment—based binning approaches.

The quality of reference database clusters is an important
factor that determines the binning speciﬁcity and accuracy of
the SPHINX algorithm. Though this study adopted the k—means
clustering approach, in principle, any other clustering method that
can efﬁciently segregate DNA sequences (of varying oligonucleotide
composition) in feature vector space can be applied to the current
workﬂow of SPHINX. The k—means clustering approach adopted
in the present study takes only about 4h on a simple desktop to
cluster approximately 1.9 million vectors corresponding to coding
sequences of 952 prokaryotic genomes. This includes the time taken
for generating all the vectors, as well as, for obtaining the vectors
corresponding to the cluster centroids.

The quality of the clustered reference database is also dependent
on the kmer size. A typical metagenomic sequence (obtained using
existing sequencing technologies) has a length <800—1000 bp.
For such short sequences, the taxonomic discrimination capability
achieved using lower kmer sizes is expected to be poor. On the other
hand, the frequencies of various oligonucleotides obtained using
large kmer sizes will be extremely low and statistically insigniﬁcant.
A kmer size of 4 was used in the current study since an earlier study
had demonstrated that tetra—nucleotide frequencies carry an inherent
taxonomic signal (Pride et al., 2003). However, using kmer size of 4
limits the applicability of the current method for obtaining reliable
taxonomic assignments for very short sequences, especially those
obtained from sequencing technologies such as Solexa and Illumina.

The binning efﬁciency of SPHINX also depends on the taxonomic
coverage of the clustered reference database. The clustered database
used in the current study contained sequences originating from 952
completely sequenced prokaryotic genomes. As more and more
genomes are being sequenced, updating the clustered database with
sequences from these genomes will help in improving the quality of
taxonomic assignments. Updating the clustered reference database
with sequences from these new genomes takes only a few minutes,
since the process only involves mapping the new sequences to
existing cluster centroids, and subsequently recomputing the cluster
centroids.

The clustered reference database used in the current study
contained sequences originating from prokaryotic genomes. In
principle, this database can be constructed using sequences from
other taxonomic domains, such as viruses or eukaryotes. However,
given that the information content in sequences originating from
non—coding regions (which form major portions of eukaryotic
genomes) does not conform to known patterns of taxonomic
hierarchy, extending the SPHINX approach to such sequences
will be a challenging task. It is also difﬁcult to bin sequences

originating from repetitive stretches (characteristic of eukaryotic
genomes) at speciﬁc taxonomic levels. This is due to the following
reason. Sequences originating from repetitive stretches will generate
hits with multiple sequences originating from taxa belonging to
diverse taxonomic clades. Since, it is difﬁcult to identify the
exact genome from which the query sequence has originated, such
sequences can be assigned only at high (non—speciﬁc) taxonomic
levels. An additional challenge will be to taxonomically characterize
metagenomic fragments containing overlapping reading frames,
known to be prevalent in viral and eukaryotic genomes.

In spite of the high accuracy and speciﬁcity of alignment—based
approaches, the percentage of metagenomic sequences classiﬁed
(by these approaches) either as ‘unassigned’ or at non—speciﬁc
taxonomic levels is still very high. This is due to the fact that many of
these sequences either do not generate alignments or generate poor
quality alignments with sequences in existing reference databases.
This is typical of sequences originating from organisms belonging
to novel (hitherto unknown) taxonomic clades. It will be desirable
if alignment—based approaches are complemented with methods that
facilitates meaningful grouping of such sequences.

5 CONCLUSION

Alignment—based binning algorithms are observed to have greater
binning accuracy and speciﬁcity as compared with existing
composition—based methods. In this article, we demonstrate
that adopting a reduced search space strategy enables one to
drastically reduce the overall time taken for alignment—based binning
approaches, with no signiﬁcant loss of binning efﬁciency. This
indicates the immense applicability of the proposed algorithm in
rapidly mapping the taxonomic diversity of large metagenomic
samples with high accuracy and speciﬁcity.

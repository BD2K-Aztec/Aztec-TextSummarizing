ABSTRACT

Motivation: Biological network comparison software largely relies on
the concept of alignment where close matches between the nodes of
two or more networks are sought. These node matches are based on
sequence similarity and/or interaction patterns. However, because of
the incomplete and error-prone datasets currently available, such
methods have had limited success. Moreover, the results of network
alignment are in general not amenable for distance-based evolutionary
analysis of sets of networks. In this article, we describe Netdis, a
topology-based distance measure between networks, which offers
the possibility of network phylogeny reconstruction.

Results: We first demonstrate that Netdis is able to correctly separate
different random graph model types independent of network size and
density. The biological applicability of the method is then shown by its
ability to build the correct phylogenetic tree of species based solely on
the topology of current protein interaction networks. Our results pro-
vide new evidence that the topology of protein interaction networks
contains information about evolutionary processes, despite the lack of
conservation of individual interactions. As Netdis is applicable to all
networks because of its speed and simplicity, we apply it to a large
collection of biological and non-biological networks where it clusters
diverse networks by type.

1 INTRODUCTION

The ability to recreate evolutionary relationships between biolo-
gical objects has driven much of our increased biological under-
standing. In particular, the reconstruction of phylogenetic trees
using sequence data is now commonplace and has provided
evidence for evolutionary mechanisms such as mutation, inser-
tion and deletion.

Similar to sequence data, over the past decade, the amount of
available interaction data between proteins has been steadily
increasing. These data are routinely represented as protein—
protein interaction (PPI) networks, with proteins as nodes and
interactions as edges. Despite the abundance of PPI data now
available, there is no tree reconstruction method based purely on
these networks. Yet, it is conjectured (Sharan and Ideker, 2006)
that such trees based on networks may give rise to a step change
in biology, much as tree-building methods from sequences did.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

There already are more elegant methods available for construct-
ing species trees, e.g. based on genomic sequences. Trees built
from PPI networks would span a limited species set and are by
themselves perhaps not of interest. In contrast, the methodology
that is able to correctly build a phylogenetic tree from interaction
data would be much of interest, as it should reveal information
about the evolutionary mechanisms at play in biological
networks. Such a method would also be useful in other domains
where alternative means of generating taxonomies are not
available.

There is currently a lack of consensus regarding likelihood-
based statistical models for PPI network evolution (Ratmann
et al., 2009). Moreover, often phylogenetic tree reconstruction
methods based on distances perform better and are more
robust to mis-speciﬁcation than maximum-likelihood methods
(Gonnet, 2012; Huelsenbeck and Hillis, 1993). Hence, we con-
centrate here on the development of a one-dimensional network
comparison statistic, which can be used to compile a distance
matrix to build trees.

The most tractable methods for network comparison are those
which compare at the level of the entire network using statistics
that describe global properties (e. g. Ratmann et al., 2009), but
these statistics are not sensitive enough to be able to reconstruct
phylogeny or shed light on evolutionary processes. In contrast,
there are several network alignment-based methods that compare
networks using the properties of the individual proteins (nodes)
e.g. local network similarity and/or protein functional or
sequence similarity (F lannick et al., 2009; Phan and Sternberg,
2012; Singh et al., 2008). The aim of these methods is to identify
matching proteins /nodes between networks and use these match-
ing nodes to identify exact or close subnetwork matches. A few
of these methods have been expanded to the multiple network
problems (F lannick et al., 2009; Liao et al., 2009). These methods
are usually computationally intensive and tend to yield an align-
ment that contains only a relatively small proportion of the
network, although this has been alleviated to some extent in
more recent methods (Alkan and Erten, 2014; Hu et al., 2014;
Patro and Kingsford, 2012).

The analysis is further confounded by a large number of false
positives and false negatives thought to be present in current PPI
data. Ali and Deane (2010) studied the effect of errors and in-
completeness in alignments of simulated networks and estimated
that only nearly complete networks (>90%) can produce
reliable alignments. Finally, PPI network alignment methods
are all based on the loose premise that the respective orthologs
of two interacting proteins also interact, forming pairs of
so-called interologs, and/or that orthologs will share neighbour-
hood topology. While there is some evidence for the existence of
such conserved interactions across species (Matthews et al.,
2001), particularly in proteins with high sequence similarity,

Alignment-free protein interaction network comparison

 

Lewis et al. (2012) found, taking the noise and incompleteness of
the data into account, that the fraction of correctly transferred
interactions is at most 3%, between reasonably diverese species,
even if orthologs are deﬁned as those proteins matched with a
blast EM 5 10—10 (Altschul et al., 1997). Moreover, current
evidence points to a far larger rate of change in PPIs than ex-
pected; speciﬁc interaction matches seem not to be the rule, but
rather the exception (Lewis et al., 2012; Shou et al., 2011).

Thus, we do not follow the network alignment paradigm,
but instead we take our lead from alignment-free sequence
comparison methods that have been used to identify evolution-
ary relationships (Liu et al., 2011a). Alignment-free methods
based on k—tuple counts (also called k—grams or k—words) have
been applied to construct trees from sequence data (Song et al.,
2013). A key feature is the standardization of the counts to
separate the signal from the background noise. Inspired by
alignment-free sequence comparison, we use subgraph counts
instead of sequence homology or functional one-to-one matches
to compare networks. Yet, even when comparing synthetic
networks of the same size, generated from the same model,
their small subgraph content can be volatile (Rito et al., 2010).
Our proposed method, Netdis, compares the subgraph content
not of the networks themselves but instead of the ensemble of
all protein neighbourhoods (ego-networks) in each network,
through an averaging many-to-many approach. The comparison
between these ensembles is summarized in a Netdis value, which
in turn is used as input for phylogenetic tree reconstruction.

The biological intuition for our new approach is based on a
collection of results. The idea of using the subgraph content to
build a distance between networks arises because motifs and
modules have long been identiﬁed as important components of
biological networks Wagner et al., 2007; Zhu et al., 2007) and
have been conjectured to play an important role in evolution
(Liu et al., 2011b); see also Cootes et al. (2007) and Przulj
(2007) for previous explorations of biological network compari-
son based on subgraph counts. A key idea of our article is not to
compare just the subgraph content of two networks, but instead
the ensembles of subgraphs of the two networks, as hinted at in
Rice et al. (2005). This use of subgraph content ensembles means
that Netdis requires only the interaction data and is very differ-
ent in concept from PPI network alignment methods.
Netdis differs from standard subgraph count approaches in
two key aspects: it introduces the ensemble view and applies a
standardization that controls for background noise.

We ﬁrst use our method on simulated networks using several
random graph models and show that it correctly classiﬁes
networks by model type even when confounded by varying
network density and size. We then use it to successfully recon-
struct the correct phylogenetic tree for the set of organisms for
which signiﬁcant PPI data are currently available. Our ability to
reconstruct correct phylogenies adds evidence that PPI
data retain evolutionary information, despite the lack of conser-
vation of individual interactions.

We have also investigated our method’s ability to separate
by type a large set of networks from several biological and
non-biological domains. The resulting tree is found to be
highly clustered by domain type, outperforming a recent and
far more computationally intensive community-detection
approach.

2 APPROACH
2.1 Neighbourhoods: ego-networks

Our method for network comparison is based on the core
concept that similar networks will, on average, contain similar
local neighbourhoods. We count the occurrence of subgraph
shapes in the local neighbourhoods of all nodes in a network.
This method was chosen rather than just counting the number of
subgraphs in the entire network, as the latter will be strongly
inﬂuenced by factors such as network size and density and, there-
fore, may be too coarse for many network comparisons.

Our notion of the neighbourhood of a protein is that of a
two-step ego-network, also called ego-network of radius two
(see, for example, Pattison, 1993). The two-step ego-network of
a protein/node p is the (sub) network consisting of all nodes
within two edges of p, also including all the edges between
those nodes. In general, r-step ego networks could be used
based on the application area. The radius should be chosen so
that the set of ego-networks displays reasonable variability. Here
we choose radius two, as the average shortest path length in
protein interaction networks tend to be of the order four,
and hence ego-networks with larger radii often contain a large
proportion of the overall network. For very dense networks, ego-
networks of radius one may be more appropriate.

2.2 An overview of the Netdis measure

Our algorithm starts by extracting for each query network the set
of two-step ego-networks of all nodes. For each two-step
ego-network, we count the number of occurrences of all 3 to
5—node induced subgraphs, or graphlets (Przulj, 2007). The
counting algorithm uses a combinatorial subgraph enumeration
approach (Hoevar and Demar, 2014). Counting induced sub-
graphs on k vertices as opposed to any subgraphs on k vertices
means that all the edges between the k vertices in the subgraph
must be present in the larger graph, and absent edges in the
subgraph must also be absent in the larger graph.

Every node in the network is hence associated with a k—nodes
subgraph count vector (k = 3, 4 or 5) for its corresponding two-
step ego-network (see Fig. 1). One could also use k = 6
and above, but the counts of larger subgraphs can be extremely
low in many networks and also computationally expensive to
enumerate. Once the ego-network of a node has been associated
with a count vector for all subgraphs contained in it, these counts
are centred according to the size and density of the ego-network.

While ideally the counts would be centred using a suitable
null model, currently no good probabilistic model for PPI net-
works is available that replicates the k—subgraph content of a
network (Rito et al., 2012). Instead we use the counts from a
gold-standard network as a proxy for the expected counts, where
the size and the graph density of the size-two ego-network are
taken into account.

For each k—node subgraph, we sum the centred counts of all
two-step ego-networks in the query network. The ﬁnal sum
vectors have length 2 for k = 3, length 6 for k = 4 and length
21 for k = 5. These sum vectors are then used as input to a self-
standardizing statistic, which we call netd§ (k). In a ﬁnal step, we
calculate a symmetric matrix containing the netd§ (k) values for
pair of networks in the set. The resulting matrix can be used to

Each network is associated with vectors of subgraph counts, calculated
from all its two-step ego-networks (this ﬁgure shows counts for only
subgraphs of three nodes). These count vectors, normalized by a back-
ground expectation, are then used to calculate the distance measure
between the pair of input networks. See Supplementary Section S3 for
a detailed calculation

cluster the candidate networks and the clustering represented by
dendrograms.

2.3 Expectation of subgraph counts in neighbourhoods

In alignment-free sequence comparison, centering the counts by
subtracting their means is crucial to avoid measuring back-
ground noise instead of signal (Reinert et al., 2009). For
Netdis, we are faced with the problem that there is no good
probabilistic model for subgraph counts in PPI networks avail-
able (Rito et al., 2012). Exploratory data analysis shows that the
subgraph counts depend on the graph density, which is the
fraction of observed edges over all potential edges.

To gauge the expected number of subgraph occurrences in an
ego-network of a given graph density, we ﬁrst create a histogram
of the graph densities of all ego-networks in the gold-standard
network. While the ideal comparison would be between ego-
networks of the exact same density, there is not enough variabil-
ity in the data for every possible density; hence, we use an
adaptive binning approach. The ego-networks of the gold stand-
ard are binned according to density, where the number and
size of bins is automatically adapted to ensure that each bin
contains at least ﬁve samples. We then estimate the expectation
per ego-network of each subgraph in a given graph density bin as
follows.

Let Q represent a gold-standard network with q nodes and
hence q ego-networks. The ego-network of node i contains,

—1
n.
say, 11,- nodes, e,- edges and has graph density a’,=e,-(  .

For an ego-network of Q with graph density d,, we write d,- w
p if d,- is in the graph density bin ,0: ,0(Q). Let w denote
a particular induced subgraph with k nodes and NW,,-(Q)

its number of occurrences in the ego-network of node i, with n,-

"i
nodes, in Q. We scale these counts by the < k) possible choices

of k nodes in the ego-network of node i. The average of the

scaled NWJ-(Q) for all q ego-networks in the graph density bin
is given by

 

 

1 

EW 2 = . , -
(Q p) l{le{1,...,q}:di~p}l 1.21:2“ 
dim!) k

For a query network G and a given subgraph w on k nodes,
we estimate the expected count of w in the ego-network of
node i e G, with d,- % ,0(Q) and n,- edges, as

EKG, p)= (:)EW(Q, p). (1)

This estimated expected count serves as our background
expectation.

Now, let A(k) be the set of all w subgraphs with k number
of nodes; here k = 3, 4 or 5. For a particular induced subgraph w
with k nodes, let NW-(G) denote its number of occurrences in
the ego-network of i e G. We proceed as follows:

(1) For each node i in G,

(a) Build an ego-network of radius 2 around and includ-
ing i.

(b) Calculate for the ego-network of node i, the number of
nodes 11,-, graph density d,- and the subgraph count
vector, NWJ-(G), for each k, with k= 3, 4 and 5.

(c) If d,- W ,0: ,o(i), calculate E‘jV(G, ,o(i)).
(2) Calculate,
SW(G)=Z(NW,.-(G) — E2.(G, pa)». (2)

To compare two networks, G and H, we deﬁne three netD§ (k)
statistics by

1 Sw(G)Sw(H)

«14"ng ,/SW(G)2+SW<H)2

netD§(k)= ,k=3,4, 5,

where

is a normalizing constant so that netD§(k) e [—1, 1] by
the Cauchy—Schwarz inequality. The corresponding Netdis
statistic is deﬁned as,

netd§(k) = $0 — netD§(k)) e [0, 1]. (3)

The pairwise Netdis values from Equation 3 are then used to
build a distance matrix for all query networks. Note that three
different distance matrices are deﬁned, based on k = 3, 4 or 5.
We then use Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic
Mean (UPGMA; Sokal and Michener, 1958) for building trees
from the Netdis distance matrices. UPGMA is a heuristic greedy

method that creates one cluster per network and sequentially
merges the nearest pair of clusters by directly using the distance
matrix until only two clusters remain. We ignore any branch
lengths, as they would be difﬁcult to interpret without a statis-
tical model and before understanding the effect of errors. We
used the phangorn package (Schliep, 2011) in R (R Core Team,
2013) to generate trees.

3 DATA

3.1 Synthetic networks from random graph models

We initially tested Netdis on simulated networks, namely,
Erdos—Rényi (ER) random graphs (Erd6s and Rényi, 1961),
Erdos—Rényi graphs with ﬁxed degree distribution (ERDD)
(Newman, 2010), geometric random graphs (Penrose, 2003), geo-
metric with gene duplication (Przulj et al., 2010), Chung—Lu
model (Chung and Lu, 2002) and the duplication—divergence
growth model (Middendorf et al., 2005).

The particular ER model, which we use here, has n labelled
nodes connected by m edges, which are randomly chosen from
the @ possible edges. The ﬁxed distribution variant (ERDD)
is constructed to have not just the same number of nodes and
edges as a reference network, but also the same degree distribu-
tion. Geometric 3-dimensional random graphs (GEO3D) with
parameter r are constructed by assigning each node random co-
ordinates in a 3-dimensional box of unit volume. Two nodes are
connected by an edge if the Euclidean distance between them is
at most r. A variant of this, incorporating biological intuition is
the geometric with gene duplication model (GeoGD). The
Chung—Lu (or Sticky) model constructs networks by assigning

an index 9,- to every node i for all n nodes where 9,- = w;

J2; dego)
here deg(i) is the degree of node i. Each possible edge i, j is then
formed with probability 9,9]; Finally, the duplication divergence
model (DD) grows a network at each iteration t by selecting a
node random and duplicating it with all its edges. We use a
variant of this model that speciﬁes a symmetric node duplication
model so that edges can be lost from both parent and child nodes
on divergence.

3.2 Protein interaction data

To test Netdis on experimental data, we downloaded species-
speciﬁc PPI data from the Database of Interacting Proteins
(DIP; Salwinski et al., 2004) and Human Protein Reference
Database (HPRD; Keshava Prasad et al., 2009). Only species
having at least 500 physical interactions and > 15% coverage
were considered. Coverage is here a rough estimate of how
many proteins have been probed for interactions given the
expected proteome of the organism. We deﬁne it as a percentage
by taking the number of nodes in the network divided by the
estimated number of genes in the genome of the organism at
hand. In total, we analyse ﬁve species: Saccharomyces cerevisiae
(yeast), Drosophila melanogaster (ﬂy), Homo sapiens (human),
Escherichia coli (E.coli) and Helicobacter pylori (H.pylori).
Human data came from HPRD (dated: September 2012)
while the other four datasets were downloaded from DIP

3.3 Networks from multiple disciplines

In a recent paper (Onnela et al., 2012), the authors constructed a
taxonomy of a large collection of networks obtained from a
variety of sources. Their method is based on ﬁrst probing the
community structure within each network and then using sum-
maries of the community structures to identify similar networks.
The original dataset used by the authors contains 746 networks.
We used all unweighted and undirected networks from this set,
resulting in a total of 151 networks. These come from across the
biological and social domains as well as model simulations (see
Supplementary Section S3 for full details).

4 RESULTS

In all of the results that follow, unless stated otherwise, Netdis
was calculated using k = 4 and the DIP core yeast interaction
dataset (Deane et al., 2002) as the gold standard. To test the
robustness of the method, we also used a simulated gold-stand-
ard network using the ER model with 5000 nodes and 20 000
edges (see Supplementary Fig. S8 for results). While using Netdis
with k = 5 is expected to increase the sensitivity of the method,
preliminary analysis of the datasets used for this study indicated
little beneﬁt of the latter, at the cost of substantially more com-
puting time spent in induced subgraph counting.

4.1 Netdis can separate different random graph model
types

We simulated ﬁve networks for each of the six models described
in Section 3.1, giving a total of 30 networks. The parameters for
all of these simulated networks were chosen to have the number
of nodes and edges match those of the DIP yeast network, al-
though some models create self-loops and disconnected nodes,
which lead to slight discrepancies. A pairwise distance matrix
was then constructed between these networks and the resulting
tree is shown in Figure 2. We observe a perfect clustering of the
networks according to model type.

In the above analysis, all networks had the same or similar
number of nodes and graph density. We also investigated the
effect of varying network size and density on Netdis’s ability to
resolve the different models. For three models (ER, DD and
Geo3D), we generated samples with either 1000 or 5000 nodes.
We also varied the densities, using values of 0.003, 0.005 and

method perfectly clusters together samples from the same model

0.007. As shown in Figure 3, even with such varying sizes and
densities, the correct clustering was achieved.

The simulated networks discussed so far are error-free.
Introduction of error should make it harder to distinguish
between networks from the different models. We introduced
false negatives and false positives in the simulated networks
(see Supplementary Section S2) and observed that for the
simple case when all networks have the same size and density,
Netdis can recover the correct grouping even with an error rate
of 50% (Supplementary Fig. S11a). However, error has a larger
adverse impact when the networks are already harder to cluster
because of varying size and density (Supplementary Fig. Sllb).
The sensitivity of the method to errors is likely to be dependent
on the dataset as well as error characteristics.

Our results on random graph models suggest that the different
model types differ substantially from each other, and thus are
perhaps not a rigorous test of the sensitivity of the method. This
intuition was borne out when we reanalysed the dataset using
modiﬁed versions of Netdis with the expectation in Equation 2
set to 0 (Netdis_ ne), or replacing the summation over all ego-
networks in Equation 2 with just the subgraph count of the
whole network (Netdis_ go) and no correction for background
expectation. Even these non-centred measures successfully gen-
erate the correct tree in all of the above cases (see Supplementary
Figs S1 and S2).

Instead of ego-network subgraph counts, networks could also
be grouped based on simpler properties such as the distribution
of the node degrees or local clustering coefﬁcients. To compare
Netdis with such baseline measures, we deﬁned Ddis and Cdis as
the values of the Kolmogorov—Smirnov test statistic between the
empirical distribution of nodes degrees and local clustering coef-
ﬁcients, respectively, for a given pair of networks. These values,

serving as proxies for pairwise network distance were then used
to generate phylogenetic trees for the simulated networks
discussed above. The results (see Supplementary Figs S9 and
S10) show that while these methods generate the correct cluster-
ing in the simplest case, they fail when the networks are variable
in size and density, indicating the need for richer measures like
Netdis in realistic settings.

While Netdis is completely different in approach to traditional
network alignment, it is tempting to compare the results to such
methods. Network alignment-based methods typically return re-
sults in the form of node or edge mappings and not a distance
matrix for a given set of networks. However, one such method,
MI-GRAAL (Kuchaiev and Przulj, 2011) has been used in the
literature to generate a phylogenetic tree of small viral PPI net-
works. MI-GRAAL is capable of solely topological network
alignment and its edge correctness score was used as a proxy
for network similarity measure to generate the distance matrix
for the phylogenetic tree. We therefore tested MI-GRAAL on all
of the above simulated datasets. For all simulated networks with
5000 or more nodes, we were unable to successfully ﬁnish align-
ment using MI-GRAAL. We therefore used only the networks of
1000 nodes and densities 0.003, 0.005 and 0.007 and the resulting
tree is presented in Supplementary Figure S3. While the tree
generated by MI-GRAAL is generally correct, two networks
(ER_1000_0.003 and DD_1000_0.007) are wrongly clustered.
The tree generated by Netdis for the same dataset, giving perfect
clustering, is also given for comparison (Supplementary Fig. S4).

4.2 Phylogenies from protein interaction data

The currently accepted phylogeny between the species of Table 1
is depicted by the tree in Supplementary Figure S5. The tree is
based on the NCBI taxonomy database (Sayers et al., 2009),
which incorporates a variety of phylogenetic resources including
molecular and morphological characters. The tree generated by
Netdis is depicted in Figure 4.

Out of the many possible rooted trees with ﬁve leaves, the
correct clustering is obtained with ﬂy next to human and yeast,

the signiﬁcant differences in number of nodes and edges, cover-
age and graph density. Moreover, Supplementary Figure Sllc
shows that even when introducing high levels of error in the PPI
networks, the correct tree topology is reproduced by Netdis. The

importance of the background expectation in Netdis becomes
apparent when the tree is generated using Netdis_ ne instead
(Supplementary Fig. S6a). In this case, the method does not re-
create the correct phylogeny, and places ﬂy next to H .pylori. The
same is true when Netdis_ go is used (Supplementary Fig. S6b).
The simple network statistics based methods, Ddis and Cdis, also
fail to generate the correct tree (Supplementary Figs S90 and
S100). When executing MI-GRAAL using only network top-
ology on these data, the program failed during the alignment
of the yeast and human network. We therefore only used the
other four species (ﬂy, yeast, H.pylori and E.coli) to generate
the tree. In this case, MI-GRAAL recreates a generally correct
tree with yeast and ﬂy in a single clade (Supplementary Fig. S7a),
but the bacterial species are split into two clades. The tree gen-
erated by Netdis for these four species is given in Supplementary
Figure S7b. For PPI networks, as a baseline, one could also
create phylogenies based on the number of orthologous inter-
actions shared by a pair of networks. The results for such an
approach are shown in Supplementary Figure S6c (see caption
for method details). The tree is generally correct, although the
approach is not applicable to other types of networks.

4.3 Classiﬁcation of diverse empirical networks

As a systematic representation of data amenable to rigorous
analysis and visualization, networks have become ubiquitous in
recent years across many scientiﬁc and social disciplines. While
these networks vary enormously in their detailed properties,
methods that can group similar networks together could prove
to be highly useful. We therefore compared the ability of Netdis
with group networks by domain, against the method used by
Onnela et al. on the data described in Section 3.3. As there is
no agreed true dendogram available for these data, we ﬁrst
manually created a taxonomy by simply grouping the data
based on type and assuming no further branching within
groups. In total, we identify 13 groups, such as protein inter-
action, congressional voting, metabolic networks, ER random
graphs, etc. Supplementary Figure S12 presents the complete
manual taxonomy. We then created taxonomic trees for these
networks using Netdis and Onnela et al.’s method. The resulting
trees were split using the catree function in R to give 13 groups
(cutree can interpret a given tree as a cluster hierarchy that can
then be merged/ split using the underlying distance matrix to give
the desired number of clusters). Finally, we compared the 13
groups from each of the methods with the manually created
groups using the adjusted Rand index (RI) for cluster similarity
(Hubert and Arabie, 1985). We also generated Monte-Carlo
P—values for the similarity values by generating 50 000 samples

from the null distribution as follows: each null sample was gen-
erated by creating a random tree topology with the same number
of leaves as the dataset, and we then calculated the cluster
similarity with the manual grouping. The P—value for an obser-
vation is then the fraction of null samples equal to or greater
than the observed similarity. The best performing method is
Netdis, with similarity index 0.011 (P-value: 0). Even without
using background expectation (Netdis_ ne), a better grouping
is achieved (RI: 0.01, P—value: 2 x 10‘5) than Onnela et al.’s
method, which has a similarity index of 0.006 (P-value: 0.001).
The clustered taxonomies generated by Onnela et al.’s method
and Netdis are given in Supplementary Figures S13 and S14. Of
particular interest is the fact that Netdis separates most of the
metabolic and protein interaction networks into two distinct
groups. The complete analysis for the 151 networks using
Netdis consumed around 10h of computing time on a standard
desktop computer, while Onnela et al.’s method consumed 18 h
on the same computer. The analysis could not be replicated using
MI-GRAAL, as the program failed to provide alignment results
for a large fraction of the dataset. We note that alignment-based
methods are perhaps inherently ill-suited to the task of classify-
ing large sets, which may include dense networks, as generating
all possible pairwise network alignments is a computationally
prohibitive task.

5 DISCUSSION

In this article, we add evidence to the idea that the topology of
protein interaction networks alone contains evolutionary infor-
mation without any additional biological data. Our results reveal
that current PPI data are sufﬁciently abundant to derive correct
phylogenetic relationships, at least between the model species.
From PPI data with genome coverage of at least 15%, our
method, Netdis, is able to deduce correct phylogenies between
species without resorting to sequence homology.

We emphasize that Netdis is not proposed as a competitive
method for the generation of phylogenetic trees for biological
species; existing techniques based on molecular sequences
already address this particular problem comprehensively. Our
main result is that from the topology of protein interaction
networks alone, it is possible to generate a correct phylogenetic
tree. It is therefore worth considering the underlying assumptions
of Netdis explore what they may reveal about protein interaction
network evolution. The core principle of this work is that species
that are more related will on average share more PPI network
neighbourhoods that are topologically similar than unrelated
species do. It is tempting to assign a biological interpretation
to the Netdis algorithm: a given biological function is normally
credited to a community of interacting proteins that act together
to perform that function in the cell. Closely related species will
have, on average, more of these communities in common. Our
method detects this phenomenon by comparing ensembles of
ego-networks derived from the PPI networks.

Netdis could also be used to consider the similarities between
biological networks during a cellular or adaptive response, where
it is thought that understanding the differences between these
networks is key (Ideker and Krogan, 2012). Obtaining phyloge-
nies of cell-states based on network data would provide a biolo-
gical perspective on these phylogenies, which would be both new

and completely free from sequence data. This perspective
would further complement phylogenies derived from
phenotypic traits with another type of molecular data. The
method could be reﬁned by adding information on the proteins,
such as protein function, structure, subcellular location or age
(Liu et al., 2011b; Rito et al., 2012); we would expect that includ-
ing such information would increase the sensitivity of the
method.

One particular focus of our ongoing and future research
efforts will be the derivation of theoretically well-founded
background expectations of subgraph counts used in Netdis.
At present, the method relies on specifying a gold-standard
dataset to estimate these expectations. While our results so
far indicate that the method is robust to the choice of gold stand-
ard, it seems feasible that derivation of exact expectation for-
mulas may increase method sensitivity and/or remove potential
bias.

We conclude with noting that, as no other data besides net-
work data are used as input to the method, many types of net-
work data can be analysed together. This makes the method
inherently different from the network alignment paradigm. As
a proof of concept, we presented some results indicating its abil-
ity to correctly classify simulated networks from random graph
models as well creating a reasonable taxonomy for a diverse
mixture of empirical networks. The ability to highlight relation-
ships between networks from different sources in a systematic
way may help researchers across different ﬁelds to identify em-
pirical analyses or theoretical models which are applicable to
their speciﬁc problem.

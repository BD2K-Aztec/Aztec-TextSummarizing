Abstract

Summary: Metabolic network mapping is a widely used approach for integration of metabolomic
experimental results with biological domain knowledge. However, current approaches can be lim—
ited by biochemical domain or pathway knowledge which results in sparse disconnected graphs
for real world metabolomic experiments. MetaMapR integrates enzymatic transformations with
metabolite structural similarity, mass spectral similarity and empirical associations to generate
richly connected metabolic networks. This open source, web—based or desktop software, written in
the R programming language, leverages KEGG and PubChem databases to derive associations be—
tween metabolites even in cases where biochemical domain or molecular annotations are un—
known. Network calculation is enhanced through an interface to the Chemical Translation System,
which allows metabolite identifier translation between >200 common biochemical databases.
Analysis results are presented as interactive visualizations or can be exported as high—quality
graphics and numerical tables which can be imported into common network analysis and visualiza—
tion tools.

Availability and Implementation: Freely available at http://dgrapov.github.io/MetaMapR/. Requires
R and a modern web browser. Installation instructions, tutorials and application examples are

1 Introduction

Metabolomic experiments contain both high-dimensional and
complex biological, chemical and analytical information. Mass
spectrometry based analyses can generate measurements for many
hundreds to thousands of small molecules. In addition to com—
pounds with identified biological roles many measurements may
only contain mass spectral or empirical information. Analysis of
metabolomic data in the context of biological domain knowledge
(e.g. enzymatic precursor to product relationships) is a well—
established approach for metabolic network generation (Gao et 61].,
2010). However, real world metabolomic experiments can measure
a wide range of biochemical domains [for example (Grapov et 61].,
2012)] for which direct biochemical intermediates may be absent
or unknown, leading to sparse disconnected biochemical

representations. Inclusion of non—measured metabolites in the recon—
structed metabolic networks using tools like Metscape (Karnovsky
et 61]., 2012) can help overcome this issue, but requires calculation of
minimum spanning trees, which can still fail to associate metabolites
lacking biochemical domain knowledge (e.g. complex lipids).
Barupal et al. (2012) recently showed in their tool Metamapp that
structural similarity information can be used to enhance enzymatic
transformation networks and fill in the gaps between missing
biochemical intermediates or domains. However, neither Metamapp
nor Metscape directly calculate structural similarity, mass spectral
similarity nor empirical relationships, and lack standalone inter—
active network visualization and threshold tuning interfaces featured
in MetaMapR. In addition to biochemical transformations and
structural similarity, MetaMapR also incorporates mass spectral

similarity and empirical correlation information. The combination
of these four orthogonal measures of molecular association provides
a robust framework for generating richly connected biochemical
representations which can combine molecules with unknown bio—
chemistry, unknown structures and integrate non—metabolomic data
(genomic, proteomic, clinical) into the reconstructed metabolic
networks.

2 Methods

MetaMapR (http://dgrapov.github.io/MetaMapIU) is implemented
in the R programming language (http://cran.us.r—project.org/) and
requires the R package Shiny (http://www.rstudio.com/) and a mod—
ern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, IE10, Safari, etc). Internet con—
nection is required for calculation of biochemical (KEGG, http://
www.genome.jp/kegg/) and structural similarity network
(PubChem, https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) relationships.

The user interface is implemented using the Twitter Bootstrap
front—end (http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/) and enhanced by custom
CSS, HTML and JavaScript. Interactive networks are created using
the D3.js (http://d3js.org/) JavaScript library and the R package
d3Networks. Networks can be exported as scalable vector graphic
or portable network graphic formats. Alternatively, network edge
list and node attributes can be exported as a comma separated value
(.csv) files which can be extended using other third party software
such as Cytoscape (Shannon et al., 2003). This licensed (GPLv3)
cross—platform (windows, OSX and linux) software can be deployed
locally or as a hosted web application using the Shiny server (https://
github.com/rstudio/shiny—server). Download and installation in-
structions can be found at https://github.com/dgrapov/MetaMapR.

2.1 Features

Data can be uploaded as comma separated values (.csv) or other
delimited formats through the application paste field. Accepted me—
tabolite identifiers include synonyms or one of over 200 common
biological database identifiers (see Identiﬁer Translation). Mass
spectra can be uploaded as mass—to—charge and intensity pair strings
(e.g. “m/zlzintensityl m/22zintensity2”). Measured metabolite con—
centrations, peak areas/heights, intensities or other experimental
data can be used to calculate empirical correlation relationships.

Identiﬁer Translation can be optionally used to map user metab—
olite names or identifiers to KEGG or PubChem CIDs required to
calculate biochemical and chemical similarity networks.
Translations are accomplished using CTSgetR (https://github.com/
dgrapov/CTSgetR), an R interface to the Chemical Translation
System (http://cts.fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu/).

Biochemical Reaction Networks are generated based on the
KEGG RPAIR (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/reaction/, ftp://ftp.gen—
ome.jp/pub/db/rclass/rpair) substrate—product pair reaction data—
base. User supplied metabolite names or database identifiers are
optionally translated to KEGG identifiers which are then used to
query for biochemical substrate—product relationships using a cura—
ted lookup table based on over 14 000 biochemical reactions in the
KEGG Database (Kanehisa et al., 2014).

Structural Similarity Networks are determined based on similar-
ities between PubChem Substructure Fingerprints (ftp://ftp.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/pubchem/specifications/pubchem_fingerprints.txt). The
R package Chemminer is used to generate molecular fingerprints
using the PubChem Power User Gateway (PUG). Molecular finger—
prints in the form of ordered lists of binary bits defining presence or
absence of physical properties (e.g. element type, functional group,

nearest neighbors) are used to calculate structural similarities.
Pairwise similarities are calculated based on the Tanimoto similarity
between two bit vectors (Willett et al., 1998). Similarity scores are
bound between 0 and 1, where a score of 0 or 1 defines no or com-
plete overlap in structural properties between two molecules.

Spectral Similarity Networks are calculated based on pairwise
similarities between mass spectra. Cosine correlations are
calculated between molecular features’ mass spectra which are
encoded as mass—to—charge ratio (m/z) and intensity pairs. The re—
sults are bounded between 0 and 1, with zero defining no and 1
complete correlation between two mass spectra. Generated mass
spectral similarity networks can be optimized based on control of
the cosine correlation threshold for edge acceptance, limit of total
edges per object, and object—specific control of edge acceptance (e.g.
limiting connections to only show annotated to unknown
relationships).

Empirical Dependency Networks are calculated (Langfelder and
Horvath, 2008) based on the parametric Pearson and biweight cor—
relations or non—parametric Spearman correlations between meas—
ured metabolite values (e.g. concentration, peak intensity, etc.) for
any or all samples. Measures of significance or P—values and the false
discovery rate (FDR) adjusted P—values can be used to alter the
statistical confidence of the correlation networks. For example a
correlation network based monotonic linear relationships between
metabolites which is robust to outliers and mitigates spurious false
discoveries can be calculated using Spearman correlations with edge
acceptance at FDR P-values < 0.05.

3 Results and Discussion

MetaMapR is implemented using the shiny R package, a tool for
building browser—based applications, which can be deployed on the
desktop using a modern web browser or can be hosted as a stand—
alone web—application using the shiny—server (https://github.com/
rstudio/shiny—server).

A variety of MetaMapR applications are described at (http://
dgrapov.github.io/MetaMapR/) including the analysis of type 1
diabetes—dependent (T1D) biochemical changes in NOD mice
(Grapov et al., 2014) and metabolic changes in lung cancer in
humans (Wikoff et al., 2015). The study by Grapov et. al. compared
metabolic profiles of animals progressing to T1D (progressor) to
those maintaining normoglycemic control (non—progressor), to
identify age and gender independent T1D—associated biochemical
perturbations in over 470 plasma metabolites measured by gas—
chromatography time—of—ﬂight mass spectrometry (GC—TOF—MS).
A biochemical reaction and structural similarity metabolic network
(Fig. 1A) was calculated to show key biochemical alterations in
progressor compared with non—progressors. Due to the limitation of
the KEGG database description of the directionality of biochemical
transformations, ‘the terms “reversible” and “irreversible” do not
necessarily reﬂect biochemical properties of each reaction’ (http://
www.genome.jp/kegg/xml/docs/) and because MetaMapR uniquely
combines biochemical relationships, many of which are reversible
given appropriate conditions, with structural similarity, mass
spectral similarity and correlations, all of which lack directionality;
the current implementation of MetaMapR treats all enzymatic
relationships as undirected. The network structural similarity
threshold was set to Tanimoto score>0.7, which maintains non-
overlapping network modularity for the biochemical classes
described in Figure 1A. A more detailed description of structural
similarity threshold selection can be found in Barupal et. al. (Barupal
et al., 2012).

Fig. 1. Mapped metabolic networks combining a variety of edge combinations available in MetaMapR. Metabolomic networks can be generated based on
(A) biochemical substrate-product and structural similarity relationships (Grapov et al., 2014), which can also display (B) mass spectral similarity information or
combined with C) empirical correlations. BinBase identifiers (Fiehn et al., 2005) are reported for unknowns. Node size represents the fold change in metabolite

levels relative controls

T1D was associated with large scale metabolic perturbations in
plasma metabolites including increases in the majority of carbohy—
drates (red downward arrows), and a decrease in the structurally
similar but not directly biochemically related 1,5—anhydroglucitol.
Dietary derived 1,5—anhydroglucitol (bottom left) is an established
marker of glucose control (Kim and Park, 2013), the levels in which
drop in response to competition with increasing glucose for re—
absorption in the kidneys. Networks in Figure 1 were calculated in
MetaMapR, exported to Cytoscape (Shannon et al., 2003) and fur—
ther enhanced by mapping various empirical and domain know-
ledge—based variables to the network node attributes, the process of
which is described in detail elsewhere (Grapov et al., 2014). Mass
spectral information can be used to extend the analysis of biochem—
ical and structural similarity relationships to molecules without
structural annotation (unknowns; Fig. 1B). Mass spectral similarity
network analysis has been previously used to link structurally un—
known features with known molecules (Watrous et al., 2012). Mass
spectral similarity is defined based on the cosine of the angle
between two or more mass spectra represented as vectors (cosine
correlation) which was set to > 0.7 for Figure 1B and 1C. We sug—
gest that the user considers tuning the threshold for mass spectral
similarity based on their needs (Stein and Scott, 1994).

MetaMapR uniquely combines molecular biochemical and struc—
tural information (Fig. 1A) with mass spectral similarity (Fig. 1B)
and correlation based associations (Fig. 1C). The combination of

orthogonal information can help link structurally unknown metab—
olites (Fig. 1C, rounded rectangles) to other identified species.
MetaMapR is freely available open source software which includes
ongoing efforts to integrate the analysis of gene—metabolite and pro—
tein—metabolite biochemical information, calculation of Gaussian
graphical Markov metabolomic networks (GGM) and an enhanced
dynamic network mapping interface.

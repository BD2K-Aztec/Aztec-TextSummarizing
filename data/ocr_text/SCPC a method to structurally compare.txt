ABSTRACT

Motivation: Protein—protein interactions play vital functional roles in
various biological phenomena. Physical contacts between proteins
have been revealed using experimental approaches that have solved
the structures of protein complexes at atomic resolution. To examine
the huge number of protein complexes available in the Protein
Data Bank, an efficient automated method that compares protein
complexes is required.

Results: We have developed Structural Comparison of Protein
Complexes (SCPC), a novel method to structurally compare protein
complexes. SCPC compares the spatial arrangements of subunits
in a complex with those in another complex using secondary
structure elements. Similar substructures are detected in two
protein complexes and the similarity is scored. SCPC was applied
to dimers, homo-oligomers and haemoglobins. SCPC properly
estimated structural similarities between the dimers examined as
well as an existing method, MM-align. Conserved substructures
were detected in a homo-tetramer and a homo-hexamer composed
of homologous proteins. Classification of quaternary structures of
haemoglobins using SCPC was consistent with the conventional
classification. The results demonstrate that SCPC is a valuable tool
to investigate the structures of protein complexes.

1 INTRODUCTION

Proteins are crucial molecules in biological phenomena that
function Via speciﬁc interactions with target molecules, including
small ligand molecules, other proteins and nucleic acids. Such
molecular interactions are involved in biological processes including
various kinds of metabolism, signal transduction and transcriptional
regulation. Numerous protein—protein interactions have been
experimentally identiﬁed using high—throughput techniques, such
as the yeast two—hybrid system (Fields and Song, 1989; Ito et al.,
2001; Uetz et al., 2000), and the results are available in open
public databases (Alfarano et al., 2005; Aranda et al., 2010;
Ceol et al., 2010; Keshava Prasad et al., 2009; Salwinski et al.,
2004). In addition, structures of protein complexes have been

determined at atomic resolution by X—ray crystallography or nuclear
magnetic resonance, and this information has been deposited in the
Protein Data Bank (PDB) (Berman et al., 2007). Currently, the
number of structural complexes in the PDB is rapidly increasing
(Supplementary Fig. S1).

To process such large numbers of structural complexes and
derive valuable biological insights from them, an automated
method to compare the structures of protein complexes is
required. Data processing of the huge amount of sequences
and structures of biomacromolecules has been facilitated by
automated comparison methods; for example, the Needleman—
Wunsch algorithm (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970), FASTA
(Pearson and Lipman, 1988), BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997) and
the S—Search (Smith and Waterman, 1981) for protein and nucleic
acid sequences, and DALI (Holm and Sander, 1993), SSAP (Orengo
and Taylor, 1996), VAST (Gibrat et al., 1996), CE (Shindyalov and
Bourne, 1998), MATRAS (Kawabata and Nishikawa, 2000) and
TM—align (Zhang and Skolnick, 2005) for protein structures. These
methods have also made signiﬁcant contributions to various studies
on the structure, function and evolution of biomacromolecules.

An improved understanding of many aspects of structural
complexes and protein—protein interactions is obtained by
employing automated comparison methods. One of these is
the comparative analysis of structural complexes composed
of evolutionary—related proteins. When proteins constitute a
protein complex, their orthologous proteins also frequently form
complexes. By applying an automated comparison method to
these protein complexes, the evolutionary relationships between
structure variation and sequence diversity can be revealed. Such
a method also enables us to compare a query structural complex
with each structure in databases and retrieve the structures that
are similar to the query structure. This approach can be further
extended to an exhaustive comparison among all existing structures
of protein complexes. Similar structures are grouped into a cluster
and a variety of clusters each consisting of similar complexes are
subsequently obtained from the analysis. The resulting data present
a comprehensive classiﬁcation of protein complexes. Therefore,
the development of an automated method to compare the structures
of protein complexes would facilitate future investigations into
protein complexes and protein—protein interactions.

In general, in the comparison of two structural complexes, each
subunit of a complex exclusively corresponds to one subunit of
the other complex. Exploring subunit correspondence is a unique
process of comparing protein complexes that is not required for
comparing protein structures. Currently, only a few methods have
been proposed. Aloy et al. (2003) investigated structures of dimeric
proteins, in which the subunit correspondence was provided in

advance. To compare the relative orientation of two subunits of
a dimer with that of another dimer, interaction root mean square
deviation (iRMSD) was invented. By plotting iRMSD against
sequence identity between subunits, they showed that interactions
of closely related proteins were almost invariable, whereas those
for structurally analogous proteins were not. Levy et al. (2006)
simpliﬁed the structure of a protein complex to the form of a graph,
in which a node and an edge indicated a subunit and the direct
interaction of two subunits, respectively. Graphs were a suitable
representation that could be compared and classiﬁed, and thus
the subunit correspondence was explored easily. The results were
summarized in the 3D Complex database (Levy et al., 2006), which
exhibits the classiﬁcation of structural complexes. Mukherjee and
Zhang (2009) developed a method, MultiMer—align (MM—align), as
an extension of TM—align (Zhang and Skolnick, 2005). In MM—align,
multiple subunits in each complex are connected in a head—to—tail
manner, and two virtual monomeric chains are aligned so that one
subunit in a complex corresponds to one in the other. All possible
orders of subunits in virtual monomeric chains are evaluated. Note
that similar ordering issues were addressed in protein structure
comparisons if the structurally related parts in two proteins were
located at sequentially different positions (Guerler and Knapp, 2008;
Krissinel and Henrick, 2004; Yuan and Bystroff, 2005), as seen
in circularly permuted proteins (Lindqvist and Schneider, 1997;
Schmidt—Goenner et al., 2010).

Our study aimed to develop a novel automated method, Structural
Comparison of Protein Complexes (SCPC), to compare the
structure of two protein complexes employing secondary structure
elements (SSEs). SCPC divides complexes into subunits and
detects structurally similar subunits from each of the complexes.
Subunit similarity was explored using a heuristic approach that has
previously been employed for the comparison of protein structures
(Mizuguchi and Go, 1995), in which sequential orders of SSEs
were considered. The structurally similar subunits are used to
construct two similar substructures in complexes that show the
subunit correspondence. The construction is independent of the
orders of the subunits in the PDB ﬁles. SCPC was applied to
three types of structural complexes: (i) homo— and heterodimers;
(ii) homo—oligomers consisting of homologous subunits exhibiting
different oligomeric states; and (iii) oxyhaemoglobins and
deoxyhaemoglobins, to evaluate the performance of this method.

2 METHODS

2.1 Overview

Let us consider two structures of protein complexes, A and B, composed
of N and M subunits, respectively. The subunits of A (or B) are labelled
and represented as a1,a2,m,aN (or b1,b2,m,bM). SCPC detects similar
substructures within A and B, which are indicated by two sets of subunits.
These sets are composed of the same number (at most the smaller of N
and M) of subunits. Each subunit of one set exclusively corresponds to one
subunit of the other set. A subunit and its corresponding subunit adopt similar
structures and the two subunits are paired as a structurally—similar subunit
pair (SSP). The two subunits are also located at the same position when two
similar substructures are superimposed. Thus, the spatial arrangements of
the subunits are similar. The one—to—one correspondence of the subunits is
represented by an SSP set. For example, {(a1,b,-), (a2,bj), ' ~ , (aM, bk)}, where
two subunits enclosed by a parenthesis is an SSP, and SSPs are arranged in
ascending order of the subscript of a. SCPC produces a ﬁnal set of SSPs and
calculates the similarity score for the substructures.

Complex A

 

Complex B

Fig. 1. Subunits and SSEs examined in the subunit arrangement comparison
process. An ellipse, rectangle or hexagon indicates a subunit, and the same
shape illustrates structurally similar subunits. Therefore, a,- and b; (ellipses),
or Clj and bm (rectangles), are each SSPs. SSEs (arrows) in a,- and 19;, or Clj
and bm, are aligned structurally. For example, two SSEs, es(a,-) and e,,(bl),
or et(aj) and ev(bm), are aligned. In comparing the spatial arrangement of a,-
and aj with that of b; and bm, we focused on two SSEs in the distinct subunits
of a complex and their counterparts in another complex. For example, the
spatial arrangement of es(a,-) and et(aj) (linked with a dashed bidirectional
arrow) was compared with that of e,,(bl) and ev(bm). Spatial arrangement of
every pair of SSEs in the distinct subunits was also considered.

SCPC is divided into two parts: the subunit comparison process and the
subunit arrangement comparison process. In the subunit comparison process,
a subunit in A is structurally compared with a subunit in B based on SSEs
(Mizuguchi and Go, 1995). If SSEs of the subunits are structurally aligned,
then the subunits are similar. Structurally similar subunits are stored as an
SSP with the SSEs alignment. A pairwise comparison is then performed on
all pairs of subunits from A and B. In the subunit arrangement comparison
process, very large numbers of SSP sets are generated in a stepwise manner.
During each step, SCPC adds an SSP to the set generated previously,
evaluates the spatial arrangements of the subunits and retains the signiﬁcant
SSP sets. Finally, the best set of SSPs is obtained. Details of the subunit
arrangement comparison process are presented in the following section.
The subunit comparison process is described in the Supplementary Material
because an existing method was employed (Mizuguchi and Go, 1995).

2.2 Subunit arrangement comparison process

2.2.] Examination of a pair of SSPs The subunit arrangement comparison
process involves the examination of a pair of SSPs, (a,, 19;) and (aj, bm). SCPC
compares the spatial arrangement of a,- and aj in A with that of bl and bm in B,
and scores the similarity between the two arrangements as SSU(a,-, Clj, bl, bm).
To calculate SSU(Cli,Clj,bl,bm), we focused on two SSEs, the s—th SSE of a,-
and the t—th SSE of Clj, denoted as es(a,-) and et(aj), respectively. Since SSEs
were aligned and stored in the subunit comparison process (Supplementary
Material), the counterparts of es(a,-) and e,(aj) were already determined
[e,,(bl) and ev(bm), respectively; Fig. 1]. The spatial arrangement of es(a,-)
and et(aj) is compared with that of eu(bl) and ev(bm), and the similarity is

scored as SSSE(eS(a,-), et(aj), eu(bl),ev(bm)) (We modiﬁed the existing score
to evaluate the structural similarity of SSEs and deﬁned the score SSSE. See
Supplementary Material for details.) The similarity score SSU(Cli,Clj,bl,bm)
was deﬁned as,

Swatapbtbm): Z Z Swami).excited»),evaom»,
(s,u)€I(ai,b1)(t,v)€I(aj,bm)
( 1)
where I (ai,bl) is the set of indices that speciﬁes aligned SSEs of a,- and 19;,
and the SSEs not observed in the alignments are discarded.

2.2.2 Total score of a set of SSPs To evaluate a set of SSPs, the total
score Stow; was introduced in SCPC. A set of N SSPs is depicted as
FN = {(Clx(1)aby(1)), (axe), 15(2)), ' " , (61x0), by(i))a "'a(ax(N)aby(N))}a Where 960)
and y(i) indicate subunit labels of the i—th SSP. We deﬁned the total score of
I‘N as,

N—l N
Sgtal : Z ZSSUWxU), 61x0), byg), byw)
i=1]>1 , (2)

= Z SSU(ax(i)v 0x0» bye» bym)
SSPpair
where Essppair represents the summation of all combinations of two SSPs in

I‘N. As clearly shown by Equation (2), the similarity scores of two subunit
arrangements, SSU s, constitute the total score, Stow].

2.2.3 Exploring the best set of SSPs When SCPC explores the best set of
SSPs that maximizes Stow], SSP sets are produced in a stepwise manner and
their total scores are evaluated. Initially, all sets of two SSPs are generated,
their total scores are calculated using Equation (2) and the best 500 sets are
retained. At the next step, possible SSPs are added to each of the retained
sets. A number of sets of three SSPs are generated and their total scores
are calculated. Sets of three SSPs are subsequently discarded if the addition
of an SSP does not improve the total score. SCPC assembles the new sets
(sets of three SSPs) and previously retained sets (sets of two SSPs), and
selects the best 500 sets. This step is repeated until the addition of a new
SSP is not possible. Finally, SCPC decides the best set of SSPs among all
the calculated sets. This set presents the two most similar substructures in
the protein complexes.

2.3 R-score

The total score, Stow], is additive, and thus largely depends on the protein
complex size. To reduce the size dependency of the similarity score, we
introduced the scaled score, R—score (Kawabata, 2003). As a result of the
structure comparison between complexes A and B, the total score, Stoml(A, B),
is obtained. The R—score is deﬁned as,

R(A,B):100X Stotal(AaB)_Smin , 

Smax _ Smin

where Smax and Smin are,

Stotal(AaA) + Stotal(Ba B)
Smax = 2

Smin = 0

Stoml(A,A) and Stoml(B,B) are the total scores obtained by self—comparisons.

 

3 RESULTS

3.1 Comparison of homo- and heterodimers
First, we compared Ulp1/Smt3 (PDB ID: 1euv) (Mossessova and
Lima, 2000) and Den1/Nedd8 (1xt9) (Reverter et al., 2005) as

examples of heterodimers. SCPC produced a set of SSPs, {(1euvA,
1xt9A), (1euvB, 1xt9B)}, where A and B were the chain identiﬁers.

Ulp1 (1euvA) and Smt3 (1euvB) corresponded to Den1 (1xt9A)
and Nedd8 (1xt9B), respectively. The SSEs of the corresponding
subunits were structurally aligned with SCPC (Fig. 2a). Aligned
SSEs were represented by the centres of their Cat atoms and the
structures were superimposed (Fig. 2b). The total score Stow; was
also obtained and converted to the R—score (50.4).

To examine the performance of SCPC, we prepared a benchmark
set composed of homo— and heterodimers. This set is a subset of
Mukherjee and Zhang’s set that was constructed to evaluate MM—
align (Mukherjee and Zhang, 2009). The set consists of two groups
of dimers; the ﬁrst group is the set of queries (105 dimers) and the
second group (3662 dimers) is the database used for the similarity
search in structures. The detailed process of dataset construction
is described in the Supplementary Material. The examination of
Mukherjee and Zhang provides a list of dimer pairs, a query and
its closest structural neighbour (CSN) in the second group identiﬁed
by MM—align based on the similarity score (TM—score). We applied
SCPC to the 105 pairs. The R—score and the TM—score of the pairs are
plotted in Figure 2c. The two values correlate well with a correlation
coefﬁcient of 0.78, indicating that SCPC can also evaluate the
structural similarity between the queries and the CSNs, as calculated
by MM—align.

In the similarity search of the database by SCPC, the CSNs
are not always the same as that of MM—align. The CSNs were
identical for 62 queries (red crosses in Fig. 20); however, SCPC and
MM—align proposed different CSNs for 43 queries (black crosses).
An additional measure was introduced to examine which structure
was better. We divided the dimers of a query and its CSN into
subunits, and aligned the corresponding subunits independently
using MATRAS (Kawabata and Nishikawa, 2000). Two residue—
wise structural alignments were subsequently obtained for the
smaller and larger subunits. According to the alignment of the larger
subunits, the two complexes were superimposed, and we calculated
the RMSD of the aligned Cat atoms of the smaller subunits (referred
to as the ligand RMSD). The ligand RMSD values are plotted in
Figure 2d for 41 queries (the two omitted plots are described in
the Supplementary Material). This plot shows that both CSNs from
SCPC and MM—align exhibit almost the same similarities to the
queries. The difference between ligand RMSDs is only 0.05 A on
average and SCPC proposed better CSNs for 15 queries. All the data
on the 105 queries and their CSNs are summarized in Supplementary
Table S1. Consequently, SCPC and MM—align identiﬁed the same
or comparable structural neighbours for the 103 query dimers. This
demonstrates that SCPC performs well as MM—align in the structural
comparison of dimers.

3.2 Comparison of homo-oligomers composed of
homologous proteins

While many homologous proteins adopt similar structures,
molecular functions and binding modes, some also assemble into
quite different protein complexes using distinct binding modes
(Akiva et al., 2008; Hashimoto and Panchenko, 2010; Nishi
et al., 2011; Nishi and Ota, 2010). Structural comparisons of
such protein complexes are important in understanding protein—
protein interactions and protein oligomerization processes. In this
section, we focus on N —carbamoyl—D—amino acid hydrolase (2ggk)
(Chiu et al., 2006) and aliphatic amidase (2uxy) (Andrade et al.,
2007). These proteins are homologous, because their sequences are

similar [BLAST E—value: 10—10 (Altschul et al., 1997)]. However,
N —carbamoyl—D—amino acid hydrolase and aliphatic amidase exist
in homo—tetrameric and homo—hexameric forms, respectively. When
they were compared, SCPC detected similar substructures composed
of two subunits, depicted by {(2ggkA, 2uxyA), (2gng, 2uxyE)}
(Fig. 3a). We further observed that a subunit of the homo—tetramer

interacts with the other three subunits via different interfaces and
that each interaction represents a binding mode.

The two subunits in the detected set of SSPs (2ggkAB)
represented the binding mode that gave the largest interface area
(2475 A2) among all three modes. Similarly, the two detected
subunits in the homo—hexamer (2uxyAE) also represented the

binding mode that gave the largest interface area (4581 A2). In this
case, the homologous proteins maintain the binding mode that gives
the largest interface area, as previously reported (Levy et al., 2008).
Since the structures of homo—oligomers are essentially symmetrical,
we can observe almost the same binding modes in different dimers of
the homo—oligomers (e.g. 2ggkCD and 2uxyBD). These dimers were
identiﬁed by suboptimal solutions, whereas the other dimers that
presented distinct binding modes (e. g. 2ggkAC and 2uxyAB) were
not detected.

Based on superimposing similar substructures that were detected
(Fig. 3b), we investigated why the oligomeric states of the two
proteins were different. We found that four inserted loop regions,
residues 140—143 and 202—211 in two subunits of the homo—tetramer
(2ggkAB), were protruding and abolished the interaction with the
subunits of the homo—hexamer (2uxyCB, see the right panel). These
steric hindrances potentially inhibit the N —carbamoyl—D—amino acid
hydrolase from forming a homo—hexamer (Akiva et al., 2008;
Hashimoto and Panchenko, 2010). Accordingly, SCPC successfully
identiﬁed similar substructures from different protein complexes,
thereby offering valuable insight into protein interactions.

3.3 Classiﬁcation of haemoglobin quaternary
structures

Haemoglobin (Hb) is a well—known oligomeric protein that forms
a tetramer composed of two oz—subunits and two ,8—subunits. Each
subunit contains a haem group, to which a ligand molecule (oxygen
or carbon monoxide) binds. Hb exists in two states that exhibit
different ligand afﬁnities; the R state with a high afﬁnity and the
T state with a low afﬁnity. These two states differ in their quaternary
structures (Baldwin and Chothia, 1979; Perutz, 1972). We collected
18 Hb structures from the PDB and protein quaternary structure
ﬁle server (PQS) (Henrick and Thornton, 1998) (Supplementary
Material). Eight of these structures contain bound carbon monoxide
(CO—Hb), whereas three structures contain bound oxygen (oxy—Hb).
The other seven structures do not include any ligands (deoxy—Hb).
Ligand—bound Hb (CO—Hb and oxy—Hb) and deoxy—Hb are usually
in the R and T states, respectively. We applied SCPC to the 18 Hb
quaternary structures. Every pair of Hb structures was examined and
a set of four SSPs was obtained for each pair. This result revealed
that all subunits of a given Hb correspond to all subunits of any
Hb. Structural differences between Hbs were not large, because all
R—scores were >36.0 (see Figs. 2c and 2d for the signiﬁcance of
the R—score). Average—linkage clustering (equivalent to the UPGMA
method) was also performed according to the R—scores (Fig. 4a).
The dendrogram revealed that the Hb structures were divided into
two groups, Hbs with bound ligands and deoxy—Hbs, with only two
exceptions that are described below.

To clarify the structural difference between Hb with bound ligands
and deoxy—Hb, we compared human oxy—Hb (2dn1) and deoxy—Hb
(2dn2) (Park et al., 2006). We obtained the set {(2dn1A, 2dn2A),
(2dn1B, 2dn2B), (2dn1C, 2dn2C), (2dn1D, 2dn2D)} using these
proteins with an R—score of 67.6. We further examined the spatial
arrangements of the two subunits to analyse the structural differences
in more detail. Two SSPs were chosen from the set to calculate the
SSU [Equation (1)]. All SSU scores are summarized in Figure 4b.
The spatial arrangement of an a—subunit and a ,B—subunit of the
oxy—Hb (2dn1CD) was closest to that of the deoxy—Hb (2dn2CD),
and the SSU was found to be the largest (see 052—,82 in Fig. 4b).

SSEs from the human oxy—Hb structure and the human deoxy—Hb structure,
respectively. The average deviations are shown as dashed lines. SSE indices
at the horizontal axis specify the positions of helices from the N—terminus in
a subunit.

Structural comparison of protein complexes

 

The arrangements of the other a—subunits and ,B—subunits (2dn1AB
and 2dn2AB, 071 —,81) were also similar, and the SSU was the second
largest. This result indicates that the spatial arrangements of an
a—subunit and its counterpart ,8—subunit, i.e. 051 and ,81, or 052 and
,82, are quite similar in structure for oxy—Hb and deoxy—Hb, as
indicated by the careful analysis of Baldwin and Chothia (1979).
It also suggests that the heterodimer, 051 and ,81, or 052 and ,82, is
rigid. Therefore, the difference in the quaternary structures of Hbs
with a bound ligand and deoxy—Hbs can be described based on the
movement of these two rigid dimers (Fig. 4b).

In the dendrogram (Fig. 4a), the two deoxy—Hbs from horse (1ibe)
(Wilson et al, 1996) and bar—headed goose (1hv4) (Liang et al,
2001) were classiﬁed into the Hb cluster with bound ligands. The
horse Hb has an oxidized iron ion associated with its haem group.
This kind of Hb is known to adopt the quaternary structure of
the high—afﬁnity (R) state (Wilson et al, 1996) and it is therefore
reasonable that this Hb structure is classiﬁed into the Hb cluster
with bound ligands. The bar—headed goose Hb is known to have
high oxygen afﬁnity. The difference in quaternary structure between
the oxy—Hb and the deoxy—Hb forms isolated from the bar—headed
goose was reported to be much smaller than that observed in the
corresponding human structures (Liang et al, 2001), supporting the
classiﬁcation of the bar—headed goose deoxy—Hb. The structures of
the two exceptions were superimposed with the structures of the
human oxy—Hb and deoxy—Hb, and the deviations from the centres
of the corresponding SSEs are shown in Figure 4c. This result shows
that these two structures are closest to the structure of human oxy—
Hb, rather than the structure of human deoxy—Hb. Consequently,
SCPC is capable of accurately detecting the structural differences
between Hbs due to ligand binding.

4 CONCLUSIONS

We have developed SCPC, a novel method to compare the
structures of protein complexes. SCPC was initially applied to
a dataset of homo— and heterodimers that was used to evaluate
an existing method, MM—align. The results were examined and
the performances of MM—align and SCPC were compared. SCPC
was further applied to homo—oligomers, which do not have unique
oligomeric states, despite the apparent homology of their subunits.
Additional examples have been previously reported (Akiva et al,
2008; Hashimoto and Panchenko, 2010; Nishi et al, 2011; Nishi
and Ota, 2010) and their structural comparison would be potentially
useful for clarifying the evolution of protein complexes, as supported
by the evolutionarily conserved binding mode identiﬁed for these
homo—oligomers. Finally, SCPC was applied to the well—studied Hb
and the results were compared with the conventional classiﬁcation.
Since Hbs are tetrameric proteins, the application of our method to
higher order protein complexes was also considered. Satisfactory
results were obtained for all tested cases. In addition, SCPC is fast.
For example, in the structural comparison of bacterial ribosomes
from Escherichia coli (2qbd) and Thermus thermophilus (1fjg),
each of which represents one of the largest complexes in the PDB,
the calculation time was only 6.3 s on a 2.5 GHz AMD Opteron
processor. These results indicate that SCPC is an effective and
efﬁcient tool for characterizing structures of protein complexes.

As described in Section 1, the subunit correspondence is crucial in
the structural comparison of protein complexes. We have observed
that SCPC is suitable for the analysis of domain fusions or ﬁssions

in multi—domain proteins if the correspondence between domains
should be examined rather than the subunits. Such enhancements
will make SCPC more powerful and useful.

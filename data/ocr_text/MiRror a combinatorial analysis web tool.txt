ABSTRACT

Summary: The miRror application provides insights on microRNA
(miRNA) regulation. It is based on the notion of a combinatorial
regulation by an ensemble of miRNAs or genes. miRror integrates
predictions from a dozen of miRNA resources that are based on
complementary algorithms into a unified statistical framework. For
miRNAs set as input, the online tool provides a ranked list of targets,
based on set of resources selected by the user, according to their
significance of being coordinately regulated. Symmetrically, a set of
genes can be used as input to suggest a set of miRNAs. The user
can restrict the analysis for the preferred tissue or cell line. miRror is
suitable for analyzing results from miRNAs profiling, proteomics and
gene expression arrays.

1 INTRODUCTION

Recent miRNA discovery techniques conﬁrmed the presence
of hundreds of miRNAs in healthy and diseased tissues.
Currently, approximately 900 miRNAs are reported in human and
approximately 600 in mouse. It was shown that miRNA binding
sites are not conﬁned solely to 3’ —untranslated regions (UTRs),
but also are found in coding regions and introns (Kim, 2005).
Furthermore, multiple features were shown to be imperative in
regulation by miRNAs (Sethupathy et al., 2006; Nielsen et al.,
2007). This led to a growing number of resources and algorithms
that predict the pairing of miRNAs and their targets (Mendes
et al., 2009). Currently, mirBase (Grifﬁths—Jones et al., 2008) is
the most exhaustive collection of miRNAs with over approximately
15000 mature miRNA sequences. miRBase collection (Enright
et al., 2003; Grifﬁths—Jones et al., 2008; John et al., 2004) is based
on MicroCosm algorithm. Additional exhaustive miRNA targets
predictors include TargetScan (Lewis et al., 2003) and PicTar (Krek
et al., 2005). Other large—scale resources for microRNA—target
pairing includes PITA (Kertesz et al., 2007), microRNA.org that is
based on miRanda algorithm (Betel et al., 2008; Enright et al., 2003;
John et al., 2004), DIANA—microT 3.0 (Maragkakis et al., 2009),
miRDB (Wang, 2008) and ElMMO—MirZ (Hausser et al., 2009). For

a subset of miRNAs—target pairs, in viva experimental validation is
available in TarBase database (Papadopoulos et al., 2009).

We have developed miRror, an interactive tool for analyzing
experimental results under the notion of coordination in miRNAs
regulation. A coordinated regulation by several miRNAs was
proposed [see discussion (Ivanovska and Cleary, 2008; Krek
et al., 2005)]. For a set of miRNAs, miRror outputs a ranked
list of gene targets according to their likelihood to be targeted
by the miRNA ensemble and vice versa for a set of regulated
genes. miRror converts all predictor resources results into a
uniﬁed platform by incorporating a statistical measure according
to the hypergeometrical distribution. For example, in miRNAs
overexpressing experiments in human cells (Lim et al., 2005),
174 genes (miR—l24) and 65 genes (miR—l) were downregulated and
were used as input for miRror. The original miRNAs were identiﬁed
as the top candidates with a P—value <3e—ll and with 91—93% of
the genes marked as targets for the relevant miRNA. Similar results
were obtained by using only 50% of the gene lists, supporting the
robustness of the miRror platform.

2 SYSTEM OVERVIEW

miRror is a platform by which an experimentalist can gain
biological insights on sets of molecular entities. Such sets are
the product of large—scale experiments such as miRNA proﬁling,
mass spectrometry proteomics and gene expression data. miRror
operates at a dual mode where ensemble of (i) miRNAs and (ii) gene
targets/proteins are used as the input.

2.1 Prediction tools resources integration

Database ﬁles from multiple miRNA—target prediction resources
were separated to human, mouse and ﬂy. The resources used include
TargetScan, MicroCosm implemented in miRB ase, PicTar, DIANA—
MicroT, PITA, ElMMO—MirZ, miRanda—based microRNA.org,
TargetRank, miRDB and TarBase. miRror combines the resources
following a conversion of the miRNAs and gene targets identiﬁers.
RefSeq and UniProtKB identiﬁers are indicated as the primary
entries. TarB ase used as a validation resource rather then a prediction
database.

2.2 miRtegrate analysis

miRtegrate protocol is the core of miRror (Fig. 1). It calculates
the probability of matches between miRNAs in the user list and
the best set of targets derived from miRNA—target predictions as
reported by each of the selected resources. For each gene, we

take into account the list of miRNAs that were associated with
it. We calculated the probability of the gene’s interaction with the
collection of miRNAs in the user set as opposed to the rest of the
miRNAs in that database. The miRNA—targets coverage associated
with each of the prediction resources is used for the calculation
of a statistical signiﬁcant threshold. We applied a default value of
0.05 as a threshold and calculated the P—value by considering all
probabilities that are more signiﬁcant that the threshold. P—value for
miRNAs as input was performed according to the hypergeometric
distribution with a correction for multiple testing. The same principle
is applied with genes as input. For more details see the ‘Help’ section
of the website.

2.3 Advanced options and ﬁltration

The miRror results are a ranked list of best predicted molecules
(miRNAs or genes, Fig. 1). A reﬁnement of the results is based
on several advanced options. Several background distributions such
as different tissues and cell lines can be applied for the miRtegrate
calculations. Tissues are annotated by the gene expression data from
FlyAtlas (Chintapalli et al., 2007) and GNF atlas (Su et al., 2004).
Using these optional backgrounds, new calculation for the P—value is
activated to account for the apparent difference in coverage. The user
can also select any subset of prediction resources to be used. A
default parameter requires that a target will be selected by at least two
databases. However, an intuitive option for changing the number of
the miRror results is provided to the user by modifying all parameters
(P—value threshold, minimal number of miRNAs that bind to each
of the targets and minimal number of miRNA—target databases).
The web tool provides multiple sorting options, optional ﬁltration
thresholds and downloading options. Furthermore, results that are
experimentally validated in TarBase are highlighted. The user can
forward the results to a set of analysis tools to represent enriched
pathways, networks and functional annotations (Fig. 1).

3 CONCLUSIONS

We present miRror as a novel integration scheme for a dozen of
miRNA—target prediction resources. miRror provides a double— sided
view for ensembles of miRNAs or genes. Based on the notion of
combinatorial regulation adopted by miRror, the reported list of
targets for a miRNAs ensemble is a small subset of the inclusive list
that is produced by the summation of predictors. As some miRNAs
are predicted to pair with hundreds of targets, a reduction to a small
but signiﬁcant set of targets is valuable for the experimentalist.
miRror application towards a set of genes as input is powerful in
proposing potential miRNAs ensemble. Thus, the online tool can
be used to generate hypotheses on the role of a speciﬁc genes or
speciﬁc minimal set of miRNAs in any cellular settings.

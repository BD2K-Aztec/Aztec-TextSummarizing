Abstract

Rationale: The growing recognition of the importance of splicing, together with rapidly accumulat—
ing RNA—sequencing data, demand robust high—throughput approaches, which efficiently analyze
experimentally derived whole—transcriptome splice profiles.

Results: We have developed a computational approach, called SNPlice, for identifying cis—acting,
splice—modulating variants from RNA—seq datasets. SNPlice mines RNA—seq datasets to find reads
that span single—nucleotide variant (SNV) loci and nearby splice junctions, assessing the co—
occurrence of variants and molecules that remain unspliced at nearby exon—intron boundaries.
Hence, SNPlice highlights variants preferentially occurring on intron—containing molecules,
possibly resulting from altered splicing. To illustrate co—occurrence of variant nucleotide and
exon—intron boundary, allele—specific sequencing was used. SNPlice results are generally consist—
ent with splice—prediction tools, but also indicate splice—modulating elements missed by other
algorithms. SNPlice can be applied to identify variants that correlate with unexpected splicing
events, and to measure the splice—modulating potential of canonical splice—site SNVs.

Availability and implementation: SNPlice is freely available for download from https://code.goo

1 Introduction

Alternative splicing is well known as an essential mechanism of gene
regulation which may affect protein function (Braunschweig et 61].,
2013; Singh and Cooper, 2012). To date, ~95% of the mammalian
genes are estimated to be subjected to alternative splicing; current
knowledge explains only a portion of the underlying molecular
events (Barash et 61]., 2010; Bernstein et al., 2012; Moore and Silver,

2008; Pan et 61]., 2008). Most of the knowledge on the splicing was
obtained through alignment of DNA and RNA sequences and sys—
tematic search for functional elements, facilitated by the recent ad—
vances of the sequencing technologies (Bernstein et 61]., 2012;
Barbosa—Morais et 61]., 2012; Clark and Thanaraj, 2002; Liao et 61].,
2005; Merkin et 61]., 2012). Among the major mechanisms affecting
the splicing process are nucleotide changes that disrupt or create

binding sites for splicing, transcriptional and other regulatory fac—
tors (Barash et al., 2010; Bernstein et al., 2012; Barbosa—Morais
et al., 2012; McManus and Graveley, 2011; Merkin et al., 2012;
Moore and Silver, 2008; Pan et al., 2008; Wang and Burge, 2008).
In addition to the four consensus sequences critical for the spliceo—
some assembly—5’ splice site (5’ SS), 3’ SS, the branch sequence, and
the polypyrimidine tract (PPT)—changes in the exonic and intronic
splicing enhancers and silencers (ESE, ISE, ESS and ISS) and other,
less patterned sequences, are increasingly acknowledged as splicing
modulators (De Conti et al., 2013; Woolfe et al., 2010). The emerg—
ing recognition of the importance of splicing has stimulated efforts
for modeling the splice—modulating potential of genetic variants
through probabilistic predictions based on junction nucleotide com—
position, dependencies among neighboring bases, local optimality in
the context of the gene structure, homology alignments, interaction
with splicing factors and comparison with experimentally verified
splice—modulating motifs (Brunak et al., 1991; Brendel and Kleffe,
1998; Dogan et al., 2007; Faber et al., 2011; Kamath et al., 2012;
Pertea et al., 2001; Piva et al., 2012; Riva et al., 2012; Woolfe et al.,
2010; Yeo and Burge, 2004). These approaches helped annotate nu—
merous previously unknown splice—modulating variants; however,
being mostly based on pre—existing knowledge, they may miss vari—
ants acting through unknown mechanisms.

Several recent analyses have highlighted the importance of sys—
tematic, genome—wide evaluation of sequence—specific splicing events
(Barash et al., 2010; Han et al., 2013; Merkin et al., 2012;
Sterne—Weiler and Sanford, 2014). A survey of the splicing patterns
on relatively small genome portion—250 exons in HapMap—geno—
typed individuals—has suggested that common splice—modulating
SNVs can be frequent in the genome (Cheung et al., 2005;
Coulombe—Huntington et al., 2009; Hull et al, 2007). An analysis of
splice—sensitive microarrays demonstrated high frequency of alterna—
tive splicing events within the usually unexplored areas of the
genome, and, at significance levels much below standard multiple—
testing thresholds, implying that the extent of cis—regulated
differential splicing between individuals may be far greater than esti—
mated (ElSharawy et al., 2009). Concurrent with the above are find—
ings from another study, which employs software—SNPSplicer—to
compare matching genomic DNA and complementary DNA
(cDNA) from individuals with different genotypes (ElSharawy et al.,
2006)

We developed a computational approach, SNPlice, which identi-
fies potential splice—modulating variants from RNA—seq data gener—
ated through massively parallel sequencing. SNPlice assesses
sequencing reads for co—occurrence of variant base and a nearby
exon—intron boundary. Given that canonical splicing is expected to
retain predominantly exon—exon junctions in the transcriptome, we
based our strategy on the assumption that transcriptome sequencing
reads harboring an exon—intron boundary indicate a biological pro—
cess of junction alteration and, possibly, altered splicing.

2 Methods

2.1 Samples

SNPlice performance was tested on 65 human RNA—seq datasets
(Supplementary Table S1). Five in—house primary cell lines derived
from Retinal Pigment Epithelia (RPE) of healthy organ donors’ eyes
(Maminiskis et al., 2006), were used for allele—specific sequencing of
selected SNPlice highlighted variants. Sixty matching normal and
tumor datasets from the Cancer Genomic Hub (https://cghub.ucsc.
edu) were used to assess the between—samples variability of SNPlice
findings.

2.2 RNA libraries preparation and sequencing

Total RNA from the RPE primary cell lines was isolated using
standard protocols (TRIzol Reagent, Life Technologies, Foster City,
CA). The libraries were prepared using TruSeq RNA sample prepar—
ation kit (Illumina, Inc.) that includes poly—A selection, according to
the manufacturer recommendations. Paired—end sequencing (5 0nt
read length) was performed on Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform.

2.3 Read alignment and variants call and annotation

The generated and downloaded sequencing datasets were processed
as follows. The paired end raw reads were aligned against hg19
using TopHat2 (Kim et al., 2013), version 2.0.8, with default set—
tings and allowing two mismatches in the alignment. Identical read
sequences mapping to the same loci were counted once per individ—
ual to reduce the potential impact of PCR duplicates on the counts.
Variants’ calls were obtained using the mpileup utility of SAMTools
(http://samtools.sourceforge.net/mpileup—.shtml) (Li et al., 2009).
Base Alignment Quality was used to score the variant calls and con—
sensus calling was done using BCF tools. Maximum depth call was
set at 8000. All variants were subjected to SNPlice. Cufflinks was
used to assemble the transcripts without reference junction annota—
tion; transcript abundance was quantified in fragments per kilobase
per million (FPKM) fragments mapped, as previously described
(Trapnell et al., 2013). The variants were annotated using SeattleSeq
Annotation Tools version 8.01, dbSNP build 138 (http://snp.gs.
washington.edu/SeattleSeq—Annotation138/).

2.4 Computational algorithm

We developed a Python program, SNPlice, using the pysam Python
module to find reads spanning SNV loci and exon—intron bounda—
ries or exon—exon junctions (defined as spanning reads), and quan—
tify the extent of co—occurrence of variant alleles in unspliced reads.
The program identifies reads that span a SNV locus and an exon
boundary within the length of the sequencing read, and classifies
them according to the nucleotide observed at the SNV site
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Reads are further required to extend past
the exon—intron boundary by at least 5 bp to ensure the alignment
can be confidently placed in the adjacent intron or in the following
exon (Supplementary Fig. S2). The length of the alignment of each
read to the reference is then checked—reads whose alignment length
on the reference genome is similar (:2 bp) to the length of the read
are classified as intronic, while those whose alignment length on the
reference genome is similar (: 2bp) to the length of the read plus
the length of the intron are classified as exonic. Reads whose nucleo—
tide at the SNV position do not match either the reference or the al-
ternative base, or whose alignment length does not match these
intronic nor exonic definitions are disregarded, not because they are
uninteresting, but because we must ensure the read counts are not
inﬂated by false—positive or other types of poor alignments. For each
SNV locus and exon—intron boundary, then, we compute four read
counts (Fig. 1): NVARee represents number of reads bearing the vari—
ant nucleotide and mapped across the exon—exon junction, NVARei
represents the number of reads bearing the variant nucleotide and
mapped across the exon—intron boundary, NREFee represents the
number of reads bearing the reference nucleotide and mapped across
the exon—exon junction, and NREFei represents the number of reads
bearing the reference nucleotide and mapped across the exon—intron
boundary. We evaluate these counts in a 2 X 2 contingency table to
assess the spliced versus unspliced status of variant versus reference
allele reads. We compute the traditional log odds—ratio using
pseudocounts of 0.5 to avoid numerical issues with zeros (Gart and

Fig. 1. SNPlice principle. Alignment of reads spanning a potential splice mod-
ulating SNV and an exon-intron boundary, illustrating the SNPlice analytical
strategy. Sequencing reads with variant and reference nucleotide at the SNV
position in the proximity of the boundary are shown (color coded). Variant-
harboring reads often continue in the intron (P: 0.005), indicating association
with potential junction alteration. The double vertical line indicates the first
position of the intron

Zweifel, 1967; Haldane, 1955; Parzen et al., 2002). The log odds—
ratio increases as intronic reads become more enriched in variant al—
lele reads. The statistical significance of the counts is determined
using Fisher’s exact test, which assesses the lack of independence in
the observation of variant and intronic reads. Fisher’s exact test P
values were corrected for multiple trials by estimating the False
Discovery Rate (FDR, Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). SNVs of
interest were visually examined through the Integrative Genome
Viewer IGV (Thorvaldsdottir et al., 2013).

SNPlice is freely available for download from https://code.goo—
gle.com/p—lsnplice/ as a self—contained binary package and as python
source code. SNPlice version 1.7.2 was used for the analyses
described in this paper. The workﬂow is illustrated on Figure 2.
Following analysis of raw reads using Tophat, and Samtools (mpi—
leup utility), the resulting aligned reads (BAM format), junctions
(BED format) and variants (VCF format) are read directly by
SNPlice. Users can choose to include only annotated junctions
through aligning the RNA—seq reads to the reference transcriptome.
Prior to SNPlice, the variants can be annotated using SeattleSeq
(VCF to VCF format)—all SNV annotations are retained in the
SNPlice output. The analysis can be performed on reads from indi-
vidual samples where observed heterozygous variants provide the
basis for SNPlice analysis, or on pooled reads from many samples,
making it possible to study the effect of the variants across heterozy—
gous and homozygous samples.

2.5 Allele—specific Sanger sequencing

We designed allele—specific PCR, followed by Sanger sequencing, to
illustrate the co—occurrence of variant nucleotide and exon—intron
boundary for two of SNPlice highlighted loci. For each allele-
specific PCR, three primers were designed: a common forward
exonic primer to amplify the SNV locus, and two reverse primers
hybridizing in the downstream exon or intron, respectively
(Supplementary Table S2). First—strand cDNA was synthesized with
SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Inc) using 1 ug of
total RNA and mixture of oligo dT primer and random hexamers.
Two separate reactions, amplifying the region containing the SNV,
and either the exon—exon junction, or exon—intron boundary, were
performed in parallel using high fidelity LA Taq DNA polymerase

3 Results

SNPlice processing of 65 human transcriptomes identified 141
unique variants significantly (FDR < 0.05) associated with intronic
reads, 36 of which were observed in two or more unrelated samples
(the 20 top—scored variants are shown in Supplementary Table S3).
Between 0 and 18 variants were found per individual sample; this
number positively correlated with the sequencing depth
(Supplementary Fig. 83A). Comparison between the matched data—
sets revealed that 55% of the variants were called significant by
SNPlice in both normal and tumor dataset; in all cases when the
variant was called in only one of the dataset, this was the set with
higher number of informative reads. We then compared the SNPlice
significant calls across all samples heterozygous for the variant pos—
ition (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Approximately one—third of the vari—
ants were called significant in all heterozygote samples in our
datasets.

To assess SNPlice performance on pools of samples, we com—
bined the read counts across the five RPE RNA—seq datasets and
analyzed the summed counts using the same procedure as in
SNPlice. This analysis identified 33 SNPlice significant variants, as
compared to the 18 found through the individual analysis of the 5
datasets.

Of the 141 variants identified as significant by SNPlice in indi-
vidual samples, 122 were positioned three and more nucleotides
from the boundary of the exon. No correlation was seen between
the distance of the variant to the splice site and the strength of the
association. The most frequently observed nucleotide substitution
(in regards to the sense orientation of the open reading frame) was
C>T; in contrast, very few G>T and T>A substitutions were
observed (Supplementary Fig. S3C). In regards to gene structure,
32% of the exonic SNVs were positioned in an in-frame exon, 14%
in the first exon of the gene, 10% were in the last and 3% were
within the 50 bp upstream of the last exon—exon junction (for at least
one isoform). One SNV was a nonsense variant resulting in a

premature stop codon, 57 were missense substitutions and the rest
were synonymous.

3.1 Assessment of splice—modulating potential of SNVs
highlighted through SNPlice

Illustrative examples of SNPlice highlighted variants are listed in
Table 1. Rs10749291 is a synonymous substitution in exon 4 of the
gene SFXN4 (c.258A> G, p.Q86Q, isoform ENST00000355697).
IGV examination of the heterozygote sample confirmed the variant
nucleotide only within reads encompassing the closest exon—intron
junction, which was an acceptor site located six nucleotides from
the SNV (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, the closest donor site (located 21
nucleotides from the SNV), was also encompassed almost exclu—
sively by reads containing the variant nucleotide, leading to high
proportion of molecules bearing the exon—intron junction on both
sides of the exon (P < 0.001, Fisher’s exact test). No reads bearing
the reference nucleotide were mapped to the intron on either side of
the exon. Next, we examined the homozygote samples for the refer—
ence and variant allele. Consistent with the lack of effect on the
junction, the homozygous reference samples did not show any indi—
cation for alternatively spliced molecules (Fig. 3B). On the contrary,
the homozygous variant samples showed a higher proportion
(P=0.001) of nonspliced reads than observed in the heterozygote
sample (Fig. 3C). Thus, SNPlice identified a variant that confidently
associates with junction alteration, in a manner consistent with al-
lele—quantitative effect.

To assess the potential alternative transcript linked to
rs10749291, we analyzed the assembly of the SFXN4 gene gener-
ated by Cufflinks (Trapnell et al., 2010). Consistent with IGV exam—
ination, the assembly showed presence of an isoform retaining the
introns and the further exons on both sides of exon 4 (Fig. 3D). The
predicted open reading frame expands 50 codons downstream of
exon 3 into intron 3, until it reaches an in—frame stop codon TAA
(Supplementary Fig. S4). Despite being a predicted target of non—
sense mediated mRNA decay (NMD), such an isoform has been iso—
lated from multiple human tissues: (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
IEB/Research/Acembly/av.cgide=human&l:SFXN4.jAug10). It is
predicted to encode a protein of 134 amino acids that contains no
characteristic SFXN4 domain or trans—membrane motifs.
Rs10749291 is a common variant (estimated minor allele frequency,
MAF ~0.49) that has not been previously reported to associate with
splicing alterations. Our data strongly suggest that rs10749291 is
implicated in the generation of the above—described alternative
SFXN4 transcript. We next assessed the modulating potential of
rs10749291 through splice—predictive tools. SplicePort estimated
that the variant diminishes the acceptor strength, SpliceAid2 mod—
eled that the change switches the binding site preference from the
splice-regulator TIA-1 to PPT—binding protein PTB (Cavaloc et al.,
1999; Caputi and Zahler, 2002; Jurica et al., 2002; Supplementary
Fig. 5), and Skippy predicted gain of one new ESS (See Table 1).

Three more exonic variants scored by SNPlice as significant
through individual sample analysis are presented in Table 1.
Rs788023 is a C > T substitution located 7nt from the acceptor of
exon 5 of SF3B1 (Supplementary Fig. 86A). Analysis of the tran—
script assembly of SF3B1 showed the presence of an isoform retain-
ing the intron on the acceptor side of SNV—harboring exon, as well
as the downstream positioned exon—intron—exon structure. SF3B1
isoforms expressing intron 4 as a part of an alternative 5’—UTR are
described, and predicted to encode a partial protein of 345 AA
(http://srv00.ibbe.cnr.it/ASPicDB/newresults.phpPorganismz-human
&job:list4830/job7596). The second variant, rs12004, is situated

8 nt from the acceptor inside exon 4 of KDELR3 (Supplementary
Fig. 6B); the variant nucleotide is modeled to create a new binding
site for the spliceosome component hnRNPK (Caputi and Zahler,
2002). Reads assembly from the same sample showed presence of an
alternative known last exon of KDELR3, present in major protein-
coding KDELR3 isoforms (i.e. CCDS46705 .1). The third SNV,
rs11552262, is located 7 nt from the acceptor inside exon 2 of
TMEM129 (Supplementary Fig. S6C). This variant was predicted to
switch the splice site from acceptor to donor, and to destroy one
existing and create three new ESEs. Reads assembly in the region of
rs11552262 showed very low expression (FPKM < 0.2) of an iso—
form with partial intron retention on the acceptor site of exon 2,
that has not been described before.

The remaining two variants in Table 1, rs114045 8 in NPC1 and
rs1131476 in OASI reached statistical significance only after pool—
ing the reads from the individual samples in the RPE dataset. Both
variants were predicted through SplicePort to destroy existing ca—
nonical splice sites—donor for NPC1, and acceptor for OASI. In
addition, rs1140458 in NPC1 was predicted to lead to loss of a
binding site for the splice factor YB—1 (Ray et al., 2009), and loss of
an exonic enhancer. We decided to further analyze these two vari—
ants through allele—specific Sanger sequencing.

3.2 Allele—specific Sanger sequencing of
variant—boundary sites highlighted by SNPlice

To assess for the SNPlice suggested co—occurrence of variant nucleo—
tide and exon—intron boundary, an AS—RT—PCR was designed to
amplify in parallel the exon—exon junction, and the exon—intron
boundary containing molecules (Supplementary Fig. 87A), for each
of the two selected SNVs (rs1140458 in NPC1 and rs1131476 in
OASI). The resulting Sanger sequencing chromatograms are
shown on Supplementary Figures 87B and 87C, respectively. The
chromatograms were examined for relative signal (peak) of the
variant versus the reference peak in the exon—exon and the exon—
intron amplicons. Ideally, to confirm association of variant nucleo—
tide with intron—containing reads, we anticipate predominant
presence of the variant signal (versus reference) in the chromato—
grams from the exon—intron product, while the reference would be
retained in the canonically spliced exon—exon junction containing
amplicons.

As seen on Supplementary Figures 87B and 87C, the sequencing
confirmed the allele—specific junction alteration that was identified
by SNPlice. The top chromatogram on Supplementary Figure 7B
shows canonically spliced NPC1 fragment (as indicated by the pres—
ence of an exon—exon junction between exons 18 and 19 of NPC1),
and rs1140458 in heterozygous state, as indicated by equally strong
signal from the reference and the variant base. In contrast, ampli—
cons harboring the exon—intron boundary (second from the top
chromatogram on Supplementary Fig. S7B) contained almost exclu—
sively the variant nucleotide peak. The results were consistent with
the reverse primer (Supplementary Fig. S7B, bottom chromato—
grams). Retaining of intron 19 donor sequence into the NPC1 open
reading frame is predicted to result in a stop codon generation im—
mediately after the last codon of exon 18. A protein coding NPC1
isoform terminated after exon 18 has been described (uc010xba,
766 AA, UCSC genes); our results suggest potential involvement of
rs1140458 in the uc010xba formation.

Furthermore, even stronger association with junction alteration
was detected for rs1131476 in OASI. While the canonical splicing
apparently tolerated molecules harboring the rs1140458 variant in
NPC1 (supported by presence of both reference and variant peak in

Fig. 3. Read alignment and assembly in the region of rs10749291. (A) Heterozygote sample: exclusive residing of the variant nucleotide within reads encompass-
ing the exon-intron boundaries on both sides (located 6 and 21 nucleotides from the SNV), is seen. Read abundance shows relatively high proportion of intronic
coverage on both sites of the boundary (arrows). (B) Homozygote reference sample: no reads are encompassing either one of the two boundaries, as also

indicated by the complete absence of intronic coverage. (C) Homozygote variant sample: higher proportion of non-spliced reads, as compared to the
heterozygote sample, supportive for allele-quantitative effect. (D) IGV visualization of the Cufflinks assembly (.gtf) showing the presence of an isoform retain-

ing the introns on both sides of exon 4 of SFXN4 (bottom track); the reference assembly is on the top. The gene orientation is indicated by arrows along

the exon—exon amplicons on Supplementary Fig. S7B), OAS 1 alleles
harboring rs1131476 variant nucleotide, were completely absent in
the canonically spliced RNA product (Supplementary Fig. S7C, top
chromatogram). Similarly to the rs1140458 variant in NPC1,
exon—intron harboring molecules were characterized by sole pres—
ence of the variant peak (Supplementary Fig. S7C, second from the
top chromatogram).

The results were consistent also with the reverse primer
(Supplementary Fig. S7C, bottom chromatograms). Visual examin—
ation of the proximal to rs1131476 sequences of OASI identified
the presence of closely positioned coallelic intronic variant,
rs10774671, located in the canonical acceptor site. From the two
in—phase variants, rs10774671 is more likely to be implicated in
the junction alteration, due to its splice—site location. Without neces—
sarily being involved in the underlying biological process,
the coallelic rs1131476 is indicative of alternatively spliced OASI
alleles, and can potentially serve as a marker in association
analyses. Rs1131476 and rs10774671 are located at the boundary
between intron 5 and exon 6 of OASI (ENST00000202917).
An isoform expressing intron 5 as part of a 3’—UTR downstream
of an alternative earlier OASI last exon is described

(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/Research/Acembly/av.cgidezhu
man&l:OASl.c—Aug10). Whether the detected in our experiment
intron-retaining RNA molecules are part of the described, or of
a novel OASI isoform, is subject of future investigations.
Nevertheless, our data strongly suggest involvement of the
rs1131476 and/or rs10774671 in the generation of an intron retain-
ing expressed OASI isoform. Rs1131476 and rs10774671 illustrate
an important example where SNPlice highlights SNVs physically
linked (in-phase) to other splice—altering features (such as SNVs pos—
itioned in splice—sites, See Supplementary Fig. 87C).

4 Discussion

Until recently, direct assessment of allelic phase for DNA and RNA
features of diploid genomes has been possible mostly through mo—
lecular cloning. Next—generation sequencing technologies are based
on the production of a nearly ideal copy of a single DNA or RNA
molecular segment, commonly termed ‘sequencing read’. Due to the
uninterrupted process of template—based sequencing read gener—
ation, the features of the original molecule are preserved in the copy.
As a consequence, molecular characteristics belonging to the same

molecule, such as variant nucleotide and exon—intron boundary, can
be evaluated in their allelic corelationship, and tools utilizing this
information have began to emerge (Viner et al., 2014). SNPlice util—
izes the allele—specific signal available in the massively parallel
sequencing platforms to assess co-occurrence between variant nu-
cleotide and nearby exon—intron boundaries. Hence, SNPlice high-
lights variants preferentially occurring on intron-containing
molecules, possibly resulting from altered splicing. In addition,
SNPlice considers paired—end sequencing reads, making it possible
to assess longer distance variant—effected splicing. IGV examination
of highlighted loci showed consistent with SNPlice co—occurrence of
variants and junctions, which was further illustrated through allele—
specific Sanger sequencing. Thus, SNPlice provides useful means for
screening of transcriptome reads to identify novel splice altering
variants, and to assess the splice—altering potential of splice—site pos—
itioned substitutions. Furthermore, SNPlice analysis of RNA—seq
datasets from diseased tissues can identify rare pathogenic variants
that are currently considered neutral due to lack of evidence for ef—
fect on the protein function. Finally, comparing SNPlice findings be-
tween groups of patients and controls could identify disease—
implicated splicing deregulation.

Applying SNPlice, we were able to identify variants that select—
ively reside in alternatively spliced RNA molecules; the harboring
motifs are to be submitted to SpliceAid—F (Giulietti et al., 2013).
Cufﬂinks assembly of the reads in the SNV region suggested expres—
sion of alternative isoforms, in some cases, expressed at protein
level. Most of these isoforms have been previously annotated
through independent experiments, thus supporting the expression of
the intron-retaining RNA molecules identified in our study.
However, the described SNVs have never been directly linked to the
expression of these particular isoforms. In this regard, SNPlice offers
an experimentally based tool to identify novel relationships between
encoded and expressed genomic layers.

Relatively few splice—site positioned variants (i.e. within the
two nucleotides immediate to the boundary) were scored signifi—
cant through SNPlice. This is not surprising, as many variants
with strong effect on the splicing are expected to be eliminated
through the evolutionary selection. One additional explanation is
that, if the junction alteration creates a frame—shift, molecules bear—
ing the alternative junction and the variant nucleotide may be
degraded through nonsense—mediated mRNA decay (NMD). While
this is expected to eliminate or reduce the number of variant—bearing
reads, such an effect is difficult to assess using RNA data alone.
However, splice—modulating variants that lead to NMD can be de—
tected through SNPlice assessment of cell cultures under experimen-
tally inhibited NMD.

Currently, the genome—scale splice—modulating potential of SNVs
is estimated mostly through modeling tools built on knowledge
derived from gene— or variant—focused experiments. Comparative
analysis of selected significant variants from SNPlice results through
SplicePort, SpliceAid2 and Skippy, were concordant with at least
one of the three tools. Some variants, however, did not seem to af—
fect known donors or acceptors, or to alter known binding motif or
ESE. Because SNPlice assesses empirically derived data, it may high-
light variants acting through unknown mechanisms, which are not
currently implemented in the predictive pipelines.

Individual SNPlice assessment of the transcriptomes in our data—
set identified between 0 and 18 heterozygous variants per sample
associated with junction alteration at false discovery threshold
0.05. Because the statistical analyses are based on transcriptome
sequencing read counts, the computed values are linked to the cover—
age (resp. expression levels) at the particular locus. Therefore, for

many loci, strong statistical significance is unlikely to be reached
due to relatively low number of reads, which can also explain the in-
complete consistency between the matching normal and tumor data—
set. For example, the two wet—lab validated SNVs reached
significance only through pooled analysis, and not in any individual
sample. An approach to address low read number is to combine the
read counts from multiple samples to be processed through SNPlice
as a whole. As illustrated, the combined approach increased the
number of significant SNVs, at the same time retaining most of
the variants identified through the individual analysis. An additional
inherent advantage of the combined approach is that it considers the
reads from homozygote samples, thus increasing the count of in—
formative reads. This is especially applicable to intronic variants,
which, if exerting a strong effect on splicing, naturally tend to ap—
pear as mono—allelic expression in the transcriptome (see
Supplementary Fig. S7C). However, pooling reads from different
samples needs to be applied with caution, as it assumes identical
splicing regulation, and eliminates the uniqueness of splice factors
and conditions that may be directly linked to the involvement of the
particular variant in the splice alteration.

An inherent advantage of SNPlice is its immediate link to the em—
pirical data. As the perspective on splicing turns into highly dy-
namic, condition—specific mechanism, SNPlice is poised to support
cell— and tissue—specific analyses through individual transcriptome
assessment, as well as to study dynamic, pathogenic and develop—
mental splicing patterns. In addition, since cells typically coordinate
numerous changes in ‘splicing programs’ (Braunschweig et al.,
2013) analyzing the whole transcriptome can capture splice changes
in their mutual dependencies. Finally, being based on read counts,
SNPlice provides means for quantitative estimations of the splice
changes across multiple samples. Application of the pipeline to
large—scale datasets is expected to reveal multiple new splice
modulating SNVs, which in turn, may highlight novel splice regula-
tory mechanisms or disease implicated genetic changes. In addition,
SNPlice provides an innovative strategy to re—visit the splice—modu—
lating potential of SNVs located in canonical sequences that are
traditionally considered critical for splicing regulation.

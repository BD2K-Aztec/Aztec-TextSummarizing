Editorial
lSMB/ECCB 2015

This special issue of Bioinformatics serves as the proceedings of the
joint 23rd annual meeting of Intelligent Systems for Molecular
Biology (ISMB) and 14th European Conference on Computational
Biology (ECCB), which took place in Dublin, Ireland, July 10—14,
2015 (http://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2015). ISMB/ECCB 2015, the
official conference of the International Society for Computational
Biology (ISCB, http://www.iscb.org/), was accompanied by nine
Special Interest Group meetings of 1 or 2 days each, and two satel-
lite meetings. Since its inception, ISMB/ECCB has been the largest
international conference in computational biology and bioinfor-
matics. It is the leading forum in the field for presenting new re-
search results, disseminating methods and techniques, and
facilitating discussions among leading researchers, practitioners,
and students in the field. The 42 papers in this volume were selected
from 241 original submissions divided into 13 research areas, col-
lectively led by 25 Area Chairs. For each area, the Area Chairs se-
lected an expert program committee for their subdiscipline and
oversaw the reviewing process for that area. By design, the Area
Chairs included a mix of experienced individuals reappointed from
previous years and experts newly recruited to ensure broad tech-
nical expertise and to promote inclusivity of various elements of the
research community. In total, the review process involved the 25
Area Chairs, 378 program committee members, and an additional

175 external reviewers recruited as sub-reviewers by program com-
mittee members. Table 1 provides a summary of the areas, area
chairs and a review summary by area. The conference used a two-
tier review system—a continuation and refinement of a process that
begun with ISMB/ECCB 2013 in an effort to better ensure thorough
and fair reviewing. Under the revised process, each of the 241 sub-
missions was first reviewed by at least three expert referees, with a
subset receiving between four and six reviews, as needed.
Consensus on each paper was reached through online discussion
among reviewers and Area Chairs. Among the 241 submissions, 27
were conditionally accepted for publication directly from the first
round review. A subset of 29 papers was viewed as potentially pub-
lishable subject to revision and re-review of the manuscripts. Of the
27 papers that were resubmitted, 15 were judged to have addressed
the concerns of the reviewers and were accepted for the conference
proceedings, resulting in a total of 42 acceptances and an overall
acceptance rate of 42/241 = 17.4%. We believe that this two-tier
system, which is more reﬂective of typical multi-round journal re-
view procedures, provided a means of ensuring that only the high-
est quality original work was accepted within the tight timing
constraints imposed by the conference scheduling. We thank all
authors for submitting their work. These proceedings would sim-
ply not be possible without the scientific ingenuity of the

contributors of all the papers. We recognize that the process is not
perfect, and some outstanding work might have been rejected des-
pite our best efforts. Nonetheless, we are hopeful that all authors
received helpful feedback on their work and that most believed
their submissions were judged fairly and diligently. In total, the
two-tier review process involved 896 individual reviews. We are im-
mensely grateful to the Area Chairs, the members of the program
committee and the external subreviewers for their outstanding efforts
in conducting a thorough review process in just 3 months. Their con-
tribution is at the core of the scientific quality of the conference. We
also thank Steven Leard for his continuing support with the review
process; the team at Oxford University Press for preparing this spe-
cial proceedings volume and the Conference Chairs, Janet Kelso and
Alex Bateman, the Theme Chairs and other members of the ISMB

Steering Committee for their advice and supervision. We are also
grateful to Russell Schwartz, Proceedings Chair of ISMB 2014, for
sharing his experience and various helpful documents on the review
process.

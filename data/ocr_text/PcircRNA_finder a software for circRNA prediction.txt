Abstract

Motivation: Recent studies reveal an important role of non—coding circular RNA (circRNA) in the
control of cellular processes. Because of differences in the organization of plant and mammal gen—
omes, the sensitivity and accuracy of circRNA prediction programs using algorithms developed for

animals and humans perform poorly for plants.

Results: A circRNA prediction software for plants (termed PcircRNA_finder) was developed that is
more sensitive in detecting circRNAs than other frequently used programs (such as find_circ and
ClRCeprorer), Based on analysis of simulated and real rRNA—lRNAase R RNA—Seq data from
Arabidopsis thaliana and rice PcircRNA_finder provides a more comprehensive sensitive, precise

prediction method for plants circRNAs.

1 Introduction

Non—coding circular RNA (circRNA) is a covalently continuous
closed loop that usually originates from exonic regions (named
exonic circRNA), but can also arise from intronic and intergenic re-
gions. CircRNAs can function as a miRNA sponge (Hansen et al.,
2013; Memczak et al., 2013) and have the potential to enhance tran—
scription of their host genes (Li et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2013).
The emergence of rRNA—depleted high—throughput RNA—Seq tech—
nology provides a revolutionary approach for the systematic discov—
ery of circRNAs in various species, including human, mouse,
Arabidopsis and rice (Lu et al., 2015; Ye et al., 2015).

A robust method for circRNA identification is an important tool
for investigating the role of these molecules. The available circRNA
prediction methods (e.g. find_circ and CIRCeXplorer) were primar-
ily developed for use with human or animal datasets (Memczak
et al., 2013; Pan and Xiong, 2015; Salzman et al., 2013; Szabo
et al., 2015 ; Zhang et al., 2014). There are large differences between
mammal and plant genomes and therefore the prediction accuracy

and sensitivity of detecting circRNAs in plants using the currently
available methods are relatively low (Ye et al., 2015). In this study,
we developed a software (termed PcircRNA_finder) that shows a
more comprehensive ability and greater sensitivity and precision in
predicting circRNAs in plants.

2 Materials and Methods

PcircRNA_finder is mainly designed for exonic circRNA prediction
and consists of three modules as shown in Figure 1. These modules
are: (i) Catcher, which is used to collect all backsplice sites by chias—
tic clipping mapping of PE reads based on available main fusion de—
tection methods, including Tophat—Fusion (Kim and Salzberg,
2011), STAR-Fusion (Dobin, et al., 2013), find_circ (Memczak
et al., 2013), Mapsplice (Wang et al., 2010) and segemehl
(Hoffmann et al., 2014). Among these candidate backsplice sites,
false positive sites will be filtered out in the Filter module. The
increased read mapping accuracy in our program excludes some

false predictions dues to the high copy number of genes in plants
(Supplementary Data). (ii) Annotator, that can be used to annotate
the candidate exonic backsplice sites based on available gene anno—
tation. Recent studies have demonstrated that circRNA’s backsplic—
ing site is flexible and alternative splicing of circRNAs is prevalent
(Starke et al., 2015; Szabo et al., 2015). Much of the alternative
splicing of circRNAs occurred near by canonical splicing sites
(Szaboet al., 2015 ; Starke et al., 2015) and therefore, 5 -bp flanking
the two canonical backsplice sites (acceptor and donor) were
allowed for our candidate backsplice sites and (iii) Filter, which is a
quality control module for the above candidate circRNAs. It creates
a pseudoRef file with the ﬂanking sequences of chiastic backsplice
sites and then maps raw reads to it and confirms the backsplice sites.
It also requires that the candidate circRNAs contain at least one of
two kinds of splicing signals, either a U2 based spliceosome (usually
with a consensus sequence of GT—AG and GC—AG) and a U12—based
minor spliceosome (usually with a consensus sequence of AT—AC)
(Reddy et al., 2013; Staiger and Brown, 2013).

3 Benchmark

To test the performance of PcircRNA_finder, we first compare it
with two popular circRNA finding algorithms (find_circ and
CIRCexplorer) using a simulation dataset for the analysis.
Simulated RNA—Seq data (paired end reads, 100 bp and 6000 back—
splicing reads for each sample) were generated by randomly choos—
ing 200 chiastic transcripts based upon the Arabidopsis thaliana and
rice genome annotations, respectively (Supplementary Data). The
sensitivity, precision and sensitivity —l— precision (a comprehensive
value) (Chuang et al., 2016) was used to evaluate the performance
of the three methods. The results indicate that PcircRNA_finder has
a higher sensitivity (74—88%) than either find_circ or CIRCexplorer
(each about 20%) and better precision (63—67%) compared to find_
circ and CIRCexplorer, (72 and 100%, respectively) in the two test
genomes (Supplementary Data). Finally, PcircRNA_finder obtained
a significantly higher comprehensive value in the two test plant spe—
cies (6 8—76%), compared to the other two methods (each <35 %).
Transcriptomic data were generated from three RNA—Seq libraries
(‘RNAase R’, ‘rRNA—’ and ‘polyA’) of rice seedlings (Supplementary

Data). ‘RNAase R’ refers to linear mRNAs isolated from the rice seed—
lings that were degraded by RNAase R treatment (Circle—Seq, Jeck
and Sharpless, 2014). CircRNAs in the various samples were pre—
dicted using all three circRNA prediction methods. Using PcircRNA_
finder, we found 1,113 circRNAs in the RNAase R sample compared
to 915 and 933 predicted by find_circ and CIRCexplorer, respectively.
Of the circRNAs detected by PcircRNA_finder, 567 were not found
using the other prediction programs. We define high—confidence
circRNAs as those predicted circRNAs found in common between the
‘RNAase R’ and ‘rRNA—’ libraries, but not present in the ‘polyA’ li-
brary. Based on this definition, PcircRNA_finder predicted more high-
confidence circRNAs from the rice RNA—Seq data sample (117) than
either of the other two methods (104 and 74) (Supplementary Data).

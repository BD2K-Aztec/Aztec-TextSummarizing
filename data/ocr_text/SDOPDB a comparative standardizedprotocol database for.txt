ABSTRACT

Summary: This article reports the development of SDOP-DB, which
can provide definite, detailed and easy comparison of experimental
protocols used in mouse phenotypic analyses among institutes or
laboratories. Because SDOP-DB is fully compliant with international
standards, it can act as a practical foundation for international
sharing and integration of mouse phenotypic information.

1 INTRODUCTION

Recent progress in functional genomics has resulted in an enormous
volume of experimental data in the biomedical ﬁeld. In this context,
standardized data formats to describe laboratory workﬁows are
essential for effective archiving and sharing of experimental results.
For example, the Functional Genomics Experiment (FuGE) models
the components of an experimental activity that are common
across different technologies including protocols, samples and
data (Jones et al., 2007). Also, the Ontology for Biomedical
Investigations (OBIs) provide an integrated ontology for the
description of life science and clinical investigations (http://obi—
ontology.org/page/Main_Page). Although both the FuGE and OBI
provide general components to describe experimental protocols,
there has been little effort to provide domain—speciﬁc components
to directly compare differences between protocols for speciﬁc
experimental assays.

For that purpose, we have developed a new data format termed
Standardized Description of Operating Procedures (SDOPs), which
provides an assay—speciﬁc descriptive framework and enables direct
and detailed comparison of procedural parameters. Using this data
format, this work presents a comparative standardized—protocol

database, SDOP—DB (http://www.brc.riken.jp/lab/bpmp/SDOP/), as
a practical application to share, compare and evaluate the contents
of protocols to enable data comparisons and analyses in the ﬁeld of
large—scale mouse phenotyping.

2 DEVELOPMENT OF SDOP-DB
2.1 Development of the SDOP format

There is a long history of and extensive evidentiary support for using
the mouse to study function within the mammalian genome and to
model human disease. To contribute to comprehensive unraveling
of the relationship between gene and phenotype as well as gene and
disease, we focused on large—scale mouse phenotypic assessments
such as the Japan Mouse Clinic (JMC, Wakana et al., 2009) and the
European Mouse Disease Clinic (EUMODIC, http://www.eumodic
.org/), which have produced a large volume of phenotyping data
for characteristics such as morphology, behavior and pathology. We
developed the SDOP format for each of the phenotyping analyses
from these projects to provide a foundation for interpretation of the
phenotype data. The SDOP targets 16 mouse phenotypic analyses
that are common between JMC and EUMODIC.

To provide users with a better understanding of detailed protocol
descriptions, we ﬁrst developed the common framework of the
SDOP format for any mouse phenotypic analyses by using
elements deﬁned in the XML schemata, ‘Phenotyping Procedures
Markup Language (PPML, http://www.interphenome.org/ppxml/
ppml_vl_3.html)’ and ‘Standard Operating Procedure Markup
Language (SOPML, Green et al., 2005)’. Based on the common
framework, ‘assay—speciﬁc SDOPs’ for the 16 phenotypic analyses
were then developed by adding appropriate elements according to
each detailed description of standardized protocols used in JMC
and EUMODIC through thorough consultation with analysis experts
from JMC (refer to Fig. 1). In principle, each of assay—speciﬁc
SDOPs covers all contents of its standardized protocols.

2.2 Implementation and user interface

The cross—browser JavaScript user interface of SDOP—DB was
constructed using the dhtnilereeGrid API, which provides

tree—like display in the left—most column enables easy navigation of protocol
contents. The tree view shown here is used for all 16 phenotypic analyses.
Clicking on an item in the tree view takes users to a more detailed view of the
selected item. Users can easily access phenotype databases such as ‘Pheno—
Pub’ in JMC and ‘EuroPhenome’ in EUMODIC through hyperlinks. If the
parameter descriptions within a row differ among institutes/laboratories, the
row is represented in pink, as shown above. Clicking on ‘Expand all’ tab,
users can see all the differences. The example shown is for the SDOP of

components designed to represent tabular data in hierarchical
view (http://dhtmlx.com/docs/products/dhtnﬂxTreeGridl). In the
hierarchical view, users can click on individual parameters to
expand the view to show more detailed breakdowns of the selected
parameters. Each parameter of the experimental assays in this view
represents the direct comparison of its values in different protocols
(Fig. 1, see legend). The data description in each SDOP format is
performed with MS—Excel and is then converted to XML format
for dhtnilereeGrid representation using a custom—developed VBA
program embedded in the Excel ﬁle. Users can download the Excel,
XML and tab—delimited text versions of the SDOP data from the
web page.

3 DISCUSSION

To ensure the integration and sharing of experimental data with high
reliability, we have developed an unprecedented database, SDOP—
DB, enabling users to directly compare detailed protocol differences
among institutes/laboratories (refer to Supplementary Figure S1).
The Mouse Phenotype Database Integration Consortium
(InterPhenome, The Mouse Phenotype Database Integration
Consortium, 2007) has proposed a draft version of Minimal
Information to describe Mouse Phenotyping Procedures (MIMPPs,
http://mibbi.org/index.php/Projects/MIMPP). As one of the MIMPP
data models, the PPML format, which is an XML schema used
to describe a phenotyping procedure, is also proposed as the
international standard data model. Because the assay—speciﬁc

SDOPs were developed in complete compliance with the MIMPP
and PPML, they are in accordance with international standards for
data exchange. All of the SDOP formats are openly available on the
web site to facilitate discussion on developing a common format for
sharing and comparing detailed experimental protocol information
among research communities. We propose that these SDOP formats
can be used as a tool for protocol version management both within
and between laboratories. Therefore, the SDOP—DB has the potential
to function as an information infrastructure for the international
sharing and integration of phenotyping protocols in mice, as well as
in broader research communities.

The SDOP—DB is also helpful for identifying procedural
parameter(s) that can result in differences in data between
different protocols. Users can easily access phenotype data
through hyperlinks to mouse phenotype databases such as
‘Pheno—Pub’ (http://www.brc.riken.jp/lab/jmc/mouse_clinic/en/m—
strain_en.html) in JMC and ‘EuroPhenome’ (Morgan et al., 2010;
http://www.europhenome.org/databrowser/baselineViewer.j sp) in
EUMODIC, allowing association of the data with each user’s own
in—house data (refer to Supplementary Figure S2).

We are now preparing the SDOP—DB data in the PPML format,
and further plan to expand SDOP—DB to cover all 33 phenotypic
analyses that are included in high—throughput phenotyping pipelines
of JMC and EUMODIC. For all analyses to be covered in SDOP—
DB, users can submit in—house standardized protocols by ﬁlling in
MS—Excel form downloaded from the web site.

In addition, we are now planning to annotate all the data ﬁelds and
parameters in SDOP with ontologies such as Experiment ACTions
(EXACT), enabling protocol data to be compared and integrated
computationally. Therefore, the parameterization in SDOP would
be an essential approach for the integration of protocol data with
ontologies.

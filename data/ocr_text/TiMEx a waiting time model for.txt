Abstract

Motivation: Despite recent technological advances in genomic sciences, our understanding of can—
cer progression and its driving genetic alterations remains incomplete.

Results: We introduce TiMEx, a generative probabilistic model for detecting patterns of various degrees
of mutual exclusivity across genetic alterations, which can indicate pathways involved in cancer pro—
gression. TiMEx explicitly accounts for the temporal interplay between the waiting times to alterations
and the observation time. In simulation studies, we show that our model outperforms previous methods
for detecting mutual exclusivity. On large—scale biological datasets, TiMEx identifies gene groups with
strong functional biological relevance, while also proposing new candidates for biological validation.
TiMEx possesses several advantages over previous methods, including a novel generative probabilistic
model of tumorigenesis, direct estimation of the probability of mutual exclusivity interaction, computa—
tional efficiency and high sensitivity in detecting gene groups involving low—frequency alterations.
Availability and implementation: TiMEx is available as a Bioconductor R package at vwwv.

1 Introduction

Despite recent technological advances in genomic sciences, our
understanding of cancer progression still faces fundamental chal—
lenges. To this end, new ways of interpreting the increasing amount
of generated data are devised, aiming at finding biologically relevant
patterns. An important example is the separation of genes into driv—
ers, which have a selective advantage and significantly contribute
to tumor progression and passengers, which are selectively neutral
and can hitchhike along with fitter clones. Even if intuitive and rou—
tinely used, identifying drivers as recurrently altered genes (Sjoblom
et 61]., 2006) only explains tumorigenesis in a fraction of patients.
Alternatively, the functional role of drivers can be assessed in the
context of groups of genes, all possessing the same important func—
tion, commonly known as pathways. Once one of the group mem—
bers is altered, the tumor gains a significant selective advantage.

The alteration of additional group members does not further in—
crease the selective advantage of the tumor, rendering clones with a
single alteration likely the most frequent. In this case, the group of
genes displays a mutually exclusive alteration pattern.

Current approaches for detecting mutual exclusivity are either
de novo (Ding et 61]., 2008; Jerby—Arnon et 61]., 2014; Leiserson
et 61]., 2013; Miller et 61]., 2011; Szczurek and Beerenwinkel, 2014;
Vandin et 61]., 2012; Yeang et 61]., 2008) or based on biological inter—
action networks (Ciriello et 61]., 2012). While highly informative, the
current biological knowledge is incomplete, such that limiting the
search space to known biological interactions significantly reduces
the detection power. Straightforward pairwise statistical tests assess—
ing whether the number of observed double mutants is lower than
expected by chance have also been employed, followed by identify—
ing groups as maximal cliques (Ciriello et 61]., 2012; Yeang et 61].,

2008). The Dendrix tool (Vandin et 61]., 2012) performs a Markov
chain Monte Carlo sampling for group structure search, followed by
a permutation test for finding sets of genes with both high coverage
and high exclusivity. Its limitation of finding the single main path-
way per dataset was addressed by Multidendrix (Leiserson et 61].,
2013), a follow—up tool which simultaneously identifies multiple
driver pathways via an integer linear programming approach.
Szczurek and Beerenwinkel (2014) propose muex, a statistical model
for mutual exclusivity, where, however, the group members are
required to have similar alteration frequencies. Finally, Jerby-Arnon
et al. (2014) employ a data—driven approach for identifying genome-
wide synthetic lethality interactions in cancer, which lead to mutual
exclusivity. All existing approaches ignore the fact that the mutually
exclusive patterns occur over time, during disease progression.

Here, we introduce TiMEx, a generative probabilistic model for
the de novo detection of mutual exclusivity patterns of various de—
grees across carcinogenic alterations. We regard tumorigenesis as a
dynamic process and base our model on the temporal interplay be—
tween the waiting times to alterations, characteristic for every gene
and alteration type and the observation time. Under the assumption
of rarity of events over short time intervals, TiMEx models the alter—
ation process for each gene as a Poisson process. The waiting times
are therefore modeled as exponentially distributed variables with
specific rates, which correspond to the rates of evolution for each al—
teration. In our modeling framework, the temporal dynamics of
each alteration process progresses from the onset of cancer, corres—
ponding to the first alteration related to the growth of a malignant
tumor, until the observation time, corresponding to the time of
tumor biopsy. The observation time is regarded as a system failure
time and is exponentially distributed with an unknown rate.

A perfectly mutually exclusive group is defined as a collection of
genes in which, for every tumor sample, at most one gene is altered.
Conversely, we assume that in a group showing no mutual exclusiv—
ity, each gene is altered conditionally independent, given the obser—
vation time. In a realistic biological setting, however, additional
alterations may still provide a small selective advantage to the
tumor, rather than none at all, which may lead to the fixation of a
clone with more than one alteration, in a group of genes otherwise
perfectly mutually exclusive. Thus, biologically, groups of genes dis—
play a continuous range of mutual exclusivity degrees. TiMEx quan—
tifies these degrees exactly and assesses their significance using a
likelihood ratio test. Our procedure for efficient search of mutually
exclusive patterns in large datasets consists of three steps (Fig. 1).
We first estimate mutual exclusivity between all possible gene pairs

in the dataset. Second, we select as candidates the gene groups in
which the significance and degree of mutual exclusivity between
each pair of members are high. Third, the candidate groups are stat—
istically tested for mutual exclusivity.

In simulation studies, we show that TiMEx outperforms the per—
mutation—based method previously introduced by Vandin et al.
(2012) and the muex model (Szczurek and Beerenwinkel, 2014).
Furthermore, we apply our procedure to four large TCGA studies,
two glioblastoma datasets, ovarian (Cancer Genome Atlas Research
Network, 2011) and breast (provisional) cancer datasets. On these
datasets, we show that TiMEx identifies gene groups with stronger
functional biological relevance than two previous methods, namely
muex and Multidendrix, while also proposing many new candidates
for biological validation. TiMEx does not impose any temporal as—
sumptions on the set of biological samples it is applied on, and these
samples are considered to be independent. Without requiring any
previous biological knowledge, our procedure identifies mutually
exclusive gene groups of any size and statistically tests and ranks
them by their degree of mutual exclusivity. It possesses several ad—
vantages over previous methods, including the probabilistic model-
ing of tumorigenesis as a dynamic process, the novel and intuitive
quantification of the degree of mutual exclusivity as a probability,
high computational efficiency on large datasets, as well as high sen—
sitivity in detecting low frequently altered genes.

2 Methods
2.1 Probabilistic model

We consider 11 genes indexed by N = {1, 2, . . . ,n}, whose alteration
statuses are represented by the vector of binary random variables
X : (X1,X2,  ,Xn), recorded at
TobS N Exp(20bs). The waiting times to alteration of the 11 genes are

observation time

represented by the vector of random variables T : (T1, T2, . . . , T”),
where T,- N Exp(2,-), for all i E N. For a given tumor sample, we
refer to an instantiation of X, namely (x1,  ,xn), as a genotype,
where x,- E {0,1}, for all i E N. Moreover, for any set of indices
K C N with cardinality |K|, we denote by gK the genotype for which
positions with indices in K are equal to 1 and positions with indices
in N \ K are equal to 0. The presence of an alteration event in a
tumor sample signifies both its occurrence in one of the tumor cells
and its fixation in the measured population, such that the alteration
is observed at screening. Let D denote M independent observations

consisting of M samples and kgenes, the degree of mutual exclusivity ,u,-,- and the Pvalue for testing [1,775 0 against ,u,-l- = 0 are estimated for all gene pairs (i, j).
Second, candidate groups are identified as maximal cliques of genes sharing a significant minimum degree of mutual exclusivity (satisfying the thresholds ppair
and ,upai, for each edge). Finally, the candidate groups are statistically tested for mutual exclusivity and the degree of mutual exclusivity corresponding to each

group is estimated and tested for significance

hood Of the data D under the nested null and mutual exclusivity
models introduced below. As the observations are independent, the
likelihood Of the data under any model 0 is

2.1.1 Null model
The null model (Fig. 2A), parameterized by 0Nu11=(21,22, ...,
in, 201,5), assumes that alterations in the n genes are conditionally in-
dependent from each other, given the observation time Tobs. The
condition for observing an alteration in a gene i is that its corres—
ponding waiting time is shorter than or equal tO the observation
time: if T,- g Tobs, then X,- = 1, otherwise X,- = 0.

The genotype g9) is observed if the observation time is shorter
than the waiting times Of all alterations. Therefore, T01,S is the min-
imum Of n —l— 1 competing exponentials, and

Any genotype gK with K 7E 0 is observed if the waiting times Of
alterations present in the sample, T,, for all i E K, are shorter than
the observation time, and the waiting times Of alterations nOt pre—
sent in the sample, T,, for all i E N \ K, are longer than the Obser—
vation time.

The probability that the observation time is shorter than the
waiting times Of unobserved alterations is nOt influenced by the spe—
cific order between the waiting times Of those alterations. Therefore,
P(gK|0Nu11) further equals the sum Of the probabilities Of all
possible specific orders Of waiting times Of observed alterations.

As the observations D contain no temporal information, the
model HNuu is unidentifiable.

PROPOSITION 2.1: The null model HNuu : (21,22,  ,inJobs) is
identiﬁable only up to 201,5.

For the prOOf, see Supplementary Methods. After setting
20b, : 1 (without loss Of generality), equivalent tO scaling the wait—
ing time rates by 20b5, the reparameterized null model HNuu : (21, 22,

. ,2”) becomes identifiable.

2.1.2 Mutual exclusivity model

In the mutual exclusivity model (Fig. 2B), the n genes are assumed tO
contribute tO the same biological function, such that, up tO various
degrees Of mutual exclusivity, only one member is necessary and suf—
ficient tO be altered for cancer tO progress. An increasing mutual ex—
clusivity interaction in the group directly leads tO an increasing
fixation probability Of a single alteration, corresponding tO the gene
with the shortest waiting time. The degree Of mutual exclusivity Of a
group Of n genes with indices in N, denoted by MN, is the probability
that the group is perfectly mutually exclusive. ,uN can also be inter—
preted as the fractional increase in the fixation probability Of the
genotypes with a single alteration, when more than one gene in the
group were altered before Observation time, but, due tO the mutual
exclusivity interaction between the genes in the group, only the one
with the shortest waiting time fixates. The fixation Of alterations Of
further genes is suppressed with probability MN. Consequently,
1 — ,uN represents the probability Of deviating from perfect mutual
exclusivity, and for MN —> 0, the mutual exclusivity model is reduced
tO the null model.

The mutual exclusivity model is parameterized by
0MB : (21,22,  ,in,20bs,uN). The probability Of Observing the
genotype g9) is the same as in the null model, as the lack Of fixated
alterations is uninformative for detecting mutual exclusivity,

ieN

Any genotype gK with a single alteration, i.e. with |K| : 1, can
be Observed either because K is a mutually exclusive group or be—
cause, by chance, the process Of tumorigenesis has been Observed at
the specific pOint in time when the waiting time Of a single alteration
was shorter than the Observation time. Hence, the probability Of
Observing gK is the weighted sum Of the marginal probability that
TK is the shortest waiting time among all waiting times and the
probability that the Observed alteration pattern happened in the ab—
sence Of mutual exclusivity interaction between the genes. The first
term represents the probability computed under perfect mutual ex—
clusivity and is weighted by ,uN, while the second represents the

Furthermore, Observing any genotype gK with |K| > 2, i.e. any
genotype with more than one alteration, is considered a deviation
from perfect mutual exclusivity. The probability Of Observing each
extra alteration equals the probability that its waiting time is shorter
than the Observation time, weighted by 1 — ,uN, the probability Of

model, after setting 20b, : 1 (without loss Of generality), the repara—
meterized mutual exclusivity model 0MB : (21,22,  ,2”, MN) be—

comes identifiable.

2.1.3 Parameter estimation and testing

The maximum likelihood estimates Of all parameters are Obtained
by setting tO zerO the corresponding first derivative Of the Observed
log likelihood, numerically approximated using the gradient projec—
tion method (Byrd et al., 1995) (Supplementary Figs S1 and S2). An
exception is the case n22, which allows for an analytical solution
for HNuu (the estimates are given in Supplementary Methods).

PROPOSITION 2.3: If n :2, then there exists a closed-form solution
for the maximum likelihood estimates of 21 and 22 under the null
model HNuu.

TO test for any degree Of mutual exclusivity interaction among
the n genes, we are testing the alternative hypothesis ,uN 7E 0 versus
the null hypothesis ,uN : 0. The logarithm Of the ratiO Of the two
likelihoods computed for the maximum likelihood estimates is 12
distributed with one degree Of freedom (Neyman and Pearson,
1992). The likelihood ratiO test statistic is well behaved, as under
the null hypothesis, the P values are uniformly distributed
(Supplementary Fig. S3).

2.2 Overall procedure and computational complexity

Our procedure consists Of three steps. Given a large dataset Of la
genes, we first test all ( 2) pairs for mutual exclusivity, estimating
HNuu and 0MB for each pair. The computational complexity Of this
step is (9(122). Second, we construct an undirected graph in which
genes are vertices and an edge is drawn between any pair (i, j) if, for
chosen thresholds ppair and upair, the P value pi,- g ppair and the de—
gree Of mutual exclusivity nil-2 The thresholds are chosen
based on the sensitivity and specificity levels tO which they corres—

iupair '

pond, as assessed in simulated data. Further, we produce group

candidates by listing all maximal cliques in the constructed graph.
TO this end, we use the Bron—Kerbosch recursive backtracking algO—
rithm (Bron and Kerbosch, 1973). The upper bound on the running
time Of the Bron—Kerbosch algorithm is (9(3k/3  However, in prac—
tice, it is highly efficient (Cazals and Karande, 2008). Finally, we
test the candidate groups for mutual exclusivity and select the ones
for which the Bonferroni corrected P value is lower than a chosen
cutoff. Because Of the cubic complexity Of matrix inversion (in
standard Gauss—Jordan elimination) employed by the numerical op—
timization routine (Byrd et al., 1995), the complexity Of the last step
has an upper bound Of (9(sqq3), where q is the maximal identified
clique size and sq is the number Of maximal cliques Of size q.

3 Results

3.1 Simulations

We assessed the behavior and performance Of TiMEx on simulated
data, by varying the waiting time rates Of the genes, the degrees Of
mutual exclusivity Of the group and the sample sizes. Specifically,
the values Of the sample size M were 300, which is similar tO the size
Of the ovarian cancer dataset, 1000, similar tO the size Of the breast
cancer dataset, and 4000, which is a realistic estimate for the size Of
genomic datasets in the near future. The degrees Of mutual exclusiv—
ity used for simulations were ,u E {0,0.2,0.4,0.5,0.6,0.8, 1}. We
compared the performance Of TiMEx, for both pairs and groups,
with a previously introduced permutation—based method by Vandin
et al. (2012) (ran with 1000 permutations). For the tests on pairs,
TiMEx was further compared with one—sided Fisher’s exact test for
contingency tables, testing whether the number Of double mutants is
significantly lower than expected under independence. For the tests
on larger groups, TiMEx was additionally compared with muex
(Szczurek and Beerenwinkel, 2014), a previously introduced statis—
tical model for detecting mutually exclusive groups. In a power ana—
lysis, we investigated how the sensitivity and specificity Of our
procedure are inﬂuenced by the thresholds on significance and mu—
tual exclusivity degree, ppair and upair.

3.1.1 Test performance for pairs and groups

For simulating mutually exclusive gene pairs, we used 21, 22
E {0.02, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 3}, corresponding tO marginal frequencies Of
the two genes ranging from 2% tO 75% in the null model and 0.5%
tO 75% in the mutual exclusivity model with M172} : 1
(Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). We performed 100 simulation
runs, detected pairwise mutual exclusivity with the three tests and
recorded the mean P value (Fig. 3). When M172} : 0, corresponding
tO nO mutual exclusivity, all three tests dO nOt reject the null hypoth—
esis, with a P value close tO 1, for all tested combinations Of frequen—
cies and sample sizes. TiMEx is the only test that starts detecting
mutual exclusivity from the first non—zero value of M12} in the
chosen simulation set, however with reduced performance for small
sample size and small frequencies Of both genes. The detection cap—
acity increases with increasing values of M12}, M, 21 and 22. For ex—
ample, for a chosen significance level Of 0.05 and a sample size Of
M = 4000, TiMEx detects the gene pairs as being mutually exclusive
for any value of M172} 2 0.4 and for any 21, 22 2 0.1. For higher mar-
ginal frequencies, such as corresponding tO 21, 22 2 0.5 , we can de—
tect mutual exclusivity Of degree M172} 2 0.4 for sample sizes as low
as M = 300. In contrast, Fisher’s exact test and the permutation test
in Vandin et al. (2012), while performing highly similarly tO each
Other, detect nO mutual exclusivity for M172} < 0.5. Moreover, for
M172} 20.5, their detection ability is much reduced compared to

Fig. 4. Summary Pvalue (over 100 simulation runs and 10 simulated groups
of size 5) of TiMEx, the permutation test in Vandin et al. (2012) and muex
(Szczurek and Beerenwinkel, 2014), for different sample sizes M and degrees
of mutual exclusivity MN. TiMEx is highly sensitive in detecting mutual exclu-
sivity and outperforms both other methods. The permutation test only
detects mutual exclusivity for MNZOB and outperforms muex, which only
detects pure mutually exclusivity (,uN =1). The detection ability of TiMEx
improves with increasing values of Mand ,uN

TiMEx. The null model used in Fisher’s exact test is a classical inde—
pendence model, while the waiting times in our null model are nOt
statistically independent, even with fixed rate Of the Observation
time hobs.

For simulating mutually exclusive groups, we fixed the group
size tO 5 and produced 10 different groups by uniformly sampling
waiting time rates with values between 0.01 and 1, which corres—
pond tO an expected alteration frequency Of 14% (Supplementary
Table S3). We performed 100 simulation runs, detected mutual ex—
clusivity with TiMEx, the permutation test and muex and summar—
ized the P value over both simulated groups and simulation runs
(Fig. 4). Similar tO the case Of pairs, the detection ability Of TiMEx
increases with increasing sample size and degree Of mutual exclusiv—
ity. For a significance level Of 0.05, we detect mutual exclusivity for

almost all tested sample sizes and degrees Of mutual exclusivity,
with the exception Of small sample size M = 300 and low degree Of
mutual exclusivity ,uN : 0.2. For the highest sample size, M = 4000,
TiMEx is very sensitive in detecting mutual exclusivity for any tested
positive degree, with mean P value 3 104. In contrast, the permu—
tation test only starts detecting mutual exclusivity for MN 2 0.8,
however, outperforming muex, which only detects pure mutual ex—
clusivity (MN : 1). On data simulated using ,uN : 0, all three tests
dO nOt reject the null hypothesis with mean P value > 0.6.

In addition tO assessing the detection ability Of TiMEx and Other
methods on data simulated from TiMEx, we conducted simulations
on datasets generated in a more general manner. We generated
groups Of n = 5 mutually exclusive genes by varying the sample size
as before, the coverage, i.e. the percentage Of tumors with one alter—
ation, among {0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8}, and the probability Of passenger al—
terations among {0.001, 0.01, 0.1}. On all datasets, TiMEx
outperforms the permutation test and muex and always records
lower P values (ranking nOt shown for P values lower than 10‘”)
(Supplementary Fig. S4). All three methods perform better with
increasing sample size, increasing coverage and decreasing passenger
probability, and, for most Of the tested values, they significantly de—
tect the group as mutually exclusive. For TiMEx, we also estimated
the degree Of mutual exclusivity MN corresponding tO the generated
groups (Supplementary Fig. S5). For the very low passenger prob—
ability Of 0.001, the inferred degree Of mutual exclusivity is 1, as the
expected number Of passenger mutations per dataset is very low, es—
pecially for small sample sizes. The lowest inferred degree Of mutual
exclusivity is 0.7, corresponding tO small coverage and small sample
size. The estimated MN increases with increasing coverage and
decreasing passenger probability, and the estimation improves with
increasing sample size.

3.1.2 Power analysis

For assessing the true— and false—positive rates Of our procedure, we
constructed 100 datasets consisting Of two groups: a group Of size 3
simulated from the mutually exclusive model and a group Of size 9
simulated from the conditionally independent model. The

corresponding 2 values were sampled uniformly between 0.01 and 1
(Supplementary Table S3). We tested all pairs with TiMEx, detected
maximal cliques as candidates and evaluated them with TiMEx. An
identified group was considered tO be mutually exclusive if its
Bonferroni corrected P value was lower than 0.1. We computed the
true—positive rate by counting a single time, among the mutually ex-
clusive groups Of size at least 3, all edges only connecting two genes
part Of the true mutually exclusive group and normalizing by the
number Of all possible such edges. Similarly, we computed the false—
positive rate by counting a single time, among the mutually exclu-
sive groups Of size at least 3, all edges nOt connecting two genes part
Of the true mutually exclusive group and normalizing accordingly.
TiMEx performs generally very well in reconstructing the implanted
mutually exclusive group (Supplementary Fig. S7). The highest effect
in increasing the true—positive rate and decreasing the false—negative
rate is given by increasing the mutual exclusivity degree Of the simu—
lated group. For values Of the threshold upair 2 0.5, the false—positive
rate is Often set tO 0, and most Of the times reduced by at least 75%
when compared with the case when upair : 0.2. However, for small
degrees Of mutual exclusivity Of the simulated group, bOth the true
and the false—positive rates are Often simultaneously reduced.

Additionally, on the same simulated datasets, we analyzed how
Often the true mutually exclusive group is ranked first by corrected P
value among the identified groups (Supplementary Fig. S8). The
threshold upair largely impacts the detection performance, while the
impact Of ppair is negligible. For high degrees Of mutual exclusivity
Of the true group, MN 2 0.8, the real group is either tOp ranked or a
strict subset Of the tOp ranked one, depending on upair. Optimal per-
formance is achieved for upair : 0.5, corresponding tO a percentage
Of between 50% and 100% Of datasets for which the true group is
tOp ranked. Moreover, if the true group is perfectly mutually exclu—
sive (MN : 1), it is tOp ranked in more than 90% Of the datasets
for medium values Of upair, for any value Of ppair and for medium
sample sizes. For lower values Of upair, the true group is a strict
subset Of the tOp ranked group. For low degrees Of mutual exclu—
sivity ,uN, either nO significant groups are identified or the tOp
ranked group is nOt the real group. The detection power im—
proves with increasing sample size and increasing degree Of mu—
tual exclusivity ,uN.

3.2 Biological datasets

We ran our procedure on four biological datasets: two glioblastoma
datasets preprocessed by muex (Szczurek and Beerenwinkel, 2014)
and Multidendrix (Leiserson et al., 2013) and two datasets down—
loaded from TCGA and preprocessed as explained in
Supplementary Section 82.3: breast cancer and ovarian cancer. Our
main interest was detecting gene groups with average or high degree
Of mutual exclusivity and minimizing the false—positive rate, while
maintaining the true—positive rate at a high level. Therefore, based
on the sensitivity and specificity estimates in simulated data
(Supplementary Figs S7 and S8), we set upair : 0.5 and ppair : 0.01
for the four datasets. A detected group was considered significantly
mutually exclusive if its Bonferroni—corrected P value (q value) was
less than 0.1 (Supplementary Fig. S9). TO test the stability Of the
identified groups, we subsampled the set Of patients at frequencies
Of 30%, 5 0% and 80% and repeated the procedure 100 times, re—
porting how Often each group is still identified as mutually exclusive
(Supplementary Tables S4—S15). Among the identified groups Of any
size, we further computed the most stable subgroups
(Supplementary Tables 816—827). For mutually exclusive groups
with high enough alteration frequencies, higher stability indicates

stronger mutual exclusivity support in the data. For each group size,
we tested the first 10 groups ranked by q value for pathway enrich-
ment with WebGesalt (Zhang et al., 2005) on the Pathways
Commons dataset (Cerami et al., 2011) and reported all signifi-
cantly enriched pathways for a BH—corrected P value threshold
Of 0.01. On all four datasets, we compared our results with two
Other methods: Multidendix and muex (Supplementary Tables S32—
S37). Supplementary Section S1 discusses the mutually exclusive
groups identified in the two glioblastoma datasets.

3.2.1 Mutual exclusivity in breast cancer

In the breast cancer dataset (Fig. 5), we found 63 groups Of size 2,
416 groups Of size 3, 96 groups Of size 4 and 10 groups Of size 5.
Since all the 10 largest groups contained one gene with frequency
less than 10%, these groups were highly unstable tO subsampling,
even if they corresponded tO functionally related collections Of genes
(Supplementary Table S13). The first three groups with the lowest q
value consisted Of the pOint mutations Of the tumor suppressors
CDH1, GATA3, MAP3K1, the copy number aberration Of
CDKNIB, which belong tO pathways including PI(3)K, mTOR,
PDGF receptor signaling network or EGF receptor (ErbB1) signaling
and the copy number aberration Of one Of the following genes:
MIEN1, PPPIRIB or ERBBZ. MIEN1 is an oncogenic protein,
whose overexpression functionally enhances migration and invasion
Of tumor cells via modulating the activity Of the PI(3)K pathway
(Hsu et al., 2012), providing evidence for the functional relation be—
tween these genes. Moreover, the PPP1R1B-STARD3 chimeric fu-
sion transcript was shown tO activate the PI(3)IOAKT signaling
pathway and promote tumorigenesis (Yun et al., 2014), while
ERBBZ is an oncogene that also belongs tO the PI(3)K and mTOR
pathways. The next two mutually exclusive groups Of size 5 included
the same three pOint mutations, and the copy number aberrations Of
either MIEN1 and B4GALNT3, which have nO known functional

TiMEx in the breast cancer dataset. (C) The group consisting of the point mu-
tation of BRCA2 and the copy number aberrations of R31 and CCNE1 (q value

fied by TiMEx in the ovarian cancer dataset

rOle in breast cancer, or GRB7 and CDKN I B, which are part Of the
Common group of pathways. The group Of size 4 with lowest q
value consisted Of the pOint mutations Of CDHI, MAP3K1, TP53
and GATA3 and was entirely mapped tO the Common group of
pathways, as well as tO the CDC42 signaling events pathway
(Supplementary Table S12). The second and the third group
included, instead Of the GATA3 pOint mutation, the copy number
aberration Of either TUBD1 or IN T54. Even though strong evidence
Of association for these two genes and the group Of three pOint muta—
tions exists in the data, TUBD1 and INTS4 have nO known func-
tional rOle in cancer. Furthermore, nO known functional
connections were found between the identified pairwise mutually
exclusive interactions (Supplementary Table S10), mainly because
most Of the functionally related pairs were part Of cliques Of larger
sizes. The subgroups with highest subsampling stability
(Supplementary Tables S22—S24) consisted Of genes with known
functional involvement in cancer and part Of cancer pathways, such
as GATA3, PIK3 CA, PTEN 0r MIEN1.

We separately ran our procedure on the subset consisting Of 507
samples annotated as distinct breast cancer subtypes
(Supplementary Tables S28—S31). None Of the alterations identified
in the top ranking groups were specific tO the Basal subtype
(Supplementary Table S28), while some Of the tOp ranked mutually
exclusive relations identified based on the entire dataset were identi—
fied in subsets Of data for Her2, LuminalA and LuminalB subtypes.
For example, the mutually exclusive connections between the pOint
mutations Of PIK3 CA and GATA3, as well as between the pOint mu—
tations Of MAP3K1, GATA3 and TP53 were identified in the
LuminalA subtype (Supplementary Table S30). Similarly, the group
including the point mutations PIK3 CA, TP53 and GATA3 was spe—
cific tO LuminalB (Supplementary Table S31). The pOint mutations
Of PIK3 CA and TP53, and the copy number aberration Of PTEN
were part Of multiple mutually exclusive pairs identified in the Her2
subtype (Supplementary Table S29). TUBD1, a gene part Of mul-
tiple groups, was mutually exclusive with the pOint mutation Of
MAP3KI in LuminalA and with the point mutations Of PIK3CA
and TP5 3 in LuminalB.

We ran Multidendrix using or = 2.5 [as suggested in Leiserson
et al. (2013)], t = 4 and a range Of kmax values (Supplementary Table
S35). Multidendrix primarily identified the core group including the
pOint mutations Of TP53, GATA3 and MAP3K1, however, in the
same group as the pOint mutations Of CTCF and PLXNBZ, which
dO nOt belong tO any known functional pathways. On the contrary,
TiMEx identified these three pOint mutations in a common module
with the point mutation Of CDH I. Similarly, the next two modules
with highest weight only contained three genes in known functional
pathways, as assessed by WebGestalt, on the Pathway Commons
database (data nOt shown). The fourth module identified by
Multidendrix contained nO significant pathways. muex did nOt scale
tO the size Of this dataset, and none Of the tOp 30 groups Of any size
identified by TiMEx were found significantly mutually exclusive by
muex’s statistical test.

3.2.2 Mutual exclusivity in ovarian cancer

In the ovarian cancer dataset (Fig. 5 ), we identified 25 mutually ex—
clusive groups Of size 2 and 19 groups Of size 3. The tOp ranked
group Of size 3 (Supplementary Table S15) included genes part Of
the FOXM1 transcription factor network, and involved in cell cycle
regulation, recently shown tO play a major rOle in the progression Of
ovarian cancer (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2011):
the copy number aberrations Of the tumor suppressor gene RBI and

the oncogene CCNEI and the pOint mutation Of the tumor suppres—
sor gene BRCAZ. This group was also highly stable tO subsampling
(identified in 92% Of the cases in which 80% Of the patients were
subsampled). The Other tOp ranked group whose members mapped
entirely tO known pathways consisted Of the pOint mutations Of
BRCAI and BRCA2, and the copy number aberration Of CCNEI,
which are core members Of the ATM pathway. These two modules
have also been previously identified as mutually exclusive by MEMO
(Ciriello et al., 2012). The second and third tOp scoring groups Of
size 3 included the copy number aberrations Of MYC and CCNE1,
two members Of cell cycle regulation pathways involved in the GI/S
phase transition, also identified by MEMO, together with the copy
number aberration Of one gene with yet unknown functional rOle in
ovarian cancer: WNKI or NIN]2. The tOp ranked mutually exclu—
sive pair, which was also highly stable tO subsampling (identified
98% Of the times when subsampling 80% Of the patients) included
KRAS and TP53 pOint mutations, which are part Of the p75 NTR
receptor—mediated signaling pathway (Supplementary Table S14).
The second mutually exclusive pair, also highly stable tO subsam—
pling, included the pOint mutations Of TP53 and RBI, bOth part Of
the TGFBR and p53 pathways. Further mutually exclusive connec—
tions stable tO subsampling included the pOint mutations Of BRCAI
and BRCA2 and the copy number aberration Of CCNEI
(Supplementary Tables 825—827).

We ran Multidendrix using t=4 and a range Of kmax values
(Supplementary Table S36). The groups identified by TiMEx and
Multidendrix showed a high overlap. For example, the top ranking
groups identified by TiMEx, i.e. the pair including the pOint muta—
tions Of TP53 and KRAS, and the group including the copy number
aberrations Of RBI and CCNEI, together with the pOint mutation
of BRCA2, were also identified by Multidendrix. Moreover, subsets
Of most Of the group members that Multidendrix identified, for e.g.
kmax : 5 were identified by TiMEx as groups Of size 3, such as the
point mutations Of BRCAI and BRCA2 and the copy number aber—
ration Of EPHX3. Even though muex did nOt scale tO exhaustively
analyze the dataset, 14 Of the pairs and 4 Of the groups Of size 3
identified by TiMEx were found tO be significant by muex
(Supplementary Table S37). Almost all the pairs included either the
pOint mutation of BRCA2 or the copy number aberration Of NFI,
while the larger groups included genes mapping tO relevant path—
ways, among which many had also been identified by Multidendrix.
The reason why these groups are also found tO be mutually exclusive
by muex is the fact that the alteration frequencies Of their members
are balanced.

4 Discussion

We have introduced TiMEx, a probabilistic generative model for
detecting mutual exclusivity patterns Of various degrees across car—
cinogenic alterations, and an efficient multistep procedure for iden—
tifying all mutually exclusive groups in large datasets. TiMEx is the
first method that describes the mutual exclusivity property as a con—
sequence Of a dynamic process in time. Unlike previous de novo
approaches, TiMEx infers functional relations between genes based
on an underlying temporal representation Of the process Of gene al—
teration in tumorigenesis. Moreover, TiMEx is a probabilistic gen—
erative model, providing a natural way Of rigorously quantifying the
degree and significance Of mutual exclusivity Of a group Of genes. TO
the best Of our knowledge, TiMEx is the first method inferring a
continuous range Of mutual exclusivity degrees. Biologically, the
small, but observable, increase in tumor fitness due tO multiple

alterations in a group Of functionally related genes supports the hy—
pothesis that mutual exclusivity occurs at various degrees, as
Opposed tO a binary classification. Unlike most Other approaches,
TiMEx does nOt explicitly impose frequency constraints and detects
both high frequent and very low frequent alterations, sOlely based
on the temporal relations between them. It identifies all mutually ex-
clusive gene groups Of various, nOt pre—defined sizes and performs
highly efficiently on large datasets. In simulation studies, TiMEx
outperforms previous methods for detecting mutual exclusive
groups, showing high sensitivity even at low degrees Of mutual ex—
clusivity and scaling very well tO sample sizes Of several thousands
tumors, which is expected tO be soon reached by cancer genome
sequencing studies. On biological datasets, most Of the tOp ranked
mutually exclusive groups identified by TiMEx have stronger func-
tional biological relevance than the groups identified by previous
methods. These results clearly indicate that TiMEx is nOt only theor-
etically justified by its biological and probabilistic foundation in
describing tumorigenesis as a generative process Of mutually exclu—
sive alteration patterns, but is also efficiently and fruitfully applic-
able in practice.

TiMEx models, however, still a simplified representation Of car—
cinogenesis. Given a particular order between the waiting times Of
the genes and the Observation time, the probability Of violating mu-
tual exclusivity, 1 — MN, is independent Of how many or which alter-
ations are in a group. One natural extension Of TiMEx would be tO
consider an incremental penalty for additional pOint alterations viO—
lating perfect mutual exclusivity, hence increasing the probability Of
being in a nonmutually exclusive state with increasing number Of
violating alterations. Additionally, even if highly efficient, the search
for mutually exclusive gene groups is heuristic and depends on the
thresholds ppair and upair. With overly stringent thresholds, tOO few
candidates would be proposed, while using overly permissive thresh-
Olds would lead tO selecting as candidates a vast number Of subsets,
making the procedure intractable. Moreover, the fact that pairwise
connections are selectively included when testing groups for mutual
exclusivity, on the basis Of the same data, renders the interpretation
Of the resulting P values more complex. TO address this, we propose
setting the thresholds following the desired sensitivity—specificity
tradeOff as assessed in detail in the simulation studies discussed here.
Finally, ranking the identified mutually exclusive groups by the re—
sulting q values facilitates the interpretation Of their functional rOle
in carcinogenesis.

The exponential distribution, used for modeling the waiting
times tO alterations and the Observation time, is a typical chOice tO
describe waiting times (Gerstung and Beerenwinkel, 2010), bOth due
tO its generality and tO its mathematical convenience. While the ex—
ponential distribution is the simplest model for system failure time,
Other families Of distributions can be readily integrated intO our
mathematical framework, with nevertheless the cost Of more
involved mathematical formulas. For example, using the Weibull
distribution provides a supporting assumption in modeling cancer
progression due tO the fact that the instantaneous probability Of 0c—
currence Of an event changes with time. Another extension Of
TiMEx is renouncing tO the independence assumption at the level Of
Observations and applying our procedure tO large—scale time series
data Of tumor progression. Once this type Of data becomes available,

TiMEx will facilitate a more detailed understanding Of pathways
involved in tumor progression.

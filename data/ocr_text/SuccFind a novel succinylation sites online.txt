Abstract

Summary: Lysine succinylation orchestrates a variety of biological processes. Annotation of succi—
nylation in proteomes is the first—crucial step to decipher physiological roles of succinylation impli—
cated in the pathological processes. In this work, we developed a novel succinylation site online
prediction tool, called Suchind, which is constructed to predict the lysine succinylation sites based
on two major categories of characteristics: sequence—derived features and evolutionary—derived in—
formation of sequence and via an enhanced feature strategy for further optimizations. The assess—
ment results obtained from cross—validation suggest that Suchind can provide more instructive
guidance for further experimental investigation of protein succinylation.

1 Introduction

Lysine succinylation is a novel identified PTMs pathway present in
both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, which orchestrates a variety
of biological processes. Succinylation was first discovered to occur
at the active site of homoserine trans—succinylase (Rosen et 61].,
2004). With an antibody based enrichment strategy and MS—based
proteomics, Zhang et al. (2011) identified several dozens of succiny—
lation sites in bacteria in 2011. Subsequent work recognized a num—
ber of succinylation sites in animal tissues (Du et 61]., 2011) and on
histones (Xie et 61]., 2012). Recently, plenty of lysine succinylation
sites were also identified in extracellular toxoplasma tachyzoites (Li
et 61]., 2014). As the rapid development of sequencing techniques,
identification and functional study of succinylation has emerged to
be an intriguing topic and attracted much attention. But it is still un—
known about the mechanism of succinylation as well as the succinyl
donor to lysine remains, a global analysis of lysine succinylation in
diverse organisms is still lacking. Yet annotation of succinylation in

proteomes is a first—crucial step toward decoding protein function
and understanding of their physiological roles that have been impli-
cated in the pathological processes. For systematically investigating
the lysine succinylation and its relevant function, a prerequisite is to
establish a reliable and comprehensive dataset. However, while only
a small amount of known succinylation sites was detected, eXperi—
mental verification of succinylated substrates is labor—intensive,
time—consuming and biased toward abundant proteins and proteo—
typic peptides. Thus, in silicon prediction of succinylation sites can
serve as an alternative strategy for whole proteome annotation. We
thus developed the Suchind to determine whether a fragment which
contains lysine residues can be succinylated or not, which is con—
structed to predict the lysine succinylation sites based on sequence—
derived features, and evolutionary—derived information of sequence
and via a enhanced feature strategy for further optimizations.
Coincidentally, when we built Suchind to predict protein succi—
nylation sites, another protein succinylation site predictor called

SucPred was reported as well (Zhao et 61]., 2015). But when we try
to visit the web server of SucPred, the website is not accessible. So
there is no way to compare with it. Since SucPred only considered
unilateral features with no further optimization to build prediction
models, features might contain redundant and noisy information
and some other potential value information will inevitably lose.
Here, we have considered different aspects of the features and via a
two—step feature selection strategy to carry further optimizations
when developed the model so our system can provide a more accur—
ate and comprehensive prediction performance as well as a more sta—
ble and sustained online service.

2 Methods

2.1 Data collection and preprocessing

By searching with multiple keywords such as ‘lysine succinylation’,
‘succinylation’, we collected 2938 experimentally verified lysine suc—
cinylation sites in 1044 proteins from different database including
UniProtKB/Swiss—Prot (Boutet et 61]., 2007), CPLM databases (Liu
et 61]., 2014) etc. as well as the relevant literatures (Li et 61]., 2014;
Park et 61]., 2013). As previously described, we regarded the known
succinylation sites as positive data, while other non—succinylation ly-
sine sites were taken as negative data. To avoid overestimated pre—
diction because of the redundancy of homologous sites in the
positive data, we used CD—HIT (Li and Godzik, 2006) to wipe off
homologous fragments with a sensitive cutoff of 0.3. Finally, a non—
redundant data set for training was constructed with 2713 positive
sites and 23598 negative sites (Supplementary Table S1).

2.2 Sequence—derived characteristics

2.2.1 AAC 8C CKSAAP Encoding

Since all organisms try to minimize the ‘cost’ of protein synthesis by
adjusting their amino acid content to specific growth conditions, a
proteome—wide amino acid composition analysis can characterize
the specific state of a given organism (Mazel and Marliére, 1989).
Here, amino acid composition (AAC) and composition of k—spaced
amino acid pairs (CKSAAP) (i.e. pairs that are separated by k other
amino acids) were used to extract the potential sequence informa—
tion of amino acid residues surrounding the succinylation sites and
non—succinylation sites. More details about the encodings are
described in Supplementary Materials Ep1.

2.2.2 AAindeX

Amino Acid index database (AAindex) (Kawashima and Kanehisa,
2000) contains a total of 544 amino acid indices that specify the
physicochemical properties of amino acids. Thus the amino acids
adjacent to the succinylation sites can be encoded as an input vector
to develop our prediction model. After examined all of the 544 phys-
icochemical properties with the default parameters of SVM, isoelec—
tric point was chosen as the best physicochemical property (with
high accuracy) for succinylation prediction from AAindex.

2.3 Evolutionary—derived information

Local sequence clusters often exist around succinylation site because
substrate sites of same enzyme usually share similar patterns. To
take full advantage of such cluster information of local sequence
fragments for predicting succinylation sites, we took the local se—
quence around the succinylation site in a query protein and ex-
tracted features from its similar sequences in both positive and
negative datasets by a LSC score algorithm. More detail about the
encoding is described in Supplementary Materials Ep2.

2.4 Two—step feature selection strategy via support
vector machine

As heterogeneous features are often redundant and noisy, we per—
formed feature selection to pick up most important features by a fea—
ture selection method known as F—score (Sokolova et 61]., 2006). In
particular, a two—step feature selection manner was applied in our
study. First, averaged F—score values of the each ten training sets
were calculated with the purpose of ranking the features vector. We
used a wrapper—based feature selection with the forward best first
search. More specifically, for a given list of feature sorted in the des—
cending order by their average F—score value and an empty list R
that store the selected features. We add the top—ranked feature from
F to R and run SVM using feature set R in the cross validation strat—
egy. If the addition of the top ranked features improves the average
accuracy value over the ten test folds, then this features vector is re—
tained in R; otherwise it will be removed. We repeat that until F is
empty. More details about the methods are described in
Supplementary Materials Ep3.

3 Results and discussion

Based on the succinylation data sets, we firstly generated the graph—
ical sequence logo (P < 0.01; t—test) and detected a statistically sig—
nificant differences in position—specific symbol compositions and
biochemical environment (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. S1). We then
calculated the amino acid frequencies (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Fig.
S2) and probed the weight distribution of amino acid pairs (Fig. 1c,
Supplementary Fig. S3) in the sequence surrounding the succinyla—
tion sites. Information gain (IG) values of different residues also
were calculated in Figure 1b, which was used to distinguish the im—
portance of different residues for succinylation sequence. More de—
tail about the IG is described in Supplementary Materials Ep4. Note
that the larger the IG values of residues are, the more important the
residues are. These results suggested not only the compositions of
amino acids, amino acid pairs but also the weight of residues is vary
widely in succinylation and non—succinylation segments. After exam—
ined all of the 544 physicochemical properties with the default par—
ameters of SVM, isoelectric point was chosen as the best
physicochemical property for succinylation prediction (Figs 1d, 2a).
In addition, as for biological analysis, one of the most important as—
pects of concern is the evolutionary conservation. Figure 2b and 2c
compares the LSC scores of succinylation sites with those of non—
succinylation sites. The result declared the LSC scores could capture

evolutionary similarity information in the local sequence around
succinylation sites and hence distinguish them from the background.
To assess the prediction performance of Suchind, the LOO valid—
ation and 4—, 6—, 8—, 10—fold cross—validations were applied and the
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn in
Figure 2d and the corresponding value of average area under the
curve (AAUC) values were calculated as 0.8070 (LOO), 0.8201
(4-fold), 0.8182 (6-fold), 0.8226 (8-fold) and 0.8162 (10-fold), re-
spectively. Since the prediction performance of the 4—, 6—, 8— and 10—
fold cross—validations were closely similar to the LOO validation for
the prediction of succinylation sites, it is evident that the method is a
robust predictor.

With the high stringency value, we adopted Suchind to predict
potential succinylation sites in lysine acetylated substrates. Totally,
it was observed that 10128 (17.80%) known acetylation sites might
be modified by succinylation. We are also surprised to detect that
2422 succinylation sites in our study could co—occur at the same ly—
sine residues with acetylation. These observations show that succi—
nylation prefer to co—occupy with acetylation at the same lysine
residues. And in situ crosstalk between succinylation and acetylation
might exhibit a tissue—specific manner (Supplementary Table 81 and
Fig. S4). Gene functional analysis suggested that succinylation pre—
fers to in situ crosstalk with acetylation in a variety of biological
processes and pathway (Supplementary Figs S5 and S6), and poten—
tial impacts of lysine succinylation on enzymes involve in

mitochondrial metabolism and other cellular processes that metab—
olism related (Supplementary Materials Ep5 and Ep6).

It is our desire to build an open platform which could provide
more useful guidance for experimental workers of identification of
succinylation sites. The web service of Suchind is freely available
at: http://bioinfo.ncu.edu.cn/Suchind.aspx. The improved succiny—
lation prediction system will be done when the new succinylation
sites data become available. We anticipate that the Suchind will be
a powerful and complementary tool for further experimental investi-
gation of protein succinylation.

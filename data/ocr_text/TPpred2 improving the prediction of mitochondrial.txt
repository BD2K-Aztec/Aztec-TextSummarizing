ABSTRACT

Summary: Targeting peptides are N-terminal sorting signals in pro-
teins that promote their translocation to mitochondria through the
interaction with different protein machineries. We recently developed
TPpred, a machine learning-based method scoring among the best
ones available to predict the presence of a targeting peptide into a
protein sequence and its cleavage site. Here we introduce TPpred2
that improves TPpred performances in the task of identifying the
cleavage site of the targeting peptides. TPpred2 is now available as
a web interface and as a stand-alone version for users who can freely
download and adopt it for processing large volumes of sequences.
Availability and implementaion: TPpred2 is available both as web
server and stand-alone version at http://tppred2.biocomp.unibo.it.

1 INTRODUCTION

The vast majority of mitochondrial proteins are encoded by the
nuclear genome, synthesized on the cytosolic ribosomes and
therefrom translocated to the different sub-mitochondrial local-
izations. The best characterized mechanism that controls the
import into the mitochondrion involves the detection of an
N—terminal pre-sequence, the so-called targeting peptide, which
directs the protein across different translocating protein com-
plexes embedded in the outer and inner mitochondrial mem-
branes. The sorting peptide is proteolytically cleaved when the
protein reaches the ﬁnal destination (Schmidt et al., 2010). The
detection of targeting peptides starting from protein sequences is
then an important step to fully characterize the sequence of the
mature protein and to annotate its function and localization.
Different computational methods can help the annotation of
targeting peptides in proteins. The best performing methods
implement machine-learning approaches, such as artiﬁcial neural
network, support vector machines (SVMs), hidden Markov
models and Grammatical-Restrained Hidden Conditional
Random Fields (GRHCRFs) (Emanuelsson et al., 2007; Indio
et al., 2013; Petsalaki et al., 2006; Small et al., 2004).

Here we describe TPpred2, our new implementation for the
prediction of mitochondrial targeting peptides and their cleavage

sites. The new predictor combines TPpred, our previous
GRHCRF-based method for the prediction of mitochondrial
and plastidic targeting peptides (F ariselli et al., 2009; Indio
et al., 2013), with an additional reﬁnement step—SVM-
based—for cleavage site identiﬁcation. In particular, the SVM
classiﬁer is used to identify the correct cleavage site by exploiting
TPpred prediction signals (extracted in terms of GRHCRF-
based positional posterior probabilities) and a newly deﬁned fea-
ture that captures the occurrence of sequence motifs previously
recognized at the cleavage sites (Mossmann et al., 2012).

When tested on the non-redundant dataset of proteins of Indio
et al. (2013; 202 mitochondrial and 8010 non-mitochondrial pro-
teins; see Supplementary Section 1.1), TPpred2 signiﬁcantly out-
performs our previous TPpred predictor on mitochondrial
cleavage site detection. TPPred2, being optimized for the predic-
tion of cleavage sites of mitochondrial proteins, is not adequate
for the identiﬁcation of plant targeting peptides.

2 METHOD DESCRIPTION AND USAGE

2.1 Mitochondrial cleavage site sequence motifs

Cleavage regions in mitochondrial proteins exhibit characteristic se-
quence features for recognition by the cleavage machineries (Mossmann
et al., 2012). Five different sequence motifs have been identiﬁed as typical
of mitochondrial cleavage sites: (i) R2 = RXlX, (ii) R3a = RX
[FLY]|[SA], (iii) R3b = RX[FLY]|X, (iv) R10 = RX[FLI]XX[TGS]
XXXX|X and (v) Rnone = X|XS. The character ‘|’ indicates the position
of the cleavage; the ‘X’ character is a wildcard used to represent any
residue type (the residues enclosed in square brackets indicate alternative
choices). The different motifs are not mutually exclusive, and a single
cleavage site can match with more than one of them. Here we rank the
motifs according to their positive predictive value (PPV), deﬁned as the
ratio between the matches corresponding to an experimental cleavage site
(true-positive matches) and the total number of occurrences in the non-
redundant dataset including 202 proteins from eukaryotes with experi-
mentally veriﬁed targeting peptides (Indio et al., 2013; see Supplementary
Section 1.1 for more details). Adopting the PPV criterion, the top-ranking
motif is R3a, followed by R10, R3b, R2 and Rnone. Not all cleavage sites
exhibit these features: 139 of 202 mitochondrial proteins match at least
one of the motifs (see Supplementary Section 1.1 for a complete statis-
tics). Here we use these observations to derive a motif-based feature
classiﬁer and improve cleavage site identiﬁcation.

2.2 TPpred2 overview

TPpred2 predicts mitochondrial targeting peptides and cleavage sites,
adopting a two-step procedure. In the ﬁrst step, the protein is ﬁltered
with TPpred (Indio et al., 2013). If no targeting peptide is detected, the

input sequence is predicted as a non-mitochondrial protein (TPpred
shows the lowest false-positive rate among the state-of—the-art methods;
Indio et al., 2013). If TPpred identiﬁes a targeting peptide, the cleavage
site prediction is reﬁned using an additional SVM classiﬁer (second step).
In the reﬁnement step, the classiﬁer operates analyzing an optimal
29-residue-long segment centered on the TPpred-predicted cleavage site.
The reﬁnement SVM is fed using three input features: (i) two GRHCRF-
derived positional posterior probabilities that score the likelihood for the
cleavage site to be located at a given sequence position and (ii) a feature
deﬁned on the basis of the occurrence of the sequence motifs described in
the previous section. The reﬁned cleavage site is the position scoring with
the highest SVM output probabilities. When the SVM probability is <0.5
for any position in the segment, the cleavage site predicted by TPpred is
retained (for details, see Supplementary Section 1.2).

2.3 Usage and program requirements

TPpred2 is available both as web server and command-line tool. The
TPpred2 web server (http://tppred2.biocomp.unibo.it) requires a single
protein sequence in FASTA format. Once the input sequence is pro-
cessed, the output page contains all the information about the identiﬁed
targeting peptide (when detected), including the cleavage site location and
a reliability score attached to the prediction. The command-line version
of the program is well suited for large-scale genomic analyses (whereas
the web server can handle a single protein sequence at a time). The pro-
gram source code and example data are available at http://tppred2.bio
comp.unibo.it. After unpacking, the TPpred2 command-line program is
ready to use (see Supplementary Section 2.2 for further instructions about
the initial conﬁguration), and the user can operate by simply providing a
multi-FASTA ﬁle as input to the program. For each protein sequence
contained in the input ﬁle, TPpred2 lists the putative location of the
cleavage site (when detected, the symbo ‘-’ otherwise) and the corres-
ponding reliability score (for both positive and negative predictions).

2.4 TPPRED2 performance

The overall performance of TPpred2 in discriminating mitochondrial
from non-mitochondrial proteins is similar to that of TPpred (Indio
et al., 2013). However, TPpred2 is superior to TPpred in detecting the
mitochondrial cleavage site. In Table 1, we compare the performance
of both TPpred2 and the legacy TPpred obtained using a 5-fold cross-
Validation procedure. Two different scoring measures are computed:
(i) the fraction of proteins whose cleavage sites have been perfectly iden-
tiﬁed (Cleave* columns) and (ii) the mean absolute error on cleavage site
identiﬁcation (ME* columns) that measures the average distance between
predicted and observed cleavage sites. Scoring indexes are computed over
the entire dataset of 202 proteins (Cleaveau, MEau) and over the subset of
139 proteins whose cleavage site matches at least one sequence motif
(Cleavemoﬁf, MEmotif). Evidently, the new TPpred2 predictor signiﬁcantly
outperforms the legacy TPpred in the task of identifying the cleavage site.
The improvement is particularly evident when the predictors are com-
pared on the subset of proteins whose cleavage sites match with the se-
quence motifs. Furthermore, even when the site is not correctly located,
TPpred2 provides better predictions, as highlighted by the reduced abso-
lute error in cleavage identiﬁcation.

3 CONCLUSION

In this article, we present TPpred2, a software tool for the pre-
diction of mitochondrial targeting peptides and their cleavage
sites. The improved performance of TPpred2 is achieved by
jointly exploiting, for the ﬁrst time to our knowledge, peculiar
sequence motifs characterizing the cleavage site and GRHCRF
prediction signals. The new TPpred2 predictor is able to better
identify cleavage sites when compared with our previous imple-
mentation. The software is available as a web server and, most
importantly, as a stand-alone program, making it well suited for
large-scale genomic analysis.

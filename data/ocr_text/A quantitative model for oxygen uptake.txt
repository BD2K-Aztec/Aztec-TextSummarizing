Abstract

Motivation: Hemeproteins have many diverse functions that largely depend on the rate at which
they uptake or release small ligands, like oxygen. These proteins have been extensively studied
using either simulations or experiments, albeit only qualitatively and one or two proteins at a time.
Results: We present a physical—chemical model, which uses data obtained exclusively from com—
puter simulations, to describe the uptake and release of oxygen in a family of hemeproteins, called
truncated hemoglobins (ters). Through a rigorous statistical analysis we demonstrate that our
model successfully recaptures all the reported experimental oxygen association and dissociation
kinetic rate constants, thus allowing us to establish the key factors that determine the rates at which
these hemeproteins uptake and release oxygen. We found that internal tunnels as well as the distal
site water molecules control ligand uptake, whereas oxygen stabilization by distal site residues
controls ligand release. Because these rates largely determine the functions of these hemeproteins,
these approaches will also be important tools in characterizing the ters members with unknown
functions.

1 Introduction

 

OXFORD

The combination of computer simulations and biochemical experi—
ments has become a reliable strategy to describe the underlying mo—
lecular details of observed differences in the activity of proteins.
With an increasing amount of data on individual proteins, the con—
struction of mathematical models that permit a more generalized
understanding of these molecular details has become a challenge of
interest to many groups around the world (Oliveira et 61]., 2014;
Potapov et 61]., 2015; Pucci and Rooman, 2014; Silk et al., 2014).
The truncated hemoglobins (ters) are a family of hemeproteins
that share a conserved three—dimensional structure as well as the

structural positions of their active site residues (Wittenberg et 61].,
2002). Their diverse functions are related to their ability to uptake
and release ligands with a wide range of entry and exit rates.
Because the ligands bind to the heme group, which is buried in the
protein, the ligand entry and exit rates depend to a great extent on
the ligands ability to migrate to and from the active site via three po—
tential tunnels in the protein matrix (Elber, 2010; Milani et 61].,
2001; Perutz and Mathews, 1966), as shown in Figure 1A. Each pro-
tein may present one or two open tunnels, lined by particular resi—
dues defining its topology. Protein cavities have been identified
several decades ago through experiments in a Xe atmosphere, where

protein sites with retained Xe atoms were identified. In the case of
myoglobin, for example, several studies had demonstrated the im—
portance of internal cavities as ligand hosts as well as part of migra—
tory tunnels (Brunori, 2000; Brunori et al., 2000; Scott et al., 2001).
Crystallographic studies of ters from Mycobacterium tuberculosis,
Clolamydomonas eugametos and Paramecium caudatum also high-
light the importance of these cavities in the ter protein family
(Milani et al., 2004; Mishra and Meuwly, 2009). Several studies
have shown that in addition to the presence and nature of these mi—
gratory tunnels, certain active site residues can also modulate ligand
entry and exit, in particular, delaying ligand entry by stabilizing
water molecules that block accessibility to the heme (Fig. 1B),
(Bustamante et al., 2014; Goldbeck et al., 2006; Olson and Phillips,
1997; Ouellet et al., 2008; Scott et al., 2001) or by delaying ligand
exit by stabilizing the ligand itself (Fig. 1C) (Capece et al., 2013; Lu
et al., 2007; Ouellet et al., 2003, 2007a). Experimentally, it is pos-
sible to characterize ligand entry and exit by measuring the ligand
association (lean) and dissociation (lac, f) kinetic rate constants, re—
spectively. Specifically, [30,, determines the rate at which the ligand
reaches the protein heme iron from outside the protein, and leoff
determines the rate at which the ligand is released once it is bound
to the iron. Both lean and leoff have been reported for a number of
members of the ter family (Bonamore et al., 2005; Bustamante
et al., 2014; Couture et al., 1999, 2000; Das et al., 2000; Giordano
et al., 2011; Goldbeck et al., 2006; Lu et al., 2007; Olson and
Phillips, 1997; Ouellet et al., 2003, 2006, 2007b, 2008; Watts et al.,
2001). Though the ter family (with ~1100 members) has only re-
cently been identified, a subset of ~10 members and several mutants
have been characterized extensively by both biochemical experi-
ments and computer simulations (Chodera et al., 2011; Dinner
et al., 2000; Elber, 2010; Perilla et al., 2015; Sotomayor and
Schulten, 2007). In this study, we utilize data from single—molecule
computer simulations of these hemeproteins to build a theoretical
model that is in statistical agreement with all the oxygen [30,, and leoff
values reported in the literature. Namely, all variables involved in
the model are relevant (corresponding coefficients are statistically
significant), model assumptions for quantifications are not violated

and the model achieves a high predictive ability. Considering the ac—
curacy of this model we are able to confirm the main factors that
control both ligand entry and exit for all the members studied and,
further, propose two quantitative approaches for predicting the oxy—
gen association and dissociation rate constants for the rest of the
family members. Because these rates largely determine the functions
of these hemeproteins, these approaches will be important tools in
characterizing ter members with unknown functions. Based on
our model, we propose strategies for predicting both the oxygen as—
sociation and dissociation rate constants for the rest of the family
members, which allows the development of whole family evolution—
ary and functional studies, as shown in Bustamante et al. (2016).

2 Methods

2.1 Set up of the systems and classical simulation
parameters

The protein structures for all herein studied cases correspond to the
following PDBids: 1IDR (Milani et al., 2001) (Mt-terN, from M.
tuberculosis), 1NGK (Milani et al., 2003) (Mt—terO), 2BMM
(Bonamore et al., 2005) (Tf—terO, from Thermobifida fusca),
4UUR (Giordano et al., 2015) (Ph—terO, from Pseudoalteromonas
baloplanletis), 2XYK (Pesce et al., 2011) (At-terO, from
Agrobacterium tumefaciens), 1UX8 (Giangiacomo et al., 2005 )
(Bs-terO, from Bacillus subtilis), 1DLY (Pesce et al., 2000) (Ce—
terN, from C. eugametos), 1DLW (Pesce et al., 2000) (Pc—terN,
from P. caudatum), 2BKM (Ilari et al., 2007) (Gs—terO from
Geobacillus stearotloermoploilus), 1RTX (Hoy et al., 2004) (Syn-
terN from Synecloocystis), 21G3 (Nardini et al., 2006) (Cj—terP
from Campylobacter jejuni) and 1VXG (Yang and Phillips Jr.,
1996) (sperm whale myoglobin). In all cases, the systems were built
and simulated according to the protocol of Giordano et al. (2015 ).
An unconstrained 50 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulation at
constant temperature (300 K) was performed for each simulated sys—
tem. In silico mutant proteins, i.e. single and double mutants of
some wild type (wt) forms, were built starting from the same crystal

structure as described above and mutated then using the tLEaP mod—
ule of the AMBER12 package (Pearlman et al., 1995). These mutant
structures were equilibrated and simulated using the same protocol
as that used for the wt form. All structures were found to be stable
during the timescale of simulations, as evidenced by the Root Mean
Square Deviation analyses (data not shown).

2.2 Oxygen migration free energy profiles

Free energy profiles for the OZ migration process along the protein
tunnel/cavity system were computed using the Implicit Ligand
Sampling (ILS) approach (Cohen et al., 2006, 2008), which has
been widely used to study these process and was shown previously
by our group to yield accurate results (Boron et al., 2015;
Bustamante et al., 2014; Forti et al., 2011; Marcelli et al., 2012).
In Supplementary Figure Sl, a comparison of OZ migration over
the same ters, sampled with both classical MD with a free expli-
cit oxygen molecule as well as with an implicit OZ molecule under
the ILS method is shown. We found that smaller barriers calcu—
lated by ILS method correspond to higher entry and exit rates by
using classical MD with explicit oxygen. In addition, our calcula—
tions agree with previous calculations of ters such as Mt—terN
and Mt—terO already reported using different methods (Bidon-
Chanal et al., 2006; Boechi et al., 2008; Cazade and Meuwly,
2012; Guallar et al., 2009; Mishra and Meuwly, 2009). ILS calcu—
lations were performed in a rectangular grid (0.5  resolution)
that includes the whole simulation box (i.e. protein and the solv—
ent), the used probe was an OZ molecule. Calculations were per—
formed on 5000 frames taken from the 50 ns of the production
simulations. The values for grid size, resolution and frame num-
bers were thoroughly tested in our previous work (Forti et al.,
2011). Analysis of the ILS data was performed using an ad boc
TCL program available under request, determining in each case
the magnitude of the corresponding wells and barriers scaled, so
that the free energy of the ligand in the bulk solvent is set to 0. In
order to present evidence of the ILS convergence, a plot of the
maximum free energy values along 250 ns for ters N and O
from M. tuberculosis as representative examples is shown
(Supplementary Fig. S2).

2.3 Oxygen binding energy (AEOZ)

QM—MM calculations were performed by geometry optimization of
a selected representative snapshot extracted from the MD simula-
tions. To select this representative snapshot we analyzed the hydro—
gen bond (HB) network that stabilizes the OZ molecule. In cases
where this network presented more than one stable conformation,
both conformations were considered as representative snapshots
and the overall AEQ2 value was calculated as an average of the two
computed AEQ2 values. The quantum part consisted of the heme
moiety without the carboxylic side chains, plus the proximal histi-
dine and the oxygen molecule. We have set the spin states of the
iron according to the experimental ones, singlet and quintuplet
states for the oxy and deoxy species, respectively. Even if OZ binding
to heme is a complex phenomenon and thus, an adequate quantita—
tive description requires high level ab initio multi—configurational
schemes (Kepp, 2013), DFT calculations yield reasonable compara—
tive results and have proven to achieve reliable results in a variety of
heme proteins in previous works from our group (Capece et al.,
2013).

OZ binding energies (AEQ2 , kcal/mol) were calculated as:

AEProt—Oz _ (E02 + EProt): 

where Epr0t_02 is the energy of the oxygenated protein, Eprot is the
energy of the deoxygenated protein and E02 is the energy of the iso—
lated oxygen molecule. The oxygenated proteins were simulated in
the singlet spin state, the deoxygenated proteins in the quintet spin
state and the free oxygen in the triplet state, which are the known
ground states for each case. All simulations were performed at the
unrestricted spin approximation. This method strategy has been
widely and successfully used in our group to study oxygen (as well
as other ligands) affinity in previous works (Capece et al., 2013). It
is well known that computed oxygen dissociation energies from the
heme are significantly overestimated due to the fact that a low (sing—
let) to high spin (quintet) transition is involved and DFT overesti—
mates the energy of the spin gap, favoring low spin configurations
(Scherlis et al., 2007). On the other hand, AEQ2 values are computed
for the optimized, i.e. best possible conformation at 0 K, and kinetic
values are computed at room temperature. Due to intrinsic errors of
the DFT—based QIVUMM methods, the computed energies are
strongly dependent on the exchange—correlation functional and basis
set. All these issues can be partially corrected standardizing the oxy-
gen binding energy. To do so, we define AAEOZ, that corresponds to
the AEQ2 (oxygen binding energy computed as described above in
Equation 1) and the difference between AEheme, the calculated oxy—
gen binding energy of an isolated imidazol bound heme in vacuum
(which is 22 kcal/mol at this level of theory) and free heme leoff value
(104 s ‘1) (Marti et al., 2006; Scott et al., 2001).

3 Results

3.1 Modeling the ligand association rate constant (km)
The Eyring equation is widely used to model bimolecular reactions
in the context of transition state theory:

AGi
k : [QB—T . e-ﬁ,

(2)
where AG:C is the Gibbs energy of activation, T is the temperature,
133, b and R are the Boltzmann, Planck and the universal gas con—
stants, respectively.

In our case, we constructed an Eyring model that includes the
free energy barrier to ligand entry through migratory tunnels, as
well as the free energy penalty for removing a water molecule from
the active site.

In our model, each tunnel or gate was considered independently
for each ter, taking into account that in every case one tunnel was
significantly more accessible than the others. In this sense, the high—
est barrier of the most accessible tunnel was considered as the free
energy barrier for oxygen entry, denoted AGE. This allows us to use
a pure simple statistical analysis, starting from a parsimonious
model. Because water molecules in the active site are stabilized
through HB interactions, the free energy of removing a water mol—
ecule was approximated as the product between the number of HB
interactions (nHB) between the water molecule and the surrounding
active site residues and the free energy of an HB interaction (AGHB).
We performed 50 ns of classical MD simulations with explicit
solvent molecules (that is ~5000 water molecules around the pro—
tein), allowing water molecules to explore and thus occupy key ac—
tive site positions. The nHB value was calculated as the average
number of hydrogen bound during those simulations. The individual
contributions of AGiln and nHB were then combined in the following
physical—chemical model for the theoretical value of lean:

where T : 300 K. The value of AGHB is a constant in the model,
however, because different values for AGHB have been reported in
the literature (between 2 and 5 kcal/mol), depending on the immedi-
ate environment, it is not possible for us to provide at this point
value of AGHB in our model (Markovitch and Agmon, 2007).

We will consider the logarithm form of Equation (3), such that it
becomes a linear model. All logarithms involved in the study are in
base 10. If we further assume that each experimental value for each
protein differs from the theoretical k0,, by an additive random error
(ei), we arrive at the following statistical model:

I 19 RT m: (4)
—AG
+ % .10g(e) . nHBi + €1-7

where the index i corresponds to the ith protein. We note that the
random error (6;) accounts for measurement errors, biological vari—
ability and possible misconceptions or incompleteness in the model.
The randomness of the error term 6; in Equation (4) turns this equa—
tion into a first statistical model, in the sense that it combines our
knowledge of the chemistry of the problem with the uncertainty
enclosed by the error.

There are two aspects involved in the construction of model (4).
On the one hand, the model suggests that AGE and um; are the vari—
ables that allow to linearly describe the behavior (in logarithm form)
of lean. On the other hand, it establishes in which ways these vari—
ables should be combined, by determining the value of the coeffi-
cient that accompanies AGE as well as the intercept, log(leBT/b).

To statistically validate each of these two aspects, we postulate
that log(leon) can be expressed as a linear combination of both pre—
dictors (AGE and rims), up to a random error term. Now, in contrast
to Equation (4), no restrictions on the coefficients are imposed. This
gives rise to the following statistical model:

lea/eon).- = 130 + 15—1, - loge) Act. +% - loge) m. + e. <5)

In addition, the errors are assumed to be Gaussian distributed
with mean 0 and constant standard deviation (linear model assump—
tions). Model (5) does not specify values for the coefficients ﬁj,
j = 0, 1, 2. However, if we let ﬁO :log(kBT/b),ﬁ1 : —1 and
ﬁg : —AGHB in model (5 ), we would recover model (4).

Note that ﬁ1 is a scaling factor that determines if the calculated
value for AGE is overestimated or underestimated, whereas ﬁg cor—
responds to the free energy of an HB interaction.

We adjust model (5 ) to obtain the best linear model for the re-
ported kon values for ters and Mb (11:26). Table 1 summarizes
the results of the fit. There were no constraints imposed on the coef—
ficients ﬁ0, ﬁ1 and ﬁg, such that they were free to take any value.
Finding the best fit to model (5 ) by least square regression we can
evaluate both the accuracy of the linear description of log(leon) with
the considered variables AGE and rims, as well as the proposed
values for the coefficients in model (4).

The linear model turned out to be accurate in describing the rela—
tion between the involved variables. The R2 was found to be 0.78,
meaning that 78% of the variability of log(leon) can be explained at
a linear level in terms of both explicative variables. The estimated
standard deviation of the error e, for model (5 ) was 0.56, which is
really small compared with the values observed for the response
variable (log(leon)), which range from N5 to 10.

All coefficients, ﬁ0, ﬁ1 and ﬁg, were found to be statistically sig—
nificant (the corresponding P-values are <0.05), which means that
there is evidence in the data supporting that each coefficient is differ-
ent from 0 in the model that includes all other explicative variables.
This affirmation tells us that the two variables, AGE and rims, are
relevant to explain log(leon) at the linear level. Moreover, both ex—
plicative variables are poorly correlated (squared correlation be—
tween variables AGE and am; is 0.09), meaning that they convey
different information, reinforcing the importance of including both
variables in the model. In Section 3.3 we present the validation of
the assumptions required for the statistical values (P—values and con—
fidence intervals) listed in Table 1.

Another way to evaluate the importance of both variables in the
model consists in modeling log(leon) by separately using either AGiin
or nHB. A very poor correlation with the experimental data was
found when either AGiin (R2:O.16) or nHB (R2:O.40) were used
alone. The coefficients (ﬁg and ﬁ1 or ﬁg and ﬁg, depending on the
reduced model), however, were found to be very similar to those in
the original model (data not shown). This evidence reinforces the
proposed multivariate linear model (5 ) that combines the two ex—
plicative variables.

The former results allow us to validate the linear model and con—
clude that both variables are not only necessary to describe [eon in
these proteins, but also that they essentially determine the ligand as—
sociation rate constant. Now it remains to corroborate the proposed
coefficients. The results shown in Table 1 support the proposed the—
oretical values of log(kBT/b) for ﬁg and —1 for ﬁ1, since both
log(kBT/b) and —1 are within their respective 95 % confidence
intervals. The 95% confidence interval for ﬁg is (—2.49, —1.48) and
also compatible with the range of values for AGHB in the literature
(Markovitch and Agmon, 2007). It is interesting to note that the fact
that ﬁ1 % —1 evidences that the ILS calculations are in the expected
range to predict [eon values under the presented model.

All these facts indicate that the proposed Eyring model (3) it—
self together with the proposed theoretical coefficients (or its range)
is conceptually adequate in describing the ligand association pro—
cess, meaning that the energetic barrier imposed by the protein ma—
trix as well as the stabilization of water molecules in the active sites
are the main factors controlling this physical—chemical process.

3.2 Modeling the ligand dissociation rate constant (koff)

As in the case of the ligand association, there are two phenomena
regulating the ligand dissociation process: breaking the Fe—Og bond
(AAEOZ) and further ligand migration from protein heme cavity to

the bulk solvent through the protein matrix (AGiout). Considering
that the oxygen release process is a unimolecular reaction, we pro—
pose the following model that includes both variables:

AAEO2 AGi

tot = e—T-e  (6)

This kind of approach has been used successfully by others

(Laverman and Ford, 2001; Laverman et al., 1997). As was previ—

ously done for the association constant, we consider a linear model

in logarithm form with the explicative variables AAEQ2 and AG:out
given by:

_ V_1. . V_2 . . i .
 _  +  log(e)  +  log(e) AGoutl. + 61'
(7)

Assuming that the two proposed variables are sufficient to de—
scribe log(leoff), the theoretical values for the coefficients are yo = 0,
yl : —1 and 372 : —1. By letting the coefficients to take any value,
we are able to adjust model (7) to obtain the best linear model for
the available data (71 = 13). The fitted values are shown in Table 2.

Even though the R2 value was high (R2:O.787), AG:out does
not contribute to describe log(leoff) when AAEQ2 is included in the
model, since the confidence interval for yg includes zero. This is in
accordance with the fact that the two variables, AG:out and AAEOZ,
were found to be highly correlated (squared correlation between
both variables is 0.55), suggesting that both explicative variables
may not be necessary. On the other hand, AAEQ2 was found to be
relevant in describing log(leoff) because its coefficient, yl, is signifi-
cantly different from 0 (P—value <0.05). The data also support the
proposed theoretical value of 0 for yo as suggested by model (6).
Hence, we now consider a linear model without the energetic barrier
AG:out given by:

log(leoffL- : yo —1— % - log(e) -AAEO,i —l— 6,. (8)

The fitted values for the coefficients yo and V1 are shown in
Table 2. The data, once again, support the assumed value of 0 for
yo. The sole inclusion of AAEQ2 is appropriate to model log(leoff) be—
cause this fit attains an R2 = 0.784, based on the available data. The
standard deviation of the errors 6, in model (8) was estimated to be
0.98.

Therefore, we conclude that model (7) is redundant, since, given
the value of AAEOZ, AG:out is not relevant to describe the linear be—
havior of log(leoff). Model (8), on the other hand, together with the
proposed coefficients are conceptually adequate in describing the
ligand dissociation process, meaning that only AAEOZ, and not
the oxygen escape through the migratory tunnels, is the dominant
factor controlling this process.

Usually, these assumptions are termed as normality of the errors.
We checked that our data support these assumptions through gra—
phical tools and statistical tests. For a detailed description of them
see Kutner et al. (2005 ). We define the ith residual for model (5 ) as
the difference between the observed log(leon),- and its corres—
ponding fitted value through model (5 ) (i.e. log(kon)i—
{11.81 — % - log(e) -AGEi — % - log(e) -nHBi}), where the
estimated values are those presented in Table 1. We proceed in the
same way with leoff, by using the estimated values for model (8) pre—
sented in Table 2.

Figure 2A shows the normal Q—Q plot of the residuals. A normal
Q—Q plot is a graphical method to assess the accuracy of the
Gaussian distribution for a given dataset (residuals in the present
setting) (Wilk and Gnanadesikan, 1968). Empirical quantiles
(y—coordinate) are plotted against the corresponding normal quan-
tiles (x—coordinate). The empirical quantiles are defined as the
ordered (ascending) observations. If the normal distribution assump—
tion is adequate, the points in the Q—Q plot will approximately lie
on a line. That is the case in both plots depicted in Figure 2A indicat—
ing that the normality distribution describes appropriately the re—
siduals from both models (5 ) and (8). Furthermore, a Shapiro—Wilks
goodness—of—fit test for testing normality applied to the residuals

gives a P—value : 0.99 for 120,, and 0.73 for leoff, supporting the nor—
mality assumption for the errors in models (5 ) and (8), respectively.
In Figure 2B, we plot the residuals versus the fitted values. The ab—
sence of structure in both graphs guarantees the correct assumption
of homoscedasticity for the errors of the models (5 ) and (8). All stat—
istical analyses were performed using freely distributed software R
(R Core Team, 2013).

3.4 Predicting ligand rate constants for k0,, and koff
Because the functions of the ters mainly depend on the rate at which
they uptake and release oxygen, and considering that those rates are
unknown for most of the members, it would be important to predict
both 120,, and [20,7 for all the ter family members. For some ters,
which can be used as leading cases, tentative but well—based functional
assignment is available considering their key structural and physico—
chemical characteristics. Taking Mt—terN as an example, this pro—
tein’s likely function is to detoxify NO through its oxidation to nitrate
by the oxy heme. To fulfill this task, a high oxygen stabilization is
required, and the presence of multiple tunnels with a high 120,, is likely
an important factor (Bidon—Chanal et al., 2006; Lama et al., 2009;
Mishra and Meuwly, 2010; Ouellet et al., 2008).

We propose two ways to predict these kinetic rate constants. The
first approach, which we call physical—chemically driven, uses the
Eyring equation with the theoretically proposed coefficients; the se—
cond approach, which we call statistically driven, does not account
for the theoretically proposed coefficients, rather it is just a linear
model in logarithmic scale of the data and uses the best—fit coeffi—
cients without restrictions. We point out that those best—fit coeffi—
cients are written in terms of RT to facilitate comparison with the
coefficients in the physical—chemically driven approach.

In the case of lean, specifically, the physical—chemically driven
equation takes the theoretically proposed values of ﬁg and ﬁ1
(ﬁO : log(leBT/b) and ﬁ1 : —1) and takes the value of ﬁg that gives
rise to the smallest residuals, once ﬁg and ﬁ1 are fixed. Namely, by
minimizing 2721(1og(k0n), — [log(leBT/la) — (1 /RT) -log(e) -AGE£+
(ﬁg/RT) -log(e) -nHBi])2, we find that ﬁg : —2.95. Therefore, the
first approach to predict k0,, is:

AGE 2.95~nHB

leonchem : ET - eT—T - e_ RT (9)
The second approach, as explained above, is purely data ori—

ented, and ignores prior knowledge of the relevant physical—chem—

ical constants, using only the best—fit coefficients (Table 1):

. i
— 11.81 _1.25 AGin _1.99.nHB
konstat — 10 - e RT - e RT . (10)

 

In both approaches, the proposed values for AGHB, 2.95 and 1.99,
are in the range of those previously published in the literature. Figure 3
depicts the accuracy of both predictive approaches, log(leonchem) and
log(konstat), showing their ability to correctly assign the order of the
experimental association rate constants. See Supplementary Table S1
to compare predicted with experimental values.

Both approaches result in comparatively similar predictions; we
note that predicted kinetic constants do not differ from the experi-
mentally reported values by more than an order of magnitude re—
gardless of the approach used. Similar to the case of lean, we propose
two approaches for predicting leoff values. The physical—chemical ap—
proach, denoted leoff chem:

In Figure 4, we plot experimental leoff values versus both 130,96

were able to correctly assign the order of the predictive experimental
constants. See Supplementary Table S2 to compare predicted with
experimental values.

4 Discussion

The predictive capacity of our models, together with the statistical
evaluation of the individual components included in each model,
provides a quantitative context in which we can understand the
main factors controlling ligand uptake and release in the ter fam—
ily. Whereas internal tunnels and water molecules in the active site
modulate ligand entry, the nature of the active site residues con—
trols the kinetics of oxygen release (Fig. 5). The coordination pro—
cess (kbond) accounts for the Og—FeII binding process once oxygen
is already in the active site with no surrounding water molecules.
Considering that we use the same ligand in any case and taking
into account that this process was shown to occur very fast, it was
not considered in our model (depicted in red in Fig. 5) (Franzen,
2002; Strickland and Harvey, 2007). In the same line, our statis—
tical analysis shows that Og migration to the solvent after the Og—
FeII bond breaking (AG:t

out

) is not relevant to explain leoff (Fig. 5 ).
In this sense, the results along the variability of the active site show
a high correlation, where the more stabilized the Og, the lower the
leoff measured. For example, in the case of the wt form of Mt—

terN, the key structural position at the active site labeled as B10,
occupied by a Tyr, is one of the major responsible residues for its
leoff; when this amino acid is mutated to Ala, the leoff increases sub—
stantially, because the coordinated oxygen is strongly destabilized.
The same trend can be observed for many cases of key amino acids,
including wt Mb versus its mutant form where the well—known
HisE7 is mutated to Gly, going from a leoff value of 15—1600 s_1.
For a deeper analysis of the conservation and variability of the ac—
tive sites along the ter family members, see Bustamante et al.
(2016).

Regarding the role of the internal tunnels, a clear example can be
observed comparing the wt and a single mutant form of Mt—terN,
where the mutation of a Val to a Phe at the structural position G8 pro—
motes a 10 times decrease in lean. It is important to note that these two
proteins have the same active site amino acids, except for the G8 pos—
ition that does not alter the water molecules, so the only difference ac—
counting for the 120,, is the internal tunnel contribution. In this case, the
Og needs to overcome a higher barrier along the tunnel to reach the ac—
tive site, mainly due to the size increase of the G8 amino acid, which is
reﬂected in a higher AGE and consecutively in a lower lean. For a com—
parison of all herein cases, see Supplementary Tables S1 and 82.

Overall, the varying capacity of main factors to modulate ligand
entry and escape translates to diverse biological functions for these
hemeproteins. For example, hemeproteins with fast oxygen uptake
(high lean) and fast release (high leoff) are generally oxygen transporters
(e.g. Hb and Mb); whereas those with fast uptake (high lean) and slow

release (low 130,7) generally undergo multiple ligand reactivity, since
oxygen has to enter quickly and stays inside until the second ligand
enters to react (e.g. terN from M. tuberculosis). It is interesting to
note that both entry and exit processes depend on active site inter—
actions, amino acids with positive charge density regions in the active
site can both delay oxygen entry by retaining water molecules, and
also delay oxygen exit by stabilizing the coordinated oxygen.

Our models suggest therefore, that the only way a protein can
control ligand entry without modifying ligand exit is by modifying
heme accessibility through tunnels or gates. Note that our model for
120,, does not account for internal hexacoordination phenomena,
which involves an active site amino acid occupying the sixth coord—
ination position of the iron center. Hence, our model describes the
120,, of pentacoordinated ters or the 120,, of the pentacoordinated
state of a hexacoordinated ter.

Notice that the error values, 6,, in models (5 ), (7) and (8) include
the error inherent in the model as well as in the experimental meas—
urements. For both 120,, (model (5 )) and leoff (models (7) and (8)), the
error was of the same order of magnitude as the variance among the
experimental rate constants reported independently in the literature
by different groups and techniques. This result strongly supports the
absence of any significant theoretical misconceptions in the con—
struction of the models themselves.

A special consideration should be given to the R2 value, which,
although is a good indicator of the goodness of fit of the correspond—
ing model, it does not suffice to judge its accuracy. A clear example

of this problem is found in our analysis of the dissociation rate con—
stants, leoff. The R2 values for models (7) and (8) are both reasonably
high and nearly indistinguishable (0.787 and 0.784, respectively),
even though one of the variables used in model (7) does not make a
significant contribution to log(leoff). Based on the R2 values alone,
both models could be interpreted as being equally accurate, however
by further analyzing the P—values and correlation of the variables
used in the models we could conclude that the reduced model (8) is
more accurate than model (7).

Making extrapolations to the rest of the ter members (~1100) is
risky considering that we do not yet have evidence about the behavior
of the process among the rest of the family members. However, since
our analysis was made for mutant proteins that were mostly designed
to explore the widest range of 120,, and leoff values, and considering
that the family of proteins does share a common fold and relevant
residues, it is possible to predict 120,, and [20,7 for the other members of
the family as well. We proposed two approaches and discussed their
pros and cons. The theoretically driven approach uses prior physical—
chemical knowledge, therefore it is not strictly limited to a specific
subset of proteins; although its coefficients are not the best possible
for the available data. The statistically driven approach, which uses
the best fitting values of the available data, is strongly related to this
small subset of available proteins. In any case, both predictions seem
to be very similar for the available data to date, they do not differ by
more than one order of magnitude.

5 Conclusion

By performing a rigorous statistical analysis we establish the key fac—
tors that control ligand uptake and release in all the studied ters.
We found that internal tunnels as well as the distal site water mol—
ecules control ligand uptake, whereas oxygen stabilization by distal
site residues controls ligand release. We also proposed two quantita—
tive approaches to predict 120,, and leoff, within an order of magni-
tude, for the rest of the (around 1 100) ter family members.

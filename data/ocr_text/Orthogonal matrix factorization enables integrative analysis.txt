Abstract

Motivation: RNA binding proteins (RBPs) play important roles in post—transcriptional control of
gene expression, including splicing, transport, polyadenylation and RNA stability. To model
protein—RNA interactions by considering all available sources of information, it is necessary to inte—
grate the rapidly growing RBP experimental data with the latest genome annotation, gene function,
RNA sequence and structure. Such integration is possible by matrix factorization, where current
approaches have an undesired tendency to identify only a small number of the strongest patterns
with overlapping features. Because protein—RNA interactions are orchestrated by multiple factors,
methods that identify discriminative patterns of varying strengths are needed.

Results: We have developed an integrative orthogonality—reguIarized nonnegative matrix factoriza—
tion (iONMF) to integrate multiple data sources and discover non—overlapping, class—specific RNA
binding patterns of varying strengths. The orthogonality constraint halves the effective size of the
factor model and outperforms other NMF models in predicting RBP interaction sites on RNA. We
have integrated the largest data compendium to date, which includes 31 CLIP experiments on 19
RBPs involved in splicing (such as hnRNPs, U2AF2, ELAVL1, TDP—43 and FUS) and processing of
3’UTR (Ago, IGFZBP). We show that the integration of multiple data sources improves the pre—
dictive accuracy of retrieval of RNA binding sites. In our study the key predictive factors of protein—
RNA interactions were the position of RNA structure and sequence motifs, RBP co—binding and
gene region type. We report on a number of protein—specific patterns, many of which are consistent
with experimentally determined properties of RBPs.

1 Introduction

RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play a major role in the control of gene
expression. Misregulation of RBPs is associated with diseases such as
fragile X syndrome, neurologic disorders and cancer (Darnell, 2013).
Our understanding of protein—RNA interaction has been greatly im-
proved by the use of genomic methods such as individual—nucleotide
resolution UV crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (iCLIP), which
identifies RBP crosslinking sites on a genome—wide scale. Past iCLIP
studies have shown that RBPs bind and regulate a large number of
transcripts. Computational analysis and prediction of these inter—
actions is therefore critical to gain a comprehensive understanding of
RBP functions (Dieterich et al., 2013).

Current approaches to model protein—RNA interactions focus
on individual data sources and require precise structural knowledge
of the involved proteins (Cirillo et al., 2013; Klus et al., 2014; Puton
et al., 2012). They rarely exploit other available omics data. General
approaches such as Bayesian networks (Zhang et al., 2010), Hidden
Markov models (Zhang et al., 2013), or SVMs (Livi et al., 2014),
have been applied to model protein—RNA interactions using mul-
tiple data sources. However, their application was limited to indi-
vidual RBPs and the importance of only a limited number of
features governing protein—RNA interaction were highlighted, such
as single degenerate motifs. The lack of presented features is partly
due to the difficulties associated with interpretation of inferred mod-
els. We have developed a modeling technique based on multiple ma-
trix factorization that is capable of integrating data sources for
multiple RBPs. The generated models are both accurate and inter—
pretable. New biological knowledge can be gained by exploring the
identified combinatorial effects among various features of data sour—
ces that define patterns of protein—RNA binding sites on RNA.

Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) methods have been ex—
tensively applied in machine learning for clustering, community de-
tection, classification, etc. (Carmona—Saez et al., 2006; Gao et al.,
2005; Wang et al., 2013). The classic NMF algorithm (Lee et al.,
2001) finds an approximation of a data matrix that is described as a
product of two or more matrices with lower ranks — a factor model.
An advantage of NMF is the interpretable, parts—based representa—
tion of patterns present in the data. This is due to the latent factors
being constrained to non—negative values, which can then be com—
bined in an additive way to approximate the original data.

Integrative NMF approaches provide biologically meaningful re-
sults in various bioinformatics applications. For example, NMF was
used to integrate multiple matrices with a common dimension and
to discover miRNA and gene regulatory modules (Zhang et al.,
2011), or to discover modules of genes, miRNA targets and DNA
methylation markers in cancer patients (Zhang et al., 2012).

Various improvements of the NMF algorithm have been sug—
gested to obtain more comprehensive models. The sparsity of factor
models improves the interpretability and modularity of projections.
Sparsity is achieved by including L1 norm constraints on the model
coefficients. Alternatively, the L1/L2 norm ratio of the resulting pro-
jection can be explicitly tuned (Hoyer, 2004), which produces
sparser solutions, but does not guarantee modularity. Other meth—
ods constrain the basis vectors to convex sets (Ding et al., 2010;
Guan et al., 2012). The mentioned methods, however, do not focus
on modular decompositions where samples and features do not
overlap within clusters. This is a substantial drawback when classes
are discriminated by multiple patterns of varying strengths. This
phenomenon is common in the domain of protein—RNA inter-
actions, as strong patterns, e.g. U—rich tracts present in binding sites
(Konig et al., 2010) of many proteins, may occlude weaker signals

that discriminate between proteins. A possible solution is to require
the basis vectors found by NMF to be orthogonal. One such ex—
ample is the orthogonality—constrained NMF (Ding et al., 2006) that
assumes an initial orthogonal model, e.g. obtained by k—means clus—
tering, which may bias the final model.

We have developed an integrative, art/9ogonality-regularized
nonnegative matrix factorization method (iONMF). The method
finds modular projections of data matrices, where data instances are
assigned to modules described by non—overlapping features. In a
supervised setting, orthogonality regularization prevents multicolli-
nearity (Chatterjee et al., 2015; Nicodemus et al., 2009), where a
feature vector can be expressed as a linear combination of a subset
of remaining feature vectors. This is important, as RBPs differ in
specificity and their binding target patterns differ in number and
strength. We applied iONMF on the largest integrative analysis in
the number of RBPs and different data sources used. The analysis
included a compendium of 31 published CLIP experiments on 19
RBPs and other genomic data sources to predict RBP crosslinking
sites at a nucleotide—resolution. We discovered discriminative pat—
terns across different data sources and learned a comprehensive
model of protein—RNA interaction for each of the 19 RBPs. We
visualized the discovered patterns and used them to cluster RBPs
into functionally related groups. Our results demonstrate the applic—
ability of iONMF for fast and accurate prediction of RBP target sites
on a genome—wide scale.

2 Methods

2.1 Data sources and sampling

We analyzed data on 19 proteins with one or more experimental
replicates, 31 experiments in total. Three experimental protocols
were used to determine protein—RNA crosslinking sites: PAR-CLIP:
Ago/EIF2C1-4, IGFZBP1-3, PUMZ (Hafner et al., 2010); Ag02—
MNase, ELAVL1, ELAVL1—MNase, ELAVL1A (Kishore et al.,
2011); ESWR1, FUS, TAF15 (Hoell et al., 2011); MOV10 (Sievers
et al., 2012); iCLIP: hnRNPC, U2AF2 (Zarnack et al., 2013);
hnRNPC (Konig et al., 2010); hnRNPL, hnRNPL-like (Rossbach
et al., 2014); Nsun2 (Hussain et al., 2013); TDP—43 (Tollervey et al.,
2011); TIA1, TIAL1 (Wang et al., 2010); CLIP-SEQ/HITS-CLIP:
Ag02, ELAVL1 (Kishore et al., 2011); eIF4AIII (Sauliere et al.,
2012); SRSF1 (Sanford et al., 2009); Ag02 (Boudreau et al., 2014).
When clusters of interaction sites were reported (e.g. PAR—CLIP,
Ago/EIF2C1-4), we treated all positions within clusters as interact—
ing. Technical or biological replicates of the same selected RBP were
grouped. We use the term experimental group to refer to one such
group; see Supplementary Table Sl. Data were obtained from ser—
vers iCount (http://icount.biolab.si) and DoRiNA (Anders et al.,
2012)

2.1.1 Sampling of crosslinked sites

In each experiment, we first identified up to 100 000 nucleotide pos—
itions with the highest cDNA counts. These were used as a pool of
positive examples of protein—RNA crosslinking nucleotides. Among
positions, which were less than 15 nucleotides apart, we considered
only the positions with the highest cDNA count and ignored all
others within a 15—nucleotide distance, as suggested in the original
iCLIP publication (Konig et al., 2010). With this step we prevented
the sampling of consecutive genomic positions, which are very simi-
lar in composition. Among neighboring positions with the same
cDNA count, one was randomly picked. To reduce processing time
and ensure comparable results among experiments, we sampled up

to 10 000 positions. For proteins with less than 20 000 identified
crosslinking sites, we randomly split the sites into training and test
sets. Including more positive examples did not change the predictive
performance of our models (Supplementary Fig. S1). Negative ex—
amples of protein—RNA interaction sites were sites within genes that
were not detected as interacting in any experiment (in total 1 293
531 975 sites). Among them we sampled at least 40 000 positions
and used them as negative examples of crosslinking nucleotides. In
total, the training set included 50 000 positions (Fig. 1a,b) which
were uniformly drawn from the genome.

The test set (Fig. 1c) was constructed similarly. To assure a clear
separation between the two sets, positions for the test set were
sampled only from genes not used for training. The total number of
detected clusters and crosslink sites are listed in Supplementary
Table Sl.

2.1.2 Data matrices
Each training data matrix included up to 50 000 rows. For experi—
ments performed on a smaller number of rows, the number is expli-

citly stated. Each row represents a nucleotide position described

(d) Samples are assigned to modules based on rows in W. Row p in  de-
scribes the characteristic feature values of each module (p)

using various data sources. The number of columns varies for each
data source:

Y: selected RBP experiment CLIP cDNA count, 50000 x 1. pro-
tein—RNA cDNA counts are reported for a selected RBP experiment
on the current nucleotide position (in row), resulting in 1 column.
This column was used for model fitting and to evaluate the predict—
ive performance.

XCLIP: other proteins CLIP cDNA counts, 50000 x 3131. For
each of the remaining (up to 30) RBP experiments that were not
from the same group as the selected RBP experiment, the cDNA
counts at positions [—50.50] relative to the current nucleotide (in
row) were reported as 1 for nonzero cDNA counts or 0 otherwise,
resulting in up to 30 X 101 = 3030 columns. By explicitly ignoring
experiments within the same replicate group (shown in
Supplementary Table Sl), we assured that replicate information was
not used in evaluation.

XRG, Region type, 50000 x 5 05 . Each position [—5 0.5 0] relative
to the current nucleotide (in row) was assigned into five types of
gene regions, as determined by the Ensembl annotation version
ensembl69 for human genome assembly hg19 (Hubbard et al.,
2002): exon, intron, 5’UTR, 3’UTR, CDS, resulting in 5 x 101 :
5 05 columns. Precise boundaries of regions near crosslink sites could
thus be captured. For each gene region type, its presence at a relative
position was indicated with a binary value.

XRNA, RNA secondary structure, 50000 x 101. Sequences at
positions [—50.50] relative to the current nucleotide (in row) were
processed with RNAfold software (Denman, 1993), resulting in
probabilities of double—stranded RNA secondary structure at each of
101 relative positions.

XKMER: RNA k-mers, 50000 X 25856. Positions [—50.50] rela—
tive to the current nucleotide (in row) were scanned for the presence
of RNA le-mers, with la : 4 in all experiments. The presence of a
le—mer at a relative position was indicated with a binary value.

XGO, Gene annotation. Genomic positions within known genes
were annotated with Gene Ontology (Ashburner et al., 2000) terms
for goa_loumcm, 39560 terms (revision 5758736 from 2014—10—06).

Test data matrices (Y, XCLIP, XRG, XRNA, XKMER, XGO) have the
same structure, but they described a different subset of positions not
included in the training set.

2.2 Analysis overview

A factor model of the training set was inferred with iONMF
(Fig. 1a). The resulting coefficient matrix W determined the group—
ing of nucleotides into r modules, based on similarity across all data
sources. A module is defined as characteristic features in each data
source, represented as a column vector in matrices Hi, correspond-
ing to: co—binding to the same targets as other RBPs (HCLIP), RNA
k-mers (HKMER), surrounding region types (HRG), RNA secondary
structure (HRNA) and Gene Ontology terms (HGO) (Fig. 1b).

Having learned the coefficient and basis matrices with iONMF,
we estimated the crosslinking affinity of the samples in the test set
for all RBP experiments (columns) in the target Y column (Fig. 1d).
The test samples were projected into the learned low dimensional
space spanned by W, using all additional data sources (XCLIP, XRG,
XRNA, XKMER, XGQ) that describe the test set. Each step is described
in detail in the following.

Threefold cross—validation was used to estimate the predictive
accuracy. Internal cross—validation (80% /20% sampling, repeated
three times) on the training set was used to select best hyperpara—

meter values.

2.3 Integrative orthogonality—reguIarized nonnegative
matrix factorization (iONMF)

Data sources are represented with matrices X), with m rows repre-
senting samples and 11,- columns representing features from each data
source. The classic NMF approximates each X,- E Rmxm with a fac—
tor model — a product of a common coefficient matrix W E Rm”
and data source—specific basis matrices H,- E Rm”, where the rank
r << min(m, 21-11,). Empirically, a low approximation error model
is achieved when patterns repeat across multiple data sources.

Each sample (row) is assigned to one or more of the r modules,
which is reﬂected by the learned weights in W. Features relevant to
each module are reflected in corresponding basis vectors in H,- (rows
in H?) Highly correlated positions are assigned to common mod—
ules, depending on their similarity across all data sources Xi.

Non—overlapping features relevant to each module are obtained
by imposing orthogonality on the basis vectors. Therefore, we de—
veloped integrative, Orthogonality—regularized NMF (iONMF),
which employs the scalarization approach for orthogonality regular—
ization, optimizing the trade—off between orthogonality and ap—
proximation error. The iONMF model is learned by solving the
following optimization problem. Given multiple data matrices Xi,

minimize the cost function:

N
mm» = mez- — WH? 11% + ocIIHzTHz — 111%) <1)
i=1

such that W, H,- 2 0 and I is the identity matrix. The first term in the
sum represents approximation error and second term the orthogon—
ality of column vectors in H), where the trade—off is controlled by
hyperparameter or. The problem is non—convex and can be solved by
(projected) gradient descent, alternating—least squares (Lee et al.,
2001), multiplicative update rules (Lin, 2007) or second order gradi—
ent methods (Zdunek et al., 2006). Due to computational efficiency
and a principled way to include orthogonality and non—negativity
constraints, we propose an iterative multiplicative update Algorithm 1,
which is an instance of gradient descent with variable learning rate.
The algorithm starts by initializing the values in W and H,- randomly,
uniformly distributed on [0,1], and updates them with the following
rules until convergence:

   
 
 

Z Xin'
i

Z WHiTH,

 

xfw + 01H,-

H; = H; O 3
\/H,-WTW + 2aH,H,TH,- ( )

 

where 0 represents the element—wise (Hadamard) product. The treat—
ment of the target column vector Y and its corresponding basis ma—
trix Hy is equivalent to other data sources except for the
orthogonality constraints, which are not used since Hy consists only
of a single column. Further discussion on the choice of algorithm,
derivation of update rules, relation to gradient descent, and conver—
gence to a stationary point are shown in Supplementary Section S2.
The algorithm is run for multiple random initializations and the fac—
tor model with the lowest approximation error is selected.

time. A common assumption when applying NMF for prediction is
that all objects in the domain, including the test samples, are used in
learning (Yoo et al., 2009). Cold—start approaches (Zhou et al.,
2011) or regression on the obtained factors (Joshi et al., 2010) can
be used to predict test samples. Alternatively, non—negative least—
squares optimization is used to approximate the coefficient matrix
values from available matrices describing new samples (Zitnik et al.,
2015). These methods suffer from substantial drawbacks, namely
the requirements of additional functions/classifiers, high computa—
tional cost, or lack of interpretability.

Our model-based approach reuses the learned low—rank matrices
to predict test samples. Having learned the iONMF model of cDNA
counts on a smaller subset of genomic positions, we therefore used it
to predict cDNA counts for all other genomic positions (matrix Y).
Predicted counts were in turn used to classify positions as cross—
linked or not crosslinked.

Algorithm 2 uses the learned factor model to address the prob—
lems mentioned above and is a special case of Algorithm 1. Given
the learned and fixed basis matrices Hi, Hy, and new samples with
known 59-, we use the update rule 2 to first solve for W and then
predict Y = 

2.5 Discovering relevant modules and features

The obtained coefficient matrix W is used to assign data samples (in
rows) to specific modules (in columns); see Figure 1d. The values of
W are determined based on all X,- and define the modules, while in-
dividual H,- are determined based only on the corresponding data
sources X).

Proposed methods include assigning the sample to the module
with maximum row value or restricting the assignment to only one
module (Brunet et al., 2004). Alternatively, the ability to assign sam—
ples to multiple modules may be desired. One such approach, de—
veloped by Zhang et al. (2012), converts each entry in the
coefficient matrix to the corresponding column—wise z—score.
Samples are assigned to modules where the corresponding z—score
exceeds a predefined threshold (empirically set to 1.96). For each of
the r modules, we obtain a count C, of how many samples are
related to the corresponding module.

Since we are interested in modules describing the positive data
samples (crosslinked sites) for a particular protein in question, we
sorted the modules on descending value of C7. The corresponding
(column) vectors of matrices H,- were then examined to discover the
relevant features of each data source that determine protein cross—
linking and binding (see Fig. 1d).

To extract complex RNA motifs of arbitrary length from the
k-mer frequency and positional information encoded in the learned
factor model (HKMER), we used an approach similar to Hutchins
et al. (2008). In contrast, we consider all data sources to identify the
sequence motifs and their positional distribution associated with
protein binding. For details on the algorithm, see Supplementary
Section S76 and Supplementary Algorithm 2.

3 Results and discussion

3.1 Predictive performance

We compared iONMF against factorization methods using various
constrained optimization techniques: NMF with multiplicative up—
dates (Zhang et al., 2012); Sparse NMF (SNMF) using alternating
non—negative least—squares with L1 regularization (Kim et al., 2007);
NMF—QNO using quasi—newton optimization and L1 regularization
(Zdunek et al., 2006).

For each RBP experiment, the methods were run on the training
set for three different initializations. The model with the lowest ap—
proximation error was used for prediction of the test set with
Algorithm 2 (adapted for NMF, SNMF and NMF—QNO to assume
fixed Hi). Samples were projected into the low dimensional space W
to predict  Empirically, algorithms converged in less than 100 iter—
ations (change in cost function value < 10‘6). The factorization
rank was set to r = 10 for all methods.

We used cross—validation on the training set of 30 000 positions to
choose hyperparameters: orthogonality regularization or (iONMF), L1
regularization (SNMF, NMF—QNO). Hyperparameters were sampled
from range [10‘3’ ..103 The reported predictive performances are
measured with the Area under ROC curve (AUC) on the prediction
on the independent hold—out test set of size 1000. Prediction using
iONMF resulted in highest AUC in 24 out of 31 cases. iONMF,
NMF and NMF—QNO methods consistently outperformed SNMF.
The critical distance diagram (Demsar, 2006) shown in Table 1 con—
firms the statistical significance (P < 0.05) of the observed differences
in ranks of classifiers over multiple datasets, confirming the feasibility
of orthogonality as a way to induce discriminative and parsimonious
factor models.

We compared iONMF with GraphProt and RNAContext on the
same dataset used by Maticzka et al. (2014). iONMF performed best
on 13 out of 24 RBP experiments (AUC = 0.907i0.041). Critical dif-
ference diagrams show equivalent performance of iONMF and
GraphProt (AUC : 0.887 i 0.079), while RNAContext was signifi-
cantly lower (AUC:0.830i 0.119), see Supplementary Section S3
for details.

Next, we investigated the inﬂuence of hyperparameter or on
sparseness and average angle between vectors in H). Higher angle val-
ues indicate greater orthogonality of the respective vectors.
Supplementary Figure S2 shows the average AUC across all 31 experi—
ments with varying at. As or is increased, sparseness (Hoyer, 2004)

increases from 0.46 to 0.79, effectively halving the number of non-
zero model parameters. Also, the pairwise angle between vectors in
H,- increases from 650 to 900. Even for extreme values of or, AUC
changes from 0.88 to 0.83. We compared the feature vectors found
by all factorization methods in more detail, see Supplementary
Section 84.2.

A single run of iONMF model training for a single RBP experi-
ment runs for 12 minutes on a 2.5 GHz CPU. With a trained model,
prediction is performed at a rate 300 000 positions/h.

3.2 Estimating the importance of combinations of data
sources

To estimate the importance of data sources, we measured AUC as
stated above, for each possible subset of data sources and each se—
lected RBP experiment (Supplementary Tables 87—89 for AUC of in—
dividual experiments). We then calculated the average AUC and
standard error obtained for each data source subset across all se—
lected RBP experiments, shown in Figure 2 and Supplementary
Table S6. To ensure fair comparison, the factorization rank r was
selected such that the total number of model parameters was ap—
proximately equal for each subset of data sources (Supplementary
Table S6).

We turn to estimation of the importance or particular data sour—
ces. According to AUC, the most informative data source is RNA
structure (col. R, average AUC : 0.744 i 0.024, Fig. 2,
Supplementary Table S6). This agrees with previous observations
about the importance of particular RNA structure interaction inter-
faces (Kazan et al., 2010; Li et al., 2010), but may also reflect the
need for RNA bases to be single stranded to allow UV crosslinking
(Sugimoto et al., 2012). The second most informative data source is
information on interaction of other proteins within the same gene
region (col. C, average AUC : 0.732 i 0.018, Fig. 2,
Supplementary Table S6). This agrees with combinatorial protein—
RNA interactions that compete or cooperate for RNAs binding
(Chan et al., 2014; Jens and Rajewsky, 2015), but may also indicate
that many RNA nucleotides may have generally increased accessibil—
ity and crosslinking efficiency.

The most informative pair of data sources are RNA le—mers (K)
and type of genomic region (T) with average AUC : 0.860 : 0.017
(col. KT, Fig. 2, Supplementary Table S6). These features describe
the genomic organization and sequence content biases of functional
subunits, e.g. exon, intron, UTR and exon—intron boundaries.

The poor performance when using XGO alone (col. G, AUC :
0.492 : 0.008, Fig. 2, Supplementary Table S6) is likely due to
sparse and incomplete gene function annotation, which is in great
contrast to other data sources that are two orders of magnitude
denser (density of XGO is 0.01%, while density of XRG is 16%).
Inclusion of XGO into the most informative subset (col. CKRT,
AUC : 0.920 i 0.006, Fig. 2, Supplementary Table S6) does not

Fig. 2. Average AUCs over 31 experiments, for all combinations of data sour-
ces: CLIP experiments (C; XCLIP), RNA k-mers (K; XKMER), region type (T; XRG),
Gene Ontology terms (G; XGO) and RNAfold structure prediction (R; XRNA)

change the predictive accuracy significantly (col. CGKRT, AUC :
0.886 i 0.011, Fig. 2, Supplementary Table S6).

The average AUC correlates with the total number of included
data sources. The best accuracy was achieved on {XCLIP,XKMER,
XRNA, XRG}, col. CKRT. Except for XGO, combining two or more
data sources resulted in better accuracy than in models obtained on
individual data sources, supporting the benefit of data integration. A
more detailed, Spearman correlation—based comparison of all data
source combinations confirms several binding preferences supported
by the literature (Supplementary Section S6 and Supplementary
Fig. 85).

3.3 Identifying factors associated with RBP binding
Factor models were used to identify features associated with
each discovered module. As explained in Section 2.5 and shown in
Figure 1d, each module reveals common feature values of cross—
linked sites (samples) assigned to the module. These values are re—
ﬂected in H), one row for each of r modules. The identified modules
of crosslinked sites with common features were visualized and used
to predict functionally relevant protein—RNA interactions.
Visualization of a complete set of RBP experiments and the
three most relevant feature vectors are shown in Supplementary
Section S8.

In the following paragraphs we present the results and provide
an explanation for U2AF2 [30], a known splicing factor, where the
most informative single data sources are XKMER (AUC : 0.754),
XRG (AUC : 0.695), XCLIP (AUC : 0.632), XRNA (AUC : 0.554),
XGO (AUC : 0.372); see Supplementary Table S9. The most inform-
ative data subset is {XCLIP, XKMER, XRNA, XRG} (AUC = 0.933).

Integrative analysis of multiple RNA binding proteins

RNA decreases around its crosslinked sites. Features in HRNA are
shown in Figure 3. Hierarchical clustering of feature vectors in
HRNA are shown in Supplementary Figures S8, S9 and
Supplementary Section 88.3.

RBP co-binding and k-mer composition. Examining features in
HCLIP , one is able to discover factors associated with binding of in-
dividual or groups of RBPs. The features that are common to each
module allow us to define hypotheses on cooperative or competitive
binding of multiple proteins, which can then be experimentally
tested. Figure 3 shows results for U2AF2. It also shows that splicing
factor hnRNPC interacts with the same RNA positions as U2AF2.
Competition between the two is reported by (Zarnack et al., 2013).
The two factors also share similar binding motifs (compare Fig. 3
and k—mers in Supplementary Section S8.1). The relationship is fur-
ther confirmed by recognition of U-rich motifs, appearing in the cor-
responding module in XKMER.

Orthogonality regularization provides an advantage in interpret—
ation over NMF. iCLIP and CLIP based methods are subject to a
U—rich sequence preference due to UV—C cross—linking. As reported
previously (Sugimoto et al., 2012), the detection of U—rich motifs
may occur at crosslinks for RBPs not associated with U—rich tracts,
such as TDP—43 (Supplementary Fig. S4). The NMF method dis—
covers both U—rich motif and known tandem UG repeats in a single
module (column vector in HKMER), while iONMF successfully dis—
tinguishes the two. Assigning the data samples to corresponding
modules (Section 2.5), 41.6% of positive samples are related to UG—
rich component, while 80.3% are related to U—tracts (note that the
two sets are overlapping). The similarity of proteins based on k-mer
composition and co—binding is shown in Supplementary Figures S6,
S7, S10 and Supplementary Sections 88.1, 88.4.

Region type. Figure 3 shows HRG features for U2AF2. The in-
tron—exon boundary can be seen at ~30 nucleotides upstream from
the crosslinked site. This is expected since U2AF2 is a splicing factor
that generally crosslinks to a 3’ splice site (Zarnack et al., 2013).
Protein similarity based on region types is shown in Figure 4b, con—
firming the ability of iONMF feature vectors to cluster the proteins
into functionally related groups. Detailed data is shown in

Sequence motif content and positioning. Figure 3 shows the se-
quence content and positions of RNA sequence le—mers (features in
HKMER) for U2AF2. The most associated k—mers are U—rich and are
similar to recognition sites of hnRNPC, an experimentally con-
firmed competitor for the same binding sites (Zarnack et al., 2013).
Co—binding of the two can be seen in HCLIP matrices; see
Supplementary Section 884.

Gene annotation. Gene Ontology terms associated with targets
of RBPs are shown in Supplementary Section 88.5 and in
Supplementary Figure S12.

3.4 Comparison with previously known motifs

We estimated more complex and longer motifs from features in
HKMER, as explained in Supplementary Section 87.6. For example,
Supplementary Figure S14 shows the top ranked 4—mers from data
on PUM2 [23], and the reconstructed complex motif UGUANAUA,
using the algorithm described in Supplementary Section 87.6. The
identified motif perfectly matches the motif reported for PUM2 in
(Hafner et al., 2010). Supplementary Figure S14 also shows that the
log probability of motif presence increases significantly in the vicin-
ity of the crosslinked sites compared to the presence in random pos—
itions within protein coding genes. This important result shows the
partial information in 4-mers can be used to infer longer and com—
plex motifs.

To validate our approach, we compared the identified motifs
with motifs obtained from the in vitro RNAcompete assay (Ray
et al., 2013). We compared motifs of nine RBPs that are included in
both studies. Motifs were aligned to minimize the Levenshtein dis-
tance (D) between motifs derived with the procedure from
Supplementary Section 87.6. Ten out of twelve motifs match their
reported counterparts with D g 1; see Supplementary Figure S15
for results and visual rendering of the comparison. Moreover, the
discovered motif agree in large part to GraphProt (Maticzka et al.,
2014)

To identify groups of proteins with similar interaction proper-
ties, we performed k—means clustering on binding motif preference.
We obtained 10 candidate motifs for each RBP (310 motifs in
total; see Supplementary Section S7.6). Using k—means clustering
(la : 20), we reduced the set to 20 most common complex motifs.
For each experiment and for each of the 20 selected motifs, we cal—
culated the log odds ratio of observed versus expected occurrence
in positive and negative positions. These values were then used in
hierarchical clustering of proteins and motifs; see Figure 4a. For
clustering and motif weblogos obtained for la : 50, see
Supplementary Figure S13.

Four groups of proteins and three groups of motifs can be seen.
We found that hnRNP proteins that bind to introns to regulate
splicing bind to U-rich motifs (hnRNPs, U2AF2, ELAVL1, TDP-
43, TAF15, FUS, QKI), whereas those binding to exons to regulate
splicing (SR), spliced mRNA (eIF3E3), or 3 UTR (Ago, IGF2BP)
mRNA are GC-rich, in agreement with the fact that introns are
U—rich, and exons are GC—rich (Amit et al., 2012; Aznarez et al.,
2008). Motifs associated with hnRNPC, e.g. GGCUGG,
GCCCAG, CCUGCC, GCCGGG, commonly occur in antisense
Alu elements next to the U—tract that directly interacts with
hnRNPC (Supplementary Figs S16 and S17). Hence, iONMF can
detect common neighboring motifs even if these are not part of the
primary binding site.

4 Conclusion

Computational approaches already play a crucial role in protein—
RNA interaction prediction by aiding experiment planning and
interpretation of results. Genome—wide assays of protein—RNA inter—
action mapping (Castello et al., 2012) has identified close to a thou—
sand human RNA—binding proteins. Data on RNA binding proteins
is growing rapidly, emphasizing the need for integrative methods
which jointly consider all available data sources.

An interesting finding of our study is that in addition to RNA
structure and sequence, the position relative to genomic features
(exons, etc.) and CLIP data of other RBPs is informative for predict-
ing binding sites of a specific RBP. Genomic regions are informative
as many proteins bind at specific positions relative to these features,
e.g. U2AF2 generally binds upstream of exons (Fig. 3). We show
that CLIP data are predictive, as subsets of examined RBPs exhibit
similar binding patterns (Fig. 4, Supplementary Figs 86—813 and
Supplementary Section S8.4). Importantly, overlap is only seen be—
tween a subset of RBPs, but we find no evidence that some sites or
features are generally shared across all RBPs. While contribution of
non—specific background should be considered, we find it most likely
that co—binding profiles result from biologically relevant features.
For example, many RBPs bind to similar RNA sequences or struc—
tures (Supplementary Figs S6—S9, 813).

Several of the examined RBPs are known to bind similar motifs,
such as the U—rich motifs bound by ELAVL, TIA, hnRNPC and
U2AF2, which are also detected in our analyses (Fig. 4). Moreover,
RBPs may interact at the protein level, either directly or indirectly
via co—factors, which could stabilize their binding to proximal RNA
sites. Few experimental studies have explored the impact of protein—
protein interactions on coordinated RNA binding, but our analyses
could be used to explore such potential interactions in the future.

Data integration in iONMF yields improvements in accuracy
when compared to state—of—the—art approaches. Orthogonality regu—
larization favors non—overlapping and sparse solutions, which are
desired by domain experts, providing class—specific descriptions and

model interpretation. The resulting predictions are in strong accord—
ance with a published in vitro study and identified a number of
promising candidates for further investigation. Together, our experi—
mental findings establish iONMF as the data integration technique
of choice where sparse, modular models are desired.

ECCB 2012: The 11"h European Conference on

Computational Biology

 

This special issue comprises the proceedings papers accepted for
presentation at the 11th European Conference on Computational
Biology (ECCB 2012), which was held from 9 to 12 September 2012
at the Conference Center Basel, Switzerland. This year’s conference
was organized by the SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics and also
served as the 10th [BC]2 Basel Computational Biology Conference,
the annual meeting of the Swiss computational biology community.
It was preceded by two satellite meetings, six workshops and
ﬁve tutorials. Details of the conference are available through
the conference website (http://www.eccb12.org) and will later be
archived at eccb.iscb.org/2012/.

ECCB is the top European conference in computational biology
and bioinformatics, and together with ISMB and RECOMB one of
the major international conference series in computational biology.
The conference brings together scientists working in a broad range of
disciplines, including bioinformatics, computational and molecular
biology, medicine and systems biology. It covers computational
methods for analysis of the tremendously growing amount of data
in the life sciences, and approaches for modeling and simulation of
increasingly complex systems in molecular biology, medicine and
pharmaceutical research. The scope of the conference evolves each
year to address the latest developments in biological applications of
mathematical modeling and computational methods.

ECCB is held in a different country or region each year, and
incorporates the annual national or regional meeting where it is held.
Every other year, it is held jointly with the Intelligent Systems in
Molecular Biology (ISMB). Past editions of ECCB have been held in
Vienna (AT) (with ISMB), Ghent (BE), Stockholm (SE) (joint with
ISMB), Cagliari (IT), Vienna (AT) (with ISMB), Eilat (IL), Madrid
(ES), Glasgow (UK) (with ISMB), Paris (FR) and Saarbriicken (DE).

The ECCB 2012 conference featured keynote lectures by
distinguished speakers: The opening keynote lecture was delivered
by Nobel price laureate Aaron Ciechanover (Technion — Israel
Institute of Technology), followed by Barry Honig (Columbia
University, New York), Laurent Keller (University of Lausanne),
Gene Myers (MP1 of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics,
Dresden), Mihaela Zavolan (Biozentrum University of Basel &
SIB) and the EMBO keynote lecture by S¢ren Brunak (Technical
University of Denmark).

The conference topics span all areas of methodological
developments for computational biology and innovative applications
of computational methods to molecular biology. This year,
the conference was organized in 11 topic areas: ‘Applied
and Translational Bioinformatics’, ‘Bioimaging, Spatial-temporal
Modeling and Data Visualization’, ‘Bioinformatics of Health and
Disease, Biomarkers and Personalized Medicine’, ‘Databases,
Ontologies, and Text Mining’, ‘Evolution, Phylogeny, and
Comparative Genomics’, ‘Macromolecular Structure, Dynamics
and Function’, ‘Mutations, Variations, and Population Genomics’,
‘Protein Interactions, Molecular Networks, and Proteomics’,
‘Regulation, Pathways, and Systems Biology’, ‘Sequencing and
Sequence Analysis’ and ‘Technology and Software (TechTrack)’.

Following the call for proceedings papers, we received a record
number of 340 submissions—which corresponds to a ~60% increase
compared to the previous ECCB in 2010. The manuscripts were
assessed by a program committee of 350 reviewers and 191 co-
reviewers. The reviewing process in each topic area was coordinated
by two area chairs (see next article), and the different areas
were coordinated by the Conference Chairs. Within each area,
the area chairs assigned the papers to expert referees; in general
each paper was reviewed by three PC members, with a few
cases where we could only secure two referee reports. The whole
process was carried out through the EasyChair conference reviewing
system (http://www.easychair.org). The same system was used
for discussing papers in cases where the reviewers had different
opinions about the relevance or quality of the contribution. After a
consensus had been reached by the reviewers, a ﬁnal selection was
carried out by the area chairs and the conference chairs, discussing
the outcome in the form of a phone conference. In total, 48 papers
were conditionally accepted, pending revision. After acceptance
notices were sent, the authors had 2 weeks to modify their papers
according to the suggestions made by the reviewers and to respond to
the reviewers’ comments. Modiﬁed papers and authors’ responses
were reexamined during the next week to ensure each paper was
modiﬁed appropriately in response to the reviewers’ comments. We
were pleased that all conditionally accepted papers were ﬁnally
accepted. These 48 (14% accepted rate) contributions are included in
this special issue. Collectively, the authors of the 48 accepted papers
come from 19 countries across 4 continents, with 60 authors from
North America, 95 from Europe, 27 from Asia (excluding Israel), 4
from Israel and 3 authors from Saudi Arabia. The conference papers
are available in open access in electronic format, both through online
open access to the journal Bioinformatics and on the electronic
documentation distributed to the conference participants on USB
memory cards.

The call for poster abstract submission was kept open 2 weeks
after the selection of the oral presentations, so that authors whose
manuscript could not be accepted had the opportunity to resubmit
their work as poster. A call for late poster abstracts was launched
to allow groups to present their latest research results during the
meeting. At the time of writing, more than 500 posters were accepted
after evaluation of the abstracts for scientiﬁc relevance to the
meeting. The call for late abstract has not been completed at the
time of writing. Accepted poster abstracts are included as part of the
electronic documentation distributed to the conference participants,
and are available through the conference website.

In addition to the keynotes and proceedings presentations, eight
highlight presentations were selected by the ECCB steering board
and program committee members from 100 submissions, consisting
of full papers that have been published, or accepted for publication,
between 1 January 2011 and the submission deadline, 1 July 2012.
Additionally, a technology and software track included presentations
of commercial and academic software, databases and biological
applications by sponsors, exhibitors and academic institutions.

Sixteen exhibitor stands were open throughout the conference in
the main conference halls, presenting the latest scientiﬁc literature
in the ﬁeld of computational biology, bioinformatics, modeling
and simulation, as well as new hardware, software and technology
developments. ECCB 2012 also hosted the ﬁrst technical meeting
of ELIXIR chaired by S¢ren Brunak (chair of the ELIXIR Interim
Board).

During the weekend preceding the conference, two satellite
meetings, six workshops and ﬁve tutorials were organized: on
Saturday, 8 September, a special symposium celebrated the 10th
anniversary of the UniProt project: in 2002, 40 years after the ﬁrst
comprehensive collection of protein sequences, the ‘Atlas of Protein
Sequence and Structure’, was published, the SWISS-PROT and
TrEMBL protein sequence databases at the European Bioinformatics
Institute (EBI) and the SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, and the
Protein Information Resource (PIR) in Washington, joined forces to
create UniProt. At this symposium, renowned speakers gave insight
into their work, highlighting how protein databases are underpinning
life sciences.

The Student Council of the International Society for
Computational Biology organized its second European Student
Council Symposium (ESCS), chaired by Pedro Lopes (University
of Aveiro, Portugal) and Florian Heer (SIB & Biozentrum
University of Basel, Switzerland). The meeting gave students the
opportunity to present their work to an international audience and
to build a network and exchange ideas and knowledge within the
computational biology community.

On Saturday and Sunday, 8 and 9 September, the Sixth
International Workshop on Machine Learning in Systems Biology
(MLSB) was organized as a 2-day workshop by Karsten Borgwardt
(Max Planck Institutes & Eberhard Karls Universitat Tubingen)
and Gunnar Ratsch (Sloan-Kettering Institute, New York). MLSB
provides a scientiﬁc forum for the exchange between researchers
from Systems Biology and Machine Learning.

All other workshops and tutorials were organized as 1-day
events on Sunday 9 September: the workshop ‘Annotation,
Interpretation and Management of Mutations (AIMM)’ focused
on extraction and reuse of genotype—phenotype knowledge from
scientiﬁc literature and databases. It was chaired by Christopher
Baker (University of New Brunswick, Saint John, Canada) and
Dietrich Rebholz—Schuhmann (European Bioinformatics Institute,
Cambridge, UK). The workshop ‘Computational Proteomics: From
Mass Spectrometry to Protein Complexes’ organized by Markus
Muller (SIB, Geneva), Alexander Schmidt (Biozentrum, University
of Basel) and Jacques Colinge (CeMM, Vienna) addressed
computational aspects of Mass spectrometry analysis.

The workshop ‘Bioinformatics Training for Life Scientists:
Showcases and Challenges from Tutors’ Perspectives’ organized
by Patricia Palagi (SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics), Vicky
Schneider (European Bioinformatics Institute, EBI), Allegra Via
(Dept of Physics, Sapienza University of Rome), Celia van Gelder
(Netherlands Bioinformatics Centre, NBIC) focused on training
in bioinformatics for life scientists from the perspective of the
trainer. It aimed to provide a platform for those involved in
bioinformatics training to meet, confront and share experiences, as
well as discuss future directions and collaboration in joint efforts.
The workshop ‘Imaging Analysis and Computational Modeling for
Cancer and its Therapy’ organized by Petros Koumoutsakos and
Gabor Szekely (ETHZ) presented the state of the art in imaging,

analysis and modeling of cancer and its therapy. Special focus
was laid on recent developments in optical microscopy, small
animal and clinical imaging, data analysis tools, mathematical
models and computations of cancer formation and progression.
The workshop ‘Detecting Transcription Factor Binding Sites with
ChIP—Seq Data and Predicting Damaging Cis-Regulatory Variations’
addressed genome re-sequencing data analysis for the prediction
of variations within cis-regulatory sequences. The program was
organized by Wyeth W. Wasserman (University of British Columbia,
Canada), Virginie Bernard (Curie Institute, Canada), Jonathan Lim
and Anthony Mathelier (University of British Columbia, Canada).

The purpose of the tutorial program at ECCB is to provide
participants with lectures and hands-on training covering topics
relevant to the bioinformatics ﬁeld. It offers participants an
opportunity to learn about new areas of bioinformatics research,
to get an introduction to important established topics, or to
develop advanced skills in areas they are already familiar
with. At ECCB 2012, tutorials on six different topics were
organized: ‘Applications of Bio-Ontologies in Large-Scale Data-
Driven Science: A Practical Introduction’ by Barry Smith
(University at Buffalo, USA), and Janna Hastings (European
Bioinformatics Institute and University of Geneva); ‘Protein
Evolution: From Sequence to Structure to Function’ by Christine
Orengo and Romain Studer (UCL, London, UK) and Nicholas
Furnham (EMBL—EBI, Cambridge, UK); ‘GWAS: Statistics and
Bioinformatics to Analyse Genotype to Phenotype Relationships
from Molecular Traits to Disease Phenotypes’ by Christoph Lippert
(Microsoft Research, Los Angeles, USA) and Oliver Stegle (Max
Planck Institute for Developmental Biology, Tubingen, Germany);
‘Inferring Genetic Diversity from Next-generation Sequencing
Data: Computational Methods and Biomedical Applications’ by
Niko Beerenwinkel (ETH Zurich and SIB), Karin J. Metzner
(University Hospital Zurich) and Volker Roth (University of
Basel, Switzerland); and ‘Reads to Biological Patterns: End-to-End
Differential Expression Analysis of RNA Sequencing Data Using
Bioconductor’ by Simon Anders and Wolfgang Huber (EMBL),
Michal Okoniewski (ETHZ) and Mark Robinson (University of
Zurich & SIB).

Encouraging the participation of young scientists has always been
a central goal of the ECCB conference because the conference
is a great opportunity for education and networking for early
stage scientists. Thanks to contributions from several academic
sponsors, our host organizations, previous editions of ECCB
and our commercial sponsors, we could provide 114 conference
fellowships to PhD and postdoc applicants from all over the world.
Presenters and contributors to oral presentations were given priority.
Unfortunately, several applicants had to be turned down due to
limitations of available resources.

Organizing ECCB would not be possible without the generous
support by partner organizations, funding agencies and sponsors.
We are especially grateful to the Swiss Foundation for Excellence
and Talent in Biomedical Research, SIB Swiss Institute of
Bioinformatics, ISCB International Society for Computational
Biology, the University of Basel, the Swiss Academy of Medical
Sciences and the [BC]2 Basel Computational Biology Conference
for funding 114 fellowships to facilitate the participation of young
talented scientists early in their career. We highly appreciate
the support by our host institutions, the SIB Swiss Institute of
Bioinformatics, the Biozentrum University of Basel, and the Swiss

Systems Biology Initiative SystemsX.ch. We are especially grateful
to our platinum sponsors Basel Area and IBM. We would like to
thank all our partner and sponsors: the Netherlands Bioinformatics
Centre NBIC, CONVEY Computers, F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd,
HP, BBRC, Interpharma, FMI Friedrich Miescher Institute, Bioalps,
Competence Center Computational Sciences University Basel,
Novartis Pharma, Syngenta, BASF, Merck Serono and the canton of
the city of Basel. We would like to thank EMBO for supporting the
EMBO keynote lecture by Soren Brunak.

It is our pleasure to thank all the people and organizations that
made ECCB 2012 possible. Our ﬁrst thanks go to the program
committee of reviewers and co-reviewers, and in particular the area
chairs. A swift and effective review process is at the heart of a
conference like ECCB. Reviewing 340 proceedings manuscripts
and 100 highlight paper submissions in just a few weeks is
truly challenging, especially since many members of the program
committee had been involved in reviewing for ISMB shortly before.
The dedication and hard work of the program committee was quite
simply the key to the high quality of the conference.

We are grateful to the ECCB steering committee for their support
to the organization of the conference: in particular, the advice
and guidance from previous organizers Anna Tramontano, Yves

Moreau and Michal Linial was crucial. Anna, thank you so much
for answering our questions at any time of day (and night)!

Logistics is crucial for a successful conference. We are grateful
to the Oxford University Press production team for the preparation
of this special issue, to Congress Center Basel for the venue
organization. The local administration team at the Biozentrum of
the University of Basel did an incredible job, and we owe them
a great debt: Katja Jenni, Rita Manohar, Sarah Guthe, Lorenza
Bordoli and Yvonne Steger for preparing the meeting and organizing
the registration, Markus Stocin from Billboard for the poster
and website design, Andrew Waterhouse for the registration and
poster submission system, Jan Welker and Konstantin Arnold for IT
support, J ocelyne Boquet for handling the ﬁnancial administration.

Finally, the most important ingredient to the success of a
conference are the scientiﬁc contributions and discussions: we
are grateful to the authors of all submitted manuscripts, keynote
speakers, presenters of selected papers, tutorial lecturers, workshop
organizers and contributors, poster authors and to all the participants.
Thank you for making this conference a success.

Abstract

Summary: We previously developed deWAS to search for dense modules in a human protein—
protein interaction (PPI) network; it has since become a popular tool for network-assisted analysis
of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). deWAS weights nodes by using GWAS signals.
Here, we introduce an upgraded algorithm, EW_deWAS, to boost GWAS signals in a node- and
edge-weighted PPI network. In EW_deWAS, we utilize condition-specific gene expression pro-
files for edge weights. Specifically, differential gene co-expression is used to infer the edge
weights. We applied EW_deWAS to two diseases and compared it with other relevant methods.
The results suggest that EW_deWAS is more powerful in detecting disease-associated signals.

Availability and implementation: The algorithm of EW_deWAS is implemented in the R package

 

deWAS_3.0 and is available at http://bioinfo.mc.vanderbiIt.edu/deWAS.

1 Introduction

Over the past decade, genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
have successfully uncovered many susceptibility loci for common
diseases. However, the identified loci only explain a small portion of
the genetic risk (Jia et al., 2011). It is challenging to uncover the re-
maining risky loci as their association signals are likely to be moder-
ate or weak. One potential solution to this challenge is to
incorporate other functional information, such as protein—protein
interaction (PPI) networks, to investigate joint association signals
beyond single markers (Jia et al., 2012).

We previously developed a network-assisted approach,
deWAS, to address this problem (Jia et al., 2011). deWAS
applies a greedy algorithm to search for dense modules in a PPI net-
work in which nodes are weighted by using GWAS signals. After its
initial release, deWAS received much attention from the research
community and has become quite popular for network-assisted ana-
lysis of GWAS signals.

Motivated by the strong demand, we enhanced deWAS by
integrating and enabling gene expression profiles to assign edge
weights, and denoted the new algorithm EW_deWAS.
Differential gene co-expression (DGCE), which measures the change
of gene co-expression between case and control samples, is one im-
portant feature of transcriptional information, reflecting cellular dy-
namics and contributing to pathogenesis (Yu et al., 2013). Thus, we
utilize DGCE to infer the weight of each edge and combine the asso-
ciation signals of its two nodes to assess the overall disease risk of
network modules within the human PPI network.

2 Methods

In brief, EW_deWAS integrates GWAS signals and gene expres-
sion profiles to extract dense modules from a background PPI net-
work. Node weights are derived from GWAS signals and edge
weights are derived from gene expression profiles. The module score

is a combination of node weight and edge weight. The aim of
EW_deWAS is to locally identify the modules with maximum
scores.

2.1 Defining node weight

To determine disease association at the gene level, we first mapped
the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) P-values from GWAS
onto gene-based P-values. Then, we defined node weight by
nodeweight (v) = (p_1(1 — p), where p denotes the gene-based P-
value of node v, and (p is the standard normal distribution function.

2.2 Defining edge weight

We used the change of gene co-expression between case and control
samples to infer edge weight. Specifically, let rcase and rcontrol repre-
sent the Pearson’s correlation coefficient (PCC) of gene expression
in case and control samples, respectively, and let new, and ncomol
represent the sample size, respectively. We first used the Fisher
transformation [Equation (1)] and then Fisher’s test of difference be-
tween two conditions [Equation (2)] to define a new statistic X:

F(x)=%ln1+x

 

, (1)

1—x

X = F(rcase) _ F(rcontrol) . (
1 1

"case _ 3 "control _ 3

 

 

The newly defined statistic X approximately follows the stand-
ard normal distribution (Hou et al., 2014). Accordingly, we defined
edge weight as edge weight(e) = (p_1 [1 — 2*(1 — 

2.3 Defining module score
To quantitatively evaluate the density of highly weighted nodes and
edges within a module, we defined the module score S by

 

S [I 2 6E edgeweight(e) (1 [I  6V nodeweight(v)
: e— + _ ll ’
No. of E VNo. of V

where E and V represent the edges and nodes of the module, and 2
is a parameter between 0 and 1 to balance GWAS and gene expres-
sion signals.

2.4 Module search
We implemented a greedy algorithm to search for dense modules as
follows.

1. Assign a seed module M and calculate the module score Sm of
M. Initially, the seed module is a single gene.

2. Examine all the ﬁrst order neighbors of M, and identify the
neighbor node NmX that generates the maximum increment of
the module score.

3. Add NmX to the current module M if the score increment is
greater than Sm X r, where r is a parameter that decides the mag-
nitude of increment.

4. Repeat steps 1—3 until no more neighbors can be added.

2.5 Normalization of module score

In order to evaluate the significance of the identified modules, we
used a randomization-based method to obtain the background dis-
tribution of the module scores. Specifically, for a module M with K
nodes, we randomly generated a sub-network with the same size,
and calculated the score Sm( TC ) of this sub-network. We repeated
this process 10 000 times and denoted the mean and standard

deviation of Sm( TC ) as u and a. The module score was normalized
by SN 2 (Sm — u) /o, and SN was used to determine the significance
of the identified modules.

3 Implementation and application

The algorithm of EW_deWAS is implemented in the R package
deWAS_3.0 and is available at http://bioinfo.mc.vanderbilt.edu/
deWAS. It takes three types of data as input: a list of genes with
association P-values, gene expression profiles in both case and con-
trol samples, and a human PPI network. For mapping SNP P-values
from GWAS onto gene based P-values, multiple tools are available
(Ballard et al., 2010). In our implementation, we utilized versatile
gene-based association study (VEGAS) (Liu et al., 2010) for this pur-
pose. r and 2 are two parameters that need to be determined in
EW_deWAS. r is suggested to be 0.1, as was used in our previous
version (Jia et al., 2011). For 2, we proposed the following ap-
proach. We randomly extracted 10 000 sub-networks from the
background network and then obtained the magnitude ratios (mr)
by comparing the edge weight part and the node weight part of the
sub-networks:

 

ZeeE edgeweight(e) Z:er nodeweight(v) I
VNo. of E VNo. of V i

2 was estimated by 1/(1 + median(mr)) (Ma et al., 2011).
Alternatively, in our R package, we leave the options open for users

mr=|

to provide other values of r and 2 according to their expertise. The
output of EW_deWAS is a list of identified modules, ordered by
the normalized module score SN.

We demonstrated EW_deWAS in breast cancer (BC) and
schizophrenia (SCZ), respectively. As a comparison, we applied
three other methods, including the previous version of deWAS,
the guilt-by-rewiring (GBR) method (Hou et al., 2014) and
MetaRanker 2.0 (Pers et al., 2013), to the same datasets. GBR and
MetaRanker 2.0 are similar to EW_GWAS in that they both incorp-
orate GWAS signals and gene expression profiles to identify candi-
date disease genes (Supplementary Note). The BC GWAS data were
obtained from the National Cancer Institute Cancer Genetics
Markers of Susceptibility project (CGEMS) (Hunter et al., 2007),
and gene expression data were downloaded from The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA, http://cancergenome.nih.gov/). The SCZ
GWAS data were obtained from the Genetic Association
Information Network (GAIN) (Jia et al., 2012), and gene expression
data were downloaded from the public Gene Expression Omnibus
(GEO) database (GSE21138). The PPI network was obtained from
the Protein Interaction Network Analysis (PINA) platform (Wu
et al., 2009). Details of the data and analyses are provided in the
Supplementary Note.

Both EW_deWAS and deWAS reported a list of dense mod-
ules as output. As suggested in our previous study (Jia et al., 2011),
we chose the candidate genes residing in the top 1% of modules for
evaluation. For the BC dataset, EW_deWAS and deWAS re-
ported 128 and 100 candidate genes, respectively. The output of
both GBR and MetaRanker 2.0 is a list of prioritized genes. We
therefore chose the top 128 genes prioritized by the two methods for
comparison. We collected 517 genes (as of August, 2014) from the
Cancer Gene Census category (CGC, http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/can
cergenome/projects/censusl) as a benchmark to evaluate the candi-
date genes reported by the different methods. Among the candidate
genes identified by each method, EW_deWAS, deWAS, GBR
and MetaRanker 2.0 identified 14, 1, 4 and 3 CGC genes,

respectively (Supplementary Table S2), suggesting EW_deWAS is
more powerful in identifying disease-related genes (all P-values <
0.05, binomial test). We further performed the pathway enrichment
analysis of candidate genes (Table 1) using WebGestalt (Zhang
et al., 2005). Among the significant pathways (adjusted P-value <
0.01), candidate genes reported by EW_deWAS were found to be
enriched in the most cancer related pathways, including ‘pathways
in cancer’, ‘ErbB signaling pathway’ and ‘Jak-STAT signaling path-
way’. Candidate genes reported by deWAS are only enriched in
one significant pathway (‘metabolic pathway’), which is not directly
related to BC. ‘Pathways in cancer’ is also enriched in the candidate
genes identified by GBR and MetaRanker 2.0. However, the candi-
date genes within ‘pathways in cancer’ are fewer compared with
those identified by EW_deWAS.

For the SCZ dataset, EW_deWAS, deWAS, GBR and
MetaRanker 2.0 reported 65, 105, 65 and 65 candidate genes, re-
spectively. We utilized the 38 manually curated SCZ core genes as a
benchmark to evaluate the results. These 38 genes have been com-
monly considered as candidate genes in expert reviews or have
shown significant results in meta-analysis studies (Jia et al., 2010).
Although the candidate genes reported by deWAS, GBR and
MetaRanker 2.0 do not overlap with the 38 SCZ core genes,
EW_deWAS reported 2 SCZ core genes (Supplementary Table
S3, all P-values < 0.05 , binomial test). Table 2 summarizes the en-
riched pathways in the SCZ dataset. Interestingly, two SCZ related
pathways are enriched in the candidate genes identified by
EW_deWAS, including ‘Endocytosis’ and ‘Neuroactive ligand-re-
ceptor interaction’. Recent studies have shown that ‘Neuroactive lig-
and-receptor interaction’ plays an important role in the
antipsychotic treatment response (Adkins et al., 2012), while

Abstract

Motivation: Recently, new RNA secondary structure probing techniques have been developed, includ-
ing Next Generation Sequencing based methods capable of probing transcriptome-wide. These tech-
niques hold great promise for improving structure prediction accuracy. However, each new data type
comes with its own signal properties and biases, which may even be experiment specific. There is
therefore a growing need for RNA structure prediction methods that can be automatically trained on
new data types and readily extended to integrate and fully exploit multiple types of data.

Results: Here, we develop and explore a modular probabilistic approach for integrating probing
data in RNA structure prediction. It can be automatically trained given a set of known structures
with probing data. The approach is demonstrated on SHAPE datasets, where we evaluate and se-
lectively model specific correlations. The approach often makes superior use of the probing data
signal compared to other methods. We illustrate the use of ProbFold on multiple data types using
both simulations and a small set of structures with both SHAPE, DMS and CMCT data. Technically,
the approach combines stochastic context-free grammars (SCFGs) with probabilistic graphical
models. This approach allows rapid adaptation and integration of new probing data types.
Availability and Implementation: ProbFold is implemented in C++. Models are specified using
simple textual formats. Data reformatting is done using separate C++ programs. Source code,
statically compiled binaries for x86 Linux machines, C ++ programs, example datasets and a tutor-
ial is available from http://moma.ki.au.dk/prj/probfoldl.

1 Introduction

Obtaining accurate secondary structure predictions is a crucial step
toward understanding the physical properties of RNA molecules
and the biological roles of structural RNA elements. However, com-
putational predictions based only on the primary sequence are often
inaccurate and therefore insufficient for in-depth interpretation.
Similarly, structure probing data typically only provides partial
structural information (Wan et al., 2011; Weeks, 2010). Directly
modeling both types of data in the folding process generally

improves structure prediction accuracy (Cordero et al., 2012a;
Deigan et al., 2009; Mathews et al., 2004; Siikosd et al., 2012;
Swenson et al., 2012; Washietl et al., 2012; Zarringhalam et al.,
2012). While most studies have used methods based on energy-
minimization, the inclusion of probing data in probabilistic folding
models has not been fully explored (Siikosd et al., 2012).

Here, we develop and explore a modular probabilistic approach
for integrating probing data in RNA secondary structure prediction,
which we call ProbFold. The focus is on how to best exploit the

structure signal of the probing data, while keeping the models general
and easy to adapt to new probing data types or additional layers of
probing data. We have not aimed to develop a competitive single-se-
quence structure prediction method. The main focus is therefore on
the use of the probing data signal rather than the overall performance.

Probabilistic modeling offers a coherent framework for combining
different types of evidence as they are all naturally measured on the
same scale. Structure models based on energy minimization do not
extend naturally to additional types of data in the same way. For in-
stance, probing data measurements must be translated to pseudo-
energy perturbations before they can be included in the models,
though they do not have inherent thermodynamic interpretations.

Probabilistic approaches have previously been used to incorpor-
ate comparative evidence in structure folding (Eddy and Durbin,
1994; Knudsen and Hein, 1999, 2003; Nawrocki and Eddy, 2013;
Pedersen et al., 2004, 2006; Rivas and Eddy, 2001; Sakakibara
et al., 1994). This is another example of supplementing the primary
sequence with partial structure evidence and as such closely related
to the probing data modeling problem studied here. Several of these
methods exploit that generative probabilistic methods can be com-
bined and their parameters optimized in a unified approach. For in-
stance, pfold combines previously established models of molecular
evolution (phylogenetic models) with probabilistic models of RNA
secondary structure (stochastic context-free grammars — SCFGs).

We aimed to develop a method, called ProbFold, that could be
readily extended to disparate data types and could encompass differ-
ent probabilistic models for these. In particular they should be able to
capture correlations both within and between data types. This is
achieved by combining SCFGs with probabilistic graphical models
(PGMs). The SCFG defines a prior over secondary structures, as it
does in most other probabilistic methods (Rivas et al., 2012). The
PGMs model the sequence and any layers of probing data given the
structure. PGMs are ﬂexible and modular models useful for capturing
select dependencies in high dimensional data (Koller and Fridman,
2009). In our case, they model dependencies between the sequence
and the probing data as well as dependencies along the sequence.

Standard algorithms allow efficient training of both SCFG and
PGMs as well as prediction of the optimal secondary structure.
Importantly, this allows ProbFold to be automatically trained with-
out hand-setting any parameters given a sufficiently sized training
set of known structures with probing data. The size of the needed
training set depends on the number of free parameters in the model.

RNA structure probing has a long history and many different
methods exist (Ehresmann et al., 1987), including use of chemical
agents (Merino et al., 2005; Karaduman et al., 2006; Tijerina et al.,
2007), RNases (Kertesz et al., 2010a,b) and spontaneous cleavage
(Regulski and Breaker, 2008). Generally these modify bases or the
backbone preferentially at either single or paired positions, allowing
positional information on base-pair status through gel electrophor-
esis or sequencing. In the case of the SHAPE reagent (selective 2’-hy-
droxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension), it is the ﬂexibility of
the backbone that determines reactivity, which is generally higher
for unpaired than paired regions (McGinnis et al., 2012; Merino
et al., 2005; Weeks, 2010).

The interpretation of structure probing data is challenged by in-
complete specificity of the methods, noisy or missing data, nucleo-
tide biases, etc., which results in incomplete labeling of the primary
sequence into paired and unpaired positions. For instance, in the
case of SHAPE, the distributions of reactivities for paired and un-
paired bases are largely overlapping (see Section 3). There is there-
fore a great need for computational methods that can integrate and

make optimal use of probing data, beyond interpreting the data as a
definite labeling of the primary sequence.

Recently, progress have has been made on this problem with both
physics-based methods (Deigan et al., 2009; Mathews et al., 2004;
Merino et al., 2005; Swenson et al., 2012; Washietl et al., 2012;
Zarringhalam et al., 2012), sampling based methods (Ouyang et al.,
2013; Quarrier et al., 2010) and a probabilistic method (Sukosd et al.,
2012). These are brieﬂy presented below. See Eddy (2014) for a de-
tailed review and discussion of their statistical foundations.

In RNAstructure (Deigan et al., 2009; Mathews et al., 2004),
SHAPE reactivities are converted to base-stacking pseudo-energy
change terms using a linear model optimized by prediction perform-
ance on a known structure (23S rRNA from Escherichia coli
(E.coli)). Zarringhalam et al. (2012) extends this approach in the
RNAsc method, by also including pseudo-energy change terms for
unpaired positions. GTfold provides a fast parallelized multi-core
implementation of the energy minimization algorithm and similarly
includes SHAPE data (Swenson et al., 2012). In an extension of
RNAfold, pseudo-energy change terms are optimized for each struc-
ture given a loss function to maximize the agreement between the
energy-based prediction and the experimental observations. In par-
ticular, no change is made when the sequence prediction is in com-
plete agreement with the SHAPE data (Washietl et al., 2012).
Recently, the ViennaRNA Package has been extended to include sev-
eral forms of soft constraints and specifically include implementa-
tions of the Deigan et al. (2009), Zarringhalam et al. (2012) and
Washietl et al. (2012) approaches (Lorenz et al. 2015). A thorough
performance comparison of the three approaches is also provided
(Lorenz et al. 2015).

Another class of approaches samples structures from the
Boltzmann-weighted ensemble and selects a representative structure
with minimal Manhattan distance to a probing data profile
(Quarrier et al., 2010). This has been extended to several layers of
probing data by a method that reduces them to a single binary pair-
ing status profile (Ouyang et al., 2013).

The recently proposed probabilistic method, PPfold 3.0 (Sukosd
et al., 2012), extends pfold (Knudsen and Hein, 1999) by modeling
both comparative sequence alignment data and experimental prob-
ing data. It uses stochastic context-free grammars (SCFGs) to model
secondary structures, phylogenetic models to model alignment col-
umns and fine-grained discrete probability distributions to model
SHAPE probing data. The study provides a proof of concept for
including probing data in probabilistic methods.

Compared to PPfold 3.0, ProbFold offers a more general, extend-
ible and parameter-sparse modeling approach that is evaluated using
cross-validation. We develop ProbFold using existing SHAPE data
(Deigan et al., 2009) combined with an extensive set of known RNA
structures (Rivas et al., 2012) and evaluate a hierarchy of increas-
ingly parameter-rich models. We find that including both base-pair
stacking interactions and neighbor correlations for the SHAPE data
improve performance. We also show how multiple types of probing
data can be included in the models and may improve prediction per-
formance. We find that the ProbFold approach exploits the probing
data well, generally yielding higher performance gains than other
methods, and present automatic procedures for optimizing the mod-
els on new data types.

2 Materials and methods
2.1 SCFGs

SCFGs are the probabilistic variants of Context-Free-Grammars
(CFGs). A CFG defines a formal language used for the generation of

Probabilistic method for RNA structural data integration

 

strings and is particularly suitable for RNA modeling, as it has the
ability to capture nested long-range correlations (Dowel and Eddy,
2004). This approach has been widely applied in the context of
RNA modeling and structure analysis (Durbin et al., 1998; Eddy
and Durbin, 1994; Knudsen and Hein, 1999; Pedersen et al., 2004,
2006; Rivas et al., 2012; Sakakibara et al., 1994). An introduction
to the use of SCFGs for RNA structure modelling and how they can
be extended to handle the multivariate data of our setting is given in
the supplementary material and methods section (Section S1 .1).

For the current study, we use (and extend) the pfold grammar
(Knudsen and Hein, 1999), which models RNA secondary structures
in terms of individual base pairs and unpaired nucleotides through
the set of grammar rules: S —> LS|L; F —> bF5|LS; L —> a|cF€, where
S, L and F are the nonterminals, a, b and c refer to the terminal sym-
bols. However, the grammar does not explicitly model stacking
interactions between consecutive base pairs, as done in nearest-
neighbor energy models (Mathews et al., 1999, 2004; Xia et al.,
1998). Apart from hydrogen bonding between paired nucleotides
(base pairing), stacking interactions between adjacent base pairs are
the largest contributors to helix stability in nucleic acids
(Yakovchuk et al., 2006). We model these interactions for consecu-
tive base-pairs by replacing a pair-emitting rule with a stack-emit-
ting rule in the PFold grammar (L —> cFE), which takes the previous
base-pair into account.

The resulting grammar has six production rules, three of
which emit terminals (Fig. 1). The probability of the terminals
given the transition between nonterminals is specified by emis-
sion models. When modeling only the RNA sequence, the terminals
consist of nucleotides and the emission distributions can be
defined simply by multinomials (Durbin et al., 1998; Pedersen et al.,
2004). To also model probing data, the emission models instead spe-
cify a joint distribution over both RNA sequence data and probing
data. To achieve the flexibility needed for specifying joint distribu-
tions over multiple, potentially heterogeneous data types, we use a
probabilistic graphical model framework to define the emission
models.

involving the four non-terminals S, L, F and e. 6 denotes the empty sequence,
which cannot be derived further. Three of the rules emit terminals, named
single, pair and stack and three are non-emitting, including two bifurcation
rules. Each bifurcation rule splits into two parts, consisting of a left (I) non-ter-
minal and right (r) non-terminal. The derivation starts in S. S can use either a
bifurcation rule, which transits to L (l-part) as well as back to itself (r-part), or
a non-emitting rule, which transits to L. L can use either the single emitting
rule, which transits to e and emits unpaired terminals (3), or use the pair rule,
which transits to F and emits paired terminals (a3). Finally, F can use the stack
emitting rule, which transits back to F and emits (stacked) paired terminals
(b5) dependent on the previous base pair, or a bifurcation rule, which transits
to L (l-part) as well as to S (r-part)

2.2 Emission distributions and probabilistic graphical
models

Probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) offer a coherent and expres-
sive framework for specifying and analyzing joint probability distri-
butions (Koller and Fridman, 2009). PGMs are generally used to
capture independence assumptions among a set of random variables
and to specify their joint distribution as a factorization of local dis-
tributions each defined over subsets of variables. PGMs can be rep-
resented by mathematical graphs with nodes denoting random
variables and edges denoting potential dependencies. A rich set of al-
gorithms exist for doing inference with PGMs, which have proven a
powerful tool for simplifying complex problems (Koller and
Fridman, 2009).

We define the emission models as PGMs using the factor graph
formalism (Fig. 2) (Bishop, 2006). In this formalism, the PGMs are
specified as undirected bipartite graphs between random variable
nodes (represented by circles) and factor nodes (represented by
squares). The factors hold potentially unnormalized probability dis-
tributions involving neighboring random variables.

Our current factor graph implementation of PGMs only handles
discrete random variables, which simplifies the implementation and
speeds up likelihood calculations. Including continuous random
variables generally requires potentially slow numeric integration.
Probing data are therefore discretized in a preprocessing step (see
below).

For a start, ProbFold was developed to take an RNA sequence
with a single affiliated sequence of probing data values as input. For
each sequence position we thus have observed both a nucleotide and
a discretized probing data value. We need to define an emission dis-
tribution for each of the single, pair and stack emitting rules (Fig. 1).
Single models only a single sequence position; pair models a pair of

sequence positions; and stack models four sequence positions, con-
sisting of two consecutive pairs (Fig. 2d).

For each of the three emission models, we specify a PGM defining
a joint distribution over the relevant nucleotides and probing data val-
ues (Fig. 2). Initially, the stack model disregards the probing data of
the previous base-pair. The PGM specification should reﬂect the inde-
pendence structure of the modeled variables. We let the probing data
at a position optionally depend on the observed nucleotides of that
position. However, we let the probing data from the two sides of a
base pair be independent of each other, given the observed nucleotides
of the base pair (Fig. 2). These independence assumptions are eval-
uated separately as part of the model development below.

2.3 Datasets

The ProbFold models are potentially parameter rich. Optimally we
would therefore train and test them on comprehensive sets of known
RNA structures encompassing tens of thousands of base-pairs affili-
ated with consistently generated probing data. As such datasets do
not yet exist, we complemented structure sets that include probing
data with larger sequence-only sets.

Our primary structure probing set consisted of SHAPE data
from E.coli 16S and 23S rRNAs (Deigan et al., 2009; Weeks, 2012)
augmented with a set of seven small RNA structures that were
downloaded from the RMDB repository (Cordero et al., 2012b)
(RMDB set) and four taken from Rice et al. (2014) (see Table 1).
Altogether, these include a total of 2142 unpaired positions and
1479 base pairs. The SHAPE data was preprocessed by denoting all
invalid values (reactivity < 0; n = 486) as missing data.

For a subset of the small structures from RMDB (n: 6), DMS
(dimethyl sulphate) and CMCT (1-cyclohexyl-(2-morpholinoethyl)
carbodiimide metho-p-toluene) probing datasets were also available
(Cordero et al., 2012b) (RMDB set, Supplementary Table 512).
These structures encompass 287 base pairs and 593 unpaired pos-
itions, for which 302 positions had missing data for DMS and 415
for CMCT. We used these to illustrate the use of ProbFold on mul-
tiple types of probing data.

In addition to the above datasets based on Sanger sequencing,
we also included a probing dataset based on Next-generation
sequencing (NGS). A set of eight small RNA structures with

(Supplementary Table S11) (Lucks et al. 2011). In combination,
these include a total of 280 base pairs and 490 unpaired positions.

The probing datasets were complemented with sets of sequence-
only structures called TrainSet A (3166 structures) and TestSet A
(112697), which were originally compiled by Rivas et al. (2012).
We preprocess these sets by discarding structures with loops with
less than three bases, reducing the size of TrainSet A to 2707 (130
227 base pairs) and TestSet A to 593 (25 596 base pairs). In the sup
plementary methods and material (Section 51.4), we describe train-
ing, testing and prediction procedures adopted in this work.

2.4 Probing data modeling and discretization

The value of probing data for secondary structure prediction depends
on the difference between its distribution in single stranded and paired
regions. In ProbFold, these probing data distributions (PSingle and
Ppair) are explicitly modeled as part of the PGMs and may be condi-
tioned on the primary sequence. Given our use of discrete PGMs, we
discretize the probing data into k bins and use normalized histogram
models (i.e. multinomials), which use k — 1 free parameters. Initially
we visualized these distributions for 165 and 23S SHAPE data using
15 equi-distant bins (Supplementary Fig. S1a). We discuss probing
data modelling and discretization including optimal criterion for break
points based on Kullback—Leibler (KL) divergence in the supplemen
tary methods and materials (Section 51.3).

2.5 Cross-validation and overfitting

Unlike some of the previous approaches (Sukosd et al., 2012;
Washietl et al., 2012), we use cross-validation in our performance
evaluation (Section 51.2). We thereby avoid to train and test on the
same probing data. For instance, when evaluating the performance
on 165, we train on 235 combined with RMDB and the sequence-
only TrainSet A. This further limits the number of probing data
related free parameters that can be learned without overfitting dur-
ing development.

The number of free parameters (fp) in the probing data models is
proportional to the number of bins used in the discretization. When
the number of free parameters is increased, the models typically
learn the properties of the training data well, but generalize poorly
to other datasets. To select the optimal number of bins and to illus-

SHAPE-Seq probing data was downloaded from RMDB trate this behavior, we plot the prediction performance on both train

and test sets when using probing data from 165 and 23S
(Supplementary Fig. 51d). The test performance is optimal between
3 and 15 bins, whereas train performance continues to increase and
approaches perfection due to overfitting. Based on this, we use six
bins for the discretization in the model evaluation below, which is
the only fixed metaparameter.

3 Results

3.1 Model selection

We developed and evaluated a hierarchy of models capturing differ-
ent correlations in the data with increasing number of free param-
eters (Supplementary Table S1). The limited amounts of training
data enforces a tradeoff as models with too many free parameters
will be overfitted and not be robust.

3.2 Sequence-only models

We started out with two sequence-only models: The pair model uses
the original PFold grammar (Knudsen and Hein, 1999) and is speci-
fied by 18 free parameters (fp). The stack model uses the above
described grammar extension, which also includes stacking inter-
actions (fp = 258). The stack model showed a modest performance
gain over the pair model in the ROC analysis and by F—measure
(Fig. 3a).

3.3 Probing data models

To extend the sequence-only models to also handle probing data, we
developed emission models that generate both sequence data and
SHAPE reactivities. To guide the development of these, we started
by analyzing correlations in the 16S and 23S SHAPE datasets.

We first evaluated if the SHAPE reactivities were correlated with
the primary sequence nucleotides. To control for compositional
biases and the different level of reactivities, we did this separately
for single (unpaired) and paired regions (Fig. 4a,b). In both cases,
there were significant differences in the distribution of the SHAPE
values for the different nucleotides (P <4.4e—03 for single and
P <8.6e—06 for pair; Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test).

We then evaluated if the SHAPE reactivities were correlated
between the left and the right side of a base-pair (Fig. 4c). Surpris-
ingly no correlation was observed (Pearson correlation coefficient,
pcc=-0.042; P-value = 0.075). This may be explained by the overall
low SHAPE reactivities of paired bases, causing experimental noise
to dominate any underlying signal.

Based on these observations, we defined emission models where
the SHAPE reactivities of the left and the right side of a base pair are
modeled independently, but with each their own distribution.

Altogether, the 25 free parameters are used to model the SHAPE
reactivities given discretization in six bins (single model: fp = 5; pair
models: fp = 2 X 5 = 10; stack models: fp = 2 X 5 = 10). Preferably,
ProbFold should capture differences in SHAPE reactivities among
nucleotides. However, capturing these dependencies requires many
additional free parameters (fp = 4 X 25 — 25 = 75). Given the limited
training data, we therefore model the primary sequence and the
SHAPE reactivities independently (e.g. the single model becomes
P(s, d) = P(s) >< P(d), as shown in Supplementary Fig. 52).

These emission models were combined with the grammar of the
sequence-only stack model selected above to give the stack+sh
(fp=283) model for SHAPE data. The inclusion of SHAPE data
dramatically improved sensitivity and overall performance (Fig. 3b,c
and Supplementary Table 52)

We finally evaluated if SHAPE reactivities correlate with neigh-
boring positions, again analyzing single and paired regions separ-
ately (Fig. 4d,e). Significant positive correlations were observed in
both cases (P < 0.0001), with an overall higher correlation in single
regions (pcc = 0.559) than in paired regions (pcc = 0.397). The cor-
relations may reflect overall steric constraints, which are likely to be
correlated along the primary sequence. For instance, backbone ﬂexi-
bility of loop positions may decrease toward stems.

We extended the emission models of the stack+sh model to cap-
ture these sequential correlations in the SHAPE data
(Supplementary Fig. 51), which requires many additional free par-
ameters (fp: 125). The resulting model, stack+sh+cor (fp=408),
improves performance over simpler models when trained on the 23S
dataset, but not when trained on the smaller 16S dataset. We attri-
bute the decrease in performance on 235 (842 base pairs) to overfit-
ting of the parameter rich correlation model when trained on the
16S dataset (468 base pairs). Overall, we recommend the
stack+sh+cor model for SHAPE prediction applications. We make
a version trained on the combined 16S and 23S datasets available
for download together with the other ProbFold models (http://
moma.ki.au.dk/prj/probfold/).

We also evaluated the performance of four existing methods,
PPfold 3.0 (Sukosd et al., 2012), RNAstructure v5 .6 (Mathews
et al., 2004), GTFold-3.0 (Swenson et al., 2012) and RNAfold
(Lorenz et al., 201 1, 2015), with the SHAPE conversion model from
Zarringhalam et al. (2012) (hereafter termed RNAfold.zar), on the
16S and 23S sequences with and without SHAPE data
(Supplementary Table 52).

For the sequence-only predictions, the ProbFold stack model re-
sults in a low sensitivity (<0.30) and a high PPV (~0.80). This pat-
tern is shared by ppfold, though it has somewhat poorer
performance, which may be explained by it not modeling stack
interactions. RNAstructure, GTFold and RNAfold, which all have
richer structure models, have more balanced sensitivity and PPV per-
formance. As a result they have higher F—values for 235 and, in some
cases, also for 165. ProbFold stack has the highest accuracy (ACC)
on both sequences.

When including SHAPE data, ProbFold continues to have low
sensitivity (47—62%) and high PPV (76—90%) compared to the other
methods. However, ProbFold’s tradeoff between sensitivity and PPV
can be adjusted (Fig. 3). RNAstructure has the highest overall per-
formance both by accuracy and F—value, closely followed by
RNAfold.zar and also GTFold in the case of the 165 sequence.
However, the 16S and 23S SHAPE datasets used in the development
of ProbFold, have also been heavily used for developing the SHAPE
models of the other methods. Specifically, PPfold was trained on
both 165 and 23S and the RNAstructure parameters were chosen
based on parameter-grid analysis of 235 with performance

evaluation on 165 (information not available for GTfold and
RNAfold.zar; Supplementary Table 52).

This could lead to overfitting and performance statistics that do
not generalize. In contrast, the performance results for ProbFold are
based on cross-evaluation, to avoid the effect of overfitting to the
train dataset (Supplementary Fig. 51d). The performance results are
therefore not directly comparable between methods.

As an independent test dataset, we evaluate the performance on
a set of small RNA structures with SHAPE data (Table 1 and
Supplementary Tables 53—510). On this set, ProbFold achieves the
highest F—value and accuracy on five of the eleven structures. It
ranks second after RNAfold.zar in terms of overall F—value and ac-
curacy across all structures (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 59).

Since our main focus is ProbFold’s ability to exploit the probing
data, we also evaluated the relative gain in performance when
including probing data over sequence-only predictions (Table 1 and
Supplementary Tables 56, S8 and S10). ProbFold showed the highest
gain for five of the eleven structures, with an average F—value gain of
0.29. The other methods showed smaller relative gains, with PPfold
at 0.11, GTFold at 0.05, RNAstructure at 0.02, and RNAfold.zar at
0.12.

We also evaluated ProbFold on an NGS-based SHAPE-Seq
dataset (Lucks et al., 2011), again using cross-evaluation
(Supplementary Table 511). The performance is comparable to that
of the capillary SHAPE data, if slightly better, with an overall accur-
acy of 0.76. Again, the gain from sequence-only performance is sub-
stantial (Aaccuracy of 0.29).

3.4 Robustness to noise

Experimental probing data will always include some amount of
noise. When ProbFold is trained, it in effect learns the correlation
between probing data levels and structure elements. If there is much

noise, it should learn that the correlation is weak and that the prob-
ing data holds little information.

To evaluate robustness to noise, we simulated noisy versions of
the 16S and 23S SHAPE datasets (Deigan et al., 2009; Weeks,
2012). Scaled random noise was drawn from a standard normal dis-
tribution and added to the observed SHAPE value at every position.
For each of a range of noise strengths, 30 datasets were generated
and the structure prediction performance evaluated for both
ProbFold as well as RNAfold.zar (with scoring by Zarringhalam
et al., 2012), RNAstructure and PPFold (Supplementary Fig. S3).
ProbFold was evaluated using cross-evaluation on each simulated
dataset and hence retrained on the structure not used for evaluation.

Overall, ProbFold shows greater robustness to an increase in
noise levels than the other methods. In particular, the fine-grained
SHAPE distributions of PPFold appear sensitive to noise, with a fast
decay in performance. At high noise levels, ProbFold performance
approaches the sequence-only level, as could be expected. This dem-
onstrates the potential advantage of retraining models and learning
the signal strength of individual datasets.

3.5 ProbFold with other data types

To illustrate the use of ProbFold on other types of probing data, we
retrained and applied the model on publicly available DM5 and
CMCT datasets covering six small RNA structures (see Section 2.3).
We used leave-one-out cross evaluation to train and evaluate the
performance of the stack+sh model from above. Given the limited
amount of training data, we use the KL approach to discretize the
probing data into three bins only, which reduces the number of free
parameters used to model probing data from 15 to 6. For both types
of data, the overall performance improved compared to using
only the primary sequence (Supplementary Tables S12, 513).
Overall, using DMS resulted in better prediction performance than
CMCT (F—values of 0.54 versus 0.48). The lower power of CMCT

Probabilistic method for RNA structural data integration

 

compared to DMS is also apparent from the smaller separation be-
tween the probing signal intensity distributions for paired and un-
paired positions (Supplementary Fig. 54).

As both DM5 and CMCT probing have known strong nucleotide
dependencies, we also evaluated a version of the stack+sh model
where the probing signal distributions depend on the sequence nu-
cleotides (as shown in Fig. 2). For DMS the separation of the paired
and unpaired signal distributions conditional on sequence nucleotide
appear to improve slightly (Supplementary Fig. 55). Whereas for
CMCT no improvement is obvious (Supplementary Fig. 56).
However, the prediction performance decreased for both models in
cross-evaluation (F—values of 0.40 for DM5 and 0.37 for CMCT),
likely due to the limited training data and many additional free par-
ameters (n = 18) introduced in this model even when discretized into
three bins only.

3.6 Modeling multiple data types

When available, integration of multiple probing data types should
increase prediction accuracy. We here show how ProbFold’s emis-
sion models can be extended to handle multiple data types, using the
single model as an example (Fig. 5a). Based on the emission models
of Figure 2, we suggest to model multiple types of probing data
(d1, d2, d3, d4 and d5) as independent given the nucleotide of the pri-
mary sequence. For the single model, the joint distribution thus be-
comes P(s,d1,d2,d3,d4,d5) = P(s) >< fit-5:1 P(di|s). The other
emission models can be simply defined following the same scheme.

To demonstrate the advantage of using multiple datasets, we per-
formed a proof-of-principle experiment based on boot-strapped
data, given the limited extent of existing real datasets for well anno-
tated structures (see Section 51.5 for details). Performance improved
when adding additional datasets, with the largest performance gains
for the first two sets and gradually smaller gains for the following
(Supplementary Fig. 57).

To further demonstrate the benefit of combining multiple prob-
ing datasets and to also include different data types, we applied the
multiple-data-set model to the six previously described RMDB
structures for which CMCT, DM5 and SHAPE are all available
(Cordero et al., 2012b). Given the limited extent of the available
datasets, each is modeled using only three bins, with KL optimized
break points (Section 51.3), to retain the number of model param-
eters. The experiment is thus still at the proof-of-principle level. As
more data become available, more bins can be used to capture the
structure signal of the probing data, which is expected to improve
performance. The performance was measured using leave-one-out
cross evaluation and averaged across all six structures (Table 2 and
Supplementary Table 514).

Both sensitivity and the overall performance as measured by ac-
curacy and F-value increase when incrementally adding each of the
three probing datasets, starting with sequence-only (Fig. 5b). A
slight decrease of PPV is observed when adding DMS. Integration of
SHAPE, DM5 and CMCT data have previously been carried out
using RNAstructure v. 5.3 and pseudo-energy terms (Cordero et al.,
2012a). For comparison, we evaluate the performance of the multi-
data version of RNAstructure on RMDB structures (Table 2 and
Supplementary Table 514). While RNAstructure performs much
better on the sequence-only dataset and achieves the highest overall
F—values, ProbFold shows the largest relative gains from including
probing datasets. ProbFold also show consistent gains with each
added dataset, which is not the case for the RNAstructure model
(Table 2). This suggests that the ProbFold emission models are able
to make good use of the available structure signal. The emission

of being unpaired

models can be further extended to account for dependencies both
within and among multiple datasets (Section 51.6).

To further illustrate the signal contribution of the individual prob-
ing data types, we plotted the raw activities (Fig. 5c) (Cordero et al.,
2012b) as well as the ProbFold pairing probabilities (Fig. 5c,
Supplementary Figs 59—514) against the known RNA secondary struc-
tures. The reactivities of the different data types generally correlate
well, with a few exceptions for CMCT (Fig. 5c). The SHAPE reactiv-
ities are more auto-correlated than those of CMCT and DM5, with
less local variance. As shown by the above performance evaluations,
all data types contribute useful structure signal for ProbFold, with an
increase in pairing probabilities for paired regions (Fig. 5d). In effect,

ProbFold thus averages out the noise in the data given the structure
constraints imposed by the primary sequence. Though SHAPE gener-
ally contribute the largest individual gains in pairing probabilities, the
combination of all three sets further adds to the difference between
the paired and unpaired reigons (Supplementary Figs 59—14).

4 Discussion

We have presented a probabilistic method for RNA secondary struc-
ture prediction that integrates experimental structure probing data.
One of the virtues of our approach is its flexibility. The underlying
model was initially developed on a capillary electrophoresis SHAPE
dataset, but it can readily be retrained and applied on other data
types given sufficient training data as well as extended to handle
multiple data types. We demonstrated these extensions with proof-
of-concept examples on existing datasets and on generated (boot-
strapped) data. We developed and trained versions of ProbFold for
SHAPE, SHAPE-seq, DM5 and CMCT probing data — both indi-
vidually and in combination. We also evaluated different variants of
these models, for instance including nucleotide dependencies. The
ﬂexibility is achieved by the use of a highly modular probabilistic
model with accompanying efficient algorithms for training and pre-
diction (Bishop, 2006; Durbin et al., 1998; Eddy, 2014; Eddy and
Durbin, 1994; Knudsen and Hein, 1999, 2003; Koller and Fridman,
2009; Nawrocki and Eddy, 2013; Pedersen et al., 2004, 2006; Rivas
and Eddy, 2001; Rivas et al., 2012; Sakakibara et al., 1994).

As with most other probabilistic RNA secondary structure pre-
diction methods (Rivas and Eddy, 2000; Metzler and Neble, 2008),
we use stochastic context-free grammars to model the secondary
structure. We find limited benefit of modeling stacking interactions,
as have others (Rivas et al., 2012). This may be because individual
base-pair parameters already account for most of the stacking inter-
action effects (Yakovchuk et al., 2006). We factorize the grammar
rules into transitions and emissions. In contrast to other methods,
we explicitly specify the emission distributions using probabilistic
graphical models (PGMs), which may be defined over multi-variate
input data. The implementation closely reﬂects this modularity,
with separate textual specifications of the overall grammar, the tran-
sitions, the PGMs defining the emission distributions; and the map-
ping of observed data to PGM variables.

As part of the model development, we evaluated correlations in
the probing data. We found modeling SHAPE probing data correl-
ations along the sequence improved performance, given enough
training data was present. In general, detecting and modeling the
prominent dependencies in the observed data is expected to improve

the fit and the discriminatory power of the emission distributions
and hence overall model performance. However, including correl-
ations makes the models more complex with many additional free
parameters to learn. Given the limited size of probing datasets for
training, overfitting and lack of robustness easily becomes a prob-
lem, as shown for parameter-rich versions of ProbFold (e.g.
Supplementary Fig. 51d and Supplementary Table 52).

ProbFold bins the continuous probing data values to allow for
the use of discrete PGMs. This simplifies the PGM implementation,
for instance by avoiding computationally expensive numerical inte-
gration, and avoids use of analytical continuous distributions with a
potentially poor fit. As the structural signal of the probing data de-
pends on the differences in its distribution in different structural re-
gions, both the number of bins and their boundaries are important
parameters of the model. We show that the number of bins should
be kept small given the amount of available training data to avoid
overfitting. We suggest to select bin boundaries by optimizing the
difference between the single and pair probing data distribution
using KL divergence.

As an alternative to discretizing the data, parameter free continu-
ous distributions, such as kernel distributions, could be used. These
however easily become computationally heavy, as they in principle
are specified by the full training dataset. Given knowledge of the un-
certainty of the probing data observations, a more satisfying ap-
proach would be to explicitly model the uncertainty of the
individual probing data values. Such knowledge would be available,
e.g. with counts from NGS-based probing data, as some of tran-
scriptome-wide approaches produce (Kertesz et al., 2010a,b; Lucks
etal., 2011).

The RNAstructure method converts SHAPE reactivities to
pseudo energy change terms, which are incorporated when predict-
ing the minimal free energy structure (Deigan et al., 2009). The con-
version is done using a simple linear parametric form, which only
requires two free parameters. Using a simple parametric form limits
the number of free parameters, but may also introduce bias if the fit
is poor in part of the probing data value range. In particular,
RNAstructure has been shown to perform extremely well on 165
rRNA when introducing several preprocessing steps and filters, such
as (i) selecting parameters performing well on 235; (ii) limiting the
allowed distance between base pairs; (iii) focusing on sites with use-
ful SHAPE data and (iv) disregarding sites with clear incompatibil-
ities with the comparative reference structure (Deigan et al., 2009).
Though individually helpful, manually selecting parameters and
introducing many preprocessing steps risk making the approach
more liable to overfitting on a concrete dataset. Direct calculation of
pseudo-energy change terms based on log-likelihood ratios of being
paired versus unpaired has also been suggested (Cordero et al.,
2012a), which is closer to the approach taken by ProbFold.

ProbFold has been designed with the aim of extendibility to
multi-variate probing data measurements. This could for instance be
the combination of SHAPE with other chemical or enzymatic prob-
ing agents, as in the proof-of-concept example using CMCT, DMS,
SHAPE data. If the noise in the individual measurements at a site are
correlated it becomes important to capture these correlations in the
model to retain specificity. Such correlations could for instance be
caused by tertiary structure interactions involving single stranded re-
gions, which may affect several types of probing agents, including
SHAPE. Specifically, non-canonical base pairs will often give similar
signal to canonically paired bases using SHAPE but not DMS.
Learning such correlations would therefore be expected to improve
prediction performance. As more and more RNA tertiary structures
are found, one solution could be to explicitly include tertiary

structure aspects into the model (Kopeikin and Chena, 2005 ; Lorenz
et al., 2013).

In the case of SHAPE, we did not observe any correlation be-
tween paired bases. However, such correlations may well exist for
other types of probing agents, such as double stranded RNases.
Even partial evidence for the presence of specific base pairs could
significantly improve performance by constraining and simplifying
the folding problem. Such evidence would resemble the signal ex-
ploited from compensatory base pair substitutions exploited in com-
parative RNA structure analysis. As suggested by Sukosd et al.
(2012), additional power could be gained by combining experimen-
tal probing data with comparative data, though this would be lim-
ited to functional and conserved RNA structures. However,
exploring these extensions is beyond the scope of the current study.

Through proof-of—principle experiments, we have illustrated the
applicability of ProbFold to different types of probing data and to
multiple complementary datasets (Fig. 5). The performance evalu-
ations show that ProbFold can make efficient and competitive use of
the probing data, both for SHAPE data and when combining mul-
tiple datasets (Tables 1 and 2). Retraining aids its adaptation to
varying noise levels. However, model performance is limited by the
small size of the available training datasets, which restricts model
complexity and hence predictive power.

We hope the advent of NGS-based high-throughput structure
probing techniques, as pioneered by Kertesz et al. (2010a,b),
Underwood et al. (2010) and Lucks et al. (2011), will result in large
uniform probing datasets of known structures assessed by multiple
probing agents. Concretely, inclusion of comprehesive sets of RNA
transcripts with known structures as spike-ins could help achive
this. This would allow multi-variate versions of ProbFold or similar
models to be trained, with an expected boost in performance charac-
teristics. Ultimately such approaches could help improve RNA struc-
ture maps transcriptome-wide.

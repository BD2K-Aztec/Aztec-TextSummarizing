Abstract

Motivation: The loci—ordering, based on two—point recombination fractions for a pair of loci, is the
most important step in constructing a reliable and fine genetic map.

Results: Using the concept from complex graph theory, here we propose a Laplacian ordering ap—
proach which uncovers the loci—ordering of multiloci simultaneously. The algebraic property for a
Fiedler vector of a Laplacian matrix, constructed from the recombination fraction of the loci—ordering
for 26 loci of barley chromosome IV, 846 loci of Arabidopsis thaliana and 1903 loci of Malus domes-
tica, together with the variable threshold uncovers their loci—orders. It offers an alternative yet robust

approach for ordering multiloci.

1 Introduction

A locus is the chromosome location of a gene, a genetic marker or
any specific DNA sequence, and can be regarded as a point on a
line. The loci-ordering is a linear arrangement of genes or genetic
markers in a linkage group which is a group of genes with their loci
located on the same chromosome. For these genes, the segregation
ratio for the genotypes and phenotypes departs from the Mendelian
law. Therefore, the loci—ordering is the most important step in con—
structing a reliable and fine genetic map. The loci-ordering also in-
cludes localizing a new locus, a disease, or a marker locus, on an
existing map. However computational estimation of loci—ordering
for dense genes is rate—limiting step in genetic mapping procedures
including linkage grouping or distance spacing between genes.
Genetic recombination is estimated by the recombination fraction,
which is the ratio of recombinant gametes to total gametes (G055 and
Harris, 1975; Kanaar and Hoeijmakers, 1998; Ott, 1999; White

et 61]., 1985). For homologous recombination, we expect that the
greater the physical distance between two loci on a chromosome, the
greater the chance they will recombine. Let [1, 12, . . . , 1,, denote n loci
in a linkage group, then our interest is ordering 11 loci to construct
genomic map based on two—point recombination fractions 7,],
1 g i < j g n for a pair of loci i and j, which usually ranges from 0 to
0.5. If two loci i and j are closely located, i.e. tightly linked, then 17,- is
close to 0, and if not it is away from 0. With 11 loci, there are n!/2 pos—
sible orderings if the orientation of the orders is ignored. Locus order—
ing searches for the best locus order among the possible orders
and it amounts to evaluating the maximum likelihood for each order.
With only 10 loci, for example, there are 1 814 000 possible orders,
and therefore, the loci—ordering entails a formidable computational
problem and is practically unfeasible.

In overcoming such difficulties, the loci-ordering minimizing the
number of crossovers was regarded as the best ordering, and this

method has been shown to be the maximum likelihood ordering
under the full penetrance assumption, i.e. lack of interference
(Thompson, 1987). Also, several other approaches, closely related
with this idea, have been suggested. Examples for objective score
functions used in other approaches are the minimum of adjacent re—
combination fractions criterion (Falk, 1989), the maximum sum of ad—
jacent lod scores criterion (Weeks and Lange, 1987), minimum sum of
the probability of double recombinants (Knapp et al., 1990), maximum
likelihood (Lander and Green, 1987), and minimum obligatory cross—
overs (Thomson, 1988). Most searching procedures for optimizing
those objective score functions are exhaustive and the efficient tech—
niques for searching strategies are necessary. To reduce the exhaustive
searching procedures, seriation (Lander et al., 2009) and branch—and—
bound (Buetow and Chakravarti, 1987) searching techniques have
been suggested. Comparisons among minimized or maximized score
functions described above have been made (Cheema and Dicks, 2009;
Hackett and Broadfood 2003; Kammerer and MacCluer, 1988; Olson
and Boehnke, 1990). Softwares for computing genetic maps by using
various objective score functions and optimizing techniques have been
developed and distributed such as MAPMAKER (Lander, et al., 2009),
JoinMap (Criscione et al., 2009; Van Ooijen, 2006), CarthaGene (de
Givry, et al., 2005 ), Neighbour mapping (Ellis, 1997), MapManger
QTX (Manly et al., 2001), RECORD (Van Os et al., 2005),
AntMap (Iwata and Ninomiya, 2006), MSTMAP (Wu et al., 2008),
MadMapper (West et al., 2006).

Here we suggest a conceptually different yet a simple Laplacian
ordering method for the loci—ordering via the Fiedler vector (Fiedler,
1973; Fiedler, 1975), taking the close analogy with the recent develop—
ment for characterizing complex network phenomenon in broad areas
(Amaral et al., 2000; Buldyrev et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2006; Getz
et al., 2000; Liljeros et al., 2001), which circumvents most of the diffi-
culties in the previous approaches (Falk, 1989; Kammerer and
MacCluer, 1988; Knapp et al., 1990; Lander and Green, 1987; Olson
and Boehnke, 1990; Thompson, 1987; Weeks and Lange, 1987). We
view that the elements of a correlation matrix, constructed from two—
point recombination fractions 7,], 1 g i < j g n for a pair of loci i and 1',
share a complex correlation for n loci in a linkage group. The Fiedler
vector from the graph theory has been used for several graph manipula—
tions such as partitioning (Pothen et al., 1990), linear labelling (Juvan
and Mohar, 1992) and envelope minimization (Barnard et al., 1993;
Juvan and Mohar, 1992). Recently, the Fiedler vector was successfully
employed in clustering and classification problem of complex network-
ing phenomena (Kim et al., 2008).

2 Methods

2.1 Laplacian matrix and Fiedler vector

The adjacency matrix A of a graph G with n vertices is defined as an n
x n symmetric matrix with components 61,-], where the diagonal elem—
ents 61,-,- are equal to zero for all i = 1, 2, . . . , n. The Laplacian matrix of
a graph G is defined as L = D - A, where D, called the degree matrix,

IS a d1agonal matr1x w1th the 1th d1agonal element d,- : Zi_1 aij. Note

that the Laplacian matrix is symmetric and positive semidefinite. The
exact algebraic property of the Laplacian matrix is the following. If the
graph is one connected cluster as a whole, the rank of the Laplacian
matrix is n - 1, so that the smallest eigenvalue of L : L(G) is always
zero with constant eigenvector and all other eigenvalues are positive.
Let 0 = 21 < 22 <  < in be 11 eigenvalues of L in an increasing order,
then an eigenvector corresponding to 22, the nonzero smallest eigen—
value, is called the Fiedler vector and an eigenvector corresponding

to in, the largest eigenvalue, is called the Frobenius vector. The sum of
eigenvector elements for each of nonzero eigenvalue is always zero. If
the graph, however, consists of M disconnected clusters, the number of
zero eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix L(G) for the whole graph is
equal to M. For each disconnected cluster, the exact algebraic property
for eigenvalues and eigenvectors mentioned above still holds.

2.2 Eigenvalue equation for a Laplacian matrix

Let 61,-,- denote a closeness in the sense of genetic distance such as the
Haldane distance or the Kosambi distance between two loci i and j,
which are proportional to 17,- for very small distance. That is to say,
if two loci i and j are closely located, then 61,-,- is large, and if they are
far away from each other, then an is small. Also let 2 2 (z1, . . . , Zn)’,
where z,- denotes the relative order of the ith locus among 11 loci.
Then, the motivation on loci ordering is as follows; if two loci i and
j are closely located (i.e. large (1,-j), then z,- and z,- should be very close.
On the other hand, if two loci i and j are located far away from each
other (i.e. small (1,-j), then z,- and z,- should be very different. Hence,
our goal can be achieved by minimizing the weighted sum of squares

Q = E: (Zr — @2417

1:1 1':

To avoid the trivial solution z,- = 0 for all i, the constraint z’z : 1 is

imposed. Also, the constraint 2’ 1 : 0, where 1 : (1, . . . , 1)’, is

imposed since the minimum is invariant under translations.
Therefore, the problem can be rewritten as

211'ngan   (z,- — z,) 61,-,-

subject to z’z:1 and z’1:0
To solve the problem, note that

Q = E: (Z,- — Zzizi + Z,- )aii
i=1 {:1

i=1 {:1 igéj

To minimize Q subject to z’;z : 1, use Lagrangian method, i.e.
for a Lagrangian multiplier 2,

T : z’Lz — 2(z’z — 1)
E

:> (L — 21)z = 0

:2Lz—22220

which yields a nontrivial solution 2 if and only if 2 is an eigenvalue
of L and z is the corresponding eigenvector. By multiplying 2’ on
both sides, we have

z’Lzzi

Therefore, the nonzero smallest eigenvalue and the associated
eigenvector, which is just the Fiedler vector, yield the optimal solution.

3.1 Strategy of Laplacian ordering method

for loci—ordering

We describe how to use the Fiedler vector to the loci—ordering based
on estimates of recombination fraction 17,- between two loci i and j,

1 g i < j g 11. Let the adjacency between two loci i and j be 61,-,- = 1 —
17,- because if two genes are closely located the 61,-,- will be close to 1.
On the other hand, if these are far away from each other, 61,-,- will be
small because 17,- becomes large. Also let 2 2 (z1, . . . , zn)’, where z,-
denotes the relative order of the ith gene among 11 genes. For ex-
ample, ifz : (—1/\/6, 0, 1/x/6, —\/2/\/6,  then the resulting
order is (2, 3, 4, 1, 5) or (4, 3, 2, 5, 1). Therefore, estimating the
order of n loci corresponds to finding 2. It can be shown that z is the
eigenvector associated with the nonzero smallest eigenvalue of the
Laplacian matrix of 61,-], and is just the Fiedler vector.

For an illustrative example, we consider 26 loci of barley
chromosome IV generated by the North American Barley Genome
Mapping Project (NABGMP) (Liu, 1998). The adjacency matrix for
26 loci is represented by a heat map in Figure 1a when they are ran—
domly ordered. The simple subjection of Laplacian ordering method
to the adjacency matrix for 26 loci produced loci—ordering results
which are contrary to our expectation because raw data are quite
often contaminated by noise which might give rise to poor results.
Several methods are available to remove the noise, and the idea of
shrinkage (James and Stein, 1961) is one of the widely used methods
among them and further developed (Bickel, 1983; Donoho and
Johnston, 1994; Efromovich, 1985; Efromovich and Pinsker, 1982;
Nussbaum, 1985). Among methods of shrinkage, the hard-thresh-
old, given by tH(x) : xI (|x| > (3) where (3 > 0 is a threshold param-
eter to be estimated, is often used. We note that the hard—threshold
is a fixed threshold in the sense that it annihilates all the compo—
nents, which are less than (3, of the adjacency matrix. In the Fiedler
vector, the ordering is given when a small (3 is used, and the cluster—
ing given when a large (3 is used, however, it is not easy to choose an
appropriate (3 for either ordering or clustering (Kim et al., 2008).

Here we propose a new method of shrinkage, called the variable
threshold which turns out to be especially useful in the multiloci—
ordering problem. The idea of variable threshold is intuitive and very
simple. In each row (or column) of the adjacency matrix 61,-], we re—
place each value by a very small value A, for example A : 0.01 in
order to keep the whole cluster as a connected one, except 13 largest
values, where k is a parameter to be estimated. Consequently, the de—
gree of threshold for each row (or column) of the adjacency matrix
will be different, and that’s why we call this method the variable
threshold. Therefore, it is apparent that the hard—threshold does not
consider the characteristic aspects of each row (or column) of the ad—
jacency matrix whereas the variable threshold is flexible because it
keeps characteristics of at least 13 adjacent loci in networks.
Determination of k is based on the following arguments. Note that
for large 13, there will be a lot of non—small components still keeping
the noisy contributions in the adjacency matrix. On the other
hand, for small 13, there will be a lot of very small components in the
adjacency matrix. In general, the components of Fiedler vector

method with a variable threshold k = 3 and (c) the true loci-order. It shows

corresponding to the non—zero smallest eigenvalue manifest relative
weight hence ordering among them, and contain different values for
large 13. For small 13, they contain several groups of same values, and
each group corresponds to a different cluster. These different clusters
could also be identified easily if we take A = 0.0 since in this case the
number of zero eigenvalues upon diagonalizing a Laplacian matrix 61,-,-
is equal to the number of disconnected hence different clusters. To be
more specific, the Fiedler vector shows the clustering pattern for small
13, and the ordering pattern for large k. We choose [a at which the pat—
tern of the Fiedler vector changes from the clustering to the ordering.
Therefore, we need to increase [a from 2 to the integer at which the
clustering pattern disappears and the ordering behaviour is maximally
achieved since the noisy components of the adjacency matrix are min-
imally included.

To see how variable threshold affects estimation of loci-ordering,
we first define three measures for the performance of estimators. Let
t : (t(1), ..., t(n)) and e = (6(1), ..., e(n)), where t(i) denotes the
true order of the ith gene and 6(1) denotes the estimated order of the
ith gene, respectively. Also, let c = (6(1), ..., C(71)), where C(i) de—
notes the bootstrap confidence interval of 95% for the locus of 1th
gene, implying that among 1000 bootstrap gene orders made by
resampling technique the locus is located at the map position 95 %
of the time (Efron and Tibshirani, 1998; Liu, 1998). Therefore, the
best possible order of the 26 loci is 1, 2, . . . , 26, where each number
represents the relative locus of each gene. If t and c are known, the
accuracy of the estimated order 6 can be measured by NCL:

2721160) =e(z')), NCLCI: 27211690) e 6(1)), and SAD:
:7:1|t(i)—e(i)|, where NCL denotes the number of correctly

ordered loci, NCLCI denotes the number of correct loci contained in
the bootstrap confidence interval and SAD denotes the sum of abso—
lute difference between the true order and the estimated order. Note
that NCLCI is a relaxed accuracy measure compared to NCL.
Therefore, good estimates should have both the large value of NCL
and NCLCI and the small value of SAD simultaneously.

3.2 Loci—ordering of 26 loci of barley chromosome N
data
Having a simple and general conceptual picture for both the cluster—
ing and the ordering of any given adjacency matrix, guaranteed by
the exact algebraic property of a Laplacian matrix and its Fiedler
vector, we apply the Laplacian ordering method with the variable
threshold to the 26 loci of barley chromosome IV data.
Firstly, we take A = 0.0 and diagonalize Laplacian matrices L for k
: 2, 3, 4, . . . , 25 in order to identify a value [a "' which separates the
clustering behaviour from the ordering behaviour of the Fiedler vec—
tor. It turns out that the number of zero eigenvalues is 2 for k : 2,
and 1 for 13 >2. It immediately implies that k” is 3 at which the
ordering behaviour of components of the Fiedler vector is best envis—
aged compared to those for k > 3. Secondly, we also take A = 0.01
and repeat diagonalizing L. In this case the number of zero eigen-
values is 1 for all k = 2, 3, 4, . . . , 25. The Fiedler vector for k : 2,
however, also shows a clustering pattern of two distinct region of
loci whereas those for k > 2 show an ordering pattern as listed in the
second row of Supplementary Table S1. Since the components of
Fiedler vector manifest the relative weight of each of 26 loci, we
rank order them for k > 2 in the ascending order, and list both the
component of Fiedler vector and the corresponding rank next to it
in Supplementary Table S1.

The quality of the predicted loci—order compared to the true loci—
order is estimated for each k by the values of NCL, NCLCI and
SAD. Supplementary Figure S1 illustrates the values of these three

estimators as 12 changes from 25 down to 3. The best loci—ordering
occurs at k = 3 at which NCL, NCLCI (SAD) attains the maximum
(minimum) value of 18, 26 (12) simultaneously. The fact that
NCLCI is also 26 for k = 16—19 does not necessarily imply the oc—
currence of the best loci—order because NCL and SAD for these [a
values are much worse than those for k = 3. Based on the predicted
loci—order for k = 3 from our Laplacian ordering method, we also il—
lustrate the closeness of a predicted heat map (see Fig. 1b) of the ad—
jacency matrix, which is constructed from the random heat map (see
Fig. 1a) without any loci—ordering a priori, to that (see Fig. 1c) from
the true loci—order.

3.3 Practical application to a high—density genetic map
We apply the Laplacian ordering method to data with a high—density
genetic map. We use an experimental data with single feature poly—
morphism (SFP) makers and a recombinant inbred lines (RIL) geno-
type population derived from Arabidopsis thalicma, which is
available in ATGC website served by Kozik (http://www.atgc.org/
XLinkage/MadMapper/ath_sfp_map_example). This website pro—
vides detail procedures constructing the linkage maps by the
MadMapper software scripts (West et al., 2006). The RIL popula—
tion with 846 genetic markers is employed in this work, which is
believed to be high quality data and obtained by filtering steps such
as non—redundant scores and ‘parental min—max method’, ‘RIL dis-
tribution’ algorithms for removing ambiguous genotypes and reduc—
ing missing genotype scores (West et al., 2006).

The recombination fractions from the RIL population for 846
makers are constructed by using a MadMapper script. The initial
adjacency matrix given by randomized index—headers is constructed
(see Fig. 2a). We diagonalize the Laplacian matrix with A = 0.00 at
different variable threshold 12 by increasing from k = 3—42. It takes
533 seconds over total 39 diagonalizing processes based on a Linux
machine with 3.3GHz Xeon CPUs. The numbers of clusters (linkage
groups) versus [a in Figure 2b are identified by counting the number
of zero eigenvalue. Interestingly we find five clusters at very wide
range of variable threshold from k = 12 to k : 41. Grouping
of 846 genetic markers into 5 chromosomes are made by the cluster—
ing pattern (grouping elements with same values) in the Fiedler
vector at k = 12 and with A = 0.01. Classification into five linkage
groups exactly correspond to the separation of genetic markers on
the five chromosome (209, 122, 156, 140, 219 markers for chromo-
some 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, respectively) in Arabidopsis. The heat map in
Figure 2c shows not ordering but clustering of genetic markers by
the Fiedler vector (five block sizes are 209, 122, 219, 140, 156).

Loci-ordering of 846 genetic markers should be performed separ—
ately on five chromosomes. And the quality of the resulting loci—order
from Laplacian approach in this work should be compared with that

from the existing other method, such as MadMapper (West et al.,
2006). The RIL populations of five linkage groups (see Fig. 3a—e) are
plotted by the MadMapper script for chromosome 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, re-
spectively. We generate the initial adjacency matrix (see Fig. 3f—j) given
by randomized index—headers of markers and the heat maps ordered by
the MadMapper software scripts (see Fig. 3k—o). The Laplacian loci-
ordering method also provides heat maps (see Fig. 3p—t) which are very
similar to the heat maps by the MadMapper method. The variable
threshold 12"“ at which clustering pattern disappears are 8, 12, 11, 7, 11
for chromosome 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, respectively. For the chromosome 1 hav—
ing 209 markers, we checked the computation time. By the
MadMapper script which uses the usual optimization algorithm mini-
mizing total scores, it takes 1 h and 32 min based on a Linux machine
with 3.3GHz Xeon CPUs. By using the Laplacian loci-ordering
method, it takes only 3.6 s for performing total 11 Laplacian proced—
ures from k = 3 to k = 12 with A = 0.00 and at 12"" = 8 with A = 0.01.
The comparison plots between two approaches in loci—ordering (see
Fig. 3u—y) show globally similar but slight differences in dense regions
where recombination fractions between neighboring loci are very small.

3.4 Missing data and reliability score for each locus

The 148 RIL population with 209 genetic markers on the chromo—
some 1 has 0.6% missing genotypes through filtering process. All re-
combination fractions between loci (genetic markers) can be
evaluated even through filtering process. Now we check how the
Laplacian loci—ordering method works well even with missing geno—
types. We randomly replace genotypes to be missed artificially from
1% to 10% composition more in the RIL data. For missing replace-
ments from 1% (total 1.6%) to 4% (total 4.6% missing genotypes),
all recombination fractions can be evaluated. However values of re—
combination fractions are somewhat changed so that the loci—order—
ing is also changed (SAD between two loci—orders with 0.6%
and 4.6% missing genotypes is 148) in Figure 4a and b. With total
5.6% missing genotypes, we observe missing recombination frac—
tions. In constructing adjacency matrix, we assign the recombin—
ation fraction to be 0.5 for those missing data. While we see a little
missing data (0.096%) in the adjacency matrix for total 5 .6 % miss—
ing genotypes, we see many missing data (18.2%) in Figure 4c for
total 8.6% missing genotypes, but the loci—ordering is not signifi-
cantly changed (SAD between two loci—orders is 290) in Figure 4d.
For further missing recombination fractions (37.6%) in Figure 4e
for total 9.6% missing genotypes, the loci—ordering is not working
as shown in Figure 4f. The heat map shows bad ordering due to
many missing data. The comparison in loci—ordering between 0.6 %
and 9.6 % missing genotypes shows no more linear correlation (SAD
between two loci—orders is 8058). Therefore we recognize that our
Laplacian approach is working even with 8.6% missing genotypes
and 18.2% missing recombination data for 209 loci on the chromo—
some 1.

The input data of our software using the Laplacian matrix are
not the RIL populations or f2 intercross populations directly deter—
mined by experiments but the recombination fractions evaluated
from the RIL or f2 intercross data. Hence we do not present any cri—
teria in filtering process for reducing missing genotype scores and
removing uncertain genotypes. Instead our program provides a key
algorithm for loci-ordering based on recombination fractions not
providing whole packages from processing experimental data to
mapping linkage maps. Even though we do not have the filtering
steps, our method provides excellent loci—ordering among high qual-
ity loci data even under the condition that low quality loci data were

slightly embedded.

from MadMapper approach with that from our Laplacian approach

The Laplacian loci-ordering method could not add any weight-
ing factor on specific loci of previously known maps or recombin-
ation fractions derived from high quality statistics. It means that the
elements of Laplacian matrix after filtering the variable threshold
process have equal weights in diagonalizing L, so that we could not
assign any reliability scores for each locus at a given 12. Instead we
have to determine the reliability scores for each locus analyzing over
several loci-orders at variable threshold 12 > 12*. As we see in the pre-
vious sections and Supplementary Figure S1, we obtain the best loci-
ordering at 12* where clustering pattern disappears in increasing 12.

At 12 > 12*, a bit poor orders might be given at some markers due to
a little noisy data. But we get reliable placements of markers check-
ing over loci-orders at 12 > 12*. Reliability scores for 26 loci of barley
chromosome and 209 loci of Arabidopsis are given in the program
package of the supplementary data.

3.5 Application to F1 populations in outbreeding
species

We apply the Laplacian ordering method to additional complex
data with F1 apple populations (Gardner et al, 2014). This

(MRF 0.5) and (d—f) approximate r,-,- (MRF App). The loci-order comparison

outbreeding heterozygous system is analyzed by the next—generation
DNA sequencing method, which are cost—effective but provide rela—
tively low quality data with many missing data. Initially 273 835
SNP markers were identified by sequence alignments but after many
filtering processes only 1903 markers could be considered in con—
structing genetic linkage maps. We constructed two—point recombin—
ation fractions ril- by counting recombinant events and using the
Newton—Raphson algorithm to find out the maximum LOD score
(Zhang et a1, 2015). The Laplacian clustering procedure for 1903
markers results in 17 linkage groups which are exactly consistent
with published results by Gardner et al. Loci—ordering by Laplacian
method was performed for all 17 chromosomes. The heat maps and

comparison plots of orders for the chromosome 3 are shown in
Figure 5. We observe moderate correlations between two orders by
using the JoinMap package and the Laplacian loci—ordering method.
The comparison plots of physical map to genetic maps constructed
by different methods reveal that both correlations are moderate
since the original data were not good enough to provide high quality
genetic maps. But we can advocate that our Laplacian loci—ordering
can be applicable to the further complex genotyping populations.
The detailed descriptions and results for other chromosomes are
given in the supplementary data.

3.6 Software forthe Laplacian loci—ordering method

We provide three key files (main fortran program, input parameter
data file, input recombination fraction data file) and peripheral files
(Manual.txt, Score.f, GeneMarker.dat, Aij_three.gnu, etc) for
describing software package and analyzing output data. Here we
present the brief procedures for making use of the loci—ordering ap—
proach. The detailed step—by—step procedures for using the loci—
ordering and clustering linkage groups are presented in manual files
of software package.

1. Run a main program (executable ﬁle for Laplacian_Loci.f) with
A = 0.0 and at variable threshold 12:2, 3, 4, 5, . . .

2. Check the number of clusters by counting the number of
zero eigenvalues in an output ﬁle (Output ﬁle: Laplacian_
Eigenvalues.dat). Determine 12* (when the number of zero eigen—
value is 1 in increasing 12).

3. Run a main program (executable ﬁle for Laplacian_Loci.f) with
A : 0.01 and at 12*.

4. Sorting the elements of the Fiedler vector. We provide two
orders (ascending order and descending order in sorting the
elements. Output ﬁles: Loci_ordering_ascending.dat and Loci_
ordering_descending.dat)

4 Conclusions

In this work we present a simple Laplacian loci—ordering method
which enables one to uncover the loci—order of multiloci simultan-
eously, which has been known as a challenging problem. This ap-
proach is made possible by taking the close analogy with the
important conceptual development recently achieved for character—
izing various complex network phenomena. Once constructing a
Laplacian matrix from the recombination fraction of multiloci, the
exact properties for the Fiedler vector of Laplacian matrix together
with the variable threshold are directly applied to uncover the loci—
order of 26 loci of barley chromosome IV data, 846 loci of
Arabidopsis chromosome data and 1903 loci of heterozygous apple
data. It offers both a simple method without any assumptions a pri—
ori and a very fast one computationally for uncovering not only the
clustering behaviour but also the ordering behaviour of any number
of loci simultaneously.

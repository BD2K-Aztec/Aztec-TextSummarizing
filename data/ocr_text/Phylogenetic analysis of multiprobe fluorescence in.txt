ABSTRACT

Motivation: Development and progression of solid tumors can be
attributed to a process of mutations, which typically includes changes
in the number of copies of genes or genomic regions. Although com-
parisons of cells within single tumors show extensive heterogeneity,
recurring features of their evolutionary process may be discerned by
comparing multiple regions or cells of a tumor. A useful source of data
for studying likely progression of individual tumors is fluorescence
in situ hybridization (FISH), which allows one to count copy numbers
of several genes in hundreds of single cells. Novel algorithms for in-
terpreting such data phylogenetically are needed, however, to recon-
struct likely evolutionary trajectories from states of single cells and
facilitate analysis of tumor evolution.

Results: In this article, we develop phylogenetic methods to infer likely
models of tumor progression using FISH copy number data and apply
them to a study of FISH data from two cancer types. Statistical ana-
lyses of topological characteristics of the tree-based model provide
insights into likely tumor progression pathways consistent with the
prior literature. Furthermore, tree statistics from the resulting phyloge-
nies can be used as features for prediction methods. This results in
improved accuracy, relative to unstructured gene copy number data,
at predicting tumor state and future metastasis.

1 INTRODUCTION

Recent studies of genetic variation in solid tumors have revealed
massive intratumor heterogeneity in the spectrum of genomic
changes within single tumors (Gerlinger et al., 2012;
Heselmeyer—Haddad et al., 2012; Navin et al., 2010, 2011).
These observations suggest the importance of understanding
cell-to-cell variability, but profiling large numbers of single
cells and building coherent models of their evolution remain
challenging problems. Fluoresence in situ hybridization (FISH)
is a technique that can be used to count the copy number of
DNA probes for speciﬁc genes or chromosomal regions that
has proven useful in studying cancer. Gene gains and losses are
common in solid tumors, and FISH provides a practical and

reliable method for monitoring such changes in large numbers
of individual cells from single tumors (Heselmeyer-Haddad et al.,
2002; Janocko et al., 2001). FISH is even more useful when one
uses multiple colors to monitor multiple genes simultaneously
(Heselmeyer-Haddad et al., 2012; Martins et al., 2012; Wangsa
et al., 2009). In this article, we developed new methods to model
and analyze the progression of copy number changes, as mea-
sured by multi-color FISH. Our methods include analysis of
multiple samples from the same patient, typically from different
cancer stages.

We applied the new methods to published data on cervical
cancer with four gene probes (Wangsa et al., 2009) and breast
cancer with eight gene probes (Heselmeyer-Haddad et al., 2012).
The data for each sample are presented as a matrix, where each
column is one of the probes and each row is a ‘cell count pattern’
of four probe counts, such as 2,3,4,l (or eight counts for breast
cancer), and the number of cells matching that pattern. A normal
cell has the count pattern of all 2’s. Both datasets include paired
samples from an earlier stage and a later stage in the same
patient.

It is of interest to study cervical and breast cancer, as we do,
because the number of cases of cervical cancer and breast cancer
diagnosed early has increased owing to Pap smears and mam-
mograms, respectively. Early diagnosis is important because
lymph node metastasis is one of the best predictors of poor out-
come (Buckley et al., 1988; Elledge and McGuire, 1993).
Paradoxically, it has been shown statistically that early diagnosis
of breast cancer has not led to a substantial decrease in deaths
because most of the cancers diagnosed early would not progress
to be life-threatening if left untreated (Bleyer and Welch, 2012).
These are large-scale studies that do not address the benefits of
early detection in individual cases. Therefore, a consistent eX-
planation of these ﬁndings is that earlier detection could be of
clinical value if there were a better understanding of tumor evo-
lution to help identify the early-stage cancers likely to progress to
dangerous forms.

The problem of modeling tumor progression has been studied
by a variety of techniques and using different kinds of tumor
data (Beerenwinkel et al., 2005; Cheng et al., 2012; Desper
et al., 1999; Gerstung et al., 2009; Greenman et al., 2012;
Martins et al., 2012; Pennington et al., 2007; Shlush et al.,
2012; Subramanian et al., 2012; von Heydebreck et al., 2004;
Xu et al., 2012). Several of these methods used techniques
from the area of phylogenetics (reviewed by Attolini and
Michor, 2009) because of the insight that tumor genomes

evolve (Cahill et al., 1999; Nowell et al., 1976). Most prior studies
have used either comparative genome hybridization or sequen-
cing of cell populations, which have the advantage that one can
do genome-wide analysis, but the disadvantage that the input
data are explicitly or implicitly averaged over many cells of the
same tumor. Other data types can offer distinct advantages, such
as the microsatellite data used by Shlush et al. (2012), which can
allow some inference of useful population genetic parameters
generally difﬁcult to assess with tumor data.

FISH is the only currently available reliable technique that
allows measurements on enough individual cells to model the
evolution of substantial intratumor heterogeneity. The disadvan-
tage of FISH is that it uses only a small number of preselected
markers. Only two of the previous studies analyzed FISH data
(Martins et al., 2012; Pennington et al., 2007). These studies were
limited either to two probes (Pennington et al., 2007) or to three
probes and coarsely distinguishing only loss (copy number <2),
neutral (copy number 2) and gain (copy number >2) (Martins
et al., 2012).

We address a need for new methods capable of handling the
larger numbers of cells and probes in recent FISH datasets. More
speciﬁcally, we aim to develop a theoretical foundation for efﬁ-
cient handling of large copy number datasets. Toward this goal,
we develop theory and algorithms for a model of tumor progres-
sion driven by gains and losses associated with FISH probes. Our
methods handle in principle any number of probes and any range
of copy numbers 0 through MAX_COPY (default 9). The use of
MAX_COPY limits the combinatorial search and hence running
time of our methods on inputs where the measured copy num-
bers exceed this limit. The work is intended to establish a frame-
work capable of giving useful tree inferences on state-of—the-art
FISH data, which might be extended in future work to handle
even harder problem instances and more realistic models of
tumor evolution.

Our contributions include the following:

(1) Reducing a model of the problem of modeling progression
of FISH probe cell count patterns to the Rectilinear
Steiner Minimum Tree { RSM T ) problem and thus bring-
ing prior theory on the RSMT problem to bear on the
FISH phylogeny problem.

(2) Design and implementation of an exponential-time exact
method and a polynomial-time heuristic method to con-
struct trees modeling the progression of cell count
patterns.

(3) Mathematical proof and software implementation of a
new inequality that speeds up the RSM T -based
computation.

(4) Deﬁnition and evaluation of new test statistics based on
the trees computed by our methods. These test statistics
give novel insight into the selective pressures in tumor pro-
gression, compared with test statistics derived from the cell
count patterns alone.

(5) Deﬁnition and evaluation of ‘features’ based on the tree
structures that can be used with machine learning to clas-
sify the tumors. For example, we show improved effective-
ness at distinguishing the cervical tumors that metastasize
from those that do not.

2 METHODS

In this section, we describe a set of algorithms to identify a most parsi-
monious tree of copy number changes consistent with a dataset on
cell-level tumor copy-number heterogeneity. We ﬁrst describe an expo-
nential-time exact algorithm. We next propose a set of valid inequalities
to reduce the running time of the algorithm. We then propose a heuristic
approach that returns an approximate solution in polynomial time. Both
the exact and heuristic methods are implemented in the C++ software
package FISHtrees (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/FISHtrees).

2.1 Datasets

The cervical cancer (CC) dataset contains genomic copy numbers of the
four oncogenes LAMPS (Kanao et al., 2005), PROX I (W igle and Oliver,
1999), PRKAAI (Huang et al., 2006) and CCNDI (Fu et al., 2004) on
samples from 16 lymph node-positive and 15 lymph node-negative pa-
tients (Wangsa et al., 2009). For the lymph node-positive patients, this
dataset contains a sample from the primary tumor and another from the
metastasis, making the total number of samples 47. The number of cells
per sample ranges from 223 to 250, after ﬁltering to remove cells that
likely had cut nuclei and those in the process of division, as described
previously (Heselmeyer-Haddad et al., 2012). The breast cancer (BC)
dataset contains copy numbers of ﬁve oncogenes, typically, but not
always, gained—COX-2 (Howe et al., 2001), M YC (Wolfer and
Ramaswamy, 2011), CCNDI (Fu et al., 2004), HER-2 (Tan and Yu,
2007) and ZNF2I7 (Nonet et al., 2001)—and three tumor suppressor
genes, typically lost—DBC2 (Hamaguchi et al., 2002), CDHI
(Birchmeier and Behrens, 1994) and p53 (Vousden and Lane, 2007)—
from 26 paired samples, one from the ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)
and one from an invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), from 13 patients. The
number of interphase cells ranges from 76 to 220. The FISH protocol
ﬁlters out cells that are in the process of DNA replication using the fact
that these cells have recognizable FISH probe doublets (W angsa et al.,
2009).

2.2 RSMT problem

For each patient sample, each cell assayed will have some non-negative
integer number of copies of each probe. If we consider measurements on d
probes in c cell count patterns for a given patient, then that patient’s in-
formation can be represented by a two-dimensional array D with c rows
and d +1 columns where entry D(i, j), for j: 1, d, represents the copy
number of gene j in sample pattern i, and column d+ 1 has the number
of cells with this count pattern. All counts above MAX_COPY are reduced
to that value. Each row of D can be treated as a point in Rd. Our goal is to
explain the observed data via a phylogenetic tree of single gene duplication
and loss events. We use the L1, or rectilinear distance metric for inferring
the Steiner nodes in Rd. If we are given a set S of points in Rd, and we build
a Steiner tree T spanning S, then for any particular edge e, joining points
x = (x1, x2 , . . . , xd) and y = (yl, yz , . . . , yd), the rectilinear distance w(e) is
deﬁned by w(e)=|x1—y1|+|x2—y2| +---+|xd—ydl. The problem of
identifying a minimum weight tree including all the observed points and,
as needed, unobserved Steiner nodes with the rectilinear metric is known as
the RSM T problem (Hanan, 1966; Snyder, 1992).

The RSM T problem is NP-complete (Garey and Johnson, 1977) and
thus does not have an efﬁcient exact algorithm. One potential advantage
of reducing to Steiner trees is that there are high-quality implementations
of sophisticated branch-and-cut methods that solve large instances to
optimality (Koch and Martin, 1998; Polzin and Daneshman, 2001). To
keep our implementation free and self-contained, we implemented a sim-
pler domain-speciﬁc method for our instances of RSM T. We developed
an inefﬁcient exact algorithm and a heuristic algorithm based on the
median-joining algorithm for maximum parsimony phylogenetics
(Bandelt et al., 1999) adapted for RSM T using theoretical results from
Hanan (1966) and Snyder (1992).

2.3 Exact algorithm for the RSMT problem

An exact algorithm for the RSM T problem in two dimensions was ﬁrst
proposed by Hanan (1966). Hanan’s theorem implies that if we draw lines
parallel to the two axes through each of the points in S, then there exists
an RSM T of S whose Steiner nodes will be located at the intersections of
those lines, a two-dimensional grid known as the Hanan grid that iden-
tiﬁes a ﬁnite set of positions where the Steiner nodes might be found.
Snyder (1992) generalized Hanan’s theorem to any dimension d. To for-
mally present Snyder’s theorem, assume S is a set of points in a d dimen-
sional space Rd and that x1, x2 , . . . , xd are the coordinate axes of Rd. Let
P=(p1,p2, . . . ,pd) be a point belonging to S. There are d hyperplanes
orthogonal to the coordinate axes that contain P. Suppose N(P, i) is one
of those hyperplanes that is orthogonal to the axis x,. Hanan’s grid in d
dimensional space is formed by taking the union of all N(P, i) for all
points P and all dimensions i. Formally, the Hanan grid H ( S j in d
dimensions is deﬁned as,

H(S) = UN(P,i)VP e s and 1 g i g d

For each subset of the form {N(Pl, 1), N(P2, 2),. . . , N(Pd, 0’», there is
a point at which the d hyperplanes intersect. If the set of all of these
intersection points are denoted as I H(S ), then the generalized Hanan’s
theorem, proposed and proved by Snyder is the following:

THEOREM 1. (Snyder 1992) For a given set of points S C Rd, there exists
an RSM T T of S, such that if Q is a Steiner point of T, then Q e [H(S).

According to Theorem 1, the possible Steiner nodes are the intersection
points of the Hanan grid H(S). For each possible number of Steiner
nodes k, Algorithm 1 enumerates all subsets of k potential Steiner
nodes from those allowed by the generalized Hanan’s theorem. For
each such subset, the algorithm constructs a minimum spanning tree
(MST) using the observed data points and those k speciﬁc Steiner
nodes. The minimum cost tree over all such subsets and all possible
values of k is returned as the optimal tree. This method is guaranteed
to ﬁnd an optimal solution to the RSMT problem. More efﬁcient
approaches, such as that proposed in Dreyfus and Wagner (1971),
cannot be used in our case, as they assume that all the terminal nodes
must be leaf nodes in the Steiner tree, while in tumor progression trees, a
terminal node can be a parent node of other terminal nodes. Below, we
show that the Algorithm 1 run time is at worst exponential in the number
of potential Steiner nodes and the size of the probe set.

THEOREM 2. The time complexity Of Algorithm 1 is exponential in the
number of potential Steiner nodes.

PROOF. If MAX_COPY+ 1 =m, then, by Theorem 1, the total number
of possible Steiner nodes to be considered is szmd. To ﬁnd the exact
solution, we consider each possible subset of the inferred Steiner nodes
and build a minimum spanning tree on the set of terminals and subset of
Steiner nodes under consideration. The total number of subsets of a set
with cardinality n is 2”. We implemented Prim’s algorithm for MST and
its complexity is 0(nlogn). So, the total running time of Algorithm 1 is
0(2snlogn).

Input: A point set S
Output: Steiner tree including the set of inferred Steiner nodes and weight
of the Steiner tree

if(current_mst_weight < min_weight) then
min_weight = curren t_mst_weight
steiner_tree = M S T ({S U T k})
Output steiner_tree and min_weight

 

2.4 Pruning Steiner node subsets

Because the time complexity of Algorithm 1 depends on the number of
calls made to the MST routine, we can reduce its runtime by checking
beforehand if a call to that procedure cannot lead to a solution of lower
cost than current_mst_weight. We propose a lower bound on the weight
of the MST, and we add checks in every for loop in Algorithm 1 to test
whether the lower bound is higher than the minimum weight MST gen-
erated so far. If so, then we do not generate the MST.

THEOREM 3. Suppose we would like to build an MST on a graph that has
n nodes, of which nodes 1,. . . ,r might have degree 1 in an MST and
hence be eligible to be its root, while nodes r+ l , . . . ,n are required to
have degree >1 in the MST and hence are not eligible to be its root. By
construction, a Steiner node in the graph must have degree >1 in the
MST because otherwise, its inclusion cannot reduce the weight of the
MST.
Assume, the weight matrix of the graph is

WllWl2Wl3 - - - W1n

W21W22W23 - - - W2n

Wn1 Wn2 Wn3 - - - Wnn
Then,
W(MST(n)) 2 (W1 + W2 + - - - + W") — sup(Wl, W2, ...Wr) . .. (l)

where W( MST ( n j j is the total weight of the MST with n nodes and
W,- = inf(W,-1, W,2 , . . . , W,-(,- _ 1), W,-(,-+1), . . . Wm). Here, for a list L, sup(L) and
inf(L) denote the lowest upper bound and greatest lower bound of L,
respectively.

PROOF. We deﬁne the difference on the right hand side of the inequality
(claim) as Q(n). For each non-root node v, deﬁne p[v] to be the weight of
the edge connecting v to its parent in the MST, and deﬁne p[root] = 0. We
can readily see that p[v] 2 WV. p[v] cannot be smaller than Wv as edges do
not get split in the MST-building process. For a graph with n nodes,
W(MST (11)) = p[l] + p[2] + . . . +p[n]. If we assume node 1 is the root

node, then W(M S T (11)) = p[2] + p[3] + - - - - - - + p[n]. We divide into two
cases depending on the value of sup(Wl, W2, W3 , . . . . . . , Wr).
If sup(Wl, W2, W3 , . . . . . . , Wr) 2 W1, then
Q(n)=W1+W2+W3+ . . . . ..+Wn—W1=W2+W3+ . . . . ..+Wn
Since Wv 5 p[v] for any node v, we have,
Q(n)=W2+W3+ - - - - --+WnSp[2]+P[3]+ - - - - --+P[n]=
W(M S T (11)).
On the other hand, if W’ = sup(Wl, W2, W3 , . . . . . . , Wr) > W1, then,
Q(n)=W1+W2+W3+ . . . . ..+Wn_w’<W2+w3+ . . . . ..+Wn
£112] +P[3] + - - - - - - +P[n] = W(M S T (11))
So, W(MST(n)) 2 (W1 + W2 + - - - - - - + W”) — sup(Wl, W2,. . . , Wr).

Distinguishing between the potential Steiner nodes and the non-Steiner
nodes in (1) makes the claim more complicated, but leads to a direct
simpliﬁcation of the algorithm. Fewer calls to the MST procedure are
made because the lower bound exceeds the current best MST weight more
often.

2.5 Heuristic algorithm for the RSMT problem

We also propose a heuristic method that can ﬁnd a potentially subopti-
mal solution in polynomial time. Our proposed heuristic method uses the

median joining principle of iteratively identifying Steiner nodes (known as
median nodes) that allow one to more parsimoniously link some triplet of
nodes, using the generalized Hanan theorem to enumerate possible me-
dians. The method, described in Algorithm 2, begins by constructing a
minimum spanning network, corresponding to the union of edges in all
minimum spanning trees. It then enumerates triplets of nodes (u, v, W)
such that at least two pairs of each triplet are connected in the network,
followed by enumerating possible median nodes, consisting of combin-
ations of coordinate values of u, v, and W. It then tests whether introdu-
cing the given possible median as a Steiner node reduces the cost of the
minimum spanning tree. If so, then the median node is added. The pro-
cess is continued until no additional cost-saving median node can be
added.

THEOREM 4. The time complexity Of Algorithm 2 is polynomial in the
cardinality of the terminal set.

PROOF. The running time of the heuristic algorithm is dominated by the
number of triples that are considered during the Steiner node inference
process. The maximum number of triples considered for inferring the
Steiner node is  If we are considering d probes, then the maximum
number of Steiner nodes is (3)3‘1, where dis the number of probes. So, the

total running time of the heuristic approach is 0(3dn4logn).

2.6 Experimental procedure

We began statistical analysis with a basic test of imbalance in tree topol-
ogies to determine whether differential evolutionary pressures in primary/
DCIS versus metastatic/IDC environments might be reﬂected in the trees.
To obtain sufﬁcient counts and detect statistically signiﬁcant trends, we
grouped cells into bins by subtrees based on the child of the root from
which each cell traces its ancestry. The root node represents a cell type
with a copy number count of 2 for each gene probe (i.e., a healthy diploid
cell). Direct children of the root are those nodes distinguished by an
increase or decrease of one copy in a single probe. For example, for
four gene probes in the CC case, the copy number proﬁles of the eight
Children Of the root are (1, 2,2,2), (2, 1, 2,2), (2,2, 1,2), (2,2,2, 1),
(3, 2, 2, 2), (2, 3, 2, 2), (2, 2, 3, 2) and (2, 2, 2, 3). We refer to all descendants
of one second level node as a ‘bin’. We counted the total number of cells
in that bin for each of the eight subtrees separately for the 16 pairs of
primary and metastasis samples. The resulting eight-dimensional vectors
for each primary—metastasis pair were compared by a x2 test to test the
null hypothesis of independence between bin counts and primary versus
metastasis labels.

To illustrate the difference between the dynamic views of relationships
among cell types offered by the trees relative to the static snapshot offered
by raw probe counts, we next examined two different measures of the net
mutational bias in the CC and BC trees: one based on imbalance of copy
numbers in cell counts and one on imbalance in tree edges. These statis-
tics provide two different views of the net evolutionary process of muta-
tion and selection. For the cell count data in CC/BC, we aggregated all
16/13 patients’ primary/DCIS and metastasis/IDC information separ-
ately, computing average difference in copy number of individual cells
relative to diploid, excluding the contribution of all-diploid cells. For tree-
based calculation of gene gain/loss, we measured the net gain or loss of
each gene by the number of tree edges showing gain minus those showing
loss over all trees generated by FISHtrees.

We also performed a series of experiments on the use of progression
tree statistics for classiﬁcation tasks related to tumor progression and
prognosis. In each case, we examined the use of tree statistics as features
for prediction methods in comparison with prediction from features de-
rivable solely from raw cell counts. As feature sets, we used:

(1) Fractions of cells in the 8/16 subtrees rooted at children of the
diploid root: We deﬁned tree-based features consisting of 8/16 fea-
tures corresponding to the fraction of cells in each of the subtrees
corresponding to immediate children of the diploid root.

(2) Fractions of edges exhibiting gain or loss of each gene: We used 8/
16 features corresponding to the fraction of total tree edges show-
ing gain or loss of each gene.

(3) Fractions of cells at each level from one to ten in the trees: We used
10 features corresponding to the fraction of cells at each level in the
tree from one to ten. The root (the node representing normal cells)
of the tree is assumed to be located at level one.

Fractional rather than absolute counts are used for each measure, so
that the sum of the values is normalized to be 1 and the test statistics are
not distorted by variability sample-to-sample in the number of cells.
These features were compared with four non-tree-based features:

(1) Mean gain or loss in each gene individually.
(2) Maximum copy number of each gene individually.

(3) Shannon index (Park et al., 2010), an information theoretic meas-
ure. For each gene G, each distinct combination of gene copy
numbers and cellular ploidy represents a species. If p,- denotes the
frequency of species i among all tumors, then the Shannon index H
for G is given by

H = —2Pi10g2(l7i)-
(4) Simpson index (Park et al., 2010), D = 21912.

We further performed simulation tests to evaluate the correctness of
the phylogenetic trees inferred by our algorithm in terms of the under-
lying tumor progression mechanism. Trees were simulated to approxi-
mate true FISH progression trees by expanding from an initial diploid
root node by selecting a Poisson number of children of each node (pos-
sibly with repetition) and expanding each node selected recursively until
the process terminates. To produce trees comparable with the real data,
we reject those with <50 or >120 distinct cell types. Individual cells are
then chosen uniformly from the nodes in this topology until 250 cells are
sampled. Because the true and inferred trees may have different node sets,
we evaluate accuracy by a variant of the weighted matching metric of
(Lin et al., 2012), seeking a maximum matching Of phylogenetic biparti-
tions between true and inferred trees with each bipartition weighted ac-
cording to the fraction of nodes it shares with its paired bipartition in the
other tree. The total agreement in nodes across all bipartitions provides a
fractional accuracy of the inference. Full details of the tree simulation and
scoring protocols are provided in the Supplementary Section S2.

Phylogenetic analysis of multiprobe FISH data

 

3 RESULTS

In this section, we present the results of experiments to evaluate
the utility of tumor phylogeny inference for understanding the
developmental processes of these tumor types. We also explore
the prognostic value of tumor phylogenies by using them to
derive features for classiﬁcation experiments and comparing to
features that do not rely on tree inference. For these experiments,
we built tumor progression trees of the CC and BC data using
the ploidyless heuristic approach to phylogenetic inference
described in Methods.

Figure 1 shows representative examples of tumor progression
trees from the CC dataset. Figure 1A shows a tree inferred from
the primary tumor of patient 1 of the CC dataset. Figure 1B
shows the tree for the paired metastatic sample from patient 1.
The primary stage tree has more nodes and is more balanced and
broader in shape compared with the metastatic stage tree. The
distinct topologies of the trees may indicate the fact that cells
residing in primary and metastatic sites of the tumor face differ-
ent selective pressures. Supplementary Figures S4 and S5 show
examples of trees inferred from a DCIS sample and an IDC
sample of a patient with id 8 of the BC dataset. The complete
set of trees from the CC and BC patients is provided in
Supplementary Section S6.

3.1 Comparison of exact and heuristic algorithms

To evaluate the quality of the solution generated by the heuristic
algorithm, we generated tumor progression trees using both the
exact and the heuristic algorithms. We report a comparative
study of the two algorithms in Supplementary Table S1. For
each example run, we report the number of probes considered,
the total number of terminal nodes in the given dataset and a
comparison of the weights of the RSM Ts generated by the exact
and heuristic approach. The heuristic approach returns an opti-
mal solution about 80% of the time. For the cases where the
heuristic solution is not optimal, the excess weight is very small.
From the runtime comparison of the two approaches, we see that
the heuristic approach returns a solution within ls every time.
The runtime of the exact approach varies from ls to 1966 s.
When the number of probes is higher than 5, the total running
time of the exact approach becomes impractical. The heuristic
algorithm can return a solution in <1 min even when using all
eight probes in the BC dataset (data not shown).

In Supplementary Table S1, we also report the percentage of
total calls to the MST generation routine in Algorithm 1 that are
avoided as a result of the inequality we proposed in Theorem 3.
For 75% of the examples, the lower bound in Inequality (1)
exceeds the current best MST weight >90% of the time. As
most of the entries in Inequality (l) are computed just once
and used throughout, this results in a huge decrease in the run-
time of the exact approach.

3.2 Statistical analyses of tumor phylogenies

3.2.] Cervical cancer primary versus metastatic samples We ﬁrst
examined cervical cancers, looking at paired primary tumor and
metastasis samples. Table l in Figure 2A reports P—values for X2
tests on all 16 pairs of patients. For each patient, the X2 tests
compare two 8-element vectors, one for the primary tumor and

one for the metastasis, in which element i is the number of des-
cendants of the ith child of the root. All P—values in this and
other tests are corrected for multiple testing. In Figure 2A, all 16
P—values are statistically signiﬁcant. The same is true for an
analogous X2 test of DCIS versus IDC in 13 BC patients in
Figure 2B. That these comparisons are signiﬁcant indicates sig-
niﬁcant imbalance between tree geometries of the two tumor
stages. It may suggest that distinct evolutionary pressures act
on growth in the primary tumor versus the metastasis.

There is, however, high variability from patient-to—patient in
the nature of the imbalance. Supplementary Table S2 shows cell
counts for the bins associated with gain of the four genes, with
the largest bin of each tree highlighted. The bin accounting for
Gain of LAMP3 is the most frequent dominant bin in both pri-
mary and metastatic samples. This bin is also the only dominant
bin across multiple pairs of primary and metastatic samples. This
ﬁnding is consistent with the ubiquitous gain of LAMP3 in CC
reported in Wangsa et al. (2009). We also performed X2 tests on
individual bins in each pair of primary and metastasis samples
using 2 x 2 contingency tables. Table 3 in Figure 2C reports the
total number of patients for which each bin representing gene
gains or losses shows signiﬁcant association with tumor stage.
The results suggest a net trend toward LAMP3 and PRKAAI
gains, with again a signiﬁcant difference between primary and
metastasis. We infer from these results that LAMP3 has a dom-
inant role both in initiation and development of different stages
of CC.

Figure 3 shows the results of cell-count and tree-edge-based
analysis of gene gain/loss statistics. Cell counts (Fig. 3A) and
edge counts (Fig. 3B) show similar trends in the gain and loss
of the marker genes except for two cases. In the ﬁrst case, cell
counts show no net gain or loss of PROXI in metastasis, while
edge counts show a gain. The latter result is supported by the
literature (\Nangsa et al., 2009) associating gain of PROXI with
metastasis. Likewise, the two measures suggest opposite trends
with respect to PRKAAI in metastasis, with cell counts suggest-
ing net loss but edge counts net gain. Again, net gain has been
previously associated with progression to metastasis (\Nangsa
et al., 2009). These results suggest that quantifying progression
via evolutionary events, as enabled by the trees, provides a
clearer view of the selective pressure than does quantiﬁcation
by cell counts.

3.2.2 Analysis of breast cancer DCIS versus IDC samples We
performed a comparable statistical analysis on the paired BC
DCIS and IDC samples to understand how the evolutionary
process varies between early stages and late stages of tumor de-
velopment. The BC dataset includes copy number counts for
eight gene probes, yielding 16 potential children of the diploid
root node representing single copy number gain and loss of in-
dividual gene probes. We again treated the subtrees rooted at
each of these 16 children as bins and counted the total number of
cells in each bin for each DCIS and IDC tree. We then performed
a X2 test using the 16 x 2 contingency table deﬁned by each
DCIS/IDC pair. The results of the X2 tests are presented in
Table 2 in Figure 2B. As with the CC data, the table consistently
shows signiﬁcant P—values, which again may indicate differences
in the evolutionary processes at different stages of tumor
development.

Fig. 1. Phylogenetic trees showing progression of (A) primary and (B) metastasis stage cervical cancer in patient 1. The trees are built from single cell-
copy number data using the ploidyless heuristic approach implemented in FISHtrees. Each node in the trees represents a copy number proﬁle of the four
gene probes LAMP3, PROXI, PRKAAI and CCNDI, respectively. Nodes with solid borders represent cells present in the collected sample, while nodes
with dotted borders represent inferred Steiner nodes. Green and red edges model gene gain and gene loss, respectively. The weight value on each edge
connecting two nodes x and y is the rectilinear distance between the states of x and y. The weight on each node describes the fraction of cells in the

sample with the particular copy number proﬁle modeled by that node; Steiner nodes are assigned weight 0

Fig. 3. Increase and decrease in copy number count of LAMP3, PROXI,
PRKAAI and CCNDI (A and B) across 16 CC patients and COX-2,
DBC2, MYC, CCNDI, CDHI, p53, HER-2 and ZNF2I7 (C and D)
genes across 13 BC patients. Copy number count is calculated using (A
and C) average of cell count data and (B and D) net tree edge changes.
The units on the x-axis differ in the two adjacent subﬁgures due to the
different types of data used

We next calculated gain/loss statistics based on raw cell count
data and based on tree edges, as we did with the CC data. We
present the results in Figure panels 3C and D, respectively. The
trends are qualitatively generally consistent between cell count
and tree-based statistics. With two exceptions, oncogenes are
ampliﬁed and tumor suppressor genes lost in DCIS and IDC
by both measures. One exception is the tumor suppressor gene
p53, which shows ampliﬁcation rather than the expected loss
when analyzed by cell count statistics (Fig. 3C) but not with
tree statistics (Fig. 3D). The difference may reﬂect an occasional
ampliﬁcation of p53 concurrent with the rest of chromosome 17
due to aneuploidy. The other exception occurs with respect to the
oncogene ZNF2I7, which shows net gains by both statistics for
DCIS, but loss rather than gain in IDC for tree statistic. The

discrepancy appears to be due to one case, in which 90% of cells
in IDC show ZNF2I7 deletion. This unusual case might be due
to the loss of chromosome 20 (on which ZNF2I7 resides) in the
IDC stage of the tumor for that patient.

3.3 Use of tree statistics for classiﬁcation

A key question in studying mathematical models of tumor pro-
gression is whether an understanding of tumor evolutionary
pathways will lead to improved prognostic or diagnostic capabil-
ities. We performed classiﬁcation experiments on the CC dataset
to understand how features derived from progression trees can
help differentiate samples from different cancer stages. We used
support vector machines (SVM), as implemented in MATLAB,
with leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). The performance
of each classiﬁer was assessed by two measures: (i) Percentage of
samples correctly classiﬁed (Accuracy) and (ii) F measure, which
is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. We performed 500
rounds of bootstrapping and assessed mean Accuracy and F
measure as well as their standard deviations.

3.3.] Classification of cervical cancer samples We performed
experiments exploring the predictive power added by the three
different types of tree-derived features. The three classiﬁcation
experiments on the CC dataset are as follows:

(1) Distinguishing primary from metastatic samples using 16
paired primary and metastatic samples,

(2) Distinguishing primary from metastatic samples using 16
metastasizing and 15 non-metastasizing primary tumor
samples versus 16 metastatic samples, and

(3) Distinguishing 16 primary samples that later metastasized
from 15 primary samples that did not metastasize.

Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure S1 report performance of
the two feature sets for the SVM classiﬁer in terms of mean
accuracy and mean F measure, along with conﬁdence interval
of one standard deviation, respectively. By both measures, tree-
based statistics lead to improved classiﬁcation accuracy in all
experiments. The best accuracy on the three tasks is achieved
using the tree-based level-count features, at 81.91% accuracy
for distinguishing primary tumors from their paired-metastasis
samples, 82.26% for distinguishing all primary tumors (metasta-
sizing and non-metastasizing) from the metastasis samples and
82.58% for distinguishing metastasizing versus non-metastasiz-
ing primary tumors. This result suggests that the qualitative ob-
servation that primary trees appear broader and deeper than
metastatic trees (Fig. l) captures a robust quantitative property
of progression trees distinguishing primary from metastatic sam-
ples. Among the non-tree based features, Simpson index shows
the best classiﬁcation performance, yielding average accuracies
of 76.94, 78.12 and 61.08% on the same tasks. Average and
maximum copy number counts show worse performance in all
three classiﬁcation tasks.

Supplementary Figure S1 shows qualitatively similar perform-
ance by the F measure. The most striking difference between the
two measures is a much worse performance for the edge count
and cell count measures at distinguishing primary from meta-
static trees when assessed by F-measure. Bin count and tree
level features show similarly high performance by both measures.

Fig. 4. Accuracy of tree-based versus cell-based features in classiﬁcation
tasks using an SVM classiﬁer. Each chart shows accuracy of three tree-
based and four cell-based feature sets on the three deﬁned prediction
tasks

To follow up on the observation that tree topology seems to be
the most informative feature type, we examined how this feature
varies between primary and metastatic trees. Figure 5 shows the
distribution of the aggregated cell counts across different levels
of 31 primary stage and 16 metastatic stage tumor progression
trees. In the primary stage tumors, ~70% of the cells are dis-
tributed in the ﬁrst six tree levels, and the cell count decreases
gradually when level of the tree is increased. In contrast, for the
progression trees of metastatic stage tumors, the total cell count
shows an exponential decrease with more than half (53%) of the
cells located in the ﬁrst two tree levels This topological difference
could reflect the fact that in the primary stage tumors, the clones
have more time to continue diversifying. An alternative hypoth-
esis is that the difference reflects stronger purifying selection for
clones that must evolve to be able to migrate to and survive
outside their native microenvironment. The BC study was de-
signed to include only patients in whom the diagnosis of IDC
and DCIS was concurrent (Heselmeyer-Haddad et al. 2012),
which has the effect of making the time of evolution for each
sample in a pair comparable, consistent with the hypothesis of
increased purifying selection in IDC. The data here, however, are
insufﬁcient to reject either hypothesis.

3.3.2 Informative feature selection We applied feature selection
to identify the most informative features. We exhaustively enum-
erated subsets of features and tested the cross-validated predict-
ive accuracy of each. Figure 6 shows, for each classiﬁcation
experiment and feature type, the optimal SVM prediction accur-
acy over all subsets. For the most challenging task, distinguishing
metastasizing from non-metastasizing samples based on the pri-
mary sample, accuracy peaks at 72% for Bin Counts, 87.1% for
Edge Counts and 77.4% for Tree Level topological features.
Interestingly, the best performance over all tests at identifying
metastasizing tumors (87.1% accuracy) comes from the Edge
Count features, despite poorer performance of Edge Count in
most tasks. Among the Bin Count features, LAMP3 was an in-
formative feature in all three tasks, reinforcing our statistical
result that LAMP3 is an important gene in CC progression.

In previous work on the same classiﬁcation task, Wangsa et al.
reported sensitivity and speciﬁcity of 0.75 and 0.87 respectively,
with composite FISH markers using percentages of cells with

ampliﬁed signals for each individual marker, on the CC dataset,
but this was done without LOOCV (\Nangsa et al., 2009). The
optimal feature set identiﬁed here improved substantially on the
robustness and sensitivity of that result while keeping equal
speciﬁcity.

We performed similar classiﬁcation experiments for inform-
ative feature selection on the BC data to distinguish DCIS
from IDC samples. When we used all the features for classifying
the DCIS samples from IDC, Bin Count and Edge Count meas-
ures showed 50% accuracy and Tree Level topological features
showed 57% accuracy. Figure 6A shows that feature selection
improved accuracy to 80.7% for both Bin Count and Tree Level
feature subsets. The poor performance while using all features
might be owing to the high intra- or inter-tumor heterogeneity
(Heselmeyer—Haddad et al., 2012).

When we selected the most informative subsets, the feature
sets for BC DCIS versus IDC samples classiﬁcation (Fig. 6B)
differed depending on whether the Bin Count or the Edge
Count measure was considered, although both agreed on the
selection of M YC. M YC was reported in Heselmeyer-Haddad
et al. (2012) to be a prognostic marker in the progression of
DCIS to IDC. Deletion of CDHI was also reported in
Heselmeyer—Haddad et al. (2012), and was selected here in the
Edge Count case.

3.4 Simulation results

Because we cannot know the ground truth for real data with
certainty, we used simulated trees to test accuracy of tree infer-
ences. Comparison over 50 simulated trees shows a mean

accuracy of 92% with standard deviation 2.13% in correctly
inferring tree topologies. Supplementary Figures S2 and S3 pro-
vide more detailed results on the 50 simulated cases individually,
showing consistently high accuracy. There is, however, a slight
bias toward underestimating the true tree weight, as one would
expect for a parsimony measure.

4 CONCLUSIONS

We developed exact and heuristic algorithms for building tumor
progression trees using copy number information and applied our
methods to two different types of cancer. To reduce the complex-
ity of the exact algorithm, we further developed an inequality that
can prune up to 99% of the solution space, resulting in substantial
reduction in the runtime of the algorithm. The heuristic approach
returns potentially sub-optimal solutions in reasonable time for
datasets with large numbers of probes. These algorithms have
been implemented in a publicly available C++ software package,
FISHtrees. Copy number changes can evolve using additional
basic operations such as changing the entire ploidy by l or dou-
bling, and FISHtrees includes an implementation of another
method that allows these ‘operations’ (Pennington, et al., 2007).
Analyses of statistics developed using different features of the
tumor progression trees identify some important recurring mar-
kers of tumor progression and highlight the different selective
pressures at work on different stages of the tumor. Use of tree
statistics as features for classiﬁcation further illustrates the im-
portance of models of the evolutionary process to predicting
future progression, a problem of importance to cancer treatment
and diagnosis. Further improvements in tree algorithms, analysis
of even larger and more complex datasets, and investigation of the
resulting trees can be expected to yield further insight into both
recurring features of tumor evolution and the ways in which these
features vary patient-by-patient.

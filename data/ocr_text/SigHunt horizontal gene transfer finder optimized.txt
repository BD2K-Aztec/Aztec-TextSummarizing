ABSTRACT

Motivation: Genomic islands (Gls) are DNA fragments incorporated
into a genome through horizontal gene transfer (also called lateral
gene transfer), often with functions novel for a given organism. While
methods for their detection are well researched in prokaryotes, the
complexity of eukaryotic genomes makes direct utilization of these
methods unreliable, and so labour-intensive phylogenetic searches
are used instead.

Results: We present a surrogate method that investigates nucleotide
base composition of the DNA sequence in a eukaryotic genome and
identifies putative Gls. We calculate a genomic signature as a vector of
tetranucleotide (4-mer) frequencies using a sliding window approach.
Extending the neighbourhood of the sliding window, we establish a
local kernel density estimate of the 4-mer frequency. We score the
number of 4-mer frequencies in the sliding window that deviate from
the credibility interval of their local genomic density using a newly
developed discrete interval accumulative score (DIAS). To further im-
prove the effectiveness of DIAS, we select informative 4-mers in a
range of organisms using the tetranucleotide quality score developed
herein. We show that the SigHunt method is computationally efficient
and able to detect Gls in eukaryotic genomes that represent non-
ameliorated integration. Thus, it is suited to scanning for change in
organisms with different DNA composition.

1 INTRODUCTION

Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) occurs when a DNA sequence
passes between organisms otherwise than by reproductive des-
cent. It results in a relationship of orthologous sequences that is
not tree-like and contains reticulations. Notorious examples in-
clude antibiotic resistance plasmids transferred between bacterial
strains (Freeman, 1951), pathogenicity islands (Friesen et al.,
2006), incorporation of retroviruses (Jern and Cofﬁn, 2008)
and artiﬁcial HGT in the forms of genetically modiﬁed organ-
isms WVolfenbarger and Phifer, 2000). When a horizontally
transferred gene becomes ﬁxed in a population, it is termed a

genomic island (GI). Relatively frequent HGT occurs between
organisms of similar complexity, such as between prokaryotes,
but successful HGT between domains and kingdoms is also
known. Incorporation of the alien sequence into a recipient
genome must be compatible with survival of the cell; it should
not, for example, knock out an essential gene. In eukaryotes,
distortion of the open reading frame with HGT is less likely
due to the sparseness of coding sequences; yet alien genes face
molecular biological limitations relating to metabolism in the
recipient organism. When genes are transferred from prokary-
otes to eukaryotes, the genetic code difference might hinder cor-
rect protein translation. In cases of HGT between eukaryotes,
incorrect intron splicing would render the gene product altered
and potentially dysfunctional. Nevertheless, successful imple-
mentation of HGT in a suitable place within the genome could
result in expression of the relevant protein. Proteins encoded in a
GI that could be expressed in the recipient organism might pro-
vide a novel, highly adaptive function (Casacuberta and Gonzlez,
2013; Schénknecht et al., 2013). To ﬁnd such a GI is to discover
exciting information that is often transformative for the given
research ﬁeld.

HGT detection is well studied in prokaryotes, having started
from measuring variability of oligonucleotide frequency along
the genome (Karlin and Burge, 1995). Eukaryotic genomes, how-
ever, are comparatively heterogeneous in their composition and
much more extensive. That situation complicates the HGT
search. Therefore, those methods developed for prokaryotes
fail either due to their inability to handle the sequence hetero-
geneity or because their computational requirements skyrocket.
Researchers studying HGT in eukaryotes use two types of meth-
ods: surrogate and comparative. Surrogate methods use nucleo-
tide base composition of the DNA sequence. They have been
applied in the form of chaos game representation clustering
based on tetranucleotide composition (Mallet et al., 2010).
Comparative methods are computationally intensive because
they compute phylogenetic comparisons between large numbers
of identiﬁed genes or they use local alignment comparisons
against a reference sequence database. They require prior anno-
tation of a genome, an extensive database of comparable
orthologues and computationally intensive phylogenetic ana-
lyses. Despite these limitations, the results from comparative
methods are considered most reliable, as they enable identiﬁca-
tion of HGT and the donor organism in the form of testable
hypotheses. Therefore, methods have been developed to reduce
the candidate dataset for GIs while balancing the numbers of
false positives and false negatives (B00 and Makarenkov, 2011;

Mallet et al., 2010; Podell and Gaasterland, 2007). To date, the
effort in eukaryotic genomes has been demonstrated consistently
to fail on these criteria due to the genome heterogeneity in eu-
karyotes (Mallet et al., 2010), thus leading to the need for an
expanding reference database for comparative analyses.

We show here, however, that genome complexity may be over-
come by carefully examining the pattern of genomic signature
along a sequence. We use both the selection of tetranucleotides
with greatest interspeciﬁc variability in their frequencies and
local composition shifts that take into account natural variation
of tetranucleotide frequency changes along a chromosomal arm
to locate regions that differ and might thus represent recent ac-
quisitions via HGT.

2 ALGORITHM
2.1 Calculation of 4-mer sliding density

The principle of the SigHunt (genomic signature hunter) method
is to use a sliding window approach both to detect the HGT and
to take into account DNA sequence composition change along
chromosomes. The genomic signature is calculated as a fre-
quency vector of tetranucleotides (4—mer) within the window of
a genomic sequence. Within each sliding window, frequency of
every 4—mer is calculated as

Cm(S)

Fm(S)=NS_3

where Fm(S) is the frequency of the 4—mer m within a sequence in
the sliding window (S), Cm(S) is the count of m in S and N S is the
length of the sequence in the window S. Only fully resolved sites
are counted towards Fm(S). Tetranucleotides that contain an un-
resolved base are omitted. Unresolved sites are skipped, and the
length of the window, but not the length of the sequence, is
increased by the given number of nucleotides until it reaches
20% of the window size. This is the maximum extension of the
window. There are two reasons for choosing oligonucleotide
length. First, 4—mers provide a vector with a number of dimen-
sions sufﬁcient for complex comparisons. Second, the 4—mers
frequency vector is representative even for relatively short sliding
windows, which is of interest in cases when short alien genes
could be expected.

Along a chromosomal sequence, DNA base composition
changes with functional regions, such as coding and non-
coding regions, repetitive elements, telomeres, centromeres or
other structural elements that stabilize a chromosomal arm.
Differences between repetitive and coding regions in particular
are prone to variable frequency of a few 4—mers that could either
distort or inform a signal from alien fragments. To account for
this, we develop a novel scoring system and introduce a sliding-
density concept. This takes into account genomic regions D that
are directly adjacent to the sliding window S, offset at the 5’ and
3’ ends of the sequence. Within the long sliding window of D, we
calculate a kernel density estimate for each 4—mer. The measured
4—mer frequency in the short sliding window of sequence S is
tested for whether or not it is located outside of the credibility
interval (CI) of the 4—mer density in D

we<w<§>>u<¢sl<v§>n>

where (DD is a cumulative distribution function of Fm(S) in D and
at is a conﬁdence level. Values found to be outside of the CI are
scored in three intervals for at e {0.05, 0.025,0.01}, adding 1, 2
and 3, respectively, to the discrete interval accumulative score
(DIAS). To avoid autocorrelation in measuring Fm(S) on D, D
is selected in such a way that S and a speciﬁed number of its
surrounding sliding windows (x) are excluded from the 4—mer
density calculation (eye-of—the-storm approach). Thus, we com-
pare the S sequence to its context but not to its immediate sur-
roundings. To compare the sliding window approach to previous
genome-wide signature studies, we also show global 4—mer
density.

DIAS measures how many 4—mers deviate in their frequency
from the local background of the genomic sequence and by how
much. While this is more stable along a chromosome than any
other compositional measure known to us, it is nevertheless sen-
sitive to local changes.

2.2 Selection of informative 4—mers

To further improve computational speed of the SigHunt method,
informative 4—mers can be selected to reduce the signal-to-noise
ratio. Multiple genomes are used to train the procedure for 4—mer
selection based on their intra- and inter-genomic variability.
Fm(S) values for all consecutive windows are used to calculate
the 4—mer density in a given chromosome. All chromosomes are
used for the training genomes. Informative 4—mers are selected as
those where means of Fm in organisms are distinctive from the
overall estimates and within-genome Fm variance is small. We
score the 4—mers using the tetranucleotide quality score (TES) for
each 4—mer

chromosomes in all organisms within the dataset, 0 denotes re-
spective variances and e is the estimated organism intended for
the SigHunt search.

Using TES, we are interested to learn the extent to which
4—mer frequencies vary between organisms with respect to their
variability within a genome. To achieve this, K estimates average
frequency of a 4—mer that is found in the given organism. It is
calculated as a mean of means to avoid weighting of the value
according to the number and size of chromosomes. A sums

squared differences between each typical 4—mer frequency on a
chromosome compared with the whole genome; B similarly pen-
alizes 4—mers that have deviant frequency variance in a chromo-
some compared with the background genome. By including the
D component into the equation, we ensure that the frequency
variance in an organism is small to facilitate ﬁnding and inter-
preting 4—mer frequencies outside of the conﬁdence interval of
their density. E provides a measure that would stress usefulness
of the given 4—mer for discrimination of the home sequence. TES
increases where 4—mer frequencies differ between organisms, they
are stable for a given organism and they exhibit little variation
within a genome. We demonstrate below that 4—mers with high
TES scores will be informative in recognizing putative HGT. GIs
identiﬁed with SigHunt should subsequently be veriﬁed using
comparative methods (Fig. 1).

3 METHODS

The sensitivity and speciﬁcity of the SigHunt method was tested using a
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve on simulated data. We
introduced alien sequences into the recipient sequence by randomly se-
lecting and replacing DNA fragments between 10 organisms with com-
plete genomic sequences. Eukaryotes were represented by the fungi
Aspergillus fumigatus (Nierman et al., 2005), Encephalitozoon cuniculi
(Katinka et al., 2001) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Goffeau et al.,
1996); the red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae (Matsuzaki et al., 2004);
the chromalveolates Cryptosporidium parvum (Abrahamsen et al., 2004),
Plasmodium falciparum (Hall et al., 2002) and Thalassiosira pseudonana
(Armbrust et al., 2004); and an animal, Drosophila melanogaster (Adams
et al., 2000). SigHunt’s performance in prokaryotes was demonstrated in
Buchnera sp. (Shigenobu et al., 2000) and Escherichia coli (Welch et al.,
2002). In each of 500 replicates of the procedure, we replaced three gen-
omic fragments with alien DNA from other organisms. The length of
each introduced fragment was 2, 5 and 15 kb in each chromosome,
where the origin of each fragment was randomly drawn from the pool
of analysed organisms and chromosomes. We scored the sequence ac-
cording to DLAS for 5kb windows and lkb sliding windows. Those
regions with known alien sequences were scored as the only GIs present.
We calculated the area under the curve (AUC) from the ROC curve in R

and estimated the optimal threshold while maximizing AUC. The same
analysis was conducted using INDeGeNIUS, which is a recent surrogate
method that uses oligonucleotide frequencies (Shrivastava et al., 2010),
and with Alien_Hunter, which uses interpolated variable order motifs of
DNA composition (V ernikos and Parkhill, 2006).

3.1 Case studies

To test the SigHunt method on real biological data, we used genomic
sequences of Aspergillus, Cryptosporidium and Saccharomyces, as listed
above, and added genomic sequences not yet assembled to chromosomes
for organisms with known GIs. The latter were the red algae Galdieria
sulphuraria, wherein the horizontally transferred genes provide multiple
environmental adaptations (Schénknecht et al., 2013), and the fungus
Pyrenophora tritici—repentis, which recently acquired a pathogenicity
island (Friesen et al., 2006) and had additional proteins originating
from HGT (Sun et al., 2013). We used organisms where GIs had been
identiﬁed previously and their location was speciﬁc in the available gen-
omic sequence mall et al., 2005; Huang et al., 2004; Mallet et al., 2010;
Schénknecht et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2013). Contigs at least 200kb
were used from these organisms. This enabled us to cross-check
SigHunt against previous studies and thereby to demonstrate its utility.
The optimal threshold value for the DLAS as tested with ROC on simu-
lated data was 6.04, and we relaxed this value further to account for
sequence amelioration. The cut-off value used here was DLAS Z 5. Two
windows adjacent to the previously identiﬁed GI were assessed to com-
pensate for the fact that most GIs were identiﬁed as a coding gene se-
quence and the transferred region could likely include ﬂanking regions
(Friesen et al., 2006).

4 RESULTS

We estimated 4—mer density and its variance in the 10 reference
genomes. Comparing the 4—mers using TES, we selected the 16
most informative 4—mers. These were used for all subsequent
analyses.

4.1 Sensitivity and speciﬁcity of SigHunt

SigHunt showed average AUC values equal to 0.77 for global
density, 0.72 for sliding density and 0.77 for the eye-of—the—storm
approach, meaning that sensitivity and speciﬁcity of detecting
GIs in simulated data were high (Table 1). We assigned a GI
only where it had been artiﬁcially introduced, and the remaining
home sequence still contained its natural GIs, which were disre-
garded for the purpose of this test (Table 2). This could have
lowered the performance indicators. The analyses of individual
chromosomes required 8—60 min to calculate DIAS for all three
approaches presented here. INDeGeNIUS and Alien_Hunter
performed in a similar way with respect to their ability to cor-
rectly score the introduced GIs, and no differences between the
methods were signiﬁcant. INDeGeNIUS showed the highest
values of AUC from the tested methods. However, those ana-
lyses took 20 min—20h per chromosome, and Drosophila could
not be analysed due to extensive memory requirements. The
speed of Alien_Hunter was 20—120 min per chromosome.

4.2 HGT detection with SigHunt

We estimated that the studied genomes exhibit regions with
deviant genomic signature that could be considered alien.
These provide a genome-wide assessment of candidate regions

for HGT. We searched for consistency of speciﬁc sequences in
Aspergillus, Saccharomyces, Pyrenophora, Galdieria and
Cryptosporidium between SigHunt and published results.
Compared with the extent of HGT identiﬁed in previous studies
that used predominantly comparative methods on annotated
genes, SigHunt found from 30% (Cryptosporidium) to 80%
(Aspergillus) of previously identiﬁed GIs (Table 2). In
Aspergillus, we were able to ﬁnd the majority of published GIs
as per Mallet et al. (2010), which can be expected given that those
authors used a surrogate method veriﬁed with phylogenetic com-
parison to localize GIs. We identiﬁed 5 of 10 putative GIs recog-
nized in Saccharomyces by Hall et al. (2005). The missed GIs
were protein-coding genes <1.2 kb, for which our chosen window
size might not be optimal. In Pyrenophora, we searched for 17

genes and 6 were retrieved by SigHunt. HGT in Galdieria can be
attributed to ~9% of the genomic sequence in the longest scaf-
folds, which we analysed (Schénknecht et al., 2013). SigHunt was
able to recognize the genomic signatures of the published GIs as
being alien in 61% of the cases. In Cryptosporidium, we found 9
of 30 previously identiﬁed GIs (Huang et al., 2004). As in pre-
vious cases with low success, the GIs in Cryptosporidium that
were missed consisted predominantly of short genes. In
these cases, experimentation with window size would be bene-
ﬁcial. INDeGeNIUS found more known GIs in Aspergillus,
Pyrenophora and Cryptosporidium, but the analyses took an
order of magnitude longer than in SigHunt. SigHunt outper-
formed Alien_Hunter in recognizing the previously established
HGT events in most tested organisms. The exception

was Cryptosporidium, where Alien_Hunter found 11 of 30
GIs (Table 2).

5 DISCUSSION

We present here a tool for identifying genomic regions as candi-
dates for HGT assessment in eukaryotes. To our knowledge, this
is the ﬁrst surrogate method primarily optimized for eukaryotic
genomes. It detects non-ameliorated HGT in large genomic se-
quences, it is computationally efﬁcient and its implementation
provides step-wise user access to results that enables data explor-
ation and analytical optimization.

We demonstrated good success in using SigHunt to ﬁnd intro-
duced GIs across kingdoms and GIs in real genomic sequences
(particularly in some fungi). Considering from a biological per-
spective reproduction within this group, HGT might be more
common in fungi than in other eukaryotes (Rosewich and
Kistler, 2000). With HGT events being relatively common
within the group, one could speculate that some of these will
be non-ameliorated and thus easily detectable using surrogate
methods. The further example of Galdieria, within which GIs
were plentiful across the genome, seems to corroborate this.

5.1 SigHunt’s advantages

The advantage of SigHunt lies in its utilization of informative
4—mers. Selecting only parts of the genomic signature that are
most informative according to TES reduces noise in the data
and computational requirements, thereby speeding up the ana-
lysis. Computational demands are not negligible in eukaryotic
genomics. For example, INDeGeNIUS analysis of the largest
chromosome in Drosophila would require W70 TB of memory,
which is beyond the capacity available to many researchers,
including our group, and the current version of the program
does not allow for changes in memory use. By contrast,
SigHunt analysed the same problem using 900 MB of maximum
allocated memory. At a given time, SigHunt stores in memory
only that chromosome sequence needed to calculate the signa-
tures, or, once the corresponding signatures are calculated and
the chromosome sequence deleted from memory, the signatures
and densities themselves. Such orderly memory utilization re-
duces the memory requirements and thus allows computations
of even large datasets on regular ofﬁce computers.

Contrary to other recent methods that use a genomic signature
for HGT detection (Elhai et al., 2012; Shrivastava et al., 2010;
but see Mallet et al., 2010), SigHunt does not assume a point
estimate of the genomic signature. Instead, it uses a density dis-
tribution and thus acknowledges the natural variability of DNA
composition and distinguishes only those regions that deviate
from the broad ‘norm’ for an organism. We recognize that the
density distributions must contain tails even for home signatures.
Due to this, DIAS measures accumulations of deviant 4—mer
frequencies rather than their mere occurrence. With sliding dens-
ity and its eye-of—the—storm variant that avoids autocorrelation,
SigHunt is able to ﬁnd putative GIs in any region of the chromo-
some. This includes regions rich in repetitive DNA because
SigHunt assumes a differing genomic signature typical for a gen-
omic region rather than for the whole chromosome.

SigHunt makes it unnecessary to have knowledge as to the
exact position on a chromosome of the examined sequence
(Podell and Gaasterland, 2007). It can successfully analyse unas-
sembled genomes, provided that the supercontigs are sufﬁciently
long. It also does not require information about gene locations.
By ﬁltering nucleotide positions in a sequence that are not fully
resolved, we limit the amount of information while increasing the
accuracy. In case of a long eukaryotic genome, a trade-off in
favour of accuracy is paramount for SigHunt.

5.2 SigHunt’s disadvantages

Unfortunately, SigHunt is not a universal black box solution for
all HGT problems. Its very principle denies universality, as it
rises and falls on the assumption that there are differences in
oligonucleotide frequencies between organisms (Karlin and
Burge, 1995). This is not always sufﬁciently true, as shown by
our analyses on manipulated and real data. Some random islands
were undifferentiated from the home signature. For others, the
GI size in real datasets might have been too small to accurately
estimate the 4—mer frequency density for the DIAS calculation. In
addition to reasons of there being similar genomic signatures
among the organisms involved, SigHunt is prone to false nega-
tives due to amelioration over time of the compositional bias in
the horizontally transferred region compared with the host
genome. The false-positive rate might also be increased. In re-
gions with strong selection bias and functional restrictions, home
signature might vary locally. The extent to which this is the case
remains to be tested.

SigHunt expands the search for GIs across the genome with-
out annotation limitations, yet it is able to guide the comparative
search more effectively than do other similar methods. We have
shown that SigHunt provides a fair basis of target regions for
comparative assessment that consists of true GIs as conﬁrmed by
phylogenetic analyses in the published data (F riesen et al., 2006;
Hall et al., 2005; Huang et al., 2004; Mallet et al., 2010;
Sch6nknecht et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2013).

5.3 Global density paradox

We claim that the advantage of SigHunt lies in its ability to
account for variation of the genomic signature along a chromo-
somal sequence. Yet, in Table 1, the sensitivity and speciﬁcity test
shows the highest (albeit not statistically signiﬁcant) AUC values
to be for the global density estimate in six cases. This is probably
caused by the fact that we introduced HGT directly between
organisms that spanned kingdoms and our islands were thus
devoid of any amelioration. In other words, while one would
rarely encounter such an event in practice, it is one that is rela-
tively easy to capture by means of genomic signatures. Analysing
real biological data would require a more subtle approach.
Therefore, both the sliding density and its eye-of—the—storm vari-
ant provide room for ﬁne-tuning the method. These are para-
meterized for window size, sliding window size, sliding-density
window size, and eye-of—the-storm size. All these parameters

5.4 Usefulness of SigHunt

As a method for investigating genomic signature in complex eu-
karyotic genomes, SigHunt can provide a rapid analysis tool for
ongoing sequencing projects. In particular, it will be sensitive to
recent HGT, such as in cases of emergent pathogens that have
acquired novel genes. The choice of informative 4—mers could
increase resolution and success for binning of metagenomic
DNA fragments (Saeed and Halgamuge, 2009). With the
recent ﬁnding of bacterial horizontally transferred genes in
human tumour cells (Riley et al., 2013), SigHunt shows promise
to be used in rapid screening of such events in genomic assem-
blies of speciﬁc cell lines. We assume that further research will
reveal more ﬁelds within which sliding density of DNA compos-
ition in eukaryotic genomes and the selection of informative
oligonucleotides will prove advantageous.

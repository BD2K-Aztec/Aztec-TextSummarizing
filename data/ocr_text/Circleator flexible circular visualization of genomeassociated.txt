ABSTRACT

Summary: Circleator is a Perl application that generates circular
figures of genome-associated data. It leverages BioPerl to support
standard annotation and sequence file formats and produces publica-
tion-quality SVG output. It is designed to be both flexible and easy
to use. It includes a library of circular track types and predefined
configuration files for common use-cases, including. (i) visualizing
gene annotation and DNA sequence data from a GenBank flat file,
(ii) displaying patterns of gene conservation in related microbial strains,
(iii) showing Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and indels rela-
tive to a reference genome and gene set and (iv) viewing RNA-Seq
plots.

Availability and implementation: Circleator is freely available under
the Artistic License 2.0 from http://jonathancrabtree.github.io/
Circleator/ and is integrated with the CloVR cloud-based sequence
analysis Virtual Machine (VM), which can be downloaded from
http://clovr.org or run on Amazon EC2.

1 INTRODUCTION

There are numerous circular genome visualization tools, with
varying degrees of interactivity, usability and utility. They
differ in the data types and formats they accept, the types of
output they produce and the ease of customizing the mapping
from input data to graphical display. Flexibility and ease-of—use
are frequently at odds, with the most ﬂexible tools often being
the hardest to customize, particularly for non-programmers. To
address this issue, Circleator provides multiple conﬁguration
options, allowing each user to choose the one that best suits
his/her needs.

Similar tools include GenomePlot (Gibson and Smith, 2003), a
Perl/Tk application and DNAPlotter (Carver et al., 2008), a Java
application, both of which have graphical user interfaces and

also support linear displays. GenoMap (Sato and Ehira, 2003)
is a Tcl/Tk microarray data viewer, and the GeneWiz browser
(Hallin et al., 2009) is an interactive Java applet. Some combine
analysis and visualization: BRIG (Alikhan et al., 2011) incorp-
orates a BLAST-based prokaryotic genome comparison algo-
rithm, and CGView Server (Grant and Stothard, 2008) is a
CGView-based (Stothard and Wishart, 2005) web service that
runs on-the-ﬁy BLAST comparisons. At the other extreme,
some tools display only predeﬁned datasets: The Microbial
Genome Viewer (Kerkhoven et al., 2004) and Genome
Projector (Arakawa et al., 2009) are web-based tools in this
category.

GenomeDiagram (Pritchard et al., 2006) supports linear and
circular displays, but requires Python programming expertise.
Circos (Krzywinski et al., 2009) is a popular and powerful
stand-alone tool but its use of complex hierarchical conﬁguration
ﬁles may put it out of reach of some users. The D3.js toolkit
(Bostock et al., 2011) has a Circos-like ‘chord diagram’, but does
not, to our knowledge, accept standard bioinformatic ﬁle
formats. Circster (Goecks et al., 2013), which uses D3.js, adds
circular drawing capabilities to Galaxy.

Circleator follows the computer design principle of making the
common case fast: if a researcher has data in a standard format
and needs a routine visualization then he/she should not have to
reformat the data or experiment with parameter values.
Conversely, with sufﬁcient time, it should be possible to create
novel and intricately detailed ﬁgures. Circleator users who wish
to accomplish the former can choose a predeﬁned conﬁguration
ﬁle, whereas those seeking more ﬂexibility can write their own.
Circleator’s conﬁguration ﬁle format supports several novel
high-level abstractions (e.g. loops, symbolic track references,
feature-based coordinate scaling) and reuses existing standards
e.g. SVG, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), where possible.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

Circleator is a stand-alone Perl application that has also been incorpo-
rated into CloVR (Angiuoli et al., 2011). It uses BioPerl (Stajich et al.,
2002) for internal data representation and produces SVG (Dahlstrbm
et al., 2011) output, from which PDF, PNG and J PEG may be generated.

2.1 Input data

Circleator accepts reference sequence(s) and annotation in any BioPerl—
supported format, including GenBank format; Sequence Alignment/Map
and BGZF-compressed SAM (SAM/BAM) alignment ﬁles; output from
Cufﬂinks (Trapnell et al., 2010), Tandem Repeats Finder (TRF) (Benson,
1999) and the BLAST Score Ratio (Rasko et al., 2005) utility; SNPs in
Variant Call Format (V CF) and tab-delimited quantitative data, such as
gene expression data.

2.2 Features

Circleator outputs SVG natively, rather than using a graphics library that
supports only a subset of SVG. It can draw text along circular paths and
display semitransparent and overlapping tracks. The scale may vary
around the circle, as in Circos, but also along the radius of the circle
(i.e. a single ﬁgure may combine both global context and local detail,
as in Fig. 1B). Regions to scale may be selected with a user-deﬁned ﬁlter,
e.g. to magnify by 100x all SNP loci at which more than half of the
genomes differ from the reference without having to explicitly list the
relevant coordinate spans.

2.3 Conﬁguration

Each line in the manually editable Circleator conﬁguration ﬁle corres-
ponds to a circular track. The conﬁguration ﬁle supports loops, which
allow the same set of tracks to be displayed for 80 genomes in a SNP
comparison without repeating everything 80 times; pseudo-tracks,
which do not appear in the ﬁgure but can load data or perform data
transformations (e.g. the compute-deserts track, which identiﬁes all re-
gions of a speciﬁed length that do not contain any features of a speciﬁed

type); track references, which allow tracks to reference each other
by name, e.g. highlight each of the SNP deserts identiﬁed in track
SD1 in red; and various feature ﬁlters, e.g. to draw only forward-
strand genes whose gene product ﬁeld contains the keyword ‘kinase’.
Circleator supports the following conﬁguration options, listed in order
of increasing ﬂexibility and decreasing ease-of—use: (i) reuse a predeﬁned
conﬁguration ﬁle as is; (ii) customize a predeﬁned conﬁguration ﬁle; (iii)
write a new conﬁguration ﬁle using the predeﬁned track types and (iv)
deﬁne new track types, glyphs and/or ﬁlters.

2.4 Documentation and test suite

The predeﬁned conﬁguration ﬁles and track types are well documented,
and the HTML track documentation is automatically generated from the
same Circleator conﬁguration ﬁle that deﬁnes them. Circleator also has a
set of regression tests that help to verify the correctness of the images it
produces.

3 CONCLUSIONS

Circleator is a visualization tool that leverages BioPerl and
SVG to produce publication-ready circular ﬁgures of genome-
associated data. It is highly conﬁgurable but includes predeﬁned
conﬁguration ﬁles and a library of well-documented circular
track types that allows users to create complex ﬁgures without
programming expertise.

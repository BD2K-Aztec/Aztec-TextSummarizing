Abstract

ASSIST (Automatic SNP Scoring Tool) is a user-friendly customized pipeline for efficient calling
and filtering of SNPS from Illumina lnfinium arrays, specifically devised for custom genotyping
arrays. Illumina haS developed an integrated software for SNP data visualization and inspection
called GenomeStudio® (GS). ASSIST builds on GS-derived data and identifies those markerS that
follow a bi-allelic genetic model and show reliable genotype calls. Moreover, ASSIST re-editS SNP
calls with null alleleS or additional SNPS in the probe annealing Site. ASSIST can be employed in
the analySiS of different population typeS such aS full-Sib familieS and mating schemes used in the
plant kingdom (backcross, F1, F2), and unrelated individuals. The final result can be directly ex-
ported in the format required by the most common software for genetic mapping and marker—trait
association analySiS. ASSIST iS developed in Python and runS in Windows and Linux.

1 Introduction

Advances in whole genome genotyping technologies enabled the in-
vestigation of several hundred thousand SNP markers simultan-
eously on a genome-wide scale. To date, Illumina (GoldenGate®
and Infinium®) and Affimetrix (Axiom®) are the most widely used
array-based genotyping platforms worldwide. Illumina has de-
veloped GenomeStudio®, a proprietary software with a graphical
user interface (GUI) for SNP data visualization and filtering that en-
ables the selection of high-quality markers showing robust perform-
ance across the examined germplasm. However, the actual filtering
of such SNPs requires a deep understanding of the performance of

SNP markers, genetic segregation patterns and familiarity with the
many tools and parameters in GenomeStudio® (GS). ASSIsT ac-
counts for this by offering a user friendly, automated pipeline that
builds on the results of Illumina’s GenCall algorithm (Kermani,
2006) as incorporated in GS.

In addition to filtering, ASSIsT also re-edits GS-calls in order to
better explore the available information for SNPs showing null al-
leles or additional SNP clusters® due to additional polymorphisms
at the probe annealing site. This re-editing enhances correct SNP
calling and reduces unnecessary removal of potentially valuable
markers.

2 Methods

The analysis and selection of SNPs performed by ASSisT is based on
the calls produced by Illumina’s GenCall algorithm (Kermani,
2006). A two tiers approach that employs a bi-allelic genetic model,
and then a tri-allelic model is used to classify SNPs on the basis of
their real performance on examined germplasm. The tri-allelic
model is used to describe more complex segregation patterns due to
null-alleles or alleles with variable signal intensity due to additional
SNP, as the bi-allelic genetic model used by GS cannot account for
such polymorphisms (Bassil et al., 2015; Gardner et al., 2014;
Pikunova et al., 2014; Troggio et al., 2013). In this case, ASSIsT
may re-edit GS-calls by applying de novo filters using the original
light intensity data and the segregation patterns in the germplasm.

3 Results

ASSIsT supports the analyses of different population types, such as
full-sib families (e.g. human, livestock, cross pollinating plants),
mating schemes common in plants (backcross, F1, F2) and individu-
als with unknown genetic relationships. ASSIsT’s GUI allows easy
parameter setting and provides a visual output of the SNP clustering
analysis. The results produced by ASSIsT can be directly exported to
the input format of the most widely used software for genetic and
marker-trait association analysis (FlerTLTM, GAPIT, JoinMap,
PLINK, Structure and Tassel). This straightforward integration will
improve marker performance in association and QTL mapping stud-
ies. ASSIsT is developed in Python (www.python.org). Its source
code is released under the GNU General Public Licence (GNU-
GPLv3) to allow its integration into bioinformatic pipelines.

ASSIsT requires three input files: a pedigree file in which the
parents of each sample are reported and two standard report files
from GS (Final Report and DNA Report). The two GS reports are
standard output of commercial service companies; therefore, ASSIsT
does not necessarily require access to GS. A map file with the genetic
or physical position of the markers may also be included. This infor-
mation is mandatory for exporting results in Structure or PLINK
formats.

ASSIsT allows pre-selection of the stringency of the filtering pro-
cedure by customizing the following parameters: (1) Proportion
of missing data, (2) Call Rate threshold, (3) Segregation distortion
(X2 P-value), (4) Frequency of not allowed genotypes (structured
germplasm) and (5) Minor Allele Frequency.

The first step of the filtering analysis is a quality check of the
individuals; samples with a high proportion of unexpected marker
genotypes due to outcrossing, different ploidy levels and DNA
admixture, among other causes, are considered deviating germplasm
and further excluded from the analysis. Samples with poor DNA
quality (call rate significantly lower than the average of the dataset)
will not be considered in the analysis either. All discarded samples
are listed in the ‘summary’ output file.

Only ‘robust’ markers (i.e. those showing a clear cluster separa-
tion and few No Calls) are allowed through the initial filtering.
These markers can show two (one homozygous and one heterozy-
gous) or three clusters (two homozygous and one heterozygous). For
some markers, the AB cluster might result in two distinct sub-
clusters, due to additional SNPs at the probe site, which may lead to
differential hybridization efficiency and to distinct classes of signal
intensity within a marker allele. The variation in signal intensity,
generally ignored by GS, is considered by ASSisT instead. For
instance, a cross between two heterozygous parents generates three
genotype clusters at a single locus (e.g. CT >< CT produces

1/4CC+1/2CT+1/4TT). When one allele (let us say T) shows two
distinct intensity classes, it may be interpreted as Q” X Ct, which
gives 1/4CC+ 1/4CT+ 1/4Ct+ 1/4Tt. The discernment between the
two heterozygous classes (CT and Ct) makes this marker fully infor-
mative in inheritance studies, where as ‘classical’ heterozygotes are
not informative in the generation of genetic linkage maps as it is not
possible to determine the parental origin of the alleles. Additional
SNPs in the probe, as well as INDELS (Pikunova et al., 2014), may
also give rise to null alleles, due to the lack of signal in one of the
DNA templates, which results in additional clusters. GS cannot cur-
rently account for this scenario; thus, informative markers are lost.
Conversely, ASSIsT succeeds in the analysis of the majority of such
markers (A0 >< A0, A0 X 00 and A0 X B0), allowing a more efficient
marker calling.

All the above-mentioned SNP classes are suitable for the genera-
tion of genetic linkage maps or for marker—trait association studies.
Discarded markers are grouped according to their performance con-
sidering absence of or severe distortion in segregation, presence of not
allowed genotypes in segregating families and number of No Calls.

ASSIsT has been used to analyze SNP markers of several bi-
parental full-sib families and germplasm of apple (Bianco et al.,
2014), peach, melon and grape. For each family, ~99% of the
‘approved’ (those that passed the filtering procedure) SNPs showed
to have high-quality data as they integrated smoothly in the genera-
tion of high-quality genetic linkage maps. The remaining 1% pre-
sented several types of issues, largely related to the presence of
paralog loci where the AB cluster was too close or even merged to
one of the two homozygous clusters.

ASSIsT thus proved to be an effective tool for genotyping studies
as it allows to easily filter informative and well-performing SNP and
to recover potentially useful SNPs from indels or regions of high-
sequence divergence, feeding them directly to the most common
downstream analysis tools through its easy interface.

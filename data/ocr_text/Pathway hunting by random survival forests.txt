ABSTRACT

Motivation: Pathway or gene set analysis has been widely applied to
genomic data. Many current pathway testing methods use univariate
test statistics calculated from individual genomic markers, which
ignores the correlations and interactions between candidate markers.
Random forests-based pathway analysis is a promising approach for
incorporating complex correlation and interaction patterns, but one
limitation of previous approaches is that pathways have been con-
sidered separately, thus pathway cross-talk information was not
considered.

Results: In this article, we develop a new pathway hunting algorithm
for survival outcomes using random survival forests, which prioritize
important pathways by accounting for gene correlation and genomic
interactions. We show that the proposed method performs favourably
compared with five popular pathway testing methods using both syn-
thetic and real data. We find that the proposed methodology provides
an efficient and powerful pathway modelling framework for
high-dimensional genomic data.

1 INTRODUCTION

High-throughput genomic technologies, such as gene expression
microarrays, single nucleotide polymorphism arrays and
next-generation sequencing have revolutionized biological and
medical research by making it possible to measure thousands
to millions of biomarkers across the genome simultaneously.
However, detecting meaningful signals and making appropriate
inferences from these massive datasets remains challenging be-
cause of the high dimensionality and complex correlation and
interactions that are at play.

To reduce dimensionality, and to increase statistical test
power, pathway (or gene set) analysis has become increasingly
popular. Instead of applying statistical tests to one gene at a
time, pathway analysis takes advantages of previous biological
knowledge and examines the gene expression patterns of a group
of related genes (e. g. grouped by biological functions) for their
associations with disease outcomes. Since the well-known gene
set enrichment analysis (GSEA) method (Mootha et al., 2003;

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Subramanian et al., 2005) was published, a number of pathway
analysis approaches have been developed, including parametric
analysis of gene set enrichment (Kim and Volsky, 2005), aver-
aged t—statistic gene set scores (Tian et al., 2005), the maxmean
statistic for improved GSEA (Efron and Tibshirani, 2007), the
random-sets method (Newton et al., 2007), mixed-effects models
WVang et al., 2008, 2009) and principal components (Chen et al.,
2008; Tomfohr et al., 2005). Web-based pathway tools, such as
DAVID (Huang et al., 2009), GeneTrail (Backes et al., 2007) and
the online GSEA interface at the Broad Institute, are also widely
used.

Although pathway analyses are designed to test effects from
multiple genes in place of single genes, typically they rely on test
statistics based on simple summary statistics (e. g. the mean) of
individual genes that ignore correlation between genes, and more
importantly, gene—gene interactions. Recent genomic studies
have demonstrated the importance of gene—gene interactions
and gene networks for complex diseases (Cordell, 2009;
Horvath et al., 2006; Moore and Williams, 2009; Schadt et al.,
2008) that are not being addressed with these methods.

One recent pathway analysis method for modelling gene—gene
relationships makes use of random forests (RF) (Breiman, 2001)
by constructing RF for genes in each pathway and ranking path-
ways based on prediction accuracy. This method automatically
incorporates two-way or high-order genes interactions effects
with marginal association patterns (Pang et al., 2006, 2010).

However, a limitation of these RF pathway approaches is that
they ignore genes outside of the targeted pathway. Complex dis-
eases often result from multiple pathway disturbances and inter-
actions. A well known example is the Ras pathway, which
activates multiple signalling pathways to drive uncontrolled pro-
liferation in cancer (McCormick, 1999). Therefore, a single path-
way may not fully explain phenotype variations in complex
diseases. Goeman and Buhlmann (2007) discussed the need to
include genes outside the gene sets for pathway testing, and they
indicated these should be dependent on biological hypothesis.
The ideal solution is to combine all available candidate pathway
gene expression data together for RF modelling. However, ﬁnd-
ing a reliable gene importance measure for ultra-high-dimen—
sional genomic data and resolving the computational issues in
RF are challenging.

In this article, we propose a new pathway hunting algorithm
for survival outcomes using random survival forests (RSF)
(Ishwaran et al., 2008) that prioritize important pathways by
accounting for transcriptome—wise gene correlations and inter-
actions. In Section 2, we describe the RSF framework, a minimal
depth measure of variable importance, our pathway hunting

algorithm and a testing procedure for pathway analysis. In
Section 3.1, we show that our method performs favourably com-
pared with ﬁve popular pathway testing methods using a simu-
lation study. We illustrate the pathway hunting approach in
Sections 3.2 and 3.3 using two microarray survival datasets
involving colon cancer and ovarian cancer. Section 4 presents a
summary discussion.

2 METHODS

2.1 Random survival forests

RF (Breiman, 2001) is a non-parametric ensemble tree learning method
that has become increasingly popular for genetic and gene expression
data analyses (Diaz-Uriarte and de Andres, 2006; Lunetta et al., 2004;
Pang et al., 2006). An RF ensemble comprises randomly grown recur-
sively partitioned binary trees. Each tree is grown from an independent
bootstrap sample. Trees are generally grown deeply, and during the tree
growing process, each node is split using a randomly selected subset of
variables. These features enable RF to reduce both bias and variance.

RSF is a new extension of RF to right-censored survival data settings
(Ishwaran et al., 2008). RSF possesses similar properties to RF. It is a
data adaptive procedure able to model non-linear effects and complex
interactions among features. These properties make it an attractive tool
for the analysis of complex survival data. RSF has been successfully
applied to cancer staging and integrative genomic modelling (Chen
et al., 2010; Ishwaran et al., 2009; Weichselbaum et al., 2008).

In this article, RSF models were constructed using the following four
steps:

(1) A total of ntree independent bootstrap samples are drawn. Each
bootstrap sample excludes on average 36.8% of the original data,
called out-of-bag (OOB) data. For each bootstrap sample, a single
random survival tree is grown.

(2) When growing the tree, at each tree node, mtry variables are randomly
selected. A maximum of nsplit split-points are chosen randomly
for each of the mtry variables. The node is split by ﬁnding the vari-
able that maximizes the log-rank test across its nsplit randomly
selected split points (in our examples, we used nsplit equal to 10).

(3) Each survival tree is grown to full size under the constraint that the
minimum number of unique event times in a node is no smaller
than the integer nodesize.

(4) The forest ensemble is the tree-averaged cumulative hazard func-
tion. The predicted value mortality is deﬁned as the forest cumu-
lative hazard function summed over the event times.

All RSF models in this article were calculated using the R-package
randomSurvivalForest. Default settings for the software were used except
for nsplit, which was set to 10 (as stated earlier in the text).

2.2 Minimal depth

A useful feature of RF is that it provides a rapidly computable internal
measure of variable importance (VIMP) that can be used for ranking
features. To calculate VIMP for a variable, the given variable is randomly
permuted in the DOB data, and the permuted OOB data are dropped
down the tree. OOB prediction error is then calculated. The difference
between this estimate and the OOB error without permutation (i.e. from
the original tree), averaged over all trees, is the VIMP of the variable. The
larger the VIMP of a variable, the more predictive the variable (Breiman,
2001). VIMP has been widely used to rank predictors in microarray ex-
pression and genetic association data analysis.

Recently, Ishwaran et al. (2010) described a new high-dimensional
variable selection method based on a tree concept referred to as minimal

depth which measures the importance of a variable in terms of its splitting
behaviour relative to the root node. This avoids directly working with
prediction error and is non-randomized, which makes it possible to pro-
vide a theoretical basis for selecting variables (something that is not avail-
able with VIMP). The minimal depth of a variable v is the depth at which
the variable ﬁrst splits within a tree, relative to the root node. The smaller
the minimal depth, the more predictive the variable.

Denote the minimal depth for a variable v by Dv. In high-dimensional
sparse settings under the assumption that v is noisy (i.e. is unrelated to the
outcome), it was shown (Ishwaran et al., 2010) that for 0 5 d 5 D(T) — 1,
where D(T) is the depth of the tree T,

1 ed d—l 1 e,-
IP{Dv=d|£o,...,£Dm}=[1—(1——) ]1‘[(1——), (1)
p ,2, p

where Ed equals the number of non-terminal nodes at depth d and 1)
equals the number of features.

Minimal depth selection selects a variable v if its tree-averaged minimal
depth is less than or equal to the mean of D, under the distribution (1).
Although Equation (1) is conditional on the tree-node values Ed, which
are unknown, in practice, Ed is estimated using forest averaged values.
This makes minimal depth selection easily and rapidly computable in
practice. The performance of minimal depth variable selection was sys-
tematically compared with VIMP in Ishwaran et al. (2011). The results
repeatedly demonstrated superiority to VIMP. Thus, we use minimal
depth to measure importance of a gene in this article.

2.3 Pathway hunting

Although minimal depth is reliable in moderately high-dimensional
settings, it is still difﬁcult to obtain accurate measurements in ultra-
high-dimensional scenarios (Ishwaran et al., 2010). To overcome this
dimensionality problem, we propose a minimal depth pathway hunting
approach adapted from the variable hunting method of Ishwaran et al.
(2010). The algorithm consists of the following steps:

(1) Split the data into training and test sets (we used 80 and 20%,
respectively).

(2) Select P genes randomly from all available genes 1). The default
setting is P: p/5 when P< 1000, otherwise P: 1000.

(3) Fit a survival forest, IF, to the training data using P genes.

(4) Determine the minimal depth for each of the P genes.

(5) Calculate the test set prediction error of [F using the test data.
(6) Repeat step 1—5 B times.

(7) Determine the average minimal depth for each of the 1) genes from
the B RF.

(8) Compute the pathway minimal depth by averaging the minimal
depth of all genes within the given pathway. The smaller the aver-
aged pathway minimal depth measure, the more important the
pathway.

The algorithm breaks the ultra-high-dimensional feature space into
more manageable subspaces to better estimate the minimal depth for
each gene. The number of replicates B generally needs to be large
enough to fully span all genes. In this article, we set B = 200 for all ana-
lyses. A pathway-ranked list of genes can be obtained using the ordered
pathway level minimal depth values.

2.4 Pathway signiﬁcant testing

For signiﬁcance testing of pathways, permutation tests that permute
sample labels are often used. However, this approach is too computation-
ally extensive with RSF, as it requires that the entire pathway hunting
steps be repeated for each permutation sample. Instead, we shall adopt
the random-set enrichment scoring framework (Newton et al., 2007) to

analyse pathway minimal depth. Speciﬁcally, for a given pathway with m
genes, we calculate its entire set of gene minimal depth values
G = {D1, D2, . . . , Dm}. We deﬁne the enrichment score for the pathway
to be A7 = ZveG Dv/m. We test the null hypothesis that A7 is not different
from the mean of a random set of m distinct genes drawn randomly from
a total ofp genes representing the genome background. When 1) is large,
the distribution of minimal depth is approximately Gaussian. Applying
the 6 method, we obtain

M = [E(X) ZEZDV

az=var®=2<a>l<25m>12:41-

The null hypothesis can be tested by comparing the standardized path-
way minimal depth enrichment score Z = (117 — ,u)/a to a standard
normal distribution. Small values of Z indicate a pathway enriched
with predictive genes.

3.1 Simulation studies

We use simulation studies to assess the effectiveness of the RSF
pathway hunting method for identifying pathways with gene—
gene interactions. We compare our method with several well-
known pathway analysis methods. We focus on a pathway
cross-talk simulation, as it poses a difﬁcult scenario for standard
pathway approaches.

We set n = 250 for the sample size and P = 500 for the number
of genes. For each observation, expression values for the p genes
(x1, . . . ,xp)T were generated from a multivariate normal distri-
bution with mean zero and autoregressive correlation structure
corr(x,-,xk) = ,o'H‘I for two genes i and k. The 500 genes were
divided into 50 pathways with 10 genes each. The survival time
of each sample was generated based on six randomly selected
causal genes (x1, ..., x6) from an exponential distribution with
mean

[L = exp[—ﬁ(x1x4 + xzxs + x3x6)] (2)

where the coefﬁcient was set at ,6 = 8. Censoring times were
drawn independently from an exponential distribution with
mean ,11, the average of ,u. over the samples.

To simulate pathways associated with the survival outcomes,
we designed two scenarios. In the ﬁrst scenario, there was one
disease associated pathway and three of the six causal genes
(x1,x2,x3) were randomly selected from the 10 genes in
Pathway 1, and genes (x4,x5,x6) were randomly selected from
the remaining 490 genes. Under this simulation set-up,
Pathway 1 was the only disease associated pathway. Note,
genes x4,x5,x6 were disease associated genes, but not located
within the causal pathway (i.e. Pathway 1).

In the second scenario, there were two causal pathways that
included disease associated genes. Genes (x1,x2,x3) were again
randomly selected from Pathway 1, whereas genes (x4,x5,x6)
were randomly selected from another single pathway, which
was drawn randomly from the remaining 49 pathways. Both
pathways were considered as disease associated pathways in
this case. In each of two cases aforementioned, the correlation

parameter ,0 was 0.5, 0.7 and 0.9. We repeated each of the six
simulation scenarios 100 times independently.

We compared the performance of our RSF pathway hunting
approach to ﬁve other pathway testing methods. These included
(i) the random-set method (Newton et al., 2007) implemented in
the R-package allez; (ii) Fisher’s exact test, where the threshold
for classifying signiﬁcant genes was set at a nominal P-value of
0.05 obtained from univariate Cox regression modelling of a
gene; (iii) GSEA (Subramanian et al., 2005) implemented using
the javaGSEA program available from the Broad Institute at
http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/downloads.jsp; (iv) the max-
mean test (Efron and Tibshirani, 2007) implemented in the
R-package GSA; and (v) the RSF pathway approach
Pwayrfsurvival of Pang et al. (2010) based on single pathways.

In the ﬁrst scenario, there was one disease associated pathway
in each simulation dataset (or repetition); therefore, there
were 100 (= 1 x 100 repetitions) pathways associated with the
survival outcome and 49 x 100:4900 control pathways. In
the second scenario, there were two disease associated pathways
in each simulation dataset; therefore, there were 200
(= 2 x 100 repetitions) survival outcome associated pathways
and 4800 (= 48 x 100) control pathways. In each scenario, the
P-values obtained for these 5000 pathways were then used to
compute the receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curves.
These show the trade-off between sensitivity and speciﬁcity as
the threshold for declaring a signiﬁcant pathway varies. To com-
pare the overall discriminative abilities of the methods over all
possible cut-offs, we calculated the area under the ROC curve
(AUC). Table 1 records the AUC under all six simulation scen-
arios. We ﬁnd that our RSF method (denoted simply as RSF)
signiﬁcantly outperforms all other methods. Figure 1 displays the
ROC curves of all six methods for scenario 2 of Table 1. RSF
sensitivity is better across all levels of speciﬁcities.

We also performed another simulation study based on a real
gene expression dataset, GSE17538 (with 250 patients), pulled
from the NCBI GEO database. Three BioCarta and KEGG
pathways with sizes 10, 21 and 43 were selected as the causal
pathways for comparison. These were chosen as all had similar
pairwise gene correlations (~0.17; see the Supplementary
Material). Then 37 pathways were randomly chosen as back-
ground pathways. The number of genes for all 40 pathways
was 987. We designed the following three simulations. Genes
(x1,x2,x3) were randomly selected from 10 genes in Pathway 1,
and genes (x4,x5,x6) were randomly selected from the remaining
977 genes. These represent the x—variables in the simulation.
Then survival times and censoring status for the x—variables
were generated as in Equation (2) with ,6 = 15. A similar proced-
ure was applied to Pathways 2 and 3, with the number of causal
genes set to 12 and 26, where half of them were from the causal
pathway and the rest were from other genes. Each simulation
was repeated 100 times. The AUC values from the simulation
results are shown in Table 2. Once again, the RSF pathway
hunting method has the best performance.

3.2 Colon cancer data

For our next example, we applied the RSF pathway hunting
method to a colon cancer gene expression data (Smith et al.,
2010). The data were from 223 colorectal adenocarcinoma

This ﬁgure shows the ROC curves for simulation scenario 2 of Table 1

patients from the Vanderbilt Medical Center and Mofﬁtt Cancer
Center. All patients had disease-free survival outcomes. The gene
expression data comprise 54 675 probes based on Affymetrix
HGU133 plus 2.0 expression chip. The data are available from
the NCBI GEO database (accession no. GSE17538). A collection
of 403 pathways, including 186 KEGG pathways (www.genome.
jp/kegg) and 217 BioCarta pathways (www.biocarta.com), were
used for the analysis.

For each pathway, we calculated a nominal P-value based on
our pathway hunting method, as well as an adjusted P-value
controlled using the false discovery rate (FDR) (Benjamini
and Hochberg, 1995). Table 3 lists the top pathways controlled
at a 0.2 FDR threshold. For comparison, the data were also
analysed using the previous ﬁve methods (see Supplementary
Material). It is interesting that several of the listed pathways,
including extracellular matrix (ECM) receptor interaction,
focal adhesion and the transforming growth factor-beta
(TGF-,6) signalling, were also ranked as top pathways by the
comparison methods. For GSEA and GSA, the smallest adjusted
P-values were 0.311 and 0.423, respectively. The top path-
ways identiﬁed by random-set were those related to central ner-
vous system degenerative disorders, such as Parkinson and
Alzheimer’s disease.

The P53 pathway, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
pathway and TGF-,B signalling pathway listed in Table 3 are
well-known to be involved in cancer development and metastasis.
The most signiﬁcant pathway identiﬁed by RSF is the peroxi-
some-proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signalling pathway.
PPARs are ligand-activated transcription factors that belong to
the nuclear-hormone—receptor family, and the PPARs family is
composed of three isotypes, including PPARa, PPARﬁ/S and
PPARy. The association between activation of PPARy and the
growth and differentiation of colon cancer has been shown in
different experimental models (Gupta et al., 2004; Sarraf et al.,
1998; Yang and Frucht, 2001). The PPAR signalling pathway is
closely linked with other top pathways in carcinogenesis. For
example, the adipocytokine signalling pathway and the leptin
pathway are key mediators in adipose tissue for inﬂammation
and immune response. It has been shown that the increased in-
cidence of colon cancer with a high-fat diet could be caused by
activation of PPARy by fatty acids WVasan et al., 1997). The
level of PPARa and PPARy can be controlled by adiponectin
and leptin, which are two adipocytokines (Qian et al., 1998;
Yamauchi et al., 2003). Suppression of the TGF-,6 signalling
pathway is regulated by PPARy (Lee et al., 2008). It has been
suggested that p53 mediates the PPARy ligand-induced apop-
tosis (Nagamine et al., 2003). There is evidence suggesting that
PPARﬁ/S and PPARy mediate VEGF induction in colorectal
tumour (Rohrl et al., 2011).

This analysis suggests that the PPAR signalling pathway is not
only associated with survival in colon cancer patients, but that it
may also play a hub-role in connecting with other important
pathways. PPARy agonists, such as thiazolidinediones, have
been discovered to have anticancer effects for multiple cancer
types (Michalik et al., 2004; Ondrey, 2009).

3.3 Ovarian cancer data

As another example, we applied RSF pathway hunting to an
ovarian cancer gene expression dataset (Bonome et al., 2008).
The analysis was based on tumour tissues obtained from 185
stage III and IV ovarian cancer patients using Affymetrix
HGU133A expression chip with 22 823 probes (GEO accession
no. GSE26712). We used the same 403 KEGG and BioCarta
pathways as in the colon cancer data analysis. Table 4 lists path-
ways meeting an FDR threshold of 0.1 from our RSF method.

ancer effect of chemotherapy and slow tumour metastasis

sic (cytoplasmic) and intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathways are
apoptosis signal transduction pathways in cancer cells and are
targets of variety of anticancer chemotherapies (F ulda and
Debatin, 2006). In contrast, GSA and Fisher’s exact test did
not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant pathways associated with survival out-
comes (see the Supplementary Material).

The most interesting ﬁndings were the top two pathways:
ECM receptor interaction and focal adhesion, which were also
among our top pathways from the colon cancer analysis. Focal
adhesions are macromolecules that mediate the regulatory effects
of ECM, which connects cells within most tissues. Signalling
between cells and ECM is essential for cell migration, prolifer-
ation and survival. Cross-talk between tumour cells and the
microenvironment of the local host is critical for development
of tumours (Liotta and Kohn, 2001). Knowledge and control of
the microenvironment become more important for understand-
ing the mechanism of carcinogenesis and developing effective
chemotherapy (Albini and Sporn, 2007).

The importance of the ECM pathway agrees well with another
recent study. To increase power for detecting pathway-level per-
turbations, Krupp et al. (2011) conducted a large-scale gene ex-
pression meta-study that combined 649 tumour samples from
>1400 experiments and 58 tumour types. Even though there
were only 39 ovarian cancer samples and no colon cancer sam-
ples in this combined dataset, ECM receptor interaction and
PPAR signalling pathway were signiﬁcantly enriched and con-
served across tumour types.

The important genes within each pathway can be screened
using minimal depth. For the ECM receptor interaction path-
way, the minimal depth of all genes within the pathway from
both colon cancer and ovarian cancer is plotted in Figure 2. The
overlapping genes from the ﬁrst quartile of each data are labelled
with their gene symbols. These genes can be further evaluated
and used as biomarkers for metastasis risk prediction in multiple
cancer types.

4 DISCUSSION

Complex diseases are generally the consequences of interactions
from multiple genes and pathways. Although pathway enrich-
ment and association testing approaches have been developed,
because of computational and statistical modelling challenges,
the information from gene—gene interactions are either ignored
or restricted to within an individual pathway.

In this article, we presented a novel RSF pathway hunting
method for identifying and ranking the importance of pathways
for their association with survival outcome. The proposed
method is based on a new measure of variable importance,
termed minimal depth, which has been shown to be an efﬁcient
and effective method for variable selection in high dimensions
(Ishwaran et al., 2010, 2011). Our RSF pathway hunting ap-
proach is capable of capturing both marginal gene effects and
gene—gene interactions at the genome level, and it approximates
the complexity of the transcriptome by taking advantage of
a priori biological knowledge.

In our simulation studies, we speciﬁcally designed scenarios
where censored survival outcomes were associated with gene
interactions and pathway cross-talk. The RSF approach

outperformed standard well-known procedures. In our real data
analyses involving colon and ovarian cancer, RSF identiﬁed key
pathways. These ﬁndings indicate that the RSF pathway hunting
algorithm can identify essential cancer signalling pathways with a
relatively small sample size.

In summary, we have described a new method to model com-
plex gene—gene interactions and multiple interactions between
pathways, integrated within a traditional pathway analysis
framework. It can be further extended to model different pheno-
types, such as categorical or continuous outcomes. This new ap-
proach helps to expand the scope of current pathway analysis to
understand the complexities underlying diseases.

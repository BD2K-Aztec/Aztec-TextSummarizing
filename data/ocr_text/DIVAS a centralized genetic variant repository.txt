Abstract

Motivation: A plethora of sequenced and genotyped disease cohorts is available to the biomedical
research community, spread across many portals and represented in various formats.

Results: We have gathered several large studies, including GERA and GRU, and computed popula—
tion— and disease—specific genetic variant frequencies. In total, our portal provides fast access to
genetic variants observed in 84 928 individuals from 39 disease populations. We also include
66 335 controls, such as the 1000 Genomes and Scripps Wellderly.

Conclusion: Combining multiple studies helps validate disease—associated variants in each under—
lying data set, detect potential false positives using frequencies of control populations, and identify
novel candidate disease—causing alterations in known or suspected genes.

1 Introduction

DNA sequencing and genotyping data from populations of various
demographic backgrounds are becoming available to the biomedical
research community at an ever increasing pace. Individually,
targeted studies have provided insights into the genetic underpin-
nings of diseases or confirm previously identified causal alterations:
for congenital heart disease (Turki et 61]., 2014), coloboma (Rainger
et 61]., 2014), schizophrenia (Rees et 61]., 2014) and numerous others.

The power to discover novel, disease—causing or protective alleles
potentially becomes even larger when combining data from different
studies, thereby increasing the number of controls and cases for
related phenotypes, and helping adjust for the mutational spectrum
for individuals of diverse ethnic backgrounds. Projects such as the
1000 Genomes Project (1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2012)
or the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (www.evs.gs.washington.
edu/EVS/) included large cohorts from various ethnicities, and have

been frequently used as a control population for filtering out poten—
tial benign variants observed in a disease cohort. However, few
efforts compile the information from multiple large cohorts into a
centralized portal to obtain the distribution of variants observed
across multiple studies.

The first two large portals providing joint access to several
sequencing studies went live earlier this year: the Exome
Aggregation Consortium (EXAC, 2015) (www.exac.broadinstitute.
org) and the European Variation Archive (EVA, 2015) (www.ebi.ac.
uk/eval). EXAC compiled summarized variant information from
more than 63 000 exomes by normalizing data from individual stud—
ies through an identical pipeline. EVA provides a query interface for
obtaining summarized variant information from several large stud—
ies. Although both portals provide variant frequencies observed in
numerous control cohorts of multiple ethnic groups, they do not in—
clude disease—specific variant frequencies from pure disease cohorts,

which can be a positive indication that a variant may be a candidate
for causing the disease.

We have compiled a centralized genetic variant repository
(Disease Variant Store, DIVAS) that includes genotype data from
eight large—scale studies, including 1000 Genomes, ExAC, dbGaP
GRU, GERA (Hoffmann et al., 2011) and UK10K ALSPAC/T WINS
(see Supplementary Information), consisting of 150 000 individuals
from seven ethnic groups. Among this population, 84 928 individ—
uals were annotated with 39 disease phenotypes, and 66 335 as con—
trol cohorts. We have computed the disease—specific, ethnicity—
specific and control variant frequencies as well as genotype frequen—
cies for all observed variants, and then visualized these summarized
information through a public web interface. The broad spectrum of
disease phenotypes and ethnic groups in DIVAS make it a simple
and comprehensive tool to validate known pathogenic variants, or
facilitate in the discovery of novel disease—causing variants.

2 Usage

The DIVAS web interface provides several ways to query for vari—
ants, including genes and coordinates. Results are presented in a
table including information on effects from sanff, variant frequen-
cies observed in selected DIVAS cohorts, predicted functional im-
pact (such as SIFT, MutationAssessor) and known disease
associations from ClinVar, OMIM, SwissVar and HGMD (the latter
with restricted access). Once the results are shown in tabular format,
users can select one of those four annotation categories from the
dropdown in the upper left. The frequencies of each variant are gen—
erated dynamically through bar charts. The bar charts were imple—
mented in D3.js and thus allow the user to filter the frequencies by
population, or to sort the frequencies based on various criteria (con—
ditioned on disease/control and population).

One immediate use of DIVAS is to validate known disease vari—
ant associations in public databases such as ClinVar. For instance,
the variant GATA4:p.Ala346Val (rs115372595) was reported in
Rajagopal et al. (2007) to be observed only in a proband with endo—
cardial cushion defect (ECD); it is annotated as pathogenic in
ClinVar. In DIVAS, we observe that this variant has a frequency
more than 2-fold higher in a congenital heart defect population than
in any other disease and control cohort (Fig. 1). This observation is
consistent with the original study that this variant may contribute to
the risk of ECD. We provided other examples in the Supplementary
Material.

We also provide RESTful API access to query DIVAS for allele
frequencies, diseases, effects and predicted functional impacts by

3 Discussion

Combining multiple studies helps to validate disease—associated vari—
ants in each underlying dataset, detect potential false positives using
frequencies of other populations and identify novel candidate dis—
ease—causing alterations in known or suspected genes.

It has to be noted that several datasets represented in DIVAS
do not provide detailed phenotypes. Disease annotations across
different studies are not necessarily compatible; we plan to address
this issue by structuring phenotypes using UMLS or HPO (Kohler
et al., 2014; Thorn et al., 2007). Moreover, some studies are
assumed to be healthy (1000 Genomes) or phenotypes are not
published on an individual level (ExAC). Individuals of the former
group may still develop a disease at a later time point due to a
genetic component.

Since DIVAS variants are derived from a variety of sequencing
and genotyping platforms, some variants are not profiled and miss—
ing data require imputation. Different platforms also impose differ-
ent quality criteria; in DIVAS, we are currently using the quality
metrics and filter criteria provided by each individual study. For that
reason, DIVAS provides allele frequencies before and after filtering
out non—passing sites.

A long—term goal of the service is to integrate the DIVAS infra-
structure with several other large data access portals (for instance,
dbGap and UK10K). This can help prospective data applicants get a
clear idea whether their genes and variants of interest have a fre—
quency distribution in any relevant study supporting their
hypothesis.

4 Implementation

Integrating variants from heterogeneous sources requires left—aligned
normalization on all genetic variants, which in our case was per—
formed using an algorithm proposed by Tan et al. (2015). For vari—
ants containing multiple alternate alleles, we separated each
alternate allele as one unique variant and normalized them inde-
pendently. We have devised a unique, reversible, compressed variant
key to represent all possible single nucleotide variations and dele—
tions using a £15—byte string representation. This representation can
also handle insertions of up to 2958 bases or multi—nucleotide vari—
ations using at most 1000 bytes (see Supplementary Methods).
By indexing variants and disease—variant association databases in
the same way, we are able to quickly retrieve detailed annotations
from ClinVar (Landrum et al., 2014), SwissVar, HGMD
(Stenson et al., 2014), OMIM and dbSNP. We compute gene— and
protein—level annotations using sanff (Cingolani et al., 2012) and
include pre—computed functional predictions from deSFP (Liu
et al., 2013).

For each dataset, we calculated frequencies for the annotated dis—
eases and ethnicities when possible. We then calculated variant fre—
quencies in each subset. We also calculated frequencies exclusively
using variants that have passed the quality control employed by the
original data publisher. Frequency calculation is implemented
using Apache Pig and results were exported to a MySQL database
backing the web query interface. Data visualization is based on
D3.js, enabling the web interface to dynamically render charts of
variant frequencies based on individual filter/sort criteria chosen by
the user.

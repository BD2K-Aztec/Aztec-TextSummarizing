ABSTRACT

Motivation: The number of missense mutations being identified in
cancer genomes has greatly increased as a consequence of techno-
logical advances and the reduced cost of whole-genome/whole—
exome sequencing methods. However, a high proportion of the
amino acid substitutions detected in cancer genomes have little or
no effect on tumour progression (passenger mutations). Therefore,
accurate automated methods capable of discriminating between
driver (cancer-promoting) and passenger mutations are becoming in-
creasingly important. In our previous work, we developed the
Functional Analysis through Hidden Markov Models (FATHMM) soft-
ware and, using a model weighted for inherited disease mutations,
observed improved performances over alternative computational pre-
diction algorithms. Here, we describe an adaptation of our original
algorithm that incorporates a cancer-specific model to potentiate the
functional analysis of driver mutations.

Results: The performance of our algorithm was evaluated using two
separate benchmarks. In our analysis, we observed improved perform-
ances when distinguishing between driver mutations and other germ
line variants (both disease-causing and putatively neutral mutations). In
addition, when discriminating between somatic driver and passenger
mutations, we observed performances comparable with the leading
computational prediction algorithms: SPF-Cancer and TransFlC.

our cancer-specific model, including a downloadable stand-alone
package, is available at http://fathmm.biocompute.org.uk.

1 INTRODUCTION

Human cancers are characterized by the accumulation of somatic
mutations, e. g. gross insertions and deletions, as well as the more
subtle single base pair substitutions (Iengar, 2012), some of
which confer a growth advantage on the tumour cells
(Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011). The Catalogue of Somatic
Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) (Bamford et al., 2004) is an
online repository of somatic mutation data, which includes

amino acid substitutions (AASs). The identiﬁcation of cancer-
promoting AASs (driver mutations) promises to lead to a better
understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the dis-
ease, as well as providing potential diagnostic and therapeutic
markers (Furney et al., 2006). However, this remains a major
challenge, as the majority of AASs detected in cancer genomes
do not contribute to carcinogenesis; rather, these ‘passenger mu-
tations’ are a consequence of tumorigenesis rather than a cause
(Greenman et al., 2007). Therefore, accurate automated compu-
tational prediction algorithms capable of distinguishing between
driver and passenger mutations are of paramount importance.

A review by Thusberg et al. (2011) describes the performance
of several computational prediction algorithms (Adzhubei et al.,
2010; Bao et al., 2005; Bromberg and Rost, 2007; Calabrese
et al., 2009; Capriotti et al., 2006; Li et al., 2009; Ng and
Henikoff, 2001; Mort et al., 2010; Ramensky et al., 2002;
Thomas et al., 2003) using a ‘gold standard’ validation bench-
mark (Sasidharan Nair and Vihinen, 2013). In our previous
work, we developed the Functional Analysis through Hidden
Markov Models (FATHMM) algorithm and, using a model
weighted for inherited disease mutations, observed improved per-
formance accuracies over alternative computational prediction
methods using the same benchmark (Shihab et al., 2013).
However, the value of traditional computational prediction al-
gorithms in cancer genomics remains unclear (Kaminker et al.,
2007a). For example, the shared characteristics between driver
and other disease-causing mutations allow for a signiﬁcant pro-
portion of cancer-associated mutations to be identiﬁed (high-sen-
sitivity/true positive rate); however, these methods are incapable
of reliably distinguishing between driver and other disease-caus-
ing mutations. Furthermore, with respect to carcinogenesis, a
large proportion of passenger mutations are still misclassiﬁed
as having a role in tumour progression (low-speciﬁcity/true nega-
tive rate). As a result, several cancer-speciﬁc computational pre-
diction algorithms capable of distinguishing between driver
mutations and other germ line variants (both disease-causing
and putatively neutral mutations) and/ or capable of discriminat-
ing between somatic driver and passenger mutations have been
developed (Carter et al., 2009; Gonzalez-Perez et al., 2012;
Kaminker et al., 2007b; Reva et al., 2011).

In this work, we describe an adaptation to our original algo-
rithm, which amalgamates sequence conservation within hidden
Markov models (HMMs), representing the alignment of

homologous sequences and conserved protein domains, with
‘pathogenicity weights’, representing the overall tolerance of
the corresponding model to mutations (Shihab et al., 2013), to
potentiate the functional analysis of driver mutations. Using a
model weighted for cancer-associated mutations, we observe per-
formance accuracies, which outperform alternative computa-
tional prediction algorithms (Adzhubei et al., 2010; Capriotti
and Altman, 2011; Ng and Henikoff, 2001; Reva et al., 2011)
when distinguishing between driver and other germ line muta-
tions (both disease-causing and neutral polymorphisms).
Furthermore, when discriminating between driver and passenger
mutations (somatic), we observe performance accuracies com-
parable with other state-of-the-art computational prediction al-
gorithms (Capriotti and Altman, 2011; Carter et al., 2009;
Gonzalez-Perez et al., 2012). A web-based implementation of
our algorithm, including a high-throughput batch submission
facility and a downloadable stand-alone package, is available
at http://fathmm.biocompute. org.uk.

2 METHODS

2.1 The mutation datasets

The mutation datasets used in this study were collected and assembled as
follows: ﬁrst, cancer-associated mutations (germ line and somatic) from
the CanProVar database (Li et al., 2010) (CanProVar—Version 54;
http://bioinfo.vanderbilt.edu/canprovar) and putative neutral poly-
morphisms from the UniProt database (preiler et al., 2004)
(UniProt—November 2011; http://www.uniprot.org/docs/humsavar)
were downloaded and used to calculate our ‘cancer-speciﬁc pathogenicity
weights’. Next, we obtained three mutation datasets (Capriotti and
Altman, 2011) and performed an independent benchmark comparing
the performance of our algorithm with the performance of ﬁve alternative
computational prediction algorithms (Adzhubei et al., 2010; Capriotti
and Altman, 2011; Ng and Henikoff, 2001; Reva et al., 2011). Finally,
we obtained a published benchmark consisting of nine mutation datasets
(Gonzalez-Perez et al., 2012) and compared the performance of our al-
gorithm with the performance of four alternative computational predic-
tion algorithms (Adzhubei et al., 2010; Gonzalez-Perez et al., 2012; Ng
and Henikoff, 2001; Reva et al., 2011). The composition of these datasets
is summarized in Table 1, and the overlap between our training and
benchmarking datasets is illustrated in Supplementary Table S1.

2.2 Scoring cancer-associated amino acid substitutions

Following the procedure described in Shihab et al. (2013): protein domain
annotations from the SUPERFAMILY (Gough et al., 2001) (version
1.75) and Pfam (Sonnhammer et al., 1997) (Pfam-A and Pfam-B; version
26.0) databases are made. Next, the corresponding HMMs are extracted
if the mutation maps onto a match state within the model, and the
domain assignment is deemed to be signiﬁcant (e—value 50.01). Where
multiple HMMs are extracted, then the model with the largest informa-
tion gain (as measured by the Kullback—Leibler divergence (Kullback and
Leibler, 1951) from the SwissProt/TrEMBL amino acid composition) is
used. Finally, we interrogate the amino acid probabilities within the
model and assume that a reduction in the amino acid probabilities
(when comparing the wild-type with the mutant residue) indicates a po-
tential negative impact on protein function. Finally, the predicted mag-
nitude of effect is weighted using cancer-speciﬁc pathogenicity weights
(Supplementary Methods):

(1.0—Pw)-(Wp +1.0)

1“ (1.0 — Pm) - (W, +1.0)

 

(1)

Here, PW and Pm represent the underlying probabilities for the
wild-type and mutant amino acid residues, respectively, and the patho-
genicity weights, WC and WP, represent the relative frequencies of cancer-
associated (CanProVar) and putative neutral polymorphisms
(UniProt) mapping onto the relevant HMMs, respectively. A pseudo-
count of 1.0 is incremented to our pathogenicity weights to avoid zero
divisible terms.

2.3 Extending our algorithm to mutations falling outside
conserved protein domains

The main disadvantage of our original algorithm was conﬁning coverage
(via the weighting scheme used) to protein missense variants falling within
conserved protein domains. To increase coverage, we have developed an
extension to the aforementioned data for predicting the functional effects
of AASs falling outside conserved protein domains. In brief, ab initio
HMMs, representing the alignment of homologous sequences within
the SwissProt/TrEMBL database (preiler et al., 2004), are constructed
using the JackHMMER component of HMMER3 (Eddy, 2009) (one
iteration with the optional—hand parameter applied). The predicted mag-
nitude of effect is then calculated as in Equation (1); however, these
models are weighted with the relative frequencies of cancer-associated
(CanProVar) and putative neutral polymorphisms (UniProt) mapping
onto the top scoring sequence(s), and their homologous domain(s),
being used to construct the model (Supplementary Methods).

2.4 Performance evaluation

As recommended in Vihinen (2012), the performance of our method was
assessed using the following six parameters [Equations (2—7)]:

3 RESULTS

3.1 A cancer-specific prediction threshold

The Capritotti and Altman (2011) benchmark comprises three
mutation datasets: the cancer and neutral only (CNO) mutation
dataset assesses the performance of computational prediction
algorithms when tasked with discriminating between driver mu-
tations and neutral (germ line) polymorphisms; the cancer, neu-
tral and other disease (CND) mutation dataset is used
to evaluate the performance of computational prediction

algorithms when tasked with distinguishing between cancer-
associated and other germ line mutations (both disease-causing
and neutral polymorphisms); and the synthetic mutation dataset
measures the performance of computational prediction algo-
rithms when differentiating between somatic driver and passen-
ger mutations. Therefore, to derive a prediction threshold
capable of being applied under all conditions, we plotted the
distribution of the predicted magnitude of effect for all mutations
in the Capriotti and Altman benchmark using a leave-one-out
cross-validation procedure (Fig. 1). From this, we calculated a
prediction threshold at which the speciﬁcity and sensitivity of our
algorithm were both maximized across the mutation datasets:
—0.75. Using this threshold, we observed that a large proportion
of driver mutations (92%) fell below our prediction threshold,
whereas the vast majority of germ line polymorphisms (disease-
causing/putative neutral mutations) and passenger mutations fell
above our prediction threshold, 94 and 87%, respectively.

3.2 An independent benchmark against other
computational prediction algorithms

Using the Capriotti and Altman (2011) mutation datasets, we
performed an independent benchmark comparing the perform-
ance of our method with the performance of two generic com-
putational prediction algorithms: SIFT (Ng and Henikoff,
2001) and PolyPhen—2 (Adzhubei et al., 2010); alongside two

throughout our analysis.

First, using the cancer and neutral only (CNO) mutation data-
set, we assessed the performance of these algorithms when tasked
with distinguishing between driver mutations and putatively neu-
tral polymorphisms. In addition, using the cancer, neutral and
other disease (CND) mutation dataset, we assessed the perform-
ance of these algorithms when tasked with differentiating be-
tween driver mutations and other disease-causing mutations
(non-neoplasm). From Table 2, and in terms of performance
accuracies, it would seem that our method is the best-performing
algorithm across these mutation datasets (94 and 93%, respect-
ively). Using the synthetic mutation dataset, we assessed the per-
formance of these algorithms when tasked with discriminating

between somatic driver and passenger mutations. Here, our
method outperforms SIFT, PolyPhen—2 and Mutation
Assessor; it is comparable with SPF-Cancer (89 and 90%, re-
spectively). Next, we compared the performance of our domain-
based algorithm with the performance of our novel extension
(capturing regions falling outside of conserved protein domains).
We observed similar performances both within and outside con-
served protein domains and concluded that our extension (and
the corresponding weighting scheme) was just as effective as our
domain-based algorithm when predicting the functional conse-
quences of cancer-associated mutations (Supplementary Table
S2). Finally, we plotted receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curves in the form of cumulative true positive/false positive plots
centred on a conservative 1% error rate (Fig. 2). These curves re-
afﬁrm the comparable performances between our algorithm and

SPF -Cancer. In addition, these curves demonstrate the relatively
poor performances of ‘generic’ computational prediction algo-
rithms, such as SIF T and PolyPhen-2, when applied to predict
the functional consequences of cancer-associated mutations.

As our prediction threshold was derived using the same mu-
tation datasets used in this benchmark (albeit using a leave-one-
out analysis), and a large proportion of driver mutations is also
present in our training data, we recognize the potential for bias
in the observed performances. Therefore, to alleviate this bias,
we further performed a 20-fold cross-validation procedure
(Supplementary Table S3). We observed no signiﬁcant deviations
in the performance measures reported earlier in the text and,
therefore, concluded that the performance of our algorithm is
not an artefact of our weighting scheme.

Finally, to enable a direct (and fair) comparison between our
algorithm and another leading computational prediction algo-
rithm, CHASM (Carter et al., 2009), we performed the same
2-fold cross-validation procedure used in (Capriotti and
Altman, 2011) using the synthetic dataset. Here, we observed
an improved performance when using our algorithm (Table 3).
Furthermore, we observed no signiﬁcant deviations from our
original performance measures reported earlier in the text.

3.3 A performance comparison with a published review

In addition to performing our own benchmark, we downloaded
and used the Gonzalez-Perez et al. (2012) benchmark

(comprising nine mutation datasets) to compare the performance
of our algorithm with four alternative computational prediction
algorithms: SIFT (Ng and Henikoff, 2001), PolyPhen—2
(Adzhubei et al., 2010), Mutation Assessor (Reva et al., 2011)
and TransFIC (Gonzalez-Perez et al., 2012). For this analysis, we
opted to compare our algorithm with the Mutation Assessor
TransFIC, as it has been shown to outperform the SIFT
TransFIC and PolyPhen—2 TransFIC. In accordance with
(Gonzalez-Perez et al., 2012), and to enable a fair comparison
to be made between our algorithm and the Mutation Assessor
TransFIC, we adjusted our prediction thresholds across the nine
mutation datasets to maximize the Matthews correlation coefﬁ-
cient (MCC) of our algorithm. Here, our algorithm outperforms
SIFT, PolyPhen—2 and Mutation Assessor across all mutation
datasets. In addition, it seems our algorithm is comparable
with the Mutation Assessor TransFIC (Table 4). The perform-
ance of our algorithm using our standard prediction threshold is
documented in Supplementary Table S4.

3.4 Beneﬁts of a disease-speciﬁc weighting scheme

To better understand the potential beneﬁts of incorporating a
cancer-speciﬁc weighting scheme into our algorithm, we com-
pared the score/prediction assignments for all mutations in the
Capriotti and Altman (2011) benchmark using a cancer-speciﬁc
weighting scheme with the score/prediction assignments for the
same mutations using our original inherited-disease weighting
scheme. As expected, the odds of identifying driver and passen-
ger mutations were 7.92 (CI: 6.82, 9.22) and 1.95 (CI: 1.69, 2.25)
times greater, respectively, when using a cancer-speciﬁc weight-
ing scheme. Furthermore, the odds of correctly identifying other
disease-causing mutations as having no effect on tumour pro-
gression were 75.48 (CI: 59.70, 96.17) times greater when using a
cancer-speciﬁc weighting scheme. The observed performance
gain illustrates the ability of our algorithm to not only distin-
guish between driver and passenger mutations but also to
discriminate between cancer-associated mutations and other
germ line mutations (both disease-associated and neutral

polymorphisms).

Cancer Missense Functional Prediction

 

4 DISCUSSION

In this article, we described an adaptation to the Functional
Analysis through Hidden Markov Models (FATHMM) algo-
rithm (Shihab et al., 2013) in which a cancer-speciﬁc weighting
scheme was incorporated to potentiate the functional analysis of
driver mutations. The performance of our method was then
benchmarked against four alternative computational prediction
algorithms: SIFT (Ng and Henikoff, 2001) and PolyPhen—2
(Adzhubei et al., 2010), Mutation Assessor (Reva et al., 2011)
and SPF -Cancer (Capriotti and Altman, 2011); using the
Capriotti and Altman (2011) benchmarking datasets. In terms
of performance accuracies, FATHMM seems to be the best per-
forming method available when assigned with the task of distin-
guishing between driver mutations and other germ line
polymorphisms (both disease-causing and neutral).
Furthermore, when tasked with discriminating between driver
and passenger mutations (somatic), our method seems to per-
form as well as the alternative leading prediction algorithm:
SPF -Cancer. Although the performance of our algorithm in
this category does not represent an improvement over SPF -
Cancer, our method offers a large-scale/high—throughput batch
submission facility capable of analysing all foreseeable genomic/
cancer datasets—an important facility that is not offered with
SPF-Cancer. In addition, to facilitate a comparison between our
algorithm and another leading computational prediction algo-
rithm: CHASM (Carter et al., 2009), we performed a 2-fold
cross-validation procedure and observed an improved perform-
ance when using our method. We also compared the perform-
ance of our algorithm with four computational prediction
algorithms: SIFT (Ng and Henikoff, 2001), PolyPhen—2
(Adzhubei et al., 2010), Mutation Assessor (Reva et al., 2011)
and TransFIC (Gonzalez-Perez et al., 2012), using a published
benchmark (Gonzalez-Perez et al., 2012). Once again, we
observed improved performance accuracies over traditional com-
putational prediction algorithms: SIFT, PolyPhen-2 and
Mutation Assessor; and we noted comparable performances
with the Mutation Assessor TransFIC.

In any fair comparison, care should be taken to reduce the
potential overlap between the mutation datasets used for training
and testing; however, this level of testing is not possible, as it
would require obtaining and retraining each algorithm with
common datasets. To remove the potential bias in our results,
we performed a 20-fold cross-validation procedure across our
benchmark. From this analysis, we observed no signiﬁcant devi-
ations in the performance of our algorithm and, therefore, con-
cluded that the performances observed were not an artefact of
the weighting scheme used.

The potential beneﬁts of incorporating cancer-speciﬁc infor-
mation into our predictions were assessed by comparing the per-
formance of our cancer-speciﬁc weighting scheme with the
performance of our original inherited-disease weighting scheme.
In accordance with previous ﬁndings (Kaminker et al., 2007a),
we observed some similarities in driver scores/predictions be-
tween the two weighting schemes. However, we noted improved
odds in identifying driver/passenger mutations using a cancer-
speciﬁc weighting scheme. Unsurprisingly, we also noted signiﬁ-
cantly improved odds in correctly classifying disease-causing
(non-neoplasm) mutations as having no effect on tumour

progression. Therefore, by incorporating a cancer-speciﬁc
weighting scheme, we have shown that our method is capable
of identifying mutations that directly contribute to carcinogen-
esis, irrespective of other underlying disease associations.

To facilitate the analysis of large-scale cancer genomic data-
sets, our public web server (available at http://fathmm.biocom-
pute.org.uk) provides unrestricted and near instant predictions
for all possible amino acid substitutions within the human prote-
ome. For example, we were capable of annotating the entire
COSMIC (Bamford et al., 2004) database—comprising of over
half a million mutations—in <1 h using a single processing core.
In addition, we also provide an open-source software package
allowing users to run our algorithm using their high-performance
computing systems.

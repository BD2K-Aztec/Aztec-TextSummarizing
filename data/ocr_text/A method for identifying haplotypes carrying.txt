ABSTRACT

Motivation: Methods for detecting positive selection relied on
finding evidence of long haplotypes to identify candidate regions
under selection. However, these methods generally do not identify
the length and form of the selected haplotype.

Results: We present HapFinder, a method which can find the
common longest haplotype under three different settings from a
database, which is relevant in the analysis of positive selection in
population genetics and also in medical genetics for finding the
likely haplotype form carrying the causal allele at the functional
polymorphism.

Availability: A java program, implementing the methods described
in HapFinder, together with R scripts and datasets for producing
the figures presented in this article are publicly available at
http://www.nus-cme.org.sg/sgvp/software/hapfinder.html. The site
also hosts an online browser for finding haplotypes from the
International HapMap Project and the Singapore Genome Variation
Project.

1 INTRODUCTION

Haplotypes refer to the speciﬁc combinations of alleles at different
locations on a chromosome. Diploid organisms such as humans
carry two copies of chromosomes, and thus two haplotypes are
present for each individual when considering the chromosomal
arrangement of the alleles at several variant sites, such as single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). At the fundamental level, the
haplotype carries most of the genetic information, particularly for
the assessment of allelic correlation in the genome and in situations
where the exact sequence arrangement on the chromosome is
important. However, the technical ease of assaying a single base
position in the genome means it is more common to obtain the
aggregate information across the two chromosomes of an individual,
also known as the genotype. The advent of affordable large—
scale genotyping technologies has permitted the genotypes of up
to a million positions across the human genome to be assayed
simultaneously, facilitating the studies on the genetic etiology of

common diseases and complex traits across thousands of samples
(Donnelly, 2008; McCarthy et al., 2008). When only genotype
information is available, resolving the exact arrangements of the
alleles on the two haplotypes for an individual requires sophisticated
statistical machinery in a process known as haplotype phasing.
A number of statistical procedures have been formulated for inferring
the haplotype phases from genotype data, such as PHASE (Stephens
and Scheet, 2005), fastPHASE (Scheet and Stephens, 2006) and
Beagle (Browning and Browning, 2007). Public databases like the
International HapMap Project (Consortium, 2007, 2010), Human
Genome Diversity Project (Jakobsson et al., 2008) and Singapore
Genome Variation Project (Teo et al., 2009) have generated reference
genotypes for a considerable number of populations globally, with
statistically inferred haplotypes also available for a number of these
populations.

Generally, the lengths of common shared ancestral segments
of chromosomes in a population are short since recombination
acts over time to break down long haplotypes. An exception is
in genomic regions experiencing positive evolutionary pressure
of natural selection (Sabeti et al., 2002), where greater ﬁtness in
survival and procreation results in a higher propensity that offsprings
in subsequent generations will increasingly carry the advantageous
mutations. This can increase the frequency of an advantageous allele
and, due to the hitch—hiking effects of neighbouring alleles and
insufﬁcient time for recombination to occur, result in haplotypes
that are uncharacteristically long for a given haplotype frequency.
A number of sophisticated statistical methods, for example, XP—EHH
(Sabeti et al., 2007) and iHS (Voight et al., 2006), have relied on
ﬁnding such genomic signatures of long haplotypes for identifying
candidate regions that are experiencing positive selection. However,
these methods generally do not identify the length and form of the
selected haplotype.

The presence of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the human
genome implies that there will be numerous SNPs that are
correlated with each other. In large—scale genotype—phenotype
association studies, the discovery of a trait—associated region is
often accompanied by a list of neighbouring SNPs displaying
similar degrees of statistical evidence. Due to the nature of LD,
most, if not all of the identiﬁed alleles carried on these SNPs
are likely to be found on a haplotype that also carries the
functional allele at the unknown causal variant. This would be
useful for narrowing the likely candidate region where the functional
variant may be located, particularly when evidence from multiple

Method for identifying haplotypes

 

genetically diverse populations is available. We can then localize
the candidate region to genomic segments where these population—
speciﬁc implicated haplotypes are consistent across the various
populations.

Here, we introduce a novel method for ﬁnding haplotypes in
three scenarios from a haplotype database: (i) identifying the
longest haplotype for a user—deﬁned core haplotype frequency that is
carrying a speciﬁc allele at a focal SNP; (ii) around a focal position
with a given core haplotype frequency; (iii) matching a speciﬁc
combination of alleles from a set of user—deﬁned SNPs. Type 1 is
particularly useful when the functional allele at a causal or positively
selected SNP is known a priori. Type 2 is relevant when only the
approximate genomic region of the functional variant is known,
such as the situation where there is preliminary evidence of positive
natural selection in the region from iHS or XP—EHH without explicit
knowledge of the exact focal SNP and causal allele. Type 3 can be
used to ﬁnd the haplotype form that carries most, if not all, of the
implicated alleles associated with disease onset or increased severity
at SNPs that are identiﬁed from genome—wide association studies
(GWAS).

In Section 2, we will describe in details how the method works in
the three settings. Section 3 demonstrates the utility of HapFinder
on known positively selected genomic regions in diverse population
groups from the HapMap, and also via simulated case—control
studies. Finally, in Section 4, we discuss how the method will be
useful in both population and medical genetics studies.

2 METHODS

All three applications of HapFinder require phased haplotype data in the
format of a N x L matrix which we denote as H, where each row represents a
phased haplotype chromosome of an individual and each column represents a
unique biallelic SNP. Thus, N = 2n with n denoting the number of individuals
in the dataset, since humans are diploid and each individual possesses two
chromosomes. Let hi; denote the (i, 1) entry of the matrix H, where hi; 6 {0, 1},
representing the two possible alleles for each SNP. Note that we assume
there is no missing allele information for any haplotype after the phasing
procedure. As HapFinder searches for haplotypes carrying speciﬁc alleles,
it is important to deﬁne accurately what the ‘0’ and ‘1’alleles for each hi;
map to. In all our example applications, we have assumed the alleles are
mapped to the positive strand while following the deﬁnitions of the ‘0’ and
‘1’ alleles according to Phase 2 of the HapMap as encoded in the legend
ﬁles. A schematic overview of the three applications in HapFinder can be
seen in Figure 1.

2.1 Algorithm for Type 1

In searching for the longest haplotype that is at a user—speciﬁed core
haplotype frequency f in the haplotype database and is speciﬁcally carrying a
particular target allele at the focal SNP, we ﬁrst determine the critical number
of chromosomes c=ﬂ00r[f ><N]. The algorithm ﬁrst assesses whether the
allele frequency of the target allele is at least f, and returns an error
message when the target allele frequency is less than f. When the number of
chromosomes carrying the target allele is at least c, the SNP on the immediate
left of the focal SNP is appended to the haplotype form. This means there are
at most two possible haplotypes for these two SNPs that carry the target allele
at the focal SNP, if we assume the neighbouring SNP is either monomorphic
or biallelic. When the number of chromosomes carrying the more common
haplotype is at least c, the next SNP on the left is appended. The algorithm
iterates between adding another SNP on the left and checking whether the
number of chromosomes carrying the most common haplotype is at least c.
When the number of chromosomes carrying the most common haplotype falls

below c, the most recently appended SNP is removed from the haplotype, and
the SNP to the immediate right of the focal SNP is appended. The algorithm
now proceeds to append SNPs on the right until the number of chromosomes
carrying the most common haplotype is less than c, where the most recently
appended SNP on the right is then removed. The longest haplotype spanned
is then returned as the output.

2.2 Algorithm for Type 2

The algorithm for Type 2 is similar to that for Type 1, except that a focal
position is speciﬁed instead of a focal SNP and there is no pre—determined
target allele. In this instance, the SNP on the chromosome that is closest to
the speciﬁed focal position is chosen as the focal SNP, while either of the two
alleles is allowed to be the target allele. The algorithm proceeds according
to the procedure for Type 1, effectively running two separate operations for
each of the two target alleles and identifying the longest haplotype form out
of the two analyses. In this instance, an error message is produced when
the user—speciﬁed core haplotype frequency f is larger than the major allele
frequency.

2.3 Fuzzy matching in Type 1 and Type 2

Large—scale genotyping inevitably introduces errors in the called genotypes
that propagate downstream to the haplotype phasing, thus generating phased
haplotypes that are more likely to be dissimilar at genomic sites affected
by genotyping errors. To allow for such spurious errors in the phased
haplotypes, we permit a small proportion of mismatches when counting
the number of chromosomes carrying the most common haplotype. As
before, the most common haplotype form is ﬁrst identiﬁed, and the similarity
score between this haplotype form and each of the N chromosomes is
calculated. The similarity score between two haplotypes is calculated as
the proportion of SNPs where the alleles are identical across the two
haplotypes. When the similarity score between the most common haplotype
form and a sample chromosome is greater than the user—speciﬁed threshold
5*, the sample chromosome is considered to be sufﬁciently similar to
the most common haplotype. Thus, instead of counting the number of
chromosomes carrying the most common haplotype, fuzzy matching with
S>I<<I counts the number of chromosomes that are similar to the most
common haplotype.

2.4 Algorithm for Type 3

Type 3 of HapFinder allows multiple focal SNPs with corresponding
target alleles to be speciﬁed, and the algorithm aims to identify the haplotype
forms that carry most, if not all, the target alleles. The importance of matching
the allele at each of the K target SNPs is deﬁned by either the SNP weightings
or the genetic distances between the SNPs, or as a composite function of
both. When attempting to identify the haplotype that is carrying the high—
risk alleles at implicated SNPs, the weightings (q1,q2, ...,qK) can be the
statistical evidence of phenotypic association (e.g. —log10P—values or log
Bayes factors). This effectively prioritizes the matching of the target alleles
on SNPs with strong evidence of phenotypic association, and the SNP
possessing the strongest weighting is deﬁned as the central SNP. When SNP
weightings are not provided, the genetic distances of the SNPs (d1 , d2, ... , dK)
must then be provided and the focal position is deﬁned as the average of the
genetic distances of the ﬁrst and last focal SNP dcentre. The contribution of
each SNP is thus deﬁned as

for the i—th chromosome deﬁned as the sum of Wk over the set of focal
SNPs where the chromosome carries the exact target alleles. HapFinder
locates the chromosomes with scores above a user—speciﬁed threshold:
when the threshold is one, only the haplotype forms which carry all the
target alleles at the focal SNPs are identiﬁed; when the threshold is less
than one, mismatches with the target alleles for some focal SNPs may be
permissible as long as the match score for the chromosome is greater than
the threshold.

2.5 Software availability and output

A JAVA program for HapFinder is freely available for download from
http://www.nus—cme.org.sg/sgvp/software/hapﬁnder.html, along with scripts
for producing graphical displays in R. An online web application is also
available for ﬁnding haplotypes in the populations in Phase 2 of the
International HapMap Project (Consortium, 2007) and in the Singapore
Genome Variation Project (Teo et al., 2009). Each analysis generates four
ﬁles: (i) a .haps ﬁle that contains the identiﬁed haplotypes in 0/1 format; (ii)
a .legend ﬁle containing the rs identiﬁers, coordinates and the 0/ 1 allele maps
for the SNPs on the identiﬁed haplotypes; (iii) a .sample ﬁle that indicates
which samples and which haplotype of the sample (sufﬁxed by —1 and —2
to the sample ids) do the identiﬁed haplotypes correspond to; (iv) a .log
ﬁle containing all the haplotype forms that are identiﬁed for that analysis
(which is not restricted to only the longest haplotypes for Types 1 and 2). An
additional ﬁfth ﬁle is also output for Type 3: (v) a .snp ﬁle containing the rs

identiﬁer, coordinate, the allele that is tagging the identiﬁed haplotype and
the LD measured in r2 between each SNP and the identiﬁed haplotype.

3 APPLICATIONS AND RESULTS

To illustrate the utility of HapFinder, we applied the method for the
three settings described on publicly available haplotype data from
the International HapMap Project (Consortium 2007). All genomic
coordinates quoted are on NCBI build 36.

The sickle cell allele (adenine allele) at rs334 on the p15.5
arm of chromosome 11 has been well established to be under
balancing selection in the Yoruba population of HapMap (YRI)
(Feng et al., 2004; Hedrick, 2004), conferring up to 10—fold
protection against malaria (Ackerman et al., 2005; Hill et al.,
1991; Jallow et al., 2009) while providing a recessive Mendelian
risk of sickle cell anaemia. Due to positive selection, the sickle
cell allele is expected to reside on an uncharacteristically long
haplotype compared with other alleles in the genome at the same
frequency. We test this hypothesis by running HapFinder Type
1 on phased haplotypes of Hapmap Phase 2 YRI data, which
included a direct assay of rs334 (Fig. 2). By specifying rs334
as the focal SNP and performing two Type 1 analyses on the
wild—type allele (thymine, allele T) and the sickle allele (allele A)
at a core haplotype frequency of 10%, HapFinder identiﬁed a

Length of shorter haplotype

Fig. 2. (A) An example application of the Type 1 application of HapFinder
for ﬁnding the longest haplotypes carrying the two alleles at the sickle cell
locus (rs334) in YRI, which has a MAF of 12.5%. The alleles on each
haplotype have been coloured accordingly for each of the four possible
bases (A, green; C, blue; G, yellow; T, red). The vertical black lines on
the horizontal grey bar represents where each of the SNPs is located, with
the vertical red line indicating the focal SNP. (B) Comparing the lengths
of the two haplotypes identiﬁed by Type 1 HapFinder for each of the 1000
randomly chosen SNPs with MAFs of 12.5% in YRI, where the red triangle
represents rs334. The three random SNPs that also display the largest extent
of differences between lengths of haplotypes are shaded in orange. The grey
dashed diagonal lines represent the boundaries for the various sizes of the
ratio of the haplotype lengths. All examples were run with parameters core

haplotype form carrying the sickle allele that spans nearly 0.4 Mb,
while the haplotype form carrying the wild—type T allele spans
<40 kb (Fig. 2A). By comparison, there were only 3 SNPs
out of 1000 randomly selected SNPs [each with minor allele
frequency (MAF) of 12.5% in YRI] that displayed similar extent of
differences between the lengths of the shorter and longer haplotypes
(Fig. 2B).

The sickle cell locus provides a convenient example where the
functional polymorphism that is experiencing evolutionary pressure
of positive selection is actually known. In practice, imperfect
SNP coverage in genetic databases like the HapMap means recent
discoveries on candidate regions undergoing positive selection
generally do not identify the selected functional polymorphisms.
Instead, discoveries using selection metrics like iHS and XP—EHH
tend to highlight candidate regions that are displaying putative
evidence of selection. In such situations where only the broad
region is known, without speciﬁc knowledge of the focal SNP
or the selected allele, we can rely on Type 2 of HapFinder to
identify the likely haplotype where the unknown functional allele
sits on. We use the sickle cell example to show that similar
haplotype forms are identiﬁed whether the analysis is performed
at the functional polymorphism with the known selected allele
(at position 5 204 808 on chromosome 11), or when the analysis
is performed at neighbouring focal positions of 5200 000 and

Fig. 3. Visual representations of the haplotypes identiﬁed by the Type 2
application in HapFinder, searching at three separate locations around the
sickle cell locus (rs334, represented as the vertical red line in the horizontal
bars indicating the SNP location) at a core haplotype frequency of 5%. The
alleles on each haplotype have been coloured accordingly for each of the
four possible bases (A, green; C, blue; G, yellow; T, red). The outcome from
the analysis with the focal position of 5 204 808 corresponds to searching
for the longest haplotype with rs334 as the focal SNP. The bottom panel
shows that the three identiﬁed haplotypes are almost identical regardless of
the focal position used in the Hapﬁnder analysis, while the top panel zooms
into a 40 kb window around rs334 and illustrates that all three haplotypes
carry the A allele at rs334 that is experiencing positive selection.

5 210 000 (Fig. 3). This is directly relevant for extracting the selected
haplotype underpinning a candidate signature of positive selection
identiﬁed by iHS or XP—EHH.

By performing multiple iterations of the Type 2 analysis at the
same genomic site but across different core haplotype frequencies, it
may be possible to identify a range of frequencies that the frequency
of the selected allele may be found in. As the speciﬁed core haplotype
frequency changes, the identiﬁed haplotypes can switch between
carrying the non—selected allele to the selected allele, resulting in a
signiﬁcant increase in the length of the identiﬁed haplotype (Fig. 4).
For example, we performed three separate sets of Type 2 analyses
in the HBB gene region in YRI, with focal positions speciﬁed as the
position of rs334 (5 204 808 bp), and two neighbouring positions
(5 200 000 bp) and (5 210000 bp), respectively. We iterate through
core haplotype frequencies of 20 to 5% in step—size reduction
by 1%, observing signiﬁcant increases in the haplotype lengths
at core haplotype frequencies of 12, 11 and 9% (Fig. 4A, top
panel). By measuring the proportion of discordant sites at the
unambiguous overlapping regions between the haplotypes identiﬁed
at two consecutive frequencies, we observed that the discordance
was particularly large at the frequency where there was a substantial
increase in the spanned distance (Fig. 4A, bottom panel). A large
value for discordance typically indicates that different haplotypes
have been identiﬁed between the two consecutive analyses, and this
likely reﬂects the switch to the selected haplotype that is carrying
the advantageous allele. We also performed similar analyses at the
LARGE gene (Fig. 4B) that has been previously reported to be
positively selected for protection against lassa fever in North Central
Africa (Sabeti et al., 2007). The putatively selected allele at the SNP

Fig. 4. Two example applications of Type 2 in HapFinder for identifying the
longest haplotypes by specifying a focal position, rather than a focal SNP.
For each of the two genomic regions, we selected the physical position of the
known/putative SNP undergoing positive natural selection (lines and circles
in red in top panels) and two other physical positions in the neighbourhood
(in grey) as focal positions, and recorded the length of the longest haplotype
across a range of core haplotype frequencies. The bottom panel of each region
shows the change in haplotype distances (red lines and circles) and the degree
of haplotype discordance (grey lines and circles) with a 1% reduction in allele
frequency for the known/putative SNP. (A) Looks at three positions in the
locality of the H33 gene in YRI, with the frequency of the selected allele (at
rs334) to be known at 12.5% in YRI; (B) looks at three positions in the locality
of the LARGE gene in YRI, with the frequency of the non—synonymous
substitution (rs4481698) to be known at 33.3% in YRI.

(chr22: rs481698) with strong evidence of positive selection (via
iHS) has a frequency of 33.3% in YRI, and our analyses observed a
large haplotype discordance and signiﬁcant increases in the length
of the identiﬁed haplotypes when the frequency decreases from 34
to 33%.

To illustrate the application of Type 3 in HapFinder, we simulated
2000 cases and 2000 controls in each of the three HapMap

Fig. 5. Example application of Type 3 in HapFinder in identifying the
haplotype form that is carrying the implicated risk alleles from the associated
SNPs. The vertical dashed line in each of the three panels on the left
represents the position of ‘causal’ SNP (Chr6zrs2206734), where 2000 cases
and 2000 controls are simulated with HAPGEN in the three HapMap
populations with a multiplicative effect of RR: 1.5 at allele T. Only SNPs
on the Illumina 1M array are shown in the region plots, and SNPs with
P < 10‘6 in each population are extracted as input SNPs for Hapﬁnder. The
haplotype spanning a pre—speciﬁed start and end position, and is also carrying
the implicated alleles at the input SNPs for each population is shown on the
right. The alleles on each haplotype have been coloured accordingly for each
of the four possible bases (A, green; C, blue; G, yellow; T, red). As there
may be multiple haplotypes that carry the implicated alleles, SNPs with
non—unique alleles on these haplotypes are represented as vertical grey lines.
While different SNPs are identiﬁed in the association analyses for the three
populations, all three identiﬁed haplotypes correctly carry the high—risk allele
(allele T) at the simulated SNP.

an artiﬁcial causal SNP (rs2206734) located in the CDKALI gene
on chromosome 6, previously established to display signiﬁcant
variation in patterns of LD (Teo et al., 2009). In each of the three
simulations, we introduced a multiplicative effect size equivalent
to an allelic relative risk of 1.5 at the T allele and limited the
association analysis to only SNPs present on the IlluminalM array
while masking the causal SNP (Fig. 5). Genetic markers displaying
association P<10_6 are extracted as input SNPs to HapFinder,
along with the corresponding alleles that are associated with higher
risks and the corresponding observed P—values as SNP weightings
(Refer to Fig. 1). We observed that different implicated SNPs
emerged from each of the three simulations. In each population
panel, we ran Type 3 of HapFinder to identify the haplotype forms
that are carrying most of the high—risk alleles at the associated
SNPs, subject to matching scores of at least 98%. While the
association analyses discovered different implicated SNPs in the
three population panels, the haplotype forms that are identiﬁed by
HapFinder across all three populations correctly carried the high—risk
allele T at the simulated causal SNP (Fig. 5). We also performed the
same simulation experiment at 1000 randomly chosen SNPs that are
present in all three HapMap population panels, in order to assess how
often does the haplotype identiﬁed by HapFinder carry the risk allele
at the simulated causal variant. Out of these 1000 simulations, we
observed that 84.4% of the haplotype forms identiﬁed by HapFinder

Method for identifying haplotypes

 

across all three populations carried the causal allele that is associated
with a higher disease risk.

4 DISCUSSION

We have introduced a strategy for ﬁnding haplotypes under three
scenarios that are relevant to the analysis of positive natural selection
and GWAS. The classical example of the sickle cell locus was also
used to highlight the utility of the method, both in ﬁnding the selected
haplotype and at estimating the likely frequency of the selected
allele. By simulating case—control data around an artiﬁcial causal
SNP for each of the three HapMap panels, the method is able to
identify the haplotype forms that carry the detrimental alleles at the
associated SNPs that had emerged from the association analysis in
each population separately. All three haplotype forms identiﬁed from
the respective HapMap populations correctly carried the functional
allele at the simulated causal variant. Further simulations indicate
at least 80% power in identifying the haplotype form which the
functional allele resides on.

Our method is able to identify the longest haplotype at a speciﬁed
core frequency around a focal position. Theoretically, this can be
applied across the genome at every available SNP and across a range
of core haplotype frequencies. For a particular core frequency, one
may expect the lengths of the identiﬁed haplotypes to be distributed
within a speciﬁc range, and haplotypes that are uncharacteristically
long for a particular core frequency could be the result of positive
natural selection happening within those genomic regions. This
may provide another strategy in searching for candidate signals of
positive selection, although there is a need to account for local effects
of LD that may potentially bias the analysis (work in progress).

The ﬁeld of medical genetics is now focusing its attention
towards the ﬁne—mapping of the functional polymorphisms that
explain the biological mechanisms and underpin the genotype—
phenotype association signals emerging from GWAS. However,
while LD has beneﬁtted the initial examination for implicated
regions in the genome, long stretches of high LD have paradoxically
confounded the ﬁne—mapping process by yielding numerous
near—perfect surrogates of the unknown causal variant. This
complicates the process of distinguishing the causal variant
from neighbouring correlated markers. When GWAS data and
high—resolution haplotypes (e. g. those from the 1000 Genomes
Project, http://www.1000genomes.org) for multiple populations are
available, our method can identify the haplotype forms that are
carrying most of the implicated detrimental alleles in the different
populations. By framing such trans—population analysis within a
rigorous statistical framework, it may be possible to identify the
genomic regions that are consistent with the association ﬁndings
and the population—speciﬁc reference haplotype structure. This could
subsequently be developed to localize the candidate positions of the
functional polymorphism (Teo et al., 2010) (work in progress).

The popularity of genome—wide studies coupled with fast
haplotype phasing software like fastPHASE (Stephens and Scheet,
2005) and Beagle (Browning and Browning, 2007) means it is
realistically possible to statistically construct the haplotypes from the
genotype data of thousands of samples. This is likely to be extremely
useful in both population and medical genetics, as second—order
information involving the arrangement of alleles on a chromosome
can be more informative than ﬁrst—order information like the allele
frequencies from genotypes of individual SNPs, particularly in

understanding genomic diversity across multiple populations. In
fact, several major population genetics studies have relied on the
haplotype diversity plots as empirical evidence on the extent of
inter—population dissimilarities (Conrad et al., 2006; Jakobsson
et al., 2008). We thus introduce HapFinder, a novel methodological
development speciﬁcally designed to ﬁnd haplotypes within a
population setting, which complements statistical tools for detecting
positive natural selection and facilitates progress in medical genetics
by locating the likely haplotype structure that the functional
allele will sit on. This method has been implemented in a Java
program which is packaged together with scripts for producing
graphical displays in R and is freely available from http://www.nus—
cme.org.sg/sgvp/software/hapﬁnder.html. This URL also contains
an interactive application for submitting online queries to ﬁnd
haplotypes from populations in Phase 2 of the HapMap and the
Singapore Genome Variation Project.

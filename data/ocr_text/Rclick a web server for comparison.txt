Abstract

Summary: RNA molecules play important roles in key biological processes in the cell and are
becoming attractive for developing therapeutic applications. Since the function of RNA depends on
its structure and dynamics, comparing and classifying the RNA 3D structures is of crucial import—
ance to molecular biology. In this study, we have developed Rclick, a web server that is capable of
superimposing RNA 3D structures by using clique matching and 3D least—squares fitting. Our ser—
ver Rclick has been benchmarked and compared with other popular servers and methods for RNA
structural alignments. In most cases, Rclick alignments were better in terms of structure overlap.
Our server also recognizes conformational changes between structures. For this purpose, the ser—
ver produces complementary alignments to maximize the extent of detectable similarity. Various
examples showcase the utility of our web server for comparison of RNA, RNA—protein complexes

and RNA—ligand structures.

Availability and implementation: The Rclick web server is freely accessible at http://mspc.bii.a—star.

1 Introduction

Comparing RNA 3D structures gives us unique insights into their
evolution and function. While there are numerous methods for com—
paring and classifying protein 3D structures (Cuff et 61]., 2009;
Kolodny et 61]., 2005 ; Murzin et 61]., 1995 ; Stebbings and Mizuguchi,
2004), there have been very few such methods for RNA 3D struc—
tures (Rother et 61]., 2011). Given the rapid pace with which new
RNA structures are deposited in the PDB (Berman et 61]., 2000), it is
crucial to have tools to classify and categorize these structures and
investigate them for similarities at different levels. Here, the Rclick
web server is designed to provide a user—friendly interface to com—
pare RNA 3D structures and produces accurate alignments when
the structures are similar.

The performance of Rclick was compared to other popular ser—
vers and methods that align RNA 3D structures, including ARTS

(Dror et 61]., 2005, 2006), SARA (Capriotti and Marti-Renom,
2008, 2009), CLICK (Nguyen et al., 2011), SETTER (Hoksza and
Svozil, 2012; Cech, et 61]., 2012), and R3D Align (Rahrig et al.,
2010, 2013) on different benchmark RNA datasets (Supplementary
Figs. 84—86 and Supplementary Tables 81—84). The structure over—
laps of Rclick in these comparisons were better. Figure 1 and
Supplementary 81 and 82A and B in show the utilities of Rclick for
comparison of large ribosomal subunit, RNA—protein complexes
and RNA—ligand structures. While Rclick produced accurate align—
ments of RNA—protein interactions between two Ribonuclease III
(PDB codes 2LUP and 1RC7, Fig. 1), when compared to other web
servers such as SETTER (Cech, et 61]., 2012) and ARTS (Dror et 61].,
2006) which could not align correctly RNA—binding sites.
Supplementary Figure 82A and B show two thiamine pyrophosphate
(TPP) riboswitches (PDB codes 2CKY chain A and 2GDI chain X)

Fig. 1. Snapshots of the Rclick server showing the output of a structural alignment of two RNA that belong to Ribonuclease 111 family, PDB codes 2LUP and 1RC7.
Rclick shows the accurate alignment of RNA—protein interactions between 2LUP (salmon) and 1RC7 (green). The superimposed residues of 2LUP and 1RC7 are

shown in red and blue colors, respectively. The conserved residues are shown in bold and red lettering

aligned with one another, and the similarities of conformation of the
bound TPP ligands in both RNA structures. These examples high—
light the capabilities of our web server that produces accurate align—
ments of RNA structures and additionally aids in the general area of
prediction of RNA—protein and RNA—ligand interactions. In add—
ition, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first RNA structure
comparison server that shows conformational changes in the RNA
structures being compared (Supplementary Fig. 83A and B).

2 Program overview

Our server Rclick aligns RNA 3D structures by enhancing the
CLICK algorithm that matches cliques of points (Nguyen and
Madhusudhan, 2011; Nguyen et al.,2011). As in the original imple-
mentation, CLICK only optimally superimposes a pair of protein 3D
structures independent of topology. In this study, cliques are optimal
groupings of representative atoms (C3’ for RNA structures, and C3’
and C“ for RNA—protein complexes) within a certain spatial prox—
imity. Any pairwise distance amongst clique members is less than
the set threshold. A pair of RNA structures is structurally aligned by
matching cliques based on the superimposition of their Cartesian co—
ordinates with 3D least squares fitting. The objective here is to es—
tablish local structural similarities.

Clique matching identifies structurally equivalent residues in the
two structures. Using these equivalences, a final 3D least squares fit
is performed to superimpose the two RNA structures. The matching
of cliques is not necessarily unique, i.e. it is possible to generate mul—
tiple structural alignments. The chosen alignment is the one that
maximizes structure overlap. Here, structure overlap (also called

equivalent positions) is defined as the percentage of the representa—
tive atoms in the structure A that are within 4  [root mean square
deviation (RMSD) cutoff] of the corresponding atoms in the super—
imposed structure B. The user can set RMSD cutoff parameter
within 3 and 6  in the Rclick server.

By optimizing representative atoms and parameters for RNA
structures, the average structure overlap values of Rclick alignments
are better than those of CLICK on the benchmark datasets
(Supplementary Tables 81—84).

3 Server description

3.1 Input

Input RNA structure can be submitted by specifying the 4—letter
code for an existing structure deposited in the PDB or by uploading
a structure in PDB format. In addition to the 4—letter code, the user
can specify the identity of particular chains from the query structure.
Fragments of structures are also acceptable as input, as long as there
are three or more representative atoms. An explanation of the input
structure is provided in the help pages.

3.2 Output

The structure alignment is shown in two lines, one line per structure.
The number and chain identifier of the first aligned residue on both
structures precedes the listing of the residue one letter codes. Each
time the alignment fragments, the number and chain identifier of the
last residue in the fragment are also listed. Accompanying each
alignment is a 3D rendition of the structural superimposition using
JSMol. The superimposed residues on both structures will be

displayed when the user clicks the button labelled ‘Show aligned
residues’ in the JSMol viewer (Fig. 1).

Should there be conformational changes in the RNA structures
being compared, Rclick first reports the largest alignment, in terms
of the number of residues aligned. The method then seeks to com—
pare the regions of the RNA structures that were not aligned first.
The detection of further structural similarity results in additional
output alignments, shown one below the other in the aforemen-
tioned format (Supplementary Figs. 83A and B).

The alignments are downloadable in PIR format and in Rclick
format that shows one equivalent representative atom match per
line. Also downloadable are the coordinates of the superimposed
structures in PDB format.

Statistics relevant to the alignment including structure overlap,
RMSD, fragment score, topology score, number of representative
atoms in the two structures, length of the match and the number of
identical residue matches are displayed in a table. Detailed help
pages explain the significance of the different alignment measures.

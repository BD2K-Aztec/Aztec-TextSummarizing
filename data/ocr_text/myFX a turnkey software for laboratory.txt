ABSTRACT

Summary: Spatial patterns of gene expression are of key importance
in understanding developmental networks. Using in situ hybridization,
many laboratories are generating images to describe these spatial
patterns and to test biological hypotheses. To facilitate such analyses,
we have developed biologist-centric software (myFX) that contains
computational methods to automatically process and analyze
images depicting embryonic gene expression in the fruit fly
Drosophila melanogaster. |t facilitates creating digital descriptions of
spatial patterns in images and enables measurements of pattern simi-
larity and visualization of expression across genes and developmental
stages. myFX interacts directly with the online FIyEXpress database,
which allows users to search thousands of existing patterns to find
co-expressed genes by image comparison.

Availability and implementation: myFX is freely available at http://

Analyzing embryonic gene expression in developmental space
and time has greatly contributed to our understanding of devel-
opmental regulatory networks. Genes co-expressed in the de-
veloping embryo are of special interest because they may share
common regulatory elements and participate in similar develop-
mental processes (Konikoff et al., 2012; Kumar et al., 2011;
Lecuyer et al., 2007; Tomancak et al., 2002, 2007). In situ hy-
bridization data from Drosophila melanogaster are a model for
such image-based analyses because of the vast number of experi-
mental studies revealing the functions of many genes and an
abundant collection of high-throughput in situ images capturing
the expression time-course of these genes throughout embryo-
genesis (Kumar et al., 2002; Lecuyer et al., 2007; Tomancak
et a]. 2002, 2007). Drosophila embryos have been efﬁciently digit-
ally standardized, allowing direct image-to-image comparisons of
spatial expression patterns (Frise et a]. 2010; Kumar et a]. 2011).
Overall, Drosophila presents a unique opportunity to assess
both developmental spatial patterns and functional significance.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Therefore, many laboratories use the Drosophila model system to
investigate spatial patterns and test biological hypotheses.

We have developed a new software package (myFX) to facili-
tate investigations of these spatial patterns of gene expression.
This software is intended to be a user-friendly platform to store,
annotate, visualize and analyze images depicting expression pat-
terns of developmentally relevant genes in Drosophila embryo-
genesis. It is closely linked with our F lyExpress resource (Kumar
et a]. 2011) to enhance function discovery by searching thou-
sands of existing images of gene expression patterns.

For ease of use, myFX provides fast installation on Mac OSX
and Microsoft Windows, which produces a local image reposi-
tory and SQL database without requiring users to have any
knowledge of databases or other advanced computer techniques.
The myFX interface works in a similar manner on both operating
systems and accepts image data in TIFF, JPEG and BMP image
formats, among others. Images can be imported into myFX by
browsing file folders or by dragging-and-dropping. Here, we
describe key functionalities of myFX through two common use
cases.

In one, a user has a novel in situ image and would like to
standardize it and search for co-expressed genes. Once a user
uploads images into myFX (Fig. 1A), automatic processing for
size standardization and image alignment necessary for develop-
mental comparisons is initiated (Konikoff et a]. 2012; Kumar
et a]. 2011) (Fig. 1B). myFX contains facilities for the user to
refine standardization and alignment using a built-in image
editor, where the images can be rotated, ﬂipped (horizontally
and vertically) and scrubbed (Fig. 1C). This means that the
user can work interactively with myFX to manually enhance
quality of image standardization.

Next, myFX creates three spatial profiles for each processed
embryo, where black pixels denote expression presence and white
pixels indicate expression absence. The middle profile represents
gene expression in the image, whereas the left and right profiles
are under- and over-representation of staining, respectively.
These spatial proﬁles are necessary for expression comparisons
and other downstream analyses, including searching the online
FlyExpress database (or a local database, see later) for genes with
similar patterns of expression (Fig. 1D). Such analyses also re-
quire that the developmental stage and anatomical orientation of

screenshot of the myFX image grid that displays thumbnails of original and processed images, along with their standardized expression patterns.
(C) The myFX interface provides an image editor with capability to correct automatically standardized expression patterns. (D) Users can launch
searches for co-expressed genes by accessing the menu associated with expression proﬁles. (E) Each processed image is associated with three unique
expression proﬁles, which can be used for searching. Pixels from the selected pattern are automatically mapped onto a GEM (Genomewide Expression
Map), which represents global expression for genes of a given stage range and anatomical orientation in the FlyExpress digital library. (F) A user may
drag-and—align the pixels onto the GEM to enhance the accuracy of image alignments. They may also select the sampling of pixels to be used. (G) A
results table showing a ranked list of genes, sorted according to overlap between the query and expression of genes captured in the GEM

easily input into myFX.

To search for co-expressed genes, clicking on a spatial proﬁle
produces a search dialog for launching an online search
(Fig. 1E). Selecting an expression proﬁle and data source results
in a set of search pixels overlaid on a FlyExpress Genomewide
Expression Map (GEM) below (Fig. 1F). Search pixels represent
key points of gene expression in a spatial proﬁle and can be
aligned on the GEM by manually dragging the pixel collection.
The GEMs represent global expression among genes for a given
stage and anatomical orientation (Konikoff et a]. 2012). Using
our novel GEM-based searching system, co-expressed genes are
found by taking the collection of pixels in a spatial proﬁle, map-
ping them onto the appropriate GEM and asking for genes that
share the highest numbers of co-expressed pixels with the query.

This system replaces the current image-to-image similarity
search based on pairwise comparison of spatial proﬁles (Kumar
et a]. 2011) and obviates the need to pre-compute an enormous
pairwise image similarity matrix that currently contains hundreds
of millions of values and requires a large-scale database indexing
system. To enhance the speed and quality of GEM-based search-
ing, we also developed new multipoint searching capabilities be-
tween myFX and FlyExpress. A user can ﬁnd genes with similar
expression patterns in FlyExpress from an ad hoc user deﬁned
multipoint search from GEMs created in myFX. This capability
is available thanks to new database updates to FlyExpress.

Launching the search produces a new window, where results
are displayed in a list format (Fig. 1G). For example, 2237 genes
showing varying extents of co-expression with the Dichaete query
are produced. The number to the left of each gene indicates the

Fig. 2. (A) Expression proﬁles facilitate creation of custom GEMs, which visually represent expression in a set of images. A GEM of the genes in
Figure l is shown. (B) Expression levels can also be visualized along anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral axes. In the histogram, percentage of Die/mete
expression is determined by the number of black pixels to total pixels for the expression proﬁle selected

number of pixels exhibiting co-expression with the query. In the
example, 84 genes show co-expression with Dichaete at >90% of
selected pixels. Additional genes involved in neuroblast develop-
ment (such as SoxN and pdm2, Buescher et al. 2002; Tsuji et al.
2008) are among the top-ranked results. In addition to these
biologically relevant examples, some uncharacterized genes
exhibiting high expression overlap are also among the results.
These genes are now candidates for experimental testing to de-
termine potential involvement, if any, in neuroblast or related
developmental networks.

In the second usage scenario, a myFX user has many more
images for processing and analysis. myFX will automatically pro-
cess all images, and users can reﬁne and annotate each image and
its expression. Any spatial expression pattern may be used to
launch a search for co-expressed genes within the local database,
or online via FlyExpress. Also, users can organize images into
groups in myFX, which can be used to generate custom GEMs
(Fig. 2A). In GEMs, expression levels are rendered as heatmaps,
with darker colors indicating greater amounts of co-expression in
a given area (Kumar et al. 2011). Spatial proﬁles can also be
used to visualize expression levels along an embryo’s anterior—
posterior or dorsal—ventral axis (Fig. 2B). These histograms can
be used to graphically compare the time-course of expression for
a speciﬁc gene in the context of embryonic axes or to compare
expression for a group of genes expressed at the same stage in the
developing embryo.

myFX offers advantages over existing tools for managing and
analyzing in situ experimental data, such as FlyGUI (Crombach
et al. 2012) and SPEX2 (Puniyani et al. 2010). For example,
myFX is a turn-key application that can be easily installed by
any user on Windows and Mac OS, which are popular operating
systems in Drosophila developmental biology laboratories. Also,
myFX can process whole-mount in situ images from a wider
variety of ﬁle formats. It is also user-friendly, as drag-and-drop
uploading and sorting will permit biologists to easily organize
their images in myFX. Moreover, myFX provides automated
image standardization with tools for manual reﬁnement,
allowing expression proﬁles to be edited if desired. In addition,
myFX is unique in its ability to search for genes with
overlapping patterns locally within the user’s own images and
on the web at FlyExpress. For sets of expression patterns,
myFX can also uniquely generate expression summaries, called
GEMs, which summarize expression in a collection of images
belonging to a speciﬁc stage (or stage range) and anatomical
orientation.

Overall, our myFX software represents our effort to give biolo-
gists image storage and additional gene expression analysis tools
for use on their own desktops. We expect this new resource will
open examinations of patterns of gene expression to a wider
audience of biologists, allowing them to quickly identify new
candidates for hypothesis-driven experimentation, and thereby
lead to enhanced discoveries on biological mechanisms that
direct important biological processes.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Regioselectivity-WebPredictor (RS-WebPredictor) is a
serverthat predicts isozyme-specific cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated
sites of metabolism (SOMs) on drug-like molecules. Predictions may be
made for the promiscuous 2C9, 2D6 and 3A4 CYP isozymes, as well as
CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C19 and 2E1. RS-WebPredictor is the first
freely accessible server that predicts the regioselectivity of the last six
isozymes. Server execution time is fast, taking on average 23 to encode
a submitted molecule and 13 to apply a given model, allowing for
high-throughput use in lead optimization projects.

Availability: RS-WebPredictor is accessible for free use at http://reccr.

1 INTRODUCTION

The cytochrome P450s (CYPs) are a family of heme-thiolate
proteins that metabolize ~90% of FDA-approved drugs
(Nebert and Russell, 2002). Most CYPs are ‘regioselective’,
strongly favouring the oxidation of certain sites of metabolism
(SOMs) over others. Knowledge of the SOMs, the speciﬁc
atom(s) of a molecule that are oxidized by speciﬁc CYP iso-
zymes, is valuable information for early-stage lead design and
optimization. Armed with this knowledge, medicinal chemists
can make rational modiﬁcations to a candidate lead in order
to change its CYP-mediated metabolism. One way to use regios-
electivity knowledge to perform rational lead optimization is to
increase drug bioavailability based upon individual CYP-
expression proﬁle while retaining patient uniform end-target ef-
ﬁcacy. Unfortunately, determining the isozyme-speciﬁc SOMs of
early-stage lead candidates through experimental means is time-
and resource-intensive, and not feasible for application to every
candidate. Consequently, several groups in recent years de-
veloped in silico SOM prediction models (Kirchmair et al., 2012).

Regioselectivity-Predictor (RS-Predictor) is an algorithm for
creating accurate isozyme-specﬁc SOM prediction models from
any set of known substrates and metabolites (Zaretzki et al.,

2011). In prior work, we manually curated the public literature
to identify 680 CYP substrates and metabolites distributed across
nine isozymes, the largest collection of cytochrome P450 metab-
olite data released to date. RS-Predictor was able to identify
experimentally observed SOM(s) within the top two rank pos-
itions for substrate sets of each CYP isozyme with high levels of
cross-validated accuracy: CYP isozyme (number of substrates,
accuracy), 1A2 (271, 83.0%), 2A6 (105, 85.7%), 2B6 (151,
82.1%), 2C8 (142, 83.8%), 2C9 (226, 84.5%), 2C19 (218,
86.2%), 2D6 (270, 85.9%), 2E1 (145, 82.8%), 3A4 (475,
82.3%). These accuracies were signiﬁcantly higher than those
of commercial methods StarDrop (78.0%, 75.3%, 74.1%) from
Optibrium and the P450 SOM Prediction workﬁow (72.1%,
68.1%, 76.4%) offered by Schrddinger for 2C9, 2D6 and 3A4
sets, respectively. Although there have been a number of SOM
prediction models for these three isozymes, RS-Predictor offers
the ﬁrst ligand-based models for the remaining six isozymes.
The full details of the RS-Predictor algorithm have been
described in prior work (Zaretzki et al., 2011) and are summarized
here. RS-Predictor calibrates an isozyme-speciﬁc regioselectivity
QSAR from a set of known isozyme substrates and metabolites
by treating each substrate as an individual competition between
candidate SOMs. Each SOM is represented by 148 topological
descriptors—is the SOM in an aromatic ring, what is the size of
the ring, what is the distribution of different atom types 1, 2, 3 and
4 bond lengths away from the given SOM, etc.—and a
SMARTCyp-derived reactivity descriptor. SMARTCyp is an
open-source ligand-based method that encoded density functional
theory-derived transition state energies of molecule substructures
with an isozyme non-speciﬁc CYP heme into a reactivity look-up
table (Rydberg et al., 2010). Next, SOM prediction models are
created using MIRank (multiple-instance ranking), a generaliza-
tion of support vector machines that is speciﬁcally designed to
optimize the ranking of observed SOMs over non-observed
SOMs on a substrate by substrate basis (Bergeron et al., 2012).
It is important to note that these models do not predict whether
the given molecule is metabolized by a particular isozyme; they
predict the exact location on that molecule that would be oxidized
by that CYP if the molecule is a substrate for that particular
isozyme. This limitation is shared by all other SOM prediction
models, a comprehensive review of which was made by Kirchmair
et a]. (2012). Still, the high prediction accuracies of RS-Predictor

models, and the fact that they encapsulate the largest collection of
CYP substrate and metabolite information publicly available,
make free access to predictions made by them a valuable contri-
bution to the scientiﬁc and pharmaceutical communities.

2 RS-WEBPREDICTOR

Although the RS-Predictor algorithm has been described, no
utility has been made available that lets users quickly and
easily apply it to predict the CYP-mediated metabolism of can-
didate molecules. The main contribution of this application note
is RS-WebPredictor, a public server that predicts sites of
isozyme-speciﬁc CYP-mediated metabolism on any set of user-
supplied molecules. Predictions may be made by SOM prediction
models for the promiscuous 2C9, 2D6 and 3A4 CYPs, as well as
CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2Cl9 and 2E1. This is the ﬁrst online
tool to predict the regioselectivity of the last six isozymes. In
addition, a combined model is made available that was calibrated
on all available substrates and all CYP-mediated reactions they
undergo, regardless of the metabolizing isozyme.

2.1 Input options

RS-WebPredictor lets the user submit candidate molecule(s) in one
of two ways: (i) a single structure may be either drawn or copied
from a MOL ﬁle, or (ii) a batch ﬁle of any number of compounds
may be submitted in SDF or SMILES format, to allow for
high-throughput isozyme-speciﬁc SOM predictions. The user can
select which CYP model(s) they wish to apply and an optional
email address where they wish to receive the results.

2.2 Server output

As output, the top three predicted SOMs of each chosen isozyme
model are provided for each submitted molecule in three formats:
(i) an SDF ﬁle is created with additional ﬁelds designated the
primary, secondary and tertiary SOMs predicted by the selected
model(s), (ii) a tabular result ﬁle containing the molecule name,
and the atom IDs from the primary, secondary and tertiary pre-
dicted SOMs, and (iii) a web page is generated with graphic ﬁgures
of each submitted molecule having numbers and circles drawn to
designate the corresponding top three predicted SOMs by a given
model. Links are provided in the web page that allow the user to
see all predictions for the set of input compounds on a
model-by-model basis. An example of the graphical output of
2B6, 2C9 and 2D6 model predictions on the substrate cinnarizine
is illustrated in Figure l. Graphical output is available on current
versions of Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer
and Safari, or any browser that has the Google Chrome Frame
plugin installed. It is important to note that predictions made by
RS-WebPredictor on any compound that was contained within
the initial calibration sets should be considered overtrained. These
calibration sets may be found in the Supporting Information of
Zaretzki et al. (2012), as well as the release notes of this web server.

2.3 Execution time

When applied to a batch ﬁle of >100 random molecules, the
average execution time is ~2s per molecule for descriptor gener-
ation and ls per molecule for each model. So, execution time per
substrate for an individual model is ~2s if executed on a large
batch. There can be substantial increases in per-molecule

 

Fig. 1. The ﬁrst, second and third predicted SOMs of 2B6, 2C9 and 2D6
RS-Predictor models when applied to cinnarizine. The graphical output
of RS-WebPredictor is exactly as shown above, save for the lack of light-
ning bolts, which designate the experimentally observed SOM(s) for the
given isozyme. Solid colouring denotes a primary metabolite while the
outlined bolt designates a secondary metabolite of CYP 2C9

execution time on small batches. Applying the server to a
single substrate takes 4.3s, 6.3s and 13s for molecules with 3,
21 and 88 heavy atoms, respectively. Nonetheless, this server is
quick enough to feasibly analyse either individual molecules or
small batches of several hundred molecules.

3 CONCLUSION

We release a publicly available server for fast web-based predic-
tion of CYP-mediated metabolism on user-submitted molecules
(http://reccr.chem.rpi.edu/Software/RS—WebPredictor/). This is
the ﬁrst server that makes site of metabolism predictions for
nine isozymes, and uses models trained on the largest collection
of CYP substrate and metabolite data publicly available. We
expect it will be a valuable tool for lead optimization and aca-
demic investigations into CYP-mediated metabolism.

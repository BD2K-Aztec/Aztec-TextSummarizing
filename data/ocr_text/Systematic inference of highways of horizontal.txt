ABSTRACT

Motivation: Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) plays a crucial role in the
evolution of prokaryotic species. Typically, no more than a few genes
are horizontally transferred between any two species. However, sev-
eral studies identified pairs of species (or linages) between which
many different genes were horizontally transferred. Such a pair is
said to be linked by a highway of gene sharing. Inferring such high-
ways is crucial to understanding the evolution of prokaryotes and for
inferring past symbiotic and ecological associations among different
species.

Results: We present a new improved method for systematically
detecting highways of gene sharing. As we demonstrate using a
variety of simulated datasets, our method is highly accurate and
efficient, and robust to noise and high rates of HGT. We further valid-
ate our method by applying it to a published dataset of >22 000 gene
trees from 144 prokaryotic species. Our method makes it practical, for
the first time, to perform accurate highway analysis quickly and easily
even on large datasets with high rates of HGT.

1 INTRODUCTION

Horizontal gene transfer (HGT, also called lateral gene transfer)
is an evolutionary process in which genes are transferred between
two organisms that do not have an ancestor—descendant relation-
ship. HGT is known to be rampant among prokaryotes, and
plays an important role in their evolution and survival. An im-
portant problem in understanding microbial evolution is to infer
the HGT events (i.e. the donor and recipient species of each
HGT) that occurred during the evolution of a set of species.
This problem is generally solved in a comparative-genomics
framework by using a parsimony criterion, based on the
observation that the evolutionary history of horizontally
transferred genes does not agree with the evolutionary history

of the corresponding set of species. (This is illustrated in
Supplementary Fig. S1). More formally, given a gene tree
and a species tree, the HGT-inference problem is to find the min-
imum number of HGT events that can explain the incongruence
of the gene tree with the species tree. The HGT-inference prob-
lem is known to be NP-hard under most formulations
(Bordewich and Semple, 2005; Hallett and Lagergren, 2001;
Hickey et al., 2008) and, along with some of its variants, has
been extensively studied (Beiko et al., 2005; B00 et al., 2010;
B00 and Makarenkov, 2003; Hallett and Lagergren, 2001; Hill
et al., 2010; Jin et al., 2009; Nakhleh et al., 2004; Nakhleh et al.,
2005; Than et al., 2007).

In general, one expects only a few genes to have been horizon-
tally transferred between any given pair of species. However, it
has been observed that some pairs of species are connected by a
multitude of HGT events. This can happen, for example, when a
pair of species co-inhabit the same ecological niche over a long
period of time (Boussau et al., 2008; Zhaxybayeva et al., 2009b),
due to syntrophic or other close symbiotic relationships between
partners (Lake, 2009; Martin and Muller, 1998; Overmann and
Schubert, 2002; von Dohlen et al., 2001), or because only the
acquisition of a complete pathway can provide a selective advan-
tage to the recipient (Igarashi et al., 2001; Lawrence and Roth,
1996). Such pairs of species are said to be connected by a highway
of gene sharing (Beiko et al., 2005—We point out that Beiko et al.
used the term highways in a slightly different way than we do:
For Beiko et al., highways could exist not only between two
species but also between two clades of the species tree, i.e. their
highways are formed by a collection of many individual HGTs
spanning two clades.) These highways point towards major
events in evolutionary history; well corroborated examples are
the uptake of endosymbionts into the eukaryotic host, and the
many genes transferred from the symbiont to the host’s nuclear
genome (Gary, 1993). Recent proposals for evolutionary events
that may be reﬂected in highways are the role of Chlamydiae in
establishing the primary plastid in the Archaeplastida (red and
green algae, plants and glaucocystophytes) (Becker et al., 2008;
Huang and Gogarten, 2007; Moustafa et al., 2008), the evolution
of double membrane bacteria through an endosymbiosis between
clostridia and actinobacteria (Lake, 2009) and the high rate of
transfer between marine Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus
(Zhaxybayeva et al., 2006, 2009a).

In this work, we introduce a fast and accurate method for
highway inference. Given a rooted species tree, any two species
(nodes) in it that are not related by an ancestor—descendant re-
lationship deﬁne a horizontal edge connecting those two nodes.

Any HGT event must take place along a horizontal edge in one
of its two directions. A horizontal edge along which an unusually
large number of HGT events have taken place will be called a
highway of gene sharing or simply a highway. Although it is hard
to give a precise threshold that would designate an edge as a
highway, any horizontal edge that contains a markedly higher
number of HGTs than would be expected by chance for that
dataset can be viewed as a highway. In our simulation studies,
we deﬁned highways to be those horizontal edges that affect at
least 5% of the genes with a history of HGT. Beiko et al. (2005)
were the first to study the problem of highway inference (but see
also Kunin et al., 2005). They used a straightforward approach:
Given a set of gene trees and a trusted species tree, they com-
puted the history of HGT events for each gene tree separately
and then combined the results across all gene trees. The horizon-
tal edges that are inferred in the HGT scenarios for a signiﬁcant
fraction of the gene trees are the postulated highways. Thus, their
solution relies on inferring the individual HGT events by solving
the HGT-inference problem. This is problematic for several rea-
sons: First, the HGT-inference problem itself is NP-hard under
most formulations, and thus, difﬁcult to solve exactly. Second,
there are often multiple (and sometimes exponentially many)
optimal solutions to the HGT-inference problem (Beiko et al.,
2005; Than et al., 2007). And third, when the gene tree has only a
subset of the taxa present in the species tree, the placement of the
inferred HGTs on the species trees becomes ambiguous.
Furthermore, when the rate of HGT is relatively high, the
number of HGT events need not be parsimonious; i.e. the
HGT-inference problem, even if solved exactly and yielding
only one optimal solution, may not infer the actual HGT
events. HGT events can also be inferred using a more sophisti-
cated reconciliation framework that explicitly accounts for gene
duplication and loss events in addition to HGT events (Doyon
et al., 2010; Toﬁgh et al., 2011). Since such a framework is able
to explicitly consider duplication and loss events, it can handle
gene trees that have multiple gene copies per species; in the ap-
proach of Beiko et al. (2005), as well as in our approach, gene
trees are restricted to contain at most one copy of a gene per
species. However, the same drawbacks (discussed above) that
affect the HGT-inference problem apply to the more sophisti-
cated framework as well (Toﬁgh et al., 2011).

Recently, we introduced a novel polynomial time algorithm to
detecting highways that bypasses the need to infer individual
HGT events (Bansal et al., 2011). The method is based on the
observation that highways, by deﬁnition, affect the topologies of
many gene trees. Thus, the idea is to combine the phylogenetic
signals for HGT events from all the gene trees and use the com-
bined signal to infer the highways. This is achieved by using
quartet decomposition: The method decomposes each gene tree
into its constituent set of quartet trees and combines the quartet
trees from all the gene trees to obtain a single weighted set of
quartet trees. The combined set of quartet trees is then analysed
against the given species tree to infer the highways. The intuition
is that quartet trees that disagree with the species tree may indi-
cate HGT events and thus the collective evidence from all quartet
trees could pinpoint possible highways.

In this work, we propose an alternative method based on quar-
tet decomposition to detect highways, which greatly improves
upon the accuracy, noise tolerance and applicability of the

method of Bansal et al. (2011). Our method differs from the
approach of Bansal et al. (2011) in many important ways:
(i) we analyse the quartet decomposition of each gene tree sep-
arately before combining the results across all gene trees, (ii) we
propose a new way to assign scores to horizontal edges, which is
sensitive to the direction of transfer of individual HGT events and
(iii) we show how to reduce the amount of noise in the computed
scores in order to pinpoint highways even more accurately. As we
demonstrate using extensive simulations, compared with the ap-
proach of Bansal et al. (2011), our new method is signiﬁcantly
more accurate, much more robust to high rates of HGT and noise
and is able to seamlessly handle gene trees with many missing
taxa. For example, in simulated 50-taxon datasets with 1000
genes, a highway of 100 genes and 2000 random HGTs (‘noise’),
the new method identiﬁes the correct highway in 98% of the
cases, compared with <30% for the old method. It is worth men-
tioning that quartets have been previously used for phylogenetic
analyses in other contexts; for example for phylogeny construc-
tion (Strimmer and von Haeseler, 1996), supertrees (Snir and
Rao, 2010) or analysis of HGTs (Zhaxybayeva et al., 2006).

Two methods, EEEP (Beiko et al., 2005; Beiko and Hamilton,
2006) and Prunier (Abby et al., 2010), exist for inferring HGT
events on unrooted gene trees. These methods were not designed
for inferring highways but can be used indirectly for doing so
(as in Beiko et al., 2005). Our quartet-based approach offers
important advantages over approaches based on inferring
HGT events: (i) We do not face the problem of dealing with
multiple optimal solutions for the HGT-inference problem, (ii)
we can seamlessly incorporate gene trees with only a subset of
taxa, which is difﬁcult to do effectively with HGT-inference
methods and (iii) our method is signiﬁcantly more scalable and
time efﬁcient than both EEEP and Prunier. In general, inferring
highways based on HGT-inference methods can be slow and
technically complex. Our method simpliﬁes the process of detect-
ing and inferring highways. As our simulation study shows, our
method is also accurate.

We also applied the method to a dataset of 144 taxa and 22
430 gene trees from Beiko et al. (2005). Our results are largely
consistent with previous analyses of this dataset, and the entire
computational analysis of this large dataset took <2 days (using
a single CPU). Our new method thus makes it possible to easily,
quickly and accurately infer highways even for large datasets as
well as on datasets with high rates of HGT. We have imple-
mented our method into a freely available software package
called HiDe (short for Highway Detection). HiDe is, to the
best of our knowledge, the only available software package de-
signed speciﬁcally to address the problem of inferring highways.

2 BASIC DEFINITIONS AND NOTATION

We follow the basic deﬁnitions and notation from Bansal et al.
(2011). Given a rooted or unrooted tree T, we denote its node,
edge and leaf sets by V(T), E(T) and Le(T), respectively. Given a
rooted tree T, the root node of T is denoted by rt(T), the parent
of a node v e V(T) is denoted by paT(v), its set of children by
ChT(v) and the (maximal) subtree of T rooted at v by T (v). We
deﬁne 3T to be the partial order on V(T) where u 3T v, if v is a
node on the path between rt(T) and u. Throughout this work the
term tree refers to a binary tree.

Systematic inference of highways of HGT

 

Given a rooted tree T, a horizontal edge on T is a pair of nodes
{14, v}, where u, v e V(T), such that u, v 75 rt(T), u fT v, v fT u
and paT(u) 75 paT(v). We denote by H(T) the set of all horizontal
edges on T. Horizontal edges represent potential HGT events;
the (directed) horizontal arc (u, v) represents the HGT event that
transfers genetic material from the species represented by edge
(paT(u),u) to the species represented by edge (paT(v), v). Thus,
the (undirected) horizontal edge {a, v} represents the HGT events
(u,v) and (v,u). We deﬁne horizontal edges to be undirected
because highways can be responsible for transfer of genetic
material in both directions (we elaborate more on this later).
Note that our approach does not use a timed reference tree
and therefore allows for the detection of HGT events from
extinct or unsampled lineages. Only HGT events from extinct
or unsampled lineages that would lead to transfers between
ancestor and descendant are excluded.

A quartet is a four-element subset of some leaf set and a
quartet tree is an unrooted tree whose leaf set is a quartet. The
quartet tree with leaf set {a, b, c, a’} is denoted by ablca’ if the path
from a to b does not intersect the path from c to a’. Given a
rooted or unrooted tree T, let X be a subset of Le(T) and let T[A1
denote the minimal subtree of T having X as its leaf set. We
deﬁne the restriction of T to X, denoted T |X , to be the unrooted
tree obtained from T[A1 by suppressing all degree-two nodes
(including the root, if T is rooted). We say that a quartet tree
Q is consistent with a tree T if Q = T |Le(Q), otherwise Q is
inconsistent with T. Thus, for example, in Supplementary
Figure S2, the quartet tree ablce is consistent with the species
tree and with the Gene-l tree but inconsistent with the Gene-2
tree. Observe that, given any T and any quartet X: {a, b, c, a’}
from Le(T), X induces exactly one quartet tree in T, that is, the
quartet tree T |X . Also observe that this quartet tree must have
one of three possible topologies: ablca’, aclba’ or aa’lbc.

3 DETECTING HIGHWAYS

We wish to detect the highways of gene sharing in the evolution-
ary history of a set of species S. The input to our method is a set
of unrooted gene trees G1, . . . , Gk, and a rooted species tree S on
S. The highway-detection problem can thus be stated as follows:
Given a species tree S and a collection of gene trees, ﬁnd the
horizontal edges on S that are most likely to correspond to high-
ways. The idea is to infer highways by inspecting the differences
in the topologies of the gene trees compared with the species tree.

As in Bansal et al. (2011), our solution to the highway-detec-
tion problem is based on decomposing each input gene tree T

into its constituent set of ('Leim) quartet trees. The basic idea is

that, in general, different HGT events produce gene trees with
different sets of inconsistent quartet trees. Thus, given an incon-
gruent gene tree and the species tree, one can infer the HGT
events responsible for the incongruence by looking at the set of
inconsistent quartets. An example is depicted in Supplementary
Figure S2.

3.1 Description of the method

Our method uses quartet decomposition to calculate, for each
gene tree, its support for the different horizontal edges on S. For
each horizontal edge, the support values are then aggregated

across all gene trees to obtain the total support for that horizon-
tal edge. In contrast, the method of Bansal et al. (2011) ﬁrst
combines the quartet decomposition from each gene tree into a
single weighted set of quartet trees and then computes the total
support for each horizontal edge based on that single weighted
set. Considering the quartet decomposition for each gene tree
separately allows us to take into account the direction of transfer
of any individual gene transferred along a horizontal edge, and
also allows for the proper handling of gene trees having missing
taxa. Formally, the method is as follows:

(1) For each input gene tree G,, for l g i g k,

1(a): Decompose G,- into its constituent set CD,- of (Imam)
quartet trees.

1(b): Remove from CD,- all quartet trees that are consistent
with S or that can be explained by a previously
inferred highway.

1(c): For each horizontal edge {a, v} e H(S), compute the
normalized score NS({u, v}, (1),). This step is explained
in more detail below.

(2) For each horizontal edge {a, v} e H(S), compute its ﬁnal
score, denoted score{u, v}, to be 2:1 NS({u, v}, (1),).

(3) Select the highest scoring horizontal edge as a highway.

By iterating this procedure several times, multiple highways
can be found. The normalized score NS({u, v}, (1),) captures the
support of the gene tree G,- for an HGT event along the horizon-
tal edge {a, v}, adequately corrected for the relative impact of the
evidence for that edge from 6D,. This is done as follows. We ﬁrst
compute the raw scores RS((u, v), (1),) and RS((v,u), (1),) of the
two HGT events (a, v) and (v, u) that constitute {a, v}. The raw
score of HGT event (a, v) with respect to (13,-, denoted
RS((u, v), (1),), is deﬁned to be the number of quartet trees from
CD,- [after Step l(b)] that can be explained by the HGT event (a, v).
Thus, the raw score of an HGT event captures the number of
quartet trees, from the gene tree under consideration, that sup-
port that HGT event. However, not all horizontal gene transfers
would affect the same number of quartets from the gene tree
under consideration. [For instance, in the example from
Supplementary Figure S2, the HGT event (C, E) causes four of
the quartet trees in the corresponding gene tree to become in-
consistent, while the HGT event (b, c) that transfers Gene-2
causes 10 of the quartet trees in the gene tree to become incon-
sistent.]. To overcome this bias, we modify the raw score of each
HGT event by dividing it by a normalization factor: the
maximum number of distinct quartet trees that could be
explained by that HGT event. More precisely, let 11!, be the set
of all possible quartet trees on the leaf set Le(Gi). Given an HGT
event (a, v), let Q,- denote the set of quartet trees in III,- that
can be explained by that HGT event. The normalization
factor for (u, v), with respect to (13,-, is deﬁned to be |Q,|.
The normalized score of HGT event (a, v) with respect to CD,- is
denoted by NS((u, v), (1),). The normalized score of the
horizontal edge {a, v} with respect to (I), is deﬁned as
NS({u, v}, c1),.) = max{NS((u, v), c1),), NS((v, u), cI>,')}. The intuition
here is that we expect any given gene to have been transferred
along only one of the two HGT events along that highway.

M.S.Bansal et al.

 

Thus, our method computes, for each horizontal edge, the sum
of the normalized support scores from each input gene tree, and
reports the horizontal edge with the highest total score as a high-
way edge. In contrast with the approach of Bansal et al. (2011),
which normalizes the computed raw scores only after the data
from all the gene trees have been combined, our method normal-
izes the score for each gene tree separately before combining the
scores. We will refer to the original method of Bansal et al. (2011)
as the Global Normalization method, and the current method as
the Per-Gene Normalization {PG-Norm) method. Our PG—Norm
method is more sensitive to the direction of transfer of any indi-
vidual gene and, furthermore, makes it possible to use gene trees
with many missing taxa.

Observe that the value NS({u, v}, (1),), for any given horizontal
edge {a, v} and any gene tree G,, must lie between 0 and l. The
higher the value of NS({u, v}, (1),), the higher the support from
gene tree G,- for an HGT along {a, v}. Note, however, that a given
inconsistent quartet tree could be explained by several different
HGT events on S. Thus, even if the gene corresponding to gene
tree G,- was not transferred along {a, v}, the value of NS({u, v}, (1),)
need not be zero since (u, v) or (v, u) could explain some of the
inconsistent quartet trees from other HGT events. Such ambigu-
ity (or noise) may confound the true solution. One possible way
to overcome this noise is to ignore or to decrease the weight
of smaller NS(-, -) values. To test this, we developed two variants
of the regular PG—Norm method. In the ﬁrst variant, we
modify Step 2 of the method by setting score{u, v} to be
2:1 (NS({u, v}, <I>,))p, for some small p Z l (in our experiments
we used p = 2, 4). We refer to this variant as the
PG—Norm—Exp { p ) method. The regular PG—Norm method is
the same as PG—Norm—Exp(l). In the second variant, we
modify Step 2 of the method by including only those terms in
the sum for score{u, v} whose value is at least equal to some cut-
off value p, for 0 g p g 1. We refer to this variant as the
PG—Norm—Cut-oﬂ{ p ) method. The regular PG—Norm method is
the same as PG—Norm—Cut-off(0).

3.2 Complexity and running time

We rely on the algorithms of Bansal et al. (2011) for quartet
decomposition of gene trees and for computing the raw and
normalized scores of all HGT events on the species tree with
respect to any given set of quartet trees. These algorithms can
be directly used for implementing the PG—Norm method (and its
variants) as follows. Let G1, ...,Gk denote the collection of
input gene trees, S denote the species tree and n denote the
number of taxa in S. Consider the time complexity of Steps
1(a) to 1(c) of the PG—Norm method, for any given gene tree
G,: Based on the algorithms from Bansal et al. (2011), Steps 1(a)

and 1(b) can be implemented to run in 0((lLegGi)')) time, and
Step 1(c) requires 0((lLegGi)l)+n2) time. Step 2, for any of the

PG—Norm variants, requires 0(kn2) time. Thus, each iteration of
the PG—Norm method (or its variants) requires

0(f  weft“) + 112)) time overall.

i:1

In practice, the fast algorithms for PG—Norm make it possible
to analyse datasets with hundreds of taxa and thousands of gene
trees. For example, we can analyse datasets with 1000 input gene

trees each and having 50, 100 and 200 taxa, in <15 min, 5 h and 3
days, respectively. In comparison, the method of Bansal et al.
(2011) (i.e., the Global Normalization method), on those same
datasets, takes about 2 min, 1 h and 13 h, respectively. The
drastic improvement in the solution quality of our method thus
comes at the expense of only a 5—7-fold reduction in speed. This
reduction in speed occurs because our method must compute the
scores for each horizontal edge separately for each gene tree,
while the Global Normalization method does so only once
with the combined set of quartet trees. To compare the running
time, we also ran two HGT-detection programs, EEEP (Beiko
and Hamilton, 2006) (in its fastest setting) and the program
Prunier (Abby et al., 2010), on 10 randomly chosen datasets of
50 and 100 taxa each (with 1000 gene trees, 4000 noise level), and
the results are given in Supplementary Table S1. The experiments
show that our method is dramatically faster and signiﬁcantly
more scalable than both EEEP and Prunier. All timed experi-
ments were run on a single core of an Intel Xeon 5160 CPU
running at 3 GHz with 8 GB of RAM. The memory require-
ments of our algorithms are also low, as they can be controlled
by partitioning the set of quartet trees from any gene tree into
subsets that ﬁt into the cache memory, computing the support
for each subset to each horizontal edge, and summarizing the
results.

3.3 Dealing with uncertainty in gene tree topologies

Our method makes it easy to deal with uncertainty in gene tree
topologies: Each gene tree may be represented by a collection of
possible trees (e.g., bootstrap replicates or samples from a
Bayesian posterior distribution) and only those quartet trees
that are supported by at least a certain fraction (say 70%) of
the trees are included in the quartet decomposition for that gene
tree. This ability to deal cleanly and robustly with phylogenetic
uncertainty is one of the key strengths of our method.

4 RESULTS

4.1 Performance evaluation

We used simulations to test the performance of the algorithm in
various scenarios. In the basic simulation setup, each simulated
dataset consisted of a random species tree on 50 taxa generated
under a Yule process using the tool TreeSample (Hartmann
et al., 2010), and 1000 gene trees generated as follows. We ran-
domly chose a highway on the species tree, and randomly as-
signed 10% of the 1000 genes as having been transferred along
this highway, with equal probability for each transfer direction.
Next, we simulated ‘noise’ as additional single-gene HGT events.
For each event, the horizontal edge and direction were selected
randomly and independently, and the affected gene was selected
at random. Selection was done with replacement, from the set of
all gene trees (including those genes that were transferred on the
highway). We varied the level of noise from 0 to 6000 random
HGTs, in increments of 500. For each noise level, we created 50
different datasets (different species trees) and in each set com-
puted the scores of all horizontal edges and the rank of the
implanted highway among them. These simulation parameters
correspond well to real data (see Section 5).

Systematic inference of highways of HGT

 

4.1.] Comparison of PG-Norm and the Global Normalization
algorithm We ﬁrst tested the ability of the different PG-
Norm variants to correctly recover implanted highways in
datasets generated using the basic simulation setup. For
PG—Norm—Exp(p), we performed preliminary experiments with
p = 2,4 and observed that PG—Norm—Exp(2) greatly outper-
formed PG—Norm—Exp(4). For PG—Norm—Cut-off(p), we tried
p = 02,04, 0.6,0.8,0.95 and observed that PG—Norm—Cut-
off(0.4) gave the best performance (see Supplementary Figs S3
and S4). We therefore focused on the best parameter value for
each variant.

Figure 1 shows the relative performance of the Global
Normalization method of Bansal et al. (2011), PG—Norm,
PG—Norm—Exp(2) and PG—Norm—Cut—off(0.4) on the simulated
datasets. It is immediately obvious that PG—Norm and its vari-
ants dramatically outperform Global Normalization, both in
terms of accuracy and tolerance to noise; for instance, at a
noise level of 2500 HGTs, Global Normalization is able to
detect the implanted highway as its top-scoring edge in only
6% of the instances, while for PG—Norm and PG—Norm—Exp(2)
the corresponding numbers are 88% and 100%, respectively
(Fig. la). Among PG—Norm variants, PG—Norm—Exp(2) shows
the best performance overall (Fig. 1). Indeed, even with high
levels of noise, PG—Norm—Exp(2) is able to detect the implanted
highway among its top few highest-scoring edges. We thus chose
PG—Norm—Exp(2) to be our default method, and all our subse-
quent experiments, both on simulated as well as real data, were
performed using PG—Norm—Exp(2).

Note that, for high levels of noise, our method does not always
rank the implanted highway as the highest scoring (Fig. la). This
suggests that, in datasets with high levels of HGT, it could be
misleading to blindly interpret the highest scoring edge to be a
true highway. Still, as our results on the top-ﬁve highest scoring
edges show (Fig. lb), the true highway is usually ranked close to
the top. Indeed, the average ranks of the implanted highway in
the datasets with 4000 and 5000 HGTs are 1.34 and 4, respect-
ively. This can be extremely valuable when trying to infer high-
ways in such difﬁcult datasets, as it can provide independent

simulations for each noise level

evidence to either support or refute highways inferred by apply-
ing other methods to the dataset. It also makes it possible to
narrow down the list of candidate highways to just the top few
highest scoring edges, which can then be investigated in more
detail using other biological knowledge.

It is worth mentioning that the noise tolerance of our method
improves as the number of taxa in the dataset increases. For
instance, the performance of our method on datasets with 75
taxa and 7500 random HGTs is better that its performance on
the 50 taxa datasets with 6000 random HGTs (results not
shown). This is not unexpected, as the same number of HGT
events, when applied to a larger tree, would be spread more
thinly.

To assess the effects of phylogenetic reconstruction inaccuracy
on its performance, we also applied our method to datasets con-
sisting of gene trees reconstructed from simulated sequence data,
and observed that the accuracy of our method was only minim-
ally affected. Further details appear in Section S.l in the supple-
ment. We also compared against the program EEEP (Beiko and
Hamilton, 2006) and observed that it was effective at inferring
highways on these datasets in spite of over a third of the EEEP
runs terminating without a valid solution. Further details appear
in Section S4 in the Supplementary Material.

4.1.2 Highway width Next, we tested the impact of HGT abun-
dance and noise on the ability to infer highways of different
widths. The width of a highway is the fraction of genes trans-
ferred along it. Figure 2 shows the results of our method for
different highway widths and different noise levels. Once again,
we see that our method is highly effective at accurately detecting
large and medium sized highways (15% and 10% of genes trans-
ferred) in datasets with even high levels of noise. For example, at
10% width and a noise level of 4500 random HGTs, our method
detected the implanted highways as the highest scoring edge in
70% and among the top ﬁve edges in 92% of the test cases.
Performance improves even further when the implanted high-
ways are wider (15% transferred genes). The results also demon-
strate the ability of our method to detect small highways (5% of
genes transferred) in datasets with fairly high levels of noise; at a
noise level of 2500 random HGTs, we detected the implanted

small highways as the highest scoring edge in 60%, and among
the top ﬁve edges in 92% of the test cases.

4.1.3 Incomplete gene trees In practice, one may encounter
datasets where many of the gene trees do not contain genes from
all the species considered in the analysis. To test the effect of such
incomplete gene trees on highway inference, we modiﬁed the
datasets from our basic simulation to create datasets in which
the gene trees had only a fraction of their original leaf set.
Speciﬁcally, we created three datasets where we restricted each
gene tree to 40, 30 and 20 out of its 50 leaves, respectively, and a
fourth dataset where the gene tree sizes were normally distributed
with mean 30 and SD 7. In each case, the leaves to be removed
from any gene tree were chosen randomly. Not surprisingly, per-
formance decreases as the number of missing leaves increases.
Still, as Supplementary Figure S5 shows, our method can be
effective even for datasets where most of the gene trees have a
high fraction of missing leaves when the rate of HGT and/or
noise is not very high. For example, at a noise level of 2000
HGTs, our method detects the implanted as the highest scoring
edge in 100% and 42% of the cases in the ﬁrst two datasets,
respectively, and in 42% of the cases in the fourth dataset.
Performance deteriorates signiﬁcantly for the third dataset, in
which the gene trees contain only 20 leaves each. We point out
that our incomplete gene trees, with leaves pruned at random,
present a greater challenge to our quartet-based algorithm than
incomplete gene trees with leaves drawn from a particular species
tree clade.

4.1.4 Multiple highways We went on to test the ability of our
method to detect multiple highways. We used the basic simula-
tion setup, except that we implanted three highways, each re-
sponsible for transferring randomly chosen 10% of the genes
(a gene may be transferred on several highways). For each data-
set we checked (i) how many of the three implanted highways
were detected as the highest scoring edge in three iterations of the
algorithm, and (ii) how many of the three implanted highways
were detected among the top three edges from each iteration. To
run the second and third iterations of the algorithm, we removed
the quartet trees corresponding to the highest scoring edge from
each previous iteration (even if that edge was not the implanted
highway). Although detecting multiple highways is harder, the
results, shown in Figure 3, demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method in this scenario. For instance, at a noise level of 3500
random HGTs and considering the top three edges from each
iteration, we always ﬁnd at least one implanted highway, ﬁnd at
least two implanted highways 90% of the time and all three
highways in >40% of the cases. We also repeated the above
experiment with wider 15% highways; as expected, performance
improves with wider highways (see Supplementary Fig. S6).

4.1.5 Number of highways in a dataset Since the number of
highways in a dataset is not known a priori, how does one
decide if the highest scoring edge does in fact represent a high-
way? This can be done by studying a histogram of the edge scores
reported by the method. As we demonstrate later in our analysis
of the biological dataset, highways tend to be well separated
from the rest of the edges in terms of their edge scores (see,
e.g. Supplementary Fig. S8). This makes it possible to infer
the presence and estimate the number of highways. A similar

4.2 An application to biological data

We applied our method to a large biological dataset of prokary-
otes studied by Beiko et al. (2005). The dataset contains 144 taxa
and 22 430 gene trees. To deal with uncertainty in gene tree
topologies, we represented each of the 22 430 gene trees by a
collection of 100 trees sampled from a Bayesian posterior distri-
bution. For each gene family, we then considered only those
quartet trees that were present in at least some predeﬁned frac-
tion of the 100 representatives. Thus, we only used highly sup-
ported quartet trees in our analysis. We used the 16S rRNA tree
of Beiko et al. (2005) as our species tree.

Most of the gene trees in the dataset had few leaves. For ex-
ample, among the 22 430 gene trees, only 130 had 100 taxa or
more, 396 had at least 50 taxa and 1319 had 25 or more taxa. As
we observed in our experiments with simulated incomplete gene
trees, it is desirable, in general, to have gene trees with as many
taxa as possible in the analysis. We therefore decided to use a
cut-off value for the minimum number of leaves in the gene tree.
To select the values of the quartet support cut-off and the min-
imum gene tree size cut-off, we ran our method using all possible
combinations of the two parameters. We considered values of 80,
70 and 60% for the quartet support cut-off and 100, 50, 25 and 0
(i.e. no cut-off) for the minimum gene tree leaf set size.
Supplementary Table S2 shows the results of this analysis. In
general, results were remarkably consistent across the different
quartet support cut-off values. Results were also largely consist-
ent across the gene tree leaf set size cut-off values 100, 50 and 25.
With cut-off value 0, >20 000 new gene trees are introduced into
the analysis, and the results change, but even then two of the
three highways were the same as the ones obtained with the
higher cut-off values. Based on this analysis, we chose a quartet
cut-off value of 80% and gene tree leaf set size cut-off of 25 for
subsequent analysis.

Even with the added time complexity of performing quartet
decomposition on 100 sampled trees—instead of just one—per
gene family, each iteration of our method (i.e. each highway
inference) required <6 h on the entire 22 430 gene tree dataset

Systematic inference of highways of HGT

 

(using a single core on a 2.33 GHz quad-core Xeon 5410 CPU
with 16 GB of RAM). We also tried to run the HGT-detection
method EEEP (Beiko and Hamilton, 2006) used by Beiko et al.
(2005), on just the 130 gene trees that had at least 100 taxa (with
each gene tree being represented by just one bootstrap replicate),
and using the fastest version of the heuristic search [we used the
strict reference tree ratchet (Beiko and Hamilton, 2006)]. The
analysis still required >75 h, and only 66 of the 130 runs termi-
nated successfully, with the remaining runs crashing owing to
excessive memory requirements.

The presence of highways in a dataset can be inferred from the
distribution of the reported horizontal edge scores. A histogram
of the horizontal edge scores reported by the ﬁrst iteration of the
method on our biological dataset is given in Supplementary
Figure S8. A vast majority of the horizontal edges receive a
low edge score (99.87% of the edges have a score <20 and
only 6 out of the 37 418 candidate horizontal edges have a
score >50), and the high-scoring edges are well-separated from
the remaining edges in terms of their scores (the highest-scoring
edge has a score of 83.3). By constructing histograms of the
horizontal edge scores for successive iterations of the algorithm,
we inferred that the dataset consists of at least ﬁve highways.
Figure 4 shows these top ﬁve inferred highways. Most of the
highways identiﬁed by our approach correspond to ones also
discussed in Beiko et al. (2005). Similar to these authors, we
ﬁnd most of the transfers inside the Gamma proteobacteria,

Fig. 4. Results on the dataset of Beiko et al. (2005) The top ﬁve high-
ways, along with their ranks, computed by the method are marked in red
(bold edges). The reported scores for these top ﬁve highways are 83.3,
52.5, 42.9, 35.1 and 24.3. Since the top ﬁve highways are each within the
gamma proteobacteria, the ﬁgure focuses on only that portion of the
phylogeny (we refer the reader to Supplementary Figure S9 for a ﬁgure
showing the full phylogeny). The tree was drawn using Dendroscope
(Huson et al., 2007)

e.g. Beiko et al. identiﬁed >175 transfers between an ancestor
of Yersinia pestis and a common ancestor of Escherichia coli plus
Salmonella (fourth highway in Fig. 4). Beiko et al. comment that
the number of transfers identiﬁed between close relatives is an
underestimation because transfers between sister taxa do not
generate a phylogenetic signal that can be detected using biparti-
tions (used in Beiko et al., 2005) or quartets. However, although
many of the within-species transfers between different E. coli and
Shigella strains may correspond to actual gene flow within the
species (Dykhuizen and Green, 1991), we think that some of the
identiﬁed transfers within the gamma proteobacteria might also
be due to uncertainty in the reference tree. For example, genes
from the insect endosymbionts (Wigglesworthia and Buchnera)
have many shared sequence characteristics that might have ori-
ginated through convergent evolution and might not reﬂect
shared ancestry. The transfer that repositions Buchnera and
Wigglesworthia as a deeper branch (ﬁrst highway in Fig. 4)
likely is due to phylogenetic uncertainty and may not represent
an actual highway of gene transfer. The same phylogenetic con-
ﬂict was observed by Lerat et al. (2003): The tree after transfer
corresponds to the maximum likelihood (ML) tree for concate-
nated proteins reported in Lerat et al. (2003), and our reference
tree corresponds to the 16S ML tree in Lerat et al. (2003). Lerat
et al. (2003) found that the difference between these two topol-
ogies was not signiﬁcant for most protein families when analysed
using the SH-test (Shimodaira and Hasegawa, 1999).

Since all of the top highway candidates reported by our
method were within the gamma proteobacteria, we also looked
for highway candidates from outside of the gamma proteobac-
teria. The top scoring highways of gene sharing identiﬁed outside
the gamma proteobacteria are shown in Supplementary
Figure S9, and include a highway between Synechococcus and
ProchlorococcusMIT. The reference tree considers Prochlo-
rococcus as monophyletic, a grouping that is supported by the
many shared derived characteristics of Prochlorococcus, includ-
ing the use of chlorophyll b as an antenna pigment in the light
harvesting machinery, and the absence of phycobilisomes (see
Zhaxybayeva et al., 2006 for extended discussion). This highway
was also identiﬁed by Beiko et al. (2005) and appears to be due to
continued gene transfer between marine Synecchococcus and low
light-adapted Prochloroccus ssp. (Zhaxybayeva et al., 2009a),
likely mediated by cyanophage (Zeidner et al., 2005).

5 DISCUSSION

In this work, we presented a new and improved method for sys-
tematically detecting highways of gene sharing. As shown in the
simulation study, our method is highly accurate, and robust to
noise and high rates of HGT. Our analysis of the 144 taxa, 22
430 gene tree dataset of Beiko et al. (2005) demonstrates the
utility of our method in identifying potential highways, even in
large datasets.

Our simulation parameters correspond well to real data. In the
dataset of Beiko et al. (2005), only ~5000 HGTs, including sev-
eral highways of size 100—500, are reported on the entire dataset
of ~20 000 gene trees. Our experiments show (see Section S2 in
the supplement) that by distributing the same number of HGTs
across more gene trees, the performance of the method is un-
affected and may even slightly improve. Our simulation scenarios

have a comparable or smaller highway size (50—150 HGTs), a
comparable or higher noise level (1000—6000 random HGTs) and
less gene trees (1000). As the number of taxa that we use is
smaller (50 versus 144), the random HGTs are less spread in
our case, which again makes our scenario harder as we observed
in Section 4.1.1. Hence, the simulations present a scenario that is
as difﬁcult or harder than the real data in each of the parameters.
The numbers of genes in our highways correspond well to other
highways characterized in the literature, e.g. in Thermotogales
(Zhaxybayeva et al., 2009b) and in Aquiﬁcales (Boussau et al.,
2008).

Highways represent major shifts from the pattern of vertical
inheritance, and their detection is crucial for correctly represent-
ing the evolutionary history of prokaryotes. Indeed, a logical
ﬁrst-step towards building a comprehensive phylogenetic
network for the prokaryotes (Kunin et al., 2005; Williams
et al., 2011) is to start with the ribosomal tree as backbone
and augment it with highways. By making it easy to quickly
and accurately detect such highways, our method represents an
important step towards building the prokaryotic net of life.

As with the method of Bansal et al. (2011), our new method is
based on quartet decomposition. However, we use quartet
decomposition in a different way and, as a result of this and
other methodological improvements, our method achieves far
better results and greatly improves upon its accuracy,
noise-tolerance and applicability. Still, our method has several
limitations. It makes use of the parsimony principle, and if a
dataset contains two highways that are closely related to one
another then the method may only detect one of them (as
many of the inconsistent quartet trees from one highway may
also support the other highway). Formulating the highway-de-
tection problem in a probabilistic framework could help improve
the accuracy of highway detection. Also, a statistical analysis of
highway and HGT score distributions could help provide more
quantiﬁable signiﬁcance of the computed highways, which we
currently lack. Our method is unable to detect HGTs between
two sister species (i.e. two species that have the same parent), a
limitation shared by all existing phylogenetic methods for study-
ing HGT (but see Toﬁgh, 2009). Our analysis of the dataset of
Beiko et al. suggests that, as with all previous methods, our
method is vulnerable to errors in the species tree, and that
such errors can manifest themselves as highways in the analysis.
Extending the method to deal cleanly with uncertainty in the
species tree topology would help to pinpoint highways more
accurately. It would also be interesting to study how convergent
gene losses in unrelated taxa (e.g., species that have independ-
ently converged to parasitic lifestyles) affect our method. Finally,
it may help to distinguish between directed and undirected high-
ways of gene sharing (see Section S3 in the supplement).

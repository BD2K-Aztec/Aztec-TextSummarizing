Abstract

Motivation: In any macromolecular polyprotic system—for example protein, DNA or RNA—the iso-
electric point—commonly referred to as the pl—can be defined as the point of singularity in a titra-
tion curve, corresponding to the solution pH value at which the net overall surface charge—and
thus the electrophoretic mobility—of the ampholyte sums to zero. Different modern analytical bio-
chemistry and proteomics methods depend on the isoelectric point as a principal feature for pro-
tein and peptide characterization. Protein separation by isoelectric point is a critical part of 2-D gel
electrophoresis, a key precursor of proteomics, where discrete spots can be digested in-gel, and
proteins subsequently identified by analytical mass spectrometry. Peptide fractionation according
to their pl is also widely used in current proteomics sample preparation procedures previous to the
LC-MS/MS analysis. Therefore accurate theoretical prediction of plwould expedite such analysis.
While such pl calculation is widely used, it remains largely untested, motivating our efforts to
benchmark pl prediction methods.

Results: Using data from the database PIP-DB and one publically available dataset as our reference
gold standard, we have undertaken the benchmarking of pl calculation methods. We find that
methods vary in their accuracy and are highly sensitive to the choice of basis set. The machine-
Iearning algorithms, especially the SVM-based algorithm, showed a superior performance when
studying peptide mixtures. In general, learning-based pl prediction methods (such as Cofactor,
SVM and Branca) require a large training dataset and their resulting performance will strongly
depend of the quality of that data. In contrast with Iterative methods, machine-learning algorithms
have the advantage of being able to add new features to improve the accuracy of prediction.

1 Introduction

In a titration curve, the isoelectric point (pI) is the value at which
the overall net surface charge of a macromolecular polyprotic spe-
cies equals zero. Protein pI values are amongst the most widely
determined and widely reported quantities in all of biochemistry
and proteomics. The pI is obtained as essentially incidental informa-
tion during isoelectric focusing (IEF) experiments, free ﬂow electro-
phoresis (FFE), capillary electrophoresis, and in-gel electrophoresis
experiments using IPG strips (Audain et al., 2014; Ramos et al.,
2008). Electrophoresis-based separation of proteins and peptides in
both free-flow and gel systems has been adapted to a wide variety of
proteomics platforms in order to reduce the complexity of the
studied proteome (Ramos et al., 2008, 2011). In addition to the
resolution and dynamic range of the fractionation technique, com-
bining the electrophoretic separation of proteins with mass spec-
trometry analysis provides an orthogonal analytical method for
improving protein identification in different workflows (Perez-
Riverol et al., 2013).

Assuming a protein to be denatured, theoretical calculation of the
pI is typically rapid, requiring only the sequence as input (Cargile et al.,
2004). Most techniques exploit tabulated pKa values for the different
ionizable amino acid residues; such values are assumed to be constant
regardless of structural context (Maldonado et al., 2010). Many au-
thors have reported different values for the pKas of protein side chains
and most of them are derived from measurements of side chains in iso-
lated amino acids or from model compounds; as well as values derived
from ionizable side chains in situ (Bjellqvist et al., 1993; Lengqvist
et al., 2011). As many such alternative theoretical methods have been
proposed, the calculation of protein pI values is in urgent need of
benchmarking, since its accuracy remains largely untested. Extant com-
parison has been exiguous, using very small datasets (Patrickios and
Yamasaki, 1995), peptides rather than proteins (Cargile et al., 2004;
Lengqvist et al., 2011) or has reported poor accuracy (Henriksson
et al., 1995; Patrickios and Yamasaki, 1995).

We have previously described the database PIP-DB (Bunkute
et al., 2015), a collection of proteins, with associated experimentally
determined pI values, as collated from the literature (Bunkute et al.,
2015). In this paper, we use PIP-DB as a gold standard reference for
comparison, and describe the benchmarking of protein pI predic-
tion. We also include a peptide dataset to evaluate the performance
of pI prediction methods when estimating peptide pIs, due to the im-
portance of properly assessing the accuracy of such prediction. As
previously we combine different methods with different parameter
values. Specifically, we evaluated five isoelectric point prediction al-
gorithms: Iterative (Maldonado et al., 2010; Patrickios and
Yamasaki, 1995), Bjellquivst (Bjellqvist et al., 1993; Cargile et al.,
2008), Cofactor (Cargile et al., 2008), SVM (Perez-Riverol et al.,
2012) and Branca (Branca et al., 2014); using, where appropriate, a
set of alternate values for ionizable amino acid side chain pKas.

2 Methods

Five different isoelectric point prediction algorithms were evaluated:
Iterative (Maldonado et al., 2010; Patrickios and Yamasaki, 1995 ),
Bjellquivst (Bjellqvist et al., 1993; Cargile et al., 2008), Cofactor
(Cargile et al., 2008), SVM (Perez-Riverol et al., 2012) and Branca
(Branca et al., 2014). The iterative model only considers the contri-
bution of individual pK,1 values to the Henderson-Hasselbach equa-
tion (Patrickios and Yamasaki, 1995 ). The Bjellquivst (Bjellqvist
et al., 1993) algorithm is based on determining the pKa differences
between closely related amino acids, and it was the first algorithm

to propose a different pK,1 value depending on the amino acid pos-
ition in the sequence. The Cofactor algorithm (Cargile et al., 2008)
accounts for the effect of adjacent amino acids :3 residues away
from a charged aspartic or glutamic acid and the C-terminus, as well
as applying a correction term to the corresponding pK,1 values.
Perez-Riverol and co-workers (Perez-Riverol et al., 2012) proposed
a support vector machine approach to predict the isoelectric point of
peptides in electrophoretic experiments based on amino acid se-
quences and AAIndex properties. The Branca method (Branca et al.,
2014) uses pK,1 value correction considering the influence of neigh-
boring ionizable groups up to six residues away, multiplying each
correction factor by the charged fraction of the neighboring ioniz-
able group before applying it to the initial pK,1 value. It also intro-
duces the use of a statistical correction factor that depends on the
number and type (Asp or Glu) of carboxylic acid side chains in the
sequence.

Different pK,1 values were evaluated for each method: for the
iterative algorithm we include multiple pK,1 sets reported previously
(Supplementary Information, Table 1). The Bjellquivst method
was evaluated using different pK,1 correction factors for C- and N-
terminus (Calibrated (Gauci et al., 2008), Expasy (Gasteiger et al.,
2003), Skoog and default (Bjellqvist et al., 1993)). The algorithms
Cofactor and SVM were evaluated using the default values reported
in the corresponding publications. The Branca algorithm was used
with the ﬂag chonstants_plain set, and without considering add-
itional chemical modification in the polypeptide sequence (for ex-
ample, peptides derivatized with iTRAQ or TMT reagents).
Detailed information of each estimation method can be found in
Supplementary Information S1.

2.1 le R-package

To facilitate analysis of isoelectric point prediction for peptides and
proteins, an R package (pIR) was developed using standard best
practices for bioinformatics software development (Leprevost et al.,
2014; Perez-Riverol et al., 2014). It provides several datasets used in

the current study with the corresponding experimental and predicted
isoelectric point values. It also provides a framework for reprodu-
cible analysis, allowing correlation and RMSD analysis of the
predicted values; plot visualization and data processing (outlier
removal, null value detection). pIR was implemented in R ver-
sion 22.130 and is available from URL: https://github.com/ypri
verol/pIR.

2.2 Datasets

For the protein analysis, PIP-DB (Bunkute et al., 2015) (version 1.0),
which contains curated protein pI literature data, was used to deter-
mine the accuracy of isoelectric point calculation. All proteins where
sequence data was available were retrieved from PIP-DB with the
corresponding experimental isoelectric point.

For the peptide analysis, a previously published dataset was used
(Heller et al., 2005). We utilized the PeptideProphet score to filter
out low-confidence peptides from the dataset. In summary, a cellular
extract of Drosophila Kc167 cells was fractionated in an isoelectric
focusing Off-GEL device using 15 fractions. The tryptic proteome is
separated using the isoelectric point and the experimentally derived
pI values are reported with the final results. The identified peptides
were analyzed with two different database search engines, namely
PHENYX and SEQUEST, together with PeptideProphet, which is a
popular post-processing peptide identification tool: a final list of
6529 peptides were used for the present study (Heller et al., 2005 ).

In addition, we have analyzed the impact of common post-transla-
tional modifications on isoelectric point estimation using a third data-
set, as published previously by Gauci et al. (2008). This experimental
dataset was obtained using online Ti02 enrichment in combination
with in-gel peptide IEF of a Zebrafz'sh embryo lysate. It contains sub-
populations of phosphorylated and N—terminal acetylated peptides
whit the corresponding experimental pI values associated.

3 Results

3.1 lsoelectric point estimation of protein sequences

Initially, PIP-DB (Bunkute et al., 2015) was divided into two subsets:
proteins with several experimental pI values and proteins with a single
experimental pI value (called unique proteins hereafter). Figure 1

Fig. 1. Composition of isoelectric points from PIP-DB (2675 proteins) for the
two datasets: unique proteins (proteins with only one isoelectric point value,
1066 proteins); and non-unique proteins (proteins with two or more plexperi-
mental values, 1609). The chart shows the protein number versus pH distribu-
tion for both subsets (pH range 3.0—10)

shows the protein distribution by isoelectric point for both sets. The
second group (proteins with only one pI value) contains 1066 pro-
teins, most of which are from acid fractions (pH range 3.0—6 .0).

As PIP-DB contains legacy data, not all entries were deemed use-
ful. Initially, we isolated entries with a single measured isoelectric
point rather than entries with multiple pI values or a range of values.
Estimation of theoretical pI values was undertaken on the unique
protein subset. Pearson correlation coefficients and root-mean
square deviation (RMSD) values were used to evaluate the perform-
ance of the methods in predicting pI.

Table 1 summarizes the correlation coefficients and RMSD values
achieved for each evaluated algorithm. The overall correlation between
the experimental and theoretical pI values varied between R2 = 0.60
(Bjellquivst—Expasy pKa set) and R2 = 0.15 (Iterative-Patrickios pKa
set). The lowest RMSD value was for the SVM algorithm
(RMSD = 1.28). Most of the algorithms performed poorly when pre-
dicting protein pI, with a correlation coefficient between 0.55 and 0.58.

Figure 2 shows the correlation between the experimental value and
the predicted values for five different methods. The correlation in the
basic fractions (p1 > 7.5) is inferior compared to the complete dataset.
Compared to previous studies with peptides (Perez-Riverol et al.,
2012), the best correlation is obtained in the neutral range (5 .0—7.0 pH)
where fewer proteins are observed. Interestingly, the algorithms based
on machine learning techniques, such as those of Cargile et al.
(Cofactor) and Perez-Riverol et al. (SVM), show a similar correlation
compared with the Iterative and Bjellquivst methods: 0.58 and 0.57.
These results are consistent with the nature of machine learning algo-
rithms, such as support vector machines and genetic algorithms, which
depend critically on the quality and size of training datasets (Larranaga
et al., 2006; Perez-Riverol et al., 2012).

These algorithms were developed for peptide-mixture prediction
where a large number of peptides can be used to train the model
(Perez-Riverol et al., 2012). The recently developed Branca algo-
rithm cannot be used to compute protein isoelectric points as it was
only optimized for peptides with K or R at their C—terminus: it fails
for proteins that do not have a basic C—terminus. This low correl-
ation between experimental and predicted values demonstrated that
only certain of the algorithms could be used for in silico studies of
the isoelectric point distribution in proteomes, such as those by Wu
et al. (2006) and Carugo (2007).

Over 50% of proteins are found with at least 2 experimental isoelectric
point value associated.

Figure 3 shows the distribution of experimental isoelectric points
and predicted distributions for several algorithms. The distribution
of the experimental values only shows similarity to the theoretical
distribution of the SVM (Perez-Riverol et al., 2012), Bjellquivst
(Bjellqvist et al., 1993) and Iterative (with Lehninger pK,1 set) algo-
rithms. We explored the correlation between the theoretical and ex-
perimental isoelectric point of proteins for the complete PIP-DB
database (Supplementary Information 52, Fig. 1) using four pK,1 sets
(DEFAUT, Expasy, CALIBRATED and SKOOG). The correlation
for the CALIBRATED and Expasy pK sets is negative (R2 = —0.017)
for the entire PIP-DB. In contrast to peptides, over 50% of the pro-
teins in our dataset have more than one experimental pI (Table 2),
making it difficult to study this property properly, due to the historic
use of poor analytical methods, together with protein denaturation
and fragmentation (Ramos et al., 2012).

A potential use of pI prediction algorithms is the possibility to detect
outliers from experimental data and detect possible incorrect assign-
ment at the protein and peptide level (Perez-Riverol et al., 2011). The
number of outliers also can be use as quality assessment metric of the
separation technique (Ramos et al., 2011). If the algorithm is more ac-
curate it tends to predict more outliers and possible false-positive identi-
fications assignments. Figure 4 shows the distribution of outliers and
non-outliers, of four of the pI algorithms under study. The SVM-based
algorithm proposed by Perez-Riverol and co-workers in 2012 predicted
the percentage of outliers, especially in the neutral and basic regions,
where the method out-performs the other algorithms.

3.2 lsoelectric point estimation of peptide sequences

Results seen for the peptide dataset are markedly different: a high cor-
relation was observed for most methods (Table 1). Although the top
seven methods all show the same correlation R2 = 0.96, the best result

methods generated a good estimate for the peptides, with a pI between
4.0 and 5.0, where the lowest RMSD was obtained. Similar to the
results obtained on PIP-DB analysis, the Iterative method used with the
Patrickios pKa set fails fully in the complete dataset.

The Bjellquivst algorithm shows a higher number of outliers
(black dots) in the basic fractions compare with the SVM algorithm
(Supplementary Information 52, Fig. 2). Outlier (peptide with devi-
ant pI) detection is highly dependent on both the accuracy of the pI
estimation and the quality of the electrophoretic experiment (Ramos
et al., 2011). Predicted p15 can be applied to remove less likely iden-
tified peptides and to curate the final protein identification result
lists in a shotgun proteomics experiment (Perez-Riverol et al.,
2011). Importantly an outlier may not necessarily imply an estima-
tion error, but may indicate the presence of one or more posttransla-
tional modifications (Lengqvist et al., 2011).

Interestingly, no major changes in the correlation values are
observed when different pK,1 sets are used with the Bjellqvist
method, 0.95—0.96; this suggests that most of the pKas values pub-
lished after Bjellqvist (Bjellqvist et al., 1993) only perform better in
certain analytical settings (Table 1). A similar trend is observed for
the Iterative method; this again suggests that none of the sets of pK,1
values is optimal or is necessarily superior to any other, and in most
cases different pK,1 values should be used for different calculations.
The cofactor method (Fig. 4) performs more poorly than most of the
algorithms as it was designed to study acid fractions only (Cargile
et al., 2008). The recent Branca algorithm also exhibited a poor per-
formance on this dataset (R2 = 0.85, Table 1). It was also designed
and trained to study peptides in acid fractions by adding corrections
to the original pK,1 sets proposed by Bjellquivst. For this reason, in
basic ranges the algorithm has a low correlation coefficient and a
high RMSD value (Fig. 4).

In contrast, other methods such as SVM, Bjellqvist and Iterative
(with certain pK,1 sets) show better behavior throughout the frac-
tions analyzed. The confidence intervals indicating the ability to pre-
dict near to an ideal performance (plexperimental versus pIpredicted) are
closest for these last algorithms.

3.3 lsoelectric point estimation of modified peptides
Post-translational and experimentally induced peptide modifications
can shift peptide pI compared to the values estimated for the
unmodified sequence in two ways: (i) by introducing charged groups
or (ii) by neutralizing charged groups (Ramos et al., 2011). The re-
sults presented in Section 3.2, show for most of the algorithms, a
good correlation between the predicted and experimental pI values
of peptides on a ‘non-modified’ dataset. However, an extended ana-
lysis taking into account post-translational modifications such as
phosphorylation and N-terminal acetylation will provide a more ac-
curate representation of a real electrophoretic experiment. Figures 6
and 7 show the experimental pI values versus the predicted phos-
phopeptide and acetylated peptide p1 and also the non-modified
variants for several pI algorithms, with a previously reported
dataset (Gauci et al., 2008). The best correlation was obtained when
the modification was considered during the estimation of the
theoretical pI, increasing the correlation from 0.4 to 0.9 for most
of the algorithms (Supplementary Information S3), demonstrating
the dramatic effect of post-translational modifications on p1
estimation.

When the N-terminus of a peptide is acetylated, a positive charge
is lost, decreasing the overall charge of the peptide (Gauci et al.,
2008; Lengqvist et al., 2011). Correspondingly, phosphorylation af-
fects the charge of a peptide by adding a negatively charged group

Fig. 7. Correlation between predicted pl versus experimental pl. The plots
show the correlation obtained if N-terminal acetylation is exclude (O) or in-
clude (A) in the pl calculation. Ra and Rb denote the correlation coefficients
excluding and including the modification in the estimation respectively. The
pl of the N-terminal acetylated peptides was calculated by omitting the pK
values of the N-terminal residue in the peptide sequence

(Halligan, 2009; Ramos et al., 2011). Figure 7 shows that the im-
pact of acetylation is more predominant to phosphorylation, making
results poorer if acetylation is not take into account. If those PTMs
are not considered during predictions and in silico studies, the final
results can be completely different to the real experiment, especially,

4 Discussion

Our benchmarking comparison constitutes a strong blind test, since
no method is in any way optimized for this particular data set and
all the proteins and corresponding isoelectric points were collected
from different sources and correspond to distinct analytical settings.
The present study demonstrates that the algorithms from Bjellqvist
et al. and Perez-Riverol et al. represent the most accurate algorithms
overall for computing protein isoelectric points. The results also
demonstrate that when other pK,1 sets are employed no significant
differences were seen for the Bjellqvist et al. approach, and most of
the small differences observed can be related to specific analytical
conditions specific to the experiment. The poor performance of all
evaluated algorithms for the single value protein dataset is alarming.
There are several possible explanations for this behaviour. The data-
set was evaluated using a variety of methods over many decades.
Thus the intrinsic variation will arise both from true biological vari-
ation (the presence of unknown processed or truncated proteins or
proteins with charged post-translational modifications, etc.) and
other errors introduced by a gallimaufry of different experimental
protocols, each with distinct and incommensurable calibration. The
low correlation between experimental and predicted values throws
serious doubt on the veracity of many theoretical studies of isoelec-
tric point distributions in whole proteomes, such as the studies by
Wu et al. (2006) and Carugo (2007), and any arguments made on
that basis. An alternative exegesis posits that PIP-DB must contain a
large number of annotation errors, as introduced during database
construction, which seriously contaminates the result. This is clearly
possible, if highly unlikely.

In IEF gels or SDS-PAGE experiments, it is common to find the
same polypeptide instance through multiple experimental fractions,
due to diffusion phenomena, or from uneven cutting during band
excision across of the gel. In addition, the peptides or proteins could
have precipitated out of solution during migration from the well to
the appropriate pH in the gel.

Possible aggregation and degradation could contribute to en-
hance inappropriate focalization, making it difficult to correctly in-
terpret the results obtained. It has also been shown that not only the
amino acid composition but also its subsequent modification can in-
ﬂuence the accurate estimation of the isoelectric point, e.g. common
modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation which might
lead to the shielding of surface charges (as previously described in
Section 3.3). PIP-DB illustrates this complex scenario as shown
in the Table 3. It contains multiple proteins that may be ‘detectable’
in both acid and basic region, showing a wide focalization zone.
Most pI prediction methods do not take into account such ‘artifacts’
and will thus fail to make accurate estimates.

These results also highlight the need for a complete and customiz-
able tool that can provide all available algorithms and pK‘,1 sets for iso-
electric point analysis. The machine-learning algorithms, especially the
SVM-based algorithm, showed a superior performance when studying
peptide mixtures. In general, learning-based pI prediction methods
(such as Cofactor, SVM and Branca) require a large training dataset
and their resulting performance will strongly depend of the quality of
that data. Even though Cofactor and Branca algorithms are based on
learning approaches, it is not possible to retrain these algorithms with
different datasets. In this sense, the SVM approach shows more ‘ﬂexibil-
ity’ in pI computation, and this feature can improve prediction accur-
acy. In contrast with Iterative methods, machine-learning algorithms

mental value found for the protein in PIP-DB.

have the advantage of being able to add new features to improve predic-
tion. Considering the amount of pKa sets reported to date, use of the
Iterative approach provides a good opportunity to find some variant
that fits well with particular experimental conditions. In the near future,
new algorithms and bioinformatics tools should be able to provide a
way of choosing different pKa sets and thus obtain more accurate pre-
diction for a given analytical setting. The SVM and Cofactor methods
should only be used where a high number of sequences are studied and
can thus be used to train the algorithms. We observed notable ﬂuctu-
ations in pI predictions for Iterative methods on a small dataset, show-
ing this method to be sensitive to small changes in the amino acid pKa
values used. Moreover, the algorithm fails when certain pK‘,1 values are
missing. We envisage that more algorithms based on machine learning,
including new additional features, should be explored allowing the de-
velopment of fast, accurate and reliable pI calculation algorithms for
use in future protein and peptide proteomic analysis.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: High-throughput phenotypic assays reveal information
about the molecules that modulate biological processes, such as a
disease phenotype and a signaling pathway. In these assays, the
identification of hits along with their molecular targets is critical to
understand the chemical activities modulating the biological system.
Here, we present HitPick, a web server for identification of hits in high-
throughput chemical screenings and prediction of their molecular
targets. HitPick applies the B-score method for hit identiﬁcation and
a newly developed approach combining 1-nearest-neighbor (1NN)
similarity searching and Laplacian-modified na'ive Bayesian target
models to predict targets of identified hits. The performance of the
HitPick web server is presented and discussed.

1 INTRODUCTION

Chemical biology experiments are increasingly used to search for
chemical modulators of biological processes in cell-based and
even whole-organism assays as illustrated by the thousands of
phenotypic screenings stored in public repositories (Seiler et al.,
2008; Wang et al., 2010). In these assays, the identiﬁcation of the
molecular targets of hits is essential to understand the molecular
basis of the chemical activities in the bioassay. Recently, drug
target prediction methods have been applied to the hits of cells
Woung et al., 2008) and zebraﬁsh (Laggner et al., 2012) pheno-
typic screenings showing that computational approaches are
suitable tools that facilitate the interpretation of the biological
activity of chemicals.

Although diverse in silico methods have been proposed to iden-
tify hits (Makarenkov et al., 2007; Malo et al., 2006) and predict
targets for chemicals [reviewed in (Kuhn et al., 2008)], only few of
them are available as easy-to-use online tools (Keiser et al., 2007;
Wang et al., 2012). To overcome this situation and assist in the
analysis and interpretation of chemical phenotypic screens, we
introduce HitPick, the ﬁrst web server for hit identiﬁcation and
target prediction of chemical screenings. HitPick provides the

functionality to detect bioassay hits using the B-score method
and predicts targets of a chemical of interest using a new integra-
tive approach that combines 1-nearest-neighbor (1NN) similarity
searching and a machine-learning method. On cross-validation,
the target prediction approach of HitPick performs better than
each of the methods alone, achieving a sensitivity of 60.94%, a
speciﬁcity of 99.99% and a precision of 92.11%.

2 METHODS

We apply the widely used B-score method for hit identiﬁcation, which
uses the median polish procedure to remove the bias in rows and columns
in a plate (Malo et al., 2006). Hits are determined by a P—Value cut-off of
0.05, and replicates of compounds will be considered as hits when all the
replicates are identiﬁed independently as hits.

For target prediction, HitPick uses a newly developed approach that
combines two methods based on 2D molecular ﬁngerprints, namely, lNN
similarity searching (Schuffenhauer et al., 2003) and Laplacian-modiﬁed
naive Bayesian target models (Nidhi et al., 2006). For each query com-
pound, the most similar compound from a dataset of known ligand—
target interactions is determined by calculating the pairwise Tanirnoto
coefﬁcient (Tc) Willett, 1998). Then, Laplacian—modiﬁed naive
Bayesian target models generate a score for all known targets of the
most similar compound Widhi et al., 2006), resulting in a list of ranked
target predictions.

For the implementation of this approach, we used a set of 145 549
human chemical—protein physical interactions extracted from the
STITCH 3.1 database (Kuhn et al., 2012). In this study, we restrict the
target prediction to human proteins, as it is currently the species with
the largest number of known drug targets, enabling thus more accurate
predictions. In total, we obtained 99 572 compounds with unique
SMILES strings with known interactions for which we generated 2D
circular ﬁngerprints based on the Morgan algorithm with feature invari-
ants similar to the FCFP (Rogers and Hahn, 2010) using RDKit (http://
rdkit.org). Using these molecular ﬁngerprints, we created Bayesian
models for 1375 proteins with at least three known ligands. For bench-
marking, we randomly assigned 85% of the known ligands to the training
set and the remaining 15% to the validation set. In total, the validation
set contained 22 868 positive and 20 779 507 negative compound—target
relationships, respectively.

To facilitate the analysis of experiments with many hits, the target
prediction for screenings with >100 hits is carried out for a structurally
diverse subset of 100 compounds obtained by applying the MaxMin-
Algorithm (Ashton et al., 2002) implemented in RDKit.

The ﬁngerprint creation for the STITCH compounds, building and
application of Bayesian target-speciﬁc ﬁngerprint models were imple-
mented in a KNIME (http://www.knime.org) workﬂow making use of
the chemoinformatic functionality provided by KNIME itself as well as
by RDKit.

Note: The precision for cells marked as ‘NA’ could not be determined because of the low number of compound—target predictions (<30).

3 PERFORMANCE

We assessed the performance of the target prediction method in
HitPick using as validation set 15% of all ligands that were not
part of the training set. When evaluating the highest scoring
target prediction for each compound, HitPick achieves a sensi-
tivity of 60.94% (with 66.16% being the maximum possible sen-
sitivity), a speciﬁcity of 99.99% and a precision of 92.11%, an
improvement over na'1've Bayesian models (sensitivity of 52.95%,
speciﬁcity of 99.98% and precision of 80.03%) and IN simi-
larity searching (precision of 84.72%). HitPick performance is
comparable with the target prediction quality achieved by the
Similarity Ensemble Approach (SEA), a well-known target
ﬁshing application that relates proteins based on the chemical
similarity of their ligands (Keiser et al., 2007) (data not shown).

We also evaluated the performance of the HitPick target pre-
diction method at different ranges of chemical similarity of the
query compound to the closest training compound and for up to
ﬁve top scoring known targets of this training molecule inde-
pendently. To obtain robust precision estimates, we require a
minimum of 30 compound—target predictions for each target
rank in a given Tc interval (Table 1).

We observed that the precision increases with increasing Tc.
For compounds with a Tc of 20.7 to the training set, the ﬁrst
predicted target was nearly always correct. Furthermore, the pre-
cision reached at least 53% for a To in the range of 0.4—0.5
(Table 1) Thus, we chose 50% as default precision threshold
for the predicted targets on the web server.

4 IMPLEMENTATION

HitPick offers two independent functions. The ﬁrst function
identiﬁes bioassay hits based on the B-score method and predicts
targets for up to 100 hits. As input, it requires the data from a
bioassay, including plate names, compound identiﬁers, well pos-
itions, activity values and SMILES strings. The output is a table
listing the hits and their chemical structures. This table is used
as input source for the target prediction method. The output of
the target prediction is a list of target predictions for the input
compounds ranked by decreasing precision.

In addition, HitPick allows the prediction of targets for up to
100 compounds independently from bioassay data. For this
second function, only SMILES strings are required as input.

To ensure a high reliability of the target prediction outcome,
HitPick reports only those targets per compound for which we

can reliably estimate the precision. The precision depends on
the similarity to the most similar compound in the set of
known interactions as well as on the rank of the target’s score.
Users can select different precision thresholds for the target pre-
diction results as desired. Under a lower threshold, more chem-
icals will have predictions at the cost of a lower precision.
In addition, an overview of the predicted targets is given in
form of pie chart.

The processing time for hit identiﬁcation depends on the size
of the assay data. For bioassays containing less than 5000, 10 000
and 100 000 compounds, the web server returns the results in less
than 1, 2 and 30min, respectively. The target prediction takes
~5 min per batch of query.

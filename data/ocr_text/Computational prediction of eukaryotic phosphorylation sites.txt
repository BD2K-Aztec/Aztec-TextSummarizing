ABSTRACT

Motivation: Kinase—mediated phosphorylation is the central
mechanism of post-translational modification to regulate cellular
responses and phenotypes. Signaling defects associated with
protein phosphorylation are linked to many diseases, particularly
cancer. Characterizing protein kinases and their substrates enhances
our ability to understand and treat such diseases and broadens our
knowledge of signaling networks in general.

While most or all protein kinases have been identified in well-
studied eukaryotes, the sites that they phosphorylate have been
only partially elucidated. Experimental methods for identifying
phosphorylation sites are resource intensive, so the ability to
computationally predict potential sites has considerable value.
Results: Many computational techniques for phosphorylation site
prediction have been proposed, most of which are available on the
web. These techniques differ in several ways, including the machine
learning technique used; the amount of sequence information used;
whether or not structural information is used in addition to sequence
information; whether predictions are made for specific kinases or for
kinases in general; and sources of training and testing data.

This review summarizes, categorizes and compares the available
methods for phosphorylation site prediction, and provides an
overview of the challenges that are faced when designing predictors
and how they have been addressed. It should therefore be useful
both for those wishing to choose a phosphorylation site predictor
for their particular biological application, and for those attempting to
improve upon established techniques in the future.

1 INTRODUCTION

Phosphorylation is the most widespread post-translational
modiﬁcation in eukaryotes and plays a crucial role in the regulation
of Virtually every cellular behavior, including DNA repair (Wood
et al., 2009), environmental stress response (Wang et al., 2010),
regulation of transcription (Uddin et al., 2003), apoptosis (Zhang
and Johnson, 2000), cellular motility (Ressurreigao et al., 2011),
immune response (Kim and Lee, 2011), metabolism (Bu et al.,
2010), and cellular differentiation (Lian et al., 2010). Historically,
novel phosphorylation sites have been discovered primarily
through the use of low-throughput biological techniques. With
the advent of site-directed mutagenesis, for instance, many labs
started using this technique to characterize speciﬁc phosphorylation

events (e.g. Meier et al., 1997). Unfortunately, such techniques
are time consuming, tedious and expensive to perform. More
recently, a high-throughput technique—mass spectrometry—
has greatly accelerated the identiﬁcation of novel sites. For
example, Huttlin et al. (2010) used mass spectrometry to map
the phosphoproteome of nine different mouse tissues, identifying
nearly 36 000 distinct phosphorylation sites. While useful, this
technique has important limitations: it cannot identify the protein
kinase(s) responsible for catalyzing the phosphorylation of a given
site; many phosphorylation sites are modiﬁed at substoichiometric
levels, with the unphosphorylated form sometimes preventing
detection of the phosphorylated form; many interesting proteins are
present at very low levels, making them difﬁcult to detect through
mass spectrometry; breaking open cells can place kinases together
with substrates they would not normally encounter, potentially
resulting in the detection of phosphorylation events that would
not occur in vivo; technical challenges exist that sometimes make
pinpointing exact phosphorylation sites difﬁcult (Boersema et al.,
2009); and perhaps most importantly, mass spectrometry requires
very expensive instruments and specialized expertise that are not
available in typical laboratories.

Given the limitations associated with both low-throughput
and high-throughput biological techniques for identifying novel
phosphorylation sites, computational approaches have become
increasingly popular. Such techniques require a protein sequence as
input, and produce some numerical measure of the likelihood that
each serine, threonine or tyrosine (S/T/Y) residue in that sequence
is a phosphorylation site. For example, Slaugenhaupt et al. (2001)
found that the mutation R696P in the protein encoded by the
IKBKAP gene causes familial dysautonomia, with the hypothesized
mechanism being disruption of the phosphorylation of T699—a site
predicted to be phosphorylated by NetPhos (Blom et al., 1999),
the ﬁrst phosphorylation site prediction tool. Prediction programs
are often used to narrow down the list of possible phosphorylation
sites in a protein of interest, with the predictions subsequently
veriﬁed using biological experiments. For instance, Fan et al. (2009)
used a combination of several predictors to identify seven putative
sites phosphorylated by protein kinase C in the transient receptor
potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) ion channel. When three of these
sites were separately mutated to alanine, the resultant proteins
exhibited markedly reduced activation in response to protein kinase
C compared with wild-type TRPV4.

To the authors’ knowledge, four review articles have previously
been published that included signiﬁcant discussion of computational
phosphorylation site prediction. Kobe et al. (2005) provided a
brief review of this ﬁeld, along with a detailed discussion of
the structural bases of protein kinase speciﬁcity. Hjerrild and
Gammeltoft (2006) reviewed both computational and biological

aspects of phosphoproteomics, while Miller and Blom (2009) brieﬂy
summarized some of the literature on phosphorylation site prediction
and provided a protocol for the use of their NetPhos (Blom et al.,
1999, 2004; Hjerrild et al. , 2004) family of tools. Most recently, Xue
et al. (2010) reviewed phosphorylation site databases, prediction
tools and miscellaneous software associated with phosphorylation
sites, and also compared the performance of a subset of available
predictors.

Compared with the above reviews, here we concentrate more
speciﬁcally on the methodologies employed by the various
prediction tools, taking a comparative approach to examining the
issues and challenges associated with computational phosphory-
lation site prediction. Section 2 of this review provides a brief
overview of the available methods, while Section 3 compares
and discusses the tools with respect to different aspects of their
methodologies. Section 4 comments on some of the challenges that
remain in the ﬁeld, and Section 5 gives some concluding remarks.

2 AN OVERVIEW OF CURRENT TOOLS FOR
PHOSPHORYLATION SITE PREDICTION

If signiﬁcant updates to existing methods are treated separately, then
there have been nearly 40 methods for the computational prediction
of phosphorylation sites described since 1999. This total excludes
tools that predict sites for more than one type of post-translational
modiﬁcation (e.g. Basu and Plewczynski, 2010; Schwartz et al.,
2009) and methods based on simple motifs (discussed by Xue et al.,
2010). Unlike Xue and co-authors, however, we include techniques
for which no web implementation is available, as they can be
valuable sources of ideas for developers of future tools.

A list of currently available phosphorylation site prediction tools
is given in Table 1. Each tool is categorized with respect to several
important attributes, including the machine learning technique(s)
used (described further in Section 3.1); the number of residues
surrounding the phosphorylation site that are taken into account
(Section 3.2); whether the method uses only sequence information
or also uses structural information (Section 3.3); whether the tool
includes models speciﬁc to particular kinases or kinase families
(Section 3.4); and the source(s) of known phosphorylation sites
used for training and testing (Section 3.5). We avoid comparing
the performance of each tool, for several reasons: some of the tools
discussed do not have web implementations or have websites that
are no longer accessible; different tools use different performance
measures or were tested on different datasets; it would not be
meaningful to compare kinase-speciﬁc with non-kinase-speciﬁc
tools; and performance comparisons have been done elsewhere
for some tools (Xue et al., 2010). However, we do discuss two
important issues regarding predictive performance—the creation of
standardized testing datasets (Section 4.1) and balancing sensitivity
and speciﬁcity (Section 4.3).

3 COMPARING AND CONTRASTING THE
AVAILABLE TOOLS

3.1 Machine learning methods

To provide tight control of cellular processes, a protein kinase
catalyzes the phosphorylation of a given S/T/Y residue only if
the amino acids around that residue ﬁt a speciﬁc, yet ﬂexible,

pattern (Diks et al., 2007). Sequence motifs that describe these
patterns, such as those in the PROSITE database (Sigrist et al.,
2002), are neither sensitive (see Blom et al., 1999) nor speciﬁc (the
PROSITE motif for the protein kinase C recognition sequence, for
instance, is [ST]—x-[RK], which would be expected to occur often
at random). The poor speciﬁcity and sensitivity of motifs means
that accurate prediction of phosphorylation sites requires the use of
machine learning methods, which can identify more complex and
subtle patterns. As Table 1 shows, many different machine learning
methods have been used, including artiﬁcial neural networks
(ANN s), decision trees, genetic algorithms, position-speciﬁc scoring
matrices (PSSMs) and support vector machines (SVMs).

Perhaps the simplest machine learning technique is the PSSM,
which is a matrix in which rows represent amino acids and columns
represent positions in a multiple sequence alignment. In the simplest
possible PSSM, a given matrix element would contain the frequency
of a given amino acid in a given position, although more complex
variations are usually developed in practice (e. g. Koenig and Grabe,
2004; Li et al., 2008b). PSSMs are easy to understand and construct,
but are unable to detect patterns in which combinations of amino
acids are important (Blom et al., 1999). PSSMs can, say, express the
idea that proline promotes phosphorylation when found at position
+1 (where position 0 is the phosphorylation site) and arginine
promotes phosphorylation when found at —2, but cannot express the
idea that both occurring at the same time prevents phosphorylation.

In contrast, machine learning techniques like ANN s and SVMs—
two of the most popular methods used by phosphorylation site
prediction tools—can capture more complex patterns (Blom et al.,
1999). This comes at the cost of added complexity. ANN s, in
particular, are often regarded as ‘black boxes’ in which the
classiﬁcation function is essentially inscrutable. Some methods
strike a balance between the simplicity of PSSMs and the opaqueness
of ANN s. Xue et al. (2006), for example, proposed a method based
on Bayesian probability that is more expressive than PSSMs, but is
more easily interpreted biologically and mathematically than ANN s.

An interesting point of discussion is, what do the machine learning
methods actually model? In other words, do they model the actual
biological mechanisms underlying protein kinase recognition, or
do they merely recognize patterns? For the majority of methods
listed in Table 1, and certainly for those that consider only sequence
information (Section 3.3), we would argue that it is the latter.
This is not meant to denigrate these methods: clearly, recognizing
patterns in sequence information is useful, both in the ﬁeld of
phosphorylation site prediction and elsewhere. Most tools utilizing
structural information fall somewhere between the two categories
mentioned above. For example, although DISPHOS (Iakoucheva
et al., 2004) uses secondary structure predictions as features,
it would be better described as recognizing patterns than as
modeling biological mechanisms. On the other end of the scale,
pkaPS (Neuberger et al., 2007) extensively models the kinase—
substrate interaction. While pattern recognition has resulted in much
success, it is plausible that more closely modeling the underlying
biology of substrate recognition will result in the greatest gains in
predictive performance.

3.2 Amount of sequence information used

Phosphorylation site prediction tools vary widely in the number
of residues surrounding the phosphorylation site that are taken

into account. At one extreme, PostMod (Jung et al., 2010) was
designed to consider up to 101 residues (between positions —50

and +50), whereas Predikin 1.0 (Brinkworth et al., 2003) considers

just seven. The number of residues considered is important because
too few means information useful for making predictions gets
ignored, while too many will decrease the signal-to-noise ratio.

Using many residues can also make some machine learning methods
computationally intractable (Biswas et al., 2010).

Several strategies have been used to determine the optimum
number of residues. First, it has been argued that the optimum should
be consistent with the number of residues in physical contact with
the kinase (Blom et al., 1999). An early report stated that 9—12

residues surrounding the phosphorylation site are likely to physically
contact the kinase (Songyang et al., 1994), an estimate consistent
with the number of residues used by many prediction methods.
Depending on the 3D structure of the substrate, however, the 9—12
residues contacted by the kinase may not be the same as the 9—12
residues surrounding the phosphorylation site in the linear sequence.
Residues not in contact with the kinase may also affect its binding by
inﬂuencing the charge or hydrophobicity of the microenvironment,
or by affecting the conformation of residues in contact with the
kinase. As such, the number of residues that physically contact the
kinase may not reliably indicate the number of residues that should
be used for making predictions.

Second, some authors have empirically tested various numbers of
residues, and then chosen the number that gives the best predictive
performance. The authors of PostMod (Jung et al., 2010) tried
between 7 and 101 residues, and found that 41 resulted in the
best accuracy. Other authors reported much smaller optima, with
Blom et al. (1999) suggesting between 9 and 11 and Biswas et al.
(2010) reporting 15. Given that reported optima are inconsistent,
researchers should use caution when applying previously reported
empirical optima for developing future methods.

Third, Neuberger et al. (2007) examined how residues around
phosphorylation sites compare with residues in general proteins with
respect to two properties—hydrophobicity and ﬂexibility. Figure 1
of their paper plots position (40 residues upstream and downstream
of the phosphorylation site) versus deviation from baseline values,
and shows that each property deviates substantially from baseline
values near phosphorylation sites, and then gradually returns as
one gets farther from a given site. The authors found that both
properties deviate signiﬁcantly between positions — 18 and +23, and
thus advocate the use of these 42 residues. Because this experiment
was done only for protein kinase A, it is not known whether its
results generalize to other protein kinases.

The lack of agreement among the three strategies described
above may be due to differences among kinases (some kinases
may use more residues as a recognition sequence than others)
and/0r among machine learning methods (some methods may handle
greater dimensionality—in other words, longer sequences—better
than others). The lack of agreement could also be related to effect
size. For example, a residue at position —20 may have a real, but very
small, effect on phosphorylation—an effect that might be ignored
by some authors, but not others. As the most appropriate number
of residues remains unclear, a rigorous investigation of this issue
would be invaluable for developers of future tools, especially if
consideration was given to the particular machine learning technique
used and the particular kinase under consideration.

3.3 Use and non-use of structural information

The structural basis of protein kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation has
been examined in numerous studies. For example, Dunker et al.
(2002) reported that phosphorylation sites are frequently found in
disordered regions [a fact exploited by the authors of the NETPHOS
prediction tool (Iakoucheva et al. , 2004)], while Kitchen et al. (2008)
described the degree to which electrostatic interactions stabilize
phosphorylated residues. Further, a review by Kobe et al. (2005)
examined the structural determinants of protein kinase speciﬁcity.
The degree to which the substrate’s 3D structure affects kinase
speciﬁcity is unclear. Studies that ﬁnd correlations between these two

variables, like those cited above, suggest that the substrate’s structure
is important in the recognition process. Conversely, short peptides
containing known phosphorylation sites can be recognized with
similar kinase-catalyzed kinetics as the corresponding intact protein
(Kemp et al., 1977; Zetterqvist et al., 1976; see also Houseman
et al., 2002 and Lowenberg et al. , 2005), suggesting a minor role for
structure. Despite this, it seems plausible that the use of structural
information can play at least some role in increasing the accuracy
of phosphorylation site prediction tools. Although lack of structural
data remains an obstacle, the amount of structural information about
phosphorylation sites is growing rapidly. The most recent version
of the Phosph03D database (Zanzoni et al., 2011), for instance,
contains structural information for over 1700 sites, nearly 11 times
the number contained in the previous version (Zanzoni et al., 2007).

Table 1 shows that approximately one-quarter of tools utilize
information regarding the 3D structure of the kinase and/or its
substrate, whereas the other tools use only primary sequence
information. Blom et al. (1999), in addition to devising a method
based only on primary sequence, superimposed the structures of 12
different tyrosine phosphorylation sites, and found that nine of them
had a common conformation, while the other three shared a second
conformation. In contrast, non-phosphorylated tyrosine residues
exhibited a wide range of conformations. They also determined
that phosphorylated residues were generally more ﬂexible than
average, consistent with the hypothesis that high ﬂexibility would
be required to ﬁt into a kinase’s active site. While conformation
and ﬂexibility thus seemed like two structural features that could
increase prediction accuracy, the authors’ sequence-based method
outperformed their structure-based method, although the latter
did make more accurate predictions for a few atypical tyrosine
phosphorylation sites. In contrast, Durek et al. (2009) found that,
for several different kinase families, adding structural information
to a sequence-only model resulted in a modest but consistent
increase in predictive performance, showing that the use of structural
information can add discriminatory power.

Given that sequence-only methods, by deﬁnition, ignore
information about the kinase—substrate interaction, the upper limit
to their accuracy is likely less than the upper limit of structure-based
methods. As structural information becomes available for more and
more phosphorylation sites, structure-based methods will continue
to improve.

3.4 Kinase-speciﬁc versus non-kinase-speciﬁc tools

Most phosphorylation site prediction programs are kinase-speciﬁc,
as they require as input both a protein sequence and the name
of a protein kinase, and produce some measure of the likelihood
that each S/T/Y residue in the sequence is phosphorylated by the
chosen kinase. In contrast, a few tools require only a protein
sequence as input, and report the likelihood that each S/T/Y residue
is phosphorylated by any kinase. Kinase— speciﬁc tools can be further
divided based on whether they make predictions for individual
kinases [e. g. NetPhosK (Blom et al., 2004) and pkaPA (Neuberger
et al., 2007)] or for kinase families [e.g. SiteSeek (Yoo et al., 2008)
and PAAS (Sobolev et al. , 2010)]. Part of the motivation for making
predictions for kinase families is that some individual kinases have
very few target sites known, making the training component of
machine learning difﬁcult. As kinases from the same family will
likely have similar recognition sequences (Kim et al., 2004), their

Prediction of eukaryotic phosphorylation sites

 

known target sites can be combined, resulting in a model that utilizes
much more information than if kinases from the same family were
modeled separately.

How do the accuracies of non-kinase-speciﬁc tools compare
with those of kinase-speciﬁc tools? Given the issues involved in
comparing the performance of different tools (see Section 3.5.3),
this question is more difﬁcult to answer than it would appear. It
has been claimed that, since there is no ‘average’ phosphorylation
site, only kinase-speciﬁc predictors should be able to achieve good
accuracy (Neuberger et al., 2007)—an argument with considerable
logical appeal. Indeed, most users will likely be interested in
particular biological pathways (and thus particular kinases), making
kinase-speciﬁc tools an ideal choice. For applications in which the
speciﬁc kinase is not a concern, the user could still take advantage
of the higher accuracy of kinase-speciﬁc tools by aggregating the
results from many kinase-speciﬁc predictions to make a general
list of phosphorylation sites in the protein(s) of interest. On
the other hand, non-kinase-speciﬁc tools may be able to detect
phosphorylation sites for which the associated kinase is unknown—
an advantage that may be of interest to some users. Additionally,
non-kinase-speciﬁc tools have reported respectable performance,
with accuracy rates approaching 80% (Swaminathan et al., 2010).

3.5 Training and testing data

Both positive (actual phosphorylated residues) and negative (actual
non-phosphorylated residues) data are required for training and
testing a particular prediction tool. Section 3.5.1 discusses sources of
positive data, while Section 3.5.2 describes the problem of obtaining
negative data. Finally, the issue of fair performance comparisons is
discussed in Section 3.5.3.

3.5.1 Positive data Several sources of known phosphorylation
sites have been used. Most early prediction tools used either
PhosphoBase (Blom et al., 1998; Kreegipuu et al., 1999), a
database solely containing known phosphorylation sites, or Swiss-
Prot, for which the annotation of a given protein includes
its known phosphorylation sites. Authors using Swiss-Prot (e.g.
Iakoucheva et al., 2004; Plewczynski et al., 2005) generally discard
sites described as ‘hypothetical’, ‘predicted’ or ‘by similarity’,
choosing instead only experimentally conﬁrmed sites. In 2004, the
information from PhosphoBase was integrated into a new database
called Phospho.ELM (Diella et al., 2004, 2008; Dinkel et al. , 2011).
Most tools developed after 2004 have used Phospho.ELM, although
there are exceptions: other databases that have been used (some
of which are specialized in nature) are PhosphoSitePlus (Hornbeck
et al. , 2004), TheArabidopsis Protein Phosphorylation Site Database
(PhosPhAt) (Durek et al., 2010; Heazlewood et al., 2008), The
Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) (Swarbreck et al., 2008)
and PHOSIDA (Gnad et al., 2007, 2011). Finally, a few authors
searched the literature for known phosphorylation sites (e. g. Hjerrild
et al., 2004; Moses et al., 2007).

3.5.2 Negative data An ever-present difﬁculty in the ﬁeld of
phosphorylation site prediction concerns negative training and
testing data. While experiments can verify that a particular residue
can be phosphorylated, it would be difﬁcult to prove deﬁnitively
that a particular residue is not phosphorylated under any conditions.
Thus, while databases such as Phospho.ELM and PhosphoSitePlus

contain thousands of known phosphorylation sites, they do not
contain sites known not to be phosphorylated.

To circumvent this problem, most authors make the assumption
that any S/T/Y residue that has not been shown to be phosphorylated
is a negative. While some of these residues will likely turn out to be
positives as more phosphorylation sites are discovered, the majority
of these are probably actual negatives, making this a reasonable,
if imperfect, approach. Some authors (e.g. Neuberger et al., 2007)
have gone a step further, requiring that the residue not be found
in any phosphorylation site database and that its encompassing
protein contains at least one residue known to be phosphorylated
by the kinase of interest. The assumption here is that, if a protein
has at least one residue that is known to be phosphorylated, then
the phosphorylation of that protein has been studied in at least
some detail, making it less likely that its other S/T/Y residues are
undiscovered phosphorylation sites.

Another approach is to use, as negative data, S/T/Y residues that
are buried in the core of a particular protein (Blom et al. , 2004). This
strategy relies on the assumption that buried residues would not be
physically accessible to any kinase, thus reducing the number of so-
called negatives that later turn out to be positives. A disadvantage
of this approach is that it requires knowledge of the protein’s
tertiary structure, and only a small portion of proteins currently have
solved structures (although the use of structure prediction programs
could partially compensate for this). More importantly, however,
this method’s underlying assumption may not be entirely valid. In
a detailed analysis of experimentally veriﬁed phosphorylation sites,
J iménez et al. (2007) found that while phosphorylation sites are more
solvent-exposed than the average residue, close to 15% have little
solvent accessibility. Moreover, a site can be buried in one structure
of a given protein, but unburied in another (Durek et al. , 2009; Zhou
et al., 2006). Despite these caveats, choosing solvent-inaccessible
residues as negatives currently seems like the most reliable approach
to obtaining negatives for training and testing.

3.5.3 Performing fair comparisons of performance While new
prediction tools can improve upon previous ones in various ways,
developers must usually show that a new tool offers an improvement
in predictive performance. To perform a fair comparison, both the
new method and existing methods must be tested using the same
data. When testing existing tools, typically one has access only to
the already-trained versions that are available on the web (Dang
et al., 2008), and since data that were used to train a given tool
should not be used to test it (Dang et al. , 2008), it can be difﬁcult to
identify suitable testing data.

Some authors have simply ignored this problem, comparing their
tools’ performance numbers (sensitivity, speciﬁcity, etc.) directly
with those given in the papers describing previous tools, even though
the testing data used may have been different. While having some
value, such comparisons are certainly less informative than they
could be.

Positive data appropriate for comparing new and existing tools
can be obtained by collecting known phosphorylation sites added to
a database after the publication of all existing methods (Wan et al.,
2008). If access is available to known phosphorylation sites that
have not yet been deposited in the databases, they could be used as
well. Note that while new known sites are required for comparing
performance with existing methods, older known sites can still be
used for training a new method.

Given how negative data are obtained (see Section 3.5 .2),
obtaining negative data appropriate for testing seems harder than for
positive data (and interestingly, has been given little or no attention
in the literature). Suppose that, as many have done, developer A
focuses exclusively on predicting phosphorylation in humans. Since
the entire human proteome is known, he might use all S/T/Y sites
not known to be phosphorylated as negative data for training his
method. If developer B later wishes to compare his new method to
that of A, there would be no negative data available that were not
used to train A’s method, making a fair comparison impossible.

While requiring coordination among those in the phosphorylation
site database and prediction community, possible solutions to these
problems do exist, some of which are suggested in Section 4.1.

3.6 Other differences among the available tools

While Table 1 categorizes the tools in terms of important properties
for which they vary, these categories do not capture all their
differences, and there are several tools that deviate from the norm in
a notable way. For instance, Musite (Gao and Xu, 2010) is unique
in that it is an open-source platform that allows the creation of a
customized predictor, with the user able to choose different training
and testing data, features, stringency thresholds and so on. Other
examples of tools that differ from the norm are given below.

While most tools were trained using known phosphorylation sites,
ScanSite’s (Obenauer et al., 2003; Yaffe et al. , 2001) authors created
an oriented peptide library, and then incubated it with a given protein
kinase. Phosphorylated peptides were separated from those that
were not phosphorylated, and the former sequenced to determine
the abundance of each amino acid at each position. The ScanSite
program uses this information to output the likelihood that a given
S/T/Y residue in its input sequence can be phosphorylated by that
protein kinase. Although known phosphorylation sites were not used
for training, known sites from PhosphoBase (Blom et al., 1998;
Kreegipuu et al., 1999) were used for testing. More recently, Li
et al. (2008a) developed SMALI, a tool which is similar to ScanSite
but claims to have better accuracy.

Most tools require protein sequences as input, and produce as
output score indicating the likelihood that a given S/T/Y residue is
a phosphorylation site. In contrast, Predikin 1.0 (Brinkworth et al.,
2003) takes the sequence of an uncharacterized protein kinase as
input, and reports a 7-mer predicted to be its optimal recognition
sequence. Predikin 2.0 (Saunders and Kobe, 2008; Saunders et al.,
2008) improved upon the original tool’s ability to output optimal
kinase recognition sequences and also added the conventional
functionality of scoring potential phosphorylation sites.

Finally, MetaPredPS (Wan et al. , 2008) is currently the only meta-
predictor, which is a type of tool that combines the classiﬁcations
from several individual predictors in the hope of achieving
better accuracy. MetaPredPS uses a weighted voting strategy to
combine predictions from GPS 1.0, KinasePhos 1.0, NetPhosK,
PPSP, PredPhospho and Scansite (see Table 1 for references).
Meta-predictors have also been successfully applied to other
bioinformatics-related classiﬁcation problems, including subcellular
localization prediction (Liu et al., 2007; Shen et al., 2007), major
histocompatibility complex-binding prediction (Karpenko et al.,
2008; Trost et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2008b) and protein structure
prediction (Ginalski et al., 2003). Given that many different
strategies can be used to combine the output of individual predictors,

and that there exist dozens of individual tools for phosphorylation
site prediction, there is likely room for additional work on meta-
predictors in this ﬁeld.

4 FUTURE DIRECTIONS

In some respects, the ﬁeld of phosphorylation site prediction is
mature. As Table 1 shows, many different machine learning methods
have been utilized; widely varying amounts of information (in
terms of number of residues surrounding the phosphorylation site)
have been incorporated into predictive models; many methods have
been proposed in both the structure-based and sequence-based
categories; several tools exist for both kinase-speciﬁc and non-
kinase-speciﬁc predictions; and many sources of training and testing
data have been utilized. In other respects, however, the ﬁeld is
immature. Three challenges that remain (to rigorously determine
the optimum number of residues surrounding the phosphorylation
site, to develop improved structure-based methods and to develop
additional meta-predictors) were discussed earlier in this review.
A number of others were described by Xue et al. (2010). Four
additional challenges, which we feel are of particular signiﬁcance,
are described below.

4.1 Creating standardized testing datasets

Perhaps the most important challenge involves the development of
standardized testing datasets. As described in Section 3.5.3, it is
currently extremely difﬁcult to properly compare the accuracy of
different prediction tools—either by reading the papers describing
them or by testing them anew. Given the large number of
phosphorylation site prediction programs already available, it is
critical that authors of newly developed tools be able to show a
clear improvement in performance compared with older ones. A
dataset containing both positive and negative data, half of which
is designated for training (only) and half of which is designated
for testing (only), would be an invaluable resource, as it would
provide a fair, standardized benchmark by which each tool could
be judged. Such a database could be created if a laboratory were
to use mass spectrometry to identify as exhaustively as possible
the phosphorylation sites in an organism for which few sites are
currently known. The ‘buried residue method’ (see Section 3.5 .2)
could then be used to identify negatives. Unfortunately, this
solution has an important limitation: mass spectrometry does not
give information about the kinase that phosphorylates each site—
information required by tools making kinase-speciﬁc predictions.
Another solution would be for curators of phosphorylation site
databases to designate a portion of all future data collected (from
low-throughput or high-throughput sources) as ‘testing data’, and
for the developers of future tools to voluntarily refrain from using
these data for training. This strategy could substantially improve the
ability to compare phosphorylation site prediction methods.

4.2 Developing tools for a wider variety of organisms

Both the quantity of protein kinases and the types represented
(tyrosine kinases, calmodulin—dependent kinases, etc.) differ
substantially in different eukaryotes (Diks et al. , 2007). For instance,
Arabidopsis encodes around twice as many protein kinases as does
human (Champion et al., 2004; Manning et al., 2002), but does
not encode any classical tyrosine kinases. In addition, the lower

Prediction of eukaryotic phosphorylation sites

 

eukaryote Plasmodiumfalciparum encodes only a few dozen protein
kinases, but some of these are of a type observed in few other
organisms (Ward et al., 2004). The disparate nature of different
organisms’ kinomes means that prediction programs designed for
human kinases (the majority of the tools currently available) are
less useful for organisms like plants. While a few plant-speciﬁc
prediction tools have been developed (Durek et al. , 2010; Gao et al. ,
2009; Heazlewood et al. , 2008), further work needs to be done both
for plants and for other non-human organisms. While such work
is challenging due to the smaller number of phosphorylation sites
that are known for these organisms, further progress can be made
as such data become more plentiful, and as structure-based methods
for phosphorylation site prediction become more reﬁned.

4.3 Making high speciﬁcity predictions for
whole-genome annotations

As with other classiﬁcation problems, predicting phosphorylation
sites involves a trade-off between sensitivity and speciﬁcity.
Greater sensitivity might be beneﬁcial when predicting sites in
a single protein, whereas greater speciﬁcity may be desirable
when identifying sites in an entire proteome. This trade-off is
illustrated well in Table 5 of Xue et al. (2010), which shows
that different tools can achieve very high speciﬁcity, but only by
greatly sacriﬁcing sensitivity (and vice versa). When sensitivity and
speciﬁcity are balanced, the most accurate tools can achieve rates
for both simultaneously of ~90%—a rate likely to be satisfactory
when predicting sites in a limited number of proteins, but that would
yield an unacceptable number of false positives when applied to
an entire proteome. Unfortunately, using current prediction tools in
genome annotation pipelines would therefore result in too many false
positives (or too many false negatives, depending on the threshold
selected). As such, the ﬁeld of phosphorylation site prediction
will not be truly mature until tools are developed that offer good
sensitivity combined with very high speciﬁcity.

4.4 Making use of evolutionary information

Many types of functional sites in proteins and nucleic acids
are known to be evolutionarily conserved, such as transcription
factor binding sites (Berezikov et al., 2004), mRNA splice
junctions (Shapiro and Senapathy, 1987), microRNA target
sites (Friedman et al., 2009) and surface residues that participate in
protein—protein interfaces (Caffrey et al., 2004). The evolutionary
conservation of phosphorylation sites has also been examined in
numerous studies. For instance, the phosphorylation site Ser2 is
conserved in versions of the small ubiquitin-like modiﬁer (SUMO)
protein in species as distantly related as human, Saccharomyces
cerevisiae and Drosophila melanogaster (Matic et al., 2008).
Signiﬁcant conservation of phosphorylation sites also occurs among
different species of plants (Maathuis, 2008; Nakagami et al., 2010).
Some degree of conservation even extends to prokaryotes—although
signaling via the phosphorylation of S/T/Y residues was once
thought to be limited to eukaryotes, several such sites have been
identiﬁed in Escherichia coli (Macek et al., 2008) and Bacillus
subtilis (Macek et al., 2007).

As evolutionary information is valuable for many bioinformatics-
related tasks, including protein structure prediction, gene ﬁnding,
genome annotation and sequence assembly, it should prove valuable
for phosphorylation site prediction as well. For example, J alal

et al. (2009) developed a protocol that uses known human
phosphorylation sites to identify putative bovine sites. While not
involving machine learning, the success of this approach shows the
value of using evolutionary information in order to identify novel
sites. Strangely, evolutionary information has largely been ignored
in the context of identifying phosphorylation sites using machine
learning. In one exception, Gnad et al. (2007) used information
concerning phosphorylation site conservation to improve the
accuracy of their SVM-based predictor. In future, evolutionary
conservation of protein kinases (rather than, or in addition
to, phosphorylation sites) may also prove useful in leveraging
knowledge about one organism to predict phosphorylation sites in
a second organism. Given the considerable predictive power of
evolutionary information, its more widespread incorporation into
future prediction tools has the potential to greatly increase accuracy.

5 CONCLUSION

There has already been a great deal of success in applying different
methodologies to the problem of phosphorylation site prediction.
Addressing the challenges outlined above, as well as those described
by Xue et al. (2010), will require much coordination and effort, but
would constitute signiﬁcant steps forward for the ﬁeld.

Abstract

Analyses of amyloidogenic sequence fragments are essential in studies of neurodegenerative dis-
eases. However, there is no one internet dataset that collects all the sequences that have been
investigated for their amyloidogenicity. Therefore, we have created the AmyLoad website which
collects the amyloidogenic sequences from all major sources. The website allows for filtration of
the fragments and provides detailed information about each of them. Registered users can both
personalize their work with the website and submit their own sequences into the database.
To maintain database reliability, submitted sequences are reviewed before making them available
to the public. Finally, we re-implemented several amyloidogenic sequence predictors, thus the
AmyLoad website can be used as a sequence analysis tool. We encourage researchers working on

amyloid proteins to contribute to our service.

Availability and implementation: The AmyLoad website is freely available at http://comprec-lin.

1 Introduction

The mechanisms for development of amyloidogenic diseases such as
the Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s diseases are still not completely
known. It has been proved that for these diseases to occur, specific
protein fragments must become exposed in the structures. These
fragments are characterised by a high aggregation propensity, which
leads to the formation of fibres with a sterric zipper form, soluble
oligomers or amorphous aggregates (Uversky and Fink, 2004). The
amyloidogenic sequence fragments are essential to understand the
development of amyloid diseases.

Several difficulties are encountered in studies of amyloidogenic
fragments. First, there are a few internet data sources which contain
such fragments. The most popular are AMYde (Pawlicki et al.,
2008), WALTZ-DB (Beerten et al., 2015), AmylHex with AmylFrag
(Thompson et al., 2006) and ZipperDB (Goldschmidt et al., 2010),
or datasets used to validate analytical methods, such as TANGO
(Fernandez-Escamilla et al., 2004) or AGGRESCAN (Conchillo-
5016 et al., 2007). None of these sources contains all available data.
The WALTZ-DB, for instance, is designed for hexapeptides, while
ZipperDB collects amyloidogenic sequences obtained with computer

modelling. AMYde, on the other hand, includes amino acid tem-
plates characteristic of specific amyloid protein families, rather than
amyloidogenic fragments as such. Secondly, most of the datasets do
not provide a user-friendly way of data browsing and filtering. To
the best of our knowledge, currently only WALTZ-DB enables its
users to filter data. Finally, various computational methods have
been developed to predict the occurrence of amyloidogenic frag-
ments in protein sequence. Most of these are based on empirical
amino acid features, e.g. contact sites density or hydrogen bonding
(Conchillo-Sole et al., 2007; Garbuzynskiy et al., 2010), machine
learning methods (Gasior and Kotulska, 2014) or consensus meth-
ods (Tsolis et al., 2013), to mention only a few. As with the frag-
ment data, these tools are not collected together in one place on the
Internet. Therefore, if a sequence is analyzed with several different
predictors, each method must be used separately. To address these
difficulties, we present the AmyLoad internet database which con-
solidates a great majority of the currently available amyloidogenic
and non-amyloidogenic sequences, and several prediction methods.
The AmyLoad website allows a user to fully personalize their work
with over 1300 unique sequence database entries and implemented

prediction methods, and also to submit new data to the database.
Links to other yet not implemented amyloid predictors are also
available in our service.

2 Methods

The AmyLoad website currently contains almost 1400 unique, experi-
mentally derived sequence fragments mostly selected from five data-
sets: WALTZ—DB, AmylHex, AmylFrag and validation datasets of
AGGRESCAN and TANGO, with 908, 158, 43, 25 and 248 se-
quences, respectively. The more detailed information provided for
each sequence, as well as a set of other sequences, was obtained by
manual studies of over 90 publications for which references are ac-
cessible on the AmyLoad website. The prediction methods
FoldAmyloid (Garbuzynskiy et al., 2010), AGGRESCAN (Conchillo-
Solé et al., 2007) and FISH (Gasior and Kotulska, 2014) were re-im-
plemented in Python 2.7. Their performance was tested comparing
with the results of their original online implementations. All the web-
site data is stored in a MySQL database. The web server is built with
Django 1.7 framework and functionality implemented in Python 2.7.

3 Results

3.1 Browsing the database

Sequences presented on the AmyLoad website are listed in a table
with columns indicating protein name, fragment name, amino acid
sequence and the information about amyloidogenicity. Additional de-
tails are separately presented for each fragment, such as an examin-
ation method, source dataset references (see Section 2), references to
relevant publications and other information. Furthermore, if the se-
quence fragment belongs to the WALTZ-DB, there is an additional
link provided leading to the WALTZ—DB sequence information
page (Beerten et al., 2015). Data presented in the table can be filtered
by selected features, such as the protein name, amyloidogenicity,
minimum and maximum sequence length or the amino acid subse-
quence occurrence. Each fragment can be downloaded in the CSV,
SSV (semicolon-separated-value), XML or FASTA file format.

3.2 Sequence analysis

One of the most distinguishing functionalities of AmyLoad is add-
itional implementation of sequence analysis methods. The analysis is
performed on the submitted FASTA sequences. There are three amy-
loidogenic sequence predictors available on the website, FoldAmyloid,
AGGRESCAN and FISH. Each method can be applied using the same
options as in their original online implementations. For example,
FoldAmyloid can be run for different empirical amino acid features,
sizes of the averaging frame and the threshold values (Garbuzynskiy
et al., 2010). For implementation we selected our own method and
two other classical and well performing methods which were exhaust-
ively described and relatively easy to re-implement. Other methods
will be implemented gradually. Until then, we list all available tools
on the Analysis webpage with their references and online directories.
Another option is a search of the AmyLoad database to determine if
any fragment of the analysed sequence is already known to AmyLoad.
To enhance the service performance, the results are sent by the web
server to the provided e-mail address, so the user does not need to
wait online for completion of selected actions.

3.3 Personalized studies
A registered user obtains the access to additional functionalities of
the AmyLoad website. First, it is possible to create temporary

sessions, which makes the selection of specific fragment subsets eas-
ier. A temporary session can be saved and loaded later by the user,
from the history of saved sessions, any time it is needed. Also, the
AmyLoad website allows the users to contribute information into it.
Registered users may submit their own sequence fragments to the
database in two different ways. The first method is by submission
form where one sequence can be added at a time. The second
method is to upload a properly built XML file which can contain in-
formation about more than one fragment. The structure of such an
XML file is described in the AmyLoad help page along with an ex-
ample of a properly-constructed XML file. Users are apprised of the
status of their submission by e-mail message, and errors are ﬂagged
for correction. Properly submitted sequence fragment data is imme-
diately available to the user who added it in the Added fragments
page. The data is available to the general public, in the database
browsing page, only after review. The review is a compatibility as-
sessment of the provided references and other sequence details. If
the references are not provided, the database curator may ask for
additional information necessary for the sequence evaluation. The
database will accept only experimental data that have been pub-
lished in a reliable peer-reviewed scientific journal.

4 Summary

The AmyLoad website contains almost 1400 unique amyloidogenic
and non-amyloidogenic sequence database entries with detailed infor-
mation and references. Since it gathers data from most of the well-
known amyloidogenic datasets, we believe that it is currently the larg-
est internet data source dedicated to amyloidogenic fragments.
Compared to ZipperDB, AmyLoad contains only experimental data.
Also, AmyLoad collects amyloidogenic fragments of various lengths,
which is different from WALTZ—DB designed for hexapeptides.
Further, AmyLoad provides explicit sequences, differing from
AMYde with templates of amyloid families. Finally, our website
allows submission of new sequences into the database and personal-
ization of a user’s work. We believe that, upon time, it will grow and
become a popular place to deposit and obtain data about newly dis-
covered sequences. By taking advantage of the implemented sequence
analysis methods, the AmyLoad website has the potential of becoming
a powerful amyloidogenicity predicting tool. Results from different
methods can be easily compared, indicating differences and support-
ing their evaluation. Also, a growing number of deposited data will in-
ﬂuence a development of new, improved analytical methods.
Therefore, we strongly encourage all authors of such methods and all
scientists analysing amyloidogenic sequence fragments to contribute
to this service.

Abstract

Motivation: Given the abundance of genome sequencing and omics data, an opprtunity and
challenge in bioinformatics relates to data mining and visualization. The majority of current bio-
informatics visualizations are implemented either as multi-tier web server applications that require
significant maintenance effort, or as client software that presumes technical expertise for installa-
tion. Here we present the Visual Omics Explorer (VOE), a cross-platform data visualization portal
that is implemented using only HTML and Javascript code. VOE is a standalone software that can
be loaded offline on the web browser from a local copy of the code, or over the internet without any
dependency other than distributing the code through a file sharing service. VOE can interactively
display genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics and metagenomics data stored either locally or
retrieved from cloud storage services, and runs on both desktop computers and mobile devices.
Availability and implementation: VOE is accessible at http://bcil.github.ioNOE/.

1 Introduction

Data visualization applications are key for representing, integrating
and mining next-generation sequencing and other types of omics
data. A common paradigm involves omics data visualizations that
are computed on a remote server and displayed through Common
Gateway Interface web pages (UCSC, https://genome.ucsc.edu/), or
using a Java client-server architecture that provides interactive, local
data visualizations (IGV, Robinson et al. 2011). Recently, a number
of omics databases came online that provide rich Application
Programming Interfaces (API, Dooley et al., 2012; Cerami et al.
2012; Paten et al., 2015), or which combine the API with data stor-
age and computational capacity for rent such as Google Genomics
(https://cloud.google.com/genomicsl). Furthermore, a new gener-
ation of omics data visualizations (Almeida et al., 2012; Gémez
et al., 2013; Gille et al., 2014), provide interactive interfaces that

leverage computing within the web browser, and are completely de-
coupled from remote web servers. Here we present the Visual Omics
Explorer (VOE), a data visualization portal that offers dynamic,
mobile-friendly omics data displays, combining the power of APIs
with that of local compute within the browser using Javascript.
VOE provides a diverse set of visualizations (Fig. 1, Supplementary
Fig.51) for data on the Google Genomics Cloud, genetic variants,
ChIP-seq, RNA-seq and phylogenetic data, using HTMLS and,
Javascript — D3 web technologies (https://github.com/mbostock/d3).
VOE is standalone software that can be loaded offline on the web
browser from a local copy of the code (https://github.com/BCIL/
VOE/archive/master.zip, index.html file), over the internet from
GitHub (http://bcil.github.io/VOE/) or online storage such as
Amazon S3 (http://tinyurl.com/BioITCore), and similarly from
Google Drive or Dropbox. VOE has been tested to work on all

current versions of desktop or mobile web browsers, and by using
the PhoneGap framework (http://phonegap.com) we packaged VOE
as a touch-enabled, mobile app for the Android system (http://
tinyurl.com/voe-apk).

2 Implementation

VOE Architectural Design: The VOE portal was implemented using
a skeleton of HTML, with embedded Javascript-D3 code for parsing
the omics data elements and rendering the visualizations, in addition
to providing interactive graphs on the interface by controlling the
CSS transitions. Furthermore, the D3 ‘brush’ function was utilized
to support focusing, zooming and navigation to features of interest
within the visualized data, while D3 parser methods were used to
divide large datasets for computational efficiency. New D3 func-
tions were also written to convert the omics datasets to Scalable
Vector Graphics (SVG), and allow exporting the visualizations in
SVG file format for use in publications. Finally, a new set of func-
tions were implemented also in D3 to parse and index files with vari-
ous bioinformatics data formats, and allow importing omics data to
VOE from local files or cloud storage such as Google Drive and
Dropbox. In addition to the user documentation in the supplemen
tary material, we prepared video screencasts (http://tinyurl.com/bioit

core-voe) demonstrating data analysis with VOE. In summary, VOE
visualizations include: (1). Google Genomics Cloud (video: http://
tinyurl.com/bioitcore-viz-gg). This visualization enables viewing se-
quence read alignments to the reference human genome from the
1000 Genomes and other public projects hosted on Google
Genomics (Fig. 1A, Supplementary Fig. 52). Users can select a spe-
cific project, genome and chromosomal region from the Google
Genomics Cloud, and then navigate through the visualization by
highlighting and zooming into a sequence alignment track showing
variants between reads and the reference genome; (2). ChIP-Seq and
genetic variants (video: http://tinyurl.com/bioitcore-viz-cv). The
visualization of molecular interactions predicted by ChIP-Seq data
analysis pipelines (BED output files) and genetic variants (VCF files,
Danecek et al., 2011), share a similar graphical representation, but
are computed and displayed separately given the different data for-
mats. In more detail, the x-axis on the graph (Fig. 1D,
Supplementary Fig. S3) represents the length of the complete gen-
ome or a specific chromosome selected by the user, while the y-axis
indicates the number of molecular interaction sites for ChIP-Seq, or
the number of genetic variants. By default, the data are grouped in
ten bins, each represented by one point on the graph. Users have the
option to specify the number of bins within a specific chromosome,
and then the graph is automatically recomputed. With selection for
example of 1000 bins on a single chromosome and input file with

48 000 variants (Supplementary files ‘Sample_inputFiles’ in VOE
code), the visualization takes only a few seconds to render. By click-
ing on each point on the line graph, users can see the exact number
or variants included in the bin, and a table of web links is shown
under the graph that redirects to the UCSC Genome database for
further information on the genomic region represented by the bin;
(3). RNA-Seq Gene Expression data (http://tinyurl.com/bioitcore-
viz-rna-seq). Gene expression omics data are visualized in two dis-
plays (Fig. 1B, Supplementary Fig. S4), with the first being a circular
chart where each chromosome is represented as a slice with a differ-
ent color and size proportional to the number of differentially ex-
pressed genes (P-value< 0.05 as default). Users can adjust the P-
value, and also add or remove chromosomes to the visualization.
The second display shows two lines, each for gene expression levels
in a different experimental condition, and a line corresponding to
expression fold change between conditions. In both displays add-
itional information provide the gene name, chromosome, expression
in FPKM and P-value; (4). PhyloXML data (video: http://tinyurl.
com/bioitcore-viz-phyloxml). VOE displays Sunburst, Radial and
Indented Tree visualizations (Supplementary Fig. SS, Han and
Zmasek, 2009). The Radial tree algorithm (Fig. 1, C2 ) aligns on the
outside the circle the deepest level of nodes, which users can collapse
or expand further by clicking on each. Hovering with the mouse
pointer over a tree node displays the node name, size and branch
length. The Sunburst tree (Fig. 1, C1) displays simultaneously the
hierarchical and quantitative relationship between tree levels, with
the size of an outside slice for example representing the proportion
of a species found under an inner slice for the genus.

3 Discussion

We evaluated VOE with data processed using bioinformatics pipe-
lines (http://galaxy.hunter.cuny.edu:8080/workﬂow/list_published),
running on our local instance of the Galaxy server. For the ChIP-Seq
pipeline (based on Liu et al., 2010) data are for the H3K4 histone
interactions on the MCF breast cancer line (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/
ena/data/view/SRP007976). We visualized the BED output of the
pipeline and identified a large number of interactions on chromo-
some 17 (Supplementary Fig. S3.1), where histone modifications
have been associated with breast cancer (Zhang and Yu, 2011). We
also visualized an RNA-Seq pipeline (Trapnell et al., 2012) output
using prostate cancer data (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/ex
periments/E-MTAB—567l), and found overexpression of the MYC
and TSPAN13 genes (Supplementary Fig. 54.3), known to be
involved in this type of cancer (Arencibia et al., 2009; Koh et al.,
2010). VOE provides an interactive, mobile friendly omics visualiza-
tion platform in the form of self-contained code, running within
the web browser. With release of this software, we aim to present a
new paradigm for bioinformatics visualizations, in contrast to the
complex software stacks and monolithic web server setups. Our im-
plementation uses purely Javascript, and enabled us to easily bundle
VOE as a mobile application. As sequencing is becoming a commod-
ity and with widespread use of powerful, yet portable computational
platforms such as tablets as smartphones, software following a
similar paradigm with VOE running on mobile platforms can

find applications in the clinic and doctor’s offices. Furthermore,
new HTML5 standards (http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/WD-work
ers-2015 0924/) including web workers, allow development of multi-
threaded web browser applications that utilize multiple CPU cores
for scalability. We plan to further develop VOE using these stand-
ards, and also support other developers utilizing our open source
code in this respect.

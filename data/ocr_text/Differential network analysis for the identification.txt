ABSTRACT

Motivation: Identification of differential expressed genes has led to
countless new discoveries. However, differentially expressed genes
are only a proxy for finding dysregulated pathways. The problem is
to identify how the network of regulatory and physical interactions
rewires in different conditions or in disease.

Results: We developed a procedure named DINA (leferential
Network Analysis), which is able to identify set of genes, whose
co-regulation is condition-specific, starting from a collection of condi-
tion-specific gene expression profiles. DINA is also able to predict
which transcription factors (T Fs) may be responsible for the pathway
condition-specific co-regulation. We derived 30 tissue-specific gene
networks in human and identified several metabolic pathways as the
most differentially regulated across the tissues. We correctly identified
TFs such as Nuclear Receptors as their main regulators and demon-
strated that a gene with unknown function (Y EATS2) acts as a negative
regulator of hepatocyte metabolism. Finally, we showed that DINA
can be used to make hypotheses on dysregulated pathways during
disease progression. By analyzing gene expression profiles across
primary and transformed hepatocytes, DINA identified hepatocarci-
noma-speciﬁc metabolic and transcriptional pathway dysregulation.
Availability: We implemented an on-Iine web-tool http://dina.tigem.it
enabling the user to apply DINA to identify tissue-speciﬁc pathways or
gene signatures.

1 INTRODUCTION

Gene Expression Proﬁles (GEPs), measured in different condi-
tions and cell types Via microarrays or, more recently, next gen-
eration sequencing, have been extensively used in computational
systems biology to reverse engineer gene regulatory networks
(Bansal et al., 2007; Marbach et al., 2010). The main use of
reverse engineering has been the identiﬁcation of unknown regu-
latory or functional interactions among genes, microRNAs and
proteins from large datasets (Belcastro et al., 2011; Sumazin
et al., 2011).

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

State-of—the—art reverse-engineering methods model gene net-
works as static processes, i.e. regulatory interactions among
genes in the network (such as direct physical interactions or
indirect functional interactions) do not change across different
conditions or tissue types. However, different cell types, or the
same cell type but in different conditions, may carry out different
functions, and it is expected that their regulatory networks reﬂect
these differences.

Several methods have been proposed to identify active sub-
networks across different conditions from changes in gene
expression. One of the ﬁrst attempts is a general method to
search for ‘active sub-networks’ connecting genes with unexpect-
edly high levels of Differential Expression (Ideker et al., 2002).
This method requires in input a single network, and it identiﬁes
a set of genes (i.e. subnetwork) whose expression changes
across two conditions. However, changes in expression may
be mild or absent, even when the subnetwork is active. Hence,
looking only at the differential expression levels of genes could
be not sufﬁcient. Therefore, more recent approaches at-
tempted to identify Differential Co-regulation (DC) of genes
in the subnetwork (Choi et al., 2009; Kostka et al., 2004;
Langfelder et al., 2011; Leonardson et al., 2010; Ma et al.,
2011; Odibat et al., 2012; Reverter et al., 2006; Watson et al.,
2006; Yinglei et al., 2004). By diﬁ’erentially co-regulated ( DC )
genes, we mean set of genes, which are co-regulated only in a
speciﬁc condition but not in others (de la Fuente, 2010; Ideker
et al., 2012).

The main differences among all of these approaches are in how
the genes to be tested are selected, how co-regulation is measured
(i.e. Pearson Correlation Coefﬁcient or Mutual Information) and
how DC across the conditions is quantiﬁed.

Some of the most advanced methods go beyond pair-wise
co-regulation and aim at automatically identifying de-novo sub-
network(s) containing genes whose co-regulation changes the
most across two or more conditions (Langfelder et al., 2011;
Ma et al., 2011; Odibat et al., 2012). This is achieved by advanced
optimization techniques such as genetic algorithms, which, how-
ever, are computationally intensive (Kostka et al., 2004), as they
require checking all of the possible subnetworks to identify the
ones that are most dysregulated. Hence, these methods are
limited in the number of different conditions that can be com-
pared (Choi et al., 2009; Langfelder et al., 2011; Watson et al.,
2006), and they may require ﬁne tuning of the algorithm param-
eters (Ma et al., 2011).

Differential network analysis

 

Here, we developed and applied a simple but powerful pro-
cedure named DINA (DIfferential Network Analysis), which
differently from other methods does not aim at identifying
de novo subnetworks of genes but rather at identifying whether
a known pathway is differentially coregulated across a set of
conditions. DINA is also able to predict which transcription
factors (TFs) may be responsible for the condition-speciﬁc co-
regulation. DINA requires in input a set of N networks and a set
of M genes, and it aims to identify whether co-regulation among
the M genes in the set changes signiﬁcantly across the N different
conditions.

We ﬁrst applied DINA to identify tissue-speciﬁc pathways,
and their TF regulators, starting from a collection of ~3000
GEPs across 30 different tissues. DINA correctly discovered
that the amino acid and fatty acid metabolic pathways are
speciﬁcally active in liver and kidney (Hakvoort et al., 2011;
Jagoe et al., 2002), despite the level of expression of these en-
zymes being similar across the tissues. DINA correctly identiﬁed
TFs of the nuclear receptor family as the main regulators of these
pathways. DINA also revealed a novel candidate negative regu-
lator of metabolic pathways, YEA T S2, a gene not well charac-
terized WVang et al., 2008). We experimentally veriﬁed its
association to metabolic pathway regulation using starvation
response in primary hepatocytes (Ding et al., 2009).

We then applied DINA to three different hepatocyte cell lines,
from different stages of hepatocarcinoma (HCC). DINA correctly
predicted that the main metabolic pathways, as well as the p53
transcriptional program, get severely dysregulated in HCC.

2 METHODS
2.1 Database of GEPs

We implemented a GEP database in the open source DataBase
Management System PostgreSQL environment. We downloaded all the
MicroArray Gene Expression Markup Language (Brazma et al., 2001)
annotation ﬁles present in the ArrayExpress repository and extracted the
relevant information on the tissue or cell type for each experiment. We then
re—annoted each experiment in a semi-automatic way using the tissue ontol-
ogy eVOC mide et al., 2003).

2.2 Reverse engineering of tissue-speciﬁc gene
co-regulation networks

We classiﬁed 2930 microarrays (Affymetrix HG—U133A and HG-
U133plus2) extracted from ArrayExpress in 30 different tissues. We nor-
malized microarrays independently for each tissue using Robust Multichip
Average as implemented in the R package Bioconductor (Rafael et al.,
2003) (Supplementary Material). We computed the Spearrnan Correlation
Coefﬁcient (SCC) (Hardin et al., 2007) for each pair of probes in each
tissue, obtaining a correlation matrix of dimension 22215 x 22215 (we
excluded control probes) for each tissue. We estimated the SCC signiﬁ-
cance for each pair of probes by computing t statistics of each SCC value
and then using a Student’s t-test distribution to estimate the P—Value. To
control the number of False Positives owing to the multiple hypotheses test
problem, we estimated the degrees of freedom of the t—test distribution
from the data by ﬁtting the parameters of a Student’s t-location—scale dis-
tribution to the t statistics computed for all the probe pairs. We estimated
the parameters by minimizing the squared error between the theoretical
and the empirical distribution (Supplementary Material).

In the construction of the SCC matrices, we did not apply any pre-
ﬁltering step to exclude low-variance probe-sets; however, we applied a

stringent threshold (corrected P 5 0.001) to call a SCC value signiﬁcant,
thus reducing the number of False Positive co-regulatory interactions.

To obtain gene-wise SCC matrices starting from the probe-wise SCC
matrices, we ﬁrst excluded probes that were associated to more than one
gene using the Affymetrix platform HG—U133A Ballester et al. (2010),
but keeping genes associated to more than one probe.

Speciﬁcally, we mapped 12161 genes from the probes in the HG-
U133A Affymetrix platform (Ballester et al., 2010). Of these 12161
genes, 68% of the genes were associated to only one probe, and only
11% of genes were associated to >2 probes (Supplementary Fig. S1).

Hence, for the same pair of genes, there could be multiple values of the
SCC because the same gene can be associated to multiple probes in the
microarray. In this case, we chose to assign to the gene-pair, the ‘signed’
maximal absolute value of SCC across all the different probe pairs. At the
end of the procedure, we thus derived 30 gene-wise networks from the
30 probe-wise networks.

An alternative way to transform the probe-wise SCC matrices to gene-
wise SCC matrices would have been to apply a ‘gene centered’ normal-
ization (Ferrari et al., 2007) of the microarrays using a custom CDF,
before the SCC computation, thus eliminating the problem of multiple
SCC values. We however decided to preserve information on possible
alternative transcripts for future work and for experimental validation.
To demonstrate that our probe-wise to gene-wise network transformation
was robust and comparable with the custom CDF approach, we chose as
a case of study the three cancer cell line networks presented in the Section
3.8. We applied a ‘gene centered normalization’ method recently pro-
posed (Ferrari et al., 2007). Finally, we measured the similarity between
the ‘gene centered’ SCC matrices and the one we obtained with our strat-
egy by computing the 2D correlation (Supplementary Table S1). The
results show that the two approaches yield similar SCC values.

2.3 DINA

DINA requires in input a known set of M genes (i.e. genes belonging to a
known pathway, or known targets of a TF), and it aims at assessing
whether the co-regulation among the genes in the set changes signiﬁcantly
across N networks.

We downloaded the full manually curated list of 186 Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways from Msing
(Liberzon et al., 2011). We selected only those pathways consisting of
genes that were present in our gene networks (i.e. at least 80% of the
genes had to be present) obtaining a ﬁnal list of 110 KEGG pathways
(Supplementary Table S2).

DINA uses an entropy like measure to identify in which tissue(s) a
pathway is active. In information theory, entropy is a measure of the
uncertainty associated to a random variable. If V is a discrete random
variable, then the entropy H(V) can be computed as:

N 1
H(V) ;P(V z)logP(V : 1)

Hence, the entropy H reaches its maximum value when each event is
equi—probable and its minimum, i.e. H(V) = 0, when there is no uncer-
tainty. In our settings, V assumes N categorical values, representing the
N condition-speciﬁc networks. To compute P(V = i), we ﬁrst computed
the number of edges n, connecting the M genes in the it), network (adding

a pseudo-count of 1) for i e {1, .. . , n}, and we then computed
P(V = i) =  P(V = i) can be interpreted as a probability because
i=1 "j

it is a number greater than 0 and it sums to 1 across all the N condition-
speciﬁc networks by deﬁnition. P(V = i) will be equal to 1 only when
the genes in the pathway are speciﬁcally co-regulated (i.e. connected) in
network i and not co-regulated (connected) in any other network. Thus,
P(V: i) represents the probability that M genes in a pathway are
co-regulated only in the it), network and not in the other networks.

G. Gambardella et al.

 

We also developed and tested a slightly modiﬁed version of the
entropy H(V), which also takes into account the pathway topology
(i.e. which genes are connected to which in the known pathway) (Sales
at al., 2012) as described in Supplementary Material. However, in the fol-
lowing analyses, we always used the H(V) formula previously described.

We applied a permutation test in order to assess the entropy signiﬁ-
cance for each one of the KEGG pathways. The null distribution of
H(V) was approximated by selecting a set of N random networks,
with the same density as the original networks, and a set of M random
genes. Random networks were obtained from the original network
by randomly shufﬂing the gene labels. This procedure was repeated
10000 times to estimate the H(V) P-value for each pathway. The
P—Value was then corrected using the Benjamini—Hochberg method
(Benjamini et al., 1995).

2.4 Identiﬁcation of transcriptional regulators of
tissue-speciﬁc pathways

We selected 1358 TFs including putative TFs (Supplementary Table S3)
from a list of 1988 human DNA-binding TFs compiled using information
from public repositories (Ravasi et al., 2010). We mapped the TFs onto
the HG—133A Affymetrix platform using only the probe sets associated to
a single gene.

For each TF, we computed the number of edges connecting it to the
genes in the pathway of interest in each of the 30 Tissue Speciﬁc
Co-regulatory Networks. We then assigned a P—Value to each TF using
the non-parametric Fisher’s exact test, by comparing, in each tissue,
the number of edges between the TF and the genes in the pathway
with the number of all the possible edges between the TF and the
genes minus the real number of edges. The P—Value was corrected using
the Benjamini—Hochberg correction (Benjamini et al., 1995).

2.5 Animals and tissues

Primary cultures of mouse hepatocytes were obtained from two wild-type
mice using the Pichard’s protocol (Pichard et al., 2006). Following col-
lagenase perfusion and sedimentation, primary hepatocytes were washed
and seeded at a density of 105 per well in gelatin-coated dishes (0.1%
Gelatin Type I from porcine skin, Sigma). Cells were cultured in Williams
E medium (Gibco, 12551) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal
bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen), 50U Penicillin—Streptomycin 100x
Solution (P/S Gibco 15140-122), 1% L—glutamine. After 5h, the
medium was replaced with Williams E medium supplemented with
Hepatozyme-sfm medium (Gibco 17705-021) with 5% heat-inactivated
FBS (Invitrogen), 50 U Penicillin—Streptomycin 100x Solution (P/ S
Gibco 15140-122), 1% L—glutamine and ITS 1x (Insulin Transferrin
Selenium -Sciencell 0803). HeLa cells were seeded at a density of 105
per well in a 6 wells multi-well cultured in complete medium,
Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium (GIBCO BRL) supplemented
with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Invitrogen) and 1% antibiotic/antimy-
cotic solution (GIBCO BRL) and 1% L-glutamine. Primary hepatocytes
and HeLa cells were maintained at 37°C in a 5% CO2-humidiﬁed incu-
bator over-night. After 24 h, the medium was removed and replaced with
starvation medium, Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (Gibco 14025-050)
supplemented with HEPES solution 10 mM.

The cells were collected at different times points from starvation (30
min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 6 h and 8 h). The primary hepatocytes used as control
were seeded at a density of 105 cultured in Williams E medium supple-
mented with Hepatozyme-sfm medium (Gibco 17705-021) with 5% heat-
inactivated FBS (Invitrogen), 50U Penicillin—Streptomycin 100x
Solution (P/S Gibco 15140-122), 1% L-glutamine and ITS 1x (Insulin
Transferrin Selenium -Sciencell 0803). HeLa cells used as control were
seeded at a density of 105 and were cultured in complete medium,
Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium (GIBCO BRL) supplemented
with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Invitrogen)and 1% antibiotic/

antimycotic solution (GIBCO BRL) and 1% L—glutamine. Animal use
and analyses were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the
Animal Care and Use Committee of Cardarelli Hospital in Naples and
authorized by the Italian Ministry of Health.

2.6 mRNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR

The cells were collected at each time point, and mRNA was extracted and
retro-transcribed using the RNeasy mini kit and the Quantitec reverse
transcription kit (Qiagen), respectively. We performed a Quantitative
Real Time PCR reaction, set up in duplicates using the LightCycler
480 SYBR green master mix (Roche), and the ampliﬁcation was per-
formed using a LightCycler 480 Real Time PCR instrument (Roche).
The quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCRs) were carried out using dif-
ferent pairs of primers for human and mouse isoforms of Yeats2. Gapdh
was used as control. The primer sequences for all genes are listed in
Supplementary Table S4. Data analysis was performed using the
LightCycler 480 Software(Roche). GAPDH mRNA levels were used
to normalize the amount of mRNA, and ACts were calculated as the
difference between the average GAPDH Ct and the average of Ct for
each gene.

To asses whether genes change their expression signiﬁcantly in the
qRT-PCR experiments, we used the software package Bayesian
Analysis of Time Series (Angelini et al., 2008). This method is based on
a Bayesian Approach to automatically identify and rank differentially
expressed genes from time-series data according to a Bayes Factor,
where a Bayes Factor less than one means that the gene is differential
express respect to the control.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Construction of a semantic database for
tissue-speciﬁc GEPs

One of the main hurdles in using GEPs from public repositories
is the abysmal state of the experiments’ meta-data containing
information on the biological samples and experimental proto-
cols. To select tissue-speciﬁc GEPs, we built a semantic data-
base, structured according to a human tissue ontology (Hide
et al., 2003), to retrieve and classify, in a semi-automatic
fashion, microarrays from ArrayExpress (Parkinson et al.,
2005). We assigned to each GEP the correct tissue, according
to the available meta-data, and kept only GEPs with a reliable
annotation. We were thus able to collect 2930 high-quality GEPs
(Affymetrix HG—U113A and HG—U133 Plus 2.0 platforms)
for 30 different tissues (Section 2 and Supplementary Tables S5
and S6).

3.2 Reverse engineering of tissue-speciﬁc gene
co-regulation networks

Although Mutual Information has been shown to be a better
alternative to correlation in identifying co-regulated genes
(Basso et al., 2005; Belcastro et al., 2011), we decided to use
the SCC owing to the limited number of GEPs available in the
different tissues. We also decided not to use network pruning
techniques (Faith et al., 2007; Margolin et al., 2006; Soranzo
et al., 2007), as we were not interested to distinguish between
direct and indirect interactions, but rather in how co-regulation
among genes changes across the different tissues.

We ﬁrst normalized GEPs within each tissue (Rafael et al.,
2003); we then computed the SSC (Hardin et al., 2007) for

each pair of probe-sets, retaining only those ones with a signiﬁ-
cant SCC (Section 2). From these 30 probe-set-wise networks, we
built 30 gene-wise networks, by assigning to each probe-set the
corresponding gene (Section 2).

3.3 Validation and analysis of the tissue-speciﬁc
gene networks

To verify the biological relevance of the tissue-speciﬁc gene
networks, we constructed two ‘Golden Standards’: (i) experimen-
tally veriﬁed protein—protein interactions (Bossi et al., 2009;
Xuebing et al., 2008) and (ii) the manually curated Reactome
database of genes and proteins that participate to the same
pathways (Croft et al., 2011).

For each network, we computed the percentage of co-
regulated genes for which a regulatory interaction was conﬁrmed
by one of the two Golden standards [Positive Predictive
Value=TP/(TP+FP)]. As shown in Supplementary Figures S2
and S3, all of the networks have a PPV signiﬁcantly higher than
what would be expected by chance (Section 2). As each network
was constructed using a different number of GEPs, we also
veriﬁed that the difference in performance across the networks
was not related to the number of experiments used for the
construction of each network (Supplementary Fig. S4).

As a further proof of the biological relevance of the tissue-
speciﬁc co-regulation networks, we identiﬁed which interactions
were conserved across the majority of the 30 networks
(Supplementary Table S7): 3235 co-regulatory interactions,
involving 993 distinct genes, were conserved in at least half of
the tissue-speciﬁc networks. Gene Ontology Enrichment
Analysis of these genes revealed an enrichment for ‘housekeep-
ing’ functions such as ribosomal and cell cycle genes
(Supplementary Fig. S5).

3.4 DINA for the identiﬁcation of condition-speciﬁc
pathways

Our working hypothesis is that genes belonging to a condition-
speciﬁc pathway are actively co-regulated only in speciﬁc
conditions when the pathway is active, but not in others,
independently of their absolute level of expression.

To this end, we developed a network-based algorithm, DINA,
which is able to identify whether genes in a known pathway are
signiﬁcantly co-regulated only in speciﬁc conditions, but not in
others (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig. S6). The algorithm
starts with a set of M genes (i.e. genes belonging to a known
pathway) and a set of N networks (i.e. the 30 tissue-speciﬁc gene
networks). It then computes a ‘co-regulation probability’ for the
M genes in each of the N networks; this probability is propor-
tional to the number of edges among the genes in each network.
DINA then quantiﬁes how variable the co-regulation probability
is across the N networks. Variability is quantiﬁed using an
entropy-based measure (H), and its signiﬁcance is estimated
using a permutation test (Section 2). If the M genes in the set
have a similar co-regulation probability across the N networks,
then the entropy H will be high; on the other hand, if the
M genes have a high co-regulation probability only in one (or
few) networks (i.e. the pathway activity is condition-speciﬁc)
than the entropy H will be low (hence, we are interested in path-
ways associated to a low H).

3.5 Identiﬁcation of tissue-speciﬁc pathways using DINA

To test whether DINA was able to identify tissue-speciﬁc path-
ways, i.e. pathways that are actively regulated only in speciﬁc
tissues, we used the full manually curated list of 186 KEGG
pathways from Msing (Kanehisa et al., 2002; Liberzon et al.,
2011) including signaling, metabolic and regulatory pathways.
A pathway in KEGG is a set of genes known to function as a
module according to the literature. From this list, we deleted
disease pathways and pathways not well represented in our net-
works (Section 2), thus obtaining a ﬁnal list of 110 pathways.

By applying DINA to the tissue-speciﬁc networks, we
obtained 22 signiﬁcant pathways (with corrected P5 0.01,
Supplementary Table S8). One of the most signiﬁcant pathways
(i.e. the one with lowest entropy H) was the Glycine, Serine and
Threonine metabolic pathway (KEGG hsa00260). This pathway
was correctly identiﬁed by DINA to be mainly regulated in liver
and kidney, where most of the glycine to serine metabolism
occurs (van de Poll et al., 2004). Interestingly, among the 22
signiﬁcant pathways, nine are metabolic pathways enriched in
liver and kidney (Supplementary Table S8 pathways in bold).

Figure 2A shows the co-regulation probability of the 32 genes
in the Glycine, Serine and Threonine metabolic pathway in
each of the 30 tissues, as previously deﬁned; for comparison,
Figure 2B shows the average expression level of the genes in
the pathway in each of the tissues. Expression levels do not
change signiﬁcantly across the tissues, whereas the co-regulation
probabilities (Fig. 2A) are strikingly different.

We checked for the expression level of the genes encoding for
the enzymes involved in this pathway also in the Gene Atlas
Dataset (Su et al., 2004), a compendium of normal tissues used
to identify where genes are expressed. Using the canonical ex-
pression level threshold of 200 (Su et al., 2004), we found that
only 13 of 32 genes are expressed in liver, and only 2 of 32 are
expressed in Kidney (Supplementary Fig. S7).

Similar considerations applied to the other signiﬁcant meta-
bolic pathways identiﬁed by DINA (with corrected P 5 0.01,
Supplementary Table S8 pathways in bold). Hence, an approach
based on expression levels (and not co-regulation) would not

have been able to identify these tissue-speciﬁc metabolic path-
ways (for the other signiﬁcant metabolic pathways refer to
Supplementary Figs. S8 and S9).

3.6 Identiﬁcation of transcriptional regulators of
tissue-speciﬁc pathways
We wondered whether it was possible to identify TFs regulating

tissue-speciﬁc pathways identiﬁed by DINA. We reasoned that a
TF, controlling a tissue-speciﬁc pathway, may be co-regulated

tiﬁed by DINA.

To this end, we used a list of 1358 human genes including both
genes, whose protein product has a veriﬁed TF activity (Ravasi
et al., 2010), as well as genes encoding proteins with an indirect
transcriptional activity, such as co-factors or scaffolding proteins
(Stella et al., 2010). For each of the nine metabolic pathways
previously identiﬁed as tissue-speciﬁc, and for each TF in the
list, we applied the Fisher’s exact test (Section 2) to select TFs
sharing a signiﬁcant number of edges with the genes in the path-
way only in the tissue(s) where the pathway is active, as shown
in Figure 1B. The regulators identiﬁed for each pathway are
reported in Supplementary Tables S9—S17 [together with the
Benjamini—Hochberg corrected P—Value (Benjamini et al., 1995)].

Table 1 lists the TFs controlling the majority (i.e. seven of
nine) of the metabolic pathways according to our analysis
(Section 2). Considering only genes encoding proteins with a
known TF activity (Table 1 in bold), we correctly identiﬁed
many nuclear receptors as speciﬁc regulators of these pathways
(NR1H4, NR113, ESRRG, HNF 4A). The nuclear receptor
super-family is one of the largest group of TFs involved in the
regulation of different metabolic processes (Francis et al., 2003),
such as the regulation of liver metabolism (Elfaki et al., 2009).

For example, one of the six receptors is HNF 4A, probably the
most famous nuclear receptor in liver, whose mutations are re-
sponsible for monogenic autosomal dominant non-insulin-de-
pendent diabetes mellitus type I (Desvergne et al., 2006). The
protein encoded by this gene controls the expression of several
genes, including hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha, a TF that
regulates the expression of several hepatic genes.

When we considered also genes encoding proteins indirectly
involved in transcription (Ravasi et al., 2010) (Table 1 not in
bold), we identiﬁed, among others, SIRT4 (sirtuin 4), a
member of the sirtuins’family that plays a key role in metabolic

3.7 YEATS2: a negative transcriptional regulator of
metabolic pathways

YEA T S2 was predicted to be the most signiﬁcant negative regu-
lator shared by most of the metabolic pathways (Table 1).
YEA T S2 is expressed at low levels in both liver and kidney
WVu et al, 2009), and little is known about its function.
Recently, it has been demonstrated that YEATS2 interacts
with the Ada-Two-A-Containing complex WVang et al., 2008),
which, together with Spt-Ada-Gcn5-Acetyl—Transferase, is able
to modulate transcription, both by causing chromatin modiﬁca-
tion and by interacting with the TATA-binding proteins (Krebs
et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2008).

To validate our prediction about the involvement of YEATS2
in the transcriptional regulation of metabolism in liver, we
decided to further investigate its function by perturbing hepato-
cytes homeostasis by starvation (Ding et al., 2009).

During starvation, a switch from anabolism to catabolism
occurs (Caro-Maldonado et al., 2011): cells start to mobilize
stored nutrients, such as glycogen and triglycerides, cell growth
is arrested and autophagy is promoted (Ding et al., 2009; Levine
et al., 2008). During starvation, there are large changes in gene
expression that affect speciﬁc metabolic pathways. For example,
genes involved in fatty acid ,B-oxidation are upregulated (Bauer
et al., 2004), whereas genes involved in biosynthesis are down-
regulated (Sokolovic et al., 2008).

We performed a starvation time-course experiment for 8h in
both primary murine hepatocytes and in HeLa cells, by switching
cells from a nutrient-rich medium to a starvation medium
(Section 2). Cells were collected at different time points dur-
ing starvation (30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, 8h). Cells grown in
nutrient-rich medium were used as control.

We measured by qRT—PCR the variation in the expression
level of YEA T S2 in response to starvation in primary hepato-
cytes and HeLa cells (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S10).
YeatsZ is an early response gene, quickly downregulated on star-
vation during the ﬁrst 2 h in primary hepatocytes, as shown
in Figure 3.

We also analyzed the expression proﬁles of a subset of genes
whose expression levels increase following starvation (Bauer
et al., 2004; Yoon et al., 2001): chIa, AcaaIa, Acot2,
Cyp4a10, Cyp4a14 and Ap0A4 (Fig. 3). Moreover, we measured
the expression proﬁles of CRAT, CT SB and PLIN2 in HeLa
cells as shown in Supplementary Fig. S10.

These selected genes were up-regulated, as expected, during the
ﬁrst 4 h of starvation, as shown in Figure 3: chla (Peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor gamma, co-activator 1 alpha)
encoding for a transcriptional co-activators that plays a key
role in the regulation of both carbohydrate and lipid metabolism
(Leone et al., 2005); Acaala (Acetyl-CoA acyltransferase 1A)
encoding a peroxisomal thiolase operating in catabolism of
fatty acid (Bauer et al., 2004) together with ACOT2 (Acyl-
CoA thioesterase 2), which is localized in peroxisomes(Hunt
et al., 2002); Cyp4a10 (Cytochrome P450, family 4, subfamily
a, polypeptide 10) and Cyp4a14 (Cytochrome P450, family 4,
subfamily a, polypeptide 14) encoding two members of

Cytochrome P family able to oxidize a variety of structural com-
pounds, as well as fatty acids (Bauer et al., 2004; van den Bosch
et al., 2007). Genes involved in lipid transport showed an upregu-
lation as well, such as Ap0A4 (Apolipoprotein A4), which
enhances lipid absorption by promoting the assembly and secre-
tion of Chylomicrons (Bauer et al., 2004; Yao et al., 2011).

To probe further the role of YeatsZ and its involvement in
regulation of metabolism in liver, we analyzed an existing
in vivo time-series microarray experiment (ArrayExpress ID
E-MEXP-748) from liver, muscle and adipose tissue of
ApoE3Leiden transgenic mice, exhibiting a humanized lipid
metabolism, treated with high-fat diet (HFD) for 0, 1, 6, 9, or
12 weeks (Kleemann et al., 2010). On HFD feeding, genes
involved in metabolic pathways, such as lipid metabolic pro-
cesses, were found to be upregulated in liver (Kleemann et al.,
2010). Based on these observations, we decided to investigate the
expression of YeatsZ in this mouse model considering only the
liver tissue, and we found that YeatsZ expression is strongly
downregulated in HFD mouse liver (P-Value of 3.38e10_8)
(Kapushesky et al., 2010; Kleemann et al., 2010).

Our results support a previously unreported role of the
scaffolding protein YEATS2 in transcriptional control of the
metabolic response and demonstrate that DINA can be applied
to identify regulators of tissue-speciﬁc pathways.

3.8 Identiﬁcation of disease-speciﬁc pathways
dysregulation using DINA

Gene expression alteration is a common molecular hallmark of
cancer progression. The identiﬁcation of cancer genetic signa-
tures has been successfully exploited for understanding the mech-
anisms of cancer development Matters et al., 2006), as well as

for anticancer therapies selection (Rothenberg et al., 2003) and
diseases prognosis (Dracopoli et al., 2005). Moreover, speciﬁc
cancer-regulated gene networks have been identiﬁed (Mani
et al., 2008; Stella et al., 2010). We wondered whether DINA
could be successfully used to identify selective alterations of co-
regulated gene networks in cancer. As a study model, we focused
on hepatocellular carcinoma, as several cell-lines modeling HCC
progression are available, as well as GEPs measured in these cell
lines. HCC progression involves alterations in many signaling
pathways, such as EGF-Ras-MAPK, AKT-mTOR, Jak-Stat
and NF-kB cascades (Llovet et al., 2008). In addition, inactivat-
ing mutations of the tumor suppressor p53, or p53 loss of ex-
pression, are among the most frequent genetic events associated
with hepatocyte transformation (Bressac et al., 1990; Hinds et al.,
1987), and the dysregulation of p53-dependent genes have been
observed in HCC (Hailﬁnger et al., 2007; Hsu et al., 1993).
Here, we collected 161 GEPs (Supplementary Table S18)
for three human cell-lines: primary hepatocytes (40 GEPs),
hepatoblastoma-derived cell line HepG2 (39 GEPs) and
Hepatocarcinona-derived cell line (Huh7) (82 GEPs). We ﬁrst
tested the ability of DINA to identify DC of p53-dependent
genes across the three cell lines. To this purpose, we built a
gene signature made up by 34 experimentally validated direct
transcriptional targets of p53 (Lim et al., 2007), and we then
applied DINA to this gene signature, as shown in Figure 4.
DINA successfully detected a DC of the p53 target genes
across the three cell lines: the co-regulation probability is high
in normal hepatocytes and to a lesser extent in hepatocellular
carcinoma HEPG2 cell line, carrying a wild-type p53 protein,
and decreases signiﬁcantly in Huh7 cell line, carrying an inactive
p53 protein (Bressac et al., 1990) (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, the
expression level of the p53-target genes did not correlate with
the functional status of the p53 protein in the different cell lines,
thus supporting our previous observation (Fig. 4A) that an

Comparison between the co-regulation probability of the genes in the
signature (black) and their average expression level

expression-based method would be less powerful than the
DINA in identifying dysregulated pathways.

We next applied DINA to identify dysregulated pathways
during hepatocytes transformation. The DINA-based analysis
of the 110 KEGG pathways identiﬁed at least four pathways
whose co-regulation is signiﬁcantly disrupted in the HCC cell
lines compared with the normal hepatocytes (Supplementary
Table S19). Similarly to the previous results, the average expres-
sion levels of the genes in these pathways did not change signiﬁ-
cantly between normal and transformed hepatocytes.

Interestingly, the most signiﬁcant loss of co-regulation
observed in transformed hepatocytes involves the peroxisome
metabolism (KEGG k004146), the primary bile acid biosynthesis
(map00120) and the glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism
(map00630): these pathways are responsible for fundamental
functions in liver cells such as the synthesis of bile acids, choles-
terol, the oxidation of fatty acid, the metabolism of phenyala-
nine, the glyoxylate and the tyrosine metabolism. Moreover,
among the other dysregulated pathways identiﬁed by DINA,
we found disruption of fundamental pathways regulating liver
cancer progression such as the PPAR signaling pathway
(Supplementary Table S19).

To gain further insights into the dysregualtion of the
peroxisome metabolism, we analyzed the changes in the gene
co-regulation network among the corresponding genes across
the three cell lines. Figure 5A and B demonstrates that there
is a major loss of co-regulation among peroxisome-related
genes in both HepG2 and Huh7 HCC cell lines; moreover, this
loss mainly results from dysregulation of genes involved in
peroxisomal fatty acid ,B-oxidation (e.g. ACOX, EHHADH,
ACAAl) and genes involved in the control of the H202 metab-
olism (e. g. CAT and SOD). Notably, these genes are regulated
by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha
(PPARalpha) (Reddy et al., 2001) and the LXR family TFs
(Hu et al., 2005).

Thus, our results indicate that the dysregulation in the activity
of these liver-speciﬁc transcription regulators may represent a
recurrent event associated with HCC. Consistent with these
results, peroxisome and PPARalpha pathway alterations have
been deﬁnitely associated with liver cell proliferation and with
HCC development (Gonzalez et al., 2008), conﬁrming the efﬁ-
cacy and speciﬁcity of DINA algorithm in identifying condition-
speciﬁc pathway regulation.

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

In this study, we hypothesized that genes belonging to a
tissue-speciﬁc pathway are actively co-regulated, and hence
co-regulated, only in speciﬁc tissues where the pathway is
active, but not in others, independently of their absolute level
of expression. We proposed an approach (DINA) based on
quantifying the variability in the co-regulation probability of
genes across tissues or conditions. DINA is based on detecting
differences in the number of edges among genes in a pathway
across a set of networks, and, therefore, it can be applied to any
kind of network, independently of how this is generated. DINA,
however, is not able to detect distinct network topologies that
have equal density. Differently from other methods, DINA does
not aim at identifying de novo subnetworks of genes, but rather

Differential network analysis

(M6391) in primary and transformed hepatocytes. Genes in the peroxi-
some pathway are represented as circles; a signiﬁcant co-regulation be-
tween two genes as a line. The size of the circles is proportional to the
difference in the number of edges between the network in transformed
hepatocytes versus primary hepatocytes. Gray lines represent edges lost in
the network compared with primary cells. (A) HepG2 versus primary

at identifying whether a known pathway (or a set of genes of
interest) is differentially coregulated across a set of conditions.

We derived 30 tissue-speciﬁc gene co-regulation networks and
identiﬁed several metabolic pathways as the most differentially
regulated across the tissues, and speciﬁcally active in liver and
kidney. Usually, tissue speciﬁcity of a gene, or of a pathway, is
assessed by quantifying the expression level of the genes in the
concerned tissue (Shlomi et al., 2008). However, observing gene
expression only could be not sufﬁcient, as in the case of meta-
bolic pathways (Gille et al., 2010). Here, we show that an alter-
native possibility is to check whether the genes involved in the
same pathway are speciﬁcally co-regulated in the concerned
tissue. Of note, a similar approach has been successfully applied
in yeast (Kharchenko et al., 2005).

We also demonstrated that tissue-speciﬁc targets of a TF tend
to be co-regulated with the TF in a tissue-speciﬁc manner.
Hence, we developed a new method based on the Fisher’s

exact test to identify tissue speciﬁc TFs. We tested this approach
to identify regulators of tissue-speciﬁc metabolic pathways and
correctly identiﬁed Nuclear Receptors as their main regulators.
We were also able to identify a new putative tissue-speciﬁc nega-
tive regulator of heptocyte metabolism (YeatsZ). Finally, we
showed that DINA can be used to analyze GEPs obtained
during disease progression to make hypotheses on dysregulated
pathways.

The identiﬁcation of differential expressed genes in disease
compared with normal conditions is a standard practice in
laboratories all over the world, and it has led to countless new
discoveries. However, differentially expressed genes are only a
proxy for ﬁnding dysregulated pathways. Indeed, the real ques-
tion one would like to answer is which pathways get dysregulated
during disease progression, to understand the pathogenic mech-
anisms. Recent efforts have shown that using high-throughput
phospho-proteomics in conjunction with signaling network
models can be used to identify differences in signaling pathways
between normal and transformed hepatocytes (Saez-Rodriguez
et al., 2011).

Here, we demonstrated that DINA is able to gain information
about HCC-speciﬁc metabolic and transcriptional pathway dys-
regulation by quantifying changes in co-regulation among genes
across primary and transformed hepatocytes. It remains to be
seen whether changes in signaling pathway activity can be de-
tected using only a transcription-based approach such as DINA.

We also implemented an on-line web tool (http://dina.tigem.it)
enabling the user to apply DINA to identify tissue-speciﬁc path-
ways or gene signatures.

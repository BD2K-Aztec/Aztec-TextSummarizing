ABSTRACT

Motivation: Real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)
is an important tool in quantitative studies of DNA and RNA molecules;
especially in transcriptome studies, where different primer combin-
ations allow identification of specific transcripts such as splice variants
or precursor messenger RNA. Several softwares that implement vari-
ous rules for optimal primer design are available. Nevertheless, as
designing qPCR primers needs to be done manually, the repeated
task is tedious, time consuming and prone to errors.

Results: We used a set of rules to automatically design all possible
exon—exon and intron—exon junctions in the human and mouse tran-
scriptomes. The resulting database is included as a track in the UCSC
genome browser, making it widely accessible and easy to use.
Availability: The database is available from the UCSC genome brow-
ser (http://genome.ucsc.edu/), track name ‘Whole Transcriptome
qPCR Primers’ for the hg19 (Human) and mm10 (Mouse) genome
versions. Batch query is available in the following: http://www.weiz

1 INTRODUCTION

Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is an efﬁcient
tool to quantify changes in abundance of DNA/ RNA molecules.
Its main advantage is that it has a large dynamic range and
requires only basic sample preparation steps (reverse transcrip-
tion of RNA). Double-stranded DNA dye (such as SYBR) based
qPCR quantiﬁes the amount of double-stranded DNA in a
sample. A pair of speciﬁc primers ampliﬁes a short (usually
60—130bp) DNA region, and the emitted light is measured
after every cycle. The qPCR platforms allow measurement in
parallel (on the same plate) of many different reactions, which
saves time and work and reduces technical bias. Primer design
for qPCR is a relatively simple but repetitive time-consuming
task. The ﬁrst step is to choose a target sequence, for which
one then has to deﬁne constraints about the primers’ product
and reaction conditions. Then, available software (e.g. primer3,
Rozen and Skaletsky, 2000; Untergasser et al., 2012) is used to

get the set of best suggested primer pairs. When browsing RNA
transcripts, the target sequence should be determined and
selected carefully because of constraints such as product size,
ampliﬁcation of a single product and, in particular, the need to
amplify a speciﬁc isoform of a given gene. Moreover, as qPCR
platforms enable performing measurements for a large number
of genes in parallel, the user has to repeat many times the task of
target sequence selection and primer design manually, which can
be tedious and prone to human errors. As an example, in the
most frequent case, of measuring mRNA, one wishes to amplify
an exon—exon junction, picking the sequences of both exons and
imposing the constraint of having the forward primer on the 5’
exon and the reverse primer on the 3’ exon; see also Sandhu and
Acharya (2005) discussed in Supplementary Information.

2 APPROACH

We carried out an automatic primer design procedure to target
all possible transcripts and all ‘possible’ exon—exon and intron—
exon junctions in the human and mouse transcriptomes. Not all
consecutive exon—intron—exon triplets generate ‘possible’ primer
pairs (i.e. satisfy the constraints). The resulting suggested primer
pairs can be easily viewed as a track in the UCSC genome brow-
ser, making the application available to a broad audience. Our
procedure uses the UCSC gene model as a reference of the gene
structure and the primer3 software (release 2.3.2, http://frodo.wi.
mit.edu/) as the design engine. The software goes over all pos-
sible consecutive exon—intron—exon triplets in the transcriptome
and applies our design rules. We search for a primer pair to
amplify the intron—exon junction and then use the reverse
primer (interrogating the 3’ exon) to ﬁnd a forward primer on
the 5’ exon. The two primer pairs share the same reverse primer
(see Fig. 1A). To provide a choice of primer pairs (i) the last step
is done twice to yield another forward primer, and (ii) the entire
process is done twice for each triplet.

3 METHODS
Detailed design rules:

(1) Do not address the ﬁrst exon—exon junction to avoid problems
related to abortive transcription.

(2) Intron length should be >800 bp to avoid problems of double
products in ampliﬁcation.

(3) We design only junction primers so that forward and reverse
primers must ﬂank the junction.

(4) Melting temperature should be between 60 < Tm < 63 [optimal 60.5
according to Breslauer et a]. (1986) tables].

between exons 2 and 3 is ampliﬁed (intron >800 bp), whereas between 3

(5) Primer length should be 18—25 bp.
(6) Product size should be 60—125 bp.

(7) We ﬁrst design primers for the intron—exon junction [precursor mes-
senger RNA (pre—mRNA)], we pick the two best primer pairs and
then for both reverse primers, we design two options for the corres-
ponding forward primer of the exon—exon junction (mRNA).

(8) We use the ‘PRIMER MISPRIMING LIBRARY’ of the primer3
software: ‘human’ for human and ‘rodent’ for mouse transcrip-
tome, respectively.

Manual:
To use the database via the UCSC genome browser, follow these steps:

(1) In the browser, select organism: ‘human’ or ‘mouse’.
(2) Browse to your gene of interest.

(3) To view the track ‘Whole transcriptome qPCR primers’ scroll
down the page to the panel of suggested tracks named
‘Expression’. Turn the ‘qPCR primers’ to ‘pack’ (see Fig. 2A)
and press refresh.

(4) Use the UCSC browser tools to zoom in to speciﬁc regions of
interest (see example in Fig. 2B).

(5) View the primer pairs we suggest. In red are the primers designed
to amplify pre-mRNA, and in blue are the primers designed to
amplify mRNA. For each pre-mRNA primer pair, there are two
corresponding mRNA primers (that use the same reverse primer, if
possible). Each pair has a unique code, which stands for the gene
name and the junction name. For example, the pair ‘NR4A1
_uc009zmc.3_2_1’ ampliﬁes pre-mRNA, and the corresponding
mRNA primers are ‘NR4A1_uc009zmc.3_2_1_1’ and ‘NR4A1
_uc009zmc.3_2_l_2’. The naming scheme is as follows: ‘NR4A1’
is the gene symbol, ‘uc009zmc.3’ is the UCSC Genes identiﬁer of
the isoform, ‘2’ identiﬁes the exon—intron—exon triplet, ‘1’ is the
number (1 or 2) of the suggested pair for intron—exon junction. The
names of primer pairs that cover intron—exon junctions end here.
For the exon—exon junctions that use the same reverse primer,
there is one additional number, which can be 1 or 2.

(6) Click on the primer pair you select; this will take you to a new page
with details, Figure 2C.

(7) Clicking on the number next to ‘Click here for primer details’
opens a new page with the primer properties (see Fig. 2D).

(8) For design of a large number of primers, we recommend using our
batch query, which converts a list of Primer Names to a table of
primer details. Batch query is possible from our website, accessible
either directly: Batch Query (http://www.weizmann.ac.il/complex/
compphys/software/Amit/primers/batch_query_qpcr_primers.htm)
or from the UCSC browser (under ‘Description’).

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

We created databases for primer pairs to be used for ampliﬁca-
tion of intron—exon and exon—exon junctions by qPCR, genome-
wide, for human and mouse; in total, 534 301 pairs for human
(and 518230 for mouse) targeting 17929 (and 18039) different
genes in human (and mouse). Many of the primer pairs in the
database were tested successfully in various experiments [success
rate >90%, see Supplementary File 1 and Supplementary
Information and Zeisel et al. (2011)]. The databases are access-
ible as a track in the UCSC browser. Optionally users can access
our web server to obtain, in batch mode, primer pairs for a large
number of junctions of interest.

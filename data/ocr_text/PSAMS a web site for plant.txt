Abstract

Summary: The Plant §mall RNA Maker §ite (P-SAMS) is a web tool for the simple and automated
design of artificial miRNAs (amiRNAs) and synthetic trans-acting small interfering RNAs (syn-
tasiRNAs) for efficient and specific targeted gene silencing in plants. P-SAMS includes two applica-
tions, P-SAMS amiRNA Designer and P-SAMS syn-tasiRNA Designer. The navigation through both
applications is wizard-assisted, and the job runtime is relatively short. Both applications output the
sequence of designed small RNA(s), and the sequence of the two oligonucleotides required for
cloning into ’B/c’ compatible vectors.

Availability and implementation: The P-SAMS website is available at http://p-sams.carringtonlab.

1 Introduction

Artificial miRNAs (amiRNAs) and synthetic trans-acting small inter-
fering RNAs (syn-tasiRNAs) are two classes of designed small RNAs
used to silence plant transcripts with high sequence complementarity
(Ossowski et al., 2008; Tiwari et al., 2014; Zhang, 2014). AmiRNA
and syn-tasiRNA differ in their biogenesis but are functionally simi-
lar. Methods to computationally design plant small RNAs are based
on several criteria, including the requirement for a high degree of
small RNAztarget RNA base pairing (Ahmed et al., 2015; Ossowski
et al., 2008; Schwab et al., 2006).

We recently reported efficient molecular methods to generate
amiRNA and syn-tasiRNA constructs by ligation of synthesized
dsDNA oligonucleotides that include the amiRNA or syn-tasiRNA
sequence into ‘B/c’ expression vectors (Carbonell et al., 2014,
2015). B/c amiRNA vectors were tested in both monocots and eudi-
cots and express a single amiRNA that targets one or multiple

sequence-related transcripts. B/c syn-tasiRNA vectors express sev-
eral syn-tasiRNAs targeting sequence-unrelated transcripts in
Arabidopsis and closely related species.

P-SAMS is a wizard-assisted web tool for the simple and
automated design of plant amiRNAs and syn-tasiRNAs. P-SAMS in-
cludes two applications, P-SAMS amiRNA Designer and P-SAMS
syn-tasiRNA Designer. Both applications output a list of
recommended amiRNA or syn-tasiRNA, and the sequence of the two
oligonucleotides required for cloning into compatible B/c vectors.

2.1 Computational design ofartificial small RNAs

The computational design of amiRNA and syn-tasiRNA is similar.
All possible target sites are identified by cataloging the complete set
of 21-nucleotide sequences from all input transcripts, including

isoforms (foreground set). If off-target filtering is enabled, the fore-
ground target site set is filtered to remove sites that contain a 15 -nu-
cleotide sequence from positions 6—20 (core target pairing sequence)
that perfectly match a transcript that is not contained in the input
set (background set). The remaining sites are grouped by the core
target pairing sequence, and only target site groups that contain all
input genes are considered further. Grouped sites are scored and
ranked based on group-wise similarity and the identity of nucleo-
tides at specific positions (positions 1, 2, 3 and 21). For each group
of sites, a guide RNA is designed to target all sites with the add-
itional criteria that (i) the guide RNA has a 5’ U nucleotide, (ii) pos-
ition 19 of the guide is a C and (iii) position 21 is intentionally
mismatched. Finally, P-SAMS uses TargetFinder (Fahlgren and
Carrington, 2010) to predict target RNAs for each guide RNA.
Guide RNAs predicted to target exclusively transcripts from input
gene set are output as ‘Optimal Results’; guide RNAs predicted to
target transcripts from non-input genes are output as ‘Sub-optimal
Results’. Up to three optimal and/or sub-optimal results are
returned.

2.2 Website description and navigation

P-SAMS has a user-friendly interface and wizard-assisted navigation
that guides the user during the design process. The wizard asks ques-
tions or requests information. To advance, questions are answered
by clicking the button with the desired option, or the requested in-
formation is entered before clicking the ‘Next’ button. Help boxes
pop out when ‘Help’ is clicked. The user can navigate back to the
previous window by clicking the ‘Back’ button, or re-start the whole
design process by clicking ‘Start Over’. When submitting a job, (i)
warning messages alert the user to possible problems with the input
information or combination of choices, and (ii) error messages are
displayed if the user adds incorrect information. Median job time
for single-targeting amiRNA design using P-SAMS was 2.45 and
3.22 min in Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa, respectively
(n=50 randomly selected target genes in both cases). Results in-
clude the sequence of the guide RNA and the sequence of the two
oligonucleotides required for cloning in compatible B/c vectors.
Also, for each designed guide RNA, a summary of TargetFinder re-
sults is displayed. In the P-SAMS syn-tasiRNA Designer results
page, the user navigates to the ‘Build Construct’ page to build the
syn-tasiRNA construct.

The ‘Frequently Asked Questions’ section includes links to
the cloning protocol and to B/c vectors-related information, video
tutorials and additional instructions. The ‘About’ section
provides information regarding contact, author contributions,
methods, software, how to cite, acknowledgements and the MIT
License.

3 Implementation

P-SAMS website uses several modern libraries to interface with the
user. The look-and-feel of the website was created using the CSS li-
brary Bootstrap 3 (www.getbootstrap.com). The front end was writ-
ten with AngularJS (https://angularjs.org/), and the backend with a
RESTful model on top of the Symfony2 (http://symfony.com/) PHP
framework. Symfony acts as the middle layer between the P-SAMS
job scheduler daemon and the web application front end. P-SAMS
source code was written in Perl and uses MySQL (http://www.
mysql.com/) to store the plant species databases. P-SAMS daemon is
a Python script that coordinates JSON input/output between P-
SAMS and Symfony web service. If the target specificity module is
activated, P-SAMS runs TargetFinder v.1.7 (https://github.com/car-
ringtonlab/TargetFinder) on a single CPU or in parallel using the
Terascale Open-source Resource and QUEue Manager.

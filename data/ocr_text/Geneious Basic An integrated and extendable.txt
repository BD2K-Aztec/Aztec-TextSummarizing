ABSTRACT

Summary: The two main functions of bioinformatics are the
organization and analysis of biological data using computational
resources. Geneious Basic has been designed to be an easy-
to-use and flexible desktop software application framework for
the organization and analysis of biological data, with a focus
on molecular sequences and related data types. It integrates
numerous industry-standard discovery analysis tools, with interactive
visualizations to generate publication-ready images. One key
contribution to researchers in the life sciences is the Geneious public
application programming interface (API) that affords the ability to
leverage the existing framework of the Geneious Basic software
platform for virtually unlimited extension and customization. The
result is an increase in the speed and quality of development of
computation tools for the life sciences, due to the functionality
and graphical user interface available to the developer through the
public API. Geneious Basic represents an ideal platform for the
bioinformatics community to leverage existing components and to
integrate their own specific requirements for the discovery, analysis
and visualization of biological data.

Availability and implementation: Binaries and public API
freely available for download at http://www.geneious.com/basic,
implemented in Java and supported on Linux, Apple OSX and MS
Windows. The software is also available from the Bio-Linux package
repository at http://nebc.nerc.ac.uk/news/geneiousonbl.

1 INTRODUCTION

Research in the biosciences increasingly depends upon
bioinformatics for the effective organization and analysis of
biological data and experimental results. Having access to the
appropriate bioinformatics tools is crucial to the success of any
research project. The ﬁeld of bioinformatics itself has previously
been segregated into the parallel realms of data organization

(databases, access, integration, web services and search tools)
and data analysis (efﬁcient algorithms and statistical modeling).
As a result, a large proportion of bioinformatics work involves the
chaperoning of data from a variety of sources through a pipeline of
analysis tools. This approach typically involves a number of ad hoc
labor—intensive steps to convert ﬁle formats and create transitional
ﬁle types. Geneious Basic was created to provide a general
framework for research—focused bioinformatics tasks to overcome
these challenges and take advantage of modern computing trends.
Highlights of the platform include automated database searching,
data backup functionality and an extensible API for the integration
of novel bioinformatics analysis tools.

2 METHODS

Geneious Basic is written in Java Swing to maximize interoperability
among all commonly used Operating systems. It is compiled under and
requires Java 5 to run. The application provides core modules to enable the
visualization, manipulation and transfer of DNA sequences (linear, circular
and short Oligos such as primers and probes), amino acid sequences, pair—
wise and multiple alignments, phylogenetic trees, 3D structures, sequence
chromatograms, contig assemblies, microsatellite electropherograms and
statistical graphs.

The underlying software framework for Geneious Basic is modular
and multi—tiered with a focus on handling bioinformatics data and tools
(Fig. 1). It integrates a comprehensive plugin system which is grounded
in the extensible Geneious API. The public API component allows
plugin developers to leverage the functionality and user interface of the
Geneious platform while concentrating on the development of processes and
algorithms. The API download from the Geneious website provides a number
of skeleton plugin examples to use as a basis for new plugins, allowing
developers with a basic level of Java knowledge to develop fully functional
plugins that greatly extend the functionality of Geneious Basic.

The public API allows developers to leverage online sequence search
web services such as NCBI BLAST. Also using the public API, developers
can implement plugins that exploit external binaries and even online
computational resources, a growing trend in the ﬁeld of Bioinformatics
(Schatz et 01., 2010).

3 RESULTS

The Geneious Basic graphical user interface comprises of three
main panels, a variety of pull—down menus and many right—click

functions for common bioinformatics analyses. Geneious Basic
displays selected ﬁle(s) in a variety of different ways including
sequence view (linear and circular), dotplot view, query—centric
alignment view, protein domain view, 3D structure view, text view
and notes.

A number of analysis algorithms are implemented within
Geneious Basic. For a given document, the user can select from
among the appropriate analysis tools to process the data; for
example, in the case of a sequence document, the user may choose
to perform a BLAST (Altschul et al., 1990) search for a given
query sequence against a speciﬁc online repository, align against
other sequences or generate protein translations. The combinations
of available tools and document types allow for the implementation
of complex workﬂows in a single, consistent environment (Fig. 2).

Geneious Basic has an active community of plugin developers,
using the public API to contribute third—party plugins and additional
functionality within Geneious. The Species Delimitation Plugin, a
plugin for summarizing measures of phylogenetic support for user—
selected collections of taxa on user—supplied trees (Masters et al.,
2011), is one example of scientiﬁc research leveraging the Geneious
public API for publishable academic research. At the time of the
writing of this manuscript, there were nine available plugins for
Geneious Basic (Table 1), from plugins wrapping industry standard

4 DISCUSSION

The functionality in Geneious Basic can be compared with a number
of other desktop software packages, such as VectorNTI (Lu and
Moriyama, 2004), CLC Bio, Sequencher (GeneCodes), Lasergene
(DNAstar) and MEGA4 (Tamura et al., 2007). In comparison to
the above, the focus of Geneious Basic is to provide an extensible
desktop platform in which existing components can be leveraged
by third—party plugin developers. This is a unique and important
contribution to bioinformatics, allowing users to customize and
extend core to their needs without signiﬁcant manual intervention,
matching the success of extensible platforms in parallel spaces such
as network analysis and workﬂow management (Goecks et al., 2010;
Smoot et al., 2010). Also comparable is Geneious Pro (Drummond
et al., 2010), a commercial extension to Geneious Basic. It shares the
base functionality of Geneious Basic and additionally provides tools
focused on data sharing, collaboration and advanced next— generation
sequencing functionality.

Geneious Basic brings together a large and disparate number of
complementary data sources, analysis methods and visualization
tools. It is the intention of the authors that by encouraging
development to the public API new analysis methods and
visualization tools will continue to grow and diversify the range
of bioinformatics tasks available to all researchers.

Geneious Basic is cross—platform and is available for Linux,
Apple OSX and MS Windows as a standalone download. It is
also available as a preconﬁgured package in the comprehensive
Bio—Linux operating system (Field et al., 2006).

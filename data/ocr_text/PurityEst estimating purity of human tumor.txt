ABSTRACT

Summary: We developed a novel algorithm, PurityEst, to infer the
tumor purity level from the allelic differential representation of hetero-
zygous loci with somatic mutations in a human tumor sample with a
matched normal tissue using next-generation sequencing data. We
applied our tool to a whole cancer genome sequencing datasets
and demonstrated the accuracy of PurityEst compared with DNA
copy number-based estimation.

Availability: PurityEst has been implemented in PERL and is available

1 INTRODUCTION

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) provides a platform to com-
prehensively characterize somatic mutations, DNA copy number
changes and rearrangements in tumor tissues. Because tumor
tissues usually consist of a mixture of multiple tumor clones
and normal cells including fibroblasts and infiltrating lympho-
cytes, the observed magnitude of copy number changes is dimin-
ished, which is basis of tumor clone purity estimation using SNP
array data (Bengtsson et al., 2010; Carter et al., 2012; Loo et al.,
2010; Sun et al., 2009; and Yu et al., 2011). Gusnanto et a].
(2011) converted mapped reads to DNA copy number ratios
between tumor and normal genomes for purity estimation. In
principle, NGS also provides an alternative to copy
number-based methods, which is to use mutant allele fractions
in the heterozygous loci with somatic mutations in a tumor mix-
ture. However, modeling the mutant allele fractions is compli-
cated by two factors. One is that mutant allele fractions in a
sample may take multiple levels. The founder mutations may
have the higher levels and latent mutations lower levels.
The second factor is that copy number change can also alter
the observed fractions. When the mutant allele is amplified, the
observed mutant allele fraction can be increased; when the
wild-type allele is amplified (lost), the mutant allele fraction
can be decreased (increased). When the mutant allele is lost,
the mutant allele is simply not observable.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Here, we propose a simple approach to the purity estimation
problem. We assume that the tumor tissue can be largely approxi-
mated by a mixture of a normal clone and a tumor clone. Our
method gives a purity estimate from somatic mutations in each
chromosome and takes a robust average of the chromosome-wide
estimates to be the purity estimate of the tumor tissue. Since copy
number changes can both enrich and deplete the fractions of
mutated alleles depending on whether the copy number change
occurs to the mutated allele or the wild allele, it is unlikely to affect
the chromosome-wide estimate drastically.

2 METHODS

We call our method PurityEst, which estimates the fraction of tumor
DNA molecules that is different from the normal matched tissue. A
pure tumor sample should show a mean frequency of 0.5 for mutant
alleles at heterozygous loci with somatic mutations, whereas contamin-
ation of tumor tissue with normal tissue is expected to lower the mutant
allele fractions. The tumor purity y is inferred from the allelic differential
representation of heterozygous loci with somatic mutations comparing
a tumor sample and a matched normal tissue using the following
formulation:

y=ﬂ
Mx

where My 2 #23» is the mutant allele fraction obtained from the tumor
sample, and A,- indicates the wild allele count, B, the mutant allele count
in the heterozygous loci with somatic mutations, the summations include
all heterozygous loci with somatic mutations; ux 2 % is the mutant
allele fraction obtained from the normal sample and A , indicates the wild
allele count, B,- the mutant allele count in SNP heterozygous loci, the
summations include all the SNP heterozygous loci attributed to gerrnline
mutations. Note that the set of the somatic mutations is assumed to be
mutually exclusive with the set of gerrnline mutations and the latter set is
usually much greater than the former. Theoretically, the expected value of
ux is 0.5. However, empirical data showed that the mean value is typically
slightly lower than 0.5, which suggests that different alleles are not equally
represented with the current sequencing technology. Hence, we choose
to use the computation of the empirical value of ax to correct for this
representational bias.

The above formulation does not explicitly consider effects of copy
number gains and losses in tumor genomes, which can bias the tumor
purity estimation. However, based on our empirical observations, the
biases appear to affect only a small fraction of the tumor genome.
Therefore, to minimize the effect of such biases, we choose to estimate
tumor purity from each autosome y,- separately, and obtain a ﬁnal esti-
mate from robustly averaging the 74-, excluding the outliers. In PurityEst,
we implemented the “extreme studentized deviate” (ESD) multiple-outlier

procedure (Rosner, 1983) to remove the outliers. The tumor purity was

estimated by: )7 = %Z?=1 y,- and SE); = in where n is the number of auto-
somes excluding the outliers, and SE? is the estimated error from the

sample standard deviation.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

To test the accuracy of PurityEst method, we re—analyzed a pub-
lically available dataset (Berger et al., 2011). The dataset was
generated with Illumina GAII, containing 7 matched prostate
cancer samples with the paired-end 76 nt reads. We used
MOSAIK (Hiller et al., 2008) to align the reads to the reference
genome (GRCh37/hgl9) and used GigaBayes (Marth et al.,
1999) to detect the single-nucleotide variations (SNVs). We ﬁl-
tered out all known SNVs based on two public databases: UCSC
dbSNP 135 and the 1000 Genomes Project SNP database. We
then determined the somatic status of each SNV by comparing
the genotypes between matched normal tissue and tumor sam-
ples. Both wild and mutant allele counts at each heterozygous
loci of both SNPs and somatic mutations were generated by
GigaBayes. The tumor samples have a mean genomic coverage
ranging from 29.5 to 35.8, and the matched normal tissue sam-
ples with a mean coverage ranging from 18.8 to 34.9.

To estimate the tumor purity for the samples, we first esti-
mated the tumor purity level for each autosomal chromosome
in a sample. We removed the outliers in the overall tumor purity
estimation when the outliers were detected. Figure 1A showed
the autosomal purity levels of one of the samples. The purity
level estimated from chromosome 10 was found to be substan-
tially lower than other chromosomes. It is not clear what caused
this outlier, as no major copy number change in the chromo-
some. One possible cause is that the tumor was made of multiple
clones, and chromosome 10 was protected from mutation.
Alternatively, it was caused by representational bias. We note
that had the chromosome corresponded to an outlier with high
fraction of mutated alleles, we would have attributed the results
to founder mutations.

Figure 1B showed the PurityEst estimates along with the esti-
mates reported by Berger et al. (2011), who used copy number
changes derived from SNP array data of the same seven prostate
cancer samples. The correlation coefﬁcient between the two
kinds of estimates is 0.91, demonstrating that PurityEst estimates
are consistent with that from DNA copy number data.

In summary, we showed that PurityEst can be used to estimate
tumor purity based on mutant allele fractions in a mixture of a
tumor clone and a normal clone. Multiple factors, such as cover-
age, copy number changes and representational bias can all poten-
tially affect the purity estimation. Our method can handle some,
but not all of the effects. When adequate coverage is available, our
method may be extended to model multiple mutant allele fractions
that reﬂect intra-tumor heterogeneity. We expect our method to be
a simple and effective solution for tumor purity estimation in
cancer studies and invite users to test our software.

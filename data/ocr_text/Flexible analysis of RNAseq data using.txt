ABSTRACT

Motivation: Most methods for estimating differential expression
from RNA-seq are based on statistics that compare normalized read
counts between treatment classes. Unfortunately, reads are in general
too short to be mapped unambiguously to features of interest, such as
genes, isoforms or haplotype-specific isoforms. There are methods for
estimating expression levels that account for this source of ambiguity.
However, the uncertainty is not generally accounted for in downstream
analysis of gene expression experiments. Moreover, at the individual
transcript level, it can sometimes be too large to allow useful compari-
sons between treatment groups.

Results: In this article we make two proposals that improve the
power, specificity and versatility of expression analysis using RNA-
seq data. First, we present a Bayesian method for model selection
that accounts for read mapping ambiguities using random effects. This
polytomous model selection approach can be used to identify many
interesting patterns of gene expression and is not confined to detect-
ing differential expression between two groups. For illustration, we use
our method to detect imprinting, different types of regulatory diver-
gence in cis and in trans and differential isoform usage, but many other
applications are possible. Second, we present a novel collapsing
algorithm for grouping transcripts into inferential units that exploits
the posterior correlation between transcript expression levels. The
aggregate expression levels of these units can be estimated with
useful levels of uncertainty. Our algorithm can improve the precision
of expression estimates when uncertainty is large with only a small
reduction in biological resolution.

ware in the mmdiff and mmcollapse multithreaded C++ programs

1 INTRODUCTION

High-throughput sequencing of RNA (RNA-seq) is superseding
microarrays as the standard technology for genome-wide profil-
ing of RNA samples and for differential expression analysis.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

RNA-seq is a technique for generating millions of short subse-
quences called reads from a population of RNA transcripts in
a biological sample. Roughly speaking, the number of reads
generated by a transcript is proportional to its length and
to the number of copies of the transcript in the sample.
Consequently, given an accurate mapping of reads back to tran-
scripts (e. g. from sequence alignments), it is possible to quantify
transcript expression levels from read counts.

Sequencing offers greater dynamic range than microarrays
and, by providing direct observations of complementary DNA
sequences, it allows improved discrimination among isoforms
and haplotypes. Although the methodological literature for
gene expression proﬁling with microarray data is mature, there
remain aspects of RNA-seq data analysis that require further
development. In particular, the principal approaches currently
used for differential expression analysis with RNA-seq (Anders
and Huber, 2010; Hardcastle and Kelly, 2010; Robinson and
Oshlack, 2010; Tarazona et al., 2011) make comparisons between
treatment classes using statistics derived from sequence align-
ment counts. Such approaches are useful for assessing differential
gene expression because, for most genes, an exact read count can
be obtained that is proportional to its expression level. However,
methods based on read counts are not robust to variability in the
relative expression of isoforms because the length of each iso-
form—not only its expression level—inﬂuences the expected
number of gene-level read counts. It can be more accurate to
estimate expression at the gene level by adding up estimates
made at the transcript level than by counting raw alignments
as though each gene produced a single transcript of canonical
length Wang et al., 2010).

A distinct advantage of RNA-seq is that sequencing along
splice junctions and heterozygous loci facilitates the estimation
of expression levels for gene isoforms and even haplotype—speciﬁc
isoforms in polyploid organisms. At the isoform level, raw
counts are not available because the sharing of exons between
isoforms of the same gene means that reads may align to multiple
transcripts. Moreover, sequence homology between genes can
result in reads that map to transcripts belonging to different
genes. For haplotype-speciﬁc analysis, sequence-sharing is even
more extreme as only reads mapping to heterozygous loci allow
transcripts from different haplotypes to be distinguished.
Deconvolution algorithms, which account for the read mapping
ambiguity, can provide estimates of the expression levels of each
transcript and estimates of the associated uncertainties (Glaus
et al., 2012; Turro et al., 2011). Given the large amounts of

Mixed modelling of RNA-seq expression estimates

 

sequence-sharing between transcripts in mammalian transcrip-
tomes, these uncertainties can be considerable and highly vari-
able. Consequently, it is important to account for differential
uncertainty in any statistical analysis based on expression esti-
mates, e. g. when comparing expression levels between treatment
groups. This idea has been pursued previously in the context of
microarray analysis (e. g. Hein and Richardson, 2006; Liu et al.,
2006) but has received less attention in the context of RNA-seq
analysis.

The Cuffdiff 2 software (Trapnell et al., 2012) implements
frequentist hypothesis tests to detect differential expression and
regulation. The methods rely on a number of distributional ap-
proximations, are limited to two-class comparisons and cannot
be used for haplotype-speciﬁc inference. Recently, a Bayesian
model of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) traces for ex-
pression parameters has been proposed (Glaus et al., 2012) that
is attractive because it accounts for the shape of the posterior
uncertainties in the parameters. However, it too is limited to a
two-condition study design and relies on a computationally in-
tensive read-level algorithm to generate the MCMC traces.

2 APPROACH

In this article, we propose a Bayesian mixed model approach to
the analysis of multisample RNA-seq expression data that ac-
counts for the posterior uncertainty in expression estimates,
including the uncertainty due to read mapping ambiguity.
Figure 1 is a motivating illustration showing how a method ac-
counting for the uncertainty in the expression parameters can
have more power to detect differential expression between two
treatment groups than a method that assumes that all expression
parameters are known with equal accuracy. Up-weighting obser-
vations with lower posterior uncertainty helps to recover the
signal from the noise. In real datasets, the variability in posterior
uncertainty can be considerable (Supplementary Fig. S1).

Our method identiﬁes transcripts with scientiﬁcally interesting
patterns of expression by making a statistical comparison of re-
gression models. Consequently, it is ﬂexible and can be applied
to a wide range of experimental designs. The uncertainty in ex-
pression estimates is incorporated via random effects. In general,
this means that the more precise an estimate the more informa-
tion it will contribute to the comparison of models. We present
an MCMC algorithm for posterior inference that uses the
method of Carlin and Chib (1995) for making the model com-
parisons. The method we propose can be used to identify more
intricate variations in patterns of expression than the usual gene-
level differentiation between treatment groups. For example, we
can model estimates of haplotype-speciﬁc expression in ﬁrst-
generation crosses of inbred strains to detect imprinted genes
or transcripts. We can also detect differential isoform usage by
applying our method to the probit transform of the expression
level of an isoform expressed as a proportion of the overall
expression of its gene.

Finally, in cases where the posterior uncertainty in expression
estimates is extreme, it can be reduced by collapsing transcripts
into identiﬁable aggregates. We propose an algorithm to gener-
ate such a collapsing using the output of the MMSEQ (Turro
et al., 2011) method for estimating transcript-speciﬁc expression
levels. Brieﬂy, MMSEQ infers transcript expression levels using

improve the power to detect differential expression. The left panel illus-
trates a hypothetical analysis that ignores heterogeneity in posterior un-
certainty, so that the total error (measurement plus experimental) has the
same variance (bars) across the observations (crosses). The right panel

effects, thereby exposing a difference between the two treatment groups

an MCMC algorithm for a Bayesian model of read counts. The
model accounts for Poisson noise and various sources of tech-
nical bias. In addition, it accounts for any uncertainty about
which transcript generated which read by integrating over all
possibilities. We demonstrate that aggregation of transcripts
based on the MMSEQ output does not preclude biologically
meaningful inference, as it tends to apply to sets of transcripts
that share considerable stretches of sequence and important bio-
logical attributes (such as skipped or retained exons). This
approach helps counteract some of the estimation difﬁculties
posed by the existence of highly complex gene structures.

3 METHODS

3.1 Linear mixed model

Consider a single feature (i.e. gene, isoform or haplotype—speciﬁc isoform)
with expression 11.,- in sample 1'. If u,- is known with complete precision for
each i, regressions of the following type may be used to model the bio-
logical variation across samples:

log u.- = P522104” + elm) (1)

Here, Pgm) is the ith row of design matrix PO"), which deﬁnes the statistical
model m, 170”) is a corresponding vector of regression coefﬁcients and 65'")
is a Gaussian error with mean zero. Biological inferences may be drawn
through a statistical comparison of competing models, where the true
model is denoted by y e {0, 1}. Although we consider only two choices
for y in any given model comparison, an arbitrary number of models can
be considered through multiple pairwise comparisons. The choice of PO")
should depend on the structure of the experiment and the scientiﬁc hy-
pothesis. For example, in a differential expression experiment comparing
two treatment groups of size three, the following Poms would be
appropriate:

P<°>=(1 1 1 1 1 1)T (2)

T
1 1 1 1 1 1
(1) _
P _(1 1 1 —1 —1 —1) (3)
In practice, the log [M are not known precisely but are estimated with

varying degrees of statistical uncertainty. The MMSEQ method (Turro
et al., 2011) summarizes this statistical uncertainty in the Monte Carlo

samples of log 11., generated by an MCMC algorithm. The posterior dis-
tribution of each log 11., can be approximated using a Gaussian distribu-
tion with mean and variance equal to the empirical mean )2,- and variance
v? of the corresponding Monte Carlo sample. The posterior mean )2,- can
be treated as an estimator of log 11,-. Because the MMSEQ prior on log 11.,
is vague, y,- and l / v12 should closely approximate the maximum likelihood
estimator and Fisher information of log 11,, respectively. Consequently,
approximately:

inMi ~ N(10g111, U?) (4)

Substitution of (4) in (1) leads to the following mixed model with a
random effect, which accounts for the uncertainty in the log 11,-:

y 2 P(m),7(m) + Von) + 61m)
vgm) ~ N(0, U12).

We have yet to specify the variance structure of the 60"). One option is
to assume homoscedasticity across all samples, but grouped data are
common in gene expression experiments and thus it may be more appro-
priate to specify a different variance parameter for each grouping. For
convenience, we adopt the latter parameterization in this article:

65m) w N(0, 03$) (1'))

where iHc(m)(i) maps observation 1' to grouping category C(m)(i) under
model 111. Note that the  are ﬁxed quantities, and therefore the 030") are
identiﬁable.

Having speciﬁed a probability model for the data, we now consider
inference. The parameters of primary scientiﬁc interest are the model
indicator 7/ and the regression coefﬁcients of the true model 170’). We
prefer the Bayesian over the frequentist approach on foundational
grounds, but there are also practical advantages. It is difﬁcult to apply
standard frequentist procedures, such as the likelihood ratio test, to this
problem because there is a non-zero (frequentist) probability that the
maximum likelihood estimate of each of the 03011) will lie on the bound-
ary of the parameter space (i.e. at 0). The boundary event occurs when
the estimates of the posterior variance, given by the v12, are sufﬁciently
large to explain the empirical variability of the 7/. When there is a non-
zero probability of a maximum likelihood estimate lying on a boundary,
standard asymptotic results for the distribution of frequentist test statis-
tics (e. g. Wilks’s theorem) may fail to apply (Ferguson, 1996). Even when
frequentist theory does hold (e.g. if all y? = 0), standard frequentist
approaches may nonetheless suffer from overﬁtting when sample sizes
are low (in the order of ten to a hundred), as is common in gene expres-
sion experiments, leading to unreliable inference (Gelman, 2004, p. 371).
The Bayesian approach allows us to specify priors for hyperparameters,
which restrict overﬁtting. Speciﬁcally, our prior for 17 penalizes large co-
efﬁcients, reﬂecting a prior belief that big log fold changes are rare.
However, because prior belief about the location of the data is vague,
we prefer to separate the intercept term or from 17 and avoid including a
constant column in P [cf. (2) and (3)]:

y = 0,011) + P01077011) + v0“) + 6011)

It is not always possible to design an experiment controlling for all ex-
traneous variables, such as gender, thought to affect gene expression
levels. However, such variables can be accounted for statistically by
including covariates in the regression model. We generalize the probabil-
ity model for the data previously given, by specifying a model-independ-
ent covariate matrix M with corresponding vector of regression
coefﬁcients ,8:

y 2 “(m1 + M 731m) + P(m),7(m) + Von) + 61m)

We now describe the choice of priors for the parameters. We specify
independent Gaussian priors for the 010") and 730") and Student’s t priors
for the 170"). For the error term variance parameters, we specify

030") ~ Inverse — Gamma(shape = k/ 2, scale 2 kp(m) / 2). We shrink
the 030") towards a common mean by specifying a common Gamma
prior on pm), reﬂecting our prior belief that the error term variance
will be similar across categories (see Supplementary Material for details).
Finally, we place a Bernoulli prior on 7/ with ﬁxed hyperparameter p,
reﬂecting our degree of prior belief that model 1 rather than model 0
is true.

We have implemented an MCMC algorithm to generate samples from
the joint posterior distribution of these models. For model comparison,
we use the pseudo-prior method of Carlin and Chib (1995), which can be
used to generate a Bayes factor and therefore an estimate of the posterior
probability for 7/ = 1. Details of the MCMC algorithm can be found in
the Supplementary Material.

3.2 Assessment of random effects model

To assess our method, we simulated expression values and standard
deviations for 80 000 features across 10 samples. For the ﬁrst 20000 fea-
tures, there is no P (homogeneous expression model) and for the remain-
ing features P has a single column such that PEID) = % if i e {1, .. . , 5} and
PEID) = —% if i e {6, ..., 10} (two-condition differential expression
model). For the ﬁrst 20000 features, or = 0, ,8 = 17 = 0 and cc 2 0.3.

To mimic the heteroscedasticity of the posterior variances and their
correlation with the expression values, we sampled the v,- from posterior
standard deviations obtained using a real dataset (Brooks 61 al., 2011).
Speciﬁcally, we sampled the standard deviation from values in the real
dataset where the estimate of log 11. was within 0.5 log fold change of the
simulated expression value. In this way, our simulation accounts for the
fact that more highly expressed features tend to be estimated more
precisely (on the log scale) (Supplementary Fig. S1).

The data for the remaining 60 000 features are generated in the same
way except using the two-condition model with log fold changes of 1, 2
and 4 and or values of 0.5, l and 2, respectively, for successive sets of
20000 features (thus keeping the baseline expression ﬁxed at around
zero). For the inference, we specify a model without a Pm) and with a
P“) = Pm), and we use a prior probability that 7/ = l of 0.1. For the ﬁrst
20000 features, therefore, as we do not simulate any differential expres-
sion, model 0 is the true model whilst for the remaining features, as we
simulate a non-zero log fold change, model 1 is the true model.

Each box plot in the left panel of Figure 2 summarizes the distribution
(of the MCMC point estimates) of the posterior probabilities for 7/ = 1 in
the group of features corresponding to a particular simulated log fold
change. Evidently, increases in the simulated fold-change lead to model 1
being selected preferentially over model 0.

The main motivation for developing the random effects method was to
account for posterior uncertainty about the values of expression param-
eters (including uncertainty due to multi-mapping of reads to transcripts)
in the statistical model linking expression levels to treatment groups. To
assess the impact of accounting for heterogeneous errors on the accuracy
of inference, we reanalyzed the simulated data using the method already
described but setting the v, = 0. This inference model does not account
for heteroscedasticity in uncertainties about expression parameters.

We found that when the log fold change is 0 and therefore the true
model is model 0, the posterior probability that 7/ = 1 tends to be lower in
the analysis with the non-zero vi, which corresponds to a lower type I
error rate. Furthermore, when the log fold change is positive, the poster-
ior probability that 7/ = 1 tends to be larger when the v,- are non-zero,
which corresponds to greater power to detect differential expression. The
advantage in sensitivity and speciﬁcity held by the method taking account
of the posterior uncertainty in expression estimates is clearly visible in the
receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves comparing the two
approaches (Fig. 2, right panel).

As ROC curves evaluate a classiﬁer assuming that the population
proportion of each of the two values of the binary variable are equal,
we also show positive predictive value (PPW and negative predictive

Fig. 2. Assessment of model selection algorithm. The box plots (left
panel) summarize distributions (over simulated features) of MCMC esti-
mates of the posterior probability in favour of a two treatment group
differential expression model (7/ = 1), when comparing that model to a
null model assuming no differential expression (7/ = 0). Each plot corres-
ponds to analyses of simulated data with a different log fold change in
expression between treatment groups. Therefore, the leftmost plot corres-
ponds to features for which 7/ = 0, whereas the other plots correspond to
features for which 7/ = 1. The ROC curves (right panel) illustrate the
superiority of a classiﬁer that accounts for differential uncertainty in
the log 11.,- over one that does not. Both classiﬁers threshold on the
MCMC estimate of the posterior probability that 7/ = 1. The posterior
probability estimates for the green/dashed curve were generated by the
model accounting for uncertainty in log 11., through random effects,
whereas those for the black/solid curve were generated by the same
model without random effects (I)? = 0)

value (NPV) plots for varying proportions of differentially expressed
(DE) versus non-differentially expressed features (Supplementary Fig.
S2). The inclusion of the posterior uncertainty in read counts improves
both PPV and NPV. The PPV improvement is most noticeable when the
proportion of DE features is small while the NPV improvement is most
noticeable when the proportion of DE features is large. When we simulate
20000 non-DE and 6000 DE features (2000 features per fold-change
class), we observe a drastic improvement: for a posterior probability
threshold of 0.45, incorporating read count uncertainty results in
almost perfect PPV, whereas assuming no uncertainty results in a PPV
of around 0.5.

3.3 Collapsing sets of transcripts

We have shown how it is possible to account for posterior uncertainty in
log 11., using random effects. When the variance of the random effects is
large, there will be low power to distinguish between the models using the
analysis described earlier in the text. Unfortunately, in all RNA-seq ex-
periments there is a large class of transcripts for which the posterior
variance is large—speciﬁcally, transcripts that are not mapped to
uniquely by any read (e.g. black points in Supplementary Fig. S1).

Often, sets of transcripts with poorly estimated expression parameters
are anti-correlated because reads can be mapped to the combined set of
transcripts with conﬁdence, but no reads can be mapped to speciﬁc tran-
scripts within the set. In these circumstances, it may be more informative
to treat the set of transcripts as the unit of inference, rather than the
individual transcripts.

We now propose an algorithm for collapsing transcripts with anti-
correlated expression parameters into informative sets. Given a set S in
a partition of the transcripts, we deﬁne an aggregate expression param-
eter (pig 2 2,65 Mn, Where 11,-, is the expression parameter for transcript t
in sample 1'. At each iteration of the algorithm, we coarsen the current
partition of the transcripts by combining the two sets S and S’ for which
the mean posterior correlation between (pig and (pig, is the least, where the
mean is taken over i (i.e. we combine the pair of sets that have on average

the most anti-correlated expression parameters). The algorithm termin-
ates when the minimum (over transcripts) mean (over samples) posterior
correlation exceeds a stopping threshold. We use the right tail of the
empirical distribution of maximum mean correlations as a control and
set the stopping threshold to minus the 97.5th percentile by default. We
have found that this threshold leads to reasonably symmetric distribu-
tions between the minimum and maximum mean correlations while being
robust to small numbers of spurious highly correlated transcripts
(Supplementary Fig. S4). To initialize the algorithm, we need to choose
the set of transcripts to collapse and a partition on that set. We now
discuss concrete choices.

Empirically, the log expression parameters of transcripts with u
uniquely mapping reads almost always have higher posterior standard
deviations than the log expression parameters of transcripts with u+1
uniquely mapping reads (see the stratiﬁed pattern in Supplementary
Fig. S1). In practice, the expression of transcripts for which 11 Z 1 can
usually be estimated with a reasonable degree of accuracy. In order not to
collapse transcripts for which we have reasonably precise estimates in at
least some of the samples, we apply our collapsing algorithm only to
transcripts in the 11:0 stratum and for which the posterior standard
deviation is greater than the maximum posterior standard deviation
among transcripts with u 2 1. We call transcripts in this set ‘low-infor-
mation transcripts’. We initially collapse transcripts with identical se-
quences as, by necessity, their expression parameters are unidentiﬁable.
We then collapse the remaining low-information transcripts. However,
low-information transcripts that are not observed (i.e. have zero align-
ments across all samples) are excluded from collapsing.

3.4 Assessment of collapsing algorithm

We use the well-known Pasilla dataset (Brooks 61 al., 2011), which in-
cludes RNA-seq reads from seven Drosophila melanogaster cell cultures in
two conditions [4 control and 3 ps(RNAi) samples], to assess our collap-
sing algorithm. The top-right panel of Figure 3 shows a trace of the
minimum mean correlation as the algorithm progresses. There is a grad-
ual increase in the minimum mean correlation interrupted by sudden
downward ﬂuctuations. Supposing transcript sets S and S’ are such
that mean,cor(¢,-S, (1)751) is lowest at iteration q, a sudden downward ﬂuc-
tuation in the minimum mean correlation occurs at iteration q + 1 if there
exists a set S” such that mean,cor(¢,-S + (1)751, (1)7511) << mean,cor(¢,-S, (1)751).
For example, the expression parameters for transcripts RC and RB of the
ﬁve-transcript gene CG42671 have a mean correlation of —0.61.
However, the expression of the collapsed pair has a much lower correl-
ation of —0.95 with that of a third transcript, RE. The collapsed triplet
shares an extremely similar structure, including a 3’ exon that is unique to
the three transcripts (Fig. 4). As another example, consider
Supplementary Figure S3, which shows how nine transcripts from the
up gene sharing the same two exons near the 5’ end cluster together
while a 10th transcript with a different 5’ exon, up-RD, is estimated
separately.

Overall, the algorithm collapsed 1368 low-information transcripts
from the Drosophila dataset into 570 higher-precision sets. Of these 570
transcript sets, 546 solely contained isoforms belonging to the same gene,
even though the algorithm uses only posterior correlations and is thus
blind to each isoform’s gene membership, sequence and coordinates. Only
22 and two sets contained isoforms from two and three different genes,
respectively. The sets of three consisted of paralogues of the U2 snRNAs
(14B, 38ABa and 38ABb) and the TEKTIN protein family (CG32819,
CG32820, CG17450). The sets of two consisted mostly of duplicated
neighbouring genes (e.g. CG31809 and CG31810) or highly overlapping
genes (e.g. SP555 and CG14042). These examples illustrate how our
algorithm can improve precision by collapsing groups of resemblant tran-
scripts without a signiﬁcant loss in biological resolution.

We next examined the consistency of our algorithm through cross-
validation, comparing collapsed sets obtained using different bipartitions

(g)/2) possible bipartitions of equal size. A collapsed set S in group

1 is said to be consistent with the collapsed sets in group 2 if either of the
following conditions is met:

0 S is a subset of a set in group 2,

c all sets in group 2 containing an element in S are subsets of S.

Thus, {A,B, C} in group 1 would be consistent with {{A}, {B, C}} or
{A,B, C, D} in group 2 but not with {A,D}. Also, note that
{{A,B}, {C, D}} is not consistent with {{A, C}, {B,D}}. For each biparti-
tion, the consistency of each set in group 1 was assessed with respect to all
sets in group 1 and vice versa. Despite the dataset containing mixed single
and paired-end libraries and two different conditions, our consistency
rate averaged 96.7%. The lowest consistency, of 95.84%, was obtained
in the bipartition separating the treatment and the control group exactly.
Thus, even in the presence of structured biological variability, our
algorithm merges transcripts in a highly consistent manner.

4 APPLICATIONS

4.1 Finding imprinted genes in mice

Mammalian cells can express the (usually) two copies of auto-
somal genes differentially, leading to allele-speciﬁc imbalance in

their RNA products. When the direction of the imbalance be-
tween the two copies depends on the sex of the parent from
whom each copy was inherited, imprinting is said to occur. It
is thought that imprinting is mostly determined by differential
methylation during gametogenesis (Li and Sasaki, 2011). We
analyzed previously published RNA-seq data obtained from
the livers of six initial and six reciprocal crosses of inbred mice
(Goncalves et al., 2012) to assess whether our model selection
algorithm can be used to detect imprinting. The initial crosses
inherited the C57BL/6J (BL6) strain genome from the father and
the CAST/EiJ (CAST) strain genome from the mother. The
reciprocal crosses inherited the CAST genome from the father
and the BL6 genome from the mother. We obtained haplotype-
and gene-speciﬁc estimates for each strain within each cross
using MMSEQ. Thus we obtained two sets of posterior means
and standard deviations for each initial and reciprocal mouse.

We applied our model selection algorithm comparing a null
versus an imprinting model. Under the null model, it is assumed
that any difference between the two strains in the initials is the
same in the reciprocals. Under the imprinting model, it is
assumed that the difference between the two strains has the
same magnitude in the initials as the reciprocals, but has opposite
sign. The collapsed design matrices (i.e. with repeat rows
removed) are as follows:

1 1 1 1 ...F1iBL6

P(nu11) 1 1 —1 Pomp) I 1 —1 ...Fli CAST
2 —1 1 2 —1 —1 ...F1rBL6
—1—1 —1 1 ..FerAST

Each row of the two matrices corresponds to a cross-classiﬁca-
tion of the mice by haplotype (BL6/CAST) and cross type (Fl
initial/F1 reciprocal, abbreviated Fli/Flr). There are six obser-
vations of each kind so the uncollapsed matrices used in the
analysis have 24 rows, a six-fold replication of those above.

The regression coefﬁcient 17(1nuﬂ) (which corresponds to the ﬁrst

column of the design matrix P(nu”)) represents the log fold change
between the initial and the reciprocal crosses while the coefﬁcient

779m“) represents the log fold change between the two haplotypes.

The coefﬁcient 17(11mp) has the same interpretation as 17(1nu11), but the
173mp ) represents the log fold change between the maternally and
the paternally inherited haplotype.

We restricted our analysis to polymorphic genes, as there is no
power to detect imprinting unless there is a difference in sequence
between the BL6 and CAST haplotypes. We used a prior prob-
ability of imprinting of 10% to calculate the posterior probabil-
ities. For each gene, we checked whether it was listed in the
following four online imprinting databases: WAMIDEX
(Schulz et al., 2008), geneimprint.com, mousebook.org and the
Catalogue of Imprinted Genes and Parent-of—Origin Effects in
Humans and Animals (Morison et al., 2001).

The 10 genes with the highest posterior probability of being
imprinted are well known to be imprinted in mouse, as they are
listed in all four of the aforementioned databases. These genes
are H13, Igf2r, Meg3, Slc22a3, Rian, Snrpn, Sgce, Impact, errl
and Peg3, all of which have a posterior probability of imprinting
> 99%. If we relax the threshold on the posterior probability to
90%, we ﬁnd an additional ﬁve genes, three of which have sup-
porting evidence in the literature or in the databases of being
imprinted in mouse: Masl, Mirg and Mcts2 (Fig. 5, left panel).
Our results are in general agreement with the ﬁndings of
Goncalves et al. (2012) (Fig. 5, right panel), with a few additional
identiﬁcations of known genes such as Rian [posterior probabil-
ity (pp): 1.00] Peg3 (pp = 1.00), Mirg (pp =0.99), H19
(pp = 0.70), Rtll (pp = 0.58), Mkrn3 (pp = 0.54), PeglO
(pp = 0.43) and Igf2 (pp = 0.31).

4.2 Classifying mouse genes by type of
regulatory divergence

Thus far, we have focused on pairwise comparisons between
pairs of models, i.e. 7/ 6 {0,1}. However, it is straightforward
to perform polytomous classiﬁcation through pairwise compari-
sons of Bayes factors between each model and an arbitrary base-
line model (e. g. model 0):

Bayes factor(0, m) x P(7/ = m)
E Bayes factor(0, m’) x P(7/ = m’)

 

P(1/ = mly) = (5)

This type of polytomous analysis lends itself to problems where
there are several plausible models for the expression summaries,
which correspond to different biological mechanisms. Returning
to the mouse liver dataset, it is possible to discern different types
of regulatory divergence for each gene by comparing expression
summaries obtained in the pure-strain mice (FOS) with those ob-
tained in ﬁrst-generation crosses of the two strains (Fls). Brieﬂy,
genes for which there is no difference between the strains in the
F03 and no difference between the haplotypes in the F13 are
considered to have conserved regulation. Genes for which the
difference between the strains is the same in the F03 as in the
F13 are considered to have diverged through cis-acting regula-
tory mutations. If a difference in the F03 is completely lost in the
F13, then the gene is said to have diverged through trans-acting
mutations. Finally, if there are different fold changes in the F03
compared with the F13, then the gene is said to have diverged

through a combination of cis and trans-acting mutations
(Goncalves et al., 2012).

Here, we assess whether our general model selection frame-
work can be used to discern the four patterns of gene expression
divergence. We deﬁne the following four collapsed design matri-
ces for the different models of regulatory divergence where, for
each row of each design matrix, we show the corresponding class
of observation on the right:

P(Conserved) : 1 l . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . F0 (both strains)

—1 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..Fl (both strains)

—1 0 1 . . . . . . . . . F1 BL6

—1 0 —1 . . . . . . . ..Fl CAST

The 5804 genes that are not polymorphic between the two
strains were excluded from analysis, as there is no power to
detect differences in the hybrid strains using sequencing.
Imprinting is a confounding factor in this study design because
it results in strain-speciﬁc imbalance in the F13 that is not driven
by regulatory divergence. Therefore, we excluded from analysis
all 542 genes with a moderate posterior probability (>0.25) of
being imprinted. We attempted to classify the remaining 28 630
genes into one of the four categories. We ran our model selection
algorithm comparing the conserved model with each of the three
other models. Then, assuming a ﬂat prior probability of 0.25 that
any of the four models is true, we calculated the joint posterior
probability of the models using Equation (5).

For many of the genes, the data did not favour any model
strongly and the joint posterior probabilities resembled the prior
model probabilities. In total, 11 135 genes had a posterior prob-
ability greater than 0.5 of belonging to one of the categories. We
classiﬁed these genes into the conserved, cis, trans and cis+trcms
categories. Figure 6 contrasts the log fold change between the
strains within the F03 and the log fold change between the strains
within the F13 in each of the classes. Our algorithm produces a
clear clustering of genes into four different patterns. The con-
served genes cluster around (0,0) (allowing for some error
along y=0 due to lower sequencing depth per mouse and
strain in the Fls), cis genes cluster around yzx, trans genes
cluster around x=0 and cis+trcms genes are scattered away
from the rest. Notice how the cis+trcms panel shows distinctive
gaps at y=x and x=0, where the cis and trans genes cluster,
respectively. The plots show that our model comparison algo-
rithm is able to distinguish multiple patterns of gene expression
effectively, while accounting for the major sources of statistical
uncertainty.

4.3 Detecting differential isoform usage

Differential regulation of splicing is an important biological phe-
nomenon that can be associated with disease (Garcia-Blanco
et al., 2004). Methods exist (e. g. Anders et al., 2012) for detecting
differential usage of exons, which serves as an indicator that dif-
ferential isoform usage is taking place but does not necessarily
pinpoint speciﬁcally which isoform is being differentially regu-
lated. It may sometimes be more interesting to quantify changes
in the proportions of alternative isoforms of a gene directly rather
than through changes at the exon level, as isoforms are the ul-
timate determinants of protein products. Furthermore, in studies
of inbred crosses, as in the aforementioned example, standard
exon-level analyses cannot be applied because the detection of
differential exon or isoform usage must be haplotype-speciﬁc.
In contrast, our method can straightforwardly accommodate ana-
lyses for arbitrary units of inference (see Section 5).

Here we investigate whether our model selection algorithm can
be used to detect differential isoform usage. Given the high level
of ambiguity in the assignment of reads to isoforms when the
genomic coordinates of isoforms from the same gene overlap,
accounting for uncertainty in the observations is potentially
more important in this scenario than in gene-level or haplo-
type-speciﬁc gene-level analyses.

We return to the Pasilla dataset, for which 16 RT-PCR—vali—
dated cases of differential splicing between the control samples
and the ps(RNAi) samples are available from the authors. We
ﬁrst adapted the MMSEQ estimation program to output the
posterior distributions of the probit-transformed isoform pro-
portions for each isoform in each gene. At each iteration of the
MMSEQ MCMC, the expression level of each isoform is
expressed as a proportion of the total expression of its gene,
which is probit-transformed and recorded. The empirical
means and standard deviations of these traces are then down-
sampled and used as input to our model selection program (see
Fig. 7, left panel for an example).

As in the imprinting example mentioned earlier in the text, we
found a clear pattern for the distribution of posterior probabilities
consisting of a large population near or below the prior and a
small population of posterior probabilities, which rise well above
the prior. The maximum posterior probability of isoform usage
per gene was below the isoform-wise prior (0.1) for 84.6% of
genes (Fig. 7, right panel), showing that in the vast majority of
cases there is no evidence of differential isoform usage. Only 225
genes showed moderate evidence of differential isoform usage
(maximum posterior probability >0.2). This is somewhat fewer
than the number of genes (323) found by Brooks et al. (2011)

Fig. 7. The left panel shows boxplots of the MMSEQ estimates of the posterior distributions of isoform usage for the two isoforms of the dre4 gene in
four control samples and three ps(RNAi) samples. As dre4 has only two isoforms, there is symmetry between the two sets of boxplots. The posterior
probability of differential usage for dre4 was calculated to be 0.69 based on a prior probability of 0.1. The right panel shows the maximum posterior
probabilities across all isoforms of each gene for all genes. Genes are coloured in red if they were selected and identiﬁed as differentially spliced by Brooks
et al. (2011). The prior probability that the differential isoform usage model is true was set to 0.1 (horizontal line)

using various heuristics and Fisher’s exact tests of genome align-
ment counts. We cannot assess the false discovery rate exactly
because the truth is known only for a small subset of genes that
were validated by RT-PCR (all of which tested positive). We can,
however, determine the posterior probabilities for the set of genes
that were validated. The right panel of Figure 7 shows that the
genes cluster on the vertical high-probability section of the plot.
Genes bmm, CG4829, trol, msn, sesB, osa, RhoGAP19D, slik
and Pthamma all had maximum posterior probabilities greater
than 0.9.

Having observed a marked enrichment of validated genes
within the small group for which we found compelling evidence
of differential isoform usage, we conclude that our method has
reasonable power and speciﬁcity for detecting differential regu-
lation of isoform usage by modelling posterior summaries of
probit-transformed isoform usage proportions. By way of com-
parison, a standard Cuffdiff 2 splicing analysis of the same data-
set declared only three of the validated genes as ‘signiﬁcant’: trol,
CG4829 and bmm. The minimum (over transcription start sites)
unadjusted P—values ranged from 0.00005 to 0.53085 for the
validated genes while LamBl and CG8920 were given a
‘NOTEST’ result by Cuffdiff 2. Supplementary Figure S5
shows that our approach is much more sensitive at recovering
the validated genes than Cuffdiff 2.

5 DISCUSSION

The work we have presented can be applied to a wide range of
problems in the study of gene expression thanks to two import-
ant features. First, due to the linear mixed regression framework,
we are able to model many different patterns of expression. We
have shown, for example, how the framework can be used to
detect imprinting in mice. Second, by using posterior summaries
of expression as the outcomes in our regression models rather
than alignment counts, we are able to apply our methods in cases
where counts are not readily available, such as haplotype-speciﬁc
and isoform-speciﬁc analyses. We have described earlier in the
text how transformation of expression proportion variables to

the probit scale allows us to detect differential isoform usage.
Crucially, having demonstrated that posterior uncertainty in
expression estimates may be large and heteroscedastic, we have
shown that accounting for this uncertainty can improve precision
and sensitivity.

Ordinarily, a different method would be applied to compari-
sons of expression intensities at different levels of granularity.
For example, standard gene expression analyses might be
based on comparisons of genome-alignment counts, allele-
speciﬁc expression analyses might compare counts on a hetero-
zygote—by-heterozygote basis and splicing analyses might
compare counts on a splice junction by splice junction basis. It
is difﬁcult to integrate the results of such varied kinds of analyses
to make inference. Returning to the mouse dataset mentioned
earlier in the text, we have shown how our method can be used to
perform a differential expression analysis between the two strains
in the (pure-strain) parents together with a differential expression
analysis between the two strains in the ﬁrst-generation crosses
(i.e. between haplotypes). Our model can straightforwardly ac-
commodate both types of analysis, producing comparable pos-
terior probabilities. More generally, our model selection method
can be applied universally to any arbitrary collection of features
through aggregation of joint posterior distributions. Analyses
could be performed at the gene, haplo-gene, isoform, haplo-iso-
form, exon and 5’-untranslated region (UTR) level, to name a
few, applying a single method of inference across comparison
types to an RNA-seq dataset. In the latter example, it would
be possible to detect changes in 5’ UTR usage between treatment
groups simply by collapsing isoforms sharing the same 5’ UTR
start sites. Finally, we have shown how polytomous classiﬁcation
can be performed effectively when more than two models are
postulated for the data, which is often the case in studies of
gene expression.

ABSTRACT

Purpose: The PathVisio-Faceted Search plugin helps users explore
and understand complex pathways by overlaying experimental data
and data from webservices, such as Ensembl BioMart, onto diagrams
drawn using formalized notations in PathVisio. The plugin then pro-
vides a filtering mechanism, known as a faceted search, to find and
highlight diagram nodes (e.g. genes and proteins) of interest based on
imported data. The tool additionally provides a flexible scripting mech-
anism to handle complex queries.

Availability: The PathVisio-Faceted Search plugin is compatible
with PathVisio 3.0 and above. PathVisio is compatible with
Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. The plugin, documentation, example
diagrams and Groovy scripts are available at http://PathVisio.org/wiki/
PathVisioFacetedSearchHelp. The plugin is free, open-source and
licensed by the Apache 2.0 License.

1 INTRODUCTION

Pathway diagrams are important tools that facilitate understand-
ing biological systems by aggregating many disparate observa-
tions into concise representations. There is a growing trend to use
formal graphical notations, such as the Molecular Interaction
Map (MIM) notation and the Systems Biology Graphical
Notation (SBGN), and formats, such as BioPAX, to relate
greater mechanistic detail about pathway interactions than is
typical in protein—protein interaction networks (Demir et al.,
2010; Le Novere et al., 2009; Luna et al., 2011). The well-
known tool Cytoscape possesses powerful annotation and
search capabilities, but it is focused on network analysis, not
diagram rendering (Smoot et al., 2011). This tool lacks the cap-
abilities necessary to render diagrams that are fully compliant
with MIM or SBGN. The CySBGN plugin is the best current
attempt, but has some rendering problems, such as z—ordering
issues (Goncalves et al., 2013).

PathVisio (http://pathvisio.org/) is a free open-source tool
built to display and edit diagrams using formalized notations
(van Iersel et al., 2008). PathVisio is capable of Visualizing micro-
array and metabolomics data, similar to GenMAPP, but lacks
other search features including the Visualization and search of

nominal data, which limits analysis, especially on the growing
number of pathways in the related WikiPathways database
(Dahlquist et al., 2002; Pico et al., 2008).

Here, we present a robust search plugin for PathVisio using
the faceted search method that is found on many e-commerce
websites for product search using discrete attributes, known as
facets. Facet entries can be selected to filter down to content of
interest, and faceted searching is found in bioinformatics tools,
including the Protein Data Bank (http://www.rcsb.org/). Facets
allow users to attach data to pathways using biological identi-
ﬁers. Any piece of data that can be looked up in a database based
on identifiers, such as ‘HGNC: TP53’, can be used as a facet. For
example, a user might wish to know which pathway proteins are
involved in cell division, are targets of cancer drugs and are over-
expressed in an experiment. This plugin allows users to easily ask
complex queries of biological pathways and identify biological
entities of interest through the powerful search capability on user
data, webservice data and data processed using its scripting
capability.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

The plugin interface and dataservice options are described below:

Plugin interface: The plugin’s interface is found in the ‘Facets’
pane of the PathVisio sidebar. Figure 1 shows a search example
for pathway components that are transcribed in lymphomas and
encoded by genes on chromosomes 9 and 17. The main area of
the sidebar is where facets appear. At the bottom, are buttons for
managing dataservices and adding facets. There are two types of
facets: string and numeric. String facets are for nominal data (e. g.
cellular location). Entries for all the nodes are displayed initially.
For example, clicking on ‘nucleus’ in a cellular location facet will
highlight only nodes annotated as existing in the nucleus and
removes entries from other facets for nodes not in the nucleus.
Numeric facets allow users to find values in a range. This facet
type returns a Boolean response or error for missing values. All
facets entries have appended counts with the number of nodes
satisfying a particular condition. When using multiple facets, a
selection in one facet restricts entries across all the facets, as
fewer nodes are able to satisfy each additional condition.
Active facet data and highlighted nodes can be exported for
use in future sessions or in other software.

Compatible pathways: This plugin can operate on any pathway
loaded into PathVisio, but it only functions on nodes with

database identiﬁers. This is a key requirement for connecting
imported data to the nodes on the diagram. Many database pro-
viders use unique identiﬁer schemas for the same biological enti-
ties, thus requiring ID mapping; this plugin uses BridgeDb as its
mapping service (van Iersel et al., 2010). BridgeDb works either
through a local database loaded in PathVisio or the BridgeREST
API.

Dataservices: The plugin can use (i) local ﬁles formatted as tab-
separated values (TSV) or comma-separated values (CSV) ﬁles,
(ii) Ensembl BioMart webservice and (iii) Groovy scripts.

Local ﬁles: TSV/CSV ﬁles can be added as dataservices. Each ﬁle
row maps to a node and each column to a facet. The first ﬁle row
should be headers describing the column contents (e.g. HGNC
Symbol, Molecular Weight, etc.) and are used as the facet titles.
At least one column must contain identiﬁers; the identiﬁer
column and type is speciﬁed in the ‘Manage Dataservices’
dialogue.

BioMart webservice: The BioMart (http://www.biomart.org/)
webservice provides the ability to query multiple biological data-
bases through a single interface (Guberman et al., 2011). This
dataservice is built-in to the plugin, and can be enabled or dis-
abled. A subset of ~70 Ensembl attributes is available through
this dataservice; other attributes are available through the plu-
gin’s scripting functionality. Turning on the dataservice makes
available all these attributes in the ‘Add Facet’ dialogue. Adding
a facet from BioMart may take some time as data must be down-
loaded. Currently, data are not cached between PathVisio ses-
sions, and performance information is provided on the project
website.

Groovy scripting: This dataservice provides additional ﬂexibility
by incorporating Groovy (http://groovy.codehaus.org), a script-
ing language compatible with Java. Groovy may be used to per-
form additional logic, incorporate and pre-process other data
formats and access other webservices. These are added by click-
ing ‘Add Groovy’ in the ‘Manage Dataservices’ dialogue. There
are two ﬁelds in the ‘Add Groovy’ dialogue: one for the facet

name and the other for Groovy code. Identiﬁers may be con-
verted to a speciﬁc format (e.g. for custom webservices) before
being passed to the Groovy script; this is speciﬁed in the
‘Manage Dataservices’ dialogue, and the default setting is to
perform no ID conversion. The Groovy script will be run once
for each diagram node with an identiﬁer and expects a return
string or an array of strings to be returned as facet entries. The
online documentation goes into detail on how to use the Groovy
scripting features and provides in-depth examples of its use. The
ﬁrst example illustrates how users may connect histone binding
data to diagram nodes by using Enseml BioMart to produce a
facet. Other included examples demonstrate retrieving informa-
tion from ChEMBL (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) and from
QuickGO (http: //www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/).

3 CONCLUSION

The PathVisio-Faceted Search plugin was designed to help users
understand complex pathways by making it easier to cross-
reference diagrams with data from multiple sources, both local
experimental data and Via webservices. Faceted search is a widely
used search method that overcomes the limitations of more con-
ventional methods to easily ﬁnd relevant items. In the future, we
plan to introduce a Visual programming interface to simplify the
Groovy scripting component of the plugin and make the ﬂexi-
bility of this scripting support accessible to more users.

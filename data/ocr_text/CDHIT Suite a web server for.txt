ABSTRACT

Summary: CD-HIT is a widely used program for clustering and
comparing large biological sequence datasets. In order to further
assist the CD-HIT users, we significantly improved this program
with more functions and better accuracy, scalability and flexibility.
Most importantly, we developed a new web server, CD-HIT Suite,
for clustering a user-uploaded sequence dataset or comparing
it to another dataset at different identity levels. Users can now
interactively explore the clusters within web browsers. We also
provide downloadable clusters for several public databases (NCBI
NR, Swissprot and PDB) at different identity levels.

1 INTRODUCTION

The size of the biological sequence databases is rapidly growing
due to large—scale genome projects and the emerging ﬁeld of
metagenomics (Yooseph et al., 2007). New sequencing technologies
are now producing sequence data at a very high rate, and this has
created a greater need for bioinformatics tools to effectively organize
and analyze the data. Fortunately, biological sequences are related
and may share homology, and thus clustering these sequences into
groups and ﬁnding a representative or a consensus for each group
are practical ways to solve the sequence analysis problems.

Our previous works (Li and Godzik, 2006; Li et al., 2001; Li
et al., 2002) introduced CD—HIT based on short word ﬁltering and
a greedy incremental clustering algorithm to cluster and compare
large biological sequence datasets. One advantage of CD—HIT is its
ultrahigh speed and the ability to handle large datasets. Since its
release, CD—HIT has been widely used by many groups in various
ﬁelds, including UniRef (Suzek et al., 2007), SMART (Letunic
et al., 2009) and metagenome data analyses (Turnbaugh et al., 2009;
Yooseph et al., 2008).

In the last few years, we have been continuously improving
this program with more functions and better accuracy, scalability
and ﬂexibility. We also implemented a new web server to allow

users to cluster or compare sequences without installing and
executing the command—line version of CD—HIT locally. The server
provides interactive interface and additional visualization tools. It
also provides precalculated and regularly updated sequence clusters
for several widely used databases, including NCBI NR, Swissprot
and PDB.

2 METHODS AND IMPLEMENTATION

The detailed algorithms and benchmark results for CD—HIT can be found
from our previous works (Li and Godzik, 2006; Li et al., 2001; Li et al.,
2002). Here, we highlight the novel features and functions.

2.1 Improved clustering algorithm

The original CD—HIT uses a fast greedy incremental clustering process.
Brieﬂy, sequences are ﬁrst sorted by decreasing length. The longest one
becomes the representative of the ﬁrst cluster. Then, each remaining sequence
is compared with the existing representatives. If the identity with any
representative is above a given threshold, it is grouped into that cluster
without comparing it to other representatives. Otherwise, it becomes the
representative of a new cluster. In the updated CD—HIT, we added a reﬁned
greedy incremental clustering process that produces more accurate clusters.
In this process, a sequence is grouped into the most similar cluster instead of
the ﬁrst similar cluster. The reﬁned process does not change the representative
sequences.

CD—HIT uses a short word ﬁlter to avoid unnecessary alignments. In
short, the minimum number of identical short words (k—mers) shared by
two sequences depends on their sequence identity and can be calculated
analytically 0r statistically. Without an actual alignment, we can still
determine that the identity of two sequences is below a given threshold
by counting short words. A short word ﬁlter performs much better with a
higher identity threshold. Clustering in the reﬁned process is implemented
with a dynamic short word ﬁlter. For each sequence to be clustered, the initial
ﬁlter matches the user—deﬁned identity threshold. But during the clustering
procedure, if this sequence hits any cluster with better identity, the ﬁlter
is reset to match this better identity to increase the performance of the
ﬁlter. With the dynamic short word ﬁlter, although the reﬁned clustering
process needs to evaluate the similarities of a sequence and all the existing
representatives, it only requires about 1.5—3x CPU time of the original
process.

2.2 Improved clustering control

The original CD—HIT uses global sequence identities. The improved CD—
HIT also works with local identities. Users can ﬁnely control the clustering
behavior by including more criteria besides sequence identity cutoffs. We
include alignment length, unaligned length and alignment coverage for both
aligned sequences as new clustering parameters into the current CD—HIT.

CD-HIT Suite

 

For example, users can make clusters of sequences of similar length by
specifying that the alignments must cover both sequences at similar coverage.

2.3 Clustering at low identity thresholds

The performance of the native short word ﬁlter drops signiﬁcantly with a
lower identity threshold; therefore, the original CD—HIT does not provide
protein clustering under 40% identity. However, clustering at low identities
has been frequently requested by CD—HIT users. We implemented a script,
called PSI—CD—HIT, to perform protein sequence clustering at a low identity
threshold such as 30%. It uses the similar greedy incremental clustering
strategy, but it uses BLAST to calculate the similarities. So users can also
specify an expect—value cutoff. PSI—CD—HIT runs on a stand—alone computer
or a LINUX cluster. It can cluster a PDB—sized dataset in ~20 min.

2.4 Hierarchical clustering

In the hierarchical clustering process, the program ﬁrst performs clustering on
the original input dataset at a high identity threshold, and the representatives
of each previous clustering step will be the input of the following clustering
run at a lower identity threshold. The whole process iteratively joins
the similar sequences into families and therefore produces a hierarchical
structure. For protein sequences, the last step is performed with PSI—CD—
HIT if the ﬁnal identity threshold is <40%. This strategy can maximize the
computational efﬁciency and the quality of clustering. We have applied such
strategy in a protein family analysis of a large metagenomic dataset with 17
million sequences (Li et 01., 2008).

2.5 Annotation enrichment of sequence cluster

We provide an option for joint analysis of sequence clustering and annotation
information. Users can place annotation terms (Gene Ontology, protein
family, etc.) in the deﬁnition lines of input FASTA ﬁles. For each annotation
term A and each cluster C, we use the following numbers:

NAC = number of sequences with A in C;
NC = number of sequences in C;
NA] = number of sequences with A in the input;
N1 = number of the input sequences.

A P—value is calculated using the one—tailed Fisher’s exact test to assess
whether NAC/NC >NA1/N1 and annotation term A is enriched in cluster C.
Such functionality is very useful to check the cluster quality at different
identity levels and also for function assignment of proteins with unknown
function.

2.6 Web server

All basic functions of CD—HIT are provided through tab—based interfaces in
our web server. We provided CD—HIT (CD—HIT—EST) to cluster a protein
(DNA/RNA) dataset. Users can upload a FASTA ﬁle and select a desired
sequence identity level and other parameters. CD—HIT—2D (CD—HIT—EST—2D)
can compare two databases uploaded by users. H—CD—HIT and H—CD—HIT—
EST in our server performs hierarchical clustering up to three steps.

After submitting a clustering or comparison job, a unique identiﬁer will be
assigned. A user can use the identiﬁer to track the status of the job. After the
job is ﬁnished, we provide the raw outputs generated by the command—line
CD—HIT. Additionally, we provide tools to visualize the clustering results
with cluster explorer and cluster distribution plots. Cluster explorer uses
a tree structure to represent the clustering results Figure 1a. Each cluster
is represented by a clickable text object on the web page, and users can
click on a representative sequence to retrieve information of the sequences
belong to the cluster. This option is most useful for investigating the results

from hierarchical clustering. In this situation, each sequence could be a
representative sequence from the previous clustering step, and users can click
it to explore the results from the previous clustering. Cluster distribution plots
are scatter plots where the X —axis is the cluster size (number of sequences in
a cluster), and then the Y —axis represents the number of clusters of at least
this size and the number of corresponding sequences Figure 1b. This tool is
very useful to observe the global structure of a sequence database.

3 CONCLUSION

CD—HIT has been signiﬁcantly improved from our previous work.
CD—HIT Suite provides users with a friendly web interface
to perform biological sequence clustering and comparison with
additional visualization tools. It also provides precalculated clusters
for several public sequence databases which are regularly updated.

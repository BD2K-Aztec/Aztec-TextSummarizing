ABSTRACT

Correlations between sequence evolution and structural dynamics are
of utmost importance in understanding the molecular mechanisms of
function and their evolution. We have integrated Evol, a new package
for fast and efficient comparative analysis of evolutionary patterns and
conformational dynamics, into ProDy, a computational toolbox
designed for inferring protein dynamics from experimental and theor-
etical data. Using information-theoretic approaches, Evol coanalyzes
conservation and coevolution profiles extracted from multiple
sequence alignments of protein families with their inferred dynamics.

1 INTRODUCTION

The signiﬁcance of protein dynamics in a wide range of biolo-
gical functions, including cell signaling, regulation and machin-
ery is widely established (Bahar et al., 2010; Bhabha et al., 2011;
Marsh et al., 2012). In many cases, sequence variability goes
hand in hand with structural dynamics (Glembo et al., 2012;
Liu and Bahar, 2012; Marks et al., 2011; Micheletti, 2012;
Worth et al., 2009; Zheng et al., 2005). Structural dynamics cor-
relates with evolvability (Tokuriki and Tawﬁk, 2009) or sequence
and conformational diversity (Friedland et al., 2009) and enables
adaptation to substrate binding while maintaining speciﬁcity
(Liu et al., 2010). To our knowledge, existing software usually
relate evolutionary properties to static structures (Ashkenazy
et al., 2010; Morgan et al., 2006; Wainreb et al., 2011), or they
are exclusively dedicated to either sequence analysis Materhouse
et al., 2009) or structural dynamics (Eyal et al., 2006; Suhre and
Sanejouand, 2004). There is a need for methods that allow
combined analysis of sequence (co)evolution and structural
dynamics. These would be particularly useful if they could be
performed and visualized in a versatile, integrated computing
environment.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.
TThe authors wish it to be known that, in their opinion, the ﬁrst two
authors should be regarded as Joint First Authors.

Toward addressing this need, we introduce the v1.5 of ProDy
(Bakan et al., 2011) with Evol applications. Highlights of the new
version are rich methods for coevolutionary analysis, and
extensions for analyzing and interpreting structural dynamics,
following the approach adopted in our recent comparative
study of sequence conservation and coevolution patterns versus
structure/dynamics properties for a representative set of protein
families (Liu and Bahar, 2012), which has been validated in
detailed case studies (e.g. General at al., 2014; Liu et al., 2010).
A distinctive feature of ProDy is its capability to extract mech-
anistic information from principal component analysis (PCA) of
ensembles of structures (e.g. drug targets) (Bakan and Bahar,
2009). The new release has several new modules and command
line applications named ‘evol’ to evaluate sequence conservation
and coevolution using information-theoretic and statistical
approaches. To our knowledge, this is the only package that
enables comparative analysis of protein dynamics with sequence
evolution data extracted from multiple sequence alignments
(MSAs) for protein families.

2 DESCRIPTION AND FUNCTIONALITY

2.1 Input for ProDy and Eva]

The input for ProDy is a set of protein coordinates in PDB
format, or simply the PDB ID or protein sequence. The speed
of PDB parser and AtomGroup classes has been increased in the
current version, such that parsing coordinates is 4.5—40 times
faster than using Biopython PDB module (Hamelryck and
Manderick, 2003), and atomic data storage occupies 10 times
less memory footprint. We implemented efﬁcient and ﬂexible
features for handling MSAs. Notably, the new MSA parser
can evaluate various formats at a rate of 700 MB/s (on
3.6GHz Intel Xeon CPU, 16 GB RAM and Samsung SSD)
and is up to 80 times faster than the alignment parser of
Biopython (Cook et al., 2009). Flexible classes store MSA data
parsimoniously in the memory and provide ways of subsampling.
Sequences can be ﬁltered based on their labels to retain those in
certain categories (e.g. human) and sliced to retain speciﬁc re-
gions or sequences (e.g. regions matching structurally resolved
amino acids). Such reﬁnements, performed in a fraction of a
second, allow for real-time processing of large MSAs and sys-
tematic analyses of protein families.

2.2 Coevolution analysis

Evol offers a rich set of features for evaluating and plotting
evolutionary properties of amino acids. Methods based on
mutual information (Dunn et al., 2008), statistical coupling analysis
(SCA) recent extension (Halabi et al., 2009), observed-minus—ex—
pected-squared covariance (Kass and Horovitz, 2002) and direct
information (DI) (Marks et al., 2011; Weigt et al., 2009) have
been implemented for coevolution analysis. Our implementations
of these methods follow the descriptions in their respective papers.
We rigorously tested our methods, cross-checking our results with
the code that came with the cited papers. Evol can operate in turbo
mode when there is sufﬁcient memory (twice the size of MSA ﬁle);
otherwise it falls back to a memory efﬁcient mode. Benchmarking
the performance of different implementations also show that, Evol
algorithms written in C/Python run 1.5 (DI) to 7 (SCA) times faster
than the original implementations in Matlab. Furthermore, Evol
takes account of ambiguous (e.g. Asx) and modiﬁed (e.g. seleno-
cysteine, pyrrolysine) amino acids or gaps. More speciﬁc require-
ments, such as the occupancy of amino acid positions, can also be
satisﬁed using preprocessing methods described in the previous
section. Minimal numbers of sequences to be included in the
MSAs are recommended to be 100 and 250 in SCA and DI
methods, respectively, in accord with the original studies. All meth-
ods are available in the API and through ‘evol’ program, and their
usage is illustrated in the Evol Tutorial on the ProDy Web site.

2.3 Structure and dynamics analysis

ProDy was originally designed for inferring structural dynamics
from PCA of experimental structural datasets, as well as predic-
tions of the Gaussian network model (GNM) of other elastic net-
work models (ENMs) (Bahar et al., 2010). Building on these
methods, we have implemented perturbation-response scanning
(Atilgan and Atilgan, 2009), an ENM variant with structure-
based force constants (Lezon and Bahar, 2010), rotations-trans-
lations of blocks method (Tama et al., 2000), membrane ENM
model (Lezon and Bahar, 2012) and ENM reduction (Hinsen
et al., 2000) and extension algorithms that enable mapping the
model to smaller or larger parts of the studied system. In addition,
we added features for essential dynamics analysis (EDA) (Amadei
et al., 1993) of MD trajectories. Along with the Evol suite, ProDy
now permits comparison of sequence evolution data and
structural dynamic patterns predicted by ENMs or deduced
from experimental data (PCA) or simulations (EDA).

2.4 Comparisons of sequence evolution and structural
dynamics

Of particular interest is to understand the dynamical properties
of conserved amino acids and vice versa. On calculation of
mobility and conservation proﬁles for a given protein or a
protein family, the proﬁles can be compared using Pearson’s or
Spearman’s correlation coefﬁcients (Liu and Bahar, 2012).
ProDy and Evol API functions enable such comparisons by
facilitating mapping between structure— and sequence-based
models, i.e. missing residues in the structure or sequence are
represented with dummy atoms, and outputting results as
numerical arrays that can be fed directly into the statistical
analysis modules of SciPy, NumPy and Matplotlib.

2.5 NM Wiz for visual comparative analysis

We enhanced in v1.5 the capabilities of the Normal Mode Wizard
(NM Wiz) plug-in, which is now distributed with VMD
(Humphrey et al., 1996). NM Wiz can be used to analyze all
molecule and trajectory ﬁle formats supported by VMD and to
perform a comparative visual analysis of structural dynamics
and sequence evolution. Figure 1 displays screenshots of VMD
molecular representations (Panel B) and MultiPlot and
Heatmapper plots (Panels C and D) showing conservation and
mobility proﬁles and evolutionary and dynamical correlations,
all generated through NM Wiz.

2.6 An illustrative example

Figure 2 illustrates an application of ProDy and Evol to compare
the sequence conservation and coevolution patterns of the
RNase A family of proteins with the global dynamics of a struc-
turally resolved (Holloway et al., 2009) member of the family.
Panel A shows the correlation between sequence entropy (gray
bars) and mobility proﬁle of residues predicted by the GNM
based on all modes (black), and a subset of global modes
(eight lowest frequency modes, blue). Active site residues Q11,
K41 and H119 have minimal entropy and low mobility. Panel B
displays the ribbon diagrams color-coded by residue conserva-
tion (left) and intrinsic conformational mobility (right). Highly
conserved (low entropy) residues, colored blue on the left dia-
gram also have lower mobility (blue, right). Conversely, highly
variable residues (rea’, left) tend to occupy highly mobile regions
(rea’, right). A few residues are highlighted (encircled in A and B)
to ease the comparison. Panel C shows the mutual information
map generated for the family. The bright points (cyan to red) in
the heat map refer to pairs that have high coevolution propen-
sities. A number of evolutionarily correlated but sequentially
distant (:6 intervening residues) pairs of sites are highlighted
(circles), including spatially close (magenta) or distant (orange)
pairs shown in panel D. Notably, (C65, C72) forms a disulﬁde
bridge; (T82, H48) make side chain (polar) interactions (left
diagram); and the pairs (N71, Q11) and (T36, D14) are

presumably involved in allosteric interactions (right diagram).
The right diagram in panel D displays the RNase A crystallized
in the presence of an inhibitor-like substrate (thin stick represen-
tation) (Holloway et al., 2009). Q11 and N71 form hydrogen
bonds with the substrate to ensure binding/recognition speciﬁ-
city, whereas D14 (near the binding site) shows long-range
coevolution with a distant part of the residue (T36) suggestive
of allosteric communication.

3 CONCLUSION

Evol adds new API features and command line applications to
ProDy for rapid assessment and visualization of sequence con-
servation and coevolution patterns and allows for examining
these results in the light of the structure and dynamics of pro-
teins, motivated by our current understanding of the role of in-
trinsic dynamics in sequence evolution. The ProDy API and the
new extensions implemented here can harness efﬁcient and
powerful features of other open-source scientiﬁc packages (e.g.
NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib), to harness their efﬁcient and
powerful features, thus making the API suitable for interactive
usage and rapid and easy development of new applications.

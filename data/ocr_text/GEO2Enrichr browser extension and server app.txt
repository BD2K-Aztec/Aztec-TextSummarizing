Abstract

Motivation: Identification of differentially expressed genes is an important step in extracting know—
ledge from gene expression profiling studies. The raw expression data from microarray and other
high—throughput technologies is deposited into the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and served as
Simple Omnibus Format in Text (SOFT) files. However, to extract and analyze differentially ex—
pressed genes from GEO requires significant computational skills.

Results: Here we introduce GEOZEnrichr, a browser extension for extracting differentially ex—
pressed gene sets from GEO and analyzing those sets with Enrichr, an independent gene set en—
richment analysis tool containing over 70 000 annotated gene sets organized into 75 gene—set libra—
ries. GEOZEnrichr adds JavaScript code to GEO web—pages; this code scrapes user selected
accession numbers and metadata, and then, with one click, users can submit this information to a
web—server application that downloads the SOFT files, parses, cleans and normalizes the data,
identifies the differentially expressed genes, and then pipes the resulting gene lists to Enrichr for
downstream functional analysis. GEOZEnrichr opens a new avenue for adding functionality to
major bioinformatics resources such GEO by integrating tools and resources without the need for
a plug—in architecture. Importantly, GEOZEnrichr helps researchers to quickly explore hypotheses
with little technical overhead, lowering the barrier of entry for biologists by automating data pro—
cessing steps needed for knowledge extraction from the major repository GEO.

Availability and implementation: GEOZEnrichr is an open source tool, freely available for installa—
tion as browser extensions at the Chrome Web Store and FireFox Add—ons. Documentation and a
browser independent web application can be found at http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/gZe/.

accumulating expression datasets for extracting more knowledge
from such data.

One of the major repositories for gene expression data is the
Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), a public database maintained by
the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) for de-
positing and serving functional genomics data, mostly from gene ex—
pression profiling studies (Edgar et 61]., 2002). GEO contains a
search engine and each dataset is provided with metadata that in—
cludes the publication associated with each dataset, the assay plat—
form, and a description of the experiment and conditions for each
sample. GEO stores data in tab—delimited ASCII text files called
Simple Omnibus Format in Text (SOFT) files. GEO organizes data
into four primary types: GEO sample (GSM), GEO series (GSE),
GEO dataset (GDS) and, GEO platform (GPL), which are acces—
sioned with unique and constant identifiers. GSMs contain expres—
sion measurements from a single experiment where each sample
consists of pairs of probe IDs and their expression values. GSEs or—
ganize samples into sets which make up a complete study. GDSs
contain more curated and annotated sets of samples from related
GSEs. GPLs contain the lists of probe IDs along with mappings of
probes to genes for the various expression platforms that are sup—
ported. While the interface that provides access to GDSs has func—
tionality to identify differentially expressed genes, it is difficult for a
user to obtain a coherent view of the results, or to have the ability to
analyze the differentially expressed genes with prior biological
knowledge for functional characterization and link to external tools.
GSEs provide the data for processing with R using the GEOZR for-
mat and this creates a barrier to entry for biologists without compu—
tational expertise in R. Here we present GEOZEnrichr, a browser
extension and a web—based client/server application that adds func—
tionality to the GEO site for easier extraction of differentially ex-
pressed genes, and for piping such differentially expressed genes to
the external gene set enrichment analysis tool Enrichr (Chen et 61].,
2013). GEOZEnrichr’s front—end adds buttons and a modal dialog
box to GEO’s GDS and GSE pages via the extension; whereas the
back—end of GEOZEnrichr handles the downloading, processing and
analyzing of the expression data from GEO specified by the user
input.

2 Methods

GEOZEnrichr is comprised of two parts: A browser extension that
embeds functionality into GEO web pages, and a web—based inde—
pendent application for data processing and storage. The front—end of
the browser extension and web—application are written in JavaScript,
HTML and CSS. The back—end server—side is written in Python and
uses Flask, a framework for serving Python web applications. The de—
ployed project consists of an Apache web server and the Web Server
Gateway Interface (WSGI)—compliant application Flask (Grinberg,
2014). The web browser loads the extension when the user navigates
to a GEO web page. Upon loading of a GDS or a GSE web—page,
GEOZEnrichr embeds itself onto the page as a single button. Once
clicked, after sample selection, the button opens a modal dialog box
(Fig. 1) that allows users to add metadata about the datasets they se—
lected for analysis, and choose settings for identifying the differentially
expressed genes. Once the samples are submitted for an analysis,
GEOZEnrichr checks if the values maximum range is greater than 100
to determine if the original data was already transformed to log—scale.
Based on this assumption, if the data was not log—transformed,
GEOZEnrichr log2 transforms the data. Similarly, GEOZEnrichr
checks if any row’s median or standard deviation deviates from the

average median or standard deviation by a magnitude greater than 4.
If either is true, GEOZEnrichr quantile normalizes the data.
Differential expression is then computed using the Characteristic
Direction method (Clark et 61]., 2014). The Characteristic Direction
uses a Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classifier, in which the
probability that a sample x derives from each of the classes G is mod—
eled with the Bayes’ rule. By making the assumption that the class—
conditional density is a multivariate Gaussian, and that the covariance
matrix for each class is the same, the class boundary is a hyperplane
with a normal vector. This vector defines the orientation of the classi—
fication boundary hyperplane and the Characteristic Direction ap—
proach uses this vector to characterize the differential expression
between the two classes. Recently, we demonstrated that the
Characteristic Direction method significantly outperforms all the lead—
ing methods in the field including: limma, DESeq and SAM when
benchmarked these methods with data from transcription factors
knockdowns followed by expression and ChIP—seq data collected for
the same transcription factors. GEOZEnrichr also provides the T—test
as an alternative method to compute differential expression. Future
implementations of GEOZEnrichr will add other statistical tests
including the ones mentioned above.

To programmatically download files from GEO and access the
metadata from each study, GEOZEnrichr queries GEO with the
Entrez Programming Utilities (E-Utils) application programming
interface (API) (Sayers and Wheeler, 2004). When parsing SOFT
files GEOZEnrichr discards lines with null values. It then converts
probe IDs to their appropriate gene symbols by using a persistent
key—value store that maps probe IDs to gene symbols for many plat—
forms. The key—value store was created from the GPL files on GEO.
Probes that cannot map to gene symbols are dropped. Next, the ex—
pression values of probes that map to the same gene are averaged.
At this stage the differentially expressed genes are identified by the
Characteristic Direction method (Clark et al., 2014). Finally,
GEOZEnrichr submits the up—, down— and combined—gene—sets to
Enrichr for gene set enrichment analysis using the Enrichr API. A re-
sults page is opened in a new tab with links to download a cleaned
data table, the gene sets and the links to Enrichr.

3 Results

GEOZEnrichr adds useful functionality to the GEO database, lower—
ing the barrier to entry for biologists to extract gene sets from GEO.
So far the application was used to quickly create three types of gene
set libraries: one for extracting single gene perturbations (2800 signa—
tures), one for extracting drug induced signatures, and one for ex—
tracting disease signatures. These three gene—set libraries were
created by students from the Coursera (Adams, 2012) course
Network Analysis in Systems Biology https://www.coursera.org/
course/netsysbio. The students from the course collectively used the
tool in a crowdsourcing microtask (Good and Su, 2013) to build
these gene gene—set libraries. To submit gene expression signatures,
the students utilized a crowdsourcing portal we developed for the
BD2K-LINCS Data Coordination and Integration Center available at
http://maayanlab.net/crowdsourcing. Comparing single gene knock-
downs, drug—induced and disease signatures can be used to identify
novel relationships between genes and diseases, and suggest novel
drug targets, as well as provide hypotheses for drug repurposing. So
far, the GEOZEnrichr Chrome extension was installed by over 700
users. The systematic use of GEOZEnrichr is generating a searchable
resource for gene expression signatures that will be used in the future
by the broad scientific community including the users of Enrichr.

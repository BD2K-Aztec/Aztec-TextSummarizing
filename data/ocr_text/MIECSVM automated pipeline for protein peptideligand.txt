Abstract

Motivation: MIEC—SVM is a structure—based method for predicting protein recognition specificity.
Here, we present an automated MIEC—SVM pipeline providing an integrated and user—friendly
workflow for construction and application of the MIEC—SVM models. This pipeline can handle
standard amino acids and those with post—translational modifications (PTMs) or small molecules.
Moreover, multi—threading and support to Sun Grid Engine (SGE) are implemented to significantly

 

boost the computational efficiency.

Availability and implementation: The program is available at http://wanglab.ucsd.edu/MlEC—SVM.

1 Introduction

Accurate prediction of the binding specificity of proteins, particu—
larly those whose interacting partners are conformationally ﬂexible,
remains a great challenge. Many computational methods have been
developed to meet this challenge (Chen et 61]., 2008; Hui et 61].,
2013) and one of them is the MIEC—SVM method. This method has
been successfully applied to predict the binding specificity of diverse
systems including 5H3 domains (Hou et 61]., 2008, 2009, 2012),
PDZ domains (Li et al., 2011), chromodomains (He et 61]., 2015)
and HIV protease (Ding et 61]., 2013a,b; Hou et 61]., 2009). Here, we
present an automated MIEC—SVM pipeline that allows users to pre—
dict interacting partners using the existing MIEC—SVM models as
well as to construct new models for the protein families of their own
interest.

2 MIEC-SVM pipeline

The MIEC—SVM method aims to characterize the energetic pat—
terns of proteins binding to their partners. Based on computational
modeling of the complex structures, molecular interaction energy
components (MIECs) such as van der Waals and electrostatic
interaction energies between protein and peptide residues at the
interaction interface are computed using biophysical models. Using

the available binding specificity data, a classification model using
a support vector machine (SVM) is then trained to predict binding
and non—binding events. The MIEC—SVM method integrates ener—
getic characteristics (MIEC) and a machine learning method
(SVM) to reduce the error and noise in pure binding free energy
calculations or bioinformatics methods based on sequence alone.
Our previous studies have demonstrated that the MIEC—SVM
method shows superior performance in predicting specificities of
modular domains binding to peptides, scoring docking poses and
identifying drug resistant mutants (Ding et 61]., 2013a,b; Hou
et al., 2012; Li et al., 2011).

To make the method more accessible to the scientific commu—
nity, we construct a pipeline to facilitate the use of existing
MIEC—SVM models and the construction of new ones (See
Supplementary Material for detailed instructions). The pipeline is
divided into three consecutive modules (Fig. 1A): complex struc—
ture building, MIEC generation and SVM training/prediction. The
modular design of the program allows easy customization of the
standard protocol for a particular application. The pipeline is im-
plemented in Perl and can be installed in Linu>dUnix systems with
Perl support. Computationally demanding steps are implemented
with multi-threading for multi—core CPUs. Moreover, SGE (Sun
Grid Engine) is integrated into the energy decomposition part of

3 Example: MIEC-SVM application on SUV92
chromodomain mutant

SUV92 is a H3K9 specific methyl—transferase and specifically recog—
nizes H3K9me3 with its chromodomains. Our previous study (He
et 61]., 2015) showed that the binding specificity of the SUV92
chromodomain to 457 selected peptides can be altered by only a few
mutations. The MIEC—SVM model trained from 13 human chromo-
domains performs well on predicting the binding specificity of the
SUV92 mutants. Here, we use one of the SUV92 chromodomain
mutants (E48L/K85L/L88F, Fig. 1B) to demonstrate the application
of the MIEC—SVM pipeline.

The first module is ‘complex building’. The complex structure of
the SUV92 mutant and peptide is generated through virtual muta—
genesis. For each mutant—peptide interaction, 8 complex structures
were generated from the corresponding templates, which were taken
from the molecular dynamics simulation trajectory of the SUV92
wild type. The peptide sequence and the mutated sites are input to
the pipeline using two plain text files. For residues that are non—
standard amino acids, molecular information of these residues can
be input to the database ‘MolDB’. For the SUV92 mutant, ‘MolDB’
includes the information of several modified amino acids, such as
mono—, di—, tri—methylated lysine, di—methylated arginine, phos—
phorylated serine and phosphorylated threonine.

Depending on whether the peptide contains post—translation
modifications (PTMs), two different protocols are used to build the
complex structure. For standard amino acids, the program Scwrl
(Krivov et 61]., 2009) generates the side chain conformations of the
mutated residues. For residues with PTMs, the residue is first
mutated to the un—modified version using Scwrl. Then, PTMs are
added to the residue and the complex conformation is optimized by
the sander program in the AMBER package(Case et 61]., 2010). The

complex modeling step is followed by the MM/GBSA energy decom—
position, with the igb : 2 option, to generate the energy decompos—
ition profile. For each residue pair between the SUV92 mutant and
the peptide, four energy components are used to characterize the
interaction, including van de Waals (VDW), electrostatics (ELE),
generalized Born (GB) and surface area (SA).

The second module is ‘MIEC construction’. We construct the
MIEC profile for each mutant—peptide complex as such: (Pl—VDW,
P1-ELE, P1-GB, P1-SA, PZ-VDW. . . , Pn-GB, Pn-SA, Q1-VDW,Q1-
ELE...Qm-GB, Qm-SA), where Pi is the ith residue pair between
receptor and ligand, and Qj is the jth residue pair between the adja—
cent ligand residues. In the chromodomain application, we include
all residue pairs whose minimum distances are less than 10  Users
can also combine different energy components (Hou et 61]., 2009) or
contributions from multiple residue pairs (Ding et 61]., 2013a,b) to
construct MIECs.

In the third module of ‘MIEC—SVM’, the MIEC profiles from the
eight templates are averaged. Each component of the MIEC profile
of the mutant is linearly scaled to the range of —1 and 1. The SUV92
mutant MIEC profile is input to the MIEC—SVM model trained on
the 13 human chromodomains interacting with 457 peptides. By
comparing to the peptide microarray data between the mutant and
the 457 peptides (He et 61]., 2015), we demonstrate that the predic—
tion performance of the chromodomain MIEC—SVM model on the
SUV92 mutant is 0.832 measured by AUC of ROC curve (Fig. 1C).
Note that the previously trained MIEC—SVM models for predicting
chromodomain binding specificity(He et 61]., 2015) and HIV prote—
ase drug resistance(Ding et 61]., 2013a,b) are also available to users.
Moreover, this module also includes ‘SVM training’ for users to
build their own model of interest with feature selection using
LASSO logistic regression.

4 Conclusion

The MIEC—SVM method is a powerful tool to predict the binding
specificity of proteins. The pipeline presented here automates the
model training and prediction, which will greatly facilitate the
broader application of this method.

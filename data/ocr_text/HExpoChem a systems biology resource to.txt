ABSTRACT

Summary: Humans are exposed to diverse hazardous chemicals
daily. Although an exposure to these chemicals is suspected to
have adverse effects on human health, mechanistic insights into
how they interact with the human body are still limited. Therefore,
acquisition of curated data and development of computational biology
approaches are needed to assess the health risks of chemical expos-
ure. Here we present HExpoChem, a tool based on environmental
chemicals and their bioactivities on human proteins with the objective
of aiding the qualitative exploration of human exposure to chemicals.
The chemical—protein interactions have been enriched with a quality-
scored human protein—protein interaction network, a protein—protein
association network and a chemical—chemical interaction network,
thus allowing the study of environmental chemicals through formation
of protein complexes and phenotypic outcomes enrichment.
Availability: HExpoChem is available at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/

1 INTRODUCTION

Humans, in their daily lives, are exposed to diverse hazard-
ous chemicals through their environment, and it has been recog-
nized as an important component in the interplay between genes,
lifestyle/diet, natural environmental exposure and disease etiology
(Judson er al., 2012; Rappaport, 2012). Hazardous chemicals are
present in everything from food to consumer products to indus-
trial efﬂuents. However, knowledge about their mechanisms of
action within the human body is still limited.

As large-scale databases on chemical toxicity, i.e. ACTOR
(Judson er al., 2012) and the Comparative Toxicogenomics
Database (CTD; Davis et al., 2011), are being assembled, investi-
gation of the relationship between environmental chemicals and
human diseases can be investigated much more systematically, not
solely at the molecular level but also at the cellular and systems
level. For example, integration of chemical toxicology within

systems biology using protein—protein interaction (PPI) and pro-
tein—protein association network (PPAN) has been suggested to
allow previously uncharacterized connections between chemical
compounds and diseases to be revealed (Audouze er al., 2010;
Audouze and Grandjean, 2011).

Here, we present HExpoChem, a server with the aim to explore
chemicals exposure and their impact on human health.
HExpoChem is distinct from other tools, as (i) it provides infor-
mation about the source of the chemical exposure, (ii) it identifies
proteins interacting with a chemical and consequently suggests
chemical—chemical interactions and qualitative cumulative risk of
chemical mixtures and (iii) it integrates PPI and PPAN data into
biological outcomes and environmental diseases using computa-
tional biology approaches.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

2.1 Exposure resources

Five different human environmental exposures are considered in
HExpoChem, four of which are exogenous sources: medicinal
drugs, cosmetics, foods and industrial chemicals such as pesticides
and plasticizers. Human endogeneous metabolites are chosen as
the endogenous source, as these might interfere with the xeno-
biotics. Description of the data source can be found in additional
Supplementary Material.

For each source of exposure, we developed a chemical—protein
repository by manual curation, using interactions from three data-
bases, i.e. STITCH 3.1 (Kuhn er al., 2012), CTD and DrugBank
(Knox er al., 2011). We integrated 10183 unique chemicals with
19483 human proteins for a total of 284 533 interactions (details
provided in Supplementary Table S1). An interaction could either
be binding data from STITCH and DrugBank (chemical A is
binding to protein B) or gene expression information from CTD
(chemical A is affecting the gene expression of protein B). The
effect of a small molecule on a protein, i.e. agonist or antagonist,
is included when available. We decided to not include all chem-
ical—protein interactions provided by STITCH, but instead only
consider interactions that reached at least a confidence score of 0.5
(a little superior to a medium confidence according to STITCH).

2.2 Connecting chemical biology to diseases and biological
outcomes

Once the relationships between chemicals and proteins are char-
acterized, the impact of such associations is evaluated as a

complex system. Diverse biological outcomes of interest such as
(i) human diseases: OMIM (Hamosh et al., 2005) and GeneCards
(Safran et al., 2010), (ii) pathways: KEGG (Kanehisa et al., 2010)
and Reactome (Croft et al., 2011) and (iii) Gene Ontology terms:
GO (Camon et al., 2004) are evaluated. Four output styles are
generated to assist the user: (i) PPI, (ii) PPAN, (iii) topological
protein clustering (TPC) and (iv) chemical—chemical interactions
(CCI). Globally, for each PPI and PPAN output, a small biolo-
gical network representing a protein complex is depicted. Pointing
the cursor to one of the annotations highlights the corresponding
proteins. A corrected P—value is included to evaluate the correl-
ation of the protein complex to a biological outcome (the lower
the value, the stronger is the correlation). The outputs for TPC are
lists of proteins corresponding to a cluster and overlapping
proteins. Finally, CCIs are based on the assumption that two bio-
active chemicals (i.e. agonist—agonist or antagonist—antagonist) for
the same set of proteins could have a more signiﬁcant cumulative
effect than only showing an activity on one protein.

Overall, a download option is available to obtain the output
information in a ﬂat format for further analysis. Details about
these outputs can be found in the Supplementary Section. A work-
ﬂow of the implementation is shown in Figure 1.

3 APPLICATIONS

As an example, we tested carvone, a natural compound found in
essential oils from caraway and dill. This compound is used in
food additives and cosmetics and has exhibited repellent and
herbicide activities. HExpoChem automatically represented the
chemical structure (using the Chemaxon applet) and seven pro-
teins that are deregulated by this compound. ‘Cosmetic’, ‘food’
and ‘industrial’ were depicted as the possible sources for human
exposure to it. PPI search retrieved protein interactions for six of
the proteins, and enrichment to several biological outcomes were
suggested. For example, the protein complex interacting with the
protein C2 was associated with lupus erythematosus, a potential

Fig. 1. The HExpoChem implementation. Chemical data for ﬁve expos-
ure sources are collected from various resources, and combined with their
interacting proteins. Four types of protein complexes (PPI, PPAN, TPC
and CCI) are generated, using different input data. diseases, pathways
and Gene Ontology terms are integrated into these protein complexes,
allowing prediction of potential biological outcomes of chemicals

reaction to carvone. The CCI search shows that many others
chemicals also interact with the protein C2 and so can increase
the impact on the biological outcomes described in the PPI. More
examples are provided in the Supplementary Material.

4 CONCLUSION

In conclusion, HExpoChem assists in the exploration of under-
lying molecular mechanisms of the impact of environmental chem-
icals on human health. With the proposed computational systems
biology approach, identiﬁcation of chemicals with similar mode of
action in a biological system is of great interest. For instance,
chemicals present in food, cosmetics and in household products
may share interacting proteins and pathways, and thus affect
human health. Therefore, HExpoChem is complementary to trad-
itional toxicology and epidemiology, and may help in further in-
vestigations of chemical risk assessment by providing new
hypotheses. We expect to maintain and update HExpoChem regu-
larly. For instance, integration of the biological activity measure-
ment and description of the directionality of a PPI are already in
the pipeline for implementation in the near future.

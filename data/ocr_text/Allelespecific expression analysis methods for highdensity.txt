ABSTRACT

Motivation: In the past decade, a number of technologies to quantify
allele-specific expression (ASE) in a genome-wide manner have
become available to researchers. We investigate the application
of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarrays to this task,
exploring data obtained from both cell lines and primary tissue for
which both RNA and DNA profiles are available.

Results: We analyze data from two experiments that make use of
high-density Illumina Infinium || genotyping arrays to measure ASE.
We first preprocess each data set, which involves removal of outlier
samples, careful normalization and a two-step filtering procedure to
remove SNPs that show no evidence of expression in the samples
being analyzed and calls that are clear genotyping errors. We then
compare three different tests for detecting ASE, one of which has
been previously published and two novel approaches. These tests
vary at the level at which they operate (per SNP per individual or per
SNP) and in the input data they require. Using SNPs from imprinted
genes as true positives for ASE, we observe varying sensitivity for
the different testing procedures that improves with increasing sample
size. Methods that rely on RNA signal alone were found to perform
best across a range of metrics. The top ranked SNPs recovered by
all methods appear to be reasonable candidates for ASE.
Availability and implementation: Analysis was carried out in R
(http://www.R-project.org/) using existing functions.

1 INTRODUCTION

Understanding the genetic basis of variation in gene expression is
of considerable interest in biomedical research. The preferential
expression of one of the two alleles of a gene, known as allele—
speciﬁc expression (ASE) is one important class of such variation.
Allelic expression imbalances have been widely studied in the

context of development, where key epigenetic mechanisms such
as X—inactivation and genomic imprinting lead to the silencing of
one allele (Knight, 2004). Recent studies have also linked ASE to
the susceptibility of a number of human diseases (Feng et al., 2006;
Maia et al., 2009; Meyer et al., 2008; van Bilsen et al., 2008).

Genome—wide assessment of ASE has recently become
feasible with the availability of high—density single—nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) chips and second—generation sequencing. A
number of microarray—based studies which quantify ASE in a high—
throughput way have been published in the past decade (Bjornsson
et al., 2008; Daelemans et al., 2010; Ge et al., 2009; Gimelbrant
et al., 2007; Lee, 2005; Lo et al., 2003; Pant et al., 2006; Serre
et al., 2008; Tan et al., 2008). With microarrays, oligonucleotide
probes that distinguish between the signal from allele A and allele
B for SNPs in genomic DNA can measure the relative expression
from each allele when mRNA (converted to cDNA) is hybridized to
the chip. For individuals who are heterozygous (AB) at a particular
SNP, distortions in the expected 1:1 ratio of allele A to allele B in
the RNA signal can be an indication of ASE. Both DNA and RNA
hybridizations are necessary for each sample, in order that genotype
calls (AA, AB, BB) and allelic expression ratios are available for
each SNP on the array.

Illumina’s two—color Inﬁnium technology has been used to
measure ASE in lymphoblastoid cell lines (Ge et al., 2009).
Inﬁnium chemistry differentially labels allele A and allele B with
red and green dye, respectively (Peiffer et al., 2006; Steemers et al.,
2006). The ﬂuorescence of each probe is quantiﬁed by Illumina’s
scanning software and summarized values for each SNP are output
by the GenomeStudio software. To process the raw signal from
the DNA hybridizations into genotype calls, Illumina’s proprietary
GenCall algorithm, implemented in the GenomeStudio software is
typically used.

A number of ASE detection methods have been proposed. These
include locus—speciﬁc approaches, that search for ASE on a SNP—
by—SNP basis (Ritchie et al., 2010; Serre et al., 2008; Tan et al.,
2008) and tests that combine data from neighboring SNPs in the
genome (Ge et al., 2009; Wagner et al., 2010). Irrespective of the
testing method, careful preprocessing to remove non—informative
SNPs and dye—bias has been shown to be important in array—based
ASE data sets that make use of the Illumina genotyping platform
(Ge et al., 2009; Ritchie et al., 2010).

Allele-specific expression analysis for SNP arrays

 

2 APPROACH

In this article, we analyze data from two Illumina Inﬁnium ASE
studies, one involving cell lines and a second involving tissue
samples. We ﬁrst focus on the importance of careful preprocessing
of the raw data. We then compare three ASE testing procedures (one
existing approach and two novel methods) on the preprocessed data
sets. SNPs from known imprinted genes are used as true positives
to compare the performance of the different methods. All methods
trialled are by their very nature, or the way in which we apply them,
expected to identify SNPs for which ASE is relatively common. In
both experiments, biological replication in the form of samples of the
same tissue type from many individuals is available. All analysis was
carried out in the R software environment [(R Development Core
Team, 2011); http://www.R—project.org/, version 2.13.1].

3 METHODS

3.1 Data sets

Data from Ge et al. (2009) which made use of Illumina’s Human 1M—Duo
SNP genotyping BeadChip platform were provided by Bing Ge (personal
communication). Each lM—Duo array contains over 1 million SNPs, and two
samples are processed in parallel per BeadChip. Both RNA and DNA samples
from 53 HapMap individuals (HapMap, 2007) derived from lymphoblastoid
cell lines were hybridized to these arrays. Raw X (allele A) and Y (allele
B) signal for each SNP, along with genotype calls from GenomeStudio were
used in the analysis. Data from 841 816 SNPs were available.

A second data set was generated using Illumina’s HumanExon510s—Duo
genotyping BeadChip platform. This platform contains 511 354 markers, of
which ~330 000 target the coding region of the genome. Normal breast
tissue was obtained from 76 individuals, with RNA and DNA samples
from a given individual hybridized on the same BeadChip. Raw X and Y
signal, along with genotype calls from GenCall (version 1.0, in BeadStudio
version 3.1.3) were used in the analysis. This data set is available from GEO
(www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) under accession number GSE35023.

3.2 Preprocessing

3.2.] Sample ﬁltering Samples for which there was a poor dynamic range
of intensities in either channel (IQR of non—normalized log2X or log2Y
< 1), or clear contamination of RNA with DNA sample [observed by visual
inspection of the M =log2X —log2 Y versus S 205(10ng +log2 Y) plots]
were removed from further analysis (see Supplementary Figure $1). This
left 53 and 64 samples in the 1M and 510s data sets, respectively.

3.2.2 Normalization Normalization is a key step in any microarray
analysis, and we use within—array strip—level quantile normalization to
correct for dye—biases between the two channels (in general X: Cy5
2 allele A and Y: Cy3 2 allele B) from each array, as previously
recommended for Illumina Inﬁnium BeadChip data (Ritchie et al., 2009)
to obtain normalized intensities (X * and Y *) for each SNP. The function
crlmm: : :stripNormalize in the crlmm R package (version 1.10.0,
available from http://www.bioconductor.org) was used to normalize the
data. Log—ratios (M=log2X*—log2 Y *) and average log—intensities [S=
0.5(log2X*+log2 Y *)] were then calculated for each SNP on each array.
We work on the log—ratio scale rather than the ﬁ—scale [82X */ (X * +Y*),
as used in (Ge et al., 2009)], as it has been shown to have more desirable
properties for statistical testing in other applications of Inﬁnium technology
(Du et al., 2010).

3.2.3 SNP and call ﬁltering Figure 1 shows the RNA and DNA signal
from three typical SNPs. In general, we observe a linear relationship between
the homozygous RNA and DNA M —values, which motivates us to ﬁt a SNP—
wise linear model (ﬁtted using the lm function from the stats R package,

Fig. 1. Plot of signal from three SNPs from the 1M lymphoblastoid
data set, illustrating typical signal characteristics for RNA (y—axis) versus
DNA (x—axis) log—ratios. All three SNPs are from imprinted genes.
(A) SNP rs207l970 from the paternally imprinted gene L3MBTL. This
example illustrates bi—allelic expression, with the RNA log—ratios from the
heterozygotes (AB, red) showing signal more like that from a homozygote
(AA, blue; BB, green). (B) SNP rs9373409 from the gene PLAGL which is
known to be imprinted in foetal tissues but not in lymphocytes. Accordingly,
there is no evidence for ASE for this SNP, with the AB RNA log—ratios
around zero. For the SNPs in panels A and B, there is a strong linear trend
between the homozygous RNA and DNA log—ratios. (C) SNP rs1003483
(from the gene IGF2AS) provides an example of non—speciﬁc signal, where
the RNA log—ratios lie around zero irrespective of the alleles present. In this
ﬁnal example, there is a very weak linear trend between the homozygous
log—ratios. These observations motivate the removal of SNPs with low slope
for the regression between the RNA and DNA homozygous log—ratios.

to increase as expression level increases. To remove non—informative SNPs
which show no evidence of differential expression between the two alleles in
homozygous individuals, we ﬁlter based on slope (y—axis). SNPs with slope

non—informative for ASE in these data sets.

available from http://www.R—project.org/) with an intercept and slope term
to regress the RNA values on the DNA values. The strength of this linear
relationship (magnitude of the slope) dictates how well the two alleles can be
distinguished from one and other. Figure 2 shows that the majority of SNPs
with low slope are also weakly expressed, with low average intensity. For
SNPs with a slope <0.2 (such as the example given in Fig. 1C), the two alleles
were deemed not to be differentially expressed in the tissue being analyzed.
This cut—off was chosen by careful inspection of the distribution of slopes.
After applying this ﬁlter, we are left with 288 396 and 172 123 SNPs in the
full analysis of all samples in the 1M and 510s data sets, respectively.

All ASE detection methods rely on accurate genotype calls. To avoid false
positives or false negatives driven by genotyping errors, such as the examples
illustrated in Figure 3, it is necessary to remove erroneous calls. To do this,

Fig. 3. Plot of signal from two SNPs from the 1M data set with possible
genotyping errors. (A) SNP rs2732050 has bi—allelic expression and multiple
genotyping errors, particularly for the AA calls. Such errors will effect Tan’s
method, and lead to false negative ASE calls. (B) SNP rs37630 has errors with
the heterozygous SNP calls, which will lead to a false positive declaration of
ASE by all methods compared. Individual calls such as these which are clear
genotyping errors were removed from further analysis. Errors were detected
as described in the Methods, using the DNA signal alone.

we apply kmeans clustering with k = 3 clusters to the DNA signal from each
SNP using the kmeans function from the stats R package (available from
http://www.R—project.org/). We then compare the kmeans cluster assignment
to the genotype calls from GenCall, and remove individual calls which are
discrepant. Both the DNA and matched RNA signal from these discordant
calls are excluded from ASE testing.

3.3 Testing methods

A summary of the three methods that will be applied to these data sets is
given in Table 1.

3.3.1 Tan The ﬁrst is from Tan et al. (2008) and Serre et al. (2008),
which we refer to as the method of Tan in the remainder of this article. This
method interpolates the upper and lower limits (mean + / — 2SD) of the RNA
heterozygous log—ratios from the homozygous RNA and DNA log—ratios to
give a ‘normal’ range of allelic imbalance amongst the heterozygotes. For
each heterozygous SNP, the ratio of the absolute distance between a given
observation and the heterozygous cluster mean ( ld |) and the absolute distance
from the cluster mean and nearest limit (|r|) is calculated.

We use the proportion of heterozygous SNPs for which this value
(0 = ld | / |r|) is greater than a given threshold (typically 0> 2) to rank SNPs.
An average ASE score (0) is also calculated for each SNP with at least one
heterozygous observation that satisﬁes this ASE criteria, which can help
resolve ties that occur when ranking by proportion. Tan’s method can be
applied to SNPs with a minimum of three heterozygote and ﬁve homozygote
observations, and at least one observation for the homozygote of the minor
allele.

3.3.2 Variance The second method is motivated by the observation that
the RNA log—ratios of SNPs from genes which show ASE are more variable
compared with the RNA log—ratios from either homozygote (AA or BB)
cluster (Fig. 1A). To formally test this, we use the var.test function
from the stats package to perform an F —test for each SNP to look for
excess variation between the heterozygotes versus the pooled homozygotes
(adjusted to have mean zero). SNPs are then ranked by their P—value (and
F —statistic in the event of ties) to assess evidence for ASE. We require at
least three homozygote and three heterozygote observations to perform this
testing procedure. This method is referred to as the Variance method in the
remainder of this article.

3.3.3 Cluster The ﬁnal method makes use of RNA signal from the
heterozygotes only. Given the observation that two distinct clusters (Fig. 1A)
are often observed for imprinted genes, this approach applies kmeans
clustering with k = 2 clusters to the RNA log—ratios for each SNP separately.
SNPs are then ranked based on the distance between the two clusters (largest
to smallest), with larger distances indicative of stronger ASE. At least three
heterozygote observations are required to perform this testing procedure,
which makes use of the kmeans function in the stats package. This method
is referred to as the Cluster method in the remainder of this article.

3.3.4 Independent truth A list of 65 imprinted genes in human were
downloaded from the Imprinted Gene Database (http://www.geneimprint
.com/). SNPs which were assigned to these genes according to Illumina’s
chip annotation ﬁles (downloaded from Illumina’s iCom customer website,
https://icom.illumina.com/) were used as true positives for ASE in our
subsequent analysis to allow comparison of the sensitivity of the three
methods described above. In total, there were 1669 SNPs on the 1M and 575
SNPs on the 510s which could be assigned to these genes, and had sufﬁcient
slope or number of heterozygous or homozygous calls to be used in the
comparison. The speciﬁcity of the different methods could not be assessed
due to the lack of a suitable true negative set for ASE. SNPs from genes in
the true positive set that are either not expressed in the tissue being analyzed
(Fig. 1C) or expressed but not imprinted (Fig. 1B) can be considered true
negatives. However, there is not a convenient way to independently identify
such cases in advance. Also, SNPs in the ﬁrst class are likely to have been
removed prior to testing by our pre—ﬁltering step (refer to Section 3.2.3),
and those that are expressed but not imprinted are expected to receive a low
ranking by all three methods. As such, we might expect all methods to have
comparable, low true negative rates.

3.3.5 Gene set testing We applied a Wilcoxon rank—based gene set testing
procedure to the positional (C1: gene sets corresponding to chromosome
and cytogenetic bands with at least one gene) and curated (C2: gene sets
collected from online pathway databases and publications in PubMed) gene
sets available from MsigDB (Subramanian et al., 2005) to assess consistency
between the two platforms and analysis methods. SNPs were assigned a gene
symbol based on the information provided with Illumina’s chip annotation.
Genes were ranked according to proportion for Tan’s method (with ties
broken using 0), P—value for the Variance method (with ties broken by the
F —statistic) and the inter—cluster distance measure for the Cluster method.
The geneSetTest function in the limma package [version 3.8.3, (Smyth,
2005)] as used in (Michaud et al., 2008) was used to calculate a P—value
testing whether a given gene set was highly ranked relative to other genes
on the array.

4 RESULTS

Figure 4 shows the data from the RNA hybridizations from the 1M
data set before and after strip—level quantile normalization. Before
normalization, some curvature of the log—ratios at around M :0
is evident (Fig. 4A). This is no longer present after normalization
(Fig. 4B), which is desirable, as the zero line is the level of the

heterozygous M —values expected a priori (ignoring dye—effects and
other biases). Looking across all samples, we see that the distribution
of RNA log—ratios is more variable before normalization (Fig. 4C).
After normalization, these distributions are more comparable and
centered around zero (Fig. 4D). This normalization procedure also
improved the comparability of the DNA log—ratios from the 1M data
set (data not shown) and both the RNA and DNA data from the 510s
data set (data not shown).

We next examined the ability of the different ASE testing methods
to detect SNPs in known imprinted genes. Figure 5 shows the effect
sample size has on the sensitivity of the different methods using
the top—ranked 1000 SNPs from each. To carry out this analysis, a
subset of 10 and 20 samples chosen at random as well as the full 1M
data set (n=53) were analyzed using each of the 3 methods (Tan,
Variance and Cluster). Across this range of sample sizes, we see that
the Cluster method is consistently the best, followed by the Variance
method and Tan’s method. As sample size increases, all methods
recover a greater number of true positive SNPs, although the
improvement in performance is most pronounced for the Variance
method, with a true positive rate approaching that of the Cluster
method for the full data set (Fig. 5C). The performance of the
different methods was similar for the 510s data set (data not shown).

For genes represented by 5 or more SNPs on the array, we were
able to examine how well each method was able to detect multiple
occurrences of ASE within a gene. Supplementary Figure S2 shows
the number of genes detected independently by 2 or more SNPs
amongst the top 1000 candidates from each method. In both data
sets, the Variance and Cluster methods detected multiple ASE hits
in more genes than Tan’s approach.

Fig. 5. Plot showing the number of ‘true positives’ recovered in the 1M data
set as the sample size increases from n= 10 samples (A), to n=20 samples
(B), to the full data set (C, n=53). The Cluster method has the highest
sensitivity across the range of sample sizes tested. The performance of all
methods improves with increasing sample size, with the Variance method
improving the most.

We next assessed whether the three methods had any preference
for detecting SNPs at different expression levels. Boxplots of the
average intensities for the top—ranked 1000 SNPs from each method
for the full 1M and 510s data sets were generated (Supplementary
Figure S3). In both cases, the Variance method has a tendency
to detect SNPs with higher average expression levels than Tan’s
method and the Cluster method. The SNPs selected by the Cluster
method have a distribution most similar to that of the reference
distribution of all SNPs on the array (post—ﬁltering).

Typical examples of SNPs recovered by the respective methods
are shown in Figure 6. Most of these appear to be good candidates
for ASE. Besides examples of classic bi—allelic expression (ﬁrst
column), many SNPs with log—ratios on the continuum from the
homozygous AA to the homozygous BB level (second column)
are also recovered. These two kinds of ASE proﬁle are the most
commonly observed in the top ranked SNPs from each method.

Fig. 6. Plot showing typical examples of SNPs for which ASE was detected
in the 1M data set by Tan’s method (A—C), the Variance method (D—F) and
the Cluster method (G—I). The ranks for each method are given in the top left
of each plot. The majority of these examples appear to be good candidates
for ASE.

A third class particular to Tan’s method is shown in Figure 6C. Such
examples are characterized by low minor allele frequency, which
means the homozygous cluster center for the minor allele will be less
reliably estimated than the cluster center for the major allele. Around
a third of SNPs from the top 200 identiﬁed by Tan’s method fall into
this category, and many of these are likely to be false positives.
A fourth class, that was relatively common for the Variance method,
were cases for which ASE is relatively rare. Figure 6F shows an
example in which two outlying RNA log—ratios drive the ASE signal
for this SNP Around a quarter of the top 200 SNPs ranked by the
Variance method fall into this category. This SNP was also highly
ranked by the Cluster method. Proﬁles of this kind were less common
amongst the top ranked SNPs from the Cluster method (~3 in every
100 from the top 200 SNPs inspected).

Unlike the Variance or Cluster method, Tan’s method contains
the tuning parameter 6 which can be varied depending upon the
desired stringency for ASE. To assess whether the performance of
Tan’s method can be improved, we re—analyzed both the full 1M
(n=53) and 510s (n=64) data sets relaxing the threshold used
for 6. The results of this analysis are shown in Figure 7, which
plots the cumulative number of true positives recovered from known
imprinted genes from the top 1000 SNPs. For both data sets, it is
clear that using a lower, less conservative threshold for 6 produces
much better results than higher values (6 Z 2) as used in a number of
previous studies (Morcos et al., 2011; Serre et al., 2008; Tan et al.,
2008).

We next assess the results from the gene set analysis to look for
concordance between the methods. Figure 8 shows the overlap in
signiﬁcant positional C1 gene sets (those with P—value <0.0001)
between platforms for each method. The Variance (Fig. 8B)

Fig. 8. Consistency of gene set testing results between and within data sets.
Panels A—C show the degree of overlap between the 1M and 510s data
sets for C1 positional gene sets which are over—represented by SNPs with
ASE according to a Wilcox rank test for each method. A cut—off of P—value
< 0.0001 was chosen to select these sets. Not only do the Variance (B) and
Cluster (C) methods have greater power, detecting more signiﬁcant positions
than Tan’s method (A), but the regions selected are more consistent between
platforms and data sets, which would be expected due to the clustering of
imprinting in the genome. Similar results were obtained when other gene sets
were tested (such as Gene Ontology and C2 curated gene sets from MsigDB,
data not shown). Panels D and E show the overlap between methods within
each data set for the curated C2 gene sets. The Variance and Cluster methods
have a greater degree of overlap with each other than Tan’s method. This
ﬁgure was generated using the VennDiagram R package (Chen and Boutros,
2011).

and Cluster (Fig. 8C) methods have greater power, giving more
signiﬁcant gene sets overall than Tan’s method (Fig. 8A). The gene
sets reported are also highly consistent between platforms for the
Variance and Cluster method, which is desirable given that imprinted
genes are clustered in the genome, and many of the strongest ASE
signals will be originating from these imprinted loci. If we look
within a given data set and perform an analysis of the curated C2
gene sets, we similarly ﬁnd that the Variance and Cluster methods

recover more signiﬁcant gene sets than Tan’s method (Fig. 8D—E).
There is also much greater consistency between the gene sets
identiﬁed by the Variance and Cluster methods than between Tan’s
method and the others. The reason for the reduced power of Tan’s
method in each analysis is that beyond the ﬁrst 20 000 or so SNPs
from each data set, the results for the remaining SNPs are tied, which
results in a loss of information and power in the rank—based gene
set test used. The Variance and Cluster methods do not suffer from
this problem, allowing all SNPs to be ordered by their respective
test statistics.

5 DISCUSSION

We have shown that careful preprocessing of data from Illumina
array—based ASE studies is important for improving signal
consistency between different samples, and for avoiding potential
false positives. The normalization and ﬁltering approaches we have
described ensure that the input data for a given ASE testing method
is appropriately standardized and error free (as far as practicable).
A similar strategy is likely to be useful when other microarray
platforms, such as Affymetrix’s two—color Axiom technology, are
used to measure ASE.

A summary of the ﬁndings of our methods comparison is given
in Table 2. The new heuristic approach we describe (Cluster)
outperforms the other methods at recovering SNPs from known
imprinted genes across a range of sample sizes, making it ideal in
small studies. The Variance method was demonstrated to perform
well on larger sample sizes, and was particularly good at detecting
rare cases of ASE, driven by one or two individuals with extreme
allelic expression imbalances. Both methods are appealing on
account of their simplicity and the absence of any tuning parameters
that the user must pre—set to obtain a result. Tan’s method was
found to perform worst initially, however, we observed that the
performance could be improved considerably by relaxing the
threshold for ASE (6). Less conservative values of 6 recovered
more true positive imprinted SNPs than the default value used in
previous studies (6 Z 2), which indicates that true positive candidates
for ASE will have been missed in previous analyses. Tan’s method
is also less powerful and less consistent than both the Cluster and
Variance methods in the gene set analyses carried out, and was less
likely to detect multiple independent ASE hits in genes represented
by several SNPs on the array. Together, these results indicate that
the newer, simpler methods proposed in this article (Cluster and
Variance) offer a good alternative to Tan’s methods for detecting
ASE in SNP microarray data sets.

Future work will be to compare the results obtained from SNP
microarrays with other high—throughput technologies such as RNA—
sequencing to assess the relative advantages and disadvantages of

each platform. Whether similar detection methods can be applied to
the ratios from RNA—seq allele counts remains to be seen.

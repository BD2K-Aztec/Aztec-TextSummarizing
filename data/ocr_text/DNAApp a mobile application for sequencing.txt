ABSTRACT

Summary: There have been numerous applications developed for
decoding and visualization of ab1 DNA sequencing files for
Windows and MAC platforms, yet none exists for the increasingly
popular smartphone operating systems. The ability to decode sequen-
cing files cannot easily be carried out using browser accessed Web
tools. To overcome this hurdle, we have developed a new native app
called DNAApp that can decode and display ab1 sequencing file on
Android and iOS. In addition to in-built analysis tools such as reverse
complementation, protein translation and searching for specific
sequences, we have incorporated convenient functions that would
facilitate the harnessing of online Web tools for a full range of analysis.
Given the high usage of Android/iOS tablets and smartphones, such
bioinformatics apps would raise productivity and facilitate the high
demand for analyzing sequencing data in biomedical research.
Availability and implementation: The Android version of DNAApp is
available in Google Play Store as ‘DNAApp’, and the iOS version is
available in the App Store. More details on the app can be found
at www.facebook.com/APDLab; www.bii.a-star.edu.sg/research/trd/
apd.php

The DNAApp user guide is available at http://tinyurl.com/DNAAppuser,
and a video tutorial is available on Google Play Store and App Store,
as well as on the Facebook page.

1 INTRODUCTION

Single-pass sequencing is a routinely used technique for many
areas of biological research. It is used to assess the accuracy of
automated sequencing outputs and for further analyses such as
primer designs, alignments and BLAST. To meet with the
demands of sequencing services that generate these ﬁles (Applied
Biosystems or ab1 sequencing ﬁles), many software tools (both
freely and commercially available) have been created in the past
decade for Windows/MAC/LinuX Operating Systems (OS). Some
examples of such software include BioEdit (Hall, 1999, 2011; see
www.mbio.ncsu.edu), Chromas (http://www.technelysium.com.
au/), FinchTV (http://www.geospiza.com) and Squssem (www.
sequentiX.de). Given the increasing popularity of (iOS
and Android) smartphone and tablet users in recent years see

inues-rise-stats-210509525.html), Jaume, 2013; it is interesting
that such bioinformatics tools have yet to thoroughly penetrate
such OS and devices. With the recent rise of iPhone/iPad and
Android devices, scientists, along with others, have been beneﬁt-
ing from the convenience of mobility in their everyday lives
(Comstock, 2014; see http://mobihealthnews.com/29253/survey-
doctors-prefer-tablets-for-journal-articles-smartphones-for—most-
other-tasks/), Dufau et al., 2011; Evanko, 2010; Sutton and
Fraser, 2013; see http://lifescientist.com.au/content/biotechnol—
ogy/article/the—rise-of-smartphone-health-and-medical—apps-
1072193834). To raise productivity and expedite research, we have
started to develop bioinformatics applications for these two OS.
Keeping in mind that the purpose of smartphone apps is for con-
venience, we have developed a stripped-down version of software
such as Bioedit and Chromas (we offer protein translation in
addition to other features offered by ChromasLite). DNAApp
is the ﬁrst Android native app to assist in the manipulation and
analysis of sequencing data.

DNAApp runs on both Android and iOS, enabling the decod-
ing of ab1 sequencing ﬁles to display the DNA sequence and the
corresponding chromatogram. This facilitates a broader range of
analysis when used with Web tools such as BLAST and
ClustalW. To use it, the user simply has to specify an ab1 ﬁle
for analysis from any location in the phone memory or from
cloud storage like Dropbox. To accommodate the different
signal strengths generated for each single-pass sequencing reac-
tion, touch screen functions for both vertical and horizontal
scaling of the chromatograms are available. Should the user
face difﬁculties in the touch screen scaling, a scaling slider was
also built in to facilitate chromatogram scaling. This is useful, as
the two ends of the sequencing ﬁles may have decreased signals,
resulting in misreads of nucleotide bases. In addition, to facilitate
the analysis of sequence quality, the quality score (in percentage
scale) of each base was also included. For the analysis of sequen-
cing data generated by reverse primers, we incorporated a reverse
complement function along with its inferred chromatogram.
Should the user desire further analysis using browser-based
bioinformatics tools (such as EXpasy, BLAST, ClustalW), the
“user-deﬁned cut and paste’ function would come in handy, over-
coming the highly difﬁcult task of highlighting sequences in a
touch-screen interface. Similarly, for jumping to speciﬁc loca-
tions of the long data output (typically, at least 700 bases),
we have a user-deﬁned “jump to’ function, as well as a search
function for sequence segments of interest [including primers,

user interface (GUI) of DNAApp and supporting features].
To aid users in further analysis, DNAApp is capable of generat-
ing all six possible translations of a DNA sequence to proteins.
The copy and search functions are applicable for protein
sequences. Should the user require storing the sequence data
as a human-readable text-based document, the DNAApp
allows the export of FASTA format ﬁles. Because the analyzed
sequence would be too long to ﬁt within the device
screen in a single line, we incorporated the use of fast and
end scrolling icons for different speed scrolling. For longer
reads, the app also adapts by autorotation to landscape
orientation.

In the development of DNAApp, the biggest challenge was the
decoding of the sequencing ab1 ﬁle. Using the ABIF (Applied
Biosystem Inc. Format), the elements of data stored in the ab1
ﬁle include the trace data of the four signal channels correspond-
ing to DNA bases adenine (A), guanine (G), thymine (T) and
cytosine (C); the array of peak locations; the DNA sequence
inferred by the base caller of the sequencing system; and the
quality score array. DNAApp acquires each data item by look-
ing up the desired entry in the ﬁle directory, ﬁgures out the
starting offset, data size of each data element and number of
elements the data item has and ﬁnally performs the reading.
Chromatograms are shown by plotting the arrays of trace data
of the four channels A, G, T and C using spline interpolation
(Ahlberg and Nilson, 1967). To generate the reverse complement
chromatogram, inference was done by:

WU] = trace5[L — i— 1], in which b = {A, G, T, C}, where h
is the complement base of b, L is the sequence length, 0 f if L—l.
This feature assesses the conﬁdence of reverse complement bases.

For the segment searching feature, we used the Knuth-Morris-
Pratt algorithm (Knuth et al., 1977)

DNAApp is created for ‘on—the-go’ visualization and quick
analysis of ab1 ﬁles on mobile computing platforms. It has
been built to facilitate integration with online Web tools (access-
ible through mobile browsers) for in-depth analysis if needed.
Examples of such analyses that can be performed are available
in the app download pages and user guide.

The Android version of the application is available in Google
Play Store for Android version 4.4.2 onward and is compatible
with both smart phones and tablet PCs at conﬁgurations as low
as lGhz CPU and 512MB RAM. The iOS version is available in
App Store for iOS 7 and above.

FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

Additional applications will be developed with related features in
the near future for the next generation of bioinformatics tools.

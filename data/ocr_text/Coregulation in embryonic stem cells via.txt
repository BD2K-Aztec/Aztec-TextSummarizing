ABSTRACT

Motivation: With the accumulation of genome-wide binding data for
many transcription factors (T Fs) in the same cell type or cellular con-
dition, it is of great current interest to systematically infer the complex
regulatory logic among multiple TFs. In particular, ChlP-Seq data have
been generated for 14 core TFs critical to the maintenance and repro-
gramming of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). This provides a
great opportunity to study the regulatory collaboration and interaction
among these TFs and with other unknown co-regulators.

Results: In combination with liquid association among gene expres-
sion profiles, we develop a computational method to predict context-
dependent (CD) co-egulators of these core TFs in ESCs from pain/vise
binding datasets. That is, co-occupancy between a core TF and a
predicted co-regulator depends on the presence or absence of bind-
ing sites of another core TF, which is regarded as a binding context.
Unbiased external validation confirms that the predicted CD binding of
a co-regulator is reliable. Our results reveal a detailed CD co-regula-
tion network among the 14 core TFs and provide many other potential
co-regulators showing strong agreement with the literature.

1 INTRODUCTION

Many efforts have been made recently to identify the core regu-
latory network in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs; Chen et al.,
2008; Ivanova et al., 2006; Kim et al., 2008; Zhou et al., 2007).
The network is anchored on three master regulators, namely,
Oct4 (Pou5fl), Sox2 and Nanog. On the other hand, four tran-
scription factors (TFs), Oct4, Sox2, cMyc and Klf4, can repro-
gram somatic cells back to ESC-like cells having the
characteristics of self-renewal and pluripotency (Takahashi and
Yamanaka, 2006). Genome-wide ChIP-Seq data provide the
binding regions of >10 TFs that play key regulatory roles in
mouse ESCs (Chen et al., 2008; Heng et al., 2010; Marson
et al., 2008). Computational analyses have been performed to
identify the sequence motifs of these core TFs (Bailey, 2011;
Mason et al., 2010; Thomas-Chollier et al., 2012) and to detect
other co-regulators that may regulate genes by working with

these TFs (Chen and Zhou, 2011; He et al., 2009). A common
observation on these binding data is the partial and signiﬁcant
overlapping between the binding regions of almost any pair of
the TFs, suggesting extensive co-regulatory interactions among
all of them. In general, one may deﬁne three sets of binding
regions given two TFs, X and Y, that is, the co-bound regions
SXY, and the regions bound only by X or Y, denoted by SAY and
SAX, respectively. From the perspective of TF X, the regions
SXY and S X\Y can be regarded as two different binding contexts,
deﬁned by whether binding is accompanied by TF Y.

In our previous work (Mason et al., 2010), we developed a
speciﬁc motif discovery method, the contrast motif ﬁnder
(CMF), which ﬁnds de novo motifs by contrasting two sets of
sequences, say SXY and SX\Y. Motifs found by CMF are differ-
entially enriched between the two sequence sets. Applying CMF
to contrast co-bound sequences of Oct4 and Sox2 against se-
quences bound only by Oct4, we discovered novel context-de-
pendent (CD) motifs for Oct4, that is, the motif pattern
recognized by Oct4 depends on the nearby Sox2 binding
(Mason et al., 2010). In this work, we generalize this idea to
the prediction of CD co-regulators of a TF. For a TF X with
binding context deﬁned by another TF Y, we aim at ﬁnding
motifs that show differential enrichment between SXY and
Sny. These motifs may be bound by co-regulators of TF X,
dependent on the binding of Y. If a co-regulator Z only works
with X when Y is present, one may expect to ﬁnd the motif of Z
in SXY but not in S X\ y. On the contrary, if Z collaborates with X
when Yis absent, then the motif of Z will be enriched in SAY but
not in S Xy. See Figure la for an illustration. The motif of such a
CD co-regulator can be reliably found by CMF when contrasting
the two sets of sequences. On the other hand, gene expression
proﬁles of the three TFs, X, Y and Z, may provide independent
evidence for the potential CD co-regulation. If Z is a co-regula—
tor of X when Y is present (or absent), one expects to observe
strong positive correlation between the expression proﬁles of X
and Z when the expression level of Y is high (or low) (Fig. 1b).
Such a three-way correlation pattern can be measured by liquid
association (LA) developed by Li (2002).

By combining CD binding and LA among three TFs, we re-
strict our analysis to some speciﬁc CD co-regulation patterns.
We assume that binding site patterns are identical across all sam-
ples from which gene expression data are collected. Use the right
panels in Figure la and b to demonstrate our model. The binding
pattern that X co-binds, respectively, with Z and Y for different
target genes is assumed to be true across all samples. Together
with the three-way expression pattern among the three TFs, we
are considering the following co-regulatory relationship. When

ﬁles of X and Z is strong when Yhas high (left panel) or low (right panel)
expression. The expression levels of X and Z are plotted as solid circles

and those of Y are represented by vertical bars. Note that expression
proﬁles have been centered to have mean zero

the expression of Y is low but that between X and Z is highly
correlated, the co-occurrence between the sites of X and Y is not
functional (because of a lack of Y expression), while the co-bind-
ing between X and Z regulates their target genes. When high
expression of Y with low correlation between the expression of
X and Z is observed, the opposite scenario is considered. This is
of course a simpliﬁed model, which does not include other types
of more general conditional co-regulation. But for the data we
analyzed in this work, a substantial fraction of TF triplets with
CD binding in their ChIP-Seq data indeed show signiﬁcant LA
among their expression proﬁles. See Section 2.3 for details.

2 RESULTS

We performed a systematic study on 14 TFs (Table l) with avail-
able ChIP-Seq data (Chen et al., 2008; Heng et al., 2010; Marson
et al., 2008) to ﬁnd CD co-regulators in mouse ESCs. All of the
14 TFs play critical or relevant regulatory roles in ESCs. For
instance, Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, Esrrb and fo are known regula-
tors of pluripotency and/or self-renewal (Chen et al., 2008); LIF
signal pathway can sustain self-renewal of cells by activating
Stat3 (Niwa et al., 1998); together with Oct4 and Sox2, cMyc
and Klf4 can reprogram somatic cells to pluripotent cells
(Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006). We call them core TFs here-
after. Expression data of Ivanova et al. (2006) and Zhou et al.
(2007) were integrated for LA analysis. Ivanova et al. (2006)
reported expression data on 70 samples in response to RNAi
of a few key TFs and during retinoic acid induction of mouse
ESCs. Zhou et al. (2007) generated 16 expression proﬁles, includ-
ing 3 proﬁles of undifferentiated mouse ESCs, 5 proﬁles from
early embryoid body (EB) with high Oct4 expression, and 8 pro-
ﬁles from EB with low Oct4 expression.

To unify description and simplify notations, we present our
results on the 182 (= 14 x 13) ordered pairs among the 14 core
TFs. For an ordered pair (X, Y), our goal is to predict

co-regulators Z of X with context deﬁned by the presence or
absence of Y binding sites. Two sets of sequences, SXY and
SX\Y, were extracted from the ChIP-Seq data of X and Y
for each ordered pair (more details in ‘Methods’ section). See
Figure 2 for a ﬂowchart including the key steps of our analysis.

2.1 Contrast motif ﬁnding

We input SXY and SX\Y to CMF if both sequence sets have at
least 300 sequences, as de novo motif ﬁnding with a large number
of sequences is often more reliable. This requirement cut down
the number of ordered pairs to 172. We ran CMF to ﬁnd at most
60 motifs for each pair of input sequence sets. For a found motif,
CMF outputs a list of predicted binding sites in each of the two
input sequence sets and computes a likelihood ratio (LR) score
for each predicted site. Usually, a motif found by CMF is only
enriched in one of the two sequence sets and the predicted sites in
the other set may serve as a control set. We performed a two-
sample t—test on the log LR scores from the two sets to determine
the signiﬁcance level of differential enrichment. Consequently,
we obtained a t-statistic with a P—value for each motif found
by CMF. The t—statistic is > 0 (< 0) if the motif is more enriched
in SXY (SX\ Y)-

When contrasting between SXY and S X\ y, CMF is expected to
ﬁnd the motif of Y more enriched in the co-bound sequence set
SXy. Consensus motifs of the 14 core TFs (Table l) were ex-
tracted from TRANSFAC (Matys et al., 2003) and other litera-
ture. For 64 ordered pairs, CMF found the expected motif with
at most one mismatch to the known consensus and with a sig-
niﬁcant t—statistic (P< 10—4). Because our goal is to identify
motifs of co-regulators, we excluded from further analysis all
motifs that match the consensus motifs, or other similar variants
in TRANSFAC, of the 14 core TFs. To reduce false discoveries,
we focused on motifs whose t—statistics were more signiﬁcant
than the t—statistic of at least one expected motif found from
the same pair. Note that CMF may ﬁnd multiple expected
motifs for an ordered pair, all matching the consensus motif
of Y.

Next, two criteria were applied to ﬁlter the motifs. First we
ﬁltered out a motif if its consensus sequence contains >80% of
A/T or G/ C. This removed AT—rich or GC-rich motifs, which are
likely repetitive patterns, and left 372 unique motifs. As we are
interested in CD regulation, we used a P—value cutoff of 1 x 10—4
for the t—statistic to ﬁlter out motifs that did not show signiﬁcant
enrichment difference between S XY and S X\ y. It turned out that
339 motifs passed the P—value cutoff, which gives an extremely
low false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.011% (=372 x10—4/339).
Hereafter, we call them post-ﬁltering (PF) motifs. We classify
all PF motifs into two categories: Y-present motifs, which are
more enriched in SXy, and Y-absent motifs more enriched in

Sﬂy.

2.2 Identifying CD co-regulators

We mapped PF motifs to known position-speciﬁc weight matri-
ces (PWMs) in TRANSFAC (details in ‘Methods’ section), and
according to its annotation 309 of the PF motifs may be recog-
nized by at least one mouse TF. Given an ordered pair (X, Y),
suppose we have found a Y-present motif that may be bound by
a TF Z. Then our hypothesis is that the TF Z may co-regulate

genes with X when Y also binds the regulatory regions (left panel
of Fig. 1a). In this scenario, we call Z a CD co-regulator of
X when Y is present. Analogously, one may deﬁne a CD
co-regulator of X when Y is absent (right panel of Fig. 1a).

Expression proﬁles may provide independent information on
the hypothesized CD co-regulation. Denote by x,y,z the gene
expression proﬁles across n conditions of the TFs, X, Y, Z, re-
spectively. Assume that all the expression proﬁles have been
standardized to have mean zero and a unit variance, and par-
ticularly, y has been transformed to follow the standard normal
distribution. Then the LA between X and Z with respect to Y is
measured by

1 n
LA(X,Z|Y) ZZZXiZiJ/ia (1)
i=1

where x,- is the ith component of x and similarly for y,- and 2,.
Intuitively, if x and z are highly correlated when y,- is positive, the
LA will be large in magnitude. If the correlation between x and z
is independent of y, then LA(X,Z|Y) will be close to zero.
Therefore, if Z is a CD co-regulator of X when Y is present
(absent), we expect LA(X,Z|Y)>0(<0). Moreover, for both
types of CD co-regulation, the overall correlation between x
and z should be positive. See Figure lb for demonstration.
A brief review of LA can be found in ‘Methods’ section.
Consequently, we discarded a candidate co-regulator Z if it
showed negative expression correlation with X or if the sign of
LA(X,Z|Y) was inconsistent with the category of the motif

(Y-present or Y-absent) in both expression datasets (Ivanova
et al., 2006; Zhou et al., 2007). A total of 2187 candidate co-
regulators, after removing redundant ones predicted in the same
ordered pair, passed the above two ﬁltering criteria. Then we
calculated the P—value of the LA score (1) for each candidate
co-regulator Z by permuting the expression proﬁle of Y (Li,
2002). Using a p-value cutoff of 0.01, we obtained 455 co-regu—
lators, over 48 ordered pairs, showing signiﬁcant LA scores, with
an expected FDR of 4.8% (= 2187 >< 0.01/455). For the full list
of the predicted CD co-regulators, see Supplemental Table l.

2.3 Validation by ChIP-Seq data

When we predicted a co-regulator Z for an ordered pair X and Y,
we only used the ChIP-Seq data of X and Y and the gene ex-
pression proﬁles of the three TFs. Therefore, if available, ChIP-
Seq data of Z can be used to validate our results. If Z is predicted
as a co-regulator of X when Yis present (absent), then the ChIP-
Seq peaks of Z should occur more frequently in SXY (SX\Y).
There are four cases (Table 2) in which the predicted co-regula—
tors Z are among the 14 core TFs (and thus have ChIP-Seq data
available) and their motifs (found by CMF) have at most one
mismatch to the corresponding consensus sequences in Table 1.
For the four cases, we calculated the occurrence rates per base
pair of the ChIP-Seq peaks of Z in SXY and in Sﬂy. Then a
P—value was determined by comparing the two rates according to
the two-sample proportion test. We report in Table 2 the P—value
together with the ratio of the peak occurrence rate in S XY to that
in SX\Y for each case.

It is comforting to see that for all the four cases, the predicted
CD co-regulation is validated by the peak occurrences with a
signiﬁcant P—value. Consistent with its predicted role as a Y-pre-
sent co-regulator, nMyc shows much higher binding enrichment
in the corresponding SXY than in SX\Y (here, X is Sox2 and Y is
fo). The ratio of the occurrence rates of the ChIP-Seq peaks of
this TF between the two sets of binding regions is more than ﬁve
with extremely strong statistical signiﬁcance. Similarly, one sees
from the table a few predicted Y-absent co-regulators with strong
support from their ChIP-Seq data. Overall, the high validation
rate conﬁrms the accuracy of our prediction of CD co-regulators.

Many of the 14 core TFs have multiple PWMs in
TRANSFAC, although some of the matrices may have a lower
quality. We found 44 predicted co-regulators whose motifs can
match to at least one TRANSFAC PWM of the 14 TFs and
performed the same ChIP-Seq data validation as for the above
four cases. It turned out that 27 (61%) of the 44 predictions can
be validated by the corresponding ChIP-Seq data (Supplemental
Table 2). This again demonstrates the correctness of the majority
of our predicted CD binding. Figure 3 shows the respective histo-
grams of the ratio and the inverse ratio of the ChIP peak occur-
rence rates for the 23 Y-present and the 21 Y-absent
co-regulators. We see that the validation rate is particularly
high (83% = l9/23) for Y-present co-regulators. Among the 19
co-regulators with this ratio > 1, the P—value of the difference
between peak occurrence rates is <2 x 10—6 for 18 of them and
is ~7 x 10—3 for the other one (Supplemental Table S2).

Using the ChIP-Seq data of the 14 core TFs, we examined the
use of LA among gene expression in predicting CD co-regula—
tors. We identiﬁed 45 triplets (X, Y, Z) for which the ratio of the

peak occurrence rate of Z in SXY to that in SX\Y is > 20 and ﬁve
triplets with the inverse ratio > 5. These are the cases with the
strongest evidence from ChIP-Seq data for Z being a CD co-
bound TF of X. The P—value of the LA score, LA(X,Z|Y), is
<0.01 (our cutoff) for 19 of the 50 triplets. This shows that the
LA ﬁltering step is expected to identify ~40% of the CD co-
regulators of a TF, which seems satisfactory for a large-scale
screening given the high validation rate.

2.4 CD co-regulation network of core TFs

The 27 validated CD co-regulatory interactions among the 14
core TFs are particularly interesting and reliable as supported by
ChIP-Seq data, gene expression data and de nova motif ﬁnding.
These predictions may be incorporated into a network that rep-
resents CD collaborations among the TFs. In this network, a
directed edge from X to Z means that Z is a co-regulator of X.
An edge from Y to the edge between X and Z indicates that the
co-regulatory interaction between X and Z depends on Y. See the
legend of Figure 4.

There are eight validated Y-absent co-regulators, and for most
of them, the binding context is deﬁned by the absence of cMyc
and/or nMyc, two Myc family members with functional redun-
dancy and overlapping expression during early development
(Malynn et al., 2000). Presented in Figure 4a is the subnetwork
of Myc-absent co-regulation between the core factors. Most of
the core TFs in this Myc-absent subnetwork are from the Oct4-
group TFs deﬁned by Chen et al. (2008), including Oct4, Sox2,
Nanog, Stat3 and Smadl. They also deﬁned another distinct
group of TFs, the cMyc group, which tend to form clusters of

binding sites. The cMyc group includes cMyc, nMyc, fo and
E2f 1. Furthermore, Klf4, Esrrb and chcp2ll showed more fre-
quent co-occupancy with the Oct4 group than with the cMyc
group [Fig. 4A in Chen et al. (2008)], and therefore, we also
classify them into the Oct4 group. The subnetwork in Figure
4a shows two general binding patterns of the Oct4 group regu-
lators. They may either co-occupy regulatory elements with other
Oct4 group members or with Myc TFs. For example, Sox2 is a
cMyc-absent co-regulator of Oct4, which means that Oct4 binds
some regions with Sox2 and other regions with cMyc. See right
panel of Figure 1a for illustration. Previous studies have demon-
strated the distinct regulatory roles of the two combinatorial
binding patterns. In both ESCs and induced pluripotent stem
cells (iPSCs), genes associated with cMyc binding, by itself or
in combination with the other three reprogramming factors, are
signiﬁcantly enriched for regulators of metabolic processes, while
genes co-bound by Oct4, Sox2 and Klf4 in absence of cMyc are
mainly implicated in regulation of development (Sridharan et al.,
2009). Genes upregulated in ESCs are enriched in the set of genes
extensively bound by the Oct4 group factors, while downregu-
lated genes are more likely to be co-bound by both groups (Chen
et al., 2008). Simultaneous knockout of cMyc and nMyc in ESCs
led to a signiﬁcant increase in the expression of primitive endo-
derm markers Gata6 and FoxA2 (Neri et al., 2012; Smith et al.,
2010), showing that Myc maintains the undifferentiated state of
ESCs by repressing genes involved in early differentiation.
Combined with these published data, our result of the Myc-
absent co-regulation network suggests that Myc TFs may act
like a regulatory switch: When they occupy the binding neigh-
borhood of Oct4 group factors, the overall regulatory role of the
binding sites become repressive. Moreover, our result implies
that clustering among the Oct4 group binding sites is less tight
when cMyc/nMyc binding is present. For example, Sox2 binding

sites are depleted by 70% in the neighborhood of Oct4 sites when
cMyc co-occupies the region (second row in Table 2).
Consistently, we observed that clustering between the bind-
ing sites of Oct4 and Sox2 is signiﬁcantly stronger
(P = 3.8 x 10—3) in the upstream regions of ESC upregulated
genes than those of ESC downregulated genes (Cha and Zhou,
submitted for publication).

The Y-present co-regulation network among the core TFs is
more complex with 19 ChIP-Seq validated edges in total. We
noticed two signiﬁcant patterns among these links. First, for 12
of the edges the context is deﬁned by fo binding (Fig. 4b).
Galan-Caridad et al. (2007) reported a critical role of fo in
promoting ESC self-renewal, although deletion of fo only
minimally affected the expression of Nanog, Oct4 and Sox2.
The exact regulatory function of fo binding in ESCs is still
unclear. Our analysis suggests a new clue to this question: fo
binding appears to promote the co-occupancy between and
within both groups of core TFs. As such, fo may be import-
ant for a robust regulation of essential target genes for ESC
self-renewal and maintenance by multiple and perhaps redun-
dant TFs. Therefore, deletion of fo may weaken the collabor-
ation among these core TFs, and thus impair the overall
expression of self-renewal genes but without much effect on
the expression of the core TFs such as Oct4, Sox2 and
Nanog. As a cMyc group TF, the role of fo in co-regulation
between Oct4 group factors, Nanog, Sox2 and Stat3 (Fig. 4b),
is particularly interesting. We extracted target genes of the co-
bound regions of Nanog, fo and Stat3 and those of Sox2, fo
and Stat3. Hereafter, the target gene is deﬁned as the nearest
gene to a binding region if the region is within —10 to 2kb
relative to the transcription start site of the gene. The top three
signiﬁcant gene ontology (GO) terms (Gene Ontology
Consortium, 2000) enriched in this set of target genes, com-
pared against all mouse genes, are methylation-dependent
chromatin silencing (P = 4.8 x 10—5), single-organism develop-
mental process (P : 3.2 x 10—4) and covalent chromatin modi-
ﬁcation (P = 3.8 x 10—4). The signiﬁcance level of a GO term
was calculated by the online GO tool at go.princeton.edu. As a
comparison, the target genes co-bound by Nanog and Stat3 or
co-bound by Sox2 and Stat3, but lacking fo binding in the
nearby 5kb regions, are mostly enriched for genes relevant to
metabolic processes. This suggests that clusters of Oct4 group
binding sites with fo binding may regulate genes responsible
for chromatin modiﬁcations, another possible means by which
fo may promote self-renewal in ESCs.

Second, Nr5a2, a nuclear receptor critical in regulating the
expression of Oct4 (Gu et al., 2005), is a CD co-regulator of
six core factors given Stat3 binding is present (Fig. 4c). It has
been reported recently that Nr5a2 can replace Oct4 in the deriv-
ation of iPSCs from mouse somatic cells, and genome-wide bind-
ing data showed that Nr5a2 colocalizes with the Oct4 group TFs,
such as Oct4, Sox2, Nanog and Esrrb (Heng et al., 2010). Our
analysis further revealed that when Stat3 sites are present, the
colocalization of Nr5a2 and the aforementioned Oct4 group TFs
becomes stronger. As Stat3 is downstream of the LIF pathway,
this result highlights the role of the interplay between the LIF
pathway and the core regulatory circuit. For every pair of TFs, X
and Y (Stat3), in Figure 4c, we extracted their co-bound regions
that contain Nr5a2 peaks and those that lack Nr5a2 peaks in the

5 kb neighborhood. Interestingly, the co-bound regions with
Nr5a2 peaks have a much higher percentage of target genes rele-
vant to developmental processes (36%) than those co-bound re-
gions lacking Nr5a2 binding (27%). Because the only difference
between the two sets of regions is the presence or absence of
Nr5a2 sites, this comparison provides another piece of evidence
for the collaborative role of Nr5a2 in regulating developmental
genes.

2.5 Predicted CD co-regulators

Now we turn to the top predicted CD co-regulators ranked by
the permutation P—values of their LA scores. Reported in Table 3
are the ones with P—value 3 10—5, together with the core TFs X
they work with and the TFs Y that deﬁne the context. Many of
the top CD co-regulators are themselves core regulators, such as
Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, Esrrb, E2fl or their close family members or
protein-interaction partners, including Sox4, Statl, chcp2,
pr238 and dep1 (which forms a dimer with E2fl). This con-
ﬁrms the reliability of our prediction given the high validation
rate among the core TFs. At least three stem cell—related GO
terms are enriched among these top co-regulators: stem cell
maintenance (P = 5.9 x 10—5), stem cell development
(P = 5.9 x 10—5) and stem cell differentiation (P = 2.9 x 10—4).
The enrichment was calculated against the set of all mouse TFs
that have a PWM in TRANSFAC, as our co-regulators were
predicted from this background set. The enrichment level of
these three GO terms is at least 2- to 3-folds higher than the
background set. Together with the many core TFs predicted in
the top list, this validates the functional relevance of our pre-
dicted co-regulators. Besides those associated with the three men-
tioned GO terms, some predicted co-regulators have been
reported recently in the literature on their regulatory roles in
ESCs or early differentiation. We selectively discuss a few of
them, which are most relevant to this study.

Grskovic et al. (2007) established that the main role of the TF
ny is to maintain the high proliferative capacity of ESCs. This
factor is a trimer composed of three subunits, nya, nyb and
nyc, two of which are top co-regulators in our prediction. Using
a competition assay (Ivanova et al., 2006), Grskovic et a].
observed that ESCs infected with nya or nyb short hairpin
RNAs showed a lower growth rate and were selectively out-
competed by wild-type cells. More recently, Dolﬁni et al.
(2012) demonstrated the activation role of ny on key ESC regu-
latory genes, including Sox2, Oct4, Nanog, Klf4, Sall4 and
J arid2, by using dominant negative mutant and transduced over-
expression of nya, which encodes the DNA-binding subunit of
the TF. They also conﬁrmed that ny binds the promoters of
these genes. By comparing ChIP-Seq data of nya (Tiwari et al.,
2011) and those of the core regulators in ESCs (Chen et al.,
2008), signiﬁcant co-occupancy of promoters was observed be-
tween this TF and Oct4, Stat3 and Nanog with P—values on the
order of 10—12, 10—7 and 10—50, respectively [Fig. 5A in Dolﬁni
et al. (2012)]. Our method further predicted a signiﬁcant collab-
oration between ny and a few key regulators, Oct4, Stat3 (Table
3) and Nanog (LA P = 2 x 10—5, Supplemental Table S1), when
cMyc (or Oct4) binding is absent. In light of the switcher role of
cMyc discussed above (Fig. 4a), our prediction suggests that ny

is a coherent component of the core regulatory circuit that regu-
lates pluripotent genes in ESCs.

We see a clear enrichment of nuclear receptors, Esrrb (Nr3b2),
Nr2f2, Ar (Nr3c4) and era (Nr2b1), in this top list of predicted
co-regulators. As mentioned above, another nuclear receptor
Nr5a2 is a prominent co-regulator identiﬁed in the core co-regu—
latory network (Fig. 4c). Because Daxl (NrObl) forms a complex
with Nr5a2 and is recruited to the binding sites of Nr5a2 (Kelly
et al., 2010), it is possible that the prominent co-regulatory role
of Nr5a2 comes partly from the involvement of Daxl, a protein-
interaction partner of Nanog (\Nang et al., 2006). Moreover,
another predicted co-regulator, Trp53, is upregulated by both
Nr5a2 and Daxl in mouse ESCs (Kelly et al., 2010). This long
list of nuclear receptors in our prediction is in line with the many
recent studies that establish the regulatory role of Esrrb, Nr5a2
and Daxl on the expression and activity of key TFs such as
Oct4, Nanog or Klf4, and vice versa. See Jeong and
Mangelsdorf (2009) for a review. Three nuclear receptors,
Nr2f2, Ar and era, have not been implicated in mouse ESCs,
although some of them have established roles in the differenti-
ation of adult mesenchymal stem cells and neural stem cells
(J eong and Mangelsdorf, 2009). Interestingly, these three factors
are predicted as co-regulators of Smadl or Stat3, which are re-
spective downstream factors of the BMP and the LIF signaling
pathways. This result suggests possible interactions between
these nuclear receptors and the two pathways that are central
to the maintenance of a pluripotential stem cell phenotype.

We predicted 20 CD co-regulators of Stat3 when Oct4 binding
is absent, a much larger number than those of the other pairs in
Table 3. All these co-regulator genes have the most signiﬁcant
LA scores, but some of them have no established functions in
ESCs. How Stat3 interacts with these potential co-regulators
awaits future experimental clariﬁcations.

3 DISCUSSION

We used a computational method to predict CD co-regulators
based on ChIP-Seq data of two TFs and gene expression data.
This method can be applied to many available ChIP-Seq and
gene expression data, and is able to decode complex combina-
torial regulation among multiple regulators. Our application to
mouse ESC data demonstrated the novel biological insights that
can be generated by this method. In particular, we constructed a
reliable CD co-regulation network among 14 core TFs in mouse
ESCs and identiﬁed a list of novel co-regulators for future
investigation.

A few lines of future work may further widen the application
of our approach. It is tempting to detect co-regulators under
more complex binding context, say, deﬁned by the combinatorial
binding of three or more TFs. However, an efﬁcient way to
identify a small set of most relevant binding contexts is crucial,
as a naive comparison among all combinatorial binding regions
will be prohibitive computationally. Therefore, a principled stat-
istical method to detect combinatorial binding regions from
ChIP-Seq data of multiple (potentially a large collection of)
TFs is highly desired. Generalization of CMF to an efﬁcient
tool that ﬁnds differentially enriched motifs by comparing mul-
tiple sets of sequences is another necessary step. It is also inter-
esting to study the relation between epigenetic factors and CD
binding of TFs.

4 METHODS

4.1 Preprocessing of ChIP-Seq data

Genomic coordinates of ChIP-Seq peaks of the 12 TFs in Chen et a].
(2008) were downloaded from their supplemental materials. For ch3 and
Nr5a2, we used the coordinates provided by the database thhIP (Chen
et al., 2011). For each TF, we expanded 200 bp on both sides of a peak

and recursively merged overlapping expanded peaks. Then, we con-
structed two sets of sequences for an ordered pair X and Y using two
stringent distance cutoffs. Peaks (after the above preprocessing) of X that
lack Ypeaks within 5 kb were used to construct S A y. On the other hand,
we recursively merged two peaks if their distance is <50 bp and if the
merged region contains at least one peak from each of the two TFs. The
merged regions are deﬁned as the co-bound sequence set S Xy, which is
identical to SYX. Then the DNA sequence of a binding region was
extracted by the software CisGenome (Ji et at, 2008).

4.2 Matching motifs to known PWMs

We ﬁrst retrieved the consensus pattern from a PWM. The dominating
nucleotide of a position is deﬁned as the consensus if it has at least 50%
of the observed counts; otherwise the consensus of this position is deﬁned
as an ‘N’. We discarded a PWM if its consensus sequence contains more
than two ‘N’s in every subsequence of length seven. The (length-seven)
subsequence of which the dominating nucleotides have the highest total
percentage of counts is deﬁned as the consensus pattern. Then we calcu-
lated the number of matches between the consensus pattern of a PWM in
TRANSFAC and every sliding window of length seven along a PF motif.
If there are at least ﬁve matches (excluding ‘N’) in a sliding window, then
we say that the motif matches the PWM.

4.3 Liquid association

LA is a generalized notion of association for describing certain kind of
ternary relationship among variables. Suppose that X, Y and Z are three
random variables with mean zero and unit variance. Let g(Y) = E(XZ| Y)
be the conditional correlation between X and Z given Y. The LA of X
and Z with respect to Y is deﬁned by

LA(X,ZI Y) = EIg’(Y)] (2)

which measures the average rate of change in the conditional correlation.
By Stein’s Lemma, if Y is normally distributed,

Elg’(Y)] = E[g(Y)Y] = E[E(XZYI Y)] = E(XZY), (3)

which leads to the estimation (1) when we have observations x, y, z for the
three random variables.

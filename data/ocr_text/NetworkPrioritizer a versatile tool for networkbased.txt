ABSTRACT

Summary: The prioritization of candidate disease genes is often
based on integrated datasets and their network representation with
genes as nodes connected by edges for biological relationships.
However, the majority of prioritization methods does not allow for a
straightfonivard integration of the user’s own input data. Therefore, we
developed the Cytoscape plugin NetworkPrioritizer that particularly
supports the integrative network-based prioritization of candidate dis-
ease genes or other molecules. Our versatile software tool computes a
number of important centrality measures to rank nodes based on their
relevance for network connectivity and provides different methods to
aggregate and compare rankings.

1 INTRODUCTION

An important objective of medical bioinformatics is to elucidate
the genetic foundations of human diseases. To this end, it is
crucial to identify genes that might predispose to or cause speciﬁc
diseases. To rank candidate genes, e.g. from some genome-wide
association study, according to their disease relevance, the exist-
ing plethora of computational prioritization methods exploits the
available biomedical knowledge. Many methods combine mul-
tiple genotypic and phenotypic data sources, e. g. gene expression,
protein interactions and overlapping disease characteristics
(Doncheva et al., 2012a). Integrated information of biological
and molecular relationships and interactions is naturally repre-
sented as networks. The biological connections between known
disease genes and the remaining genes in a network are of par-
ticular interest, as they can point to new disease genes according
to the guilt-by—association principle.

The majority of prioritization methods are available only as
web services (Tranchevent et al., 2010). Since these require the
upload of the user’s input data, they do not allow for the analysis
of conﬁdential data. Furthermore, most web services rely on pre-
deﬁned background data. For example, GeneWanderer ranks
candidate genes based on their distance to disease genes in a
pre-deﬁned protein—protein interaction network. GeneDistiller
and ENDEAVOUR combine multiple data sources, but do not

allow the user to include own data. Additionally, the rank ag-
gregation used by ENDEAVOUR cannot be modiﬁed by the
user. Existing Cytoscape plugins for prioritization tasks are
also subject to major limitations. The plugin iCTNet Wang
et al., 2011) queries only a speciﬁc database to construct net-
works, but a straightforward integration of own data is not pos-
sible. The plugins cytoHubba (Lin et al., 2008) and GPEC
(Le and Kwon, 2012) rank network nodes using their close
neighborhood and random walks in the network, respectively.
However, neither one supports multiple rankings or further ana-
lysis of the rankings. The plugin NetworkAnalyzer (Assenov
et al., 2008; Doncheva et al., 2012b) and the Java application
CentiBiN (Junker et al., 2006) feature a large set of centrality
measures, but they cannot compute the measures for a user-
deﬁned set of seed nodes or for weighted networks.

Here, we present NetworkPrioritizer, a novel Cytoscape plugin
for the integrative network-based prioritization of candidate
genes or other molecules. It comprises two main functionalities.
First, it facilitates the estimation of the relevance of network
nodes, e.g. candidate genes, with regard to a set of seed nodes,
e. g. known disease genes. Second, our plugin allows for the user-
guided aggregation and comparison of multiple node rankings
derived according to different relevance measures. Users can
supply their own data and tailor the network analysis as well
as the rank aggregation to their needs.

2 SOFTWARE FEATURES

2.1 Relevance measures and ranking

NetworkPrioritizer can rank nodes in any user-imported
Cytoscape network. Each ranking is based on the relevance of
nodes for the network connectivity. This relevance is estimated
by a number of centrality measures such as shortest path
betweenness, shortest path closeness, random walk betweenness,
random walk receiver closeness and random walk transmitter
closeness (Borgatti, 2005) (see web site). Closeness quantiﬁes
the path distance between a node and the rest of the network.
Betweenness measures the inﬂuence of a node on the network
paths connecting other nodes. Since these measures are applic-
able only to undirected networks, the edge directions are ignored
in directed networks.

NetworkPrioritizer can handle unweighted and weighted net-
works with user-adjustable effect of the edge weights on the
computed centralities (Opsahl et al., 2010) (Fig. 1a). A particular
feature of NetworkPrioritizer is the computation of the centrality

(a) In the Preferences dialog, the user can adjust settings for the network
analysis and for the rank aggregation. at) The Ranking Manager allows
to inspect, compare, aggregate, export and import rankings

measures for a set of seed nodes, which can be imported from a
text ﬁle or selected in the network View.

2.2 Rank aggregation

The Ranking Manager of NetworkPrioritizer provides different
methods to aggregate and compare multiple rankings (Fig. 1b).
In this context, the rankings to aggregate are called primary
rankings.

Weighted Borda Fuse (WBF) is a generalization of the popu-
lar Borda count aggregation method (Saari, 1999), which works
as follows: In primary rankings, each node receives a score that is
equal to the number of nodes ranked lower in the respective
primary ranking. In the aggregated ranking, the nodes are
ranked according to the sum of their sores. WBF also allows
weighing the contribution of each primary ranking to the aggre-
gated score.

Weighted AddScore Fuse WVASF) calculates the weighted
sum of scores for each node in the primary rankings and
awards a higher rank the larger this sum is. Since both WBF
and WASF are consensus-based aggregation methods, they can
be used to identify candidate genes that attain high ranks in all
primary rankings. If the primary rankings are based on compar-
able scores, i.e. scores on similar scales, WASF is more distinct-
ive and thus more accurate than WBF.

MaxRank Fuse performs aggregation by assigning each node
the highest rank achieved in any primary ranking. Thus, a can-
didate with a high rank in a single primary ranking obtains a
high rank in the aggregation.

Rank aggregation can result in ties if two or more nodes
receive the same rank. NetworkPrioritizer can leave ties unre-
solved or break them arbitrarily.

Furthermore, the Ranking Manager provides two common
measures of ranking distance, the Spearman footrule and the
Kendall tau (Dwork et al., 2001). The Spearman footrule is the
sum, over all nodes, of the difference between the ranks of a node
in two compared rankings. The Kendall tau distance between
two rankings is the number of nodes with different ranks.

Rank lists and rank list distances can be imported from, or
exported to, plain text ﬁles for further analysis (see web site for
ﬁle format details).

2.3 Batch functionality

To facilitate the prioritization of nodes in multiple networks,
NetworkPrioritizer provides batch functionality. First,
NetworkPrioritizer computes all centrality measures for each
network and saves the resulting primary rankings to plain text
ﬁles. Second, the primary rankings are re-imported and aggre-
gated for each network separately.

3 CASE STU DY

A network of both protein—protein interactions and functional
similarity links was compiled from BioMyn (Ramirez et al.,
2012) and FunSimMat (Schlicker et al., 2010), respectively, for
proteins encoded by genes in genomic loci associated with
Crohn’s disease (Franke et al., 2010). Proteins associated with
inﬂammatory bowel disease (IBD), or Crohn’s disease as a sub-
type of IBD, were used as seed nodes for the network analysis
(see web site). The 10 top-ranked proteins function in the
‘immune system process’, ‘response to stress’, ‘signal transduc-
tion’ and ‘homeostatic process’ according to their Gene
Ontology annotation. Since these processes are closely related
to IBD (Zhu and Li, 2012), the proteins are promising candidates
for further experimental studies.

4 CONCLUSIONS

NetworkPrioritizer is a versatile Cytoscape plugin that enables
the ranking of individual network nodes based on their relevance
for connecting a set of seed nodes to the rest of the network. The
plugin computes centrality measures for unweighted and
weighted networks and provides rank aggregation methods and
ranking distance calculations. With its modular and extensible
software design, NetworkPrioritizer is a very useful tool for in-
tegrative network-based prioritization of, e.g. candidate disease
genes.

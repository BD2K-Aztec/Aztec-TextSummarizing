ABSTRACT

Motivation: Sharing genomic data is crucial to support scientific in-
vestigation such as genome-wide association studies. However,
recent investigations suggest the privacy of the individual participants
in these studies can be compromised, leading to serious concerns and
consequences, such as overly restricted access to data.

Results: We introduce a novel cryptographic strategy to securely per-
form meta-analysis for genetic association studies in large consortia.
Our methodology is useful for supporting joint studies among dispar-
ate data sites, where privacy or confidentiality is of concern. We val-
idate our method using three multisite association studies. Our
research shows that genetic associations can be analyzed efficiently
and accurately across substudy sites, without leaking information on
individual participants and site-level association summaries.
Availability and implementation: Our software for secure meta-
analysis of genetic association studies, SecureMA, is publicly available
at http://github.com/XieConnect/SecureMA. Our customized secure
computation framework is also publicly available at http://github.

1 INTRODUCTION

Decreasing costs in sequencing technologies, in combination with
large repositories of clinical information, has enabled the discov-
ery of novel associations between genetic variants and disease.
These achievements are facilitated by increased collection and
reuse of genomic data (Green and Guyer, 2011), as well as
broad efforts to obtain larger sample sizes (by sharing and comb-
ing data) for increased statistical power (Panagiotou et al., 2013).
Meta-analysis is a common solution for aggregating substudy
results across large consortia to achieve this goal. In fact,
meta-analysis is responsible for ~37% of the 15845 genome-
trait associations listed in the NHGRI genome-wide association
studies (GWAS) Catalog Welter et al., 2014). At the same time,

the sensitive nature of genomic data has led to numerous discus-
sions around the governance of genomic records (Fullerton et al.,
2010; Kaye et al., 2009). Currently, policy and advisory groups
recommend removing identifying information (e.g. personal
names) to uphold the privacy of study participants (Lowrance
and Collins, 2007; Presidential Commission for the Study of
Bioethical Issues, 2012).

Yet, the efficacy of such protections is increasingly being ques-
tioned (Rodriguez et al., 2013). Various studies demonstrate that
the identity of participants, as well as sensitive information (such
as disease status) can still be inferred from the shared genomic
data (Gymrek et al., 2013; Homer et al., 2008; Humbert et al.,
2013; Im at al., 2012; Jacobs et al., 2009; Lin et al., 2004;
Sankararaman et al., 2009). This can occur by leveraging an
individual’s genome sequence or the study summary statistics
about associations, such as genotype frequencies and allelic re-
gression coefﬁcients that would be used in meta-analysis. Most
recently, it was shown that an individual’s identity could be as-
certained through Y-chromosome short tandem repeats
(Y—STRs) using public genealogy databases on the internet
(Gymrek et al., 2013). While certain privacy attacks may seem
non-trivial in the knowledge necessary to be executed, they have
already raised serious concerns from scientists, policy makers
and the general public. They have also led to reduced sharing
of genome sequences and site-level summary statistics. For in-
stance, based on (Homer et al., 2008), the NIH and Wellcome
Trust stopped sharing aggregate genomic data directly to the
public (Zerhouni and Nabel, 2008). These demonstrations have
also inﬂuenced proposed regulations [e.g., (European
Commission, 2012, 2014)], some of which would designate all
biospecimens and their derived data as identiﬁable (US.
Department H.H.S., 2011).

To address the privacy concerns on individual genomic infor-
mation as well as site-level summary statistics, we engineered a
practical protocol to securely perform meta-analysis for geno-
type—phenotype association studies across substudy sites in
large consortia (Fig. 1). Our protocol leverages cryptographically
secure technology to provide provable security guarantees.
Unlike alternative proposals (Kamm et al., 2013), in our proto-
col, substudy sites retain full control of their respective individual
participants’ data and local site analyses. This allows each site to
make appropriate adjustments to effect estimates to account for

securely divide the numerator by the denominator of the meta-analysis
function. (c) The results of the meta-analysis are partially decrypted by
the data managers, which are composed into the ﬁnal full decryption of

study-specific differences in design, which is pervasive in multisite
studies but not supported in (Kamm et al., 2013). Our protocol
also allows sites to contribute to meta-analysis without exposing
site-level summary statistics. Such comprehensive protections
make our protocol impervious to popular privacy attacks over
genomic data at both the individual and site level.

In this article, we demonstrate the design and implementation
of our secure meta-analysis protocol (called SecureMA), and
provide empirical evaluations with three separate multisite gen-
etic association studies.

2 SYSTEM

2.1 Secure meta-analysis protocol

The SecureMA protocol consists of two main steps: (1) Setup
and (2) Secure Computation. The Setup initializes the system by
(i) generating and distributing the encryption/decryption keys,
(ii) encrypting association statistics locally at each study site
and (iii) submitting the data encryptions to the data managers
(e.g. coordination centers in practice). The Secure Computation
step securely performs meta-analysis over the encrypted submis-
sions of site-level association statistics (Fig. l).

2.2 Setup step of the protocol

To setup the process, a one-time step for generating and disse-
minating the encryption/decryption keys is coordinated by a
trusted authority who is not involved in any data management
or computations (Supplementary Fig. S1; Following standard
practice in security for cryptographic systems, this authority gen-
erates keys and has no further interaction with any of the par-
ticipants involved in SecureMA). For protection purposes, the
decryption key is then split into multiple shares and distributed
across the participants of the protocol, as described below. By
doing so, to successfully decrypt data, collaboration is required
between the majority of key holders. As detailed in
Supplementary Section S5.l, the splitting of the key enforces
an ‘honest—majority’ to mitigate collusion for illicit decryption.

Optionally, to make the protocol more practical, several inter-
mediate parties, which we call data managers, can be set up to
host the (encrypted aggregate) data on behalf of the local sites.
Following this scheme, the local sites submit encryptions of their
study summary statistics (e.g. effect size and the inverse of its
variance) to their entrusted data managers and can then go off-
line. In doing so, one manager can coordinate for several local
sites, such that only a limited number of online participants are
required for the protocol to proceed. And, as mentioned, enfor-
cing an honest majority ensures no manager alone can decrypt
the data. Further details on this a management model can be
found in Supplementary Section S5.l.

2.3 Secure computation step of the protocol

When a scientist issues a study inquiry to the system, encryptions
of site-level association statistics are requested from the data
managers and then provided to a third party responsible for
coordination and computation—the Mediator—who securely
sums the encrypted submissions (Fig. la).

Next, the mediator coordinates with one randomly selected
data manager to perform a secure division to derive the weighted
average, the last operation of meta-analysis (Fig. lb; details in
Section 3.1).

At this point, the meta-analysis result is still in an encrypted
state. The mediator is then responsible for initiating a final round
of collaborative decryption by distributing the encrypted result
to a majority of the trusted data managers for partial decryption
(Fig. lc). By collecting a sufficient number of the partially de-
crypted shares from the data managers, the scientist combines
them to reveal the final decryption from which the final result of
his/her study query would be derived. Thus, until the scientist
requests the final decryption, no individual or site-level aggregate
information is ever disclosed because all information remains
encrypted throughout the protocol.

A complete activity diagram of the SecureMA protocol is
provided in Supplementary Figure S2.

3 METHODS

3.1 Meta-analysis

Meta-analysis (Hedges and Olkin, 1985) is a statistical technique widely
used in genetic association studies for synthesizing study results from
across consortia to obtain larger sample sizes and gain statistical
power. In this work, we focus on the ﬁxed-effects model to perform

meta-analysis (W iller et al., 2010), which yields a weighted average of the
effect size (e.g. beta coefﬁcient) using the inverse of its variance as the

weight:
_ _Z.-Wi / 1 _Z , r—Z.
Z—IB/Se— Ziwi / Ziwi— i IBin/ 1' W“ (1)

where ,8 is the aggregated effect size, 56 is the aggregated standard error,
,8,- is the effect size of an association for the i—th substudy (i.e. site con-
tributing data to the meta-analysis), weight w,- = 1 /se,2 and 56,- corresponds
to the standard error of the effect for the ith substudy.

 

3.2 Secure computation of meta-analysis

To enable direct computation in a cryptographic setting, we square
Equation (1) (i.e. Z2; Supplementary Section S5.4). The ﬁnal square
root and conversion from Z—score to P-value is performed by software
running on the computer of the scientist who issued the meta-analysis
request.

For reference, the core (secure) computations for the proposed
SecureMA protocol are summarized in Table 1. For each meta-analysis
study, the mediator requests and receives encryptions of site-level associ-
ation summaries [denoted as E(,B,-w,), E(w,)] from the data managers.
Then, the mediator leverages the secure summation subprotocol (denoted
as ADD, see Supplementary Section S5.4) to compute the sums in the
numerator and denominator of Equation (1) without decryption (result-

ing in encryptions: E(Z ,Biwi) and E(Z w,)).

The ﬁnal step of meta-analysis involves a division operation (for deriv-
ing the weighted average of effect size), where in our case, both the nu-
merator and the denominator are encrypted. There is no efﬁcient method
for directly computing the division of two encryptions. Thus, we convert
it into a subtraction problem, which is easier to implement in cryptog-
raphy, by applying a logarithmic transformation on the squared
Equation (1) (e.g. Z2):

ln 22 = 2ln 2 my, — ln 2 w,- (2)

The logarithmic transformation, In x (where x is encrypted), is approxi-
mated using secure computation techniques and a Taylor series
(Supplementary Section S5.5). The result from this step is still in an en-
crypted form.

Next, secure subprotocols for multiplication-by—constant and subtrac-
tion (e.g. deﬁned as M ULC and SUB subprotocols in Supplementary
Section S5.4) are used to complete the rest of the operations in
Equation (2), yielding encryption E(ln Z2). The ﬁnal Z2 can be obtained

4 IMPLEMENTATION AND RESULTS

We implemented the SecureMA protocol in working software
and released it open source. To demonstrate its feasibility and
practicality, we reproduced three multisite genetic association
meta-analyses. For the purposes of evaluation, we focus on the
efﬁcacy of protecting participant privacy, the computational ac-
curacy, the running time efﬁciency and the sensitivity to certain
protocol parameterizations.

4.1 Study data

The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) hypo-
thyroidism study. The ﬁrst collection of datasets is from a GWAS
on hypothyroidism provided by the eMERGE consortia (Denny
et al., 2011). It consists of 6370 study participants across ﬁve
study sites, and for evaluation, we analyzed 100 single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs)—these include the 16 statistically signiﬁ-
cant SNPs (P<10_6) reported in their original study and an
additional 84 random SNPs for running time efﬁciency analysis
(Supplementary Section S3).

The Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology
(PAGE) obesity study. The second collection of datasets is from a
genetic association study on obesity and body mass index pro-
vided by the PAGE consortia (Fesinmeyer et al., 2013). It con-
sists of 53 238 participants across six study sites, and for
evaluation, we analyzed 40 SNPs—these include the 25 statistic-
ally signiﬁcant SNPs (P<0.05) as identiﬁed by their original
study, and an additional 15 SNPs (Supplementary Section S3).

The Epidemiologic Architecture for Genes Linked to
Environment (EAGLE) diabetes study. The third collection of
datasets is from a genetic association study on Type II
Diabetes provided by the EAGLE group (Haiman et al., 2012).
It contains 14998 participants across two substudies, and we
analyzed 216 SNPs. The published study did not report P-
values for all SNPs, and thus, for comparison, we only focus
on a controlled benchmark using the standard non-secure
meta-analysis as the baseline (reported in Supplementary
Section S4) and running time analysis.

4.2 Protection of sensitive information

Throughout the SecureMA protocol, the privacy of the genomic
records of the individual participants is ensured. This is because
the records are maintained solely at their respective local sites
and are never disclosed. This resolves privacy concerns over in-
dividual genome sequences [e.g. no risk of unique identiﬁability
based on the uniqueness of SNPs as posed by (Lin et al., 2004)].

Moreover, site-level summaries (e.g. association study statis-
tics of each local site) are protected Via strong encryption
throughout the process. And the ﬁnal meta-analysis results (lim-
ited to aggregate P-Values only) are only made known to the
inquiry issuer. Such protections make it impossible to perform
inference attacks based on group statistics or allele frequencies or
regression coefﬁcients; which are features relied on in various
attacks; e.g. (Homer et al., 2008; Im at al., 2012; Jacobs et al.,
2009; Sankararaman et al., 2009).

4.3 Accuracy of association results

We compared the accuracy of our secure computations with
those reported by the original studies associated with these data-
sets (Denny et al., 2011; Fesinmeyer et al., 2013; EAGLE is
excluded from comparison owing to lack of published P-Values
as baseline). These results are summarized as QQ-plots of the
SNP association P-Values on a negative logarithmic scale
(Fig. 2). The plots for the eMERGE and PAGE genotype—
phenotype summary statistics correspond to the 16 and 25
SNPs, respectively, that were reported as signiﬁcant in the pub-
lications. To compare the secure and non-secure estimates of the
P-Values, we applied a linear regression with the y—intercept
forced to zero. The Pearson correlation coefﬁcient was found
to be ~0.998 and ~l.000 for eMERGE and PAGE, respectively,
implying that the secure meta-analysis yielded results directly in
line with those in the original publications. The regression slopes
for the PAGE and eMERGE datasets were 1.001 and 0.952 re-
spectively, and in both cases the rank order of the signiﬁcance of
the SNPs was retained. These results illustrate that the secure and
non-secure meta-analysis approaches produce highly consistent
results.

We noticed that certain original studies used different analysis
methods (e. g. pooled analysis instead of meta-analysis) and add-
itional data processing, which may introduce replication discrep-
ancy. We thus performed additional controlled experiments with
the standard non-secure meta-analysis as the baseline [i.e. we
used METAL software (Willer et al., 2010) to compute signiﬁ-
cance]. The results indicate our secure results are accurate, yield-
ing both a slope and correlation coefﬁcient of ~l.000 for all
datasets evaluated (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. S3).

Overall, these results demonstrate our secure protocol sup-
ports genetic association studies with high accuracy. Further de-
tails on how to achieve even greater accuracy can be found in the
sensitivity analysis (Section 4.5).

4.4 Running time efﬁciency

To evaluate the running time of the protocol, we performed a
series of experiments on a desktop computer (2.4 GHz dual-core,
4 GB memory) running Java 1.7. We simulated the different par-

 

 

experiments were performed without parallelization to mitigate
interference in the measurement of running time.

On average, the secure meta-analysis for most SNPs
completed in l.20—l.34s (SD 3 0.024 s) and no SNP required
more than 1.38 s (Table 2). In comparison with the eMERGE
and PAGE datasets, the EAGLE study consumed slightly more
time because of the fact that EAGLE consists of much larger
numeric values, which leads to longer processing time.

Sample size. It is important to recognize that the running time
of our protocol is weakly dependent on the number of study
participants in the study (i.e. sample sizes) because the secure
computations occur only on site-level summaries (Individual par-
ticipant records are used by sites only for their local analyses.
These are computed without encryption and, thus, the running
time is negligible when compared with secure computations).
This implies that our protocol can be efﬁcient even in studies
with large sample sizes, which is common for GWAS in large
consortia.

Number of sites. We also point out that the majority of the
computation time is dedicated to the secure division of the meta-
analysis (>99.9%), as opposed to other computations such as
secure summation (Table 2). This indicates the protocol is scal-
able to a large number of data-contributing sites. Speciﬁcally, the
division operation involves only the mediator and one other par-
ticipant, and thus its running time is not dependent on the
number of sites. While the running time of other computations
(e.g. secure summation) may increase linearly with the number of
sites, its overall running time (and increase) is negligible.

To demonstrate the scalability of our technology for large
consortia, we randomly selected sites from the eMERGE dataset

to simulate environments consisting of up to 100 data-contribut-
ing sites (e.g. data managers participating in the protocol). For
each setting, we computed a meta-analysis for 100 SNPs (Fig. 3).
We illustrate that even when the protocol is composed of 100
sites, the time to complete the computation is around 1.22 s,
which is approximately the same as the initial case studies.

4.5 Sensitivity analysis

The SecureMA protocol incorporates several tunable parameters
to allow users to tune the computational accuracy and running
time efﬁciency as necessary. These are introduced because neither
decimal values nor division over encryptions are directly sup-
ported in cryptographic protocols. Here, we demonstrate their
impact both theoretically and empirically (Supplementary
Section S5 provides further details on these tunable parameters).

4.5 .1 Parameters inﬂuencing protocol sensitivity There are three
primary parameters that inﬂuence the accuracy and running time
of the SecureMA protocol. These parameters were introduced
owing to a series of transformations and approximations to the
square of Equation (1).

The ﬁrst parameter corresponds to a scale-up factor 10“, where
the scale s is deﬁned a priori by protocol participants. This is
multiplied against every value submitted by the local sites. In
doing so, every value is converted from a decimal to an integer.

The next two parameters are associated with the approxima-
tion of secure division, which relies on the secure logarithmic
transformation [Equation (2)]. Brieﬂy, ln x can be approximated
as follows:

yln2X2Nk-lcm(2,...,k)
xee
2Nk - lcm(2, ...,k)

 

k . . 3)
_ ,_, _,)'lcm(2,...,k) (
2(1) 2% —,

' (“true + “randy
+ i=1

 

2Nk - lcm(2, .. . , k)

where integer y is a rough estimate of the exponent such that
2y % x, and additional terms such as 2“ and lcm(2, ...,k) are
for scaling purposes. The ﬁrst term on the right side of Equation
(3) obtains a rough estimate of ln x, while the second term reﬁnes
the previous approximation using a Taylor series.

Based on the above function, the second tunable parameter
corresponds to the maximum exponent (i.e. N, or the upper

bound of exponent estimate y) required to roughly estimate
ln x. And, the third tunable parameter corresponds to the
number of expansions (i.e. k) to perform in a Taylor series
when reﬁning the accuracy of approximating ln x.

For evaluation purposes, we randomly selected ﬁve signiﬁcant
and ﬁve non-signiﬁcant SNPs from the eMERGE dataset to
execute a series of secure meta-analyses.

4.5.2 Evaluation of the scale-up sactor As mentioned, the
scale-up factor 10“ is used to convert decimal values into integers.
Larger factors result in the truncation of a fewer number of
trailing digits and, thus, a smaller amount of information loss
during computation.

Figure 4 depicts how the computational error and the overall
running time, respectively, of the secure meta-analysis are inﬂu-
enced as the factor is varied from 104 to 1016. For context,
SecureMA uses a default value of 108.

In Figure 4a, it can be seen that, in general, the computational
error of the P-Value decreases (approaching 0) as the scale-up
factor increases. Overall, the absolute and relative errors are
always bounded within the range [—3.0 x10_5, 8.2 x 10—6]
and [—0.03, 0.01%], respectively. However, we note there are
several outlying points in the graph, such as at 106 and 109.
We note that these occur because, at times, the error of the
two logarithms in Equation (2) diverge in opposite directions,
which results in a magniﬁcation of the total error.

Nonetheless, in Figure 4b it can be seen that the variance of
the overall running time is relatively small as the scale-up factor
increases. This is an expected result because the change of the
scale-up factor has limited inﬂuence on the secure division opera-
tion, which is the most time-consuming process in the protocol.

4.5.3 Evaluation of the maximum exponent of the logarithm
approximation The secure logarithmic transformation (i.e. ln
x where x is encrypted) involves two phases to the approxima-
tion. The ﬁrst phase aims to ﬁnd an optimal integer exponent to
roughly estimate the number x. The maximum exponent we

exponent estimate. The second step corresponds to the applica-
tion of a Taylor series, which we discuss in further depth below.

Figure 5 shows how the computational error and the overall
running time, respectively of the secure meta-analysis (per SNP)
are affected as the exponent varies from 64 to 96. For context,
SecureMA uses a default value of 80.

It was expected that a larger exponent would yield better
approximation accuracy, with a trade-off in a longer running
time. It is conﬁrmed that the overall running time changes
almost linearly with the increase of the maximum exponent
(Fig. 5b). However, it can be seen that the computational accuracy
is almost identical across all test cases (Fig. 5a). This is because, in
this particular scenario, the other two protocol parameters are the
dominating factors regarding computational accuracy.

4.5.4 Evaluation of the number of steps in the taylor series A
Taylor series is applied in the second phase of the secure loga-
rithm subprotocol to boost the approximation accuracy.
Figure 6 shows how the computational error and the overall
running time, respectively, of the secure meta-analysis are
affected as the number of steps in the series varies from 6 to
12. For context, SecureMA uses a default value of 10.

Figure 6a illustrates that the more steps in the Taylor series,
the better the computational accuracy is on average. Figure 6b
further demonstrates that there is a slight linear increase in the
running time as the number of steps in the Taylor series grows.
This result stems from the fact that the number of terms required
to compute in secure computation is increasing, which causes a
longer running time.

5 DISCUSSION
5.1 Analysis on GWAS scale

As discussed earlier, one of the beneﬁts of the SecureMA proto-
col is that its running time has only a weak dependence on the
sample size. As a result, it can be efﬁcient for studies run over
large consortia. This is a notable improvement over alternative

cryptographic proposals [e.g., (Kamm et al., 2013; Kantarcioglu
et al., 2008)] whose running time is positively correlated, in a
linear and sometimes exponential manner, with the number of
study participants and sites.

At the same time, the SecureMA protocol can be made more
efﬁcient to support analysis on a genome-wide scale. First, the
SecureMA protocol can easily be run in parallel on large com-
puter clusters or cloud computing servers because each SNP can
be analyzed independently. Thus, the total computation time for
a large-scale GWAS would be inversely proportional to the com-
puting resources allocated. As a rough estimate, a GWAS on
2000 000 SNPs would require around 10 h on 16 eight-core
computers without further optimization. Second, from a scienti-
ﬁc perspective, it might be permissible to disclose the aggregate
effect size of meta-analysis [i.e., the numerator in Equation (1)].
In such a scenario, the time-consuming secure division operation
could be avoided entirely, reducing the overall running time per
SNP to milliseconds. Third, recent advances in the optimization
of secure computations [e.g., (Asharov et al., 2013; Henecka et a],
2013)] may be ready to transition into practice in the near future.
This could allow for certain SecureMA subprotocols, such as
secure division, to be run on parallel computing frameworks
and make signiﬁcant gains in efﬁciency.

5.2 Limitations

There are several limitations to the SecureMA protocol as cur-
rently designed. First, SecureMA assumes that study data have
already been carefully cleaned data and subject to rigorous qual-
ity control (QC) [e.g. deposited data in dbGaP (Mailman et al.,
2007)]. To support more dirty data in the wild, it will be neces-
sary to embed QC processes for meta-analysis in the protocol
(\Ninkler et al., 2014). Certain procedures may be vulnerable to
attacks on privacy, but those which are based on standard alge-
braic computations should be translatable into secure computa-
tions. At the same time, it should be noted that many procedures
can be directly applied in the clear because they do not violate
privacy [e.g., ﬁle-level QC and SE-N plots in (\Ninkler et al.,
2014)]. As QC is a relatively independent and large pipeline,
we leave it for future work. Second, the current SecureMA imple-
mentation relies on a trusted authority to generate cryptographic
keys, which sometimes may not be desirable (alternative solu-
tions are in Supplementary Section S1). Third, in situations
when individual-level genomic records need to be processed, it
will be necessary to pair secure data management technologies
with effective societal controls (e.g. use agreements and man-
dated limits on investigator behavior) that deter misuse and
limit the extent to which genomic information can be abused
and cause harm to people [e.g. expansion of laws to prevent
utilization of genomic data in life insurance eligibility and sup-
port for long term care (Altman et al., 2013)].

5.3 Alternative methods to maintain genomic privacy

To provide context for the contributions of the SecureMA pro-
tocol, we take a moment to review other recent developments in
the ﬁeld. There are generally two categories of data protection
mechanisms that have been proposed to maintain participant
privacy while supporting scientiﬁc investigations on genomic
data. From a societal and regulatory perspective, it has been

W.Xie et al.

 

suggested that research participants consent to the risk of being
reidentiﬁed (Lunshof et al., 2008; which may bias participant
recruitment), while users of such data contractually agree not
to attempt to reidentify the participants (Taylor, 2008). We
believe such mechanisms can lower risk and, while data use
agreements assign liability, they do not provide any technological
deterrent and can only be enforced when violations could be
detected.

On the other hand, various technological techniques have been
proposed to promise genomic privacy. These include encrypting
genomic sequences and supporting simple queries (Kantarcioglu
et al., 2008), obfuscating raw (short) genome sequences and
allowing for retrieval (Ayday et al., 2014), splitting regression
analyses into local-site computations and center-level aggrega-
tion (Wolfson et al., 2010) and hosting participant-level genomic
data using a cryptographic technique and facilitating genetic
association studies (Kamm et al., 2013). The two approaches
most similar to ours are hampered by practical limitations.
First, Wolfson et al. (2010) may leak sensitive information
because local sites inappropriately disclose intermediate sum-
mary statistics during computation (Emam et al., 2013); The
other recent proposal (Kamm et al., 2013) fails to account for
site-speciﬁc covariates and other data preprocessing within sites,
which is a common practice for multisite genetic association
studies. Their solution may also suffer from computational scal-
ability and network trafﬁcking issues in studies with large sample
sizes because all individual genomic data must pass through, and
be analyzed by, every server.

5.4 Conclusion

This work illustrates that the privacy of individual participants,
and site-level summary statistics, in genetic association meta-ana-
lysis can be guaranteed without sacriﬁcing the ability to perform
analysis that use shared data. Our proposal, SecureMA, is useful
for running joint studies over disparate data sites in large
consortia, where privacy or conﬁdentiality is a concern. If appro-
priately implemented, our approach can prevent privacy intru-
sions posed by the attacks published to date. While there are
opportunities to make this protocol more efﬁcient and to incor-
porate quality control measures, we believe it is possible to
enable much broader analytic access to genomic data for the
purposes of effect estimation and statistical association via
meta-analysis.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: The need for new drugs and new targets is particularly
compelling in an era that is witnessing an alarming increase of drug
resistance in human pathogens. The identification of new targets of
known drugs is a promising approach, which has proven successful in
several cases. Here, we describe a database that includes information
on 5153 putative drug—target pairs for 150 human pathogens derived
from available drug—target crystallographic complexes.

Availability and implementation: The TiPs database is freely
available at http://biocomputing.it/tips.

1 INTRODUCTION

Novel mechanisms to escape therapy are constantly emerging
among human pathogen populations, and this clearly urges the
development, on one hand, of new drugs for the treatment of the
diseases and, on the other hand, of rapid and effective methods
to help expand the landscape of available treatment options
(Hopkins et al., 2011). In this context, computational studies
are called on to help identify novel therapeutic targets and char-
acterize their interactions, and indeed a number of such efforts
are described in the literature (Aguero et al., 2008; Kinnings
et al., 2010; Lepore et al., 2011; Orti et al., 2009). However,
these are mostly devoted to the analysis of single targets or
specific tropical disease pathogens.

The TiPs database has been developed with the aim of facilitat-
ing the identification of new therapeutic targets in >150 organisms
responsible for human infections. We performed a large-scale
analysis to systematically identify candidate targets in the prote-
omes of such organisms. The rationale of our approach is based
on the intrinsic polypharmacological behaviour of compounds
targeting homologous proteins (Paolini et al., 2006). We con-
sidered all drug—target pairs for which the 3D structure of the
complex is experimentally known and used the sequence of the
target to identify its homologues in human pathogens. The evo-
lutionary conservation of such homologues and their 3D struc-
tures (available or predicted) were used to verify whether the
original drug was in principle able to bind them as it does the
original target. To this aim, stringent filters were applied to ensure
that predicted binding sites and their interactions with the drug

are as accurate as possible. Pathogen proteins predicted with high
confidence to be therapeutic targets and the putative drugs inter-
acting with them were collected and annotated in TiPs.

2 METHODS

More than 400 human pathogen species were obtained from ‘The
Approved List of Biological Agents’ provided by the Advisory
Committee on Dangerous Pathogens. To unambiguously assign an iden-
tiﬁer (ID) to human pathogens, the names of the organisms were mapped
onto the NCBI Taxonomy Database records (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/Taxonomy/).

Drug compounds and information on their molecular targets were
obtained from DrugBank (http://www.drugbank.ca). The SMILE IDs of
drugs annotated either as ‘inhibitor’, ‘agonist’ or ‘antagonist’ were used to
associate them with ligands present in the PDB structure entries (Berman
et al., 2012). Only identical compounds were considered (Tanimoto coef-
ﬁcient = 1). A total of 308 distinct drugs were observed in complex with at
least one PDB structure. About 40% of these (119/308) occur in complex
with their actual pharmaceutical target. These were used as starting points
to predict potential drug targets in pathogens. The search for homologues
in pathogens was performed using BLAST+ (Camacho et al., 2009) with
default parameters against the nr database (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
blast/db/). We only retained highly reliable hits, i.e. those showing at
least 40% sequence identity to the original target and e—value<10_6.
Pathogen taxonomic IDs were retrieved by matching the gi numbers of
BLAST hits to the NCBI Taxonomy database.

For each known drug—target complex, we deﬁned the binding site as
the subset of target residues having at least one atom within 3.5A dis-
tance from any atom of the drug. The drug-binding site residues in the
predicted pathogen sequences were retrieved through a multiple sequence
alignment (MSA) of the original target sequence with its homologues
generated with T-coffee (Taly et al., 2011). The number and type of
aligned residues were used to classify the binding site local conservation,
both in terms of sequence coverage (percentage of binding site residues in
the original target that could be aligned to the pathogen sequence) and
identity (percentage of identical residues among the aligned binding site
residues). Coverage and identity percentages were calculated separately
for each pathogen sequence in the alignment. Only pathogen proteins
showing at least 80% coverage in their binding sites were further con-
sidered (4215). Among these 4215 reliable putative targets, only 41 have a
solved structure in the PDB. Homology modelling (Kopp and Schwede,
2004) was used to predict the structure of the remaining ones as follows:
for each pathogen sequence, an MSA was generated using three iterations
of HHblits (Remmert et al., 2012) (with default parameters) on the non-
redundant Uniprot database. The MSA was used as HHsearch query to
search for templates in the PDB70 database. We only selected templates
with at least 40% sequence identity (and e—value< 10—5) with the patho-
gen query sequence. If more than one template was found, the one with
the highest coverage to the pathogen sequence was selected. Models were

Fig. 1. The ﬁgure shows the results of ‘all pathogens’ ﬁltered by the
‘ATP binding’ GO term query in the TiPs database. The output table
lists all putative pathogen targets. Each table row reports the known
and predicted target UniProt IDs, their overall sequence identity, their
binding site identity and rmsd, whether there are clashes between the
known drug and the predicted target, and whether there are insertions
or deletions nearby the binding site in the alignment used to model the
protein. For each hit, the system also shows details of the structure(s) and
the binding site(s) in a Jmol window and the corresponding Ligplot
drawings

generated using the Modeller software. Note that the best template used
to build the model corresponds to the original structure in the drug—target
complex only in 153 cases, whereas in all the other cases, the best template
was a different structure.

The binding site residues of the original complex and of the predicted
target were structurally superimposed using the LGA software (Zemla,
2003). Subsequently, the ligands were transferred into the structure or
model of the pathogen proteins that could be successfully superimposed
<5A distance to the known target. Binding sites in the modelled struc-
tures were analysed for the occurrence of nearby insertions/deletions.
These cases are suitably highlighted in the TiPs database search output.
This allows users to analyse them to establish the likelihood that their
presence affects the conformation of the binding site.

3 RESULTS

TiPs currently contains 4071 candidate pathogen target struc-
tures involved in 5153 different drug—target complexes in
150 pathogens. All entries are thoroughly annotated with

both sequence and functional information. The database can
be queried by organism name (genus or specie name), protein
family or function (EC number, GO terms and Pfam), as well as
UniProt ID. The query returns a sortable table providing infor-
mation about both known and predicted drug—target pairs and
links to visualize speciﬁc information on the drug(s) (physico-
chemical properties, structure, indication and side effects),
the target(s) [UniProt annotation and PDB structure(s)] and to
visually analyse or download their 3D complexes. Ligplot
(Laskowski and Swindells, 2011) drawings of both the known
and inferred binding sites in complex with the drug are available
as well (Fig. 1).

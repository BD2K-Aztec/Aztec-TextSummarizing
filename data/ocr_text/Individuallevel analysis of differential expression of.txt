ABSTRACT

Motivation: The differential expression analysis focusing on inter-
group comparison can capture only differentially expressed genes
(DE genes) at the population level, which may mask the heterogeneity
of differential expression in individuals. Thus, to provide patient-
specific information for personalized medicine, it is necessary to
conduct differential expression analysis at the individual level.
Results: We proposed a method to detect DE genes in individual
disease samples by using the disrupted ordering in individual disease
samples. In both simulated data and real paired cancer-normal
sample data, this method showed excellent performance. It was
found to be insensitive to experimental batch effects and data normal-
ization. The landscape of stable gene pairs in a particular type of
normal tissue could be predetermined using previously accumulated
data, based on which dysregulated genes and pathways for any dis-
ease sample can be readily detected. The usefulness of the
Ran/(Comp method in clinical settings was exemplified by the identi-
fication and application of prognostic markers for lung cancer.

1 INTRODUCTION

The differential expression analysis methods on intergroup com-
parison for identifying disease-related genes can be classiﬁed into
two broad categories: the intensity-based methods such as T-Test
(Rice, 1995), SAM (Tusher et al., 2001) and Limma (Smyth,
2004), and the rank-based methods such as Wilcoxon signed
rank test ONilcoxon, 1945), Wilcoxon rank sum test (Hollander
and Wolfe, 1973) and RP (Breitling et al., 2004). Of the rank-
based methods, there is a special type of method using the fold-
change ordering information, such as RP (Breitling et al., 2004),
RcoS (Navon et al., 2009) and FCROS (Dembele and Kastner,
2014). In general, these methods ﬁrst entail ranking fold-change
values within each pairwise comparison between two types of

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

samples, then calculate a fold-change rank ordering statistic for
each gene. The signiﬁcance of the observed statistic could be
determined by using a permutation test (e. g. RP) or probability
distribution function (e.g. FCROS). The rank-based methods
usually have some advantages in comparison with the inten-
sity-based methods, such as robustness against outlier values
and favorable power efﬁciency in some cases (Lehmann, 1975).
However, both the above-mentioned intensity-based and rank-
based methods are designed to detect the population-level DE
genes and cannot provide patient-speciﬁc differential expression
information.

Taking the heterogeneous nature of disease into account, sev-
eral outlier detection methods, including COPA (Tomlins et al.,
2005), OS (Tibshirani and Hastie, 2007), ORT Wu, 2007),
MOST (Lian, 2008) and others (de Ronde et al., 2013; Hu,
2008; Wang et al., 2012), are developed to detect genes that are
dysregulated in subsets of disease samples. However, they are
more sensitive to various technical artifacts, especially experi-
mental batch effects caused by differences in laboratory condi-
tions, reagent lots and personnel (Leek et al., 2010). In general,
batch effects can introduce serious problems in translating ex-
perimental ﬁndings to clinical settings. For example, because of
this problem, an optimized threshold value of the risk score
summarizing the expression levels of signature genes determined
from a set of training samples cannot be directly applied to other
samples. Usually, in validation studies, data normalization is
required for independently extracted samples to make all data
having nearly the same scale as the training samples. However,
current normalization methods that are used to adjust for sys-
tematic technical artifacts are usually not able to remove batch
effects (Lazar et al., 2012). They may even distort biological sig-
nals Wang et al., 2011). More fundamentally, large interindivid-
ual variation in gene expression will exacerbate the problem of
threshold setting for risk stratiﬁcation. To tackle this difﬁcult
problem, researchers have proposed to make use of the relative
ordering information of gene expression within each sample,
considering that the relative ordering of gene expression within
each sample would be rather robust against batch effects and
insensitive to data normalization (Geman et al., 2004; Tan
et al., 2005).

The relative ordering of gene expression is overall stable in a
particular type of normal human tissue but widely disturbed in
diseased tissue. Taking this into account, a method of detecting

Individual-level analysis of differential expression

 

DE genes in individual disease samples is here proposed. Using
both simulated data and real paired cancer—normal data, this
method was shown to have excellent performance for individ-
ual-level analyses of dysregulated genes and pathways. The use
of this method in clinical contexts was exempliﬁed by the iden-
tiﬁcation and application of prognostic markers to risk stratiﬁ-
cation of lung cancer patients according to the dysregulation
status of signature in each patient rather than a predeﬁned risk
threshold value.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Data and preprocessing

Multiple microarray datasets of gene expression, generated with the
Affymetrix platform (HG-U133 Plus2.0), were downloaded from Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO; Edgar eta]., 2002). Notably, normal samples
of each type of tissue (lung or breast) were collected from datasets
for studying different disorders on this tissue, as described in detail in
Table l. Paired cancer—normal samples taken from the same patients

were used to evaluate the performance of RankComp. The cancer
sample data with survival information were used for survival analysis.
More detailed clinical information on survival data can be found in the
Supplementary Material.

The use of relative expression obviates the need of between-chip nor-
malization because all direct comparisons between genes occur within
individual samples and inter-chip normalization can preserve order
(Heinaniemi et al., 2013). For this reason, the raw data (.CEL ﬁles) for
each dataset was processed using the RMA algorithm for background
adjustment without quantile normalization (Irizarry et al., 2003). Then,
each probeset ID was mapped to Entrez gene ID with the custom CDF
ﬁle. If multiple probesets were mapped to the same gene, the expression
value for the gene was summarized as the arithmetic mean of the values of
multiple probesets (on the log2 scale).

2.2 The MSigDB pathway

The 674 canonical Reactome pathways were downloaded from the C2-
CP collection of the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB version
4.0, updated May 31, 2013; Subramanian et al., 2005). These pathways
covered 6025 unique genes for pathway enrichment analysis.

2.3 Rank comparison

First, each gene expression value is converted to its rank within each
sample (the smallest expression value corresponding to the minimum
rank, and the largest expression value corresponding to the maximum
rank). Then, pairwise comparisons are performed for all genes to identify
gene pairs with stable ordering in accumulated normal samples for a
particular type of tissue from different data sources. For each gene pair
(G,-, Gj), being viewed as an event with only two possible outcomes (G,->GJ-
or G,<Gj), the frequency of samples in normal samples for which the rank
of G, is greater (or less) than that of Gj is estimated as follows:

"1
1 2 :
Pnorm(Gi >  : n—l [[G1'[ > Gjl]
l=l

n1
1 2 :
Pnorm(Gi <  : n—l [[Gil < Gjl]
[=1

where n, is the total number of normal samples and I is the indicator
function. Stable gene pairs are deﬁned as gene pairs with
Pnorm(G,->Gj)>0.99 or Pnorm(G,-<Gj)>0.99. Next, reversal gene pairs
are deﬁned for each disease sample as gene pairs with reversal ordering
in comparison with their stable ordering in normal samples
(G,->GJ—> G,<Gj or G,<Gj—> G,->GJ-). Afterwards, the Fisher’s exact test is
used to determine whether a given gene (G,-) is differentially expressed in a
given disease sample (k) by testing the null hypothesis that the numbers of
reversal gene pairs supporting its upregulation and downregulation are
equal. For G,-, if its ordering is consistently lower (or higher) than that of
GJ- in normal samples but the opposite in the disease sample k, then this
reversal gene pair is considered to support upregulation (or downregula-
tion) of G,- in that sample. Let G denote the set of stable gene pairs
including G,- in normal samples, a and b denote the numbers of gene
pairs belonging to G with ordering patterns {G,->GJ-} and {G,<GJ~} and
c and (1 denote the corresponding numbers of gene pairs belonging
to G with ordering patterns {G,->GJ-} and {G,<Gf} in the disease sample
k. To this end, the proportions of gene pairs with ordering patterns
{G,->GJ-} and {G,<Gf} are Obsll/Obslz = a/b in normal samples and
Obszl/Obszz = c/d in the disease sample k, respectively. Under the null
hypothesis, we will expect that Obsll/Obslz = Obszl/Obszz, which can
be tested by the Fisher’s exact test, wherein G,- is deﬁned as upregulated
if c/d>a/b, downregulated if c/d<a/b and stable expression if c/d = a/b.
Finally, a ﬁltering process is adopted to minimize the potential effect of
the expression changes of other genes on the upward or downward shift

in the rank of a gene detected as an up- or downregulated DE gene: if and
only if it is still signiﬁcant after excluding the downregulated (or upregu-
lated) partner genes involved in the reversal gene pairs supporting its
upregulation (or downregulation), it will be retained.

Notably, besides its major application for detecting DE gene at the
individual level, the RankComp method could also be applied to identify
DE genes at the subpopulation level by using the binomial test to ﬁnd a
non-randomly high percentage (1‘) of disease samples sharing certain DE
genes. Here, the minimum value of f (f = k/I’lg) that meets a prespeciﬁed
signiﬁcance level for the binomial test can be determined as follows:

"2
P: E :CIZZPOk(1—Po)("2_k)
k

where k is the number of the observed dysregulated samples for each
gene, n2 is the total number of disease samples and p0 is the probability
of observing a gene being differentially expressed in a disease sample by
chance, calculated as the average of the frequencies of DE genes among
all the genes on the array for individual disease samples.

2.4 Evaluation of performance

First, a simulation is performed to evaluate the performance of the
RankComp method. To retain the intrinsic structure of real microarray
data, the simulations were conducted based on real microarray dataset
rather than beginning by assuming normal distribution (see Section 3 for
detailed description of simulation experiments). The simulation experi-
ment enables us to know both the DE genes and non-DE genes and
facilitate the calculation of sensitivity, speciﬁcity and F-score. For each
simulation scenario, the sensitivity, speciﬁcity and F-score of the
RankComp method for detection of DE genes are estimated at different
FDR control levels. Here, the sensitivity is deﬁned as the ratio of cor-
rectly identiﬁed DE genes to all DE genes and the speciﬁcity is deﬁned as
the ratio of correctly identiﬁed non-DE genes to all non-DE genes. The
F-score, a harmonic mean of sensitivity and speciﬁcity, is calculated as
follows:

2 sensitivit X s eci icit
F—score= ( y p f y)

 

(sensitivity + specificity)

Then, the real microarray data of paired cancer—normal samples, as
described in Table 1, is used as a benchmark to evaluate the performance
of the RankComp method. For a paired samples of cancer and normal
tissues, a gene is deﬁned as up-regulated if its expression level in the
cancer sample is larger than that in the normal sample, and deﬁned as
down-regulated if its expression level in the cancer sample is smaller than
that in the normal sample, regardless of whether the changes in its expres-
sion level are signiﬁcant or not. Taking the change directions (up- or
down-regulation) of genes observed in the paired cancer-normal samples
as the golden standard, we then deﬁne a DE gene, detected by the
RankComp method in the same cancer sample, whose change direction
is consistent with the golden standard as a consistent DE gene. For each
cancer sample, the consistency score, as representative of the precision of
DE detection, is calculated as the ratio of the consistent DE genes to all
DE genes, and the number of DE genes is used to access the detection
power of the method. Notably, the corresponding paired normal tissue
samples are not used to determine stable gene pairs in normal tissues.

2.5 Pathway analysis at the individual level

The hypergeometric distribution model was used to determine the signiﬁ-
cance of biological pathways enriched with up- and downregulated DE
genes separately (Hong et al., 2013). The P—values were adjusted using the
Benjamini and Hochberg procedure, controlling FDR at the 5% level
(Hochberg and Benjamini, 1995).

2.6 Survival analysis and pathway signature selection

The overall survival was calculated from the date of surgery until death or
last follow-up contact. To avoid the bias of patient follow-up duration,
patients with >120 months of follow-up were truncated at 120 months.
The survival curves were estimated by the Kaplan—Meier method (Meier,
1958) and were compared using the log-rank test (Gray, 1988). The Cox
proportional hazard model was used for univariate and multivariate sur-
vival analysis (Cox, 1972).

The forward stepwise algorithm was used to identify an optimal path-
way predictor of survival. Beginning with the pathway with the highest
concordance index (C-index; Harrell et al., 1996) as the initial signature,
candidate pathways were added one at a time to the signature until the
next one to be added did not improve prognostic performance. At each
step, predictive performance was gauged for all possible additions and
evaluated using the c-index to select the optimal addition yielding the
largest increase in the c-index value. The C-index is a measure of the
probability that, given a pair of randomly selected patients, the model
correctly predicts which patient will have a better outcome. This measure
quantiﬁes discriminatory ability, ranging from 0.5 (indicating random
chance) to 1 (indicating perfect discrimination).

3 RESULTS

3.1 Stable expression ordering of gene pairs in normal
human tissues

To determine whether relative expression ordering of gene pairs
is stable in normal samples for a particular tissue, normal tissue
samples from different datasets were collected for the study of
different disorders. For normal lung tissue, a total of 210 samples
were collected from multiple datasets of several lung diseases,
including lung cancer and chronic obstructive puhnonary dis-
ease. They were then divided into two groups: one group of 65
samples was derived from the GSE19188 dataset and another
group of 145 samples was derived from four other datasets
(Table 1). In each group, pairwise comparisons were performed
for all genes to identify stable gene pairs present in at least 99%
of normal samples. More than 95% (112970616 over
118725 563) of the stable gene pairs identiﬁed in the second
group were included in the 135020 175 stable gene pairs identi-
ﬁed in the ﬁrst group. Remarkably, all of the 112970616 over-
lapping gene pairs had the same ordering patterns across the two
groups of samples. This was highly unlikely to happen by chance
(binomial test, P< l.0e-l6), indicating that stable gene pairs are
highly reproducible in different sets of normal tissue samples.
Similar results were observed in normal breast tissue (Table l
and Supplementary Table S1). Notably, all genes on the array
were involved in stable gene pairs for each of the two types of
tissue named above, indicating that stable gene pairs widely exist
in normal human tissues and that stable gene pairs are an inher-
ent feature of gene expression in normal human tissues. These
results provide a basis for individualized differential analysis
using gene ranking information.

In order to further show the inherent advantage of stable
expression ordering of gene pairs over distribution variations
of gene expression, a pair of genes (GCKR and GATAI) with
stable expression ordering obtained from normal lung tissue
samples was taken as an example here. As illustrated in Figure
1, even after quantile normalization, the expression distributions
of the two genes in normal samples from different datasets are

Normal samples

Fig. 1. An example of a pair of genes showing stable relative expression
orderings in normal samples of lung tissue. The plot illustrates that the
expression distributions of two genes (GCKR and GATAl) in normal
samples from different datasets are still different even after quantile nor-
malization. For example, the expression intensities of these two genes in
all normal samples of GSE19804 are always higher than those in
GSE19188. However, the relative expression ordering of these two
genes within each sample is insensitive to the distribution variations
from different datasets: the expression intensity of gene GCKR keeps
larger than that of gene GATAl within each sample in any of the datasets

still different so that the expression intensities of these genes in
different datasets are incomparable. These distribution variations
hamper data integration from different data sources. However,
the relative ordering of gene expression within each sample is
insensitive to these distribution variations and thus would facili-
tate multi-source data integration.

3.2 Evaluation of performance

First, the performance of the RankComp method was evaluated
using a simulation. To retain the intrinsic structure of the data,
data were simulated for 60 disease samples and 100 disease sam-
ples on the basis of the expression proﬁles of 15 000 genes for 60
normal lung tissue samples and 100 normal breast tissue samples
extracted from the GSE19804 and GSE26457 datasets, respect-
ively. For each normal sample, 1500 upregulated and 1500 down-
regulated genes were randomly generated and used to produce a
disease sample by setting these genes with different magnitudes
of differential expression (e.g. longC =:l:0.8,:l: 1.0 and:l: 1.2).
Here, the fold-change (longC) was used to quantify the differ-
ence in expression levels of each gene between the disease sample
and the corresponding normal sample. For the large dataset
of 100 disease samples and 100 normal samples, when the mag-
nitude of differential expression (llongCl) was increased from
0.8 to 1.2, the sensitivity increased from 79 to 96% at the cost of
a slight decrease in speciﬁcity, from 94 to 85%. As shown in
Table 2, the method exhibited rather good performance with
sensitivity >90%, speciﬁcity >85% and F-score >90% when
the magnitude of differential expression was not too small
(llongCl 2 1.0). To determine the effect of normal sample size,
the performance of the method was studied in the small dataset
of 60 disease samples and 60 normal samples. As expected, a
slight decline in sensitivity, speciﬁcity and F-score was observed

for each scenario. Similar results were observed for the scenarios
with 5% FDR level.

Then, the real microarray data of paired cancer-normal sam-
ples was used as a benchmark to evaluate the performance of the
method. Using the stable gene pairs obtained from the 210
normal lung tissue samples, with 5% FDR control, DE genes
for each lung cancer sample from an independent paired cancer-
normal sample dataset (GSE27262) were detected using the
RankComp method described in Section 2.3. To ensure the asso-
ciation between the individualized DE genes and cancer, the
analysis was restricted to genes that were dysregulated in a
non-randomly high percentage of cancer samples. For each
cancer sample, average 2722 DE genes showing dysregulated in
at least 44% of samples were identiﬁed with an average precision
of 90.35%, as indicated by the consistency between the detected
dysregulation directions of the DE genes and their actual dysre-
gulation directions observed in the paired samples. In particular,
when focusing on the analysis of the top 100 ranked DE genes
for each cancer sample, the average precision reached 99.80%.
Similar evaluation results were observed in an independent
paired cancer—normal sample dataset for breast cancer
(GSE10780; Supplementary Table S2). These results indicated
that the RankComp method can reliably capture differential ex-
pression signals, especially the top-ranked signals, in cancer pa-
tients based on the landscape of stable gene pairs obtained in
advance using previously accumulated data.

Notably, the criteria for identifying stable gene pairs in normal
samples may affect the results of differential expression analysis.
When the criteria were decreased from strict control (99%) to
loose control (95%), the average number of DE genes for lung
cancer increased by about 44% and the average precision
decreased by about 5%. Similar results were observed for
breast cancer (Supplementary Table S3). A strict control of
99% would minimize false positives.

In principle, the RankComp method is an incremental learning
process, during which its performance can be improved along
with the accumulation of normal samples for a particular type
of tissue by setting an increasingly reliable landscape of stable
gene pairs. This advantage here was demonstrated by investigat-
ing the impact of normal samples on the performance. From the

210 normal lung tissue samples, subsets of different sample sizes,
ranging from 50 samples per group to the highest sample size,
were randomly extracted. As shown in Figure 2, when the
normal sample size increased from 50 to 210, the average preci-
sion increased from 88.78 to 90.35% at the cost of a decline in
average number of DE genes, from 3726 to 2722. However, the
rate of decline gradually decreased, indicating a stably improving
trend of DE genes detection as the normal sample size increased.
The same trend was observed for breast cancer (Fig. 2).

3.3 Use of individual-level DE analysis for outlier
detection

As described in the Methods, besides the individual-level analysis
of DE genes, the RankComp method can be applied to identify
DE genes at the subpopulation level, similar to outlier detection
methods such as COPA, OS, CRT and MOST. Because it has
been shown that COPA and MOST for outlier detection perform
relatively better in comparison with several other methods such
as OS and ORT (Karrila et al., 2011), we compared only
RankComp with COPA and MOST in simulation data. The
detailed descriptions of simulation experiments and parameter
settings were presented in the Supplementary Material, and the
detailed results were presented in Supplementary Table S4.
Brieﬂy, the F-score comparison results showed that RankComp
performed similarly with COPA and better than MOST at
(p = 5%, 10% and 20%, but obviously better than COPA and
slightly worse than MOST at (p = 50% and 80%. These results
demonstrated that the RankComp method for detecting DE
genes in subsets of disease samples can perform better in many
scenarios, indicating a potential advantage of applying the
RankComp method for detecting DE genes in various propor-
tions of disease samples. In addition, we mimicked systematic
batch effects in the simulated datasets to evaluate the robustness
of the RankComp method against systematic batch effects. As
shown in Supplementary Table S5, the RankComp method had
the advantage of insensitivity to systematic batch effects (for
details, see Supplementary Material).

Notably, we could also apply the RankComp method to iden-
tify the population-level DE genes, deﬁned as the combination of

subpopulation-level DE genes, considering that the population-
level DE genes might not be dysregulated in all samples. In this
sense, we compared RankComp with the Wilcoxon signed-rank
test and Limma. As shown in Supplementary Table S4, the F-
score comparison showed that RankComp performed better than
both the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and Limma for all the scen-
arios with (p = 5% and still better than Limma for the scenarios
with (p =10%, but worse than both the Wilcoxon signed-rank
test and Limma for all the scenarios with (p =20, 50 and 80%.
These results suggested that RankComp is generally uncompeti-
tive for detecting the population-level DE genes. Thus, we do not
recommend using the RankComp method to detect DE genes at
the population level.

3.4 Use of individual-level DE analysis in survival analysis

Individualized DE gene analysis provides a basis for individual-
level pathway analysis, which could be readily applied in clinical
contexts. To exemplify this application, a publicly available
microarray dataset of 204 early-stage lung adenocarcinoma sam-
ples with survival data was analyzed (GSE31210). Using the
landscape of stable gene pairs obtained from the 235 normal
lung tissue samples, dysregulated genes were detected for each
of 204 cancer samples at the FDR level of 0.05. Focusing on
these cancer-associated genes for each cancer sample, biological
pathways that were signiﬁcantly enriched with up- and down-DE
genes in this sample were detected at the FDR level of 0.05. The
results indicated that the dysregulation of biological pathways in
lung cancer patients is heterogeneous (Supplementary Fig. S1).
For example, the ‘deposition of new CENPA—containing nucleo-
somes at the centromere pathway’ was signiﬁcantly dysregulated
in 50% of cancer patients but not in the others. Dividing the
cohort of 204 patients into two groups according to the dysre-
gulation status of this pathway showed that the dysregulation of
this pathway was signiﬁcantly associated with poor overall
survival in lung cancer patients (Log-rank test, P = l.29e-05).
Multivariate analysis showed that high-risk and low-risk desig-
nation remained statistically signiﬁcant after adjustment for
age, gender and smoking status (Supplementary Fig. S2A and
Supplementary Table S6). This result was validated in an
independent pooled cohort of 182 lung cancer samples
(Supplementary Fig. S2B and Supplementary Table S6).

Many other pathways whose dysregulation status was predict-
ive for survival of lung cancer patients were also found
(Supplementary Table S7). To look into this further, a forward
stepwise algorithm was used to select an optimal set of pathways
with the highest predictive power for prognosis. A two-pathway
signature consisting of the ‘deposition of new CENPA-contain—
ing nucleosomes at the centromere pathway’ and ‘DNA replica-
tion pathway’ was generated in the training cohort (Fig. 3A),
with a poor prognosis for patients with simultaneous dysregula-
tion of these two pathways conﬁrmed in the validation cohort
(Fig. 3B). Multivariate analysis showed that the two-pathway
signature remained signiﬁcantly associated with overall survival
after adjustment for age, gender and stage (Supplementary Table
S8). It has been found that dysregulation of the former pathway
can cause ectopic formation resulting in multicentric chromo-
somes and consequential genome instability that drives tumor
progression (Amato et al., 2009). For instance, the

overexpression of CENPA gene involved in this pathway pro-
motes cancer progression by increasing genome instability
(Amato et al., 2009). Dysregulation of the latter pathway can
trigger replicative stress and replication-associated DNA
damage, favoring the accumulation of genetic alterations in
cancer cells (Allera—Moreau et al., 2012; Bartkova et al., 2006).
For instance, the overexpression of PLKl gene involved in this
pathway promotes cancer progression by increasing resistance to
replication stress respectively (Allera—Moreau et al., 2012). These
studies provided the additional evidence to support our ﬁndings
from the aspect of biological importance.

Taken together, these analyses demonstrated the capacity of
the RankComp method to add value in a prognostic setting and
provide patient-speciﬁc information for personalized medicine.

4 DISCUSSION

The overall stable ordering of gene expression in a normal
human tissue may reﬂect the biological reality that the normal
state should be robust against various perturbations (Shiraishi
et al., 2010). During the transition from the normal state to
a disease state, the ordering of gene expression residing in a dis-
eased tissue may be subject to extensive changes, which could be
sufﬁcient to reveal patient-speciﬁc differential expression

information, as demonstrated by the results based on both simu-
lated data and real paired cancer—normal sample data. One
unique advantage of the present relative ordering-based
method is that it is insensitive to batch effects and data normal-
ization and thus can directly use microarray data from different
data sources. In particular, the landscape of stable gene pairs in a
particular type of normal tissue can be pre-determined using
previously accumulated data of normal samples collected for
the study of different disorders on the tissue and could become
increasingly stable and reliable along with data accumulation of
normal samples. Based on the landscape, dysregulated genes and
pathways for an individual disease sample of this tissue can be
readily detected.

Analysis of individualized DE genes could have important ap-
plications. First, it can be of value in the practice of personalized
medicine. For prognostic risk stratiﬁcation, the present method
can directly stratify patients at the individual level based on the
dysregulation status of signature in each patient. Optimal risk
threshold value that is determined from a set of training samples
using a risk-scoring method usually needs to be redetermined in
independent samples because of technical and biological vari-
ations. Another possible application of the RankComp method
is in addressing the scarcity of normal tissue samples, which are
often rare because of the invasive nature of sample collection.
Fortunately, normal samples for a particular type of tissue, gen-
erated in different laboratories for the study of different dis-
orders, are often collected in public repositories. Using these
normal samples, this method can be used to predetermine the
landscape of stable expression ordering of gene pairs for that
particular type of tissue. Then, based on this landscape, dysre-
gulated genes and pathways for any disease sample of this tissue
can be readily detected. In this way, the present method makes it
possible to maximize the reuse of accumulated data for normal
tissue samples and facilitate the research of human disease.

Nevertheless, the present method also has several limitations.
First, the RankComp method may have insufﬁcient power to
detect genes whose differential expression causes minor changes
in the gene ranking proﬁle. Fortunately, even if a certain number
of DE genes go undetected in a given disease sample, shifting the
focus of the analysis from individual genes to pathways tends to
produce relatively robust results despite insufﬁcient power (Yang
et al., 2008; Zou et al., 2012). Second, the analysis presented here
was performed only on microarray data from the same platform
because the ordering of gene expression is sensitive to microarray
platforms to some degree. One possible way of addressing this
limitation is to ﬁlter out gene pairs with unstable ordering in
datasets produced by different platforms.

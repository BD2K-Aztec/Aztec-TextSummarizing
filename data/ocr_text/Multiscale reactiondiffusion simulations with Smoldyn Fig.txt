Abstract

Summary: Smoldyn is a software package for stochastic modelling of spatial biochemical networks
and intracellular systems. It was originally developed with an accurate off—lattice particle—based
model at its core. This has recently been enhanced with the addition of a computationally efficient
on—lattice model, which can be run stand—alone or coupled together for multiscale simulations
using both models in regions where they are most required, increasing the applicability of
Smoldyn to larger molecule numbers and spatial domains. Simulations can switch between mod—
els with only small additions to their configuration file, enabling users with existing Smoldyn
configuration files to run the new on—lattice model with any reaction, species or surface descrip—
tions they might already have.

Availability and Implementation: Source code and binaries freely available for download at
\MNw.smoldyn.org, implemented in C/C++ and supported on Linux, Mac OSX and MS Windows.

1 Introduction

In recent years, computational simulations for modelling spatial bio—
chemical networks and intracellular systems have grown in popular—
ity. The rapid increase in computation power and software
complexity have increased the range of applicability of these tools to
larger and more complex biological systems, while including import-
ant stochastic, geometrical (boundary) and multiscale temporal and
spatial effects. Computational simulations have been successfully
used to understand cellular systems such as cell division in
Escherichia coli (Fange and Elf, 2006), spatio—temporal correlations
in the Mitogen—Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway
(Takahashi et 61]., 2010) and actin dynamics in filopodia (Zhuravlev
and Papoian, 2009).

reaction—diffusion networks on arbitrary domains and surfaces. It
uses a readable, plain—text configuration file to specify molecular
species, reactions, simulation surfaces or compartments and has
a run—time command feature that allows users to specify either ob—
servations (e.g. concentration profiles, total molecule numbers) or
manipulations of the system (e.g. moving surfaces, changing reac—
tion or diffusion rates).

This article presents a major update of the Smoldyn package,
which incorporates a new on—lattice model and its coupling with the
existing off-lattice model. A significant new feature is the ability to
setup multiscale simulations that can use the accurate off—lattice
models in specific regions of interest, coupled with a coarse but com—
putationally efficient on—lattice model for the rest of the domain
(Erban et 61]., 2013).

Multiscale simulations of this nature are useful for modelling un-
bounded or large domains where a large portion of the domain is

Fig. 1. (a) Multiscale Smoldyn simulation of yeast signalling between haploid
Saccharomyces cerevisiae of opposite mating types (MATa and MATOL,‘
Andrews et al., 2010). The centre region contains a detailed off-lattice model
of several MATa and MATOL cells, which is coupled to a coarse on-lattice
model to describe the diffusion and interaction of a pheromone (oi-factor) and
a pheromone-degrading protease (Bar1) within the surrounding environ-
ment. (b) Speed-up versus lattice spacing h that can be achieved by using the
on-lattice model for the bulk of the domain (speed-up equals 1 for a purely
off-lattice simulation). The simulation domain is a 100 x 100x 100 um cube
with an absorbing boundary. The gradient of bound ot-factor across the cen-
tral cell (a measure of simulation accuracy) did not vary with h over the range
considered, and the mean was within 1% of that obtained from the purely off-
lattice simulation

homogeneous or has limited concentration gradients. An example
is illustrated in Figure 1, which shows a multiscale model of yeast
signalling using Smoldyn as well as the speed—up achieved versus
lattice resolution 19. Using a coarse on—lattice model allows the simu—
lation of a large domain with minimal computational effort. It is
also flexible enough to allow for the addition of surfaces and/or
other off—lattice subdomains.

Similar software packages that couple off—lattice and on—lattice
methods have been described by Hellander et al. (2012; URDME),
Klann et al. (2012) and VCell (Slepchenko et al., 2003), which sup—
ports overlapping space multiscale simulation for deterministic and
stochastic off—lattice models. One advantage of multiscale modelling
in Smoldyn is its accuracy, as discussed in Section 5. Another signifi-
cant advantage is Smoldyn’s flexibility and large feature—set for
specifying an increasingly wide variety of spatial models. It is pri—
marily a tool for application—focused users, and features comprehen—
sive documentation and example configurations scripts. Smoldyn
incorporates a surface description language, where complicated geo—
metries (e.g. cellular membranes) can be built up from individual
elements. Molecular species can reflect, be absorbed or transmit
through the surfaces, or associate/disassociate and diffuse along the

front or back of each surface, reacting with other molecules in solu—
tion or bound to the surface. The surface description language, as
well as reﬂection, absorption and transmitting actions have all been
incorporated into the new on—lattice model so surfaces can extend
across both on—lattice and off—lattice model subdomains
(Supplementary Information).

2 Methods

The off—lattice model, that has been at the heart of Smoldyn, treats
each molecule as a point in a continuous spatial domain. These mol—
ecules diffuse in solution or along surfaces, interact with surfaces
and undergo zeroth, first and second order reactions, according to a
constant timestep algorithm based on the Smoluchowski model
(Andrews and Bray, 2004; Andrews, 2012). The new on—lattice
model uses a regular array of connected lattice sites. Molecules can
diffuse by jumping between neighbouring lattice sites and react with
molecules at the same site. The model can be mathematically
described as a discrete space continuous time Markov chain and is
implemented using the Next Subvolume Method (NSM) (Elf and
Ehrenberg, 2004).

The coupling between the on—lattice and off—lattice regions uses
the Two Regime Method (TRM) (Flegg et al., 2012; Flegg et al.,
2014), which correctly calculates the diffusion flux of species
through an interface between the subdomains. Robinson et al.
(2014) provides an error analysis and generalisation of the TRM to
moving interfaces (ATRM).

The on—lattice model is ideally used in regions of high molecule
number and/or relatively homogeneous molecule distributions. The
latter condition is also helpful to reduce the diffusion error due to
the coupling (TRM), which vanishes as the net ﬂux of molecules
over the interface goes to 0. If this is not possible, then the minimum
coupling error is achieved by using a balance between the lattice
spacing lo and off—lattice timestep At so that Io % m, where
D5 is the diffusion constant for species S. Away from the interface,
the spatial discretization introduced by the lattice means that the dif—
fusion error is slightly increased with order O(h2), particularly near
surfaces, so in regions, where high spatial accuracy or complex
geometry is required the off—lattice model is preferred. The perform-
ance of the coupling algorithm between the models scales with the
ﬂux of molecules across the interface, meaning that the performance
is generally limited by the off—lattice and on—lattice models individu—
ally, rather than the coupling.

3 Conclusion

The addition of an efficient on—lattice model to Smoldyn and the
ability to setup multiscale simulations allows the simulation
of larger domains and molecule numbers, while still allowing the use
of an off—lattice model for accurate treatment of surface geometries,
surface—bound species and high concentration gradients. This is
advantageous for the simulation of highly heterogeneous reaction—
diffusion processes, e.g. the growth of actin filaments (Erban et al.,
2013) or intracellular calcium signalling (Flegg et al., 2013).

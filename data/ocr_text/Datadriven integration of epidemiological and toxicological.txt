ABSTRACT

Motivation: Complex diseases, such as Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
(T2D), result from the interplay of both environmental and genetic
factors. However, most studies investigate either the genetics or the
environment and there are a few that study their possible interaction
in context of disease. One key challenge in documenting interactions
between genes and environment includes choosing which of each to
test jointly. Here, we attempt to address this challenge through a
data-driven integration of epidemiological and toxicological studies.
Specifically, we derive lists of candidate interacting genetic and
environmental factors by integrating findings from genome-wide
and environment-wide association studies. Next, we search for
evidence of toxicological relationships between these genetic and
environmental factors that may have an etiological role in the disease.
We illustrate our method by selecting candidate interacting factors
for T2D.

1 INTRODUCTION

Complex diseases and phenotypes, such as Type 2 Diabetes
(T2D), have multifactorial etiology in which both genetic and
environmental factors play a role (Schwartz and Collins, 2007).
Through multiple genetic association studies, such as the genome—
wide association study (GWAS) we have discovered many common
variants associated with complex disease; however, these variants
confer very little disease risk and cumulatively explain a limited
portion of heritability (Manolio et al., 2009). It is hypothesized
that perhaps some of the unexplained risk may be due to
‘gene—environment’ interactions, or joint effect of a genetic and
environmental factor are different than that of each of the factors
alone (Hunter, 2005).

We recently put forth an analogous framework to investigate
possible environmental inﬂuences on disease, called an
‘environment—wide association study’ (EWAS), where we connected
over 250 environmental factors to T2D and serum cholesterol levels
(Patel et al., 2010; Patel et al., 2012). Humans are not exposed to a
few environmental factors at a time, but many types of infectious
agents, pollutants, nutrients and vitamins at once, all of which may
play a role in disease. EWAS evaluates multiple environmental
factors to capture the complex nature of environmental exposure in
relation to disease.

Nevertheless, GWAS and EWAS only examine genetic or
environmental factors, respectively, without consideration of the

other. Examining interactions is complex, power—intensive and
exacts a multiple comparison burden (Thomas, 2010). For example,
a list of G genetic variants and E environmental exposures
would result in G or E hypothesis tests in GWAS and EWAS,
respectively; however, to screen the possible space of interactions
would many more tests, equal to G times E. To accommodate these
challenges, statistical methods have been developed to larger space
of interactions (Thomas, 2010; Thomas et al., 2011). Another option
includes adapting methods used to detect gene—gene interactions, or
epistasis (Cordell, 2009).

Yet another way includes paring down the list of G and E factors
to test. In many variant by environment investigations, factors
are selected by convenience, without sufﬁcient documentation of
the strength of their marginal associations. There is a need for
methods to select common variants and exposures resulting from
comprehensive studies, such as GWAS and EWAS (Grarup and
Andersen, 2007; Khoury and Wacholder, 2009; Omenn, 2010).
Further still, GWAS and EWAS operate on the population scale, and
there is need to integrate molecular—scale toxicological evidence—
such as how an environmental factor might modulate a biological
process—between exposures and genes. As yet, there are few
ways to integrate environmental ﬁndings from epidemiological and
toxicological studies.

Here, we propose integrating ﬁndings from genetic and
environmental association studies with knowledge regarding
molecular— and toxicological—scale interactions. By integrating these
data, we aim to assemble a list of genetic and environmental factors
to later test jointly against a phenotype or disease of interest.

Speciﬁcally, we attained a comprehensive list of genetic
variants associated with disease from a curated database, VARiants
Informing MEDicine (VARIMED). VARIMED contains results
from over 6500 peer—reviewed genetic epidemiology studies (e.g.
GWAS), covering over 110 000 variants in 9700 genes associated
with over 2000 phenotypes (Chen et al., 2010). To prioritize
environmental factors, we used an EWAS approach with the Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a biannual health
survey whose participants are representative of the US population
[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2009].

Last, we connected these ﬁndings from VARIMED and EWAS
with the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD), a database
of curated ﬁndings in toxicology. Toxicology is the study of
the biological response to chemicals, such as how a chemical
exposure might induce a gene expression change. As an example,
one such toxicological interaction is derived from an investigation
studying gestational exposure of the plasticizing agent Bisphenol
A on adipogenesis in a Rattus norvegicus model system (Somm
et al., 2009), in which mRNA levels of the gene LPL increased

after chemical exposure. In the CTD, many such chemical—gene
relationships are curated from biomedical journals. The CTD
has documented over 200 000 of these gene and environment
relationships spanning over 26 000 publications. We show how
one can use genetic and environmental epidemiological results with
the CTD to create lists of candidate interacting genes, variants and
environmental factors that may be indicative of disease etiology.

2 METHODS

We propose integrating genetic and environmental epidemiological ﬁndings
with molecular toxicological data to create a list of interacting candidate
factors. A schematic of our methodology is depicted in Figure 1. First, we
describe the data sources we integrated.

2.1 VARIMED: a comprehensive disease-SNP
association database

VARIMED is a database of human variants associated with disease
and disease—related phenotypes curated from the biomedical literature
(Fig. 1A; Chen et al., 2010). As described, we downloaded all abstracts
from MEDLINE and identiﬁed published manuscripts that have reported
on ﬁndings related to human disease and genetic association through
their medical subject headings (MESH; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.g0v/mesh).
Speciﬁcally, we searched for terms such as ‘Genetic Variation’, ‘Genetic
predisposition to disease’, among other terms. We also downloaded all papers
from publicly—available disease—variant databases, such as the National
Human Genome Research Institute’s GWAS catalog (Hindorff et al., 2009).
Features captured from these papers including the disease or phenotype under
investigation (e.g. T2D or cholesterol levels), the race of the population
(e.g. European and African), study type (e.g. case—control or cohort), and
most importantly, variant identiﬁer (dbSNP), P—value of association and
effect size (e.g. odds ratio). In its current form, this database covers 6890
publications, 111 977 variants mapped to 9752 genes and 2053 phenotypes.
Further, each variant was mapped to a gene (e.g. intron, exon or promoter
region), utilizing the National Centers of Biotechnology Infonnation’s
dbSNP resource (human build 131; National Center for Biotechnology
Information, 2012).

2.2 Comparative toxicogenomics database

The CTD includes manually—curated, cross—species relations between
chemicals and genes, proteins and mRNA transcripts (Fig. 1D; Mattingly
et al., 2006). We downloaded the database (January 2012), spanning 219
618 direct relationships between 6079 unique environmental chemical factors
and 21 267 genes and their products in 336 organisms, including humans. An
example of a relationship in the CTD is ‘Chemical y—tocopherol results in
increased expression of PPARG mRNA as cited by Campbell et a]. in Homo
sapiens cell lines’.

2.3 National health and nutrition examination survey

The NHANES is a now biannual cross—sectional health survey representative
of the US population in progress since 1999 [Fig. 1B; Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2009]. Each biannual survey is an
independent, non—overlapping sample of 10 000 participants. Roughly a third
of these participants have their serum and urine analyzed for environmental
factors. In total, there are 266 unique measures of environmental factors,
including infectious agents (e. g. Hepatitis A and HIV), chemical pollutants
(e.g. pesticides and hydrocarbons) and nutrients (e.g. vitamins A, B,
C, D, E and carotenoids). Most environmental factor measures were
continuous; however, some factors were binary, such as presence/absence
assays for some infectious agents. Further, these participants have clinical
measures, such as serum cholesterol and fasting blood glucose (FBG),
markers for chronic disease. Here, we downloaded all available NHANES

laboratory data for 1999—2000, 2001—2002, 2003—2004 and 2005—2006
surveys. To facilitate later integration with the CTD, we mapped each
environmental factor with a MeSH identiﬁer [e. g. Bisphenol A is C006780

(http://www.n1m.nih.g0v/cgi/mesh/2012/MB_cgi?ﬁeld=uid&term=C006780)].

2.4 The space of potential molecular interactions
between phenotype-associated genes and
environmental factors

Before integrating EWAS ﬁndings with VARIMED and toxicological data
to build a list of potential interactions related to the etiology of disease,
we sought to observe how many documented molecular relationships exist
between phenotype— or disease—associated genes and environmental factors
in general. If many of such relationships exist, we concluded, such a database
would be adequate for the next step (Fig. 1C—E). Speciﬁcally, we extracted
all associations in which a variant was associated to any phenotype (e.g.
HDL Cholesterol, T2D and Hypertension) with a P—value 51x10—6 and
mapped these variants to genes. We observed how many of these genes (or
their products) have a documented molecular interaction with a factor in
the CTD.

2.5 Integration of epidemiological ﬁndings with
toxicological data to prioritize factors

We propose combining epidemiological results from studies such as GWAS
and as EWAS with toxicological molecular data to attain a candidate list of
interacting genetic variants and environmental factors for a particular disease
(Fig. 1). We illustrate this process using T2D on populations of European
ancestry.

In the ﬁrst step, we attain a comprehensive list of genetic variants
associated with T2D from VARIMED in populations of European ancestry
(Fig. 1B, left panel). We choose a set of G variants based on their strength
of association, or P—value set at some threshold p.

In the second step, we attain a similar list of environmental factors
associated with T2D with the EWAS approach in an analogous population
in NHANES (Fig. 1B, right panel; Patel et al., 2010). We brieﬂy describe
this approach. First, we classiﬁed diabetics and controls as individuals
who had FBG 2126 mg/dL, the recommended threshold for diagnosis of
T2D from the American Diabetes Association. Second, we ﬁltered these
participants by self—report race, only considering individuals in the Non—
Hispanic White group. Third, we ﬁltered out 7 environmental exposure
variables that varied little and were thus uninformative, leaving 244 variables
for analysis. Most continuous environmental exposure variables had a long—
tailed distribution and we log—transformed and applied a z—transformation to
them (mean centered and divided by the SD). Due to elimination of all but
Non—Hispanic White participants from the sample, we combined individuals
from all surveys to maximize power for detection.

We conducted our EWAS by associating each of the 244 factors to T2D
status using multivariate survey logistic regression, adjusting for sex, age,
socioeconomic level (SES) and body mass index (BMI) iteratively, resulting
in 244 separate tests of association, indexed by i:

Logit(FBG Z 126 mg/dL) = or + ﬁexp exposure,- + other adjustments

We collected the effect size of each i—th exposure (ﬁexp) and its P—value.
Each test had a sample size of 315—3748 (comprising of 8—10% diabetics).
We chose to adjust for age, sex, socioeconomic level and BMI as they
are possible confounders and can be correlated with both T2D status and
environmental exposure (Patel et al., 2010). We accounted for multiple
comparisons and assessed strength of association by estimating the false
discovery rate (FDR), the estimated proportion of false discoveries made
versus the number of discoveries made at a given signiﬁcance level
(Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995) and as we described previously (Patel et al.,
2010). To estimate the FDR, we ﬁrst permuted the dependent variable, T2D
status, 1000 times and re—computed regressions to attain a distribution of
‘null’ P—values by which we could estimate the average number of false

positives for a given threshold. Then, we estimated the FDR as the rate of
false positives divided by discoveries at a given P—value. Finally, we choose
a set of E exposures based on their strength of association at some FDR 5 q.

Given a set of E exposures selected at some threshold q and G genes
selected with a threshold p, we search for any pair from E and G (E x G
total pairs possible) in the CTD (Fig. 1D, E). Finally, the disease—associated
variants that map to genes may be utilized to as candidate variants for a
variant by environment study.

We implemented a permutation method to approximate the probability
of attaining such a result due to random chance. Speciﬁcally, we permuted
the dependent variable of EWAS analysis (T2D status) as described in the
FDR estimation procedure above and recomputed the association between
exposure and T2D. We took the top E/ (equal to the size of E, |E |) exposures
and searched for any pair E/ and G in the CTD. We then assessed whether any
or all pairs from E and G are in randomization—derived set, constructed with
E’ and G. We repeated this process 1000 times and computed the frequency
that any or all pairs from E and G appear in E/ and G. This frequency was
our estimate of the empirical P—value.

We ﬁrst sought to observe if the CTD contained toxicological
relationships between environmental chemicals and genes with

a phenotype bases on presence of a variant in an intron, exon or promoter

<1 x 10‘6. Phenotypes with >20 genes, such as ‘Metabolic Trait’, ‘Height’
and ‘Rheumatoid arthritis’ are labeled with numbers (key on right panel).
T2D is depicted as 17, with 100% of 43 genes having some documented

interactions with chemical environmental factors. First, in total, we
tabulated 2236 unique genes associated that mapped to a variant
with P—value 51x10—6 and all of these 2236 genes had some
documented relationship in the CTD. Second, we found that many of
the genes associated with speciﬁc phenotypes had adequate coverage
as well. For example, there were 113 variants associated with T2D
(P—value 5 1 X 10‘6) in 43 genes among 11 different populations.

Of these 43 genes, all 43 had at least one documented molecular
interaction with an environmental factor as curated in the CTD
(Fig. 2, number point labeled 17). In fact, for most phenotypes,
>40% of genes with genome—wide signiﬁcant variants had a
documented interaction in the CTD. Of the 508 phenotypes with
signiﬁcantly associated genes, 392 had at least 90% of their genes
covered in CTD (Fig. 2). However, 182 phenotypes had but only 1
signiﬁcantly associated gene in VARIMED and 176 of these genes
had coverage in the CTD. We concluded that the CTD had adequate
coverage for many common, complex disorders.

3.2 Integration of epidemiological ﬁndings with
toxicological data to prioritize candidate
factors for T2D

In our EWAS process, we found 4, 9, 28 and 68% unique
environmental factors associated with T2D at FDR, or q, of 5, 10,
20 and 30%, respectively, in the Non—Hispanic White population.
For example, at q < 10%, we found factors related to T2D such as
y—tocopherol, a type of vitamin E (q = 1%), Heptachlor Epoxide, a
pesticide (q = 6%) with effect sizes of 1.4 and 1.8, respectively, for
a change in 1 SD in logged units of exposure level. We found other
factors protective for T2D, such cis—ﬂ—carotene (q = 1%), trans—
,8—carotene (q = 1%) and vitamin D (q = 1%) with odds ratios
of 0.66, 0.70 and, respectively, for a change in 1 SD in logged
units of exposure. As we expected, these ﬁndings were in line our
previously published ﬁndings where we analyzed all races available

Fig. 3. Number of candidate genetic factor by environmental factor
interactions derived from varying signiﬁcance thresholds from genetic
association (p, x—axis) and EWAS FDR (or 61, in different colors). Solid lines
depict total gene—by—environment interactions. Dotted lines depict number of
variant—by—environment interactions. For example, there are six interacting
pairs in the CTD for genes and exposures found at a p=5X10_7 and
q = 10%, respectively

(Patel et 611., 2010). In that study, we were able to validate in more
than one survey y—tocopherol, Heptachlor Epoxide, ,B—carotenes and
a related PCB isomer, with a discovery FDR of 10% (Patel et 611.,
2010).

We queried VARIMED for variants associated with T2D in
populations of European ancestry and mapped these variants to
introns, exons and promoters of genes. For example, we curated
690, 170 and 75 variants associated with T2D with P—values 0.05, 5
x 10‘4 and 5 X 10‘6, respectively. These variants mapped to 359,
85 and 35 unique genes, respectively.

Next, we looked for evidence of molecular interaction in CTD
between factors found in EWAS and VARIMED for varying
signiﬁcance thresholds p and 61 (Fig. 3). As one would expect, for
relaxed p and 61, one would have molecular evidence in the CTD for
over 2070 pairs of genes and environmental factors. This number
is more than doubled when considering all disease variants within

those genes (4574). When prioritizing factors to p and 61 at levels
close to EWAS and GWAS level of signiﬁcance (5 X 10‘7 and 10%
FDR, respectively), one is left with only six candidate interacting
pairs.

As an example, we show 6 candidate interacting factors produced
from applying signiﬁcance thresholds corresponding to p threshold
of 5 X 10‘6 (mapping to 35 genes) and 61 of 10% (9 environmental
factors from EWAS; Table 1). Of these possibilities, there is evidence
in the CTD that the favorable environmental factors, ,8—carotene and
vitamin D may decrease gene expression (as referenced in Callens
et 611., 2010; Kawada et 611., 2000), whereas the y—tocopherol—
associated with T2D risk—may increase PPARG gene expression
(Campbell et 611., 2003).

The set of six interacting candidates did not appear in any
randomization trials (empirical P—value <0.001); however, having
at least one interaction had a P—value of 0.15.

DISCUSSION

We have described a method to combine epidemiological association
ﬁndings with results from toxicological experiments to create a
tractable list candidate of genes, variants and environmental factors
that might interplay in the context of disease. Additionally, the
method is a data—driven integration of three disparate datasets that
span the population to toxicological scale.

Of interest, this method has drawn attention to nutrient factors
that may interact with a gene known to be functional and have
a therapeutic role in T2D, PPARG (Murphy and Holder, 2000;
Spiegelman, 1998). y—Tocopherol, associated with T2D risk in
EWAS, has been observed to increase expression of PPARG mRNA.
Further, forms of carotene protective for T2D have an opposite role,
reducing PPARG expression. Of note, these candidate interactions
are derived from two very different toxicological investigations, one
studying the inﬂuence of y—tocopherol on PPARG expression in
human cell lines (Campbell 61611., 2003) and the other observing the
effects of carotenoids on PPARG in adipocyte differentiation in Mus
musculus (Kawada 61 611., 2000).

A next possible step includes testing these candidate
interactions in the context of disease. Speciﬁcally, we propose an
epidemiological study in which the interaction between functional
variants in PPARG, such as rs1801282, be examined along with

Data-driven integration of epidemiological and toxicological data

 

these nutrients. Speciﬁcally, we shall test whether different levels
of these nutrients modulate genetic risk for T2D.

Variant or gene—by—environment interactions may occur among
factors that fail to reach a suitable level of statistical signiﬁcance
association studies (p and 61). Our method will not prioritize these
factors. However, selecting which of the other many variants to test
is challenging. It is well known that testing for interactions is power—
intensive (Hunter, 2005) and testing a large number or all of them
imposes an even greater power and multiplicity burden (Thomas,
2010). For environmental factors, the choice of which ones to test
for interaction is even more vexing. In contrast to common genetic
variants, there is yet no high—throughput measurement platform that
captures all the environmental factors [the ‘exposome’ (Rappaport
and Smith, 2010)] and lack of measuring capacity limits data
availability. Measurement error and cost—unlike the genome—can
be substantial for many environmental exposures (Ioannidis et 611.,
2009; Vineis, 2004). Further, it is postulated that if a study is
underpowered to detect main effects then one may be underpowered
to detect the interaction effect (Hunter, 2005).

Furthermore, candidate interaction pairs are also inﬂuenced by the
signiﬁcance thresholds p and 61. We chose thresholds that were close
to genome—wide levels of signiﬁcance and previously documented
EWAS FDR threshold (Patel et 611., 2010). We show how the number
of candidates varies as a function of p and 61 (Fig. 3), and the
investigator may use this relationship to pick an optimal number
of candidates to pursue for further testing based on their resources.
While we attempt to compute the probability of a subset of such
ﬁndings using randomization, we acknowledge that other ways
gauging the expectation of such relationships such as should be
developed.

EWAS has both advantages and disadvantages (Fallin and Kao,
2011; Porta et 611., 2012). By allowing for a transparent and data—
driven search for environmental factors associated with disease, it
bypasses the problem of selectively testing and reporting a few
associations at a time, which has been debated as a source of
biased results in environmental epidemiological studies (Blair et 611.,
2009; Boffetta et 611., 2008; Ioannidis, 2005; Ioannidis et 611., 2009).
Like GWAS, EWAS provides an opportunity to ﬁnd novel factors
and prioritize them for future study. EWAS attempts to capture
the complex and multifactorial relationship between environmental
exposure and disease. However, associations found by EWAS may
be biased. First, confounding bias, where the exposure of interest
is correlated with a yet another exposure and the disease remains a
major issue. For example, it is well known that SES is correlated
with to both disease risk and exposure to environmental factors.
Thus, the association of an exposure to a disease may not be causal,
but related to the confounding variable such as SES. Yet another
factor is ‘reverse causality’ (Ioannidis et 611., 2009), whereby the
exposure comes as a result of the disease. One example of this
includes healthy eating behavior after disease diagnosis, leading
to associations between nutrient factors and the disease. While we
have attempted to minimize these biases through linear adjustement
and sensitivity analyses as described previously (Patel et 611., 2010;
Patel et 611., 2012), we cannot conclude that these factors are indeed
causal.

On the other hand, presence of biological interactions between
a genetic and environmental factor may be indicative of a
causal relationship between the environmental factor and disease
(Davey Smith, 2010). Here, we propose how to generate such

interaction candidates. Validation of interaction of such candidates
will strengthen the evidence for our EWAS—derived hypotheses.

The public availability of genetic association and representative
environmental data may allow for quick adoption by investigators
to create etiological interaction hypotheses using existing cohorts.
However, there are some limitations to these data. First, the
majority of GWAS have occurred among populations of Caucasian
ancestry and there is need for GWAS in other ancestral groups.
For environmental measures the NHANES is a unique resource,
containing a large number of phenotypic and environmental
information on a population representative of the USA. However, it
is but one source, and we lack access to other populations. Further,
the environmental measures selected by the Centers of Disease
Control and Prevention reﬂect prevalent exposures, but they are
only a subset of the ‘exposome’ (Wild, 2005). Last, the NHANES
participants represent non—institutionalized individuals and less
prevalent diseases with hypothesized environmental inﬂuences, such
as T1D, are not characterized in these surveys. Other methods to
select candidate exposures may be employed, such as mining the
biomedical literature (Liu et 611., 2009; Schmidt—Kastner et 611., 2012).

As any other curated database, the information in the CTD may
be biased toward genes or chemicals that are known to take part in
some toxicological or biological response. For example, the most
cited gene and gene product in the CTD includes the cytochrome
P450 class of genes (e. g. CYP1A1), known to play a role in chemical
metabolism. Similarly, ‘endocrine disrupting’ chemicals such as
estrogens and dioxins are among most highly cited chemicals in
the CTD.

Of course, one may manually peruse databases like CTD to come
up with candidate lists of environmental factors that interact with
genes of interest. However, by integrating EWAS, investigators
can simultaneously identify prevalent environmental factors and
quantify its main effect. Both exposure prevalence and degree
of effect are critical factors for public health. In short, we have
described a method to choose candidate interacting pairs that bridges
population relevance with toxicological evidence.

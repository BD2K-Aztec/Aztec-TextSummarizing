Abstract

Motivation: The 3D structure of the genome plays a critical role in regulating gene expression.
Recent progress in mapping technologies for chromatin interactions has led to a rapid increase in
this kind of interaction data. This trend will continue as research in this burgeoning field intensifies.
Results: We describe the 4DGenome database that stores chromatin interaction data compiled
through comprehensive literature curation. The database currently covers both low— and high—
throughput assays, including 3C, 4C—Seq, 5C, Hi—C, ChlA—PET and Capture—C. To complement the
set of interactions detected by experimental assays, we also include interactions predicted by a re—
cently developed computational method with demonstrated high accuracy. The database currently
contains N8 million records, covering 102 cell/tissue types in five organisms. Records in the data—
base are described using a standardized file format, facilitating data exchange. The vast major of
the interactions were assigned a confidence score. Using the web interface, users can query and
download database records via a number of annotation dimensions. Query results can be visual—
ized along with other genomics datasets via links to the UCSC genome browser. We anticipate that
4DGenome will be a valuable resource for investigating the spatial structure—and—function relation—
ship of genomes.

Availability and Implementation: 4Dgenome is freely accessible at http://4dgenome.int—med.
uiowa.edu. The database and web interface are implemented in MySQL, Apache and JavaScript
with all major browsers supported.

1 Introduction

Determining the 3D structure of the genome and its impact on gene
expression and other DNA transactions has been a long—standing
question in cell biology. The pioneering method of chromosome
conformation capture (3C) determines the relative frequency of dir—
ect physical contact between a pair of linearly separated chromatin
segments (Dekker et 61]., 2002). By coupling 3C With short—read
sequencing technology, chromosome conformation capture—on—chip
(4C—Seq) (Splinter et 61]., 2011; Stadhouders et 61]., 2013) and

chromosome conformation capture carbon copy (5 C) (Dostie et 61].,
2006) can detect genome—Wide interactions involving a single anchor
region and interactions involving multiple genomic regions, respect—
ively. The Hi—C protocol is a truly genome—Wide technology that
allows detection of all interactions in the genome. The ChIA-PET
protocol (Fullwood et 61]., 2009) combines the principles of 3C and
chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to identify chromatin inter-
actions mediated by protein factors. Most recently, the Capture—C
method (Hughes et 61]., 2014) combines oligonucleotide capture

technology, 3C and short—read sequencing and enables researchers
to interrogate cis interactions at hundreds of selected loci at high
resolution in a single assay.

Application of these genome—wide assays in recent years has led
to a dramatic increase in chromatin interaction data. This rapid in-
crease in data has spurred the development of specialized databases
to document chromatin interactions. However, existing databases
only store interactions detected by either Hi—C (Li et al., 2014) or by
5C, ChIA-PET and Hi—C (Zhou et al., 2013). As a result, they miss a
large number of interactions detected by other commonly used high—
throughput methods, such as 4C and Capture—C. They also miss
interactions detected by 3C, which tend to have higher quality and
thus is very useful as the gold standard for a variety of purposes.
Besides experimental assays, computational methods are (Corradin
et al., 2014; Ernst and Kellis, 2010; He et al., 2014; Thurman et al.,
2012) being continuously improved to predict chromatin inter—
actions. In particular, the recently developed method, integrated
method for predicting enhancer targets (IM—PET), has been demon—
strated to have comparable accuracy as the 5C assay (He et al.,
2014). Currently, there is a lack of a comprehensive depository for
chromatin interactions identified by all major technologies. This dis—
persion of information hinders standardization, sharing and integra—
tion of the interaction data, which are critical for gaining insights
into genome structure/function relationships.

Towards this goal, we have developed the 4DGenome database,
a general repository for chromatin interactions. Records in
4D Genome are compiled through comprehensive literature curation
of experimentally derived interactions. The database currently cov—
ers both low— and high—throughput assays, including 3C, 4C—Seq,
5C, Hi-C, ChIA—PET and Capture—C. The database also includes
computational predictions made by the IM-PET algorithm (He
et al., 2014) that integrates multiple types of genomic features to
predict interactions between enhancers and promoters.

2 Materials and methods

2.1 Curation of chromatin interaction data

We conducted an extensive search of primary literature in the NCBI
PubMed database, dating back to the original publication of 3C
method in 2002 (Dekker et al., 2002). We used the following key
words to conduct the literature search: ‘chromatin interaction’,
‘chromosome conformation capture’, ‘3C’, ‘4C’, ‘4C—Seq’, ‘5 C’, ‘Hi—
C’, ‘Capture—C’, ‘genome and 3D’, ‘enhancer—promoter interaction’
and ‘chromosome domain’.

We curated interactions with the following considerations in
mind: (i) each record in the database should have a score represent—
ing the statistical confidence of the interaction. Because statistical
analysis of chromatin interactions is a fast moving research area, we
chose to report two types of confidence measures: those reported by
study authors and those computed by a different method from the
study but has shown improved accuracy. We reasoned that the au—
thors of individual studies knew their data best and had done their
best to report high quality interactions. On the other hand, as part
of our ongoing development effort, as the field matures, we will
periodically update the confidence scores using the best approach or
using consensus scores from top approaches. We believe our strategy
of reporting two confidence scores both maintains the historical
context of the data and offers the ﬂexibility of improving data anno-
tation as the field moves forward with the development of more ac—
curate statistical methods. To this end, we have used the Fit—Hi—C

method (Ay et al., 2014) to compute a second confidence scores for

all Hi-C interactions in the database. For interactions detected by
4C, 5C, Hi-C, ChIA—PET and Capture—C, since no methods other
than those used by the study authors were shown to be better, we
temporarily used author—reported confidence scores for both types
of confidence scores. To help users better understand how the inter—
actions were obtained from raw data, we have summarized the stat—
istical method used in each study in Supplementary Table S1. (ii) If
an interaction was detected using one of the short—read—sequencing—
based methods, its contact frequency should be reported. (iii) We
only included interaction data with a resolution (size of the interact—
ing genomic loci) of 10 000 bp or higher, given the lengths of most
functional DNA elements (e.g. promoter, enhancer, insulator, silen—
cer) are shorter than 10 000 bp.

For interactions identified by 3C, there is no contact frequency or
confidence measure. We thus just documented the interactions per 56.
For high—throughput assays (4C—Seq, 5 C, ChIA—PET, Hi—C, Capture—
C), we reported both contact frequency and confidence scores for the
interactions. For computational predictions made by the IM—PET
method, there is no measured contact frequency and we only reported
the probability of the interaction as the confidence score.

2.2 File format for chromatin interaction records

We devised a standardized text file format for recording chromatin
interactions. This file format is similar to formats used by many pro—
tein—protein interaction databases, such as the BioGrid (Chatr—
Aryamontri et al., 2013) database. The standardized file format will
facilitate future data exchange among databases. The data format is
also recognizable by the widely used network visualization tool,
Cytoscape (Saito et al., 2012), making it straightforward to visualize
chromatin interactions using this powerful tool. Each record con—
tains 15 tab—delimited columns (Supplementary Fig. S1): columns
1—6 describe the genomic coordinates of the interacting regions; col—
umns 7—8 describe genes (if any) that are located in the interacting
regions; columns 9—10 describe the organism and cell/tissue types
from which the interaction was derived; column 11—14 describe the
detection method, confidence scores, and contact frequency for the
observed interaction; column 15 provides the PubMed ID of
the publication that reported the interaction.

2.3 Database architecture and web interface

We have implemented the popular LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL
and PHP) architecture (Supplementary Fig. S2), which uses 100%
open source software to build the heavy—duty dynamic database
backend. The user interface was implemented using JavaScript and
Cascading Styling Sheets (CSS) languages and has been tested on all
major internet browsers, including Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer
and Chrome. The current database server runs on a linux worksta—
tion with a 3.0G dual—core CPU and 3.6G RAM.

3 Results

The current release of 4DGenome contains 4 433 071 experimen-
tally derived and 3 605 176 computationally predicted interactions
across 102 cell/tissue types in five organisms. Figure 1A and 1B
show the percentages of interactions by organism and detection
method, respectively. In terms of data resolution, currently Hi-C
data have the lowest resolution, followed by 5C, 4C-Seq, ChIA-PET
and Capture—C (Fig. 1C). As sequencing becomes deeper, we antici—
pate that resolutions of the interaction data will improve (especially
Hi—C data) although their theoretical limits are determined by the
choice of the restriction enzyme used in the assays. In terms of

genomic distance of interacting regions, current 4C—Seq and 5C data
tend to capture interactions separated by longer genomic distance
(Fig. 1D). This likely reflects the choices of genomic regions interro—
gated in the 5C and 4C—Seq studies instead of the inherent properties
of these assays. Additional summary statistics regarding the data—
base is presented in Supplementary Table S2.

3.1 The database web interface

4DGenome can be accessed via the web site http://4dgenome.int—
med.uiowa.edu. The user can query database records by a number
of annotation dimensions, download database records and view a
summary statistics for each dataset (Supplementary Fig. S3).

3.2 Database query

We provide two modes to query the database: query by genomic re—
gions and query by genes. Up to 10 genomic regions or genes can be
inputted in the query box. For query by genomic regions, the gen—
omic coordinates of the region can be provided in the input text
box, using the same format as that used in the UCSC genome
browser, e.g. chr1:1000—20 000. For query by genes, RefSeq gene
symbols or Ensembl gene IDs can be used. Wild card is accepted in
this query mode. Using the dropdown boxes, the user can retrieve
interactions that match specific combination of organism, cell/tissue
type and detection method.

Besides using the input box, users can also conduct batch queries
by uploading a tab—delimited text file. Up to 100 genomic regions or
genes can be included in each text file. Each row of the file contains a
query region or gene. For query by genomic regions, the first three col—
umns of the file (chromosome number, left genomic coordinate, right
genomic coordinate) are required. For query by genes, the first col—
umn of the file (gene symbol or ID) is required. Additional columns
are allowed in the files but are not used during the search.

In the query by regions mode, to retrieve database records that
overlap with the query, an overlapping criterion is needed. Currently,
we use two overlapping rules: ‘Any overlap’ and ‘Center overlap’
(Supplementary Fig. S4). ‘Any overlap’ is a loose measure which only

requires the query region to overlap with either of two interacting re—
gions by at least 1 bp. ‘Center overlap’ is more stringent and requires
the center—to—center distance between the query and record regions to
be less than half of the length of the smaller region. In other words,
this means the smaller genomic region (either query or record) is en—
compassed inside the larger region.

3.3 Understanding the query result

Retrieved records can be downloaded as a tab—delimited text file
(Fig. 2A top). The output file can be directly imported into a number
of programming languages for further analyses, such as R. To facili—
tate comparison of database content over time, the file name con-
tains the date when the query is performed. Query results are also
shown on the ‘Search Results’ page. Interaction records are grouped
by detection methods and are shown as tables (Fig. 2A bottom).
Under each detection method, the user can use the ‘Details’ button
to toggle between summary and detailed views of each record. By
default, each viewing window shows 20 rows of the table. Users can
navigate through the pages by clicking on the page numbers at the
bottom of each viewing window.

3.4 Display of interactions along with additional
genomics datasets

To facilitate data interpretation and integration, interactions can be
displayed (via the magnifying glass icon next to each record) in the
UCSC genome browser, providing additional functional views of the
interactions (Fig. 2B). Interactions are color—coded by their detection
methods. Confidence scores of the interactions are encoded by the
shade of the color. The custom interaction track can be displayed
along with a vast array of annotation tracks available in the genome
browser. By default, we only display gene annotation track, chroma—
tin modification and accessibility, transcription factor ChIP—Seq
tracks generated by the encyclopedia of DNA elements (ENCODE)
project, and genomic sequence conservation track.

3.5 Export database records

We have organized the interactions into downloadable files by or—
ganisms and detection methods to suit different needs of the users.
These files will be constantly updated at each release of the data—
base. Data can be downloaded either from the database webpage or
by anonymous FTP.

3.6 An example user case

Accumulating evidence suggests that chromatin interactions are
highly dynamic across cell types and developmental stages. To inves—
tigate this issue systematically, we used the chromatin interaction
data across multiple human and mouse cell types stored in
4D Genome. For each gene, we counted its total number of interac—
tors across all cell types and its unique number of interactors (i.e.
occur only in one cell type). We then computed the ratio of the num—
ber of unique interactions versus the number of the total inter—
actions. Larger ratio means the gene tends to interact with different
sets of loci across cell types, suggesting that its interaction with other
genomic loci is more dynamic. As shown in Figure 3A, the median
ratios are approximately 0.8 for both human and mouse cell types.
Thus the systematic analysis further confirmed the notion that chro—
matin interactions are highly dynamic across cell types. Figure 3B
shows an example of dynamic chromatin interactions involving the
gene MLLT4 across three human cell types, MCF—7, K562
and IMR90. Interactions in MCF—7 and K562 were detected by
ChIA-PET; whereas interactions in IMR90 were detected by Hi—C.

The thickness of the arcs is proportional to the confidence score of
the interactions. As can be seen, there are both shared and unique
interactions among the three cell types. Some of unique interactions
may be due to difference in the detection methods. However,

even for interactions in MCF—7 and K5 62 cells, which were gener—
ated using the same method and by the same group (Li et al., 2012),
there are still interactions unique to each cell type, suggesting that
these interactions truly reﬂect the dynamics of chromatin
interactions.

4 Discussion

Two alternative tools have been developed before. However, they ei—
ther only curate a particular data type, Hi—C (Li et al., 2014) or is
specialized for visualizing interactions (Zhou et al., 2013). To the
best of our knowledge, 4D Genome is the first database that compre—
hensively document and curate chromatin interactions generated by
both experimental and computational approaches. Another unique
feature of 4Dgenome is that it provides contact frequency and confi—
dence measure for each interaction, whenever such a measure is pos—
sible. As a result, interactions can be prioritized in various analyses.
Interactions documented in 4DGenome were detected using differ—
ent experimental technologies. Although these technologies rely on
similar molecular biology principle, caveats need to be taken when
comparing interactions involving the same loci but generated by

different technologies. On the other hand, if an interaction involving
the same loci is detected by multiple technologies, it increases our
confidence in the interaction. In the future, integraing interactions
detected by different technologies in a statistical sound way should
be an important research area.

We anticipate that 4DGenome will be a valuable resource for
investigating the spatial structure—and—function relationship of gen-
omes as research in this burgeoning area intensifies. We envision
that a wide range of investigations will benefit from a carefully cura-
ted database such as 4DGenome. A few examples include standard—
ization and benchmarking of interaction data qualities by different
detection technologies, relationship between genome 3D structure
and epigenetic state, dynamics of chromatin interaction across cell/
tissue types and organisms, and genome 3D structure and patho—
genic genetic variations.

Besides continued curation effort to add new interactions, our
future research will focus on two areas in order to improve the qual—
ity and utility of database records. First, we plan to improve the inte—
gration of 4DGenome with other molecular interaction databases,
such as BioGrid and STRING. Second, we plan to conduct system—
atic comparisons to identify and apply the most accurate means to
assign confidence measures to interaction data generated by differ—
ent technologies.

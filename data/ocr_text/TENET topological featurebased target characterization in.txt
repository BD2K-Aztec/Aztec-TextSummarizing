Abstract

Motivation: Target characterization for a biochemical network is a heuristic evaluation process that
produces a characterization model that may aid in predicting the suitability of each molecule for
drug targeting. These approaches are typically used in drug research to identify novel potential
targets using insights from known targets. Traditional approaches that characterize targets based
on their molecular characteristics and biological function require extensive experimental study of
each protein and are infeasible for evaluating larger networks with poorly understood proteins.
Moreover, they fail to exploit network connectivity information which is now available from
systems biology methods. Adopting a network—based approach by characterizing targets using
network features provides greater insights that complement these traditional techniques. To this
end, we present TENET (Target charactErization using NEtwork Topology), a network—based
approach that characterizes known targets in signalling networks using topological features.
Results: TENET first computes a set of topological features and then leverages a support vector
machine—based approach to identify predictive topological features that characterizes known
targets. A characterization model is generated and it specifies which topological features are
important for discriminating the targets and how these features should be combined to quantify
the likelihood of a node being a target. We empirically study the performance of TENET from a wide
variety of aspects, using several signalling networks from BioModels with real—world curated out—
comes. Results demonstrate its effectiveness and superiority in comparison to state—of—the—art
approaches.

1 Introduction

 

Complex intra- and inter-cellular signalling drives various biological
processes, such as growth, proliferation and apoptosis within
systems. In systems biology, these molecular interactions are
typically modelled as signalling networks (Klamt et 61]., 2009) that

provide a holistic view of the various interactions between different
molecular players in the system. As signalling networks become
an increasingly acceptable way for representing biological systems,
various network-based computational techniques have been
developed to analyze these networks with the goal of

answering biological needs, such as target characterization (Chua
et al., 2014) and target discovery (Yang et al., 2008). In this article,
we focus on the target characterization problem for signalling
networks.

Target characterization identifies characteristics (e.g. topological
features) that distinguishes targets (i.e. nodes) from other nodes in
the network. These characteristics can be summarized as models
which we refer to as characterization models. Traditionally, targets
are characterized based on their molecular characteristics [e.g. struc—
ture and binding sites of targets (Maira et al., 2008)] and biological
function [e.g. regulation of apoptosis (Yan et al., 2013)]. These trad—
itional approaches focus primarily on the target alone and are oblivi—
ous to the presence of other interacting molecules in the system.
However, understanding how a target interacts with other molecules
in a biological system may provide valuable and holistic insights for
superior target characterization. For example, the degree centrality
of a target may be leveraged to assess potential toxicity of targets as
high degree nodes tend to be involved in essential protein—protein
interactions (He et al., 2006) and are potentially toxic as a result. In
particular, network-based target characterization techniques can ex—
ploit such topological features for superior characterization of
targets.

Recently, there have been increasing efforts toward devising net—
work—based target characterization techniques (Hwang et al., 2008;
Zhang et al., 2010; McDermott et al., 2012). These methods focus
on using topological features to characterize targets of protein—
protein interaction (PPI) networks. Specifically, McDermott et al.
(2012) performed characterization of targets in protein co-
ahundance networks [The protein co-ahundance networks are
essentially protein—protein interaction (PPI) networks constructed by
identifying highly differentially regulated proteins from proteomics
data using specific filters.] using several topological features such as
degree centrality. Although this study suggests that multiple topo—
logical features can be combined for superior target characteriza—
tion, it did not explore how these topological features should be
combined towards this goal. In contrast, Hwang et al. (2008) con—
cluded that bridging centrality is useful in identifying targets in PPI
networks. However, the complexity and diversity of biological
networks make target characterization using a single feature chal—
lenging as in some networks the chosen feature may perform poorly.
Indeed, Chua et al. (2014) showed that bridging centrality performs
well in the MAPK-PI3K network, but not in the glucose metabolism
network. Zhang et al. (2010) proposed the use of machine learning
techniques such as support vector machines (SVM) and logistic regres—
sion for characterizing known targets in a manually curated human
PPI network using 15 topological features. In contrast to McDermott
et al. (2012), their goal was to identify topological characteristics of
drug targets in general, instead of for specific diseases. However,
characterizing targets in general assumes that targets of different dis—
eases share similar target characteristics, which may not always be
true. Indeed, as we shall see in Section 3, known targets in signalling
networks tend to be characterized by different sets of topological
features. Consequently, target characterization based on individual
disease—specific networks may yield better characterization that is
specific to the disease.

A common thread running through the aforementioned target
characterization techniques is their focus on PPI networks.
Surprisingly, similar systematic study in curated signalling networks
has been lacking in the literature. Compared to signalling networks,
PPI networks may contain many false—positive PPI in the sense that al—
though these proteins can truly physically bind they may never do so
inside cells due to different localization or they are not

simultaneously expressed. Furthermore, PPI networks are static. That
is, the edges in PPI networks are undirected; there is neither ﬂow of
information nor mass between nodes. Hence, they lack of know—
ledge of the underlying mechanism (i.e. actual signal ﬂow) causing
the disease. As network quality directly affects the results of net—
work—based target characterization, the aforementioned limitations
of PPI networks may adversely impact the search for superior charac—
teristics of targets. Signalling networks, however, model the dy—
namic interaction of the biological systems and present an attractive
alternative to PPI networks.

In our recent work (Chua et al., 2014), we took the first step to
demonstrate how signalling networks can be effectively leveraged to
identify topological features that are discriminative of targets using
the Wilcoxon test. However, similar to McDermott et al. (2012),
this work does not shed any insight on a predictive model to com—
bine these features for identifying potential targets. In this article,
we address this limitation by presenting TENET (Target
charactErization using NEtwork Topology), a network—based ap—
proach that characterizes known targets in signalling networks using
topological features. Specifically, we use an SVM—based approach to
identify the set of topological features (referred to as predictive topo-
logical features) that characterizes known targets and to generate a
characterization model using these features. The model specifies
which topological features are important for discriminating the tar-
gets and how these features should be combined to produce a quan—
titative score that identifies the likelihood of a node being a target.
In particular, TENET uses feature selection to select predictive topo-
logical features and weighted misclassification cost (WMC) to handle
SVM training issues such as noisy labels and imbalanced data. Our
empirical study on four real—world curated signalling networks dem—
onstrates the effectiveness and superiority of TENET.

2 Materials and methods

2.1 Terminology

A biological signalling network can be modelled as a directed hyper—
graph G = (V, E) (Klamt et al., 2009) where the nodes V represent
molecules (e.g. proteins) and the hyperedges E represent biochemical
reactions and processes. A hyperedge connects one node set U to an—
other W, where U, W Q V. For instance, in the activation of ERK, the
set U in the hyperedge consists of ERK and its kinase, phosphorylated
MEK whereas W contains the phosphorylated ERK (ERKPP). Analysis of
directed hypergraphs is generally more complex than graphs and
many graph algorithms cannot be used directly on hypergraphs.
Hence, they are often transformed into graphs containing simple
edges for analysis. Methods (e.g. bipartite and substrate graph repre—
sentation) exist for such transformation (Klamt et al., 2009). In this
article, we use the bipartite graph representation as it retains the ori—
ginal information of the hypergraph (Klamt et al., 2009). Signalling
networks generally contain characteristics such as feedback and
feedforward loops, which are common in complex regulatory con-
trol (Kwon et al., 2008). These loops in turn give rise to graph char—
acteristics, such as strongly connected components (SCC).

The activity of nodes in the signalling network is generally gov-
erned by complex interconnectivity of various nodes in the same net—
work. We refer to a node as a candidate target if when perturbed, it
modulates the activity of a specific node (referred to as output
node). An output node is a protein that is either involved in some
biological processes which may be deregulated, resulting in mani-
festation of a disease, or be of interest due to its potential role in the
disease. For instance, in the MAPK-PI3K network (Hatakeyama et al.,

2003) that is often implicated in cancer, ERKPP can be considered as
an output node due to its role in proliferation. Given a signalling
network G = (V, E) and an output node x E V, let the set of nodes
having a path leading to x be denoted as VX Q V. Then, the set of
candidate target nodes in G relevant to x is denoted as TX Q VX.

Network—based analysis can be applied to signalling networks to
study the characteristics and properties of these networks. In this
article, we examine a total of 16 topological features that are sum—
marized in Table 1. These features are selected based on their role in
measuring relative importance of a node in a signalling network.
The formal definitions as well as motivation for selecting these fea—
tures are given in Chua et al. (2014) (also detailed in Supplementary
Material 81.1).

2.2 Topological feature—based target characterization
Intuitively, the goal of topological feature—based target characteriza—
tion is to use a set of predictive topological features to characterize
known targets in a network. Hence, the topological feature-
based target characterization problem can be formulated as a super—
vised learning problem. In a supervised learning problem, a training
set {(xi, f is given where f is the predictor of x,- and the
goal is to learn some target function f : X —> Y which can be applied
to predict unseen data w. The problem can be subdivided into two
categories: regression when the predictor yields a continuous out—
come and classification when the outcome is discrete. A regression
problem can be converted into a binary classification problem by
specifying a threshold h and assigning x,- with f greater than h to one
class and the remaining to the other class. We advocate that the
topological feature-based target characterization problem is best
represented as a regression problem. In this problem, we are inter-
ested in finding out how likely one node is a target relative to
another node based on a set of predictive topological features. This
is different from the target classification problem where we want to
find out the class membership of a node. Note that the regression
problem can be converted into a classification problem by specifying
a threshold h and assigning nodes having target function greater
than h to the target class and the rest to the non—target class.

Although we examine 16 topological features, as we shall see
later, not all features are relevant to a given signalling network. In
fact, incorporating irrelevant features may adversely impact the per—
formance of the prediction model. Hence, it is important to learn a
set of predictive topological features that best characterizes targets
(referred to as topological feature selection) for a given network.
Formally, it is defined as follows.

Definition 1: Given a signalling network G = (V, E) and an out-
put node x E V, let Tx Q V and 26,11 denote the set of known targets
in G relevant to x, and the set of topological features of G, respect-
ively. Then, the goal of ‘topological feature selection’ is to find a set
of ‘predictive topological features’ .7: Q 26,11 that maximizes the pre-
diction accuracy for f(f(u, 7:» subject to the following conditions:

f(f(u,.7:)) = 1 whenuE TX, (1)
f(f(u,.7-')) : 0 otherwise.
Then the topological feature-based target characterization prob-
lem is formally defined as follows.

Definition 2: Given a signalling network G = (V, E), an output
node x E V, TX, and 26,11, let .7: denote the set of predictive topo-
logical features. Then, for a threshold h, the goal of the ‘topological
feature-based target characterization problem’ is to identify a set of

Definition 2, there is no need to explicitly specify a threshold h if we
are only interested in obtaining the relative rankings of the nodes.
The threshold is required if we want to assign class labels (e.g. target
class) to the nodes.

2.3 SVM—based target characterization

We employ support vector classification (SVC) to select predictive
topological features and support vector regression (SVR) to generate
the characterization model. The SVC and SVR are typically formulated
as constrained optimization problems and solved using the
Lagrangian multiplier method. In general, SVM models contain mul—
tiple parameters, such as the cost parameter C and parameters
related to the kernel function, that affect the learning and perform-
ance of the models (Chapelle et al., 2002). We follow the method in
Hsu et al. (2003) for training the SVM. The feature values are scaled
linearly to the range of [0, 1] for each signalling network to avoid
features with larger ranges dominating those with smaller ranges.
We use stratified (The training data were sampled from the original
data such that the ratio of the targets to non—targets is similar to that
of the original data.) cross—validation (Supplementary Material 81.
3) and grid—search (Hsu et al., 2003) on the training data to identify
the best values of the model parameters. Note that cross—validation
helps us to avoid the issue of overfitting the data whereas stratifica—
tion enables us to keep the percentage of targets in the different folds
similar to the original dataset. The best parameter is the one that
yields the best average prediction accuracy for the cross—validation
process. Wherever possible (In our study, we set a lower bound of

validation as larger fold numbers reduce pessimistic bias and
10-folds generally give good performances (Kohavi et al., 1995).

Several non—trivial issues, namely, irrelevant or redundant fea—
tures, noisy labels and imbalanced dataset, need to be addressed in
training the SVM model for characterizing targets. In particular, we
use feature selection to select for appropriate features to be used in
the SVM model and cost—sensitive learning to handle the issue of
noisy labels and imbalanced dataset. We examine three feature se—
lection approaches, namely, backward stepwise elimination (BSE)
(Marill et al., 1963), Wilcoxon—ROC based elimination (WRE)
and WRE—BSE. BSE is classifier-aware whereas WRE is classifier-
independent. WRE-BSE which performs WRE followed by BSE is a
hybrid approach. Note that compared to classifier—independent
methods, classifier—aware methods interact with the classifiers and
such interaction can lead to better classification results (Saeys
et al., 2007). However, they are typically computationally expen-
sive and run the risk of model—overfitting. Cost sensitive learning is
an algorithmic approach that chooses an appropriate strategy spe—
cific to the classifier to overcome the bias introduced by imbal—
anced data and the noise caused by uncertainty in labelling. We
use WMC, an approach that proportionates the misclassification
cost of the training data according to class. In particular, we use a
variable C,- as the cost parameter C:

CJr if y,- +1

Ci = (3)
C_  —1

subject to the constraints Cr —1— C‘ = 1, Cr > 0 and C‘ > 0 where
y,- is the class predictor and C+ and CT denote the misclassification
cost of the target and non—target classes, respectively.

2.4 The TENET algorithm

Given a signalling network G : (V,E), an output node x E V, a
known target set TX Q V, a set of topological features 26,11 and a
step—size of the misclassification cost 5, TENET identifies the set of
predictive structural features and a characterization model that best
characterizes these known targets. Note that 26,111 and s are optional
inputs and are set to default values (26,11 is set to the 16 topological
features given in Table 1 whereas 5 is set to 0.1.) if they are not
given. The known targets Tx can be extracted by following the cur—
ation process described in Chua et al. (2014) (Supplementary
Material 812). The TENET algorithm comprised three phases,
namely, the pruning phase, the feature extraction phase and the
model training phase. First, the pruning phase identifies relevant
nodes (denoted as Vcandidate) that shall be used for training the SVM.
Then, the feature extraction phase extracts all the topological
features (denoted as 26,111) of each candidate node and stores them in
a |Vcandidate| >< |Xa11| matrix H. Finally, in the model training phase,
TENET learns the optimal set of predictive topological features .7: and
the best model parameters of the characterization model M.

We shall now describe these phases in turn. The formal algorithm is
given in Supplementary Material 81.4.

2.4.1 Phase 1: Pruning

In this phase, TENET prunes nodes that do not have paths leading to
the output node x. This phase yields a set of potential candidate
nodes Vcandidate C V and is used to reduce the subsequent computa—
tion. In the pruning process, the given network G is first prepro—
cessed into a bipartite graph and then converted into a directed
acyclic graph (DAG), a graph with consistent topological ordering, to
facilitate indexing of nodes. Note that the node indices shall be used
subsequently to perform reachability check to identify the nodes to
be pruned. We adopt the method in Engelfiet et al. (1990) for bipart—
ite graph conversion. In order to convert the bipartite graph into its
DAG representation, we adopt the approach in Tarjan et al. (1972) to
identify SCCS and replace each SCC with a representative node
(referred to as meta node). Then, we adopt the indexing approach of
Chen et al. (2005) to index the DAG. This indexing approach per-
forms depth—first traversal to assign each node v a preorder index
(when v is first visited) and a postorder index (when all descendent
nodes of v are visited). Finally, an index—based reachability algo—
rithm is used to determine whether there exists a path from each
node v to the output node x (denoted as v —> x). Given a node v and
x, let w be the descendent of v that is not in the spanning tree
(referred to as non-spanning tree node) and v.preorder and v.postor-
der denote the preorder and postorder indexes of v, respectively.
A path v —> x exists if any of the following conditions are satisfied
(Chen et al., 2005):

1. v.preorder g x.preorder and v.postorder Z x.postorder.
2. w.preorder g x.preorder and w.postorder Z x.postorder.

Note that the pruning step is beneficial in improving execution time
for larger sparsely connected networks and for output node that are
positioned further upstream. For instance, in the MAPK-PI3K network,
no nodes are pruned when we select ERKPP (downstream) as the out—
put node whereas 17 nodes (47.2%) are pruned when activated Ras
(Raserp) (upstream) is selected.

2.4.2 Phase 2: Feature extraction
In this phase, for all nodes in Vcandl’date, TENET extracts all the topo—
logical features in Table 1 for characterizing the known targets.

2.4.3 Phase 3: Model training

Given a matrix of topological feature values H, a target set Tx and a
step—size of the misclassification cost 5, this phase identifies a set of
predictive topological features .7: and the best parameters for config-
uring the characterization model M. First, the misclassification cost
of the target class C+ is initialized to a default value of 0.5. Then,
feature selection is used to obtain the predictive topological feature
set .7-'. We iterate over three different feature selection approaches
(BSE, WRE and WRE-BSE). Next, the step—size s is used to step through
the range of misclassification cost (0—1). In each iteration, the mis—
classification cost of the target class C+ is incremented according to
the number of iterations completed, before the SVM training is per-
formed to obtain the parameter settings of the characterization
model M with the best accuracy.

The BSE approach is a well—known greedy approach that progres—
sively removes features from the naive SVM model (built using all
topological features) and trains a new best model after each feature
removal. The elimination process stops when removal of additional
features results in a worse average accuracy of the validation set

prediction. In contrast, the WRE approach performs two statistical
tests, namely, one—tailed Wilcoxon Rank—Sum (referred to as
Wilcoxon) and receiver operating characteristics (referred to
as ROC). The results are used to eliminate features that do not dis—
criminate between targets and non—targets in a significant manner
(based on Wilcoxon) and that do not classify targets well (based on
ROC). Note that we perform two 1—tailed Wilcoxon tests and for
each test; P—values smaller than 0.05 are considered significant.
Hence, we take the difference of the P—values for both test hypothe—
ses (referred to as P—value difference) and remove features with
P—value difference less than 0.9. For the ROC analysis, features with
AUC less than 0.7 (Hosmer Jr et al., 2004) are considered poor per—
formers and are removed. The best characterization model is found
by training the SVM using the remaining features. The WRE-BSE
approach first performs WRE followed by BSE.

The worst—case time complexity of TENET is O((|V| —l—  —l— 0
(906,10) —1—  where 906,11) is the worst—case time complex—
ity for extracting the features and  is the worst—case time
complexity of the feature selection method used. Note that in this
article, g(xau) = O(|V|3) whereas O(T(-)) = ogxamz x k x |V|3)
(for BSE) where k is the number of iterations required for the grid—
search. Proofs are given in Supplementary Material 81.5.

3 Results and discussion

TENET is implemented using Java. We shall now present the experi—
ments conducted to study the performance of TENET and report
some of the results here (additional results are given in
Supplementary Material). The experiments are performed on a com—
puter system using a 64—bit operating system with 8 GB RAM and a
dual core processor running at 3.60 GHz. We characterize four sig—
nalling networks (referred to as individual networks) in BioModels
(Il—I4 in Table 2) and a combined network that is generated by
iteratively performing a union of the nodes and edges in individual
networks. The resulting combined network is a graph consisting of
four disconnected (The node and edge sets of the individual
networks are disjoint.) subgraphs, each representing one individual
network. For the combined network, we use each of the signalling
network as the test set in turn (C1—C4 in Table 2) and examine the
effects of generating characterization models from individual
networks and from the combined network. Pruning in TENET is
performed on each individual network within the combined net—
work. Supplementary Material Sl.3 describes the generation of the
training and test data. Note that in all our experiments, we use
the linear kernel as it yielded the same accuracy as other kernels but
is faster to train (Supplementary Material 81.7.1). We study
different variants of TENET (Table 3) by varying the SVM training
approach.

3.1 Performance metrics

We evaluate the performance of TENET based on prediction accuracy
[The accuracy for the validation and test sets are denoted as ¢X(val)
and ¢X(test), respectively, where X indicates the method used for
training the SVM model. Average prediction accuracy is denoted as 6]
(¢), sensitivity (TPR), specificity (TNR) and precision (PPV) of the gener—
ated characterization models using the same training and test set. The

 

. . . . _ tp+tn _ tp _ tn
definitions are as follows. ¢——tp+m+fp+fn, TPR_—tp+fn, TNR—fp+tn and
PPVztptffp where tp, tn, fp and fn denote true positive, true negative,

false positive and false negative prediction, respectively. Note that PPV
is set to 0 when the classifier did not make any positive prediction.
We include an additional metric feature reduction factor (FRF) to

compare the performance of the feature selection methods. Formally,

FRF : 1—[2'1 where 26,11 is the entire set of features considered in the

 

study. Theaperformance of different characterization models is com—
pared using an integrated performance score (This score can be modi—
fied according to the needs of the application.) 73: ZlneMvalm
where M : {¢(val), ¢(test), TPR, TNR, PPV} and valm is the value of
metric m. Note that a larger score indicates better performance.

3.2 Feature selection

First, we examine the performance of different feature selection
approaches (TENET-B, TENET-R and TENET-H) and compare it with
TENET-naive for different signalling networks. Note that in this set
of experiments, we study the effect of the feature selection
approaches in isolation. The effect of incorporating WMC into the
SVM shall be investigated later. Table 4 reports the predictive feature
sets for each network using different approaches. In total, 24 experi-
ments were conducted as there are three feature selection methods
and eight networks (Il—I4 and C1—C4). Amongst these 24 experi-
ments, 25% of the predictive feature sets consist of only one feature
whereas the remaining had multiple features (ranging from 4 to 15
features). This supports our previous observation (Chua et al.,
2014) that multiple features result in better prediction of known tar-
gets. Observe that in Table 4, bridging centrality is not always in the
predictive feature set (e.g. 12). Figure 2 plots the performances of dif-
ferent feature selection approaches. We can make several observa—
tions. First, no single approach performs consistently well on all
performance metrics. In fact, network topology plays an important
role in feature selection. For instance, I4 has extremely high density
of edges (ratio of edges to nodes) compared to other networks. The
connectivity features of such networks become less informative and
other features such as target downstream effect become more
important. Hence, the most appropriate feature selection approach
is dependent on the signalling network. However, we note that for
larger sized networks, a larger number of features are informative
(regardless of feature selection approach). This is perhaps because
larger networks provide greater richness of context and diversity of
structure in the sub—networks. As network sizes are growing and net—
work analysis demands applicability to larger networks, future
methods might benefit particularly from the use of multiple features.
Second, feature selection generally led to an improvement in predic-
tion accuracy (87.5% for validation dataset and 50% in test dataset)
over the naive approach. An exception is C4 in which feature selec—
tion resulted in poorer performance. In C4, the characterization
model is generated using Il, 12 and I3 as training data whereas I4 is
used as the test data. The characteristics of the known targets in the
training data may be quite different from that of the test data.
Indeed, from Table 4, we observe that bridging coefficient TC is
included in the predictive topological feature set of C4, but not in I4.
Including redundant features may lead to poorer performance.
Third, the models generally have high specificity due to imbalanced
dataset. Fourth, TENET—R has the best runtime performance, followed
by TENET-H and TENET-B. The poorer performance of TENET-B is due
to the interaction of the feature selection approach with the classifier
(classifier—aware approach) which is different from TENET-R where
the feature selection approach is a wrapper layer that sits on top of
the classifier. Finally, the size of the networks used for training af-
fects the runtime performance. In general, larger size networks
require longer runtime. In the Supplementary Material S1.7.6, we
report TENET’s performance on the human cancer signalling network
containing more than 2500 nodes.

3.3 Effect of varying WMC

Intuitively, when we vary the WMC, we expect that as the target mis—
classification cost C+ increases, the prediction accuracy, sensitivity,
specificity and precision would display a negative skewed, increas—
ing, decreasing and positive skewed distribution, respectively. This
is because a large C+ eventually results in a model that is likely
biased towards classifying data as targets. We noted the following
when the WMC was varied. First, amongst the individual networks,
only I3 (Fig. 3) displays the expected trends. This could be due to the
extreme small target size (1 or 2) in the test set that resulted in
extreme ﬂuctuations in the performance metrics and deviation from
the expected trends. Hence, the target size of the test set can have
significant impact on the observed results. Second, the performance
of the combined networks C1, C2 and C4 (Supplementary Material
S1.7.2) resembles that of I3, possibly due to the large size of I3 domi—
nating over other networks used for training. This implies large
training networks can have undue influence on the characterization
model. Third, sensitivity generally improves whereas specificity gen—
erally deteriorates when the target misclassification cost is set higher

than the non—target misclassification cost (CJr > CT). The choice of
an appropriate model depends on the application. Fourth, the pre—
diction accuracy tends to display a skewed distribution where accur—
acy initially increases (or remains constant) with increasing CT, and
then decreases with increasing CT. Fifth, individual networks and
combined networks behave differently. In individual networks, pre-
diction accuracy, sensitivity and precision generally improve when
C+ is set larger than C_. However, in combined networks, sensitiv—
ity improves whereas other performance criteria deteriorate when
C+ is set larger than C_. Hence, there is no single universal best
value of C7L and the choice of C7L depends on the network.

3.4 Best TENET variant

We identify the best TENET variant (Table 5) using the integrated
performance score ’P. We note the following. First, the best TENET
variant is network dependent. Second, variants incorporating both
WMC and feature selection generally perform well. Specifically, set-
ting C7L greater than CT led to better results. Third, TENET variants
based on individual networks (11 to I4) outperform that based on
combined networks (C1—C4). The poorer performance of the com—
bined networks may be due to insufficient number of training net-
works, inappropriate or insufficient features used for training or
that signalling networks by nature have distinct characteristics and
it is just not possible to have a generalized model. Finally, the pre-
dictive topological features differ across networks (Tables 4 and 5).
Hence, as we mentioned in Section 1, a single set of predictive topo—
logical features may not effectively characterize known targets in all
signalling networks. When we compare the results with that in our
previous work, we note that the set of predictive topological features
is different from the discriminative topological features (DTF) identi—
fied in Chua et al. (2014) although there was an overlap of at least
50% of the features (We consider only 11 to I3 and exclude I4 from
this comparison as no DTP was found at P—value less than 0.05). The
difference is due to the different approach used to identify the fea—
tures. The characterization models (We use SVM with WMC and WRE
to generate the characterization models.) generated by these DTFS
also yielded poorer average ROC (0.873) than that generated using
TENET (0.913) (Approach DIFFER in Fig. 4).

Fig. 4. Performance of different prioritization approaches

3.5 Comparison with state—of—the—a rt approaches

Recall that state—of—the—art techniques such as McDermott et al.
(2012), Zhang et al. (2010) and Hwang et al. (2008) focus on PPI
networks instead of signalling networks. To the best of our know—
ledge, there does not exist any target characterization technique for
signalling networks. However, one way to investigate the perform—
ance of TENET is to examine how well the characterization model
generated by it prioritizes known targets. Intuitively, target priori-
tization aims to rank the nodes according to their potential of being
a target based on some importance measures (e.g. gene expression
level; Chen et al., 2011). A more detailed exposure to the target pri—
oritization problem as well as how TENET is used to prioritize known
targets is given in Supplementary Material S1.6.

For our study, we compare TENET with several network-aware
target prioritization approaches, namely, random prioritization, LSA
(Gustafson et al., 1996) and NetworkPrioritizer (Kacprowski et al.,
2013). Comparison with network-unaware techniques as well as PPI
network—based techniques is reported in the Supplementary Material
S1.7.3 and S1.7.4, respectively.

In random prioritization, the nodes were randomly assigned a
rank in the range [1—|V|] where |V| is the number of nodes in the
network and we assume that no ranking ties are present. LSA was
performed using Copasi (Sahle et al., 2006) with the following con—
figuration: {task=sensitivities; subtask=time series; function=all
variables of the model; and variable=all parameter values}. We con—
sider both Weighted Borda Fuse (WBF) and Weighted AddScore Fuse
(WASP) in NetworkPrioritizer and consider all features provided.
Note that uniform weights were used for rank aggregation as we do
not have prior knowledge of the best weights or features to consider.
For TENET, we use the characterization model to generate prioritiza—
tion ranks of known targets. Specifically, we apply the SVM models
to obtain these ranks. The SVM type is set to e—SVR [In e—SVR, the error
function is an e—insensitive loss function and error smaller than c is
ignored (Chang et al., 2011).] with default 6 value (1 X 10_3) and
the SVM parameters are set according to the best models for each net—
work (Table 5 and Supplementary Material S1.7). Note that the
nodes are ranked in decreasing order of the regression score and
higher ranked nodes are more likely to be targets.

The experimental results reveal that the normalized ranks
(The normalized rank of a node u for a particular approach x is
defined as ‘I’normxyu : 

different approaches (Supplementary Material S1.7.5). Hence, an

of a given node vary widely using

approach that performs better for one particular network can perform
poorly in another. We further perform ROC analysis based on the
rankings of the nodes in the test set for each network. From Figure 4,
we observe that TENET outperforms other approaches in terms of the
quality of the prioritization results, particularly for individual net—
works, and is comparable in terms of runtime performance when SVM
training is performed ofﬂine [TENET (Regression only)].

4 Conclusions

We propose TENET, an SVM—based approach that characterizes
known targets in signalling networks using topological features by
identifying a set of predictive topological features and using them to
generate a characterization model. TENET uses feature selection to
remove redundant features, thereby improving prediction accuracy
of the characterization models and WMC to improve other perform-
ance criteria (e.g. sensitivity). Our empirical study reveals that the
characterization models generated by TENET outperform state—of—
the—art approaches in prioritizing signalling and PPI networks. In
summary, the contribution of this work is a machine learning—based
framework that affords ﬂexibility in characterizing signalling net-
works of different sizes and with different number of known targets.
Although TENET is evaluated on a small (Manual target curation, a
time—intensive process, is needed to identify known targets of signal—
ling networks for validating our experimental results.) number of
signalling networks, it can easily incorporate additional signalling
networks without any modification to the framework. As part of
future work, we intend to explore how the characterization models
learnt by TENET can be leveraged for target prioritization of sig—
nalling networks with unknown targets.

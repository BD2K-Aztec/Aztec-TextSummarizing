ABSTRACT

Summary: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate various biological functions
by binding hundreds of transcripts to impart post-transcriptional re-
pression. Recently, by applying a transcriptome—wide experimental
method for identifying miRNA target sites (Ago HITS-CLIP), a novel
non-canonical target site, named ‘nucleation bulge’, was discovered
as widespread, functional and evolutionally conserved. Although such
non-canonical nucleation bulges have been proven to be predictive by
using ‘pivot pairing rule’ and sequence conservation, this approach
has not been applied yet. To facilitate the functional studies of non-
canonical miRNA targets, we implement miRTCat: a comprehensive
searchable map of miRNA target sites, including non-canonical nucle-
ation bulges, not only mapped in experimentally verified miRNA-
bound regions but also predicted in all 3’-untrans|ated regions
(3’-UTRs) derived from human and mouse (~15.6% as expected
false-positive results).

1 INTRODUCTION

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNA molecules (~22 nt) that
induce post-transcriptional repression of messenger RNAs
(mRNAs), affecting various biological phenotypes (He and
Harmon, 2004). Animal miRNAs typically recognize mRNA targets
through imperfect matches, making the problem of predicting
miRNA target sites challenging. Among these partial pairings, it is
well known that miRNAs bind canonical miRNA target sites
through short consecutive pairings with their seed regions (position
2—8; called ‘seed pairing rule’) (Bartel, 2009). Besides sequence com-
plementarity, evolutional conservation has been considered, improv-
ing the performance of miRNA target predictions (Lewis et al.,
2005). However, a critical caveat of all seed-centric approaches is
its inability to identify non-canonical miRNA target sites (Didiano
and Hobert, 2006), overlooking priori recognized non-canonical
target sites validated as functionally important (Tay et al., 2008;
Vella et al., 2004).

Recently, by applying cross-linking immunoprecipitation
method (CLIP) coupled with high-throughput sequencing (HITS)
(Licatalosi, 2008) to a protein called Argonaute (Ago HITS-CLIP),
all miRNA-binding regions in target mRNAs were experimentally
mapped in high resolution (Chi et al., 2009). However, not all
miRNA-bound regions could be explained by the canonical seed
pairing rule, implicating existence of non-canonical miRNA—target
interactions. By performing bioinformatic analyses in such orphan
regions, non-canonical sites called ‘nucleation bulges’ were identiﬁed
and validated as widespread, functional and evolutionally conserved
(Chi et al., 2012). Non-canonical nucleation bulge sites are predict-
able, as the mode of their interactions is generalized by ‘pivot pairing
rule’, dictating a nucleotide in bulge (position 5 and 6) to be compe-
tent to pair with a nucleotide in position six of a miRNA, named
‘pivot’ to confer the thermodynamic stability on consecutive ﬁve
base pairings (position 2—6, Supplementary Fig. S1A). Such initial
ﬁve base pairings are proposed to be served as nuclei of interactions
(nucleation), followed by bulge formation where originally matched
pivot nucleotide in position six becomes bulged-out and propagating
hybridization toward 3’-end of the miRNA. However, such a rule
based on a pivot pairing has not been applied for miRNA target
prediction yet.

To offer opportunities of studying non-canonical miRNA targets,
here we describe miRNA target maps specialized for nucleation
bulge sites, named ‘miRTCat’. miRTCat provides comprehensive
maps searchable for miRNA target sites including non-canonical
nucleation bulges, of which locations are not only predicted in all
3’-untranslated regions (3’-UTRs; annotated by RefSeq in human
and mouse) but also mapped in miRNA-bound regions that are
experimentally veriﬁed (Chi et al., 2009, 2012; Hafner et al., 2010;
Kishore et al., 2011; Leung et al., 2011). Such functionalities will aid
to generate hypothesis starting from interactions between miRNA
and non-canonical targets.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

Based on the established principles: sequence complementarity and
evolutional conservation (see Supplementary Material for details),
miRTCat pipeline (Fig. 1A), implemented mainly by using Perl,
PHP and MySQL, identiﬁes miRNA target sites of both canonical
and non-canonical types for microRNA families, which were previ-
ously deﬁned as mostly conserved across vertebrates (Friedman
et al., 2009). For canonical seed sites, a seed pairing rule is used to
ﬁnd motifs >6mers that match to the 5’-end seed regions of miRNAs
(position 2—8; Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig. S1A). For non-ca-
nonical nucleation bulge sites, a pivot pairing rule is applied to

whole-genome alignments (Dreszer et al., 2011; Siepel et al., 2005) is
used.

3 RESULTS

As previously reported (Chi et al., 2012), nucleation bulge sites
have propensity to be more conserved in miRNA-bound regions
[mean phastCons score (PCS)=0.59:I:0.22] like seed sites
(PCS=0.82:I:0.17), compared with the control sites
(PCS=0.32:I:0.21) in human 3’-UTRs. Taking this notion, we
examine the performance of miRTCat depending on the level of
conservation by using experimentally identiﬁed miRNA-bound re-
gions (Chi et al., 2009), determine default cut-offs (PCS_2_0.9 for
both sites) and estimate the false-positive rate (15.6%; 13.6% for
seed matches and 20.1% for nucleation bulges) (Fig. 1B and
Supplementary Fig. SIB—D). Validation analysis using experiment
datasets of miRNA-dependant repression (Alexiou et al., 2009)
shows that transcripts identiﬁed by miRTCat (PCS_2_0.9) are more
signiﬁcantly downregulated than the targets found by simple seed
matching (P=5.0 x10_8) (Fig. 1C and Supplementary Fig. S2).
Furthermore, miRTCat is estimated to outperform in sensitivity
(~2.6-fold increase) with comparable precision with other prediction
methods (Fig. 1D and Supplementary Fig. S3). Overall, miRTCat
offers comprehensive mappings with increased number of target sites
by identifying non-canonical nucleation bulges, predicting bona
fide 245 454 sites (33 461 nucleation bulges (7mers), comparable
with 47 478 7mer seed sites) in human 3’-UTRs and mapping
263 361 sites (32 471 nucleation bulges, 44 665 7mer seed sites) in
all compiled data from experimentally identiﬁed miRNA-bound
regions (3272).

4 FUNCTIONALITY

The miRTCat web-interface offers search functionality of both ca-
nonical and non-canonical miRNA targets sites in two species,
human and mouse. Users can retrieve two types of identiﬁcation:
bona fide prediction in 3’-UTR and experimentally mapping results
in miRNA-bound regions, freely deﬁning cut-off values of PCS
(0.1—1.0) for both non-canonical nucleation bulge and canonical
seed sites. Users are informed to decide cut-off values for their pur-
pose of search considering experimentally estimated predictive values
depending on the extent of evolutional conservation (Fig. 1B and
Supplementary Fig. SID). Centered on target mRNAs and/or regu-
lator miRNAs, results of the target sites are returned in the form of
lists as a table providing sorting functionality and links for UCSC
genome browser (Dreszer et al., 2011), enabling to browse with other
genome information. In addition, all results are also available for
download as an excel ﬁle format and easily used for other compu-
tational analysis.

In summary, here we provide a comprehensive map of miRNA
target sites including non-canonical nucleation bulges in several for-
mats to facilitate further biological studies of miRNA regulation
through non-canonical targets, which has not been offered by cur-
rent approaches based on seed pairings.

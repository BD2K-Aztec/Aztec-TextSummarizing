ABSTRACT

Motivation: Although chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with
high-throughput sequencing (ChlP-seq) or tiling array hybridization
(ChlP-chip) is increasingly used to map genome-wide—binding sites
of transcription factors (T Fs), it still remains difficult to generate a qual-
ity ChIPx (i.e. ChlP-seq or ChlP-chip) dataset because of the tremen-
dous amount of effort required to develop effective antibodies and
efficient protocols. Moreover, most laboratories are unable to easily
obtain ChIPx data for one or more TF(s) in more than a handful of
biological contexts. Thus, standard ChIPx analyses primarily focus on
analyzing data from one experiment, and the discoveries are restricted
to a specific biological context.

Results: We propose to enrich this existing data analysis paradigm by
developing a novel approach, ChlP-PED, which superimposes ChIPx
data on large amounts of publicly available human and mouse gene
expression data containing a diverse collection of cell types, tissues
and disease conditions to discover new biological contexts with po-
tential TF regulatory activities. We demonstrate ChlP-PED using a
number of examples, including a novel discovery that MYC, a
human TF, plays an important functional role in pediatric Ewing sar-
coma cell lines. These examples show that ChlP-PED increases the
value of ChIPx data by allowing one to expand the scope of possible
discoveries made from a ChIPx experiment.

1 INTRODUCTION

ChIPx experiments, including ChIP-seq (Johnson et al., 2007)
and ChIP-chip (Ren et al., 2000), have become a powerful tool
used by individual investigators, as well as consortium projects,
such as the ENCODE (Dunham et al., 2012) to study transcrip-
tion factor-binding sites. Each individual ChIPx experiment is

non-trivial to perform—extensive time and effort must be spent
to acquire effective antibodies and design efﬁcient protocols to
generate high-quality ChIPx data—thus, it is important to de-
velop methodology to help investigators to maximize the value of
each individual ChIPx experiment.

One of the primary limitations of ChIPx is it may be difﬁcult
for individual laboratories to study TF regulation in a wide var-
iety of biological contexts, which we deﬁne as the cell or tissue
types and associated treatments or disease conditions (see deﬁn-
ition details in Supplementary Method 1.1). This is largely be-
cause of the prohibitively high labor and time costs to perform
each experiment. To resolve this limitation, we investigate
whether publicly available gene expression data (PED) in the
Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; Barrett et al., 2009) can be
used as a tool to increase the value of ChIPx experiments.
Currently, >600 000 gene expression samples from a broad spec-
trum of biological contexts and species are deposited in the GEO
and ArrayExpress (Parkinson et al., 2011). These data are freely
available and contain rich information complementary to ChIPx,
which may be extremely useful to help study TF regulation.

In this article, we demonstrate that this is indeed the case by
proposing and evaluating a new approach, ChIP-PED. Given a
TF regulatory pathway, i.e. a TF and the corresponding set of
target genes deﬁned using ChIPx and gene expression data in one
or more biological contexts, ChIP—PED scans through a large
collection of >20 000 human and mouse gene expression samples
generated by hundreds of different laboratories by quickly sur-
veying the TF and target gene activities across >2000 biological
contexts to identify potentially new connections between the TF
regulatory pathway and various cell types, tissues or diseases
(Fig. 1). We will illustrate that the predictions from ChIP—PED
are useful and can greatly expand the scope of discoveries one
can make from ChIPx experiments. We also provide an R pack-
age for users to perform ChIP-PED analyses on their own ChIPx
and TF perturbation data.

ChIP—PED represents a novel conceptual approach to building
computational tools for ChIPx data analysis. Most existing tools
for analyzing ChIPx data, including those for detecting protein—
DNA—binding sites (Laajala et al., 2009; Wilbanks and Facciotti,
2011), discovering DNA-binding motifs (Bailey et al., 2011; Liu
et al., 2002), correlating ChIPx with gene expression data (Cheng
et al., 2011; Ouyang et al., 2009) and so forth, focus on

Fig. 1. ChIP-PED overview. Gene expression proﬁles from TF perturb-
ation experiments are intersected with ChIPx experiments to obtain a set
of activated and repressed target genes. ChIP-PED then takes as input the
TF and target genes and scans through a compendium of publicly avail-
able gene expression proﬁles to search for biological contexts in which the
TF and target genes are enriched in activity. The ﬁnal output is a ranked
table of biological contexts enriched with a regulatory pattern of interest

addressing analysis issues concerning a single or a few related
ChIPx datasets. Their discoveries are also typically restricted to
the biological context in which the ChIPx experiments are per-
formed, and none of them systematically integrates information
from PED. PED has been shown to be invaluable in other ap-
plications (Huang et al., 2010; Zilliox and Irizarry, 2007), but the
possibility of using PED as a tool to boost the analysis of ChIPx
data still remains largely unexplored. A number of methods do
integrate large amounts of ChIPx and gene expression data to
construct gene regulatory networks, but most are primarily used
to study lower organisms (e.g. yeast; Faith et al., 2007; Zhu et al.,
2008). The present study is different from those described works,
as ChIP—PED focuses speciﬁcally on integrating ChIPx with
large amounts of heterogeneous data in human and mouse to
improve ChIPx analyses. Instead of attempting to construct a
comprehensive gene regulatory network, the primary goal of
ChIP-PED is to produce simple testable hypotheses, such as
‘TF A is functionally active in biological contexts X, Y and Z
through target gene set S’.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Data collection

ChIP-PED relies on two large compendiums of gene expression
proﬁles, consisting of 13182 human gene expression samples
generated from Affymetrix Human U133A (GPL96) and 9643
mouse samples generated from Affymetrix Mouse 430 2.0
(GPL1261) arrays (McCall et al., 2011). The gene expression
proﬁles were downloaded from GEO (July 2010), pre—processed
and normalized consistently using fRMA (McCall et al., 2010).
fRMA is designed to normalize large amount of heterogeneous
microarray samples to reduce the effect of batch on gene expres-
sion estimates. For each probeset, we standardized the fRMA
values across all microarray samples from the same array plat-
form to have zero mean and unit standard deviation. The biolo-
gical context of each sample was recorded and manually veriﬁed
based on the sample descriptions in GEO (see Supplementary
Method 1.1 and Supplementary Fig. S1).

2.2 ChIP-PED

Given a TF and its activated and repressed target genes deﬁned
using ChIPx and gene expression data in one or more biological
contexts, ChIP—PED searches for other contexts in which the TF
is likely to be functionally active. Target genes (TG) are genes
that are both TF-bound in the ChIPx experiments and differen-
tially expressed in corresponding gene expression data in
which the expression of the TF is perturbed. The latter are
from TF perturbation experiments comparing wild-type with
TF—knockout, control with TF—knockdown or control with
TF—overexpression and so forth. Users will need to provide
and analyze their own ChIPx and TF perturbation experiments
to deﬁne the input target genes. Supplementary Method 1.2
discusses methods for generating target gene lists. To deﬁne
target genes in a particular biological context, ideally one
would like to have ChIPx and TF perturbation data from the
same biological context. However, such data may not always be
available, and it is not uncommon to have ChIPx and TF per-
turbation data collected from two different contexts. In that case,
one can still intersect the data from different experiments to
obtain a putative target gene set assumed to contain the shared
targets.

ChIP-PED ﬁrst measures the TF expression and TG activity
in each microarray sample in our PED compendiums. TF ex-
pression, ETF, is deﬁned as a simple average of the normalized
probeset intensities, p:

ETF = Zpi/nTF (1)
ieTF

where T F is the set of probesets that measure the expression of
the TF, and mm is the number of probesets for the TF. TG
activity, Am, is deﬁned as:

Zpi
ATG = Z SglE: /nTG (2)

g6 TG g

 

Here, T G is the set of target genes of the TF, mm is the number
of target genes, mg is the number of probesets for a speciﬁc target
gene, g, and sg is 1 or —1 depending on whether gene g is acti-
vated (positively regulated) or repressed (negatively regulated),
respectively. sg is included to account for TFs that are capable of
both activating and repressing different target genes. A TG is de-
signed to describe the regulatory activity of a TF through its
target genes, rather than measure the raw expression of the
target genes. For example, if a TF acts mainly as a repressor
in a biological context in which it is functionally active, we
would observe low expression of its target genes, but high A TG
because of the multiplier sg= —1 (Supplementary Method 1.3
and Supplementary Fig. S2A and B). Examples of the distribu-
tions of ETF and ATG for real TF ChIPx data are shown in
Supplementary Figure S3.

After measuring TF expression and TG activity, users can
choose cut-offs 01 ~ 04 to deﬁne (i) high-TF expression
(‘ETF> 01’), (ii) low-TF expression (‘ETF< c2), (iii) high-TG ac-
tivity (‘ATG>C3) and (iv) low-TG activity (‘ATG< c4), denoted
by TF+, T F—, TG+ and TG—, respectively. By default, 01 ~ 04
are chosen to be values corresponding to a one-sided P—value of
0.1 based on ﬁtted normal distributions for E TF or ATG across all

9643 Affymetrix Mouse 430 2.0 array samples and human M YC (B) and S T A T I (D) in 13 182 Affymetrix Human HGUl33a samples. Number of TGs
in each plot is shown in the parentheses. Solid lines correspond to TF+ (c1) and TF— (c2) ETF cut-offs and TG+ (c3) and TG— (c4) A TG cut-offs. Samples
from a few biological contexts with enriched TF+TG+ (in A—D), TF—TG+ (in B) and TF+TG— (in C) functional activity are shown in color. Also
plotted in color are ‘Diff ESC, EBs’ (purple) to show the separation between differentiated and undifferentiated ESCs in (A), ‘A673’ (purple) and ‘Ewing
tumor’ (blue), both of which are Ewing tumor samples in (B), and ‘PBMC-normal’ (orange), which fall outside of the TF+TG+ region in contrast to
infected PBMCs in (D). All other samples are plotted in gray. ‘Cor’: Pearson correlation coefﬁcient between ETF and Afg. ‘Pval’: P—values that are
empirically calculated from ETF and ATG correlations of randomly drawn pseudo-TG sets of the same size 10 000 times. For comparison, an example plot

of a random sample of pseudo-TGs is shown for each TF (bottom-right)

samples, with c] and 03 taking values above the mean, and 02 and
04 taking values below the mean (Fig. 2A). ChIP-PED can then
search for biological contexts associated with four regulatory
patterns: (i) TF—I—TG—I—, (ii) T F+TG—, (iii) T F—TG+ and (iv)
TF—TG—. The pattern TF+TG+ is of primary interest, as it
focuses on discovering new contexts in which the TF is function-
ally active through its target genes (TF-active). This is because
high-TF expression alone is not sufﬁcient to imply the existence
of functional TF protein because of possible post-transcriptional
and translational regulation, but high-TG activity in addition to
high-TF expression would strongly support the presence of
active TF protein. Other regulatory patterns are discussed in
more detail in the Supplementary Method 1.4.

Then given a compendium of N gene expression
proﬁles, ChIP-PED searches among all biological contexts with
at least three samples, for contexts that are associated with
the regulatory pattern of interest (e. g. TF+TG+). For each con-
text 0, it counts (i) K, the total number of samples in the com-
pendium that exhibit the pattern, (ii) mg, the total number of
samples in context 0, and (iii) kc, the number of samples in
context c that exhibit the pattern. Fisher’s exact test is then
applied to the quadruplet (nC, N, kc and K) to test the associ-
ation between c and the regulatory pattern of interest (i.e.
whether kc is signiﬁcantly larger than random expectation). To
account for testing multiple contexts, the P—values are adjusted
using the Bonferroni correction. The ﬁnal output of ChIP-PED
is a ranked table of statistically signiﬁcant biological contexts at
a default Bonferroni corrected P—value cut-off of 0.05
(Supplementary Method 1.5).

After the initial ChIP-PED analysis, ChIP-PED can perform
the following analyses to further explore each predicted context:
(i) search for related contexts in the compendium based on user-
speciﬁed keyword(s), (ii) extract the ETF and A TG values for the
set of contexts found, (iii) calculate, sort and plot the mean and

standard deviation of the ETF and ATG values for each context
and (iv) perform t—tests between all pairwise combinations of the
contexts for signiﬁcant differences in mean ETF or Am. See
Supplementary Methods 1.6—1.7 for details and Section 3.3 for
an example analysis.

2.3 ChIP-PED evaluation

We evaluated ChIP-PED by applying it to multiple TFs—Oct4,
Gata] and Jarid2 in mice and M YC, STAT I and ESRI in
human—using the datasets listed in Supplementary Table S1.
The TF target genes were constructed by intersecting TF-
bound genes predicted from ChIPx data with differentially ex-
pressed genes [false discovery rate (FDR) g 10%] in T F perturb-
ation data. TF—bound genes were deﬁned as genes with a
signiﬁcant peak (FDRg 10%) overlapping with the —10- to
+5-kb region around the transcription start site of the gene.
Details are provided in Supplementary Method 1.2, and full
target gene lists can be found in Supplementary Tables S2—S7.

Predictions were veriﬁed by a thorough search of existing lit-
erature to identify whether each prediction was functionally vali-
dated or suggested in previous experiments. ‘Functional’
validations required previous experimental data from the pre-
dicted biological context demonstrating observable changes in
phenotype when the expression of the TF is perturbed or TF
binding coupled with transcriptional responses to TF binding
of target genes. ‘Suggested’ predictions must be supported by
other lines of indirect evidence, such as experimentally observed
high-TF protein levels in the predicted context. A11 supporting
references are recorded in Supplementary Tables S2—S7. We also
experimentally validated a novel ChIP-PED functional connec-
tion between MYC and Ewing sarcoma (Supplementary Method
1.8).

ChIP-PED enhances the analysis of ChIP-seq

 

3 RESULTS

3.1 PED are capable of measuring TF regulatory
activities in spite of data heterogeneity

We ﬁrst investigated whether it was appropriate to compare gene
expression across thousands of heterogeneous microarray sam-
ples generated by different laboratories. To this end, we asked
whether laboratory and batch effects were a signiﬁcant and det-
rimental source of variation (Leek e1 01]., 2010). Previous efforts
have been made using our gene expression compendiums to dem-
onstrate that similar tissue types do cluster together (Zilliox and
Irizarry, 2007), and that it is possible to accurately predict tissue
types from a single gene expression proﬁle in spite of the labora-
tory or batch effects (McCall e1 01]., 2011). We reafﬁrmed these
ﬁndings by observing that samples from the same tissues from
different laboratories were more similar in expression compared
with samples from different tissues from the same laboratory
(Supplementary Fig. S4 and Supplementary Method 1.9).

We then examined the correlation between TF expression
(ETF) and TG activity (A TG) for multiple TFs, including mouse
0014 and 001101] and human M YC and STAT]. We reasoned
that if there were strong laboratory or batch effects that over-
whelmed the biological signal, we would observe weak to zero
correlation between E TF and ATG across the heterogeneous sam-
ples. Instead, we found signiﬁcant correlation between TF ex-
pression and TG activity; the Pearson correlation coefﬁcients
between ETF and ATG for 0014, M YC, 001101] and STA T] were
0.679, 0.418, 0.303 and 0.699, respectively (P<0.02; Fig. 2). As
this observation holds for multiple mouse and human TFs from
different microarray platforms (GPL1261 and GPL96), our re-
sults suggest that biological variability in the publicly available
Affymetrix microarray data is stronger than the laboratory or
batch effects. This is consistent with earlier observations made by
Lukk 01 a]. (2010).

3.2 ChIP-PED predicts known TF—active contexts

After verifying that it is meaningful to compare ETF and ATG
across heterogeneous samples, we asked whether the samples
observed with high-TF expression and high-TG activity
(T F—I—TG+) and the biological contexts enriched with a
T F+T G+ regulatory pattern were biologically meaningful. In
this regard, we performed and evaluated ChIP-PED analyses
of six TFs: mouse 0014, 001101] and Jarid2 and human M YC,
STAT] and ESR].

0014 is a master regulator in mouse embryonic stem cells
(ESCs). We obtained 519 activated and 337 repressed 0014
target genes by combining ChIP-seq data from mouse ESCs
with gene expression data from ESCs in which 0014 was knocked
down via siRNA (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). Using these
target genes as input, 0014 target gene activity was plotted
against 0014 expression after excluding the PED samples used
to construct the target genes (Fig. 2A). We found that undiffer-
entiated ESCs clustered together with high-TF expression and
high-TG activity. In contrast, differentiated ESCs or embryoid
bodies (EBs) had lower TF expression and TG activity. This is
consistent with the self-renewal and pluripotency role of 0014 in
ESCs and its decrease in expression when ESCs differentiate
(Chen e1 01]., 2008; Loh e1 01]., 2006).

Of the 9643 mouse samples in the compendium, 480 were
labeled as TF+TG+ using the default cut-offs. Among them,
69.2% (332/480) were known 0014-expressing (+0014) biological
contexts—most commonly, undifferentiated ESCs (Niwa e1 01].,
2000), primordial germ cells (Kehler e1 01]., 2004), induced pluri-
potent stem cells (W ernig e1 01]., 2007) and embryonic carcinomas
(\Nang and Schultz, 1996)—covering 96.0% (332/346) of all
—I—0014 samples in the compendium. In all, 18.1% (87/480) of
the T F—I—TG+ samples were differentiating ESCs or EBs, and
the remaining 12.7% (61/480) were other contexts, such as em-
bryos, mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts (MEFs) and so forth. The
observation that a large proportion (30.8% = 18.1% —I— 12.7%) of
T F—I—TG+ samples were biological contexts not known to ex-
press 0014 (-0014) shows the noisy nature of PED. This makes
it challenging to correctly predict whether an individual sample
truly exhibits functional TF activity. However, the primary goal
of ChIP-PED is not to correctly identify TF-active samples, but
to identify TF—active biological contexts. Thus, ChIP-PED takes
advantage of the fact that each biological context has multiple
samples in the PED compendium to predict TF—active biological
contexts by reporting the contexts with a statistically signiﬁcant
proportion of TF+TG+ samples.

In total, ChIP-PED predicted 28 biological contexts were en-
riched with TF+TG+ activity at a Bonferroni-corrected P—value
cut-off of 0.05 (Supplementary Table S2). Among these, 89.3%
(25/28) were different +0014 contexts, and 10.7% (3/28) were
-0014 contexts related to differentiating ESCs and EBs. The 28
statistically enriched contexts covered 47.9% (230/480) of the
T F—I—TG+ samples. These samples were from multiple labora-
tories (e.g. normal undifferentiated ESCs: 11 experiments), con-
ﬁrming that the observed enrichment in ESCs was unlikely to be
caused by experimental artifacts or laboratory or batch effects.
More importantly, ChIP-PED ﬁltered out most -0014 biological
contexts: 30.8% (148/480) TF+TG+ samples were from -0014
contexts, whereas only 10.7% (3/28) of the TF+TG+-enriched
contexts were from -0014 contexts, and among the samples of the
28 TF+TG+-enriched contexts, only 8.7% (20/230) were -0014
samples. Therefore, by integrating information from multiple
samples, predictions made at the context level are more accurate
than at the sample level.

Next, we analyzed human M YC, a TF known to be involved
in multiple tumors (Zeller e1 01]., 2003). We identiﬁed 1716 acti-
vated and 617 repressed target genes from a compilation of eight
TF perturbation datasets along with 12 ChIPx datasets
(Supplementary Tables S1 and S3). The target genes were
required to be differentially expressed in the same direction in
250% of the TF perturbation datasets and M YC—bound in
250% of the ChIPx datasets. The aim was to identify the core
M YC regulatory target genes that were cell-type independent
across multiple M YC—active contexts. As expected, M YC regu-
latory activity was signiﬁcantly enriched in numerous tumor
types (Figs 2B and 4A and Supplementary Table S3): 74.7% of
the 521 T F—I—TG+ samples were tumors, which was signiﬁcantly
higher than the background percentage of 46.0% for all 13 182
samples in the human PED compendium (one-sided P<0.001,
binomial test). Among these samples, ChIP-PED predicted 33
TF+TG+-enriched biological contexts. Many of the predictions
were found to be correct, such as B-cell lymphomas, which have

been shown to have functionally active MYC protein (Zeller
e1 01]., 2003).

Successful predictions were also made when analyzing mouse
0010] target genes from erythroid contexts, mouse Jarid2 target
genes from ESCs, human STA T] target genes from HeLaS3 cells
and human ESR] target genes from estrogen-treated MCF7 cells
(Supplementary Tables S1, S4—S7). ChIP-PED found enriched
001101] expression and target gene activity in expected biological
contexts related to erythrocyte and megakaryocyte development,
such as in fetal liver, common myeloid progenitor cells and
murine erythroleukemia cells (Fig. 2C; Iwasaki e1 01]., 2003).
ChIP-PED also predicted STA T] functional activity in periph-
eral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) infected with hepatitis C
and malaria, consistent with current knowledge of STA T] regu-
latory functions (Fig. 2D; Kim 01 01]., 2008; Taylor 01 01]., 2007).
Jarid2 activity, a known repressor with an essential role in
embryonic development, was enriched in expected cell types,
such as undifferentiated ESCs and induced pluripotent stem
cells (Supplementary Fig. S2A; Landiera and Fisher, 2011).
Finally, ChIP-PED correctly predicted ESR] functional activity
in breast cancer-related cell types, such as MCF7 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S2C; Frasor e1 01]., 2009).

For the six TFs analyzed, ChIP-PED made 178 TF+TG+
predictions listed in Supplementary Tables S2—S7 (0014: 28,
MYC: 33, 001101]: 37, STAT]: 12, Jarid2: 41 and ESR]: 27).
To systematically evaluate ChIP-PED prediction accuracy, we
examined all predictions through a survey of existing literature.
We found that 90 of 178 (50.6%) biological contexts predicted to
be enriched with TF+TG+ activity were functionally validated
in previous experiments (see Section 2). For example in the 0014
analysis, 20 of the 28 predictions were functionally validated,
even though 25 of the 28 predictions were known to express
0014 RNA (i.e. +0014 as described earlier). This is because func-
tional experiments demonstrating changes in phenotype after
perturbing 0014 or showing TF binding with associated tran-
scriptional response of target genes could only be found for 20
predictions; therefore, we only counted those 20 predictions as
functionally validated. The 50.6% accuracy rate is a conservative
estimate, as the remaining predictions may not necessarily be
false positives, but instead may represent unknown/novel func-
tional relationships. Altogether, these results demonstrate that
given the target genes of a TF deﬁned from ChIPx and TF per-
turbation data from one or a few biological contexts, ChIP-PED
is capable of discovering TF—active contexts from a broad spec-
trum of PED samples.

Searching through PED only for TF+ samples or only for
T G+ samples, rather than TF+ and TG+ samples, may result
in substantially decreased ChIP-PED prediction accuracy and
number of functionally validated predictions. For instance,
when we modiﬁed ChIP-PED to search only for TF+ samples,
we found that only 40.0% (62/155) of the predicted TF+ con-
texts were functionally validated in previous experiments com-
pared with 50.6% (90/178) when using ChIP-PED to search for
T F+ and T G+ samples (Supplementary Tables S2—S7).
Conversely, searching for only TG+ samples resulted in only
34.0% (67/197) functionally validated TG+ predictions
(Supplementary Tables S2—S7). Thus, it is useful to check both
TF expression and target gene activity of each context to identify

T F+ and TG+ samples when predicting TF-active biological
contexts.

TF target genes can vary from one cell type to another. If two
known TF-active contexts do not share any target genes, then
ChIP-PED will not be able to predict either context using target
genes constructed from the other context. To test whether ChIP-
PED can still be effective when only a minority of the target
genes are shared, we used ChIP-PED to analyze S1013 target
genes constructed from mouse CD4+ T cells and Th17 cells,
which are both contexts in which S1013 plays an important regu-
latory role (Durant e1 01]., 2010; Kwon e1 01]., 2009). We found
that ChIP-PED was able to successfully recover both CD4+
T cells and Th17 cells when analyzing target genes deﬁned
from the other context, even though <30% of the target genes
were in common (Supplementary Method 1.10, Supplementary
Table S8 and Supplementary Fig. S5).

3.3 ChIP-PED can expand the scope of possible
functional discoveries

ChIP-PED would not be useful if the predicted biological con-
texts were always closely related to the context in which the ex-
perimental data were generated. Our results indicate otherwise:
among the 90 of 178 (50.6%) predictions supported by previous
functional experiments, 40 (44.4%) are in contexts unrelated to
the context(s) in which the experimental data used to construct
the TF target genes were obtained (Supplementary Tables
S2—S7).

Furthermore, ChIP-PED can provide additional biological in-
sights that otherwise could not be made using standard ChIPx
analyses. For example, after the initial STA T] ChIP-PED ana-
lysis described in Section 3.2, we found many hepatitis C-infected
PBMCs predictions from experiment GSE7123 (Supplementary
Table S5 and Supplementary Method 1.11). To examine STA T]
functional activity in hepatitis C-infected PBMCs in more detail,
we searched for all contexts in GSE7123 and also found healthy
PBMCs along with the predicted hepatitis C-infected PBMCs.
We then used ChIP-PED to compare TF expression and TG
activity in each context and found that ETF and ATG values
were signiﬁcantly different between healthy and hepatitis C-in-
fected PBMCs, with a gradual decrease in ETF and ATG values as
patients recovered from infection (Supplementary Table S5,
Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S6). When reviewing both of
the original publications, the STAT] ChIPx study (Robertson
e1 01]., 2007) and the study that generated the gene expression
proﬁles from hepatitis C-infected PBMCs (Taylor 01 01]., 2007),
we found that neither study had reported this ﬁnding. To verify
whether this observation was correct, we searched through exist-
ing literature and found an entirely independent experiment that
showed in a series of overexpression and siRNA-mediated
knock-down experiments of STA T] in hepatitis C virus-infected
PBMCs that STA T] protein was indispensable for the control of
hepatitis C virus expression (Lin e1 01]., 2005).

3.4 ChIP-PED can discover novel TF—active contexts

Besides verifying that ChIP-PED is able to correctly predict
known TF—active biological contexts, we also experimentally
investigated whether the predictions that were not functionally
validated could possibly represent unknown TF-active biological

Fig. 3. Series of ChIP-PED plots depicting the gradual decrease in
STAT] expression and target gene (TG) activity when blood samples
are successively drawn from hepatitis C-infected patients as they recover
after treatment with interferon and ribavirin from Day 1, 2, 7, 14 to 28 of

dium, and colored points are the samples from the infected PBMCs in
GSE7123. The x-axis is STAT] expression (ETF) and the y-axis is TG

indicted at the top of each plot. Normal PBMCs (bottom right in
black) in GSE7123 fall almost entirely out of the TF+TG+ cut-offs

contexts. As a proof-of—concept, we used our ChIP-PED analysis
of human M YC to illustrate the discovery of a novel M YC—active
context. Among the enriched TF+TG+ predictions from the
M YC ChIP-PED analysis, 18 of 33 (54.5%) biological contexts
were not supported by functional experiments that demonstrated
M YC functional activity (Supplementary Table S3). One of the
non-functionally validated contexts was A673 cells (Fig. 4A),
which were established from a patient with Ewing sarcoma
(Martinez-Ramirez e1 01]., 2003). Although Ewing tumor has
been previously shown to exhibit high-MYC expression
(Dauphinot e1 01]., 2001), the functional role of MYC protein
in Ewing tumor currently remains uncharacterized. To verify
the novel prediction that MYC protein plays a functional role
in Ewing tumor, we assessed the phenotype changes of independ-
ent Ewing sarcoma cell lines on M YC knockdown. Knocking
down of M YC using shMYC in TC71 and MHH-ES Ewing
sarcoma cell lines resulted in a substantially slower proliferation
rate and tumorigenicity when compared with control cells
(Fig. 4B and C and Supplementary Figs S7 and S8).
Furthermore, xenograft of control and shMYC TC71 Ewing
sarcoma cells into immunodeﬁcient mice (NOD/SCID/IL-2y
null) resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease in volume and weight
for the M YC knockdown tumors after 6 weeks of growth
(Fig. 4D). Subsequent isolation of the tumors conﬁrmed the de-
crease in MYC protein by western blot analysis (Fig. 4E). These
results strongly support the novel prediction that the MYC pro-
tein plays a key functional role in Ewing tumor.

When studying the 88 functionally unveriﬁed predictions
across the six TFs analyzed, we found that 51 of the 88
(58.0%) predictions were supported by other lines of indirect
evidence in existing literature, such as experimentally observed

high-TF protein level in the predicted context (Supplementary
Tables S2—S7). Thus, these predictions are likely to represent
previously unknown functional predictions between each TF
regulatory pathway and context, which further demonstrates
that ChIP-PED can discover known and unknown TF-active
biological contexts. In total, 141 of 178 (79.2%) TF+TG+ pre-
dictions for the six TFs analyzed were either directly supported
by functional evidence (90 of 178) or indirectly supported in
existing literature (51 of 178).

3.5 Effect of modiﬁcations to the ChIP-PED analysis

Many TFs regulate a subset of their target genes through distal
enhancers. Recent tools, such as GREAT (McLean e1 01]., 2010),
have shown that by properly accounting for distal regulatory sites,

 

1187

one can improve the functional analysis of TF-binding sites. In
our ChIP-PED analyses, we assigned peaks to genes if the peak
overlapped with the — 10- to +5-kb region around each gene tran-
scription start site, which may miss distal TF regulatory activity.
This in turn may affect ChIP-PED prediction accuracy. To inves-
tigate, we generated ChIP-PED predictions for ESRl using target
genes in estrogen-treated MCF7 cells derived from chromatin
interaction analysis by paired-end tag sequencing (ChIA-PET),
a method better able to link distal regulatory sites to TF-binding
targets (Fullwood et al., 2009), and compared them with predic-
tions made using target genes deﬁned by ChIP-seq using the — 10-
to +5-kb window. We found that ChIA-PET-based predictions
were similar to ChIP-seq—based predictions, and the former had
slightly higher functional prediction accuracy of 43.5% compared
with 40.7% (Supplementary Method 1.12 and Supplementary
Table S7). We also analyzed all six TFs by using multiple anno-
tation window sizes to annotate ChIPx peaks. Different window
sizes produced comparable prediction accuracies at the default
signiﬁcance cut-off. However, the —10- to +5-kb window size
produced the largest number (i.e. highest power) of functionally
validated and/ or indirectly supported predictions (Supplementary
Method 1.12 and Supplementary Tables S9 and S10). Thus, our
results suggest that the —10- to +5-kb window represents a rea-
sonable choice as a default annotation region.

We also compared how well a median, rather than mean,
target gene activity measure would perform and found the pre-
dictions and prediction accuracy to be almost the same; across all
six TFs, 171 predictions were identical between the two measures
accounting for 98.8% (171/ 173) of the median-based predictions
and 96.1% (171/178) of the mean-based predictions
(Supplementary Method 1.13 and Supplementary Fig. S9). In
addition, we checked whether predicted biological contexts
with more samples in the compendium were more or less accur-
ate than predicted contexts with fewer samples. Our results were
unable to ﬁnd a clear monotone relationship between sample
count for a given biological context and prediction accuracy
(Supplementary Method 1.14 and Supplementary Table S11).

4 DISCUSSION

We have shown that ChIP-PED can improve the analysis of
ChIPx data by integrating publicly available gene expression
data. Given a TF and its target genes, ChIP-PED examines the
expression of the TF and the activity of its target genes across an
assortment of diverse biological contexts to search for contexts
with enriched regulatory activity of the TF. This process may
lead to the discovery of novel functional connections between TF
regulatory pathways and diseases, thus providing a cost effective
way to expand knowledge from one ChIPx study to other re-
search areas.

We view ChIP-PED as an exploratory tool for fast and cost-
effective hypothesis generation and screening. In this respect, the
default cut-offs that deﬁne high- or low-TF expression or TG
activity should be primarily used for initial exploration or ﬁrst-
pass automatic hypothesis screening, rather than as strict optimal
cut-offs that apply to all TFs. Based on our real data analysis
experience, we found it difﬁcult to set a single consistent cut-off
that was optimal across all TFs, as TFs can vary greatly in terms
of regulatory behavior (Fig. 2). We, therefore, provide users with

the flexibility to choose their own cut-offs, which can be adjusted
to decrease or increase the number of predicted contexts
(Supplementary Method 1 . 15).

ChIP-PED acts primarily as a guide to highlight biological
contexts that would be good leads for experimental investigation.
As such, we do not expect all ChIP-PED predictions to be cor-
rect nor for ChIP-PED to recover all TF-active biological con-
texts. This, however, does not prevent ChIP-PED from being a
useful and unique tool: our analyses have shown that it can
predict many known and new TF-active contexts with reasonable
accuracy, and there currently exists no other computational
method for analyzing ChIPx data that performs a similar task.

Although we have shown that ChIP-PED is able to capture
pertinent biological information in PED, better statistical models
are still needed to address technical biases and variations because
of laboratory and batch effects. A natural extension of ChIP-
PED would be to analyze multiple TFs and their TGs together to
better connect cooperative TF regulatory pathways to cell types
and diseases. Similarly, more work is also needed to understand
how homologous TFs or other TFs with similar regulatory func-
tions impact the regulatory activity of the TF of interest in dif-
ferent contexts.

Our study is not necessarily the best or only way to integrate
ChIPx and PED; however, to the best of our knowledge, this is
the ﬁrst systematic study of using PED to enhance ChIPx ana-
lyses in human and mouse. We hope that ChIP-PED will inspire
new computational approaches that continue to maximize the
value of ChIP-seq and ChIP-chip experiments.

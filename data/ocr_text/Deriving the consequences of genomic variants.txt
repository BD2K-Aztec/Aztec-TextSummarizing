ABSTRACT

Summary: Atool to predict the effect that newly discovered genomic
variants have on known transcripts is indispensible in prioritizing and
categorizing such variants. In Ensembl, a web-based tool (the SNP
Effect Predictor) and API interface can now functionally annotate
variants in all Ensembl and Ensembl Genomes supported species.
Availability: The Ensembl SNP Effect Predictor can be
accessed via the Ensembl website at http://www.ensembl.org/.
The Ensembl API (http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/api/
api_installation.html for installation instructions) is open source
software.

1 INTRODUCTION

As costs of resequencing and genotyping fall, increasing amounts
of variation data are being produced that cannot be annotated
effectively without access to considerable computational resources
and genomic annotation databases. Often the most valuable
information to know about a variant is the effect the observed
alleles have on transcripts, which may aid selection of variations for
genotyping studies and in turn have a part to play in the discovery of
new drug targets and other biologically signiﬁcant loci. Deriving this
information manually is laborious and error—prone, impractical for
large sets of data and impossible without access to suitable genomic
annotation resources. Of critical interest is the existence of any novel
variant positions within a dataset, and what information is available
for known variant loci. Although these answers are available through
dbSNP (Sherry et al., 1999), the process of submitting the data to
the NCBI to be processed and annotated can often take months and
requires the data to be made public.

Even before the developments reported in this article, Ensembl
(Flicek et al., 2010) could also be used to derive similar annotation
by setting up a full local Ensembl database containing the variant
information and running scripts from the Ensembl Variation database
production pipeline. Other tools available for the annotation of single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in humans are comprehensively
reviewed in Karchin (2008).

Existing methods of deriving the effects of variants can be
limiting: many present too high a hurdle in terms of timeframe,
privacy or ease of use; others are species limited. To address this,
Ensembl has been extended to include an easy to use web—based
tool for deriving variation consequences, as well as programmatic
access to the same functionality using the Ensembl Perl API.

2 IMPLEMENTATION
2.1 SNP Effect Predictor

The Ensembl project provides access to genomic annotation for
numerous species Via its web—based genome browser, as well as
programmatic access Via the object—oriented Perl API. The SNP
Effect Predictor tool on the Ensembl website, accessed Via the
‘Manage your data’ link on any species—speciﬁc Ensembl page
(e.g. http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/), uses the API calls
described below to provide access to consequence prediction
functionality without the need for writing code. The SNP Effect
Predictor can be used for all species within Ensembl, including those
with no existing variation dataset.

Users upload lists of variant positions and alleles Via a HTML
form page. Input for each variant consists simply of a chromosome
(or contig name in the absence of assembled chromosomes),
start and end coordinates, strand designation and a set of alleles.
Users can then select text or HTML formatted output, the
latter incorporating hyperlinks to loci, transcripts and genes in
the Ensembl genome browser. The output includes: Ensembl
stable identiﬁers for the relevant transcript and gene; transcript—
relative coordinates; possible amino acids; and the identiﬁer of
any existing variants that are co—located with the user—deﬁned
variant. Since a variant may co—locate with more than one
transcript, one line of output is provided for each instance of
co—location. Consequence types predicted by Ensembl are shown
in transcript context in Figure l, with further detail provided at
(http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/variation/index.html).

User uploaded variations can subsequently be Viewed in the
context of their location on the Ensembl browser, with each uploaded
ﬁle given its own track on the browser’s location View.

2.2 Ensembl API

The Ensembl API can be installed on any operating system
that supports Perl and MySQL, and can be conﬁgured to use
any combination of local or remote databases. The Ensembl

Variation API (Chen et al., 2010; Rios et al., 2010) exists to
retrieve variation data such as SNPs, insertions and deletions from
Ensembl databases. Entities such as variants are represented as
objects, created by adaptors that act as factories for generating
speciﬁc objects. Example code demonstrating the use of the
API to derive consequences for a list of variant positions
is shown in Supplementary Figure 1. Documentation on the
API is found at http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/Pdoc/ensembl—
variation/index.html.

Given a variant position, the API retrieves overlapping transcripts
from the Ensembl Core database and determines where in the
transcript structure the variant falls. If the variant falls within an
exon, new codons for each variant allele are derived and compared to
the reference codon. The location of the variant relative to regulatory
regions is also assessed using the Ensembl Functional Genomics
database where available. The results, including amino acid changes
and relative positions in the CDNA and peptide sequences, are stored
in the resulting transcript variation objects, along with one or more
named consequence types.

At present Ensembl provides only a Perl API, but enabled
by the open source nature of the project Python (PyCogent,
http://pycogent.sourceforge.net/examples/query_ensembl.html;
PyGr, http://code.google.com/p/pygr/wiki/PygrOnEnsembl) APIs
have been created. As yet, these do not encompass the full scope

of Ensembl, and hence do not include consequence prediction
functionality.

3 RESULTS

The SNP Effect Predictor tool can be used to quickly and
accurately predict the effects of variants on Ensembl—annotated
transcripts. Up to 750 variant loci can be uploaded in a ﬁle
to http://www.ensembl.org/, with the time taken to return results
scaling linearly with the number of variants uploaded within a
species; calculation time will also vary by species depending on
the number of transcripts. A ﬁle containing 750 variants in Homo
sapiens takes ~35 s to return results; an equivalent calculation in
Danio rerio takes 20 3. Users with more than 750 variants may
download a standalone script to run locally that produces identical
results. The script can be conﬁgured to connect to both the public
Ensembl database as well as any combination of local and remote
databases. A wider range of input ﬁle formats is also supported,
including the commonly used pileup variant format.

The provision of a simple web interface to powerful algorithms
that transparently process large data volumes is a valuable asset
to users without computing expertise, and also to those who need a
quick and easy way to retrieve annotation for novel variants. Having
this tool integrated with the extensive, rich annotation available on
the Ensembl website will facilitate interpretation and analysis of the
data.

Direct use of the Ensembl Variation API enables users to
incorporate consequence prediction into their variation software
and pipelines, providing predicted consequences for an unlimited
number of variants. By optimizing code and database access times
it is possible to retrieve consequences for 1000 distinct variants in
H.sapiens in <30 3; for D.reri0 this takes <15 3.

The ﬂexibility of the Ensembl API means that consequences can
be predicted for any species with an Ensembl gene set, or using any
valid Ensembl database on users’ own systems. Using these features
in coalition with others in the API enables the creation of advanced
pipelines that can produce biologically important information from
high—throughput experimental data. Such information is invaluable
both as a screening system for variants and as an aid in the study of
phenotypically linked variants.

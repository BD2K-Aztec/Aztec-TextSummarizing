ABSTRACT

Motivation: Despite huge prognostic promises, gene expression-
based survival assessment is rarely used in clinical routine. Main
reasons include difficulties in performing and reporting analyses and
restriction in most methods to one high-risk group with the vast ma-
jority of patients being unassessed. The present study aims at limiting
these difficulties by (i) mathematically defining the number of risk
groups without any a priori assumption; (ii) computing the risk of an
independent cohort by considering each patient as a new patient
incorporated to the validation cohort and (iii) providing an open-
access Web site to freely compute risk for every new patient.
Results: Using the gene expression profiles of 551 patients with mul-
tiple myeloma, 602 with breast-cancer and 460 with glioma, we de-
veloped a model combining running log-rank tests under controlled
chi-square conditions and multiple testing corrections to build a risk
score and a classification algorithm using simultaneous global and
between-group log-rank chi-square maximization. For each cancer
entity, we provide a statistically significant three-group risk prediction
model, which is corroborated with publicly available validation
cohorts.

Conclusion: In constraining between-group significances, the risk
score compares favorably with previous risk classifications.
Availability: Risk assessment is freely available on the Web at https://

1 INTRODUCTION

Prediction of cancer patients’ survival is one of the most challen-
ging tasks in daily practice in oncology. Gene expression proﬁl-
ing (GEP) has been used in cancer to look for cancer
heterogeneity and predict for corresponding classiﬁcation out-
come. While the main clinical prognostic factor of multiple mye-
loma (MM) is the International Staging System (ISS) based on
serum [32-microglobulin and serum albumin (Greipp et al., 2005),
two high-risk scores have combined GEP with overall survival
(OS) as input data and outcome issue (Decaux et al., 2008;
Shaughnessy et al., 2007). Several other GEP-based signatures

using either tumor progression or cell cycle-associated indexes at
diagnosis or relapse have been published (Chng et al., 2008; Hose
et al., 2010; Kuiper et al., 2012; Mulligan et al., 2007). Gene
expression microarrays were early used to identify breast carcin-
oma subtypes (Sorlie et al., 2001) and outcome (van ‘t Veer et al.,
2002), intrinsic molecular groups (Guedj et al., 2012; Kao et al.,
2011), recurrence, metastasis and survival (Reis-Filho and
Pusztai, 2011). Gene expression-based proﬁling of malignant gli-
omas has been recognized to produce a more robust classiﬁca-
tion than the conventional histological diagnosis (Gravendeel
et al., 2009; Li et al., 2009; Nutt et al., 2003; Shirahata et al.,
2007) and also to directly predict for survival (Freije et al., 2004;
Petalidis et al., 2008).

Despite a huge prognostic promise in a wide range of malig-
nant diseases, GEP is rarely used in clinical routine to assess
outcome. Main reasons include difﬁculties in performing the
analysis and reporting of the data in clinical practice, inability
of direct application of deﬁned groups and frequently arbitrary
assumptions in expression-based scores, e.g. risk-group size and
number. Most GEP-based risk scores in MM delineate a group
of patients with adverse prognosis, but using arbitrary quartile
cutoffs on gene expression or index calculation. Most reports of
breast cancer survival prediction still consider only two risk
classes using semi-supervised predictive methods (Bair and
Tibshirani, 2004; Naderi et al., 2007).

We present here a novel survival prediction model (termed RS
for risk score) built on gene expression proﬁles of patients suf-
fering from MM (n=551), breast cancer (n=602) or glioma
(n 2460). Prognostic genes were selected without arbitrary cut-
offs. A score summing up the risk information of these prognos-
tic genes identiﬁed the maximum number of patients’ groups
showing a statistically signiﬁcant different OS, without a priori
assumption. The RS score allowed successfully classiﬁcation
within three groups of two independent cohorts of patients
with MM, breast cancer or glioma, and correlated with classiﬁ-
cation features like conventional prognostic factors, molecular
subtypes or pathological grades in both training and validation
cohorts. Finally, we provide an open-access Web site to compute
risk (RS) for any novel patient.

2.1 GEP of tumor samples

For MM, a training cohort (termed HM cohort) of 206 previously un-
treated patients with MM from the University Hospitals of Heidelberg
(Germany) and Montpellier (France) was used. Patient characteristics
have been published previously (Hose et al., 2009; Sprynski et al.,
2009). Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 GEP is available at ArrayExpress
under no E—MTAB-362 for HM cohort and E-MTAB-363 for RHM
cohort (similar to HM with novel agents in induction phase) as
puriﬁed primary malignant plasma cells, no E-MEXP-2360 for healthy
bone marrow plasma cells and E-TABM-937 for human myeloma cell
lines.

A cohort (TT2 cohort) of 345 previously untreated patients with MM
treated with the Total Therapy 2 protocol (Barlogie et al., 2006) at the
University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS, Little Rock, AR,
USA) was used for validation. Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 GEP of the TT2
cohort and the TT3 cohort including novel agents in induction treatment
are available at Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under no GSE24080.
For breast cancer, a training cohort of 285 patients whose survival data
were kindly provided by the Ligue National Contre 1e Cancer as part of
the Cartes d’Identité des Tumeurs program (http://cit.1igue—cancer.net/)
was used (CIT cohort). The corresponding molecular taxonomy is re-
ported (Guedj et al., 2012), and Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 GEP is avail-
able as E-MTAB-365 ArrayExpress dataset. A second breast cancer
cohort of 317 patients (FOO cohort) with published molecular subtyping
(Kao et al., 2011) was used for validation. Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 GEP
is available at GEO (GSE20685).

For glioma, a training cohort (NL cohort) of 272 outcome-docu-
mented patients with reported histological staging (Gravendeel et al.,
2009) was used. Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 GEP is available at GEO
database (GSE16011). The validation cohort (NIH cohort) was obtained
from the Rembrandt database (https://caintegrator.nci.nih.gov/
rembrandt/) and includes 188 clinically documented patients of 507 pa-
tients published on GEO under no GSE4290 using Affymetrix U133 Plus
2.0 chips. The clinical characteristics of patients with MM, breast cancer
and glioma are depicted in Supplementary Table S1.

2.2 Normalization of training datasets

For each cancer type, the training samples were normalized together
using the GCRMA preprocessing (Wu et al., 2004). Recorded prepro-
cessing parameters were then used to normalize each individual sample of
the validation cohort of a given cancer type. The training and validation
samples were then adjusted together for batch effect using the ComBat
Empirical Bayes method (Johnson et al., 2007).

2.3 Prognostic genes selection and score calculation in
training datasets

2.3.] Selection of prognostic genes When applied to our myeloma
training set, the stringency of methods using maximally selected rank
statistics [‘maxstat’, (Hothorn and Lausen, 2003)] led to a short and un-
usable probe set list at a false discovery rate level of 5% (Benjamini and
Hochberg, 1995). Probe sets were therefore selected for prognostic sig-
niﬁcance using a two-step multiple testing correction as follows:

(1) About half the 54 675 initial probe sets was ﬁltered out using the
‘nsFilter’ function of the ‘geneﬁlter’ R-package, eliminating
Affymetrix arrays control probes, probes without Entrez Gene
identiﬁers and the less variable genes across samples by setting
the variance cutoff at 0.15, approximately corresponding to a
65% quantile (Supplementary Fig. S1A).

(2) For each conserved probe set, the training samples were ordered
from lowest to highest expression signals. A ‘running’ log-rank test

was performed using each of these ordered signals as a cutoff point
to assess the OS difference between patient groups with a lower or
equal versus a higher signal (Supplementary Fig. S1B). The
number of expected events per group, i.e. the number of deaths
distributed in groups in the case of the null hypothesis, allowed
determining the prognostic trend. A gene is of poor prognosis if the
observed number of deaths in the high-expression group is higher
than the expected one (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Conversely, it is
considered of good prognosis if expected deaths exceed observed
ones (Supplementary Fig. S2B). The minimal number of expected
events per group was set to 2, as recommended for chi-square
calculations (Conover, 1999; Fisher, 1990), eliminating log-rank
tests on too small groups. All calculated positions of the expression
scale result in a minimal log-rank P—value adjusted according to
Benjamini and Yekutieli (Benjamini and Yekutieli, 2001) for mul-
tiple testing under dependency by dividing by the position number.

(3) The thousands of adjusted minimal log-rank P-values were then
ordered for a second step of multiple testing correction according
to their rank (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). The level of false
discovery rate was set to a maximum level of 5%. Using this
double multiple testing correction, 19 risk probe sets were selected
with a 0.05 adjusted P—value for patients with MM, 68 probe sets
with a 0.01 adjusted P—value for patients with breast cancer and 39
probe sets with almost no error (adjusted P—value <1.0E-20) for
patients with glioma.

2.3 .2 Calculation of the scorers A continuous RS ‘s’ was calculated
for each cohort sample as the difference between the sum of risk (poor
prognosis) and the sum of protective (good prognosis) GCRMA-normal-
ized expression signals of the probe sets.

2.4 Building risk groups in training datasets

Patients were ordered according to increasing s score
5 =(S1,S2,...,Sk,...,Sn) with sk 5 sk+1. Two cutoff points 5, and S],
with i e [1,n — 2] andj e [i+ 1,n — 1], were moved together in all pos-
sible score values.

The total number of possible cutoff pairs is t = 

s, and sj create three patient groups RS1, RS2 and RS3 (highest 5). The
global Xi} log-rank chi-square considering all groups, the between-con-
secutive group X52 and X53 log-rank chi-squares (excluding, respectively,
the group RS3 then group RS1 patients) and the calculated number of
deaths per group c111, c5. and cg. in the case of the null hypothesis were
simultaneously recorded. The P-values of the t global chi-squares were
adjusted according to their ranks (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995).
Possible Si, sj cutoff pairs were the score pairs for which simultaneously
(i) the adjusted global chi-square was signiﬁcant at a 5% risk, (ii) the
between-consecutive group chi-squares were both signiﬁcant at a 5% risk
and (iii) the expected events in all groups c111, c121. and c3. were greater or
equal to 2, as previously deﬁned (Conover, 1999; Fisher, 1990). The
elevated number of cutoff pairs is highly understandable, as moving a
patient from one group to the next one produced an additional cutoff
point with a close statistics. To reduce this high number, for each lower
cutoff value 5,- of the preselected cutoff pairs, the resulting global log-rank
and the two between-group log-rank chi-squares calculated for all avail-
able positions of the upper cutoff were reduced to their maximums in

recording max (Xv), max (X112), max (X123) (Supplementary
i+15j§n—1 i+l§j§n—1 1 14139—1 1

Animation). The between— group log-rank chi— squares were made compar-
able by centering on mean and reducing by standard deviation division
using the ‘scale’ R function. The smallest between-group log-rank chi-
square:

was recorded along Si. Finally, the best lower score cutoff was selected as
containing the maximum of these values:

The optimal upper cutoff contained the maximum global-log—rank chi-
square for this best lower cutoff point:

max X- - ~
i+15j5n_1( (1 optlmal)j)

Survival of the RS groups was depicted using Kaplan—Meier curves and
analyzed using log-rank statistics and Cox proportional hazard model.
Extrapolation of survival curves was performed using a parametric re-
gression model assuming a Weibull distribution ﬁt (Therneau and
Grambsch, 2000).

2.5 Validation on independent cohorts

The CEL ﬁle from each patient sample of the TT2, FOO or NIH valid-
ation cohorts was individually normalized with the processing parameters
obtained with HM, CIT or NL cohorts, respectively, using incremental
preprocessing by a modiﬁcation (MeiBner et al., 2011) of the ‘docval’
R-package (Kostka and Spang, 2008). After batch effect correction, the
expression values of the relevant signature were extracted and the s score
was individually calculated. Patients were then assigned to their RS risk
group according to the cutoffs from the relevant training cohort.

2.6 Open-access Web site for RS risk stratiﬁcation of
new patients

We provide here a simple open-access Web site (PrognoWeb, https://
g1iserv.montp.inserm.fr/PrognoWeb) automatically performing the com-
putations required to determine RS classiﬁcation for a new patient, i.e.
GCRMA normalization of the Affymetrix.EL ﬁle, extraction of the pre-
dictive list of probe sets, computation of the score and classiﬁcation ac-
cording to the 3-group risk model. The user has to upload the Affymetrix
U133 Plus 2.0.EL ﬁle into the Web site and RS and risk stratiﬁcation is
computed for any patient with MM, breast cancer or glioma within the
indicated limitations.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Gene expression-based RS and survival

Filtering the probe sets with the highest variance in the training
cohorts led to, respectively, 24 614, 27 731 and 28 821 probes for
MM, breast cancers and gliomas (Supplementary Fig. SlA). For
each probe set, the maximum signiﬁcance of the running log-
rank tests on the ordered expression scale was adjusted for the
number of patients by multiple testing correction. These signiﬁ-
cances were then grouped, sorted and adjusted for the number of
ﬁltered probe sets according to their rank. This method yielded a
selection of 19 prognostic probe sets distributing as 15 risk and 4
protective genes at an adjusted P g .05 for MM, of 68 probe sets
(37 risk and 28 protective genes, adjusted Pg .01) for breast
cancer and of 39 probe sets (12 risk and 22 protective genes,
adjusted P g 1.0E-20) for gliomas (Supplementary Tables
S2—S4). Each of the prognostic probe sets split patients’ cohorts
into two groups (Supplementary Fig. SlB), with a poor progno-
sis group comprising 7—27% of patients with MM, 4—31% of
patients with breast cancer and 37—60% of patients with gliomas.
For each cancer type, these prognostic probe sets were used to
compute the s score (Supplementary Fig. S3A) and to deﬁne the

number of patients’ groups with a different OS as indicated in the
Methods section.

3.2 Prognostic groups

Not surprisingly, the model could predict for two patients’ risk
groups with signiﬁcant different survival in the training cohorts
for the three cancer types (not shown). It could also predict for
three prognostic risk groups but not for four risk groups likely
owing to the size limitation of the training cohort.

To predict three patients’ risk groups, 20910, 40186 and
36 585 combinations of cutoff pairs were possible for myeloma,
breast cancer or glioma, respectively, of which 2756, 11054 and
16943 were accepted with the criteria of adjusted global chi-
square signiﬁcance, between-group chi-square signiﬁcance and
expected number of deaths per group (Supplementary Fig.
S3B—D).

The best combination of cutoff pairs was selected by simul-
taneously optimizing between-group log-ranks as described in
the Methods section and Supplementary Animation.
Supplementary Figure S4 displays these maximized values
plotted along the lower s score cutoff point for the different
tumor types before and after centering and reduction (arrows).
The optimal corresponding upper score cutoff is the one of the
maximum global log-rank chi-square. In the HM cohort of pa-
tients with MM, this three-group model delineated a high-risk
group (RS3, 9% of the patients) similar to that depicted in the
two-group model, but split the low-risk group into a very good
prognosis group RS1 (44% of the patients) and an intermediate-
risk group RS2 (47% of the patients). Their difference in survival
was likewise signiﬁcant (P g 3.9 x 10—3). The frequency of the s
score distribution and the position of corresponding cutoffs
are depicted in Figure 1B. The median survival was of 24
months for the high-risk RS3 group, 73% of the patients of
RS2 intermediate-risk group were surviving at 4 years
and 87% of the patients in the low-risk RS1 group at 7 years
(Fig. 1A and Table 1).

Three prognostic groups were also identiﬁed for breast cancer
with a patient distribution comparable with that of MM: a high-
risk RS3 group comprising 11% of the patients and 68% of
deceased patients at a median follow-up of 71 months and two
comparably sized intermediate RS2 and low RS1 risk groups (36
and 53% of the patients, respectively). The RS2 group comprised
23% of deceased patients and RS1 9%. Ninety-eight percent
(98%) and 90% of the patients were still alive at 4 years in
RS1 and RS2, respectively.

The shape of the Kaplan—Meier curves and the s score fre-
quency for breast cancer were comparable with those in MM
(Fig. 1C and D). For patients with life-threatening glioma, the
three-group model created a large poor prognosis RS3 group
encompassing 53% of the patients with only two still alive, a
small intermediate RS2 (15%) and a low risk RS1 group com-
prising only 32% of the patients. It should be noted that the rate
of death remained high in both RS1 and RS2, with, respectively,
25 and 22% of surviving patients (Table l). Expectedly, the s
score distribution frequency shifted toward high s values
(Fig. 1F).

Fig. 1. Three-group RS molecular modeling of overall survival. Panels
(A, C and E) display the Kaplan—Meier survival curves and log-rank tests
using the threee-group survival model, respectively, in the training and
validation cohorts. Global log-rank P—values and signiﬁcance range for
between-group log-rank P—values are indicated (*: 0.01<P§0.05, **:
0.001 <P§ 0.01, ***: P: 0.001). Histograms of RS s score distribution
and cutoffs between three groups of patients partitioned by increasing
score for the training cohorts and the validation cohorts are displayed in
panels (B, D and F)

3.3 Validation of the RS score on independent cohorts

To validate the relevance of RS classiﬁcation, any patient of a
validation cohort was considered as a single and new patient.
This was achieved by GCRMA-normalizing the patient’s raw
data using training cohort parameters, computing the continuous
s-score and assigning the patient to one of the prognostic RS
groups using the cutoffs of the training cohort. Using this ap-
proach, s-score frequencies and RS group distributions observed
in the three validation cohorts were similar to those found in the
training sets (Fig. 1). Patients of the MM validation cohort were
split into three groups accounting for 9, 46 and 45% of the pa-
tients, respectively. Survival difference was signiﬁcant both be-
tween consecutive RS groups (Pg 0.029 and P3 1.4E-04) and
globally (Pg 4.6E-07, Fig. 1A and Table l).

The three-group models were also fully validated for patients
with breast carcinoma or glioma (Fig. 1C and E and Table l).

3.4 Independence of the risk model and conventional
prognostic factors

The prognostic value of RS was compared with that of ISS
(Greipp et al, 2005) commonly used for MM in both the training
and validation cohorts (Fig. 2A). Whereas ISS had a globally
signiﬁcant prognostic value as expected, it had difﬁculties to cor-
rectly identify high-risk patients. It detected only 36% of deaths
in the ISS3 group (not shown), compared with 74% for RS3. The
log-rank between intermediate— and high-risk groups is no longer
signiﬁcant for ISS in the HM cohort (not shown). When run
together with RS in a multivariate Cox model analysis, ISS re-
mained prognostic in the myeloma validation cohort only
(Table 2), in agreement with ISS group distribution within RS
classiﬁcation (Fig. 2A).

For patients with breast cancer, the prognostic value of RS
was compared with that of molecular subtypes. Table 2 shows
that training and validation subtypes were individually signiﬁ-
cant with a lower hazard ratio than the corresponding RS. The
distribution of molecular subtypes within RS groups showed that
the RS3 high-risk group mostly comprised the worst prognosis
basal-like (basL) and molecular apocrine (mApo) subtypes in the
training cohort and their equivalent counterparts, subtypes I and
II in validation (Fig. 2B). Intermediate subtypes luminal C
(lumC) and luminal B (lumB), corresponding respectively to
III and IV in validation, were largely represented in RS2 inter-
mediate-risk group, whereas the RS1 low-risk group contains
most of the good prognosis subtypes luminal A (lumA) and
normal-like (normL), V and VI, respectively, in the CIT and
FOO cohorts. When grouping the intrinsic gene classiﬁcation
populations by their published risk, i.e. basL and mApo, lumB
and lumC, normL and lumA in the CIT cohort, and I and II, III
and IV, V and VI in the FOO cohort, allowed comparing this
three risk-level stratiﬁcation with the three-group RS model.
Low and intermediate populations almost superimpose, whereas
the RS3 classiﬁcation is more adapted at identifying the highest-
risk patients (Supplementary Fig. S5). In univariate analysis,
most subtypes were independently signiﬁcant for OS (Table 2),
whereas none remained independent when run in multivariate
analysis with the RS categories (data not shown).

The various histological types of glioma were grouped
into grades according to the WHO classiﬁcation

(Gravendeel et al., 2009). The differential survival between these
grades was strongly signiﬁcant (Pg 1.0E-l6) and revealed that
extreme RS groups clearly reﬂected prognosis with all patients
alive for the better grade I in RS1 and no survival, except one,
for the worst grade IV in RS3 (not shown). When run in a Cox
model analysis, RS and grades were both signiﬁcant even in the
validation cohort, and RS remained independent of conventional
grading (Table 2).

The distribution of the grading into the RS groups is depicted
in Figure 2C. Not surprisingly, most of RS3 patients are glio-
blastomas, grades II and III are similarly distributed in RS
groups and most of the grade I pilocytic astrocytomas classiﬁed
into the good prognosis RS1 group.

The different steps of the present risk assessment process can be
computed online on our PrognoWeb Web site either in upload-
ing personal Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 raw CEL ﬁles or using
online available test ﬁles of patients with MM, breast cancer or
glioma.

4 DISCUSSION

The aim of this study was to create an easy-to-use gene expres-
sion-based score allowing a multi-group stratiﬁcation for OS
while minimizing a priori assumptions. One mandatory assump-
tion is that GEP of a tumor sample can predict for risk provoked
by a whole tumor. In addition, tumor samples contain tumor

cells but also cells of the tumor environment, except for cancers
such as MM, for which tumor cells can be easily puriﬁed. This
bias in using a sample partly representative of the whole tumor to
assess risk cannot be easily cleared owing to ethical and econom-
ical reasons avoiding multiple tumor samples harvesting and
introduces artifactual variation in GEP, weakening the risk in-
formation. Another assumption is that gene expression could
feature risk stratiﬁcation. It is clear that the best approach will
be to monitor protein function, which is a consequence of gene
transcription, translation and further protein modiﬁcations.
Likely, the method to measure gene expression with microarrays
will be shortly greatly improved using RNA sequencing and lead
to a better model of risk stratiﬁcation. But the principles de-
veloped here will still be applicable whatever the method used
to generate the score scale.

Despite these biases, the current method made it possible to
classify independent cohorts of patients with MM, breast cancer,
or glioma into three risk groups deﬁned by different OS between
two consecutive groups. The number of risk groups that could be
predicted is dependent on the number of patients in the training
cohorts. In the current study, we used publicly available cohorts
of 200—300 patients with GEP and prognostic information as
well as a several year follow-up, leading to the ﬁnding of three
prognostic groups. Both the cohort size and the homogeneity of
the treatments per disease inﬂuenced the cutoffs stability. Larger
series of previously untreated patients should provide more in-
formation about molecular heterogeneity and allow investigating
how the RS methodology will translate this heterogeneity into
additional groups of patients with different OS, particularly in

Fig. 2. Overlap analysis of clinical or molecular classiﬁcations with RS
cancer risk groups. Distribution of multiple myeloma ISS stages (A),
breast cancer subtypes (B) and glioma grades (C) are displayed within
each corresponding RS group. Results are expressed as cohort percent-
ages to reﬂect the relative RS distribution

the highly heterogeneous breast cancer (Sotiriou and Pusztai,
2009). Interestingly, considering homogeneous populations like
healthy bone marrow plasma cells or human myeloma cell lines,
the 3 score was as expected at low risk (RS1) for healthy plasma
cells or at high risk (RS3) for myeloma cell lines (Supplementary
Fig. S7).

For building RS score, prognostic probe sets were identiﬁed
by splitting training cohorts into two prognostic groups maxi-
mizing a log-rank statistics. The selection of this probe set list
could be further reﬁned according to the ﬁnal criteria, here three
signiﬁcant prognostic groups, using, for instance, backward se-
lection. The fact that the proportion of patients to split the
cohort was not ﬁxed arbitrarily may explain why the currently
identiﬁed prognostic RS genes poorly overlap with previously
published prognostic genes. In MM, half of the 19 RS genes
were relevant to cell cycle and mitosis (Supplementary Table
S6). Only one of these genes was common to the 70 genes risk
signature from UAMS GEP70 (Shaughnessy et al., 2007) and
none with the 15 Intergroupe Francais du Myelome (IFM) genes
(Decaux et al., 2008). Comparably, none of the 70 genes of the
seminal signature of poor prognosis breast cancer (van ‘t Veer
et al., 2002) was found in the current 65 RS genes. This lack of
overlap was conﬁrmed with subsequent signatures (Finak et al.,

2008; Naderi et al., 2007; Paik et al., 2004; Parker et al., 2009). In
the same way, none to only one of the prognostic genes reported
for glioma were shared with the present 34 RS genes (Cho et al.,
2009; de Tayrac et al., 2011; Freije et al., 2004). Moreover, train-
ing and validation cohorts were swapped to test for overﬁtting,
and the whole process including initial normalization, batch
correction and survival-signiﬁcant probe set selection was run
again. Noteworthy, new 74-, 98- and 28-gene signatures
(Supplementary Tables S8—S10) were obtained, respectively, for
MM, breast cancer and glioma. Although these signatures

shared no common gene, except one (PHFI5) for breast cancer
and three (FKBP9, M T PAP and RABI8) for glioma, with the
initial ones, they could predict for three signiﬁcantly different
risk groups, close to the ones before swapping, both in the training
and validation cohorts (Supplementary Table S5 and Fig. S6).
This is in line with MicroArray Quality Control comments
emphasizing that prognostic genes are mainly useful to build
scores to identify patients with various risks, but are not relevant
to understand tumor biology in vivo (MAQC Consortium, 2010).
The prognostic genes, the computation of the RS and cutoffs are
valuable only for patients treated with therapy lines, which have
been validated in the current study. These parameters will likely
change according to treatment improvement and should be
updated regularly with publication of new data. However, RS
score remains signiﬁcant in MM treated with novel agents
(Supplementary Table S7). It is important to stress that GEP
raw ﬁles and patients’ clinical data used in various publications
should be publicly available according to MIAME recommenda-
tions (Minimum Information About a Microarray Experiment;
http://www.mged.org/Workgroups/MIAME/miame_2.0.html).

Another advantage of the present methodology is that RS
score was validated without using gene expression variance or
structure information from the validation cohorts, except for
batch correction. Each patient of a validation cohort was con-
sidered as a single patient, data normalization computed and
batch-adjusted using Affymetrix parameters from the training
cohort and RS score and risk groups computed using cutoffs
deﬁned with the training cohort. This is another major difference
with previously published transcriptome-based RS. In MM, the
GEP70 score was delineated on the TT2 cohort using expression
quartiles and was validated on their more recent, treatment-im-
proved TT3 cohort using an adapted cutoff value (Shaughnessy
et al., 2007). The same holds true for IFM score, which was
validated arbitrarily using the top 25% of patient scores on
TT2 cohort (Decaux et al., 2008). Finally, RS remained signiﬁ-
cant when compared with the currently used ISS RS in MM,
both in terms of multivariate analysis (Table 2) and survival
expression, especially for RS3 populations (Supplementary
Fig. S8).

GEP has largely been used in breast cancer over the past
decade in search for classiﬁcation patterns and survival signa-
tures (Reis-Filho and Pusztai, 2011). Most studies have sought a
dichotomic risk in bulk patient populations without addressing
disease complexity. Although built using different gene sets, most
behave similarly in outcome prediction (Fan et al., 2006). A few
used tumor subtypes to create survival indexes from clinical and
molecular data, namely, the risk of relapse (Parker et al., 2009)
and the recurrence (Paik et al., 2004). Both studies delineated a
globally signiﬁcant three-group model, but with pre—speciﬁed
cutoff points and no evidence for between-group signiﬁcance.
Our RS score, based on mathematical criteria only, also allowed
delineating three risk groups in both training and validation
breast carcinoma cohorts: a high-risk group of up to 10% and
two similarly sized intermediate— and low-risk groups with sig-
niﬁcant successive differential survival. Although a number of
four-group models were delineated in MM and breast cancer
training cohorts (not shown), the number of patients with sim-
ultaneously available clinical and microarray data has not per-
mitted to validate survival models beyond three groups for these

diseases. When affecting the molecular taxonomy to the various
RS groups of the training cohort, we found a survival distribu-
tion perfectly consistent with the clinical outcome and respecting
the disease heterogeneity (Fig. 2B). The poor outcome intrinsic
basL and mApo subtypes constitute the RS3 high-risk group and
part of the intermediate RS2 group. The latter encompasses most
of the ER+/HER2+, poor prognosis lumC and ER+ lumB,
whereas the good prognosis normL and lumA subtypes consti-
tute most of the low-risk RS1 group. Of note, this remarkable
correlation between molecular classiﬁcation and prognosis was
achieved without a proliferative signature; our 65 gene list con-
taining none of the supposedly necessary proliferation compo-
nents (Reis-Filho and Pusztai, 2011) to the exception of MKI67.
A gene enrichment analysis was unable to correlate with previ-
ously described pathways whatever the signiﬁcance threshold
(data not shown). This tight subtype—outcome association was
propagated to the validation cohort just using the training 3 score
cutoff points. The RS3 poor prognosis group contains the sub-
types I (ER'/HER2_) and II (ER'/HER2+), equivalent, respect-
ively, to the basL and mApo subtypes; the HER2+ subtype III is
included in RS2 and the ER+ subtypes V and VI again constitute
the good prognosis RS1 group. Thus, the present algorithm de-
lineates a comprehensive OS model, and suggests that with a
large enough number of documented patients, both the molecu-
lar heterogeneity and its outcome prediction could be simultan-
eously addressed.

Gliomas, the most common primary brain tumors, are cur-
rently classiﬁed according to largely variable interpretations of
histopathological features, and graded following the WHO clas-
siﬁcation (Louis et al., 2007), from the grade I best prognosis
astrocytic tumor through the anaplastic transformation between
grades 11 and III to the highly malignant grade IV glioblastoma.
In both training and validation glioma cohorts, our method per-
fectly depicts this hierarchy in detecting a majority of highly
malignant glioblastomas in the RS3 group, glioblastoma and
grade III anaplastic gliomas in RS2, but still some glioblastomas
and a comparable number of grade II and III gliomas in RS1,
reﬂecting the weakness of the current classiﬁcation to clearly
separate intermediate grade II/III gliomas. Thus our classiﬁca-
tion brings beneﬁt to a fraction of grade III and IV gliomas,
which may present a better outcome than expected. Contrarily
to MM and breast carcinoma, a four-group survival model was
signiﬁcantly delineated in the training glioma cohort and applied
to the validation cohort with marginal signiﬁcance (not shown).
In this case, the large high-risk, glioblastoma-containing group
with a median OS of 15—20 months was further split into a small
very poor prognostic group with an <l2—month survival and a
better one with a median OS of 2 years. Glioblastoma subtypes
have been deﬁned by gene expression signatures (Cooper et al.,
2010; de Tayrac et al., 2011; Li et al., 2009; Verhaak et al., 2010).
Implications like a differential expression in the MGMT enzyme
(Esteller et al., 2000) repairing chemotherapy-induced DNA
damage could be tested with larger data. Meanwhile, ﬁtting a
regression model on the survival of training and validation co-
horts and their combination in every tumor type allow to ap-
proximate the life expectancy of patients in each risk group,
namely, from high to low risk: 2, 8 and 13 years for myeloma;
4, l6 and >25 years for breast cancer and l, 3 and 6 years for
gliomas (Supplementary Fig. S9).

Finally, we think it is essential to provide easy-to-use tools that
will allow clinicians to compute individual GEP-based RSs with-
out heavy computation. A molecular classiﬁcation of glioma is
already provided with a similar input (Li et al., 2010). Thus, we
provide the open-access ‘Prognoweb’ Web site to automatically
compute the RS score for any single oncology patient with avail-
able Affymetrix ﬁles. Any report about a GEP-based RS should
provide such an open access, helping to integrate, as currently
developed (MeiBner et al., 2011), the molecular prognosis assess-
ment into the standard investigations at diagnostic or relapse.
But the user has to be aware that the way to compute the RS and
the cutoffs is valuable only for patients treated with therapy lines,
which has been validated in the current study. The computation
of RS and cutoffs will change likely according to treatment im-
provement. This recommendation is indicated in the Web site.

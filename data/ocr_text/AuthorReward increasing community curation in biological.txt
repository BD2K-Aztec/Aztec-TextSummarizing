ABSTRACT

Summary: Community curation—harnessing community intelligence
in knowledge curation, bears great promise in dealing with the flood of
biological knowledge. To exploit the full potential of the scientiﬁc com-
munity for knowledge curation, multiple biological wikis (bio-wikis)
have been built to date. However, none of them have achieved a
substantial impact on knowledge curation. One of the major limitations
in bio-wikis is insufficient community participation, which is intrinsically
because of lack of explicit authorship and thus no credit for commu-
nity curation. To increase community curation in bio-wikis, here we
develop AuthorReward, an extension to MediaWiki, to reward com-
munity-curated efforts in knowledge curation. AuthorReward quanti-
fies researchers’ contributions by properly factoring both edit quantity
and quality and yields automated explicit authorship according to their
quantitative contributions. AuthorReward provides bio-wikis with an
authorship metric, helpful to increase community participation in
bio-wikis and to achieve community curation of massive biological
knowledge.

1 INTRODUCTION

Biological knowledge is generated at ever-faster rates and dis-
persed among researchers and across literatures. As each new
biological study has become increasingly dependent on the avail-
ability of existing knowledge, comprehensive and up-to-date col-
lection of biological knowledge across a wide variety of research
ﬁelds is of critical signiﬁcance in life sciences (Clark, 2007).
Traditionally, biological knowledge has been aggregated
through expert curation, conducted manually by dedicated ex-
perts. However, with the burgeoning volume of biological data
and increasingly diverse densely informative published litera-
tures, expert curation becomes more and more laborious and
time consuming, increasingly lagging behind knowledge creation.

Accordingly, community curation—harnessing community intel-
ligence for knowledge curation—has gained signiﬁcant attention
as a solution to this issue (Salzberg, 2007; Waldrop, 2008; Zhang
et al., 2011). A successful example that engages community in-
telligence in knowledge aggregation is Wikipedia that features
up-to-date content, huge coverage and low cost for maintenance.
Spirited by the extraordinary success of Wikipedia, multiple bio-
logical wikis (bio-wikis) have been built to date (Supplementary
Table S1).

However, bio-wikis have not achieved a substantial impact on
community curation of biological knowledge (Finn et al., 2012).
One of the major limitations in bio-wikis is insufﬁcient partici-
pation from the scientiﬁc community, which is intrinsically be-
cause of lack of explicit authorship and thus no credit for
community-curated contributions (Finn et al., 2012; Howe
et al., 2008). A valuable attempt has been made to motivate
community contributions in wikis by means of social rewarding
techniques (Hoisl et al., 2007), but it does not provide explicit
authorship for any wiki page. Although authorship has been
introduced in a non-MediaWiki—based system (Hoffmann,
2008), it only links every sentence to its author but does not
provide a quantitative measure of authorship, and most import-
ant, it is inapplicable to extant bio-wikis that are largely built on
MediaWiki (a free, open source and widely used wiki engine,
which is adopted by Wikipedia). Several initiatives based on se-
mantic web technologies have already emerged for biological
knowledge management (Antezana et al., 2009). However, they
do not promise to manage or quantify authorship of the free text
in bio-wikis. To increase community curation in bio-wikis, here
we develop AuthorReward, an extension to MediaWiki, to
reward community-curated efforts in bio-wikis by contribution
quantiﬁcation and explicit authorship.

2 ALGORITHMS

MediaWiki allows anyone to develop customized functionalities
by packaging a bunch of codes as MediaWiki extensions. Thus,
AuthorReward is implemented as an extension to MediaWiki.
Although MediaWiki itself includes an infrastructure for individ-
ual contributions to be recognized, it only records the revision
history and provides no explicit authorship.

A wiki page contains a collection of knowledge on a speciﬁc
subject, where multiple researchers are most likely to collabora-
tively provide edits. AuthorReward aims to provide a viable
quantiﬁcation for researchers’ contributions in bio-wikis. A
major concern to automated authorship has been ensuring that
authorship cannot be ‘manipulated’ by spurious, short-lived edits
(Supplementary Text S1). For any wiki page p, we assume there
are a series of edit versions v0, v1, 122,. . .,v,,, where version Va is
empty and n>0. AuthorReward counts multiple successive ver-
sions edited by a researcher as one version. Thus, any neighbor-
ing versions, v,_1 and v,- (where 1 5 if n), are edited by different
researchers. The edit distance between v,- and V], termed as d(v,-, vj)
(where i< j), is computed by the Levenshtein distance (LD)
(Levenshtein, 1966) that measures the minimum number of
edit operations (insertions, deletions and substitutions) required
to transform one string into the other. In AuthorReward, the
contribution score of version vi, CS(v,-), is formulated straightfor-
wardly as

CS(Vi) = c[d(vl-_1, v”) - d(Vi, 141)], (1)

where c is the scale factor, d(v,-_ 1, V”) is the edit distance between
v,_1 and vn and d(v,-, V”) is the edit distance between v,- and V".

In Equation (1), CS(v,-) factors edit quality as well as edit
quantity in an implicit manner; the edit quantity of version vi,
QT Y(v,-), amounts to the edit distance between v,- and its previous
version v,_1, viz., d(v,-_1, vi) [Equation (2)], and the edit quality
of version vi, QAL(v,-), corresponds to whether the edit persists in
comparison with the last version vn [Equation (3)].

QT Y(Vi) = d(Vi—1,Vi) (2)

d(Vi_1, Vn) _ d(vi9 Vn)

QAL(Vi) = d(v__1 v.)

 

(3)

According to the triangle inequality, QAL(v,-) ranges from —1,
when the edits were entirely reverted, to +1, indicating that the
edits were totally preserved in the last version. Therefore,
QAL(v,-), in other words, measures how long the edit lasts in
the latest version; a high (or low) quality score is given for ver-
sion v,, if it is long-lived (or short-lived). Consequently, CS(v,-)
can be expressed by QT Y(v,-) multiplied by QAL(v,~), namely,
CS(v,-)=QTY(v,-) x QAL(v,-). Thus, CS(v,-) is not easily gamed,
providing a viable quantiﬁcation for researchers’ contributions.

Considering that one researcher may provide many discon-
tinuous edits across the evolution of a wiki page, and thereby
contribute multiple versions in one wiki page, the contribution
score of researcher r in page p, S(r, p), is quantiﬁed as the sum
over all contributed versions,

S(rap) = Z CS(Vi)9 

vieE(r, p)

where E(r, p) is a set of versions contributed by researcher r in
page p. As a consequence, the total contribution of researcher r
in a bio-wiki is termed as the sum of multiple contribution scores
in all participated pages,

5‘0) = Z S0212), (5)

peP

where P is a set of pages in which researcher r provides edits.

3 APPLICATION AND FEATURES

To test the functionality of AuthorReward, we installed it in
RiceWiki (http://ricewiki.big.ac.cn). For testing purposes, we
chose the semi-dwarﬁng gene (sdI), which is one of the most
important genes deployed in modern rice breeding and is also
known as the ‘green revolution gene’ affecting plant height of
rice. There were nine researchers collaboratively annotating the
5d] gene, providing 87 versions as of August 23, 2012
(Supplementary Table S2; http://ricewiki.big.ac.cn/index.php/
Os01g0883800).

As testiﬁed on the 5d] gene (Supplementary Fig. S1),
AuthorReward is capable of yielding sensible quantitative contri-
butions and providing automated explicit authorship, consistent
well with perceptions of all participated contributors. Moreover,
AuthorReward features good compatibility with any MediaWiki-
based system and simple installation, consequently possessing a
broad scope for its application and providing a consistent
appearance and functionality as Wikipedia.

4 CONCLUSION

AuthorReward provides bio-wikis with an authorship metric, fea-
turing robust contribution quantiﬁcation and automated explicit
authorship. When contribution is appropriately quantiﬁed and
authorship is duly rewarded, it is possible to exploit the full
potential of the scientiﬁc community in knowledge curation.

Although AuthorReward does not contribute directly to the
integration of biological knowledge, it provides a standard prac-
tice to reward community-curated efforts, which in return can
increase community participation in bio-wikis for knowledge
curation. Thus, our intention here is to produce an automated,
simple and robust authorship metric and no automated measure
will be able to gauge scientiﬁc content. AuthorReward can be
used in combination with semantic web technologies, potentially
promising a signiﬁcant advance for harnessing community intel-
ligence for knowledge curation. In addition, social rewarding
techniques (e. g. peer rating) can be used together with
AuthorReward for contribution evaluation. Moreover, it is
likely in the long term to integrate community-curated efforts
across multiple bio-wikis for each researcher, which accordingly
requires close collaborations among bio-wikis and standardized
mechanisms for individual identity recognition (e. g. OpenID at
http://www.openid.net).

AuthorReward provides a standard practice to reward commu-
nity-curated efforts in bio-wikis, and it is of interest to the sci-
entiﬁc community intending to perform knowledge curation
collectively and collaboratively in bio-wikis and also other
domain wikis.

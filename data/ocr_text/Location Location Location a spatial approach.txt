ABSTRACT

Motivation: For the analysis of rare variants in sequence data, numer-
ous approaches have been suggested. Fixed and flexible threshold
approaches collapse the rare variant information of a genomic region
into a test statistic with reduced dimensionality. Alternatively, the rare
variant information can be combined in statistical frameworks that are
based on suitable regression models, machine learning, etc. Although
the existing approaches provide powerful tests that can incorporate
information on allele frequencies and prior biological knowledge, dif-
ferences in the spatial clustering of rare variants between cases and
controls cannot be incorporated. Based on the assumption that dele-
terious variants and protective variants cluster or occur in different
parts of the genomic region of interest, we propose a testing strategy
for rare variants that builds on spatial cluster methodology and that
guides the identification of the biological relevant segments of the
region. Our approach does not require any assumption about the dir-
ections of the genetic effects.

Results: In simulation studies, we assess the power of the clustering
approach and compare it with existing methodology. Our simulation
results suggest that the clustering approach for rare variants is well
powered, even in situations that are ideal for standard methods. The
efficiency of our spatial clustering approach is not affected by the
presence of rare variants that have opposite effect size directions.
An application to a sequencing study for non-syndromic cleft lip
with or without cleft palate (NSCL/P) demonstrates its practical rele-
vance. The proposed testing strategy is applied to a genomic region
on chromosome 15q13.3 that was implicated in NSCL/P etiology in a
previous genome-wide association study, and its results are com-
pared with standard approaches.

Availability: Source code and documentation for the implementation
in R will be provided online. Currently, the R-implementation only sup-
ports genotype data. We currently are working on an extension for
VCF files.

1 INTRODUCTION

In the search for disease susceptibility loci (DSLs), genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) have been a successful instrument
for the identiﬁcation of replicable genetic associations (Manolio
et al., 2008; Hardy and Singleton, 2009). They can interrogate
almost the entire human genome for genetic associations. In
GWAS, a large set of common variants, i.e. SNPs with high
minor allele frequencies, is genotyped and tested for genetic as-
sociation with the phenotype of interest. The SNPs that are gen-
otyped on the panel of the GWAS SNP chips are typically
selected so that they are strongly correlated with the SNPs that
are not genotyped, enabling the indirect association testing of the
untyped SNPs. However, for most complex diseases, the GWAS
association signals are only able to explain a small fraction of the
overall heritability that is predicted by classical heritability ana-
lysis Wisscher et al., 2008). One possible explanation for this
phenomenon is that many of the genetic associations that are
detected by GWAS are caused by multiple rare DSLs, i.e.
minor allele frequency of <1%, that are in proximity to one of
the GWAS-SNPS (Goldstein, 2009; Manolio et al., 2009).
Because common variants are poor proxies for rare loci in asso-
ciation analysis or are not in linkage disequilibrium at all with
rare disease-causing variants, it is difﬁcult to identify and char-
acterize rare DSLs in GWAS data. By recording all genetic loci
of the region, high-throughput sequencing data contain the
required information to address the rare variant hypothesis.
Genomic regions that harbor disease-causing variants can be
pinpointed and characterized.

Consequently, the arrival of high-throughput sequencing data
for genetic studies of complex diseases poses a unique research
opportunity for the localization of DSLs. At the same time, it
constitutes a statistical challenge. Because the majority of the loci
that are recorded by high-throughput sequencing are rare, clas-
sical single locus tests for genetic association, e. g. Amitrage—trend
test (Lange and Laird, 2002), do not provide sufﬁcient power for
the underlying analysis questions. Collapsing methods have been
suggested to address this problem. Using either a ﬂexible or ﬁxed
thresholds for the minor allele frequencies of the loci that will be

included in the analysis, such methods aggregate the genotypes
of the rare variants in the genomic region for cases and controls,
and construct a genetic association test between affection status
and the genomic region. For example, one intuitive approach is
the cohort allelic sums test (CAST) that counts the number of
affected and unaffected individuals that are carriers of any rare
variant in a given sample and predeﬁned genetic region. Then,
the fraction of carriers of a rare variant is compared with the
fraction of non-carriers between cases and controls
(Morgenthaler and Thilly, 2007). Li and Leal (2008) developed
a Combined Multivariate and Collapsing (CMC) method that
collapses rare variants into a single term and jointly assesses the
effect of the collapsed rare variant term with the terms of
common variants on a given trait using multivariate analysis.
Other approaches have been suggested to account for potentially
different effect sizes of the rare variants. Madsen and Browning
(2009) proposed a weighted sum statistic in which loci are
weighted according to their allele frequencies in the group of
unaffected individuals. The weighted sum statistic approach
has been subsequently extended by Price et al. (2010), who
have generated the weights of the variants on the basis of exter-
nal information. Ioanita-Laza et al. (2011) have proposed a
method that compares the sharing patterns of rare alleles be-
tween cases and controls. Recently, general statistical frame-
works have been developed (Ioanita-Laza et al., 2011a; Neale
et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2011) that, instead of collapsing the rare
variant information, combine the information using suitable re-
gression models, statistical learning methodology, etc. However,
despite statistical challenges, the availability of rare variant/
sequencing data offers the unique opportunity to identify DSLs.

So far, although highly biologically relevant, the existing meth-
odology has ignored the information about the physical location
of the rare variants. There are several reasons why physical prox-
imity of rare variants in the genomic DNA sequence could be
important. First, proteins can be composed of functional do-
mains based on the amino acid sequence, and variants within
the same protein functional domain, which may also be located
in close proximity in the DNA sequence, could have similar
impact on disease risk (Krebs et al., 2011, Chapter 4, p. 90).
Second, variants in the same gene regulatory element (e.g. en-
hancers, insulators, silencers and non-coding RNAs) would be
physically clustered in the DNA sequence (Raab and Kamakaka,
2010). Finally, gene regulatory elements tend to cluster in certain
genomic locations, such as the promoter region. More recently,
Mathieson and McVean (2012) showed that the spatial distribu-
tion of rare variants can be used to depict population substruc-
tures. Based on the assumptions that deleterious rare variants
and protective rare variants cluster together in different genomic
regions, spatial clustering approaches can be used to construct
powerful and robust association tests for rare variants. We de-
velop such an approach that focuses on the physical position of
the variants. The approach thereby does not require prior know-
ledge about biologically relevant segments in the genomic region
of interest and about the effect size directions of the different
alleles. The methodology is computationally fast, allowing appli-
cations to whole genome sequencing studies. We assess the power
of our approach based on simulation studies and compare it with
existing methodology. In the presence of DSL clusters, the pro-
posed approaches achieve substantially higher power levels than

standard methods. This is especially true for scenarios in which
deleterious and protective variants are present. Nevertheless, in
the absence of DSL clusters, they perform as well as standard
methods. The capabilities of the approach are illustrated by an
application to a sequencing study of the genomic region that was
identiﬁed by a GWAS for non-syndromic cleft lip with or with-
out palate. Our derived distance measure yields a highly signiﬁ-
cant association between affection status and the genomic region,
whereas standard collapsing and weighting approaches do not
provide signiﬁcant results.

2 METHODS

For the analysis of rare variants, a biologically plausible hypothesis is
that alleles of rare variants that have the same type of effect on disease
risk, e. g. either deleterious or protective, occur in the same part of the
genomic region of interest. Because the parts of the genomic region that
are relevant for changes in disease risk are typically not known before the
analysis, our goal is to construct an association test for rare variant ana-
lysis that identiﬁes clusters of rare alleles and examines their effects on
disease risk. In the analysis of spatial data (Kowalski et al., 2002; Bonetti
and Pagano, 2005), the distribution of the physical distances between
events is used to detect the spatial clustering of events. We will apply
the same idea here to the analysis of rare variants and their genotypes.

In a ﬁrst step, we identify the cumulative frequencies of all detected
variants in cases and controls, and apply inverse frequency weights to
each detected rare variant. We then combine the information on the 10-
cations of the rare variants in the cases and in the controls, and derive the
distribution functions of genomic distances between the rare alleles in
both groups. Next, we construct a test statistic that is suitable to capture
differences between the distance distribution functions for the two
groups. Because the test statistic will be driven by the different clustering
of the variant locations in the case and control groups, the power of the
test statistic is not negatively inﬂuenced by the presence of different effect
directions in the region, i.e. deleterious alleles and protective alleles.

Because the hypothesis is that DSLs with the same effect direction
cluster in the same genomic region, the differences between the distribu-
tion functions are particularly of interest for the small genomic distances.
We therefore introduce a test that captures the information of both, the
degree of skewness of the two allelic distributions towards small distances
and the systematic differences of the actual physical positions of the rare
variants between cases and controls. The statistical signiﬁcance of the
discussed test statistic is obtained by permutations that randomly
assign case/control status to the study population while maintaining the
total number of cases and controls.

We assume that a deﬁned genomic region has been sequenced in N
subjects in the context of a case—control study, recording the physical
position on a total of K rare variants and their genotypes. We denote
each detected rare variant as k,- with i = 1, ..., K.

Every variant k,- shows a minor allele frequency that is smaller than a
pre—speciﬁed threshold value. Because, for rare variant analysis, there is
usually not sufﬁcient power to detect genetic associations with a single
locus, we combine the information about the frequencies and locations of
the rare variants over the disease status in our sample.

Each detected variant k,- is also associated with a physical position j,,
and j = (fl , ...,jK) represents the vector that contains all physical positions
of the K variants in the sample in ascending order.

The allele frequency of each rare variant can be estimated separately in
cases and controls. We deﬁne n? to be the number of rare alleles in cases
at variant ki, and n? to be the respective observed number of rare alleles
in controls.

We receive a total of n“ 2 21:1 n? rare alleles in the cases and a total

of n“ = 1 n? rare alleles in the controls.

A spatial approach for rare variant analysis

 

To emphasize the importance of spatial proximity between variants
and to control for an uneven distribution of the allelic frequencies, we
deﬁne weights that are both cluster and frequency dependent. The phys-
ical positions of the variants are incorporated into the weights by deter-
mining the distance to the nearest neighbor variant for each variant k,- in
the sorted positional vector j that contains the physical positions of all
detected variants:

 

, IJi —ji+1|)

Madsen and Browning (2009) and Ionita-Laza et al. (2011b) have
shown that depending on whether a variant has a disease-causing or
protective effect, efﬁcient weighting schemes can be constructed based
on the allele frequency of the rare variants in only either controls or
cases. For cases and controls, we deﬁne separately inverse frequency
weights that weigh variants based on their minor allele frequency and
combine these frequency weights with the information about the physical
position of the variants. Our weighting scheme for each detected variant
k,- based on the distribution of variants in cases, is given by:

(M)
wa "il'l'l

ji, min = mind/1' —ji—1

 

- — +.—
l logotmin +1)

The weighting scheme for each variant k,- based on the distribution of
the variants in controls is deﬁned as:

(1“)
Wu n2+1

 

- = + .—
1 1080i, min + 1)

Thus, for a variant k,, the rounded to integer allele counts in cases and
controls weighted by the distribution of variants in cases are given by:

a
z, w?

a

m ] and mlyw? = [nﬁ‘wf]

And accordingly for a given variant k,, the rounded to integer allele
counts for cases and controls weighted by the distribution of variants in
controls are given by:

 w? = [nfwé’] and  w? = [nﬁ‘wj’]

In the next step, we create sequences where the physical positions j,- of
variants k,- are replicated according to the detected weighted allele counts.

The variant position sequences for cases and controls weighted accord-
ing to the distribution of variants in cases are given by:

mil w‘.’  w‘.’
, l and SIS)“ = {Sj} '

2
Sad = {Sj}j=1 j=1

And synonymously we derive the position sequences for cases and
controls weighted on the distribution of variants in controls as:
Zmelf Zmelf
Sau = {Sj}j:1 ' and Sﬂéu = {Sj}j:1 '

W

Our goal is to construct a test statistic that assesses the spatial prox-
imity between variants of each group. For variants that increase disease
risk, we assume that their locations tend to be spatially clustered in a
certain part of the genomic region. Variants that are protective or have no
effect on disease risk are assumed to either cluster in a different part of the
genomic region or have a weaker or no tendency to cluster.

For each weighting scheme, we derive the distributions of the rare
allele distances in cases and controls. We obtain the distances between
two adjacent alleles by subtracting the variant location of one allele from
the variant location with the next larger position order. It is important to
note that, if a rare allele at one locus is observed multiple times in cases or
controls, then the corresponding distances between them are zero.

For the weighting scheme based on the frequencies of variants in cases,
we receive the following distance vectors for cases and controls:

D3)“ : (alliwa, ..., dﬁA"_1,wa)a D3111 : (diliw‘l’ "'9 dITAII—I,Wa)

with the elements Wu, ..., dﬁ A“_1,wa and Wu, ..., dll‘ A“_1,w, representing
the derived distances between the weighted variant positions.

And accordingly, for the weighting scheme that incorporates the vari-
ant allele frequencies of controls, we can display the distance vectors of
cases and controls as:

D3)” : (alliwu, ..., dﬁA"_1,wu)aD1‘:u : (diliwu’ "'9 dITAII—I,Wu)

It is important to note that the applied weighting schemes thereby
solely inﬂuence the skewness of the derived distance distribution func-
tions, but have no impact on the values of the observed non-zero
distances.

Based on the allelic distance distributions in cases and controls, we
now construct our location-based association test for rare variant data,
and apply it separately for each weighting scheme. In the test statistic, we
want to incorporate the information about both, the allele frequencies of
the rare variants and the physical distances between the rare variants; the
statistic has to take into account both the skewness of the distance dis-
tribution functions and the variance of the derived distances for cases and
controls. In most settings, the derived distance distribution functions will
be highly right skewed and have the same median so that rank-based tests
that rely on the median (e. g. Wilcoxon rank sum test) will not provide
efﬁcient power. Similarly, non-parametric tests that directly rely on the
shape of the distance distribution functions (e. g. KolmogorOV—Smirnov
test) will concentrate on the difference in the skewness of the distance
distribution functions. However, they ignore information about the
actual physical distances between the rare variants.

One alternative approach to directly compare the two weighted dis-
tance distribution functions is the application of a non-parametric
two-sample test on the variability of the distance distribution functions.
Ansari and Bradley (1960) have developed such a test that directly exam-
ines the dispersion of two independent distribution functions—
Z: {x1, ...,xm,y1, ...,yn}—and sorts the values in an increasing
order so that Z = {21, ...,zN}. The function V,- displays the distribution

of ranked positions from both samples with V,- =  

The Ansari—Bradley test statistic can then be expressed as

 

i=1

The Ansari—Bradley test assumes the same location parameter for the
tested two independent distribution functions and tests for differences in
the ratio of scales. The scale of a distribution function describes its
spread, i.e. the scale of a normal distribution is deﬁned by its variance.

Because we apply two different weighting schemes on each sample, we
obtain two test statistics for the Ansari—Bradley test: one test statistic for
the distance distribution functions weighted on the distribution of vari-
ants in cases and another one for the distance distribution functions
weighted on the distribution of variants in controls.

We deﬁne s“ to be the ratio of scales weighted by the distribution of
variants in cases and s“ to be the ratio of scales of the two derived dis-
tance distribution functions weighted on the distribution of variants in
controls.

For both weighting schemes, we independently test whether the ratio
of scales (s) of the weighted distance distribution functions for cases and
controls is equal to one.

(1) Ho 2s“ = 1 versus H1 :s“ 751
(2) H0 2s“ = 1 versus H1 :s“ 751

We select the maximum of both test statistics based on our hypotheses
(1) and (2) as our ﬁnal test statistic.

A rejection of the null hypothesis implies an association of the tested
rare variants in the region with affection status. Because of the likely
presence of tied observations in the distance distribution functions, we
use an implementation of the standard Streitberg/Roehmel shift

algorithm to retrieve exact distribution functions for our test statistics
(Streitberg and Roehmel, 1986).

The signiﬁcance of the test statistic is obtained based on permutations.
In each replicate, case—control status is randomly assigned to each pro-
band in such a way that the total number of cases and controls of the
original study is maintained. The genotypes of the probands are kept
ﬁxed, maintaining the LD structure of the region in the permutation
sample. The P—Value is estimated as the proportion of permutation test
statistics, which are more “extreme” than the actually observed test stat-
istic for the real data.

For the application of our approach to dosage data, i.e. those datasets
that contain genotype probabilities instead of allele counts, we recom-
mend calculating the expected allele count for each subject and variant k,-
on the basis of the genotype probabilities and applying our method with-
out modiﬁcations.

Using simulation studies, we evaluate the performance and power of
the Ansari—Bradley test based on the weighted distance distribution func-
tions. We also apply our analysis approach to a sequencing dataset for
non-syndromic cleft lip with or without palate to demonstrate its practical
relevance.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Simulation study

3.1.1 Generation of the data For the generation of the genetic
data in the simulation study, we implemented the model as
described in the simulation study by Ionita—Laza et al. (2011b).
We deﬁned the mutation rate to be 1.5 x 10_8 and simulated
5000 haplotypes with 500 000 base pairs. Subsequently, we se-
lected 30 SNPs with a predeﬁned upper MAF cutoff. Based on
two randomly chosen haplotypes, we used an additive disease
model with a disease prevalence of 0.15 to derive our genotypes.
We assigned an invariant risk ratio of 3.0 to each SNP that has a
causal inﬂuence on the affection status. We repeated the last step
for each speciﬁcation until we received a sample of 500/ 500 cases
and controls or 750/750 cases and controls.

3.1.2 Specifications of simulation runs We applied different
simulation scenarios to examine the type 1 error and power of
our proposed methods.

In the following, we refer to the proposed rare variant test
statistics based on the allelic distances as distance-based measure
(DBM).

Moreover, we compare the proposed test statistic with some of
the existing statistical methods that relate rare variants to a di-
chotomous phenotype: the CMC approach (Li and Leal, 2008)
that assigns equal weights to each rare variant, two methods that
use weighting schemes based on allele frequencies or prior bio-
logical knowledge (Madsen and Browning, 2009; Price et al.,
2010), the replication-based strategy of Ionita-Laza et al.
(2011b) that suggests a weighting scheme based on those alleles
that are present more often in cases compared with controls and
two ﬂexible regression-based methods that test the variance of
effects for a given set of rare variants (Neale et al., 2011; Wu
et al., 2011).

We denote the test statistic of Li and Leal (2008) as CMC, the
test statistic of Madsen and Browning (2009) as MB, the test
statistic of Price et al. (2010) as Price, the test statistic of
Ionita-Laza et al. (2011b) as RB, the test statistic of Wu et al.

(2011) as SKAT and the test statistic of Neale et al. (2011) as
C-Alpha.

For the simulations, we ﬁrst differentiated between two differ-
ent settings that relate to the physical distribution of the rare
variants in the derived samples. In the clustered scenario
(Clustered =Yes), all variants that have a disease-causing effect
are sampled as a sequence with close physical close position to
each other, whereas the remaining non-causative/protective vari-
ants and their physical positions are randomly sampled outside
this sequence. In the non-clustered scenario (Clustered = No), the
physical position of all selected variants is randomly assigned.
The degree of clustering of the simulated variants, i.e. the dis-
tances between the associated loci, was thereby chosen according
to the observed degree of clustering for the real dataset that we
used for the application of our method (Section 3.2).

Next, we varied the sample size between 500/ 500 cases and
controls or 750/750 cases and controls. In all derived different
scenarios, we examined two different upper MAF thresholds,
namely 1% and 0.5%, to evaluate the sensitivity of the presented
measures to different MAF cutoffs. We used 1000 replicates to
evaluate the type 1 error and 500 replicates to estimate the power
of each approach. All showed estimates result from two-sided
testing. The P—Values used for the type 1 error evaluation and for
the power estimates are based on 1000 permutations.

3.1.3 Evaluation of type 1 error Table 1 shows the simulation
results for the type 1 error for the outlined scenarios. We chose
two different signiﬁcance levels—a 20.05 and a: 0.01—to
evaluate the type 1 error. The simulation study results suggest
that our approach maintains the type 1 error.

3.1.4 Power estimates For the power estimates of the meth-
ods, we included one additional speciﬁcation in the outlined
scenarios. In a ﬁrst setting, we assumed that, for all 10 DSLs,
the rare allele increases the disease risk. In a second setting, we
assumed the simultaneous presence of deleterious and protective
effects, i.e the rare alleles of seven DSLs are disease causing,
whereas the rare alleles of three DSLs have a protective effect.

Based on 500 replicates, Table 2 shows the power estimates
between the affection status and the sequenced rare variants in a
non-clustered scenario for the following methods: CMC, Price,
MB, RB, SKAT, C-Alpha and DBM.

The power estimates for the non-clustered scenario show that
our constructed DBM had a better performance than the collap-
sing approach (CMC), the two methods based on weighting
schemes (Price, MB) and the SKAT and C-Alpha test, when
the effect direction of the causative rare variants is the same.

In the case of mixed-effect directions of the causative variants,
the SKAT and C-Alpha test showed more power in one of the
four outlined scenarios compared with the DBM method.

The replication-based measure (RB), however, outperformed
all other compared methods (CMC, Price, MB,SKAT and
C-Alpha) in all speciﬁed simulation runs in the non-clustered
scenario. For a rather small MAF cutoff (MAF <0.005), the
power advantage of the RB method compared with our DBM
for the non-clustered scenario became similar though. In general,
the simulation studies suggest that our approach achieves power
levels that are comparable with the power levels of current

methodology, even in scenarios where there is no clustering of
variants.

Table 3 provides the power estimates of the outlined speciﬁ-
cations (10 DSLs that increase the disease risk, and accordingly 7
risk DSLs and 3 protective DSLs) and speciﬁed methods (CMC,
Price, MB, RB, SKAT, C-Alpha and DBM) for a clustered scen-
ario. For the clustered scenario, the power estimates are also
based on 500 replicates.

Because all compared methods except the DBM method are
not sensitive to location clustering of the variants, the power es-
timates of CMC, Price, MB, RB, SKAT and C-Alpha did not
differ considerably in the clustered and non-clustered scenario.

Our constructed distance-based measure (DBM), however, is
sensitive to physical closeness of variants, and thus showed far
more power in a clustered scenario than in a non-clustered scen-
ario. This power gain had the consequence that in the clustered
scenario our distance-based measure (DBM) showed the highest
power estimates in all simulation runs compared with the other
methods (CMC, Price, MB, RB, SKAT and C-Alpha).

The power advantages of the DBM method compared with
the replication-based measure (RB) ranged from 1 to ~35%
when only risk variants are present in the simulated genomic
region. The power advantage of the DBM measure was thereby
greater for the smaller MAF-cut off. When both risk and

protective variants are deﬁned in the simulation runs, our
newly introduced measure showed even more power compared
with the other methods. In one simulated setting, the DBM
measure had a power advantage of >60% compared with the
next best performing method (RB). It is important to note, how-
ever, that the power estimates of all outlined methods were
reduced in simulation runs where variants with opposed effect
directions were included.

In addition, we also re—ran some of our simulations with a
constant genetic attributable risk to conﬁrm our qualitative con-
clusion about the performance of the different methods (data not
shown).

3.2 Application of the discussed approach to a sequencing
dataset 0n non-syndromic cleft lip with or without
cleft palate

We applied the discussed approach to a sequencing study on
non-syndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NSCL/P).
The dataset was generated by a follow-up sequencing of 96 cases
and 96 controls in gremlin—l (GREMl), a candidate gene located
in a genomic region at 15q13.3 that was identiﬁed as a suggestive
NSCL/P locus in a GWAS by Mangold et al. (2010). GREMl is
coding for a known antagonist of the bone morphogenic protein
4 (BMP4). BMP4 has been shown to regulate mammalian pala-
togenesis (Zhang et al., 2002) and has been reported to be asso-
ciated with orofacial clefting in humans (Suzuki et al., 2009). The
follow-up sequencing of both 5’ and 3’ UTR, as well as coding
regions GREMl, resulted in a discovery of 27 variants with an
MAF between 0.003 and 0.573.

Figure 1 depicts the spatial distribution of the 14 detected rare
variants (MAF 5 0.05), with an MAF range of 0.003—0.029 for
cases and controls. Although the discovered rare variants in con-
trols are rather equally distributed on the chromosome, it can be
seen for the groups of cases that four rare variants tend to
cluster.

For our proposed distance-based approach (DBM), we select
two different MAF cutoffs (1 and 5%) and compared them with
the other methods (CMC, RB, Price and MB). Table 4 shows the
P—Values of our derived distance-based test statistic (DBM) com-
pared with the other outlined collapsing and weighting methods.

It can be seen that our newly introduced measure (DBM) ﬁnds
a highly signiﬁcant association of the sequenced 15q13.3 region
at both deﬁned upper MAF cutoffs, whereas the other methods
(CMC, Price, MB, RB, SKAT and C-Alpha) fail to detect a
signiﬁcant association at a 5% signiﬁcance level. Before the ap-
plication of our method to real data, one should perform simu-
lation studies to determine a suitable window size as for the other
mentioned rare variant association tests, given the sample size
and the assumption of the disease parameters, i.e. prevalence,
effect size, etc. For the application of our variant position-based
test, the window size should be chosen according to the spatial
distribution of the variants on the chromosome, so that variant
clusters are not separated.

4 CONCLUSION

So far, existing statistical methodology for association analysis
has ignored the physical locations of the variants. In this

communication, we have proposed a class of methods to test
the association of rare variants to a dichotomous trait that in-
corporates the underlying spatial distribution structure of the
rare variants. Our method is based on statistical clustering meth-
odology. Instead of collapsing or combing the genotypes of rare
variants in the genomic region of interest, our test statistic takes
advantages of physical distances/locations of the alleles at the
rare variant loci and detects rare variant patterns that are differ-
ent between cases and controls. As a result, we obtain a new class
of association tests for rare variant analysis that can aid the
localization of the biological relevant segments in the analyzed
genomic region. As for any rare variant approach,
subpopulation—speciﬁc patterns in the variant distribution can
bias the analysis results of our test statistic. Although the ﬁnd-
ings of Mathieson and McVean (2012) suggest that reasonable
amounts of subpopulation—speciﬁc variant distributions do not
severely affect the existing rare variant analysis approaches, care-
ful QC of the data, i.e. detection of population substructure and
outlier-removal accordingly, is mandatory before the application
of our approach. One approach here could be to apply our test-
ing strategy to known null regions, i.e. regions without any gen-
etic effects, and compare the performance of the test statistic in
these regions with the genomic region of interest. The detection
of population substructure is especially important, if samples
from other studies or sources, such as the 1000 Genome
Project, are included in the analysis to increase the statistical
power.

It is important to note, however, that our method is best suited
for high coverage sequencing data to detect and test the spatial
structure of variants. SNP data that were obtained from GWAS
SNP chips, because of the pre-deﬁned SNP locations on such
chips, offer only limited information on the spatial distribution
of variants in a genomic region. Moreover, the presented method
also has limitations in testing aggregated, but positional uncon-
nected, genome regions, like non-coding regions.

For now, we focus on a very intuitive test statistic that com-
pares the two distance distributions between cases and controls,
using a Ansari—Bradley test statistic. Currently, we are working
on an extension of the approach that allows the integration of
covariates in the test statistic and to generalizations to quantita-
tive traits.

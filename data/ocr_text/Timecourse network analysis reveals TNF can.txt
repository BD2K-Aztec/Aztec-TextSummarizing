ABSTRACT

Motivation: Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (T NF-a), a major
inflammatory cytokine, is closely related to several cardiovascular
pathological processes. However, its effects on the cell cycle of
vascular endothelial cells (VECs) have been the subject of some
controversy. To investigate the molecular mechanism underlying this
process, we constructed time-course protein—protein interaction
(PPI) networks of TNF-a induced regulation of cell cycle in VECs
using microarray datasets and genome-wide PPI datasets. Then,
we analyzed the topological properties of the responsive PPI
networks and calculated the node degree and node betweenness
centralization of each gene in the networks. We found that p21,
p27 and cyclinD1, key genes of the G1/S checkpoint, are in the
center of responsive PPI networks and their roles in PPI networks
are significantly altered with induction of TNF-a. According to the
following biological experiments, we proved that TNF-01 can promote
Gl/S transition of cell cycle in VECs and facilitate the cell cycle
activation induced by vascular endothelial growth factor.

1 INTRODUCTION

Tumor necrosis factor—01 (TNF—a), a major inﬂammatory cytokine,
plays a pivotal role in cardiovascular disease and induces multiple
changes in vascular endothelial cells (VECs), which affect several
pathological processes including tumor angiogenesis (Bradley,
2008; Zhang et 611., 2009). In addition to its well—characterized
properties such as altered cell adhesion and increased apoptosis,
TNF—oz also modulates the cell cycle in VECs (Fajardo 61611., 1992;
Lindner et 611., 1997; Wojciak—Stothard et 611., 1998). However, its
effects on the cell cycle processes of VECs have been the subject
of some controversy. Previous studies indicate that TNF—oz induces
cell cycle arrest and blocks proliferation of VECs (Dormond 61611.,
2002). Inhibition of TNF—oz accelerates endothelial recovery after
angioplasty (Krasinski et 611., 2001). Frater—Schroder et 611. (1987)
found that TNF—oz can enhance VECs proliferation and enhance
angiogenesis in rabbit cornea assays. Fajardo et 611. (1992) revealed

that low doses of TNF—oz can increase DNA synthesis and decrease
the proportion of G1 phase cells. Moreover, our recent studies
showed that TNF—a—induced cell cycle may be regulated by dynamic
pathway interactions in VECs (Huang and Li, 2010) and that there is
a complex gene network behind TNF—a—induced cell cycle processes
in VECs (Gu et 611., 2010). We also demonstrate the advantages
of protein—protein interaction (PPI) networks in studies of disease
mechanisms and drug actions (Li et 611., 2011; Wu et 611., 2008;
Zhao and Li, 2010). In this study, we constructed time—course
PPI networks of TNF—a—induced regulation of cell cycle in VECs
and analyzed their topological properties to reveal the molecular
mechanisms underlying TNF—a—induced cell cycle processes.

2 METHODS

2.1 Time-course microarray dataset

A time—course microarray dataset of TNF—oz—stimulated human umbilical vein
endothelial cells (HUVECs) was downloaded from NCBI gene expression
omnibus (GEO) database: GSE9055, Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus
2.0 Array, HUVECs stimulated with 10ng/m1 TNF—oz, 0—8 h (Wada 61 611.,
2009). Original CEL format ﬁles were processed and normalized by dChip
(Li and Wong, 2001). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were selected
as those with base—2 log—transformed fold changes > 1.0 (fold change >2.0)
by comparing the gene expression value at the corresponding time point with
the value at time zero. Then all the probe sets were mapped to known Entrez
genes. To avoid noise caused by lowly expressed genes, we ﬁltered out genes
which were lowly expressed in HUVECs across 100 arrays collected from
GEO.

2.2 Gene Ontology assay

DEGs from each of 16 time points were used to enrich to Gene Ontology
(GO) terms, ‘regulation of apoptosis’ (GO:0042981), ‘regulation of cell
adhesion’ (GO: 0030155), ‘regulation of metabolic process’ (GO:0019222)
and ‘regulation of cell cycle’ (GO:0051726) by DAVID Bioinformatics
Resources 6.7 (Dennis 61611., 2003) (Supplementary Fig. S1). Those DEGs
related to term ‘regulation of cell cycle’ in each time point were deﬁned
as ‘seed’ genes to construct the time—course responsive PPI networks
(Supplementary Table S 1).

2.3 Construction of PPI networks

ClustEx (v0.31) (Gu 61611., 2010) was used to construct PPI networks from
two inputs: one is the global background PPI network, which was gathered
by merging the Human Protein Reference database (HPRD, v8.0) (Keshava
Prasad 61 611., 2009; Peri 61 611., 2003) and the BioGRID database (v2.0.58)
(Stark 61 611., 2006). The background PPI network remained the same in
the whole study. The other input was the seed genes at each time point
as described in Section 2.2, which were used as starting nodes to identify

the corresponding gene module (the ‘responsive PPI network’) from the
background PPI network.

For each of the 16 time points, we used those DEGs which were
also annotated as ‘regulation of cell cycle’ in the GO database as the
seed genes. We constructed one responsive PPI network for each time
point using ClustEx (Supplementary Table S2, Supplementary Fig. S2—S4).
Meanwhile, genes in responsive PPI networks were enriched to KEGG
pathway (Supplementary Table S3) by DAVID Bioinformatics Resources 6.7
(Dennis 61611., 2003)

2.4 Topological property analysis of PPI networks

Protein—protein networks were considered to be a type of undirected network.
The clustering coefﬁcient Cof a network is deﬁned as


l

where N is the total number of nodes in the connected network. C,- is the
clustering coefﬁcient of node i which is deﬁned as

C _ 2e,-
’_h®—D’

where 16,- is the number of neighbors of node i and el- is the number of
connected pairs between all neighbors (Assenov et 611., 2008). Node degree
of node i is the number of edges linked to the node (Assenov et 611., 2008).
Betweenness centrality of a node i in an undirected network is deﬁned as

__ 6L0) (N—1)(N—2)
19,— Z W /(—2 

S;éi;él‘

where s and t are nodes in the network different from n, 61),, is the number
of shortest paths from s to t, ¢3t(i) is the number of shortest paths from s to
t that n lies on and N is the total number of nodes in the network (Assenov
61 611., 2008)

Each gene’s node degree and node betweenness centrality in each PPI
network at each time point were normalized. The normalized node degree

at time j, was deﬁned as
(dij—Mj)
Di]: —,
(71'
where 111- is the average node degree of the network at time point

j, MjZZdl‘j/ZVJ' and 01-: Z(dij-/Lj)2/(N—1). Node betweenness

centralization was normalized using the same method. Total node degree
is deﬁned as D,- = ZDl‘j and total node betweenness centrality is deﬁned as

2.5 Cell culture

HUVECs were isolated from freshly obtained human umbilical cords by
established methods (Yan 61611., 2010). Cells were grown on gelatin—coated
dishes in standard endothelial cell medium (ECM, ScienCell Research
Laboratories). ECM consists of 500 ml of basal medium, 25 ml of fetal
bovine serum, 5ml of endothelial cell growth supplements and 5ml of
penicillin/streptomycin solution. Cells used for this study were from passages
4—6 and maintained at 37°C in a humidiﬁed atmosphere of 5% C02 in air.

2.6 Cell cycle assay

HUVECs were plated in 60 mm dishes (50 000 cell/cmz) and cultured for
48 h. Cells were conﬂuent before stimulation (~120 000 cell/cmz). Cells
were harvested and ﬁxed in 70% ethanol and stored at —20°C overnight.
Cells were washed twice with ice—cold phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and
incubated with RNase and propidium iodide for 30 min and then cell cycle
analysis was performed by a Flow CytoMeter (FCM).

2.7 Western blot

Proteins from cells were extracted with RIPA lysis buffer [150 mM NaCl,
10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1% NP40, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, protease
inhibitor cocktail (Roche)]. Proteins from total cell lysates were resolved by
10% SDS—PAGE gel, transferred to the nitrocellulose membrane, blocked
in 5% non—fat milk in PBS/Tween—20, blotted with the antibodies with
recommend dilutions (Cell Signalling) and blotted with Goat anti Rabbit
IgG (13000, Santa Cruz). Visualization of the second antibody was
performed using a chemiluminescence detection procedure according to the
manufacturer’s protocol (Amersham Phannacia Biotech). GAPDH was used
as loading control.

2.8 Experimental statistics
All experimental results were expressed as means:l:SD unless indicated

otherwise. Differences between two groups were assessed by two—tailed
Student’s t—test, and P < 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Responsive PPI networks of TNF-oz-induced cell
cycle process in HUVECs

DEGs at each time point were enriched to biological processes
term of GO. Result showed that the term ‘regulation of cell cycle’
(GO: 0051726) was signiﬁcantly associated with stimulation by
TNF—01 in VECs (Supplementary Fig. 81). Thirty—ﬁve DEGs were
associated with the term ‘regulation of cell cycle’ during induction
(Supplementary Table S 1), and their gene expressions were clustered
as shown in Figure 1A. These genes were deﬁned as ‘seed’ genes to
construct time—course responsive PPI networks by ClustEx. Results
showed that the number of nodes (gene) and number of edges
(gene—gene interaction) in the responsive PPI networks increased
with stimulation of TNF—01 (Fig. 1B). The average number of
neighbors and clustering coefﬁcient also increased with stimulation
of TNF—01 (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that TNF—01 might activate
a signaling transduction cascade to regulate cell cycle processes
(Supplementary Table S3).

Normaiized node betweenness centralization

Fig. 2. Network centrality of time—course PPI networks of TNF—oz—induced
regulation of cell cycle. (A) Node degree and betweenness centralization
of each gene in the time—course PPI networks were analyzed as described
in Section 2. Those nodes which had both normalized node degree
and normalized betweenness centralization >1 are marked with their
gene symbol and their detailed information are listed in Supplementary
Table S4. (B and C) Normalized node degree and normalized betweenness
centralization of CDKNlA (p21), CDKNlB (p27) and CCNDl (cyclinDl)
in the time—course PPI network show the dynamic relationship between these
core genes and the whole networks.

3.2 TNF-oz altered topological properties of p21, p27
and cyclinDl in the responsive PPI networks

To determine the key genes of TNF—oz—induced regulation of cell
cycle, we analyzed each gene’s node degree and node betweenness
centrality in each responsive PPI network. We added up the
normalized node degree and the normalized betweenness centrality
of each gene to calculate the total node degree and total betweenness
centrality and determine the importance of each gene in the
whole process. We found that CDKN1A(p21), CDKN1B(p27) and
CCND1(cyclinD1), the key genes of the G1/ S checkpoint, were also
the most important key genes in the responsive PPI networks of
TNF—oz—induced regulation of cell cycle (Fig. 2A). Node degree and
node betweenness of p21 and cyclinDl were signiﬁcantly changed
with induction of TNF—01 and p27 was signiﬁcantly changed at the
ﬁrst 2 h, but it remained stable in the following time points (Fig. 2B
and C). These results suggested that the G1/S checkpoint might be
one of the most important targets of TNF—oz—induced regulation of
cell cycle.

3.3 TNF-oz promotes G1/S transition of cell cycle in
VECs and facilitates the cell cycle activation
induced by VEGF

To determine if TNF—01 could alter the G1/S checkpoint of VECs,
we ﬁrst got quiescent HUVECs (Supplementary Fig. S2). Then, we
treated quiescent HUVECs as shown in Figure 3A. After inductions,
the cells were harvested for cell cycle assay. Results showed that 8 h
after induction with TNF—oz, the percentage of VECs in S phase was
not signiﬁcantly different from the ECM—treated control (Fig. 3B),
but after 24h the percentage of VECs in S phase was signiﬁcantly
increased in both groups of pulse induction of TNF—01 (for 8 h) and
continuous induction of TNF—01 (for 24 h) (Fig. 3C). At the same
time, 8 h of induction by TNF—01 also signiﬁcantly promoted VEGF—
induced cell cycle (Fig. 3C). In western blot, the expression of p21,
p27 and cyclinDl were sensitive to stimulation of TNF—01 at the

Fig. 3. TNF—01 promotes G1/S transition of cell cycle in VECs which
facilitate the cell cycle activation induced by VEGF. (A) As shown in the
ﬂow chart, quiescent VECs were treated with TNF—01 (10 ng/ml) or media
ECM alone for 8 h and then cells were induced with different cytokines for
the following 16h. During this process, the concentration of TNF—01 and
VEGF were both 10 ng/ml. ‘VEGF/TNF’ shows cells that were treated with
TNF—01 (10 ng/ml) and VEGF (10 ng/ml) together. (B) Quiescent VECs were
treated with TNF—01 (10 ng/ml) or ECM for 8 h and then cells were harvested
for FCM. Result shows mean :I: SD for triplicate independent experiments
(*P<0.05). (C) Quiescent ECs were treated with different cytokines as
indicated and then cells were harvested for FCM. Results show mean :I: SE
for triplicate independent experiments (>1<P < 0.05). (D) Quiescent ECs were
treated with TNF—01 (10 ng/ml) or media control for 2, 4 and 8 h and then G1/S

relative expression by gray level. (E) Quiescent VECs were treated with

protein level. Four hours induction of TNF—01 was enough to change
the expression of p21 and p27, and 8h induction was enough to
increase the expression of cyclinDl. We used phosphorylated Rb
as marker of G1/S transition. Results showed that the expression
of phosphorylated Rb is consistent with cell cycle assay (Fig. 3D
and E). All these results showed that TNF—01 can promote G1/S
transition of cell cycle in VECs and facilitate the cell cycle
activation—induced VEGF.

4 DISCUSSION

Quiescent VECs can rapidly reverse in response to signaling from
the microenvironment; however, tight regulation of the cell cycle
is necessary for VECs, for one of the most important properties
of VECs is to separate blood from underlying tissues (Augustin
et 611., 2009; Dejana, 2004). In the present study, VEGF treatment
alone doubled the number of cells in S phase after 24h (Fig. 3C,
ECM/VEGF). An 8 h pulse of TNF—01 followed by removal of TNF—01
(TNF/ECM) nearly tripled the amount of cells in S phase and,

strikingly, an 8 h pulse of TNF—01 followed by treatment with VEGF
alone (TNF/VEGF) caused the highest amount of S phase induction.
Conversely, continuous treatment with TNF—01 for 24h (TNF/TNF)
or addition of VEGF after 8 h to cells continuously treated with
TNF—01 (TNF/VEGF + TNF) caused fewer cells to enter S phase than
the 8h TNF—01 pulse. The pulse of TNF—01 facilitated the cells for
entry into S phase, but continuous TNF—01 treatment also acted to
repress entry into S phase in the absence of VEGF induction. These
results suggest that TNF—01 has a double role in regulation of the
cell cycle in VECs and that the cell cycle of VECs is controlled by
multiple cytokines in a balanced way (Mantovani and Sica, 2010).

In this study, time—course microarray datasets and functional
relationships of PPIs were used to construct responsive PPI
networks. PPI networks are a type of scale—free network (Han,
2008) in which node degree and node betweenness centrality can
be used to determine the network center (Barabasi et 611., 2011).
Liu et 611. (2007) compared a metabolic network with the KEGG
(Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) database and found
that enzyme phylogenetic proﬁle correlated best with betweenness
centrality and also quite closely with degree. Based on these studies,
time—course microarray datasets and the functional relationship of
PPIs were used to construct responsive PPI networks in the present
study. By employing node degree and node betweenness centrality,
we quantiﬁed the role of genes in the time—course PPI network which
made it easier to identify the key genes in the network. Combined
with laboratory experiments, we found that TNF—01 could affect the
G1/S cell cycle transition in VECs. These results show that time—
course PPI network analysis could also be a useful way to study
other time—course biological processes.

In summary, combined with computational and experimental
studies, we found that TNF—01 can promote G1/S transition of cell
cycle in VECs and facilitate the cell cycle activation induced by
VEGF. All these results suggest that TNF—01 can break the resting
cell cycle and wake up quiescent VECs.

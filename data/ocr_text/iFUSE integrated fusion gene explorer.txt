ABSTRACT

Summary: We present iFUSE (integrated fusion gene explorer), an
online visualization tool that provides a fast and informative view of
structural variation data and prioritizes those breaks likely representing
fusion genes. This application uses calculated break points to deter-
mine fusion genes based on the latest annotation for genomic se-
quence information, and where relevant the structural variation (SV)
events are annotated with predicted RNA and protein sequences.
iFUSE takes as input a Complete Genomics (CG) junction file, a
FusionMap fusion detection report file or a file already analysed and
annotated by the iFUSE application on a previous occasion.
Results: We demonstrate the use of iFUSE with case studies from
tumour-normal SV detection derived from Complete Genomics whole-
genome sequencing results.

Availability: iFUSE is available as a web service at http://ifuse.eras
musmc.nl.

1 INTRODUCTION

Structural variation analysis is a common requirement in the
study of cancer where many fusion genes have been implicated
in the progression of cancer (Kumar-Sinha et al., 2008; Mitelman
et al., 2007). The use of next-generation sequencing for fusion
gene detection in cancer (Edgren et al., 2011; Ge et al., 2011;
McPherson et al., 2011), structural variation in non-cancerous
diseases (Levy et al., 2011; Sanders et al., 2011) and in normal
genomes (The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2010) has eX-
panded knowledge of the importance of these events. In a recent
study, the use of de novo assembly in association with SV detec-
tion suggests that SVs account for more diversity between indi-
viduals than do single-nucleotide polymorphisms (Li et al.,
2011). Complete Genomics uses de novo assembly during SV,
single-nucleotide variation and copy number variation determin-
ation (Carnevali et al., 2012; Drmanac et al., 2010; Reumers
et al., 2011).

Traditionally, for a given SV, a user can visualize the individ-
ual (sides of the) breaks in viewers, such as IGV (Robinson et al.,
2011; Thorvaldsdottir et al., 2012), but not the resulting event or
fusion gene as a whole, and must manually retrieve the sequence

of the resulting event based on the exons from both genes of the
proposed fusion gene and determine the orientation and frame of
the predicted transcript and encoded polypeptide sequences.
Other applications also offer visualization, but with the caveat
that the user must process their data within the application, e.g.
inGAP-SV (Qi et al., 2011), or that a bioinformatician is required
to render the visualization using, e.g. Circos (Krzywinski et al.,
2009). Our aim is to deliver a web-based application that allows
scientists to visualize all detected SV events and fusion genes
determined in their results and to provide the concomitant can-
didate transcripts and polypeptide sequences associated with the
detected fusion genes (Fig. 1). No other application exists at the
moment to categorize and visualize the candidate fusion genes
and to determine the proposed sequence for gDNA, RNA and
polypeptides from standard SV ﬁles.

2 METHODS

iFUSE is a PHP-coded application running on an Apache web server
with a mySQL database for user management and R for data analysis.
Gene-based feature annotation is provided using the UCSC gene tables
(hgl8 and hgl9). Documentation details, including full application con-
ﬁguration, are available from the website (http://ifuse.erasmusmc.nl).

iFUSE takes as input either a Complete Genomics (CG) junctions ﬁle
or a fusion detection report as generated by the FusionMap tool (Ge
61 al., 2011). To perform a comparison of two or more genomes, the
Complete Genomics tool J unctions2Events can be used before visualiza-
tion within iFUSE. The input ﬁle is validated and then analysed using R,
after which a graphical representation for each event is generated. This
representation displays the promotor, introns, exons and the junction site,
and additional information, including DNA, RNA and protein se-
quences, is presented to the user. These events can be ﬁltered and
sorted by the user, either using general properties or by zooming in on
a single event and ﬁltering for nearby junctions or events with similar
properties.

The input ﬁles uploaded to iFUSE are annotated in R using informa-
tion retrieved from UCSC gene tables and the input ﬁles. The resulting
output ﬁle can be retrieved from iFUSE for manual inspection and can
also be used directly as input to iFUSE.

Example input ﬁles can be downloaded from the downloads section of
the iFUSE website, and users can test the application without registration
by selecting the option to start an anonymous session. Any ﬁles uploaded
by the user will be deleted at the end of the anonymous session.

iFUSE accounts are password protected, the application has been
tested for security risks, such as SQL injections, and our servers undergo
periodical CERT vulnerability scans (http://www.cert.org). Furthermore,

3 DISCUSSION

Two public cancer genomes have been used to demonstrate the
use of iFUSE for the prediction of fusion genes. Genomes were
downloaded from Complete Genomics (ftp2.completegenomics.
com). The results can be found in Table 1.

An event is labelled as a fusion gene if the break point has two
different genes on either side. If the two sides also have the same
orientation (are on the same strand, or in the case of an inversion

on opposite strands) and are also in frame, the event is called a
fusion protein.

4 CONCLUSION

iFUSE provides scientists with a convenient method to visualize,
categorize and ﬁlter structural variation analysis output using
Complete Genomics junction ﬁles or the FusionMap fusion
detection report ﬁles as input to the application.

Abstract

Summary: Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have successfully identified many se-
quence variants that are significantly associated with common diseases and traits. Tens of thou-
sands of such trait-associated SNPs have already been cataloged, which we believe form a great
resource for genomic research. Recent studies have demonstrated that the collection of trait-asso-
ciated SNPs can be exploited to indicate whether a given genomic interval or intervals are likely to
be functionally connected with certain phenotypes or diseases. Despite this importance, currently,
there is no ready-to-use computational tool able to connect genomic intervals to phenotypes. Here,
we present traseR, an easy-to-use R Bioconductor package that performs enrichment analyses of
trait-associated SNPs in arbitrary genomic intervals with flexible options, including testing method,
type of background and inclusion of SNPs in LB.

Availability and implementation: The traseR R package preloaded with up-to-date collection of
trait-associated SNPs are freely available in Bioconductor

1 Introduction

Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been conducted en
masse in the past decade and have been tremendously successful in
identifying sequence variants that are significantly associated with
common diseases and traits (Stranger et al., 2011). To this day, thou-
sands of GWAS have been conducted and reported, across diverse
spectrums of diseases as well as qualitative and quantitative pheno-
types. Resources, such as association result browser (http://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gapplusprev/sgap_plus.htm) and NHGRI
GWAS catalog (Welter et al., 2014), have been established to catalog
all the trait-associated variants. Currently, the association result
browser contains 44 124 association results (checked on October 10,
2015), which corresponds to 30 553 (autosomes plus chromosome X)
unique trait-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (taSNPs),

linking to 5 73 diseases or phenotypes. We believe such a catalog of
taSNPs offers scientists a unique perspective to explore and annotate
the functional potential of any given genomic intervals.

Maurano et al. showed that regulatory DNA marked by deoxy-
ribonuclease I (DNase I) hypersensitive sites (DHSs) was enriched
with noncoding GWAS SNPs (Maurano et al., 2012). Recent studies
from ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenome consortia systematically
examined enrichment of taSNPs in ChIP-seq peaks of transcription
factors and histone marks, and unveiled biologically interesting con-
nections (Roadmap Epigenomics et al., 2015; Schaub et al., 2012).

These results indicate the utilities of conducting taSNP enrichment
analyses in genomic intervals of interest. We believe that it will be a
powerful tool for researchers to be able to query any given set of gen-
omic intervals to see whether taSNPs are enriched in these particular

neighbourhoods of the genome and more importantly, which specific
traits show significant enrichment. Typical genomic intervals include
ChIP-seq peaks, differentially methylated regions and putative enhan-
cers. In this way, we can build hypotheses linking these intervals to
phenotypes. This is similar to the gene ontology (GO) (Ashburner
et al., 2000) term enrichment analysis or the gene set enrichment ana-
lysis (GSEA) (Subramanian et al., 2005) except that GO terms or
functional categories are replaced by traits, and a set of genes is
replaced by a set of genomic intervals. We believe taSNPs can bring
important functional insights to genomic regions, especially intergenic
regions. Despite the great utilities, currently there is no off-the-shelf
computational tool available to carry out this non-trivial test. To cater
for this demand, we developed an R Bioconductor package named
traseR, TRait—Associated SNP EnRichment analysis, which offers a
turnkey solution for enrichment analysis of taSNPs.

2 Methods

traseR provides multiple options, including testing method, type of
background and inclusion of SNPs in linkage disequilibrium (LD),
to conduct statistical tests of taSNP enrichment for a given set of
query genomic intervals. We here provide a brief description. More
details about these methods can be found in the Supplementary
Material.

2.1. Background SNPs

All SNPs from the CEU panel of the phase I 1000 Genomes with
minor allele frequency (MAF) greater than 0.05 are used as back-
ground SNPs (6 571 512 SNPs genome-wide excluding those from
the Y chromosome). These SNPs have a comparable MAF distribu-
tion to the taSNP collection.

2.2 Enrichment tests

2.2.1 Contingency table-based tests

The null hypothesis assumes that the proportion of taSNPs among
all SNPs is the same both within and outside of the query genomic
intervals. We classify all SNPs into either within/outside (query gen-
omic intervals), or taSNPs/non-taSNPs, then construct a two-by-two
contingency table and run a X2 test or Fisher’s exact test to assess
the enrichment level of the taSNPs. Alternatively, we classify every
single base in the genome (except for chromosome Y) into either
within/outside (query genomic intervals), or taSNPs/non-taSNPs,
and conduct the test accordingly.

2.2.2 Binomial test

The null hypothesis states that the chance of observing a SNP being a
taSNP is the same in query genomic intervals as in the whole genome
(excluding chromosome Y). Therefore, under the null hypothesis, the
number of observed taSNPs out of all SNPs in the query genomic
intervals follows a binomial distribution with probability equal to the
genome-wide proportion of all taSNPs among all SNPs. Alternatively,
we can use all bases in the genome as the background and conduct
the test accordingly.

2.2.3 Non-parametric statistical testing procedure

Because typical query genomic intervals only span a small fraction of
the whole genome, and the genome-wide distribution of SNPs is not
uniform, it is desirable to conduct a nonparametric test in which a set
of randomly selected control intervals is compared to the query gen-
omic intervals for taSNP enrichment, rather than imposing distribu-
tion assumptions. For each permutation, traseR generates a matching

control interval of the same size and on the same chromosome as each
query genomic interval. The process is repeated 10 000 times (or a
number specified by the user) to obtain an empirical P-value.

2.3. Linkage disequilibrium

As an option, traseR allows users to expand the taSNP set to include
all the SNPs that are in tight linkage disequilibrium (LD) (1'2 > 0.8)
with any of the taSNPs. The extended taSNP set contains 78 247
unique SNPs. Inclusion of SNPs in LD with the taSNPs is preferable
if there is a limited number of taSNPs associated with the traits of
interest.

3 Results

We collect a compendium of up-to-date taSNPs from dbGaP and
NHGRI. There are 30 553 unique taSNPs spanning 573 phenotypes,
all of which have been preloaded into the traseR package. traseR
takes in a bed format input file that contains the query genomic inter-
vals, then performs a user-specified enrichment test on all taSNPs
combined, as well as taSNPs associated with each of the 573 traits. In
the output, traseR reports the overall enrichment level of all taSNPs in
the query genomic intervals, followed by a ranked list of traits that
show statistically significant enrichment. Accordingly, P values, FDR
q-values and odds ratios are also reported for each trait.

We demonstrate traseR’s utilities by displaying a sample result
(H3K4me1 peak regions in peripheral T cell) (Roadmap Epigenomics
et al., 2015) (Table 1). The top-ranked traits are all immune-related.
Moreover, peaks are significantly enriched with overall taSNPs. Here,
we use the whole genome as background and binomial test as the test-
ing method. More results can be found in the Supplementary
Material.

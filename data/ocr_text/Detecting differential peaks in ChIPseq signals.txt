ABSTRACT

Motivation: Detection of changes in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)—
protein interactions from ChIP-seq data is a crucial step in unraveling
the regulatory networks behind biological processes. The simplest
variation of this problem is the differential peak calling (DPC) problem.
Here, one has to find genomic regions with ChIP-seq signal changes
between two cellular conditions in the interaction of a protein with
DNA. The great majority of peak calling methods can only analyze
one ChIP-seq signal at a time and are unable to perform DPC.
Recently, a few approaches based on the combination of these
peak callers with statistical tests for detecting differential digital
expression have been proposed. However, these methods fail to
detect detailed changes of protein—DNA interactions.

Results: We propose an One-stage DIffereNtiaI peak caller (ODIN); an
Hidden Markov Model-based approach to detect and analyze differ-
ential peaks (DPs) in pairs of ChIP-seq data. ODIN performs genomic
signal processing, peak calling and p-value calculation in an integrated
framework. We also propose an evaluation methodology to compare
ODIN with competing methods. The evaluation method is based on
the association of DPs with expression changes in the same
cellular conditions. Our empirical study based on several ChIP-seq
experiments from transcription factors, histone modifications and
simulated data shows that ODIN outperforms considered competing
methods in most scenarios.

1 INTRODUCTION

Transcriptional regulation is dictated by a set of deoxyribonu-
cleic acid (DNA) interacting proteins such as histones, which
define the chromatin structure, and transcription factors (TFs).
These proteins are responsible for recruitment of ribonucleic acid
(RNA) polymerase and start of transcription (Maston et al.,
2006). Detection of the changes in DNA—protein interactions

under distinct cellular conditions is a crucial step in unraveling
the regulatory networks behind biological processes such as
cell differentiation, the activation of signaling pathways and
the onset of diseases (Kaikkonen et al., 2013; Martens and
Stunnenberg, 2013). Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed
by DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) allows to study the interactions
of proteins with DNA regions in a genome wide manner (Dahl
and Collas, 2008).

Computational methods identify DNA—protein interaction
sites from ChIP-seq (also called peak detection) by detecting re-
gions with a higher number of reads than expected by chance
using sophisticated statistical models (Ashoor et al., 2013; Kuan
et al., 2011; Rozowsky et al., 2009; Song and Smith, 2011;
Spyrou et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2008;). With a few exceptions,
widely used peak calling methods are based on the analysis of
individual ChIP-seq signals. Here, we are interested in comparing
ChIP-seq data from distinct experiments; we want to detect
changes, which we call differential peaks (DPs), in protein—
DNA interaction of a single protein in a pair of cellular
conditions. We will refer to this signal detection challenge as
differential peak calling (DPC). See Figure l for examples of
putative DPs after the induction of TLR4 signaling (Kaikkonen
et al., 2013).

Initially, DPC was performed by peak calling on individual
ChIP-seq signals. Peaks detected in only one of the conditions
were then defined as cell-speciﬁc peaks (Heinz et al., 2010). Such
methods are not able to detect cases where peaks were presented
(and called) in both cell types, but exhibit a signiﬁcant increase
(decrease) of the DNA—protein signal in one of the cells. In the
example of Figure 1, based on peaks from PeakSeq (Rozowsky
et al., 2009), only DPl would be detected as cell-speciﬁc.
Moreover, most of single signal peak callers (SPCs) provide
no functionality to normalize several ChIP-seq experiments
and are likely to show bias in experiments with higher number
of reads.

A more sophisticated strategy to detect DPs is the combin-
ation of peaks from SPCs with statistical tools. These two-
stage differential peak callers (DPC) first combine peaks that
are called on individual ChIP-seq conditions using SPCs. Next,
they count the number of reads for each candidate peak, perform
signal normalization and apply statistical tests assuming a differ-
ential count model like EdgeR (Robinson et al., 2010) or
DESeq (Anders and Huber, 2010). Therefore, they can detect

Fig. 1. We show an example of two distinct ChIP-seq signals for the
histone modiﬁcation H3K4me2 before (0 h, upper signal) and 24 hours
after (24 h, lower signal) induction of TLR4 signaling of macrophages
around the gene Irfl. We indicate with squares examples of regions,
which are putative DPs with gain (or loss) of ChIP-seq signal after 24
hours of TLR4 treatment. The height of the squares indicates the size of
the highest ChIP-seq signal for a DP. We also display results from the
SPC PeakSeq and a two-stage peak caller based on applying DESeq on
PeakSeq peaks (bars below the ChIP-seq signals). PeakSeq successfully
detects broad peaks describing ChIP-seq signal for each cell. The two-
stage peak caller can detect DPl and DP3, but cannot detect changes
within the broad candidate peaks such as DP2 or complex changes in the
signal around Irf 1 gene body (DP4 and DPS)

candidate peaks where the number of read counts is signiﬁcantly
higher/lower in one of the ChIP-seq conditions. While this
approach allows the detection of signiﬁcant changes in ChIP-
seq within candidate peaks, it is highly dependent on the initial
peak calling step as well as the strategy used to create the set of
candidate peaks. For example, histone modiﬁcations associated
to active regulatory regions occur in domains spanning several
hundreds of base pairs and may have intricate patterns of gain/
loss of ChIP-seq signals within the same domain. SPCs tend to
call the domains as single peaks and consequently the differential
analysis is only able to evaluate the differential counts of the
complete called peaks (Fig. l). A more appropriate framework
to analyze DPs is the use of segmentation methods like Hidden
Markov Models (HMMs), which are able to analyze pairs of
ChIP-seq signals and perform DPC in a single step (Xu et al.,
2008).

1.1 Previous approaches

Previous approaches of DPC can be categorized in two classes:
one-stage and two-stage DPC. DBChIP (Liang and Keles, 2012)
is an example of a two-stage DPC, as it receives as input the
summit information of peaks from SPCs like PeakSeq followed
by the application of edgeR (Robinson et al., 2010). DBChIP
has as objective only the analysis of TF peaks, and therefore,
uses predeﬁned short regions around the peak summits as
candidates for DPs. We have previously applied a similar ap-
proach using the peak caller MACS (Zhang et al., 2008) and
EdgeR accordingly (Lin et al., in preparation). Here, peaks for
all ChIP-seq conditions analyzed were combined by merging
overlapping regions, which allows the analysis of peaks of any
size. Another approach, MAnorm (Shao et al., 2012), also
receives as input the regions from SPCs and normalizes the

peak counts between two samples with a local robust regression
approach followed by a P value calculation to deﬁne
signiﬁcant DPs.

One-stage DPCs are based on signal segmentation approaches
such as an HMM. To our knowledge, the only published method
proposed speciﬁcally for the DPC problem is ChIPDiff
(Xu et al., 2008), which is based on a three state HMM, to
detect DPs between two samples. The HMM emission is based
on an approximation of a Beta-Binomial distribution, which is
ﬁxed after model initialization. The Baum—Welch algorithm is
used to estimate transition parameters. Furthermore, the peak
caller MACS has been recently extended to MACS2. MACS2 is
able to perform DPC of ChIP-seq signal pairs. It works by ﬁrst
performing peak calling in individual signals followed by a
fold change analysis within these regions (unpublished,
available at https://github.com/taoliu/MACS/). RSEG (Song
and Smith, 2011) is specialized in the analysis of single
ChIP-seq signals of repressive histones, which are distributed in
very large and poorly sequenced genomic domains. It has an
option for DPC with a three state model similar to
ChIPDiff. RSEG uses Difference Negative Binomial distribu-
tion. There are also SPCs based on HMMs, such as
HMCan (Ashoor et al., 2013) and BayesPeaks (Spyrou et al.,
2009), which are not able to perform DPC.

1.2 Our approach

Here, we propose an One-stage DIffereNtial peak caller (ODIN),
an HMM-based approach to detect and analyze DPs in pairs of
ChIP-seq data. The HMM, which is based on a three state
topology, uses the product of Binomial or mixture of Poisson
distributions to model the observed values. Moreover, we con-
strain several HMM parameters to decrease the number of free
parameters and to improve robustness and avoid label switching.
Previous to the HMM application, we propose a pipeline with
several steps for generation of the ChIP-seq proﬁles. The pipeline
consists of automatic estimation of fragment size, DNA mapp-
ability, GC-content normalization, correction of signals with
input-DNA and signal normalization. Moreover, we use the
density estimates from the HMM for an efﬁcient approach to
estimate P values for the DPs. ODIN is the first DPC performing
signal normalization, DP detection and statistical testing in
an integrated way. We propose here a methodology and statistic
to evaluate DPs, which is based on associating DPs with changes
in expression on the same cellular conditions as the ChIP-seq
data. This allows us to perform a comparative analysis with
all competing methods (DBChIP, MAnorm, DESeq, MACS2
and ChIPDiff) for ChIP-seq data from TFs and histone
modiﬁcations. The analysis also covers a simulated data
approach tailored for the DPC problem. We use the simulated
data to explore the method performance under distinct
conditions, such as the complexity of DPs and the number of
reads.

2 METHOD

2.1 Proﬁle construction

The ﬁrst step in ChIP-seq analysis is the construction of a genomic
proﬁle. The basic idea is to fragment the genome into bins and count

Detecting DPs in ChIP-seq signals with ODIN

 

the reads falling in these bins. Let X be the matrix that represents the
genomic signal

X : {xij}DXL,

where xij indicates the number of reads in bin j of signal 1', and where D is
the number of genomic signals and L the number of bins. Here, we will
have D = 2, as we are interested in DPs between two ChIP-seq signals.

The ith genomic signal is represented by the row vector x,. = {x,1, . . . , 3%}
and the genomic signals for bin j is represented by the vector
x]: {x1}, ...,xDJ-}. Moreover, ChIP-seq experiments usually have reads

from input-DNA for each cell type analyzed. The input-DNA contains all
fragmented DNA not immunoprecipitaded in the ChIP experiment
and can be used as a control signal. In particular, input-DNA can
indicate sequencing bias associated to GC-content and DNA
sheering process (Park, 2009). We will refer to input-DNA as

' ' t ' t
x‘nput={x11npu,...,xfpu}.

2.1.1 Read mappability ﬁltering We ignore reads mapping to gen-
omic regions which are either unassembled (denoted by Ns) or that exhibit
a poor mappability. Poor mappability regions stem from the fact that
short reads cannot be uniquely mapped to repetitive regions that exhibit a
higher length than the reads themselves (Song and Smith, 2011). Reads
aligned completely to a poor mappability region are ignored with the use
of this ﬁlter.

2.1.2 Fragment Size According to the ChIP-seq protocol, only the
beginning of the sample’s DNA fragments is sequenced (Park, 2009). To
reconstruct the missing part of the DNA fragments, one has to compute
the read fragment size f. Given the set F of the left most positions of all
reads aligned to the forward strand and, respectively, R, the right most
positions of all reads aligned to the reverse strand. We deﬁne the strand
cross-correlation function C(f) = 2 11(1)) - 110’ + p) following (Mammana
peFUR
et al., 2013) with

0, p¢FUR,
11(17): 2, panR,

1, else.

The convolution c gives the correlation between counts on the forward
and reverse strands for a given fragment size f. We are interested to ﬁnd
the fragment size f = arg max fepco‘), that is the value with the maximum
correlation between both strands.

2.1.3 Signal prOfile We extend all forward (reverse) reads from the
leftmost (rightmost) position to the 3, (5’) direction by the estimated read
fragment size  We use a sliding window approach to partition the
genome into a set {171, ...,bL}.

Each bin 17,- covers the genomic positions [1' - S — 0.5 - w,j - S+0.5 - w],
where S and w are the step size and the window size. The value of the gen-
omic proﬁle xi]- is simply the number of extended reads of ChIP-seq signal
1' aligned to regions overlapping bin 17]. If a read lies entirely in a ﬁltered
region (Section 2.1.1), it will be ignored.

2.1.4 GC-COntent Sequencing technologies usually exhibit an
unwished correlation between the number of reads and the GC-content
of the regions the reads come from (Benjamini and Speed, 2012).
To model and correct this effect, we use an histogram-based approach
introduced by Ashoor et al. (2013). Let gj indicate the GC-content of
the genomic bin 17], that is the proportion of Gs and Cs in the bin’s
underlying sequence. We want to measure the average number of
reads from input signal xmput assigned to bins on a particular
GC-content interval. For an interval [v,v+6] and genomic signal

 

xinput, we have
2.: x}“P”‘1(g,- e [1», v + 3])
h(v)= F L
21.21 1(g, e [1», v+6])
where 1 is an indicator function and v e {0.0, . . ., l — 6}.

Moreover, we deﬁne the sum of average number of reads per GC-
content T = 6 - 211(1)). We correct the genomic signal xij with g e [v, v
+ 6] as v=0
GC 2 T

Xl-j 

Loosely speaking, we increase (decrease) the genomic signal of a bin, if
the average GC-dependent signal is lower (higher) than expected.

2.1.5 Input subtractiOn To avoid bias associated to the DNA shear-
ing process, it is usual to subtract the input-DNA from the ChIP-seq
genomic signals. We follow the sequencing extraction scaling (SES)
approach of Diaz et al. (2012), which performs a signal normalization
previous to the subtraction. The rationale is that while input-DNA- and
ChIP-seq libraries usually have similar number of reads, the mass of
ChIP-seq reads are concentrated in protein—DNA interaction sites.
Therefore, a simple subtraction tends to over-penalize the ChIP-seq
signal. For a scaling factor 018138 (see Diaz et al. (2012) for details) and
input-DNA xinput, we perform for both signals

in ut
XEESZXI'. —a-xi p.

2.1.6 Normalization and bin filtering We perform a sequencing
depth scaling approach to normalize the two ChIP-seq signals to be

compared. Let S1=ZJL=1

for x1. and X}. We scale up the genomic signal with less overall signal
by the factor y=max (S1 /S2, Sz/Sl). For example, if S1 <S2, we have

L .
x1}, Sz=Zj=1xzj be the s1gnal’s total sum

XIII?“ = y - x1.
with y=S2 /S1. We round all values to obtain count data again. For
simplicity we refer to this signal as read counts in the following text.
We ﬁlter all bins 17,- with low number of reads (x1j+x2j>3) and
% +  < ﬁ, where M represents the proportion of mappable regions.
This ﬁltering steps discards 80% of bins with low count evidence.

2.2 DPC HMM

Our HMM receives as input a matrix X with two genomic signals repre-
senting the ChIP-seq values of two biological conditions to be compared.
The signals are obtained after the application of all pre—processing steps
described in Section 2.1. We deﬁne a ﬁrst-order HMM containing a state
for DPs gained in signal x1. (Gain 1), a state for DPs gained in signal X2.
(Gain 2) and a background state (Back), as depicted in Figure 2. All
states have transitions to other states and to themselves. We use the
product of Binomial or mixture of Poisson distributions as emissions
for our HMM. More formally, for a given state S, we have
Pr 5(xj)= Pr 51(x1j) - Pr 52(x2j). In case of the Binomial distribution as
emission, we have
n
Pr si(xij) : B(xij : k I nv psi) : (S)pfi(1 _ psi)n—ka

where n represents the number of events observed (number of reads in the
libraries) and psi is the probability of observing a read in state S and
signal 1'.

Fig. 2. Here we depict the three state HMM used for DP calling and
samples of their emission distributions. We constraint the emission dis-
tribution of state Back as well as the emission distributions linked by
dotted lines

In contrary to the Negative Binomial, the Binomial distribution is not
able to model over-dispersion (Leleu et al., 2010). However, there is no
closed form to obtain maximum likelihood estimates of these densities
and it would require numerically intricate extensions of the Baum—Welch
algorithm. Alternatively, we evaluate the use of a mixture of Poisson
distribution, which has a close form and can cope with over-dispersion.
In this case, we have

M
PT 51'! (Xij) Z lel Cs! - bsil (Xijl

where M is the number of mixture components, cs, are the mixing coef-
ﬁcients and

exp (—f(l) - 9m) - (f(l) - Camry .



 

bsil (Xij) Z

We use function f(l) =1 to ensure that the mean of each mixture
component are multiple of each other (see Supplementary Section 2 for
more details). This constraint was introduced to mitigate the fact that
during mixture estimation some components can end up with little
data support (or low mixing coefﬁcients). This is usual when
outliers (peaks with unusually high number of reads) are present in the
data.

2.2.1 Initial HM M parameter We use a simple fold criteria to deﬁne
a set of DPs to be used for the HMM initialization. More formally, a
bin 17,- will be assigned to state Gain 1 if xlj/xzj>t, to state Gain 2 if
xzj/x1j> t and to Back state otherwise. We use this annotation to deﬁne
a posterior probability and to perform a single M-Step of the Baum—
Welch algorithm to obtain initial parameters. Given the large size of the
genomic signals, we only use a random selection of regions to train the
HMM. We select genomic regions formed by contiguous bins not ﬁltered
in Section 2.1.1, which have at least a bin annotated with either Gain 1
or Gain 2 state. The selection is done until the training set has at least
3 x 106 bins.

2.2.2 HM M training The HMM is estimated with the Baum—Welch
algorithm (Rabiner, 1989). Estimates of the initial state and transition
probabilities follow usual methods. Concerning the emission distribu-
tions, the parameter n is equal in emissions and represents the number
of reads of the largest library n=max(S1, S2) (the normalization steps
ensure S1 R 52).

To reduce the number of parameter estimates, we constrain the
parameters from Back state (S: 3) to be equal 1731:1932. We also
constrain emissions for state Gain 1 (s = l) and state Gain 2 (s = 2)
by p11 =p22 and p12 =p21. This makes the distributions of enriched signals
(non-enriched signals) from states Gain 1 and Gain 2 to be
equal (Fig. 2). For the Binomial distribution, given rsj to be the
posterior probability that the HMM is at state S after observing x], it

can be shown that the maximum likelihood estimates of those parameters
are:

For the mixture of Poisson distribution, we can compute 5,1 for the ﬁrst
component as

8 _ 21:12:1XU'1/510)
Sil — ,
Zf=l   ' l/SZU)

 

and for component I
@511 :l ' @511

where ysl(j) is the posterior probability of being in component I at state S
at time j. All other parameters follow standard mixture model estimates.
We constrain the HMM’s mixture distributions accordingly to the case
of the Binomial distribution (see Supplementary Section S2 for more
details of the mixture of Poisson). Training is performed until conver-
gence. Finally, we apply the Viterbi algorithm to the complete genomic
signals. We merge all consecutive bins visited by either states Gain 1 or
Gain 2 on the Viterbi path to obtain the candidate DPs.

2.3 Post-processing

Next, we perform two post-processing steps to remove spurious DPs.
First, we ignore all DPs with a size smaller than the estimated fragment
size f. We also merge conAcordant DPs, which have a distance less than the
estimated fragment size f. The second step is only suggested for histone
modiﬁcation data, which are usually localized in broader genomic
regions.

We perform a statistical test to assign a P value to each DP. Let y1 =
ijuxu and y2=ijuxzj be the read counts for a DP spanning
from bins u to v. For DP Gain 1, the P value is the sum of probabilities
of the tuple (a,b) such that a>y1, a+b =y1 + yz. More formally,

Pr (a>y1|y2)= Z Pr (a, b),

a>y1; a+b=y1+y2
where a, b e N. We compute the probability Pr (a, b) as

13(6l | 71,1731) ' BU? | 71,1732)
Z,,,=,,,B<c I 11,1731) - B(dl 11.1232)

 

Pr(a, b) =

where c, d e N with c+ d= a+b and n,p31,p32 are the parameters of the
emission distributions of the Back state. The P value for DP Gain 2 can
be deﬁned accordingly.

For large yl, yz values, the computation of the above equations are
computationally expensive. Following Anders and Huber (2010), we can
combine both equation and obtain

2 W I 11,1731) - B<b I 11.1232)

a>y1; a+b=y1+y2

Ema, +,2B(c I 11,1731) - B(dl 11.1232)

 

Pr(a>)/1|y2)=

The sum of the nominator is a subset of the sum of the denominator.
Consequently, we only need to evaluate the sum of the denominator and

take into account the appropriate values for the nominator. Moreover,
we can rewrite the main term in the nominator (denominator) as a func-
tion f(a): B(a I 71,1731) ' 130/1 +y2 — 61,1732) giVen that b=y1+y2 — Cl-
This function is axially symmetrical and has a global maximum at amax =
(yl + y2)/2 given that p31 =p32. That is, we only have to evaluate half of
the sum’s values of the numerator (denominator). Furthermore, as the
function decrease monotonically departing from amax, we can approximate
the P value calculation by making f(e) =f(a) for all e>a given
that f(a) —f(a+1)<e. These steps allow a speed up of 100 times on the
P value calculations on our experiments. Note that these improvements
would not be possible in the mixture of Poisson distribution, therefore, we
estimate a Binomial distribution using the posterior probability of the
background model in this case.

3 EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
3.1 Real datasets

We used data from two studies, both using cells of the mouse
immune system, to evaluate the performance of our method. The
ﬁrst study analyses the response of macrophages after activation
of the TLR4 signaling pathway (Kaikkonen et al., 2013). We use
ChIP-seq experiments from the TF PU.l at time points 0, l, 6, l2
and 24h and from the histone modiﬁcation H3K4me2 at time
points 0, 1, 6 and 24h (time point 12h was not available). We
perform DPC by comparing the time point 0 h with all other time
points which leads to seven experiments (Table l). The study
provides an input-DNA signal of untreated cells (0 h), which is
used as control. Moreover, we also use the genomic run-on
sequencing (GRO—seq) experiments, which measures the quantity
of nascent transcripts, in time points 0, 1, 6, 12 and 24h for
validation. These data were obtained from GEO accession
number GSE48759.

The second study comprises in-house data describing regula-
tory changes during the development of antigen-presenting
dendritiC cells (DCs). Our institute has established an in vitro
protocol to differentiate multi-potent progenitors (MPP) from
adult mouse bone marrow to common DC progenitors (CDP;
Felker et al., 2010). The CDP further differentiate into two
distinct DC subsets, classical DC (CDC) and plasmacytoid DC
(pDC). These four cell types were sorted by FACS and ChIP-seq
experiments for H3K4me1 and PU.l were performed (Lin et al.,
in preparation, data available at GSE57563). We have performed
a DP analysis comparing the lineage commitment steps (MPP to
CDP, CDP to CDC, CDP to pDC) and DC subset speciﬁcation
(CDC and pDC). This leads to eight further experiments as listed
in Table 1. We have gene expression data from microarrays for
these four cell types from Felker et al. (2010) (GEO accession
GSE22432).

We use BWA (Li and Durbin, 2010) version 0.6.1 — r104 with
standard parameter for read mapping. All experiments were
based on mouse genome (mm9).

3.2 Evaluation

There is no gold standard to evaluate DPs. A strategy commonly
used to evaluate SPCs applied to ChIP-seq from TFs—
measuring the proportion of candidate peaks with motifs of
the TF (Chen et al., 2012)—is not applicable to the DP problem.
Sequence evidences (motifs) are independent of the cellular con-
text and they will be found in the genomiC sequence if binding is

present in at least one of the cellular conditions. An alternative
is to associate Changes in protein—DNA with Changes in gene
expression, whenever gene expression is measured in the
same cellular conditions, as usually performed in genomiC
studies with ChIP-seq data (Heinz et al., 2010; Kaikkonen
et al., 2013).

Here, we propose a method that quantiﬁes Changes in expres-
sion in the proximity of DPs. The measure is independent of the
number of called peaks and can be applied either to gene expres-
sion data from sequencing or microarray data. For sequencing
data, we ﬁrst extend the DPs to have at least a length of 1000 bps
and then count the number of RNA/GRO-seq reads aligned to
these regions for both cell samples. The use of small windows of
RNA/GRO-seq is based on the fact that we want to capture the
expression of known genes or uncharacterized lnCRNAs in the
Close proximity of the DP. See Supplementary Figure 7 for an
example of GRO-seq proﬁles.

More formally, we sort by increasing P value and take the top
k ranked DPs for Gain 1 (or Gain 2). Next, we evaluate the
logarithmic ratio log (S1 /S2) for the top k DPs, where S1 and S2
are the RNA/GRO—seq read counts associated to peaks in the
ﬁrst and second condition. By increasing k, we obtain curves
depicted in Figure 4. The higher the value, the higher is the as-
sociation between DP and Changes in expression.

Regarding gene expression from microarrays, we need an add-
itional step to associate peaks to genes. Peaks are assigned to
genes if they are located inside the gene body or Close to the
gene’s promoter (1000 bp upstream); or if the peaks are located
50 Kbps away from the TSS and there is no other gene’s TSS in
between. The average expression value of genes assigned to a
peak is used. Peaks not assigned to genes are ignored for the
statistics.

We compute the integral of the curves obtaining the single
statistiC differential average gene expression (DAGE). Let e(k)
be the average log ratio expression associated to the best k DPs

k—h

for k6 [h,2-h,...,H] where h is the step size and H the
maximum number of DPs used. For visualization purposes,
we display the negative values of the DAGE curve for DP
Gain 2.

3.3 Simulated datasets

The simulation of single ChIP-seq datasets has already been ad-
dressed by Zhang et al. (2008) and Humburg (2011), but none of
these approaches can be directly used in the DPC problem. We,
therefore, developed an algorithm inspired by Humburg (2011)
to generate ChIP-seq reads simulating a pair of biological con-
ditions with DPs. In short, for a given reference genome the
procedure works as follows: (1) selecting genomiC regions to in-
Clude protein domains (region with several binding proteins) and
sampling the number of proteins in a domain following a
negative Binomial distribution NBml, pl; (2) sampling and place-
ment of reads per protein following a Negative Binomial distri-
bution NBmMD2 and (3) assignment of a proportion of reads from
a protein to eaCh of the simulated biological condition. We use
the mean and standard deviation to describe the Negative
Binomial distribution. We take into account the original position
of the proteins and the proportion of reads to deﬁne the true DP
(see Supplementary Section S1 for details).

We are particularly interested in the effect of protein
domain sizes as well as the number of reads in the libraries.
We set the parameters (mhpl) to {(l, 4), (4, 6), (8, 14)} obtaining
datasets with an increasing number of proteins per domain.
Furthermore, we set the parameters (m2,p2) to {(20, 200 ), (20,
2000), (100, 200)} obtaining both datasets with distinct number
of reads per peak as well as high variance of reads per peak. We
use Chromosome 1 of the mouse genome (mm9) as reference
genome. For eaCh parameterization Choice, we generate 50
pairs of simulated datasets. Methods were evaluated by sorting
the DPs by smallest P value and calculating the proportion of
true positives among the top r called DPs. A candidate DP is
considered a true positive if it overlaps with a true DP (see
Supplementary Section S1 for more details).

3.4 HMM parameterization

For all datasets, we compute the fragment size from the range
f= arg maxfepco‘), for F=[0, 5, . . . , 600]. Moreover, we use a
step size of 50 and window size of 100 to compute the signal
proﬁle. This Choice was based on visual inspection of peaks:
smaller windows did not affect peaks and larger windows
induced too large peaks. We only use input-DNA signal of
Chromosome 1 to build the GC-Content histogram. We use the
mappability ﬁles that are provided by Landt et al. (2012) (http://
hgdownload-test.Cse.uCSC.edu/goldenPath/mm9/enCodeDCC/

ngncodeMapability/, last access: 20th MarCh 2014). We only
consider regions with an mappability value of 1. We
implemented our HMM in Python 2.7 by using the SCiKit
package (Pedregosa et al., 2011). ODIN is part of the
Regulatory Genomics Toolbox (see www.regulatory-genomics.

org). Predictions for experiments and simulated data are avail-
able at the Web Supplement http://Costalab.org/wp/odin. In our
experiments, ODIN (with a single component in the mixture
model) requires on average 12GB of memory. The calculations
last on average 4h on a 2.4 GHz maChine. Computational time
increases linearly with the number of components in the case of
mixture models.

3.5 Competing methods

We use PeakSeq, Quest and MACS as SPCs in combination with
DBChIP, DESeq and MAnorm. The SPCs were selected based
on their good performance (Chen et al., 2012; Wilbanks and
FaCCiotti, 2010). We run all SPCs with standard parameter and
corresponding input-DNA. The simulated data does not provide
input-DNA. As QUEST and PeakSeq can only be executed with
input signal, they are not evaluated in the simulation experi-
ments. We refer to the obtained peaks as candidate peaks for
the two-stage DPC. DBChIP is proposed for TF data only.
Therefore, it uses a ﬁxed window size of 250 bps around the
summits of candidate peaks. We also deﬁne an own two-stage
DPC. This approach merges all candidate peaks and uses them
as input for DESeq. Note that distinctly from DBChIP, this
approach can ﬁnd DPs with variable size common in histone
ChIP-seq. We separately run DBChIP, DESeq, MAnorm with
default parameters and the candidate peaks of PeakSeq, Quest
and MACS.

ChIPDiff is also run with default parameters (FC = 3,
minRegionDist=1000 and minP=0.95). It ﬁnds less than
20 peaks for half of the experiments from the TLR4 study.
For these experiments, we Change parameters (FC = 1.5,
minRegionDist=200 and minP=0.7) to obtain at least
100 DPs. Moreover, as ChIPDiff does not provide P values
or any criteria for sorting peaks, we can only obtain
points for the DAGE statistiC. We also try to use RSEG
with no success. For the dataset PUl-MPP-CDP, it returns
very large peaks (mean size of 58 716 bps) in comparison to
ODIN (315 bps). Per deﬁnition, RSEG is tailored for
identifying broad genomiC domains and will not be
considered here. MACS2 is run with parameter C = 0.5 for
the data from Kaikkonen et al. (2013) and C = 1.5 for the DC
data.

We run DBChIP, MAnorm, ChIPDiff, MACS2, our DESeq
approach and ODIN for all 15 experiments. DBChIP is only run
for TFs data and our DESeq approach for histone data.
Therefore, we distinguish between experiments with TF or his-
tone modiﬁcations. We will call DPs to be Gain 1 (Gain 2) for
all competing methods, whenever they are detected to have
higher signal in x1. (362.).

We then apply the Friedman-Nemenyi test (Deméar, 2006) on
the DAGE values. This non-parametric test CheCks signiﬁcant
differences when more than two methods are applied to multiple
datasets. It works in two steps: ﬁrst, it ranks the methods under
comparison and second, if a signiﬁcant differences exist, it
identiﬁes the pairs of methods causing them. Here, the
Friedman—Nemenyi test indicates whether one of the
methods is assigned to signiﬁcant higher DAGE values than
others.

Detecting DPs in ChlP-seq signals with ODIN

 

4 RESULTS

4.1 Genomic signal construction

We investigate the effect of the preprocessing steps to create the
genomiC signal (Section 2.1). In particular, we analyze all eight
combinations of using: (1) the GC-Content model, (2) ﬁltering
reads aligned to poor mappability regions and (3) the subtraction
of input-DNA. DP predictions are based on Chromosome 1 for
all 15 experiments on real data. The Friedman—Nemenyi test on
DAGE statistics for h = 50, H = 500 indicates a slight advantage
of using input-DNA subtraction and GC-Content model
compared to using none of the steps for TF data
(P value<0.l). No signiﬁcant difference is detected on histone
data. However, the Friedman score ranks are similar in both
scenarios reinforcing the advantage of the input-DNA
subtraction and GC-Content model, whiCh will be further used
in all experiments (see Supplementary Tables S3—S6).

4.2 Method parameterization

We empirically evaluate the use of parameter constraining and
the Choice of the HMM’s emission distribution as presented in
Section 2.2.2. Again, we restrict the analysis to the Chromosome 1
of all 15 real data experiments and compute the DAGE statistiC
(h: 50, H =500) with or without parameter constraining. The
constraint model has statistical signiﬁcant higher DAGE values
(P value<0.006, one-tailed Wilcoxon test) for experiments with
TF, while no signiﬁcant differences are obtained on histone
modiﬁcation experiments. This reinforces the advantage of par-
ameter constraining, whiCh is used in further experiments.

Furthermore, we evaluate the use of distinct distributions:
Binomial and mixture of Poisson with 141 components. As
shown in Supplementary Tables S7—S10, no signiﬁcant difference
was found. We, therefore, use the Poisson mixture with the
number of components that offers the highest ranking (4 for
histones and l TFs) as well as the Binomial distribution in the
following experiments.

Moreover, we evaluate the P value estimation methods of
ODIN, DESeq and EdgeR. We use DPs predicted by ODIN
with Binomial distribution. ODIN’s P value estimation has a
signiﬁcant higher DAGE score than DESeq and EdgeR for TF
experiments and a signiﬁcant higher DAGE score than EdgeR
for histone experiments (see Supplementary Tables S15—S18).

Finally, we inspect the impact of SPCs (MACS, QUEST and
PeakSeq) on two stage peak callers DPChIP, DESeq and
MAnorm. As shown in Supplementary Tables Sll—Sl4, signiﬁ-
cant difference between the use SPCs was found. We use the best
ranked combination: MAnorm-macs, DESeq-quest and
DBChIP-quest.

We discard Chromosome 1 regions from all further analysis of
real datasets, as they have been used for parameterization
experiments.

4.3 Comparative analysis on simulated data

Supplementary Figure S1 shows the results for simulated data.
As expected, methods obtained best performance on experiments
with more reads and less number of proteins per domain (bottom
left). The performance of MAnorm (green line) for top ranked
DPs is quite competitive with ODIN variants (read and yellow

lines) on data with few proteins per domains (left column), but its
performance deteriorates whenever more proteins are present in
the domains. MACS2 (blue line) has similar performance as
ODIN variants (read and yellow lines) when large number of
reads are present (bottom), but ODIN Clearly outperforms
MAC2 when peak sizes have a high variance (middle row). We
calculate the area under the curve for eaCh experiment to
perform a Friedman—Nemenyi test. We then evaluate the overall
performance of methods for all conditions (Supplementary
Tables S1 and S2). Results indicates that ODIN with Binomial
or single Poisson distribution has a signiﬁcantly higher AUC
than MACS2, MAnorm, DESeq and DBChIP.

4.4 Comparative evaluation on real data

We perform a visual inspection of the DPs from experiment
H3K4me2-0h—24h around the Irfl gene (Fig. 3). MAnorm and
our DESeq approach, whiCh have same predictions for this
region, can successfully detect Changes in large peak areas.
ChIPDiff detects most DPs, but have a tendency to call large
regions. ODIN and MACS2 are able to detect detailed Changes
within the large domains. Note that MACS2 and ChIPDiff are
not able to recover a DP upstream of Irf 1 (marked as DP2) on
H3K4me2 0h. The lost of this histone mark after TLR4 treat-
ment is supported by gain of a PU.l on the very sample location
(see Supplementary Fig. S7 for PU.l ChIP-seq proﬁles).

In Figure 4, we display DAGE curves for DBChIP, MACS2,
our DESeq approach, MAnorm and ODIN for four selected
experiments on real data. As ChIPDiff does not provide infor-
mation to sort the DPs, its results are only represented as points,
where the x-axis location corresponds to the number of called
DPs. In most scenarios, curves approximate to zero for higher
ranks, whiCh indicates that higher ranked DPs are associated to
higher expression Changes. In some scenarios, suCh as H3K4me2-
0h-6h, the curve associated to Gain 2 peaks (right bottom) are
further from 0 than Gain 1 peaks (right middle). This is an
indication that there are more Changes in ChIP-seq peaks and
gene expression in signal 2 (6 h) than in signal 1 (0 h). This is in
accordance with the main message of the TLR4 study, whiCh
shows that induction of TLR4 promotes new enhancers

#best ranked peaks

Fig. 4. Here we depict the DAGE curves for selected experiments from TLR4 and DC studies. Lines in the ﬁrst and third row represent DP gained in the
ﬁrst signal (Gain 1), while lines in the second and fourth row in the second signal (Gain 2)

marked by H3K4me2 (Kaikkonen et al., 2013). While there are
some experiment-speciﬁc variations, both ODIN variants out-
performs other methods on PU.1-MPP-CDP, H3K4me1-
MPP-CDP, while the performance of ODIN with Binomial
distribution is similar to other methods on H3K4me1-0h—6h
and PU.1-0h-6h. All DAGE curves can be found at
Supplementary Figures S3—S6.

Finally, we evaluate the performance of all methods over the
15 real data experiments listed in Table l by computing the
DAGE scores for Gain 1 and Gain 2 peaks. The Friedman—
Nemenyi test indicates that both ODIN variants have signiﬁ-
cantly higher DAGE scores than DBChIP and MACS2 on TF
experiments (P value<0.l, see Supplementary Tables S19 and
S20) and signiﬁcantly higher DAGE scores than DESeq on his-
tone data (P value<0.05, see Supplementary Tables S21 and
S22). Moreover, ODIN with Binomial distribution has a signiﬁ-
cant higher DAGE score than MACS2 and MAnorm on histone
data. We also performed an evaluation of ChIPDiff by compar-
ing the DAGE values of all methods with H equal to the number
of peaks called by ChIPDiff. ODIN with Binomial distribution
has signiﬁcantly higher DAGE scores than ChIPDiff on TF ex-
periments (P value<0.l, see Supplementary Table S24), while
no statistical difference was detected on histone data (see
Supplementary Table S26). In all cases, both ODIN with bino-
mial and mixture of Poisson distribution ranked best by the
Friedman score compared to all competing methods.

5 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

We propose ODIN, a DPC method that performs genomiC signal
processing, DPC and P value calculation in an integrated

framework. Empirical analysis shows that DPs detected by
ODIN are best associated to Changes in gene expression of
genes neighboring these DPs than several of its competing meth-
ods. ODIN can be used with either a Binomial distribution or a
mixture of Poisson distribution. It outperforms methods using
complex distributions as the Negative Binomial used by DBChIP
and PeakDE. These results are further supported with simulated
data, where ODIN outperforms competing methods on scenarios
with few reads and complex DPs. Moreover, we present the ﬁrst
approach to evaluate DPs methods, whiCh is based on the asso-
Ciation of DPs with expression Changes in the same cellular con-
ditions; and a methodology to simulate pairs of ChIP-seq read
libraries with DPs.

Calling DPs is an extremely important but so far poorly
explored problem of ChIP-seq analysis. EpigenomiC consortia
are planning the analysis of ChIP-seq of patients with distinct
disease phenotypes (Adams et al., 2012). Methods capable
for detection of DPs by simultaneous analysis of several
ChIP-seq data will be crucial for suCh medical epigenomics
applications. Aspects suCh as the presence the genetiC variability
of patients (Ashoor et al., 2013) and the over-dispersion of
peaks sizes in biological replicates are open Challenges. We
plan to extend ODIN to allow the analysis of biological repli-
cates and the simultaneous analysis of more than two cellular
conditions.

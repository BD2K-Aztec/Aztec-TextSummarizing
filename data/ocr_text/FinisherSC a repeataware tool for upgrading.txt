Abstract

We introduce FinisherSC, a repeat—aware and scalable tool for upgrading de novo assembly using
long reads. Experiments with real data suggest that FinisherSC can provide longer and higher qual—
ity contigs than existing tools while maintaining high concordance.

Availability and implementation: The tool and data are available and will be maintained at http://

1 Introduction

In de novo assembly pipelines for long reads, reads are often
trimmed or thrown away. Moreover, there is no evidence that state—
of—the—art assembly pipelines are data—efficient. In this work, we ask
whether state—of—the—art assembly pipelines for long reads have al—
ready used up all the available information from raw reads to con—
struct assembly of the highest possible quality. To answer this
question, we first collect output contigs from the HGAP (Chin et 61].,
2013) pipeline and the associated raw reads. Then, we pass them
into our tool FinisherSC to see if higher quality assemblies can be
consistently obtained after post—processing.

2 Methods
2.1 Usage and pipeline

FinisherSC is designed to upgrade de novo assembly using long reads
(e.g. PacBio reads). It is especially suitable for data consisting of a sin—
gle long reads library. Input to FinisherSC are contigs (contigs.fasta)
constructed by an assembler and all the raw reads with adaptors
removed (raw_reads.fasta). Output of FinisherSC are upgraded con—
tigs (improved3.fasta) which are expected to be of higher quality
than its input (e.g. longer N50, longer longest contigs, fewer number
of contigs, high percentage match with reference, high-genome

fraction, etc). In Figure 1, we show an example pipeline in which
FinisherSC can fit. As shown in Figure 1, FinisherSC can be readily
incorporated into state—of—the—art assembly pipelines (e.g. PacBio
HGAP).

2.2 Algorithm and features

The algorithm of FinisherSC is summarized in Algorithm 1. Detailed
description of the algorithm is in the supplementary materials. We
summarize the key features of FinisherSC as follows.

° Repeat—aware: FinisherSC uses a repeat—aware rule to deﬁne
overlap. It uses string graphs to capture overlap information and
to handle repeats so that FinisherSC can robustly merge contigs.
There is an optional component, X—phaser (Lam et 61]., 2014),
that can resolve long approximate repeats with two copies by
using the polymorphisms between them. There is also an op—
tional component, T—solver that can resolve tandem repeat by
using the copy count information.

° Data—efﬁcient: FinisherSC utilizes all the raw reads to perform
re—layout. This can ﬁll gaps and improve robustness in handling
repeats.

° Scalable: FinisherSC streams raw reads to identify relevant reads
for re—layout and reﬁned analysis. MUMMER (Kurtz et 61].,
2004) does the core of the sequence alignment. Although

MUMMER is single threaded, we provide an option to segment
the ﬁles and run multiple MUMMER jobs in parallel. These tech—
niques allow FinisherSC to be easily scalable to high volume of
data.

2. Form a string graph with the BEST successors/predeces—

3. Condense the string graph by contracting edges with
both in—degree and out—degree being 1
4. Use raw reads to declare potential successors/predeces—
sors of dangling contigs
5. Merge contigs (with gaps ﬁlled by reads) when they re—
spectively only have 1 successor/1 predecessor

edges
7. Merge contigs with only 1 predecessor or 1 successor
and each has no more than two competing edges

 

3 Results and discussion

3.1 Experimental evaluation on bacterial genomes

We evaluated the performance of FinisherSC as follows. Raw reads
were processed according to the pipeline in Figure 1. They were first
error corrected and then assembled into contigs by an existing pipe—
line (i.e. HGAP). Contigs were upgraded using FinisherSC and eval—
uated for quality with Quast (Gurevich et al., 2013). The data used
for assessment are real PacBio reads. These include data recently
produced at JGI and data available online supporting the HGAP
publication. We compared the assembly quality of the contigs com—
ing out from the Celera assembler (Myers et al., 2000) of HGAP
pipeline, the upgraded contigs by FinisherSC and the upgraded con—
tigs by PBJelly (English et al., 2012). A summary of the evaluation is
shown in Figure 2. More details can be found in the supplementary
materials. We find that FinisherSC can upgrade the assembly from
HGAP without sacrifice on accuracy on these test cases. Moreover,
the upgraded contigs by FinisherSC are generally of higher quality
than those upgraded by PBJelly. This suggests that there is extra in—
formation from the reads that is not fully utilized by state—of—the—art
assembly pipelines for long reads.

3.2 Experiments on scalability

We tested the scalability of FinisherSC by applying it to handle
larger genomes. The data used are the benchmark data available on
PacBio Devnet. We run FinisherSC with the option of using 20
threads (—par 20) on a server computer. The server computer is
equipped with 64 cores of CPU at clock rate of 2.4—3.3 GHz and
512 GB of RAM. The running time is tabulated in Table 1.

3.3 Discussion

Although FinisherSC was originally designed to improve de novo assem—
bly by long reads, it can also be used to scaffold long contigs (formed by
short reads) using long reads. For that use case, we note that the contigs
formed by short reads can sometimes have length shorter than the aver—
age length of long reads. Therefore, we suggest users to filter out those
short contigs before passing them into FinisherSC.

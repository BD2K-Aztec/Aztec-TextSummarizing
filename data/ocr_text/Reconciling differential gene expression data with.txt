ABSTRACT

Motivation: Many techniques have been developed to compute the
response network of a cell. A recent trend in this area is to compute
response networks of small size, with the rationale that only part of a
pathway is often changed by disease and that interpreting small sub-
networks is easier than interpreting larger ones. However, these meth-
ods may not uncover the spectrum of pathways perturbed in a
particular experiment or disease.

Results: To avoid these difficulties, we propose to use algorithms
that reconcile case-control DNA microarray data with a molecular
interaction network by modifying per-gene differential expression
P—values such that two genes connected by an interaction show simi-
lar changes in their gene expression values. We provide a novel evalu-
ation of four methods from this class of algorithms. We enumerate
three desirable properties that this class of algorithms should address.
These properties seek to maintain that the returned gene rankings are
specific to the condition being studied. Moreover, to ease interpret-
ation, highly ranked genes should participate in coherent network
structures and should be functionally enriched with relevant biological
pathways. We comprehensively evaluate the extent to which each
algorithm addresses these properties on a compendium of gene ex-
pression data for 54 diverse human diseases. We show that the recon-
ciled gene rankings can identify novel disease-related functions that
are missed by analyzing expression data alone.

1 INTRODUCTION

A cell’s response to its environment is governed by an intricate
network of molecular interactions. These interactions dynamic-
ally change in response to a myriad of cues. Therefore, discover-
ing the response network, i.e. the set of molecular interactions

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed

that are active in a given cellular context is a fundamental ques-
tion in computational systems biology (Ideker and Sharan,
2008). Many response network algorithms integrate molecular
interaction networks with treatment-control differential expres-
sion data, which quantiﬁes the statistical signiﬁcance of the dif-
ference between the expression of genes under two conditions,
e.g. diseased versus healthy cells (Beisser et al., 2010; Keller et al.,
2009; Qiu et al., 2010; Ulitsky et al., 2010). Given several treat-
ment and control samples, these methods compute a P-value for
each gene that indicates the statistical signiﬁcance of its differen-
tial expression between treatment and control. These approaches
typically integrate such expression data with the interaction net-
work by directly using each gene’s P-value or some transform-
ation of the P-value as the weight of the gene in the network.
Ideker et a]. (2002) pioneered this type of analysis. After convert-
ing per-gene P—values into z—scores, they computed connected
subgraphs with high aggregate z—scores. Beisser et a]. (2010)
extended the approach of Ideker et a]. (2002) by solving the
prize-collecting Steiner problem. Chowdhury et a]. (2011) identi-
ﬁed dysregulated subnetworks by computing state functions that
indicate which combination of up- and down-regulated genes
within the subnetwork can classify the disease of interest. The
goal of many of these approaches is to score genes by combining
their expression proﬁles across multiple samples and subse-
quently compute a (connected) subgraph such that the genes in
it jointly optimize some combination of their scores. A recent
trend, exempliﬁed by BioNet (Beisser et al., 2010) and DEGAS
(Ulitsky et al., 2010), is to focus on computing subgraphs with
few nodes. The rationale behind these approaches is that small
subnetworks enriched with dysregulated genes correspond to
parts of the disease-related pathways. Such approaches were
motivated by the observation that only part of a pathway is
often changed by disease (Ulitsky et al., 2010) and that interpret-
ing small subnetworks is easier than interpreting larger ones
(Beisser et al., 2010). HotNet (Vandin et al., 2010) identiﬁes sig-
niﬁcantly mutated pathways in cancer by marking mutated genes
in an interaction network and propagating this information
throughout the network by a method similar to the Heat
Kernel (HK) (see Section 2).

While these recent methods are powerful at highlighting speciﬁc
pathways and subnetworks, they have not been designed to un-
cover the spectrum of processes and pathways that might be per-
turbed in a particular experiment or disease. Applying functional

Reconciling differential gene expression data

 

enrichment tests to signiﬁcantly differentially expressed genes can
address this issue, but such analysis typically ignores underlying
protein interactions. Top-ranking differentially expressed genes are
often highly disconnected in the corresponding protein interaction
network, making it difﬁcult to discern the precise mechanisms by
which enriched pathways affect the disease. Furthermore,
insigniﬁcantly differentially expressed genes may represent crucial
components of disease-related pathways, but such genes are often
ignored by standard enrichment methods.

Motivated by these observations, rather than computing
condition-speciﬁc subgraphs, we propose to use previously
published approaches that reconcile differential gene expression
P—values with an underlying interaction network to re—rank all
genes with respect to the treatment of interest. We describe tech-
niques developed in the machine learning and information re-
trieval communities (Zhu et al., 2003; Page et al., 1999; Chung,
2007; Zhou et al., 2004) to reconcile gene expression data with
the interactions in the network by computing smooth functions
over neighboring nodes in the underlying network. In this article,
we use the negative logarithm of the per-gene P—values (which do
not directly incorporate any interaction data) as prior indicators
of each gene’s relevance to a particular treatment; we describe
mathematical functions that allow the expression values to
change so that two genes connected by an interaction have simi-
lar values, while controlling the deviation of those values from
their original settings. This modiﬁcation allows genes with no
signiﬁcant differential expression to be re—ranked highly if their
products interact with the products of many signiﬁcantly differ-
entially expressed genes.

This work offers the following three novel contributions. First,
we propose that such reconciliation algorithms should strive to
maintain the following properties:

(i) Top-ranking genes after reconciliation should participate
in coherent network structures, i.e. interacting genes
should receive similar scores. This property can assist in
the functional evaluation of top-ranking genes.

(ii) Reconciled gene rankings given by different treatments
should be dissimilar, especially among top-ranking genes.
This requirement ensures that the process of reconciliation
does not dilute the differences between the transcriptional
signatures of distinct diseases or treatments.

(iii) Top-ranking reconciled genes should be functionally
coherent.

Second, we comprehensively assess the extent to which each al-
gorithm addresses these three properties. Third, we evaluate each
approach on a large compendium of gene expression data that
includes 54 diverse human diseases. We apply a state-of-the-art
functional enrichment algorithm (Bauer et al., 2010) to address
the functional coherence of the gene rankings provided by the
reconciliation algorithms. We demonstrate that the reconciled
gene rankings identify disease-related functions that would
be missed by analyzing statistically signiﬁcant differentially
expressed genes alone.

2 METHODS

Let G( V, E) denote an undirected protein interaction graph in an organ-
ism, where V is the set of nodes and E is the set of undirected edges, in

which each edge (u, v) represents an interaction between genes u, v e V.
We denote the weight of an edge (u, v) by ww> 0. The larger the weight of
an interaction, the larger is our belief that u and v indeed physically
interact in the cell. Let N, denote the set of neighbors of node u in G
and let du = ZveNu WW denote the weighted degree of u.

Given some biological condition, let s(v) : V —> [R+ be a function that
maps genes in V to a non-negative real number representing their degree
of perturbation in the contrast between the condition and an appropriate
control (e. g. brain cells from patients diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease
(AD) and healthy brain cells). The larger the value of s(v), the more we
consider the gene to be perturbed in the disease compared with the con-
trol. We compute s(v) as the negative absolute value of the base 10 loga-
rithm of the gene’s P-value. We normalize the s(v) values so that they sum
to 1. These represent the starting values for each node in V. Note that s(v)
represents the degree of peturbation of gene v but does not record
whether the gene is up- or down-regulated.

Interacting genes often participate in the same protein complex, are
members of the same biological pathway or are controlled by the same
transcription factor. Consequently, interacting gene pairs commonly dis-
play similar expression proﬁles. The fundamental intuition underlying
our approach is that if two genes u and v are connected by a highly
weighted interaction in G, then s(u) and s(v) should maintain similar
values. Furthermore, the larger the value of WW, the closer s(u) and s(v)
should be. This assumption enables the approaches presented here to
elucidate highly relevant genes that may be missed by differential gene
expression studies alone. For example, genes within the same complex or
pathway may not be individually perturbed to a signiﬁcant extent, but we
may be able to exploit the interactions among them to recognize that the
complex or pathway is perturbed as a whole. Guided by this intuition, we
propose to compute a value p(v) between 0 and 1 for every node v e V.
We want the value of p(v) to simultaneously balance two potentially
conﬂicting constraints:

(1) p(v) remains close to v’s initial value s(v).

(2) p(v) is similar to p(u) for every neighbor u e N,.

We describe four different methods for computing p(v): Vanilla
Algorithm (W, PageRank (PR), GeneMANIA (GM) and Heat Kernel
(HK). These methods were developed previously in machine learning and
information retrieval (Zhu et al., 2003; Page et al., 1999; Chung, 2007;
Zhou et al., 2004) and have proven widely applicable in computational
biology (Mostafavi et al., 2008; Komurov et al., 2010; Vanunu et al.,
2010; Goncalves et al., 2011; Kohler et al., 2008; Winter et al., 2012;
Johannes et al., 2010; Nitsch et al., 2010; Vert and Kanehisa, 2003).
Each of these algorithms appears in the literature under different
names; we select the most recognizable names from the literature.

For the ﬁrst three methods, we describe an energy function over the
graph G that, when minimized, addresses the two constraints listed above.
We then describe an iterative algorithm for each method that efﬁciently
minimizes the energy function and provably converges to the optimum
theoretical solution. We are unable to formulate a similar energy function
for the fourth method, HK. However, we describe a well-known approxi-
mation to the discrete HK equation. This approximation yields a com-
putationally efﬁcient iterative solution similar to those used for the other
three methods. We omit well-known proofs of convergence for each
approach.

2.1 Vanilla algorithm
The Vanilla algorithm seeks to minimize following energy function:

When we compute the values of pV(v) that minimize 5V, the ﬁrst sum
ensures that pV(v) remains close to 50») for each node v in G, while the
second sum ensures that pV(v) remains close to pV(u) for every u e N,.
The parameter q, for 0 < q 5 1, balances the contribution of each sum to
the energy function. Because 5V is a quadratic function of the pV(v)
values, we can minimize it by setting its partial derivative with respect
to each pV(v) to 0, obtaining the following linear system:
qS(v) +  _  Z WuvpV(u)

ueNv
q +  _ 

We compute pV(v) using an iterative algorithm on G. We initialize the
value at node v to 50:). If we use pV, ,(v) to denote the value of node v at
iteration i, we can write the following recurrence for pV,,-(v):

Pv(V) =

 

As i tends to inﬁnity, for each node v, pV,,(v) converges to pV(v).

2.2 PageRank

In the formulation of 5V, the contribution of a node is proportional to its
weighted degree. Therefore, nodes with high weighted degree may have
an unduly large inﬂuence on the solution. The PR approach (Page et al.,
1999; Komurov et al., 2010; Winter et al., 2012; Johannes et al., 2010)
accounts for the effect of the weighted degree of each node by minimizing
a slightly different energy function on G:

EPR Z q 2 [ppR(v)d— s(v)1

 i du dv ]

In the second sum, we divide each occurrence of pPR (v) by dv to adjust
for the weighted degree of node v. As before, the parameter q serves to
balance the conﬂicting constraints represented by each of the two sums in
EPR. Because EPR is a quadratic function of the ppR(v) values, we min-
imize it by setting its partial derivative with respect to each ppR(v), v e V
to 0, obtaining the following linear system:

ppm) = W) + <1 — q) 2 flwpmo).

2.3 GeneMANIA

The GM method (Zhou et al., 2004; Mostafavi et al., 2008; Vanunu et al.,
2010) is motivated by similar concern from the PR method that nodes
with high weighted degree may have disproportionately large effect on the
ﬁnal node values. Therefore, GM seeks to minimize the following energy
function on G:

5m = qZIpGMo») — soar

In the second sum, we divide each occurrence of pGM (v) by dd;
(compared with dividing by dv in PR) to adjust for the weighted degree
of node v. Again, q balances the contribution from each sum in the energy
function. We minimize EGM by setting its partial derivative with respect
to each pGM(v) to 0, achieving the following linear system:

paw) = W) + <1 — q) 2 x/V.:%pGM<u).

2.4 Heat kernel

The Heat Kernel of a graph describes the dispersion of heat throughout a
network over time. Here, the amount of heat corresponds to the degree of
perturbation of each gene, represented by a node in the network, to the
disease of interest. The HK is given by the following equation (Chung,
2007; Nitsch et al., 2010; Vert and Kanehisa, 2003):

00 k
p = Z(_t) Lks = eT’Ls (1)

 

where t parameterizes the rate of heat dispersion, and L describes the
edges between nodes in the network. We deﬁne L = I — W, where I is the
identity matrix, and W is a normalized edge weight matrix such that
WW 2  Because directly computing the matrix exponential in
Equation 1 is computationally expensive, we use the approximation

 

t n

PHK ( n S

which converges to Equation 1 as n —> 00. We must select n large enough
such that the approximation given by pHK is sufﬁciently close to Equation
1. We select n = 100, as this value performed well for Web graphs (Yang
et al., 2007), which are at least an order of magnitude larger than the
biological networks we used. We use the following algorithm to iteratively
compute pHK. Let pHK,0 = s and recursively deﬁne

3 DATASETS

Gene expression data. We used gene expression data for 54
different human diseases and for the corresponding normal
tissues (Suthram et al., 2010). A complete list of diseases is avail-
able in the Supplementary Text. For each disease and its corre-
sponding control, we applied Linear Models for Microarray
Data (LIMMA) (Smyth, 2005) to these DNA microarray data
to compute a t—statistic and a P—value indicating the statistical
signiﬁcance of the differential expression of each gene in that
disease, when compared with the corresponding control. We
used the negative base 10 logarithm of each gene’s P—value as
the initial value for each gene in the network, and we normalized
these values so they summed to 1. We considered alternatively
computing mutual information between each gene and the
sample phenotype labels, but we were concerned that the small
number of samples may not yield reliable mutual information
values. Nonetheless, our methods can be readily applied to
mutual information values, and we plan to investigate this exten-
sion in future research.

Interaction network. We used the human MiMI protein inter-
action network (Tarcea et al., 2009) containing 11,074 proteins
and 77,952 non-self interactions. We estimated the reliability of
each interaction by its FS-weight (Chua et al., 2006) (see
Supplementary Text).

Functional enrichment. We annotated the genes in our network
with 3272 gene sets from MSigDB version 3.0 category C2
(Subramanian et al., 2005), 1703 CORUM complexes (Ruepp
et al., 2008), 223 NCI PID curated pathways (Schaefer et al.,
2009) and 75 NetPath pathways (Kandasamy et al., 2010). We
performed all tests for functional enrichment using Model-based

Reconciling differential gene expression data

 

Gene Set Analysis (MGSA) (Bauer et al., 2010) directly from
the R Bioconductor package. We discuss our selection of
MGSA in the Supplementary Text. We applied MGSA to the
top 250 genes ranked only by their differential expression
P—values and to the top 250 genes after applying our reconcilia-
tion algorithms.

4 RESULTS

We divide our results into ﬁve parts to address the desirable
properties listed in the introduction. First, in Section 4.1, we
examine topological properties of the ﬁnal gene rankings given
by each algorithm, providing insight on how these approaches
address the ﬁrst property. In Section 4.2, we simultaneously
address the second and third properties by analyzing how well
the gene rankings for seven diseases recover the genes in canoni-
cal pathways for those diseases. In Section 4.3, we discuss simi-
larities between the gene rankings produced by each algorithm
across all diseases. Our main concern in these evaluations is the
extent to which disease-speciﬁc signals are not masked by net-
work-based effects, directly addressing the second desirable
property. In Section 4.4, we perform functional enrichment
tests on the top-ranking genes reported by our reconciliation
methods. This analysis further reinforces our conclusions from
the previous section and addresses the ﬁnal desirable property
that top-ranking genes should demonstrate functional coherence.
Lastly, in Section 4.5, we investigate the insulin-mediated glucose
transport pathway in several diseases related to the brain. We
demonstrate that network reconciliation identiﬁes disease-related
proteins from this pathway that are missed by differential expres-
sion analysis.

We performed this analysis over a wide range of values for the
input parameter q; we report results for q e {0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1}.
Note that the HK is parametrized by t>0. We used the trans-
formation q : 2“ to determine values that covered a reasonable
range of possible values for t. This transformation has the addi-
tional beneﬁt that q tends to 0 (respectively, 1) as t tends to 00
(respectively, 0). Because large t increases the dispersion of heat
through the network, the interpretation of q remains the same for
all algorithms: large q gives more weight to the starting values,
while small q emphasizes network topology.

4.1 Network coherence

The ﬁrst desirable property of reconciliation algorithms seeks to
identify coherent network structures among top-ranking genes.
Each algorithm ranks disease-related genes highly by taking into
account both expression and interaction data. However, such
rankings may prove difﬁcult to interpret if the top-ranking
genes are sparsely connected, inducing many small connected
components. Indeed, a lack of connectivity among such compo-
nents may conceal the mechanisms by which the disease-related
genes interact. We computed the number of connected compo-
nents induced in the MiMI network by the top k genes reported
by each of the four reconciliation algorithms for 0 g k g 250.
Supplementary Figure S1 illustrates the change in the number
of connected components induced by the top k genes reported by
each algorithm. Surprisingly, for Vanilla, the connectivity among
top-ranking genes decreases when more emphasis is placed on

the network. Indeed, a decrease in q results in many more con-
nected components among top-ranking genes. Because top-rank-
ing genes reported by Vanilla tend to be less connected as the
network is given higher emphasis, we conclude that the V per-
forms poorly with respect to the network connectivity property.
However, PR, GM and HK drastically decrease the number of
connected components as q decreases, indicating high network
coherence for these algorithms. In Section 2.1 of the
Supplementary Text, we compare these connected component
counts from the true data to 100 randomized gene expression
datasets, demonstrating that the ranks given by the true expres-
sion data consistently display higher network coherence.

4.2 Recovering canonical pathways

We assessed the ability of reconciliation algorithms to recover
genes involved in the canonical pathway for a disease. Of the 54
diseases in our gene expression data, seven were represented in
the Kyoto Encylopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
(Kanehisa et al., 2008), which maintains manually curated path-
ways of disease mechanisms. We applied the network reconcilia-
tion algorithms to each of these seven diseases, namely,
malignant melanoma, Huntington’s disease (HD), glioblastoma,
endometriosis, dilated cardiomyopathy, Alzheimer’s disease
(AD) and acute myeloid leukemia. We assessed how highly the
genes in each disease pathway are ranked by the reconciliation
process and by their initial differential expression values.

Figure 1 displays the hypergeometric P—values of the overlap
between the top 250 genes ranked by each method and the set
of genes in the corresponding KEGG pathway. We plot the
negative logarithm of each P—value. Points to the right of the
dashed gray line indicate signiﬁcant ﬁndings (P< 0.05). Results
using rank cutoffs of 500 and 1000 are available in the
Supplementary Material and reinforce the ﬁndings presented
here. Figure 1 demonstrates that an insigniﬁcant number of
genes in each of the seven KEGG pathways are among the
top-ranked genes when considering differential expression P-
values alone (yellow points). Additionally, Vanilla does not
highly rank a signiﬁcant number of KEGG pathway genes for
any of the seven diseases or for any value of the input parameter
q. In contrast, a statistically signiﬁcant number of KEGG path-
way genes appear among the top 250 genes ranked by PR, GM
and HK for every disease and at least one value of q. These
ﬁndings indicate that reconciling gene expression values with
an underlying interaction network provides insights into disease
mechanisms that may be missed by expression studies alone.

The value of q that results in the most signiﬁcant overlap with
the KEGG pathway varies considerably depending on the dis-
ease and the algorithm. We note that setting q = 0.5 for the PR
algorithm results in the most signiﬁcant P—values for two of the
three brain diseases with canonical pathways in KEGG (glioblas-
toma and AD). Therefore, we set q=0.5 when we perform a
focused analysis of brain diseases in Sections 4.4 and 4.5,
although other choices are reasonable. Because no value of q
for Vanilla successfully identiﬁes disease genes from their cano-
nical pathways, we drop this algorithm from analysis in the
remaining sections and provide results for Vanilla in the
Supplementary Text.

4.3 Similarity between gene rankings

Next, we investigate how each algorithm distinguishes different
diseases. Ideally, applying a reconciliation algorithm to transcrip-
tional signatures from two diseases that affect different biological
pathways should result in different gene rankings, speciﬁcally
among the top-ranking genes. For PR, GM and HK, we examine
the difference between the ﬁnal gene rankings given by each
algorithm across all 54 diseases. Because this collection of dis-
eases affects a wide variety of organs, tissues and cell types, we
expect their disease-related genes (and thus the top-ranking
genes) to vary considerably.

For each algorithm, we computed the J accard index of the top
k genes after reconciliation between every pair of diseases for
0 < k g 250. The J accard index measures the size of the intersec-
tion divided by the size of the union of two sets. Thus, a high
J accard index between a pair of diseases indicates that the top k
genes are highly similar between diseases, while low Jaccard
index suggests the algorithm maintains disease speciﬁcity in its
ﬁnal rankings. Figure 2 illustrates the Jaccard indices for each
algorithm. Each point indicates the average J accard index across
all 524 pairs of diseases. As expected, the Jaccard index
increases with a decrease in q for any rank cutoff. Indeed, as q
decreases, the network plays a more pronounced role in each
algorithm and provides the same signal regardless of the input
disease. Thus, to minimize the overlap between the top k genes
reported for each pair of diseases, one could simply use the initial
rankings given solely by the expression data (i.e. q: 1).
However, this has the obvious drawback that the connectivity
of the proteins is completely ignored.

In general, for every value of q, the GM method results in a
much lower Jaccard index than the other algorithms. Selecting
q = 0.1 is clearly a bad choice, as the J accard index of the top k
genes between any pair of disease is ~0.7 for PR and HK.
However, setting q=0.5 or higher results in a reasonably low
Jaccard index for all algorithms. For the functional enrichment

analysis presented in the remaining sections, we set q=0.5, as
this parameter value jointly addresses the desirable properties for
PR, GM and HK in the analyses presented thus far.

4.4 Functional enrichment analysis

Inter-disease functional similarity. We applied functional
enrichment tests to further evaluate the gene rankings. Using
the gene sets and pathways described in Section 3 as protein
functional annotations, we applied MGSA to the top 250
genes reported by each reconciliation method on seven diseases
that affect the brain: AD, bipolar disorder, glioblastoma, HD,
Rett syndrome, schizophrenia and senescence. Figure 3(a)
illustrates the J accard index between the top k functions returned
by MGSA, 0 < k g 50, for each pair of brain disorders. While the
Jaccard indices are not as low as those for the MGSA results
applied to the initial gene rankings given by the expression data,
there is a remarkably low overlap between the top functions
reported for each pair of diseases. This result supports the ﬁnd-
ings in Section 4.3 that reconciled gene rankings maintain disease

vant to their corresponding diseases in Section 4.5.

Inter-algorithm functional similarity. We also investigated the
similarity between the functional results of different algorithms.
In Figure 3(b), we show the average Jaccard index between the
top k functions returned by MGSA for a pair of reconciliation
algorithms applied to a single disease. We plot the average across
the seven brain disorders. The J accard indices are highest for the
pair of algorithms PR and HK at ~0.3 for the ﬁrst 50 functions.
The small index for any pair of algorithms suggests that each
algorithm probes a different space of functional annotations for
the same disease. We ﬁnd this to be a particularly striking ﬁnd-
ing. Because PR and HK show a high overlap (J accard index 0.7)
between the top 250 genes reported by each algorithm on the
same disease (Supplementary Fig. S4), we expected high

4.5 Insulin-mediated glucose transport in the brain

Finally, we further investigated how reconciliation algorithms
addressed our fourth desirable property that genes involved in
biological functions related to the disease of interest should be
ranked highly. We were particularly interested in the effect of
reconciliation algorithms on low-ranking genes (i.e., genes with
insigniﬁcant differential expression between disease and control)
annotated by such functions. Ideally, we hoped to see the values
of such genes modiﬁed through the reconciliation process in such
a way that most genes involved in relevant functions were re-
ranked highly. For this analysis, we focused on the NCI PID
pathway insulin-mediated glucose transport. We selected this
pathway because dysregulation of insulin-mediated glucose
uptake has been previously implicated in patients diagnosed
with various neurodegenerative disorders, including AD and
HD (Craft and Watson, 2004). After applying PR reconciliation,
this function appears in the top 22 most enriched functions for
four of the seven brain disorders (Table 1), including AD and
HD.

Alzheimer ’s disease. Elderly patients diagnosed with AD show
impaired glucose tolerance, often erroneously attributed to poor
exercise and diet. However, reduced insulin-mediated glucose
uptake is observed in early stage AD patients whose physical

activity and dietary patterns do not differ from healthy adults
(Craft and Watson, 2004). Thus, dysregulation of this pathway
(i.e. enrichment in disease versus control) may provide an early
indication of AD. For each of the seven brain diseases we stu-
died, Table 1 reports the MGSA enrichment posterior probabil-
ities for the NCI PID pathway insulin-mediated glucose transport
in the top 250 proteins before and after applying the PR recon-
ciliation method. This pathway was not enriched in the top 250
proteins ranked only by the differential expression of the corre-
sponding genes. However, PR re—ranked proteins from the insu-
lin-mediated glucose transport pathway highly, drastically
increasing the enrichment of the pathway and moving this func-
tion from rank 3290 before reconciliation to 2 after applying PR.
Thus, we identiﬁed a pathway whose role is highly relevant to
AD but is missed using standard functional enrichment methods
when only the gene expression data is used. By integrating the
expression proﬁle with a network of protein interactions, we
were able to highlight this pathway by re—ranking relevant pro-
teins whose corresponding genes are not signiﬁcantly differen-
tially expressed.

Huntington’s disease. Figure 4(a) illustrates the subnetwork
induced by proteins in the insulin-mediated glucose transport
pathway. At the core of this pathway are seven proteins from
the 14-3-3 protein family. The 14-3-3 proteins play a major role
in cellular signal transduction, and they are known to appear
abundantly throughout the brain. These proteins can bind to a
wide variety of other human proteins, altering features of the

target protein such as subcellular localization, functional activity
and phosphorylation state (Dougherty and Morrison, 2004).
Figure 4(a) demonstrates that most of the genes encoding the
14-3-3 proteins are not signiﬁcantly differentially expressed in
HD versus healthy samples; none of the seven genes appear in
the top 250 signiﬁcantly differentially expressed genes (with the
ﬁrst appearing only at rank 500). However, after applying net-
work reconciliation, as Figure 4(b) illustrates, the ranks of all
seven 14-3-3 proteins increased drastically (along with several
additional members of the pathway). The 14-3-3 proteins were
re—ranked highly because many nearby genes in the network were
signiﬁcantly differentially expressed, and their value propagated
through the dense subnetwork of 14-3-3 proteins during the
reconciliation process. Notice that the insulin-mediated glucose
transport pathway was ranked highly in HD before and after
applying PR (Table 1). However, 12 proteins from this pathway
appeared in the top 250 proteins after reconciliation compared
with just ﬁve before reconciliation. Thus, in this case, reconcilia-
tion did not identify a novel pathway related to the disease (as we
discovered with AD), but reconciliation re—ranked highly rele-
vant proteins that would be missed using differential gene expres-
sion alone. Furthermore, the role of this pathway in HD may be
easier to interpret because the involvement of the 14-3-3 proteins
is highlighted by reconciliation but missed otherwise.

High degree proteins. One concern with our methodology is
that the reconciliation approaches may overemphasize proteins
with many neighbors in the network. Indeed, the reconciliation
methods may be more likely to propagate value to nodes with
many neighbors, and our analysis of AD and HD may be biased,
as we have already mentioned that the 14-3-3 proteins are highly
promiscuous. However, notice that the insulin-mediated glucose
transport pathway is not found to be enriched in bipolar disor-
der, schizophrenia or senescence after reconciliation (Table 1). In
fact, this pathway is even less enriched in schizophrenia after
reconciliation, demonstrating that the enrichment results are
not biased by such high degree nodes.

methods actively modify gene expression measurements to
match the constraints imposed by the edges in the network,
while controlling the deviation of the modiﬁed values from
their original settings. We enumerated three desirable biological
properties that this class of algorithms should address. These
properties aim to balance input from gene expression data with
an underlying interaction network while maintaining that the
returned gene rankings are speciﬁc to the condition being stu-
died. Addressing any one of these properties alone may be trivial.
For example, to address the ﬁrst property that top-ranking genes
should participate in coherent network structures, one could
simply return a list of genes such that each gene in the list is
connected to one of its predecessors in the list. Thus, any cutoff

Reconciling differential gene expression data

 

in the gene ranking induces a single connected component.
However, addressing all three properties simultaneously is
more difﬁcult and warranted further investigation. We analyzed
each algorithm using differential gene expression data from a
variety of human diseases that interrogate vastly different
organs and tissues. Ultimately, this work attests to the wide
applicability of reconciliation algorithms and suggests reasonable
values of their input parameters to address the three desirable
properties. We demonstrated that i) PR, GM and HK always
outperform Vanilla with respect to our primary motivating prop-
erties and ii) applying any of these three network reconciliation
algorithms then analyzing the resulting gene ranks yields more
interpretable results than analyzing the ranking of signiﬁcantly
differentially expressed genes alone.

In the future, we plan to consider other biologically relevant
formulations of the energy function. An important extension is
to situations that violate our assumption that two linked genes
should be similarly perturbed in a condition. For instance, a
transcription factor may be connected to a target gene that it
down-regulates. In this situation, it seems appropriate to ensure
that the transcription factor and its target have distinct values.
More generally, the expression of a gene may have a complex
dependence on those of its interactors. When such relationships
are known, it will be useful to incorporate them into our formu-
lation. Lastly, our methods use the signiﬁcance of a gene’s dif-
ferential expression while ignoring whether the gene is up- or
down-regulated. Promising extensions may incorporate the direc-
tion of regulation as well as the mechanism of regulatory
interactions.

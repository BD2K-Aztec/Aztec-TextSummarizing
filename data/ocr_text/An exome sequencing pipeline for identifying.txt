ABSTRACT

Motivation: Despite the prevalence of copy number variation (CNV)
in the human genome, only a handful of confirmed associations have
been reported between common CNVs and complex disease. This
may be partially attributed to the difficulty in accurately genotyping
CNVs in large cohorts using array-based technologies. Exome
sequencing is now widely being applied to case—control cohorts
and presents an exciting opportunity to look for common CNVs
associated with disease.

Results: We developed ExoCNVTest: an exome sequencing analysis
pipeline to identify disease-associated CNVs and to generate
absolute copy number genotypes at putatively associated loci. Our
method re-discovered the LCE3B_LCE3C CNV association with
psoriasis (P-value = 5 x 10e—6) while controlling inflation of test
statistics (A < 1). ExoCNVTest-derived absolute CNV genotypes were
97.4% concordant with PCR-derived genotypes at this locus.
Availability and implementation: ExoCNVTest has been
implemented in Java and R and is freely available from www

1 INTRODUCTION

Common copy number variation (CNV) in the human genome
has been extensively catalogued using both array comparative
hybridization (aCGH) as well as more recently with next— generation
whole genome sequencing (Conrad et al., 2010; Mills et al., 2011;
Redon et al., 2006). Studies have demonstrated that common CNV
is prevalent in genic as well as non—genie regions of the genome and
accounts for ~18% of detected genetic variation in gene expression
(Stranger et al., 2007). While common copy number variants
associated with complex disease have been identiﬁed (Aitman et al.,
2006; de Cid et al., 2009; Diskin et al., 2009; McCarroll et al., 2008),
they are vastly fewer than reported single—nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) associations. In a landmark study, the Wellcome Trust
Case Control Consortium identiﬁed the majority of common CNV
with allele frequency >5% and genotyped this variation in seven

complex disease cohorts and two control cohorts using micro—
array—based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). However,
analysis of these data revealed only three previously identiﬁed
copy number associations (Craddock et al., 2010). This study also
comprehensively identiﬁed many sources of bias which continue to
plague CNV association studies, including batch effects, systematic
differences between DNA extracted from cell lines versus whole
blood, homology, particularly to the MHC, as well as difﬁculty in
accurately determining CNV genotypes. The authors of this study
concluded that the subset of CNVs that are genotypeable on CGH
arrays—mostly simple non—recurrent deletions—do not explain a
large proportion of phenotypic variation. However, there remains
the possibility of extensive disease association with more complex
CNV, as well as common CNV with small to moderate effect
sizes.

In contrast to most complex disease, the role of common CNV in
the pathogenesis of psoriasis has been robustly demonstrated and
replicated across multiple populations worldwide (de Cid et al.,
2009; Hollox et al., 2008; Huffmeier et al., 2010; Li et al., 2011;
Riveira—Munoz et al., 2011; Wiwanitkit, 2010; Xu et al., 2011). In
particular, association between psoriasis and a deletion spanning the
‘late corniﬁed envelope’ genes LCE3B and LCE3C was originally
shown in European populations (de Cid et al., 2009) and was
subsequently replicated in a Chinese cohort (Xu et al., 2011). This
CNV is a simple 32.2—kb deletion, with allele frequency of ~60%,
for which both heterozygote and homozygote deletions are found in
the population. The LCE3B_LCE3C deletion has an odds ratio of
~1.38 for psoriasis.

Exome capture sequencing is now widely being applied to
both Mendelian and complex disease cohorts (Ng et al., 2010),
primarily to ﬁnd rare associations with disease which have not been
identiﬁed by extensive GWAS (O’Roak et al., 2011), as well as to
reﬁne association signals already reported (Bonnefond et al., 2012;
Palmer et al., 2011; Rivas et al., 2011). Exome sequencing uses
hybridization technology to ﬁrst capture the majority of exons, and
then subsequently applies massively parallel sequencing to these
captured fragments. As the sequencing step is a stochastic process,
the number of times a sequence is read should be reﬂective of its
relative copy number in the original sample. However, because of the
hybridization step, many of the biases present in array—based studies,
such as batch effects and, effects from obtaining DNA from different
sources are still present in these data. Nevertheless, the utility of

Exome sequencing pipeline for identifying and genotyping CNV

 

exome sequence data to examine CNV in matched tumour/healthy
samples has already been demonstrated (Sathirapongsasuti et al.,
2011).

Exome capture may also be a promising approach for ﬁnding
common copy number association with disease. However, the ability
to accurately call absolute copy number genotypes from these data
has yet to be demonstrated. Moreover, there has not yet been
any demonstration of the ability to re—discover known common
CNV associations from these data. In this article, we develop an
approach to ﬁnd common CNV associated with complex disease.
We apply this approach to exome sequence data obtained on a
psoriasis case—control cohort. We demonstrate that we are able to
overcome inﬂation of test—statistics while identifying the known
LCE3B_LCE3C deletion association with P—value of 5 X 10e—6
in a case—control cohort of 1500 samples. Moreover, we show that
we can use exome sequence data to generate highly accurate absolute
CNV genotypes at this locus.

2 METHODS

2.1 Exon capture and sequencing

Genomic DNA of each individual was hybridized with NimbleGen 2.1 M—
probe sequence capture array to enrich the exonic DNA in each library. The
array captures 18 654 of the 20 091 genes deposited in Consensus Coding
Sequence Region database.

DNA was randomly fragmented by Covaris to an average size of
200—300 bp, and adaptors were ligated to both ends of the resulting
fragments. The adaptor—ligated DNA products were ampliﬁed with different
index primers. The same amount of PCR product from pairs of samples
was pooled then hybridized to each capture array following NimbleGen’s
protocol, after which the exome—enriched DNA fragments were eluted from
the array and ampliﬁed by ligation—mediated PCR, and non—hybridized
fragments were then washed out.

Sequencing was carried out on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform for each
captured library independently to ensure each sample had at least ~15—fold
coverage. Raw image ﬁles were processed by Illumina Pipeline (version
1.3.4) for base—calling with default parameters and the sequences of each
individual were generated as 90—bp reads.

SOAPaligner (v2.21) (Li et al., 2008) was used to align the sequencing
reads to the NCBI human genome reference assembly (build 36.3) with a
maximum of three mismatches and the parameters set as ‘—a —b —D —o —u —r 1
—s 40 —1 35’.

2.2 Read depth normalization

Within each capture region i, and for each individual k = 1 . . . N, we record the
total aligned read depth divided by the average read depth for that sample,
which we label rijk, for each base pair j = 1  M. We then calculate the
ﬁrst ‘local’ principal component FPCLk for each matrix R,- = {rijk}, using
an iterative scaling algorithm outlined below. This algorithm has a very low
memory footprint and is highly computationally efﬁcient. We then calculate
the ﬁrst 50 ‘global’ principal components of the matrix comprised of all of the
local ﬁrst principal components {FPCLk}, which we label GPC1  GPC50.
This calculation is carried out using the singular value decomposition, which
is not as fast or memory efﬁcient as the iterative scaling algorithm, but is more
accurate for calculating lower order PCs. These global PCs are considered
to capture biases which might lead to artefactual CNV association. We then
calculate modiﬁed local PCs by projecting out the ﬁrst H of these global
PCs, for ﬁxed H:

(H)

FPCi =FPCi — 21121.1, proj (chi, GPCh) (1)

where
proj (FPCi, GPCh) = (< FPCi,GPC11 > / < GPCh,GPC11 >) *GPCh (2)

is the projection of the FPC; onto the hth global PC, using < > to denote the
inner product in a N dimensional vector space.

2.3 Iterative scaling algorithm to calculate FPC

We have implemented an algorithm described in (Roweis, 1998) for
computationally efﬁcient calculation of the ﬁrst principal component (FPC).
We ﬁrst centralize the matrix R; so that each column has zero mean. We
ﬁrst FPC; to be a vector of length N with entries randomly chosen from the
interval (0,1). We then iteratively update FPC,- via the following equations:

tZZJ-ZIHM<rij.,FPCi>rij. (3)

until convergence of FPCi. This algorithm avoids the computationally
expensive calculation of the covariance matrix R *RT. Moreover, it has a very
low memory footprint as the calculation in Equation (3) can be calculated via
streaming one column of the depth matrix at a time. This algorithm accurately
calculates the FPC but becomes progressively less accurate for lower order
PCs.

2.4 Association with disease status

For a ﬁxed level of adjustment, H, we then carry out association of FPCEH)
over all regions i, with the case—control phenotype. The association is
modelled with logistic regression, with P—values calculated using the GLM
package in R. We plot quantile—quantile plots for different values of H and
also calculate the genomic control inﬂation factor A in order to inspect for
inﬂation of test statistics.

2.5 Calculating absolute copy number genotypes

For a given putatively association region i, and for each sample, k, we
calculate {raijk} as the average depth in non—overlapping 100—bp windows j
divided by the genome—wide average depth. We then project out the ﬁrst H
global PCs to calculate

mi}? = my; — 21.2111 project... GPCh) (5)
We then apply the population—haplotype clustering model of canap
(Coin et al., 2010) to these data in order to jointly segment each sample
into different CNV states. This is achieved by using a different emission
distribution per hidden copy number genotype CN 2 0  4 per 100—bp
window to model the normalized read depth. Spatial modelling of the CNV
is achieved via a HMM as previously described. CNVhap returns the CNV
genotypes for each sample, as well as an estimate of the certainty of these
genotypes.

3 RESULTS

We applied ExoCNVTest to exome sequence data collected on 800
controls and 700 psoriasis cases. Association of the uncorrected
FPC was highly inﬂated with inﬂation factor (k) of 8.5 (Fig. 1 and
Table 1). In this analysis the known association LCE3B_LCE3 C was
ranked 3750 out of 105 088 regions. Correction for 5 and 20 GPCs
progressively reduced inﬂation of test statistics and also increased
the rank of LCE3B_LCE3 C. However, correction for 40 GPCs was
required to entirely remove inﬂation of test statistics and reduce
). < 1. In this analysis the LCE3B_LCE3 C cluster was ranked 25th,
with P—value of 7.26 — 5.

In order to investigate whether our approach was accurately
capturing the underlying CNV present in LCE3B_LCE3 C, we

investigated the correlation between the adjusted FPC in these
capture regions and gold standard copy number genotypes obtained
from PCR in these samples. We observed increasing correlation
between the adjusted FPC and the gold—standard PCR genotypes
up to 20 GPC, but not beyond (Table 2). This demonstrates that
adjusting for GPCs has two effects—the ﬁrst being to reduce
spurious signals and the second being to increase the correlation
between real and detected signals at genuine associated loci,
although the optimal number of GPC correction may be different
for these two goals. We also observed substantial GC biases in
uncorrected association statistics, with an over—representation of
signiﬁcantly associated signals at ~33% and 60% GC content
(Fig. 2A). Correcting for 40 GPCs removed this bias (Fig. 2B).
Finally, we attempted to obtain absolute copy number genotypes
at the LCE3B_LCE3C loci. We did this by averaging the per—
sample read depth in 100—bp windows divided by average genome
wide read depth and then projecting out the ﬁrst 40 global PCs.

for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 copy numbers, respectively. canap updates the
positions of these cluster positions within a generalized expectation
maximization framework and then reports the per—sample copy
number genotypes (Fig. 3). The reported CNV genotypes were
found to be 97.4% concordant with gold standard CNV genotypes,
with a missing rate of 14.7% (Table 3). These CNV genotypes had
stronger association with case—control status (P—value of 56 — 6) than
FPC, demonstrating the value of using these genotypes to reﬁne the
association signal.

4 DISCUSSION

While approaches for ﬁnding common SNP association with
disease have become routine, ﬁnding common CNV associated with
complex disease has proven more elusive. Accurately genotyping
CNVs in large case—control cohorts using data from SNP genotyping
arrays remains very challenging, and attempts to associate CNV
genotypes deﬁned in this way with disease have often led to
highly inﬂated test statistics, as well as results that are difﬁcult
to independently replicate. Array CGH was used to discover the
LCE3B_LCE3C association, and studies using array CGH tend
to be more robust. However, aCGH studies are still subject to
substantial batch effects, and aCGH has not been widely applied
to very large multi—centre case—control cohorts needed to detect
small to modest effect sizes. Now that exome sequencing is being
routinely applied to case—control cohorts, there is a new opportunity
to look for common CNV associations with disease. This article
provides the ﬁrst ‘proof—of—principle’ that exome sequencing can
be used in this way, by developing an algorithm which adequately
controls for batch effects, and applying this algorithm to re—discover
one of the few conﬁrmed common CNV associations with complex
disease.

We have also shown that as well as detecting CNV association
with disease, it is possible to calculate highly accurate absolute
copy number genotypes at associated loci. To do this, we have
applied canap to perform joint CNV segmentation and genotyping.
canap has been shown to be one of the most sensitive CNV
discovery and genotyping algorithms, due to its ﬂexible modelling
of intensity data (in this case read—depth data) across an entire
population.

Application of our method yielded an association P—value
between LCE3B_LCE3C_del and psoriasis of 726—5 using FPC
corrected for 40 GPCs, and 56—6 using estimated absolute
CNV genotypes. While these P—values are not as signiﬁcant as
the initial reported P—value of 1386—8 (de Cid 6t al., 2009),
this initial study was based on 2831 samples while the data
presented here are derived from 1500 samples. A UK replication

study with 1962 samples obtained an association P—value of
0.03, while a larger German replication study with 2278 samples
obtained an association P—value of 336—5 (Riveira—Munoz 6t al.,
2011).

Principal components are widely used to adjust for the inﬂation of
test statistics due to population structure in genome—wide association
studies; however, these studies typically only adjust for up to 10
PCs, with a greater number of PCs required for highly structured
populations. The fact that 40 PCs were required to correct for read—
depth biases likely reﬂects the fact that the ‘batch’ size consisted of
two samples per capture array.

We might speculate that CNV of genes, and more speciﬁcally
exons, may generate substantial phenotypic variation. Our ability
to assess this effect to date has been limited by the technical
challenge of array technologies. Exome sequencing, however, as it is
measuring precisely this type of variation in the genome, provides an
exciting opportunity to ﬁnally assess the association between gene
copy number and phenotype.

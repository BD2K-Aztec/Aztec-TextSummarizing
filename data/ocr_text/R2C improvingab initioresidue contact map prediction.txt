Abstract

Motivation: Inter—residue contacts in proteins dictate the topology of protein structures. They are
crucial for protein folding and structural stability. Accurate prediction of residue contacts especially
for long—range contacts is important to the quality of ab inito structure modeling since they can en—
force strong restraints to structure assembly.

Results: In this paper, we present a new Residue—Residue Contact predictor called R2C that com—
bines machine learning—based and correlated mutation analysis—based methods, together with a
two—dimensional Gaussian noise filter to enhance the long—range residue contact prediction. Our
results show that the outputs from the machine learning—based method are concentrated with bet—
ter performance on short—range contacts; while for correlated mutation analysis—based approach,
the predictions are widespread with higher accuracy on long—range contacts. An effective query—
driven dynamic fusion strategy proposed here takes full advantages of the two different methods,
resulting in an impressive overall accuracy improvement. We also show that the contact map dir—
ectly from the prediction model contains the interesting Gaussian noise, which has not been dis—
covered before. Different from recent studies that tried to further enhance the quality of contact
map by removing its transitive noise, we designed a new two—dimensional Gaussian noise filter,
which was especially helpful for reinforcing the long—range residue contact prediction. Tested on
recent CASP10/11 datasets, the overall top US accuracy of our final R2C predictor is 17.6%/15.5%
higher than the pure machine learning—based method and 7.8%/8.3% higher than the correlated
mutation analysis—based approach for the long—range residue contact prediction.

1 Introduction

Residue contact map is a two—dimensional (2D) representation of a
protein’s three—dimensional (3D) structure. It constrains the con—
formation of protein structures, as a result, accurate prediction of
contact map can facilitate ab initio structure modeling (Vassura
et 61]., 2008; Wu et 61]., 2011). The contact map can be viewed as a
symmetrical matrix, Where each element indicates Whether the two

residues are close enough in its 3D space to form an interaction or
not. It has been shown that even very sparse true contact informa—
tion can also help to generate correct modeling at the fold level
(Kim et 61]., 2014). Furthermore, contact maps have been Widely
used for model assessment (Wang et 61]., 2011; Zhou and Skolnick,
2008) and structure alignment (Wang et 61]., 2013; Xu et 61].,
2007)

Improving residue contact prediction has been of interest for
many years due to its critical importance in structure bioinformatics
(Cheng and Baldi, 2007; Fariselli and Casadio, 1999; Gobel et al.,
1994; Jones et al., 2012; Wu and Zhang, 2008), with either
sequence or structure template information. The existing ab initio
sequence—based prediction methods can be generally classified into
two categories: supervised learning and unsupervised learning. From
the perspective of supervised learning, contact prediction is typically
treated as a 2—class classification problem (contact versus non—con—
tact). This type of contact predictors like PROFcon (Punta and Rost,
2005), SVMcon (Cheng and Baldi, 2007), SVMSEQ (Wu and
Zhang, 2008), DNCON (Eickholt and Cheng, 2012) and PhyCMAP
(Wang and Xu, 2013), which were constructed with supervised ma—
chine learning (ML) algorithms such as neural network (NN), sup—
port vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) etc. For the
unsupervised learning group, co—evolution information from mul-
tiple sequence alignment (MSA) is analyzed to identify residue pairs
that are in contact spatially. To the best of our knowledge, Gobel
et al. firstly utilized correlated mutations to infer residue contacts in
proteins by calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient between
every two columns in MSA (Gobel et al., 1994). Following this
work, several mutual information—based local algorithms were pro—
posed to improve the prediction accuracy, such as, MI (Gloor et al.,
2005), MIp (Dunn et al., 2008) and MIc (Lee and Kim, 2009) etc.

One recent methodology development effort in this regard is to
construct a consensus prediction model with ML—based and correl—
ation mutation analysis (CMA)—based methods, which has been
shown to be capable of achieving better performance than any single
type of prediction model (Jones et al., 2015; Li et al., 2011; Skwark
et al., 2014; Wang and Xu, 2013). The inferred co-evolution infor-
mation indicates the potential of each residue pair to form a contact,
and it can be used either as input feature to ML algorithms or as an—
other prediction score at the decision level (Yang et al., 2013). The
reason for the better performance of fusing ML—based and CMA—
based methods is that they are highly complementary to each other.
Generally, for the ML—based predictions, the performance is the best
on short—range contacts because the population of short—range train—
ing samples is much larger than that of the long—range contacts,
therefore leading to more learned rules. Hence, the corresponding
top outputs are concentrated together on the predicted contact map.
But the CMA—based engines do not need the training step and are
not affected by the training distributions. Their top outputs are
widespread on the whole contact map, making long—range contact
predictions more accurate. The prediction coverages of the two
methods strongly complement each other, resulting in an overall
performance improvement of the final consensus system.

Another method is to construct multi—layer or deep learning pre-
dictors. Based on the observation that residue contacts are densely
distributed in native structures, deep learning framework was
applied to mine implicit contact patterns (Di Lena et al., 2012; Jones
et al., 2015 ; Skwark et al., 2014), which takes the neighboring con-
tact information as temporal features. In this iterative way, a contact
predictor can usually give better results than the one—layer model.

The third track of efforts for improving residue contact predic—
tion is adding an additional noise filtering post—processing step to
optimize the raw contact map from the prediction models (Abu—
Doleh et al., 2012; Wozniak and Kotulska, 2014). For the CMA—
based approaches, indirect coupling effect is a widely observed
factor that restricts the prediction performance. It is caused by two
direct coupling pairs that share a common residue, which results in
the so—called transitive dependencies (residues A—B and B—C are in

contact which induces a contact prediction pair of A—C).
Sometimes, the interaction strength of the indirect coupling pair is
larger even than the direct coupling pairs (Burger and Van
Nimwegen, 2010). This transitive noise can be removed through re—
cently proposed global algorithms via maximum entropy (Morcos
et al., 2011), sparse inverse covariance estimation (Jones et al.,
2012), pseudo-likelihood maximization (Ekeberg et al., 2013;
Kamisetty et al., 2013), or matrix eigenvalue transformation meth-
ods (Feizi et al., 2013; Sun et al., 2015). Some typical transitive—
noise-filtering algorithms include meCA (Morcos et al., 2011),
PSICOV (Jones et al., 2012), plmDCA (Ekeberg et al., 2013),
GREMLIN (Kamisetty et al., 2013), ND (network deconvolution)
(Feizi et al., 2013) and BND (balanced network deconvolution) (Sun
et al., 2015).

In this study, we aim to derive better contact map predictions in
two aspects: (i) When we try to combine ML—based and CMA—based
methods, how do we derive a better fusion strategy making the con—
sensus system more efficient despite different conditions for each
query protein? (ii) Besides the well—known transitive noise, is there
another non—discovered noise mode in the raw contact map?

For the first aspect, we have designed a problem—feature—driven
fusion strategy in the proposed RZC (Residue—Residue Contact pre—
dictor) system. First, the prediction performance of the CMA—based
approaches highly depends on the number of effective sequences in
MSA (Jones et al., 2012, 2015; Skwark et al., 2014), i.e. the more ef—
fective homologous sequences it has, the better the performance that
will be achieved. In light of this conclusion, a reliable weight will be
calculated to associate with the CMA—based predictions according
to the number of effective sequences in the query sequence’s MSA.
Second, we consider the different types of contacts with different
fusion strategies since the ML—based and CMA—based predictors per—
form differently on short-range and long—range contacts. For short—
range contacts, we will assign a small weight to the CMA—based
engine. In other words, a large weight will be assigned to the
ML—based part. Similarly, when we make predictions for long-range
contacts, we will assign a large weight to the CMA—based engine.
This will ensure that each engine’s output will carry more weight for
sequences in which they historically perform better.

For the second aspect, besides the transitive noise, we found that
the Gaussian noise also commonly exists in the contact map from
the CMA—based predictions. A two—dimensional noise filter is de-
signed to remove the Gaussian noise, which can effectively improve
the prediction of long—range residue contacts. As far as we know,
this is the first time a different noise mode was found in the residue
contact map, and its elimination will enhance the predicted contact
map.

2 Materials and methods
2.1 Contact definition

In general, two residues are considered to be in contact if certain
atoms are close enough to form molecular interaction. In the
Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP) experi-
ment, contact definition is based on the spatial distance of C); atoms.
For instance, if the Euclidean distance between the C); atoms (Co, for
GLY) of two amino acids is less than a given threshold, e.g. 8 A,
then the two residues are said to be in contact.

Residue—residue contacts are categorized into three types based
on sequence separation of the two member residues: short—, me—
dium- or long—range, where the sequence separations are between 6

Dynamic fusion strategy and Gaussian noise filter improve residue contact map prediction 2437

 

and 11, 12 and 23 or at least 24 residues, respectively. The long—
range contacts have received more attention due to their crucial
folding roles in protein structures (Gromiha, 2011). But this cat—
egory of contacts is the hardest to be accurately predicted in the ab
initio protein structure prediction. For the free modeling (FM) tar-
gets in recent CASP10 and CASP11 two competitions, which have
no structure templates in protein data bank (PDB), the average US
long—range contact prediction accuracies from different participating
groups are 12.4% and 12.3%, respectively (Monastyrskyy et a],
2014,2015)

2.2 Benchmark datasets

The training dataset was taken from SVMSEQ (Wu and Zhang,
2008), which was homology—reduced at 25% sequence identity level
resulting in 554 non—homologous protein sequences. The number of
amino acids of each training protein ranges from 50 to 300.
According to the above definition of residue contacts, the true con—
tacts in native structures are extremely sparse (N2 to 3%), which is
similar to observations in previous studies (Bacardit et al., 2012;
Fuchs et al., 2009; Jones et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2013).

For testing purposes, 116 CASP10 targets and 103 CASP11 tar—
gets were used for evaluating the developed RZC predictor. For the
CASP10 dataset, we have removed 7 targets (T0651—D3, T0675 —D1,
T0675-D2, T0677—D1, T0700-D1, T0709-D1 and T0711-D1) that
contain less than 50 residues, and 2 targets (T075 9—D1 and T0820—
D2) from the CASP11 dataset for the same reason. Since the training
dataset was released in 2008, thus all the targets in CASP10 (2012)
and CASP11 (2014) were not included in the training dataset, and
also the hard targets in these two CASP competitions cannot find
homologous structure templates from the training dataset. It is
worth noting that the performance was assessed at the domain level,
i.e. test sequences are part of the entire protein sequences. Among
the CASP10 test set, there are 35 hard targets, and 48 hard targets in
the CASP11 test set. These targets were defined as hard because the
averaged TM—score of the first models predicted by the best half of
participated servers is lower than 0.5 in the CASP.

2.3 RZC prediction model

The proposed RZC predictor is a hierarchical two—step prediction
system, where the first step is generating a raw residue contact map,
followed by a Gaussian noise filter to further improve the prediction
quality. The initial residue—relation data is predicted by a consensus
model, which is designed on a new query—driven dynamic fusion of
ML—based and CMA—based predictions. In the second step, by sys—
tematically digging into the data, we show that there is Gaussian
noise buried in the raw contact map that is different from the previ-
ously observed transitive noise in predicted contact maps.
Accordingly, we have developed a two—dimensional Gaussian noise
filter for post-processing the initial predictions. Figure 1 shows the
system architecture of RZC predictor.

2.3.1 Query-driven dynamic fusion

Because of the importance of inter—residue contacts in solving a pro—
tein’s 3D structure, prediction methodology has been developed
over many years. In the literature, there are two distinctive methods
that can infer residue contact map based solely on protein sequence:
supervised ML—based and unsupervised CMA—based methods. Their
basic ideas are very different from each other. The ML—based meth—
ods significantly depend upon the constructed training datasets used
for learning classification rule. The difficulties for constructing an

Fig. 1. System architecture of RZC residue contact predictor. A query-driven
dynamic fusion strategy is used to combine the outputs from ML-based en-
semble SVM and CMA-based PSICOV. The weights are determined based on
contact types and the effective size of the MSA (Meﬁ). A two-dimensional
Gaussian noise filter is then used to clean the predicted relation data

efficient ML—based prediction model include the fact that training
samples are non—convex and their distributions are extremely imbal-
anced between positive and negative classes. Furthermore, the com—
monly used ML algorithms are usually black boxes, with a
concomitant lack of interpretability. On the other hand, the CMA—
based approaches do not require the training procedure and can be
considered as an unsupervised engine. They infer the contact prob—
ability of two residues based on a co—evolution score calculated from
the MSA derived by searching the query sequence against a protein
database. Hence, the prediction accuracy of these approaches will
significantly rely on the quality of the query protein’s MSA. Thus,
they usually will not work well for hard proteins, where only a few
homologous sequences can be found in current databases. The other
widely observed problem for CMA—based approaches is that their
outputs are contaminated with transitive noise (Sun et al., 2015),
which needs an efficient noise filter.

Although the above two prediction routines are different, they
are in many ways complementary to each other. First, since the
training samples of ML—based methods are not extracted from the
query protein’s homologous sequences, their outputs will be a strong
complement to the CMA—based approaches, especially on the hard
targets. Second, the classification rules of ML—based methods will
have a clear preference to put the predictions on certain concen—
trated regions of the contact map due to the training sample distri-
butions. However, the CMA—based approaches do not need the
training steps and their outputs were found widespread on the con—
tact map, serving as a strong complement to the ML—based methods
in terms of prediction coverage (Yang et al., 2013).

To take full advantage of both ML—based and CMA—based meth—
ods, the key is to design a proper fusion strategy (Shen and Chou,
2006), a difficult task considering that an improper combination ap-
proach may even deteriorate the system. In this paper, we mainly
use the following two conditions to construct an efficient consensus
system.

First, the ML—based and CMA—based methods perform differ-
ently on the three categories of contacts. Based on our previous stud—
ies (Yang et al., 2013), the ML—based methods will be more accurate
for short—range contacts, while the CMA—based approaches are
more useful on long—range contacts. Thus, we will assign different
weights to the two independent engines on different types of con—
tacts. Second, the performance of CMA—based engine varies for each
query protein, as it is heavily dependent on the MSA’s quality (Jones
et al., 2012, 2015; Skwark et al., 2014). Hence, the consensus sys—
tem needs to be adaptable to the different queries.

With this in mind, given two residues R,- and R], we designed a
query—driven dynamic combination scheme to calculate their contact
probability defined as follows:

ORZC : (1 — weight)OML —I— weightOCMA

weight : min{log2(Meff)/20, 0.3}, if short-range
weight = min{log2 (Mew/16, 0.5}, if medium-range
weight : min{log2 (Mew/12, 0.8}, if long-range

where ORZC is the final output that indicates the likelihood of two
residues forming a contact, OML is the output of the ML—based en—
gine, and OCMA is the output of the CMA—based engine. The param—
eter weight is calculated according to the three contact types and the
number of effective sequences (Meff) in the MSA. The logarithmic
function is used to rescale Meff to a comparable value to the upper
boundary control thresholds (0.3, 0.5, 0.8), which were optimized
on the benchmark datasets (refer to Supporting Information). The
short-, medium— and long—range of R,- and R,- are defined in the above
section. The Meff is defined as:

1
Meff = Z — (2)
P=1a~~~aN 1 T Zq=1,...,NSP=‘I

where N is the number of aligned sequences in the MSA, and SW] is
a binary value, which is set to 1 if the hamming distance between se—
quences p and q is less than 0.38 (Jones et al., 2012).

The ML—based prediction module is implemented with ensemble
classifier framework. Previous studies have shown that the ratio of
positive contact and negative non—contact samples in the training set
can be as low as 1:50 (Bacardit et al., 2012), which will cause an ex-
tremely imbalanced learning problem. In light of this, we under—
sampled from the non—contact samples with a ratio of 1:4 between
positive contact and negative non—contact samples. The main pur-
pose of using an ensemble strategy is to reduce the information loss
caused by the under—samplings. For each contact type (short, me—
dium and long), we repeated under—sampling N times, which will
generate N subsets of training samples for constructing SVM mod—
els. In order to balance the running time and prediction perform-
ance, N :5 was used. For 3 types of contacts, there are total 15
SVM models in our RZC protocol. The sequential features fed into
SVM include the frequently used position specific scoring matrix,
predicted secondary structure, predicted solvent accessibility and se—
quence separation, which have been demonstrated useful for residue
contact prediction (Wu and Zhang, 2008). Finally, OML in Equation
1 is the output of ensemble classifier, which is the average of five in-
dependent predictions for each contact type. The CMA—based engine
in Equation 1 used here is the recently developed PSICOV (Jones
et al., 2012), which uses the sparse inversion of sample covariance
matrix to detect direct couplings.

2.3.2 Two-dimensional Gaussian noise filter

Given a raw contact map, which can be represented as a two—dimen—
sional matrix of CMraW: [i, jJL X L, where i or j is the residue pos—
ition along the protein sequence, and L is the length of the protein
sequence. Here, we suppose the raw relation matrix of CMraw is
composed by the native true contact map CMnat and the noise map
8. If we can accurately estimate the noise, we can then get a perfect
expected contact map CMeXp. With a hypothesis of existing additive
Gaussian noise in CMraW, we have:

CMraani) :CMnat(i7j)+8(i7j)7  1727"'7L 

where the noise 8 is independent and identically distributed with
mean value 0 and standard deviation 0', which can be derived ac—
cording to the following steps (Immerkaer, 1996):

(1) Calculate the noise matrix from the raw contact map.
Common knowledge in image processing is that the noise is usually
located in the high frequency region (Jin et al., 2011). Thus, we can
now use a high—pass mask to process each element in the predicted
contact map (i, j = 2,3,. . .,L — 1) to derive its noise matrix as:

1 —2 1
1 —2 1

where the symbol (9 is the convolution operation, meaning that each
element in the noise matrix is the weighted sum of neighboring elem-
ents of the given position in the raw contact map of CMraW, where
the weights are from the right mask in Equation 4.

(2) Estimate the standard deviation from the noise matrix. For
NM in Equation 4, we can calculate its standard deviation accord—
ing to:

L—z
viz/2: INM(z',i)I

i,i=1
: 5
6(L — 2)2 ( )
When we have an input CMraW, the straightforward idea of esti—
mating the expected optimized contact map CMexp is to re—calculate
the elements in CMraW. We use a weighted average form in this

study as:

mania/'0) = Z w(z',i)CM..W(zy/‘) <6)
(LDENPUOJO)

where NP is the set of neighboring pairs of the certain pair (i0, 1'0)
and W is the corresponding weights (each weight is non—negative and
the sum of all the weights is equal to 1). And now, our goal is to esti—
mate the weights of neighboring pairs in Equation 6, an optimiza-
tion problem to minimize the following error function:

error(i0,jo) = E(CMexp(i07j0) — CMnat(i0770))2 (7)

where E is the mathematical expectation. Then, we can decompose
Equation 7 with Equations 3 and 6 as:

err0r(i0,j0) : Z  _ CMnatUOaiOD
(LDENPUOJO)
‘l‘ 02 Z 
(LDENPUOJO)

(8)

Here, we define the variation of contact potential of residue pairs

(23/) and (16,70) as:
pit-0mm) = ICMn..(z',i) — CMnatan/‘oﬂ (9)

According to Equation 3, we can transfer CMnat to CMraw and
estimate the variation based on the distance between two patch win—
dows of the two residue pairs, which is formulated as:

p(i0,i0) (hi) 2 (V diSt — ﬂay

"P

Wp(m, n) :

This is a descending function, implying that distant pairs contribute
little to the variation. From the above description, we can see that
the weight W from Equation 6 is calculated according to the similar—
ity between two patch windows of residue pairs (i0, jo) and (i, j) ra—
ther than from the pairs themselves. Given Equations 8—11, by
applying the Lagrange multiplier method, we can derive the weight
w as:

W(i j) 2 (a _ P(io.io)(iai))+
, Z (a _ p(ioaio)(i=j))+

(12)

where a is an unique value that satisfies:

2 p(.-.,,-.)(z'.i)(a — p(.-.,,-.)(z'.i))+ = oz (13)
(LDENPUOJO)

Because Equation 13 is a strictly increasing function, and we sort
all the variation values for (i, j)ENP(i0, jo) in ascending order as
pl 3 pz 3  g plNPl, then the parameter a can be calculated as
follows:

illustrated in Figure 2.

3 Results

For inter—residue contact prediction, the commonly used perform—
ance measure is the accuracy for top US predicted contacts. Here, L
is the length of the test sequence. Top 5 and L/ 10 predicted contacts
are also evaluated. Accuracy is defined as the fraction of correctly
predicted contacts with respect to all the predicted contacts.

3.1 Query—driven fusion strategy

Ab initio prediction of residue contacts in proteins can be fulfilled ei-
ther by the ML—based or CMA—based methods. In recent years, some
elegant global CMA—based approaches (Ekeberg et al., 2013; Jones
et al., 2012; Kamisetty et al., 2013; Morcos et al., 2011) were pro—
posed that significantly improved residue contact prediction. By
observing the predictions from these two different methods, we can
see that the ML—based predictions yield better performance on
short—range contacts, and the CMA—based predictions are wide—
spread but perform better on long—range contacts. Obviously, these
two methods are complementary to each other (see Fig. 1). For
short—range residue contact prediction, we assigned a large weight to
the ML—based method; while for the prediction of long- range resi-
due contacts, a large weight was assigned to the CMA—based
approach.

From Table 1, we can see that the fusion of ML—based and
CMA—based methods can increase the prediction accuracy to a great
extent. The fusion strategy improves the prediction performance on
all ranges (short, medium and long), especially for long—range con—
tacts. For instance, when tested on CASP10 targets, the top L/5 pre—
diction accuracies of ML—based and CMA—based methods are
27.2% and 37.1%, respectively. When we combined these two dif—
ferent predictions, the prediction accuracy is increased to 42.6%.
Similar regularity can be observed on CASP11 targets, where the
prediction accuracy for top L/5 contacts is 35.5%, which is 13.3%
higher than that of the ML—based method and 6.1% higher than
that of the CMA—based method. We also tried to fuse the different
predictions with equal weight but found that this simple strategy did
not perform well as compared to the dynamic fusion strategy, espe—
cially for long—range residue contacts (see Table 1). Figure 3 shows

ML—based and CMA—based methods. These results demonstrate that
the proposed query—driven fusion model is more effective than the
two distinctive methods and is better than other global fusion
method such as with equal weights.

3.2 Performance on CASP10 dataset

As described above, the combination of ML—based and CMA—based
methods can indeed improve prediction accuracy. After this step, we
designed a 2D Gaussian noise filter to further enhance the prediction
performance. It takes both local and non—local information into con-
sideration to optimize the contact potential. As shown in Table 1,
the noise filter contributes an improvement of 2.2% in overall accur—
acy for the top L/5 long—range contact prediction on the CASP10
dataset. It seems that the noise filter does not work as well on short-
range contacts and does not perform better on medium—range con—
tacts when compared to long—range contacts. The reason may be
that the weight W in Equation 6 is calculated according to the simi—
larity between two patch windows of the two residue pairs rather
than by the two pairs themselves. Because the contact map is sym—
metric when we optimize the contact potential of short—range con—
tacts, some residue pairs will occur in the corresponding patch
window repeatedly, weakening the similarity measurement.

Table 2 shows the prediction performance on 35 CASP10 hard
targets. Again, the dynamic fusion strategy increases the prediction
performance and the noise filter works better on long—range contact
prediction as expected. For the top US predicted contacts, the pre—
diction accuracy is increased 1.8% for the long—range contacts with
the help of noise filter. Figure 4a presents a scatter plot of the overall
prediction accuracy without noise filter versus with noise filter. As
can be seen, most of targets are better predicted after applying the
noise filter. The experimental data show that our RZC contact pre—
dictor can visibly improve long—range residue contact prediction.

3.3 Performance on CASP11 dataset

We also evaluated our RZC predictor on the CASP11 dataset, which
contains 103 targets with more than 50 residues. The number of
hard targets in this dataset is 48, which is more than that of the
CASP10 dataset. Thus, as can be seen from Table 1, the overall pre-
diction performance on CASP11 dataset is not better than CASP10
dataset. However, the proposed method is still valid for improving
long—range residue contact prediction. For instance, the prediction
accuracy of the combined method (the first stage of RZC) is 13.3%
and 6.1% higher than that of ML—based and CMA—based method,
respectively in the case of top L/5 long—range contact prediction. For
all ranges, the performance is improved, particularly for long-range
contacts. Also, the Gaussian noise filter is helpful for improving the

prediction performance on long—range contacts, which increases the
prediction accuracy from 35 .5 to 37.6%.

The contact prediction performance for the 48 hard targets is
listed in Table 2. Hard targets are difficult to predict due to the rare
homologous information. Despite this, the proposed noise filter can
further improve the prediction performance for long—range contacts.
The accuracy improvement can be as much as 2.9%. Figure 4b also
plots the overall prediction accuracy of top L/5 long—range contact
prediction without noise filter versus with noise filter. Obviously,
the performance of most targets is improved. These results demon—
strate that the proposed RZC contact predictor can effectively im—
prove the prediction of long—range contacts.

Our RZC predictor has also participated in CASP11 RR group
competition, which was named as ‘Shen—Group’ (G124). From the
official assessment paper (Monastyrskyy et al., 2015), we can see
that RZC performs well on the FM targets in RL (reduced list) mode
(ranked the 2nd position in terms of precision). In addition, by

comparing the submitted results on the CASP11 site, RZC is found
outperforming MetaPSICOV (ranked the 1st in CASP11) (Jones
et al., 2015) on 20 targets for the top US predicted long—range con—
tacts, where with 10% higher accuracy on 15 targets
(Supplementary Table S1). These results indicate that different
methods have their own advantages on different targets and the
combination of them can further enhance the prediction perform-
ance (see Section 4).

3.4 Is the new Gaussian noise mode the same as
traditional transitive noise?

The Gaussian noise filter on long—range residue contact prediction
has been proven to be useful in the above section. Here, we further
evaluate the noise filter on different methods including meCA
(Morcos et al., 2011), PSICOV (Jones et al., 2012), CCMpred
(Seemayer et al., 2014) and MetaPSICOV (Jones et al., 2015). All of
these methods are recently developed contact map predictors with
efficient traditional transitive noise filters. We used the same 150
Pfam families as previous studies (Jones et al., 2012) to explain the
efficacy of the noise filter. The target predictions of the four differ-
ent algorithms were downloaded from http://bioinfadmin.cs.ucl.ac.
uk/downloads/MetaPSICOV/. Among these four prediction algo—
rithms, the first three are CMA—based approaches and the last is a
ML—based method that incorporates the predictions from CMA-
based approaches as the input features. Since the public predictions
list contact pairs, contact probabilities and true labels for all the resi—
due pairs of a test protein, we can optimize the raw contact map and
then reassess the performance. We only list the prediction results for
top L/ 10, US and L/2 on long—range contacts.

From Table 3, we can see that the new noise filter is valid for all
the methods except for the predictions from the second stage of
MetaPSICOV, which used the temporal neighboring contact infor-
mation in an iterative way. The overall prediction accuracy is very
high for the 150 proteins because there are sufficient homologies in
MSA. Due to the new noise filter, the overall prediction accuracy is
increased by ~2%. Interestingly, for the top L/2 predictions, the ac—
curacy improvement is 3.7 and 3.6% over PSICOV and CCMpred,
respectively. However, the improvement is not outstanding on the
ML—based method MetaPSICOV. For the predictions from the first
stage, the improvement is ~1% while there is no improvement for
the second stage. As can be seen from Supplementary Figure S1,
noise from the CMA—based predictions is approximately distributed
as a Gaussian function while the noise from ML—based predictions is
not and the standard deviation is very small. Thus, for the ML—based
methods, the Gaussian noise filter did not work well.

In order to known how the Gaussian noise filter improves the
prediction performance, we quantitatively calculated 4 values
for each target of 150 proteins after applying the noise filter on

CMA—based outputs, i.e. newly introduced false positives (+FP),
reduced original false positives (—FP), newly introduced true posi—
tives (—I—TP) and reduced original true positives (—TP). Supplementary
Table S2 lists the detailed results on the top L/2 predicted long—range
contacts. For PSICOV predictions, the noise filter excluded 289 true
contacts from the top lists in total, i.e. ‘—TP’ is 289. However, 672
true contacts are newly introduced, i.e. ‘—I—TP’ is 672, which makes
the overall accuracy improve 3.7%. For the outputs of CCMpred,
the ‘-TP’ is 841 and the ‘—I—TP’ is 1211. The 370 added true contacts
increase 3.6% overall prediction accuracy. In the case of meCA
predictions, the ‘—TP’ and ‘—I—TP’ is 801 and 976, respectively,
the extra 175 true contacts result in a 1.7% accuracy improvement.
Supplementary Figures S2—S4 elucidate the detailed results by taking
the protein 1jyhA as an instance, as can be seen from which, the de—
signed Gaussian noise filter significantly improves the
accuracies for all 3 CMA—based prediction approaches: 57.7% —>
76.9%, 34.6% —> 51.3% and 59.0% —> 82.1% for meCA,
PSICOV and CCMpred, respectively.

We also conducted a statistic t—test between the top predictions be—
fore and after applying the Gaussian noise filter. As shown in Table 3,
in general (except the 2nd stage of MetaPSICOV), the improvements
caused by the noise filter are statistically meaningful with
a P—value < 0.05. These results indicate that the Gaussian noise filter is
effective at improving long—range residue contact prediction due to this
type of noise is indeed different from transitive noise, which is buried
in the predicted raw data and weakens the prediction performance.

4 Discussions

Residue contact prediction has been widely acknowledged to be
helpful in protein 3D structure modeling. There are three types of
contacts, i.e. short—, medium— and long—range, of which long-range
contacts are most important because they can enforce strong re-
straints to structure assembly. Recently, some elegant global algo—
rithms, such as, meCA (Morcos et al., 2011), PSICOV (Jones et al.,
2012), plmDCA (Ekeberg et al., 2013) and GREMLIN (Kamisetty
et al., 2013) were proposed to improve the prediction of long-range
contacts via sufficient homologies, doing so with transitive noise fil-
ters. However, for hard targets in the CASP competition, there are
no sufficient homologous sequences available. Therefore, contact
prediction for hard targets based only on the CMA—based approach
is not a promising way. As we know, the ML—based method predicts
test samples according to knowledge learned from training samples,
which is not highly dependent on homologous information. The
combination of these two different methods can relieve this prob—
lem. In this study, we fused the predictions from the ML—based and
the CMA—based methods in the decision level. The fusion strategy is
a query—driven dynamic combination scheme where the weight relies

on the contact types and the number of effective sequences in the
MSA. By doing so, the prediction performance was improved on all
ranges, especially for long—range contacts.

The predicted contact map always contains noise that decreases
the prediction accuracy. The existing aforementioned CMA—based
approaches focus on reducing transitive noise, like meCA (Morcos
et al., 2011) and PSICOV (Jones et al., 2012) etc. To the best of our
knowledge, there is no method that tries to discover other types of
noise. In this study, we have shown that Gaussian noise is also an im—
portant mode that needs to be carefully considered to improve residue
contact prediction. We assume that the noise in the predicted contact
map is the additive Gaussian white noise. The key idea of reducing
noise is the average weighted sum of contact potentials of neighboring
residue pairs, and the weight is calculated according to the similarity
of two patch windows rather than the two residue pairs themselves.
The Gaussian noise filter is found valuable for long—range contact pre—
diction on hard targets as tested on recent two CASP datasets, where
the prediction performance improvement is a bottleneck on this type
of hard targets (Kosciolek and Jones, 2015; Monastyrskyy et al.,
2015 ). For instance, for CASP10 FM targets, the average accuracy of
25 participated groups on long—range contacts is only 12.4%; while
this number is as low as 12.3% for CASP11 FM targets, when aver—
aged according to the outputs of 29 involved groups. These results in—
dicate that improving long—range contact prediction accuracy is one of
the most challenging tasks. Our current work provides a post—process—
ing noise filter to improve the prediction performance, at no cost of
updating the prediction algorithms.

However, we can also see that the noise filter did not work well on
several targets. For these, we found that the standard deviation in
Equation 5 could be better estimated. When we changed the estimated
value, the performance decrease would be relieved, and their prediction
accuracy would be enhanced (data not shown). This indicates that the
estimated standard deviation is an important factor of our proposed
Gaussian noise filter. In the future work, we will focus on accurately
calculating the standard deviation of the residue contact map.

The other future direction of us is figuring out how to effectively
use the merits of existing state—of—the—art predictors to further improve
the protein residue network predictions. In CASP11 competition,
MetaPSICOV and RZC were ranked as the top two best predictors in
terms of precision for the top L/5 long—range contact prediction. By
comparing the two predictors, we found that their performance varies
on different targets. For instance, there are 20 CASP11 targets on
which RZC are better than MetaPSICOV (Supplementary Table S1),
indicating that a proper consensus system of RZC and MetaPSICOV
is a promising way for further enhancement. To demonstrate this, we
simply linearly combined these two predictors, and 2.4 and 1.5% ac—
curacy improvements of long—range contact prediction can be gained
over MetaPSICOV for hard targets in CASP10 and CASP11, respect—
ively. These preliminary results show that because of the specific fea—
tures of each protein, a single global model could not be suitable for
everyone, which calls for a new fusion protocol among different state—
of—the—art residue—residue contact predictors that can take the specific
features of each query sequence into account.

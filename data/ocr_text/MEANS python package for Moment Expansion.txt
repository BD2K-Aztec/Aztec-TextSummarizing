Abstract

Motivation: Many biochemical systems require stochastic descriptions. Unfortunately these can
only be solved for the simplest cases and their direct simulation can become prohibitively expen—
sive, precluding thorough analysis. As an alternative, moment closure approximation methods
generate equations for the time—evolution of the system’s moments and apply a closure ansatz to
obtain a closed set of differential equations; that can become the basis for the deterministic ana—
lysis of the moments of the outputs of stochastic systems.

Results: We present a free, user—friendly tool implementing an efficient moment expansion ap—
proximation with parametric closures that integrates well with the IPython interactive environment.
Our package enables the analysis of complex stochastic systems without any constraints on the
number of species and moments studied and the type of rate laws in the system. In addition to the
approximation method our package provides numerous tools to help non—expert users in stochas—

tic analysis.

1 Introduction

Inherent stochasticity of elementary reactions affects many biochem—
ical processes. Analytic solutions of stochastic systems are rarely
available and simulations (Gillespie, 1977) can come with high com-
putational costs making the study of such systems implausible.
Numerous approximation methods have been developed recently
to lighten the burden. A popular approach is to approximate the
whole system by following the moments of the temporally evolving
probability distribution, such as in the Moment Expansion
Approximation (MEA) (Ale et al., 2013). However, for nonlinear
systems the equation set arising from such methods is in principle in-
finite. Moment closure formulae address this problem by offering a
substitute expression of moments over a certain order, based on

information contained in the remaining moments and prior assump—
tions on the system (Gillespie, 2009). For a more detailed literature
review on this technique see Lakatos et al. (2015).

Here we present MEANS, a Python package for Moment
Expansion Approximation, iNference and Simulation. Many exist—
ing packages with a similar function restrict the calculation to poly—
nomial reaction rates; besides, an analysis based on them might
require expensive softwares or computational skills not generally
available to all potential users (Azunre et al., 2011; Schnoerr et al.,
2015; see also http://www.ece.ucsb.edu/hespanha). Our package on
the other hand, provides an automated moment equation generation
method, suitable for arbitrary rate laws; together with the choice
of distribution—based closure formulae, including a multivariate

gamma not available in other packages. Furthermore, the package is
complemented with an implementation of exact stochastic simula—
tion, as well as support for different ODE solvers and sensitivity
analysis, a parameter estimation tool and specific functions for the
visualization of results.

2 Approach

For a thorough description of the moment expansion and closure al—
gorithms we refer the user to Ale et al. (2013) and Lakatos et al.
(2015 ). In brief, given a stochastic system of N species by its stoichi—
ometry matrix (S) and reaction propensities (a), the evolution of the
species’ probability distribution P(x, t) is described in terms of its
moments, which can be evaluated through its moment generating
function (wrt 0),

The expressions thus obtained are then evaluated through two
subsequent Taylor expansions. Two steps are used to derive a closed
ODE system: first, for an approximation based on mth order mo—
ments, the expansion is stopped at order (m —I— 1); then moment clos—
ure formulae (mck) are used to substitute the highest order terms
with expressions of means (a) and (co)variances ()2)

3 Methods

MEANS is a Python package, primarily developed to be used inter—
actively in the IPython/Jupyter notebook framework. Pre—requisites
and installation instructions are listed in the accompanying documen—
tation. MEANS enables the definition and exact simulation of sto—
chastic models; moment—based approximations for arbitrary
stochastic system and closure order; numerical solution, sensitivity
analysis and parameter inference of ODE systems generated by the
approximation or defined by the user; and customizable visualization
for the output. Detailed tutorial notebooks demonstrating the func—
tionalities of the package are available from the tutorial directory.

Input: The stochastic system can be supplied by manual input of
a symbolic representation of the variables and reactions, all sup—
ported by the SymPy library (SymPy Development Team, 2014); this
is then converted into a specific model object. There is also a parser
enabling model definition from SBML-files. Furthermore, four pre-
defined models are available from the examples package. Our pack—
age also offers a set of routines for serialization and deserialization
of the MEANS—specific objects to and from files, therefore previ-
ously defined models are easily saved and loaded.

Approximation and closure: The MEA method can be called
through the mea_approximation function, which requires two argu-
ments: a MEANS model object and the closure order. The default
closure method is scalar (truncation); distribution—based methods
can be used by setting the closure argument of the function. MEANS
supports normal, lognormal and gamma closures, the latter based
on a new definition of multivariate gamma distribution designed to
fit general biochemical networks (Lakatos et al., 2015). When uni—
variate distributions are desired, the parameter multivariate = False
can be passed to the closure function. We can also generate
Linear Noise Approximation expressions by calling the function
lna_approximation where the model is the single argument.

Simulation: MEANS uses Assimulo (Andersson et al., 2015) as
the ODE solver back—end, and supports all solvers and settings im—
plemented in that package, which can be accessed via the optional
argument solver. The default value is ode15s, which corresponds to
the MATLAB function with the same name. The simulation returns
a collection of Trajectory objects, each containing a list of time—
points, values and a description of the moment. Stochastic systems
can be also directly simulated in MEANS by providing the model
and the number of simulations as input.

Furthermore, parameter sensitivities can be computed while per—
forming the ODE simulations using the built—in support of CVODE
solvers (Hindmarsh et al., 2005). Sensitivity analysis returns a collec—
tion of trajectory objects with additional .sensitivity_data attribute.

Inference: Parameter estimation is also available in MEANS; for
this function the observed data can be entered manually or read
from a file; and then converted into a Trajectory object with appro—
priate descriptors so that means and higher moments can be
matched. Variable parameters are defined by a dictionary of the
symbolic names and corresponding ranges of allowed values; range
None indicates unbounded parameters, and all unspecified param—
eters are assumed constant. Starting values for the parameters can
be user—defined or generated automatically by optimizing runs from
random starting positions sampled from a defined range; we advise
the latter to lower the chance of finding local minima.

Visualization: Trajectory objects can be visualized in the note—
book, see Figure 1(a). A customizable .plot() method allows the use
of all options of the standard matplotlib plot function. Sensitivity
behaviour can be illustrated using .plot_perturbations(), which visu-
alizes the result of perturbing a single parameter with a specified
delta value, Figure 1(b). Inferred trajectories can also be visualized
using the result object’s .plot() method, cf. Figure 1(c). MEANS also

4 Summary

We present MEANS, a Python package, for the approximation of
the time—evolution of stochastic biochemical networks using mo—
ment expansion with moment closure formulae based on multivari—
ate normal, lognormal and newly defined gamma distributions.
Besides the derivation of moment equations, MEANS also offers
several methods to simulate stochastic models, as well as tools for
sensitivity analysis and parameter inference.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Unexpected drug activities derived from off-targets
are usually undesired and harmful; however, they can occasionally
be beneficial for different therapeutic indications. There are many
uncharacterized drugs whose target proteins (including the primary
target and off-targets) remain unknown. The identification of all
potential drug targets has become an important issue in drug
repositioning to reuse known drugs for new therapeutic indications.
Results: We defined pharmacological similarity for all possible
drugs using the US Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) adverse
event reporting system (AERS) and developed a new method to
predict unknown drug—target interactions on a large scale from
the integration of pharmacological similarity of drugs and genomic
sequence similarity of target proteins in the framework of a
pharmacogenomic approach. The proposed method was applicable
to a large number of drugs and it was useful especially for predicting
unknown drug—target interactions that could not be expected from
drug chemical structures. We made a comprehensive prediction for
potential off-targets of 1874 drugs with known targets and potential
target profiles of 2519 drugs without known targets, which suggests
many potential drug—target interactions that were not predicted by
previous chemogenomic or pharmacogenomic approaches.

1 INTRODUCTION

Most drugs are molecules that interact and interfere with an
appropriate protein target implicated in a disease of interest. Drugs
may also interact with additional proteins (off—targets hereafter) that
are not their primary therapeutic targets, resulting in unexpected
side effects. Drug side effects are complex phenomena attributed to
many molecular scenarios (e.g. metabolism disorder, downstream
pathway perturbations), among which the interaction with off—target
proteins is the most important cause (Blagg, 2006; Whitebread
et al., 2005). Unexpected drug activities derived from off—targets are
usually undesired and harmful; however, they can occasionally be
beneﬁcial and lead to different therapeutic indications. For example,
sildenaﬁl (Viagra) was developed to treat angina, but it is now used
for the treatment of erectile dysfunction.

There are many drugs whose target proteins (including the
primary target and off—targets) have not yet been characterized. The
identiﬁcation of all potential targets for a given drug has become an
important issue in drug repositioning to reuse known drugs for new
therapeutic indications. Experimental testing to identify drug—target
interactions is a very expensive and time—consuming process, and
thus there is a strong incentive to develop new in silico prediction
methods, which will enable to limit experimental testing.

In recent years, the ﬁeld of chemogenomics has rapidly gained
importance, primarily exploring the relationship between the
chemical space of possible compounds and the genomic space of
possible proteins (Dobson, 2004; Kanehisa et al., 2006; Stockwell,
2000). A variety of in silico chemogenomic methods have been
developed to predict drug—target or compound—protein interactions
on a genome—wide scale (Bleakley and Yamanishi, 2009; Faulon
et al., 2008; Jacob and Vert, 2008; Keiser et al., 2009; van Laarhoven
et al., 2011; Yamanishi et al., 2008). The underlying idea is that
similar ligands are likely to interact with similar proteins, and
prediction is performed based on chemical structures of ligand
compounds, protein sequences of targets and the currently known
compound—protein interactions.

Another promising approach is to use pharmacological
information such as drug side effects and adverse drug reactions.
The use of side effect similarity has been recently proposed to
infer whether two drugs share a target (Campillos et al., 2008).
This method requires drug package inserts that describe the detailed
side effect information, so it is applicable only to marketed drugs
for which side effect information is provided. To overcome this
limitation, several methods have been proposed to predict unknown
side effects from chemical structures (Atias and Sharan, 2011;
Yamanishi et al., 2010). These methods are useful when chemical
structures and side effects are correlated with each other to some
extent; however, there are still some drug—target interactions that
cannot be explained or predicted using these methods.

Recently, the adverse event reporting system (AERS) in the
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been gaining a
lot of attentions for computational applications of pharmaceutical
analyses. AERS is a spontaneous reporting system that routinely
collects adverse drug event reports from patients, clinicians and
pharmaceutical companies in order to support the FDA’s post—
marketing safety surveillance program for all approved drugs and
biological products. One of the advantages of using AERS over
package inserts is that the users need not wait for the sufﬁcient
amount of adverse effect incidents to occur in order to be written
on the package inserts. An algorithm has been developed to
identify hidden drug—drug interactions (DDIs) in adverse event

reports (Tatonetti et al., 2012), and the same authors detected DDIs
between paroxetine and pravastatin which increases blood glucose
levels (Tatonetti et al., 2011). A data—mining technique has been
used to analyze adverse event proﬁles of platinum agents, and it
was observed that acute renal failure was also more predominant
forcisplatin, and carboplatin did not increase the blood level of
creatinine (Sakaeda et al., 2011). These previous works highlight
the usefulness of AERS for pharmaceutical and clinical research.

In this article, we propose pharmacological similarity for all
possible drugs using AERS and develop a new method to predict
unknown drug—target interactions on a large scale from the
integration of pharmacological similarity of drugs and genomic
sequence similarity of target proteins in the framework of a
pharmacogenomic approach. The advantages of using the AERS—
based pharmacological similarity stem from the availability of
information for a much larger number of drugs, compared with
the other more speciﬁc resources (e. g. SIDER and JAPIC) used in
the previous works, and unexpected drug targets can be identiﬁed
only through safety surveillance program and adverse drug events
reported in the post—marketing study practice. In the results, we
predict drug—target interactions involved in many protein families,
and show the usefulness of our proposed method for predicting
unknown drug—target interactions which cannot be expected from
analyzing drug chemical structures. To our knowledge, this is the
ﬁrst report to predict drug targets using AERS. A comprehensive
prediction of drug—target interaction networks enables us to suggest
new potential drug—target interactions.

2 MATERIALS

2.1 Pharmacological data

2.1.] AERS Side effect keywords (adverse event keywords) for
drugs were retrieved from the public release of the adverse
event reporting system (AERS) database in the US FDA
[http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatory
Information/Surveillance/AdverseDrugEffects/default.htm] . We
derived 2 904 050 reports containing 291 997 drugs from the period
of 2004—2010. Every adverse event report was given an ID (referred
to as ISR), and various aspects of the report were stored in several
ﬁles separately. For example, the ﬁle named as REAnyQq.TXT
stores the names of side effects in the reports, and DRUnyQq.TXT
stores the drug/biologic information of the medications, where yy
and q mean the year and the quarter, respectively (e. g. yy: 10 and
q = 3 if the ﬁle contains the data from the third quarter of 2010). In
the ﬁle DRUnyQq.TXT, the suspect drugs for the adverse events
were classiﬁed into the four categories: primary suspect drug (PS),
secondary suspect drug (SS), concomitant (C) and interacting (I). In
this study, we used the drugs (compound names or product names)
labeled as PS or SS and searched the equivalent drugs registered
in the KEGG DRUG database. From the ﬁle REAnyQq.TXT,
frequency of the keywords were deﬁned as the number of reports
(corresponding to the ISR IDs) containing the keyword divided
by the number of all reports, and the keywords that appear too
frequently (> 0.001) or too rarely (the number of reports were
< 5) were removed. The remaining keywords was linked with the
KEGG DRUG IDs (also referred to as D numbers). As the result,
we obtained the dataset containing 5477 drugs, 11047 side effect
keywords and 1 481 256 associations between them.

We constructed two types of pharmacological proﬁles for drugs
based on the frequency information of side effect keywords in
adverse event reports and the binary information (presence or
absence) in adverse event reports. We refer to them as AERS—
freq and AERS—bit, repsectively, in this study. First, each drug
is represented by a real—valued proﬁle xaersfreq =(x1,x2,--- ,xK)T
where a side effect keyword is coded its frequency in adverse event
reports, respectively, across the K = 11047 keywords. Second, each
drug is represented by a binary proﬁle xaersbit=(x1,x2,w ,xK)T
where a side effect keyword is coded 1 or 0, respectively, across the
K = 11,047 side effect keywords.

2.1.2 SIDER Side effect keywords for drugs were obtained from
the SIDER database [http://sideeffects.embl.de/] which contains
information about marketed medicines and their recorded side
effects or adverse drug reactions (Kuhn et al., 2010). Each drug
is represented by a binary proﬁle xSl-der =(x1,x2, --- ,xK)T in which
a side effect keyword is coded 1 or 0, respectively, across about the
K = 1385 side effect keywords.

2.1.3 JAPIC Side effect keywords for drugs (pharmaceutical
molecules) were obtained from the Japan Pharmaceutical
Information Center (JAPIC) database [http://www.japic.or.jp/].
J APIC manages all package insert information of pharmaceutical
products in Japan, under the approval of Health and Welfare Minister
of Japan.

We collected 16 853 side effect keywords with XML tags
associated with unwanted characteristics of drugs (e. g. side effect,
adverse event, caution and warning). Each drug is represented by
a binary proﬁle xjapiC=(x1,x2,-~,xK)T in which a side effect
keyword is coded 1 or 0, respectively, across about the K: 16853
side effect keywords.

2.1.4 Relationship between diﬂerent resources Drug identiﬁers
are different between AERS, SIDER and JAPIC, which makes it
difﬁcult to make a comparison. Therefore, we mapped all possible
drugs in the different databases onto the KEGG DRUG database
(Kanehisa et al., 2008) based on drug names and product names in
order to use unique identiﬁers for the same drugs. The left panel in
Figure 1 shows Venn—diagram of all drugs in KEGG across AERS,
SIDER and J APIC, where 3024 drugs are not assigned any side effect
information in AERS, SIDER or JAPIC. The number of drugs with
pharmacological information in AERS is much larger than those in
SIDER and JAPIC.

2.2 Drug—target interaction data

The information about drug—target interactions was obtained from
the KEGG DRUG database (Kanehisa et al., 2008). KEGG DRUG
includes only the drug—target interactions that are veriﬁed well in
wet experiments and explained sufﬁciently in the literature. We did
not use drugs whose molecular weights were <100 in this study.
In our dataset, there are 6769 drug—target interactions consisting of
2423 drugs and 436 target proteins.

The right panel in Figure 1 shows Venn diagram of drugs with
target information in KEGG DRUG and with pharmacological
information in AERS, SIDER and JAPIC, where 2423 drugs out
of 7572 total drugs in KEGG DRUG have target information and
the other 5149 drugs do not have any target information. The 2423
drugs, i.e. the all drugs with target information were referred to as

‘all drugs—associated interaction data’ in this study. The number of
drugs with target information in AERS is much larger than those
in SIDER and JAPIC. There are 359 drugs that are common across
AERS, SIDER and JAPIC and have target information in KEGG
DRUG which is referred to as ‘common drugs—associated interaction
data’ in this study. The corresponding drug—target interaction data
consist of 1188 drug—target interactions, 359 common drugs and 226
target proteins.

2.3 Chemical structures and protein sequences

Chemical structures of drugs were obtained from the KEGG DRUG
database (Kanehisa et al., 2008). We computed the chemical
structure similarities between two drugs x and x’ using the graph
kernel (Mahe et al., 2005). The similarity score is denoted as
schem (x, x’) and referred to as ‘chemical similarity’ in this study.

Amino acid sequences of proteins coded in the human genome
were obtained from the KEGG GENES database (Kanehisa et al.,
2008). We computed the sequence similarities between two proteins
y and y’ using the local alignment kernel (Saigo et al., 2004). The
similarity score is denoted as sgeno (y, y’ ) and referred to as ‘genomic
sequence similarity’ in this study.

3 METHODS

3.1 Pharmacological similarity
Suppose that each drug is represented by a pharmacological proﬁle
x = (x1 ,x2, - - - ,xK)T, where K is the number of side effect keywords.
The pharmacological similarity between two drugs x and x’ is
evaluated by the weighted cosine correlation coefﬁcient between
the above proﬁles as
Z§=1kakxfC

K K ’
\/Zk=1wkx/%\/Zk=1wkx;(2
where wk is the weight function for the kth keyword deﬁned as

wkzexp(—d,§/azh2), k=1,2,---,K

 

(1)

I
Sphar(XaX )2

 

where dk is the frequency of the kth keyword in the data, and K is
the total number of keywords in the data, a is the mean of {cl/($21
and h is a parameter (set to 1 in this study). The weight function
is introduced to put more emphasis on infrequent keywords rather
than frequent keywords, because rare keywords (e. g. agnosia, variant
angina, aspergillosis and gouty arthritis) are more informative than
common keywords (e.g. nausea, dizziness, vomiting and rash) in

terms of phenotypic characteristics of drugs. The similarity score is
referred to as ‘pharmacological similarity’ in this study.

The pharmacological similarity functions for drug side effect
proﬁles based on AERS—freq, AERS—bit, SIDER and JAPIC are
denoted by Saersfreq, saersbit, ssider and sjapic, respectively.

3.2 Pairwise kernel regression

Let us now consider the situation where we have a set of drugs
X={x1,--- ,xnx}, a set of target proteins y={y1,--- ,yny}, a set of
known drug—target interaction pairs E T and a set of drug—target
pairs whose interactions are unknown E T , where nx is the number of
drugs and ny is the number of target proteins in E T UE‘. Given any
drug—target pair (x, y), we want to predict how likely an interaction
exists between the drug x and the target protein y.

We propose a pairwise kernel regression (PKR) model for a pair
(x,y) as

71x "y

z=f(x,y)+e=ZZﬂljk((xsyj>.(x,y»+e. (2)

i=1j=1

where (xi,yj) is a drug—target pair in E T UET, f is the projection
f: X x y—> R, 6,]- is a weight element, k(-, -) is a kernel similarity
function for drug—target pairs and 6 is a noise term. High—scoring
drug—target pairs in f (x, y) are predicted to be interaction pairs.

Let us deﬁne kx(-, -) as a kernel similarity function for drugs and
ky(-, -) as a kernel similarity function for target proteins. Using the
following property of the tensor product kernel, the pairwise kernel
k can be represented by the product of kernel kx and kernel ky as
follows:

k((X7 Y), (X, 7  : kX(X7  
Then, the PKR model can be represented by

f(x,y>=ZZ/aijk((x7,yj).(x,y)) (3)
i=1j=1
=ZZﬂijkx(xl-,x>ky(yj,y>. (4)

i=1j=1

This operation enables us to avoid working on the pairwise space,
otherwise computational cost in the pairwise space is prohibitive.

For the training set of drug—target pairs (xi,yj) (i = 1, - -- ,nx , j =
1,  ,ny), we propose to set zlj as follows:

Z.._ IE+UE—I/IE+I if(Xi,yJ-)€E+ (5)
’1‘ —IE+UE—I/IE—I if(Xi,yj)€E—.
For the test set of drug—target pairs (to be predicted), we set zlj to 0 in

the initial stage of the learning process. The ﬁtting of the model can
be done by ﬁnding ,8,:,- that minimizes the following loss function:

LZZZ(Zij—f(xian))2= llZ—KxBKylllzc (6)
i=1 j=1
=trace{(Z—KxBKy)(Z—KxBKy)T}, (7)

where Kx is an nx >< nx kernel similarity matrix (Kx)lj =kx(xi,xj),
Ky is an ny X ny kernel similarity matrix (Ky)l-j =ky (yi,yj) and Z and
B are matrices deﬁned as (Z)l-j =zij and (B),:,- =,8,:,-(i= 1,2, - -- ,nx,j=
1 2  n ).

Taking the differential of L with respect to B and setting it to zero,
the weight matrix B can be analytically obtained by solving

B=Kx_1ZKy_1. (8)

Once we have trained our model, which is computing B, we can
apply the model to unseen object pairs (drug—target pairs in this
case). We can introduce a regularization by applying the singular
value decomposition to Z as Z N Uqu VqT , where Dq is a diagonal
matrix of q singular values, and Uq and Vq are matrices of singular
vectors associated with the q singular values. In this case, the weight
matrix B can be obtained by solving B=Kx_1UquVqTKy_1.

3.3 Predictive models for drug—target interactions

We consider ﬁve approaches as follows:

0 AERS—freq—based pharmacogenomic approach (AERS—freq):
The prediction is performed based on AERS—freq—based
pharmacological similarity Saersfreq and sequence similarity

Sgeno-

0 AERS—bit—based pharmacogenomic approach (AERS—bit):
The prediction is performed based on AERS—bit—based
pharmacological similarity saersbit and sequence similarity

Sgeno-

0 SIDER—based pharmacogenomic approach (SIDER):
The prediction is performed based on SIDER—based
pharmacological similarity ssider and sequence similarity

Sgeno-

0 JAPIC—based pharmacogenomic approach (JAPIC):
The prediction is performed based on JAPIC—based
pharmacological similarity sjapiC and sequence similarity

Sgeno-

0 Chemogenomic approach (CHEM): The prediction is
performed based on chemical similarity schem and sequence
similarity sgeno.

To investigate the effect of data integration, we also consider two
integrative approaches as follows:

0 Integrated pharmacogenomic approach (INTEG—P):
The prediction is performed based on the integrated
pharmacological similarity Saersfreq—I—Ssider—I—Sjapic and
sequence similarity sgeno.

0 Integrated pharmaco—chemogenomic approach (INTEG—PC):
The prediction is performed based on the integrated similarity
Saersfreq —l— ssider —l— sjapiC —l—sC}lem and sequence similarity sgeno.

3.4 Experimental protocol

There are mainly two practical situations for drug target
identiﬁcation. The ﬁrst situation is that the drug has at least one
known target protein and we want to detect unknown additional
target proteins (e. g. off—targets) of the drug. The second situation
is that the drug has no known target and we want to predict all the
potential target proteins of the drug. From the viewpoint of the above
two practical situations, we perform two types of cross—validations:
pair—wise cross—validation and block—wise cross—validation.

In the pair—wise cross—validation we performed the following
3—fold cross—validation. (i) We randomly split drug—target pairs in
the gold standard data into three subsets of roughly equal sizes by
pair. (ii) We took each subset as a test set and the remaining two
subsets as a training set. (iii) We trained a predictive model on the
training set. (iv) We computed the prediction scores for drug—target
pairs in the test set. (v) Finally, we evaluated the prediction accuracy
over the 3—folds.

In the block—wise cross—validation we performed the following
3—fold cross—validation. (i) We randomly split drugs in the gold
standard data into three drug subsets. (ii) We took each drug
subset, and constructed a test set of drug—target pairs from the drug
subset and all targets and a training set of drug—target pairs from
the remaining two drug subsets and all targets. (iii) We trained a
predictive model on the training set. (iv) We computed the prediction
scores for drug—target pairs in the test set. (v) Finally, we evaluated
the prediction accuracy over the 3—folds. Note that only drugs are
split into a training set and a test set, and targets are common across
training set and test set.

There are many drugs that were optimized from the same drug
lead, so these drugs are chemically and structurally similar to each
other. If these drugs were split into a training set and a test set in
the cross—validation, the target prediction would be very easy, which
would overestimate the prediction accuracy. To avoid such a trivial
prediction, we proposed a clustering of drugs based on their chemical
structures and used only representative drugs which are chemically
diverse. First, we performed a hierarchical clustering of all drugs in
the gold standard data based on their chemical structure similarity
scores using single linkage algorithm. Second, we grouped drugs
whose chemical structure similarity is greater than a threshold into
the same cluster, and we randomly selected only one drug from
each cluster. Third, we constructed a set of representative drugs
whose chemical structure similarities were less than a threshold.
Finally, we prepared several benchmark datasets consisting of only
representative drugs by varying the threshold from 0.1 to 1 by 0.1
increments on the hierarchical clustering tree and used them to
examine the effect of the threshold on prediction performance.

4 RESULTS

4.1 Performance evaluation

We tested seven methods: AERS—freq, AERS—bit, SIDER, JAPIC,
CHEM, INTEG—P and INTEG—PC on their abilities to predict
drug—target interactions by performing two types of 3—fold cross—
validations (see Section 3.4 for more details). We used two gold
standard datasets: ‘common drugs—associated interaction data’ and
‘all drugs—associated interaction data’ (see the Section 2). For drugs
with no available data in each method, we set the missing elements
in the corresponding drug kernel similarity matrix to zero.

We evaluated the method performance via the receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curve, which is a plot of true positives as
a function of false positives based on various thresholds, where
true positives are correctly predicted interactions and false positives
are predicted interactions that are not present in the gold standard
interactions. We summarized the performance by an area under the
ROC curve (AUC) score, where 1 is for a perfect inference and 0.5
is for a random inference. The parameters involved in each method
were optimized with the AUC score as the objective function. To

obtain a robust result, we repeated the cross—validation experiment
ﬁve times and computed the average and standard deviation (SD) of
the AUC scores over the ﬁve repetitions.

Table 1 shows the AUC scores by the pair—wise cross—validation,
where the SD values are not shown in the table for easier readability,

because most SD values are <0.01. As shown in the upper half
of Table 1, the pharmacogenomic approach worked better than
the chemogenomic approach for the common drug—associated
interaction data. Among the four pharmacological similarities,
AERS—bit worked the best in the case of low chemical similarity

thresholds, and J APIC worked the best in the case of high chemical
similarity thresholds. It seems that there is little difference between
the performance of AERS—freq and AERS—bit. On the other hand,
as shown in the bottom half of Table 1 for the all drugs—associated
interaction data, the pharmacogenomic approach worked better
than the chemogenomic approach in the case of low chemical
similarity thresholds, but worse than the chemogenomic approach
in the case of high chemical similarity thresholds. One explanation
is that chemical structure information is available for most drugs,
so the number of predictable drugs by the chemogenomic approach
is larger than that of the pharmacogenomic approach, which
suggests an advantage of the chemogenomic approach over the
pharmacogenomic approach in terms of prediction coverage of
drug—target interactions. In addition, there are many drug derivatives
from the same drug lead that are chemically and structurally similar
with each other within the all drug—associated interaction data, so
the prediction with chemical structures are relatively easy in such a
case.

Table 2 shows the AUC scores by the block—wise cross—validation,
where ‘NA’ means that the algorithm did not work because it
detected almost no similarities between drugs in the training set.
Similar tendencies exhibited in the pair—wise cross—validation can be
observed in the block—wise cross—validation as well. However, the
AUC scores in the block—wise cross—validation tend to be much lower
than those in the pair—wise cross—validation. This result suggests
that predicting all potential targets of drugs which have no known
targets is much more difﬁcult than predicting missing targets (e.g.
off—targets) of drugs with known targets (which have at least one
known target protein). Among the four pharmacological similarities
for the common drug—associated interaction data, SIDER worked the
best in the case of low chemical similarity thresholds, and JAPIC
worked the best in the case of high chemical similarity thresholds.
Among the four pharmacological similarities for the all drugs—
associated interaction data, AERS—freq or AERS—bit work the best,
because the number of drugs with AERS—based pharmacological
information is much larger than those of SIDER—based or JAPIC—
based pharmacological information. These results suggest that
AERS—freq—based pharmacological similarity is useful for predicting
unknown drug—target interactions which are not expected from drug
chemical structures.

We did not observe any positive effect of data integration in
the cross—validation for the common drug—associated interaction
data, but observed some positive effects in the cross—validation for
the all drug—associated interaction data. Predictable drugs in each
method depend on the coverage of drugs in each database in the
all drug—associated interaction data, so different data sources might
complement each other. INTEG—P worked better than individual
pharmacogenomic approaches in most cases, which suggests the
usefulness of integrating different side—effect resources. INTEG—PC
worked the best in most cases, but it was at a competitive level with
AERS—freq or AERS—bit in the case of low clustering thresholds. This
result suggests that the integration of pharmacological information
and chemical information is useful only in the prediction of potential
targets of drugs sharing chemical similarity to some extent with
drugs in the training set.

We also conducted the same cross—validation experiments using
the precision—recall curve (PR curve) and the area under the
PR curve (AUPR). The resulting AUPR scores are shown in

Supplemental Table 1, and the same tendencies exhibited in the
AUC scores can be observed in the AUPR scores as well.

4.2 Prediction for unknown drug—target interactions

Having conﬁrmed the usefulness of our method, we conducted a
comprehensive prediction of interactions between all possible drugs
and target proteins. We trained a predictive model using all known
drug—target interactions in the gold standard data and predicted
unknown targets for all possible drugs for which pharmacological
information was available in AERS. We predicted potential off—
targets of 1874 drugs with known targets in the gold standard data
and potential target proﬁles of 2519 uncharacterized drugs in KEGG
DRUG (which were absent from the gold standard data mainly
because target proteins have not yet been identiﬁed) using the AERS—
freq—based pharmacological similarity. All the prediction results can
be obtained from the supplemental materials.

We focused on drug—target interactions that were predicted
only by the AERS—freq—based pharmacogenomic approach (which
were not predicted by the previous chemogenomic or other
pharmacogenomic approaches). Figure 2 shows some examples
of known and predicted (score 2 100) drug—target interaction
networks obtained by the AERS—freq—based method. Although
the target prediction was made mainly based on the side effect
similarity, drugs with similar efﬁcacy were generally predicted to
target the same proteins, such as antituberculous agent D09773
(isoniazid glucuronate), hypnotic agent D01391 (bromovalerylurea),
anesthetic agents D08422 (procaine), D00730 (butamben),
D00543 (enﬂurane), D07552 (bupivacaine), antiprotozoal agent
D00832 (melarsoprol), neuromuscular blocking agent D08655
(tubocurarine), antihypotensive drug D05627 (propatylnitrate),
antihypertensive drug D04997 (methyldopate), antineoplastic agents
D01363 (carboplatin), D03046 (fosteabine), D03637 (cytarabine),
antihistaminic drug D08117 (levocabastine), antipsychotic drug
D09819 (chlorpromazine tannate), antitussive drug D03579
(codeine polistirex) and many other drugs that are not shown in
Figure 2.

On the other hand, some drugs with different efﬁcacy were
predicted to share the same targets, because of similar side
effects. Many of them were predicted reasonably, e. g. antitussive
agent D01608 (clobutinol) predicted to interact with H1—receptor
(hsa:3269) based on the known antihistaminic drug D01143
(isothipendyl). Some other drugs were predicted to interact with the
proteins that work in related functions. For example, vasoconstrictor
drugs D00150 (angiotensin II) and D02014 (human type angiotensin
II) were predicted to interact with L type calcium channel proteins
(hsa:775, 776, 778, 779) that are the targets of antiarrhythmic
drug D07520 (bepridil). Although it may not be possible for
D00150 and D02014 to bind with L type calcium channel directly,
this result may indicate the indirect relationships between the
vasoconstrictor drugs and the antiarrhythmic drug. Some results
may just show synergistic effects, such as those in connections
antihypertensive/alpha2—adrenergic receptor/anticholinergic (Fig. 2).

One of the interesting interactions predicted in this study was
between the anti—obesity agent D07627 (cathine) and mu—opioid
receptor (hsa:4988). As the mu refers to morphine, mu—opioid
receptor has high afﬁnity with morphine and many other narcotic
drugs such as D07740 (codeine). D07627 was predicted to interact

with mu—opioid receptor based on the side—effect similarity with
narcotic analgesic drug D00841 (levorphanol). In fact, D07627 is
known as a psychoactive stimulant, which is listed in the World
Anti—Doping Agency’s list of prohibited substances used for the
Olympic games. We cannot prove these predicted interactions are
valid without wet experiments; however, our manual investigation
demonstrated that the proposed method provided convincing
predictions.

5 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report to predict drug—
target interactions using AERS. In this article, we demonstrated
the usefulness of our proposed method to predict drug—target
interactions that could not be expected from drug chemical
structures. This indicates possible advantages of our method when
dealing with pharmaceuticals whose chemical structures are not
available, such as peptide drugs and crude drug extracts whose
medically effective ingredients are not still clear.

Drug—target interactions have been investigated by a variety
of statistical or machine learning methods in the context of
chemogenomics. Most algorithms in previous chemogenomic
methods can be made applicable to this study by replacing the
chemical similarity by the pharmacological similarity. Thus we
tested the previous algorithms: BLM (Bleakley and Yamanishi,
2009), P—SVM (Faulon et al., 2008; Jacob and Vert, 2008), KRM

(Yamanishi et al., 2008) and GIP (van Laarhoven et al., 2011)
for the pharmacogenomic problem addressed in this study (AERS—
based pharmacological similarity, protein sequence similarity and
drug—target interaction data for the common drugs were used),
and made the performance comparisons with the proposed PKR
algorithm. Supplementary Table S2 shows the resulting AUC score
and computational cost for each algorithm, suggesting that the
proposed algorithm outperforms the other algorithms in terms of
prediction accuracy and computational efﬁciency. Therefore we used
PKR in this study, but there would be little signiﬁcant difference
in the tendencies observed in the results if we used different
algorithms.

We showed the value of the AERS data for large—scale prediction
of drug—target interaction networks. The future improvement of the
prediction method would be provided by more sophisticated design
of similarity functions and well—designed text—mining techniques.
For examples, protein similarity based on ligand—binding sites and
drug side effect similarity based on the tf—idf measures would be
interesting. Needless to say, continuous management and further
development of the drug databases as well as the collaborative
sharing of knowledge may contribute to better prediction of
drug—target interaction networks, potentially solving many other
pharmaceutical problems.

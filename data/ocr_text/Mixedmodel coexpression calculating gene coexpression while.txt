ABSTRACT

Motivation: The analysis of gene coexpression is at the core of
many types of genetic analysis. The coexpression between two
genes can be calculated by using a traditional Pearson’s correlation
coefficient. However, unobserved confounding effects may cause
inflation of the Pearson’s correlation so that uncorrelated genes
appear correlated. Many general methods have been suggested,
which aim to remove the effects of confounding from gene expression
data. However, the residual confounding which is not accounted for
by these generic correction procedures has the potential to induce
correlation between genes. Therefore, a method that specifically aims
to calculate gene coexpression between gene expression arrays,
while accounting for confounding effects, is desirable.

Results: In this article, we present a statistical model for calculating
gene coexpression called mixed model coexpression (MMC), which
models coexpression within a mixed model framework. Confounding
effects are expected to be encoded in the matrix representing the
correlation between arrays, the inter-sample correlation matrix. By
conditioning on the information in the inter-sample correlation matrix,
MMC is able to produce gene coexpressions that are not influenced
by global confounding effects and thus significantly reduce the
number of spurious coexpressions observed. We applied MMC
to both human and yeast datasets and show it is better able
to effectively prioritize strong coexpressions when compared to a
traditional Pearson’s correlation and a Pearson’s correlation applied
to data corrected with surrogate variable analysis (SVA).

language and may be found at http://genetics.cs.ucla.edu/mmc.

1 INTRODUCTION

The analysis of gene coexpression patterns has been of great interest
in recent years due to the widespread availability of microarray
datasets measuring thousands of genes. Gene coexpressions,
evaluated by comparing the expression patterns of pairs of genes,
have been utilized in order to identify loci responsible for regulating
genes (Ghanzalpour et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2006), to evaluate the
signiﬁcance of known pathways (Subramanian et al., 2005) and to
identify functionally related genes whose relationships have been
conserved through evolution (Stuart et al., 2003). Unfortunately,
gene expression data can be largely affected by technical bias such
as a batch effects or plate effects (Johnson et al., 2007). Such non-
biological effects have been shown to induce correlations between

genes. For example, Balazsi et al. (2003) showed that spacial
placement of microarray probes affected the correlation between
gene expression patterns, causing genes to be more or less correlated
depending on the proximity of their respective probes on the array.
More generally, unobserved factors affecting gene expression have
the potential to cause correlation between genes. When these factors
are shared between gene expressions, they cause genes to have
similar patterns of overall variation. Since these effects are not
directly observed they are not incorporated into statistical models.
The shared variation between genes is attributed to biological causes.
This issue is referred to as expression heterogeneity and has been
acknowledged as a general problem when analyzing expression
datasets (Leek and Storey, 2008).

The detrimental effects of technical confounding on the results
obtained from microarray analysis are well known. Qiu et al. (2005),
while examining the effects of stochastic dependence between
arrays on the correlation of test statistics used in determining
differential expression, noted that the correlation structure of
arrays induced through non-biological effects can lead to spurious
correlation between genes. They note that microarray normalization
procedures mitigate such phenomenon, but are unable to completely
negate them. In fact, the presence of spurious correlations is a
general problem that arises when analyzing many types of noisy
high dimensional biological datasets, and has been examined in
many different contexts (Clarke et al., 2008). In the context
of gene coexpression, the cause of spurious correlations can be
conceptualized by viewing a set of n microarrays measuring m genes
as a m X 11 matrix. In this matrix, we expect that the microarrays
represented by the columns are independent and that some of the
rows, representing the genes will be correlated, indicating biological
relationships. In the presence of technical confounding effects, such
as batch effects, the columns will share characteristics that will cause
the overall patterns of expression to be similar and thus the arrays
will be statistically correlated. This increased correlation between
columns induces correlation between rows, as it becomes more
likely that two randomly selected rows will be correlated, given
that the overall patterns of expression for each array are similar. In
this way, the correlation between arrays, or inter-sample correlation,
has the potential to induce correlations between genes.

Many methods have been developed that aim to remove
confounding effects from gene expression data. For example, in the
case of known batch effects, a method such as ComBat (Johnson
et al., 2007) may be employed. ComBat (Johnson et al., 2007)
uses an empirical Bayes approach to estimate parameters associated
with batch and produces corrected gene expression data. This
corrected expression data can then be used in subsequent analysis.

Mixed-model coexpression

 

Unfortunately, technical confounding such as a batch effect may not
be easily observable. In this case, a method that is able to identify
possible confounding effects without prior information is of interest.
For example, surrogate variable analysis (SVA) (Leek and Storey,
2007) is a method for correcting gene expression data in the absence
of known confounding effects. In SVA, a set of surrogate variables
are estimated and regressed out of the expression data. These
surrogate variables represent the unknown confounding effects
that cause expression heterogeneity. Expression heterogeneity is
expected to be encoded by the inter-sample correlation matrix, which
is the matrix representing the correlation between all pairs of arrays.
Surrogate variables are estimated by iteratively weighting a subset
of the principal components of this matrix. The SVA method is
aimed at the general problem of correcting gene expression data
and does not speciﬁcally target the problem of calculating pairwise
gene correlations. Furthermore, SVA only utilizes the principal axes
of the inter-sample correlation matrix in order to correct expression.
We can reason that the full inter-sample correlation matrix contains
more information than its principal components and therefore SVA
is only utilizing a subset of the available correlation information
in its correction procedure. When the patterns of confounding are
complex, the estimated surrogate variables may not capture all of
the structure encoded in the inter-sample correlation matrix and as a
result the corrected expression data may contain residual correlation.

In this article, we propose a method for calculating pairwise gene
correlations that utilizes the full inter-sample correlations matrix in
order to correct for expression heterogeneity. Our proposed method,
mixed-model coexpression (MMC), uses a linear mixed-model
framework in order to adjust gene expression values and calculate
pairwise gene correlations. Linear mixed-model frameworks have
been successfully used in previous studies to remove confounding
effects when performing eQTL analysis (Kang et al., 2008). The
MMC procedure represents confounding as a random effect in a
statistical model for coexpression. This approach allows us to more
accurately calculate coexpression while removing the effects due to
confounding. Unlike ComB at, our method does not require previous
knowledge about the batch effects. MMC is also able to calculate
coexpression without assuming and estimating some ﬁnite number
of confounding effects, such as with SVA. These two properties give
our method the advantage of being able to represent a wide range
of unknown effects.

A caveat to our approach, as well as other approaches that utilize
the inter-sample correlation matrix as a surrogate for confounding,
is the potential to remove true biological signal, as expression
heterogeneity may be caused by true biological effects. Consider
one transcription factor whose activity marks the beginning of many
possibly unrelated pathways. When this transcription factor exhibits
high activity, the genes involved in the downstream pathways
will appear to be highly differentially expressed. This high level
of differential expression will cause the downstream genes to be
statistically correlated. When this master regulator affects hundreds
or even thousands of downstream genes, the global patterns of array
variation become similar and thus arrays appear to be correlated.
This correlation is represented in the inter-sample correlation
matrix and is utilized in the correction procedure. Correlations
between genes induced by such large-scale biological effects are
not differentiable from correlations induced through large-scale
technical confounding effects and therefore our method will ‘correct’
for both types of induced correlations. In this way, it is possible for

our method or a method such as SVA that utilizes the inter-sample
correlation matrix to remove a true biological signal. However,
this caveat can also be a useful side effect, as the goal of many
coexpression analyses is to ﬁnd groups of genes that are tightly
functionally related. Large-scale effects, whether true biological
effects or technical confounding, may hinder the ability to ﬁnd
smaller gene modules. In this sense, our method can be seen as a
complementary to current coexpression methods that identify large
modules.

In order to evaluate MMC, we take advantage of the fact that
microarrays contain many more probes than measured genes and
that expression patterns for probes measuring the same gene should
be among the most highly correlated within the set of all probes.
We compare methods for computing coexpression by comparing
their ability to highly rank these probe pairs in terms of correlation.
Our results show that MMC is able to rank these pairs more highly
when compared to SVA and a traditional Pearson correlation. We
evaluate our method further by utilizing replicate gene expression
datasets. We utilized two yeast gene expression datasets (Brem
et al., 2002; Smith and Kruglyak, 2008) produced by the same lab,
covering the same strains and same genes but produced 5 years apart
using different microarray platforms. We applied our method to both
datasets and show that it is able to produce coexpression results
which are more concordant when compared to both traditional
Pearson and SVA corrected coexpressions. Finally, we consider
how coexpressions may be used in order to identify biologically
meaningful groups of genes. Under the assumption that genes
working together in the same complex or pathway should be highly
coexpressed, we examined coexpression values for sets of genes
belonging to known functional categories. Given a set of known gene
functional modules, we evaluated the ability of MMC coexpressions
to identify these modules as biologically signiﬁcant. Compared to
both the traditional Pearson correlation and with SVA corrected
coexpressions, we show that MMC has higher power to detect
biologically meaningful gene sets.

2 METHODS

We ﬁrst highlight the relationship between a traditional Pearson’s correlation
coefﬁcient and a basic linear model. We demonstrate the mathematical
connection between the Pearson correlation and hypothesis testing under
a linear model, and use this intuition when developing the MMC.

2.1 Pearson correlation as a linear model

The coexpression between two genes is often estimated by using the
traditional Pearson correlation coefﬁcient. The Pearson correlation gives an
absolute value ranging from 0 to 1. If the absolute value of the correlation
is close to 1, then we say that the pair of genes is signiﬁcantly coexpressed.
The threshold for signiﬁcance is usually domain dependent and set on a case
by case basis. The Pearson correlation can be calculated for any two genes,
yl and y2, by using Equation (1).
_ Z?=1@li-?1)(yzi-?2)
\/Z?=1(YU _y1)2\/Z?=l(yZi —yz)2
In this case, yl and y2 are both gene expression vectors of size n and the
Pearson correlation is the ratio of the their sample covariance to the product
of their sample standard deviations. Here yl and 52 are the sample means
for each gene. The Pearson correlation can be represented concisely using
matrix notation.

We use 1,, to represent a n x 1 vector of 1s.

When the elements of y1 and y2 are sampled IID from a bi-variate
normal distribution and are truly uncorrelated, the following relation holds
(Weatherbum, 1949).

—2
r=rp "—2 (3)

where t has a Student t-distribution with n—2 degrees of freedom. In order
to test the hypothesis that no 2 0, we test the equivalent hypothesis that t: 0,
while evaluating t using the observed rp.

To understand how this relationship arises, let us consider the general
purpose of the correlation coefﬁcient. The correlation coefﬁcient gives a
measure of how linearly related one variable is to another. Another way
to evaluate the linear dependence between two variables is by adopting a
linear regression framework. Within this framework, the linear dependence
between two variables is tested by ﬁrst deﬁning a linear model, in which
one variable is used as a predictor of the other variable, which is called the
response. We evaluate the magnitude of the linear dependence, by testing the
hypothesis that the predictor variable has no effect on the response variable.
With this in mind we deﬁne the two following linear models, in which we
assume that each gene is a function of its mean, some random error and
the observed expression value of another gene. We use 57,- to represent the
observed gene expression vector for yi.

Y1 =3’2,31+,u1+er (4)

Y2 =J’L32 +M2+ez (5)

In order to evaluate the signiﬁcance of the effect that gene 1 has on gene

2, we test the hypothesis that ﬁg 2 0 in the model in Equation (5). Under the

null hypothesis that ﬁg :0, we have that the computed t-statistic follows a

central Student t-distribution with n — 2 degrees of freedom (McCulloch and

Searle, 2001). The computed t-statistic is a function of both the estimate ﬁg

and the sample variance for yl. Through a series of algebraic manipulations

we can show that the computed t-statistic has the relationship observed

in Equation (3) with the Pearson’s correlation (Rao, 1973). We brieﬂy
summarize this relationship here as follows.

 

n—2

t1 and tg correspond to the t-statistics computed for the estimates of ﬁ1 and ﬁg,
respectively. Equation (7) shows that there is a direct relationship between the
Pearson correlation and a linear model of the type in Equations (4) and (5).
Under the null hypothesis, we assume that both t1 and tg asymptotically
follow the t-distribution. Implicit in this assumption is the assumption that
the variance of the residuals e1 and eg is of the form 031. More speciﬁcally,
we assume that both yl and y2 are normally distributed with means ,ul
and ,ug, respectively, and variances 0121 and 051, respectively. When these
assumptions do not hold, such as when the residuals are not independent,
we might experience overdispersion of the test statistics (McCulloch and
Searle, 2001). In other words, the variance of the test statistics will be greater
than expected and thus our assumed null distribution will be incorrect. This
phenomenon has been observed in many cases, for example, when the effects
of population structure are not accounted for when computing association
statistics (Devlin et al., 2001). Since overdispersion leads to inﬂation of
test statistics and the Pearson correlation coefﬁcient is directly proportional
to the t-statistics for the models in Equations (4) and (5), this implies that
overdispersion may lead to inﬂation of the Pearson correlation.

2.2 Coexpression as a linear mixed model

In the previous section, we illustrated the relationship between a traditional
Pearson’s correlation and a linear model. We concluded from this relationship
that when the variance of the residuals is misspeciﬁed, we have the potential

to observe overdispersion, which leads to inﬂation of the test statistics
and subsequently the Pearson’s correlation. In the presence of expression
heterogeneity, we expect that shared confounding between arrays will make
them correlated. When this is the case, we no longer expect that the residuals
for the models in Equations (4) and (5) will be independent. Therefore, the
assumption of independent residuals is incorrect and this misspeciﬁcation
might lead to overdispersion and subsequently to inﬂation of the Pearson’s
correlation.

One way to deal with overdispersion is to account for the source of
overdispersion with a random variable (McCulloch and Searle, 2001).
Therefore, we propose the following two linear models that have an
additional random variable, which accounts for confounding effects.

Y1=$’2,31+,u1+l11+e1 (8)

Y2=Y1132+M2+ll2+e2 (9)
In these models, we assume that var(e1) =var(eg)=ae21, var(u1) =
var(ug)=a$K and that cov(e,-,uj)=0Vi, j, where K represents the inter-
sample correlation matrix. Given a set of n arrays each measuring m genes,
we deﬁne the inter-sample correlation matrix as the n x n sample covariance
matrix for the m x n matrix of the complete array data. In other words, the
matrix K is a matrix containing all pairwise covariances for all pairs of arrays.
The key assumption here is that the additional variance due to systematic
confounding effects is proportional to the correlation between arrays.
When gene 1 and gene 2 are truly uncorrelated (ﬁ1 2 ﬁg 2 0), the Pearson’s
correlation should be zero. However, when the models in Equations (8)
and (9) hold, the observed Pearson’s correlation will be inﬂated due to
correlation between the elements of m and ug. Subtracting the true values
of m and ug from yl and y2, will produce corrected vectors for which the
observed Pearson’s correlation will not be inﬂated. However, the true values
of these variables are unknown and in order to obtain estimates of them,
we would have to make further assumptions and restrictions on the model.
Instead, we only make an assumption about the distributions of both m
and ug. With knowledge of these distributions, we estimate the total variance

of y1 and y2.
Under the null hypothesis, ﬁ1 2 ﬁg 2 0, we have the following.
.V1~N(u1,2) (10)
.V2~N(u2,2) (11)
where

2 = var(u1) + var(e1)
= var(ug) + var(eg)
= 05K+agl

When the gene expression vectors follow the distributions in
Equations (10) and (11), the traditional Pearson’s correlation will be inﬂated
due to overdispersion. That is, when computing the Pearson’s correlation,
we assume that 2 20621, for some 062. In order to remove the effects of
overdispersion in each gene expression vector, we need to transform the
gene expression vectors so that they have the same variance—covariance
structure assumed when computing the Pearson’s correlation. Then using
these transformed vectors we apply the deﬁnition for a traditional correlation
coefﬁcient. This is accomplished by utilizing the following rule, which is
applicable to random variables with a multivariate normal distribution with
mean ,u and positive semi-deﬁnite variance—covariance matrix 2 (Kariya
and Kurata, 2004).

y~ NW, 2) (12)
Ay+b~ N(A,u+b,A2A’) (13)
Using this rule we obtain the distribution for y’f and y; deﬁned as follows.
yf=2"/’(vl—m)~N<0,I) (14)
y: = 2‘1/2o2 -M2)~N(0,I) (15)

When the Pearson’s correlation is calculated in this transformed space
(i.e. using the transformed vectors), we expect that the assumptions of

independent residuals will hold and thus the correlation will not be subject to
inﬂation. Given the true 2 and the observed gene expression vectors yl and
y2, we transform the observed vectors and calculate a corrected Pearson’s
correlation.

We expect that this adjusted correlation coefﬁcient will have a mean of

We are not given the true values of the means ,ul and ,ug or the true value of
2. In order to calculate rMMC between two given gene expression vectors,
we must estimate these parameters from the data. Substituting the estimates
for ,1“, ,ug and 2, we arrive at the ﬁnal formula.

(Y1 ‘71)Tf: 1(3’2 ‘72)
\/(Y1—71)Ti 1(Y1_y1)\/(YZ ‘72)Tf: 1(3’2—72)
The t-statistics corresponding to the ﬁs from the models in Equations (8)
and (9) maintain the relationship illustrated in Equation (6), while rMMC has
been substituted for rp.

In order to determine the value of rMMC, we must ﬁrst determine the value
of fl =8£K+8821 This means that we need to estimate the two variance
components, 882 and 8,3. When estimating only one variance component,
the estimates are obtained analytically through a maximum likelihood (ML)
or restricted maximum likelihood (REML) approach. However, there does
not exist a general analytical method for estimated more than one variance
component. Therefore, we must incorporate a numerical search strategy
in order to obtain optimal estimates. Such solutions are computationally
intensive. In order to estimate these variance components, we employ
a method described by (Kang et al., 2008). This method reduces the
computational complexity at each search step from 0(n3), using the basic
Newton—Raphson algorithm, to 0(n) by re-formulating the problem so that
the singular value decomposition of K can be reused. The method combines
grid search with the Newton—Raphson algorithm and can be applied, in order
to ﬁnd the optimal variance components.

For each pair of genes, i and j , we use the numerical search method to ﬁnd
the optimal estimates for the variance components tag, tag, 117? and jag. We
use the left subscript to identify the gene for which the component belongs
to. For example, to? and ,0; are estimated using the model for gene i [refer to
Equations (8) and (9)]. Using the estimated variance components, we obtain
if] = ia$K+ i031 and J- E = 1175K + 11731, the variance—covariance matrices for
the models corresponding to y,- and yj. These variance—covariance matrices
are used to obtain the observed MMC coexpression values corresponding
to gene i and gene j, irMMC and erMC. Ideally, these MMC coexpressions
are equal. However, in practice this is not the case, so we average them to
deﬁne the ﬁnal corrected correlation rMMC, in order to ensure the symmetry
of coexpression. It is also possible to calculate rMMC by using the corrected
vectors y?‘ 2 i207,- —)7,-) and y; 21320:]- — 371-) and then applying the deﬁnition

 

rMMC = (18)

 

of the Pearson’s correlation from Equation (16). When ,2 3&ij, we found
the solution to be very concordant with that obtained by averaging irMMC
and erMc.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Prioritizing probe pairs targeting the same gene

In order to evaluate the ability of MMC to prioritize true
coexpressions, we leverage the fact that microarrays typically
contain many more probes than there are genes to measure, meaning
that most genes are targeted by more than one probe. We assume

Fig. 1. The distributions of coexpression ranks for a set of 732 probe pairs,
for which both probes in a pair target the same gene. The coexpression
values for each probe pair are ranked with respect to all other pairwise
coexpression values. Smaller ranks indicate higher coexpression. We expect
that probes targeting the same gene should be highly coexpressed and
therefore should have very low rank. The MMC method consistently ranks
these coexpressions lower when compared to the other two methods.

that the expression levels of any two probes targeting the same gene
should be highly correlated, and thus when ranked against all other
pairwise coexpressions, these probe pairs should be among the most
highly ranked. We compare the relative ranking of coexpressions
for probes targeting the same gene between different methods, in
order to determine which method is better able to prioritize strong
coexpres sions. It may be noted that when certain forms of alternative
splicing occur or when some genes are simply not expressed,
the results of this evaluation strategy may fail to differentiate the
methods for calculating coexpression.

We utilized a set of 732 probe pairs obtained from the
Human HapMap gene expression arrays (International HapMap
Consortium, 2003). The gene expression data represents 60
unrelated individuals of European descent (http://www.ncbi.nlm
.nih.gov/projects/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE6536). The probe set
corresponds to those probes that target known RefSeq genes and
that could be coupled with at least one other probe targeting
the same gene. For each probe pair, we calculate the MMC
coexpression, the traditional Pearson correlation and an SVA
corrected Pearson correlation. Each expression value is ranked with
respect to all pairwise coexpressions for each method. Smaller
ranks indicate higher coexpression. We expect that when examining
the coexpression ranks for the set of 732 probes, the method that
performs best should have an abundance of low ranks.

Figure 1 shows the distribution of the coexpression ranks obtained
with each method. The total number of genes considered was
over 26 000, meaning that there were over 300 million pairwise
coexpressions (26 000 choose 2) to consider. Subsequently, there
are over 300 million possible rankings for each coexpression. Each
method places ~96% of the 732 probe pairs within the top 1 million
ranks. The ﬁgure shows that the MMC method consistently ranks
these probe pairs higher than either of the other methods. For
example, MMC places 79 of the 732 probe pairs within the top 100
ranks, while SVA and Pearson place only 63 and 76, respectively. In
the top 10000 ranks, MMC places 216 probe pairs, while Pearson
and SVA place only 177 and 191. If we assume that each of the

732 probe pairs should have a correlation of 1, then their ranks
should be in the top 732 choose 2. MMC places 415 of the 732
probe pairs within this range, while Pearson and SVA place only
370 and 366, respectively. These results suggest that MMC is more
accurately calculating the coexpressions of these probe pairs, which
we assumed to be truly coexpressed.

3.2 Concordance between replicated data sets

Replicate datasets are great resources to use in order to validate
experimental ﬁndings. When considering coexpression, we expect
that genes found to be highly coexpressed in replicate dataset 1
would also be highly coexpressed in replicate dataset 2. However,
due to confounding effects, we may observe a high level of
discordance between coexpressions found using two separate
replicate datasets. Methods that remove confounding may alleviate
this problem and cause coexpressions to be more concordant
between replicate datasets. In order to evaluate the performance of
MMC in this respect, we obtain two yeast gene expression datasets
produced by the same lab and measuring the same genes over the
same strains of yeast but conducted 5 years apart (Brem et al.,
2002; Smith and Kruglyak, 2008). For both datasets, we calculate
coexpressions using MMC, traditional Pearson and SVA corrected
Pearson. We then compare the concordance of coexpression values
between the two datasets.

In order to compare coexpression values between two replicate
datasets, we compare their relative rankings and compute the
proportion that are common. We are considering a total of 6143
genes, so there are over 18 million gene pairs and thus over 18
million coexpressions. We expect that the most highly coexpressed
genes will be the same within both datasets. Given this, we deﬁne
a measure of concordance between two datasets in which we
calculate the proportion of genes that are common within the top
11 most highly ranked coexpressions. For example, consider the top
100 coexpressions from dataset one, we might see that of these
coexpressions only half appear in the top 100 when considering
dataset two. In this case, we determine that the proportion in common
is 50% for n: 100. By calculating the proportion in common for
every n, we obtain a concordance at the top (CAT) plot, as shown
in Figure 2.

The CAT plot in Figure 2, illustrates the differences between
concordance for each of the methods considered. Ideally, at each
point on the x-axis the y-value would be 1, meaning that 100% of
the coexpressions would be in common. Although, this is not the
case, we do see that both MMC and SVA are concordant ~30—40%
of the time when considering the top 200 ranks. However, when
considering the ranks ranging from 300 to 50 000, our method
out performs both methods by estimating coexpressions which are
concordant 20—40% of the time. This result strongly suggests that
MMC is more effective in removing confounding effects which may
cause coexpressions to be discordant across datasets.

3.3 Gene module signiﬁcance

One intention behind the calculation of coexpression is to quantify
the strength of the biological relatedness between genes. For
example, if two genes code for signaling proteins that act together in
one particular pathway, we expect that these genes will be expressed
together and that their coexpression value will be quite high. If we
assume that the coexpres sion between two genes reﬂects the strength

of their biological relationship, it is possible to utilize coexpres sions
in order to predict how biologically relevant a group of genes may
be. Consider a group of genes that all code for proteins that work
together in a complex. It is reasonable to assume that each pair of
these genes will be coexpressed. In this case, by comparing each of
the pairwise coexpressions for the genes within this group we should
see an abundance of signiﬁcant coexpressions. In general, we can
assume that a group of genes that are functionally related should
all be signiﬁcantly coexpressed. We can then use this assumption to
test the signiﬁcance of a group of genes in order to determine if it is
biologically relevant. In practice, by using such an approach we will
likely ﬁnd many groups of genes which will appear to be biologically
relevant, but in fact their high level of inter-coexpression is due to
confounding.

We tested our ability to detect biologically signiﬁcant groups of
genes using MMC coexpressions. We deﬁne the statistic found in
Equation (19), which is simply the sum of the logged coexpression
ranks. rankij represents the relative ranking of the coexpression
between gene i and gene j, with respect to all other pairwise
coexpressions. When genes within a group are highly coexpressed,
the value of this statistic will be high and when they are not it will
be very low. To obtain a set of gene groups which are known to be
functionally related, we chose to use yeast, as it has some of the most
well-characterized genes. The MIPS comprehensive yeast genome
database contains detailed functional data for all yeast genes (Mewes
et al., 1999). We used this resource in order to construct 233 gene
modules ranging in size from 2 to 20. Modules were chosen such that
the number of modules was maximized while the modules in each
size category did not overlap. We chose sizes of 2—20, assuming that
smaller modules would represent more closely functionally related
gene sets and thus the overall coexpressions within modules would
be higher. For each of the 233 modules, we calculated the statistic
T using coexpressions estimated with MMC, traditional Pearson
and SVA corrected Pearson. We estimate the null distribution for T
under each method and each module size n, by repeatedly selecting
11 random coexpressions and calculating the statistic T. Each null
distribution was approximated with 1 million values. Using this null

We used a set of 233 known functional modules consisting of sets of genes of
size 2 to 20. For each of these modules, a P-value representing the biological
signiﬁcance is calculated. This ﬁgure plots the distributions of these P-values.
Since the P-values were calculated for gene sets known to be functionally
related, we expect that there should be an inﬂation of signiﬁcant P-values. It
can be seen that the MMC method produces a larger number of signiﬁcant
P-values when compared to both the traditional Pearson and SVA-corrected
coexpressions.

Figure 3 shows the distribution of the P-values for all modules.
Module P-values obtained when using our method tend to be smaller
than the Pearson and SVA module P-values. For example, ~40% of
the tested gene modules were signiﬁcant at a level of 0.05 when using
MIVIC, while ~25% and 30% were signiﬁcant when using Pearson
and SVA, respectively. This result suggests that MMC is able to
produce coexpression values which were better able to predict real
biological relationships.

4 DISCUSSION

In this article, we present a statistical model for the calculation
of gene coexpression called MMC. Our method calculates gene
coexpressions that are robust to confounding effects. We calculate
the coexpression between two genes by utilizing a mixed-model
framework. Unknown confounding effects are represented as a
random variable in a mixed-model formulation of coexpression.
We use the inter-sample correlation to estimate the variance of the
random variable representing unknown confounding and incorporate
this variance into the model of coexpression.

We compare the coexpressions obtained with our method with
those obtained using the traditional Pearson correlation and those
obtained using SVA corrected expression data. Although, rank
based correlation methods, such as the Spearman correlation, have
been used to reduce the prevalence of spurious correlations due to
deviations from assumptions of normality in expression data, we
have observed in practice that the Spearman correlation coefﬁcient
performs similarly to the Pearson when comparing with MMC (data
not shown). When probe pairs target the same gene, we expect that
their coexpressions will be highly ranked when compared with all

other pairwise coexpressions. For probe pairs of this type, MIVIC is
shown to produce coexpressions that are more highly ranked when
compared with the other two methods. We also show that MMC
produces coexpressions that are more concordant across replicate
datasets generated by the same lab using the same strains but
generated at different times. Operating under the assumption that
biologically and functionally meaningful groups of genes will be
highly coexpressed, we create a simple statistic which is used to
assess the functional signiﬁcance of groups of genes. Our method
shows increased power to discover sets of genes which are known
to be biologically signiﬁcant.

Although our method is able to calculate coexpression while
removing the effects of confounding, it might also remove effects
which are biologically meaningful. Technical confounding effects,
such as a batch effect, typically have a global effect on the data.
That is, these effects will increase the expression variation in a large
number of genes. This shared variation within genes causes them to
appear to be signiﬁcantly coexpressed. Our method estimates global
patterns of shared variation through the inter-sample correlation
and effectively removes the effects causing the variation from the
calculation of coexpression. A problem arises when we consider the
case in which one gene has a large biological effect on hundreds of
other genes. The effect that master regulators have on expression
data as a whole is indistinguishable from the unwanted global
confounding effects. That is, the variation in gene expression caused
by master regulators quite closely resembles patterns of variation
caused by confounding effects and will therefore be removed by
our method. In this case, MIVIC may over-correct true biological
signal and cause true coexpressions to be lost.

The drawback to our method may also be seen as a beneﬁcial
side effect. When master regulators target many genes, traditional
coexpression analyses employing clustering will yield many large
sized gene modules. By removing the effects of master regulators,
MMC essentially enables coexpression clustering analysis to
produce smaller gene modules conditional on the large modules.
Large gene modules discovered through the use of standard
coexpression analysis may be seen as representative of large-scale
cellular functionality. Small modules discovered through clustering
with MIVIC will be subsets of these large modules. By intersecting
results, it may be possible to more fully understand the detailed
circuitry of the cell.

Abstract

Summary: The prediction of change in stability upon point mutations in proteins has many applica-
tions in protein analysis and engineering. We recently adjoined a new structure-based method
called MAESTRO, which is distributed as command line program. We now provide access to
the most important features of MAESTRO by an easy to use web service. MAESTROweb allows the
prediction of change in stability for user-defined mutations, provides a scan functionality for the
most (de)stabilizing n—point mutations for a maximum of n = 5, creates mutation sensitivity profiles
and evaluates potential disulfide bonds. MAESTROweb operates on monomers, multimers and
biological assemblies as defined by PDB.

1 Introduction

Point mutation can have a strong impact on protein stability. While in
biomedical research functional consequences are of particular interest,
in protein engineering often targeted stability changes are intended.
Different computational approaches to predict the change in stability
upon point mutations have been developed. Methods using the 3D
structure of the wild type protein, e.g. I—Mutant2.0 (Capriotti et al.,
2005), PoPMuSiC (Dehouck et al., 2009) or DUET (Pires et al., 2014),
turned out to perform better than purely sequence-based approaches
(Khan and Vihinen, 2010) in general. However, the new sequence-
based method INPS (Fariselli et al., 2015) closes this performance gap
for some datasets and is also able to complement and improve struc-
ture-based approaches. We recently introduced a novel structure-based
method called MAESTRO which has a similar or better accuracy than
the competitor methods (Laimer et al., 2015). MAESTRO offers add-
itional benefits which are (i) report of a prediction confidence value, (ii)
operation on multimeric proteins, (iii) a scan mode for the most (de)sta-
bilizing n—point mutations and (iv) evaluation of potential disulfide

bonds.

Here, we present MAESTROweb, which provides an easy to use
web interface to MAESTRO for the most frequent application
scenarios.

2 Features

MAESTROweb provides four experiment types. First, the investiga-
tion of user-specified mutations. The mutations sites and types can
be selected through menus or by ﬂexible mutation syntax.

The second type of experiment is a scan for the most (de)stabiliz-
ing n-point mutation (n S 5), which is useful for protein engineering
tasks. For n = 1, an optimal search is applied. For n > 1, a greedy
search or evolutionary algorithm (EA) is utilized.

Third, MAESTROweb offers the calculation of mutation sensi-
tivity profiles, where the impact of each mutation at each possible
position is visualized, similar to the PoPMuSiC web server
(Dehouck et al., 2011). This allows the identification of cold or
hot spot sites, respectively, which are resistant or sensitive to
mutations.

utilizing a greedy (Scan gr.) or an EA algorithm (Scan EA), calculation of a mutation sensitivity proﬁle (Proﬁle) and the evaluation of potential disulﬁde bonds

(SS-bonds). The values represent the median run time in seconds of 10 experiment repeats.

The fourth experiment type is the evaluation of potential disul-
fide bonds. In addition to AAG values, geometric constraints are
applied. Both, geometry and AAG are combined to a disulfide bond
score.

Depending on the experiment, mutations can be restricted to
certain amino acid classes, exposed or buried residues and user-
specified regions. Results are stored for a period of 7 days on our
server. All tabular results can be downloaded as CSV files.

3 Implementation and run-time statistics

MAESTROweb is mainly implemented in JavaScript. The web ser-
ver is a node.js instance, the GUI realized with the Jade toolkit
and molecular graphics with JSmol (Hanson et al., 2013). The
MAESTRO backend is implemented as a C ++ library with SWIG
generated Python interfaces. Web service and backend are connected
through REST-based adapters.

The run time depends on the protein size and on the number of
combinatorial mutations. In Table 1, we give the approximate run
times of the four provided experiment types on a small, a medium
sized and a large protein. The sensitivity profile corresponds to a sin-
gle-point mutation (n = 1) scan.

4 Example application

In order to demonstrate the importance of using multimers, we
applied MAESTROweb to the Nod1 caspase activation and recruit-
ment domain (PDB—ID 2NSN, Coussens et al., 2007) using the biolo-
gical assembly, which is a dimer, and the asymmetric unit, which is a

monomer. The last helix undergoes a domain swapping and thus
builds a tight interface between the monomers. We first performed a
scan for the most stabilizing single-point mutation. The five top scor-
ing mutations in the biological assembly are D42L, H33L, P102K,
T32R and A52K, whereas in the monomer these are V98R, 583F,
Y97E, 583Y and 583M. We then generated mutation sensitivity pro-
files, downloaded the corresponding CSV files and generated boxplots
with the plotting library matplotlib for direct comparison (Fig. 1).
Especially in the region of helix 5 and 6, there are considerable differ-
ences. This is the area, where helix 6 swaps the domain and strongly
interacts with helix 5 from the other domain. Ignoring the multimeric
state would potentially lead to wrong conclusions.

5 Conclusion

We have introduced MAESTROweb, an easy to use web service for
the prediction of changes in stability upon point mutations in pro-
teins. It provides several common types of in silico mutation experi-
ments. The applicability on multimeric structures and the improved
accuracy on multi-point mutations make MAESTROweb outstand-
ing in comparison to other web tools.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Because cancer has heterogeneous clinical behaviors due
to the progressive accumulation of multiple genetic and epigenetic
alterations, the identification of robust molecular signatures for
predicting cancer outcome is profoundly important. Here, we
introduce the APPEX Web-based analysis platform as a versatile
tool for identifying prognostic molecular signatures that predict
cancer diversity. We incorporated most of statistical methods for
survival analysis and implemented seven survival analysis workflows,
including CoxSing/e, CoxMu/ti, lntransSing/e, lntransMu/ti, SuperPC,
TimeRoc and multivariate. A total of 236 publicly available datasets
were collected, processed and stored to support easy independent
validation of prognostic signatures. Two case studies including
disease recurrence and bladder cancer progression were described
using different combinations of the seven workflows.

Availability and implementation: APPEX is freely available at http://
www.appex.kr.

1 INTRODUCTION

The identiﬁcation of robust molecular signatures that predict
cancer patient outcome is profoundly important because cancers
have heterogeneous clinical courses even if they have similar
clinicopathological characteristics. By using prognostic molecu-
lar signatures, cancer patients may be treated more effectively.
For example, the Oncotype DX breast cancer assay is now used
in the clinic to predict the clinical behavior of breast cancer
patients (Paik et al., 2004).

Various software tools supporting cancer genomics studies
have been reported. Most of these studies provide a database
platform for searching disease-associated genes and target
drugs (Aguirre-Gamboa et al., 2013; Gao et al., 2013; Madden
et al., 2013; Reinhold et al., 2012; Ringner et al., 2011), whereas
only one system provides a software environment for handling a
user’s own cancer genomics data with clinical information to

determine a signiﬁcant prognostic signature (Corradi et al.,
2009). Beyond software toolkits for cancer research, many inves-
tigators use commercial programs or script language, such as
SPSS, Matlab or R, for advanced statistical analysis. However,
there are few suitable Web-based analysis tools that help
researchers develop gene signatures. For many oncology investi-
gators, doing proper statistical analyses using publicly available
tools can be a daunting task. In addition, most genome-wide
analysis tools are not equipped with tools for identifying prog-
nostic signatures by survival analysis.

Here, we constructed APPEX, a Web-based software platform
to help researchers in the efforts to identify prognostic signatures
from genomics data. APPEX is designed to be easy to use and
ﬂexible, and it is freely available for advanced statistical survival
analyses. A user-friendly graphical interface similar to a desktop
application is provided so that users can easily handle their own
data on APPEX even if they are not familiar with statistical
analysis packages. In addition, APPEX contains >200 publicly
available datasets directly applicable on the system so that users
can easily validate newly identiﬁed signatures in independent
patient cohorts.

2 METHODS
2.1 Analysis methods incorporated in APPEX

The APPEX system currently contains four independent statistical
approaches for identifying and estimating a signature associated with
cancer outcome, i.e. the Cox proportional hazard model (Cox, 1972),
an in-trans correlation approach (Lee et al., 2010), SuperPC (Bair and
Tibshirani, 2004) and time-dependent ROC curves (Heagerty et al., 2000).
Details for their methodologies are available in the Supplementary
Methods.

2.2 Collection and processing of public datasets

We have collected 236 public datasets containing continuous numeric
intensity data (i.e. mRNA expression, methylation, genomic variation
and non-coding RNA proﬁles) and patient follow-up information from
the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO) and incorporated them into the APPEX.
The public datasets were normalized using quantile normalization. To
handle data generated from heterogeneous experimental platforms, we
considered a combination of unique probe IDs and gene symbols as
gene-identifying criteria. Therefore, APPEX processes intensity values
with probe IDs and determines gene annotations with gene symbols.

APPEX

 

2.3 Implementation and system architecture

Basically, APPEX was implemented with JAVA. To provide user-friendly
and active interfaces, the Google Web toolkit (GWT, ver. 2.5.1) and
GWT extended (GXT, ver. 3.0.1) frameworks were used. Data exchange
between clients and the APPEX server is controlled by a GWT remote
procedure call. All statistical analysis methods in APPEX were imple-
mented using R (ver. 3.0.1) with Bioconductor plugins (ver. 2.12). To
handle multiple time-consuming jobs concurrently, the Quartz frame-
work was used (ver. 2.1.6). To handle public datasets from the NCBI
GEO and user analysis history, the MySQL database server was used
(ver. 5.5.11) (Supplementary Fig. S1).

3 RESULTS

3.1 Web-based bioinformatics tool

Various analysis methods designed to be easily accessible to
investigators without bioinformatics or statistics expertise are
available at the APPEX Web site (Fig. l). APPEX consists of
two parts: the APPEX analyzer, which determines signatures
associated with cancer outcome, and the public dataset explorer,
in which a user explores previously published cancer patient
cohorts and directly applies them to the APPEX analyzer
(Supplementary Fig. S2A).

APPEX currently provides seven independent workﬁows
for searching a signature (Fig. 1). For user convenience, we
deﬁned a short name for each analysis method: CoxSingle,
CoxMulti, SuperPC, IntransSingle, IntransMulti, T imeRoc and
Multivariate. Although each workﬂow has its own statistical
model, they all have identical execution ﬁows (Supplementary
Fig. S3). When accessing the APPEX analyzer, users select

one of the seven tools by clicking a button (Supplementary
Fig. S2B). Next, a simple copy and paste action or ﬁle
upload is performed to submit a user’s own data to the
APPEX server. If there is a history of previous analyses, a user
may choose one of them. Parameters of each analysis are
then conﬁgured, and when the analysis is completed, infor-
mation about how to access the result is delivered to a user’s
e-mail address. Details of seven analysis workﬂows and
APPEX operating policy are available in the Supplementary
Results.

3.2 Public patient cohorts

Currently, we have collected 236 cohorts from the NCBI GEO
and constructed a database for users to explore. When a user
chooses one of the datasets in the APPEX dataset explorer and
clicks an analysis method, the APPEX analyzer will apply the
data to an analysis method selected by the user (Supplementary
Fig. S4). The generated ﬁle is automatically saved in the user’s
storage area and is accessible at a later date.

3.3 Prognostic signatures identiﬁed by APPEX

To validate the APPEX utility, we demonstrate practical
examples of the APPEX application including the novel ﬁnding
of a prognostic and predictive signature in bladder cancer.
We describe two important cases of cancer prognosis: disease
progression and the recurrence of non-muscle invasive bladder
cancer. Detailed explanations of examples are provided in the
Supplementary Results.

4 CONCLUSIONS

Because two or more combined approaches are frequently
needed to obtain a practical signature consisting of a small
number of genes, we suggest practical guidelines for selecting
APPEX workﬂows in Figure 1. APPEX may be the best
choice when users try to discover signiﬁcant novel factors to
predict diverse behaviors of cancer.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Transcription factors (T F3) are proteins that regulate
gene activity by binding to specific sites on the DNA. Understanding
the way these molecules locate their target site is of great importance
in understanding gene regulation. We developed a comprehensive
computational model of this process and estimated the model
parameters in (N.R.Zabet and B.Adryan, submitted for publication).
Results: GRiP (gene regulation in prokaryotes) is a highly versatile
implementation of this model and simulates the search process
in a computationally efficient way. This program aims to provide
researchers in the field with a flexible and highly customizable
simulation framework. Its features include representation of
DNA sequence, TFs and the interaction between TFs and the
DNA (facilitated diffusion mechanism), or between various TFs
(cooperative behaviour). The software will record both information
on the dynamics associated with the search process (locations
of molecules) and also steady-state results (affinity landscape,
occupancy-bias and collision hotspots).

1 INTRODUCTION

It is well established now that transcription factor (TF) ﬁnd their
target site through facilitated diﬁ‘usion, a combination between 1D
random walk on the DNA and 3D diffusion in the cytoplasm (Berg
et al., 1981; Elf et al., 2007). Once bound to the DNA, TFs perform
three main types of movements: (i) sliding , (ii) hopping and (iii)
jumping (Mirny et al., 2009). The ﬁrst two mechanisms, sliding and
hopping, assume that the TF performs small movements on the DNA
without releasing into the cytoplasm, whereas the third assumes a
3D diffusion in the cytoplasm before rebinding.

With few exceptions, most of the theoretical efforts have
been invested into analytical solutions of the facilitated diffusion
mechanism. If one wants to consider real DNA sequences and
dynamic crowding on the DNA (mobile ‘roadblocks’), then this
rules out analytical solutions. Computational methods and, in
particular, stochastic simulations overcome these limitations and

provide a more accurate mechanistic representation of the underling
biological process. In particular, these type of stochastic simulations
can be used to answer question related to how TFs perform the search
process. For example, one could investigate whether molecules
prefer to hop or to slide and what is the contribution of these two
alternative movements on the DNA to the overall 1D random walk
in a crowded environment.

Building on the comprehensive model constructed in (N.R.Zabet
and B.Adryan, submitted for publication), we developed GRiP
(gene regulation in prokaryotes), a program that allows stochastic
simulation of the search process of TFs for their target sites on the
DNA.

The analyzed systems can be large. For example, Escherichia. coli
K—12 has a 4.6 Mbp genome and there are ~104 DNA binding
proteins (agents). To produce results within relative short time,
previous software had to either rely on coarse grain models
(Wunderlich and Mirny, 2008) or to consider small subsystems (Chu
et al., 2009). GRiP represents a new and efﬁcient implementation
of the TF search process, which considers a highly detailed model
of 1D diffusion and, at the same time, it simulates at least N4
times faster than previous software (Barnes and Chu, 2010; Chu
et al., 2009). Consequently, by allowing genome-wide stochastic
simulations of a highly detailed model of facilitated diffusion, GRiP
can highlight possible biases in the results, where the level of details
was insufﬁcient (coarse grain models) or the size of the analyzed
system was too small.

A few studies, such as Das and Kolomeisky (2010), addressed the
problem of facilitated diffusion through simulations focusing on the
3D diffusion rather than the 1D case. The 3D diffusion is time and
resource consuming, especially for simulations at the genome level.
van Zon et al. (2006) showed that the model based on the zero-
dimensional Chemical Master Equation can reliably represent the
rate at which TFs associate non-speciﬁcally with the DNA, as long as
the model takes into account that once a molecule unbinds from the
DNA, it has a high probability of fast rebinding in close proximity.
This suggests that there is no need to simulate the 3D diffusion
explicitly, but rather have this replaced by a simple arrival rate and
ensuring that the model incorporates the fast rebinding probability
in the unbinding rate, a strategy which we also adopt.

2 DESCRIPTION

We implemented the target ﬁnding process as a hybrid model
mixing agent-based methods with event driven stochastic simulation
algorithms (Gillespie, 1977). The software is implemented in Java
1.6, which ensures high portability.

In the simulator, each TF molecule is represented as an agent able
to perform certain actions, whereas the DNA molecule is modelled
as a string of base pairs (A, T, C, G). There is no measure of distance
between the molecules, but the TF molecules can be either free in
the cytoplasm or bound on the DNA at certain positions. The free
TF molecules have only one action available, namely to bind to the
DNA.

The cytoplasm is assumed to be a perfectly mixed reservoir from
where the free TF molecules can ﬁnd the DNA at exponentially
distributed times. To simulate the 3D diffusion we use the Direct
Method implementation of Gillespie Algorithm (Gillespie, 1977)
which generates a statistically correct trajectory of the Master
Equation.

The model considers volume exclusion, allowing only one TF to
cover certain base pair at any speciﬁc time point. A bound molecule
will occupy a number of consecutive base pairs on the DNA. The
size on the DNA of each TF molecule is computed as the number
of base pairs of the DNA binding motif added to the number of
obstructed base pairs on the left side of the molecule and the number
of obstructed base pairs on the right side.

A feature which was not considered by previous models (Barnes
and Chu, 2010; Chu et al., 2009) is TF orientation on the DNA.
If TFs are not symmetric, the user can set TF molecules to have
two orientations on the DNA, which can lead to different afﬁnities
depending on the molecule orientation. Whenever a TF binds to
the DNA, the system selects a random orientation. This can be
changed only after the TF molecule unbinds and rebinds to the DNA,
including during hops.

The simulator supports the deﬁnition of multiple TF species,
which are classiﬁed in two types: (i) non-cognate TFs and (ii)
cognate TFs. The cognate ones are the TFs that are of interest and
that we can follow, whereas the non-cognate ones’ main purpose is
to simulate the ‘other’ proteins on the DNA, which might interfere
with the search process of the cognate TFs. For efﬁciency reasons,
we pre-calculate the afﬁnities of each TF species, both cognate and
non-cognate, and store them in individual arrays. The non-cognate
binding energy is randomly generated using a Gaussian distribution
with the mean and variance provided as inputs for each non-cognate
species.

For cognate TFs, there are several ways in which the binding
energy can be computed, but this work is restricted to three well
known ones: (i) mismatch energy (Gerland et al., 2002); (ii) position
frequency matrix (PFM) and information theory (Stormo, 2000); and
(iii) PFM and binding energy (Berg and von Hippel, 1987). In all
scenarios, we assume that each position in the DNA binding motif
is approximately independent and additive.

A bound TF molecule can perform, with user-deﬁned
probabilities, one of the following actions: (i) slide left; (ii) slide
right; (iii) hop to a position that is Gaussian distributed around
original position with a user-deﬁned variance; or (iV) unbind from
the DNA. We assume reﬂecting boundaries. In the case the molecule
unbinds, there is a certain probability that it will rebind fast near the
original place.

Finally, the model allows cooperative behaviour between TF
molecules and this can be either mediated by DNA (binding of one
molecule to a certain site on the DNA can alter the afﬁnity between
another molecule and a different site) or represented as direct TF—TF
interaction (two molecules bound to the DNA and in physical contact
can have different afﬁnities for their current positions compared

with the case where they are not in contact); for more details see
(N.R.Zabet and B.Adryan, submitted for publication).

The simulation speed is sensitive to the number of agents in the
system. This mainly comes from the fact that the events queue
becomes larger with increasing number of molecules in the system
and, consequently, higher queues require higher maintenance time.
For 106 TF molecules and the genome of E. coli K—12 (4.6 Mbp), we
can simulate ~4 X 105 events per second on a Mac Pro 2x2.26 GHz
quad-core Intel Xeon with 32 GB memory running Mac OSX 10.6.8.

3 DISCUSSION

GRiP is a highly versatile program which comes with both
command-line interface and graphical user interface. Furthermore,
being written in Java, the software can be run on any machine where
the Java Runtime Environment 1.6 (or higher) is installed.

The program takes as input a parameters ﬁle, which can specify,
among many other parameters, three additional data ﬁles, namely: (i)
the DNA sequence ﬁle (from a FASTA ﬁle); (ii) TF ﬁle (a csv ﬁle with
TF- speciﬁc characteristics) and, optionally; (iii) TF cooperatiVity ﬁle
(a csv ﬁle). Note that, if either the DNA sequence ﬁle or the TF ﬁle
are not provided, then the simulator can randomly generate that data
(DNA sequence or TF species).

Once started, the simulation runs until the time in the cell reaches
a predeﬁned stop time, or until all target sites are reached (if the
stop time is set to 0). As output, the simulator can print information
on: (i) the position of TF molecules on the DNA (or proportion of
bound molecules to the DNA); (ii) computed afﬁnity landscapes for
each TF species; (iii) measured occupancy bias for each TF species;
(iV) statistical information related to TF species (such as residence
time, sliding lengths, actual sliding lengths, binding events etc.); (V)
simulation speed; (Vi) stored sliding lengths for each species; and
(Vii) statistics on collisions (total number, total number per species
and hot spots on DNA).

GRiP can simulate 1 s of E. coli K—12 and lacI using biologically
plausible parameters between 1 h and 4 h (depending on the
simulation parameters, the machine on which the simulation is run
and even on the interface of the application, GUI or command line),
which means that one can simulate up to 10 min of a bacterial cell
within a month; for details see Supplementary Material.

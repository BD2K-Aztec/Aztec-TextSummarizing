ABSTRACT

Motivation: Interpretation and communication of genomic data re-
quire flexible and quantitative tools to analyze and visualize diverse
data types, and yet, a comprehensive tool to display all common gen-
omic data types in publication quality figures does not exist to date. To
address this shortcoming, we present Sushi.R, an R/Bioconductor
package that allows flexible integration of genomic visualizations into
highly customizable, publication-ready, multi-panel figures from
common genomic data formats including Browser Extensible Data
(BED), bedGraph and Browser Extensible Data Paired-End (BEDPE).
Sushi.R is open source and made publicly available through GitHub
(https://github.com/dphansti/Sushi) and Bioconductor (http://biocon-
ductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Sushi.html).

1 INTRODUCTION

Genomic science is a rich data-intensive ﬁeld in which diverse
data types are combined to uncover and explore characteristics
of sequence elements on a large scale. However, despite a grow-
ing set of mature standard Visualization techniques and ﬁle for-
mats, no comprehensive tools exist to facilitate multi-panel
Visualization across a broad range of standard genomic data
types. To address this deﬁciency, we developed Sushi.R, a ﬂex-
ible R library that leverages standard Visualization techniques
and ﬁle formats to produce highly customizable publication-
quality ﬁgures of genomic data within the widespread analysis
environment, R(R Core Team, 2013).

2 METHODS

Sushi.R is written exclusively in the R software environment. The Sushi.R
package includes 13 example datasets and a Vignette detailing the
usage of each (Sanyal et al., 2012; Li et al., 2012; ENCODE Project
Consortium 61 al., 2012; Neph et al., 2012; International
Consortium for Blood Pressure Genome-Wide Association Studies
at al., 2011; Dixon et al., 2012; Rhee and Pugh, 2011). Datasets that
were mapped to hgl9 were converted to hgl8 using the liftOver tool.
Sushi is compatible with all organisms and genome builds. Large datasets
were ﬁltered to include only regions shown in Figure l. ChIA-PET inter-
actions were additionally ﬁltered to remove interactions between regions
51000 bp apart. To facilitate use, Sushi.R is open source and is distrib-
uted through both Bioconductor for one-step installation and GitHub for

version control, issue management and third-party development
(Gentleman et al., 2004).

3 FEATURES

Quantitative and qualitative genomic information can typically
be broken down into three data types: features, signals and inter-
actions. Sushi.R provides ﬂexible methods to plot each data type,
allowing users to represent Virtually any type of genomic data
in an aesthetically pleasing, coherent and integrative fashion.
A Sushi plot made entirely within R (without any modiﬁcations
in image-editing software) displaying multiple data types is
shown in Figure l. The code and data to make Figure l are
included as part of the Sushi.R package.

Feature data describe genomic regions characterized by a
unique combination of chromosome, start and stop coordinates.
Often stored in Browser Extensible Data (BED) format, feature
data can be used to represent sites of transcription factor bind-
ing, gene structures, transcript structures, sequence read align-
ments, Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) hits and data
from an array of other sources. The Sushi functions plotBed,
plotGenes and plotMcmhattcm facilitate the Visualization of fea-
ture data in a host of different formats ranging from heatmaps of
feature density to feature pileups (Figure 1A, G—K, N).

Signal data representing quantitative values across genomic
coordinates are commonly stored in bedGraph format and can
be used to represent diverse forms of data including sequence
conservation, transcription, transcription factor binding, chro-
matin accessibility and nascent transcription rates, among
others. The Sushi function plotBedgraph provides ﬂexible meth-
ods to plot, overlay and compare signal track data with appro-
priately represented data from each one of these disparate
sources (Figure 1E, F, L, M).

Finally, interaction data can be used to describe interactions
between distal genomic elements in both a qualitative or quanti-
tative fashion. Interaction data describing, for example, 3D chro-
matin structure are commonly stored in Browser Extensible Data
Paired-End (BEDPE) format or in interaction matrices. Sushi
functions plotHiC and plotBedpe are used to plot interactions
data as either trapezoidal heatmaps, arched lines or box and line
structures, and support quantitative mapping of interaction sig-
nals on y-axis values, color scales and line widths (Figure lB—D).

Sushi plots can easily be combined and augmented via a
number of annotation functions including zoomsregion, 200m-
box, maptocolor and addlegend, allowing customizable scaling
of colors, line types and line widths for ﬂexible quantitative pres-
entation. Zoom inset features facilitate Visualization at multiple

4 DISCUSSION

The rapid proliferation and complexity of genomics experi-
ments—fueled by high-throughput sequencing—has concomi-
tantly driven demand for analysis and visualization tools that
facilitate interpretation and communication of rich and diverse
genomic data types. Sushi ﬁlls a critical void among currently
available visualization tools by providing a means to easily pro-
duce sophisticated, customizable, genomic visualizations.
Sushi.R will be of great use to the genomic community, as it
accelerates our ability to uncover, document and communicate
important scientiﬁc ﬁndings derived from increasingly abundant,
and complex, genomic data.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Protein phosphorylation is the most common post-
translational modification (PTM) regulating major cellular processes
through highly dynamic and complex signaling pathways. Large-
scale comparative phosphoproteomic studies have frequently been
done on whole cells or organs by conventional bottom-up mass spec-
trometry approaches, i.e at the phosphopeptide level. Using this ap-
proach, there is no way to know from where the phosphopeptide
signal originated. Also, as a consequence of the scale of these studies,
important information on the localization of phosphorylation sites in
subcellular compartments (SCs) is not surveyed.

Results: Here, we present a first account of the emerging field of
subcellular phosphoproteomics where a support vector machine
(SVM) approach was combined with a novel algorithm of discrete
wavelet transform (DWI') to facilitate the identification of compart-
ment-specific phosphorylation sites and to unravel the intricate regu-
lation of protein phosphorylation. Our data reveal that the subcellular
phosphorylation distribution is compartment type dependent and that
the phosphorylation displays site-specific sequence motifs that di-
verge between SCs.

1 INTRODUCTION

Protein phosphorylation is a reversible post-translational modi-
ﬁcation (PTM) regulating major cellular processes such as cell
division, growth and differentiation through highly dynamic and
complex signaling pathways. Approximately one-third of pro-
teins encoded by the human genome are presumed to be phos-
phorylated during their life cycle (Manning et al., 2002; Olsen
et al., 2006). Mass spectrometry (MS) has been successfully used
to identify protein phosphorylation in speciﬁc pathways and for
global phosphoproteomic analysis (Boersema et al., 2010).
However, phosphoproteomic approaches do not evaluate the
subcellular localization of the phosphorylated forms of proteins,
which is an important factor for understanding the roles of

protein phosphorylation on a global scale and the function of
protein phosphorylations in regulating biological processes.
Unfortunately, this understanding is limited by conventional
MS technology to identify protein phosphorylations and their
subcellular localization (Chan et al., 2010).

Subcellular phosphoproteomics still represents a major analyt-
ical challenge, as only a few studies were reported over the past 5
years although efﬁcient phosphopeptide enrichment methods
were available since Zhou et a]. (2010). This is in stark contrast
to the large number of subcellular proteomics studies that have
been reported over the same time period, reviewed by Brunet
et a]. (2003), Dreger (2003) and Yates et a]. (2005). Several ex-
amples of subcellular phosphoproteomics were chosen to illus-
trate how this emerging ﬁeld already uncovered important
biological paradigms as shown by Trost et a]. (2010). Although
subcellular phosphoproteomics has the potential to uncover new
regulatory pathways, the in-depth mapping of protein phosphor-
ylation at the subcellular level and the further understanding of
their biological signiﬁcance require independent methods.

Computational methods for identifying phosphorylation sites
have become increasingly popular, which can predict potential
targets to signiﬁcantly reduce the number of candidates that need
to be veriﬁed by MS. A recent review by Trost and Kusalik
(2011) described a comprehensive list of these methods. Most
current predictors focus on organism-speciﬁc or kinase-speciﬁc
phosphorylation sites, and such predictors do not take into ac-
count for speciﬁc subcellular compartment (SC). Every subcel-
lular context is highly dynamic because the expressed proteins,
their abundance and their post-translational modiﬁcations
(including phosphorylation) depend on the physiological state
of the cell (Hjerrild and Gammeltoft, 2006). Therefore, annotat-
ing the subcellular phosphoproteome is important as can be
viewed from the following four aspects. (i) It can offer helpful
clues or insights about their functions; particularly, one of the
fundamental goals in proteomics and cell biology is to identify
the functions of proteins in the context of a speciﬁc compart-
ment. (ii) It can indicate in what kind of and how subcellular
contexts the proteins interact with other molecules and with each
other; this is particularly pivotal for the in-depth study of in vivo
phosphorylation networks, one of the current hot topics in phos-
phoproteomics. (iii) It can help our understanding of the intricate
phosphorylation pathways that regulate biological processes at
the subcellular level (Ehrlich et al., 2002; Glory and Murphy,
2007), and hence, it is indispensable for many studies in system

biology. (iv) It is extremely useful for identifying and prioritizing
drug targets (http://www.biocompare.com/Editorial—Articles/
41 6 l 9-subcellular-targeting—of—proteins-and-drugs/) during the
process of drug development.

To efﬁciently accelerate development of the highly complex
subcellular phosphoproteomic, an integrated platform combin-
ing experimentally data querying and unknown data annotation
is highly demanded. Here, we developed a platform that provides
both a searchable online database and a computational tool to
efﬁciently and reliably accumulate the subcellular phosphopro-
teome for further experimental investigation. In this work, we
report the most thorough characterization of subcellular phos-
phoproteome in humans to date. Originally, reliable experimen-
tal phosphoproteomic data with veriﬁed information of
subcellular localization in humans were collected from several
sources and used to proﬁle subcellular phosphoproteome. Not
only do we ﬁnd that most phosphorylation proteins are uniquely
resided in a speciﬁc SC, but also we show that the distribution of
phosphorylated proteins in SCs is compartment-speciﬁc.
Functional enrichment analysis and protein—protein network
analysis reveal that the phosphorylation signaling pathways of
SCs have higher specialization. Moreover, our large
dataset allows us to delineate type-speciﬁc phosphorylation se-
quence motifs contrary to general phosphoproteome, and we
show that there are sequence motifs of speciﬁc SCs. Overall,
our observations highlight compartment-speciﬁc phosphoryl-
ation signaling pathways, which stress the importance of map-
ping protein phosphorylation in the physiologically relevant SC.
Later, we developed a bioinformatics tool termed SubPhosPred,
which combines a novel discrete wavelet transform (DWT) algo-
rithm with a support vector machine (SVM) approach to identify
phosphorylation sites for different SCs in humans. As one in-
novative character of our method, the most attractive character
of wavelet transform is the ability to elucidate simultaneously
both the spectral and temporal information (Mori et al., 1996)
that was used for encoding as features for PTM prediction.
Cross-validation tests show that the DWT algorithm can boost
predictive performance and obtain encouraging prediction re-
sults for each compartment. Additionally, the independent test
demonstrates that the proposed method outperforms Musite
(Gao, 2010) when the customized models use the same training
datasets as SubPhosPred. For SubPhosPred, we have trained
eight compartment-speciﬁc phosphorylation prediction models
[cell membrane (CM), nucleus (NU), cytoplasm (CY), mitochon-
drion (MI), Golgi apparatus (GA), endoplasmic reticulum (ER),
secretion (SE) and lysosome (LY)] using datasets from our data-
base (SubPhosDB). Finally, the platform-integrated SubPhosDB
database and SubPhosPred predictor are freely available for aca-
demic research at: http://bioinfo.ncu.edu.cn/SubPhos.aspx.

2 METHODS

2.1 Data collection

Phosphorylation data for Homo sapiens from several sources including
UniProt/Swiss-Prot (version 55.0), Phospho.ELM (version 8.0),
PHOSIDA (version 1.0), HPRD (version 7.0) and PhosphoSite (9-Oct-
2012) were collected as shown in Supplementary Table S1. After remov-
ing the redundant data among these databases, the data contain 137 153
experimental veriﬁed phosphorylation sites within 17 297

phosphoproteins. Furthermore, the data pertaining to subcellular local-
ization were extracted from the UniProt/Swiss-Prot database released on
October 9, 2012. Sequence annotated as ambiguous or uncertain localiza-
tion terms (such as “potential”, “probable”, “probably”, “maybe”, or
“by similarly”) were excluded, where 10265 phosphorylated proteins
with experimental veriﬁed information of subcellular localization were
obtained for different SCs. In addition, the experimental veriﬁed local-
ization information of corresponding kinases was also extracted. The
statistical result of the numbers of phosphorylation proteins and corres-
ponding kinases for different SCs was listed in Supplementary Table S2.
We integrated these datasets as a free online database termed
SubPhosDB for the biological research community.

2.2 Building the classiﬁer

2.2.] S VM learning As a machine-learning method of binary classi-
ﬁcation, SVM aims to ﬁnd a regulation that best maps each member of a
training set to the correct classiﬁcation (Vapnik, 1999), and SVM has
been used for a variety of classiﬁcation/prediction tasks relating to
protein bioinformatics. Using the feature encoding of phosphorylated
sequence, the SVM was trained to distinguish phosphorylation and
non-phosphorylation sites for different SCs. The implemented SVM
algorithm was LIBSVM (A library for support vector machines,
http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm), and the applied kernel func-
tion was the radial basis function. To maximize the performance of the
SVM algorithm, the grid search method was applied to tune the
parameters.

2.2.2 Training sets As previously described (Trost and Kusalik,
2011), the experimentally veriﬁed phosphorylation sites were regarded
as positive data, whereas all the other non-phosphorylated serine/threo-
nine/tyrosine (S/T/SO residues were taken as negative data, respectively
(Supplementary Table S3 and Supplementary Ep1). In machine-learning
problems, imbalanced datasets occur when one class has a signiﬁcantly
different number of instances than another class and can signiﬁcantly
affect the accuracy of some learning methods (J apkowicz and Stephen,
2002). In the context of phosphorylation site prediction, positive data are
vastly outnumbered by negative data. To correct this imbalance, for each
compartment as well as their each site type, the number of positive sites
was determined, and an equal number of negative sites were randomly
chosen from the negative training data.

2.2.3 Features and DWT Local sequence clusters (LSC) often exist
around phosphorylated sites because the sites of the same kinase family
or kinase often share similar patterns in local sequences (Kennelly and
Krebs, 1991). Additionally, amino acid pair compositions (AAPC) could
reﬂect the characteristics of the residues surrounding phosphorylated
sites, and it has been successfully used for predicting phosphorylation
sites (Zhao et al., 2012). Therefore, we took into account similarity
scores and amino acid pair compositions of the phosphorylated sequence
to convert these training sets into numerical series. The detailed proced-
ures of feature representation are described in the Supplementary Ep2.
After obtaining the numerical sequences of training sets, the feature wave-
let coefﬁcients of each query sequence were extracted by using the DWT
algorithm to optimize each feature (Lu et al., 2004). Over the past several
years, we developed a series of DWT algorithms mainly for the prediction
of protein function (Qiu et al., 2009; Shi et al., 2011). In this work, we ﬁrst
reﬁned the DWT algorithm for the prediction of the PTM sites in pro-
teins (the calculation procedures are described in the Supplementary
Ep3). To evaluate the stability of each feature, 10 training sets were
constructed by selecting randomly 10 times for negative samples to
match the positive ones in the training sets.

2.2.4 Performance evaluation We ﬁrst developed a predictor for the
prediction of phosphorylation site in a speciﬁc subcellular proteome.

Therefore, it is difﬁcult to compare it with other existing tools.
Interestingly, Gao et al. (Gao, 2010) presented a novel software tool
known as Musite that provides a unique functionality for training custo-
mized prediction models from users’ own data. Hence, we should use the
customized model from Musite to predict phosphorylation sites for fur-
ther evaluating the performance of SubPhosPred. The comparing method
and evaluation criteria are expatiated in Supplementary Ep4.

2.3 Functional enrichment analysis

Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis were performed
using the functional annotation tool of the DAVID bioinformatics re-
sources (Huang da et al., 2009) (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/home.jsp).
According to the two-sided category of Fisher’s exact test, a P-value
<1 .00E—2 (adjusted for multiple comparisons) was considered statistically
signiﬁcant. Enriched terms were sorted by P—value. To show diverse
processes enriched in our data, redundant or highly similar terms were
removed.

2.4 Phosphorylation network analysis

Phosphorylation network analysis was performed using protein inter-
action data from the STRING database (Franceschini et al., 2013)
(http://string-db.org/). Only interactions with a score >0.7 were repre-
sented in the networks. Cytoscape version 2.8 (Shannon et al., 2003)
was used for visualization of protein interaction networks.
NetworkAnalyzer plug-in for Cytoscape software (Assenov et al., 2008)
was used to calculate the topological parameters of the subcellular
phosphorylation networks.

2.5 Sequence motif analysis

It is well known that phosphorylated sites are more conserved than non-
phosphorylated sites, and there are many sequence motifs in the vicinity
of the phosphorylated sites (Olsen et al., 2006). To investigate whether
sequence motif exists for speciﬁc subcellular phosphoproteome, we per-
formed an enrichment analysis of short-linear motifs for every dataset of
SCs using the Motif-x software (Schwartz and Gygi, 2005) (http://motif—
x.med.harvard.edu/). Default parameters were used for this analysis.

3 RESULTS
3.1 SC distribution of phosphorylation in humans

Phosphorylation proteome distribution. Each SC is irreplaceable
in cells. Substantial evidence has conﬁrmed that subcellular
phosphoproteomes play an essential role in a variety of cellular
processes via phosphorylation-mediated signaling transduction
(Chan et al., 2010; Rindress et al., 1993; Trost et al., 2010). To
investigate the distribution of phosphorylation in humans across
SCs, we evaluated the phosphorylated proteins as well as corres-
ponding kinases according to their SC annotations. As men-
tioned earlier, we compiled the subcellular phosphoproteome
database that has collected 10 265 experimentally phosphory-
lated proteins and corresponding 340 kinases from several
public databases. After initial statistics of these data about SC
distribution of phosphorylation, the results are shown in
Figure 1. Both phosphorylated proteins and corresponding kin-
ases are unevenly found across SCs that mostly distribute in
common SCs. The majority of kinases reside in the CM, the
CY and the NU, with each one containing >30% of all kinases.
The MI, GA and ER account for ~5% of all kinases, and the
other SCs, including cytoskeleton, cell junction, synapse, peroxi-
some, centrosome, microsome, melanosome and so on, harbor

~30%. Interestingly, also for phosphorylated proteins, this pro-
portion is almost consistent with the corresponding protein kin-
ases (Fig. 1A and B). At the global level, we also analyzed the
number of different distributions of SCs for all phosphorylated
proteins and corresponding kinases from our compiled database.
As a result, phosphorylated proteins mostly reside in one SC,
where ~64% of phosphorylated proteins are seen in a unique
SC. Instead, there are ~65% of the kinases that were observed in
more than one SC (Fig. 1C and D). Meanwhile, we analyzed the
distributions of the phosphorylated proteins and kinases across
SCs. Although the proportion of unique localization slightly
varies in SCs, the general tendency of both global cell level and
subcellular level was identical (Fig. 1E and F). This result clearly
indicates that kinases are involved in a broad array of physio-
logical functions. But as evident from Figure IF, the phosphory-
lated proteins have higher specialization than the corresponding
kinases for phosphorylation signaling pathways in speciﬁc SCs.

Additionally, for two different levels, all phosphorylated pro-
teins in compartments and unique phosphorylated proteins in
one compartment, we computed the average number of phos-
phosites observed in eight SCs and the global cell (Fig. 1G). At
these two levels, we identiﬁed an average of 7.15 or 11.94 phos-
phosites, respectively, per protein in the global cell, but the
number greatly varies across different SCs. SE exhibits the
lowest number of phophosites with an average of 1.16 or 4.25
sites per protein. This may explain why many previous studies
rarely identiﬁed phosphorylation sites from SE, although this is
not the compartment with the lowest number of phosphorylated
proteins (Fig. 1B). Also, the average number of different SCs or
the global cellular compartment observably separates the two
different levels. For example, LY proteins contain on average
22.85 phophosites from all LY compartments, and only 3.13
phophosites are identiﬁed from unique proteins in LY. These
results illustrate that subcellular phosphorylation distribution is
compartment type dependent and possesses relatively its own
phosphorylation signaling network.

To test whether the tendency toward a speciﬁc signaling net-
work in the SC is relatively independent by diversity protein
abundance, we estimated the relative functional enrichment for
all phosphorylated proteins using the DAVID bioinformatics
resources (see Supplementary Table S4). Also, we created the
interaction networks observed in phosphorylated protein in the
different compartments using Cytoscape software, and deter-
mined their four topological measures using the
NetworkAnalyzer plug-in (see Supplementary Ep5). As expected,
the analysis of the GO annotation between the phosphorylated
proteins found in the different compartments clearly indicates
that different GO biological process and molecular function sub-
categories are enriched in different SCs (P-value< 1.00E-6,
Supplementary Fig. S1). Analyzing the phosphorylation
signaling pathway per SC also revealed similar results
(P-value< 1.00E-4, Supplementary Fig. S1). Moreover, compart-
ment-speciﬁc phosphorylated interaction networks show un-
even clustering features among themselves or compared with
random phosphorylated networks in humans (Supplementary
Fig. S2).

tein kinase types, including serine, threonine and tyrosine kinases
(STYKs), which exist in different SCs to regulate

phosphorylation signaling networks and control subcellular
activities. A number of kinases can often phosphorylate different
residues, while some other kinases phosphorylate only one
unique type of residue (Fig. 2A). It is reported in Figure 2A
that the overlap between serine and threonine kinases is far
greater than between serine and tyrosine kinases and between
threonine and tyrosine kinases. Another report of the phylogen-
etic relationship among the non-overlapping STYKs from Figure
2A also suggests that tyrosine kinases are distinguished from
both serine and threonine kinases, as they are evolutionarily
conserved (Fig. 2B). Actually, different STYKs play various
roles in phosphorylation signaling networks that inﬂuence ca-
talysis, subcellular localization, regulation and other functions
of target proteins (Supplementary Fig. S3). Hence, it is necessary
to investigate the SC distributions of both STYKs and

phosphorylated residue types for further observing the speciﬁcity
of subcellular phosphoproteome. Our investigations showed that
phosphorylated protein increases approximately as the number
of kinases increases for each compartment except for the SE
compartment that drifts away anywhere in the cell (Fig. 2C).
This investigation likely reﬂects that compartment-speciﬁc phos-
phorylation regulates predominantly by compartment-speciﬁc
kinases. It also may explain why the previous survey observed
functional speciﬁcity from the compartment-speciﬁc phospho-
proteome (Fig. 3), although the proteome resides exactly in the
cell. In addition, an interesting observation is that as the subcel-
lular STYKs distribute variously, a similar distribution of phos-
phorylated residue type is displayed for the different SCs
(Fig. 2C). The result likely reﬂects that the kinase resided in
different SCs and plays the different extent of phosphorylated

role, and this extent is compartment-speciﬁc. For example, the
ﬂuctuant distributions of tyrosine kinase do not signiﬁcantly
impact the distributions of phosphorylated type.

3.2 Phosphorylation sequence motifs are speciﬁc for SCs

It is well known that phosphorylation has clear sequence motifs.
To investigate whether the speciﬁcity of a phosphorylation motif
exists in different compartments, we estimated the sequence pref-
erences for compartment-speciﬁc phosphoproteome. Before the
compartment-speciﬁc analysis, heatmap analysis of all identiﬁed
phosphorylation sites reveals general preferences for amino acid
residues surrounding the phosphorylated sites (Fig. 3A). As also
previously reported (Gao, 2010), we ﬁnd that the amino acids
Pro, Arg, Asp, Glu, Ser, Lys and Gly are enriched in the sur-
rounding sequences for phosphorylated serine and threonine
sites, whereas Cys, Trp, Tyr, Phe, Ile, Met, Leu, His, Thr and
Val are depleted. For phosphorylated tyrosine sites, Asp, Glu,
Pro, Ser and Gly are enriched, whereas Trp, Cys, Phe, Leu, His,
Met and Ile are depleted. All phosphorylated types preferentially
occur in serine-rich regions, with a tendency toward neutral resi-
dues in the immediate surroundings of the modiﬁed site.
Additionally, position-speciﬁc preferences include Pro residues
at amino acid position + 1 relative to the phosphorylated serine
and threonine residues and Ser and Leu residues at amino acid
positions +1 and + 3 relative to phosphorylated tyrosine resi-
due. We next investigated whether these sequence preferences are
similar across different SCs. To visualize compartment-speciﬁc
sequence motifs, the Motif-x software (Schwartz and Gygi, 2005)
was used to explore compartment-speciﬁc datasets for analyzing
the 12 residues ﬂanking the modiﬁed site for overrepresentation

of speciﬁc amino acids relative to the human phosphoproteome
background distribution (P-value< 1.00E-5). This analysis re-
veals that the sequence motifs differ for SCs (Fig. 3B). The pref-
erence for Pro residues at amino acid position + 1 is general to
phosphorylated serine and threonine in most compartments, but
on CM proteins, there are many clearly preferences, such as the
motif Rxx[S]P (where S is the phosphorylated site and x can be
any residue, and the motif is preferentially phosphorylated by a
known Pro-directed kinase enriched in CM). Mitochondrial pro-
teins have a preference for hydrophilic residue (Lys and Gly) in
the upstream of the phosphorylated tyrosine, but they addition-
ally show a slight preference for hydrophobic Ala residue at
position 41. Proteins that reside in either SE/GA also have the
general preference for hydrophilic residues at positions in the
vicinity of the phosphorylated sites. The most distinct sequence
motif is evident on NU proteins, where there are many strong
preferences for serine-rich regions in positions 41 to + 4, such as
RSx[S]xS, RSx[S]P and so on. Because a number of compart-
ment sequence motifs differ substantially from the previously
reported motif for phosphorylation (Chen et al., 2011), the
guess about compartment-speciﬁc phosphorylation is proven
true. It seems hardly surprising that some kinases reside solely
in a speciﬁc compartment (Fig. 1). All identiﬁed compartment-
speciﬁc sequence motifs are summarized in Supplementary Table
S5 as a source.

phosphorylation sites of subcellular proteomes

lational modiﬁcations of proteins is underscored by the

termed SubPhosPred which speciﬁcally designed for compart-
ment-speciﬁc phosphorylation site predictions. We sorted
human phosphoproteomics data from SubPhosDB into multiple
SCs and used them to train prediction models by an SVM learn-
ing approach that integrates DWT algorithm and two feature
extractions (AAPC and LSC). For the performance optimizing
of the model construction, the detailed processes and results are
illustrated in Supplementary Ep6.

To evaluate the performance of SubPhosPred, the cross-valid-
ation process was performed for all SCs. Here we performed test
of lO-fold cross-validation on each type of phosphorylation for
10 training sets of each compartment. We then calculated the
values of corresponding evaluation criteria for each training set
as shown in Supplementary Table S6 and plotted the receiver-
operating characteristic curves as shown in Supplementary
Figure S4. The results show in SubPhosPred that the coupled
features used in the DWT algorithm yield more accurate predic-
tions as expected.

3.4 Comparison with other prediction tools

As mentioned in the ‘Methods Compared’ section, the perform-
ance of SubPhosPred was further evaluated by comparing a
novel tool Musite with an independent test. As sufﬁcient training
data are required for training a model in Musite, only three SCs
(CM, NU and CY) tests were performed to make a comparison
as shown in Supplementary Table S7. Musite-l (tested using the
human general prediction model from the pre-trained models in
Musite), Musite-2 (tested using the customized prediction model
of CM, NU and CY) and our method exhibited satisfying per-
formance, but our method SubPhosPred has greatly improved
for all thresholds (high, medium and low). Moreover, an ex-
pected observation from Supplementary Table S7 is that
Musite-2 has slightly better prediction performance than
Musite-l. This observation illustrates that the classiﬁcation per-
formance of the model trained using correlated proteins in a
speciﬁc subcellular context outperformed the model trained
using proteins in a general context.

4 DISCUSSION

Although SCs share a partly independent phosphorylation net-
work according to our analysis, the protein composition of a
speciﬁc compartment is not static and undergoes dynamic
changes following interactions with other SCs. Statistical results
from kinase and phosphorylated protein data have exhibited co-
incident results that the kinases and the phosphorylated proteins
concurrently resided in different SCs (Supplementary Fig. S5, for
the detailssee Supplementary Tables S8 and S9). Interestingly,
the co-localization distribution is similar between phosphory-
lated proteins and kinases (Supplementary Fig. S5). This may
explain why we can identify phosphorylation sites in different
compartment-speciﬁc models by using the SubPhosPred pre-
dictor. In addition, for the phosphorylation cross talk across
SCs, there are still at least three possible explanations for this:
(i) all kinases are synthesized in the CY and may phosphorylate
CY proteins before entering various SCs, (ii) kinases from a
particular SC may have access to substrates from other SCs
during mitosis when the subcellular membrane is absent and
(iii) many kinases may dissociate between SCs. This is exempli-
ﬁed by Jnkl (MAPKlO) and Jnk2 (MAPK9), which, on activa-
tion, translocate from the CY to the NU or the perinuclear
region (Mizukami et al., 1997; Whitmarsh et al., 2001). Despite
diverse reasons, the predominantly phosphorylated cross talk
occurs because of the co-localizations between kinases and phos-
phorylated proteins. Hence, this does not affect compartment-
speciﬁc network independence itself. An observation for compar-
ing the phosphorylation network in NU with in the cell was
shown in Supplementary Figure S6A. According to the topo-
logical calculation of networks, the network parameters includ-
ing the average number of neighbors, the network centralization
and the network density clearly reveal that the NU network is
highly connected with stronger robustness against the network in
human cell. It means that compartment-speciﬁc phosphorylation
subnetwork is self-governed in nature, which would explain
why the phosphorylation prediction on subcellular context
signiﬁcantly leads to precision improvement (for SubPhosPred
P—value<3.2lE-06, for Musite P—value<5.01E—02, see

Supplementary Fig. S6B). Actually, the independence of the net-
work between SCs has become a common view that widely
applies to constructing the training set for the prediction of pro-
tein—protein interaction (Jansen et al., 2003; Rhodes et al., 2005).
In summary, these results again underscore the speciﬁcity of a
compartment-speciﬁc network (kinase—substrate interaction
network).

For several years, phosphoproteomics has moved far beyond a
simple catalog of phosphorylation sites and is contributing to
important cell biology discoveries by unveiling the dynamic
changes in protein phosphorylation regulating numerous cellular
functions. Subcellular phosphoproteomics also has enormous
potential to uncover new regulatory pathways (Kislinger et al.,
2006), while the veriﬁcation of these new ﬁndings or the further
learning of their biological signiﬁcance often requires independ-
ent methods. Annotation of phosphorylation sites in intact sub-
cellular proteomes as pivotal step would further advance our
understanding of compartment-speciﬁc phosphorylation. To
this end, we present ﬁrst a novel platform for annotating sub-
cellular phosphoproteome in humans. Although it does not dir-
ectly address these issues, our present work provides a
foundation for subsequent studies by demonstrating effective
methods for large-scale multi-compartment surveys of phosphor-
ylation. Furthermore, this phosphoproteomic proﬁling can also
serve as a basis of comparison to explore changes in phosphor-
ylation that occur in many physiological and pathological states.

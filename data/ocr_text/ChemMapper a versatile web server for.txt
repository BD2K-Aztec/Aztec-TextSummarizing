ABSTRACT

Summary: ChemMapper is an online platform to predict polypharma-
cology effect and mode of action for small molecules based on 3D
similarity computation. ChemMapper collects >350 000 chemical
structures with bioactivities and associated target annotations (as
well as >3 000 000 non-annotated compounds for virtual screening).
Taking the user-provided chemical structure as the query, the top
most similar compounds in terms of 3D similarity are returned with
associated pharmacology annotations. ChemMapper is designed to
provide versatile services in a variety of chemogenomics, drug repur-
posing, polypharmacology, novel bioactive compounds identification
and scaffold hopping studies.

1 INTRODUCTION

Recent advances in systems biology and chemical biology exhibit
great challenges to the current drug discovery paradigm that
drugs selectively bind with one or two targets and show that
most drugs interact with multiple targets, namely, polypharma-
cology (Keiser et al., 2009; Paolini et al., 2006). On the other
hand, identiﬁcation of new hit compounds and optimization of
lead compounds targeting speciﬁc proteins or exhibiting desired
pharmacological effects are still playing a pivotal role in conven-
tional drug discovery projects in the form of Virtual screening
and scaffold hopping. In this context, there is an urgent request
for developing new strategies to acquire knowledge of the com-
plete pharmacology proﬁle and bridge the chemical and pharma-
cological spaces to improve the success rates of current drug
discovery research, including reducing the side effects and

increasing the regulatory effects on the complete networks
(Keiser et al., 2009).

One of the emerging scenarios to address this question is the
application of molecular similarity searching on basis of the well-
known similar property principle, namely, similar structures may
have similar bioactivity and the same potential drug targets,
which is expected to relate the pharmacology space by chemical
structural similarity information (Johnson et al., 1990).
According to this principle, small molecule similarity had been
used to identify off-targets for a long period (Boehm et al., 2008).
The 2D similarity methods have been widely used in various
online tools, like Similarity Ensemble Approach (SEA) (Keiser
et al., 2007), SuperPred (Dunkel et al., 2008) and ChemProt
(Kim Kjaerulff et al., 2013), which relate protein pharmacology
and disease networks by ﬁngerprint-based ligand similarity, and
F treesWeb (Rarey and Dixon, 1998), which adopts graph theory
to encode molecular 2D descriptions to perform Virtual screening
against large chemical databases. Also, numerous online servers
using 3D similarity methods are also emerging, like Superimposé
(Bauer et al., 2008), which provides two different 3D superim-
position algorithms and three different databanks for screening,
and wwLigCSRre (Sperandio et al., 2009), which is built on top
of CSR algorithm that searches for the maximal common sub-
structure between two sets of unordered coordinates to screen
focused chemical libraries. Recently, a direct comparison of 2D
and 3D methods for on— and off-target prediction reveals that the
beneﬁt of 3D over 2D was obvious for prediction of polyphar-
macology and drug pairs that shared high 3D similarity but low
2D similarity (i.e. a novel scaffold) were shown to be much more
likely to exhibit pharmacologically relevant differences in terms
of speciﬁc protein target modulation OK era et al., 2011).

Herein, we present a versatile web-based tool ChemMapper
for exploring target pharmacology and chemical relationships
against any given small molecules Via SHAFTS, a fast 3D simi-
larity method in which the 3D similarity calculation is driven by
the hybrid information of molecular shape and chemotype fea-
tures (Liu et al., 2011; Lu et al., 2011). ChemMapper assembles a
large repertoire of bioactive chemical database annotated with
target information and multiple screening databases from differ-
ent catalogs of the chemical vendors. It facilitates identiﬁcation

of potential targets that may play a pivotal role in biological
response to the drugs and other active chemicals, as well as the
discovery of new hit compounds with similar pharmacology pro-
ﬁles but novel scaffolds. Moreover, ChemMapper can also be
useful in the application of drug repurposing, as well as investi-
gation of potential side effects related to the drugs and other
active chemicals.

2 METHOD
2.1 Data set-up

The polypharmacology information for the bioactive compounds and
biological annotations of the corresponding targets was gathered from
various public databases, including ChEMBL (ChEMBL 14), DrugBank
(version 3.0), BindingDB (December 2012), KEGG (May 2011) and PDB
(November 2010). The chemical—protein interaction annotations were
categorized as follows: protein name, UniProt access ID, species, biolo-
gical functions, Gene Ontology (GO) annotations (molecular function
and biological process involved) and activity data. Other non-annotated
chemical structures are also incorporated for virtual screening from
public databases like ZINC. The ﬁnal database consists of nearly
350 000 molecular entries annotated for >20 000 proteins and >3 million
compounds for virtual screening. Multiple 3D conformers were pre-gen—
erated for each compound to facilitate 3D similarity calculation
(Supplementary Table S1).

2.2 Similarity metrics

ChemMapper uses SHAFTS as the 3D similarity calculation method.
SHAFTS adopts a hybrid similarity metric combined with molecular
shape and colored (labeled) chemical groups annotated by pharmaco-
phore features, which is designed to integrate the strength of pharmaco-
phore matching and volumetric overlay approaches. Previous studies
proved SHAFTS is more efﬁcient and accurate in ligand-based virtual
screening than the common 2D fmgerprint-based similarity and other 3D
similarity methods (Liu et al., 2011; Supplementary Material).

3 WEB INTERFACE

ChemMapper accepts a chemical structure (sketched online or
uploaded in multiple chemical structure ﬁle formats) as the query
and provides two types of online calculation services: Target
Navigator and Hit Explorer. The input 2D structure will be
automatically converted into single 3D conformer. In the
Target Navigator mode, the users are allowed to search either
bioactive compound collections with corresponding target infor-
mation (ChEMBL, DrugBank and BindingDB) or chemical sub-
strates from the KEGG enzyme database. The results table can
be ﬁltered, re-ordered and grouped in terms of various rules
(Supplementary Fig. Sla). A list of potential protein targets is
returned ranked by the inference of chemical—protein association
network whose edges weighed by the bioactivity of the similar
compounds to the query (Supplementary Fig. Slb). The biolo-
gical annotations for each target, including name, species, func-
tion and involved pathway, are displayed as well (Supplementary
Fig. Slc). In the Hit Explorer mode, only the most similar com-
pounds from various public chemical repositories to the query
are returned, which presumably exhibit similar bioactivity or
function. Alternatively, the users are able to upload their

customized mini-database (in sdf or mol2 format) for virtual
screening by 3D similarity calculation. In both mode, the overlay
poses between the query and each target compound can be visua-
lized. All the information in the result table can be downloaded
in Comma Separated Values (csv) format as well. Two test cases
(polypharmacology effect of loratadine and scaffold-hopping for
EGF R inhibitors) relevant to the two modes are described in
detail in the Supplementary Materials.

Comparing with 2D ﬁngerprint-based similarity calculation,
3D similarity calculation is slower: a typical query to the
ChEMBL (339 624 entities) in ChemMapper takes 12—24 h. A
monitoring page is provided for bookmarking to redirect to
the result page as the job ﬁnishes.

4 CONCLUSION

The goal of ChemMapper is to provide an online versatile frame-
work for fast exploring the target pharmacology and chemical
relationship via molecular 3D similarity methods. ChemMapper
links bioactivity and target protein annotation data associated to
small molecules to chemical 3D similarities, which can lead to
novel perspectives and new applications to the old drugs and
suggest new associations between the chemical and pharmaco-
logical spaces.

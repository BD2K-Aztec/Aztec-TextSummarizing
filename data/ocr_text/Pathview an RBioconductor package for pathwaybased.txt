ABSTRACT

Summary: Pathview is a novel tool set for pathway-based data inte-
gration and visualization. It maps and renders user data on relevant
pathway graphs. Users only need to supply their data and specify the
target pathway. Pathview automatically downloads the pathway graph
data, parses the data file, maps and integrates user data onto the
pathway and renders pathway graphs with the mapped data.
Although built as a stand-alone program, Pathview may seamlessly
integrate with pathway and functional analysis tools for large-scale
and fully automated analysis pipelines.

Availability: The package is freely available under the GPLv3 license
through Bioconductor and R-Forge. It is available at http://bioconduc
tor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/pathview.htm| and at http://
Pathview.r-forge.r-project.org/.

1 INTRODUCTION

The pathway-based approach has been widely used in high-
throughput data analysis (Emmert—Streib and Glazko, 2011;
Kelder et al., 2010; Khatri et al., 2012). It has been successfully
and routinely applied to gene expression (both microarray and
RNA-Seq) (Luo et al., 2009), genetic and GWAS Wang et al.,
2010), proteomic and metabolomics data (Perroud et al., 2006;
Xia and Wishart, 2010). Compared with the individual gene/
molecule-based approach, pathway analysis is more sensitive,
consistent and informative (Luo et al., 2009).

R/Bioconductor has become a primary software environment
for high-throughput data analysis and visualization (Gentleman
et al., 2004). Numerous pathway analysis methods and data
types are implemented in R/Bioconductor, yet there has not
been a dedicated and established tool for pathway-based data
integration and visualization.

In this article, we introduce a novel package called Pathview.
We did a detailed comparison between Pathview and existing
pathway tools in R/Bioconductor and other languages in
Supplementary Table S2. Pathview provides three features that
are rarely implemented well in other tools: (i) fully accessible and
functional pathway visualization. It adheres to human readable

pathway definitions and layouts like KEGG (Ogata et al., 1999).
No previous KEGG base tools provide full graphics, including
node/edge attribute modifications, node/edge labels, legends and
color keys. (ii) Strong data integration capacity. It integrates and
works with data of different types (different omic levels, literature
and so forth), IDs, formats, attributes, species and so forth. As
far as we know, no other tool provides such extensive data map-
ping and integration support. (iii) Easy to automate and integrate
with pathway analysis tools. Only a few tools can be directly
automated and fully integrated into pathway analysis pipelines
(Supplementary Table S2: automated analysis column). None of
these features are brand new, but surprisingly, few of the existing
tools provide satisfactory functionality in these aspects.

2 MAIN FEATURES
2.1 Overall design

The Pathview package can be divided into four functional mod-
ules: Downloader, Parser, Mapper and Viewer, as depicted in
Supplementary Figure S1. Most importantly, Pathview maps
and renders user data on relevant pathway graphs.

2.2 Data visualization

Pathview generates both native KEGG View (Fig. lb) and
Graphviz (Ellson et al., 2002) View (Fig. la) for pathways.
Both graph styles adhere to human readable pathway definition
and layout, yet still allow proper modification and customization
of node and edge attributes. KEGG View retains all pathway
meta-data, i.e. spatial and temporal information, tissue/cell
types, inputs, outputs and connections. This is important for
readability and interpretation of pathway biology. Graphviz
View provides better control of node and edge attributes, better
View of pathway topology and better understanding of the path-
way analysis statistics. The different workﬂows for these two
types of View are merged in Pathview (Supplementary Fig. S1).
This keeps the user interface simple and consistent.

2.3 Data integration

Pathview provides strong support for data integration
(Supplementary Table S1). It can be used to integrate, analyze
and visualize a wide variety of biological data: gene expression,
protein expression, metabolite level, genetic association, genomic
variation, literature record and other data types mappable to
pathways. Notably, it can be directly used for metagenomic

data when the data are mapped to KEGG ortholog pathways.
The integrated Mapper module maps 12 types of gene or protein
IDs, and 21 types of compound or metabolite related IDs to
standard KEGG gene or compound IDs, and also maps between
these external IDs. For other types of IDs (for instance,
Affymetrix microarray probe set IDs) not included in the
common ID lists, Pathview’s auxiliary functions will map user
data to pathways when users provide the ID mapping data manu-
ally. Pathview applies to pathways for over 2000 species, and
species can be speciﬁed in multiple formats: KEGG code, scien-
tiﬁc name or common name. In addition, Pathview works with
different data attributes and formats, both continuous and dis-
crete data (Fig. lb and Supplementary Table S1), either in matrix
or vector format, with single or multiple samples /experiments and
so forth.

2.4 Automated and integrated analysis

Pathview is open source, fully automated and error-resistant.
Therefore, it seamlessly ﬁts in integrated pathway or gene set
analysis workﬁows.

Pathview can be easily integrated with a wide variety of exist-
ing tools in or communicating to R/Bioconductor for high-
throughput data analysis and pathway analysis. In the package
Vignette, we show an integrated analysis using Pathview with
another Bioconductor package gage (Luo et al, 2009).

In automated pathway analysis, we frequently use heatmap,
scatter plots or stacked line plots to View the perturbation pat-
terns. These plots are simple and can be generated quickly in
batches. However, they contain little information beyond the
numeric changes. With Pathview, we can View molecular per-
turbations in intuitive and informative pathway contexts.
Importantly, such graphs can be generated equally efﬁcient as
the classical scatter or line plots. This will greatly improve the
analysis and interpretation of high-throughput molecular data.

KEGG XML data ﬁles frequently contain minor deﬁciencies,
inconsistent, incomplete or even error records because of manual
curation. These deﬁciencies adversely affect the parsing, mapping
and rendering processes and automation. Pathview accommo-
dates these deﬁciencies, corrects them or skips the problematic
pathway with warning. For example, Pathview Parser corrects
for the improper KEGG deﬁnition of enzyme-compound inter-
actions by merging and resolving the conﬂicting ECrel record
and associated reactions records (Supplementary Fig. S2). In
normal cases, Pathview uses KEGGgraph package (Zhang and
Wiemann, 2009) to parse KEGG XML data ﬁles.

3 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

Pathview maps and renders user data onto pathway graphs,
which are intuitive, informative and well annotated. It integrates
and works with a large variety of data types, IDs, formats and
attributes. Pathview can be easily combined with other tools for
automated and efﬁcient pathway analysis pipelines. Currently,
Pathview works with all types and species of KEGG pathways.
We plan to support pathways from Reactome (Croft et al,
2011), NCI Pathway Interaction and other databases based on
needs in the future.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Gene copy number and DNA methylation alterations are
key regulators of gene expression in cancer. Accordingly, genes
that show simultaneous methylation, copy number and expression
alterations are likely to have a key role in tumor progression. We
have implemented a novel software package (CNAmet) for integrative
analysis of high-throughput copy number, DNA methylation and
gene expression data. To demonstrate the utility of CNAmet, we
use copy number, DNA methylation and gene expression data from
50 glioblastoma multiforme and 188 ovarian cancer primary tumor
samples. Our results reveal a synergistic effect of DNA methylation
and copy number alterations on gene expression for several known
oncogenes as well as novel candidate oncogenes.

1 INTRODUCTION

Genomic instability is a hallmark of cancer and characterization of
copy number changes in tumors has lead to identiﬁcation of a number
of genes that contribute to tumor progression and drug response
(Kan et al., 2010). In addition to copy number alterations, DNA
methylation of CpG islands regulates gene expression patterns in
cancers (Esteller, 2008; Kim et al., 2010). Copy number aberrations,
methylation patterns and gene expression proﬁles can be measured
genome—scale with microarrays, which enables integration of these
data and further identiﬁcation of genes that are crucial to cancer
progression.

When integrating copy number and expression data, the major
goal is to identify genes that are both ampliﬁed and upregulated
or deleted and downregulated (Pinkel and Albertson, 2005). Gene
upregulation can also be due to hypomethylation (decrease in
methylation of cytosine and adenosine residues in DNA) and
downregulation due to hypermethylation. As both copy number and
methylation changes may affect gene regulation, integration of these
data should result in improved characterization of genes essential in
cancer progression (Sadikovic et al., 2008; Stransky et al., 2006).

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

We introduce an R package (CNAmet) that integrates high—
throughput copy number, methylation and expression data. Our
primary goal is to identify genes that are ampliﬁed, hypomethylated
and upregulated, or deleted, hypermethylated and downregulated,
though all combinations between copy number, methylation and
expression levels are calculated. To our knowledge CNAmet is the
ﬁrst software package for copy number, methylation and expression
integration. To demonstrate the utility of CNAmet we analyze copy
number, methylation and expression data from 50 patients with
glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), which is the most aggressive type
of brain cancer, as well as 188 ovarian cancer (OV) patients (The
Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2008).

2 METHODS

The CNAmet algorithm consists of three major steps. In the weight
calculation step, the signal—to—noise ratio statistic (Hautaniemi et al., 2004) is
used to link expression values to copy number and methylation aberrations.
In the score calculation step, the weight values are combined to a score that
indicates genes whose expression alterations are due to changes in DNA
methylation and copy number levels. In the signiﬁcance evaluation step,
corrected P—values of the scores are calculated with a permutation test.

Let m denote the number of genes and n the number of samples. In
general, n can vary between the datasets but is subsequently assumed the
same for notational convenience. Inputs to CNAmet are labeling matrices
for copy number (cn) and methylation (me) data MemMme e {0, 1}mX”. For
example, when searching for genes whose upregulation is likely due to
hypomethylation and high copy number status, ‘1’ denotes ampliﬁcation
and ‘0’ lack of ampliﬁcation in Mm. Similarly, ‘1’ denotes hypomethylation
and ‘0’ lack of hypomethylation in Mme.

In order to calculate weights for the i—th gene we ﬁrst take the i—th row
in Men. Let mi,“ and aim be the mean and SD of the expression values of
samples labeled with ‘1’ for the i—th gene in Men, and mi“) and oénao are
calculated with samples labeled with ‘0’. The values gal and 012ml are
calculated similarly from Mme for methylation data. Now, for the i—th gene
we calculate the weight for methylation and expression data as

i _ i
Wi _mme,l mme,0 OJ
me_ i i ’ m
ame,l+0me,0

a, >0, 031,30 >0. (1)

Equation ( 1) is used similarly to calculate the weight W5” for copy number
data. By default, the weights are calculated for genes that have ‘1’ in at least
two samples in both copy number and methylation data. Weights with a
negative sign are denoted as NA. Events where all samples are labeled with
‘1’ in either methylation or copy number data are listed separately.

In order to combine the weight values we deﬁne T to be the total number
of samples and U i the number of samples in the intersection of samples with
‘1’ in Ma, and Mme for the i—th gene. The optional correction term 8,- of
the CNAmet score for the i—th gene is calculated as 8,- =  The correction
term forces the CNAmet score to favor genes that have aberrant methylation

pennuting the labeling vectors and recalculating Wain, Wgw and Si. The
P—values for Si are corrected with the false discovery rate method (Benj amini
and Hochberg, 1995). The H0 here is ‘large score is due to random event’.

CNAmet is available as an R package and as a component in the Anduril
framework (Ovaska et al., 2010). The Anduril compliance enables modular
analysis via a number of preprocessing methods, such as normalization,
copy number segmentation or calling algorithms. This allows the use of
appropriate preprocessing methods to handle data emerging from different
experimental designs and array platforms.

In order to assess the utility of CNAmet we applied it to The Cancer
Genome Atlas GBM and 0V datasets. GBM dataset consists of 181 patient
samples with expression and copy number data, and 64 samples with
methylation data (The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2008).
There were 50 samples with survival data that overlapped between all three
array types. The CV dataset consists of 188 ovarian cancer samples having
data from all three array types.

3 RESULTS

Our analysis of the GBM data using CNAmet resulted in four
lists of genes (Supplementary File 1). In the hypomethylation and
ampliﬁcation analysis the top scoring six genes (P < 0.05) included
MDM2, EGFR and PDGFRA that are well—known oncogenes. We
also compared CNAmet to ANOVA and our results indicate that
CNAmet identiﬁes more oncogenes and prioritizes the resulting
genes better (Supplementary File 2).

Based on these results, we hypothesized that the effect of
methylation and copy number on expression for these genes
is synergistic. To test this hypothesis we grouped the samples
based on their methylation and ampliﬁcation status gene by
gene (Supplementary File 2) of which EGFR is shown in
Figure 1. Samples with hypomethylated and non—ampliﬁed EGFR
show almost normal expression, while samples with EGFR
ampliﬁcation result in upregulated EGFR. Strikingly, samples
with hypomethylated and ampliﬁed EGFR exhibit a substantial

upregulation of EGFR expression when compared to solely
ampliﬁed samples (t—test, P < 3.8 X 10—8). This demonstrates a
synergetic function of methylation and copy number changes in
EGFR expression in GBM. The results are similar for MDM2 and
PDGFRA (Supplementary File 2). The ability of CNAmet to detect
such synergetic effects is also demonstrated in an analysis of 0V
data (Supplementary Files 2 and 3).

Ampliﬁcation and overexpression of EGFR are controversial
prognostic factors in GBM (Phillips et al., 2006). We compared
the age—independent survival of GBM patients with hypomethylated
and ampliﬁed EGFR to patients with only hypomethylated
EGFR. Patients with hypomethylated EGFR had marginally better
prognosis than the patients with hypomethylated and ampliﬁed
EGFR (logrank test P < 0.06; Supplementary File 2). This survival
effect would have been undetected when using copy number data
only (Supplementary File 2), which illustrates the beneﬁts of
integrating methylation and copy number data.

4 CONCLUSION

We have designed and implemented a novel and versatile method,
CNAmet, to facilitate the integration of copy number, methylation
and expression data. We applied CNAmet to GBM and ovarian
cancer data and our results demonstrate the added value of
integrating these three data sources.

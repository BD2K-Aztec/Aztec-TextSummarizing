15 years of “Bioinformatics”

As we look forward to the year ahead, we also want to look back
and acknowledge the outstanding contribution of our Editors
and Associate Editors over the past year.

Bioinformatics remains the main reference publication in the
ﬁeld of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology as evidenced
by high citations and a 10% increase in submissions - from
around 2000 papers in 2012 to 2200 papers in 2013. During
2013 more than 700 papers were published in Bioinformatics,
and for 160 of these the authors selected Open Access
publication.

Our model of Editorial rotation always makes the end of the
year a sad time as we say goodbye to some of our Associate
Editors. This year Mario Albrecht and Martin Bishop end
their terms as Associate Editors, our sincere thanks go to both
of them. Martin has been with the journal since its inception and
has handled in excess of 5000 manuscripts during his time as an
editor. The journal is deeply indebted to him for his contribution.

The beginning of a new year is also a great time to welcome new
Associate Editors who bring their own ideas and renewed enthu-
siasm. This year we welcome Robert F. Murphy, who will focus
on the areas of biological imaging and information extraction.
2013 was a special year for Bioinformatics since it marked the
15th anniversary of the establishment of the journal in its current
form - with the name and current editorial organization. On this
occasion we want to recognize the exceptional contributions of
all our past Associate Editors, Editors and editorial assistants. In
particular, we want to highlight the outstanding work done by
past Editors Alex Bateman, Martin Bishop, Christos Ouzounis,
Chris Sander and Gary Stormo in organizing and consolidating
our journal during critical times in its history. In recognition of
their immense contributions we have appointed Alex, Martin,
Christos, Chris and Gary as our ﬁrst ‘Honorary Editors’. Their
advice will certainly prepare us better for the many scientific and
editorial challenges that the ﬁeld of bioinformatics is facing.

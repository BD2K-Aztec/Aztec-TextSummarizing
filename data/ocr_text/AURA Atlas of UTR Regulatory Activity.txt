ABSTRACT

Summary: The Atlas of UTR Regulatory Activity (AU RA) is a manually
curated and comprehensive catalog of human mRNA untranslated
regions (UTRs) and UTR regulatory annotations. Through its intuitive
web interface, it provides full access to a wealth of information on
UTRs that integrates phylogenetic conservation, RNA sequence and
structure data, single nucleotide variation, gene expression and gene
functional descriptions from literature and specialized databases.

1 INTRODUCTION

The 5’ and 3’ untranslated regions (UTRs) are the portions of an
mRNA located at each side of the coding sequence. UTRs contain
information for post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA, including
transport, stability, localization and access to translation, and hence
they largely determine the fate of mature mRNAs in the cell (Keene,
2007). Such events are mediated by hundreds of trans-acting factors:
primarily RNA binding proteins (RBPs), associated with all cellular
mRN As to form ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs), but also non-
coding RNAs, of which the microRNA (miRNA) class has a clear
functional role.

The experimentally determined sequence and structure binding
constraints of UTRs vary widely between and within RBPs and
non-coding RNAs, and the regulatory interactions are globally
characterized by extreme complexity, since a regulator can bind to
multiple UTRs in multiple sites and Vice versa. Moreover, the mRNA
trans—cis interaction network undergoes remarkable plasticity, since
the fate of an mRNA is determined by its temporally and spatially
dependent association to several regulators (Anderson et al., 2009).
Unraveling the molecular code behind this sophisticated process
is the key for: (i) understanding to what extent cell programs
are regulated by the degree of mRNA abundance, localization
and translation; (ii) deciphering how malfunction of trans-acting
factors or mutation of target sites is at the root of some severely
altered cellular phenotypes; (iii) identifying novel therapeutics
aimed at modulating mRNA dynamics in the window between
transport and translation. With this aim, a growing number of

studies, both mechanistic and systems-based, provide information on
factors binding to UTRs. Nevertheless, integration of these data and
annotation of UTRs in genome browsers are lacking or insufﬁcient.
The Atlas of UT R Regulatory Activity (AURA) ﬁlls this gap with
unprecedented richness and coverage, by collecting and combining
human UTR annotation and binding data from several sources.

2 DESCRIPTION AND USAGE

The increasing centrality of post-transcriptional regulation among
gene expression studies is witnessed by the recent release of
several specialized databases. RBPDB focuses on trans-acting
proteins by collecting semi-manually curated literature data about
RBPs and their demonstrated or predicted binding motifs (Cook
et al., 2011); Transterm is a regulatory sequence database that
aggregates heterogeneous lists of cis-acting motifs relevant for
post-transcriptional regulation (Jacobs et al., 2009); starBase and
CLIPZ store primary data of trans—cis interactions obtained by next-
generation high-throughput technologies (Khorshid et al., 2011).
In addition, more specialized resources allow the user to search
and analyze a limited number of particularly well-known regulatory
elements in greater detail (e. g. AREsite, Gruber et al., 2010, UTRdb
and UTRsite, Grillo et al., 2010).

Unlike these catalogs, AURA is designed to be a comprehensive
and centralized warehouse of human UTR mapped annotations,
both in terms of regulatory macromolecules and their site of
binding. AURA records non-redundant, direct and experimentally
assessed interactions of RNA binding proteins and microRNAs
with human UTRs. It contains an updated set of annotated
human UTRs (except those <5 bases) from the UCSC Genome
Browser (GRCh37/hg19 assembly), experimental literature data
(1041 publications) and consolidated information from several
specialized databases, including miRTarBase (Hsu et al., 2011),
miRecords (Xiao et al., 2009) and the aforementioned AREsite
and RBPDB resources. Currently, it covers 127 523 human UTRs,
corresponding to 63138 transcripts encoded by 19 364 protein
coding genes. An extensive comparison between AURA and related
resources can be found in File S2 in Supplementary Material.

AURA is developed according to the convention that an RBP is a
protein showing a reviewed RNA binding domain, and according to
the rule that whenever positional data on mRNA regulatory binding
sites are made available, the coordinates of each binding site are
evaluated against the current genome annotation to verify the site
lies within or overlaps the spliced UTR of a transcript.

The current AURA release provides a checked evidence of
299 393 interactions between 100 RBPs and 33 836 UTRs, of 28 351
interactions between 303 miRNAs and 5 885 UTRs and collectively

of 56 910 cis-sites over 11559 UTRs. Additional major attributes
enabling the characterization and/0r assessment of the interactions
between UTRs and trans-acting factors include synteny information
and joint Visualization of gene expression proﬁles for the interacting
partners. Furthermore, the assessment of an interaction between an
RBP and an UTR is improved by the cross-reference to the Protein
Human Atlas database (Berglund et al., 2008). A high-level schema
of the database can be found in Supplementary Figure 81.

2.1 Search

To account for the observation that a transcript can interact with
multiple RBPs as well as an RBP can interact with multiple
transcripts, AURA exhibits an intuitive interface through which the
user can query a ‘target locus’ or a ‘trans factor’, respectively. The
former query returns a list of genes whose HGNC gene symbol
or synonyms contain the searched term; each gene in the list is
annotated with its functional description, synonyms and UTRs.
Furthermore, an exon—intron map of the UTRs is provided in order
to allow proper discrimination between the different transcripts of a
gene. On the other hand, the latter query results in a disambiguation
list where all the trans-factors, whose names or synonyms contain
the searching term, are shown. To select the trans-factor of interest,
the user might beneﬁt from genes’ short descriptions and functional
summaries. Upon selection, AURA returns the list of its target UTRs.
These UTRs can be grouped by gene ontology (GO) slim categories
(http://www.geneontology.org/GO.slims.shtml) or by chromosome
mapping. Furthermore, the user can ﬁlter the results by selecting a
combination of supporting experimental evidences.

2.2 UTR View

Selected UTRs are shown in an ‘UTR View’, consisting of two
standard elements:

0 The textual header containing: the chromosomal position and
length of the spliced UTR, the HGNC name and UniProt
description of the gene the UTR belongs to, and the link to
the HPA database. Also shown are the overall conservation,
which is the mean PhastCons single nucleotide conservation
score for the UTR (Fujita et al., 2011), and the corresponding
transcript half-life according to a transcriptome—wide stability
measurement (Friedel et al., 2009).

0 The AURA sequence browser, based on the JBrowse
architecture (Skinner et al., 2009), contains all the annotations
related to a speciﬁc UTR, i.e. multiple tracks annotating the
UTR by evolutionary conservation, single nucleotide variation
and cis-regulatory binding sites. The ‘Conservation’ track
displays the score calculated for each nucleotide in the UCSC
46 species alignment (Fujita et al., 2011). In the ‘SNP’ track,
AURA integrates the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
recorded in the dbSNP database (Sherry et al., 2001), allowing
the user to combine with the other annotation tracks to look for
variations of potential impact in post-transcriptional regulation.
The ‘RBP’ track contains the REF binding sites, whereas
the ‘miR’ track contains the microRNAs binding sites. Two
further tracks are provided to show the trans-factors for which
only partial information is available. The ‘unknown mRNA
location’ track denotes the trans-factors known to bind a
transcript without any further mapping information. Instead,

the ‘unknown UTR location’ track indicates the trans-factors
whose UTR binding site is unknown. All the annotations in the
tracks are clickable: whenever the user clicks on an annotation,
a description page containing binding sites and cross-references
is shown. In this View, the minimal energy predicted secondary
structure (Fujita et al., 2011) together with the color-coded
nucleotide phylogenetic conservation, SNP locations and trans-
factor binding sites of the selected UTR can be optionally drawn
through VARNA (Darty et al., 2009).

Furthermore, AURA provides the user with multiple ways of
grouping gene expression results retrieved from the Gene Expression
Atlas (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/) and related to the gene locus of
the selected UTR. Results are reported in tables where a row
corresponds to a condition, whereas the columns, in order, show the
number of times the gene was observed to be up- or downregulated
with respect to its mean expression value and the signiﬁcance of the
measure (log10 P-Values). In case of trans-factor search, a j oint table
containing gene expression experiments for both the gene coding for
the trans-factor and the gene bearing the bound UTR is shown.
Moreover, signiﬁcant differences in common between regulator
and target are highlighted to emphasize possible correlations or
anti-correlations between them. Annotations concerning an UTR
can be extracted in textual format through the UTRCard feature;
furthermore, the whole MySQL database can be downloaded from
a dedicated page. A last way of mining the data contained in
AURA is through the AURA Mart, which is available at the website
and provides all query functionalities offered by the well-known
BioMart platform (http://www.bi0mart.0rg).

3 FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

AURA gathers data by aggregation, integration and summarization
of knowledge from scientiﬁc literature and specialized databases.
Future developments include (i) the integration of the UTR mapping
catalog according to RNA-Seq data; (ii) the enrichment of the trans-
factor catalog with long non-coding RNAs; (iii) the expansion of
the UTR regulatory annotations to include internal ribosomal entry
sites and upstream open reading frame (ORFs); (iV) the inclusion of
annotations coming from genome-wide RNAi-based gene silencing
phenotypic screens; and (V) the improvement of the search engine
as well as of the Visualization and retrieval systems.

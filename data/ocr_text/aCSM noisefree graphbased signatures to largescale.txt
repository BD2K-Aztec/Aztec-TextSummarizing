ABSTRACT

Motivation: Receptor-ligand interactions are a central phenomenon in
most biological systems. They are characterized by molecular recog-
nition, a complex process mainly driven by physicochemical and
structural properties of both receptor and ligand. Understanding and
predicting these interactions are major steps towards protein ligand
prediction, target identification, lead discovery and drug design.
Results: We propose a novel graph-based—binding pocket signature
called aCSM, which proved to be efficient and effective in handling
large-scale protein ligand prediction tasks. We compare our results
with those described in the literature and demonstrate that our algo-
rithm overcomes the competitor’s techniques. Finally, we predict
novel ligands for proteins from Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite
responsible for Chagas disease, and validate them in silico via a dock-
ing protocol, showing the applicability of the method in suggesting
ligands for pockets in a real-world scenario.

1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background

Molecular recognition plays a fundamental role in most cellular
processes. The conditions responsible for the binding and inter-
action of two or more molecules are a combination of conform-
ational and physicochemical complementarity (Kahraman et al.,
2007). Understanding the receptor-binding pocket requirements
for this recognition process is a major step towards protein
ligand prediction, target identiﬁcation, lead discovery and drug
design.

It is assumed that similar ligands have similar binding sites in
terms of shape and physicochemical properties. Several methods
were proposed to describe, compare and predict ligands with
binding pockets. However, despite the relevant contributions of
the majority of the works, methods that rely on multiple

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

structure alignments and pairwise pocket comparisons might
be prohibitively expensive for large-scale experiments. As the
availability of biological data has been growing in an exponential
fashion in the past years, scalability has become a crucial char-
acteristic for the execution of such tasks in real-world scenarios.

To overcome these challenges, we proposed a novel method-
ology for receptor-based protein ligand prediction, which is sup-
ported by a graph-based pocket signature. We extract distance
patterns from protein pockets modeling them as atomic graphs
and performing a noise and dimensionality reduction preprocess-
ing step, which granted not only an improvement in efﬁcacy in
comparison with competitors works but also scalability to the
methodology.

Atomic distance patterns perceive the structure arrangements
of the protein and, therefore, reﬂect its function. This way, using
this information to describe ligand-binding pockets is an appro-
priate strategy, given the close relationship between protein
structure and function as well as the importance of shape com-
plementarity in the molecular recognition process. Furthermore,
considering the physicochemical properties in these patterns, also
an important requirement for recognition, gives the description
power needed to successfully describe, compare and predict
protein—ligand interactions.

Receptor-binding pockets can be seen as graphs where nodes
are the protein atoms and the edges are the chemical interactions
established among them. Topological and chemical properties
can be extracted from these graphs and summarized in a molecu-
lar recognition signature. These compact signatures can then be
used in large-scale ligand prediction tasks. In this work, we
derive a novel pocket signature from the Cutoff Scanning
Matrix [CSM (Pires et al., 2011)], which is essentially a graph-
based signature successfully used for structural classiﬁcation and
function prediction tasks. We propose an atomic labeled version
of the signature (henceforth called aCSM) that is independent of
molecular orientation and does not require any ligand informa-
tion in its calculation.

Given the complexity of the recognition process, these signa-
tures are expected to be robust for ligand prediction. One of
these difﬁculties, and an important source of noise in data, is
ligand ﬂexibility, which leads to a great conformational diversity.
For instance, Figure la illustrates ﬁve representatives of nico-
tinamide—adenine dinucleotide (NAD), a highly ﬂexible ligand,
obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). They were aligned

fully explained in the next section, are presented in the same colors in
(b), considering normalized (top) and absolute values (bottom)

and their pockets calculated by a distance criterion. We can see
that the variability of conformations directly impacts on the
binding pocket size and shape. Besides that, the induced ﬁt mech-
anisms (Koshland, 1958) as well as allosteric regulations (Monod
et al., 1963) may promote expressive conformational changes in
the protein target.

Other challenging factor is the several poses adopted by
ligands in different pockets and its solvent accessibility when
bound. Figure 2 presents an example where ﬂaVin—adenine
dinucleotide (FAD) is bound to three pockets with different
degrees of solvent accessibility. It is clear that these factors
could dramatically affect pocket shape and size for the same
ligand, which may impose severe limitations to methods that
rely solely on structural alignments. In our case, it is also a con-
siderable source of noise for the proposed signatures, which are
based on atomic distance patterns.

To deal with these challenges and eliminate inherent noise, we
apply singular value decomposition (SVD)-based noise and
dimensionality reduction strategy. A detailed description about
the technique as well as references can be found in
Supplementary Material. Figure lb presents the proposed signa-
tures for the NAD-binding sites before noise reduction. We can
see that, despite the similarity in the curves proﬁle, we still see a
considerable variability among them that is reduced by the data
normalization achieved after SVD preprocessing. This prepro-
cessing step is essential to extract from the original signatures,

the components that are the most important to describe the
pockets discarding redundancy and non-conserved dimensions.

1.2 Related works

To describe protein pockets to either compare them and /or predict
their ligands, several methods have been proposed in the litera-
ture. Some of them are based on a paradigm of pocket similarity
metrics. In the study conducted by Davies et al. (2007), the authors
introduced a matching score for binding sites based on a prob-
abilistic model and compared their metric with the Tanimoto
index. Protein-binding pockets were compared by spherical har-
monic decompositions (Morris et al., 2005), technique also used in
a study of their shape variation (Kahraman et al., 2007). More
recently, in a study conducted by (Hoffmann et al., 2010), the
authors proposed a method to quantify pocket similarity by rep-
resenting them as clouds of atoms and comparing the resulting
alignments with a convolution kernel. A measure of similarity was
also derived in a recent work (Ueno et al., 2012) from radial dis-
tribution functions of physicochemical properties of catalytic
sites, information that was then used to cluster enzymes by func-
tion. In the study conducted by Goncalves-Almeida et al. (2012),
pockets are compared using hydrophobic patches represented by
geometric centroids, and their conservation is detected despite
sequence and structure dissimilarity.

Another set of methods attempts to compare ligand-binding
sites based on multiple alignments. Similarity metrics were derived
from the alignments of binding sites or cavity ﬁngerprints repre-
sented by its physicochemical or topological properties in the
studies conducted by Shulman-Peleg et al. (2008) and Schalon
et al. (2008), whereas Spitzer et a]. (2011) proposed a surface-
based approach. There are also efforts that use multiple graph
alignments and clique-based matching algorithms (W eskamp
et al., 2007; Najmanovich et al., 2008) to perceive receptor-ligand
interactions. Other alternative approaches in the study of binding
mechanism include the use of docking and quantitative structure—
actiVity relationships techniques (QSARs) (Sippl, 2000).

1.3 Summary of results

We showed the proposed signatures successfully deal with the
challenging aspects of large-scale ligand prediction achieving an
area under ROC curve (AUC) of 0.92 for a dataset composed by
>35 000 enzyme pockets. As far as we are concerned, no other
method was tested with a dataset of comparable volume. Despite
the prominent variability of NAD, our methodology was able to
retrieve their pockets with an AUC up to 0.96. We recovered as

well FAD sites presenting molecules with different solvent acces-
sibilities achieving an AUC of 0.99. When compared with
state-of-the-art methods, our approach achieves comparable or
better results. Finally, we present a case study where we predict
novel ligands for proteins from T rypcmosoma cruzi, the parasite
responsible for Chagas disease and validate them in silico via a
docking protocol showing the applicability of the method in a
real-world scenario.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

In this section, we explain the basis for deﬁning our noise-free graph
signatures, describe the datasets used in the experiments and explain
the evaluation strategies. First, we describe the CSM method. Our strat-
egy to reduce noise and dimensionality turning aCSM precise and robust
as well as scalable to large datasets is explained in detail in Supplementary
Material as well as how the classiﬁcation algorithms used work and why
they were chosen. Finally, we explain how the method was validated.
Details about the used quality measures are also available in
Supplementary Material. Figure 3 shows the aCSM-based ligand predic-
tion workﬂow. It is divided into the following main steps: data collection,
signature generation and noise/dimensionality reduction, supervised
learning, ligand prediction and validation. A more detailed workﬂow
can be found in Supplementary Figure S1.

2.1 aCSM-based signatures

CSM is a protein structural signature proposed by Pires et a]. (2011) and
successfully used in large-scale protein function prediction and structural
classiﬁcation tasks. The original CSM workﬂow generates, for each pro-
tein, a feature vector that represents distance patterns between protein
residues represented by centroids, which are then used as evidence for the
classiﬁcation procedures. To reduce noise as well as data dimensionality,
SVD (Demmel, 1997) was used as a preprocessing step.

Although other dimensionality reduction methods may be used,
Supplementary Figure S2 shows that two well-established feature selec-
tion approaches were less effective than SVD in reducing noise and
dimensionality of the data and, thus, improving classiﬁcation
performance.

Inter-residue distance patterns were also subject of study of our pre-
vious study (da Silveira et al., 2009) and showed to be conserved across
protein folds.

In the present work, we extend the inter-residue signature to an atomic
level (atomic CSM or aCSM for short). The aCSM-based signatures are
generated as follows: for each protein, we create a feature vector. First,
we compute the Euclidean distance between all pairs of atoms and deﬁne
a range of distances (cut-offs) to be considered and a distance step. We
scan through these distances, computing the frequency of pairs of atoms
that are close according to this distance threshold, i.e. the atoms in
contact.

Furthermore, we propose in this work three new different types of
aCSM-based signatures using atomic physicochemical properties.

0 aCSM: generates one value per cut-off, corresponding to the number
of atoms in contact according to this distance threshold.

0 aCSM-Hydrophobic patche (HP): generates three values per cut-off,
i.e. the frequency of hydrophobic—hydrophobic, hydrophobic—polar
and polar—polar contacts.

0 aCSM-ALL: considers eight categories: hydrophobic, positive, nega-
tive, acceptor, donor, aromatic, sulfur and neutral. The combination
of these atoms labels generates 36 values per cut-off. The atoms
classiﬁcation was obtained by the program PMapper at pH 7.

PMapper perceives pharmacophoric properties of atoms in a given
molecular structures.

Algorithm 1 shows the function that calculates the atomic version of
CSM. To compute a signature, one must supply the following input
parameters: a set of proteins and the atomic categories to be considered,
a cut-off range (DMIN and DMAX) and a cut-off step (DSTEP) in which
each cut-off is discretized. In line 1, we deﬁne the prototype of the aCSM
function. In line 2, we iterate through each i of the proteins of the input
dataset. Line 3 shows the initialization of a variable used to index the
signature array. In line 4, we call a function that computes the pairwise
distances between all pairs of atoms of a protein and return and store
these data in distMatrix. The loop in line 5 controls the iterations used to
scan the distMatrix to compute the signature. In line 6, we iterate through
the considered atom classes, and ﬁnally in lines 7—8, we call a function
that computes the frequency of contacts for the current distance, between
atoms of the given classes and store it in the corresponding signature
array position. The aCSM generation runs in quadratic time, i.e. has
time complexity of 0(n2), where n is the number of atoms of the
pocket, because of the pairwise distance computation. It is important
to point out that the method is easily parallelizable, an important and
desired characteristic for its efﬁcient use in multi-core processor
architectures.

In the experiments presented in this work, we vary the distance thresh-
old from DM1N=0.0A to DMAX=30.0 A, with a DSTEP=0.2 A, which
generated for each type of signature a vector of 151, 453 and 5436 entries
for each protein. In Supplementary Figure S3, one can see through the
pocket diameter distribution that 30.0 A accounts to ~95% of the pock-
ets of the extensive enzyme dataset.

The aCSM might also be presented as a graph-based signature, as the
information regarding each cut-off distance represents the number of
edges of an atomic contact graph assembled considering this cut-off.
Notice also the method generality, as it can be applied to predict both
proteic and non-proteic ligands.

2.2 Evaluation methodology

We evaluate the proposed method and compared it with other
state-of—the-art algorithms using cross-validation computed metrics,
especially AUC.

Cross-validation: is a traditional statistical analysis used to estimate the
performance of predictive models. It consists of partitioning the dataset
into two complementary subsets. The ﬁrst is the training set used to build
the model. The other is the test set used to measure the validity of the
model. The dataset is partitioned, and the metrics are averaged over all
the rounds. We use 10-fold cross-validation in all the experiments, but the
comparative ones. For comparisons, we use leave-one-out cross-valid-
ation because this was the technique used by competitor’s works.

AUC: is the area under ROC curve. ROC curves are explained in more
detail in Supplementary Material. They provide a visual tool for examin-
ing the trade-off between the ability of a classiﬁer to correctly identify
positive cases and the number of negative cases that are incorrectly clas-
siﬁed. An interesting feature of these curves is that the AUC can be used

2.3 Data

2.3.] Datasets To support multiple types of experiments to validate
our methods quality, generality and real-world applicability, we used
four different databases with different purposes:

(a) Large-scale enzyme dataset: In a previous work (Pires et al., 2011)
we have proposed a dataset of the top 950 most-populated Enzyme
Commission (EC) numbers, in terms of available structures, with
at least nine representatives per class, concerning 55 474 chains.
This dataset consists of reviewed enzymes from UniProt, i.e. the
experimentally validated annotations from that database. Only lig-
ands with seven or more atoms were considered, and also the
pockets with <10 atoms were discarded. A total of 35 480 pockets
were generated for 604 different ligands, with at least 10 represen-
tatives per ligand. This dataset is used to show the applicability of
the method for very diverse real-world large enzyme database.

(b) Kahraman dataset: proposed by Kahraman et al. (2007), it com-
prises 100 protein-binding sites that are non-evolutionary related,
X-ray—solved, complexed with 10 different ligands with various
sizes and ﬂexibility (namely, AMP, ATP, PO4, GLC, FAD,
HEM, FMN, EST, AND, NAD). This dataset is used in compari-
sons of our method and its competitors.

(c) Hoffmann Homogeneous dataset (HD): proposed by Hoffmann
et al. (2010), it is formed by 100 protein pockets complexed with
10 different ligands of similar size and was assembled by the au-
thors to complement the Kahraman dataset, as it has ligands of
different volumes. This dataset is also used to compare our method
with its competitors.

((1) T rypanosoma cruzi dataset: composed of T .cruzi proteins. The cri-
teria adopted for the protein selection was proteins solved by
X-ray crystallography, with resolution <2.5A. A total of 104
PDB IDs, comprising 200 chains, were gathered. We used a 5A
distance criteria to deﬁne the pockets. After removing crystallo-
graphic artifacts, 225 pockets were selected. This dataset is used to
raise candidate ligands, using the aCSM signatures, and validate
them via a docking protocol.

2.3.2 Data preprocessing All protein structures were collected from
PDB, ﬁltered and preprocessed using the PDBest toolkit. The proteins
chains were split in separate ﬁles, and the binding pockets for each ligand
were extracted.

2.3.3 Pocket computation Ligand pockets were extracted from pro-
tein structures in two ways:

0 Distance criterion: considering a distance of 5A, i.e. only atoms
within 5A from the ligand were selected. This criterion was used
by the competitor’s works.

0 Geometric criterion: we compared the efﬁcacy of two geometric
methods in deﬁning pockets, namely, the grid-based method that
uses mathematical morphology, implemented by Ghecom
(Kawabata, 2010), and the method based on oz—shapes theory imple-
mented by FPocket (Le Guilloux et al., 2009). In both cases, we
chose the pocket that has the closest atom from the ligand, i.e. the
pocket that probably is more in contact with it.

3 RESULTS

To test and validate the ability of our signature to describe bind-
ing sites to support and aid in protein—ligand interaction predic-
tion tasks, we designed an extensive set of experiments. First, we
show our method can be used in large-scale ligand prediction and
evaluate its precision in doing this task. Then, we compare the
three proposed versions of aCSM signatures and evaluate which
one presents the best descriptive power to ligand prediction.
After that, we present the comparative results concerning
state-of-the-art methods described in the literature and its
respective datasets. Finally, we apply our methodology to pock-
ets of T .cruzi proteins and predict ligands to them, comparing the
binding free energies of the ligands docked with receptors with
those of real complexes available at the PDB, via a redocking
protocol, and with ligands randomly chosen.

3.1 Large-scale experiments

Figure 4 presents the AUC of our method for the large-scale
enzyme dataset composed of reviewed enzymes from UniProt
from which >35 000 pockets were extracted. We can see that
the methods successfully predicted ligands in every type of ex-
periment described with precisions going from 0.6 to 0.92. In the
next sections, we explain the variations of the method that
generated the results showed in the ﬁgure.

3.1.1 Signature types evaluation In the left-hand graph of
Figure 4, we compare aCSM, aCSM-HP and aCSM-ALL in
terms of their AUC achieved with different number of singular
values used to approximate the original matrix.

In one hand, we can see that the more speciﬁc the signature is,
in terms of physicochemical atom properties, the more precise it
is in ligand prediction. With 100 singular values, for pockets
extracted via a distance criterion (three upper curves), aCSM-
ALL reaches an AUC of 0.92 as the basic aCSM presents an
AUC of 0.75. On the other hand, with <20 singular values, the

Fig. 4. Comparative prediction performance, in terms of the AUC metric, between two methods for deﬁning the pocket: Ghecom (green shades/three
lower curves) and threshold distance (blue shades/three upper curves). For each method, the performance of the three signatures types proposed is also
compared. The large-scale enzyme dataset was used in this experiment, as well as the KNN classiﬁer. The right-hand graph shows the relative norm for
different dimensionality cut-offs as a metric to assess the quality of the data approximation provided by SVD. The low values of the relative norm at the
maximum values of AUC indicate that the low-rank matrices approximate the original data well

difference between the different signatures is almost null reaching
a high AUC score of 0.85.

It is interesting to notice that aCSM-ALL is the only one that
seems to have beneﬁted from the addition of many singular
values. The ﬁrst singular values respond to the higher data vari-
ability and are the most informative ones. As long as we add
singular values to the signature, we add more and more noise to
data, as well as we demand more computational time. These
results show that aCSM presents an intrinsic limitation when
20 singular values are used, and a pick of AUC of ~0.86 is
achieved. aCSM-HP reaches >0.90 with ~40 singular values.
aCSM-ALL AUC is improved when we add successive singular
values, and it does not converge until 100 singular values. It
could indicate the absence of noise when we label atoms in
such a speciﬁc way.

It is worth mentioning that the maximum value of AUC for
the aCSM-ALL signatures occurs when 177 singular values are
used (0.924). However, this improvement in AUC is marginal
compared with the increase in computational cost.

To assess the quality of the data approximation provided by
SVD, we measured the relative norm for each number of singular
values being considered (right-hand graph of Fig. 4). The 2-norm
can be used to measure the relative difference ,0], between the
reduced matrix Ak and the original matrix A. Considering the
Theorem 1 from Supplementary Data and that the spectral norm
||A||2 is, simply, the ﬁrst (largest) singular value of A, i.e.
||A||2 = 01, thus:

_ IIA —Ak||2

0‘
pk— —ﬂ. (1)

Mpk _
llAll2 01

Supplementary Table S2 shows the relative norm (1) at the
maximum values of AUC for signatures 5A-aCSM,
5A-aCSM-HP and 5A-aCSM-ALL. These small values of ,0],
indicate that the low-rank matrix Ak approximates signiﬁcantly
the original data matrix A.

Supplementary Table S1 shows the comparison of the three
proposed signatures, for the large-scale enzyme dataset, in terms
of several quality measures, as well as in terms of mean execution
time. The best results were achieved by aCSM-HP and

aCSM-ALL after SVD preprocessing. aCSM-ALL is slightly
better in terms of accuracy, even though it takes twice the time
to run in comparison with aCSM-HP. In conclusion,
aCSM-ALL is the better choice being the most accurate and
having a non-prohibitive execution time.

3.1.2 Pocket detection method inﬂuence Figure 4 also shows the
comparison of the aCSM signatures computed for pockets de-
limited using distance and geometric criterion (three lower
curves). We can see that using the geometric method, the results
are systematically ~12% worse than simply with distance cri-
teria. This is probably because of loss of important molecular
information when using Ghecom algorithm.

There is, in fact, a big difference in using a geometric criterion
to detect pockets rather than using experimental data from com-
plexes, as automatically detecting pockets is still challenging.
Nevertheless, we believe that one of the main contributions of
this work is the improvement in similarity assessment provided
by aCSM when structures of complexes are available.

Even if we aggregate more atoms than the ones that were in
fact accessible in the pocket with SA cut-off, our method be-
haves robustly, being able to discard unnecessary or irrelevant
information. Supplementary Figure S4 shows that for cut-off
distances >5 A, the predictive performance of our method
increases.

We use 5A as a cut-off criterion because it was the same
adopted by the competitors works. However, this value seemed
to be deﬁned arbitrarily and not necessarily reﬂects the best pos-
sible cut-off for every method. To evaluate this hypothesis, we
contrast our signature performance according to pocket distance
criterion for the large-scale enzyme dataset. In fact, in
Supplementary Figure S5, we show that the best distance criter-
ion for the aCSM signature, using the K-nearest neighbor algo-
rithm (KNN) classiﬁer, was actually 6.0 A. This value is in
agreement with other authors who also have investigated about
the best atomic cut-off when the network of contacts is computed
using a heavy atom proximity criterion (Zhang et al., 1997;
Kamagata and Kuwajima, 2006). It is important to stress that

with this cut-off, we have minimum noise in our signatures, as
the best performing SVD cut-off is chosen.

3.2 Comparison with state-of—the—art methods

The experiments described later in the text were performed in
two datasets (Hoﬂmann HD and Kahraman) already used by
several related studies to compare them with our protein
pocket signature aCSM. Leave-one-out cross-validation was
used in all experiments regarding these two datasets; the same
methodology was used in the related works.

Table 1 summarizes the results obtained. The aCSM signature
achieved better results, considering the AUC score, in compari-
son with the other methods with low standard deviation. It is
important to stress that leave-one—out cross-validation is compu-
tationally demanding and not suitable for a large-scale real-
world scenario. Moreover, the two aforementioned datasets are
small (only 100 pockets) and, in the case of the Kahraman
dataset, divided into unbalanced classes, which makes the
learning process of the classiﬁers difﬁcult.

3.3 Case study: predicting ligands for T .cruzi proteins

Chagas disease is a tropical infection caused by the protozoan
parasite T .cruzi that affects ~8 million people in Latin America
(Rassi et al., 2010) and is the leading etiology of non-ischemic
heart disease worldwide. Unfortunately, the two available drugs
for treatment (Nifurtimox and Benznidazole) have potential
toxic side effects and variable efﬁcacy (Canavaci et al., 2010).
The limitation of the current available treatment and interven-
tions has been motivating several efforts towards the develop-
ment of new drugs or a vaccine against T .cruzi. In fact, a recent
study (Lee et al., 2010) proposed a decision analytic Markov
model that indicated that such vaccine could provide a substan-
tial economic beneﬁt. Some recent approaches to this problem
described in the literature include screening efforts aiming

The aCSM-ALL was the best performing signature for these experiments. AUC

and the results for the aCSM signature were generated using multinomial logistic
regression.

inhibitors for T .cruzi known targets and development of high-
throughput assays to validate anti- T .cruzi compounds (Canavaci
et al., 2010).

In this section, we used trained classiﬁcation models to predict
potential novel ligands to T .cruzi proteins with structures avail-
able at the PDB.

After an extensive analysis of the proposed signatures, we se-
lected the best performing model trained in the biggest datasets
considered (>35 000 pockets). The pockets obtained from the
T .cruzi proteins were tested against this model, and a single
ligand was predicted for each pocket. The KNN algorithm was
used.

To validate the predictions, we performed the docking of the
ligands in the T .cruzi pockets using AUTODOCK. We compare
the energies of binding of the predicted ligands with the ones
from real ligands from the crystallographic complexes via a
redocking protocol. To assess the methods statistical signiﬁ-
cance, we compared our results with a null model. We selected
for each pocket three independent random/null ligands from the
pool of the training dataset. The docking workﬂow adopted in
the present work is shown in Supplementary Figure S7.

In Figure 5, we can see that the energy distribution for aCSM
predictions is more similar in shape to the redocking energy pro-
ﬁle than the proﬁle of the null models. Paired t-tests reveal a high
P—value (0.26) between aCSM prediction and redocking means,
but a low P—value (1.2e‘9) for aCSM prediction and null models.
This strongly suggests that ligands found by aCSM may have the
same binding free-energy proﬁle of redocking ligands, but they
may differ signiﬁcantly from null ligands.

In summary, we showed that the binding free-energies for lig-
ands predicted by aCSM are better (lower) in comparison with
those predicted by the null models. Furthermore, the energies
from a redocking protocol are indistinguishable from those
obtained for aCSM prediction.

4 CONCLUSIONS

In the present work we proposed a novel, scalable, graph-based
pocket signature called aCSM. It prospects distance patterns
from the atoms that compose the binding pockets generating a
feature vector that represents a cumulative edge count of contact
graphs deﬁned for different cut-off distances, which are used as
evidence by supervised learning algorithms. SVD is also used as a
preprocessing step to reduce dimensionality, lessen computa-
tional costs and grant scalability to the methodology and also
reducing the inherent noise of the data, which increased the suc-
cess rate of the predictions. Some of the most remarkable advan-
tages of the aCSM signatures are that it does not require any
ligand information in its calculation and also is independent of
molecular orientation. Additionally, our algorithm presents a
notable signature generality, as it may be applied to predict
both proteic and non-proteic ligands to any type of biomolecular
target (not only protein).

aCSM was successful when applied in ligand prediction tasks,
presenting compatible or superior efﬁcacy in comparison with
state-of-the-art competitors. Besides, as a requirement and
demand for its application to databases that are continuously
growing, it proved scalable for large-scale scenarios and was
able to perform well in a dataset composed by >35 000 pockets.

Fig. 5. Comparison of binding free-energies distribution of the docked complexes for aCSM prediction, redocking and null models. Dashed lines indicate
the mean values, and the student t-test P—values for the signiﬁcance of the means are also presented. Binding free energies for ligands predicted by aCSM
are lower (better) in comparison with those predicted by the null models and indistinguishable from those obtained via a redocking protocol

On top of that, we applied the methodology to predict potential
novel inhibitors to T .cruzi proteins. The validation of this step
via docking conﬁrmed that inhibitors predicted represent good
candidates for further experimental validation.

We intend to predict inhibitors for proteins from other patho-
genic organisms of interest, a study already in progress in our
group. Finally, we plan to expand the signature to ligand-based
lead discovery.

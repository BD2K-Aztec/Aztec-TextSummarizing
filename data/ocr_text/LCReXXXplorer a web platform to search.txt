Abstract

Motivation: Local compositionally biased and low complexity regions (LCRs) in amino acid se-
quences have initially attracted the interest of researchers due to their implication in generating
artifacts in sequence database searches. There is accumulating evidence of the biological signifi-
cance of LCRs both in physiological and in pathological situations. Nonetheless, LCR-related algo-
rithms and tools have not gained wide appreciation across the research community, partly due to
the fact that only a handful of user-friendly software is currently freely available.

Results: We developed LCR-eXXXplorer, an extensible online platform attempting to fill this gap.
LCR-eXXXplorer offers tools for displaying LCRs from the UniProt/SwissProt knowledgebase, in
combination with other relevant protein features, predicted or experimentally verified. Moreover,
users may perform powerful queries against a custom designed sequence/LCR-centric database.
We anticipate that LCR-eXXXplorer will be a useful starting point in research efforts for the elucida-
tion of the structure, function and evolution of proteins with LCRs.

Availability and implementation: LCR-eXXXplorer is freely available at the URL http://repeat.biol.

1 Introduction

 

During the past 30 years, the main focus of research related to re-
gions of local compositional extremes (low complexity regions;
LCRs) was their identification for the purpose of sequence masking
(Altschul et al., 1994; Wootton and Federhen, 1993; Ye et al., 2006)
for eliminating spurious hits in database searches (Promponas et al.,
2000; Tsoka et al., 1999). Several studies have been published show-
casing the abundance and importance of such regions at the molecu-
lar/structural (e.g. Radivojac et al., 2006; Tamana et al., 2012),
functional (e.g. Andrade et al., 2001; Haerty and Golding, 2010),
organismic (e.g. Miskinyte et al., 2013; Pizzi and Frontali, 2001)
and habitat level (e.g. Nandi et al., 2003). Despite the apparent

biological importance of LCRs there’s a distinct lack of tools or ser-
vices capable of helping biologists to study them in depth. Most of
the methods capable of detecting LCRs were developed for the sole
purpose of masking them and are meant to be used from the com-
mand line as part of a sequence analysis or search pipeline. While
some tools, such as SEG (Wootton and Federhen, 1993),
CAST (Promponas et al., 2000) or BIAS (Kuznetsov and Hwang,
2006) do offer more advanced reports as an option, their results are
mostly meant to be parsed by a computer software and not a
biologist.

In this work, we present LCR-eXXXplorer, an online service to
search, visualize and share LCRs in protein sequences. We highlight

its unique features that may facilitate research efforts towards
understanding the biological roles of proteins with LCRs.

2 Functionality

2.1 General description

LCR-eXXXplorer is built upon a customized instance of GBrowse
(Stein et al., 2002) modified to properly work with protein se-
quences. It currently contains 545000 sequences (retrieved from
UniProt/SwissProt) annotated with over 16 million LCR-related an-
notations. Along with information about sequence complexity,
LCR-eXXXplorer displays external annotations from UniProt, as
well as predicted disordered and binding regions by utilizing
IUPRED (Dosztanyi et al., 2005) and ANCHOR (Dosztanyi et al.,
2009; Mészaros et al., 2009) respectively. Data are stored in a
MySQL database, using a database schema based on the Sequature
schema internally used by GBrowse (see Supplementary Methods
and Supplementary Fig. S1).

2.2 Key functionality

A basic keyword-based search functionality (allowing wildcards) is
available for retrieving protein sequences with matching UniProtKB
Accession(s)/Entry Name(s) or gene name(s). Moreover, the
‘Advanced Search’ option (specifically implemented for this process
as a custom-made GBrowse plug-in) facilitates more fine-tuned
queries. Using the basic search mode, users are able to retrieve up to
500 entries using simple keyword search (e.g. with a single UniProt
identifier or accession number). An ‘Advanced Search’ may be initi-
ated by querying a suitable combination of UniProt fields (e.g. gene
or protein name, source organism) or LCR properties (e.g. type of
LCR, percent of masked residues)—yet, only the AND Boolean op-
erator is currently supported for combining search criteria. Under
this mode, batch search functionality is also available using a list of
UniProt accession numbers: this feature enables users to take advan-
tage of the powerful UniProt search engine and come up with a list
of entries specifying complex search criteria. Results can be
displayed in the browser (with a limit of 15 000 entries) or
downloaded in a plain text tab-delimited formatted file providing
statistics on the LCR content for further processing (with a limit
of 50 000 entries). Different options of masking protein sequences
are provided for each individual sequence from the graphical
GBrowse ‘protein details’ view and sequences are available in
FASTA format.

The Downloads section offers LCR-eXXXplorer the option of
downloading the complete set of sequences in FASTA formatted files
masked for LCRs, the complete set of annotations in GFF3 format
or a CSV formatted table with LCR statistics for each sequence in
the database.

Users may also search for data in LCR-eXXXplorer using
BLASTP (Ye et al., 2006) powered by the user-friendly
SequenceServer (Priyam et al., manuscript in preparation). Three
underlying databases (unmasked, SEG or CAST masking with de-
fault parameters) are provided, with the masked databases being a
unique feature of this service; this configuration is shown to improve
database search results (Kirmitzoglou, 2014; Kirmitzoglou et al., in
preparation). Furthermore, users may initiate BLASTP searches
against the sequence databases hosted at the NCBI web servers
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) using as input query the currently
displayed sequence; several options of applying masking using any

combination of amino acid residue types and detection algorithm
are available.

The main strength of LCR-eXXXplorer—setting it apart from
similar services—is its visualization capabilities. Displaying LCRs
in a protein sequence is more informative when information regard-
ing other functional or structural features is also shown
(Supplementary Fig. 52). By taking advantage of the underlying
GBrowse capability to display features stored on a remote web ac-
cessible server, LCR-eXXXplorer incorporates selected annotations
from UniProt into the main browser interface. UniProt annotations
displayed in LCR-eXXXplorer are of two major types: (i) general
annotations associated with the protein sequence (e.g. protein name,
gene ontology terms, PDB accession IDs) and (ii) position-specific
annotations, which may include domains, sites, secondary structure
etc. These annotations are fetched from UniProt/SwissProt on-the-
ﬂy for the protein sequence of interest. This is facilitated by a cus-
tom-designed cgi-bin script and the retrieved features are further
post-processed to a format suitable for the LCR-eXXXplorer.

Using the same underlying mechanism, LCR-eXXXplorer can
display tracks generated by another instance of GBrowse, a
Distributed Annotation System (DAS) server or valid GFF3 files gen-
erated by the user. The only requirement is that the remote tracks
must use the same coordinates system, which in the case of
LCR-eXXXplorer is the protein sequence itself. Thus, users may
practically display results from any LCR-detection tool (or any other
protein sequence analysis tool) alongside the data provided by
LCR-eXXXplorer.

2.3 Comparison to similar services

Two services for providing access to protein sequence LCR-related
data are currently available online. The one most closely related to
LCR-eXXXplorer is LPS-annotate (Harbi et al., 2011), which iden-
tifies LCRs based on the LPS algorithm (Harrison and Gerstein,
2003), compared to SEG. These LCR annotations are accompanied
with disordered region predictions by DISOPRED (Buchan et al.,
2010). Even though LPS-annotate is an invaluable resource for re-
searchers interested in compositionally biased proteins, its main
drawback is the lack of any effective visualization options.
Moreover, the underlying database (according to data available at
the LPS-annotate website) has not been updated since 2009.
Recently, the HRaP server (Lobanov et al., 2014) was developed,
specializing in the study of homopolymeric repeats, which
comprise a highly specialized case of LCRs, thus it is not further
discussed herein. A detailed presentation of web-based services pro-
viding information related to LCRs is presented in Kirmitzoglou
(2014)

3 Future Developments

The current version of the LCR-eXXXplorer web server offers sev-
eral tools for facilitating research on proteins with LCRs, including
BLAST search and interactive visualization by exploiting inherent
GBrowse features. Given the genuine interest of our research group
in LCR-containing proteins, we plan to expand this service in the
near future.

More specifically, we are in the process of automating the LCR-
eXXXplorer update procedure to regularly synchronize with
UniProt updates. Moreover, the customizations performed on differ-
ent GBrowse modules require some additional work (and appropri-
ate documentation) for enabling full programmatic access to our
service through the REST interface already available for GBrowse.

An important improvement destined for the next version of LCR-
eXXXplorer is enabling full support of Boolean queries against
fields in the underlying database. The modular (both in terms of
data and software) architecture of LCR-eXXXplorer enables easy
incorporation of novel datasets (e.g. complete genome sequences)
and LCR detection tools in future versions.

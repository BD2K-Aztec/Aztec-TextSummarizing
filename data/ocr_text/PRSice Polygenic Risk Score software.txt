Abstract

Summary: A polygenic risk score (PRS) is a sum of trait—associated alleles across many genetic loci,
typically weighted by effect sizes estimated from a genome—wide association study. The application
of PRS has grown in recent years as their utility for detecting shared genetic aetiology among traits
has become appreciated; PRS can also be used to establish the presence of a genetic signal in under—
powered studies, to infer the genetic architecture of a trait, for screening in clinical trials, and can act
as a biomarker for a phenotype. Here we present the first dedicated PRS software, PRSice (‘precise’),
for calculating, applying, evaluating and plotting the results of PRS. PRSice can calculate PRS at a
large number of thresholds ("high resolution") to provide the best—fit PRS, as well as provide results
calculated at broad P—value thresholds, can thin Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) according
to linkage disequilibrium and P—value or use all SNPs, handles genotyped and imputed data, can cal—
culate and incorporate ancestry—informative variables, and can apply PRS across multiple traits in a
single run. We exemplify the use of PRSice via application to data on schizophrenia, major depres—
sive disorder and smoking, illustrate the importance of identifying the best—fit PRS and estimate a
P—value significance threshold for high—resolution PRS studies.

Availability and implementation: PRSice is written in R, including wrappers for bash data manage—
ment scripts and PLlNK—1.9 to minimize computational time. PRSice runs as a command—line pro—
gram with a variety of user—options, and is freely available for download from http://PRSice.info

1 Introduction

 

The polygenic model of human phenotypes has long been
hypothesized, but only in recent years have the results from genome—
wide association study (GWAS) revealed that much of the genetic
basis for most complex traits comprises small effects of hundreds or
even thousands of variants. For clinical outcomes, this polygenic ef-
fect can be considered a genetic liability to disease risk. While pre-
diction of phenotype from an individual’s genetic profile is
compromised by this polygenicity, the application of polygenic risk
scores (PRS) has shown that prediction is sufficiently accurate for a
number of applications.

A PRS for an individual is a summation of their genotypes at
variants genome—wide, weighted by effect sizes on a trait of interest.
Effect sizes are typically estimated from published GWAS results,

and only variants exceeding a P—value threshold, PT, are included
(Dudbridge, 2013). Since even large GWAS achieve only marginal
evidence for association for many causal variants, PRS are usually
calculated at a set of P—value thresholds, e.g. PT : 1 x 10—5,
1 x 10—4, . . . , 0.05, 0.1, . . . , 0.5. A common application of PRS is to
test for shared genetic aetiology between traits. Here PRS on the
base phenotype are calculated, using GWAS results, in individuals
from an independent data set, and these are used as predictors of the
target phenotype in a regression (see Supplementary Note S1). This
technique was first applied by the International Schizophrenia
Consortium (2009), demonstrating that genetic risk for
schizophrenia (SCZ) is a predictor of bipolar disorder. This study
also acted as a proof—of—principle for PRS, showing that PRS based
on thousands of common variants genome—wide, including many

with no effect and using effect size estimates from published GWAS,
can provide a reliable indicator of genetic liability. This has moti-
vated several other applications, including polygenic Mendelian
Randomisation (Hung et al., 2014), where causality of potential
intermediate phenotypes in a disease pathway can be tested (Ehret
et al., 2011), use of PRS as biomarkers, and the enrolment of clinical
trial participants according to risk (Hu et al., 2013).

Here we describe the first dedicated and fully automated soft—
ware package for the application of PRS — PRSice. PRSice has a
high—resolution option that returns the best—fit PRS, has a ﬂexible set
of user options intended to capture current standard practices in
PRS studies and the different applications of PRS, and produces
plots for inspection of results. We also perform a simulation study
to estimate a P—value significance threshold for high-resolution PRS
studies.

2 Overview of PRSice

PRSice has been developed to fully automate PRS analyses, substan—
tially expanding the capability of PUNK—1.9 (Chang et al., 2014). A
key feature of PRSice is that it can calculate PRS at any number of
P—value thresholds (PT) and can thus identify the most predictive
(precise) threshold. It requires only GWAS results on a base pheno-
type and genotype data on a target phenotype as input (base and tar—
get phenotype may be the same); it outputs PRS for each individual
and figures depicting the PRS model fit at a range of PT. PRSice
allows users to include or remove SNPs in linkage disequilibrium,
handles genotyped and imputed data, and can calculate ancestry—in—
formative dimensions for use as covariates. These features integrate
R code with computations performed in PUNK—1.9 and extensive
bash scripts to minimize computational time. PRSice is a command—
line program that allows users to apply a large number of PRS,
under different parameter settings or across multiple base and target
traits. In addition to the standard approach, there is an option to use
summary statistics for the target as well as the base data, using the
gtx package (Johnson, 2013). For future updates of PRSice, see the
website: http://PRSice.info.

3 Results

Here we illustrate the use of PRSice to test for shared genetic aeti—
ology between traits. We first investigate the genetic relationship be—
tween schizophrenia (SCZ) and major depressive disorder (MDD),
both known to be complex and comorbid. We apply PRSice to repli—
cate the finding by Smoller et al. (2013) that SCZ PRS can predict
MDD status, using the RADIANT—UK MDD case—control data set
(Supplementary Note 82, Lewis et al., 2010). Applying PRSice, we
remove SNPs in linkage disequilibrium and include principal com-
ponents to control for population structure. We find significant evi-
dence that SCZ PRS predict MDD status, and under the approach of
only testing PRS at several broad P—value thresholds find the most
predictive threshold at PT: 0.05 (Fig. 1). Next we repeat the ana—
lysis using high-resolution PRS (Supplementary Note S3) and find
the most predictive PRS at PT : 0.0265 (Fig. 2). The PRS at
PT : 0.05 explains 1.5% of the variation in MDD (Nagelkerke R2;
P : 1.3 x 10—9) whereas the high—resolution best—fit PRS explains
2.1% (P = 2.1 x 10—12) and is based on 5252 fewer SNPs (12148
rather than 17400).

Next we apply PRSice to two tobacco—related phenotypes from
the TAG consortium (Thorgeirsson et al., 2013) and the RADIANT-
UK MDD data. These analyses reveal, for the first time, shared

genetic aetiology between the dichotomous trait ‘ever smoked’ and
MDD, but not between smoking consumption, as a quantitative
trait, and MDD (Supplementary Fig. S1). In the former, high-reso-
lution scoring again produces a substantially different best—fit PRS
than that from broad PT, in terms of model fit, significance and
number of SNPs included (Supplementary Fig. 81b).

Under high-resolution PRS in particular, multiple tests are
performed and so the P—value of the best—fit PRS will be inflated.
Therefore, we perform a permutation study utilizing the SCZ and
MDD data described above, and estimate an adjusted significance
threshold for the best—fit PRS of P=0.004 (Supplementary Note
S4). Prior to a more extensive study, we suggest a more conservative
significance threshold of P=0.001 if using the best—fit PRS for
association testing in PRS studies.

4 Discussion

Here we have described our PRSice software, illustrating its use with
three PRS studies. We have illustrated the potential benefit of ob—
taining the best—fit PRS and have estimated a corresponding signifi-
cance threshold. There is great potential for the future application of
PRS in genetics: for gaining insights into the genetic architecture of a
trait by comparing observed PRS with theoretical expectations
across a range of PT (International Schizophrenia Consortium,
2009), for assessing the genetic overlap of a trait(s) across popula—
tions, for use as biomarkers, as instrumental variables, or even to
provide evolutionary insights (Berg and Coop, 2014). The PRS ap-
proach, and PRSice software, could be extended to test the effects of
copy number variants, epigenetic markers and more. We believe

that PRSice can simplify PRS studies greatly, expand the application
of PRS and aid the implementation of best—practice in PRS studies.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: One of the important steps of genome assembly is scaf-
folding, in which contigs are linked using information from read-pairs.
Scaffolding provides estimates about the order, relative orientation
and distance between contigs. We have found that contig distance
estimates are generally strongly biased and based on false assump-
tions. Since erroneous distance estimates can mislead in subsequent
analysis, it is important to provide unbiased estimation of contig
distance.

Results: In this article, we show that state-of-the-art programs for
scaffolding are using an incorrect model of gap size estimation. We
discuss why current maximum likelihood estimators are biased and
describe what different cases of bias we are facing. Furthermore, we
provide a model for the distribution of reads that span a gap and
derive the maximum likelihood equation for the gap length. We motiv-
ate why this estimate is sound and show empirically that it outper-
forms gap estimators in popular scaffolding programs. Our results
have consequences both for scaffolding software, structural variation
detection and for library insert-size estimation as is commonly per-
formed by read aligners.

1 INTRODUCTION

The decreasing cost of sequencing has made whole-genome
sequencing commonplace (Mardis, 2008). When sequencing a
genome, one obtains a large set of short fragments of DNA
(usually referred to as reads). Assembling these reads (and opti-
mally reconstruct the genome or chromosomes that were
sequenced into one piece) remains a complex task (Pop and
Salzberg, 2008; Pop, 2009). Due to the presence of repeats, allelic
differences and sequencing errors, the result of an assembly is
rarely a complete reconstruction of the genome. Instead, the
result is often subsets of reads assembled into longer fragments
of genomic sequences referred to as contigs. Since the goal is to

recreate the genome, ordering and placing these contigs as they
appear on the genome (given that the contigs are correctly
assembled) is an important assembly step after contig construc-
tion in a process called scaffolding (Huson et al., 2002).

In scaffolding, the problem is to link together contigs in their
correct order and orientation using paired reads. These paired
reads have some known distance (up to a distribution) between
them on the genome. If the two separate reads from a pair map
to two different contigs, a relation between the two contigs can
be inferred. Contigs that can be linked together represent a
longer fragment of the genome where sub-parts of the fragment
remain unknown (i.e. the gaps between contigs) and such a frag-
ment consisting of more than one contig is called a scaffold.
Modern scaffolder programs involve two steps (either separate
or intermixed):

0 Finding optimal order and orientation of the contigs with
respect to some objective function.

0 Checking for paired-read inconsistencies. This involves
removing reads that have been mapped with too small/
large an insert size (with respect to some generously set
thresholds) and reads that have been mapped in the wrong
relative orientation (often removed in the optimization step).

After this is done, the distance between contigs is often estimated
separately using a maximum likelihood (ML) estimation from
the reads that are linking the contigs (Dayarian et al., 2010;
Gao et al., 2011; Salmela et al., 2011).

The issue of gap length estimation should not be undervalued:
high-quality scaffolding provides an understanding of what is
necessary for finishing a genome (Nagarajan et al., 2010), with
the contig distances effectively quantifying the unassembled parts
of the genome. Bad estimates of contig distances, in particular
under-estimates, can mislead ﬁnishing. Bad distance estimates
can also interfere in genome annotation, e.g. with an underesti-
mated gap suggesting that there is not room for an expected
feature, or e.g., suggesting that a potential intron is too large
in the case of over-estimation. Furthermore, with contig dis-
tances being an essential indicator in the scaffolding process, a
systematic bias can impair correct scaffolding.

From currently implemented techniques of gap size estima-
tion, we noticed surprisingly poor estimates even in ideal cases
without mapping errors or duplicated reads. Both over- and
underestimation of hundreds of base pairs could occur. This
prompted our group to model gap size. Our aim is to provide

an accurate gap size estimation to be applied after ordering and
orientation of contigs and filtering of paired-read inconsistencies.

It is commonly assumed that the distribution of insert sizes for
reads that span over a certain gap (or even over a single position
in the genome) is the same as the distribution of the paired end
library (often approximated as a normal distribution). This is an
erroneous assumption. There is an observation bias from the
assumption that reads that span the gap are coming from the
whole insert size distribution of the library. Fig. 1 gives examples
of two types of biases that can occur and which reads would
actually be observed in these cases. A ‘negative bias’ occurs
when the gap size is underestimated due to only observing
reads from the upper part of the distribution. Similarly, a ‘posi-
tive bias’ occurs when overestimating the gap by only observing
reads from the lower parts of the library insert size distribution.

Another example of positive bias is when aligning reads to a
short contig, a case occurring frequently when working with
fragmented assemblies. Then, only pairs with shorter insert size
will have both reads mapped. This is highly relevant for read
aligners such as Bowtie (Langmead et al., 2009) and Burrows
Wheeler Aligner (BWA) (Li, H. and Durbin) that are routinely
estimating the insert sizes for paired-read libraries. Since they are
designed mainly for high-quality reference genomes, they are im-
plicitly using an “infinite contig length’ assumption, and hence
underestimate the insert size on fragmented assemblies. A heur-
istic way to deal with this bias is by choosing only large contigs
(compared to the insert size of the library) and consider only
paired reads that place sufficiently far from contig ends
(Phillipphy et al., 2008).

In Sections 2.1—2.3, we explain a model for estimating gap
lengths. Section 2.4 derives an estimate from the model in a
special case and gives some intuition behind the estimate. In
Section 2.5, the model is used to derive a closed form ML ex-
pression and we discuss this expression and its practical
implications.

Section 3 shows results of gap estimations from our formula
compared to estimations from popular scaffolding programs.
The results are discussed in Section 4.

2 GAP SIZE MODELLING

Consider two contigs c1 and 02. Our objective in this section is to
find a model for the distribution of the insert size lengths x of
reads spanning a given gap of length d between c1 and 02 (see
Fig. 2). Let X be the stochastic variable denoting the insert size of
a read pair and d, lcl|, |c2| be parameters denoting the gap length
and the two contig lengths. As input to a scaffolder, one provides
the positions of where reads align to a contig, usually obtained
using an external read mapper. For a paired read 1', we call these
observations 0,1 and 0,2 and let 0,1 + 0,2 = 0,. This gives the equal-
ity xi: 0,-+d (see Fig. 2). This equality is important to keep in
mind, since we will alternate between expressing functions in
either 0 +d or x depending on the context. From this relation,
we introduce the stochastic variable 0, which is a variable
describing the distribution of the observations 0,- that comes
from pairs linking c1 and c2. We want to describe the distribution
of 0 given some gap size d and contig lengths lcl|, lcz|, i.e. O|d,
IC 1|, Id-

Thus, deriving the ML estimate for the gap assuming the reads are
coming from the whole support of the distribution will lead to overesti-
mation of the gap size.

Fig. 2. A paired read with insert size x linking contigs c1 and c2. The
(unknown) distance between c1 and c2 is given by d, which results in the
observed distance 0,-=0,-l+0,-2. Since we have information about the
insert size x and x,=0,-+ d , this observation carries information about
the size of d.

2.1 The model

We let the probability that a paired-end read of length x,- is
observed spanning a gap of size d between two contigs c1 and
02 be denoted by p(0| |c1|,|cz|),. Furthermore, let f(x) be the dis-
tribution of the insert sizes of the paired-end library.

Now, with the library distribution f(0 + d) and the probability
of a paired-end read spanning a gap p(0| |c1|,|cz|), we obtain the
distribution of insert sizes from observed reads that span a gap of
size d as

P(0I|01|,|02I)f(0 +d)
£20190} I I01|,|02|)f(y+d)dy'

Here, the denominator is only for normalizing the function to
a probability distribution. The probability function h(0|
d,|cll,|cz|) indicates that the distribution of reads spanning a
gap of size d is explained by the probability that a paired read
of given insert size will span the gap times the probability that
this pair is being generated by the sequencing protocol (with the
functions expressed in 0 instead of x). Now we have seen the
general outline for the model, but what assumptions can we
make for f and p?

h(0 I d, Ic1I, I02I) = (1)

 

2.2 Distribution for f

The distribution of insert-size lengths of a paired-end library can
be very complex. Usually, the insert-size plots from such libraries
look like a normal distribution with thicker tails that have been
cut. Since different protocols can vary slightly in the distributions

they generate, it can be nearly impossible to try to model the
exact distribution for each sequencing protocol generated. We
will here assume a general ‘not too incorrect’ consensus model
for these libraries and therefore work with the normal distribu-
tion, in agreement with other authors (e.g. Gao et al., 2011;
Lysholm et al., 2011; Richter et al., 2008). One motivation for
this, that will become clear after the derivation of the ML esti-
mate, is that with thicker tails, the negative bias will be even
larger than in the case of a regular normal distribution. Thus,
compared to current methods that estimate gap sizes (Boetzer
et al., 2010; Dayarian et al., 2010; Gao et al., 2011; Pop et al.,
2004; Salmela et al., 2011), assuming a normal distribution will
take us in the right direction of estimating the gap size but we
may still leave some of the negative bias due to the assumption of
a normal distribution instead of the ‘thicker tail’ distribution.

To summarize, we let the read insert size be modeled by
X ~ N(,u., 02), thus f will be the normal density function.

2.3 Deriving p

What is the probability that a read pair of length x will span a
gap of size d located somewhere on a genome of length of size |G|
given certain lengths of the contigs c1 and c2? Under the assump-
tion that the paired reads are generated uniformly throughout the
genome (not entirely correct but a reasonable simplification), we
can think of this problem as the number of ways that we can
cover a segment of d positions with a segment of x positions such
that the segment x is within the total length of c1| + d + |cz| (recall
notations in from Fig. 2). We must, however, take into account
that both reads of a pair must map to the contigs. To express the
model conveniently, we say that the read lengths of both reads
within a paired-end read are equal to r and that the reads must lie
completely within a contig in order to span the gap. These
restrictions are easy to relax when implementing the model. To
be able to untangle the problem of possible placings, we look
separately at each of the possible cases that can occur. It can be
divided into three different cases (Fig. 3 illustrates these cases).

0 The first case (Fig. 3a) is where the contigs are long enough
such that the paired read of length x can ‘be placed’ around
the gap of length d freely. In this case, we can cover the gap
in precisely x — d — 2r —I— 1 ways.

0 In the second case, one of the contigs is so small (say c1) that
it limits the number of placements of a read of length x to
|cl| — r —I— l.

o The third case is when x is so large compared to the distance
|c1|+|cz|+d that the number of placements of x over d is
limited to |cl| —I— |cz| —I—d— 36+ 1.

This suggests that p(x — d| lcl|, |c2|) is a min function consisting
of these three functions. So, if cm,” = min{ lcl|,|czl}, the probabil-
ity that a paired-end read of length x will span a gap of size d
located somewhere on a genome of length |G| becomes

1
ﬁmin { max{x — d— 2r —I— 1,0}, cm," — r —I— 1,
max{|cll + |02| -I— d— x + l, 0}}.
This function takes the number of possible covering options
divided by the number of possible placements of the read to

Fig. 3. Range of possible ‘placings’ of a paired read over a gap (shown as
dotted lines). The paired reads (arrows facing each other) are positioned
furthest to the left. We can ‘slide’ the paired read across the contigs until
we encounter a restriction. This will give us the number of the possible
placings for the paired read. (a) Contigs are large compared to x, which
makes the restriction of possible placings of a paired read be the insert
size of the read (i.e. the number of possible placings is x — d — 2r + 1). 0))
The shortest of the two contigs is so short that it limits the number of
possible placements to be the length of the shortest contig minus the read
length plus one (i.e. min{IclI,Ic2I} — r+ 1). (c) x is so long compared to
IclI + IczI + d that the placement of the read is restricted to

the genome. The max functions within the min function describes
that we cannot observe a paired read that is shorter than d+ 2r
(it will have at least one read placed within the gap) or longer
than c1 —I—cz—I—d (since they will have at least one read placed
outside the two contigs). In practice, reads can be placed partly
in contigs if sufficiently many positions overlap, one could then
change the integration bounds to the exact ones specified by the
read aligners criteria. This will ‘however’ have a small effect and
the general boundaries given here are sufficient to work with.

Note that the divisor |G| is not exact since the true expression
of ‘the number of possible coverings divided by the number of
possible placements of the read to the genome’ would give a
division with |G| —x instead, but |G|/(|G| —x) w 1. The motiv-
ation for replacing this probability is that the maximum likeli-
hood formulas with respect to d will become a lot easier to
differentiate and analyze (x depends on the observation and d)
while the approximation says that the change in results will be
marginal, if any at all.

2.4 A special case

Now we have distributions for f and p and therefore implicitly
have the distribution of 11. As an example, say that we have two
different contigs with lengths larger than the longest insert size of
a paired-read library and that they have a gap length of 0 bp
between them (they are completely adjacent, i.e. d: 0). What is
then Eh[0|d] (the observed mean link length) of the paired-end
reads that connect these contigs? With these restrictions, we have
p(x — d | |c1|,|czl)= x — d— 2r +1/|G| (contigs are always suf-
ficiently large). Note that this problem is equivalent to the

problem of finding the distribution of insert sizes of paired reads
that are spanning over a position. As mentioned above, it is com-
monly assumed that this expected value is ,u. [if X ~ N(,u., 02)].
Let us see what we get with our model. For the sake of simplicity,
we ignore the read lengths r since they are not important for the
example (they only subtract or add 2r bases if they are included
respectively not). We then get

Eh[0 | d: 0, Icil, |02|I =

This signifies that the expected insert length of the paired reads
that link two contigs of distance 0 is some number that is higher
than the mean insert size of the library. Similarly, this in fact
shows that the distribution of insert sizes over any position on
the genome is not the same as the distribution of the library—the
mean is larger.

This is intuitive in some sense, since if you would take the
‘upper half’ of the library and spread across the genome, they
would of course cover a larger fraction of the genome than if you
take the lower half of the library. Thus, reads from the ‘upper
half’ of the library are much more frequently seen spanning a
position than are reads from the ‘lower half’.

Furthermore, the additional quantity 02/11. + 1 depends on the
relation between the variance and the mean of the library. This,
as well, is not surprising. If you have a high variance, you will
have even larger differences (in size) between many of the largest
insert sizes compared to the smallest ones. Basically, the smallest
insert-size reads do not span many positions together so they are
almost never seen spanning a position, while the contrary holds
for large insert-size reads. In addition, the divisor basically says
that given any variance, if the mean is large enough, the ratio of a
small to large reads given the library distribution will not be too
large.

2.5 Inferring gap size with maximum likelihood estimation

We will now derive an ML estimator (Le Cam, 1990) from
our model in (1). Let 0 be a vector of observations. It is then
natural to ask: ‘What is the most probable value of the gap
size provided observations 0?’ Let cmaxzmax{|c1|,|cz|} and

erf(x) denote the error function of x. The following theorem
gives the ML equation.

THEOREM 1. The ML-equation of d for h(0 | d,|cll,|cz|) as
defined above is given by

PROOF. See Appendix A.

The nature of this function makes it hard to derive its behavior
analytically and attempts of proving monotonicity of this func-
tion have not succeeded. However, extensive simulation supports
the conjecture that this function is monotonically increasing with
d for reasonably large contig sizes lcl|,|c2| 2 0+ r. This result is
important since monotonicity leads us to perform binary search
of this function to find the ML estimate of d. In practice, it
suffices to perform binary search in the interval

[maxi—1.11 —|01|—|02|— ma + 2r}. u + ma + 2r]

with mm 3 since it is highly unlikely that we can span
other ranges with the given library. That is, we cannot expect
to span gaps that lie more than around ,u. + 30 bp away. In the
same way, we cannot expect to span contig pairs with
|cl| + |czl+d< ,u. —30. We have here restricted the lower bound-
ary to —l, which is the smallest correct gap we can expect to
encounter. How to choose 1 depends on assembly parameters.
A frequently occurring case in a de Brujin-based assembly is that
the neighboring contigs overlap with one k-mer size (the algo-
rithm splits at a given node in the graph leaving k base pairs
commonly shared). However, since binary search in an interval
of length n has complexity 0(log n), it is not too important to
chose a tight I.

Improved gap size estimation for scaffolding algorithms

 

3 RESULTS

To investigate the bias in gap estimation of current dedicated
scaffolders, we simulated a 300 000 bp genome with no biological
structure (e.g. free from repeats). This is done to allow us to
focus on the concept of pure gap estimation rather than e.g.
removal of repeat contigs and mapping errors. Under these
simple scaffolding circumstances a reasonable gap estimation
model should perform well. Three different libraries were simu-
lated from this genome where paired read positions were uni-
formly distributed throughout the genome (see Table 1).

In the evaluation, we tested our gap estimation model, imple-
mented in the program GapEst (code provided at https://github
.com/SciLifeLab/gapest), against three state-of-the-art scaf-
folders: SOPRA (v1.4.6), SSPACE (v2.0) and OPERA (v1.02).
GapEst takes a SAM-file as input and infers the gaps between
contigs by parsing the positions of the mapped reads in the
SAM-file. The gap estimation is based on the formula in
Theorem 1. Reads were mapped with BWA (Li, H. and
Durbin) using default parameters for all programs except
OPERA which is coupled with Bowtie (Langmead et al., 2009).
We chose BWA since it is able to align soft-clipped reads (read
aligned partially to contigs) which gives more observations to our
tests.

3.1 Gap underestimation

We tested gap estimation where negative bias can occur (see Case
a in Fig. 1). For this, we simulated four different sets of contigs
from the genome with fixed gap size set to 30, 300, 650 and
950 bp. The contigs were set to a fixed size of 3000 bp. This
gives 12 possible combinations of data (three read libraries and
four sets of contigs). The results of the mean gap estimates are
shown in Fig. 4.

We see that SOPRA and OPERA are systematically under-
estimating gap size in most cases and the underestimation in-
creases as d increases. This is intuitive since as the gap gets
larger, more reads from the lower parts of the distribution
fail to cover the gap and only the longest are left, as explained
(Fig. 1). The bias also increases as the variation of the library
increases which was predicted in Section 2. SSPACE does not
show the same systematic underestimation bias as OPERA and
SOPRA, but the predictions are still far from the true ones.
GapEst, in contrast, produces unbiased estimates across all com-
binations of gap size and standard deviations. There are two
estimation points that deviate slightly from the true value, gap
size 650 for the SD65 library and gap size 950 for the SD300
library. This can occur since there are actually only between 5
and 10 edges that span these gaps in both of the cases, thus
estimations become more uncertain.

3.2 Gap overestimation

We tested gap estimation where positive bias can occur (see Case
b) in Fig. 1). For this, we simulated four different sets of contigs
from the genome with fixed gap size set to —30, 30, 150 and
300 bp with fixed contig length of 300 bp. The negative gap
case frequently occurs since a de Brujin-based assembler splits
its contigs at a given node in the de Bruijn graph that leaves an
overlap (negative gap) of one k-mer length. With these four sets

The three plots visualize the mean estimates of the gaps of sizes of 30, 300,
650 and 950 bp. Each plot corresponds to one paired-read library where
the standard deviations of the libraries are of 65, 150, respectively, 300 bp.
Data points are missing where the gap is 950 bp since reads fail to span
the gaps for SD 65 and SD150.

of contigs, we used the paired-end libraries with 65 and 150 bp
standard deviation (we advocate the restriction |c1|,|c2| Z o+r for
reasonable precision in GapEst). This gives eight possible com-
binations of data (two read libraries and four sets of contigs).
The results of the mean gap estimates are shown in Fig. 5.

3.3 A biological insert size library

To show that our model is adequate and applicable for real
library insert-size distributions, we downloaded the genome
and Solexa/Illumina mate-pair reads for Staphylococcus aureus
from Genome Assembly Gold-standard Evaluations (GAGE)
homepage (Salzberg et al., 2012). The library had 45x coverage,
mean insert size of 3.6 kbp and a SD of 275 bp. Contigs were
obtained by splitting the reference genome into segments of
5kbp with gaps of fixed size 500, 1500, 2500 and 3500bp.
Reads were mapped with BWA (Li and Durbin, 2009) using
default parameters.

Fig. 5. Gap size estimates for OPERA, SOPRA, SSPACE and GapEst.
The three plots visualize the mean estimates of the gaps of sizes of —30,
30, 150 and 300 bp. Each plot corresponds to one paired-read library
where the standard deviations of the libraries are of 65 and 150 bp.

Due to the repeated nature of a real genome, a fraction of the
mate-pair reads are likely to be mapped incorrectly, causing
spurious links between contigs. Since we are only focusing on
gap estimation given that contig links are correct, we removed
the gap estimates that gave obvious indicators of alignment
errors (about 2% of the estimations), as would be done in a
scaffolder. Obvious error estimates were conservatively classified
as gap estimations over 1500 bp away from true gap sizes to-
gether with a significant deviation in number of spanning links.
Inspection indicates that there are still spurious links left in the
data and a more strict filtering may reduce the standard
deviations.

We compared GapEst to SOPRA on this dataset. The results
are illustrated in Table 2. For GapEst, the average gap estimates
are very close to the true ones. The increasing standard deviation
in the estimations of GapEst is due to the decreasing number of
links that are able to span the gap. Compared to GapEst,
SOPRA has a high standard deviation. One possible explanation
for this is that SOPRA does not filter out all spurious links. We
found that running GapEst without the filtering step gave only
minor differences in mean gap length but a significantly higher
standard deviation.

3.4 Gap estimation performance on real assemblies

GAGE provides (unscaffolded) assemblies from seven different
assemblers on S. aureus. We tested how GapEst performed on
these assemblies using the same mate-pair reads as in previous
section. MUMmer (Kurtz et al., 2004) was used to align the
contigs from an assembly onto the reference genome. For all
pairwise combinations of contigs, a gap was estimated if two
contigs were on a distance of less than ,u. + 40 and the two con-
tigs had over 90% alignment identity and over 95% aligned
length. The gaps calculated by MUMmer in this way are referred
to as ‘true gaps’. We also ran GapEst and obtained gaps between
contigs referred to as ‘estimated gaps’. A gap was calculated by
GapEst for contig pairs passing the following heuristic filters:

0 Links placing at distance 2,11. + 60 were ignored (presumed
false mappings).

o Contig pair had at least 10 supporting links.

shown in the ﬁrst column. Average SOPRA and GapEst estimations together with
standard deviations are shown in second and third column. Number of gaps are
listed in column 4.

0 Let the mean of the 10 smallest observations and the 10 lar-
gest observations over a gap be ,ulowobs, ,uhighobs, respectively.
Then gaps with observations ,uhighobs — mow" S > 60 were
ignored (presuming that at least part of the observations
are false mappings since the spread of the library is so wide).

We plotted the intersection of the gaps inferred by MUMmer
and GapEst for the ABySS assembly, Fig. 6 shows the result.
Plots of the six other assemblies of S. aureus. are given in
Supplementary material.

4 DISCUSSION

The scaffolders we tested perform poorly and suffer from severe
bias even in ideal conditions. OPERA and SOPRA show very
similar gap estimations. Although OPERA estimates several gap
sizes simultaneously, this has no advantage in our tests since
paired reads do not span over more than one gap. Under these
circumstances, OPERA’s gap estimator works with one gap at a
time, and effectively becomes the one used by SOPRA.

Using simulated datasets, GapEst outperforms the scaffolders
tested when estimating gap lengths (Figs 4 and 5). Given the
assumptions (in agreement with scaffolding literature) of reads
being sequenced uniformly throughout the genome and that the
library insert size is somewhat normal, GapEst appears to be
unbiased in all cases. GapEst also produces accurate results
with the biological data, as shown in Sections 3.3 and 3.4.

This type of gap estimation could open up new ways to tackle
the scaffolding problem. For example, using the gap information
in the ordering step of the scaffolding algorithm could improve
relative placings of the contigs.

As indicated in Section 1, our model for gap size estimation
can be used in more general contexts. For example, read aligners
commonly estimate insert size by observing reads pairs that map
to the same contig. This is a slightly different problem. On one
hand, paired reads with large insert size are more likely to span
any position on the genome (as seen in Section 2.4), giving rise to
negative bias. On the other hand, one will observe less paired
reads with large insert size on a given contig, since long reads are
more likely to have one of the reads placed outside the contig.
This gives rise to positive bias and the problem is exacerbated if
contigs are short relative to insert size distribution.

Another problem that requires sensitive estimates of insert-size
distributions on a given contig is structural variation detection
with paired read information. Here we are facing the same

provides the framework for deriving the exact distribution in
each individual case and using this, the sensitivity in detection
of structural variants can be improved.

5 CONCLUSION

We have, in this article, discussed the mathematical theory
behind gap estimation. This theory has resulted in a model
that explains the most likely length of the gap between two con-
tigs given the observed read pairs that span the gap. Moreover,
we have implemented the formula of the ML equation and com-
pared the estimates to state-of-the-art scaffolding software.
Empirical results suggest that our model gives a signiﬁcant im-
provement in estimating gap length. We encourage developers of
existing scaffolder programs to use this formula for gap size es-
timation where possible.

A: PROOF OF THEOREM 1

Given our function h(0 | a’, |c1|, lczl), we have the likelihood
function of a’ (denoted L(a’)) as

W) = Him I d.Ic1I,Ic2I)

i=1 Afﬂi'cz't pa I ICII, Iczl)f(y + no

noting that the integration bounds in the normalizing constant
follow from the deﬁnition of p(0|a’, |c1|, |c2|) (it is zero outside
this interval). From this, the log likelihood can be written as

1(d) = Z 1np(o.- I Icll. Iczl) + Z 1nf(o.+ d)
i=1 i=1

" |01|+|02|+1

i=1 2

We want to differentiate this expression with respect to a’ to
obtain the maximum likelihood equation for a’. By linearity of
the differential operator, differentiation of (4) can be performed
separately for each term. The ﬁrst term is constant in a’ and
cancels out. The second term becomes

i=1

Now, if we let g(d) = fz'fi'T'Q'H 190 I I01 I, Iczl)f(y + 61W, we can
write the third term as

X":%(g(d)) : n£l(g(d))

,2, g(d) g(d) '

 

We therefore have
1 " g’(d)
l’(a’)=— (0,-—I—a’—,u.)—I—n—.

Letting this equation be equal to zero to ﬁnd the ML estimate,
we get (after some algebraic manipulations)

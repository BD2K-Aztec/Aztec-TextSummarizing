Abstract

Motivation: As the mean age of parenthood grows, the effect of parental age on genetic disease and
child health becomes ever more important. A number of autosomal dominant disorders show a dra-
matic paternal age effect due to selfish mutations: substitutions that grant spermatogonial stem cells
a selective advantage in the testes of the father, but have a deleterious effect in offspring. In this pa-
per we present a computational technique to model the spermatogonial stem cell niche in order to
examine the phenomenon and draw conclusions across different genes and disorders.

Results: We used a Markov chain to model the probabilities of mutation and positive selection with
cell divisions. The model was fitted to available data on disease incidence and also mutation assays
of sperm donors. Strength of selective advantage is presented for a range of disorders including
Apert’s syndrome and achondroplasia. Incidence of the diseases was predicted closely for most dis-
orders and was heavily influenced by the site-specific mutation rate and the number of mutable aI-
leles. The model also successfully predicted a stronger selective advantage for more strongly activat-
ing gain-of-function mutations within the same gene. Both positive selection and the rate of copy-error
mutations are important in adequately explaining the paternal age effect.

1 Introduction

As the average age of parenthood becomes more delayed, understanding
the effect of parental age on child health becomes more important. (Bray
et a]. 2006). The effect of maternal age has long been acknowledged
(Hook 1981), but in recent years the effect of paternal age has been the
subject of a great deal of study. Paternal age has been linked to a wide
range of traits and diseases, such as spontaneous occurrences of muta-
tions that cause dominant disorders and X—linked diseases (Vogel 1975,
Risch et a]. 1987, Glaser & Jabs 2004). Congenital defects, cancer pre-
disposition disorders, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism and Alz-
heimer’s disease have also been linked to father’s age (reviewed in Paul
and Robaire 2013).

Due to the larger number of male germline cell divisions compared
with the female germline, males produce 3-6 times as many mutations
than females throughout evolution (Li et a]. 1996). Sperm are produced
by a continually-dividing population of stem cells and each division
represents a chance for replication errors to happen. Penrose (1955) ﬁrst
proposed that replication errors provided an explanation for the observed
incidence of genetic diseases with paternal age. In many cases the inﬂu-
ence of paternal age is relatively subtle compared with the large scale
chromosomal abnormalities characteristic of maternal age effect because
point mutations typically have small or no effect on phenotype. However
certain substitutions can have devastating effect on those who carry the
allele.

Diseases that show a strong paternal age effect, however, are not ex-
plained purely by Penrose’s copy-error hypothesis and show an exponen-
tial increase in incidence with father's age. The mutations responsible

typically display a very speciﬁc spectrum of missense substitutions,
accumulating faster than the raw mutation rate can account for. Substitu-
tions associated with these disorders present in clumps, indicating a
positive selective mechanism of mutation accumulation, as opposed to a
high mutation rate or “hot spot” model. Such evidence has so far pre-
sented for achondroplasia (Shinde et a]. 2013), Apert’s syndrome (Qin et
a]. 2007, Choi et a]. 2008), Costello syndrome (Ginnoulatou et a]. 2013)
and Noonan Syndrome (Yoon et a]. 2013). There is a parallel with the
intestinal crypt where mutant cells colonize their niche through selective
advantage conferred by their new phenotype (Bozic & Nowak 2013). It
is also relevant to cancer etiology as paternal age effect mutations are
typically found in tumors (Maher et a]. 2014).

1.1 The Spermatogonial Stem Cell Niche

Sperrnatogonial stem cells (SSCs) reside on the basal lamina on the outer
edge of the seminiferous tubules within the testes. Sperrnatogonia are
surrounded by much larger Sertoli cells that form the microenvironment
for the cells. The spermatogonia divide in cyclical waves and progeny of
the stem cells migrate as they divide and differentiate towards the hollow
center of the seminiferous tubule (de Rooij & Russel 2000). In humans
the active SSCs are comprised of type Apale spermatogonia.

Certain stem cell systems like the colonic crypt have speciﬁc ar-
rangements of cells with strictly limited numbers of stem cells (Hum-
phries & Wright 2008). The SSC niche on the other hand lacks obvious
repeating structures. However, SSCs are observed to localize to speciﬁc
areas of the seminiferous epithelium (Yoshida 2008). While spermato-
gonia can repopulate whole seminiferous tubules that have been depleted
by radiation (Shinohara et a]. 2001), studies of live imaging of stem cells
indicate limited migrational capabilities (Klein et a]. 2010). Additionally,
cells that migrate away from the niche are likely to differentiate (de
Rooij & van Beek 2013), likely because GDNF distribution is patch-like
(Sato et a]. 2011), creating effective niche limits.

1.2 Motivation & Predictions

The objective of this model was to simulate the accumulation of muta-
tions through positive selection. Several groups have made simulations
of mutation accumulation that can present in the signature arrangement
but have been limited to FGFR2 mutations causing Apert’s syndrome
(Yoon et a]. 2009, Choi et a]. 2008, Qin et a]. 2007).

Our primary aim was to estimate the r value for a range of disease
causing mutations. Currently the only estimate for an r value comes from
Yoon and colleagues, who estimated it to be 0.014 for Apert’s syn-
drome-causing mutations (Yoon et a]. 2009). We aim to provide esti-
mates for a range of different disease causing loci. We hypothesized that
diseases with a more exponential increase with paternal age would have
larger r values. We also aimed to determine if differences in incidence
rate between alleles of a single gene or between mutations that cause
different disorders is due to the underlying mutation rate or to the selec-
tive advantage of the particular alleles. Additionally, where different
mutations affect the same gene, if there is a stronger activating mutation,
we expected a higher r value.

The SSC niche has been the subject of some computer simulations of
the normal stem cell niche (de Rooij & van Beek 2013, Ray et a]. 2014)
which model the normal homeostasis of the spermatogonial stem cell
niche in terms of spatial arrangement of cell and the cycling of the semi-
niferous epithelium. Mutation accumulation by positive selection for
Apert syndrome has also been simulated looking purely at sequence data.
Yoon and colleagues were able to simulate mutation accumulation with-

in the niche to match their mutational data quite closely. In contrast to
the simulation presented in the previous work for a single syndrome, in
this paper we present a mathematical model that can be used to provide a
deeper understanding of mutation accumulation across different genes
and disorders.

2 Methods

2.1 Model

We assume that the stem cell niche represents a closed system, with 11
cells contained within. Of the 11 cells, each can be in one of two states;
mutant or wildtype. With each cell division, a stem cell acquires the
mutation with probability p. Stem cells are assumed to divide asymmet-
rically, one daughter differentiating and ultimately being lost and the
other remaining in the niche. With normal divisions, therefore, the num-
ber of stem cells will not change regardless of divisions. Mutant cells are
different from wildtype in that they have a positive selective probability
of r with every cell division, much higher than the probability of muta-
tion. Should a selection event happen, a mutant cell will divide symmet-
rically to produce two mutant cells. This will increase the niche size
above the maximum. To correct this, a random cell is ejected from the
niche and lost (all cells are eligible for ejection, including the newly-
forrned mutant cell).

Figure 1. Representation of the probabilities associated with a niche of
n stem cells.

 

The niche, represented by circles, starts with 0 mutant cells out of n. After a stem
cell divides in the niche, the probability p0 indicates the chance that a mutation
occurs and brings the system into state 1 (i.e. one mutant cell in the niche) and qo
that after the cell division the niche remains in state 0. Once in state 1, the probabil-
ity of advancing to state 2 has changed to p1 as the chance of mutation remains but
the mutant cells may expand with a selective event. Correspondingly, the chance
that a cell division occurs that maintains the niche in state 1 is now ql. This contin-
ues until, ultimately, all of the n cells are mutant, at which point the system remains
in state n.

We have modeled the system as a Markov chain (ﬁgure 1). The chain
has n+1 states, where state 0 represents the niche comprised entirely of
wildtype cells and in the ﬁnal state, 11, the cells are entirely mutant. Each
niche consists entirely of wildtype cells to begin with and positive selec-
tion (r) can only occur once a mutation has ﬁrst happened to one of the
cells. Cells are selected at random from the niche to divide sequentially.
State 1’ represents the niche with 1’ mutant cells and n-z' wildtype cells. In
state i there is within the niche a probability p,- that after a cell division
the number of mutant cells will increase by one, and a probability q,- that
they will remain the same. The probability of a mutation and a subse-
quent reversal at the same site is sufﬁciently small as to be ignored.

Let us imagine that the niche is in state i and a random cell is selected
to divide. If the cell selected is wildtype, then with probability p it is
transformed into a mutant and returned to the niche, otherwise it is re-
turned as a wildtype. If a mutant cell is selected, it is simply returned to
the niche unless a selection event happens with probability r, in which
case two mutant cells are returned and subsequently one random cell is
lost (all cells including the returned cells are eligible to be lost).

In order to calculate q, the probability that after a cell division the
system remains in state i, there are therefore three mutually exclusive
possibilities with the following probabilities:

(1) A wildtype cell is selected for division, but no mutation occurs:

11

 

—l'
(I—p) (2.1)

n

(2) A mutant cell is selected for division and no selection event
happens:

i'(1 — r) (2.2)
n

(3) A mutant cell divides, a selection event happens and a mutant
cell is lost ﬁom the niche.

 

 

 

i i+1
— r (2.3)
n n + l
The combined probability q,- is therefore:
12 — i i i i+l
61,.= (1-P)+—(1-r)+-r (2.4)
n n n n + 1

With some rearrangement:

i r(n—i)
q,=1-P+— P-— (2.5)

n n+1

Since p,- = 1 — qi, this can be rewritten as:

n—i ir
 p j 

I’l

 

 

The Markov chain produces a matrix, T, with dimensions of (n+1) ><
(n+1), where rows indicate the starting state and column denote the ﬁnal
state (i.e. the initial and ﬁnal number of mutant cells).

qo po 0 0  0 0 '
0 q1 [91 0 0 0
0 0 q2 p2  0 0
T = 0 0 0 q3 0 0 (2.7)
0 0 0 0  qn_1 pm1
_0 0 0 0  0 1 _

 

 

This matrix gives the probability of moving from one state to another
in one step i.e. one cell division within the stem cell niche. The element
Ti,- gives the probability of starting in state i (i.e. a niche containing 1’
mutant cells) and after one cell division in the niche ending in state j with
j mutant cells. In order to model the progression of multiple cell divi-
sions within the niche, the matrix can simply be raised to the power of
the number of cell divisions. T2 will give a matrix that provides probabil-
ities for two steps (i.e. two cell divisions within the niche) and TK will
provide probabilities for traversing in K steps. In the ﬁnal matrix, there-
fore, the element TKij represents the probability that a niche starting with 1’
mutant stem cells will end with j mutant stem cells after K cell divisions.
Note that K is total cell divisions occurring amongst any of the cells in
the niche, not the average number of divisions per cell, which would be
K/n.

For an individual, the number of steps required, K, is a factor of the
rate of cell division d (divisions per year per cell), the age of the individ-
ual a in years and the number of cells per niche n.

K = nda (2.8)

The matrix TK was for any given age solved computationally, by gen-
erating a matrix T and calculating values for each cell and then raising
the matrix to the power K Since the model assumes every individual
starts with 0 mutant cells, the only relevant part of the ﬁnal solved matrix
is the top row.

State 0 1 2 3  11—1 11
(2.9)
P [ PO P P P  P P ]

S 1 2 3 n—l

For a given state s, the value PS denotes the probability that starting
with 0 mutant cells, after K cell divisions, the niche will have s mutant
cells. The average number of mutants per niche (assuming sufﬁcient
number of replications), M, can be calculated by summing all of the ﬁnal
state values multiplied by the corresponding probabilities.

M = ZSPS (2.10)
s=0

M/n gives us a single proportion of mutant to wildtype cells at a given
age a. Within an individual person many niches will deviate dramatically
from the average value, but since the number of niches within a single
individual can be assumed to be high (see section 2.3), but all contribute
sperm equally, we can assume that the overall proportion of mutant
sperm to wildtype sperm as a whole will tend towards to M/n.

This can be proven as follows. There are N niches each with n stem
cells. Each niche has a different number of mutant cells, u 1, ug, etc. Each
stem cell contributes an equal number of sperm, for simplicity we as-
sume one sperm per stem cell but the following is true for any value of
sperm produced per stem cell division as the proportion will remain
constant.

The total number of mutant cells U is:

U:  (2.11)

Dividing by the total number of stem cells over all the niches (Nn)
gives the proportion of mutant stem cells over total cells, which is equiv-
alent to the mean proportion of mutant cells per niche:

U )‘(U
— = (2.12)

 

Where Ky is the mean number of mutant cells per niche for a given

number of niches N. Taken to the limit:

)7 M
lim( U)=— (2.13)

N—)oo n n

 

Therefore using the ideal average value M/n from a single niche is an
accurate measure of mutant sperm proportion for the entire individual
providing N is large and all niches contribute sperm equally.

2.2 Conﬁrmation of Model Design by Simulation

To test the mathematical model, we designed a simulation alongside it to
emulate the progression of a single stem cell niche. Early versions of our
simulation were much more complex and attempted to simulate all the
SSCs within an individual, but simulation of a single niche is sufﬁcient
to test the model, particularly averaged over a large number of repeats

(see equation 2.13). Simulation of the stem cell niche was designed in
C4-l-. Script design simulated a stem cell population at a niche level
independent of the Markov chain model (supplementary algorithm 1).

The simulation progressed by selecting a random cell. If the selected
cell was wildtype it became mutant with probability p and if the selected
cell was mutant it underwent a selective event with probability r. Selec-
tive events represented a symmetric division and added a mutant cell to
the niche. As a consequence a random cell was then ejected and lost
ﬁom the niche. This process was repeated and the simulation was al-
lowed to run for a speciﬁc number of cell divisions sufﬁcient to repre-
sent a human reproductive lifespan (n><d><80 years). The results from
each run were then averaged over a hundred thousand repeats of the
simulation.

The simulation was tested against the mathematical expression by ap-
plying equation 2.10 with the same parameters and age values as the
simulation. The simulation tended towards the values provided by the
model and showed perfect agreement with sufﬁcient replication (sup-
plementary ﬁgure 1).

2.3 Parameters

Mutation probability, p. Rahbari et al. (2016) estimated the mutation
frequency per nucleotide per germline cell division at 4 X 10'11 calculated
by sequencing multi-sibling families. This mutation rate is close to that
calculated with phylogenetic data (Lynch 2010) and point mutations on
the Y-chromosome (Helgason et al. 2015). Rahabari and colleagues also
noted little variation of mutation rate with paternal age, which allowed us
to assume p is a constant value regardless of age. This is the baseline
mutation probability per site, before accounting for elevated mutational
frequency due to CpG sites or multiple disease-causing alleles within a
single gene.

Stem cells per niche, n. SSCs are not organized in regular repeating
structures with deﬁned cell numbers like the colonic crypt (Humphries &
Wright, 2008) and this makes estimating the niche size difﬁcult. While
initial models of the SSC niche did not have discrete compartmentaliza—
tion, recent research has shown preferential clustering of SSCs to specif-
ic regions of the seminiferous basal lamina (de Rooij & Griswold 2012,
Yoshida et al. 2007). To estimate the number of SSCs per niche, we
turned to studies in mice, where sperrnatogenesis has been reconstituted
in sterile mice by transplantation of SSCs bearing a reporter gene. From
Shinohara et al. (2001), adult mice generated at least 108 colonies per
testis. Given 35,000 stem cells per mouse testis (Tegelenbosch & de
Rooij DG 1993), this amounts to 324 stem cells per niche. Scaling up to
human testes by weight, assuming the same number of stem cells per
niche, gives us approximately 3 million individual niches, which fulﬁlls
the requirement of equation 2.13. The model also assumes the number of
SSCs remains constant throughout life. In reality, the number of stem
cells declines with age (Paul & Robaire 2013). Assuming attrition occurs
evenly among mutant and wildtype stem cells, this stochastic loss will
not affect the proportion of mutant to wildtype sperm over many niches.
The caveat to this is that it is possible that the mutant cells, rather than a
proliferative advantage, are granted some form of resistance to the age-
based attrition. Finally, as hypothesized by Yoon and colleagues (Yoon
et al. 2009), non-proliferating Adark spermatogonia may activate as re-
serve stem cells and replace losses (including lost mutant cells) with
wildtype cells. This would cause a “dip” in the mutation frequency,
irrespective of gene as fresh wildtype cells are introduced into the sys-
tem. This would be informative to model across disorders but is beyond
the scope of this paper.

Stem cell divisions per year, (1. Human sperrnatogenesis results in
one stem cell divisions per sperrnatogenic cycle of the Apale spermatogo-
nia, so once every 16 days (de Rooij & Russel, 2000), although lower
estimates exist (Tomasetti & Vogelstein, 2015). The model selects cells
to divide randomly rather than in waves, however the odds of the same
cell being selected repeatedly is low and the results are averaged over a
large number of niches, the effect of this is negligible and allows us to
avoid tracking individual cells.

Selection pressure, 1'. This is the probability that when a pre-existing
mutant cell divides it will do so symmetrically and self-renew. The mod-
el ﬁts a best-ﬁt curve for the optimal r value to ﬁt the data. Note that in
normal steady-state division, SSCs may divide symmetrically into Apaired
spermatogonia where both daughter cells remain stem cells or both dif-
ferentiate (de Rooij & Griswold 2012) for which there is some evidence
(Klein et al. 2010). For simplicity we have assumed, as earlier models
have done (Yoon et a]. 2009), that each stem cell divides asymmetrically
in normal homeostatic cell division rather than a balance of differentiat-
ing and self-renewing divisions.

2.4 Fitting the Model to Mutation Data

In order to match our model to existing paternal age effect data, we
started with birth incidence of various genetic diseases. The larger num-
ber of younger parents versus older ones is accounted for by looking at
Observed/Expected values, the number of births for a given age category
divided by the expected number of births assuming the total number of
disease-affected children were distributed to each age category propor-
tional to births in that population.

Using census data ﬁom 1966 USA birth data (Vital Statistics of the
United States, 1966, US. Department of Health, Education and Welfare)
to estimate a number of births per age category, Ca, (as per Risch et al.
1987), we used the M/n fraction of mutant-to-wildtype sperm for the
given age category to produce a number of disease-affected births for
that category, simulated mutant births (S).

M
S = — Ca (3.1)

12
By dividing the number of fathers in the age category by the total
population and then multiplying this proportion by the total number of
simulated mutant births, we can calculate the predicted mutant births (P)
assuming simulated mutant births are distributed proportional to the

paternal age distribution.

P:

Simulated/Predicted is therefore directly comparable to the Ob-
served/Expected data. In order to ﬁt the S/P data to the existing O/E
values, the strength of selection, r, had to be empirically determined. A
script was generated in R (R Development Core Team, 2008, URL
http://www.R-proj ect.org.) that would match the O/E values according to
the following algorithm:

(1) For a given value of r, calculate a single S/P value for the medi-
an age of the following age categories: 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-
39, 40-44, 45-49, 50-54. In each case the average age for the
category was used to generate the S/P value.

(2) Calculate the difference between each S/P value and the corre-
sponding O/E value. Take the sum of squares (SOS) of these
differences. .

(3) The process was optimized for r using R’s optim function by
searching for the r value with the lowest SOS score.

We also compared our model to high-throughput sequencing data. In this

The same procedure as above was used, except instead of SOS of O/E-
S/P, the number of mutant cells per 106 cells was used directly and the
SOS between experimental and calculated number of mutants was gen-
erated.

3 Results

Figure 2 shows the matched model and disease data graphs for 8 disor-
ders that show a strong paternal age effect. Excluding FOP as an outlier
(see discussion), the remaining predicted incidence values correlated
signiﬁcantly with the actual incidence values (Pearson’s correlation
coefﬁcient = 0.91, p<0.05). With those disorders where sequence data is
available (Costello, Apert and thanatophoric dysplasia syndromes), r
values can be compared directly between disease data and sperm muta-
tion rates and show close agreement (T OST equivalence test, s=0.0053,
p<0.05). The probabilities of positive selection varied from 0.5% to
1.5% with a mean r value of 0.0083 for r values ﬁom birth data and
0.0094 from sequence data.

0Several studies have estimated the mutation rate of achondroplasia in sperm but

have been omitted due to concerns of the methodology GVIaher et a]. 2014).

The predicted incidence rate is shown in table 2. The raw incidence
assumes the baseline mutation rate p of 4 X 10'”. However, mutation rate
varies by location in the genome and the sequence in question and of
particular interest are CpG sites. These are particularly mutable as cyto-
sine in CpG sites is a methylation site and can spontaneously deaminate
to thymine (Lynch 2010). In order to account for the increased mutation
chance, the probability of CpG-speciﬁc alleles mutating was multiplied
by a factor of 15 for a transition or 5 for a transversion (Nachman &
Crowell 2000). Additionally, a number of paternal age effect disorders
are caused by multiple mutations at a variety of loci and by looking at
disease incidence of the disorder as a metric, we include all mutations
that contribute to that disease phenotype. In order to simulate this in the
model, the aggregate probability of mutation, pa, is the probability of any

of the mutations occurring that give rise to the phenotype, with the for-
mula:

p, =1—((1—p)“) (3.3)

Where p is the baseline mutation probability and a is the number of
potential mutation sites that can produce mutant alleles.

4 Discussion

We hypothesized that one of the two Apert’s syndrome-causing muta-
tions (C755 G) has a higher incidence than the other (C75 8G) because the
former occurs at a CpG dinucleotide, which has a higher mutability due
to spontaneous deamination. Our results support this hypothesis as both
of the Apert mutations have a very similar r value with 0.0124 for
C755G compared with 0.0126 for C758G. These two distinct amino-acid
substitutions (S252W and P253R) appear therefore to have the same
selective effect on the cell and the increased incidence of S252W is
purely because of increased mutability at this site. The projected inci-
dence rate is very sensitive to the model parameters and particularly the
mutation rate. For example, achondroplasia has a high incidence rate
relative to the other diseases (1 in 27,000, see table 2). The computed r
value on the other hand was middle of the range, which failed to account
for the high incidence rate when the baseline value for p was used. Once
the value of p was increased to the level of a C—>T transition, the pre-
dicted incidence agreed well. So the site-speciﬁc mutation rate accounted
for the relatively high incidence rate of this disease.

I. Disease Data

Apert syndrome (Yoon et a]. 2009), Costello syndrome (Giannoulatou et a]. 2013),
Thanatophoric dysplasia (TD) adapted from Goriely et a]. (2009).

The predicted incidence rates, after accounting for the number of al-
leles and the mutation rate, present close to the actual values, with the
exception of ﬁbrodysplasia ossiﬁcans progressiva. This disease is anom-
alous as it is a very rare disease (one in 2 million births) but it is predict-
ed to have a high incidence rate as it is caused by a transition at a single
CpG site (Shore et a]. 2006). While the rates of substitution vary by
location in the genome, including the rates at CpG sites (Mugal & Elle-
gren 2011, Fryxell & Moon 2005), it is unlikely the substitution rate
could be low enough at this point, even if unmethylated. It might be
explained by a very low selective advantage but the projected r value is
high (0.0135), producing an O/E curve similar to achondroplasia. The
low birth prevalence is also not explained by low survival to term of
affected offspring as FOP does not show severe symptoms until later in
life or by any variation of expression of the mutant allele as it shows
complete penetrance (Petrie et al. 2009) so the low incidence rate re-
mains unexplained.

ACH — achondroplasia, FOP — ﬁbrodysplasia ossiﬁcans progressiva, TD — thana-
tophoric dysplasia.

Raw predicted incidence rates calculated with a baseline mutation rate of 4 X1041.
Adjusted rates account for variation in mutation rate at CpG dinucleotides and the
number of mutable alleles that cause the disease phenotype. Alleles denote the
number of most common genetic variants that comprise at least 95% of cases of the
disease. (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, 2016, URL: http://omim.org/).
Incidence rates of ACH is a mean value between 0.36 and 0.6 per 10,000 after
accounting for 20% of ACH cases being inherited from an affected parent. Sources:

The mutations causing thanatophoric dysplasia and achondroplasia
both cause constitutive activation of the F GFR3 but TD mutations acti-
vate the receptor more strongly, leading to a more severe phenotype
(Naski et al. 1996, Bonaventure et a]. 2007). We can therefore predict
the r value for TD to be higher than that for achondroplasia, which is
conﬁrmed by our model (TD r = 0.0105, achondroplasia r = 0.00741).
Note that both sets of data were taken from one study (Orioli et al. 1995)
in order to ensure that they are comparable.

Our estimate for r from sequence data for Apert’s syndrome (r =
0.0125) showed good agreement with that estimated by Yoon and col-
leagues, who estimated r to be 0.014 (Yoon et al. 2009), although the
value from birth data was lower (r = 0.00888).

The model presented in this paper provides a mathematical under-
standing of the accumulation of selﬁsh disease-causing mutations. We
have successfully predicted the incidence rates of different diseases

based on O/E curves and information of the molecular nature of the
mutations and estimates for the strength of selection. The selective ad-
vantage granted by these mutations is the most important factor in terms
of the exponential increase over time but the site-speciﬁc mutation rate
and the number of mutable sites plays a key role in how common the
disease is at the population level.

1 INTRODUCTION

Environmental DNA microarrays, including Phylogenetic
Oligonucleotide Arrays (POAs), are key technologies that are
well adapted to proﬁling environmental communities (Dugat-
Bony et al., 2012b). The extreme diversity of microorganisms,
however, means that molecular community exploration or spe-
ciﬁc analysis of microbial groups are faced with a new challenge:
designing group-speciﬁc probe sets that must harbour a high
coverage (i.e. being able to hybridize with all the target se-
quences) and a high speciﬁcity, showing no cross-hybridizations
with non-target sequences (Loy et al., 2008). Sensitivity (i.e.
being able to detect even low abundance targets) and uniformity
(i.e. uniform thermodynamic behaviours for all the probes) are
also main criteria in the selection of the best probe set Wagner
et al., 2007).

The development of comprehensive POAs requires integrating
large datasets produced by metagenomics projects to assess the
coverage and speciﬁcity of the probe set. Unfortunately, many
available probe design programmes are not suitable to deal with
such data (Dugat-Bony et al., 2012b). To overcome this limita-
tion, two recent strategies have been implemented (Bader et al.,
2011; Hysom et al., 2012). Despite major speed improvements,
both strategies are still not able to deﬁne explorative probes.
They only deﬁne regular oligonucleotides found uniquely in
the target group, whereas explorative probes take into account
the sequence variability within the target group to deﬁne new

combinations not yet deposited in public databases but poten-
tially present in the environment.

In spite of large amounts of data, our current vision of the
microbial diversity is, indeed, still incomplete. This is partially
explained by the tremendous diversity of microbial species, eco-
logical niches and technological limits: detecting 90% of the rich-
ness in some complex environments could require tens of
thousands of times the current sequencing effort (Quince et al.,
2008). Microarrays coupled with explorative probe design stra-
tegies are, therefore, well suited to survey complete microbial
communities, including microorganisms with uncharacterized se-
quences (Dugat-Bony et al., 2012a; Terrat et al., 2010).

Currently, the only software dedicated to POAs that allows the
design of explorative probes is the PhylArray programme
(Militon et al., 2007), which relies on group-speciﬁc alignments
before the probe design step to identify conserved probe-length
regions. Building large multiple sequence alignments, however,
represents a time-consuming task that is not compatible with
high-throughput data.

Here we propose KASpOD, a fast and alignment-free algo-
rithm to detect group-covering signature sequences allowing the
design of explorative probes.

2 METHODS

2.1 Usage

KASpOD takes as input a target sequence set and a database of
non-target sequences. The web interface accepts two parameters to
design signatures: the oligonucleotide length (18—31-mer), and the edit
distance between signatures and full-length sequences to perform speciﬁ-
city and coverage evaluation steps. The edit distance is deﬁned as the total
number of differences, gaps and/or mismatches allowed between the
probe and its target.

2.2 Algorithm
KASpOD consists of three computational stages (Fig. 1).

2.2.1 Search for group-speciﬁc k—mers The ﬁrst stage is the ex-
traction of every k—mer from both the target and the non-target groups by
using Jellyﬁsh version 1.1.4 (Marcais and Kingsford, 2011). For large
target groups (>100 sequences), a noise-reduction step is performed to
remove k—mers occurring only once. Every k-mer found in both groups is
then removed from the signature candidates, as it occurs exactly in the
non-target group.

2.2.2 Consensus signature sequences building The second stage
consists of clustering fully overlapping k-mers using CD-HIT version
4.5.4 (Li and Godzik, 2006) at an 88% identity clustering threshold.
For each cluster, a degenerate consensus signature is built taking into
account sequence variability at each position.

2.2.3 Coverage and specificity evaluation The last stage performs
a coverage assessment of each degenerate consensus k—mer against the
target group, by using PatMaN version 1.2.2 (Priifer et al., 2008).
Coverage is computed using the number of exact or non-exact (with at
most the edit distance) matches in the target group. Speciﬁcity is assessed
in the same way by comparing degenerate probes against the non-target
group sequences.

3 RESULTS

We used KASpOD to design 25-mer probes for 1295 prokaryotic
genera based on the recently published Greengenes taxonomy
(McDonald et al., 2012) (see Supplementary Data 1 for complete
procedure). Finally, 22613 group-speciﬁc signatures were de-
signed (Supplementary Table 2) and are freely available on the
KASpOD website (http://g2im.u—clermontl.fr/kaspod/about
.php). This high-quality probe set could be used to build a
POA to allow monitoring of complete prokaryotic communities
in complex environmental samples. The probe set was not
ﬁltered using thermodynamic calculations, to let the users
select the entire probe set, or subset, for their own applications,
such as Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), Fluorescence In Situ
Hybridization (FISH), gene capture or in silico for rapid se-
quence identiﬁcation.

A runtime performance analysis of the web service has been
performed and results are available in the Supplementary Data 3.

As KASpOD does not allow the generation of probes longer
than 31 nucleotides, an interesting strategy would be to combine
KASpOD and GoArrays (Rimour et al., 2005) to concatenate
two short probes with a random linker. This approach produces
oligonucleotide probes as speciﬁc as short probes and as sensitive
as long ones. KASpOD could, therefore, be used for applications
such as Functional Genes Arrays, offering the opportunity to
generate group-speciﬁc and explorative probes, allowing a
broad coverage of multiple sequence variants for a given gene
family.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Affinity propagation (AP) clustering has recently gained
increasing popularity in bioinformatics. AP clustering has the
advantage that it allows for determining typical cluster members,
the so-called exemplars. We provide an R implementation of this
promising new clustering technique to account for the ubiquity of R
in bioinformatics. This article introduces the package and presents
an application from structural biology.

Availability: The R package apc luster is available via CRAN—The
Comprehensive R Archive Network:

1 INTRODUCTION

Afﬁnity propagation (AP) is a relatively new clustering algorithm
that has been introduced by Frey and Dueck (2007). AP clustering
determines a so—called exemplar for each cluster, that is, a sample
that is most representative for this cluster. Like agglomerative
clustering, AP has the advantage that it works for any meaningful
measure of similarity between data samples. Unlike most prototype—
based clustering algorithms (like, e.g. k—means), AP does not require
a vector space structure and the exemplars are chosen among the
observed data samples and not computed as hypothetical averages
of cluster samples. These characteristics make AP clustering
particularly suitable for applications in bioinformatics: (i) many
similarity measures used in bioinformatics cannot be linked to
explicit vectorial descriptions (e. g. sequence or structure alignment
scores); (ii) the opportunity to identify a small set of exemplars
provides new potentials for exploratory analysis of biological data.

AP clustering has been used successfully for clustering
microarray/gene expression data (Frey and Dueck, 2007; Kiddle
et al., 2010; Leone et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2010; Tang et al.,
2010), in structural biology (North et al., 2011; Pandit and Skolnick,
2010; Wang et al., 2010), biological network analysis (Pavlopoulos
et al., 2008; Vasblom and Wodak, 2009; Woiniak et al., 2010) and
sequence analysis (Yang et al., 2010).

To date, no R implementation has been available. In order to
leverage afﬁnity propagation for bioinformatics applications, we
have implemented afﬁnity propagation as an R package along with
visualization tools for analyzing the results.

2 PACKAGE DESCRIPTION

The most important function is apcluster ( ) . In the simplest form, this
function can be called with only one argument, a quadratic similarity matrix.
The function returns an S4 object which contains the clustering result in a
convenient format that facilitates further processing.

Number of clusters and choice of input preferences: AP determines a
suitable number of clusters by itself, depending on a vector of input
preferences. In terms of the choice of input preferences, our package mainly
implements the strategies and functions of Frey and Dueck (2007): by default,
apcluster ( ) uses the median of similarities as input preference for all
samples. Frey and Dueck (2007) further suggest to use the minimum of
similarities as input preference if a smaller number of clusters is prefered. In
order to accommodate this strategy too and to allow for a smooth transition
between these two strategies, our implementation offers a new optional
argument q whose value determines which quantile of the similarities should
be used as input preference. For determining a meaningful range of input
preferences, the function pref erenceRange () is available. If a ﬁxed
number of clusters is desired, our package further provides the function
apclusterK(), which uses a search algorithm that adjusts the input
preference to achieve the desired number of clusters.

Exemplar-based agglomerative clustering: the package also provides a
new agglomerative clustering algorithm aggExCluster ( ) that is geared
towards the identiﬁcation of meaningful exemplars. Most importantly, this
function can be used to create a hierarchy of clusters from an AP result.

Visualization tools: in order to provide the user with tools for analyzing
clustering results, the package offers various functions for plotting clusters
(2D data only), heatmaps and dendrograms.

Similarity measures: the package further features several functions for
computing similarities for vectorial data, such as, negative distances, RBF
and Laplace kernels, etc.

Performance issues: the code made available by Frey and Dueck (2007) is
mainly based on loops over rows and/or columns. We have re—engineered the
function apc lus ter ( ) to use matrix operations only. This led to a 15—20%
reduction of runtimes, at the cost of additional memory consumption. If the
user’s R system is conﬁgured to distribute matrix operations over several
cores/processors, our code can make use of this parallelization instantly
without any interaction or conﬁguration from the user’s side. For large
datasets and memory—tight systems, a memory—efﬁcient implementation a la
Frey and Dueck is still available as the function apclusterLM ( ) .

3 EXAMPLE: CLUSTERING COILED COILS

We consider the exploratory analysis of coiled coil sequences as
a brief example. Coiled coils are an important structural motif in
which two or more a—helices are coiled together. Approximately 6%
of the proteins in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) contain a coiled
coil motif, many of which fulﬁll important biological functions, e.g.
gene transcription or viral membrane fusion. Dimers (two helices)
and trimers (three helices) are the most important types and together

Fig. 1. (3) Structures of a typical trimer (left) and typical dimer (right).
(b) Two clusters of coiled coil sequences determined by afﬁnity propagation:

and top dimer patterns are indicated below the alignments in blue and orange,
respectively.

account for ~95% of known coiled coils; see Figure 1a for typical 3D
structures of dimeric and trimeric coiled coils. Coiled coil segments
are usually made up of repeats of blocks of seven amino acids, the
so—called heptad repeats. Those seven residues are usually annotated
with letters a—g, where positions a and d are often occupied by
hydrophobic residues and positions e and g are often occupied by
charged residues (Mason and Arndt, 2004).

Mahrenholz et al. (2011) have studied which sequence
characteristics determine whether a given coiled coil segment tends
to form a dimer or trimer. Mahrenholz et al. (2011) found out that pair
interactions of amino acids are the key to understanding coiled coil
oligomerization and, consequently, propose a custom string kernel
based on pair interactions, the coiled coil kernel, upon which they
base their prediction tool PrOCoil.

The coiled coil kernel is a similarity measure that is tailored
to coiled coil sequences and has proven suitable for predicting
oligomerization with high accuracy. Therefore, the coiled coil
kernel is an ideal choice for clustering this type of sequences,
too. We used the coiled coil dataset of Mahrenholz et al. (2011)
consisting of a selection of 477 conﬁrmed coiled coils (385 dimers
and 92 trimers) from the PDB and proceeded as follows to
identify most typical coiled coil sequences: adopting the coiled coil
kernel with the same settings as in (Mahrenholz et al., 2011) as
sequence similarity measure, we ﬁrst used pre f erenceRange ( )
to determine reasonable input preferences. We decided to use a

default input preference of —1 for all further studies. We then
used apcluster () to cluster dimeric and trimeric sequences
separately. This resulted in 13 clusters of dimeric sequences and
4 clusters of trimeric sequences. As examples, let us consider trimer
cluster no. 3 (27 sequences) and dimer cluster no. 7 (37 sequences)
in the following. Figure 1 shows multiple alignments of both clusters
(insigniﬁcant positions have been omitted). The exemplars of both
clusters are highlighted in boldface. It is quite obvious that the
two exemplars are exactly those sequences that have the highest
similarity to all other sequences in the cluster. This is also clearly
visible from the excellent matching of the exemplars with the
sequence logos displayed on top of the alignments. Below the
alignments, we displayed the heptad annotation and which of the
most indicative oligomerization patterns according to Mahrenholz
et al. (2011) match the majority of sequences in the cluster. We
see that all top ﬁve dimer patterns E...Lg, L...Nd, N..La, E.Ee and
N.....Ee are well represented in dimer cluster no. 7 and its exemplar
sequence. Of the top ﬁve trimer patterns (Mahrenholz et al., 2011),
three occur prominently in trimer cluster no. 3: E..Ie, E....Kb and
I...Id, two of which occur twice or more often in the cluster and in
the corresponding exemplar.

This example illustrates that AP successfully identiﬁes suitable
exemplars for clusters of sequences. We are convinced that using AP
in such a way has great potential for exploratory sequence analysis.
AP provides the user with a small set of exemplars that can be studied
in more detail, while the user can rely on the fact that biological
knowledge obtained from investigating these exemplars is largely
valid for all sequences in the dataset considered.

Abstract

Motivation: Within bioinformatics, the textual alignment of amino acid sequences has long domi—
nated the determination of similarity between proteins, with all that implies for shared structure,
function and evolutionary descent. Despite the relative success of modern—day sequence alignment
algorithms, so—called alignment—free approaches offer a complementary means of determining and
expressing similarity, with potential benefits in certain key applications, such as regression ana—
lysis of protein structure—function studies, where alignment—base similarity has performed poorly.

Results: Here, we offer a fresh, statistical physics—based perspective focusing on the question of
alignment—free comparison, in the process adapting results from ‘first passage probability distribu—
tion’ to summarize statistics of ensemble averaged amino acid propensity values. In this article, we

introduce and elaborate this approach.

1 Introduction

Determining the similarity between macromolecules is central to
bioinformatics. While comparison of 3—dimensional macromolecu—
lar structures remains an active area, most work focuses on macro-
molecular sequences. From sequence similarity devolves much of
our understanding of evolutionary homology and probable struc—
tural and functional relatedness, allowing sequences to be grouped
in a meaningful way. It is the basis of inherited or inferred functional
annotation, allowing us to deduce the broad function of proteins in
newly sequenced genomes.

Similarity is determined, almost exclusively, through the
alignment of sequences as text. Textual sequence similarity is
taken as a surrogate for common ancestry and, by extension,
functional and structural similarity. Most approaches to protein
sequence similarity use models of sequence evolution and com—
pare amino—acid strings, searching for linear conservation of
sequence.

Sequence alignment, where equivalent or near—equivalent sym—
bols are brought into register, has been investigated intensely for
many decades (Altschul, 1991; Vinga and Almeida, 2003), and thus
an enormous associated literature has accumulated. Typically,

substitution matrices specify a score for aligning pairs of nucleotides
or amino acids; in such matrices different amino acids or nucleotides
score differently according to the potential likelihood that one will
replace the other in a sequence. For amino acids, many matrices
have been published, based on many rationales (Feng et 61]., 1984;
Taylor, 1986), including the genetic code and amino acid physico—
chemical properties. Most commonly—used matrices are typically
derived empirically from exhaustive comparison of known se—
quences or structures.

The log—odds matrices (Schwartz and Dayhoff, 1978) derived
from the PAM model of protein evolution (Dayhoff et 61]., 1978)
was, for many years, the most widely used. Statistical results indi—
cate such matrices adopt an implicit ‘log—odds’ form, with a specific
target distribution for aligned residue pairs. The sensitivity of pro—
tein sequence searching depends on the selection of appropriate sub—
stitution matrices (Henikoff and Henikoff, 1992; 1993; Pearson,
1995). BLOSUM, and other commonly—used matrices, constructed
from particular sets of related proteins, are tailored to target
frequencies reﬂecting implied standard background amino acid
compositions.

While probabilistic extensions to sequence alignment, such as
profiles and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), can capture pos—
ition-specific variation in multiple alignments, and typically demon—
strate significantly augmented sensitivity, all alignment methods
remain prone to similar limitations.

Compared to sequence alignment, alternative approaches,
grouped together as alignment—free techniques, and first proposed
by Blaisdell (1986), have not been investigated as thoroughly
(Davies et al., 2007). Extant methods fall into several groups; of
these, perhaps the most explored approach focuses on sequence
comparison based on the joint sub—word or k—tuple content of
groups of sequences, and their analysis using increasingly sophisti-
cated probabilistic statistics.

Amongst other approaches, methods based on plotting so—called
propensity scales (Nakai et al., 1988) have enjoyed long—standing
popularity; with scales mirroring one or more amino acid properties,
such as hydrophobicity (Hopp and Woods, 1981) or electronegativ—
ity. Such scales abound: AAindex has collected 545 different pub—
lished scales (Kawashima et al., 2008). Others have summarized
such data, producing, inter alia, three (Hellberg et al., 1987) or five
scales (Sandberg et al., 1998; Venkatarajan and Braun, 2001).

A propensity scale is a means to characterize numerically local
sequence properties, usually plotting amino acid properties along a
sequence. Plotting individual values is of little value however unless
there is an obvious periodicity. More helpful is to average the values
using a moving or sliding window: typically using a ﬂat, symmet—
rical window of no more than 10—20 amino acids in length. A mov—
ing window can have several potential parameters: first, the scale
chosen; second, the window length; third, the window shape; fourth,
whether the window is symmetrical or unbalanced; and fifthly, how
values are smoothed after averaging. Typically, windows are short,
ﬂat, and symmetrical about the central residue, which takes the
averaged value. Several different window shapes have been sug—
gested, corresponding to weighting each position independently.

Independent of the exact parameters used to define the window
function, various kinds of smoothing are available, including digital
filtering, integral transforms (Fourier and Cosine), and wavelet ana—
lysis, each with their own characteristics. Smoothing seeks to reduce
the random component of the initial value spectrum generated by
windowing, with the high—frequency regions removed, leaving only
dominant low—frequency modes.

The value of individual propensity plots is limited. It works well,
say, for predicting transmembrane regions within proteins, where
peaks in the plot can correlate well with regions highly enriched in
hydrophobic residues. Hitherto, it has proved difficult to interpret
such plots other than by a peak—spotting. Several decades ago, most
predictors were based on identifying maximally valued regions of se—
quences; essentially looking for peaks, or troughs, in some form of a
propensity plot. Epitopes, such as immunological T- or B-cell
epitopes (Deavin et al., 1996; Hopp and Woods, 1981); loops and
surface exposure (Dovidchenko et al., 2008); and transmembrane
helices (Sipos and von Heijne, 1993) were—and often still are—
predicted this way. Propensity scales have also been used in QSAR
studies, particularly those focusing on peptides (Hellberg et al.,
1987; Sandberg et al., 1998).

In what follows, we take a decisive step away from such ana—
lyses, using techniques drawn from statistical physics. Specifically,
we use techniques from the rich literature of first passage probability
distribution, sometimes referred to as the ‘persistence’ problem
(Bush and Chattopadhyay, 2014; Derrida et al., 1995; Majumdar,
1996; Bray, 2013; Redner, 2007); applying them for the first time to
sequence analysis. Persistence analysis has found applications in

many fields including, inter alia: stock market analysis (Ren, 2005),
modeling immunological systems (Chattopadhyay and Burroughs,
2007), extremal value statistics pertaining to data degradation
(Whitmore, 1986), modeling the population biology of HIV dy—
namics (Tuckwell and Wan, 2000), event detection time for mobile
sensor networks (Inaltekin et al., 2007), and supply chain optimiza-
tion (Wakuta, 2000).

In this article, we develop and analyze propensity data by model—
ing sequences as a time—series, estimating the scaling regime of a gen-
eralized probability density function (PDF) of a variable derived
from the original propensity data structure. Our protocol enables us
to abstract key features from propensity plots while remaining free
of any text—based alignment scheme. We then apply this alignment-
independent approach to the analysis of protein sequences, evaluat—
ing it as a potential means of automatically characterizing and
clustering large numbers of sequences.

2 Persistence Analysis: Deriving Order
Parameters from Protein Sequences

The idea underlying persistence analysis is simple. It relies on the
nature of the PDF of stochastic time series data X(t): in our case,
ensemble—averaged propensity scale data. The basic question asked is:
what is the probability [)(t) that the field X(t) has not changed sign up
to time t, starting from an initial configuration X(t0)? An equivalent
question would be: what is the probability p(t1,t2) that the field X(t)
changes sign N times between t1 and t2 for X(t) > <X>? In our case,
<X> : X0 or the mean value of the time series data X(t). Depending
on the nature of the ‘random walk’—in this case a protein sequence—
this probability is given by p(t1,t2) N (t1/t2)'m; where the exponent ‘m’
assumes different values depending on whether this probability is cal-
culated using data above or below a certain threshold. The threshold
is typically the mean value (X0) of the stochastic data. Thus multiple
‘order parameters’ may emerge from the same description depending
on the chosen value of ‘m’.

Our approach utilizes ‘extremal value statistics’ to analyze
sequence structure. This builds on a tacit first approximation that
sequences—as represented by propensity plots—can be seen as being
predominantly stochastic in structure, at least when viewed synop—
tically. At this stage, the focus is on a specific manifestation, that of
the ‘first passage probability’ distribution around the mean value X0
of the data points X(t) where ‘t’ is our metaphor for the location of
the data point in the time series—like sequence. What this ‘first pas—
sage statistics’ captures is the distribution of the ‘return times’ of the
ﬂuctuating ‘time series’ across the given threshold X (t) : X0.

Figure 1 shows the ‘return time lengths’ from data points below
the line X(t):X0 to one above this line and then back again to
X(t) <X0. As an example, t+(1) defines the first ‘plus’—type return
time where ‘plus’ refers to the regime X(t) > X0 such that the time
series starts from a point below this line (X(t) < X0) and after
crossing this line returns back to the regime X(t) <X0. Similarly,
t+(2) refers to the second such ‘plus—type’ return time; and so on.

a”) refers instead to the first ‘minus—type’ return time where the
time series count starts at X(t) > X0, then crosses the threshold line
in to the X (t) < X0 regime and finally returns to X (t) > X0.

Our interest is in the probability distributions of the t+ and t-
transitions. Such a probability distribution is achieved by calculating
histograms of ‘return times’ above (t+) and below (t_) the line
X(t) : X0. The histograms are then normalized to obtain the desired
PDFs. We assume that sequences are, to a first approximation,
‘inherently random’. As long as we are within the stochastic realm,
all prior statistical results, including that for long range correlated

identify the exponent for X (t) > X0 and m_ for the exponent charac—
terizing X(t) <X0. We now focus on this two dimensional (mmi)
plane where n = +,—.

3 Methods

Here, we characterize protein sequences using an alignment—free ap—
proach based on techniques of time series analysis commonly—used
in statistical physics and elsewhere (Bray, 2013; Redner, 2007).

3.1 Plotting of propensity data
In general, a window could adopt any arbitrary shape; thus we may
assume a generalized window will have this form:

n m
—P _ p p 17
Vi — wkSi + k2: wkSi—k + 1:: wlSi+l

Within the window there will be m amino acids that are to be aver—
aged upstream of the target residue, and will have 11 amino acids
downstream, plus the value for the residue itself; all residues within
the window will have independent and arbitrary coefficients (w)
that will selectively weight individual positions within the travelling
window. Averaging can be undertaken several times: values aver—
aged over any particular iteration being the values generated by
averaging in the previous iteration.

We extracted 544 useable propensity values from AAIndex
(Kawashima et al., 2008). All scales were used. Sequences were con—
verted to numerical profiles comprising propensity values. Using a
window length of 7, one round of uniform smoothing was used per
sequence. Each sequence behaved as intrinsically stochastic time ser—
ies—like data. For each sequence processed, we generated 544 differ—
ent smoothed profiles, corresponding to the 544 scales from
AAindex. Each of these 544 datasets was arranged in N column vec—
tors, where each column vector represented a sequence. The number
of entries in each of these column vectors was identical. The block
structure is a matrix M (N X 5 44) where each element of this matrix
is a column vector.

3.2 Propensity analysis
For each sequence drawn from Pfam (Finn et al., 2014), and for
each of the 544 AAindex propensity scales, separate m+ and m-

values were calculated from the corresponding t+ and t- data. For
each sequence, the arithmetic means of 544 141+ and 544 m__values
were derived: this gave the ‘order parameter’ m:0.5"'(m+—l—m_).
This is akin to statistical ‘ensemble averaging’, including any cogent
non—ergodicity of the ensemble. The order parameter m thus repre—
sents each protein sequence as a single number. The resulting m-val-
ues were then used to cluster the sequences using the scheme
detailed below. The schematic algorithm for calculating the values
m+ and m- value for each of N sequences is shown below:

1. (141+, m_) calculated for each of the 544 column vectors of row i
of the M-matrix

2. Ensemble average (arithmetical mean) taken of (141+, m_) for all
5 44 vectors in row i of the M-matrix

3. Steps 1—2 repeated N times, for all 544 vectors in each row, to
generate N—sets of (141+, m_)

Our ‘order parameter’ is thus the mean of the previously defined m+
and m- values obtained individually as ‘scaling exponents’ (‘persist—
ence exponents’) of the t+ (or t_) PDFs. The ultimate objective of
this analysis was a clear clustering of the protein sequences such that
similar proteins fall into separate clusters that are defined by separ—
ate combinations of (mmi) values (coordinate location in the mn—i
space) where n = +, — and 1': position of the protein sequence along
the x—axis. Clustering follows the logic below:

1. Plot (141+, m-) versus relevant sequence number to generate the
phase diagram

2. Grouping of (141+, m-) versus sequence number i in the phase
diagram

3. Starting from the phase diagram deﬁned in 2, estimate
dm : mi —1— 1 — mi, f = (1 —l— dm)"'di between every two points rep—
resenting each sequence.

4. Plot f versus 1' using a ﬁrst adjustable threshold (mean of the sep—
aration distances in the phase diagram plot) that separates out
the large f’s form the small f’s. Use dendogram based MATLAB
clustering protocol

5. Since the dendogram generates more clusters than the system
actually has, use a second threshold (standard deviation of the
data points in the phase diagram plot) and repeat step 2. The
clustering accuracy will be shown by the level of gradient equal—
ity (see Fig. 3)

Clustering data are then plotted sequentially to evaluate the size of
successive clusters. The PDFs of cluster lengths exhibit power-law
scaling. More importantly, the scaling exponents can be used to
compare the clustering accuracy of the Matlab—inbuilt architecture.
Comparing this to known clusters provides the probabilistic values
of the two external parameters determining the eventual cluster
quality.

3.3 Application to test cases

We extracted one arbitrary but representative sequence family from
each superfamily in the Pfam database (version 27.0, March 2013,
14831 families; Finn et al., 2014). Seed sequences were used in pref—
erence to final sequence sets, for reasons of reliability, since mem-
bers were chosen by human experts without the involvement of
potentially—unreliable automated methods. Downloaded alignments
were converted to un-gapped sequence sets.

Figure 3 is an accuracy—check of our algorithm, estimating the
cluster size distribution D. The gradients of the dotted and dashed
lines in the log-log plots (cluster PDF of size) in Figure 3 are com—
pared with that of the solid line (actual data) in identifying the ‘best

the location and size of resulting clusters is not 100% accurate, yet
it is clear from Figure 2 that mismatches are generally marginal. We
also calculated two widely—used quality indices as summary meas—
ures of the Pfam clustering. The cluster separation measure of
Davies and Bouldin (1979) gave a value of 0.75032, while the Dunn
compactness index was 0.03296. Both values are consistent with ex—
cellent overall clustering.

The data in Figures 2 and 3 establish the robustness of our algo—
rithm. Using sequence—data with different overall characteristics and
number of independent clusters (shown in panel 1 of Fig. 2: our
benchmark), our results show that irrespective of the low accuracy
of the cluster distribution gradient value (‘p’), as clearly seen from
the non-parallel lines of Figure 3, cluster identification, results in
highly accurate discrimination of groups. In other work, concentrat—
ing on more readily-apparent similarity within single Pfam clans, we
have found using our current minimal and unoptimized method
similar reliability at a much finer granularity. Together, these results
demonstrate this sequence representation is both consistent and dis—
criminatory at both high and low granularity.

4 Discussion

The analysis of sequence similarity is the cornerstone upon which
much of bioinformatics is built. Hitherto, alignment—based
approaches have completely dominated work in this area, while
other approaches, of which there are several (Davies et al., 2007),
have been examined with much less thoroughness. Yet the need for
effective approaches, able to transcend the limitations of text match—
ing, is clear, if not widely appreciated.

The protocol described here takes propensity plots produced
from the 544 scales in AAindex (Kawashima et al., 2008), averages
them, and generates a single value characteristic of a whole se—
quence. Our implementation is, in essence, an out—of—the—box appli—
cation of existing results, with immense potential for future
refinement. We have applied here a well—understood statistical
method from stochastic mathematics, using it to interpret and iden—
tify independent clusters in protein sequence data. Our approach
introduces a fundamentally new way to represent sequences which
is nonetheless founded on the long—standing concept of propensity
scales, and, capitalizing on features of this representation, we have
used it to power a novel approach to clustering. This method is able
to capture much of the overall structure of a propensity plot in a sin-
gle but discriminatory and self—consistent value.

Many properties of a protein are encoded within its sequence in
a subtle and recondite manner not amendable to direct identification
through sequence alignment or the recognition of characteristic se—
quence motifs. Likewise, the discovery of functionally—similar but
sequence—distinct proteins may be frustrated by a lack of ostensive
similarity to proteins of known provenance. In such a situation,
alignment—dependent approaches may produce ambiguous results or
fail completely.

There are many examples where structural or functional similar-
ities are readily apparent experimentally, yet are difficult—if not im-
possible—to detect from textual sequence alignment. Perhaps the
most obvious are the so—called twilight and midnight zones (Rost,
1999). Most protein sequences will fold into unique 3-dimensional
structures, and similar sequences will typically have similar struc—
tures. Sequence alignments can routinely distinguish between se—
quence pairs known to have similar or non—similar structures when
the sequence identity is greater than >40%. This unequivocal signal
becomes lost at 20—35% sequence identity: the so—called twilight

zone. Alignment-methods often fail to align paired amino—acids cor—
rectly even with 20—30% identity. Structural alignment has revealed
many, many examples of so—called structural superfamilies, where
proteins with less than 10% identity nonetheless retain structural
propinquity (Flower, 1993; Flower et al., 1993). The average iden—
tity between all sequence pairs of related structures is 8—10%, and
this marks the midnight zone, which is predominantly populated by
protein structures that have become similar by convergent
evolution.

Thus, we need to apply our approach to a variety of both solved
and unsolved problems to explore its value. Solved problems include
searching within and beyond the twilight zone, and to classify and
identify structural and functional relationships within it effectively,
it is imperative to explore alternative approaches to pairwise similar—
ity and BLAST statistics (Karlin and Altschul, 1990). Unsolved
problems include clustering whole genomes where the result is un—
known, and is complicated by the presence of multi domain pro—
teins, internal repeats, etc.; the development of regression models
using our order parameter values as descriptors; and a surrogate of
sequence searching using order values to define similarity measures.

In protein design there is a need to move beyond making piece—
meal changes to extant sequences to identify wholly new sequences
with new functions and structures. Effective alignment free
approaches should allow us to address such issues, particularly
through the development of properly grounded regression
approaches to protein sequence analysis. There are many examples
of such approaches: the proteochemometric analysis of protein se—
quences (van Westen et al., 2013), the prediction of candidate vac—
cines (Doytchinova and Flower, 2007a,b), and the successful
assignment of bacterial proteins to various subcellular locations
(Sjostrom et al., 1995).

Regression approaches typically require three viable compo—
nents: an induction engine (based on multivariate statistics, such as
PLS, or a machine learning algorithm), data to be modeled (which
can be quantitative or categorical in nature), and an appropriate
data representation. Data modeling methods have reached sufficient
maturity, and data quality is constrained by its availability on a
case—by—case basis, so increasingly it is the choice of data representa—
tion that is the crucial arbiter of success. This is especially true for
protein regression, which lags far behind equivalent work for small
molecules. Alignment—independent similarity measures, such as our
representation, offer an interesting and seemingly productive avenue
for achieving progress in this endeavor.

To go beyond sequence motifs and profiles, HMMs and like
methodology—and thus identify common function, structure, and
evolution—new, distinct, yet complimentary, methods must be
devised: alignment—free methods that can work with textual align-
ment to identity similarity manifest as shared structure and function.

In this article, we have used results from statistical physics to
address alignment—free comparison, adapting results from ‘first
passage probability distribution’ to derive a single summary value
able to differentiate sequence groups with high accuracy at several
levels of granularity. This approach is potential highly robust being
largely independent of fluctuation in the tunable parameters. We an—
ticipate that this approach will ultimately take its place alongside
textual alignment as a strongly complimentary method for sequence
analysis, with many advantages compared to conventional
techniques.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Analysis of differential gene expression by RNA sequen-
cing (RNA-Seq) is frequently done using feature counts, i.e. the
number of reads mapping to a gene. However, commonly used
count algorithms (e.g. HTSeq) do not address the problem of reads
aligning with multiple locations in the genome (multireads) or reads
aligning with positions where two or more genes overlap (ambiguous
reads). Rcount specifically addresses these issues. Furthermore,
Rcount allows the user to assign priorities to certain feature types
(e.g. higher priority for protein-coding genes compared to rRNA-
coding genes) or to add flanking regions.

Availability and implementation: Rcount provides a fast and easy-
to-use graphical user interface requiring no command line or program-
ming skills. It is implemented in C+ + using the Squn (www.seqan.
de) and the Qt libraries (qt-project.org). Source code and 64
bit binaries for (Ubuntu) Linux, Windows (7) and MacOSX are released
under the GPLv3 license and are freely available on github.com/
MWSchmid/Rcount.

1 INTRODUCTION

RNA-Seq is the method of choice for transcriptional proﬁling
and differential expression (DE) studies. For DE analysis, meth-
ods based on negative binomial modeling, such as the popular
DESeq (Anders et al., 2010) and edgeR (Robinson et al., 2010),
have been shown to outperform other methods in terms of spe-
ciﬁcity, sensitivity and control of false positives (Rapaport et al.,
2013). Current work ﬂows for DE analysis generally involve the
(i) alignment of the short reads to a reference genome, (ii) quan-
tiﬁcation of expression levels and (iii) comparison between dif-
ferent treatments, tissue/cell types and time-points (Anders et al.,
2013).

Read counting and read summarization are essential steps in
any RNA-Seq workﬁow. However, they have received little at-
tention. Speciﬁcally for RNA-Seq, counting is not as simple as it
may appear. First, a read may align multiple times with the
genome (multireads). Second, several genes may overlap at a
given position within the genome. Reads aligning with those
positions are ambiguous with respect to the gene they originate

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

from (ambiguous reads). Third, alignments can span exon-
junctions (exon-junction reads). Furthermore, a gene may have
several isoforms. However, DE analysis is often performed using
the total number of reads per gene.

Popular open source tools for read counting, such as HTSeq
(www-huber.embl.de/users/anders/HTSeq), BEDTools (Quinlan
and Hall, 2010) and featureCounts (Liao et al., 2014), do not
speciﬁcally address all three issues. Multireads are not treated
speciﬁcally by any of these programs and are generally discarded,
although this problem has been addressed for ChIP-Seq data
analysis (Chung et al., 2011). Ambiguous reads are counted re-
peatedly for each gene by BEDTools and featureCounts (option-
ally), whereas HTSeq discards them. HTSeq and featureCounts
both consider exon-junction reads, whereas BEDTools does not.
ERANGE addresses all three problems, but uses RPKM (reads
per kilobase per million) instead of counts throughout the whole
algorithm. Moreover, a conversion to counts during the algo-
rithm is not possible (Mortazavi et al., 2008).

Here we describe Rcount, a fast and simple GUI tool for
ﬂexible RNA-Seq read counting. It builds on the algorithm
described in Schmid et a]. (2012), and further allows for editing
the genome annotation and assigning priorities to certain feature
types (see Figure 1A for details on genomic feature types).

2 DESCRIPTION

Rcount takes read alignments ﬁles (BAM, Binary Alignment/
Map) and a reference genome annotation (GFF/ GTF/ BED,
General Feature Format/Gene Transfer Format/Browser
Extensible Data) as input, and counts the number of reads per
gene, taking into account multireads, ambiguous reads and exon-
junction reads (Fig. 1). It has three modules: Rcount-multireads,
Rcount-format and Rcount-distribute.

Rcount-multireads assigns weights to each alignment of a mul-
tiread (Fig. 1B). The weight H,- of an individual alignment 1' is
calculated using a score S,- divided by the sum of scores from all
alignments of the multiread (HES/2:15,). S,- is currently
implemented as the sum of coverage (number of reads per
base) originating from uniquely aligned reads at the position of
the alignment 1' and the surrounding region (the size can be set by
the user). If an alignment spans an exon junction, S,- equals to the
number of uniquely aligned reads spanning the same exon junc-
tion. Thus, if a multiread has both types of alignments, the
ungapped ones are generally preferred. The weight is automatic-
ally added as XszzH, tag to the alignments in the BAM ﬁle.

Rcount-format reads the reference genome annotation in GFF/
GTF/ BED format, displays the structure of the genome annota-
tion and saves it in an XML format required by Rcount-distribute.

Fig. 1. Schematic Rcount algorithm used to calculate gene expression
values. (A) After initial quality checks have been performed, the reads
are aligned to a reference genome, preferentially with a splice-aware
aligner [we tested TopHat2 (Kim et al, 2013), Subread (Liao et al,
2013) and STAR (Dobin et al, 2013)]. (B) Alignments of multireads
are weighted based on the number of uniquely aligned reads in the neigh-
borhood. (C) In a ﬁrst round, alignments are mapped to all annotated
transcripts and treated as unambiguous. Temporary expression values are
calculated (c,) and used to ﬁlter the transcripts (optionally, transcripts
with uncovered 3’ ends are ﬁltered as well). (D) In a second round, am-
biguous alignments are distributed based on unambiguous alignments,
resulting in ﬁnal expression values (cf)

During this process, the user can extend the genes (add ﬂanking
regions) or remove features from the annotation. Depending on
the library preparation protocol, some of the features in the
genome annotation are less likely to be sequenced (e.g. rRNA-
coding genes with poly(A)-selective library preparation proto-
cols). The user can choose to remove these features or to assign
a lower priority to them. If a read aligns to a location where two
genes with different priorities overlap, it is automatically assigned
to the one with higher priority.

Rcount-distribute sums up the weights of the alignments (hits)
per gene in two steps. In the ﬁrst step, all hits are mapped to all
genes (i.e. their transcripts). Transcripts of truly expressed genes

should generally have at least some hits in the vicinity of their 3’
end (e. g. due to poly(A)-tail priming during library preparation)
and/or at least a minimal total number of hits (user-speciﬁed).
Transcripts not matching these criteria are discarded during the
ﬁrst round (Fig. 1C). During the second step, the hits are divided
into unambiguous and ambiguous. The unambiguous hits are
assigned ﬁrst and subsequently used to proportionally distribute
the ambiguous hits (Fig. 1D). The transcripts are re—ﬁltered using
the same criteria as before. The ﬁnal expression value cf of a gene
is then calculated as the sum of hits assigned to any of its tran-
scripts (Fig. 1D).

The ﬁnal output is one count table per sample. In addition to
the ﬁnal expression values, the output table also contains the
number of unambiguous and ambiguous (before and after dis-
tributing them) hits per gene (either on the whole gene length, or
only within a certain number of bases from the 3’ end of the
transcript, which can be speciﬁed by the user). To extract a cer-
tain column or to merge multiple samples for downstream
analyses, an R script is provided on github.com/MWSchmid/
Rcount.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: The formation of aragonite mineral in the mollusk shell or
pearl nacre requires the participation of a diverse set of proteins that
form the mineralized extracellular matrix. Although self-assembly pro-
cesses have been identified for several nacre proteins, these proteins
do not contain known globular protein—protein binding domains. Thus,
we hypothesize that other sequence features are responsible for nacre
matrix protein—protein assembly processes and ultimately aragonite
biosynthesis.

Results: Of 39 mollusk aragonite-associated protein sequences,
100% contain at least one region of intrinsic disorder or unfolding,
with the highest percentages found in framework and pearl-associated
proteins relative to the intracrystalline proteins. In some instances,
these intrinsically disordered regions were identified as bind/fold
sequences, and a limited number correlate with known biomineral-
relevant sequences. Interestingly, 95% of the aragonite-associated
protein sequences were found to contain at least one occurrence of
amyloid-like or cross-,8 strand aggregation-prone supersecondary
motifs, and this correlates with known aggregation and aragonite for-
mation functions in three experimentally tested protein sequences.
Collectively, our findings indicate that aragonite-associated proteins
have evolved signature sequence traits of intrinsic disorder and
aggregation-prone regions that are important for their role(s) in matrix
assembly and mineralization.

1 INTRODUCTION

The nacre layer of the mollusk shell and pearl deposit are both
high-performance composites consisting of the calcium carbon-
ate polymorph, aragonite and polysaccharides and proteins
(Falini et al., 2011; Levi-Kalisman et al., 2001). The protein
and polysaccharide macromolecular components form a 3D la-
mellar network around each single-crystal aragonite tablet that
contributes to the architecture, organization and molecular prop-
erties of the nacre layer (F alini et al., 2011; Smith et al., 1999).
Although we are still in the early stages of understanding the

role(s) that proteins play in nacre construction, it is clear that
some proteins are self-associative and participate in the forma-
tion and stabilization of fracture-resistant single-crystal aragonite
(Amos et al., 2010, 2011; Marie et al., 2010; Ponce and Evans,
2011), whereas other proteins have different responsibilities, such
as enzyme catalysis (Berland et al., 2011), protease activities
(Marie et al., 2010) and cell receptor binding WVeiss et al.,
2001). Thus far, three different classes of nacre-associated pro-
teins have been identiﬁed in mollusks. The framework or inter-
lamellar protein family is associated with the ,B-chitin
polysaccharide-containing water-insoluble tri-layer matrix that
surrounds each aragonite tablet (Berland et al., 2011; Samata
et al., 1999; Suzuki et al., 2010, 2011). In contrast, the intracrys-
talline protein family is extracted as a water-soluble fraction and
is intercalated or found in organic inclusions within aragonite
(Marie et al., 2010; Michenfelder et al., 2003; Suzuki et al.,
2011). Lastly, there is a family of proteins associated with the
formation of the nacre pearl deposit (Liu et al., 2007).
Collectively, few of these nacre proteins possess known globular
binding domains that are typically associated with protein assem-
bly (Berland et al., 2011; Marie et al., 2010; Michenfelder et al.,
2003; Samata et al., 1999; Suzuki et al., 2010, 2011; Weiss et al.,
2001). Hence, there must be other sequence features that drive
nacre protein matrix assembly, which, in turn, drives aragonite
formation.

Recent bioinformatics studies revealed that intrinsically dis-
ordered and aggregation-prone domains exist within the diverse
set of human extracellular matrix protein (HECMP) sequences
(Peysselon et al., 2011). These domains are believed to be respon-
sible for observed matrix assembly and hierarchal ordering of the
HECM. We hypothesize that similar sequence features must be
at work in the aragonite extracellular matrix protein (AECMP)
scenario as well. With this in mind, we initiated a bioinformatics
study of 39 AECMP sequences arising from seven different mol-
luscan species (Supplementary Table S1). These sequences were
analyzed at the global level for intrinsic disorder and aggregation
propensities. Our study indicates that all AECMP sequences pos-
sess one or more disordered sequence regions, with 51% pre-
dicted to possess one or more bind/fold recognition regions.
Interestingly, 95% of the AECMPs were found to possess
aggregation-prone, amyloid- or prion-like cross-,6 strand super-
secondary motifs. We conclude that, as per the human ECM,
intrinsically disordered and aggregation-prone sequences are key
molecular features that contribute to the formation and function
of mollusk nacre.

Aragonite-associated biomineralization proteins

 

2 METHODS

The AECMP library was compiled from the complete primary sequences
of 39 published aragonite-associated proteins obtained from the
GenBank, UniProt or Swiss-Prot using ‘pear ’, ‘nacre’, ‘matrix’, ‘aragon—
ite’ and ‘mollusca’ as key search terms (Supplementary Table S1) for
sequences deposited prior to March 2012. All isoforms of the n16
(Samata et al., 1999; Suzuki et al., 2010) and Pinctada fucata mantle
gene (PFMG) (Liu et al., 2007) families were included in this sequence
library. All isoforms of the n16 (Samata et al., 1999; Suzuki et al., 2010)
and PFMG (Liu et al., 2007) families were included in this sequence
library. All sequences were further subdivided into three categories (11
intracrystalline, 16 framework and 12 pearl) based on known published
data or National Center for Biotechnology Information sequence ﬁle
identiﬁers that denote their tissue localization and/or their extractability
in aqueous media from the nacre matrix (intracrystalline = soluble,
frameworkzinsoluble) or the oyster pearl (‘pearl’ = pearl associated)
(Falini et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2007; Marie et al., 2010; Michenfelder
et al., 2003; Samata et al., 1999; Suzuki et al., 2010, 2011; Weiss et al.,
2000, 2001). Putative signal peptide regions were identiﬁed using ExPASy
Signal P software (Petersen et al., 2011), and these signal regions were
deleted from each DNA-derived primary sequence prior to the analyses
described below.

To determine the percentage and the location of disordered sequence
regions within AECMPs, we used the IUP_PRED (Dosztanyi et al.,
2005), GLOBPLOT (Linding et al., 2003) and DISOPRED (Ward
et al., 2004) prediction algorithms with standard defaults. Subsequently,
we used a suite of programs to globally identify putative sequence regions
that exhibit association propensities. The ANCHOR protein—protein
binding algorithm was applied (default parameters) to locate IUP-
identiﬁed disordered regions that have the propensity to energetically
partner with another protein (Mészaros et al., 2009). This algorithm
was originally used to identify sensitive disordered regions that fold
when contacting a globular protein. However, in our instance, we are
using these methods to probe the potential folding sensitivity or propen-
sity of aragonite-associated sequence domains without regard for the
nature of the stabilizing target. The location of ANCHOR domains
were correlated against known biomineralization—relevant sequences
(Supplementary Table S2 and S3). The TANGO algorithm (Linding
et al., 2004) was used to identify aggregation propensities. Finally, to
test the relative accuracy of cross-,8 strand amyloid-like sequence predic-
tions, we used the predictive algorithms BETASCAN (Bryan et al., 2009),
AGGRESCAN (Conchillo-Sole et al., 2007) and FOLD_AMYLOID
(Garbuzynsky et al., 2010) on aragonite protein sequences AP7,
PFMGl and n16-3 that have been experimentally conﬁrmed to be intrin-
sically disordered, contain extended ,8 strand structures and stabilize ara-
gonite in vitro (Amos et al., 2010, 2011; Keene et al., 2010).

3 RESULTS
3.1 Intrinsic disorder and bind/fold regions within
AECMPs

Using IUP, GLOBPLOT and DISOPRED, we found that all
AECMPs contain intrinsically disordered regions, with the
framework and intracrystalline classes containing the highest
and lowest percentages, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S1).
In some cases, it has been documented that some unstable dis-
ordered domains will fold when they bind to targets or are inﬂu-
enced by environmental factors (Amos et al., 2010, 2011; Tompa,
2002; Uversky and Dunker, 2010; Ward et al., 2004; Xie et al.,
2007). These unique ‘bind/fold’ domains can be identiﬁed using
the ANCHOR propensity scoring (Fig. 1) (Mészaros et al.,
2009). This scoring method identiﬁed a subset of 20 proteins

(51%) whose probabilities were >0.5 (Fig. 1). With few excep-
tions (i.e. gly 30, mpn88 and mpn), these predicted bind/fold
regions are <20 amino acids in length. We ﬁnd fewer bind/fold
positive proteins within the intracrystalline class (36%) com-
pared with the framework (56%) and pearl-associated (58%)
classes (Fig. 1), and this correlates with their intrinsic disorder
score rankings (Supplementary Fig. S1). Two points should be
noted. First, ANCHOR-positive intracrystalline and pearl pro-
teins possess fewer bind/fold regions compared with framework
proteins. We interpret this to mean that intracrystalline and pearl
proteins may be limited in terms of extrinsic target interactions.
Second, we note that framework proteins contain ﬁve or more
predicted ANCHOR binding regions, with some >20 amino
acids in length (i.e. Pif 80, bmsp120, bmsp100, mpn88 and
mpn). This is consistent with the fact that some framework pro-
teins are known to interact with other AECMPs and with the ,6-
chitin polysaccharide layer (Keene et al., 2010; Samata et al.,
1999; Suzuki et al., 2010). Thus, having more than one or
longer bind/fold regions would be essential for framework pro-
teins to interact with multiple matrix targets.

To gain further insight into the identity of these predicted
ANCHOR domains, we correlated the location of these bind/
fold regions with the occurrence of important biomineral-
relevant sequences (Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). We note
the following trends: (i) in the framework Pif80, mpn88, mpn,
bmsp100 and the pearl-associated PFMG8 sequences, we ob-
serve a correlation between some biomineral-associated Pro,
Gly-containing repeat regions and ANCHOR domain locations,
(ii) PF MG2 contains a Ca (II) calponin—like sequence region that
correlates with the location of a predicted ANCHOR binding
domain, (iii) AP7 possesses an ANCHOR region that overlaps
with a known self-assembly/aragonite stabilization sequence
(Fig. l) (Amos et al., 2010, 2011). Hence, only a limited subset
of seven ANCHOR-positive AECMPs (35%) exhibited a

correlation between biomineral-relevant domain sequences and
the location of a predicted bind/fold region. This suggests that
the majority of the predicted bind/fold regions may be unique
domains designed for matrix targets that have yet to be
identiﬁed.

3.2 Aggregation-prone sequences and their occurrence
within AECMPs

It has been postulated that amyloid-like sequences evolved as
early elements in protein folding and agglomeration processes
(Greenwald and Riek, 2012). It is known that these supersecond-
ary short motifs adopt an extended ,6 strand structure and have
been shown to be important for initiating self-assembly (Bryan
et al., 2009; Conchillo—Sole et al., 2007; Garbuzynsky et al., 2010;
Linding et al., 2004). Given that the mollusks evolved millions of
years ago (Berland et al., 2011), it is possible that these motifs are
present in the existing AECMP proteome. If true, then this
would represent a signiﬁcant discovery that could help explain
nacre ECM assembly and subsequent mineral formation.

To assess this, we used TANGO to globally predict the loca-
tion and number of cross-,6 strand aggregation-prone regions in
each of the 39 protein sequences (Fig. 2). Surprisingly, we note
that 37 sequences (95%) were identiﬁed as possessing one or
more cross-,6 strand regions. The intracrystalline and pearl-
associated sequences are similar in terms of the average
number of cross-,6 strand motifs (2.7 and 2.5 motifs/sequence,
respectively), but once again, the framework protein sequences
distinguish themselves with higher TANGO scoring (4.6 motifs/
sequence, with the highest occurrence noted for bmsp100,
bmspl20, gly30, Pif and mpn88) and TANGO sequence lengths.
Using BETASCAN, AGGRESCAN and FOLD_AMYLOID,
we veriﬁed that the self-assembling AP7 (intracrystalline),
PFMGl (pearl) and n16.3 (framework) sequences each contain
two or more cross-,6 strand amyloid-like supersecondary motifs
(Supplementary Fig. S3). This correlates with the presence of
extended ,6 strand structure in these protein sequences (Amos
et al., 2011, 2010; Keene et al., 2010; Ponce and Evans, 2011).
We conclude that the majority of AECMPs contain one or more
cross-,6 strand supersecondary motifs. Hypothetically, these
motifs would increase the aggregation potential of these se-
quences and drive matrix assembly processes in tandem with
intrinsic disorder (Figs 2 and 3).

4 DISCUSSION

In this study, we conﬁrm that 100% of the 39 studied nacre
proteins contain one or more regions of intrinsic disorder
(Supplementary Fig. S1), and 95 % of these same proteins possess
one or more interactive regions, such as bind/fold or
amyloid-like motifs (Figs 1 and 2). Hence, we conclude that,
like their HECMP counterparts, the AECMPs have evolved sig-
nature molecular traits of intrinsically disordered and aggrega-
tion-prone ‘interactive’ sequences that enable matrix assembly
(Fig. 3). As expected, each nacre protein class possesses distin-
guishing features. Framework and pearl-associated classes pos-
sess the highest percentages of intrinsic disorder, bind/fold
regions and amyloid-like sequences (Figs 1 and 2, Supplementary
Fig. S1). Conversely, the intracrystalline class possesses lower

percentages of intrinsic disorder (Supplementary Fig. S1) and
fewer bind/fold and aggregation-prone sites (Figs 1 and 2).
Thus, proteins with higher percentages of ‘interactive’ regions,
such as the framework or pearl subclasses, may be involved with
multiple targets (e. g. silk-like ﬁbroin proteins, ,B-chitin polysac-
charide and other framework proteins) and thus require longer
length and/or more numerous interactive regions to participate
in intermolecular interactions with diverse targets. Conversely,
the intracrystalline proteins may be designed for a limited
number of protein— matrix interactions within organic inclusions
and hence require fewer ‘interactive’ regions to achieve this. We
believe that the presence and extent of intrinsic disorder and
interactive sites in a given AECMP are related to (i) the func-
tional attributes of a given protein and (ii) the number and
nature of potential matrix targets that a given protein interacts
with.

The most unexpected ﬁnding was the presence of amyloid-like
cross-,6 strand supersecondary motifs (Fig. 2), a class of
aggregation-prone sequences that have been linked with the
evolutionary development of protein folding and assembly.

Aragonite-associated biomineralization proteins

 

Similar to what we observed for intrinsically disordered regions,
the occurrence of TANGO-identiﬁed aggregation-prone regions
(i.e. average number of motifs) follows the relationship fra-
me>pearl ~intra (Fig. 2). We conclude that although
amyloid-like motifs are important for the function of all
AEMCPs, they appear to be critical for the framework-speciﬁc
lamellar layer, possibly playing major roles in protein—polysac-
charide recognition, protein—protein assembly and elastomeric
behavior under force (Smith et al., 1999). In conclusion, we
believe that the sequence location and number of intrinsically
disordered and amyloid-like supersecondary motifs may be im-
portant for aggregation (Fig. 3), protein orientation and assem-
bly stability, and may also play a role in the recognition and
interaction of a given protein with other speciﬁc matrix compo-
nent(s) during the nacre biomineralization process. These se-
quence features will now become the subject of experiments
aimed at conﬁrming their functional roles in nacre assembly.

Abstract

Motivation: Mechanotransduction—the ability to output a biochemical signal from a mechanical
input—is related to the initiation and progression of a broad spectrum of molecular events. Yet, the
characterization of mechanotransduction lacks some of the most basic tools as, for instance, it can
hardly be recognized by enrichment analysis tools, nor could we find any pathway representation.
This greatly limits computational testing and hypothesis generation on mechanotransduction bio—
logical relevance and involvement in disease or physiological mechanisms.

Results: We here present a molecular map of mechanotransduction, built in CellDesigner to war—
rant that maximum information is embedded in a compact network format. To validate the map’s
necessity we tested its redundancy in comparison with existing pathways, and to estimate its suffi—
ciency, we quantified its ability to reproduce biological events with dynamic simulations, using

Signaling Petri Networks.

1 Introduction

Mechanotransduction is a ubiquitous phenomenon, the importance
and complexity of which has not yet been fully captured. Yet, mech—
anical stresses are triggers for wound healing (Cordeiro and Jacinto,
2013) and can initiate epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in
the presence of inﬂammation (Gomez et 61]., 2010). Both these phe—
nomena are tightly related and important in the understanding of
broader events like development (EMT Type 1), tissue regeneration/
healing (EMT Type 2) and tumorigenesis (EMT Type 3) (Kalluri,
2009; Kalluri and Weinberg, 2009). Therefore, the understanding of
these events for applications in regenerative and cancer medicine
(Roussos et 61]., 2010), as well as in the treatment of inﬂammatory

and autoimmune diseases (Gonzalez et 61]., 2011; Lu et 61]., 2006;
Schafer and Werner, 2008), is of crucial importance. In addition,
given the possibility to induce mechanical stimuli in a relatively
ample number of (accidental) ways (Hattori et 61]., 2009; Pecchi
et 61]., 2014), understanding the eXtent of the phenomenon acquires
practical relevance in numerous clinical areas.

We observed, however, that, despite its importance, mechano—
transduction is poorly represented in terms of pathways and molecu—
lar maps, which are nevertheless crucial tools when medical research
is performed in the frame of omic studies as it is the case for a grow—
ing number of maladies, trying to unravel the complexity of chronic
inﬂammatory autoimmune diseases and cancers (Shen et 61]., 2009;

Wu et al., 2010). For this reason, we reconstructed the molecular
map of mechanotransduction using approved standard (Hucka
et al., 2003, 2004) which allows a detailed and yet compact descrip—
tion of the relations ongoing among molecules, easy sharing and
editing of the map as well as topological analysis (Bonnet et al.,
2013; Smoot et al., 2011) and dynamic simulations (Dent et al.,
2013; Theocharidis et al., 2009).

Having built this map we were able to better quantify its overlap
(Dent et al., 2013; Di Lena et al., 2013) with known pathways in
Reactome (Croft et al., 2011) and Panther (Mi et al., 2005). The
non—statistically significant overlaps with the pathways in these two
databases imply minimum redundancy, confirming the need for a
mechanotransduction pathway representation. We then validated
the map’s ability to reproduce known information by dynamic simu-
lations mimicking published experimental settings (Gomez et al.,
2010; Langevin et al., 2006). Given the successful tests run on the
map’s ability to mimic the effects of mechanical stress in relation to
inﬂammation, relevant for example in rheumatic diseases, this net—
work becomes an appropriate and flexible tool for the preliminary
investigation in silico of therapeutic alternatives and side effects of
mechanical stresses in inﬂammation—related contexts.

2 Results
2.1 Map necessity

A mechanotransduction map was built with the species (genes, tran—
scripts, proteins, listed in SupplementaryInfo1 Table S1) collected
from 15 high-quality publications reported in SupplementaryInfo1
Table S2 (Chalfie, 2009; Chiquet et al., 2009; Dupont et al., 2011;
Farge, 2003; Gomez et al., 2010; Hoffman et al., 2011; Ingber,
2006; Langevin et al., 2006; Marshall and Lumpkin, 2012; Mendez
and Janmey, 2012; Schwarz and Gardel, 2012; Somogyi and Rorth,
2004; Wall and Banes, 2005; Zebda et al., 2012; Zhang and
Labouesse, 2012) manually curated and reported in the
CellDesigner standard (Hucka et al., 2004). The map comes in two
versions both available at http://www.picb.ac.cn/
ClinicalGenomicNTW/Mechanotransduction.html, one named
core, built exclusively from literature, collecting 67 species and 47
reactions (Fig. 1A) and one named basic, which includes extensions
from KEGG pathways (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000) increasing the
size to 234 species and 245 reactions.

The maps were initially tested with MIMO (Di Lena et al.,
2013) to assess the maps’ necessity in terms of redundancy with pub—
licly available CellDesigner pathways, and namely Reactome (Croft
et al., 2011) and Panther (Croft et al., 2011). This type of test builds
on classical enrichment analyses which are typically assessed by tak—
ing into account the amount of common molecules in two pathways.
MIMO, however, adds to this the analysis at the reaction level, to
keep into account the way in which molecules interact. Our results
indicate that the overlap is limited, i.e. non—statistically significant,
nor biologically relevant.

In fact, at the molecular level, the overlap (Fig. 1B, Table 1 and
SupplementaryInfo1 Tables S3—S5, column 2) concerns a very lim-
ited and scattered number of extra to intraintracellular signal ef-
fectors such as extracellular Ca2+ intake and activation at the cell
membrane level of phospholipases C, beta (PLCB 1—4), an important
player in the initiation of mechano—mediated and receptor—mediated
signal transduction by generation of second messengers like inositol
1,4,5—trisphosphate (IP3). The transduction of the mechanical
stimulus is next embodied directly in the cytosol in the RHOs
family (RAC1, CDC42) and the actin protein filaments (F—actin).

Fig. 1. (A) Snapshot of the reconstructed Celldesigner mechanotransduction
map, including 67 species and 47 reactions (the SMBL file is available at
http://www.picb.ac.cn/ClinicalGenomicNTW/Mechanotransduction.html). (B)
Overlap between the mechanotransduction map and the whole human set of
Reactome pathways (Croft et al., 2011), processed by MIMO (Di Lena et al.,
2013). The names of the mapped molecules are separated by a double under-
score (__), where the first portion refers to the mechanotransduction map and
the second to the whole human Reactome map. The emerging overlaps are
extremely fragmented and concern extracellular Ca2+ intake, activation of
phospholipases C, beta 1-4 (PLCB 1-4) signaling and generation of cytosolic
inositol 3P as consequence. Mechanotransduction typical signals like RHOs
family (e.g. RAC1, CDC42) activities and cytoskeletal structural protein actin
filaments (F-actin) are interested at the cytosol level, whereas cell-to-cell ad-
hesion molecules (cadherins) emerge in the nucleus

Finally, EMT-related molecules appear in the nucleus, marked by
the epithelial adhesive cadherins. Even when extending the map (i.e.
basic map) the number of overlapping molecules only slightly in-
creases (SupplementaryInfol Tables S4—S5, column 2).

When shifting from the overlapping molecules to the overlapping
pathways, Immune System, Inflammation and several downstream—
specific signal transductions represent a higher amount of matching,
but still involving only a few molecules and reactions from the core/
basic maps (see Table 1 and SupplementaryInfo1 Tables S3—S5, col—
umn 3). This overlap, not significant, nevertheless indicates where
the connection of the effects of mechanical stimulation to inflamma-
tory conditions occurs, i.e. at one subunit of the master kinase for

MIMO-detected hits were ﬁltered by removing those involving less than
three molecules or less than three reactions. Overlap between two pathways is
quantiﬁed by counting the respective fraction of matched reactions. A weight
is assigned to every matched reaction depending on the number of matched
molecules that take part to the reaction. The Overlap score [0,1] gives an
estimation of how much the query pathway (mechanotransduction core) is
contained into the target pathway (Reactome pathways). The largest overlaps,
Mechanotransduction core versus Immune System pathway, involve only 6
out of 65 species and 3 out of 47 reactions.

NF-KB activation (nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene en—
hancer in B-cells 1), namely conserved helix—loop—helix ubiquitous
kinase, and the NF-KB inducible factor protein tyrosine kinase 2, see
basic map with Reactome overlap (SupplementaryInfo1 Table S4,
column 3).

Globally, both molecules and pathways comparison analyses
outline a lack of information about mechanotransduction as a
defined signaling network in the two public databases.

2.2 Map sufficiency

The map was then tested for its sufficiency, i.e. usability in (re)pro-
ducing biological phenomena triggered by mechanical stimulations,
with the aim of validating the map’s usage in relation to open prob—
lems where the impact of mechanical stresses is of relevance, as it is
the case in arthritic diseases (Croft et al., 2011; Hattori et al., 2009).
We therefore compared the effects of a mechanical stimulation on
the molecules involved in our network, over time and under

different inflammatory conditions. The experimental gold standard
to validate the results was chosen from two articles (Gomez et al.,
2010; Langevin et al., 2006) that explore diverse effects in similar,
i.e. comparable, settings (mouse tissue). Jointly, the experimental set
ups indicate, as effects of the mechanical stimulation in healthy tis-
sue, the activation of RhoA/Rac1 (ras homolog family member N
rho family, small GTP binding protein Rac1) and actomyosin, and
the presence of EMT, accompanied by the (early) activation of
myocardin—related transcription factors (MRTF—A/MKLl/MAL and
MRTF-B/MKL2) unaffected by the inhibition of Rac1, in inflamed
tissue.

For validation of the ability of our map to reproduce these set—
tings, we used the Petri Network framework [Biolayout Express3D
(Theocharidis et al., 2009) and SPNconverter (Dent et al., 2013)]. In
silico experiments were run assuming that 100 time blocks could
cover the whole simulation time, 100 tokens could represent physio—
logical baseline genes regulation and 500 tokens could mimic
upregulation, as previously reported (Dent and Nardini, 2013).
Tokens’ distribution as well as relevant statistics is available in
SupplementaryInfo1 Tables S6—S7, evaluation of the stability of the
simulations in SupplementaryInfo1 Tables 88—810 and in Section 3.
Results are presented in Figure 2 where the ‘Summary’ column indi-
cates the coherence between the outcomes of the major biological
events tested by our simulations in comparison to the published
experiments.

More in details, the simulation referred specifically to the
mechanotransduction markers (Fig. 2, rows 1—9) recapitulates the
dynamics of mechanosensitive genes via pathways linked to mechan—
ically induced cytoskeletal remodeling (Chiquet et al., 2009).
Namely, tissue cells subjected to tensions from the extracellular en-
vironment sense and exert forces via their cytoskeleton, which
undergo reorganization in a different shape and functionality, lead—
ing to migration and cell spreading as exemplar of these temporary
cell structure modifications (Ponti et al., 2004; Theriot and
Mitchison, 1991). In all cases the early steps of the process require
the transient activity of MAL, one of SRF transcriptional cofactors,
which is specifically induced by a mechanical stimulus (i.e. cell
stretching) and, once activated, affects cytoskeletal actin dynamics
(Posern and Treisman, 2006; Somogyi and Rorth, 2004). As indi-
cated in the reference experiment by Langevin et al. (2006 ) the tem—
poral sequence of events following the subconnective tissue physical
stimulation resulting in active changes of fibroblasts cytoskeleton
starts with the initial pulling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) on
cells at precise focal adhesions complexes followed by actin re—
arrangement (like MAL expression induces); after focal contacts ap—
pear on cell surface stimulated by the tensile forces (Rac1 driven),
RhoA activate actomyosin contraction around lamellipodia,
through the stimulation of the down—stream effector Rho kinase
(Rho—associated, coiled—coil containing protein kinase 1, ROCK
family).

All these events are reproduced in our map, and remark-
ably, with the correct subtle timing they present in viz/o: i.e. stable
late activation of the Rho kinase and early transient activation of
MAL.

In particular, since the whole RHOs family (RHOA; RAC1;
CDC42, cell division cycle 42) action is related to mechanotransduc—
tion via its activity on actomyosin (Machacek et al., 2009; Parsons
et al., 2010), and given that the inhibition of one only of the family
members does not impede downstream events to occur (see Gomez
et al., 2010 for EMT occurring even with inhibition of Rac1), we
mark as coherent complexes/families where one or more constituent
molecules do have the expected up or downregulation, and others

Fig. 2. Molecules in column 1 belong to the reconstructed mechanotransduction map (core), compared with the activity observed in two experimental setting
published, respectively, (Langevin et al., 2006b) and (Gomez et al., 2010). When the exact molecule is not shared between our map and the published results,
proxies are chosen from literature. Prefix r, standing for RNA, indicates transcripts, while the absence of a prefix indicates proteins. The input of the simulation is
the variation of the force. ‘NA' indicates that the molecule was not tested in the corresponding experiment,  that the molecule shows no significant change
upon force activation, ‘1’ and ‘1’ indicate statistically significant up and downregulation, respectively, accompanied by the t—values. In simulation the qualitative
trend of activation of the gene is also presented with time blocks on the x-axis and tokens on the y-axis (for larger figures and details see Supplementary Fig. S1).
MAL, a known early gene, bound to SRC (MAL:SRC) clearly presents the early gene pattern of activity (tokens count, y-axis) over 100 time blocks (X-axis) in simu-
lation. Columns 5—8—9 indicate by means of ticks and crosses the agreement between the experiments and the corresponding simulation

appear unchanged. With the same rationale we considered the acto—
myosin complex.

2.3 Simulation relevant in autoimmunity
We then moved to test the altered condition, relevant to autoim—
mune diseases and injured tissues, represented by an inflamed

microenvironment. In such situations both physical stresses and bio—
chemical signals’ complexities are increased, and mechanical stresses
trigger wound healing where EMT occurs in cells needing to be com—
petent (i.e. motile phenotype, cell proliferation, ECM deposition) to
remodel tissue around the wound (Cordeiro and Jacinto, 2013;
Gomez et al., 2010). To perform this simulation we observed the be—
havior of markers of EMT (Fig. 2, rows 10—12): TWIST1 (twist

family bHLH transcription factor 1) and CDH1, also known as E—
cadherin (Lee and Nelson, 2012), which expression is considered a
clear indicator of the switch to EMT program (Kroepil et al., 2012)
in a computational model of tissue inflammation (100 tokens at
time 0 on TGFB).

In our results, the activation of the immediate early MAL and
late RHOA/RACl—actomyosin mechanotransduction signaling—
matches with the activity of CDH1 and TWIST1 during the EM
transition (i.e. up and down, respectively).

As a final test, inﬂammation was also monitored with the sole
molecule (IL1I3; interleukin 1, beta) that behaves differentially in the
two simulations settings (inﬂamed versus non—inflamed tissue, i.e.
transforming growth factor, beta, TGFB : 100 and TGFB : 500, re—
spectively, Fig. 2, row 13). IL1[3 is an inﬂammatory cytokine that
can stimulate the release of prostaglandin and collagenase from con—
nective cells (i.e. synovial fibroblasts—Van Damme et al., 1985), co—
herently up—regulated in the second setting only.In conclusion the
map can describe the TGFB—mediated EMT, and its early regulation
by MAL nuclear transition and environmental mechanical forces, as
previously validated in an inflammatory experimental model by
Gomez et al. (2010). Investigating the aspects of EMT for tissue
healing in inflammation is relevant in health and disease, since this
process drives tissue remodeling to protect and repair injuries; yet if
the transition becomes uncontrolled, like in chronic inﬂamed tissues,
a scarring tissue overgrowth (fibrosis) happens, resulting in organ
dysfunction and eventually failure (Wynn, 2008). For this reason the
information on crucial signals of mechanotransduction (RHOs
Family; actomyosin and catenin beta 1, CTNN1) together with
EMT (CDH1, TWIST1) and inflammation (NF-KB, TGFB and
transforming growth factor beta receptor) that our map is able to
gain are of great relevance for the application of mechanical stimuli
as means to control EMT, the reverse phenomenon MET and to
gain insight for example into treatments of tissue fibrosis, all with
clinical implications in inﬂammatory chronic diseases, such as
Arthritis and Diabetes, as well as wound healing and fibrosis (Wong
et al., 2012).

Overall, Figure 2 shows high coherence with the simulation re—
sults matching experimental results for four of the five tested mol—
ecules (the exception being the failure of the simulation to match
experimental results for RAC1 when considered alone and not as
the synergistic RHOs family) and overall coherence summarized at
100%.

3 Methods

3.1 Map construction

The map was designed based on the species listed in
SupplementaryInfo1 Table S1 collected from 15 high-quality publi-
cations reported in SupplementaryInfo1 Table S2 and manually
curated in CellDesigner (http://www.picb.ac.cn/ClinicalGenomic
NTW/Mechanotransduction.html). Complexes were either treated
as units, like ion channels and hemichannels, similarly to what is
done in Reactome (REACT_160271.1, TPCN1/2 transport lyso—
somal Ca2+ to cytosol); or explicated in a literature—based selection
of their components, like the actomyosin complex, based on the
functionality of the complex itself. All implementative choices are
detailed in SupplementaryInfo1, column NOTES.

For the map construction, genes (nodes) were all converted to
human official gene symbols and for comparison with published ex—
periments further converted to mouse homologues (http://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/unigene/). In the text we used the human genes

symbols for molecules when we referred to our results, and mouse
genes symbols when we referred to published data. The maps come
in two versions based on the origin of the nodes: the core map, con—
tains nodes extracted exclusively from literature; the basic map in—
cludes nodes from KEGG pathways (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000).
Such an extension was operated by using each of the core molecules
as a query term in KEGG, and by adding the corresponding pathway
into the basic map. For both maps the connections between nodes,
when not explicated in literature, were based on the KEGG
Orthology (KO) groups, in order to generalize evidence obtained in
specific organisms to other organisms.

3.2 Map overlap

The pathway comparison analysis was performed with MIMO (Di
Lena et al., 2013) against the set of human pathways annotated in the
Reactome (Croft et al., 2011) and Panther (Mi et al., 2005) reposito—
ries. The popular KEGG pathways (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000) were
excluded from this analysis, since currently we did not find tools able
to automatically convert in full KEGG pathways in SBML format
(with the exception of the metabolic pathways). MIMO requires in in—
put two pathways in SBML format (Hucka et al., 2003, 2004), a list
of allowed mappings between molecules in the two pathways and a
maximum length-parameter N. In short, each pathway in input is
spliced into a set of shortest paths, of maximum length N, between
molecules. A shortest path simply identifies the shortest chain of reac—
tions connecting two molecules. Two chains of reactions (one in each
pathway) are considered equivalent if both molecules at their extremes
can be matched, according to the list provided in input. The overlap is
then obtained by detecting the largest set of equivalent chains in the
two pathways. The analysis was performed with N = 3. The list of
mappings between molecules was obtained automatically by pattern
matching between the names assigned to molecules in the
Mechanotransduction and Reactome/Panther pathways. Since the
name identifiers adopted in Reactome are usually human—readable
and non—standard, the string identifiers in Reactome were extended by
including all their possible synonyms (such as standard gene/protein
names). The list of names/synonyms for the participating molecules in
a Reactome pathway can be obtained automatically from the
Reactome website (http://www.reactome.org).

The core and basic mechanotrasduction maps were compared
with the whole human map in Reactome to detect the largest pos—
sible set of common reactions. In addition, to allow an automated
analysis of the biological meaning of such overlaps, enrichments on
the entire collection of Reactome pathways (which constitute the
whole map) was carried out at the reaction level (single reactions are
identified by a unique internal ID, i.e. the same reaction in different
pathways is identified by its unique ID) by performing a standard
Fisher’s exact test on the set of reactions highlighted in the overlap
with the whole human Reactome map. The same approach could
not be replicated on the Panther dataset, since Panther provides only
a collection of single pathways and not a full map on human.

3.3 Simulations

The maps’ input was identified in the Force (node: force@extracellu—
lar) and molecular modifications were simulated dynamically in the
Signaling Petri Network frame after transforming the CellDesigner
map into a compatible BiolayoutExpress3D input (Theocharidis
et al., 2009), using the SPNConverter plugin we recently designed
(Dent et al., 2013). Based on previous approaches (Dent and
Nardini, 2013), we created a set of baseline conditions, where all
edge nodes were assigned 100 tokens at time 0. As the simulation

model runs, and at each time point, tokens are passed through gates
between molecules. As the number of tokens at a molecule rises and
falls with time, we see a representation of, in the case of the mecha—
notransduction map, gene regulation and mechanical stress [e.g. an
increase in the number of tokens representing upregulation and a de—
crease, downregulation (Ruths et al., 2008)]. Over the course of the
simulation, most networks will reach a stable state, where the num—
ber of tokens at nodes within the network no longer ﬂuctuates sig—
nificantly. By changing the number of tokens that a molecule is
assigned at time 0, we can consider the potential effect that perturb—
ing specific molecules may have on the map. Thus, simulation repro—
ducing the setting in Gomez et al. (2010) was achieved by preserving
the baseline conditions of 100 tokens at time 0 at all edge nodes,
with the exception of TGFB, which was assigned 500 tokens (for
simulated upregulation). The number of tokens assigned to force
was then increased from 100 to 500 (SupplementaryInfol Table S6).
Simulations reproducing the setting of Langevin et al. (2006) were
performed with the baseline conditions preserved, and changing
only the number of tokens assigned to ‘force’ (SupplementaryInfol
Table S7). One hundred time points and 1000 simulations were run
for each setting. Evaluation of the statistical significance of the dif-
ferentially expressed genes was computed by considering the num—
ber of molecules that were significantly different at the 100th time
point, compared with the baseline conditions.

To determine the statistical significance of the differentially ex-
pressed genes in the simulations the t—value was calculated at each
time point for the baseline and perturbed distributions according to
the equation:

t—value : ,

“Lb — “it
2

Ln Q
O...
0%
23.1
0%

where 11,75 and 021'75 represent the mean and variance of the number
of tokens at node i, for the baseline (b) and perturbed (p) networks,
respectively. Comparing the absolute t—value with the corresponding
critical value (t0.05, 1000 = 1.96) at the 100th (and thus most sta—
ble) time point, those molecules whose expression level significantly
changed in each simulation were identified.

Experiments to evaluate the stability of the simulation were per—
formed by repeating simulations around force stimulation three
times on both the core and basic maps (SupplementaryInfol Tables
S8—S9). Results of Wilcoxon rank sum tests showed no statistical
difference between simulations runs. Overlap between molecules
significantly changed (P < 0.05) in different simulation runs lead to
different levels of reproducibility (percent overlap) for the core
(~90%) and basic maps (~60%) with no changes when raising the
number of simulations to 5000 (SupplementaryInfol Table S10).
For this reason, dynamic simulations were run on the core map
only, assuming it reaches the limit size for simulations with
BiolayoutExpress3D (Theocharidis et al., 2009). The first set of
simulation results was preserved as our reference. All statistical ana—
lyses were performed in R v2.13.0 (Ihaka and Gentleman, 1996).

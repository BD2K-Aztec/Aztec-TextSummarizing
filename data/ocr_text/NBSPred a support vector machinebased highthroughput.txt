Abstract

Summary: The nucleotide binding site Ieucine—rich repeats (NBSLRRS) belong to one of the largest
known families of disease resistance genes that encode resistance proteins (R—protein) against the
pathogens of plants. Various defence mechanisms have explained the regulation of plant immun—
ity, but still, we have limited understanding about plant defence against different pathogens.
Identification of R—proteins and proteins having R—protein—Iike features across the genome, tran—
scriptome and proteome would be highly useful to develop the global understanding of plant de—
fence mechanisms, but it is laborious and time—consuming task. Therefore, we have developed a
support vector machine—based high—throughput pipeline called NBSPred to differentiate NBSLRR
and NBSLRR—like protein from Non—NBSLRR proteins from genome, transcriptome and protein se—
quences. The pipeline was tested and validated with input sequences from three dicot and two
monocot plants including Arabidopsis thaliana, Boechera stricta, Brachypodium distachyon
Solanum lycopersicum and Zea mays.

1 Introduction

R-proteins are well known as plant defence proteins against patho—
gens that contain different domains like nucleotide binding domain
(NB-ARC), leucine-rich repeat (LRR), Toll-interleukin-like recep-
tor (TIR), Coiled—Coiled (CC) and kinase (KIN). Five different
kinds of R—protein domain association categories (Sanseverino and
Ercolano, 2012) were found as majority including TIR-NBS-LRR
(TNL), CC—NBS—LRR (CNL), Receptor—like kinase, Receptor—like
proteins and last category Others. A number of hypotheses have
been proposed for explaining the regulation of plant immunity
against pathogens such as the guard hypothesis, the receptor—

ligand hypothesis (Marone et 61]., 2013; Soosaar et 61]., 2005) and
the structure—based functional hypothesis (Takken and Goverse,
2012). But several questions are still unanswered: How many
R—genes need to be expressed to acquire resistance against micro—
organisms acting as pathogens in plants? How many other proteins
are involved directly or indirectly in the resistance process (Takken
and Goverse, 2012)? How is the dynamic intracellular localization
achieved, as the majority of nucleotide binding site leucine-rich re-
peat (NBSLRR) proteins lack signal peptides (Rafiqi et 61]., 2009)?
A limited number of known R—proteins could be one possible

reason for reduced understanding of multi—layered innate immune
system of plant defence. Exploration of R—proteins and proteins
having R-protein—like features could provide useful links to de—
velop the global understanding of plant defence against different
pathogens.

Currently, sequence and motif similarity, domain matching
and domain association—based methods are in use, each demand—
ing a lot of data processing and time for genome—wide identifica—
tion of R—proteins (Sanseverino and Ercolano, 2012; Shang et al.,
2009; Tan and Wu, 2012). Disease Resistance Analysis and Gene
Orthology (DRAGO) pipeline of the PRC database is also based
on BLAST search and domain analysis (Sanseverino et al., 2013),
whereas the NLR—parser is based on MAST motif search
(Steuernagel et al., 2015). Prediction of R—proteins on the basis
of sequence and domain similarity with a small set of reference
R-genes is challenging due to the high level of diversity, as
R—genes are under high selection pressure to adapt their immun—
ity to the rapidly evolving effector genes in the pathogens
(Marone et al., 2013). Experimental screening of R-genes in
plants would be difficult to perform at large scale. But presently,
a large number of plant genomes and transcriptomes have been
sequenced and assembled. Despite data availability, identifica—
tion of NBSLRR sequences in sequenced plants is still limited at
large scale with present available tools. Nowadays, machine—
learning techniques are used much more efficiently for answering
biological questions. As a solution, the NBSPred an automated
pipeline have been proposed by using support vector machine
(SVM) technique. NBSPred is facilitating the high-throughput
identification of NBSLRR sequences from genome, transcripts
and protein sequences as input.

2 Methods

R-protein and non—R—protein sequences were retrieved from the
GenBank database. Redundancy removal was performed through
clustering. A domain—based approach was used for the final selection
of sequences in both datasets. The sequences having both NB—ARC
and LRR domain together along with other additional domains like
Pkinase, TIR, CC and so forth were selected in the positive dataset,
whereas the sequences that had domains of positive dataset were
removed from negative dataset. Six types of sequence compositional
frequencies (amino acid frequency, dipeptide frequency, tripeptide fre—
quency, multiplet frequency, charge and hydrophobicity composition)
were calculated for each sequence, and a numerical feature vector was
created for each sequence of positive and negative datasets
(Chaudhuri et al., 2011; Ramana and Gupta, 2010). SVM_learn and
SVM_classify modules from the SVMlight package (Joachims, 1999)
were used to generate an SVM classifier for NBSLRR protein predic-
tion. Best classifiers were identified through 5—fold cross validation
technique (Supplementary Sections S1 and S2). Augustus 2.7 was
used in the pipeline for the annotation of plant genome (Stanke and
Morgenstern, 2005). TransDecoder (Grabherr et al., 2011) was used
for the protein Open Reading Frame generation from transcripts. The
Pfam database was used for the domain identification in predicted
NBSLRR proteins. The ﬂowchart of the pipeline is given in Figure 1.

3 Implementation

The NBSPred pipeline was hosted on a Dell PowerEdge T320 Server
E5—2430 with 12 core processors of 2.2GHz, running on CentOS
7.0 64 bits. The pipeline is freely accessible as a web interface which

4 Results and discussion

A total of 974 sequences were involved in the training, which have
NB-ARC and LRR domain together (Supplementary Table S1).
Composition—based amino—acid frequencies were used for predic—
tion after the analysis of training sequences (Supplementary
Section 81.4). Five—hundred eighty—eight models were generated
through variable input of different kernel function and kernel—asso—
ciated parameters. For the polynomial kernel, values of d and C
were increased stepwise through a combination of 1, 2, 3,
4...to...9 for the d and 10—5, 10—6...to...1015 for C. For the
Radial basis function kernel, the gamma (g) was incremented step—
wise 10_15 . . .to . . . 103 and parameter C from 10—5 . . . to . . . 1015.
The mean Matthews correlation coefficient and prediction accur—
acy of the best performed model, kernel type and kernel—associated
values are given in Supplementary Table S2. NBSPred achieved
~99% and 83% prediction accuracy for training and independent
dataset, respectively (Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). NBSPred
has shown high exploration potential than NLR-parser in compari-
son of different datasets (Supplementary Tables S4—S9).
NLRParser has detected 91.12% sequences as R—protein from in-
dependent dataset but only 49.72% sequences have class assign—
ment. Prediction of R—protein classes (CNL and TNL) through
NLRParser are varies like many sequences are predicted as CNL/
TNL but all the domains does not appear in Pfam search.

Moreover, NLR—parser is not compatible for prediction from gen-
omic assemblies. All the processed files for prediction and com—
parison are available at help section of NBSPred website.

4.1 High—throughput prediction and validation

As proof, we demonstrated the efficiency of the NBSPred prediction
and explorative capability through screening of five plants (three
dicots and two monocots) for Phytozome data repository
(Goodstein et al., 2012). Number of detected sequences through
NBSPred for transcriptome and proteome are given, respectively, for
Boec/oera stricta (722, 699), Arabidopsist/oaliana (604, 595),
Solanum lycopersicum (564, 577), Zea Mays (477, 428) and
Brachypodium distachyon (752, 738). Three plant genomes
(A.tloaliana, Solanum lycopersicum and Zea mays) were scanned for
R-protein domains from genomic assemblies through Augustus
trained gene prediction models (Supplementary Tables S7—S9).
NBSpred have long—term objective to provide good gene prediction
models for crop plants. NBSPred—predicted sequences with high
score, with or without NB—ARC and LRR domain are strong R-gene
candidates which possess high level of sequence composition simi-
larity like R—genes, but these sequences are required careful annota—
tion and experimental validation.

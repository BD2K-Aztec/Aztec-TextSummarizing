Abstract

Summary: Riboswitches are non-coding RNA located in the 5’ untranslated regions where they bind
a target metabolite used to specify the riboswitch class and control the expression of associated
genes. Accurate identification of riboswitches is the first step towards understanding their regulatory
and functional roles in the cell. In this article, we describe a new web application named Riboswitch
Scanner which provides an automated pipeline for pHMM-based detection of riboswitches in partial
as well as complete genomic sequences rapidly, with high sensitivity and specificity.

1 Introduction

Riboswitches are cis-regulatory genomic segments that control the
expression of downstream genes by undergoing conformational
changes on ligand binding (Mandal and Breaker, 2004). They
are mainly found in bacteria but have also been detected in a few
eukaryotes (Cheah et al., 2007). Riboswitches are categorized into
different classes according to the type of ligand and secondary struc-
ture. High sequence level conservation and structural similarity are
found in the aptamer domain of the riboswitches belonging to the
same class (Nahvi et al., 2002). Riboswitches control the expression
of genes that are involved in biosynthesis and transport of the lig-
ands as well as transcription factors (Singh and Sengupta, 2012). In
view of their important regulatory role in bacteria and a few eukary-
otes, it is essential to develop tools for accurate identification of dif-
ferent classes of riboswitches. Several approaches have been
developed for computational identifications of riboswitches. An in-
ﬂuential and one of the earliest programs adapted for riboswitch
search is Infernal (Nawrocki et al., 2009) based on the covariance
model (CM). Rfam databases (Nawrocki, et al., 2015) are depend-
ent on CMs for annotation of ncRNAs. But, construction of CMs is

computationally expensive and accuracy of CM is sensitive to the
quality of input multiple sequence alignment (Sun and Rodionov,
2014) and no user-friendly riboswitch-specific web-servers are avail-
able for this method. RibEx (Abreu-Goodger and Merino, 2005) is a
web-based tool capable of detecting riboswitches based on sequence
motifs that are unique to a specific class. It is less sensitive for ribos-
witch classes that are characterized by short length and simple se-
quence motifs. The RiboSW web-server (Chang et al., 2009) is able
to identify 12 classes of riboswitches based on the structural con-
formations and sequence conservation within the functional region.
But, TPP and Cobalamin riboswitches are difficult to detect with
their method. Limitation of all these web-tools is that they impose
upper bounds on the length of the input sequences and none of these
tools are capable of detecting riboswitch from whole genome se-
quences. The Denison Riboswitch Detector (DRD) webserver
(Havill et al., 2014) was developed to predict 13 classes of ribos-
witches from DNA sequences based on a dynamic programming al-
gorithm. The DRD algorithm considers mismatches which are likely
to yield more false positives (Retwitzer et al., 2015a). Recently, a
riboswitch identification method was proposed (Retwitzer et al.,

2015b) that combines the accuracy of structure-based predictions
with the speed of sequence-based methods by exploiting an inverse
RNA folding problem solver.

In this application note, we describe a new web-based tool for
accurate detection of riboswitches using a method (Singh et al.,
2009) based on profile Hidden Markov Models (pHMM). These are
appropriate for modeling sequence profiles and searching databases
for remotely homologous sequences (Eddy, 1998). By exploiting the
high level of sequence conservations of the aptamer domain in every
class of riboswitches, we had previously demonstrated that pHMM
methods are able to identify potential riboswitches in whole genome
sequences accurately and much faster than Infernal CMs search. The
latest Infernal 1.1 package (Nawrocki and Eddy, 2013) currently
available which uses accelerated pHMM and HMM-banded CM
alignment methods and has reduced CM search times compared
with older Infernal versions with little cost to detection sensitivity.
However, if for searching sequences with CMs, the e-value calibra-
tion step is needed, the computing time of CM models increases sub-
stantially. Construction of riboswitch models to search of sequence
databases require less computing time with pHMMs. With this mo-
tivation we developed a pHMM-based web-application named
Riboswitch Scanner for predicting putative riboswitches along with
their locations in genomic sequences for 24 classes of riboswitches.
Moreover, users can also search new riboswitch classes. Riboswitch
Scanner detects the putative riboswitches with higher accuracy than
other available web-based tools for riboswitch discovery. Therefore,
the Riboswitch Scanner provides more efficient alternative ribos-
witch detection tool that assist in the development of automated
genome annotations.

2 Methods

HMM profiles of each class of riboswitches were constructed using
the HMMER3 (Eddy, 2011). An HMM model was built with the
hmmbuild program of HMMER3 packages for each class. The per-
formances of the entire model constructed in this study were eval-
uated using 5-fold cross validation analysis. Sensitivity 2 (TP/
(TP+FN)) and Specificity=(TN/(TN+FP)) are used to measure
the performances of the models. TP and EN refer to true positive
and false negative while TN and FF refer to true negative and false
positive, respectively. RNAfold program of ViennaRNA package
(Lorenz et al., 2011) was used to generate the secondary structures
of the detected riboswitches. All the scripts of the method were writ-
ten in PHP v 5.5 and the interface was designed using HTML. The
server runs on 2494 MHz Hexa core QEMU Virtual CPU version
1.4.0 under the CentOS environment. The server takes an average of
30 seconds per 1 million base pairs to generate the results.

3 Results

The webserver allows the user to submit nucleotide sequences in
FASTA format. The input sequence can be a segment of a genome
(such as a 5’ UTR region of a gene) or the complete genome. The user
can input the sequence by pasting it in the textbox or by using the file
upload facility. More than one riboswitch class can be selected at a
time by checking the appropriate boxes besides each class. In order to
search for riboswitches beyond the classes listed, the user can select the
“other” option in the riboswitch family sections and create their own
riboswitch classes by uploading at least four seed sequences in FASTA
format. This generates the pHMM for the new class and searches the
input sequence for instances of this user-defined riboswitch.

The results of riboswitch searches, for each of the selected
riboswitch classes, in the main strand (5’—3’ ) and complementary
strand (3’—5’ ) of the genome are returned in the output page in a user-
friendly format. If the selected family of riboswitch is present in the
genome, the riboswitch locations, E-value and pHMM score is gener-
ated for every detected riboswitch. Riboswitch sequences based on 10-
cations are extracted and given in the output page. Supplementary File
2 shows a sample output page. The secondary structures based on min-
imum free energy of riboswitches predicted by pHMM are provided
using dot-bracket notations. RNAfold generated folded structure for
each of the predicted riboswitches and the consensus secondary struc-
ture image (courtesy of Rfam) of the selected riboswitch family can be
downloaded in a zip file from the link provided in the output page. The
secondary structure images obtained using RNAfold are named in the
format seq_StartPosition-EndPosition_riboswitch so that they can be
easily correlated with the corresponding hits listed in the output page.
Therefore, the user can further verify the pHMM-predicted ribos-
witches by comparing the folding pattern of the predicted riboswitches
with the consensus Rfam image of this riboswitch family.

The performance of the tool for all classes was evaluated through
5-fold cross-validations. In 5-fold cross validations, each class of ribos-
witch seed sequence datasets was randomly divided into five sets. The
training and testing of every class has been carried out five times, each
time using one distinct set for training and remaining four sets for test-
ing. The overall performance of a riboswitch model is the average per-
formance over five sets. In comparison with other available web-based
tools for riboswitch detection, Riboswitch Scanner detects riboswitches
with higher sensitivity. Sensitivity and specificity of Riboswitch Scanner
for all classes of riboswitches and relative comparison of sensitivity of
Riboswitch Scanner with other existing web-based tools are given in the
Supplementary File 1. Sensitivity and specificity are calculated based on
the predictions of Rfam seed sequences.

4 Conclusions

Riboswitch Scanner was developed for predicting riboswitches with
high accuracy that is complimentary to existing methods for ribos-
witch detection. It has several advantages over existing web-based
tools for riboswitch identification: (i) It is able to scan for putative
riboswitches across the largest number (24) of classes of riboswitches
from partial as well as full genome sequences. (ii) It can predict
riboswitches with higher sensitivity than any other available ribos-
witch-specific web-based tool. (iii) It can be easily used to search for
riboswitches belonging to a new class. (iv) It provides free energy
minimization-based folded structures of pHMM-predicted ribos-
witches for further evaluation of riboswitches based on secondary
structure conservation. We believe Riboswitch Scanner will be very
useful for researchers looking for an accurate riboswitch identification
tool.

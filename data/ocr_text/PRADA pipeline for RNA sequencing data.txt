ABSTRACT

Summary: Technological advances in high-throughput sequencing
necessitate improved computational tools for processing and analyz-
ing large-scale datasets in a systematic automated manner. For that
purpose, we have developed PRADA (Pipeline for RNA-Sequencing
Data Analysis), a flexible, modular and highly scalable software plat-
form that provides many different types of information available by
multifaceted analysis starting from raw paired-end RNA-seq data:
gene expression levels, quality metrics, detection of unsupervised
and supervised fusion transcripts, detection of intragenic fusion vari-
ants, homology scores and fusion frame classification. PRADA uses a
dual-mapping strategy that increases sensitivity and refines the ana-
lytical endpoints. PRADA has been used extensively and successfully
in the glioblastoma and renal clear cell projects of The Cancer
Genome Atlas program.

1 INTRODUCTION

Transcriptome sequencing provides insights into the quantity,
structure and composition of RNA molecules in a biological
sample. Analytical tools for analysis of RNA sequencing data
are available (Kim and Salzberg, 2012; McPherson et al., 2011),
but those tools generally focus on single end points, such as
quantitation of expression levels or identiﬁcation of fusion tran-
scripts. As the technology becomes more accessible, there is an
increased need for computational pipelines that can process large
numbers of raw RNA-sequencing datasets quickly, accurately
and comprehensively. For that purpose, we have developed
PRADA (Pipeline for RNA-Sequencing Data Analysis).
PRADA was designed to be modular in the functional sense
that different modules output different types of information on
the transcripts. It implements resource management structures

such as LSF and PBS, allowing quick scale-up for processing
of thousands of RNA-seq samples.

2 METHODS

PRADA was designed for processing paired-end sequencing data in fastq,
Sequence Alignment/Map (SAM) format or the compressed binary ver-
sion of SAM (BAM) (Li et al., 2009). The processing module applies an
alignment strategy in which reads are mapped to a combined genome and
transcriptome reference, allowing reads to align to known transcript se-
quences, including exon junctions and unannotated mRNAs. The map-
ping strategy has previously been described in Berger et al. (2010). The
appropriate reference ﬁles are available for download at http://bioinfor-
matics.mdanderson.org/Software/PRADA/. This strategy retrieves all
best alignments per read from the dual reference ﬁle using BWA
(Li and Durbin, 2009). After initial mapping, the alignments of reads
that map to multiple locations (both transcriptomic and genomic) are
collapsed into single genomic coordinates, including reads that span
exon junctions. Once mapped, reads are ﬁltered out if their best
placements are not mapped to multiple genomic coordinates. Quality
scores are recalibrated using the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK)
framework (McKenna et al., 2010), index ﬁles are generated using
Samtools (Li et al., 2009) and duplicate reads are ﬂagged using Picard
(http://picard.sourceforge.net/).

For expression and quality control metrics, PRADA’s expression
module calls the java executable of RNA-SeQC DeLuca et al., 2012).
RNA-SeQC is a publicly available tool that produces data quality metrics
of three types: mapped read counts, coverage and correlation. The
read count metrics include total number of reads, duplicates, uniquely
mapped reads and reads per kilobase per million mapped (RPKM).
The coverage metrics include GC bias, 3’ / 5’ bias and mean number of
bases per read. Expression correlation is reported when multiple samples
are analyzed.

The fusion module aims to detect chimeric transcripts through
identiﬁcation of discordant read pairs and fusion-spanning
reads. Discordant read pairs are paired read-ends that map uniquely
(i.e. mapping quality equal to 37) to different protein-coding genes with
orientation consistent with formation of a sense—sense chimera.
Mitochondrial genes and clone IDs are ignored. If a read maps to over-
lapping genes, the genes are split up as two different instances. Further
evidence for transcript fusion is sought through evaluation of putative
fusion junction spanning reads. They are detected in PRADA by the
construction of a sequence database that holds all possible exon—exon
junctions that match the 3’ end of one gene fused to the 5’ end of a second
gene. All hypothetical exon junctions are created using the Ensembl tran-
scriptome reference. Then, unmapped reads aligned to the database of
hypothetical exon junctions. Only reads of which the mate pair maps to
either of the two fusion partner genes are considered. Each fusion is

annotated by sample name, 5’ and 3’ gene name, chromosome location
and blastn homology scores (see below).

The supervised fusion screen module General User dEfmed
Supervised Search (GUESS) was developed to facilitate rapid detection
of a single fusion, e.g. FGFR3-TACC3 in GBM (Singh et al., 2012).
GUESS screens BAM ﬁles for the presence of discordant read pairs
and fusion-spanning reads of speciﬁc genes deﬁned by the user. We
have developed two variants of GUESS, one that searches for fusion
transcripts involving two given genes (GUESS-ft) and one that searches
for intragenic fusions (GUESS-if), such as the EGFR VIII variant that
deletes exons 2—7.

To allow ﬁltering of homology artifacts from the results of the fusion
module and GUESS-ft, the similarity of two fusion partner genes is
assessed using BlastN. Metrics provided are bitscore and its
associated E—value, where an E-value of >0.001 is considered to be
non-homologous.

The frame module predicts whether a fusion transcript is in frame
and thereby capable of producing a functional protein, based on the
combinatorics of the transcript(s) in the Ensembl database for the
genes involved.

3 RESULTS

3.1 The Cancer Genome Atlas unsupervised fusion results

We used PRADA to process RNA-seq data from 416 renal clear
cell carcinoma (ccRCC) samples and 164 glioblastoma multi-
forme (GBM) samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA). Among 84 predicted gene fusions in 416 ccRCCs
were 5 SFPQ-TFE3 transcripts, and the overall validation rate
was 85% (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013).
Fusions found in 164 GBMs (n: 229) included recurrent re-
arrangements such as the previously reported FGFR3—TACC3
in 2 samples and EGFR-associated fusions in 11 samples
(Zheng et al., 2013). Data from whole genome sequencing, avail-
able for a subset of the GBM, validated 41 of 49 predicted fu-
sions (84%). A TFG-GPR128 fusion was observed in both renal
and GBM samples.

3.2 Supervised detection of TFG-GPR128

A germ line copy number variant involving T FG and GPRI28
has been described in human population cohorts (J akobsson
et al., 2008). Using the GUESS-ft supervised fusion search
module, we evaluated the presence of TFG-GPR128 fusions in
321 TCGA tumor-adjacent normal tissues from 11 cancer types
(Supplementary Table S1). TFG-GPR128 fusion was detected at
low levels in 3 of the 321 normal samples (Supplementary Table
S1). The matching tumor sample of two of three T FG-GPR128
harboring normals also expressed this fusion construct, corro-
borating its germ line status.

3.3 Correlation of RPKM values with U133A microarray
expression levels

We tested the RPKM functionality of PRADA’s expression
module in the context of subtype classiﬁcation using 164
RNA-seq samples from GBM, comparing its subtype stratiﬁca-
tion with that based on U133A array data. The comparison
showed a high (80.9%) concordance rate in subtype calls for
expression data generated by the two platforms

(Supplementary Table S2), a similar percentage classiﬁed reliably
as previously reported Werhaak et al., 2010).

3.4 Comparison of fusion transcript detection by PRADA,
Defuse and Tophat-fusion

To evaluate PRADA fusion detection accuracy, we obtained
RNA-seq data and whole genome sequencing data of the U87
glioma cell line. PRADA detected 11 fusions, 6 of which related
to DNA structural rearrangements, TopHat—fusion (Kim and
Salzberg, 2012) predicted 42 fusions of which 12 validated in
DNA, while Defuse (McPherson et al., 2011) found 51 fusions
of which 12 related to DNA lesions (Supplementary Text and
Supplementary Table S3).

4 DISCUSSION

The power of PRADA is based on (i) its scalability, (ii) its map-
ping to both transcriptomic and genome, a distinctive feature of
PRADA in comparison with other RNA analysis tools such as
Tophat—fusion and Defuse, which rely on alignments of partial
reads to identify gene fusions, (iii) its modularity and (iv) its
comprehensive repertoire of output information from the incor-
porated modules. It enables the user to compute multiple ana-
lytical metrics using one software package and to do so for large
numbers of samples at once in a fully automated fashion. It has
been tested on thousands of RNA-seq samples from a wide var-
iety of tumor types and normal tissues in TCGA. PRADA is
designed to be run out of the box with little conﬁguration, and is
compatible with PBS and LSF compute clusters. A single
PRADA tarball, including binaries of the packages it relies on,
a comprehensive and detailed manual, and test FASTQ/BAM
ﬁles, are freely available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/prada/

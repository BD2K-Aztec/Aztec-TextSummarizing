ABSTRACT

Motivation: Web interfaces provide access to numerous biological
databases. Many can be accessed to in a programmatic way thanks
to Web Services. Building applications that combine several of them
would benefit from a single framework.

Results: BioServices is a comprehensive Python framework that pro-
vides programmatic access to major bioinformatics Web Services
(e.g. KEGG, UniProt, BioModels, ChEMBLdb). Wrapping additional
Web Services based either on Representational State Transfer or
Simple Object Access Protocol/Web Services Description Language
technologies is eased by the usage of object-oriented programming.
Availability and implementation: BioServices releases and docu-
mentation are available at http://pypi.python.org/pypi/bioservices
under a GPL-v3 license.

1 INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION

Many biological databases are accessible on the www (world
wide web) via server-side applications that span the entire spec-
trum of bioinformatics (e. g. genomics, sequence analysis).
Although manual requests allow quick retrieval of information,
programmatic access via Web Services scales up the number of
requests and permits the composition of complex workﬂows.
One strength of Web Services is that client-side applications do
not need any intimate knowledge of the database provided by the
service itself. Life sciences and bioinformatics have had a fecund
production of Web Services in recent years (Bhagat et al., 2010).

Web services integration within a single framework fosters the
development of applications. An example based on JAVA is MAPI
(Karlsson and Trelles, 2013) that has been a base for developing
biomedical applications. Programmatic access to Web Services
relies mostly on (i) REST (Representational State Transfer) and
(ii) SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol; www.w3.org/TR/

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

soap). REST has an emphasis on readability: each resource corres-
ponds to a unique URL. There is no need for any external depend-
ency, as operations are carried out via standard Hypertext Transfer
Protocol (HTTP) methods (e.g. GET, POST). SOAP uses exten-
sible mark-up language OiML)—based messaging protocol to
encode request and response messages using WSDL Web
Services Description Language; www.w3.org/TR/wsdl) to describe
the service’s capabilities.

To build applications that integrate several Web Services, one
needs to have expertise in (i) HTTP requests, (ii) SOAP protocol,
(iii) REST protocol, (iv) XML parsing to consume the XML
messages and (v) related bioinformatics fields. Besides, inputs
and outputs of the services can be heterogeneous. Consequently,
the composition of workﬂows or design of external applications
based on several Web Services can be challenging.

The Python language has many useful features for researchers
(Bassi 2007): it is an object-oriented language with a precise and
concise syntax and has a versatile set of standard modules. There
is a growing and thriving community of scientiﬁc developers. An
example of a library dedicated to bioinformatics is BioPython
(Cook et al., 2009). It provides input/ output functions, algorithms
and some access to Web Services (e.g. Entrez). However, a dedi-
cated framework to easily integrate bioinformatics Web Services
and to provide extensive access to them is missing.

We have, therefore, developed BioServices to provide pro-
grammatic access to major bioinformatics Web Services within
a single software framework using Python as a glue language. It
should alleviate the needs for technical knowledge to develop
more complex applications around existing resources.

2 APPROACH AND IMPLEMENTATION

To bring together various Web Services within BioServices, we
ﬁrst designed two base classes called RESTService and
WSDLService so as to ease the wrapping of Web Services. As
shown in Figure 1, these two classes are then used by all services
available within BioServices. A SOAP/WSDL Web Service can
be wrapped concisely as follows:

from bioservices import WSDLService

class AWrapper (WSDLService) :

compose or aggregate several Web Services (see Table l for available
services)

def _init_(self):
super (AWrapper, self) ._init_(

"AWrapper" , url="validURL?wsdl ’ ’ )

Similarly, REST services can be exposed concisely (replace
WSDLService by RES TService) as explained in the Developer
Section of the Supplementary Data. An example of SOAP/
WSDL service wrapped within BioServices is BioModels
(Li, 2010). Consider the following example:

1 from bioservices import BioModels

2 s = BioModels ()

3 s .methods # methods exposed by WSDL
4 s . serv. getAllModelsId()

5 s .getAllModelsId()

All methods exposed by the service are listed in the methods
attribute (line 3). They can be called directly via the serv attri-
bute. For example, all model identiﬁers can be retrieved (line 4).
Methods are then wrapped (line 5) to add robustness and
quality.

Web Services currently available in BioServices (see Table 1)
can be used independently but they can also be combined.
Amongst the various examples provided in the Supplementary
Data, a case study demonstrates how to retrieve a protein’s
UniProt identiﬁer, its corresponding FASTA sequence, the
related Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
pathways, the interactions with other proteins (PSICQUIC)
and so forth.

Two issues arise when manipulating several services, especially
for end-users: (i) heterogeneous data structures are returned and
(ii) a plethora of identiﬁers and keywords are required. Both
issues are unfortunately inherent to the diversity of the Web
Services used. Although some data structures are commonly
used (e. g. XML format), there is still a variety of data structures
to deal with. BioServices addresses the ﬁrst issue by providing
extensive documentation and examples. As for the identiﬁers
issue, although BioServices does not provide mapping functions
by itself, it gives access to mapping functions from UniProt,

3 CONCLUSION/ RESULTS

BioServices provides a comprehensive access to bioinformatics
Web Services within a single Python library; the current release
(1.1.1) provides access to 18 Web Services (see Table l). The
methodology used to encapsulate Web Services and their func-
tionalities combined with Python allow pipelines (that combine
several Web Services) to be implemented concisely. Besides, an
extensive online documentation (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/
bioservices) should help users and developers to deal with the
profusion of identiﬁers and data structures inherent to the diver-
sity of Web Services available. Releases are available on PyPi
(http://pypi.python.org/pypi/bioservices), the ofﬁcial Python re-
pository. Developers can obtain the source code from a public
server (https://www.assembla.com/spaces/bioservices/wiki).
Besides, bug reports and new feature requests are encouraged
(https://www.assembla.com/spaces/bioservices/tickets), and con-
tributors are welcome to join the user and developer community
(https://www.assembla.com/spaces/bioservices/wiki). Tests are
included with a large coverage to guarantee robustness regarding
potential modiﬁcations of the Web Services themselves. By cov-
ering a wide range of Web Services, BioServices can be used to
complement external libraries (e. g. BioPython, Galaxy; see
Supplementary Data) and foster the development of new
workﬁows.

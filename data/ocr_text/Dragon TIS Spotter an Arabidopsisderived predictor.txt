ABSTRACT

Summary: In higher eukaryotes, the identification of translation initi-
ation sites (l'lSs) has been focused on finding these signals in cDNA
or mRNA sequences. Using Arabidopsis thaliana (A.t.) information,
we developed a prediction tool for signals within genomic sequences
of plants that correspond to TlSs. Our tool requires only genome
sequence, not expressed sequences. Its sensitivity/specificity is for
A. t. (90.75%/92.2%), for Vitis vinifera (66.8%/94.4%) and for Populus
trichocarpa (81 .6%/94.4%), which suggests that our tool can be used
in annotation of different plant genomes. We provide a list of features
used in our model. Further study of these features may improve our
understanding of mechanisms of the translation initiation.
Availability and implementation: Our tool is implemented as an arti-
ficial neural network. It is available as a web-based tool and, together
with the source code, the list of features, and data used for model
development, is accessible at http://cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/dts.

1 INTRODUCTION

One of the objectives of bioinformatics is to identify important
biological signals in genomic sequences. The translation initi-
ation site (TIS) is one such signal in mRNA that denotes the
start codon at which translation initiates. Accurate recognition
of TIS signals can help in discovery of protein-coding genes and
improve annotation of gene loci (Do and Choi, 2006; Preiss and
Hentze, 2003). In genomic DNA, signals that correspond to TISs
consist of the ATG triplet of nucleotides, except for the rare cases
of ACG or CTG triplets (Hann, 1994; Kozak, 1989). In this
study, we focus solely on the recognition of ATG motifs
within DNA that correspond to genuine TIS signals. We will
refer to the ATG triplets as TIS motifs. Our study addresses
prediction of TIS motifs in plant species. Recognizing DNA
motifs in genomic sequences that correspond to genuine TIS

signals is much more complex than recognizing them in
mRNA or cDNA sequences, which was the main focus so far.
Pertea and Salzberg achieved accuracy of 84% on both
Arabidopsis thaliana (A.t.) and human genomic sequences
(Pertea and Salzberg, 2002). Sparks and Brendel developed
MetWAMer tools, achieving an accuracy of 85% on A.t. open
reading frame sequences (Sparks and Brendel, 2008). In this
study, using A.t. information, we developed a model for predict-
ing TIS motifs within plant genomic DNA sequences, and we
generated a number of features to characterize the genomic sur-
roundings of these motifs. Some of these features have already
been used for related tasks (Li and Leong, 2005; Liu and Wong,
2003), but we introduced a number of new features not previ-
ously used for TIS predictions. Out of all the features initially
considered, we selected 47 as the best set of features for the TIS
motif recognition task. Our feature selection is based on a wrap-
per method that uses a genetic algorithm (GA) and an Artiﬁcial
Neural Network (ANN). There are other studies that deal with
the generation and selection of features for the TIS recognition,
for example (Zeng et al., 2002). To the best of our knowledge,
our TIS predictor is the only publicly available one for plants.
The sensitivity/speciﬁcity of our model for A.t. is 90.75 %/92.2%
and is the highest compared with those reported in the literature.
The accuracy tests on chromosomes of other plant genomes
show sensitivity/speciﬁcity for Vitis vinifera of 66.8%/94.4%,
and Populus trichocarpa of 81.6% / 94.4%. The web-based tool
that implements our algorithm and our datasets are freely access-
ible at http://cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/dts.

2 METHODS
2.1 Datasets

TIS data for A.t. was extracted from A.t. genome and the corresponding
annotations ﬁle obtained from the TAIR database, version 10 (http://
www.arabidopsis.org). We extracted a total of 27 388 genuine TIS sam-
ples for positive dataset that correspond to database entries annotated as
‘protein coding gene’. The same number of false TIS samples was gener-
ated from A1. chromosomes 1 to 5, ensuring that any such sequence is
not present in the TIS-positive set. Positive and negative TIS sequences
are 300 bp in length with the TIS covering positions 150—152 counted in
5’ —3’ direction. The number of negative samples taken from each of the
chromosomes was proportional to the chromosome size. Even though
negative cases are far more prevalent in the genome, we used equal-sized
positive and negative datasets for training because we believe that these

data sets contain sufﬁciently rich distinguishing features to separate genu-
ine TIS motifs from the false ones.

2.2 Feature generation

For TIS prediction, many useful features in sequences surrounding ATG
signals are reported. Prominent amongst these can be found, for example,
in (Li et al., 2004; Liu and Wong, 2003; Liu et al., 2004; Ma et al., 2006;
Saeys et al., 2007; Tzanis and Vlahavas, 2006). Many of the reported
features are local in the sense that they primarily characterize properties
of the sequences immediately surrounding a candidate TIS. We extended
this set of features with some that are affected by nucleotides up to 150 bp
from the ATG motif site. Since selection of the optimal combination of
candidate features is a combinatorial problem, we ﬁrst reduce the size of
the search space by deﬁning a predetermined subset of features used in all
feature-selection iterations. This ﬁxed subset consists of features that we
selected based on the previously reported results for which we believe to
play a signiﬁcant role in TIS recognition. We expanded the considered
features with a number of new ones. The feature selection method
enlarged the ﬁxed feature set. The core step in our feature selection pro-
cess is the application of genetic algorithm (GA) in search of an optimal
features combination. Brieﬂy, the process stipulates that all candidate
features are numbered and assigned a value of 0 (not selected as a
member of a feature set) or 1 (selected). In this way we form a ‘chromo-
some’ in the GA terms. We use a single point crossover together with
mutation where each bit in a chromosome is subjected to 15% chance of
having its value altered. Finally, we deﬁne evaluation function as the
accuracy of model based on a 3-fold cross-validation on the training
data. Description of major features and more details on feature selection,
training and testing, are given in Supplementary Material 1. A full list of
the used features is given in Supplementary Material 2.

2.3 Main classiﬁer

Our prediction model is an ANN-based classiﬁer. ANNs were used before
for TIS prediction (Pedersen and Nielsen, 1997; Rajapakse and Ho, 2005;
Tikole and Sankararamakrishnan, 2008). We used a 31-node single
hidden-layer ANNs and the backpropagation algorithm for weights opti-
mization. After selecting features using GA, we train the ANN. Available
data, 27 388 positive (real TISs) and 27 388 negative (false TISs) samples,
are split into the training and testing sets. From each of these two sets,
65% (18 802) are reserved for model training and the remaining 35%
(9586) for testing. The training data (18 802 positive and 18 802 negative
samples) were further divided into three parts. The ﬁrst one, containing
5000 positive and 5000 negative samples were exclusively used to generate
feature values. The second set containing 10 882 positive and 10 882 nega-
tive samples is used for ANN training. To avoid overﬁtting, the early
stopping with validation method (Prechelt, 1998) is used on the remaining
2920 positive and 2920 negative samples as a validation set.

3 RESULTS

As a representative measure of model performance, we used the
model sensitivity deﬁned as Se=TP/(TP+FN) and speciﬁcity
Sp 2 TN/(TN + F P), where TP, TN, F P and F N are the numbers
of true positive predictions, true negative predictions, false posi-
tive predictions and false negative predictions, respectively. When
evaluated on the test data only, the performance of our TIS pre-
diction model for A.t. resulted in Se 2 90.75% and Sp 2 90.77%.
When we tested our model on the whole A.t. genome excluding
the training data, we obtained Se 2 90.75% and Sp 2 92.2%. The
tests of our TIS prediction in other plant genomes, with the
unmodiﬁed Arabidopsis model, resulted on Vitis vinifera (entire
chromosomes 1 and 2) in Se: 66.8% and Sp=94.4%, and on

Populus trichocarpa (entire chromosome 1) in Se=81.6% and
Sp 2 94.4%. Details are in Supplementary Material 3.

4 CONCLUSION

We developed a web tool for the recognition of TIS motifs in
plant genomic DNA sequences that is based on an ANN classi-
ﬁer. Model features are selected by a GA as a part of the model
optimization process. The model demonstrates not only an im-
proved prediction accuracy over the reported TIS predictors
for A.t., but also performs well on two other plant species for
which it was not speciﬁcally trained. We hope that our tool will
ﬁnd good use in studies and annotation of gene properties of
plants and may provide a further insight into the mechanisms
of translation initiation.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Advances in sequencing technology have greatly reduced
the costs incurred in collecting raw sequencing data. Academic labo-
ratories and researchers therefore now have access to very large data-
sets of genomic alterations but limited time and computational
resources to analyse their potential biological importance. Here, we
provide a web-based application, Cancer-Related Analysis of
Variants Toolkit, designed with an easy-to-use interface to facilitate
the high-throughput assessment and prioritization of genes and mis-
sense alterations important for cancer tumorigenesis. Cancer-Related
Analysis of Variants Toolkit provides predictive scores for germline vari-
ants, somatic mutations and relative gene importance, as well as an-
notations from published literature and databases. Results are emailed
to users as MS Excel spreadsheets and/or tab-separated text files.

1 INTRODUCTION

With the advent of high-throughput sequencing technology, re—
searchers face a bottleneck in terms of the time required to analyse
the potential impact on disease aetiology of the many genetic vari—
ants routinely detected. Computational algorithms can in principle
help researchers to prioritize and direct future experiments by nar—
rowing down the numerous genetic alterations identified in sequen-
cing studies. However, in practice, it can be challenging to run these
algorithms in a researcher’s own laboratory, owing to the require-
ments of third—party software and databases, and large hard disk
space and RAM specifications. We have developed Cancer—Related
Analysis of VAriants Toolkit (CRAVAT), a web—based application
that provides a simple interface to prioritize genes and variants im-
portant for tumorigenesis, allowing users to assess millions of vari—
ants in a single upload step (Fig. 1).

Numerous web implementations already exist for variant classi—
fiers [reviewed in Karchin (2009)]. CRAVAT handles both germline
and somatic variation but is dedicated to cancer genome analysis. It
accepts variant calls from sequencing studies in either genomic co-
ordinates (hg18 or hg19) or transcript coordinates—NCBI Refseq,

CCDS and Ensembl (Pruitt et a[., 2007, 2009; Flicek et a[., 2012).
Variants are mapped onto the best available transcript, using a
greedy algorithm (see Supplementary Methods), and those variants
that cause missense changes are identified. These variants can be
scored in terms of their predicted impact on tumorigenesis, using
the Cancer-Specific High-throughput Annotation of Somatic
Mutations (CHASM) method (Carter et al., 2009). They can also
be scored by their predicted impact on protein function, with the
Variant Effect Scoring Tool (VEST) (Carter et al., 2013). Genes are
ranked by their most significantly scored variant or mutation.
Results are linked with published information from the 1000
Genomes Project (Clarke et a[., 2012), the Exome Sequencing
Project, Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC)
(Forbes et a[., 2008), GeneCards (Harel et a[., 2009) and PubMed,
enabling users to compare predictions with known gene function,
cancer associations and clinical/experimental studies. CRAVAT re-
turns results via email in Excel and/or tab-separated text. It can also
provide a formatted submission file for mutation Position Imaging
Toolbox (muPIT) interactive (N.Niknafs et al., submitted for publi-
cation), allowing users to Visualize variants interactively in 3D, to—
gether with position-specific annotations.

2 SYSTEMS AND METHODS

CRAVAT runs on a Linux server with Apache Tomcat 6.0.35, and its
web interface is written as Java Server Pages. When a user submits a
job, a Java servlet is called, which places the job in the server’s queuing
system, built on Redis backend and written in Python. When the
queued job runs, a ‘master analyzer’ script written is launched to
perform requested analyses, calling and processing the result of our
prediction software and annotation utilities as needed. Local mirrors
of annotation source databases are updated monthly. Prediction tools
Single Nucleotide Variant Toolbox (SNVBox) (Wong et a[., 2011),
CHASM and VEST are updated several times a year.

Depending on server load, run time for analysis of 1000 SNVs is
~5—10 minutes. Run time scales linearly with the number of SNVs. A
job with 1.8 million SNVs takes from 4 to 13 days. Benchmarking
details are provided in the Supplementary Information. There is no
limit to the size of a job. To ensure that large jobs do not hold up
smaller jobs, jobs are separated into two queues, depending on size.

Breiman, 2001). The training set is a positive class of known cancer
drivers from the COSMIC database and a negative class of simulated
passenger mutations.

VEST: VEST scores variants by predicted protein functional
impact. It also uses parf to train a Random Forest classifier. The
VEST training set is a positive class of disease—causing germline vari—
ants from the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD
Professional 2012V2) (Stenson et al., 2009) and a negative class of
common variants from the Exome Sequencing Project dataset
(ESP6500 accessed July 2012) (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/]).

Both CHASM and VEST provide P—Values and false discovery
rate estimates to help the user establish a score cut-off for accepting
predictions.

SnvGet: Returns 86 pre—computed features for each variant from
the SNVBox database including the following: physiochemical prop-
erties of amino acid residues; scores derived from multiple sequence
alignments of protein or DNA; region—based amino acid sequence
composition; predicted properties of local protein structure; and an—
notations from the UniProtKB feature tables (UniProt Consortium
and others, 2012). These features are used by CHASM and VEST to
train classifiers and can be incorporated in new, user—generated pre-
dictive algorithms.

2.2 Annotation utilities

Each variant is annotated with database of single nucleotide poly-
morphisms identifiers, allele frequencies from the 1000 Genomes
Project and ESP6500 populations, gene function information from
the GeneCards database, the number of times that variant was
observed in the COSMIC database and previous cancer association
of the gene harbouring the variant, returned by PubMed search.

3 DISCUSSION

We provide an example to demonstrate how the CRAVAT web
server can prioritize and facilitate mutation analysis. We obtained
genomic coordinates of 184 824 mutations from The Cancer Genome
Atlas sequencing study of 248 endometrial tumors from Firehose.
We limited our submission to mutations that were called as
‘missense’ by Firehose, yielding 121440 mutations. Options for
‘Cancer Driver Analysis’, ‘CHASM’, ‘Uterus’ tissue type and
‘Include gene annotation’ were selected. Results were received via
email after 16h: Excel spreadsheet with pages for ‘Variant
Analysis’, ‘Amino Acid Level Analysis’ and ‘Gene Level Analysis’
and a separate text file to Visualize amino acid substitutions in

muPIT. On the ‘Variant Analysis’ sheet, 1066 mutations, of which
800 were unique, received a CHASM false discovery rate 50.3.
Many significantly scored mutations were involved in pathways
previously determined to impact endometrial cancer, e.g. PI3K,
Wnt signalling, MAPK signalling and p53 signalling pathways
(Kanehisa et al., 2012). Several genes from these pathways
(PIK3CA, PT EN, T P53, KRAS and CT NNBI) were known endo—
metrial cancer driver genes (Liang et al., 2012). In addition to iden—
tifying well-known drivers, CHASM identified potential drivers not
previously associated with endometrial cancer, in biologically rele-
vant pathways: Viz M TOR in the PI3K pathway and GSK-3B in the
Wnt signalling pathway).

3.1 Future work

CRAVAT is currently limited to analysis of missense mutations. We
shall provide additional tools to analyse other types of mutation and
to rank genes based on somatic mutation frequencies, aggregated P—
values of CHASM or VEST scores, ratios of truncating to
non—truncating mutations and counts of recurrently mutated pos-
itions. We also plan to include statistics useful in identifying which
variant calls may be artifacts.

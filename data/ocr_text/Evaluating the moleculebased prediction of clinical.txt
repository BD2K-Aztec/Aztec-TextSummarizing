Abstract

Motivation: Molecule—based prediction of drug response is one major task of precision oncology.
Recently, large—scale cancer genomic studies, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), provide
the opportunity to evaluate the predictive utility of molecular data for clinical drug responses in
multiple cancer types.

Results: Here, we first curated the drug treatment information from TCGA. Four chemotherapeutic
drugs had more than 180 clinical response records. Then, we developed a computational frame—
work to evaluate the molecule based predictions of clinical responses of the four drugs and to iden—
tify the corresponding molecular signatures. Results show that mRNA or miRNA expressions can
predict drug responses significantly better than random classifiers in specific cancer types. A few
signature genes are involved in drug response related pathways, such as DDBl in DNA repair path—
way and DLL4 in Notch signaling pathway. Finally, we applied the framework to predict responses
across multiple cancer types and found that the prediction performances get improved for cisplatin
based on miRNA expressions. Integrative analysis of clinical drug response data and molecular
data offers opportunities for discovering predictive markers in cancer. This study provides a start—

 

ing point to objectively evaluate the molecule—based predictions of clinical drug responses.

1 Introduction

Molecular polymorphisms and alterations play important roles in
heterogeneous anti—cancer drug responses (Wang et 61]., 2011). The
relationships between molecular features and clinical drug responses
lay the foundation for optimizing drug therapies based on a patient’s
genomic context. For example, metastatic breast tumors with HER2
overexpression are sensitive to trastuzumab (England, 2001); EGFR
mutations in non—small—cell lung cancer predict response to gefitinib
(Thompson et 61]., 2004). With the fast development and reduced
costs of high throughput technologies, more efforts are made to
identify genomic markers that can predict drug responses (Barretina
et 61]., 2012; Garnett et 61]., 2012). As precision medicine takes into
account the genomic variability of individuals in oncology practice
(Collins and Varmus, 2015; Garraway et 61]., 2013), accurately

predicting response to cancer drugs based on molecules becomes a
critical issue.

Cancer cell lines have been used to find gene expression signa—
tures which can predict in vitro drug sensitivities (Potti et 61]., 2006).
However, whether cell lines can capture the complex molecular al—
terations in real cancer patients is still in debate (Goodspeed et 61].,
2016). A few large—scale cancer genome projects, such as The
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), not only provide diverse molecular
data but also clinical information of cancer patients. By now, TCGA
has comprehensively characterized tens of cancer types via the
multi-dimensional analysis of gene mutation, copy number alter—
ation, DNA methylation, mRNA, miRNA and protein expression
(http://cancergenome.nih.gov/). TCGA has also expanded the know—
ledge about genomic similarities among multiple cancer lineages via

the Pan—Cancer studies (Chang et al., 2013). Its molecular data pro—
motes the development of oncology practices, such as targeted thera—
peutics (Rubio—perez et al., 2015) and prognosis prediction (Yuan
et al., 2014). However, the predictive utility of the diverse molecular
data for clinical drug responses has not been explored.

In this study, we aim at evaluating the utility of molecular data for
predicting clinical drug responses in cancer based on TCGA data.
First of all, we carefully curated the clinical data of drug treatments
from TCGA, extracted 152 drugs and 2572 patients with drug re—
sponse records, and then focused on four drugs (cisplatin, paclitaxel,
carboplatin and ﬂuorouracil) with relatively more clinical response re—
cords. Then we constructed a computational framework to evaluate
the performances of the molecule—based prediction of clinical drug re—
sponses using copy number alterations (CNAs), DNA methylations,
miRNA expressions and mRNA expressions. Compared to random
classifiers, expression data shows significantly better performances on
cisplatin or paclitaxel in specific cancer types. Also, we found that
some signature genes are involved in important cellular processes
known to mediate drug responses, such as DDB1 in DNA repair path-
way and DLL4 in Notch signaling pathway. In the following multiple
cancer analysis, it was found that miRNA expressions exhibit good
predictive performances across cancer types and the classifier fitted to
multiple cancer data can improve the predictions on certain single
cancer types. Our work offers the opportunity to study diverse mo—
lecular features of clinical drug responses in primary tumors. It is a
starting point to objectively evaluate the molecule—based predictions
of clinical anti—cancer drug responses.

2 Materials and methods

2.1 Drug response data acquisition

We curated the records of drug treatments from TCGA clinical data.
In the ‘clinical_drug_cancer.txt’ table, each row or entry recorded
one pair of drug and patient. After deleting the pairs with missing
drug response, we manually standardized the drug names according
to NCI drug dictionary and DrugBank (Wishart et al., 2006)
(Supplementary Table S1). Then, we deleted the records of those pa—
tients who responded inconsistently to one drug during the chron-
ology of therapy, since the different responses may be caused by
progressively acquired molecular alterations (Holohan et al., 2013),
and established the lists of drug—patient pairs in multiple cancers
(Supplementary Tables S2 86 S3). Considering that most patients re—
sponded to drugs (Supplementary Fig. S1), we combined the clinical
responses which used the RECIST standard (Eisenhauer et al., 2009)
as two types, namely responder (including complete response and
partial response) and non—responder (including stable disease and
progressive disease), as in previous studies (Geeleher et al., 2014;
Majumder et al., 2015). In addition, we collected the information of
neo—adjuvant therapies and the chronological orders between drug
treatments and tumor resections (see more details in Supplementary
Materials and Fig. S2). Based on these records, we deleted the pa—
tients who received drug treatments prior to tumor resections.

2.2 Molecular data collection

We then combined all the available molecular data with the curated
clinical drug response data via TCGA patient IDs. The molecular
data was downloaded from GDAC Firehose of Broad Institute,
including copy number alterations (CNAs), gene mutations, DNA
methylations, mRNA expressions, miRNA expressions and protein
activities. More descriptions about the gene—level values were pro—
vided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.

We constructed 21 core datasets. Each dataset is for one type of
molecular data, one cancer type and one drug. The datasets building
and data pre—processing were described in the Supplementary
Materials and Methods. These molecular data of the core datasets
was also provided via link: [http://bioinfo.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/mem
ber/ j gu/drug_response/ ] .

2.3 Molecule based prediction of clinical drug
responses

A computational framework was implemented to estimate the per—
formances of individual molecular data types on predicting clinical
drug responses and to identify related molecular signatures at the
same time (Supplementary Fig. S3). First, the studied dataset was
randomly split into training and testing subsets. Then, elastic net
with bootstrapping was used to select the molecular features which
can best predict the drug responses in the training dataset. The final
ensemble classifier was built based on the recurrently selected fea—
tures and evaluated on the testing dataset. The dataset splitting pro—
cess was repeated multiple times to estimate the predictive
performances. More descriptions about the framework were pro—
vided in Supplementary Materials and Methods. The practical appli—
cations of the framework were in Supplementary Table S5.

3 Results

3.1 Evaluation ofthe molecule—based drug responses
predictions in single cancer type

Among the 21 core datasets, expression datasets frequently show
high predictive performances (Fig. 1A). Two mRNA datasets of
cisplatin-BLCA and cisplatin—CESC get large average AUCs as 0.843
and 0.603 (significantly larger than 0.5 with one—sided Mann
Whitney U test, P—value 6.09e18 and 2.42e5, respectively).
Meanwhile, two miRNA datasets of paclitaxel—BRCA and cisplatin-
CESC get the average AUCs as 0.673 and 0.593, respectively
(P—value 4.77e8 and 5.33 e4). Two methylation datasets of
paclitaxel—BRCA and carboplatin—UCEC achieve the average AUCs
as 0.611 and 0.587, respectively (P—value 2.12e5 and 2.20e3). And
the CNA dataset of carboplatin—UCEC obtains the average AUC as
0.590 (P—value 8.27e5).

To evaluate the predictive performances more stringently, we
performed permutation tests to assess the statistical significances
(details provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods). Among
the seven datasets with potential predictive power, three have P—val—
ues smaller than 0.001, including one miRNA dataset of paclitaxel—
BRCA, and two mRNA datasets of cisplatin—BLCA and cisplatin—
CESC (Fig. 1B).

3.2 Identification of molecular signatures associated
with clinical drug responses
For the three datasets with significant predictive capabilities, we
identified the corresponding molecular signatures and performed
permutation tests to assess the statistical significance of each mo—
lecular feature in each signature (details in Supplementary Materials
and Methods). Here a molecular signature is defined as a group of
features that are recurrently selected by the predictive models. We
also assessed the features based on survival analysis, in vitro cell line
data, and literature mining (details in Supplementary Table S6).
Some genes in the identified signatures are involved in several
important cellular processes known to mediate drug responses. For
example, highly expressed DDB1 is an indicator of poor response
for cisplatin-BLCA. As we know, cisplatin binds to DNA, induces

DNA damages and kills cells via inducing apoptosis (Siddik, 2003).
DDB1 is an important positive regulator for nucleotide excision re—
pair (Li et al., 2006) which was responsible for resistance to
platinum—based agents (Galluzzi et al., 2014). In TCGA data, highly
expressed DDB1 is a strong indicator of poor response to cisplatin
(Fig. 2A). High DDB1 expression was also observed in cisplatin re—
sistance cancer cells (Chu and Chang, 1990). Meanwhile, survival
analysis on all 336 BLCA patients found that highly expressed
DDB1 was correlated with poor prognosis (Fig. 2B). INTS5, encod—
ing a subunit of the Integrator complex, is also significantly corre-
lated with patient survival (Fig. 2C). It’s surprising that the mRNA
signature as a whole can stratify patients into groups with different
risks (Supplementary Fig. S4). Another signature gene, YAF2 is up—
regulated in the patients with good responses. YAF2 directly inter-
acts with a transcription factor YY1, which has been reported to
negatively regulate p53 transcription under genotoxic stress
(Gronroos et al., 2004). These results suggest that DDB1 and YAF2
may regulate two different DNA repair pathways which play com—
plex roles in cisplatin resistance.

In the mRNA signature for cisplatin-CESC, DLL4 was identified
as a poor response feature. The blockade of DLL4 can inhibit tumor
growth through deregulated angiogenesis (Ridgway et al., 2006)
which is one cancer hallmark (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011). In
TCGA data, lowly expressed DLL4 is correlated with good response
of cisplatin. What’s more, lowly expressed DLL4 is correlated with
good prognosis in all 281 CESC patients (Fig. 2D). Though DLL4
was not directly reported to be related with cisplatin, NOTCH1,
one of DLL4’s receptors, is correlated with cisplatin response (Zhou

ues were calculated by log-rank test (patients living longer than 5 years were
right censored to 5 years)

et al., 2014). Besides DDL4, both HNRNPA3P3 and its pseudo gene
HNRNPA3P1 are also significantly correlated with CESC patient
survival (Fig. 2E, F). In the miRNA signature for paclitaxel-BRCA,
miR—30e is lowly expressed in non-responders. The inhibition of
miR—30e increases the self—renewal capacity and reduce apoptosis of
breast tumor—initiating cells (Yu et al., 2010).

3.3 Evaluation ofthe molecule—based drug response
predictions across cancer types

Though tumors from different tissue origins have heterogeneous mo—
lecular patterns, pan—cancer similarities among genomic aberrations
have been found, such as CNAs and mutations (Kandoth et al.,
2013; Zack et al., 2013). As some drugs are widely used in multiple
cancers, the construction of cross—cancer classifiers are helpful for
establishing molecule—based instructions for drug usages (Chang
et al., 2013). Therefore, we evaluated the predictive performances
on cisplatin and carboplatin across cancer types, considering as
many as possible the number of available cancer types and patients
(Supplementary Table S7).

In the cross—cancer analysis (training and testing on all available
cancer types), the CNA and methylation datasets exhibited limited
performances in predicting either cisplatin or carboplatin responses.
The miRNA and mRNA expression datasets showed higher AUCs
for cisplatin (Supplementary Fig. 85A), but only the miRNA expres—
sions get significant better performance than random classifiers ac—
cording to the permutation test (P—value 1.00e—14).

Then we evaluated the performances via testing on single cancer
types based on the models trained on multiple—cancer datasets. Out
of the 15 tests, eight show significantly different performances in

comparison with the single cancer type analyses (training and testing
both on single cancer type, two—sided paired t—test P—value < 0.05)
(Supplementary Fig. S5 B and Table S8). For the miRNA expression
datasets, the multiple—cancer classifiers performed much better on
cisplatin-BLCA and cisplatin—LUAD datasets (P—value 3.13e—5 and
5 .95—6, respectively. More details were presented in Supplementary
Results). In short, the multiple—cancer classifier of miRNA expres-
sion significantly improves performances on predicting cisplatin re—
sponses on several single cancer types.

4 Discussion

Predicting clinical drug responses by molecular data in human can—
cer is one important goal of precision oncology. In this study, we
carefully curated drug response records from TCGA and evaluated
the performances of diverse molecular data types on predicting the
clinical drug responses. In single cancer type analyses, mRNA and
miRNA expressions achieve significantly better performances in spe—
cific cancer types than random classifiers. Many identified signature
genes play important roles in the cellular processes known to medi—
ate drug resistance. We also found that miRNA expressions improve
performances for predicting cisplatin responses based on multiple—
cancer type analysis. On the contrary, CNAs and DNA methylations
show limited predictive capabilities either in single or multiple can-
cer type analyses.

Overall, the predictive performances of molecule—based classi—
fiers are not so good, although some of them performed significantly
better than random classifiers. The following problems may cause
current limitations: first, molecular patterns are highly complex due
to the tumor heterogeneity among patients (Bedard et al., 2013).
The available datasets cannot represent the whole picture of molecu—
lar alterations in cancer. Thus, the classifiers trained on limited data
could perform poorly on predicting new patients. Second, the mo—
lecular features far outnumber the patients. Many irrelevant features
may be selected by accident, although the sparse linear model was
used to reduce features and avoid model over—fitting. Thirdly, the
non—responders are usually much fewer. We observed that the num—
bers of non—responders are significantly correlated with the average
AUCs (Spearman rank correlation 0.988, P—value 0.0016) of the
mRNA datasets regardless of the drug—cancer pairs.

The predictive utility of mRNA expressions has also been re—
ported in cancer cell lines. According to a DREAM competition,
which aimed at identifying what methods and to what extent mo—
lecular data can predict in Ulti’O drug sensitivities, mRNA expres—
sions are found to provide the best predictive performance among
all molecular data types (Costello et al., 2014). It is also reported
that protein, mRNA and miRNA abundances provide the best per—
formance when modelling the G150 endpoint (Cortés—Ciriano et al.,
2016).

The identified signature genes and miRNAs based on mRNA or
miRNA expression data can provide novel insights of the mechanisms
of drug resistances. DDB1 belongs to the cisplatin—resistance corre—
lated nucleotide excision repair pathway, which is regarded as poten—
tial therapeutic targets (Pearl et al., 2015). DLL4, down—regulation of
which inhibited tumor growth (Ridgway et al., 2006), can be tar—
geted by Demcizumab, a drug in phase I clinical trial (Smith et al.,
2014). Other signature genes including INTS5, HNRNPA3 and
HNRNPA3P1 also show prognostic power, but the molecular mech—
anisms are still unclear. miR—30c, a homolog of signature miR—30e
and located in the same primary transcript, regulates paclitaxel resist—
ance in breast cancer cells (Bockhorn et al., 2013).

To our knowledge, our work is the first study to investigate the
predictive utility of the molecular data for clinical drug responses
from TCGA. Also, the curated pharmacogenomics data provides an
important resource for future studies.

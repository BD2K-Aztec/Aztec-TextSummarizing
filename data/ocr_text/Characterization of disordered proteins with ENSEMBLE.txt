ABSTRACT

Summary: ENSEMBLE is a computational approach for determining a
set of conformations that represents the structural ensemble of a
disordered protein based on input experimental data. The disordered
protein can be an unfolded or intrinsically disordered state. Here, we
introduce the latest version of the program, which has been enhanced
to facilitate its general release and includes an intuitive user interface,
as well as new approaches to treat data and analyse results.
Availability and implementation: ENSEMBLE is a program imple-
mented in C and embedded in a Perl wrapper. It is supported on
main Linux distributions. Source codes and installation files, including
a detailed example, can be freely downloaded at http://abragam.med.
utoronto.ca/~JFKlab.

1 INTRODUCTION

A detailed understanding of biology requires structural and
dynamic information for the proteins in the cell and their
dynamic excursions for enzymatic and other functions, as well
as their interactions, both transient and long-lived. There has
been an explosion of structural and dynamic information on
folded protein states that has coincided with the development
of computational tools for incorporation of experimental data
into algorithms to describe the dominant conformations popu-
lated by stable proteins [CNS (Brunger et al., 1998),
XPLOR-NIH (Schwieters et al., 2003) and CCP4 (Winn et al.,
2011)]. However, unfolded and intrinsically disordered states
have not been extensively characterized, although they are
highly relevant to both normal and pathological function.
Knowledge of unfolded states is important for understanding
protein stability, and these states are required to traverse the
membrane and are involved in aggregation or degradation in
many diseases (Dyson and Wright, 2004). Intrinsically dis-
ordered proteins often mediate regulatory protein interactions
and can act as entropic springs or steric gates, as well as

aggregate in disease (Dunker et al., 2008; Dyson and Wright,
2005; Uversky et al., 2008). Descriptions of the ensembles of
highly heterogeneous conformations within disordered states
are thus required for correlating dynamic structure with function.
A number of algorithms to calculate such ensembles have been
developed (Choy and F orman—Kay, 2001; Dedmon et al., 2005;
Fisher et al., 2010; Krzeminski et al., 2009; Salmon et al., 2010;
Schneider et al., 2012). Our ENSEMBLE approach (Choy and
F orman-Kay, 2001; Fisher et al., 2010; Marsh and F orman-Kay,
2009; Marsh and Forman-Kay, 2011; Marsh et al., 2007) was
created to facilitate the incorporation of a large number of dif-
ferent types of experimental data into the generation of structural
ensembles of disordered protein states.

ENSEMBLE makes use of a switching Monte-Carlo algo-
rithm to choose, from a large set of conformations, an ensemble
for which the in silico back-calculated data ﬁt all available
experimental data. Since its ﬁrst version (Choy and F orman-
Kay, 2001), we have developed a more robust algorithm,
enhanced the sampling of conformational space and expanded
the types of experimental data used. Applications of
ENSEMBLE to the unfolded state of the drkN SH3 domain
(Choy and Forman—Kay, 2001; Marsh and F orman—Kay, 2009;
Marsh et al., 2007) and the intrinsically disordered states of the
cell cycle protein Sicl (Mittag et al., 2010) and various protein
phosphatase 1 regulators (Marsh et al., 2010; Pinheiro et al.,
2011) have also been described. Importantly, using cross-
validation and synthetic experimental restraints calculated from
simulated ensembles, we demonstrated that ENSEMBLE is cap-
able of accurate modeling of the secondary structure, molecular
size distribution and tertiary contacts of disordered proteins, if
sufﬁcient data is incorporated; tertiary structure, in particular, is
highly dependent on the number of distance restraints used
(Marsh and F orman-Kay, 2012). Most recently, we have signiﬁ-
cantly improved the user interface and the stability of the pro-
gram. Thus, we are now making the ﬁrst ofﬁcial distribution
(version 2.1) available online at http://abragam.med.utoronto.

2 GENERAL SCHEME

ENSEMBLE currently accommodates ten different types of data
(modules), primarily from nuclear magnetic resonance experi-
ments [chemical shift, residual dipolar coupling, J -coupling, R2
relaxation rate, paramagnetic relaxation enhancement, paramag-
netic relaxation enhancement ratio, nuclear Overhauser effect,
solvent accessibility and hydrodynamic radius (Rh)] and small

angle X-ray scattering. Rh can also be obtained from size exclu-
sion chromatography or dynamic light scattering. The expected
observables for each type of data are back-calculated for each
conformer of a large set of input structures within the speciﬁc
module for this data type, in some cases using external programs
ShiftX (Neal et al., 2003), HYDROPRO (Ortega et al., 2011)
and CRYSOL (Svergun et al., 1995).

The algorithm that governs ENSEMBLE is more efﬁcient
when searching for best-ﬁtting structures within a set containing
<5000 conformations. Obtaining a reasonable sampling of the
theoretical conformational space for disordered proteins,
however, is not possible with such a low number of structures.
ENSEMBLE may be used for a variety of protein
conformational states including folded states—also inherently
dynamic, in which case this pool may be large enough. This
led us to construct a Perl wrapper, which is split into parts
(see Supplementary Material).

Conformer management: A large set of structures, called the
initial soup, is populated by structures provided by the user (e. g.
structures from simulations) and/or regularly replenished with
conformers generated by TraDES (Feldman and Hogue, 2000;
F eldman and Hogue, 2002). We found that at least 100 000 struc-
tures in the initial soup is sufﬁcient for conformational sampling.
The C core of ENSEMBLE acts on a subset of the initial soup
conformations, called the initial pool, containing randomly
selected structures from the initial soup. Each conformer can
be selected multiple times, but the algorithm favors conformers
that have been selected fewer times. The initial pool is prevented
from becoming larger than 5000 conformers by periodic removal
of those that do not contribute to ﬁtting the experimental data.
To increase sampling of conformational space, selected struc-
tures of the currently best ﬁtting ensemble can be slightly rando-
mized with TraDES and added to the initial soup and initial
pool.

The selection process: The C core of ENSEMBLE performs
the selection of an ensemble from all conformers present in the
initial pool. Each module is assigned a weight that determines its
importance in the scoring function. A module ﬁts the experimen-
tal data when its score is lower than a threshold value automat-
ically determined by ENSEMBLE, reﬂecting the back-calculated
data for the selected conformers matching the experimental data.
The module weights are changed and ENSEMBLE is run again
until all modules ﬁt the experimental data. The user can also
incorporate restraints incrementally.

T he final ensemble analysis: Once the selected ensemble ﬁts all
the experimental data, this ﬁnal ensemble is analyzed.
ENSEMBLE includes a set of scripts for analysis (Ca—Ca dis-
tances, radius of gyration, secondary structure distribution) and
management of binary structure and data ﬁles generated by the
program. These will be expanded in the future.

The release of this version of ENSEMBLE provides tools that
can be broadly used to enhance the understanding of structural
and dynamic properties of disordered proteins and their correl-
ations with biological function and disease.

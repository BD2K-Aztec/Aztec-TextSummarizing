ABSTRACT

Motivation: The ready availability of next-generation sequencing has
led to a situation where it is easy to produce very fragmentary genome
assemblies. We present a pipeline, SWiPS (Scaffolding With Protein
Sequences), that uses orthologous proteins to improve low quality
genome assemblies. The protein sequences are used as guides to
scaffold existing contigs, while simultaneously allowing the gene struc-
ture to be predicted by homology.

Results: To perform, SWiPS does not depend on a high N50 or whole
proteins being encoded on a single contig. We tested our algorithm on
simulated next-generation data from Ciona intestine/is, real
next-generation data from Drosophila melanogaster, a complex
genome assembly of Homo sapiens and the low coverage Sanger
sequence assembly of Callorhinchus milii. The improvements in N50
are of the order of ~20% for the C.intestinalis and H.sapiens assem-
blies, which is significant, considering the large size of intergenic re-
gions in these eukaryotes. Using the CEGMA pipeline to assess the
gene space represented in the genome assemblies, the number of
genes retrieved increased by >110% for C.milii and from 20 to 40%
for C.intestinalis. The scaffold error rates are low: 85—90% of scaffolds
are fully correct, and >95% of local contig joins are correct.

1 INTRODUCTION

New sequencing technologies have lowered the cost of generating
genomic DNA sequence to the point where high coverage of a
moderately sized animal genome (e. g. <1 Gb) can be obtained for
a few thousand euros. Currently, short read lengths (i.e. 100—
250 bp) present challenges for assembling sequence into a com-
plete genome, usually owing to an inability of short reads to
bridge repetitive sequence. This problem can be circumvented
by using paired end or mate paired reads with different insert
sizes long enough to span repetitive regions. For instance, the
genome of the giant panda (Li et al., 2010a) and, more recently,
the one of the naked mole-rat (Kim et al., 2011) have been
sequenced using short read sequencing technology alone and
achieved high quality. Both projects used multiple libraries; the
latter used 18 paired-end sequencing libraries with 8 different
insert sizes spanning 170 bp to 20 kbp. This strategy has the

disadvantage of incurring significant extra cost, and large
insert size libraries require larger amounts of DNA that may
not be readily available for some taxa.

Apart from mainstream de novo assemblers, several groups
have worked on incorporating available related assembled gen-
omes into the assembly process (Pop and Salzberg, 2008). For
instance, it is standard procedure (e.g. the orangutan genome
project, Locke et al., 2011) to use whole genome alignments to
build super scaffolds by aligning the new assembly to the high
quality genome of closely related species. Many species, however,
are sequenced precisely because they are not closely related to
species for which a complete genome is available.

Thus, other approaches have been adopted to increase assem-
bly contiguity. In Mortazavi et al. (2010), for example, re-
searchers exploited the eukaryote exon—intron gene structure
and used RNA-seq data to scaffold contigs from a
Caenorhabditis nematode genome, increasing the initial N50
from 5.0 to 9.4 kb. This strategy obviously requires the gener-
ation of RNA-Seq data in addition to genomic sequence, and
genes that are not expressed in the RNA-Seq library will not be
available for scaffolding.

As protein sequences are generally well conserved across dis-
tant taxa (compared with non-coding or DNA sequences), a
possible way to deal with fragmented initial assemblies is to
use orthologous proteins to guide the scaffolding of contigs
that encode fragments of the same proteins. Surget-Groba and
Montoya-Burgos used orthologous proteins to guide transcrip-
tome assembly by mapping contigs onto a related protein set and
improved the N50 of their zebrafish transcriptome assembly by
up to 42% (Surget-Groba and Montoya-Burgos, 2010). The
presence of introns, large intergenic regions and the much
larger volume of data involved in genome assemblies, however,
make this a fundamentally more difficult problem. Salzberg et al.
introduced a ‘gene-boosting’ algorithm that used amino acid se-
quences from predicted proteins to improve the scaffolding of a
6 Mb bacterial genome, although again, as bacterial proteins lack
introns, this is a somewhat easier problem to approach (Salzberg
et al., 2008).

Here, we present an algorithm that uses proteome sets from
different species to guide scaffolding of genome assemblies of
various qualities (including highly fragmented ones, e.g. N50
< 3 kb). In this article, we use the term scaffolding to refer to
the process of ordering and orienting contigs, although we
recognize that we do not estimate distances between contigs.
We call this SWiPS (Scaffolding With Protein Sequences).
Existing algorithms and strategies, including the Ensembl gene-
build process for low-coverage assemblies, and GPIPE (Heger

and Ponting, 2007), are not suited for highly fragmented assem-
blies where a gene may be spread over multiple contigs. SWiPS
uses orthologous proteins (possibly from distantly related spe-
cies) as guides to link exons of the same protein that may be
situated on different contigs. To our knowledge, only one other
published method, ESPRIT (Dessimoz et al., 2011), does this.
ESPRIT was used to bridge 666 Callorhinchus milii contigs from
a Sanger-based assembly together and reported precision of
~80%. ESPRIT, however, assumes a uniform evolutionary
rate over the entire length of split proteins, something that is
clearly questionable in the general case.

We present a novel score optimization framework for scaffold-
ing contigs and a strategy to optimize this score to improve the
contiguity of novel assemblies, reduce their fragmentation, as
well as predict the content of their exomes. We tested SWiPS
on a set of genomic assemblies of simulated Ciona intestinalis
next-generation sequencing data, real sequencing data from
Drosophila melanogaster, as well as the Sanger sequenced, but
low coverage (1.4x) assembly of C.milii and a pre—assembled
genome of Homo sapiens.

2 METHODS
2.1 Outline of method

The overall method is outlined in Figure l and described in detail in this
section. In brief, we ﬁrst identify contigs that include protein-coding
exons. Next, we order and orient these contigs by mapping them to pro-
teins, allowing multiple contigs to map to the same protein. We compute

Protein fragment predictions Improved contig assembly

Fig. 1. (A) Proteins in the chosen guide proteome are mapped to contigs
in the initial assembly with tblastn. All overlapping mappings considered
to be signiﬁcantly worse than the best one are removed. (B) Proteins with
good mappings on contigs are re—aligned with genewise to obtain single
nucleotide resolution of exon predictions. (C) Putative Exonic regions
(PEst) are predicted by overlapping contig regions containing multiple
homologous protein fragments. (D) PEst within each contig are used to
establish a reﬁned contig—protein orthology model, only allowing contigs
to map to different proteins if the associated sets of PEst show no
overlap. Then, contig gene models are built using this mapping. (E) A
score optimization heuristic is used to scaffold contigs together according
to the total score of protein models. (F) genewise is used once again on
the protein scaffolds to predict protein fragments. (G) A graph theoretic
approach is used to ﬁnd the local order of the contigs and their strand

similarity scores between proteins and contigs according to a distance
matrix. We use these scores to scaffold contigs together greedin by itera-
tively picking the best scaffold model and removing those contigs that
match it. Lastly, we link scaffolds into super-scaffolds by examining
contigs with multiple proteins which, in turn, are assigned to multiple
contigs.

2.2 Determining coding contigs and exonic regions

To determine which contigs might be protein coding, proteins from user-
speciﬁed guide proteomes are mapped onto the set of all contigs using
tblastn (Gertz et al., 2006). An initial protein—contig mapping is obtained
by assigning a contig to a protein if it (i) has a mapping e—value below
10‘5 and (ii) that e-value is under ﬁve orders of magnitude less signiﬁcant
than the most signiﬁcant contig mapping to the same protein region.
Proteins are allowed to map to multiple contigs. Two contigs are con-
sidered to map to the same protein region if the regions they map to
overlap by 15 amino acids. These parameters are chosen to be relaxed
compared with similar usage in previous studies, e.g. (Hahn et al., 2007).
However, more conservative parameters can be chosen at the cost of
sensitivity to gain running speed.

We reﬁne the tblastn-based protein to contig mapping using genewise,
to more precisely deﬁne exon boundaries (contigs of sufﬁcient length will
contain multiple exons from the same gene). We align the template pro-
tein to the contig using the ‘623’ model of genewise (Birney et al., 2004),
successively searching the regions of contig ﬂanking each alignment until
no more high scoring regions are found (although this is in principle
possible with the looping models of genewise, in practice these yield re-
sults that are hard to interpret). The results from all iterations are then
merged, and all mapping coordinates are corrected to yield one or mul-
tiple protein—contig pairwise alignments.

After re-aligning with genewise, a mapping from contig intervals to
protein intervals is established. Then, for every contig, the longest con-
tiguous regions with at least one protein mapping to every base in each
region are found and deﬁned to be Putative Exonic Regions (PEst), i.e.
PEst are intervals on contigs for which every base is covered by at least
one protein mapping. This deﬁnition of PExR is useful even if we expect a
single orthologous protein region to be homologous and map to the en-
tirety of a PExR. We found that the mapping of orthologous proteins
suffered from edge effects, i.e. orthologous regions with little similarity
can only be aligned if they are ﬂanked by orthologous sequences showing
high similarity. Because of the lack of potential ﬂanking region with high
similarity at the edges of orthologous regions, there is a drop in sensitivity
in the detection at the edges of these regions. Furthermore, splice variants
can have exons with alternative 3’ and 5’ splice sites. By combining all
protein mappings of the same contig region, we were able to predict
regions coding for exons with higher speciﬁcity.

2.3 Scaffolding contigs by optimization of overall protein
to contig mappings

At this stage, we have a reﬁned mapping of proteins to contigs. Using
these mappings, we compute a similarity score for each protein—contig
mapping by summing the bit scores across the aligned regions deﬁned by
genewise according to a distance matrix (BLOSUM62 in our case). We
now must order the contigs into scaffolds, by deﬁning orthology relation-
ships between the template protein and contigs mapping to different
regions of that protein. In cases where there is a clear one-to-one ortho-
logous relationship between the guide protein and its cognate in the newly
sequenced genome, this task is conceptually straightforward. Our
method, however, must allow us to disentangle orthology relationships
within gene families using fragmentary sequences. This complicates the
procedure considerably.

The protein—contig similarity scores only give us a partial picture of the
orthology relationships between proteins and contigs. The distribution of

similarity scores is strongly correlated with their lengths, and the strength
of stabilizing selection can be highly variable across loci. Therefore,
orthology relationships between a particular protein and contig cannot
be called without considering all other mappings between the contig and
other proteins. In order to take into consideration all mappings at once,
we posed the problem of scaffolding contigs as an optimization problem
for which we maximize the similarity scores between contigs and guide
proteins without creating inconsistencies. That is, we assign contig gene
models, i.e. regions of a contig that are predicted to encode the exons of a
single gene, to protein regions so that (i) each pair of contig gene model
and protein region is the coupling most likely to be orthologous (accord-
ing to similarity scores), (ii) there are no two contig gene models asso-
ciated to the same protein regions and (iii) we use as few proteins as
possible as scaffold models. The reasons for (i) and (ii) should be fairly
obvious, as we can only scaffold contigs together (and extend protein
gene models) if they contain PEst orthologous to different regions of
the same protein. Importantly, it can be seen that the implementation of
condition (i) in SWiPS is analogous to the best reciprocal hits approach to
identifying orthologous proteins. Condition (iii) is necessary for resolving
the problem of contigs mapping to legitimate orthologs from different
proteomes. By using as few protein scaffolds as possible, we can reduce
the spread of contig mappings over multiple protein orthologs or splice
variants. In SWiPS, the implementation of these ideas is summarized by
the deﬁnition of two concepts, the scaffolding power and the maximal
scaffoldable set, which are described next.

2.4 Scaffolding power and maximal scaffoldable set

For each potential guide protein, we retrieve all reﬁned contig mappings
and deﬁne regions of the guide protein into which the contigs cluster
(Fig. 2). To allow for mapping edge effects, contigs cluster together if
they overlap by 15 nucleotides or more. In all contig clusters, contigs that
have a low similarity score are removed if they are lower than at times the
highest similarity score (default 0120.75) (e.g. contig l in Fig. 3). The
mappings of multiple contigs to the guide protein can then be viewed as a
graph (Fig. 3). We calculate the score of all possible paths through this
graph, by exhaustively combining all contigs from different regions, sum-
ming the individual contig—protein match scores to get an overall score
for each path. All paths having scores with at least ,8 (default ,8=0.5)

Fig. 2. (A) Although contig 1 and 2 are mapped to protein Pl, they have
better mappings on protein P2 and P3, respectively. The similarity score
between contig l and P1 is lower than at = 0.75 times the similarity
score between contig l and P2, and is removed from P1. The similarity
score between contig 2 and P1 is within at of the similarity score between
contig 2 and P3, and both mappings are kept. (B) Contigs with similarity to
the P1 are clustered according to the region of similarity. Here, contigs 3
and 4 are clustered together in contig cluster 1, contig 5 is the only contig in
contig cluster 2, and contig 2 and 6 are clustered in contig cluster 3

times the highest scoring path are then compared, and contigs present in
all higher scoring paths are kept and form a maximal scaffoldable set,
with a score referred to as the scaffolding power. The default values of
or: 0.75 and ,8: 0.5 were chosen to be conservative, and make SWiPS
less likely to produce chimeric sequences from different paralogs within
the target genome. These two parameters, and how they affect the per-
formance of SWiPS in the presence of paralogs, are discussed next.
However, we have tested several values for at and ,8 on our
C.intestinalis runs and found that, for both, increased values resulted in
increased numbers of scaffolded contigs (and N50), but also in increased
rates of scaffolding error.

Contigs encoding in—paralogs, i.e. genes with many-to-one or
many-to-many relationships with members of the guide proteins,
cannot be reliably scaffolded because they result from one or more du-
plication events subsequent to the divergence from genes in the guide
proteome. Contigs resulting from duplication events prior to the diver-
gence from genes in the guide proteome (out-paralogs), however, can be
scaffolded. In SWiPS, at is used to uncouple contig—protein pairings that
have lower similarity scores than the one with the highest score (e.g.
contig 1 and P1 in Fig. 2). For example, an at = l forces every contig to
be coupled unambiguously with the protein with which it shares the high-
est similarity score, whereas an at = 0 implies that all contig—protein pair-
ings are kept for subsequent steps. Consequently, a high at can be used
when a complete set of closely related proteins is used as guide proteome,
and contigs encoding out-paralogs will be coupled unambiguously with
their orthologous proteins. However, if the set of closely related proteins
is incomplete, a high 0: may result in erroneous contig—protein couplings
that are considered unambiguous, thereby leading to scaffolding errors.
Our choice of 0.75 as the default value for at is thus conservative and
allows the use of incomplete protein sets.

Although 0: takes incomplete protein sets into consideration, our max-
imal scaffoldable set approach (which relies on ,8) takes into account
contigs encoding in-paralogs that cannot be scaffolded. If two contigs
encode in—paralogous sequences (contig 3 and 4 in Fig. 2B and 3), they
will form distinct paths that have similar scaffolding powers (e.g. path 1
and 3 in Fig. 3). Therefore, they will be excluded from the maximal
scaffoldable set (Fig. 3). Because the number of in-paralogs are poten-
tially high, we chose ,8 to be conservative.

Once the scaffolding power of each protein is computed, the protein
scaffold with the highest scaffolding power is iteratively picked, and the
maximal scaffoldable sets (and scaffolding power) of all other proteins
are updated so that a contig gene model (the contig region) is only used
once. Picking the protein scaffold with highest scaffolding power ensures

that contigs mapping to multiple orthologous proteins are scaffolded to-
gether by the ortholog that has the highest scaffolding power. After all
guide proteins above a minimum scaffolding power have been chosen, the
scaffolded contigs go through another scaffolding phase in which contigs
with multiple gene models are used to merge the scaffolds together. The
relative positions of contigs are clear when a single protein maps to them
because of the linear structure of a gene. However, the loci of some pro-
teins overlap and inferring the relative positions of these different contigs
can be problematic. To deal with simple cases, directed graphs are con-
structed according to the relative mapping position of the contigs on the
proteins. The order in which the contigs are traversed in these graphs
determines the contig ordering of the scaffolds. After this scaffolding step,
SWiPS takes all scaffolded contigs and uses genewise to build the ﬁnal
gene models.

2.5 Genome assembly data and guide protein sets

The C.intestinalis genome sequence, version 2.0 (Dehal et al., 2002) was
retrieved from Ensembl (release 63). 80X coverage Illumina 50 bp
paired-end reads were simulated using simLibrary and simNGS (http://
www.cbi.ac.uk/goldman-srv/simNGS/) with default parameters.
C.intestinalis was chosen owing to our underlying interest in deuteros-
tomes and for the pragmatic reasons that it is small and has not under-
gone a whole genome duplication. SOAPdenovo was used with default
parameters to assemble the simulated C.intestinalis reads (Li et al.,
2010b). For linguistic convenience, we refer to all SOAPdenovo-
generated sequences as contigs, even though these sequences include con-
tigs that have been scaffolded together using the insert size distributions
of paired-end sequence data.

Next-generation sequencing paired-end data from D.melan0gaster
DNA sequence were obtained from the short read archives (accession
SRX021790; MacKay et al., 2012), and were used to build an assembly
(N 50 = 1441 bp) with SOAPdenovo. The human (NA18507) genome as-
sembly (N50: 61980bp), built using SOAPdenovo, was obtained from
http://yh.genomics.org.cn/download.jsp.

For the comparison with ESPRIT (Dessimoz et al., 2011), we obtained
the genomic assembly of C.milii from http://esharkgenome.imcb.a-star.
edu.sg. This 1.4x assembly consists of 647 131 contigs (754 MB) with an
N50 of 1464 bp.

All protein sets used were retrieved from Ensembl, except for
Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and Saccoglossus kowalevskii (Genbank);
and Branchiostomaﬂoridae, Drosophila grimshawi, Heliconius melpomene,
Culex quinquefasciatus, Anopheles gambiae, Anopheles merus and
Anopheles quadriannulatus (Uniprot).

2.6 Estimating errors

All simulated contigs were mapped to the C.intestinalis, D.melan0gaster
or H .sapiens reference genome (all three from Ensembl) using blastn and
assigned a reference scaffold, strand and position. SWiPS-predicted scaf-
folds were considered correct if their mapped contigs are ordered cor-
rectly (within 100 kb of each other as eukaryotic introns are rarely
>100 kb; for human, we used 200 kb) across the reference scaffold on
the same strand. Note that contigs are allowed to be intercalated between
exon-containing scaffolds without affecting the assessed accuracy. We use
two measures of accuracy: (i) the percentage of contig joins that are cor-
rect—local link correctness, and (ii) the percentage of scaffolds (with at
least one contig link) for which all local contig links are correct.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Mapping ability with proteins from the same species

The extent to which contigs can be scaffolded by protein se-
quences will depend on the amount of protein-coding content

in the genome, and the ability to assign contigs to particular
protein-coding sequences. The latter will depend on the extent
of similarity between the guide proteins and the genome under
consideration. To understand the best possible outcome for the
scaffolding process, we ﬁrst tested SWiPS’s ability to assemble a
genome using a protein set from the same species as the genome.

We created a C.intestinalis genome assembly of the kind that
might be produced using a simple next-generation sequencing
strategy, with low N50 (section 2.5), and applied SWiPS, using
C.intestinalis proteins as guides for the scaffolding process.

Our algorithm improved the N50 of our simulated assembly
from 3851 bp to 6245 (62.2% increase) and reduced the number
of scaffolds from 108 424 to 94680, with 4134 out of 4510
(91.66%) scaffolding to be entirely correct (it should be noted
that the parameters used in this analysis were not optimized to
take into account that the guide proteins were of the same
species).

3.2 Use of orthologous protein sequences and dependence
on read depth

As a more realistic test, we scaffolded simulated C.intestinalis
assemblies using orthologous protein sequences from Danio
rerio, Spurpuratus, Gallus gallus, H.sapiens and S.k0walevskii.
To test the dependency on sequencing depth, we produced
assemblies based on the C.intestinalis genome at 10x, 20x,
40x and 80x coverage (section 2.5).

Irrespective of coverage depth, SWiPS was able to produce a
> 20% improvement in the N50 of the genome assembly, with a
corresponding increase in the numbers of scaffolded contigs
(Table 1). These numbers show that SWiPS appears to be
useful for improving assembly quality for even low coverage
(by next generation standards) datasets. Figure 4 shows an ex-
ample of a scaffolded region, with two proteins, one from Sea
Urchin and one from Saccoglossus providing evidence to link ﬁve
contigs from the SOAPdenovo assembly.

To test SWiPS on real next-generation data, we produced a
Dmelanogaster assembly from Illumina Genome Analyzer II se-
quence data. Using protein sequences from D.grimshawi,
Hmelpomene, C.quinquefasciatus, Caenorhabditis elegans,
A.gambiae, Amerus and A.quadriannulatus, SWiPS produced
an improvement of 11.1% on the assembly N50 and reduced
the number of contigs from 130312 to 123309 (Table 1). We
also tested SWiPS on a human assembly using protein sequences
from Cam's familiaris and Mus musculus. In this case, SWiPS
produced an improvement of 18.2% on the assembly N50 and
reduced the number of contigs from 314 877 to 306 882. We also
found that, when allowing only 100 kb between scaffolded con-
tigs (section 2.6), the assessed scaffold correctness was 70.6% and
the local scaffold correctness was 90.3%. However, allowing
200 kb (500kb) resulted in an assessed scaffold correctness of
85.3% (92.1%) and a local scaffold correctness of 96.0%
(98.3%).

We also tested SWiPS on low coverage Sanger sequenced data,
in the form of the 1.4x coverage genome of the elephant shark
Callorhinchus milli (Venkatesh et al., 2007). We obtained an im-
provement in N50 from 1464 bp (647131 scaffolds) to 1506 bp
(630 493 scaffolds), a 2.9% increase.

aSince human genes are known to possess longer introns than general eukaryotic genes, we allowed 200 kb (instead of 100 kb) to assess the accuracy of SWiPS on the human

assembly.

Fig. 4. Example of ﬁve contigs scaffolded using SWiPS. Protein
SACC29144576 links contigs ‘scaffold23914’, ‘C5811784’ and ‘scaf—
fold25071’ together, whereas SPUR115976525 links contigs ‘scaf—
fold23914’, ‘C5926424’ and ‘scaffold5359’ together. The two protein
models allow SWiPS to scaffold all contigs together. Each arrow repre-
sents a region of homology (dark grey); the intron—exon structure (light
grey and dark grey) of the orthologous proteins is clearly represented
within each scaffold

3.3 Comparison with other methods

To our knowledge, the only other program currently available to
scaffold genomic contigs using protein sequences is ESPRIT
(Dessimoz et al., 2011). To directly compare SWiPS with
ESPRIT, we applied the CEGMA pipeline to the C.milii refer-
ence genome. CEGMA uses a set of 248 core eukaryotic genes
that are generally present in low copy number to assess the com-
pleteness and quality of a genome assembly, and can serve as
complementary metric to the N50 length (Parra et al., 2009).
In our hands, the CEGMA pipeline detected 7 complete and
47 partial genes when assessing the initial reference genome,
while Dessimoz et al. reported 14 complete and 35 partial
genes. This difference is likely due to our use of a more recent

version of CEGMA. The overall similarity of the results, how-
ever, suggests a comparison of the performance of SWiPS and
ESPRIT is valid.

To link C.milii contigs together with SWiPS, we used the same
set of proteins used by ESPRIT, which consists of human,
mouse, anole lizard, chicken, African clawed frog, zebraﬁsh,
medaka, C.intestinalis and Bﬂoridae proteins. After linking 666
contig pairs with ESPRIT, Dessimoz et al. reported an increase
from 14 to 16 complete genes and from 35 to 38 partial genes, i.e.
a 14.3% and a 8.6% improvement, respectively. In comparison,
SWiPS was able to merge 27 659 contigs into 9121 scaffolds, and
increased the CEGMA gene space from 7 complete genes to 22
and 47 partial genes to 107, i.e. a 214.3% and a 118.4% improve-
ment, respectively. Even using Dessimoz et al. higher baseline of
14 complete genes, the new assembly produced by SWiPS im-
proved signiﬁcantly the complete gene space when compared
with ESPRIT (8 compared to 2, i.e. a 4-fold improvement).

4 DISCUSSION

We have shown that our method is able to use protein sequences
to order and orient contigs into scaffolds, thus improving assem-
bly contiguity and gene prediction, showing signiﬁcant improve-
ments over the only other available tool. Although the overall
improvements in N50 found by SWiPS may appear modest, they
should be understood with reference to the fact that the majority
of most animal genomes is composed of non-coding sequence,
and thus not amenable to scaffolding via protein coding
sequences.

To conﬁdently scaffold exon-containing regions on different
contigs, we need to be sure that they come from the same gene.
In the context of this problem, the most obvious way of doing
this is by assuming that our guide protein comes from a gene that
shares a 1:1 or manyzl orthologous relationship with the gene
encoded by the exons. We thus need to test that each exonic

region on a contig is orthologous to the guide protein. Rather
than constructing a full phylogeny for each exon region, we
maximize the overall similarity score of templates to exons for
all proteins that match equivalent sets of regions. As the ability
to discriminate orthologs from paralogs is fundamental to our
method, we expect it to perform best for proteins that have no
similar sequences in the genome, and less well where proteins
come from gene families with multiple closely related members.
Furthermore, the more closely related the template set of pro-
teins is to the target genome, the less likely our method is to be
confounded by gene duplication events that have occurred after
the template and target lineages have diverged.

Although inference of orthology is most obvious via overall
comparisons of sequence similarity, it is conceivable that other
sources of information may be useful. For instance, conservation
of exon/intron boundaries may help to discriminate between
orthologs and paralogs in cases where orthologs share intron
locations to the exclusion of paralogs. In practice, we were
able to ﬁnd few examples where this provided a signiﬁcant im-
provement on our current results (data not shown).

For many applications, the primary interest of a genome se-
quence lies in its encoded proteins. Coupled with the difﬁculty of
de novo genome assembly and gene prediction, this suggests that
transcriptome sequencing may be a more useful strategy for gen-
erating an initial survey of genome content. Transcriptome
sequencing, however, has major disadvantages compared with
genome sequencing. Firstly, not all genes are expressed in all
developmental stages and cell types, and for many taxa, it may
be difﬁcult to sample sufﬁcient transcriptional libraries to obtain
representation of all genes. Without this, it is difﬁcult to make
reliable inferences of the absence of particular genes. Secondly,
genome sequence contains a wealth of information not encoded
in the transcriptome, in the form of regulatory elements, synteny
information, gene structures and so on. Preliminary genome se-
quence is thus likely to be of greater long-term usefulness than
incomplete transcriptome data. Although genome assemblies
produced from single libraries of Illumina data (i.e. with only
one insert size) are likely to be very fragmentary (whatever the
sequencing depth), protein-coding content is likely to be depleted
in the repetitive sequence that causes assembly problems, at least
at the exon level. By allowing the scaffolding of exons on differ-
ent contigs, our method allows the maximum usefulness in terms
of protein-coding content to be extracted from these preliminary
assemblies.

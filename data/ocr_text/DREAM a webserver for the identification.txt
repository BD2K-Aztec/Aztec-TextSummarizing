Abstract

Summary: DREAM: detecting RNA editing associated with microRNAs, is a webserver for the iden-
tification of mature microRNA editing events using deep sequencing data. Raw microRNA
sequencing reads can be provided as input, the reads are aligned against the genome and custom
scripts process the data, search for potential editing sites and assess the statistical significance of
the findings. The output is a text file with the location and the statistical description of all the puta-

tive editing sites detected.

Availability and implementation: DREAM is freely available on the web at http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/

1 Introduction

Deep sequencing has many possible applications; one of them is the
identification and quantification of RNA editing sites. The most
common type of RNA editing is adenosine to inosine (A-to-I)
editing, catalyzed by enzymes of the adenosine deaminase that act
on RNA family (Nishikura, 2010). A prerequisite for this
editing process is a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) structure. Such
dsRNAs are formed as part of the microRNA (miRNA) matur-
ation process, and it is therefore expected that miRNAs are affected
by A-to-I editing. Indeed, dozens of editing sites were found in
miRNAs: A-to-I editing of primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) was shown
to affect the processing of the pri-miRNA to precursor miRNA (pre-
miRNA) or the processing of the pre-miRNA to mature miRNA
(Chawla and Sokol, 2014; Yang et al., 2006). Pri-miRNA and pre-
miRNA editing events may lead to an edited version of the mature
miRNAs. Mature miRNAs can bind to partially complementary tar-
gets located in the 3’ untranslated region of specific mRNAs and
block the translation or trigger degradation of the target mRNAs
(Bartel, 2004). Editing at the ‘seed’ region, bases 2—8 at the 5’ end of
the mature miRNA that are critical for target recognition, is

expected to change the set of target genes. A striking example is
mouse miR-376 in which editing in the recognition site alters the
target specificity of the miRNA and profoundly affects cellular proc-
esses (Kawahara et al., 2007). Deep sequencing data analysis may
unravel the full extent of A-to-I editing in miRNAs as well as other
types of RNA editing. However, technical problems in the analysis
of deep sequencing datasets may result in a false detection of
miRNA modification events (de Hoon et al., 2010). We have previ-
ously described a protocol which utilizes deep sequencing data to
characterize RNA editing in mature miRNAs from human and
mouse brain while avoiding technical data analysis problems (Alon
and Eisenberg, 2013; Alon et al., 2012). Other groups have also de-
tected miRNA editing events in the mouse brain during develop-
ment, in Drosophila and in C. elegans, demonstrating that editing
can add complexity to the miRNA gene regulation pathway
(Berezikov et al., 2011; Ekdahl et al., 2012; Vesely et al., 2012;
Warf et al., 2012). However, so far there is no tool allowing re-
searchers to detect mature miRNA editing sites without extensive
use of data analysis procedures. The DREAM webserver is expected
to make the editing detection procedure accessible to the large

2 Functionality

DREAM has been developed in Perl programming language and
using hypertext preprocessor (PHP) scripting. The required input is
sequencing reads of mature miRNAs in a standard Fastq format.
The webserver supports only human and mouse data obtained using
Illumina platform. Careful reads alignment is crucial for correct
identification of editing sites (Alon et al., 2012; de Hoon et al.,
2010), and thus the webserver does not support previously aligned
sequencing reads in SAM or BAM format. The preferred method to
supply the sequencing data to the webserver is by uploading it to a
public directory in a Dropbox account and providing the direct link
to the webserver. Using the direct link, the following compressed file
formats are allowed: zip, tar, tar.gz, tar.bz2 and rar. Fastq file, ei-
ther compressed or not, can be also uploaded directly to the web-
server, but this option is not recommended as upload times can be
quite long for large files (typically ~5 GB/h) and network interrup-
tions may prevent the completion of the upload. The user may fol-
low the upload progress using a progress bar at the bottom of the
webserver page, and receives a notification email upon upload com-
pletion, including an estimate on the process time, based on the size
of the data and the files in queue. Importantly, the webserver sup-
ports uploading and processing of several runs in parallel.
Therefore, the user must use a unique file name for every uploaded
file to avoid conﬂicting runs. To get a grasp of the usability of the
webserver and the expected results, a test dataset can also be used.
The test dataset is of mature miRNAs reads from mouse cerebellum
(Short Reads Archive accession number SRR346417). For the test
dataset the webserver parameters are automatically adjusted.

The Fastq file may include either unfiltered raw sequencing
reads, likely to contain parts of the adapter sequences, or reads that
were already filtered using Illumina software tools. In the former
case, the webserver can trim the adapters if the user supplies their se-
quences. As the expected length of mature miRNAs is ~21 bases,
reads longer than 28 bases or shorter than 15 bases (after trimming)
are discarded (Alon et al., 2012). Low-quality reads (as defined by
the read quality score) are unlikely to be informative. Therefore
reads with low sequencing quality (Phred-score <20) in more than
three positions are discarded (Alon et al., 2012). This pre-process
step takes place only if the user chooses the pre-processing option.

The filtered reads are aligned against the genome of interest
using Bowtie (Langmead et al., 2009). The UCSC hg19 and mm9
versions of the genome are used for human and mouse, respectively.
The webserver require unique best alignment, i.e. reads that do not
align to other locations in the genome with the same number of mis-
matches. Only alignments with up to one mismatch are used. These
steps are taken to solve the cross mapping problem that significantly
hinders identification of true editing sites in mature miRNAs
(Alon et al., 2012; de Hoon et al., 2010). Note that this procedure
might fail to detect some mature miRNAs with many edited
positions. The last two bases (the 3’ end) of mature miRNA undergo
extensive adenylation and uridylation (Burroughs et al., 2010),
and are therefore excluded (thus, editing events in these two bases
cannot be detected). This measure is necessary to ensure that
sufficient number of reads map with a single mismatch at most.
Next, the reads aligned to the genome are converted to counts
of each of the four possible nucleotides at each position along the
pre-miRNA sequence (miRBase, release 21; Kozomara and

Griffiths-Jones, 2011; http://www.mirbase.org/), for all the pre-
miRNAs. Performing this transformation allows focusing the ana-
lysis on bona fide miRNA only. In the following step, binomial stat-
istics is applied to distinguish significant modifications in these
regions from sequencing errors. The binomial statistics requires the
number of mismatches of a given type in a given position, the num-
ber of total reads in the given position, and the a priori sequencing
error probability. As only mismatches with Phred score of 30 are
allowed (Alon et al., 2012), we use 0.1% as the expected base call
error rate. Importantly, binomial statistics do not require any arbi-
trary expression level filter. The search for possible RNA editing
sites is performed for every position in every mature miRNA separ-
ately. As multiple tests are performed, the resulting P-value for each
position must be corrected accordingly. The type of the multiple
testing correction (either ‘Bonferroni’ or ‘Benjamini—Hochberg’) and
the required P-value (or False Discovery Rate) cutoff is chosen by
the user. Upon completion, a second email is sent to the user, con-
taining the results in text format. Spreadsheet software, like
Microsoft Excel, can be used to open the text file. For each signifi-
cant modifications detected, the output text file gives its type and
the location in the genome and in the miRNA (both inside the pre-
miRNA sequence and the mature miRNA sequence) according to
miRBase definitions (release 21). In addition, descriptive informa-
tion is given: the number of reads which show the modified base and
the total number of reads in this position. Lastly, the P-values calcu-
lated using the binomial test are given, as well as multiple testing ad-
justed P-values. Most of the detected modifications are expected to
be A-to-G (Alon et al., 2012), which can be a result of A-to-I editing
as the sequencing process identifies inosines as guanosines. Known
SNPs are automatically removed during the analysis (dbSNP, builds
138 and 142 for mouse and human, respectively). However, the de-
tected modifications can also be due to previously undetected or
rare SNPs, somatic mutations, other RNA modifications processes
or technical artifacts (Li et al., 2011; Lin et al., 2012), and therefore
post-processing is recommended (Alon and Eisenberg, 2015).

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Prior biological knowledge greatly facilitates the mean-
ingful interpretation of gene-expression data. Causal networks
constructed from individual relationships curated from the literature
are particularly suited for this task, since they create mechanistic
hypotheses that explain the expression changes observed in datasets.
Results: We present and discuss a suite of algorithms and tools for
inferring and scoring regulator networks upstream of gene-expression
data based on a large-scale causal network derived from the Ingenuity
Knowledge Base. We extend the method to predict downstream
effects on biological functions and diseases and demonstrate the
validity of our approach by applying it to example datasets.
Availability: The causal analytics tools ‘Upstream Regulator Analysis’,
‘Mechanistic Networks’, ‘Causal Network Analysis’ and ‘Downstream
Effects Analysis’ are implemented and available within Ingenuity
Pathway Analysis (IPA, http://www.ingenuity.com).

Supplementary information: Supplementary material is available at

1 INTRODUCTION

The interpretation of high-throughput gene-expression data
is greatly facilitated by the consideration of prior biological
knowledge. Traditionally this has been done using statistical
gene-set-enrichment methods where differentially expressed
genes are intersected with sets of genes that are associated with
a particular biological function or pathway (Abatangelo et al.,
2009). One more recent approach involves the application of
causal networks that integrate previously observed cause—effect
relationships reported in the literature (Chindelevitch et al.,
2012a; Felciano et al., 2013; Kumar et a]. 2010; Martin et al.,
2012; Pollard et al., 2005). While still depending on statistics, this
is more powerful than gene-set enrichment since it leverages
knowledge about the direction of effects rather than mere asso-
ciations. In this article, we describe causal analysis approaches
that have been implemented in Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
(IPA) with particular focus on the details of the underlying
algorithms, and the application to a number of real-world use
cases. IPA is a commercial software package and is described in
the supplementary material.

Given a gene-expression dataset, our main goals are to eluci-
date the upstream biological causes and probable downstream

effects on cellular and organismal biology. It is critical to infer
the identity of upstream regulatory molecules and associated
mechanisms to provide biological insight to the observed expres-
sion changes. We also aim to predict whether such regulators
are activated or inhibited based on the distinct up- and down-
regulation pattern of the expressed genes, and determine which
causal relationships previously reported in the literature are
likely relevant for the biological mechanisms underlying the
data. Upstream regulators are not limited to transcription fac-
tors; they can be any gene or small molecule that has been
observed experimentally to affect gene expression in some
direct or indirect way. A similar approach, relying on the same
methodology is also used to predict downstream functional ef-
fects and phenotypes. Apart from generating likely mechanistic
hypotheses, causal inference can also be used to find potential
upstream regulators with a response opposite to the observed
expression pattern, which is useful for the prediction of thera-
peutic compound effects. This application is similar to the
approach taken by the Connectivity Map tool (Lamb et al.,
2006), except that here we rely on the wide range of literature-
curated biological findings about compounds and their inter-
actions instead of a gene-expression database derived from
in vitro tested compounds.

The causal network underlying our algorithms is based on the
Ingenuity Knowledge Base, a large structured collection of
observations in various experimental contexts with nearly 5 mil-
lion f1ndings manually curated from the biomedical literature or
integrated from third-party databases. The network contains
~40 000 nodes that represent mammalian genes and their prod-
ucts, chemical compounds, microRNA molecules and biological
functions. Nodes are connected by ~1480 000 edges representing
experimentally observed cause—effect relationships that relate
to expression, transcription, activation, molecular modification
and transport as well as binding events. Network edges are also
associated with a direction of the causal effect, i.e. either activat-
ing or inhibiting.

We describe four causal analytics algorithms that are available
in IPA: (i) Upstream Regulator Analysis (URA) determines likely
upstream regulators that are connected to dataset genes through a
set of direct or indirect relationships; (ii) Mechanistic Networks
(MN) builds on URA by connecting regulators that are likely
part of the same signaling or causal mechanism in hypothesis
networks; (iii) Causal Network Analysis (CNA) is a generaliza-
tion of URA that connects upstream regulators to dataset mol-
ecules but takes advantage of paths that involve more than one
link (i.e. through intermediate regulators), and can be used to
generate a more complete picture of possible root causes for the
observed expression changes; and (iv) Downstream Effects

Analysis (DEA) applies the methodology of URA to the inference
of and impact on biological functions and diseases that are down-
stream of the genes whose expression has been altered in a
dataset. Using several examples we show how these tools are
applied to gene-expression data in practice.

2 APPROACH

The inference of upstream regulators needs to be based on stat-
istics since it cannot be guaranteed that all relationships present
in the causal network are relevant and actually occur in the given
experimental context. Also, genes are often modulated by several
upstream regulators (sometimes with opposing effects), and it is
not known a priori which will dominate in a particular system.
Filtering literature ﬁndings by speciﬁc contexts (e.g. by a par-
ticular tissue or cell line) generally does not work well because it
leads to networks that are too sparse for meaningful inference.
We therefore construct many possible upstream regulators and
networks serving as hypotheses for the actual biological mech-
anism underlying the data, and then score those regulators by
their statistical signiﬁcance. In particular, we use two scores that
address two independent aspects of the inference problem: an
‘enrichment’ score [Fisher’s exact test (FET) P—value] that meas-
ures overlap of observed and predicted regulated gene sets, and a
Z—score assessing the match of observed and predicted up/down
regulation patterns. We ﬁnd that a Z—score is particularly suited
for this kind of problem since it serves as both a signiﬁcance
measure and a predictor for the activation state of the regulator.

A similar approach has been reported in Pollard 6t 01. (2005)
where ‘richness’ and ‘concordance’ P—values are used to score
regulators of expression changes derived from type 2 diabetes
patients. More recently Chindelevitch 6t al. (2012a,b) present a
rigorous discussion of statistical signiﬁcance in a causal network
with signed interactions based on a ‘ternary dot product distri-
bution’. This is achieved by transforming the network such
that edge signs are projected onto the nodes, and exact
P—values are computed separately for both possible activation
states of a given upstream regulator. In contrast, the Z—score
used in the present approach, represents an (asymptotic
Gaussian) approximation, but is easier to compute and combines
both cases into one score.

3 METHODS

The various causal analysis methods used in IPA are described below.

3.1 Causal network

Causal analysis algorithms are based on a ‘master’ network which is
derived from the Ingenuity Knowledge Base, and given by a directed
multigraph G = (V, E) with nodes v e V representing mammalian genes,
chemicals, protein families, complexes, microRNA species and biological
processes, and edges 6 e E reﬂecting observed cause—effect relationships.
For the following let Vg C Vbe the set of all genes, and V1, C Vthe set of
all biological processes. For each edge 6 e E, we deﬁne functions 0(6) and
1(6) that map 6 to its unique source and target nodes, respectively. The
graph G has no self-edges, i.e. V6 6 E : 1(6) 75 0(6). Each edge in 6 e E is
associated with a set of underlying ﬁndings F(6) obtained from the litera-
ture, where each ﬁnding f e F(6) is associated with a ‘sign’
§( f ) e {—l,0, 1} that represents the regulation direction of the causal
effect. If §( f ) = l(—l) effect is activating (inhibiting), and for §( f ) = 0,

the direction of the effect is unknown or ambiguous. Depending on the
underlying ﬁndings, edges are classiﬁed into the distinct types, ‘T’, ‘A’ and
‘P’, represented by three disjoint subsets of E: E,, E, and ED. T-edges are
related to transcription and expression events including protein—DNA
binding (i.e. regulation of the abundance of the target node), while
A-edges represent the functional activation or inhibition of the target
node (e.g. through phosphorylation in a signaling cascade). P-edges are
associated with the regulation of biological processes (e. g. apoptosis). The
master network G is a multigraph since two given source and target nodes
can be connected by a T-edge, and an A-edge at the same time.

The various ﬁnding categories and their respective association with
edge types and signs are given in a table in the Supplementary
Material. Findings about changes of molecular modiﬁcation states (e.g.
phosphorylation) are included in the A-edge type if an activating or
inhibiting effect can be inferred. All T-edges are connected to genes
as their target nodes, 6 e E, => 1(6) 6 Vg, and all P-edges connect to
biological processes, 6 e E1, => 1(6) 6 V1,. Depending on the signs of the
underlying ﬁndings, each edge 6 e E is in turn associated with a unique
direction of the causal effect that is either activating, inhibiting or
unknown, and represented by the sign S(€) e {—l, 0, 1}. In addition, we
also associate edges with weights w(6) e [0, l) reﬂecting our conﬁdence in
the assigned direction of the effect. Details are given in the Supplementary
Material.

3.2 Gene-expression data

All differentially expressed genes in a given dataset that are also present
as nodes in the master network form a subset D C Vg. The methods
described here do not take individual expression levels into account but
instead assume that transcriptionally altered genes have been determined
using a suitable cut off applied to the measured expression change.
Each gene in the dataset, d e D, can be either up- or down-regulated
which is represented by the sign SD(d) e {—l, l}.

3.3 Upstream Regulator Analysis

The goal of URA is to identify molecules upstream of the genes in the
dataset that potentially explain the observed expression changes. Since
it is a priori unknown which causal edges in the master network are
applicable to the experimental context, we use a statistical approach to
determine and score those regulators whose network connections
to dataset genes as well as associated regulation directions are unlikely
to occur in a random model. In particular, we deﬁne an overlap P—value
measuring enrichment of network-regulated genes in the dataset, as
well as an activation Z—score which can be used to ﬁnd likely regulating
molecules based on a statistically signiﬁcant pattern match of up- and
down-regulation, and also to predict the activation state (either activated
or inhibited) of a putative regulator.

Here, we consider transcription and expression (T) edges only by look-
ing at the subgraph G’ = (V, E,), and deﬁning the subset of genes that are
regulated by at least one edge in G’,

V,g 2: {v e Vg|E|6 e E, : v = 1(6)}.

A potential regulator r can be any node in V that is either a gene, protein
family, complex, microRNA, or chemical. For a particular given regula-
tor r e V, we deﬁne the set of downstream regulated genes as

R(r) 2: {v E Vrg|E|6 E E, : r = 0(6) /\ v = 1(6)}.

For each v e R(r), the sign of v is deﬁned as regulation direction of v
under the assumption that r is activated, which is given by the regulation
direction of the connecting edge, as

SR(r, v) :2 S(€) where r = 0(6) /\ v = 1(6) and 6 e El.
Similarly we deﬁne the weight associated with v to be

wR(r, v) :2 w(6) where r = 0(6) /\ v = 1(6) and 6 e El.

3.3.] Overlap P-value For a particular regulator r the overlap
P—value p(r) measures enrichment of r—regulated genes in the dataset D
without taking into account the regulation direction, i.e. independent of
the edge weight or sign (Fig. 1A). Protein—DNA-binding edges with sign
equal to zero are included. The calculation is based on the one-sided FET
which assumes a random dataset with a constant number of genes as the
null model, and where the P—value is given by

min(c,d)

3 .3 .2. ActivatiOn Z—score The activation Z—score makes predictions
about potential regulators by using information about the direction of
gene regulation. Its purpose is two-fold: ﬁrst, it can be used to infer the
activation state of a putative regulator (i.e. whether the regulator is
activated or inhibited). This is achieved by assessing consistency of the
pattern match between the up/down gene-regulation pattern and the
activation/inhibition pattern given by the network relative to a random
pattern. Second, similar to the overlap P—value, the Z—score can be used to
determine likely regulators based on statistical signiﬁcance of the pattern
match. However, the latter use requires careful assessment whether the
underlying null model is appropriate, which is discussed in more detail
below. For the purpose of the activation Z—score we only consider edges
where the regulation direction is well-deﬁned, i.e. S e {—l, 1} (Fig. 1B).
For a particular regulator r the ‘overlap’ between r-regulated genes and
the dataset is then given by

G(r): = {v E R(r)|SR(r, v) 75 0 /\ v E D}
and we deﬁne the activation Z—score as

Z wR(r, v)SR(r, v)SD(v)

20.) : veO

1 /2
(Z [WR(r, 012)

 

veO

As shown below 2(r) is approximately normally distributed for random
signs SR(r, v) or SD(v), so we can interpret z in the following way: if |z| is
high enough (say |z| > 2) we consider the match between the signs SR(r, v)
and SD(v) as being signiﬁcant. The sign of 2 then determines whether the
regulator r is predicted to be activated or inhibited. For z<0 the signs
SR(r, v) and SR(r, v) are mostly opposite, consistent with the regulator
being in an inhibited state, while for z>0 both signs are mostly the
same, consistent with an activated regulator.

In the following, we take a detailed look at the underlying null

model: Let N = IGI and the index i=1, ...,N runs over all nodes
v,- e G. We consider the product SR(r, v,)sD(v,-) as being represented by

independent and identically distributed random variables x, e {—l, l}
where both values —1 and l have equal probabilities l/2. Expectation
value and variance of x,- are then given by [E[x,-] = 0 and V[xi] = 1. Let
w,- = wR(r, v,) be the weights of the edges connecting r to v,-. Setting now
)2 = Z, wixi with [E[y] = 0, and V[y] = 02 = Z, wlz, and noting that
z = y/0 it is seen that approximately 2 ~ N(0, l) for large enough N.
The validity of 2(r) to test for statistical signiﬁcance of the regulator
depends on whether the null model described above is deemed appropri-
ate. Consider the extreme case where all dataset genes are up-regulated
and the regulator r has only activating downstream connections.
Assuming for simplicity that all weights are equal to l, we then have
z(r) = [N which is >2 for N > 4. However, this would not be perceived
as a signiﬁcant match since any regulator with only activating down-
stream edges (and N > 4) would come up as signiﬁcant for this dataset.
A better null model for calling signiﬁcant regulators is based on rando-
mizing the data rather than randomly ﬂipping regulation directions.
One possibility is to permute labels of genes in D while keeping their
regulation direction and the size of the overlap N constant. This can be
achieved approximately by skewing the distribution of the random
variables x,- deﬁned above, i.e. by setting their expectation value it to a
non-zero value it 2 up 11R where up (or 11R) is given by the expectation
value of the sign when randomly (and independently) picking a dataset
gene (or an edge downstream of r). In particular we have up =  SD
and it]; = NLRZSR, where the sums run over all N D dataset genes, and

over all N R r—regulated genes. For the approximation to be valid, we also
assume that lul is not too close to l, and for simplicity we keep the
weights w,- ﬁxed.

The activation Z—score 2(r) reﬂects a reasonable null model for calling
signiﬁcant regulators if the expectation value it is sufﬁciently close to
zero. In practice, we ﬂag all regulators where lul > 0.25 to indicate that
the calculated Z—score should not be used for signiﬁcance calls. In the
case when the regulation directions of the dataset and downstream causal
edges are skewed, it is possible to deﬁne a ‘bias—corrected’ Z—score
(described in the Supplementary Material and available as an option in
IPA) that can be used to determine statistically signiﬁcant regulators.

3.4 Mechanistic Networks: inferring likely causal
mechanisms

Regulators determined with URA are not necessarily independent of each
other. It is for instance possible that the causal effect of a regulator r1 on
the dataset is relayed through another regulator r2, with both regulators
r1 and r2 coming up as independent signiﬁcant hits. One indication for
this is that r1 and r2 are themselves connected by a causal edge r1 —> r2
in G. The goal of the MN algorithm is to determine those network edges
between pre-determined upstream regulators for which there is statistical
evidence that the corresponding relationship is likely relevant for the
causal mechanism behind the dataset. The most signiﬁcant causal edges
between regulators are then used to construct networks downstream of
a ‘master’ regulator in order to indicate possible causal (e.g. signaling)
mechanisms.

The algorithm is based on the following idea: if the causal effect of r1
on some data set molecule d e D is transmitted through the intermediate
regulator r2, we expect an elevated occurrence of cases where all three
edges, r1 —> r2, r2 —> d and r1 —> d are present in the network, and the
edge r1 —> dis explained by the path r1 —> r2 —> d. We therefore look for
statistical enrichment of these ‘causal transitive triangles’ (Fig. 2A). This
enrichment is given by the intersection of the overlaps of the regulated
gene sets 0(r1) ﬂ 0(r2) in the dataset (Fig. 2B and C), i.e. we compute the
FET P—value with D O R,g serving as the universe. These FET P—values
are calculated for every edge r1 —> r2 in G for which the regulators r1 and
r2 meet pre-deﬁned cut-offs with respect to their overlap P—value p(r) and
activation Z—score 2(r). For every upstream regulator r, the MN algo-
rithm then constructs downstream networks with predeﬁned ‘breadth’ N

and ‘depth’ K from signiﬁcant causal edges that connect r to dataset genes
through several links by using the following recursive algorithm.

(1) Starting from any upstream regulator r, select N regulators 5,- that
are connected downstream through causal edges with lowest edge
P—values.

(2) For each 5,: if maximal path length K is reached or a cycle is
detected, skip, else set r := 5, and go to (l).

(3) Build network from union of all traversed edges.

Through the inference of likely relevant causal relationships the MN al-
gorithm makes a prediction about which previously identiﬁed regulators
are closer to the dataset genes than others in a causal chain of events.
However, it is possible that the constructed networks are incomplete be-
cause not enough statistical evidence could be collected for missing edges.
The algorithm does not enforce consistency of the predicted activation
states and also accepts protein—protein binding edges as causal connec-
tions between upstream regulators.

3.5 Causal Network Analysis: exhaustive enumeration of
possible root causes

The CNA algorithm generalizes URA by including paths from regulators
to regulated molecules that involve more than one edge. For a given ‘root’
regulator r this is done by constructing shortest paths up to a certain
length from r to dataset molecules, and constructing networks from the
union of those paths in order to build mechanistic hypotheses.
Hypothesis networks are then statistically scored using overlap P—value
and activation Z—scores, and the activation state of the root regulator
is determined. In contrast to URA, for simplicity, we are not taking
continuous edge weights into account, but instead set all edge weights
to 1 if they pass a predeﬁned cut off 6 (set to 6 = 0.25 in the implemen-
tation). We only consider edges with non-ambiguous directions of regu-
lation, i.e. non-zero sign 5(6). The algorithm operates on the multigraph
G = (V, E, U E,), where the included sets of A- and T-edges are given
by EM 2 {6 e Ea/,|w(6) Z 6}, and the set of regulated genes (through
T-edges) is V, = {v e Vg|E|6 e E, : v = 1(6)}.

For each node r e V, we construct all shortest paths P from r to every
gene v e Vrg in G. These paths with length K are represented by sets of
edges P = {61, ...,6K}, where 61, ...€K_1 6 Eu, 6K 6 E, and 0(61) 2 r,
‘C(€K) = v, 1(6,_1) = 0(6,-). For any given path P, we deﬁne the sign

5p(P) = H 5(6)

eeP

which represents the composite direction of regulation for a signal passed
through the path as a causal sequence of events.

For each pair of nodes r e V, v e V,g(r 75 v) with at least one shortest
path P connecting r and v, we deﬁne a ‘virtual’ edge r —> v representing
all shortest paths connecting r and v if all those paths are consistent,
i.e. have the same net effect 5p (Fig. 3A and B). We then collect

all virtual edges corresponding to paths with length K in a set EK.
Note that E1 = E, and all sets EK are disjoint. The sign 5(6) 6 {—l, l}
of 6 e EK is then deﬁned by 5(6) :2 5p(P) where P is any shortest path
associated with 6. We proceed by constructing graphs GK composed of
virtual edges, representing paths with maximal length K:

K
GK = (V, U Ek).
k=1
Note, that the GK are nested subgraphs of each other, i.e. GK C GL
if K< L, , with the special case G1 = (V, E,).

For every potential regulator r e V the algorithm computes overlap
P—values pK(r) and activation Z—scores zK(r) by applying URA (with all
edge weights set to 1) independently to all networks GK. Hypothesis
networks are then constructed from the union of all paths P connecting
r to the dataset molecules. For any given regulator r there may be multiple
hypotheses corresponding to the different values of K. These hypotheses
again represent nested subgraphs with their sets of regulated genes given
by Rm) 2 {v e VrglEle e EK : v = 1(6)/\ r = 0(6)}, and RN) c Rm) if
K < L. In practice we only construct hypotheses with K 5 3.

In order to limit the number of networks returned by the algorithm
we only include hypotheses that add substantial information to the
‘sub’-hypotheses that are contained in the same network, i.e. in the
spirit of Occam’s razor preference is given to simpler networks. In par-
ticular, we require that (i) the overlap P—value of a hypothesis is more
signiﬁcant than the P—value of a contained hypothesis, pK(r) <pK_1(r),
and (ii) the set of regulated molecules is different from the set of molecules
targeted by any individual sub-network.

We note that all constructed hypothesis networks are completely
consistent with respect to their direction of edge effects, and may contain
loops only if a regulator node appears as a dataset molecule in D at the
same time.

3.6 Network-bias-corrected P—value

Overlap P—values p(r) calculated using the method described in Section
3.3 may be skewed, i.e. may appear too signiﬁcant because of the presence
of network hub genes in the dataset. Hub genes are connected to many
upstream regulators so their occurrence in a hypothesis network is less
surprising. To correct for this network bias, we also calculate a network-
bias-corrected P—value that measures signiﬁcance of the overlap between
the dataset and regulated genes by comparing to overlaps of random
datasets with distributions of in—degrees similar to the actual dataset,
and therefore preserving network topology. To perform this statistic,
we divide the sets of regulated genes V,g or V,g into bins containing
only genes whose in-degree lies within a certain range. We sample

independently from each bin such that the number of genes drawn cor-
responds to the number of dataset genes that fall in that bin. The (right-
sided) P—value is then calculated from the distribution of the overlap with
the hypothesis-regulated genes as before. If there is only one bin contain-
ing all genes, the resulting P—value is the regular FET overlap P—value
deﬁned in Section 3.3. If the number of bins is >1, this P—value needs
to be calculated numerically by explicit permutation sampling. In our
implementation, this is done using at most 10 000 independent permuta-
tions of genes (fewer if the estimated P—value>0.01). The minimum
P—value that can be computed this way is therefore 10—4. The computa-
tion of the network-bias-corrected P—value uses bins based on a logarith-
mic scale with base 2, so the ranges of in—degrees are {1}, {2,3}, (4,. . . ,7},
{8,...,15}, {16,...,31}, etc.

3.7 Downstream Effects Analysis
The goal of DEA is to identify those biological processes and functions
that are likely to be causally affected by up- and down-regulated genes. In
addition, it is also predicted whether those processes are increased or
decreased. The approach is very similar to that of URA, except that
the direction of edges connecting the dataset genes with the predicted
entity (here, the biological process or disease) is reversed. The calculation
of the overlap P—value is essentially the same as in standard enrichment
functional analysis (an existing IPA feature).

For the calculation of the activation Z—score, we consider the graph
G = (Vg U V1,, E) as the underlying network, and deﬁne edge signs and
weights as 5R(v, p) := 5(6) and wR(v, p) := 5(6) where v = 0(6) /\ p = 1(6)
and 6 6 Ep. For any given process p, the set of genes regulating that
process is

R(p) = {v E Vg|E|6 E E1’ : v = 0(6) Ap = 1(6) /\ 5R(v,p) 75 0}
and the overlap with the dataset is given by
(3(p) = R(p) r1 D.

The activation Z—score z(p) is then given by the corresponding formula in
Section 3.3 and its sign is used to predict whether the downstream process
is increased or decreased.

4 IMPLEMENTATION

IPA enables end-users to execute URA, MN, DEA and CNA
prediction algorithms when analyzing their datasets. In this web
application, the user selects a gene-expression dataset to analyze,
and speciﬁes several optional settings that will tailor the analysis
as desired. After the analysis job is submitted, IPA performs a
number of different calculations on the dataset, including the
prediction algorithms, and produces an analysis result. This
result can be viewed within IPA and it displays conclusions in
a variety of ways, depending on the algorithm.

URA is always executed as part of IPA’s dataset analysis,
and there are no options to choose before running the analysis.
The results are displayed in a table in which each row shows

information about a particular regulator and the molecules in
the dataset that the regulator targets (see example in Fig. 4).
Columns for predicted state, Z—score, and P—value enable users
to identify regulators of interest. The table can be sorted and
ﬁltered, and toolbar operations support the creation of network
diagrams and lists based on items in the table.

The MN algorithm is run upon the regulators from the URA
results, and generated networks are accessible from the
‘Mechanistic Network’ column to the far right in the upstream
regulator table. The column displays the number of dataset mol-
ecules targeted by the network followed in parenthesis by the
number of regulators in the network. Clicking on the link in
this column will display the corresponding network (see example
in Fig. 5).

Unlike URA, the MN algorithm can be inﬂuenced by a var-
iety of parameters. When the analysis is initially run, default
values are used for these settings. After the initial run of the
analysis, the user can re—run the algorithm with different values
for P—value and Z—score cut offs, included relationship types, and
parameters that control the shapes of the resulting networks.
When the algorithm re—executes, the new mechanistic networks
will replace the old ones in the result table.

Like the other prediction features, the CNA executes as part
of a dataset analysis in IPA. Because of the large number of
hypothesis networks that are typically returned, the CNA tool
provides a means to automatically annotate each hypothesis for
its connection to a particular biological concept such as a disease,

Fig. 6. DEA results for example (2) in Section 5.2 (TNF-stimulated HUVEC cells). The visualization is a TreeMap (hierarchical heatmap) where the
major boxes represent a family (or category) of related functions. Each individual colored rectangle is a particular biological function or disease and the
color orange indicates its predicted state: increasing (orange), or decreasing (blue). Darker colors indicate higher absolute Z—scores. In this default view,
the size of the rectangles is correlated with increasing overlap signiﬁcance (using FET P—value). The image has been cropped for better readability

phenotype, biological process, compound or gene. If the user
enters such a concept into the tool, then after the hypotheses
are created, IPA evaluates whether there are known relationships
in the Ingenuity Knowledge Base between the root regulator of
each hypothesis and that concept.

The results of DEA are displayed in a tree map (Shneiderman
6t al.,l992) (see Fig. 6 as an example) which clusters related
functions together, thus providing a high-level view of the
function families. The organization makes it easier to see cases
where related functions are predicted to increase/decrease most
signiﬁcantly as a group. The user can then drill down to speciﬁc
functions to see the predictions at a more granular level.

5 BIOLOGICAL RESULTS FOR EXAMPLE USE
CASES

5.1 Upstream Regulator Analysis and Mechanistic
Networks

One means to validate the effectiveness of the URA is to test its
predictive capabilities using datasets derived from cells treated
with a deﬁned upstream stimulus. To this end, we retrieved from
GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) relevant gene-expres-
sion datasets which had not been curated by Ingenuity:

(1) MCF—7 human breast cancer cells exposed to beta-estra-
diol, a well-known agonist of the alpha and beta estrogen
receptors (the transcription factors ESRl and ESR2 in
humans). Retrieved from GSE11352 (Lin 6t 01., 2007).

(2) Primary human endothelial cells (HUVEC) stimulated
with the cytokine TNF. Retrieved from GSE2639
(Viemann 6t 01., 2006).

The raw microarray data ﬁles were processed through an auto-
mated feature extraction and normalization pipeline developed at

Ingenuity Systems (and based on R/Bioconductor), and
signiﬁcantly differentially expressed genes were uploaded and ana-
lyzed in IPA. The three top-most predicted activated upstream
regulators by Z—score for the dataset involving beta-estradiol trea-
ted cells are beta-estradiol itself, the more general parent com-
pound estrogen, and the estrogen receptor (ESRl). A
mechanistic network generated for beta-estradiol in this analysis
(see Fig. 5) shows that it may exert its effects on the observed gene
expression by interacting with ESRl (as expected) and also through
co-activators and other regulatory molecules. The set of 11 regula-
tors plus beta-estradiol in total connects to 320 dataset genes.

The three top-most predicted inhibited upstream regulators
(by negative Z—score, data not shown) are tretinoin, fulvestrant
and 3-deazaneplanocin. Compounds like these that are predicted
to be ‘inhibited’ produce expression patterns in the dataset
partially or completely opposite to the effect observed in the
literature. This can imply therapeutic utility for these com-
pounds, by potentially reversing a phenotype observed in the
disease state. Indeed, fulvestrant is a known selective estrogen
receptor down-regulator approved for treatment of hormone re-
ceptor positive metastatic breast cancer. Tretinoin is the active
metabolite of vitamin A (also known as all-trans retinoic acid)
and is an RXR agonist that has been shown to inhibit the pro-
liferation of MCF-7 cells and is indicated for certain cancers
(Arteaga 6t 01., 2013; Wang 6t 01., 2000; Zhu 6t 01., 1997). It
may affect proliferation in MCF-7 cells by interfering with the
estrogen receptor’s ability to activate its downstream target genes
(Ombra 61101., 2013) or through other means (Muller 6t 01., 2002).
3-deazaneplanocin A (also known as DZNep) affects histone
methylation and recent work suggests it might have therapeutic
value for breast cancer (Hayden 6t 01., 2011).

In the second example of the HUVEC cells treated with the
cytokine TNF, the top-predicted activated regulators are
TNF itself, followed by lipopolysaccharide, NF -/cB complex,

IFNG and poly rIer-RNA. Several of these regulators initi-
ate an inﬂammatory response much like TNF does (i.e. lipopoly-
saccharide and poly rIer-RNA), and NF-KB is the key
downstream transcription factor activated when TNF activates
its receptor. To further validate the algorithm, we retrieved nine
additional gene-expression datasets from GEO all derived from
mammalian cells directly exposed to TNF. The 10 datasets in
total come from human, mouse, rat and cow, and include a
variety of cell types such as ﬁbroblasts, epithelial cells and mono-
cytes, and are from several technology platforms including
Affymetrix, Agilent and Illumina (RNA-Seq). In eight of 10 of
these datasets, IPA predicted TNF as the top-activated regulator,
and ranked it second and third in the other two datasets (see
Supplementary Tables). This high level of consistency lends sup-
port to the premise that the URA has predictive power across
mammalian cell types and species, and is independent of expres-
sion measurement technology.

5.2 Downstream Effects Analysis

To highlight the utility of DEA we examined its predictions for
the HUVEC cells treated with TNF. As shown in Figure 6, a large
number or biological processes are predicted to be increased by
TNF, especially those in the ‘Hematological System Development
and Function’, ‘Cellular Movement’, ‘Immune cell Trafﬁcking’,
‘Cell-to-Cell Signaling and Interaction’ and ‘Inﬂammatory
Response’ categories. Examples of speciﬁc increased function
among those categories are ‘leukocyte migration’ (Z—score
5.006), ‘inﬂammatory response’ (Z—score 4.578) and ‘quantity of
T lymphocytes’ (Z—score 3.934). Increases in these types of biolo-
gical functions are expected for TNF.

5.3 Causal Network Analysis

The power of CNA is its ability to detect novel master upstream
regulators that operate though other regulators, especially in
cases where few or no relationships exist directly between it
and the dataset genes. To highlight this capability we obtained
a gene-expression dataset derived from a mouse model of anky-
losing spondylitis (Haynes 6t 01., 2012). This disease is character-
ized by initial inﬂammation that progresses to osteoproliferation
leading to inappropriate bone formation and eventually joint

fusion. The pathology can be produced in mouse by injecting
human cartilage proteoglycan extract several times over a
12-week period by which time inﬂammation leads to bone
overgrowth in the spine.

The authors sought to ﬁnd evidence in the expression data that
the Wnt signaling system was perturbed. By using RT-PCR and
immunohistochemistry they were able to show that the Wnt
pathway inhibitory molecules DKKl and SOST were slightly
reduced in concentration both at the mRNA and protein levels
in the spinal tissue. Using CNA in IPA with the authors’ micro-
array-based mRNA expression data as input, we found that
SOST was predicted to be signiﬁcantly inhibited with a Z—score
of —1.96, with a network depth of 3, meaning that some paths
from SOST to the dataset molecules involve three distinct ‘hops’
(with two intervening regulators), such as the path SOST —>
Smad —> EGFR —> LCN2 as shown in Figure 7. The gene for
SOST itself was not detectably differentially expressed in this
experiment based on the microarray data, highlighting the sen-
sitivity of the causal analysis.

As a point of interest, the canonical pathway in IPA which
shares the highest overlap with the regulators in this causal net-
work is the pathway called ‘Role of Osteoblasts, Osteoclasts
and Chondrocytes in Rheumatoid Arthritis’, (containing
SOST, the Smad family, SMADl, BMP6, and RUNX2),
indicating the relevance of SOST and its downstream targets
both in bone homeostasis and inﬂammatory disease.

6 DISCUSSION

This article describes algorithms, tools and visualizations recently
added to IPA that enable scientists to combine the directional
information encoded in their gene-expression datasets with
knowledge extracted from the literature to infer the underlying
causes of their observed transcriptional changes and to predict
likely outcomes. This is a signiﬁcant advance compared to tools
that just look for statistical enrichment in overlap to sets of
genes. An aspect of upstream analysis that makes it especially
powerful is that it is essentially an activity-based prediction, in
that the measurement of the activity of a transcriptional regula-
tor is via the measurement of genes known to be differentially
expressed by it in a deﬁned direction. The data being analyzed

Fig. 7. CNA result for SOST (see Section 5.3). SOST is the master regulator (or ‘root’ regulator) of a small causal network containing ﬁve intermediate
regulators that may explain the up and down regulation of the 26 dataset molecules shown in the bottom row (red indicates up-regulation and green
down-regulation). The regulators are colored by their predicted activation state: activated (orange) or inhibited (blue). Darker colors indicate higher
absolute Z—scores. The edges connecting the nodes are colored orange when leading to activation of the downstream node, blue when leading to its
inhibition, and yellow if the ﬁndings underlying the relationship are inconsistent with the state of the downstream node. Pointed arrowheads indicate that
the downstream node is expected to be activated if the upstream node connected to it is activated, while blunt arrowheads indicate that the downstream
node is expected to be inhibited if the upstream node that connects to it is activated

has measured that differential expression. This can be contrasted
with for example pathway overlap prediction, where in general
there is no guarantee that the members of the pathway are
differentially expressed upon pathway activation or inhibition.

As described above, the algorithms operate over a large-scale
causal graph assembled from individual literature-supported re-
lationships between molecules, diseases and biological processes
in the Ingenuity Knowledge Base. These relationships are derived
from a myriad of experimental systems in mouse, rat and human.
Though possibly counter-intuitive to mix relationships derived
from a variety of contexts to analyze data from a particular
context, the results are generally valid due to the conserved ac-
tivity of most genes and proteins across tissues and cell types.
That being said, it may be possible in the future to automatically
infer a context based on the expression data and to ﬁlter accord-
ingly to only relevant relationships for a particular analysis.

There are at least 30 papers that have already made use of
these new causal tools in IPA. One of the ﬁrst to use URA
demonstrated how transcription factor activation differs between
mouse, macaque, and swine in response to infection by the 2009
pandemic H1N1 inﬂuenza virus (Go 6t al., 2012). Another used
both URA and DEA to help characterize the mechanisms that
provide breast cancer protection during pregnancy (Meier-Abt
6t al.,2013). There are certain to be additional applications of
these powerful analytics as scientists discover and adopt them
in their research.

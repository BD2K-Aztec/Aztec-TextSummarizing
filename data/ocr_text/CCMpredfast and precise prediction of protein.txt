ABSTRACT

Motivation: Recent breakthroughs in protein residue—residue contact
prediction have made reliable de novo prediction of protein structures
possible. The key was to apply statistical methods that can distinguish
direct couplings between pairs of columns in a multiple sequence
alignment from merely correlated pairs, i.e. to separate direct from
indirect effects. Two classes of such methods exist, either relying on
regularized inversion of the covariance matrix or on pseudo-likelihood
maximization (PLM). Although PLM-based methods offer clearly
higher precision, available tools are not sufficiently optimized and
are written in interpreted languages that introduce additional over-
heads. This impedes the runtime and large-scale contact prediction
for larger protein families, multi-domain proteins and protein—protein
interactions.

Results: Here we introduce CCMpred, our performance-optimized
PLM implementation in C and CUDA C. Using graphics cards in the
price range of current six-core processors, CCMpred can predict
contacts for typical alignments 35—113 times faster and with the
same precision as the most accurate published methods. For users
without a CUDA-capable graphics card, CCMpred can also run in a
CPU mode that is still 4—14 times faster. Thanks to our speed-ups
(http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/speed-up) contacts
for typical protein families can be predicted in 15—603 on a con-
sumer-grade GPU and 1—6min on a six-core CPU.

1 INTRODUCTION

Evolutionary pressure to maintain a stable protein structure
gives rise to correlated mutations between contacting residue
pairs. These correlated mutations can be observed in a multiple
sequence alignment (MSA) of the protein family and can be used
to predict residue—residue contacts. A recent breakthrough

was achieved by applying methods from statistics and statistical
physics that aim at disentangling direct couplings from mere
correlations between MSA columns (Ekeberg et al., 2013;
Kamisetty et al., 2013; Marks et al., 2011; Weigt et al., 2009).
This has resulted in a boost in contact prediction accuracy,
thanks to which it is now possible to reliably predict protein
structures using only sequence information if enough homolo-
gous sequences are available (Hopf et al., 2012; Marks et al.,
2011; Nugent and Jones, 2012). Currently, 30% of Pfam families
meet a reasonable criterion of having three homologous se-
quences per residue in the chain (see Supplementary Section 7
for details).

Modern contact prediction methods differ by their strategy in
the disentangling step: the most accurate class of methods
(Ekeberg et al., 2013; Kamisetty et al., 2013) such as plmDCA
(Ekeberg et al., 2013) and GREMLIN (Kamisetty et al., 2013)
learn the direct couplings as parameters of a Markov random
ﬁeld by maximizing its pseudo-likelihood, which has runtime
complexity of 0(NL2) where N is the number of homologous
sequences in the MSA and L its number of columns. The less
accurate methods based on sparse covariance matrix inversion
such as PSICOV (Jones et al., 2012) or Mean Field Direct
Coupling Analysis use the sequence information only in a pre-
processing step, while the main computation in 0(L3) is inde-
pendent of N. This makes them fast for short alignments (small
L) but slow for large alignments. Whereas most protein families
used for benchmarking so far have been relatively short, in prac-
tice, longer alignments are more relevant, for example, to predict
interdomain or even interprotein contacts (Ovchinnikov et al.,
2014). Still, existing methods would take ~29 CPU years to com-
plete large-scale studies such as the computation of contact
predictions for the 30% of Pfam with sufﬁcient sequence cover-
age (see Supplementary Section 7).

2 RESULTS

CCMpred implements the approach taken in plmDCA
and GREMLIN, which is based on maximizing the pseudo-
likelihood of an Lz-regularized Markov random ﬁeld (see
Supplementary Information for details). After successful opti-
mization, the couplings are ranked by the Frobenius norms of
the pairwise potentials and the average product correction
(Dunn et al., 2008) is applied to compute the ﬁnal score.

As explained in the Supplementary Information, the task of
computing the gradient of the pseudo-likelihood represents an
almost ideal use-case for GPUs, as the computations can be run

We compare the runtimes and precisions of CCMpred with
two other pseudo-likelihood maximization (PLM)-based tools,
plmDCA (plmDCA-symmetric 3, plmDCA-asymmetric 1) and
GREMLIN (version 2.01), and with the covariance matrix in-
version-based tool PSICOV. The recently published F reeContact
(Kajan et al., 2014) software is much faster than PSICOV but
clearly less accurate than plmDCA and GREMLIN and was not
included here.

2.1 Precision

For benchmarking the precision of contact prediction methods,
we use the same set of 150 Pfam families with 21000 sequences
and high-resolution structures (51.94) with identical input
alignments as used in the PSICOV (Jones et al., 2012) method.
We rank the list of predicted contacts and determine the fraction
of physical contacts (Cﬁ distance 5 8 14) when selecting increas-
ing numbers of contacts. Figure 1 shows that CCMpred is
among the top tools.

2.2 Runtimes

For runtime benchmarks, we generated synthetic MSAs with
3000 sequences and 50, 100, ..., 1000 columns (real alignments
show similar speedups but exhibit more variance in their
runtimes—see Supplementary Fig. S4 for details). Because
GPUs and CPUs differ in their numbers of cores, frequency
per core, etc., we attempt to make a fair comparison by compar-
ing runtimes for hardware of similar price. We ran the GPU
version of CCMpred on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 780 Ti, all
CPU-based methods on an Intel Xeon E5—2620 six-core proces-
sor. Alignments with L > 500 were run on a Tesla K40 GPU with
12 GB RAM (gray points).

Figure 2 shows the runtime of the methods for increasing
alignment length. PSICOV is the fastest CPU method for small
L, as its runtime is independent of sequence count. However, for
L 2 150, CCMpred becomes faster than PSICOV for alignments
with typical numbers of sequences (N w 3000). At typical align-
ment lengths of L = 300, the CCMpred GPU code is 35 times
faster than plmDCA, 113 times faster than GREMLIN and 16
times faster than PSICOV. On the same data, our CPU version is
4.3 times faster than plmDCA, 14 times faster than GREMLIN,
8.3 times slower than our GPU code and 2.0 times faster
than PSICOV. For plmDCA and our CPU version, we use

all six cores. PSICOV and GREMLIN do not support multi-
threading and, therefore, ran on a single core. However, even
if implementations with perfect scaling existed (dividing runtimes
by six), GREMLIN would still not be as fast as the CPU version
of CCMpred. Our GPU code would be faster than a parallelized
PSICOV at L> 150, and our CPU code would be faster at
L > 600.

3 CONCLUSION

CCMpred is a fast GPU and CPU implementation of a
top-performing PLM-based contact prediction approach that
runs in a fraction of the time of comparably accurate methods.
The speed increase is particularly important for long proteins
and large-scale applications. Because CCMpred is free and
open-source software, we hope that it also can serve as a basis
for further methods development in this ﬁeld.

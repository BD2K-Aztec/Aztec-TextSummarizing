Abstract

Summary: We introduce here a novel acquisition and processing methodology for cross—polarization
based 1D rotating—frame relaxation dispersion NMR experiments. This easy—to—use protocol greatly
facilitates the screening, acquisition, processing and model fitting of large on— and off—resonance R”,
relaxation dispersion NMR datasets in an automated manner for the analysis of chemical exchange
phenomena in biomolecules.

Availability and Implementation: The Amaterasu package including the spreadsheet, Bruker pulse
programs and analysis software is available at vme.moleng.kyoto—u.ac.jp/~moleng_01/

1 Introduction

Protein and nucleic acid functions are central to all cellular proc—
esses. Whereas the function of many biomolecules seems to be ex—
plained by a single static structure, many macromolecules such as
enzymes are highly dynamic and rely on sampling multiple conform-
ations for their function. Accurate characterization of these dynamic
conformations demands methods that can probe energetically
excited minor states in solution. Relaxation dispersion NMR spec—
troscopy (RD NMR) is uniquely suited to probe motion on the bio—
logically important timescale from microseconds to milliseconds, as
highlighted by recent research on protein binding (Sugase et 61].,
2007), enzymatic activity (Boehr et 61]., 2006) and base mispairing
(Kimsey et 61]., 2015).

Relaxation Dispersion NMR facilitates the extraction of struc—
tural (chemical shift, Aw), kinetic (lifetime, 1/kex) and thermo-
dynamic (populations, pi) information about the excited states by
quantifying the broadening of resonance lines caused by the chem—
ical exchange process. R1,, RD resolves motion on the unique time—
scale of several tens of microseconds to milliseconds by screening
the spin—lock power ((01) and/or offset (9) dependence of Rlp, the

relaxation rate of a nucleus in the rotating frame. The state—of—the—
art version of this experiment achieves superior temporal resolution
by probing one resonance at a time using 1D NMR (Korzhnev et 61].,
2005 ); however, it requires the time—consuming acquisition, process—
ing and integration of n “' m free—induction decays (FIDs), where n is
the number of resonances probed and m is the number of variable
spin—lock power ((01) or offset (9) values. Accordingly, even for a
biomolecule as small as an SH3 domain (N 60 amino acids), very
large 1D datasets must be acquired, processed and integrated before
the R1,, values can be fitted to a theoretical model. We considered
that this labor—intensive procedure is limiting the broader applicabil—
ity of this promising approach. Thus, our aim was to develop an effi—
cient methodology to facilitate the investigation of chemical
exchange in biomolecules by R1,, RD.

2 Implementation

We addressed the challenges of R1,, RD NMR by a developing a
pipeline consisting of three modules. In the first, an R1,, RD-specific
spreadsheet automatically calculates acquisition parameters that

vary from one experiment to another. In the second, a novel pulse
program acquires an entire set of 1D RD NMR data (11 resonances "'
m spin—lock power and/or offset values) in a single acquisition run as
a pseudo—2D experiment. This greatly simplifies data acquisition be—
cause only a single experiment has to be set up, instead of a large
series of conventional 1D experiments. In the third, the newly writ-
ten Unix software package Amatemsu (automated 31p analysis—util—

 

ity) processes all data from raw FIDs to the final model-fitted RD
NMR curves.

The ﬂow through our R1,, RD NMR pipeline is illustrated in
Figure 1. First, 1HN and 15N chemical shifts are obtained from
a standard heteronuclear single—quantum coherence (HSQC) experi-
ment. Next, our spreadsheet calculates all experimental parameters
such as spin—lock power values col, the delay C, variable pulse lengths
and offset Q, which are passed to the pulse program as text files (for
experimental details, see Korzhnev et al., 2005). In most proteins,
only a few residues report on chemical exchange; therefore, these
residues are identified first by performing a quick screening experi-
ment in which all resonances are probed by application of a weak
and a strong spin—lock field, col. In the absence of chemical ex—
change, the corresponding peak intensity is equal in both spectra,
whereas a lower intensity in the spectra recorded at weak spin—lock
fields indicates chemical exchange. The resulting pseudo—2D spec—
trum is split into its respective 1D components and passed to
Amaterasu via a simple graphical user interface (Fig. 1).

Amaterasu automatically reads all acquisition parameters and
conducts apodization, zero—filling, Fourier—transform and phase cor-
rection on all FIDs (Chen et al., 2002; Helmus and Jaroniec, 2013).
Next, it performs peak—picking and intensity extraction of all spec—
tra, while recognizing the correct peak on the basis of its a priori
known chemical shift. If the intensity ratio indicates that the reson—
ance exhibits chemical exchange, Amaterasu selects this resonance
for a full experiment; unpromising resonances are discarded to save
acquisition time. Optionally, the program can plot all spectra to
check artifacts introduced due to the automated nature of the ana—
lysis. Next, a full RD experiment is recorded on the resonances

Fig. 1. Analysis of R1,, RD NMR data with Amaterasu. After obtaining chemical
shifts, variable experimental parameters are calculated. A screening experi-
ment then probes all resonances for chemical exchange. Positively screened
resonances are selected for a full experiment, in which the spin-lock power
(01 and/or offset Q are varied between experiments. The resulting data are
automatically processed and fitted to a theoretical model by Amaterasu.
Example RD curves for on- and off-resonance experiments on the p62 UBA
domain are shown; yellow indicates experimental steps; green indicates
steps automated by our pipeline

identified in the screening step. This experiment is again recorded as
a single pseudo—2D experiment, while the spin—lock power col and/or
offset Q values are varied between experiments. Raw data are then
integrated by Amaterasu, and peak intensities as a function of col
and/or Q are directly passed to the fitting program GLOVE (Sugase
et al., 2013), which fits the experimental data to a theoretical model.
For a standard dataset, a single run of Amaterasu from reading the
raw FIDs to output of the model—fitted RD NMR curves finishes in
<1 min on a standard desktop PC (e.g. Mac mini, 2015).

3 Results and conclusion

We tested the performance of Amaterasu on 3 NMR samples: the
UBA domain of p62, superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and ubiquitin.
HSQC cross—peaks were picked and passed to our spreadsheet for
calculation of the variable acquisition parameters (Fig. 1). Screening
experiments identified 33 (p62), 37 (SOD1) and 6 (ubiquitin) reson—
ances with a (weak/strong spin—lock) intensity ratio below a thresh—
old of 0.95. As a specific example, analysis of p62 is discussed.
Visual inspection of the spectral plots generated by Amaterasu re—
vealed 2 resonances for which the analysis was deemed difficult due
to resonance overlap. Accordingly, the remaining resonances were
selected for a full R1,, RD experiment in which 23 spin-lock power
values col ranging from 25 to 2000 Hz on—resonance (9:0) were
applied. The resulting FIDs were integrated by Amaterasu and fitted
to a two—site exchange model (Miloushev and Palmer, 2005),
thereby yielding residue—specific values of kex, A0) and [913. We also
performed off-resonance R1,, RD experiments with spin—lock offset
Q values ranging from —1000 to +1000 Hz and performed data fit—
ting. Example RD curves are shown in Figure 1.

In conclusion, we have shown that our novel Amaterasu method—
ology greatly facilitates both the identification of those residues that
report on chemical exchange phenomena in biomolecules and the
thorough analysis of these site—specific probes by efficient quantifi-
cation of on— and off—resonance R1,, RD datasets. We anticipate that
future R1,, RD experiments in conjunction with Amaterasu will shed
new light on the dynamic character of biomolecules beyond their
ground-state structure.

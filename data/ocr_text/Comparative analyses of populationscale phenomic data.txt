Abstract

Motivation: Underrepresentation of racial groups represents an important challenge and major
gap in phenomics research. Most of the current human phenomics research is based primarily on
European populations; hence it is an important challenge to expand it to consider other population
groups. One approach is to utilize data from EMR databases that contain patient data from diverse
demographics and ancestries. The implications of this racial underrepresentation of data can be
profound regarding effects on the healthcare delivery and actionability. To the best of our know—
ledge, our work is the first attempt to perform comparative, population—scale analyses of disease
networks across three different populations, namely Caucasian (EA), African American (AA) and
Hispanic/Latino (HL).

Results: We compared susceptibility profiles and temporal connectivity patterns for 1988 diseases
and 37 282 disease pairs represented in a clinical population of 1 025 573 patients. Accordingly, we
revealed appreciable differences in disease susceptibility, temporal patterns, network structure and
underlying disease connections between EA, AA and HL populations. We found 2158 significantly
comorbid diseases for the EA cohort, 3265 for AA and 672 for HL. We further outlined key disease
pair associations unique to each population as well as categorical enrichments of these pairs.
Finally, we identified 51 key ‘hub’ diseases that are the focal points in the race—centric networks and
of particular clinical importance. Incorporating race—specific disease comorbidity patterns will pro—
duce a more accurate and complete picture of the disease landscape overall and could support
more precise understanding of disease relationships and patient management towards improved
clinical outcomes.

(EMR) have emerged as a powerful modality for understanding the
complexity of disease relationships (Jensen et al., 2012; Shameer
et al., 2014). Incorporating findings from disease networks has been
used to inform disease repurposing (Dudley et al., 2011c), develop
therapeutics (Schadt et al., 2009) and improve patient safety
(Stewart et al., 2007). Phenomics (Bilder et al., 2009) aim to map
and understand the system of phenotypes and their interactions—
where in clinical studies a phenotype can include a trait (e.g. height),
lab test (e.g. cholesterol levels) or disease (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis).
The catalog of phenome—wide associations, which evaluate phe—
nomic correlations of genotypes, is rapidly growing and currently
being leveraged for drug development and drug repositioning
(Denny et al., 2010; Hall et al., 2014; Namjou et al., 2014). We re—
cently used EMR—wide phenomic information to identify: shared
genetic architectures of various diseases (Glicksberg et al., 2015; Li
et al., 2014; Suthram et al., 2010), sub—types of type—2 diabetes (Li
et al., 2015a), drug repurposing for various indications (Dudley
et al., 2011a; Shameer et al., 2015), disease progression patterns
through data stream visualization (Badgeley et al., 2016; Shameer
et al., 2016), disease risk estimations (Nead et al., 2016), and
genomics-informed, personalized therapy (Dudley et al., 2011b,
2015

Similar to the current situation in genomics research, racial
groups and related factors remain understudied in phenomics. Most
of the current human phenomics research is based primarily on
populations of European background. Thus, compiling and analyz-
ing data from EMR databases that contains patient data from di—
verse demographics and racial groups remains a priority. It is clear
that racial background represents an overt source of variability in
disease risk and mortality (Trepka et al., 2015). Traditionally, clin-
icians are required to ‘bridge the inferential gap’, or make clinical
decisions for one racial group based on data from another, due to
lack of knowledge. Accordingly, the implications of this racial
underrepresentation of data can be profound with regard to health—
care delivery and actionability. For example, a previous study found
that African American women were twice as likely, and Hispanic
women were 50% as likely, to be readmitted to the hospital within
30 days of vaginal or cesarean delivery, even when controlling for
socioeconomic status (Aseltine et al., 2015). Systematic analysis of
phenomic data represented in a racially and demographically diverse
patient population could reveal precise patterns and further under—
standing of disease relationships, risk and comorbidity.

Previous studies put forth several approaches for the phenomic
study of clinical populations. Blair et al. (2013) utilized data from
the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Databases,
multiple hospitals across the United States, and the population regis—
try of Denmark (11 : 110 million) to discover comorbidity patterns
across complex and Mendelian diseases. This work, however, was
mainly focused comparing certain types of diseases (i.e. Mendelian
and complex diseases) and did not fully investigate the disease space.
Hidalgo et al. (2009) created a more expansive phenotype disease
network (CMS data, 11 = 30 million) that incorporated demographic
factors, such as sex and race into the analytics. The authors revealed
disparate disease patterns and network connectivity that was due to
race, but only between Caucasian and African American popula-
tions. Jensen et al. (2014) extended the field of disease network re—
search by using timescale data to define temporal disease trajectories
in a Danish clinical cohort (n: 6.2 million). The researchers were
successfully able to identify clusters of diseases that consistently
manifested in particular order (i.e. disease trajectories). These trajec—
tories, however, were built specifically on European population data
and may not extend to other racial groups.

These studies, while powerful and pioneering, did not suffi-
ciently address the issue of racial diversity in their disease networks
partially due to limitations of their datasets. As such, a particular
concern is a lack of representation of Mexican Americans and other
Hispanic Americans in healthcare analytics (Lopez—Candales et al.,
2015). As indicated by Hidalgo et al., there is a significant disparity
in network structure between racial populations. However, prior
phenomic studies have not evaluated racially diverse populations in
depth. In the current study, we propose to combine many of the
powerful approaches developed in the previous studies and leverage
a racially diverse hospital population to compare disease network
structure and connectivity between Caucasian, African American
and Hispanic/Latino populations. To the best of our knowledge, our
work is the first attempt to perform comparative, population—scale
analyses of disease networks across three different populations
within the same hospital cohort.

2 Methods

We present a schematic of our study design and approach in
Figure 1.

2.1 Data sources

2.1.1 Clinical cohort

We performed disease—related analyses on patients from the Mount
Sinai Hospital (MSH) located in New York City, NY. The unique
location of MSH engenders a diverse racial patient population. The
Mount Sinai Data Warehouse which houses all the clinical data, cur—
rently has 4 034 924 unique patients (as of February 2015), over 16
million patient visits recorded, over 1.7 billion patient encounters,
and over 46 million International Classification of Diseases (ICD)—9
code cases documented. We performed the following extensive pre-
processing and filtering steps of the clinical data from the EMR.

1. We excluded individuals that did not have a healthcare visit
since 2003, when the EMR was implemented into the MSH
system.

2. We included individuals with a reported sex and age.

3. We only included individuals with self—identiﬁed races of
Caucasian (White) [EA], African American (Black) [AA] or
Hispanic/Latino [HL].

4. For all individuals with recorded death, we excluded individuals
without an age of death. Of these individuals, we used their date
of death as their current age as to not confound subsequent
analyses.

5. In compliance with Protected Health Information (PHI) and
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA),
we censored the ages of individuals <18 or >90 years old to
those limits.

After these filtering steps, a total of 1 025 5 73 individuals remained
for analysis. The mean age within the population is 47.19 i 24.3
years. The population contained 443 816 (43.27%) Males and 581
757 (56.73%) Females. The race breakdown of the population is as
follows: 621 827 (60.63%) EA 223 915 (21.83%) AA and 179 831
(17.53%) HL.

2. 1.2 Disease classification sources

At the time of this analysis, the MSH EMR system used ICD—9 codes
for billing and recording diagnoses. As the ICD—9—CM classification
system is fraught with challenges (Hazlewood, 2003), particularly
when dealing with rare and/or recently discovered diseases, we

Fig. 1. Workflow of the current study. We outline steps taken in our study
from data organization and statistical methodologies to network analytics

utilized a curated ontology of established and documented mappings
for clinical studies. Disease Ontology (Schriml et al., 2012) (DO;
July 15th, 2015 release) is an open—source repository that integrates
phenotype information relating to human diseases.

The Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) has de—
veloped Clinical Classifications Software (CCS) (HCUP Clinical
Classifications Software (CCS) for ICD—9—CM, 2006—2009), which
we used to characterize the individually mapped diseases into
broader categories. In the current study, we used the ‘Single—Level
Diagnosis’ terms for categorization, which has 202 different catego—
ries. For enrichment analyses, we further only kept categories that
contained at least 5 diseases, which left 93 categories. The full list of
diseases, their respective ICD—9 codes, classification categories, as
well as frequencies in our population can be found in the
Supplementary materials. We present the disease frequencies (A)
and category composition (B) in Figure 2.

Diseases

overall and by EA, AA and HL cohorts. We show for B the distribution of the
number of diseases encompassed within each of the 93 used CCS disease
categories

several filtering steps on the raw list of 6545 disease terms to priori—
tize particular diseases of interest best suited for the analysis:

1. We only included diseases that mapped to at least one ICD—9
code.

2. We removed all diseases that were top—level, parent disease cate—
gories (e.g. endocrine system disease).

3. We only kept diseases if there were 210 affected individuals
from each racial group in our cohort.

These filtering steps resulted in a list of 1198 diseases. To assess
connectivity between diseases, we then compiled pairs of diseases
from this list that underwent further curation steps. We filtered
the raw list of all possible 759 528 disease—pair combinations as
following:

4. We kept a disease pair only if there were 210 individuals from
each racial group with both diseases in our cohort.

5. We removed disease pairs in which one disease was a complete
subset of another.

There were 37282 disease pairs remaining after these filtering steps.

2.2 Statistical analyses

2.2. 1 Deriving race-specific disease dynamics

For each disease of interest, we assessed if and to what extent demo—
graphic factors, namely race, play a role in defining morbidity, when
controlling for other potentially associated factors. Specifically, we
ran a logistic regression adjusting for sex, age and race and assessed
if any demographic covariate was significantly associated with dis—
ease risk (Eq. 1).

P(disease|ﬂr race —l— 65 sex —l— 6,, age) (1)

where 6, is categorical piecewise (Caucasian, African American,
Hispanic/Latino), ﬂa is a continuous constant per year and ﬂs is bin—
ary piecewise Female/Male

As such, for each disease we compared the effect of race using
the EA population as a baseline for disease susceptibility.

2.2.2 Disease pair temporal patterns

With the filtered disease pairs compiled, we then sought to deter—
mine whether each disease pair had temporal directionality, or spe—
cifically whether one disease consistently preceded the other. For the
overlapping individuals that are afﬂicted with both diseases in each
pair, we tabulated per patient the ordering of their pathogeneses.
Specifically, we compared the number of patient instances where
one disease preceded the other and vice versa or if they were re—
corded during the same encounter. We took earliest instance record—
ing date for each disease. If one disease more frequently predated
the other, we calculated the cumulative binomial probability that
the precedence occurs significantly more often than by chance (Eq.
2). For each disease pair, we made the assumption that there was a
5 0% chance that one disease can occur before the other.

where n is the number of individuals with both diseases, r is number
of instances where one disease predates the other, p is the probabil—
ity of success (0.5) and q is the probability of failure (0.5 ).

2.2.3 Comorbidity calculation

While one disease may statistically precede another, it does not ne—
cessarily mean they have a direct relationship. Accordingly, for each
disease pair with significant directionality identified by the previous
step, we next determined whether there was significant comorbidity
in the clinical population. Specifically, for each of these 37 282 dis—
ease pairs, we performed a logistic regression estimating the contri-
bution the prior disease (i.e. the ‘predictor’ disease) has for risk of
developing subsequent sequelae (i.e. the ‘response’ disease) (Eq. 3)
for each population separately.

P(disease[response] |ﬂd disease[predictor] —l— 6,, age —l— 65 sex) (3)

where ﬂd is binary Yes/No, 6, is a continuous constant per year, ﬂs is
binary piecewise Female/Male

2.3 Disease network construction and comparative
analytics

Using results from the previous analyses, we generated population—
specific disease networks using the Cytoscape (Shannon et al.,
2003) platform (v3.3.0). These networks are comprised of directed
connections between source and target disease pairs found to be
significant in terms of both temporal directionality and connectiv—
ity for individual race populations, using 6 as edge weight. We
then performed network metric analyses for each population net—
work using the NetworkAnalyzer (Doncheva et al., 2012) plugin
for Cytoscape. Using these generated metric statistics, we com—
pared each population networks to determine network structure
concordance via metrics (e.g. closeness centrality). Specifically, we
performed a one—way analysis of variance (ANOVA) between the
metrics for race—cohort networks. We then performed Tukey HSD
test on significant results to determine which race networks

differed.

2.3.1 Disease hub identification and categorical enrichments

For each population, we identified ‘hubs’ of connectivity, which are
focal points in the network that have many outgoing connections.
We defined hubs as diseases that have at least 10 outgoing disease
connections: specifically, any predictor disease in a pair (i.e. those
that predate the latter) that is significantly connected to at least 10
diseases within a population.

We then evaluated the different composition of the results be—
tween populations using the 93 different categories of diseases. We
first determined whether the identified hub diseases for each popula—
tion were enriched for any of these categories. We then performed
the same analysis on predictor (i.e. earlier) and response (i.e. later)
diseases in the significant disease pairs in each population.
Specifically, for hub, source and target diseases significant for each
population, we performed a one—way Fisher’s exact test comparing
the amount of overlap with diseases of each category.

3 Results

For the current study, we calculated disease connectivity patterns
for a 1198 diseases in a large, ethnically diverse EMR cohort with 3
well—represented populations and compared across race—specific
networks.

3.1 Effect of race on disease susceptibility prediction
Using the EA cohort as a baseline, we first determined how race af—
fects susceptibility of each of the 1198 diseases while controlling for
age and sex factors compared to AA and HL. In total, we found that
a large portion, 968 (81%), of these diseases had some race contri—
bution (Bonferroni corrected P < 4.2 x 10—05) to pathogenesis (Eq.
1). The corresponding trends of race association with disease risk
along with selected examples are displayed in Figure 3.

We found 731 diseases (61%) for which EA and AA individuals
had significantly different risks of affliction, 369 of which were not
associated with the HL population. Effect sizes, in terms of 6,
ranged from —3.70 to 4.12 with positive values indicating increased
risk for AA individuals and vice versa. Our data suggests that the
AA population is more susceptible to disease acquisition overall: out
of the significant associations a large proportion, 580 (79%), were
positively associated with AA.

Compared to the AA population, there were fewer diseases sig—
nificantly associated with altered risk profiles for HL individuals.
Only 599 (30%) of the diseases were associated with HL cohort and
237 of which were not associated with AA risk. The effect sizes
ranged from —3.55 to 2.66, with a fewer number of diseases, 182
(30%), at increased prevalence in HL which is the opposite of the
trend for the AA population.

3.2 Directionality of race—specific temporal disease pairs
We first determined (Eq. 2) which of the 37 282 disease pairs had
significant temporal directionality (i.e. a pair in which one disease
significantly precedes the other) for EA, AA and HL populations
separately (P < 1.42 x 10—06). For EA, we found 2333 (6.61%) sig—
nificant temporally related disease pairs, 3311 (9.38%) for AA and
691 (1.96%) for HL. In total, across all population, we found 6336
(5.99%) disease pairs that were significantly related temporally.

3.3 Race—specific disease pair connectivity patterns

Within each population, for each disease pair that we determined to
have significant directionality, we then evaluated (Eq. 3.) whether
and to what extent they were connected (P < 1.42 x 10—06).

Fig. 3. Disease susceptibility profiles based on racial group. We present here
the distribution of diseases (with highlighted examples) that have statistically
significant (Bonferroni corrected P< 4.2 x 10’05) differences in risk profiles
for AA and HL cohorts compared to EA. The race beta values refer to effect
size of race when controlling for age and sex with positive values indicating
increased risk compared to EA and vice versa

We present the relative distribution of significant disease pairs be—
tween each population in Figure 4. We also highlight select pairs
unique to each race in Table 1.

We further determined the relative timescale of the latencies be—
tween disease pairs across all populations. Specifically, for all sig-
nificantly comorbid disease pairs common among all racial groups
(n = 464), we determined the average latency from the pathogenesis
of the first disease to developing the latter within each racial group.
The average latency between diseases was 1.67 i 0.62 years for EA,
2.35 i 0.94 years for AA and 1.75 i 0.76 years for HL.

3.4 Race—specific network dynamics

Using the results from the previous sections, we generated unique
disease networks for each race cohort as displayed in Figure 5A/B/C.
In addition to the varying disease patterns across the cohorts, there
were also significant differences in the composition of the networks,
which we show in Table 2. Full descriptions of these metrics can be
found in the documentation for the Cytoscape NetworkAnalyzer
package.

3.5 Population—specific disease hubs

In total, across all populations, we identified 51 unique diseases that
were hubs. Many of these hubs were so in multiple populations with
9 being hubs in all 3 populations. We found 7 diseases that were
hubs only in the EA population, 24 only in AA population and none
that were unique to the HL population. We present the sub—network
of hub diseases significant to each population, along with their first
neighbor connections in Figure 5D.

3.6 Disease categorical enrichment of connectivity
results between populations

From our network connectivity results, we determined whether hub,
source (i.e. predictor) and target (i.e. response) diseases significant to
each population were enriched for any of the 93 disease categories.

 

AA

Fig. 4. Distribution of significantly connected disease pairs by racial cohort.
We show the amount of disease pairs that were significantly temporally
related and comorbid for all racial groups (P< 1.42 x 10’06 criteria for both)

3.6.1 Hub disease categorical enrichment
In total, we found 14 nominally significant (p < 0.05) disease
category—hub enrichments. The hubs of all 3 cohorts were most
highly enriched for ‘Diabetes mellitus with complications’ (EA:
P: 7.0 x 10—04, odds ratio :23.42; AA: P: 8.0 x 10—04,
OR=28.2; HL: P: 7.0 x 10—03, OR: 84.9).

Furthermore, the EA hubs were enriched for ‘Mood disorders’
(P = 0.01, OR = 18.72), ‘Esophageal disorders’ (P = 0.01,
OR = 18.7) and ‘Thyroid disorders’ (P = 0.04, OR = 7.7). While the
AA hubs were similarly enriched for ‘Mood disorders’ (P=0.03,
OR = 11.0) and ‘Esophageal disorders’ (P = 0.03, OR = 11.0), they
were also enriched for ‘Asthma disorders’ (P=0.01, OR=11.0),
‘Allergic reactions’ (P = 0.03, OR = 9.1), ‘Anxiety disorders’
(P = 0.03, OR = 9.1) and ‘Other gastrointestinal disorders’
(P = 0.04, OR = 7.8). The HL hubs only were enriched for ‘Asthma
disorders’ (P = 0.04, OR = 37.1) and ‘Complications of surgical pro—
cedures or medical care’ (P = 0.04, OR = 37.1).

3.6.2 Source disease categorical enrichment
Next, we determined categorical enrichment for source diseases in
significant pairs in each race population. Within the EA disease net—
work, there were 136 significant source diseases, 144 for AA and 33
for HL. The source diseases of each race were significantly enriched
for ‘Diabetes mellitus with complications’ (EA: P = 0.02, odds
ratio: 8.0; AA: P: 0.02, OR: 15.1; HL: P:4.0 x 10—04,
OR=38.9) and ‘Mood disorders’ (EA: P=0.04, odds ratio:6.0;
AA: P:5.0 x 10—03, OR: 10.1; HL: P: 6.0 x 10—04, 0R:29.2).
For the EA cohort, source diseases were also enriched for
‘Diseases of white blood cells’ (P=0.02, OR:8.0), ‘Esophageal
disorders’ (P: 0.04, OR: 6.0) and ‘Thyroid disorders’ (P = 0.02,
OR:4.5). The source diseases of the AA population were likewise
enriched for ‘Thyroid disorders’ (P:3.4 x 10—03, OR=5.8) but
also for ‘Epilepsy/Convulsions’ (P = 5.0 X 10TO3, OR = 10.1),
‘Mycoses’ (P = 0.04, OR = 3.15) and ‘Pulmonary heart diseases’
(P : 0.01, OR : 11.3). Like the EA cohort, HL source diseases were
enriched for ‘Esophageal disorders’ (P = 0.01, OR = 15.0).
Additionally, we found enrichment for ‘Asthma diseases’ (P = 7.0 X
10TO3, OR = 25.1) and ‘Other inﬂammatory skin conditions’
(P = 0.04, OR = 7.5).

For each population, we determined which temporally related disease pairs had Bonferroni-corrected signiﬁcant connectivity (P < 1.42 x 10TO6). We present

particular disease pairs of interest from among the top-25 associations for each population, ranked by effect size. Effect size, or [3, can be interpreted as the odds

ratio of disease 2 occurring given disease 1, holding age and sex constant.

3.6.3 Target disease categorical enrichment

Finally, we analyzed categorical enrichment of target diseases,
which are the direct connections from source diseases. Overall there
were more target diseases than source: 319 target diseases for EA,
454 for AA and 178 for HL. The only disease category significantly
enriched in target diseases of all races was ‘Mycoses’ (EA: P = 7.0 X
10—04, odds ratio=23.42; AA: P: 8.0 x 10—04, OR=28.2; HL:
P : 7.0 x 10‘“, OR : 84.9).

We found that ‘Diseases of white blood cells’ (P 24.5 X 10‘”,
OR = 5.6) and ‘Retinal detachments/defects/vascular occlusions/reti—
nopathies’ (P: 0.01, OR:2.7) were the only other categories en—
riched for EA target diseases. For AA, we discovered that ‘Retinal
detachments/defects/vascular occlusions/retinopathies’ (P = 3.0 X
10TO4, OR:4.6) was also significantly enriched along with
‘Cataract diseases’ (P = 0.03, OR: 8.4) ‘Glaucoma diseases’
(P: 7.0 X 10TO3, OR:6.8) and ‘Other diseases of kidney and ur—
eters’ (P = 0.02, OR 24.5). The HL population had a similar target
disease enrichment profile to AA with categorical enrichments of
‘Cataract diseases’ (P=4.5 >< 10TOZ, OR:5.8), ‘Glaucoma dis—
eases’ (P : 8.8 X 10‘03, OR = 5.9). The HL cohort also had enrich-
ments in ‘Diabetes mellitus with complications’ (P=4.5 >< 10TOZ,
OR:5.8), ‘Gastritis and duodenitis’ (P: 0.03, OR: 8.8) and
‘Hypertension with complications and secondary hypertension’
(P = 0.01, OR = 7.9).

4 Discussion

The results from the current study provide illustrative examples of
the extent disease susceptibility and connectivity patterns differ be—
tween race cohorts, formalizing the need for race—specific risk assess—
ment. Overall, the cross—race individual disease profiles are
consistent with known data and expectations (Fig. 3), which is im-
portant for implications that can inform follow—up studies.

More importantly, our results are in line with findings from
related studies. In particular, our findings for the disease temporal
patters in the EA cohort are consistent with the disease trajectories
identified by Jensen et al. (2014). Direct comparison of results be—
tween our study and theirs is difficult, however, namely due to use
of non—identical statistical methodologies and ontological disease

mappings (ICD—9 versus ICD—10). Regardless, several similarities
are apparent: firstly, the raw number of disease pairs with significant
temporal directionality is consistent between the two studies: there
were 4014 disease pairs with significant temporal directionality in
their study and 2333 in ours; the small difference of which can par-
tially be explained by sample size discrepancies. Furthermore, the
authors identified related clusters of trajectories that are akin to
hubs of the current study. While there are discrepancies, many focal
disease points overlap: Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), for instance, was
involved in many trajectories in their study and was a central hub in
our EA cohort with 101 Bonferroni—corrected sequellae. Outcome
diseases in the Jensen et al. T2D network included ‘retinal disorder’
which corresponds to many target diseases found in ours, including
dry—eye syndrome, retinal drusen, peripheral retinal degeneration,
and retinal edema. ‘Chronic renal failure’ and ‘Unspecified renal
failure’ were also outcome diseases, which overlap with target dis—
eases such as impaired renal function disease, benign hypertensive
renal disease and secondary hyperparathyroidism of renal origin
found in our network. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, an—
other cluster disease, was found to have similar temporal patterns as
well, including ‘Angina’ as a predictor disease (angina pectoris in
our results) and ‘Unspecified chronic bronchitis’ as an outcome dis—
ease (bronchitis in ours).

Comparing our results to those of the Hidalgo et al. study using
network approaches to study human phenotype serves as a source to
validate our AA and EA networks. In their study, they found certain
disease combinations that were differentially comorbid in black
(AA) and white (EA) populations, many of which are validated in
our findings. They demonstrate that heart diseases, including ‘mitral
valve disorders’ and ‘mitral and aortic valve stenosis’ were more
comorbid in white males than black males. Similarly, we found both
aortic valve disease and mitral valve disease to be hubs in only the
EA network. Interestingly, they show that ‘other peripheral vascular
disease’ was connected to diseases across networks for both races
and we also identified that the same disease is a hub for both these
populations. Hidalgo et al. further demonstrate that ‘diabetes’ and
‘hypertension’ were more comorbid in black males than white
males. While, in our study, both diseases were found to be hubs for
both EA and AA networks, they were more highly connected (dia—
betes mellitus: 102 connections for EA versus 187 for AA and

We determined signiﬁcant differences (italicized) in network structure across EA, AA and HL networks using a one-ANOVA to compare average metric statistics for

race-cohort networks (P < 0.05). We then performed Tukey HSD test on signiﬁcant results to determine speciﬁcally which races differed from one another (P < 0.05).

hypertension: 233 connections for EA versus 377 for AA) in our AA
cohort than the EA network. ‘Respiratory abnormality’ was also
more comorbid for black males in their study, which can be seen as
corresponding to asthma—related disorder categorical enrichments in
our identified AA hubs. Taken together, the concordance of results
between these two studies and ours is extremely encouraging and
provides support for the methodologies employed in the current
paper and the ensuing HL cohort network discovery.

4.1 Race—centric disease connectivity and network
composition disparities

As shown in Table 2, there are noticeable differences between the
disease networks, not only between EA and AA or HL but also be—
tween AA and HL. Metric differences in average clustering coeffi—
cient and eccentricity (which reﬂects maximum length between one
node and its connections) between all races reaffirms that disease
patterns vary considerably in different racial backgrounds, despite
population size. Significant differences between AA and HL network
composition emphasizes that it is not enough to merely compare EA
versus ‘other’ races: disease networks of each racial group requires
substantial, individualized investigation.

Another interesting component of comparative analyses of these
three networks is the identification of what diseases are common
sequelae for each race. We reveal categories of diseases that are en—
riched only for the HL population. Of particular interest is ‘gastritis
and duodenitis’ which is known to have higher incidence in
Hispanic populations, which could possibly be due to increased
rates of H. pylori infection (Dehesa et al., 1991). As gastritis can
lead to gastric carcinoma, the diseases that predate it can serve as
early warning signs.

4.2 Impact on healthcare delivery

Identifying diseases that are hubs within a network, especially those
that are specific to certain racial groups, can highlight focal areas
that warrant particular clinical attention. We show that while dis—
eases may be abundant in multiple populations (Fig. 5D), some dis—
eases are hubs only for certain populations. It is clear that the AA
population has the most hub diseases both overall and unique to the
population, which reﬂects an increased disease burden.

We found, for example, that Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is a hub dis—
ease for only the AA cohort, although there were some interesting
associations in the other populations (e.g. T1D to Clostridium diffi-
cile colitis in HL). There has been thorough and extensive research
on the impact of T1D on the AA population and which has shown
that the AA population indeed has higher incidence rates (Mayer—
David et al., 2009). Results from our hub analysis can extend be—
yond the simple observation of increased T1D risk in AA to actually

illuminate the subsequent disease pathogeneses specific to AA
including many eye—related diseases, such as background diabetic
retinopathy, blindness, borderline glaucoma, dry eye syndrome, ret—
inal edema and senile cataract. Knowledge of these associations can
be passed along to patients in this group so they can be aware of
increased risk for such complications. Furthermore, there are several
AA—specific disease hubs that are not as well established in the litera—
ture: diaper rash, constipation and diarrhea are all seemingly mild
conditions but, as we show, can lead to a number of disorders, par—
ticularly in the AA population.

Findings from these network analytics can suggest clinical prac—
tice considerations. The AA network, for example, has significantly
higher local interconnectivity scores (e.g. clustering coefficient,
neighborhood connectivity) compared to both EA and HL.
Furthermore, we have shown that AA individuals have, on average,
relatively longer latencies between disease comorbidity onsets.
While one could interpret the longer latencies between diseases to
slower progression or attribute them to less frequent patient Visits,
these findings nonetheless could inform clinical treatment strategies:
if an AA patient is diagnosed with a highly interconnected disease,
such as Hepatitis C, the clinician might strongly urge proximate
follow—up Visits for active screening of comorbid diseases and con—
sideration of preventative or prophylactic treatment. Similar prac—
tices are already implemented in the clinic for certain diseases: the
2016 American Diabetes Association Guidelines (American
Diabetes Association, 2016) recommend recurrent T2D screening
Visits for individuals who have hypertension and/or are of a ‘high-
risk race/ethnicity’, even if they are completely asymptomatic.

The HL network, on the other hand, consistently has lower
scores relating to connectivity and clustering (e.g. clustering coeffi—
cient, in—degree, neighborhood connectivity and stress). While this
pattern may reﬂect a unique, sparser phenotypic landscape and
lower overall disease burden, it may serve as a reminder of clinical
underrepresentation and the need for community outreach (see:
‘Limitations’).

4.3 Limitations

An obvious limitation of the current study is the respective size of
the HL population in our analysis. Although the AA cohort was not
much larger (21.8% versus 17.5%), it is clear that the AA popula—
tion was more represented in the disease space (Fig. 2). Another
limitation is the type of information available in the EMR data. Our
results highlight differences in population disease risk patterns, that
in some cases are likely indicative of other potentially confounding
factors not captured in the EMR data, such as language barriers, ac—
cess to healthcare or important environmental or socioeconomic
factors.

Another possible reason for the sparser HL disease network
could be due to a higher heterogeneity of the underlying HL popula-
tion structure. Studies have indeed shown that while Hispanic/
Latino populations are traditionally combined into a single ethnic
group (as in the current study), there is extensive diversity in terms
of cultural backgrounds and genetic ancestry (Gonzalez et al.,
2005), which might be masking associations in our networks.

4.4 Future directions

The discovery of unique disease sequelae between race populations
is a promising start, but it reveals how much more has to be done to
generate a broader understanding of disease susceptibility patterns
across diverse populations. An obvious, urgent need is to introduce
and incorporate data from population groups that are almost com—
pletely absent in phenomics space, such as Native Americans and
Pacific Islanders. As illustrated by the aforementioned example of
HL population diversity, there is a clear need to better stratify po—
tentially overgeneralized cohorts. This can be facilitated by
increased sample sizes, more accurate demographic reporting in the
EMR and incorporating genetic ancestry.

Many other population—scale factors would be important to
compare across race—centric disease networks. One particular direc—
tion warranting further investigation is an examination of the laten—
cies between disease pairs across populations beyond overall
average. Accordingly, by including encounter information and Visit
frequency, we might be able to identify factors underlying racial
group latency discrepancies for each particular pair of comorbid dis—
eases, which may help inform clinical practices.

Furthermore, researchers (Patel et al., 2015) recently demon—
strated intricate links between socioeconomic factors, health out—
comes and disease risk. Environment—Wide Association Studies
(EWAS) (Patel et al., 2010) have shown the dynamic relationship be—
tween disease risk, environmental exposures and genetic profiles.
Combining phenomics, subtleties of phenocopies, disease genetics
and environmental exposures by zip code within the current dataset
can bring us further towards a framework for establishing stratified
precise comorbidity networks for personalized medicine.

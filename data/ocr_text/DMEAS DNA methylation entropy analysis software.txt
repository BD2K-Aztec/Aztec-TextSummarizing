ABSTRACT

Summary: DMEAS is the first user-friendly tool dedicated to analyze
the distribution of DNA methylation patterns for the quantification of
epigenetic heterogeneity. It supports the analysis of both locus-spe-
cific and genome-wide bisulfite sequencing data. DMEAS progres-
sively scans the mapping results of bisulfite sequencing reads to
extract DNA methylation patterns for contiguous CpG dinucleotides.
It determines the DNA methylation level and calculates methylation
entropy for genomic segments to enable the quantitative assessment
of DNA methylation variations observed in cell populations.
Availability and implementation: DMEAS program, user guide and all
the testing data are freely available from http://sourceforge.net/pro-
jects/dmeas/files/

1 INTRODUCTION

DNA methylation is a crucial epigenetic modiﬁcation involved in
many biological processes, from normal cellular differentiation to
disease genesis and progression. Traditionally, DNA methylation
analysis is limited to the determination and comparison of DNA
methylation levels. A number of computational tools including
BISMA, QDMR, BiQ Analyzer HT and CpG_MPs have been
developed to analyze DNA methylation data derived from
illumina Beadchip or bisulﬁte sequence reads (Lutsik et al.,
2011; Rohde et al., 2010; Su et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2011).
Recently, great interest has been aroused in decoding DNA
methylation patterning to understand the generation of cell diver-
sity. In addition to tracing the cell lineage (Shibata, 2012; Tsai
et al., 2012), DNA methylation patterns can be used as a measure
of the epigenetic heterogeneity in cell populations (Xie et al.,
2011). In particular, with the emergence of next-generation
sequencing techniques, rapidly accumulating deep bisulﬁte
sequencing data allow the securitization of DNA methylation
patterns on genome-wide scale. However, existing DNA methy-
lation analysis tools mainly focus on the bisulﬁte sequencing data
mapping and the comparison at DNA methylation level. No soft-
ware has been developed to assess DNA methylation variations

embedded in bisulﬁte sequencing data. Here, we present DMEAS,
a C# implementation of the algorithm for DNA methylation
entropy calculation (Xie et al., 2011) as an interactive tool to
evaluate the variation in DNA methylation patterns.

2 OVERVIEW OF DMEAS
2.1 Input data

DMEAS offers user-friendly interfaces for researchers to import
the high-throughput methylation sequencing data analyzed with
Bismark software (Krueger and Andrews, 2011). For each se-
quence read, Bismark provides one line annotation for mapping
information including read ID, chromosome ID, genome start
position and methylation calls for cytosines identiﬁed. With such
sequence annotation, DMEAS identiﬁes all possible genomic
segments with at least four contiguous CpG dinucleotides and
records the combination of their methylation statuses. Based on
the mapping result for each segment, the sequence reads covering
the corresponding genomic region will be identiﬁed and
clustered. The DNA methylation pattern will be extracted and
the methylation level/entropy will be determined for visualization
and comparison. DMEAS also takes user-deﬁned locus-speciﬁc
methylation data. For each genomic region, the default input
ﬁle should consist of sample information, locus information
and multiple-line numerical data representing DNA methylation
patterns. More speciﬁcally, DNA methylation statuses are
represented with 0, l or 2 for unmethylated, methylated or
unknown methylation status, respectively. DMEAS processes
lines from input stream to extract DNA methylation patterns
for all possible genomic segments with four contiguous CpG
dinucleotides.

2.2 DNA methylation level and entropy analysis

DNA methylation entropy is calculated as described previously
(Xie et al., 2011). Brieﬂy, for a given genomic segment, the fre-
quency of each distinct DNA methylation pattern observed is
calculated based on all sequence reads mapped to the locus.
Providing the number of CpG sites, the frequencies of all pat-
terns observed and the total number of sequence reads generated
for a given genomic locus, methylation entropy could be deter-
mined with a modiﬁed version of Shannon entropy equation (Xie
et al., 2011). To ensure all 16 possible methylation patterns
would be considered for a given 4-CpG segment, only genomic
segments with :16x coverage will be included in the further
analysis. DNA methylation level of a genomic region with mul-
tiple CpG sites is deﬁned as the percentage of methylated CpG

dinucleotides observed. For each high-throughput bisulﬁte
sequencing dataset, DMEAS provides a descriptive statistical
summary and the distribution plots for methylation level and
entropy. Statistical analyses, including Pearson correlation, etc.,
are provided for pairwise comparisons and/or multi-sample
comparisons. Similar functions have been implemented for the
analysis of locus-speciﬁc methylation data as well.

2.3 Methylation pattern visualization and data output

DMEAS allows users to visualize methylation patterns at the
genomic loci of interest. Heatmap representation is adopted
for graphical displays of DNA methylation pattern. In heatmap
style, red, blue and gray rectangles represent methylated,
unmethylated and unknown methylation status, respectively.
Owing to the large volume of high-throughput data, all sequence
reads are sorted in ascending order according to their genomic
coordinates to facilitate their retrieval later. To achieve a reason-
able resolution, DNA methylation pattern is demonstrated
in lkb window. If no methylation data are found for the lkb
window targeted, DMEAS will automatically search the up-
stream and downstream for the most adjacent genomic region
with methylation data and provide the corresponding genomic
coordinates.

DMEAS also provides user-friendly interfaces to export the
results in a wide variety of ways, including text ﬁle and image
format. The distribution of DNA methylation level or DNA
methylation entropy can be exhibited in either histogram
(Fig. 1A) or line chart styles, and the correlation between

methylation level and entropy is demonstrated in a scatter style
(Fig. 1B). In addition, the methylation level and entropy results
can also be exported directly to tables (Fig. 1C). Together with
the heatmap representation (Fig. 1D), DMEAS generates
the output ﬁle with basic statistical information for selected
samples, such as the number of segments, total number of
reads, total number of CpG sites and average methylation level
and entropy. All the saved images and tables could be used for
further analysis.

3 CONCLUSION

We have successfully developed DMEAS, the ﬁrst software to
enable the analysis of DNA methylation pattern and the quan-
tiﬁcation of epigenetic heterogeneity. For bisulﬁte sequencing
data, locus-speciﬁc or genome-wide, DMEAS can automatically
identify and determine the methylation levels and entropies for
all possible 4-CpG segments. The visualization of DNA methy-
lation pattern of each segment is implemented and the descriptive
statistical summary on segments, including the distributions
of methylation level and entropy, are provided. In addition,
Pearson correlation was adopted to measure the correlation of
the methylation levels and entropies across samples. We antici-
pate it will assist researchers to explore DNA methylation data in
a new dimension.

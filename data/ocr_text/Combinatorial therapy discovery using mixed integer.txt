ABSTRACT

Motivation: Combinatorial therapies play increasingly important roles
in combating complex diseases. Owing to the huge cost associated
with experimental methods in identifying optimal drug combinations,
computational approaches can provide a guide to limit the search
space and reduce cost. However, few computational approaches
have been developed for this purpose, and thus there is a great
need of new algorithms for drug combination prediction.

Results: Here we proposed to formulate the optimal combinatorial
therapy problem into two complementary mathematical algorithms,
Balanced Target Set Cover (BTSC) and Minimum Off-Target Set
Cover (MOTSC). Given a disease gene set, BTSC seeks a balanced
solution that maximizes the coverage on the disease genes and min-
imizes the off-target hits at the same time. MOTSC seeks a full cover-
age on the disease gene set while minimizing the off-target set.
Through simulation, both BTSC and MOTSC demonstrated a much
faster running time over exhaustive search with the same accuracy.
When applied to real disease gene sets, our algorithms not only iden-
tified known drug combinations, but also predicted novel drug com-
binations that are worth further testing. In addition, we developed a
web-based tool to allow users to iteratively search for optimal drug
combinations given a user-defined gene set.

1 INTRODUCTION

Complex diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases and
neurological disorders, usually involve multiple genes whose
protein products play pivotal roles in controlling aberrant path-
ways and networks. In addition, disease pathways and networks
are often redundant and robust to single-point perturbations.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Because most drugs are designed to selectively target speciﬁc
proteins, single-drug treatments usually cannot break down the
whole disease pathways and networks. This is why the traditional
‘one disease, one gene, one drug’ treatment often fails (Hopkins,
2008). Multi-target treatments, especially drug combinations, can
simultaneously target multiple components of the disease path-
ways and networks, thus offering hope for treating such complex
diseases (Jia et al., 2009). There have already been many success-
ful combinatorial therapies to treat complex diseases. For
example, highly active antiretroviral therapy is a potent combin-
ation of at least three active antiretroviral drugs targeting reverse
transcriptase, protease and integrase to keep the HIV Virus from
replicating itself (Lucas et al., 1999). The combination of glybur-
ide and metformin is used to treat type 2 diabetes in complemen-
tary ways (Bokhari et al., 2003). Moduretic is the combination of
amiloride and hydrochlorothiazide that can effectively treat pa-
tients with hypertension (HTN) (Frank, 2008; Wilson et al.,
1988). The combination of anastrozole and fulvestrant is more
effective than individual or sequential usage of both drugs for the
treatment of hormone-receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer
(Mehta et al., 2012).

Despite the increasing successes in using drug combinations
to treat complex diseases, most of them were developed based
on clinical experience or test-and-trial strategy, which is not
only time-consuming but also expensive. High-throughput
screening methods have also been developed to identify effect-
ive pairwise drug combinations (Borisy et al., 2003; Lehar et al.,
2009; Tan et al., 2012). However, a systematic analysis of all the
possible pairwise combinations is both labor-intensive and cost-
ineffective because of the large combinatorial space needed to
explore. Furthermore, most drug combinations may not signiﬁ-
cantly improve the efﬁcacy over individual drugs. Therefore,
large-scale drug combination screening is highly ineffective. In
addition, a systematic screening becomes unfeasible if combin-
ations of more than two drugs are considered. The closed-loop
control (Wong et al., 2008), stack sequential (Calzolari et al.,
2008) and other search algorithms reviewed in Feala et al.
(2010) have been developed together with biological experi-
ments to identify the optimal drug combinations from a huge
drug-dose space. However, given thousands of individual drugs,
careful preselection of a subset of drugs within which to search

Combinatorial therapy optimization

 

for optimal combinations in experimental testing is not an easy
task.

Several systematic computational approaches for predicting
drug combinations have recently been developed and could pro-
vide a guide to limit the search space for experimental methods.
For example, Vazquez (2009) proposed identifying the optimal
drug combinations by searching for the minimal number of
drugs that can target all the cancer cell lines using the highest-
degree-ﬁrst and simulated annealing algorithms. However, this
heuristic search algorithm does not have optimum guarantee,
and the convergence rate for large-scale datasets could be slow.
Wu et al. (2010) integrated a molecular interaction network and
gene expression data of individual drugs to identify subnetworks
affected by individual or combinatorial drugs. The drug effect on
these subnetworks is measured by taking into account both efﬁ-
cacy and side effect and then used to prioritize drug combin-
ations. They successfully identiﬁed effective drug combinations
used to treat type 2 diabetes, but the dependency on the avail-
ability of gene expression data treated with individual and com-
binatorial drugs as well as the high computational cost when
handling the vast combinatorial space makes their approach
unsuitable for large-scale application. Zhao et al. (2011) and
Xu et al. (2012) proposed two similar computational approaches
to prioritize pairwise drug combinations using feature patterns
enriched in the known drug combinations and got some promis-
ing predictions. However, their approaches rely heavily on the
known drug combination data that are of small size, thus biasing
their predictions toward those combinations that are similar to
the known ones. Therefore, the current computational
approaches are limited, and there is a great need to develop
new algorithms for drug combination prediction.

Drug design is usually speciﬁc, but one drug may target mul-
tiple proteins due to promiscuous binding (Paolini et al., 2006;
Yildirim et al., 2007). One protein can be targeted by multiple
drugs as well. The drugs and proteins form an intricate drug—
target network. When used to treat diseases, a drug can affect
both disease on-target proteins for which it was designed and
some off-target proteins that are not related to the diseases.
When different drugs are combined, there could be a large
number of additive off-targets whose effects are undesired.
Thus, given a set of disease genes, the problem of ﬁnding the
optimum drug combinations that maximize on-target coverage
and minimize off-target effects is important and challenging.
This is similar to the efﬁcacy maximization and side effect mini-
mization problem in combinatorial therapy. Also, such off-target
effects in drug combination have not been considered in the sys-
tematic computational studies Wazquez, 2009; Xu et al., 2012;
Zhao et al., 2011), with the exception of the work Wu et al.,
2010).

To address the on-target maximization and off-target mini-
mization problem, we ﬁrst formulated the optimal combinatorial
therapy problem using an optimization framework and solved it
using mixed integer linear programming (MILP). Then, we com-
pared our approach with exhaustive search using simulation and
demonstrated a better performance of our approach over ex-
haustive search. Finally, we demonstrated the good performance
of our approach through searching optimal drug combinations
for six disease gene sets from a drug—target network. Our ap-
proach not only captured the well-known drugs and drug

combinations, but also suggested novel uses for some other
drugs. The drug combinations discovered using our approach
can target the protein products of disease genes with minimal
perturbations to the other proteins and are worthy of further
testing to treat such diseases. To make our approach more ac-
cessible to the general drug discovery community, we developed
a web-based tool to allow users to iteratively search for optimal
drug combinations from a user-deﬁned gene set.

The remaining part of this article is organized as follows: we
ﬁrst describe the optimization approach in Section 2; application
of the approach on both the simulated and real data is presented
in Section 3; and a brief discussion on current issues and poten-
tial future improvements is described in the concluding section of
the article.

2 METHODS
2.1 Drug—target network

We extracted the drug—target interactions from the DrugBank database
(version 3.0) (Knox et al., 2011) and constructed a bipartite network, in
which nodes represent drugs or targets and edges represent drug—target
interactions. We further removed the targets with no human gene symbol
annotation. The remaining network contains 4233 drugs, 2058 target
genes and 9669 drug—target interactions. We also extracted the adverse
drug—drug interaction effects and the drug action information from the
DrugBank database. Given an input disease gene set, drugs with the same
set of targets, actions and interacting drugs were merged into a single
meta-drug, as they are equivalent to our algorithm. Details on drug
data processing are provided in Supplementary Text S1. Unless otherwise
speciﬁed, we used the term drug instead of meta-drug in the remaining
text and the term disease gene to represent the protein product of disease
gene.

2.2 Optimal combinatorial therapy

Given a set of disease genes, we ﬁrst removed those genes that have no
associated drugs in the drug—target network. The remaining set of disease
genes is called on—target set, denoted as T = {t1, t2, .. . , tp}. We then ex-
tracted the drugs associated with the on—target genes from the drug—target
network. The set of off-targets, S 2 {S1, S2, .. . , sq}, is the set of genes that
are connected with the on—target—associated drugs in the drug—target net-
work, but does not overlap with T. Mathematically, the associated drugs
can be formulated as M = {MilMi g TU S, i = 1, 2, ...,m}, where each
drug M ,- can target some disease genes in T and some off-target genes in S
as well. Finding the optimal drug combination for a disease is to maxi-
mize the coverage on T and minimize the overlap with S using a subset of
M. This problem can be deﬁned as follows.

PROBLEM 1.

Balanced Target Set Cover (BTSC) problem. Given a disease
D = (T, S) and a collection of drugs M, ﬁnd a subset C g M and
ICI 5 k that minimize the cost(D, C) = a|T\(UC)| + (1 — a)|S ﬂ (UC)|,
where UC = UCECC, k is the upper bound on the cardinality of the solu-
tion set C and or is the weight balance of the coverage between on-target
set T and off-target set S.

A natural choice of or is 0.5. When at is set to 1, BTSC is equivalent to
the maximum coverage problem. In practice, users may have a small set
of highly conﬁdent drug targets and would require full coverage on these
targets while minimizing the number of off-targets. BTSC cannot be used
directly to solve this problem.

To overcome this limitation, we further propose to fully cover the on-
targets in T and minimize the number of off-targets in S. In other words,

K.Pang et al.

 

we require any selected combination of drugs to cover all the on—target
disease genes. This can be achieved by setting or to 0 and adding a con-
straint of full set cover. Mathematically, the restricted problem can be
deﬁned as follows:

PROBLEM 2.

Minimum Off-Target Set Cover (MOTSC) problem. Given a disease
D = (T, S) and a collection of drugs M, ﬁnd a subset C g M that min-
imizes the cost(D,C) 2 IS (1 (UC)|, where |T ﬂ (UC)| = IT (1 (UM)| and
UC = UCEcc.

2.3 BTSC and MOTSC problems are NP—hard

The NP-hard property of the BTSC problem can be proved through
reduction mapping. By setting or to 1, the maximum coverage problem
becomes ﬁnding a maximum cover on the disease genes in T using at
most k drugs from M. This reduction shows that BTSC is at least as hard
as the maximum coverage problem, which is in the NP-hard problem set
(Cohen and Katzir, 2008).

MOTSC can be Viewed as a modiﬁed version of the Red-Blue Set
Cover, which is also a generalization of the standard set cover problem
(Miettinen, 2009). Red-Blue Set Cover problem is much harder than the
standard set cover problem, and there exists no polynomial approxima-
tion with a factor of 2(410g”)1_6 for any €>0 (Peleg, 2007).

2.4 Mathematical programming formulation
Mathematically, BTSC can be formulated using MILP as follows:

minimize aria — y,) + (1 — or) If y,- (1)
i=1 i=p+1
subject to (Bx),- — y; = 0 (2)
by.- — y:- z o (3)
yi — y;- S 0 (4)
£951 5 k (5)
j=1
(LX) i 1 (6)
y;- e Z+,y,-,xj 6 {0,1} (7)

The formulation has three variables, x, y and y’. The ﬁrst two are
binary, and the last one is nonnegative. The binary solution vector x
indicates which drugs are selected. The nonnegative cost variable y;-
counts the times that the it}, gene is covered by the selected drugs. The
binary cost vector y is derived from y’, y,- = 1 if y; 2 1; otherwise, y,- = 0.
The value of y, indicates whether the it}, gene is covered. We note that in
vectors y and y’, the ﬁrst 1) elements are associated with the on—target
genes and the next q elements are associated with the off-target genes.

The relation between a given disease D and the associated drugs M
can be represented using a binary matrix B, where the rows are indexed
by the on—targets (p) and off-targets (q), and the columns represent the
drugs. Rim 2 1 if the it}, gene in D is covered by the mth drug in M;
otherwise, Rim 2 0. The nonzero elements in the product vector of B
and x indicate the corresponding genes targeted by a selection of drugs.

The drug—drug adverse interaction effects are encoded in L, a l x m
binary matrix where, for each row k, Lki = ij : 1 if the drugs M, and
ill]- have an adverse effect when used together.

The intuition of the MILP formulation is as follows. The equality
constraint (2) counts the number of times that an on-target or an off-
target is covered by the selected drug combination. However, y’ cannot be

directly used in the objective cost function (1). Thus, the binary cost y is
introduced and related to y’ by the inequality constraints (3) and (4). The
inequality constraint (3) requires y,- = 1 if y; 2 1. For that, the value of b
needs to be at least the maximum value of all y;. The inequality constraint
(4) guarantees that y,- = 0 whenever y;- = 0. The maximum number of
drugs for any feasible solution is bounded by the inequality constraint
(5). The inequality constraint (6) guarantees any feasible solution to avoid
the drug—drug adverse effects encoded in L. In this article, we solved
BTSC problem using the GNU Linear Programming Kit package
(http://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/). MOTSC can be formulated simi-
larly (Supplementary Text S2). The dual problems of BTSC and
MOTSC are further discussed in the Supplementary Texts S3 and S4.

2.5 Iterative search and online tool

To make our approach more accessible in practice, we developed a web-
based interactive tool (http://www.drug.liuzlab.org/) that will allow users
to iteratively reﬁne the search results. Both BTSC and MOTSC are im-
plemented with the options to ﬁlter out drugs based on approval status,
drug—drug adverse interaction and drug action direction. In addition, our
web tool can also generate the output result ﬁles for Cytoscape Visual-
ization (Shannon et al., 2003).

3 RESULTS

3.1 Time complexity and accuracy analysis

To evaluate the time complexity and accuracy of our algorithm,
we compared it with exhaustive search (ES) on a simulated
dataset. According to the formulation in Section 2.4, the simu-
lated dataset is controlled by four parameters: (i) the number of
columns in B, which represents the number of drugs associated
with a disease gene set; (ii) the number of rows in B, which
represents the total on—target and off-target space; (iii) the dens-
ity of B, which represents the percentage of genes targeted by a
drug; and (iV) the value of p, which represents the number of
on-targets.

The ﬁrst parameter, the number of columns in B, is the most
important factor affecting the running time of ES. Therefore, we
generated B by varying the column size from 10 to 30 with a step
size equal to 2. At the same time, the second parameter was set to
1000, and B was sampled from a Bernoulli distribution with
hitting probability equal to 0.01 (the third parameter). In add-
ition, we further removed those rows in B for which the sum
across the columns is equal to 0. We sampled p indexes (the
third parameter) of the rows in B, with a sampling rate equal
to 10%. Then, we simulated the data 10 times with each varying
number of the columns in B, applied BTSC and ES to ﬁnd
the solution x and compared their differences in the cost and
running time.

Our results demonstrated that there is no difference in the cost
function between the BTSC and ES solutions. However, the
running time of ES increases exponentially, while BTSC tends
to generate the correct results signiﬁcantly faster (Fig. 1). From
these results, we found that ES is impractical even for ﬁnding
combinations among a small number of drugs. For example, a
search for combinations among 30 drugs using ES will take ~4.7
days to get the optimal solution. However, BTSC can obtain the
optimal solution within 9 s. We also varied the other three par-
ameters in simulation. There is still no cost difference between
BTSC and ES, and the effects of these three parameters on the
running time difference are much less important than that of the

ﬁrst parameter (data not shown). Similar results were obtained
on MOTSC (Supplementary Fig. S1). Thus, through this simu-
lation, we demonstrated that our algorithms can achieve high
accuracy with much faster running time.

To demonstrate the power of our approach in searching for
optimal drug combinations, we applied it on six disease gene sets:
acute myocardial infarction (AMI), EGFR-PI3K-AKT-mTOR
(EPAM) pathway, HTN, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM),
Parkinson’s disease (PD) and schizophrenia (SZ). All the
search parameters used for the following results are available
in the Supplementary Text S5. All the following networks are
Visualized using Cytoscape (Shannon et al., 2003). Drugs are
represented using DrugBank names, except that drugs with
long names are represented using DrugBank IDs. Further details
are provided in the online document.

3.2 Acute myocardial infarction

AMI is the irreversible necrosis of heart muscle with the usual
cause that a coronary artery is obstructed by an acute thrombus.
The AMI-related 20 genes were derived from BioCarta AMI
pathway (http://www.biocarta.com), which is collected in the
Molecular Signatures Database (version 3.1) (Liberzon et al.,
2011; Subramanian et al., 2005). From 35 associated drugs,
BTSC predicted that streptokinase, fondaparinux so-
diumlenoxaparin, DB04134 and DB07376 can be combined to
target the AMI gene set (Fig. 2).

In the four-drug combination, streptokinase is able to dissolve
blood clots that have formed in the blood vessels. F ondaparinux
and enoxaparin are anticoagulants that help prevent the forma-
tion of blood clots. The coadministration of streptokinase and
fondaparinux in a published cohort of ST-elevation myocardial
infarction patients signiﬁcantly reduced the risk of death, recur-
rence and severe bleeding (Peters et al., 2008). The combination
of streptokinase and enoxaparin is effective in patients with AMI
(Giraldez et al., 2009; Simoons et al., 2002).

Two experimental compounds, DB04134 and DB07376, were
also identiﬁed in the solution. DB04134 is an antiﬁbrinolytic
agent that acts by inhibiting plasminogen activators that have
ﬁbrinolytic properties. DB07376 is an anticoagulant that can

name AMI is represented using a cyan hexagon, and there are 20 genes
(red, orange or chocolate circles) in the AMI gene set. Four (green
squares) of 35 associated drugs (green or gray squares) selected by
BTSC can cover seven AMI genes (red circles) with no known off-
target. Eight genes (orange circles) have no associated drugs, and ﬁve
genes (chocolate circles) associated with drugs are not covered by the

prevent blood clotting. Because these two compounds tar-
get different AMI genes, the use of these two compounds
in combination with streptokinase and/or fondaparinux
sodiumlenoxaparin may exert additional beneﬁts in treating
AMI patients.

This result indicated that BTSC is able to identify known drug
combinations as well as novel compounds that are not covered
by existing therapies.

3.3 EPAM pathway

EPAM pathway plays an important role in a lot of cellular
processes and is abnormally activated in a variety of human
diseases including cancer and neurological disorders.
Eighteen genes in the EPAM pathway were obtained from
Hennessy et al. (2005) and Morris et al. (2011). From 41 asso-
ciated drugs, BTSC predicted that lapatinib, everolimus,
DB08059, DB07812 and DB06831 can be combined to target
the EPAM pathway (Fig. 3).

In the ﬁve-drug combination, lapatinib is a selective inhibitor
developed for both EGFR and ERBB2 (Diaz et al., 2010;
Opdam et al., 2012). Everolimus, a derivative of rapamycin,
can act as an mTOR inhibitor and block the signal transduction
for cell proliferation. Through literature search, we discovered
that the combination of lapatinib and everolimus shows efﬁ-
cacy in patients with advanced cancers in a phase I study
(Gadgeel et al., 2013). This combination is also under a clinical

Fig. 3. The disease—gene—drug network of EPAM. The disease gene set
name EPAM is represented using a cyan hexagon, and there are 18 genes
(red, orange or chocolate circles) in the EPAM gene set. Five (green
squares) of 41 associated drugs (green or gray squares) selected by
BTSC can cover 10 EPAM genes (red circles) with no known off-
target. Six genes (orange circles) have no associated drugs, and two
genes (chocolate circles) associated with drugs are not covered by the

trial (NCT01272141) in patients with advanced triple-negative
breast cancer and under a phase 1b/2 clinical trial
(NCT01783756) for treatment of HER-2 positive breast cancer
with central nervous system metastasis.

One consequence of mTOR inhibition by rapamycin or its
derivatives is the loss of inhibition on PI3K and AKT, resulting
increased pathway activity. In addition, patients treated with
EGF R inhibitors often develop drug resistance through second-
ary mutations (Kobayashi et al., 2005). To address these issues,
our combinatorial therapy selected DB08059 (wortmannin), a
known inhibitor of PI3K, and an experimental inhibitor
(DB07812) of AKT and GSK3,B. Therefore, simultaneously tar-
geting multiple genes in the EPAM pathway will offer the hope
to increase the efﬁcacy of drug treatment and delay the develop-
ment of drug resistance.

This result indicated that BTSC is effective in identifying op-
timal drug combination to target multiple components of an
aberrant pathway.

3.4 Hypertension

HTN or high blood pressure is a chronic medical condition char-
acterized by the elevated blood pressure in the arteries. Yue et al.
(2006) curated a set of 26 HTN-related genes including key regu-
lators in the renin—angiotensin pathway, endothelin regulation,
natriuretic peptide regulation and bradykinin—kallikrein path-
way. From 77 associated drugs, BTSC predicted that the

combination of bupranolol, triamterene, chlorthalidone, sitaxen-
tan and remikiren could be effective for treating HTN (Fig. 4).

In the ﬁve-drug combination, bupranolol is a nonselective
beta blocker, triamterene is a potassium-sparing diuretic, and
chlorthalidone is a thiazide diuretic. The combination of bupra-
nolol and triamterene has been well documented as an effective
agent for HTN treatment (Schrey, 1981). The combination of
triamterene and chlorthalidone shows clinical efﬁcacy in redu-
cing blood pressure, and keeping serum potassium concentration
from decreasing too much (Spiers and Wade, 1996).

Two other HTN drugs, sitaxentan and remikiren, were also
identiﬁed in the solution. Sitaxentan is an endothelin receptor
antagonist, and remikiren is a renin inhibitor. Because these two
drugs target different pathways, they may provide additional
beneﬁts for patients who are not responsive to the above drug
cocktails.

This result indicated that BTSC is also effective in identifying
optimal drug combination to target multiple altered pathways.

3.5 Type 2 diabetes mellitus

T2DM is a chronic metabolic disorder in which blood glucose is
increased to a high level due to altered insulin signaling. We
extracted Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes insulin sig-
naling pathway (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/) and REACTOME
insulin receptor signaling cascade pathway (http://www.reactome.
org) from the Molecular Signatures Database (version 3.1)
(Liberzon et al., 2011; Subramanian et al., 2005). These two path-
ways share 41 genes, which were used as T2DM-related genes for
optimal drug combination search. From 13 associated drugs,
BTSC predicted that insulin aspart|insulin detemir, metformin,
everolimusltemsirolimus and pegademase bovine could be com-
bined to treat T2DM (Supplementary Fig. S2).

In the four-drug combination, insulin aspart is a fast-acting
insulin analog, while insulin detemir is a long-acting insulin ana-
log. Metformin can help control blood sugar levels. Insulin
including insulin aspart and insulin detemir in combination
with metformin is routinely used in the treatment of T2DM
(Hollander et al., 2011; Kvapil et al., 2006; Wulffelé et al., 2002).

Inhibition of mTOR leads to upregulation of insulin receptor
substrate and increased activity of AKT (O’Reilly et al., 2006),
thus being able to ameliorate insulin resistance. Everolimus and
temsirolimus, two inhibitors of mTOR selected by BTSC, are
worthy of further testing in combination with insulin and/or
metformin to combat T2DM.

This result demonstrated that BTSC has the ability to identify
well-known combination regimen regularly used in disease man-
agement and promising combination component with additional
beneﬁcial effect.

3.6 Parkinson’s disease

PD is a movement disorder caused by depletion of brain dopa-
mine. We obtained 10 genes involved in dopamine synthesis and
metabolism pathway from Youdim et al. (2006). From 28 asso-
ciated drugs, BTSC predicted that the combination of levodopa,
carbidopa, entacapone, selegiline and metyrosine is able to fully
cover PD-related genes (Supplementary Fig. S3).

Among the ﬁve selected drugs, there are several well-known
combinations that have already been used to treat PD. For

Fig. 4. The disease—gene—drug network of HTN. The disease gene set name HTN is represented using a cyan hexagon, and there are 26 genes (red,
orange or chocolate circles) in the HTN gene set. Five (green squares) of 77 associated drugs (green or gray squares) selected by BTSC can cover 10 HTN
genes (red circles) with only one off-target (blue circle). Seven genes (orange circles) have no associated drugs, and nine genes (chocolate circles)

associated with drugs are not covered by the selected drug combination

example, the triple combination of levodopa (a dopamine re-
placement), carbidopa (a dopa decarboxylase inhibitor) and
entacapone (a catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor) has been
approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating
PD (Hauser, 2004). In addition, selegiline (a monoamine oxidase
inhibitor) in combination with levodopa, carbidopa
or entacapone shows improved treatment of PD (Cedarbaum
et al., 1991; Elizan et al., 1991; Lyytinen et al., 1997).

This result further demonstrated the good performance of
BTSC in identifying optimal drug combination.

3.7 Schizophrenia

S2 is a chronic, severe and disabling brain disorder affecting
~1% of the population worldwide and is linked to the dysfunc-
tion of dopamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, glutamate and
serotonin pathways. We extracted 28 SZ—related receptor and
transport genes involved in these four pathways from the
Schizophrenia Gene Resource database (Jia et al., 2010; Sun et
al., 2008, 2009).

From 102 associated drugs, BTSC predicted that haloperidol,
sertraline, dolasetron, methohexital and Vilazodone could be

combined to treat patients with S2 (Supplementary Fig. S4).
To validate the prediction, we did a literature search and dis-
covered that the coadministration of haloperidol and sertraline
to schizophrenics results in clinical improvement of negative
symptoms and aggravation of extrapyramidal symptoms
(Lee et al., 1998).

BTSC also unveiled possible new uses of three F DA-approved
drugs that have not been previously used in S2. In particular,
dolasetron targeting the serotonin pathway has been used to
treat nausea and vomiting following chemotherapy. Because
the serotonin pathway plays a key role in mood control, this
drug may improve the existing treatment schema. Such drugs
could be reused to target S2 in a cost-effective way because
their safety and side effects have already been well studied.

This result not only further demonstrated the good perform-
ance of BTSC in optimal drug combination prediction, but also
suggested the potential utility of BTSC in drug repositioning.

3.8 Performance on DCDB

We further performed an independent validation of BTSC by
applying it to predict the F DA-approved drug combinations in

the Drug Combination Database (DCDB) (Liu et al., 2010).
Using the F DA-approved drug combinations derived from
DCDB, we ﬁrst generated an approximately gold standard data-
set of 68 known associations between disease gene sets and drug
combinations. We then performed search to see the extent to
which these approved drug combinations can be recovered by
our online tool. Totally, 59 of 68 (recovery rate = 86.8%)
approved drug combinations can be fully or partly recovered,
whereas 55 of 68 (recovery rate = 80.9%) approved drug com-
binations can be fully recovered. Details are provided in the
Supplementary Text S6. This result demonstrated that BTSC is
able to identify known drug combinations with high accuracy in
a large scale.

Taken together, these results indicated that BTSC has good
performance in predicting both known and novel drug combin-
ations. In addition, MOTSC identiﬁed similar, but slightly dif-
ferent, drug combinations when applied to the ﬁve disease gene
sets that are not fully covered by BTSC (Supplementary Figs
S5—S9). The difference between the results of BTSC and
MOTSC further indicated that MOTSC is more applicable if
the user has a speciﬁc requirement on the full coverage of the
input genes. Thus, BTSC and MOTSC provided two comple-
mentary ways to identify optimal drug combination.

4 CONCLUSION

Optimal combinatorial therapy discovery is an important and
challenging problem. In this article, we introduced two comple-
mentary approaches for this problem and solved them using
MILP. There are many heuristic search algorithms that can pro-
vide greedy solutions for this problem. However, we are inter-
ested in ﬁnding the global optimum solution, and these heuristic
search algorithms cannot provide such accuracy. Therefore, we
excluded this category of algorithms in solving the optimal com-
binatorial therapy problem and did not compare our approaches
with any heuristic search algorithms. Instead, we compared our
approaches with exhaustive search and demonstrated that our
algorithms can obtain the same optimum solution with much
faster running time. Application of our approach on real disease
gene sets demonstrated its good performance in identifying
known drug combinations as well as predicting novel drug com-
binations. In addition, our approach has the potential to unveil
new functions of existing drugs for drug repositioning.

We have developed an online tool for our proposed algo-
rithms. The online tool provides many features, such as exclusion
of adverse drug—drug interaction, constraint on the number of
drugs, iterative search, highly efﬁcient solver and email notiﬁca-
tion. In addition, the online tool allows the user to assign the
weight balance on the on-target and off-target sets as well as to
choose how to handle drugs with opposite actions on input
genes. The online tool is also ﬂexible to include new constraints,
such as the importance weight of input disease genes and the
penalty weight of potential off-target genes. The availability of
the online tool will make our algorithm accessible not only to the
computational biologists but also to the bench scientists.

The mathematical analysis presented here provides a general
framework for the solution of multi-target therapeutic design.
Although running our algorithm on arbitrarily large set of
drugs is not possible due to the nature of NP—hard problem,

most of the real applications fall into the small and mid-size
categories. In practice, our algorithm and online tool demon-
strate accurate and fast performance on those applications.
One weakness of our approach stems from its use of incomplete
drug—target interaction data. However, in recent years, a signiﬁ-
cant amount of effort has been devoted to drug target annotation
and prediction. With the improved size and quality of such data,
we believe that our approach and web-based tool will play an
increasing role in drug discovery and development. In addition,
personal variants in protein-coding genes can be easily obtained
with the advances in next-generation sequencing technologies.
Owing to the heterogeneity of complex diseases, even individual
patients with the same disease may have a distinct set of causal
genes and thus will need different treatment strategy. This prob-
lem is challenging and cannot be resolved in an effective way
now. However, our tool offers one way to help predict optimal
drug combination for targeting individual set of disease genes,
which will have a non-trivial contribution to personalized
medicine.

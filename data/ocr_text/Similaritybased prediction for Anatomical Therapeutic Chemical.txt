Abstract

Motivation: Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system, widely applied in al—
most all drug utilization studies, is currently the most widely recognized classification system for
drugs. Currently, new drug entries are added into the system only on users’ requests, which leads
to seriously incomplete drug coverage of the system, and bioinformatics prediction is helpful dur—
ing this process.

Results: Here we propose a novel prediction model of drug—ATC code associations, using logistic
regression to integrate multiple heterogeneous data sources including chemical structures, target
proteins, gene expression, side—effects and chemical—chemical associations. The model obtains
good performance for the prediction not only on ATC codes of unclassified drugs but also on new
ATC codes of classified drugs assessed by cross—validation and independent test sets, and its effi—
cacy exceeds previous methods. Further to facilitate the use, the model is developed into a user—
friendly web service SPACE (Similarity—based Predictor of ATC CodE), which for each submitted
compound, will give candidate ATC codes (ranked according to the decreasing probability_score
predicted by the model) together with corresponding supporting evidence. This work not only con—
tributes to knowing drugs’ therapeutic, pharmacological and chemical properties, but also provides
clues for drug repositioning and side—effect discovery. In addition, the construction of the prediction
model also provides a general framework for similarity—based data integration which is suitable for
other drug—related studies such as target, side—effect prediction etc.

Similarity-based prediction forATC classification

1 Introduction

The Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system
developed and maintained by the World Health Organization
Collaborating Center for Drug Statistics Methodology (WHOCC),
is currently the most widely recognized classification system for
drugs and has been widely used in almost all drug utilization studies
(Dunkel et 61]., 2008). It divides drug substances into different
groups according to the organ or system on which they act and their
therapeutic, pharmacological and chemical properties. The ATC
classification system has five levels representing finer and finer clas-
sification for drugs, in which the first level has 14 anatomical
groups, with pharmacological/therapeutic subgroups as the second
level, the third and fourth levels are chemical/pharmacological/
therapeutic subgroups and the fifth level is the chemical substance
(http://www.whocc.no/atc/structure_and_principles/). For example,
a complete classification of acetylsalicylic acid is B (blood and blood
forming organs, first level), B01 (anti—thrombotic agents, second
level), B01A (anti—thrombotic agents, third level), B01AC (platelet
aggregation inhibitors excl. heparin, fourth level) and B01AC06
(acetylsalicylic acid, fifth level). A drug can be assigned more than
one ATC code when it has multiple different therapeutic uses. For
example, besides as a platelet aggregation inhibitor (B01AC06)
mentioned above, acetylsalicylic acid is also used as a drug for ‘local
oral treatment’ (A01AD05) and used as an ‘analgesic and antipyr—
etic’ (N02BA01).

Currently WHOCC establishes new drug entries in the ATC clas—
sification system only on requests from the users including manufac—
turers, regulatory agencies and researchers, which leads to serious
incompletion of the drug coverage of the system (http://www.
whocc.no/atc/structure_and_principles/). Recently as the emergence
and accumulation of various data sources in drug studies such as
chemical structures, target proteins, side—effects and drug—induced
gene expression profiles, bioinformatics prediction of ATC classifi-
cation of drugs becomes feasible. The prediction of ATC classifica—
tion of drugs not only contributes to the understanding of drugs’
therapeutic, pharmacological and chemical properties, but also pro—
vides valuable information for drug side—effect discovery and drug
repositioning. Meanwhile ATC classification prediction for chemical
compounds is also helpful for new drug development, especially
complementing with other virtual screening methods.

Recently several computational methods have been proposed to
predict ATC classification of drugs based on different data sources.
Dunkel et al. (2008) presented the first one to predict ATC codes
based on chemical structures, the assumption of which is that struc—
turally similar compounds tend to have similar medical indication
areas, and the method was developed into a web service called
SuperPred. The iSEA (indication similarity ensemble approach)
method also correlated a drug and an ATC class based on the drug’s
chemical fingerprint similarity with all drugs belonging to this ATC
class (Wu et 61]., 2013). Expect chemical structures, Chen et al. (2012,
2014) successively introduced chemical—chemical associations and
ChEBI ontology to predict ATC classification. Gurulingappa et al.
(2009) assigned drugs to ATC classes based on text mining informa-
tion. NetPredATC method used SVM (support vector machine) to in—
tegrate chemical structures and target proteins for ATC code
prediction (Wang et 61]., 2013). Although these methods obtained cer—
tain efficacy on ATC code prediction, there are still some limitations:
(i) Most of these approaches were only based on a single or two data
sources. Different data sources provide supporting evidence for ATC
code prediction from different perspectives, which usually have some
complementarity. The performance of the prediction method is sup—
posed to be further improved if multiple heterogeneous data sources

are efficiently integrated. (ii) All these jobs only assessed the efficacy
of methods on a certain ATC classification level or a certain ATC cat—
egory (e.g. Gurulingappa et al. (2009) only validated their method on
the class of ‘cardiovascular system’, one of the 14 main ATC groups).
And the prediction performance of ATC codes of unclassified drugs
(whose ATC codes are unknown) and that of new ATC codes of clas—
sified drugs (whose ATC codes are partly known) were not distin—
guished. (iii) Except SuperPred mentioned above (Dunkel et 61].,
2008), all other methods haven’t provided user—friendly program
package or been developed into a web service, which severely restricts
the utility of these methods.

To eliminate these limitations, in this article, we propose a novel
prediction model for ATC classification prediction, using logistic re—
gression (LR) framework to integrate multiple heterogeneous data
sources including chemical structures, target proteins, drug—induced
gene expression profiles, side—effects and chemical—chemical associ—
ations, and comprehensively assesse its efficacy and then compare it
with previous methods, aiming to further improve the performance
of ATC code prediction. Further, to facilitate the use, the proposed
method is developed into a user—friendly web service SPACE
(Similarity—based Predictor of ATC CodE).

2 Materials and Methods

2.1 Golden standard dataset and independent

test dataset

To develop an ATC code prediction model, first the golden standard
positive (GSP) and negative (GSN) datasets were determined. In this
article, we developed a prediction model for each ATC classification
level from 1 to 4 in a similar way, and thus GSP and GSN sets were
constructed for each level. The GSP sets of four levels were com—
posed of known drug—ATC code relationships extracted from
DrugBank database (downloaded on July 7, 2013) (Law et 61].,
2014), including 1333 small molecule drugs and their ATC codes of
corresponding levels (Supplementary Table 81). For a certain level,
suppose D and C are respectively drug and code spaces of the GSP
set, and n is the number of drug—code pairs in the GSP set. To con—
struct the GSN set, we removed the GSP set from D X C drug—code
pairs, and then randomly picked n ones from the remaining pairs to
construct the GSN set.

To assess the performance of the prediction model, besides cross—
validation, the independent test set was also used. We removed the
GSP and GSN sets from known drug—ATC code associations derived
from Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database
(version: July 5, 2012) (Kanehisa et al. 2014), and the remaining
ones constituted the independent test positive set (Supplementary
Table 81). To further discriminate the efficacy of the model on the
prediction of ATC codes of unclassified drugs (whose ATC codes
are unknown) and that of new ATC codes of classified drugs (whose
ATC codes are partly known), we divided the independent test posi—
tive set into two subsets, which were respectively ‘independent test
positive set—drug’ and ‘independent test positive set—code’. The for—
mer was composed of drugs, which don’t have any overlap with
those of the GSP/GSN set, and their corresponding codes, and the
latter included drug—code pairs whose drug space was totally
included in that of the GSP/GSN set (Supplementary Table 81). The
independent test negative set for each of these three positive sets was
respectively constructed in the similar way to the GSN set’s con—
struction, the drug—code pairs in which excluded not only those in
the corresponding independent test positive set but also those in the
GSP and GSN sets.

2.2 Similarity scores

Here we used 6 scores to measure drug—drug similarity, respectively
based on chemical structures, target proteins, drug—induced gene ex—
pression profiles, side—effects and chemical—chemical associations.

FP2 fingerprint and functional group similarity scores were com—
puted both based on chemical structures. FP2 is a hash—based binary
fingerprint which is generated by indexing the molecule structure’s
all possible linear fragments with a length ranging from 1 to 7 atoms
(O’Boyle et al., 2011). Functional groups of a drug molecule are
also represented as a binary vector, each dimension giving the pres-
ence (1) or absence (0) of a particular functional group in the mol-
ecule. Chemical structures represented by InChI (Heller et al., 2013)
were separately downloaded from DrugBank (downloaded on July
7, 2012) (Law et al., 2014) for the drugs in the golden standard set
and KEGG database (version: July 5, 2012) (Kanehisa et al., 2014)
for those in the independent test set. Based on chemical structures,
FP2 fingerprints of drugs were produced by Open Babel (v2.3.2)
(O’Boyle et al., 2011), and functional group vectors by Checkmol
program (version: April 29, 2013) which can recognize a total num—
ber of 204 functional groups (Haider et al., 2010). We used the
Tanimoto coefficient of FP2 fingerprints/functional group vectors of
a pair of drugs as their FP2 fingerprint/functional group similarity
score (Dunkel et al., 2008).

Similar to the functional group vector, the target profile of a
drug is also defined as a binary vector denoted by X: (x1, x2, . . .,
xK). Each dimension of the vector represents a protein, and its value
is set to 1 if the protein is targeted by the drug, and otherwise to 0.
Here drug—target relationships were extracted from DrugBank data—
base (downloaded on March 24, 2013) (Law et al., 2014). In total,
we obtained drug—target relationships between 4139 small molecule
drugs and 1924 human genes, and thus we defined the target profile
as a 1924—dimension vector (i.e. K: 1924). The cosine correlation
coefficient was used to measure the target profile similarity of two
drugs X and y, which is defined as

K
s<x. y) = K2161” K
\/Zz=1 x12 \/Zz=1 3’12

The side—effect profile of a drug is defined in the similar way. Side—

 

(1)

 

effect information of drugs was downloaded from SIDER
database (released on October 17, 2012) (Kuhn et al., 2010). The pro-
cessed drug—side effect relationship dataset involved 3209 side—effects
represented by MedDRA preferred terms (Brown et al., 1999), and
therefore here we defined side—effect profile as a 3209—dimension vec—
tor. The side—effect profile similarity score between drug X and y was
calculated by weighted cosine correlation coefficient:

2K wxy.
i=1 1 1 1 

5(X, y) =
 Wixi2 \/ wig/,2

where w,- is the weight function for the ith side—effect in the side—

 

 

effect profile. w,- is defined as

wt. 2 6042/02/02) ( 3)

where d,- is the frequency of the ith side—effect in the dataset, i.e. the
number of drugs having this side—effect in the dataset, o is the mean
of d,- and la is a parameter set to 1 as Takarabe et al. did (Takarabe
et al., 2013).

Gene expression profile similarity scores between 1144 drugs
were directly obtained from Cheng et al. (2013). These scores were
calculated based on gene expression profiles in response to drug

treatment downloaded from Connectivity Map (Michnick, 2006),
using the Batch DMSO Control data pre—processing method and the
Xtreme cosine similarity score (with 100 probes) to measure the
similarity (Cheng et al., 2013).

The text mining scores of chemical—chemical associations were
downloaded from STITCH database (v3.1), which were computed
based both on co—occurrence in the literature and on natural lan-
guage processing (Kuhn et al., 2008).

2.3 Minimum redundancy maximum relevance

feature selection

We used minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR)
method for feature selection (Ding and Peng, 2005 ; He et al., 2010;
Liu et al., 2013; Peng et al., 2005). In mRMR, each feature is ranked
based on not only its relevance to the classification variable but also
its redundancy with other features. In our work, both the relevance
and the redundancy were measured using mutual information (MI).
MI denoted by I between two discrete random variables X and Y is
computed based on their joint probabilistic distribution [)(x, y) and
the respective marginal probability distributions [)(x) and [)(y) (Ding
and Peng, 2005; Gray, 1990):

I<X, Y) = 2 2m, y>log <4)

ye Y xEX

MI quantifies the mutual dependence between two random vari—
ables, i.e. it measures how much knowing one variable reduces un—
certainty about the other (Gray, 1990; Liu et al., 2013).

Suppose S and T are respectively the already—selected and to—be—
selected feature sets, and |S| and |T| are the sizes of S and T. mRMR
firstly puts the feature which is the most relevant to the classification
variable into S, and then moves the remaining features within T into
S one by one, requiring each time the selected feature  to optimize
the following condition (He et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2013):

1
  

where I c) is the relevance of feature  to the classification vari—
able 6 and 1/Isl 211968 (fj’ﬂ) is its redundancy with features in S.

We downloaded the mRMR program from http://penglab.jane
lia.org/proj/mRMR/.

2.4 LR model

Suppose c is the classification variable and f1, f2, . . . . . . , f,Z are n fea-
tures. For a pair of drug—ATC code, when the drug is known to be—
long to this ATC class, c: 1, and otherwise 6:0. The LR model
used to predict whether or not a drug belongs to an ATC code based
on 11 features is represented as

 

1
H6 2 1) Z 1 + e-(ﬁo+ﬁ1f1+ﬁ2f2+ .... new (6)
where ﬂo and ﬂl, ﬁg, . . . . . . , ﬁn are respectively constant and regres—

sion coefficients of 11 features, and P(c : 1) denoted by probability_
score in this paper represents the possibility that a drug belongs to
an ATC class (Lin et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2013). In this work, SPSS
software was used to train the parameters of the LR model based on
the golden standard dataset (SPSS, Inc., 1999).

2.5 Performance assessment
The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to show
the performance of the constructed prediction model, which plots

the model’s sensitivity and specificity at varying cutoffs using 1-
specificity as x—axis and sensitivity as y—axis. Sensitivity (TP/T) and
specificity (1 —FP/F) are respectively referred to as correctly classified
fraction in the positive test set (T) and in the negative test set (F),
and TP (true positive) and FF (false positive) are respectively the pre—
dicted positives in T and F. The ROC curve can show the tradeoff
between sensitivity and specificity. A good dichotomous classifier
has a ROC curve climbing rapidly towards the top left corner of the
graph, which can be quantified by the area under the curve (AUC).
The closer the AUC is to 1.0, the better the performance of the clas—
sifier is. A perfect classifier has an AUC of 1.0, and AUC : 0.5 cor—
responds to a non—informative prediction (Lin et al., 2004; Liu et al.,
2013). We used SPSS software to draw ROC curves and compute
corresponding AUCs (SPSS, Inc., 1999).

We used 10—fold cross—validation and the independent test set to
evaluate the performance of prediction model. In the 10—fold cross—
validation, drug—code pairs in the GSP and GSN sets are randomly
averagely divided into 10 subsets, and 9 subsets are combined to be
used as the training set to train the prediction model and the remain-
ing a subset is used as the test set. This process is repeated in turn 10

Fig. 1. LRs of six similairy-based features for the ATC code of level 4 based on
10-fold cross-validation scheme. In the 10-fold cross-validation scheme, the
golden standard dataset is randomly and averagely divided into 10 subsets,
and we use 9 subsets as the training set and the remaining one as the test
set. Feature values of drug-ATC code pairs in the test set are identified based
on the training set. This process is repeated 10 times, and finally the 10 test
sets are combined to compute the LR. In each subgraph, the feature is divided
into different bins. The feature value is ‘undefined’, because for this pair of
drug-ATC code, all similarity scores between the drug and those known to be-
long to this ATC code cannot be computed. The reason why the similarity
score cannot be computed is that the target, expression or side-effect profile
of the drug is unknown, that the text mining score is not provided by STITCH
(Kuhn et al., 2008) or that the tanimoto coefficient cannot be calculated result-
ing from two ‘0' functional group vectors of two drugs. (A) FP2 fingerprint

ing score-based feature

times, and finally 10 test sets are combined to plot the ROC curve
(Li et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2013). For the evaluation by the inde—
pendent test set, we use the whole golden standard dataset as the
training set to train the prediction model, and use the independent
test set to plot the ROC curve.

3 Results and Discussion

3.1 Features used to predict drug—ATC code
associations

To develop a prediction model for ATC code assignment of drugs,
first features are comprehensively collected, which can effectively
discriminate true drug—ATC code associations from others.

We use the ‘similarity idea’ to predict drugs’ ATC codes, which
is commonly used in drug—related studies (Campillos et al., 2008;
Dunkel et al., 2008; Gottlieb et al., 2011). Our basic hypothesis is
that if two drugs are similar in a certain aspect such as chemical
structure, target protein or cellular transcriptional response etc.,
they might share the same therapeutic, pharmacological or chemical
properties and thus belong to the same ATC class. Therefore firstly
drug similarity scores are comprehensively collected. In total we col—
lect six drug similarity scores based on five data sources and several
data sources previously have been successively used to predict ATC
classification (Chen et al., 2012, 2014; Dunkel et al., 2008; Wang
et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2013). FP2 fingerprint and functional group
similarity scores capturing structural characteristics from different
perspectives are both used to measure chemical structure similarity.
Another three are separately the similarity of target profiles, gene
expression profiles in response to drug treatment and side—effect
profiles. And the last one is the text mining score of the chemical—
chemical association, whose underlying idea is that interactive com—
pounds tend to share similar functions and thus might belong to the
same ATC class (Chen et al., 2014). We prove that all these six
scores can be used to predict whether or not two drugs share an
ATC code, and by and large the higher the score between two drugs
is, the larger the possibility that they belong to the same ATC class
is (Supplementary Fig. 81).

For a pair of drug—ATC code, we define the feature value of a
certain similarity score—based feature as the largest one among the
similarity scores between this drug and those drugs known to belong
to this ATC code. We use likelihood ratio (LR) to measure the abil—
ity of the six similarity—based features to predict a drug belonging to
an ATC code, which is referred to as the ratio of the probability of
feature f observed in the GSP set to that in the GSN set. Generally
LR > 1 means the feature has the prediction ability (Liu et al.,
2013). We find that all these six features can be effectively used to
discriminate true and false drug—ATC code associations. And by and
large, the larger the feature value is, the stronger its discrimination
ability is (Fig. 1).

3.2 The prediction model integrating multiple features
We use LR model to integrate these effective features to construct
the drug—ATC code association prediction model.

Based on LR model, we first build a single—feature prediction
model for each feature. The results of ROC curves based on 10—fold
cross—validation indicate that all these single—feature prediction mod—
els are effective to predict drug—ATC code associations, which is
consistent with the conclusion of Figure 1. And these features have
different prediction ability, among which chemical structure—based
features have relatively strong ability, followed by target profile and
chemical association score—based features, and the performance of

side—effect and expression profile—based features is relatively poor
(Supplementary Fig. S2).

Further we use LR model to establish the prediction model inte—
grating multiple features. All these six features have been proved to
be effective for ATC code prediction, however apparently there is
some redundancy between them (Supplementary Table S2). It has
been recognized that integrating all individually effective features
into the model does not necessarily lead to the best prediction per—
formance. The redundancy between features often has no positive
impact and even sometimes introduces negative impact on the effi—
ciency of the prediction model, simultaneously leading to the
decreased generalization of model and resource waste (Liu et al.,
2013; Peng et al., 2005). Therefore we need feature selection before
establishing the n—features model. Here we use mRMR feature selec—
tion method (Ding and Peng, 2005), which ranks features based on
not only each feature’s prediction ability but also the redundancy be—
tween pairwise features (see Section 2.3). We observe that features
ranked at the bottom by mRMR are either those with low relevance
(e.g. side—effect and expression) or those having relatively large re-
dundancy with the features ranked in front (Table 1). For example,
the feature of ‘functional group’ has large relevance (Supplementary
Fig. S2), but it is ranked at the bottom because of its high redun—
dancy with the first feature ‘FP2’ (Supplementary Table S2).

According to the feature order ranked by mRMR (Table 1), start—
ing from the most effective FP2 single—feature prediction model
(denoted by Model_1), features are integrated into the prediction
model one by one, and ultimately the model includes all six features
(Model_6). Based on the ROC AUC, first we see that the performance
of the prediction model integrating multiple features is better than
that of any single—feature model. Further we observe that as features
are gradually added into the model, its efficacy is continuously im-
proved. The Model_6 integrating all 6 features achieves the best per—
formance (Fig. 2). These results indicate that it is necessary to
combine multiple features for more effective ATC code prediction.
Although there is some redundancy between the features we collect
(Supplementary Table S2), from Figure 2, we see that the positive im—
pact of their complementation is stronger than the potential negative
impact of their redundancy on the prediction efficacy. Here we use
the most powerful Model_6 integrating all six features as our ultimate
prediction model for drug—ATC code association prediction, whose
ROC AUC for ATC code of level4 based on 10—fold cross—validation
reaches 0.9469, displaying its excellent prediction ability (Fig. 2).

aFor all these features, 10-fold cross-validation scheme is
used. The golden standard set is averagely and randomly div-
ided into 10 subsets, and 9 subsets are combined as the train-
ing set and the remaining 1 subset as the test set. The six-
feature values of drug-code pairs in the test set are identiﬁed
based on the training set. The process is repeated 10 times,
and ﬁnally the 10 test sets are combined to be used for feature

selection.

Meanwhile the Model_6 also obtains good performance for ATC
code prediction of other levels (Supplementary Fig. S3).

Besides 10—fold cross—validation, Model_6 also achieves good
performance on the independent test set whose drug—code pairs are
independent of the GSP and GSN sets (Table 2). To further discrim—
inate Model_6’s ability on the prediction of ATC codes of unclassi—
fied drugs (whose ATC codes are unknown) and that of new ATC
codes of classified drugs (whose ATC codes are known in part), we
divide the independent test set into two subsets (see Section 2.1).
The ‘independent test set—drug’ is used to simulate the first condi—
tion, whose drug space is independent of that of the golden standard
set, and the ‘independent test set—code’ whose drug space is totally
included in that of the golden standard set but drug—code pairs are
independent, simulating the prediction of new ATC codes of classi—
fied drugs. We observe that the performance of Model_6 is good on
these two independent test subsets, indicating Model_6 can be well
qualified for the prediction of not only ATC codes of unclassified
drugs but also new ATC codes of classified drugs (Table 2).
Supplementary Table S3 presents seven concrete examples in the in-
dependent test set. In these examples, as more available features are
used for prediction, the probability scores of positive drug—code
pairs gradually increase, while those of negative drug—code pairs
gradually decrease, indicating that the more features we used, the
larger the possibility that the drug—code relationship is correctly
determined. In addition, we find that Model_6 also achieves good
prediction performance for different types of drugs including hor-
mones, natural products, synthetic molecules and salts

commonly-used formats including SMILES, InChI, MOL2 and SDF; chemical structures drew by users through JSDraw. (ii) When the number of query com-
pounds is not smaller than 2, users may also select the enrichment analysis to check the significantly enriched predicted candidate ATC codes among query com-

probability_score. When the query compound is a ‘classified’ drug (i.e. the compound belongs to the combined dataset used to train Model_6 underling SPACE,
and thus its ATC codes are at least partly known), its known ATC codes are always listed first. For each predicted candidate ATC code, clicking on it will lead to

the supporting evidence page. (ii) When the enrichment analysis is selected

on the homepage, significantly enriched candidate ATC codes among query com-

code prediction as a multi—label classification problem, which leads
to difficult comparison with our method. More importantly, when
an ATC class does not have sufficient drug instances, this ATC class
cannot be predicted by multi—label classification model
(Gurulingappa et al., 2009). Meanwhile their features used for ATC
code prediction were extracted from literature, which is also incon-
venient in practical use of the method. Therefore, here we only com—
pare Model_6 with three previous methods including NetPredATC
(Wang et al., 2013), iSEA (Wu et al., 2013) and the hybrid method
(Chen et al., 2014). The comparison scheme is that we use the stand—
ard dataset and evaluation method previously used to assess the
NetPredATC/iSENhybrid method to assess Model_6, and then com—
pares the evaluation result with those of previous methods stated in
their articles.

NetPredATC presented by Wang et al. (2013) used SVM to com—
bine chemical structures and target proteins to infer drug—ATC code
associations, using 10—fold cross—validation as evaluation scheme.
Because only the evaluation result for ATC code of level 5 was given
in their article, we reproduce and re—evaluate NetPredATC method
on level 4 using data and programs provided by Wang et al., and
then compare the assessment result with that of Model_6 of level 4
evaluated based on the same dataset. On each of 4 drug datasets pre—
viously used to validate NetPredATC, ROC AUC of Model_6 is sig—
nificantly larger than that of NetPredATC, indicating that Model_6
is more effective (Supplementary Table SS).

The iSEA (indication similarity ensemble approach) published in
2013 measured a pair of drug—ATC code association based on the
chemical fingerprint similarity between the drug and the drug set be—
longing to the ATC code. Compared with the result in Table 1 of
iSEA’s article (Wu et al., 2013), the performance of Model_6 is ap—
parently better both on ‘approved drugs’ dataset and on ‘external
data set’ (Supplementary Table S6).

Finally, we compare Model_6 with the recently published hybrid
method, which integrated ChEBI ontology, STITCH chemical-chem-
ical associations and chemical structures to predict drug—ATC code
relationships (Chen et al., 2014). For each drug, 14 candidate ATC
codes of level 1 are ranked according to the order of decreasing
scores given by the prediction model. Compared with the result in
Table 2 of Chen et al.’s article, the prediction accuracies of first/se—
cond/third candidate ATC code predicted by Model_6 are appar—
ently higher on the ‘training dataset’, ‘internal validation dataset’

Fig. 4. The ROC curve and corresponding AUC of Model_6 underlying SPACE
on drug-ATC code associations (denoted by P_set) composed of drugs and
their newly added ATC code annotations of level 4 by latest DrugBank data-
base (version: January 14, 2014) (relative to the combined dataset used to
construct Model_6 underlying SPACE) and those composed of these drugs
and random ATC codes (excluding the combined dataset and P_set)

and ‘external validation dataset’, also showing better performance
of our Model_6 model (Supplementary Table S7).

In summary, compared with previous methods, our model ob—
tains the best prediction performance on ATC code prediction,
which we think mainly attributes to the effective integration of mul—
tiple heterogeneous data sources. There is more than one data source
describing drug similarity which can provide evidence support for
two drugs sharing therapeutic, pharmacological or chemical proper-
ties. Integrating multiple pieces of evidence which are mutually com—
plementary to some extent can reduce the false positive and false
negative of the prediction.

3.4 Web service and its application
Finally, Model_6 is developed into a user—friendly web service—
SPACE (www.bprc.ac.cn/space). To make the prediction coverage
of ATC codes of SPACE as large as possible, here we combine the
golden standard set and independent test set to make up the com—
bined dataset to train the Model_6 model underlying the SPACE
(Supplementary Table 81). For each submitted compound (Fig. 3Ai),
SPACE will give its candidate ATC code list of user—specified level
ranked according to the order of decreasing probability_score meas—
uring the possibility that the drug belongs to the ATC code which is
predicted by Model_6 (Fig. 3Bi), and meanwhile for each predicted
candidate ATC code, various supporting evidence will also be pro—
vided (Fig. 3C). In addition, when the number of the query com—
pounds is not smaller than 2, in SPACE users can further do the
enrichment analysis to check the significantly enriched predicted
candidate ATC codes among query compounds (Figs 3Aii and 3Bii),
of which a typical application is to analyze potential therapeutic/
pharmacological/chemical properties of the Traditional Chinese
Medicine (TCM) composed of multiple compositive compounds.
First we apply SPACE to the drugs whose ATC classification an—
notations are newly added by latest DrugBank database (version:
January 14, 2014) (Law et al., 2014), relative to the combined data—
set used to establish SPACE. In result, SPACE obtains good per—
formance, which further indicates that SPACE can effectively
discriminate true drug—ATC code associations from others (Fig. 4).
Further SPACE is respectively applied to DrugBank drugs which
still have not any ATC classification information in DrugBank (‘un-
classified drugs’) and those whose ATC codes are (partly) known in
DrugBank (‘classified drugs’). We find that many newly predicted
drug—code associations with high probability_scores are supported by
known knowledge. For example, Enprofylline (DB00824) currently
still lacks ATC classification annotation in DrugBank and KEGG
database. Its first candidate ATC code of level 3 predicted by SPACE
is R03D (other systemic drugs for obstructive airway diseases) (proba-
bility_score : 1), and its first and second candidate ATC codes of
level 4 are respectively R03DA (xanthines) (probability_score : 1)
and C03BD (xanthine derivatives) (probability_score : 0.9999),
which is totally consistent with its description in DrugBank (Law
et al., 2014) and Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Enprofylline) that Enprofylline is a xanthine derivative used in the
treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This
example further shows that SPACE can be effectively used for ATC
code assignment of unclassified drugs. Another example is
Terbutaline (DB00871), which is annotated as a beta—2 adrenorecep—
tor agonist used for obstructive airway diseases (R03AC and R03CC)
in DrugBank (Law et al., 2014). Its another well—known use in clinic
is to inhibit uterine contractions to delay preterm labor (Gaudet et al.,
2012; Nanda et al., 2002), which is also successfully predicted by
SPACE (G02C: other gynecologicals and G02CA: sympathomimetics,

labour repressants, both with probability_score : 1). Meanwhile its
side—effect on maternal heart (Gaudet et al., 2012; Nanda et al., 2002)
is also captured by SPACE (C01C: cardiac stimulants excl. cardiac
glycosides with probability_score : 1). This example further shows
that SPACE can not only be effectively used for ATC assignment of
unclassified drugs, but also provide valuable clues for drug reposition—
ing and side—effect discovery.

Finally, we apply SPACE to the TCM Qishenkeli which was pre—
viously studied in our lab (Wang et al., 2012). Qishenkeli is a widely
used formula in routine treatment of coronary heart disease in
China, and long-term clinical practice has proved its definite effect
on improving heart function (Wang et al., 2012). We use SPACE to
predict potential ATC codes of Qishenkeli’s compositive compounds
previously collected by us (Wang et al., 2012), and further analyze
the significantly enriched ATC codes (based on predicted candidate
ATC codes ranked in the top 5, using the GSP set as the ‘control’
set). We find that many significantly enriched ATC codes among
compositive compounds are consistent with Qishenkeli’s known
functions (Wang et al., 2012), including C05: vasoprotectives (P-
value of Fisher exact test is 4.26e—36), C01: cardiac therapy
(P=4.38e—35), C04: peripheral vasodilators (P=7.89e—04) and
C02: antihypertensives (P=5.43e—03), which indicates SPACE is
also helpful for elucidating potential therapeutic/pharmacological/
chemical properties of a multicomponent drug.

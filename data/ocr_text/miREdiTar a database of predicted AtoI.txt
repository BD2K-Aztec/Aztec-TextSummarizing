ABSTRACT

Motivation: A-to-I RNA editing is an important mechanism that con-
sists of the conversion of specific adenosines into inosines in RNA
molecules. Its dysregulation has been associated to several human
diseases including cancer. Recent work has demonstrated a role for
A-to-l editing in microRNA (miRNA)—mediated gene expression regu-
lation. In fact, edited forms of mature miRNAs can target sets of genes
that differ from the targets of their unedited forms. The specific de-
amination of mRNAs can generate novel binding sites in addition to
potentially altering existing ones.

Results: This work presents miR-EdiTar, a database of predicted
A-to-l edited miRNA binding sites. The database contains predicted
miRNA binding sites that could be affected by A—to—I editing and sites
that could become miRNA binding sites as a result of A-to-l editing.

1 INTRODUCTION

A-to-I editing is an essential post-transcriptional mechanism
common to all eukaryotes. This form of editing is catalyzed by
enzymes of the adenosine deaminase acting on RNA family and
results in the conversion of single adenosines into inosines, which
are recognized as guanosines by various cellular machineries
(Bass, 2002). This can affect splicing and alter coding and
non-coding sequences in RNA molecules, thus contributing to
the diversity of the transcriptome (Rueter et al., 1999; Yang
et al., 2008). Alterations of A-to-I editing have been associated
to several human diseases, such as infections, neurological dis-
eases and cancer (Dominissini et al., 2011; Gallo and Locatelli,
2012; Maas et al., 2006).

A-to-I editing can also inﬂuence micro RNA (miRNA)-
mediated gene regulation (Nishikura, 2010). Several cases of
A-to-I editing of miRNA precursors have been reported (Alon
et al., 2012; Kawahara et al., 2007). This phenomenon can sup-
press processing by Drosha and Dicer, and the presence of in-
osines in the mature sequences can alter the recognition of their
target sites Wang et al., 2006).

A-to-I editing is most abundant in the 3’ untranslated region
(UTR) regions of the human transcriptome (Athanasiadis et al.,
2004; Levanon et al., 2004). This could affect the existing
miRNA binding sites as well as generate novel binding sites
(Liang and Landweber, 2007).

The importance of RNA editing in miRNA activity suggests
the need for computational tools to predict and analyze the
effects of RNA editing on miRNA-mediated regulation. This
work presents miR-EdiTar, a database of predicted A-to-I
edited miRNA binding sites. In this article, we describe the data-
base and suggest some plausible scenarios of the involvement of
editing in miRNA activity.

2 RESULTS

2.1 Prediction of A-to-I edited miRNA binding sites

We collected 1139 human 3’ UTR sequences with 10 571 total
A-to-I editing sites from the DAtabase of RNa EDiting
(DARNED) (Kiran and Baranov, 2010) and used the computa-
tional method miRiam (Lagana et al., 2010) to predict
miRNA-target interactions that involve the edited sites.
miRiam makes use of empirical binding rules and thermo-
dynamics features, such as the structural accessibility of the
target site and the energy of the miRNA/target duplex. We per-
formed the predictions on the complete set of 1922 human
miRNA sequences retrieved from miRBase Release 18
(Kozomara and Grifﬁths-J ones, 2011). The duplexes were then
classiﬁed into two categories, depending on whether the edited
adenosines were located on an miRNA seed binding region or
not. Seed matches were classiﬁed as 6mer, 7mer-A1, 7mer-m8
and 8mer, as in Bartel (2009).

The descriptive statistics are summarized in the Supplementary
Material.

editing events. The predicted interactions are shown along with the secondary structures of the unedited and edited versions of the binding sites

2.2 miR-EdiTar contents and web interface

miR-EdiTar contains a collection of predicted human miRNA
binding sites in A-to-I edited 3’ UTR sequences. The database
contains two kinds of sites: (i) ‘current’ sites are sites that are
predicted to be miRNA binding sites but could be affected by
A-to-I editing and (ii) ‘novel’ sites are sites that are not predicted
to be miRNA binding sites but could become miRNA binding
sites as a result of A-to-I editing.

The web site can be searched by miRNA and/or by target.
Given an miRNA, the list of its predicted targets is shown in a
box. When a target is selected, the corresponding interaction
details are displayed on a table and available for download in
comma separated value (CSV) format. The binding sites are
grouped into two categories based on their type (current sites
or novel sites). Several data elements are provided, such as the
position of the binding site on the UTR, the seed type, the free
energy of the duplex, the structural accessibility degree, the inter-
action score and the duplex structure. The edited bases are high-
lighted in bold characters and the corresponding alignment pipes
are replaced with an X, indicating the potential disruption of the
corresponding bond. In the case of current sites, an entry indi-
cates whether the edited bases are located in the seed region.
Moreover, the values of seed type, free energy, accessibility,
interaction score and duplex structure are provided for both
the edited and unedited forms of the site. Similar results can be
obtained by choosing a target from the list and then selecting one
of its predicted miRNAs.

Check boxes can be used to ﬁlter the results visualized. In
particular, users can choose to ﬁlter the interactions based on
the type of predicted site (current or novel), the fact that the seed
region is edited or not, the type of seed match (6mer, 7mer-A1,
7mer-m8 and 8mer) and the energy of the duplex.

Finally, miR-EdiTar is connected to miRo’, a web environ-
ment that provides users with miRNA functional annotations
inferred through their validated and predicted targets (Lagana
et al., 2009).

More details on the data and the methods used can be found
in the Supplementary Material.

3 DISCUSSION

The modiﬁcations of predicted miRNA binding sites are classi-
ﬁed into two categories, based on whether the editing events
occur in the seed region or in another part of the duplex. The
replacement of adenosines with inosines in the seed region can
change A-U matches into G-U wobbles which are sometimes
tolerated, especially in the presence of compensatory matches
elsewhere in the duplex, but which have been reported to
weaken the interaction or even abrogate binding (Brennecke
et al., 2005) (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. Sla). Editing events
that occur outside of the seed binding region could also inﬂuence
targeting. They might either reduce the stability of the duplex,
through the introduction of G-U wobbles and mismatches, or
increase it by improving the seed match or by creating
new matches outside the seed area (Fig. 1b, Supplementary
Fig. Slb and S10).

The presence of inosines in miRNA binding sites could also
alter their secondary structure and, as a consequence, increase or
reduce the chances of binding. It has been demonstrated that
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can signiﬁcantly
change mRNA secondary structure (Halvorsen et al., 2010;
Shen et al., 1999) and that changes in secondary structure can
signiﬁcantly affect the binding of miRNAs (Haas et al., 2012;

A.Lagana et al.

 

Kertesz et al., 2007). Therefore, it is plausible that editing events
may yield similar effects (Fig. lc, Supplementary Fig. S2).

Other than affecting existing miRNA binding sites, A-to-I
editing can generate novel miRNA/target interactions by either
changing mature miRNA sequences or creating new sites on
UTRs, as already reported by a few studies (Borchert et al.,
2009; Kawahara et al., 2007). In Supplementary Material, we
show that deamination of the 3’ UTR of the gene MDM4
could generate a novel binding site for miR-500a-3p.

All these hypotheses and preliminary experiments suggest a
new layer of dynamic regulation in miRNA-mediated gene ex-
pression control and encourage further investigations. We plan
to update the database with new editing sites and new predictions
as soon as new data is available, as well as consider other types of
RNA editing, like C-to-U editing. Moreover, since editing sites in
DARNED do not necessarily reﬂect editing events as they occur
in mRNAs, future work will also include the implementation of
an expressed sequence tags (EST)-based ﬁlter to reﬁne the
miRNA binding site predictions. Finally, we plan to include
data about the editing of miRNA sequences along with their
affected and newly created predicted targets in addition to data
on tissue speciﬁcity of both miRNAs and editing events.

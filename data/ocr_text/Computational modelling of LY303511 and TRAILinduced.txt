ABSTRACT

Motivation: TRAIL has been widely studied for the ability to kill cancer
cells selectively, but its clinical usefulness has been hindered by
the development of resistance. Multiple compounds have been iden-
tified that sensitize cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis.
The drug LY303511 (LY30), combined with TRAIL, caused synergistic
(greater than additive) killing of multiple cancer cell lines. We used
mathematical modelling and ordinary differential equations to repre-
sent how LY30 and TRAIL individually affect HeLa cells, and to predict
how the combined treatment achieves synergy.

Results: Model-based predictions were compared with in vitro experi-
ments. The combination treatment model was successful at mimicking
the synergistic levels of cell death caused by LY30 and TRAIL com-
bined. However, there were significant failures of the model to mimic
upstream activation at early time points, particularly the slope of
caspase-8 activation. This flaw in the model led us to perform add-
itional measurements of early caspase-8 activation. Surprisingly,
caspase-8 exhibited a transient decrease in activity after LY30 treat-
ment, prior to strong activation. cFLIP, an inhibitor of caspase-8 acti-
vation, was up—regulated briefly after 30 min of LY30 treatment,
followed by a signiﬁcant down-regulation over prolonged exposure.
A further model suggested that LY30-induced fluctuation of
cFLIP might result from tilting the ratio of two key species of reactive
oxygen species (ROS), superoxide and hydrogen peroxide.
Computational modelling extracted novel biological implications from
measured dynamics, identified time intervals with unexplained effects,
and clarified the non-monotonic effects of the drug LY30 on cFLIP
during cancer cell apoptosis.

1 INTRODUCTION

Combinations of drugs can have non-obvious effects on a bio-
logical system, and the magnitude of their ﬁnal effect can be
synergistic, additive or antagonistic: meaning larger, the same
as or smaller than the sum of the individual treatments (Chait
et al., 2007). For treating cancers, some of the current standards
of care are combination therapies, but the development of syn-
ergistic combinations has been an expensive and laborious pro-
cess of empirical testing (Fitzgerald et al., 2006). Computational
modelling of pathway dynamics has the potential to predict the
effects of combination treatments, and could be useful in the
design of multi-drug therapies. Single perturbations of a system
(e. g. inhibiting an enzyme) are commonly studied using trad-
itional experimental methods, but combinations of perturb-
ations, too numerous to study experimentally, can be examined
using computational tools (Koch et al., 2009), based on existing
models that describe the effects of single drugs. We used model-
ling to study the combination of TRAIL and LY303511, towards
understanding their synergy and also aiding in the discovery of
an unknown effect of LY303511.

The polypeptide ligand TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis-
inducing ligand, or Apo2L) induces death receptor-mediated
apoptosis (programmed cell death) according to a well-studied
pathway (Falschlehner et al., 2007). TRAIL is currently
undergoing phase I /II clinical evaluation for a variety of cancers,
and it holds real promise as a therapeutic strategy owing to its
selective targeting of cancer cells while sparing normal tissues
(Abdulghani and El—Deiry, 2010; Am et al., 2011). However,
development of resistance is a serious obstacle to the effective
clinical use of TRAIL, and combination therapies to overcome
resistance to TRAIL, or to induce re—sensitization to TRAIL,
could be extremely important for enabling TRAIL-based thera-
pies to succeed (Amm et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2007; Wang, 2008;
Zhang and Fang, 2005).

The small molecule compound LY30 (LY303511) has been
shown to sensitize multiple cancer cell lines to TRAIL-induced
apoptosis (Poh et al., 2007; Shenoy et al., 2009) and vincristine-
induced apoptosis (Poh and Pervaiz, 2005). LY30 is an inactive
analogue of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PISK) inhibitor

LY294002 (Gharbi et al., 2007; Jacobs et al., 2005), and is
related to the non-speciﬁc kinase inhibitor quercetin (Davies
et al., 2000). LY30 produces high levels of ROS (reactive
oxygen species), which may be particularly harmful to cancer
cells that have high metabolic rates and oxidative stress. Our
recent studies found a synergistic anti-cancer effect by combining
LY30 and TRAIL (Poh and Pervaiz, 2005; Poh et al., 2007;
Shenoy et al., 2009). Treating cells with low doses of TRAIL
plus with low doses of LY30 caused robust activation of the apop-
totic pathway, while treatment with either agent alone caused
minimal death.

We undertook the task of modelling the effects of LY30 in the
network of TRAIL-induced apoptosis, with the aim of evaluat-
ing whether the molecular effects known to be caused by LY30
were sufﬁcient to explain the synergy of the LY30—TRAIL com-
bination. We were successful in using modelling to recapitulate
the synergistic levels of cell death that were observed. However,
the simulated activation kinetics of pro-apoptotic caspase en-
zymes along the pathway showed poor correlation with experi-
mental data. In particular, there were large mismatches between
simulation and experiment at early time points, particularly for
upstream regions of the pathway. This suggested further experi-
ments focusing on caspase-8 activation shortly after treatment.
New data revealed an even larger and more obvious mismatch
between simulation and experimental data: speciﬁcally, LY30
treatment had a brief inhibitory effect on caspase-8, 30min
after treatment. Finally, we modelled two sources of ROS that
might explain the effects of LY30 on caspase-8 activation, and
that might be relevant for other anti-cancer drugs.

2 METHODS

2.1 Cell and treatments

HeLa was purchased from ATCC (Rockville, MD, USA) and maintained
in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine and 1%
S-penicillin. HeLa cells were plated at 0.125 million cells/well in 24-well
plates (and proportionally for other size plates) and grown overnight until
80% conﬂuent. All treatments with LY30 (Alexis, Switzerland) and
TRAIL (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA, USA) used the methods and
doses of (Poh et al., 2007); all combination treatments of LY30 and
TRAIL involved pre-incubation of cells with 25 uM LY30 for 1h
before adding 20 ng/ml TRAIL. Experiments with the superoxide scav-
enger Tiron (Sigma-Aldrich) applied 10 mM to cells 1h before adding
LY30. Experiments with the H202 scavenger catalase (C3511 catalase
from bovine liver, Sigma-Aldrich) used a dose of 2000 units/n11, added
1 day before treatment, then added again the next day for co-incubation
with LY30 after changing the medium. Treatments for supplementary
experiments are described in Supplementary Material 4.1.

2.2 Viability

After treatment with LY30, TRAIL or the combination for 24 h, cells
were washed with 1x PBS, stained with crystal violet for 20 min, and
washed three times with pure water. For quantiﬁcation, crystal violet was
dissolved in 1% SDS with shaking for 1h, and then measured using
absorbance at 595nm with a Tecan microplate reader.

2.3 Caspase activity

HeLa cells, after the indicated treatments and incubations, were
harvested, washed with 1x PBS, re-suspended in chilled cell lysis buffer

(BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA) and incubated on ice for 10min.
Caspase-3 and Caspase-8 enzyme activities were assayed using 7-amino
trifluoromethylcoumarin and 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin—conjugated
substrates (BioMol) as reported previously (Poh et al., 2007).

2.4 SDS-PAGE and western blotting

Hela cells were grown in 60 mm Petri dishes until 80% conﬂuent, and
treated with LY30 for the indicated durations. Cells were harvested and
washed once with 1x PBS before lysis using cell lysis buffer (150 mM
NaCl, Tris—HCl 7.4 and 1% Nonidet P40) with a cocktail of protease
inhibiors (1 mM PMSF, 10 ug/ml aprotinin, 20 ug/ml pepstatin A and
10 ug/ml leupeptin). 100 ug of cell lysate was then subjected to
SDS-PAGE on a 12% polyacrylamide gel before being electro-
transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corporation,
Bedford, MA, USA). Membranes were blocked using 5% non-fat dry
milk in TBST (TBS with 0.5% Tween20) and probed overnight at 4°C
with cFLIP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA,
USA). ,B-actin or GAPDH (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.,
Santa Cruz, CA, USA) was used as a loading control. Primary antibodies
were detected using HRP-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibo-
dies and visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence detection (ECL
reagents from Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Densities were quantiﬁed
using Image J (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/).

2.5 Simulations

All biological events were modelled with ordinary differential equations
(ODEs) as elementary reactions with mass action kinetics. KroneckerBio
toolbox (Toettcher et al., 2010) in MATLAB (Polking, 1995) and Copasi
(Hoops et al., 2006) were used for simulating the ODE models. In the
TRAIL pathway model, synthesis and degradation effects were only
modelled for caspases. Degradation processes used ﬁrst-order reactions,
and protein synthesis used zeroth-order reactions, with synthesis rate as-
signed so that the initial concentrations of the Albeck model (Albeck
et al., 2008b) would be equal to the steady state of the model system
without TRAIL. Monte Carlo simulations were carried out with sample
size of 10000 cells with normal distributions of initial concentrations
(mean equal to the initial concentration in the Albeck model, and vari-
ance equal to 40% of the mean initial concentration). PLOT was used for
visualizing simulations. The comparison of relative caspase activity meas-
urements with simulations of absolute caspase numbers is described in
Supplementary Material 1.6.

2.6 Statistical analysis

All experiments were performed at least three times for statistical signiﬁ-
cance. Numerical data were expressed as mean :I: SD. Statistical analysis
was performed using the one-tailed paired Student’s t-test considering the
variances unequal. P values<0.05 were considered signiﬁcant.

3.1 Model construction for single and
combination treatments

3.1.1 Trail model To study the synergy between LY30 and
TRAIL, we adapted a previous model of TRAIL-induced apop-
tosis (Albeck et al., 2008b), and added reaction equations for
the impact of LY30 on the network. The Albeck model was
supported by extensive experimental measurements in HeLa
(cervical carcinoma) cells, but those experiments involved cyclo-
heximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis. A lack of turnover
effects in the Albeck model means that even an insigniﬁcant

pro-apoptotic input is able to accumulate, without degradation,
until the cell eventually dies (Bagci et al., 2006; Eissing et al.,
2004). Apoptosis has evolved to occur in an all-or-nothing
manner because one of the key outcomes of apoptosis is
fragmentation of the DNA. Partial apoptosis would pose a
grave danger to chromosomal integrity. To permit the system
to simulate a bistable switch between survival and apoptosis,
we included synthesis and degradation, by approximating them
with mass-action rate equations (Fig. 1 and Supplementary
Tables S1.1—S1.3). This modiﬁcation renders the model less
quantitative, but we believe this level of simpliﬁcation is still
highly informative for inferring system-level effects. We
made several additional modiﬁcations to Albeck’s TRAIL
model: feedback from activated caspase-3 to activated caspase-9
(Zou et al., 2003), feedback from caspase-3 to caspase-8 without
caspase-6 (Ferreira et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2006) and a higher
concentration for the protein cF LIP (cellular FADD-like inter-
leukin-lﬁ-converting enzyme inhibitory protein), which was
artiﬁcially lowered in the Albeck model as a side-effect of
using cycloheximide (Kreuz et al., 2001). Also we used
Apoptosis Repressor with a Caspase recruitment domain
(Heikaus et al., 2008; Jo et al., 2004) instead of bifunctional
apoptosis regulator (BAR) to better represent the inhibition of
caspase-8, which was stipulated by (Eissing et al., 2004).

3.1.2 LY30 model Poh et al. identiﬁed two speciﬁc effects
of LY30 that might explain its ability to sensitize HeLa carcin-
oma cells to TRAIL (Poh et al., 2007): (i) clustering of TRAIL
receptors, and (ii) down-regulating the pro-survival protein
cF LIP. Figure 2 illustrates how these effects have been modelled.
Clustering is modelled by an LY30-catalysed transition in the
TRAIL receptor, converting a slow-reacting form into a
faster-reacting form that we call ‘Primed-receptor’. The cFLIP
down-regulation is modelled as an LY30-catalysed degradation

reaction, which is intended to represent any variety of possible
mechanisms including transcriptional repression, ubiquitylation,
etc. In addition, LY30 has been shown to produce ROS (Poh and
Pervaiz, 2005; Poh et al., 2007), particularly hydrogen peroxide
(H202) (Shenoy et al., 2009), which can promote death through a
variety of pathways (Clement and Pervaiz, 2001; Pervaiz
and Clément, 2002). Here, we model ROS as causing some
amount of mitochondrial permeability Wamakawa et al., 2000;
Zuo et al., 2009), and also causing mitochondria-independent
death in a small subpopulation of cells (Hampton and
Orrenius, 1997; Ruffels et al., 2004). The parameter estima-
tion is described in Supplementary Material 1.4. Our work is
speciﬁc to TRAIL-induced apoptosis in HeLa cells, and we
did not model additional phenomena found in other cell types
(Shenoy et al., 2009) or in other death pathways (Kristof et al.,
2005).

3.1.3 LY30+trail model The TRAIL model was combined
with the LY30 model to produce a theoretical model of how the
combination of LY30 and TRAIL would affect apoptosis in
HeLa. To mimic the combined treatment, we followed the ex-
perimental protocol of Poh et al., pre—incubating cells with LY30
at 25 uM for 1 h before treating with TRAIL. In other words, the
initial concentration of TRAIL was set to zero during the ﬁrst
hour with LY30 input, and then the TRAIL level was increased
to the delivered dose of 20 ng/ml.

3.2 Simulation of synergistic effects

Our previous measurements of apoptotic signalling in
LY30-treated HeLa cells (Poh et al., 2007) showed that the com-
bination of LY30 and TRAIL induced synergistic (greater than
additive) activation of many stages of the apoptotic pathway,
including initiator and executioner caspases. To increase the stat-
istical signiﬁcance of the cell death measurements, we repeated
the measurements of cell death. The combined dataset (Fig. 3)
shows cell death to occur synergistically, with the rate of killing
by TRAIL+LY30 to be 30% higher than the rate expected from
a purely additive effect.

Apoptosis proceeds in an all-or-nothing fashion, as a ‘snap ac-
tion’ switch, preceded by a variable time delay (Albeck et al.,
2008a; Albeck et al., 2008b). This creates signiﬁcant discrepancy
between the concentrations in individual cells, and in the average
concentrations in a population of cells that undergo apoptosis

Fig. 3. Simulated and observed cell viability. Cell viability was measured
by crystal violet assay at 24h after treatment with LY30 and/or TRAIL
(repeated three times and normalized to untreated control)

with variable delay. Individual cells exhibit much sharper slopes in
their activation levels than the population average (Albeck et al.,
2008a). Because our model will be compared with data from
populations of cells (immunoblots and enzyme activity assays),
we need to model apoptosis signalling in a population of cells
(Supplementary Fig. S1.5). We used Monte Carlo sampling to
compute an average trajectory, using simulations of 10000 in-
stances for each treatment condition, and normally distributed
initial concentrations with 40% variance. In keeping with previ-
ous work, we deﬁne apoptosis (death) to occur when poly ADP
ribose polymerase is at least 50% cleaved (Albeck et al., 2008b).
Cell viability was simulated for single and combination drug
treatments.

Comparing simulations against the Figure 3 experimental
measurements showed the model to be successful at recapitulat-
ing the observed synergy between LY30 and TRAIL. This ﬁnd-
ing provides a ‘proof of plausibility’ that the LY30-induced
effects of death receptor clustering, cFLIP down-regulation
and ROS production are sufﬁcient to facilitate signiﬁcant sensi-
tization to apoptosis, in cells treated with otherwise sub-lethal
doses of TRAIL.

3.2.] Model discrepancy When we inspected the simulated
levels of individual proteins, internal to the apoptotic pathway,
we found the simulations did not resemble experimental obser-
vations. A variety of estimated parameter sets and model
re—optimization efforts were unable to alleviate the qualitative
divergence of the model from the observations (data not
shown). Figure 4 compares simulated caspase-8 activity against
experimentally measured caspase-8 activity for the same three
treatment conditions. Simulations agreed reasonably with experi-
ments for the treatments with LY30 alone or TRAIL alone.
However, simulations predict that LY30+TRAIL induction of
caspase-8 would achieve synergy (greater than additive) effect
quickly and would peak before 5h. In contrast, experimental
measurements of caspase-8 showed a sharp rise much later
(10h) and no synergy at early time points. Mismatches were
also seen downstream of caspase-8 (Supplementary Figs S1.
7—S1.8). Because caspase activity measurements are not isoform
speciﬁc, measurements were repeated using Bcl2 over-expression
to decouple upstream and downstream caspases, but the
caspase-8 trends were unchanged (Supplementary Figs S4.2—S4.
5). A pattern of mismatch indicates a ﬂaw in the model, and we

Fig. 4. Comparison of simulated caspase-8 activity versus experimental
measurements for caspase-8 activation by LY30 and TRAIL. Solid lines
represent averaged results of 10000 Monte Carlo simulations. Caspase-8
activity is plotted as relative fold-change versus untreated, meaning that
untreated cells (time = 0) have activity 1.0. Black squares show the pub-
lished fold-change of protein activity relative to untreated control.
Supplementary Material 1.6 describes the conversion from simulated
levels of absolute caspase-8 activity, into estimates of relative fold-change
of measured activity, to account for cross-talk between multiple caspase
isoforrns

hypothesize that biological events upstream of caspase-8 differ
from the expected model, especially at early time points.

3.3 New experimental measurements of caspase 8
and cFLIP

The mismatch between model and experiments for the onset of
LY30+TRAIL synergy provided a narrow speciﬁcation for the
molecules and time points in greatest need of clariﬁcation. New
experiments were thus performed to measure caspase-8 activity
at more ﬁnely spaced time points after LY30.

Figure 5 shows the effect of LY30 on caspase-8 enzymatic
activity over time, with frequently spaced time points after treat-
ment. We had expected LY30 to increase caspase-8 activity, but
this experiment showed unexpected transient behaviours, with
LY30 causing a signiﬁcant decrease in caspase-8 activity at 2h.
Our model of LY30 effects (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Tables)
does not include any possible way for LY30 to delay caspase-8
nor to inhibit apoptosis. This puzzle motivated us to perform
more detailed measurements of caspase-8 dynamics.

Some unknown effect of LY30 must occur, and we can infer it
to be upstream of caspase-8, at least as soon as 2 h. Knowing that
LY30 affects cF LIP (Poh et al., 2007), and knowing that cFLIP
has complex regulation (Fukazawa et al., 2001; Peter, 2004), we
repeated the measurements of cF LIP with denser time intervals.
Figure 6 shows more complex dynamics of cF LIP protein ex-
pression. Surprisingly, cF LIP was initially up-regulated by LY30
treatment, before it declined. FADD levels were unchanged
(Supplementary Fig. S4.7).

tions) were normalized to ,B-actin intensity (loading control) before com-
paring with untreated to obtain relative fold-change

These up-and—down results demonstrated that the effect of
LY30 on cF LIP is more complex than a simple down-regulation.
To ﬁnd a pathway to explain the non-monotonic regulation
of cF LIP by LY30, we need to consider upstream regulators of
cF LIP and downstream effectors of LY30. We next studied ROS
effects in greater detail because ROS are known to be produced
by LY30 (Poh and Pervaiz, 2005; Poh et al., 2007; Shenoy et al.,
2009) as demonstrated by ﬂuorescent measurements of dichloro-
ﬂuorescin diacetate (DCFDA). Meanwhile, ROS is known to
regulate cFLIP (Lee et al., 2009).

DCFDA is the most commonly used indicator to measure
ROS, but it can be activated by multiple types of ROS. ROS is
a family of several species, with H202 (hydrogen peroxide) and
03— (superoxide) being the most abundant. In many cases, the
ratio of 03— to H202 determines whether ROS will promote or
hinder apoptosis (Clément and Pervaiz, 2001; Pervaiz and
Clement, 2007; Pervaiz and Clément, 2002; Tang et al., 2011).
A high ratio of 03— to H202 antagonizes apoptosis by triggering
pro-survival pathways such as PISK/Akt and extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (ERK) (Lim and Clement, 2007; Zhu
et al., 2011). In contrast, a low ratio of 03— to H202 promotes
apoptosis through intracellular acidiﬁcation (Pervaiz and
Clement, 2002), activation of caspase-3 and -9 Wamakawa
et al., 2000), down-regulation of cFLIP (Nitobe et al., 2003)
and down-regulation of NHE1 (Akram et al., 2006; Pervaiz
and Clement, 2007).

Fig. 7. Hypothetical model for LY30 to cause non-monotonic regulation
of cFLIP via 02— and H202. (a) Simpliﬁed diagram of LY30’s inﬂuence
on cFLIP. This model is roughly divided into two phases. In the earlier
phase, 02— is produced after LY30 treatment, and the increased 02— will
block the degradation of cFLIP, thus inducing its up-regulation. In the
later phase, H202 is produced by conversion of 02‘, and inhibits the
production of cFLIP, lowering its concentration. 0)) Simulations of

3.4 New model of LY30-induced cFLIP
regulation via ROS

We constructed a simple hypothetical model of 03— and H202
production and degradation, emphasizing the differential effects
of 05— and H202 on cFLIP (Fig. 7a). Experimental evidence
indicates that intracellular ROS and reactive nitrogen species
(RNS) regulate cFLIP expression: nitric oxide (NO)-dependent
S-nitrosylation of cFLIP prevents its ubiquitination (Iyer et al.,
2008), and S-nitrosylation can be augmented by superoxide.
Conversely, H202 promotes ubiquitination and proteasomal deg-
radation of cFLIP (Nitobe et al., 2003), and H202 can cause a
decrease in cF LIP expression. These cFLIP-related effects are
consistent with our recent ﬁndings on the differential effects of
intracellular H202 and 03— on cell fate signalling (Clément and
Pervaiz, 2001; Pervaiz and Clément, 2002). The trend of 02—
promoting survival and H202 promoting apoptosis was modelled
in Figure 7a via cF LIP. This model includes cF LIP production,
cFLIP degradation, inhibition of cFLIP degradation by 5‘,
inhibition of cF LIP production by H202, as well as 05— produc-
tion, 05— conversion into H202 and H202 degradation.
(Reaction equations, parameters and literature sources are spe-
ciﬁed in Supplementary Tables S2.1—S2.3).

Our model of ROS and cFLIP was then simulated to explore
whether the dynamics of 03— and H202 could plausibly explain
both the cF LIP increase at 30 min and the cF LIP decrease at 6 h.
Many compounds can cause production of 05— , which then gets
converted into H202, so we designed the model to be generally
applicable to ROS-producing anti-cancer drugs. Simulations
(Fig. 7b) show that LY30-induced ROS could cause cF LIP
levels to rise at 30 min and then fall in subsequent hours, due
to faster pro-CF LIP inﬂuences from 03—, and slower anti-CF LIP
inﬂuences from H202. Up-and—down behaviour of cFLIP can
introduce delay into the apoptotic pathway (Supplementary
Fig. S3.1), which explains why caspase-8 measurements did not

presence of ROS scavengers. (a) Western blot of cFLIP after 30 min
LY30 treatment in the absence/presence of Tiron. Hela is pre-incubated

with Tiron 1h before adding LY30. 0)) Western blot of cFLIP after 6h
LY30 treatment in the absence/presence of catalase

jump up immediately after combination treatment. However, the
early up-and—down trajectory was not sufﬁcient to explain the
later behaviour of caspase-8 (e.g. 10h). Additional factors may
contribute to the regulation of caspase-8. It is also possible that
our measurements may be skewed by non-speciﬁc measurements,
or by stochastic effects in the population (Brennan et al., 2012).

Finally, we performed preliminary experiments to explore
model-based hypotheses from Figure 7, using anti-oxidant treat-
ments (ROS scavengers) that are speciﬁc to certain sub-types
of ROS (Supplementary Fig. S48). If LY30 is causing cFLIP
to go up at 30 min via 03—, then removing 03— via Tiron treat-
ment would be expected to halt the ability of LY30 to raise
cF LIP at 30 min. Figure 8a shows that LY30 failed to increase
cFLIP at 30 min when Tiron was present. If LY30 is causing
later levels of cF LIP to go down via H202, then selectively
removing H202 by adding catalase would restore cFLIP levels
to the same as untreated. Figure 8b shows that cF LIP at 6 h after
treatment with both LY30 and catalase had the same relative
intensity as in untreated cells. The system of mechanisms in the
Figure 7 model is plausible and will be the subject of future LY30
studies.

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

An ODE model was constructed for combining the effects of
two anti-cancer compounds, LY30 and TRAIL. The TRAIL
effects were adapted from a previously published model
(Albeck et al., 2008b), and the LY30 effects were approximated
from our previously published experiments on LY30 (Poh and
Pervaiz, 2005; Poh et al., 2007; Shenoy et al., 2009). Some effects
of LY30 are common to multiple drugs, and our model
was designed to be maximally generic for similar cases. For
example, the standard chemotherapeutic drugs doxorubicin
and cisplatin both cause ROS production and cF LIP down-
regulation. Also, resveratrol, the widely studied compound in
red wine, causes ROS production and cFLIP down-regulation
(Ding et al., 2011; Ivanov et al., 2008; Juan et al., 2008). The
ability of ROS to affect cFLIP is enormously important for
determining whether cells are vulnerable to apoptosis (Geserick
et al., 2008), because multiple TRAIL-resistant cancers have
shown re—sensitization to TRAIL after cF LIP levels were lowered
(Hietakangas et al., 2003; Kim et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2009;
Nitobe et al., 2003).

Every protein signalling network has abundant uncertainty,
because every drug can have undiscovered effects, and every

time-series experiment can have undiscovered peaks or dips
occurring between the observed time points. Most such effects
are minor, but some are signiﬁcant enough to disrupt our ability
to reason about system behaviour. Any modelling research, in
addition to its primary goal, can thus be considered to have an
implicit surveillance function of checking the consistency of the
‘known’ facts. In building the initial model of LY30 effects, we
interpolated from a few measured time points of cFLIP, to
obtain a simple approximation of LY30-induced decay of
cF LIP, using a constant degradation rate (Supplementary
Material 1.4). When the LY30 and TRAIL effects were com-
bined, our inability to simulate the observed dynamics of cas-
pase-8 suggested an error in the model. Our initial model had
performed simplistic interpolation to simulate how LY30 affects
cF LIP. We performed subsequent experiments that showed
a non-monotonic ‘up-and—down’ concentration of cFLIP
after treatment with LY30. These effects do not contradict the
previous ﬁndings, but rather reﬁne the kinetics. The new obser-
vations of cFLIP explain the delayed activation of caspase-8
and the delayed onset of synergy in the execution of apoptosis,
because signiﬁcant concentrations of cF LIP inhibit the
activation of caspase-8 (Krueger et al., 2001). Previous studies
have used kinetic models of signalling pathways to detect mis-
matches between models and observations (Eissing et al., 2004;
Smieja et al., 2008), but this work is among very few that have
used pathway modelling to guide experiments towards actually
conﬁrming a previously unknown phenomenon (Hua et al.,
2005).

The remaining question was how LY30 causes non-monotonic
effects on cFLIP. One simple explanation would be LY30 trig-
gers two opposing pathways that regulate cFLIP in opposite
ways. We built a model of ‘typical’ ROS production and degra-
dation (Fig. 7a), including the known ability of H202 to cause
gradual down-regulation of cF LIP (Nitobe et al., 2003), and a
hypothetical opposite effect of 03— on cF LIP. In this model, the
fundamental upstream—downstream relationship between 03—
and H202, combined with the fast effects of 02‘ versus the
slow-acting effects of H202, would together cause a time differ-
ence between the OZT-dominant phase (early cFLIP increase)
and the HzOz-dominant phase (late cF LIP decline) of ROS-
mediated effects. We performed immunoblots for the plausibility
of this model, by blocking ROS species and testing whether
LY30-induced changes in cF LIP were disrupted. Our model of
cFLIP regulation was not falsiﬁed by these tests, and future
work can perform more comprehensive experiments to charac-
terize and validate the effects of LY30-induced 03— and H202 on
cF LIP.

If LY30 is unique in causing complex cF LIP dynamics, it may
be of narrow signiﬁcance, but our model describes a general
dynamic of ROS homeostasis. LY30 is one of many possible
triggers for ROS, which might then cause two opposing effects
on cF LIP. The predictions of this model may be applicable to
other ROS-producing drugs, and to other redox-regulated pro-
tein levels. Future work can determine whether the same
dynamics occur with doxorubicin, cisplatin and resveratrol.
The timing of cell vulnerability to apoptosis (‘sensitization’)
may also provide beneﬁts for the design of optimal schedules
for multi-drug treatments.

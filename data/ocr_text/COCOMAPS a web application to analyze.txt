ABSTRACT

Summary: Herein we present COCOMAPS, a novel tool for
analyzing, visualizing and comparing the interface in protein—protein
and protein—nucleic acids complexes. COCOMAPS combines
traditional analyses and 3D visualization of the interface with the
effectiveness of intermolecular contact maps.

Interaction between biomolecules is at the basis of many of
the most important molecular processes in the cell. Protein—
protein interactions underlie for instance signaling, regulation,
immunogenic recognition, whereas protein—nucleic acid interactions
underlie processes such as DNA transcription, repair, replication,
as well as post—transcriptional events, including RNA splicing
and editing.

Availability of a 3D structure for a complex allows detailed
analysis of the interaction at atomic level between the molecular
partners, which is a fundamental step for possible biomedical and
biotechnological applications. Moreover, the recent development of
well—performing docking softwares to predict the 3D structure of
macromolecular complexes (Janin, 2010) requires, in the analysis
step, the accurate and tedious screening of all the best solutions.
It is indeed well accepted that the correct solution, if any, can be
found within the 10—20 best ranked ones (e. g. the CAPRI assessment
accepts 10 different models per target from each predictor).

It is therefore of timely interest, both for bioinformaticians and
wet biologists, to have programs and tools able to automatically
analyze features of a complex interface, and to easily and intuitively
discriminate between similar and different binding solutions. Several
valuable web tools have been indeed made available (Cavallo et al.,
2003; Fischer et al., 2006; Gabdoulline et al., 2003; Kleinjung and
Fratemali, 2005; Krissinel and Henrick, 2007; Negi et al., 2007;
Reynolds et al., 2009; Salerno et al., 2004; Tina et al., 2007),
most of them being specialized in the analysis of the interface in
protein—protein complexes.

However, no available web tool has been implemented to provide
interactive contact maps from the 3D structure of a biomolecular
complex. Introduced to provide a reduced representation of a protein

structure, contact maps have been successfully exploited for
describing similarity between protein structures (Holm and Sander,
1996). Analogously, an intermolecular contact map between two or
more interacting molecules could identify uniquely and intuitively
the surface of interaction, representing a sort of ﬁngerprint of the
complex and reporting the crucial information in a ready—to—read
form. Interesting work has indeed been done to demonstrate the
advantages of using contact map representations for the alignment
of protein—protein interfaces (Pulim et al., 2008).

For these reasons, herein we present COCOMAPS
(bioCOmplexes COntact MAPS), a novel web tool to easily
and effectively analyze and Visualize the interface in biological
complexes, such as protein—protein, protein—DNA and protein—
RNA complexes, by making use of intermolecular contact maps.
COCOMAPS is available at the URL: http://www.molnac.unisa.it/
BioTools/cocomaps. A user—friendly interface allows to download
input ﬁles directly from the waDB (Berman et al., 2000) or to
upload locally stored PDB formatted ﬁles. The user is requested
to specify the chain identiﬁers for the molecules involved in the
interaction to be analyzed. More chains can be selected for each
interacting partner, which overcomes a limitation of the other
available tools that either work on all the chains present in a PDB
ﬁle or on one pair of them at a time. Therefore, COCOMAPS can
be used to analyze the interface between two molecules, between
one molecule and an ensemble (made by two or more molecular
chains) or between two ensembles, depending on how many chains
are speciﬁed.

COCOMAPS outputs are displayed on the results HTML page
for 1 month and archived as downloadable compressed ﬁles.
A link to the online resource is also emailed to the user, if
requested. COCOMAPS provides three graphical contact maps
deﬁning the interface of the complex. The ﬁrst one is a classical
intermolecular contact map, where a black dot is present at the
cross—over of residues i and j, belonging to molecule/ensemble 1 and
molecule/ensemble 2, respectively, if any pair of atoms belonging
to the two residues is closer than a cut—off distance chosen by the
user (default value being 8 A). The second map, named ‘distance
range contact map’, reports in different colors interresidue contacts
at increasing distances (7, 10, 13 and 16 A). The third contact map,
named ‘property contact map’, is similar to the ﬁrst one, but each
contact is colored according to the physicochemical nature of the two
interacting residues: i.e. hydrophobic—hydrophobic, hydrophilic—
hydrophilic and hydrophobic—hydrophilic. By mousing over the
maps, it is possible to Visualize the identity of the residue pairs
corresponding to the dots.

Fig. 1. Comparison of the complexes of HEL with the two antibodies:
D1.3 (PDBcode: 1VFB) and F10.6.6 (PDBcode: 1P2C). Left: COCOMAPS
‘property contact maps’. Labels have been added for the antibody
hypervariable loops L1—L3 and H1—H3. Magenta, green and yellow
dots indicate hydrophilic—hydrophilic, hydrophobic—hydrophobic and
hydrophobic—hydrophilic contacts, respectively. The cut—off distance is set to
10 A. Right: A Pymol Visualization of the complexes based on the automatic
COCOMAPS script .pml; residues at the interface are shown as ‘sticks’.

COCOMAPS also provides detailed information, organized in
tables, about: (i) interacting residues, deﬁned on the basis of a
cut—off distance that can be customized by the user (see above);
(ii) residues at the interface, deﬁned on the basis of the buried surface
upon complex formation; and (iii) intermolecular H—bonds, with
speciﬁcation of the acceptor and donor atoms. A 3D Visualization
of the complex in JMol (http://www.jmol.org) is also provided
online, with the interacting residues highlighted. Finally, a ready—
to—run Pymol script (http://www.pymol.org), which generates a
Visualization of the interface in the corresponding 3D structure, is
downloadable. All the programs under the COCOMAPS web tool
have been written in python, taking advantage of python libraries
such as SciPy and Matplotlib. Accessible surfaces and H—bonds
are calculated by NACCESS (Hubbard and Thornton, 1993) and
HBPLUS (Mcdonald and Thornton, 1994), respectively.

Although COCOMAPS provides a complete characterization
of the interfaces in biological complexes, the real novelty that
it introduces is the generation of intermolecular contact maps.
Contact maps give an immediate View of which regions of the
two partners are in contact. From the property map, it is also
possible to immediately appreciate the physicochemical nature of
the interaction. As an example, in Figure 1 property contact maps
are reported for the complexes of hen egg lysozyme (HEL) with two
different antibodies, namely Dl.3 [(Bhat et al., 1994), PDBcode:
1VFB] and F10.6.6 [(Cauerhff et al., 2004), PDBcode: 1P2C],
together with the corresponding Pymol 3D representation of the
complexes, as generated by COCOMAPS. The 2D contact maps
of the HEL—antibody complexes reported in Figure 1 show at a
glance that the two binding solutions are completely alternative, and
the corresponding epitopes present no overlap. In addition, contact

maps specify which regions of the antibodies and of the antigen are
in contact. As expected, both antibodies contact HEL with their six
hypervariable loops (L1, L2, L3, H1, H2 and H3, also labeled in the
ﬁgure, for the sake of clarity). As for the HEL antigen, it contacts
the D13 antibody with ~30 N— and 30 C—terminal residues and
the F10.6.6 antibody with its central region (residues 40—85). The
same information could of course be extracted either from lists of
interacting residues or from the 3D View of the complexes (such as
that in Figure 1). However, differently from the contact map View,
which is immediate, in both of the above cases, manual intervention
by the user would be required to extract the needed information.
Further, the contact maps in Figure 1 immediately indicate that the
H3 loop of the D l .3 antibody is more involved in the interaction with
HEL than the F10.6.6 H3 loop, and that it mostly gives hydrophilic—
hydrophilic contacts (magenta dots). This is a consequence of the
D13 H3 loop sequence, ERDYRLDY, which is longer than the
F10.6.6 one, GDGFYVY, and much more hydrophilic, containing
ﬁve charged residues.

In conclusion, COCOMAPS combines in a single tool
the traditional analysis and 3D Visualization of interfaces in
biomolecular complexes with the effectiveness of the contact map
View. It can straightforwardly be applied to the analysis of interfaces
both in experimental and predicted 3D structures of biological
complexes.

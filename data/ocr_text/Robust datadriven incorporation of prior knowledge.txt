ABSTRACT

Motivation: Inferring global regulatory networks (GRNs) from
genome-wide data is a computational challenge central to the field
of systems biology. Although the primary data currently used to infer
GRNs consist of gene expression and proteomics measurements,
there is a growing abundance of alternate data types that can reveal
regulatory interactions, e.g. ChIP-Chip, literature-derived interactions,
protein—protein interactions. GRN inference requires the development
of integrative methods capable of using these alternate data as priors
on the GRN structure. Each source of structure priors has its unique
biases and inherent potential errors; thus, GRN methods using these
data must be robust to noisy inputs.

Results: We developed two methods for incorporating structure priors
into GRN inference. Both methods [Modified Elastic Net (MEN) and
Bayesian Best Subset Regression (BBSR)] extend the previously
described Inferelator framework, enabling the use of prior information.
We test our methods on one synthetic and two bacterial datasets, and
show that both MEN and BBSR infer accurate GRNs even when the
structure prior used has significant amounts of error (> 90% erroneous
interactions). We find that BBSR outperforms MEN at inferring GRNs
from expression data and noisy structure priors.

1 INTRODUCTION

Understanding how global regulatory networks (GRNs) coord-
inate systems-level response of a cell or organism to a new en-
vironmental state or perturbation is a key problem in systems
biology, with applications spanning biofuels (Bonneau et al.,
2007), novel therapeutic targets (Carro et al., 2010) and the dis-
covery of novel pathways involved in cellular differentiation
(Ciofani et al., 2012). The cellular response is governed by
multiple regulatory mechanisms that can be encapsulated by

large network models. Recent advances in the quality and avail-
ability of high-throughput technologies enable measurement of
different components of the GRN including mRNA transcript
levels, protein levels, post-translational modiﬁcations, as well as
DNA characteristics such as transcription factor-binding regions
and open chromatin locations (ENCODE Project Consortium,
2012). These multi-level and multi-scale datasets have made the
inference of integrative GRNs possible.

As high-throughput data capturing the abundance of mRNA
transcripts are the most mature and readily available, many
methods focus only on this single level of regulation, learning
transcriptional regulatory networks. In transcriptional GRNs,
the regulators are transcription factors (TFs, either previously
known or predicted), and the targets are genes. Time-series
data, capturing the temporal changes in transcript abundance,
allow for the inference of the strength and direction of regulatory
interactions, which can be used to predict how the system will
behave under previously unmeasured conditions (Bonneau et al.,
2007). Here, we are primarily interested in methods for learning
regulatory networks from compendia of expression data, and
combining this data with complementary data sources that pro-
vide priors on network structure. Importantly, the priors we use
in this work provide information about connectivity but do not
provide any information about the relative strength, importance
or dynamic properties of each known regulatory edge (these we
atempt to learn from the data).

Learning networks from single data types has severe limita-
tions, as GRNs operate on multiple levels in addition to the
transcriptome; thus, alternate data types are needed to form a
complete picture of cellular circuits. Even if one is interested in
learning the purely transcriptional layer of a cell’s regulatory
network, many TFs are post-transcriptionally modiﬁed in ways
that confound single data-type network inference (the transcript
abundance of a TF is not necessarily correlated with its protein
abundance nor activity), and some regulatory sub circuits pro-
duce transcriptional output that is consistent with multiple
models.

One way to mitigate these pitfalls is to use publicly available
sources of complementary data with bearing on regulation. We
term any data that contains direct TF-target information (either
predicted, or experimentally validated) as structure priors. One
source of such prior information is an ever-growing collection of
experimentally validated and manually curated databases of
regulatory interactions. These databases are especially rich for

Robust data-driven incorporation of prior knowledge

 

model organisms (Florez et al., 2009; Gallo et al., 2010;
Gama-Castro et al., 2011; Lammers et al., 2010), and the sets
of known regulatory interactions are considered to be accurate
and precise (though not complete). Additionally, the ENCODE
Project Consortium (2012) (a high-proﬁle effort to build an
encyclopedia of coding DNA elements) has generated a wealth
of DNA-binding information that can be used to generate priors
on mammalian regulatory network structure. These are only a
few examples of an ever growing number of sources of GRN
structure priors, and it can be seen that they differ substantially
from organism to organism.

Each source of prior information on GRN structure is an
incomplete recapitulation of the underlying network, and may
contain many incorrect or irrelevant interactions. Thus, incor-
porating structure priors into expression-based GRN inference
poses several interesting algorithmic challenges. Successful meth-
ods for integrative GRN inference must possess the following key
properties: (i) The method must only include the part of the prior
with support from the data. This is important, as the prior infor-
mation typically is a collection of possible regulatory interactions,
of which only a subset might be relevant in a given dataset. Also,
this implies robustness to erroneous interactions in the prior,
which can have various sources, such as non-functional TF bind-
ing reported by ChIP-Seq. (ii) Using a structure prior must not
limit the ability to learn the part of the network for which no prior
information exists. (iii) The user must be able to control the
weight given to the prior. This feature allows the user to tune
the method based on the believed completeness and accuracy of
the prior, while respecting the ﬁrst two properties over a wide
range of parameters. In this work, we introduce two methods
for incorporating structure priors that possess all three criteria.

1.1 Prior work

A lot of effort has been put into learning GRNs from gene
expression time-series data and prior knowledge. For recent
reviews on the topic we refer to Bar-Joseph et al. (2012) and
Hecker et al. (2009).

Some of the ﬁrst GRN inference methods allowed for the
inclusion of additional data as structure priors (Imoto et al.,
2003; Tamada et al., 2003). However, they allowed only for a
very limited number of nodes in the network. Werhli and
Husmeier (2007) and Husmeier and Werhli (2007) build on
that work and express the available prior knowledge in terms
of an energy function, from which a prior distribution over net-
work structures is obtained. The complexity of these methods
limits their application beyond small networks. More computa-
tional convenient methods use the static representation of known
regulatory interactions to derive condition-speciﬁc topological
changes in network structure (Ernst et al., 2008; Luscombe
et al., 2004; Schulz et al., 2012). Other methods combine expres-
sion data with prior knowledge to estimate transcription factor
activities, which then allow to draw conclusions about the under-
lying network structure (Fu et al., 2011; Seok et al., 2009).
Another method, similar to MEN proposed in this work, uses a
network-constrained regularization procedure for linear models
to incorporate prior information (Li and Li, 2008). However, in
all these cases, it is not clear how sensitive these methods are to
errors in the priors.

The need for benchmarking general methods for GRN infer-
ence using similar datasets and gold standard sets led to the
organization of a ﬁeld-wide test, the Dialogue for Reverse
Engineering Assessments and Methods (DREAM) (Marbach
et al., 2012; Prill et al., 2010; Stolovitzky et al., 2007, 2009).
The competitions have shown that methods that incorporated
multiple data types in a mutually reinforcing manner typically
performed better. However, in DREAM, all information about
the networks, including gene names, were obfuscated from the
participants; thus, methods that use any sort of prior information
could not be tested.

1.2 Our approach

We extend the recently published Inferelator approach for
GRN inference (Bonneau et al., 2006, 2007; Greenﬁeld et al.,
2010; Madar et al., 2010) to incorporate structure priors
into the inference procedure. We retain the core Inferelator or-
dinary differential equation model and introduce two separate
model selection approaches that can use structure priors.
One involves a modiﬁcation of the Elastic-Net model selection
approach, and we refer to it as Modiﬁed Elastic Net (MEN). This
method has been introduced previously (Yong-a poi et al., 2008;
Zou and Zhang, 2009), and here we incorporate it into the
Inferelator, and rigorously evaluate its performance.
Additionally, we developed a novel model selection approach,
which uses a Bayesian regression framework with Zellner’s
g prior (Zellner, 1983) along with best subset selection for
model selection. We refer to this method as Bayesian Best
Subset Regression (BBSR).

We test MEN’ 5 and BBSR’ s ability to incorporate structure
priors on three datasets: (i) the DREAM4 one-hundred node in
silico challenge, (ii) the DREAMS Escherichia coli dataset and
(iii) a recently published Bacillus subtilis dataset (Nicolas et al.,
2012) (see Supplementary Material for additional description).
As suggested by the DREAM consortium (Marbach et al., 2012;
Prill et al., 2010; Stolovitzky et al., 2007, 2009), we use area under
the precision recall curve (AUPR) as the measure of perform-
ance. Importantly, for the E.c0li and B.subtilis datasets, we
evaluate performance only over the subset of genes and TFs
that have at least one known interaction. We test the robustness
of each method by supplying sets of structure priors that have
incorrect prior information added. In doing so, we simulate
the biologically relevant environment where literature— and
experiment-derived priors will have incorrect and irrelevant
information.

2 METHODS

We will ﬁrst deﬁne our core model, a simple ordinary differential equa-
tion (ODE) model where transcription factors effect transcription rate,
and where mRNA degradation rate is proportional to mRNA level.
Following the description of our core model, we introduce two exten-
sions, MEN and BBSR, to our prior method, the Inferelator, that enable
the use of known regulatory edges to inﬂuence model selection.

2.1 Problem set-up

We deﬁne x = (x1,xz, ---,xN)T to be the observed mRNA expression
levels of N genes, as measured by microarray (or RNAseq). The datasets

Fig. 1. Method ﬂow chart. Our method takes as input an expression
dataset. To build a mechanistic model of gene expression, we create
time-lagged response and design variables, such that the expression of
the TF is time-lagged with respect to the expression of the target. We then
resample the response and designing matrices, running model selection
(using either MEN or BBS R) for each resample. This generates an ensemble
of networks, which we rank combine into one ﬁnal network

contain two distinct sets of experiments: (i) time-series (X ts), and
(ii) steady-state (X85). In a time-series experiment, mRNA expression is
measured at consecutive time points after some stimulus. To simplify
notation, and without loss of generality, we assume that X ts is one such
time series experiment, with K observations, 11,12, ..., tk [i.e. x(tl),
x02), ...,x(tK) are the columns of [VS]. In a steady-state experiment,
the mRNA expression is observed once, when the system has reached
steady state. We consider all steady state experiments as X” with L ob-
servations, e1, e2, ...eL [i.e. x(e1), x(e2), . . . x(eL) are the columns of X”].
The method takes as input X ts and X” and the output is a matrix S, where
each entry s,”- e S corresponds to the conﬁdence that there exists a regu-
latory interaction between gene x,- and gene x,- (i.e. x, —> x,). S can be
thought of as a ranking of every possible regulatory interaction, where
a higher value of s,”- indicates a stronger conﬁdence in x, —> x,. A ﬂow-
chart summarizing our approach is depicted in Figure 1.

2.2 Limiting the number of regulators for each gene

When we infer transcriptional regulatory networks, we consider only
a—priori known (or predicted) transcription factors as potential regulators.
We deﬁne P to be the set of indices of the regulators in x. For each gene i,
we have a speciﬁc set of regulators P,- C P. The members of P,- are deter-
mined using thLR as in (Greenﬁeld et al., 2010; Madar et al., 2010),
and limited to the union of the 10 highest-scoring predictors and all
predictors with prior knowledge. Note that we do not attempt to infer
self-regulation in either method presented here, i.e. Vx,, i¢P,.

2.3 Core model

We assume that the time evolution of the x’s is governed by the
following ODE
dx,

a=—a.x.+:r..x.. i=1w-sN <1>
pEPl'

Where 0:, > 0 is the ﬁrst order degradation rate [estimated from literature
(Hambraeus et al., 2003; Selinger et al., 2003)], ,8 is a set of parameters
to be estimated and P,- is the set of potential regulators for x,. For clarity,
we describe the model formulation only for a linear combination of regu-
lators, and note that as in Bonneau et al. (2006), this is easily extended
to combinatorial interactions, and other non-linear functional forms.
Recall that x,- contains both time-series and steady-state observations,
which we describe separately.

In the case of time-series data, we proceed by applying the ﬁnite
difference approximation to the left hand side of Equation (1), isolating

the unknown parameters ,8 on the right hand side, and dividing both sides
by 05,-. We can now write Equation (1) as

Xi(lk+1) — MW)
1,-—
lk+1 — 1k

+ XiUk) = Ti 2 ﬂipprk),
pePi 
i = l, ...,N
Where 1,20% is related to the half-life 1% by 1% = t,log(2). Note that
here the design variable xp(tk) is time-lagged relative to the response
variable x,(tk+1) by one time point. This can easily be extended to con-
sider a lag of multiple time points; however, multiple time-lags did not
increase performance on the datasets tested here.

We summarize the left-hand side of the equation as 32,-, which we refer
to as the time-series response variable, and approximate it as a linear
combination of the xj’s, which we refer to as the time-series predictor
(i.e. design variable). Over the time series conditions:

yi(tk+m) = 2181317397079
Ni m
i=1, ...,N, [C21, ...,K—l

Note that the design and response variables are indexed only over the
time-series conditions, and the design variables (xj’s) are time-lagged with
respect to the response variable.

In the case of steady-state observations, % = 0, and Equation (1)
becomes

XXI?!) = Ti 2 131',pxp(€l),
Mi m
i=l,...,N, l=l,...,L

The two sides of the equation correspond to the steady-state response
and design variables. To construct the ﬁnal response and design variables,
we concatenate the response and design variables over time-series
and steady-state observations. The ﬁnal step before model selection is
to normalize and scale the response and design variables such that they
have zero mean and variance of 1.

There are many ways to solve Equation (3), including regression.
It was previously shown that sparse models of regulatory networks can
accurately capture the topology and dynamics, and that using L1 shrink-
age (and variations such as the Elastic-Net) can be used to enforce model
parsimony (Greenﬁeld et al., 2010; Gustafsson and Hornquist, 2010).
Below, we describe MEN and BBSR, two different model selection
procedures, both of which treat )2 as the response variables and the
x as the predictor variables, learn parsimonious models, and have the
ability to incorporate prior information.

2.4 Modiﬁed elastic net

Algorithm Overview Here we describe the MEN approach for estimating
the parameters ,8 in Equation (3). We use MEN to both: (i) enforce a
sparsity constraint on the parameters ,8, and (ii) incorporate prior know-
ledge of regulatory interactions Xj —> 12,. This approach has been previ-
ously described, but has never been rigorously tested in the context of
incorporating constraints into GRN inference. We begin by describing
the application of the Elastic-Net to model selection in the context of the
core model described in Equation 3.

Elastic-Net regression The Elastic-Net (Zou and Hastie, 2005) ﬁnds a
parsimonious solution to a regression problem [e.g. Equation (3)], and
enforces sparsity through a penalty on the regression coefﬁcients, which is
a combination of the [1 lasso penalty, and the [2 ridge penalty. Let R be
the total number of elements in response and design variable. We estimate
the parameters ,8 in Equation (3) by minimizing the following objective
function (i.e. the sum of squares of the residuals).

regression. 5 determines the balance between the lasso and ridge penalties,
where S: 0 amounts to lasso regression, and S = l amounts to
ridge regression. In practice, 5 is a vector, for each value of which we
use lO-fold CV to pick s,-. The ﬁnal model for y,- is determined by the
value 5 and s,-, which minimize the prediction error. This approach
amounts to a grid search of the parameter space as described in Zou
and Hastie (2005).

Modiﬁed Elastic Net To incorporate prior information directly into
the model selection approach, we minimize Equation (5) subject to a
new penalty function, closely related to Equation (6)

Where 8,3,, is a modiﬁer on the shrinkage incurred on each parameter.
If there is prior belief for a regulatory interaction x1, —> 12,-, then 8,3,, < 1
corresponds to less shrinkage being incurred on the corresponding ,8,, 1,,
hence making it more likely that this parameter is not shrunk out of the
model. Note that only the degree of shrinkage of a parameter is modiﬁed,
not the correlation between a target, TF pair, nor the order in which
predictors are selected by the model. In cases where multiple predictors
are correlated (a common occurrence in biology), 8,3,, will cause pre-
dictors with no prior information to be shrunk from the model before
predictors with prior information. Note that the 8,3,, modiﬁes only the [1
norm, as in Zou and Zhang (2009). This implementation is based on the
elasticnet R package (Zou and Zhang, 2009).

2.5 Bayesian best subset regression

We now describe the BBSR method, an alternative inference method that
computes all possible regression models for a given gene corresponding to
the inclusion and exclusion of each predictor. Prior knowledge is incor-
porated by using informative priors for the regression parameters, and
sparsity is enforced by a model selection step based on the Bayesian
Information Criterion (BIC).

Bayesian Regression With Informative Prior Here we introduce the
linear regression we use during the model building step of the algorithm.
We assume the prediction error

6i = yr — Xlgi (8)

to be independent and identically distributed with mean 0 and variance
02. The response variable of gene iis denoted as 32,-, the design variables of
TFs as X and the regression solution as ,8,-. For clarity, we will omit the
index i for the remainder of this section. We assume that the target gene
response is distributed according to a multivariate normal

(148,02, x) oc Nn(X,8, 021) (9)

with the predicted response as mean, and a variance co-variance matrix
that has the error variance 02 on its diagonal and is 0 otherwise. In this
formulation, n is the number of observations (experiments). This can
be solved by a Bayesian regression where we can incorporate existing
knowledge by tuning the prior on ,8.

We use a modiﬁcation of Zellner’s g Prior (Zellner, 1983) to include
subjective information in our Bayesian regression problem. In the original
formulation, the prior distribution of ,8 has the following form

7113102) o< N. (8092(YX)‘102), (10)

i.e. a distribution proportional to a multivariate normal with an initial
guess ,80 as mean and a data-dependent covariance matrix that is scaled
by a user chosen factor of g e (0, 00). The prior distribution of 02 is the

same as is typically used with the non-informative prior, ,0(02) oc  The
choice of a large value for g will lead to results centred around the
ordinary least squares solution, and the error variance will be the
lowest. Values of g close to 0 on the other hand will lead to solutions
that are centred around ,80 with higher error variance.

The joint posterior distribution has the functional form

1003.020) = 10(8Iy, 02);)(02 u). (11)

and the marginal posterior distributions are

0 2
poof) o< N  + 13°15), ($000“), (12)

 

2 7’1 SSR (,80 — ,BOIS)X’Xgﬁ  _ Igols)
0(0 ly) oc IG<2, T1. 2 9 (13)

where IG is the Inverse Gamma distribution with shape and scale par-
ameter, and SSR is the sum of squares of the residuals of the ordinary
least squares solution 8°15.

With this set-up, we can propose a prior guess ,80 of the vector of
regression coefﬁcients, and encode our belief in this guess with g.
To allow for different levels of conﬁdence in the different elements
of ,80, we extend the original formulation of the g prior to use a vector
g with one entry per predictor. The scale parameter of the Inverse
Gamma distribution of the marginal posterior distribution of 02 then
becomes

(’80 _ Igols)GX/XG(IB? _ Igols)
2 9

 

scale 2 T + (14)
where G is a square dia onal matrix whose diagonal entries starting in the
upper left corner are E and all remaining entries are 0.

In practice, we choose ,80 to be a vector with all entries having the
value 0. This reﬂects our prior belief that the regulatory network is
generally quite sparse. We set the vector g to values of g for those
predictors that we have additional knowledge for and believe that they
regulate gene i, and to l for the other predictors. A value of g = 1 treats
all predictors equally and we refer to it as ‘no priors’, whereas g> 1 allows
the predictors with priors to explain for more of the variance of the
response.

Model Selection We use the BIC to select the ﬁnal model from the
21’ possible regression models for a gene i. For a given model m, the BIC
is deﬁned as

BICm = nln(02) + kln(n) (15)

where n is the number of observations and k the number of predictors.
To be more robust, we avoid using a point estimator for 02 directly,
but use the expected value of BICm based on the posterior distribution
of 02

E[BICm] = nE[ln(02)] + k ln(n) (16)

E[BICm] = n(ln(shape) — Digamma(scale)) + kln(n), (17)

where shape and scale parameterize the marginal posterior distribution
of 02 as in Equation 14. As a ﬁnal step, the predictors of the model with
the lowest E[BIC] are selected as the TFs regulating gene i. If p is large
(> 10), we use an initial ﬁltration step to discover the 10 most promising
predictors (see Supplementary Material for details).

2.6 Ranking interactions and bootstrapping

After model selection is carried out by either MEN or BBSR, the output is a
matrix of dynamical parameters ,8, where each ,8,-,1- e ,8 corresponds to the
direction (i.e. activation or repression) and strength (i.e. magnitude) of a
regulatory interaction. These parameters can be used to predict the re-
sponse of the system to new perturbations. If the goal is to rank

A.Greenfield et al.

 

regulatory interactions based on a conﬁdence measure, simply ranking
by |,8,-,,-| is not the best scheme, as this does not take into account the
overall performance of the model for 12,-. As a result we re-rank inter-
actions, taking into account the relative performance of each model,
and the proportion of variance explained by each ,8,-J. The result is a
matrix S where the ﬁnal conﬁdence score for XL,- is given by

2
Ufml model for y,- (18)

 

SL1" = 1 — 2
Umodel for y,- without predictor j

To further improve inference and become more robust against
over-ﬁtting and sampling errors, we use a bootstrapping strategy. We
resample the input conditions with replacement and run model selection
on the new dataset. This procedure is repeated 20 times, and the resulting
lists of interactions (S matrices) are rank combined to a ﬁnal ranked list
as in Marbach et al. (2010).

3 RESULTS

We have conducted systematic thorough testing of the ability of
both MEN and BBSR to accurately reconstruct GRNs using prior
information in biologically relevant settings. We tested both
methods with respect to the number and accuracy of prior
known interactions (PKIs), and the effect of the weight of the
PKIs. Performance is validated against the set of gold standard
interactions (GSIs).

3.1 Effect of varying weight on priors

We assessed how sensitive our performance is to the choice of the
weight parameter (8 for MEN and g for BBSR). For this initial
investigation of parameter sensitivity, we used the entire gold
standard as input (the set of PKIs covers all GSIs), and assessed
performance over the set of GSIs. Though this design is circular,
the purpose was to characterize the sensitivity of our method to
the choice of 8 and g, the parameters that control the relative
inﬂuence of the structure prior for MEN and BBSR respectively

Fig. 2. Effect of weight parameter on performance. We use all GSIs as
the set of PKIs, and evaluate performance (in terms of AUPR) against
the set of GSIs. We evaluate this performance for a variety of choices
of the weight parameter for both methods

(see Section 2). In Figure 2, we see the performance of each
method (in terms of AUPR) as a function of the weight param-
eter. As the value of 8 is decreased, the performance of
MEN increases to a certain point, followed by a decrease in per-
formance for all datasets (Fig. 2, right panel). This is true for all
tested datasets, and it seems that MEN has a ‘sweet-spot’around
8 = 0.01, which results in best performance for all tested
datasets. On the other hand, BBSR has a predictable behaviour
for all tested datasets: performance increases for increasingly
large values of g, limiting to an AUPR of l as g approaches
inﬁnity. This trend holds true for all datasets (left panel of
Fig. 2).

3.2 Incorporation of prior interactions is data driven

We next investigated which of the known edges were included in
the resulting network models. We used all GSIs as PKIs and
selected a prior weight of 8 = 0.5 for all datasets for MEN,
and values for g that resulted in similar AUPRs for BBSR
(g = 1.26, 2.2 and 1.6 for Dream4, E.c0li and B.subtilis, respect-
ively). We split the predicted interactions in two sets, high-ranked
(recall 3 0.5) and low-ranked (recall > 0.5 AND in set of PKIs),
and compared the two sets with regard to the signal in the data.
Signal for an interaction (TF-target pair) is deﬁned as the
time-lagged correlation for that pair. We chose this metric, as
we use the time-lagged response and design matrices for model
building (see Section 2).

For both methods and all datasets, we can see that
high-ranked interactions have more signal (fewer near-zero
correlations) than low-ranked interactions (densities peaked
around zero), see Figure 3. However, for smaller values of 8,
this trend is less pronounced for MEN, where more high-
ranked interactions show time-lagged correlation of 0 (see
Supplementary Material).

Robust data-driven incorporation of prior knowledge

 

3.3 Performance on the leave-out set: using constraints
does not damage our ability to learn new interactions

Here we assess if knowing part of the true regulatory network
limits our ability to learn new regulatory interactions. We deﬁne
the leave-out set as the set of GSIs that are not input as PKIs into
our methods. For this experiment, we sampled PKI sets ran-
domly resulting in subsets that consisted of 20, 40, 60 and 80%
of the GSIs for each of the three datasets (we carried out ﬁve
repetitions of this random sampling). We used the same weight
parameters as in the previous section. AUPR of the leave-out set
was computed when using PKIs and compared with the perform-
ance when no PKIs were used (Fig. 4). We observe similar trends
for the six dataset—method combinations. Neither one method
shows a consistent trend, and using prior information does not
signiﬁcantly help or damage performance on the leave-out set.
However, very high weights for BBSR lead to a detectable
performance decrease, whereas MEN is less affected by the prior
weight (see Supplementary Material). Overall, performance on
the leave-out set changes only slightly when priors are used.

In line with these observations, we can observe that overall
performance increases linearly as the fraction of GSIs that is
given as PKIs increases (see Supplementary Material). This
trend is true for all three datasets and both methods.

3.4 Robustness to false prior information

As sources of biological prior knowledge (e.g. literature-derived
regulatory relationships, protein—protein interactions, ChIP-seq-
detected binding events) are expected to have large numbers of
incorrect (false prior) interactions, or interactions not relevant in
a given dataset, it is important that methods for incorporating
prior knowledge are robust to these cases. To test the robustness
of MEN and BBSR to incorrect prior information, for each net-
work, we considered half of the GSIs as true prior interactions
(TPIs), and added a varying number of random false prior
interactions (FPIs). We evaluated performance on the complete
set of GSIs, and used as PKIs sets of interactions that have
TPI:FPI ratios of 1:0, 1:2, 1:5, 1:10. A choice of 1:10 TPI:FPI
for the E.c0li dataset, for example, results in a set of PKIs that
contains 1033 true interactions that are GSIs, and 10330 false
interactions which are not GSIs. FPIs were drawn randomly in

ﬁve repetitions, and results showed a consistently low variance,
so only mean values are presented here. We tested the perform-
ance of both MEN and BBSR on these PKI sets with increasing
error for two choices of the respective weight parameters as fol-
lows. Low weights: 8 for MEN is 0.5 for all datasets, and g for
BBSR is 1.26, 2.2, 1.6 for Dream4, E.c0li, B.subtilis. High
weights: 8 is 0.01 for all datasets, and g is 2.8, 13, 10. To compare
our results with other methods, we used the web platform
GenePattern (http://dream.broadinstitute.org/) and ran CLR,
GENIE3 and TIGRESS on our data with default parameters.
Additionally, we computed the AUPR of a simple interaction
ranking method which places all PKIs at the top of the list.
In general, high weight parameters make the methods more sus-
ceptible to noise, but for the two large datasets, E.c0li and
B.subtilis, performance throughout all noise levels is still better
than any method without PKIs. For low weight parameters,
and the Dream4 and B.subtilis datasets, BBSR is less susceptible
to noise, and results in higher AUPRs than MEN (Fig. 5).
For all three datasets, performance of both methods is always
higher than the naive ranking scheme when false priors are
present.

4 DISCUSSION

We developed two methods for incorporating prior knowledge
into GRN inference. Both methods use the same underlying
ODE model of regulation (see Section 2), but use different
model selection approaches. MEN uses an adaptive weight on
the penalty function to incorporate prior knowledge. BBSR uses
the Bayesian formulation of linear regression, together with
Zellner’s g-prior to incorporate prior information, and best
subset regression with the BIC for sparse model selection.

A key difference between MEN and BBSR is how the choice of
weight (how much inﬂuence to give to the prior) effects
performance. Results presented in Figure 2 show that for
BBSR higher values of g result in overall higher conﬁdence in
PKIs, and reduced conﬁdence in all unknown interactions. As
such, g can be interpreted as a conﬁdence measure in the
accuracy and completeness of PKIs, and be chosen accordingly.
It is also possible to introduce multiple sources of prior informa-
tion, each with a different weight (value of g). For MEN,

that were not GSIs. We show the AUPR of both methods for multiple choices of the respective weight parameters, as well as methods that do not use

(gray bars)

the prior weight parameter 8 exhibits a less predictable beha-
viour. Lower values of 8 generally lead to higher conﬁdence in
PKIs. However, for all datasets, we observed a performance
peak around 8 = 0.01. This non-linear property could be the
result of cross-validation model selection procedure.

We tested the performance of both methods on different sub-
sets of the GSIs. We see that increasing the number of PKIs
increases performance in a linear manner for all datasets and
both methods (Supplementary Fig. S2). This is in concordance
with the results on the leave-out set (the set of GSIs that are not
PKIs), where both methods showed only minor performance
change in the presence of PKIs, regardless of dataset or
number of PKIs used (Fig. 4).

Finally, and most importantly for application to biological
systems where only incomplete and noisy sets of PKIs are
available, we assessed the robustness of both methods to FPIs.
Both methods are robust to FPIs, and outperform the naive
ranking scheme, which assigns high conﬁdence to all PKIs
(Fig. 5). More speciﬁcally, for both large real datasets (E.c0li
and B.subtilis), both methods perform better than various base-
lines (no PKIs), with up to 10 FPIs for each true prior inter-
action. This means that both methods, given sufﬁcient genomic
data, are able to act as ﬁlters to distinguish between true and
false prior interactions. However, BBSR is slightly more robust to
the presence of FPIs.

A key consideration for any practical application of network
inference methods with prior information is the trade-off
between recapitulating the prior, and discovering novel biology.
Intuitively, as the degree of belief in the prior is increased (by
increasing the weight of the prior information), more of the inter-
actions in the prior will be ranked highly by the inference
method. Thus, high weights can lead to the incorporation of
false interactions in the case of inaccurate PKIs (MEN more
prone than BBSR), and impair performance on the leave-out

set (as seen in BBSR). We suggest to the reader to set the
weight parameter for incorporating prior knowledge based on
the expected completeness and accuracy of the PKIs, and,
when in doubt, to choose a low weight.

5 CONCLUSION

In this work, we have presented two methods for incorporating
additional knowledge to constrain GRN inference by adding
priors on the network structure. In the analysis of the methods,
we focused on parameter choice and robustness to false priors,
and show that both methods are remarkably tolerant to error
in the priors. The inclusion of prior knowledge signiﬁcantly
improves the quality of inferred networks without damaging
our ability to learn new interactions. Of our two methods,
the BBSR inferred more accurate networks than the MEN in the
presence of noise in the set of network priors used, and provides
an intuitive weight parameter to control the strength of priors.
This makes BBSR an appropriate method for integrating
potentially noisy complementary data such as ChIP-Chip,
ChIP-Seq, protein—protein interactions, literature-derived regula-
tory interactions and regulatory hypothesis derived from
DNA-binding motifs into a data-driven regulatory network
inference process.

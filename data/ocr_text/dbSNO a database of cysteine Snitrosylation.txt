ABSTRACT

Summary: S-nitrosylation (SNO), a selective and reversible protein
post-translational modification that involves the covalent attachment
of nitric oxide (NO) to the sulfur atom of cysteine, critically regulates
protein activity, localization and stability. Due to its importance in reg-
ulating protein functions and cell signaling, a mass spectrometry-
based proteomics method rapidly evolved to increase the dataset of
experimentally determined SNO sites. However, there is currently no
database dedicated to the integration of all experimentally verified
S-nitrosylation sites with their structural or functional information.
Thus, the dbSNO database is created to integrate all available data-
sets and to provide their structural analysis. Up to April 15, 2012, the
dbSNO has manually accumulated >3000 experimentally verified
S-nitrosylated peptides from 219 research articles using a text
mining approach. To solve the heterogeneity among the data collected
from different sources, the sequence identity of these reported
S-nitrosylated peptides are mapped to the UniProtKB protein entries.
To delineate the structural correlation and consensus motif of these
SNO sites, the dbSNO database also provides structural and func-
tional analyses, including the motifs of substrate sites, solvent acces-
sibility, protein secondary and tertiary structures, protein domains and
gene ontology.

Availability: The dbSNO is now freely accessible via http://dbSNO.
mbc.nctu.edu.tw. The database content is regularly updated upon
collecting new data obtained from continuously surveying research
articles.

1 INTRODUCTION

Of the various post-translational modiﬁcations (PTMs),
S—nitrosylation (SNO) is reversible and involves the covalent at-
tachment of nitric oxide (NO) to the thiol group of cysteine (Cys)
residues. An increasing number of studies suggest that protein
S—nitrosylation plays an important role in the NO-related redox
pathway, especially in immune, cardiovascular, neuronal and
plant systems (Bogdan, 2001; Gaston et al., 2006; Jaffrey et al.,
2001; Karpuzoglu and Ahmed, 2006; Lindermayr et al., 2005;

Stamler et al., 2001). The various targets of S—nitrosylation and
differential expression of those targets modulate the activity, 10-
calization and stability of proteins (Hess et al., 2005; Lam et al.,
2010; Nakamura and Lipton, 2009) and further regulate
patho-physiological events, such as neurodegenerative diseases
and cancers (Cho et al., 2009; Hess et al., 2005; Yao et al.,
2004). Due to the importance of S—nitrosylation in biological
processes, numerous efforts have been directed toward mass
spectrometry-based S—nitrosyl-proteomic studies using various
biological systems to increase signiﬁcantly the number of
known S—nitrosylated peptides (Chen et al., 2010; Greco et al.,
2006; Hao et al., 2006; Murray et al., 2011). Among these studies,
the biotin-switch method is the most commonly adapted method
for the site-speciﬁc identiﬁcation of protein S—nitrosylation
(Jaffrey et al., 2001). As the number of experimentally identiﬁed
S—nitrosylated peptides grows, a structured database of protein
S—nitrosylation is desirable for the further investigation of the
biological functions of S—nitrosylated proteins and the substrate
speciﬁcities of SNO sites. Although a number of databases have
been developed for post-translational modiﬁcations, such as
dbPTM (Lee et al., 2006), Phospho.ELM (Dinkel et al., 2011),
PhosphoSite (Hornbeck et al., 2004), O-GLYCBASE (Gupta
et al., 1999), UbiProt (Chernorudskiy et al., 2007), dbOGAP
Wang et al., 2011) and PupDB (Tung, 2012), there is no data-
base dedicated to S—nitrosylated proteins and their corresponding
substrate sites. Thus, a new database (dbSNO) containing the
experimentally veriﬁed S—nitrosylated peptides from research art-
icles is proposed to facilitate with the functional analysis of
S—nitrosylated proteins and assist with the structural investiga-
tion of S—nitrosylation sites.

2 METHODS

The system ﬂow of the construction of the dbSNO is presented in
Figure l. The dbSNO contains the experimentally veriﬁed data for
S—nitrosylated proteins and S—nitrosylation sites. All the database entries
are manually extracted from research articles through a literature survey.
First, all ﬁelds in the PubMed database are searched based on the key-
words ‘S—nitrosylation’ or ‘S—nitrosylated’ followed by downloading the
full text of these research articles. For the various proteomic identiﬁcation
experiments (Derakhshan et al., 2007; Greco et al., 2006; Hao et al., 2006;
Murray 61 al., 2011; Wang et al., 2008), a text-mining system is developed
to survey the full-text literature that potentially describes the site-speciﬁc
identiﬁcation of S—nitrosylated sites. Approximately, 400 original and
review articles associated with protein S—nitrosylation are retrieved
from PubMed (April 2012). Next, the full-length articles are manually
reviewed for the precise extraction of the S—nitrosylated peptides and the

modiﬁed cysteines. To determine the locations of S—nitrosylated cysteines
within a full-length protein sequence, the experimentally veriﬁed
S—nitrosylated peptides are then mapped to UniProtKB (Bairoch et al.,
2005) protein entries based on database identiﬁer or sequence similarity.
The S—nitrosylated peptides that cannot align exactly to a protein se-
quence are discarded. Finally, each mapped S—nitrosylation site is attrib-
uted to the corresponding literature (PubMed ID). In addition, a small
number of protein S—nitrosylation sites in UniProtKB are integrated into
dbSNO with the attributed literature. Up to April 15, 2012, a total of 219
S—nitrosylation—associated articles covering 18 organisms are retrieved
from PubMed. In the dbSNO database, there are 3374 S—nitrosylated
cysteines in 1757 S—nitrosylated proteins. Supplementary Table S1
shows the statistics for the S—nitrosylation data in each organism.

For a given protein, the biological function can be obtained from the
annotation of UniProtKB. To provide more effective information about
protein functional and structural annotations relevant to cysteine
S—nitrosylation, a variety of biological databases, such as InterPro
(Hunter et al., 2011), Gene Ontology (GO), Protein Data Bank (PDB)
(Rose et al., 2011) and dbPTM (Lee et al., 2006), are integrated. In this
study, the InterPro BioMart, which is a web-service and provides the
ability to build custom queries on the InterPro database, is utilized to
extract the information about protein domains and functional sites for
the S—nitrosylated proteins in dbSNO. The information regarding the
molecular function, cellular components and biological process for a
S—nitrosylated protein can be accessed by a crosslink that refers to the
corresponding entry from QuickGO (Binns et al., 2009) through a
UniProtKB accession number.

Accumulating studies reveal that the cysteine residue, having a low pKa
or a thiol group exposed on the protein surface, is more accessible by NO
modiﬁcation (Derakhshan et al., 2007; Hess et al., 2005). To study the
preference of the solvent accessible surface area (ASA) that surrounds
SNO sites within the protein tertiary structure, the experimentally identi-
ﬁed S—nitrosylation sites should be mapped to the corresponding pos-
itions of the protein entries in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The
preference of the secondary structure around the modiﬁcation sites is
also considered. However, due to the limited information of protein struc-
tures in PDB, only ~3% of the S—nitrosylation sites have corresponding
tertiary structures. With respect to the previous studies investigating the
structural characteristics of PTMs (Lee et al., 2011; Shien et al., 2009) in
proteins without known tertiary structures, two effective tools, RVP-net
(Ahmad et al., 2003) and PSIPRED (McGufﬁn et al., 2000), are used to
predict the solvent accessibility and secondary structure, respectively.

Database of cysteine S-Nitrosylation

 

biological processes and functional domains of S—nitrosylated
proteins are presented in Supplementary Tables S2 and S3,
respectively. The analysis of the predicted protein domains
shows that ~70% of the reported SNO sites are located within
functional domains (Supplementary Table S4).

To investigate the substrate speciﬁcity of the SNO sites,
MDDLogo (Lee et al., 2011), a maximal dependence decompos-
ition analysis that clusters the aligned signal sequences into sub-
groups containing statistically signiﬁcant motifs was performed
to identify the substrate motifs for the S—nitrosylation data in
each organism with a sufﬁcient dataset. As shown in the example
of the mouse dataset (Table 1), l2 substrate motifs, which were
identiﬁed from 2216 mouse SNO sites with a 2l-mer window
length, contain a conserved motif of positively charged amino
acids (K, R and H) surrounding the SNO sites. In particular, the
11th group contains negatively charged amino acids (D and E)
accompanied by positively charged amino acids in conserved
motifs at two speciﬁc positions. Consistent with previous studies
(Chen et al., 2010; Greco et al., 2006; Greco, 2006; Hao et al.,
2006; Lane et al., 2001), the S—nitrosylated cysteines may be
located within an acid—base motif ﬂanked by acidic and basic
amino acids.

4 CONCLUSION

The dbSNO database is the ﬁrst public resource to allow efﬁcient
access to curated SNO sites, functional annotations, structural
characteristics and substrate motifs for S—nitrosylated proteins.
With regard to the computational prediction of SNO sites,
dbSNO could provide the benchmark dataset for the develop-
ment and comparison of prediction tools.

ABSTRACT

Summary: geWorkbench (genomics Workbench) is an open source
Java desktop application that provides access to an integrated suite
of tools for the analysis and visualization of data from a wide range
of genomics domains (gene expression, sequence, protein structure
and systems biology). More than 70 distinct plug-in modules are
currently available implementing both classical analyses (several
variants of clustering, classification, homology detection, etc.) as
well as state of the art algorithms for the reverse engineering of
regulatory networks and for protein structure prediction, among
many others. geWorkbench leverages standards-based middleware
technologies to provide seamless access to remote data, annotation
and computational servers, thus, enabling researchers with limited
local resources to benefit from available public infrastructure.
Availability: The project site (http://www.geworkbench.org) includes
links to self-extracting installers for most operating system (OS)
platforms as well as instructions for building the application from
scratch using the source code [which is freely available from
the project’s SVN (subversion) repository]. geWorkbench support
is available through the end-user and developer forums of the
caBlG® Molecular Analysis Tools Knowledge Center, https://cabig-
kc.nci.nih.gov/Molecular/forums/

Contact: geworkbench@c2b2.columbia.edu

1 INTRODUCTION

A large number of bioinforrnatics techniques have been developed
in recent years to serve the needs of biomedical research. The ﬁeld
is moving rapidly, with new and improved approaches appearing
frequently. The fast pace of change and the technical sophistication
of these approaches creates a barrier of adoption for ordinary
biologists. The problem is exacerbated by the integrative nature of
biomedical research, which requires combining data from multiple
genomic/biomedical databases and using an array of advanced
analyses, often available only in the form of command line programs
(Kumar and Dudley, 2007, Reich et al., 2006). Additionally, due
to their sheer size and dimensionality, analysis of genomic data
sets can be computationally very demanding. It is unlikely that
every biomedical researcher that would like to utilize such analyses
will have access to local/institutional hardware resources capable of

supporting their execution. It is then important to facilitate sharing
of public infrastructure through the use of technologies such as grid
computing (Kurc et al., 2009, Stevens et al., 2003).

geWorkbench integrates many computational resources and
makes them available through a uniﬁed user interface. For
biomedical researchers with little or no computational training, this
approach facilitates adoption by eliminating many steps that require
programming skills (e. g. transformations from one ﬁle format to
another; staging of databases and programs; dealing with operating
system (OS) shells in order to execute command line programs).
For software developers, geWorkbench provides an open source,
component-based architecture that enables the addition of new
functionality in the form of plug—in modules (which can further
leverage existing tooling that streamlines access to server side
components). Extensive documentation is available (manuals, online
help and tutorials) to guide users in the proper use of the application.
An innovative logging framework collects and mines data about how
various modules are being utilized, offering the possibility for novice
users to learn from their more advanced peers.

2 DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND SUPPORT

geWorkbench comprises at present more than 70 distinct modules,
supporting the integrated analysis and Visualization of many types
of genomic data. Users of geWorkbench can:

0 Load data from disk or from remote data sources (such as
the caArray microarray data repository at the National Cancer
Institute, https://array.nci.nih.gov/; the PDB protein structure
database; and sequence databases at the University of Santa
Cruz and the European Molecular Biology Laboratory).

0 Visualize gene expression, molecular interaction networks,
protein sequence and protein structure data in a variety of ways.

0 Access client— and server-side computational analysis tools
such as t-test analysis, hierarchical clustering, self—organizing
maps, analysis of variance (AN OVA), regulatory and signaling
network reconstruction, basic local alignment search tool
(BLAST) searches, pattern/motif discovery, etc.

0 Validate computational hypothesis through the integration of
gene and pathway annotation information from curated sources
as well as through enrichment analyses.

Several modules have been developed in collaboration
with investigators from the Center for the Multi-scale
Analysis of Genomic and Cellular Networks (MAGNet,
http://magnet.c2b2.columbia.edu/), one of seven National Centers
for Biomedical Computing (NCBCs, http://www.ncbcs.org);

The mission of the MAGNet Center is to provide the research
community with novel, structural and systems biology methods and
tools for the dissection of molecular interactions in the cell and for
the interaction-based elucidation of cellular phenotypes (Table 1
lists some of the MAGNet plug ins; Supplementary Figs 1 and 2
provide related screenshots). Other geWorkbench modules are
wrapped versions of pre—existing third party software tools such as
Cytoscape (Shannon et al., 2003), Ontologizer (Bauer et al., 2008),
and several analysis modules from the Microarray Experiment
Viewer (Saeed et al., 2003) and GenePattern (Reich et al., 2006).
A complete module listing (with screenshots) is available at the
project web site, http://www.geworkbench.org/, under the ‘Plug—ins’

page.

2.1 Software architecture

geWorkbench is designed around a component-based architecture
whose main purpose is to facilitate the expeditious integration of
algorithms and data sources as plug in modules. Its key elements
are described in the Supplementary Material.

2.2 Server side computing

The computational, administration and storage requirements of
many bioinformatics resources developed by MAGNet (such as
large genomic databases and CPU/memory-intensive algorithms)
make deployment on a desktop computer infeasible. To make
them available to geWorkbench (as well as other clients), such
resources are deployed as programmatically accessible grid services
using caGrid (Saltz et al., 2006), the grid middleware layer of the
caBIG® initiative. An attractive feature of caGrid is that if offers
tooling (Introduce Toolkit; Hastings et al., 2007), which streamlines
the process of deﬁning, deploying and registering caGrid-aware
services. caGrid services have been developed by other participants
of the caBIG® program as well and geWorkbench provides access
to many of them (caArray, the Cancer Gene Index, the NCI Pathway
Interaction Database, etc.).

2.3 Documentation and user support

geWorkbench is accompanied by detailed end-user documentation,
demonstrating how to perform common analysis tasks and
explaining the theoretical underpinnings of many analysis modules.
Community support is provided by the caBIG® Molecular
Analysis Tools Knowledge Center (MAT-KC, https://cabig-
kc.nci.nih.gov/Molecular/KC). Additionally, geWorkbench utilizes

novel data mining approaches (Murphy et al., 2008) to
create communities of practice through activity awareness. See
Supplementary Material for details.

3 DISCUSSION

geWorkbench provides biomedical researchers with an integrated
suite of well-documented analysis and visualization tools. By
removing the need for programmatic manipulations, it facilitates
utilization of multi-module analysis pipelines. It leverages state of
the art middleware software to allow seamless access to remote
data sources and computational infrastructure. It offers access to
many advanced systems and structure biology methods developed by
investigators at the MAGNet Center. Moreover, by adopting an open
source development model and by using an extensible component-
based architecture, it encourages community contributions and
addition of new modules so that available functionality can keep
up with the needs of the user base. Finally, the MAT-KC makes
extensive resources available to assist users with learning how to
use the application and its various plug in modules.

ABSTRACT

Summary: A protein’s isoelectric point or pl corresponds to the solu-
tion pH at which its net surface charge is zero. Since the early days of
solution biochemistry, the pi has been recorded and reported, and
thus literature reports of pi abound. The Protein lsoelectric Point data-
base (PlP—DB) has collected and collated these data to provide an
increasingly comprehensive database for comparison and bench-
marking purposes. A web application has been developed to ware-
house this database and provide public access to this unique
resource. PIP-DB is a web-enabled SQL database with an HTML
GUI front-end. PIP-DB is fully searchable across a range of properties.
Availability and implementation: The PIP-DB database and docu-
mentation are available at http://www.pip-db.org.

1 INTRODUCTION

For a macromolecular polyprotic system—such as protein, DNA
or RNA—the isoelectric or isoionic point—commonly referred
to as the isoelectric point (pI)—can be deﬁned by the point of
singularity in a titration curve, corresponding to the solution pH
value at which the net overall surface charge, and thus, the mo-
bility, of the ampholyte sums to zero (Maldonado et al., 2010).
Protein pIs can be determined in several ways, but are generally
determined using either polyacrylamide gel-based isoelectric
focusing (or IEF) or capillary IEF (or cIEF) (Silvertand et al.,
2008; Righetti et al., 2013). Separation by pI is a key component
of 2D gel electrophoresis, a key precursor of proteomics, where
discrete spots can be digested in-gel, and proteins subsequently
identiﬁed by analytical mass spectrometry (Mauri and Scigelova,
2009). Analysis of whole proteomes indicate that at the system
level, pIs exhibit a multimodal distribution indicative of signiﬁ-
cant phylogenetic constraints on surface charge WV u at al., 2006).

Theoretical calculation of pIs can aid proteome analysis:
assuming the protein to be denatured, calculation is rapid,
requiring only the sequence to be known (Cargile et al. 2004).
Most techniques exploit tabulated values for pKa values for
ionizable amino acid residues (Sillero and Ribeiro, 1989),
which are assumed constant irrespective of structural context
(Maldonado et al., 2010).

A protein’s pI is one of the most comprehensively determined
and widely reported characteristic quantities in biochemistry and
proteomics. However, such reports are typically almost inciden-
tal within the wider characterization of a protein or proteins.
Thus far, no dedicated, web-accessible database of protein pI
values has been made available. Thus, we describe here the
Protein pI Database @IP-DB), our ongoing attempt to catalogue
comprehensively the pIs of proteins, as reported in the literature.

2 METHODS AND USAGE

2.1 Data acquisition

Protein pI data were collected through scrutiny of the primary
scientiﬁc literature. Data acquisition progressed in two stages.
In the ﬁrst rapid stage, two early reviews (Righetti and
Caravaggio, 1976; Righetti et al., 1981) were interrogated supply-
ing a core of information (pI, protein identity, etc), which we
supplemented by parsing online resources, primarily Brenda
(Schomburg et al., 2013). Using this initial limited dataset, we
constructed a prototype PIP-DB. In the second, slow stage, we
undertook quasi-exhaustive literature searches, using a variety of
search terms within PUBMED, ISI Web of Knowledge, Scopus
and Quertle, to identify papers containing pI data, together with
prospective and retrospective searching using citation lockup. In
all instances, where possible, we referred back to the original art-
icle to extract all archived data items, which we then supplemented
as described below.

2.2 Data content

PIP-DB contains 5773 protein entries, each associated with either
a single pI value or pI range. Each protein entry is linked to
additional associated data: experimental data (stored within
PIP-DB) and cross references to external data sources.
Experimental data include, where available, temperature,
method of analysis (IEF, cIEF, etc.), total measured molecular
weight (MW), number of subunits, subunit MW, Enzyme
Commission (EC) number, source organism and cellular and/
or tissue location. Cross references include links to the NCBI
Taxonomy browser (F ederhen, 2012) and literature citations to
PUBMED abstracts, publisher abstracts in lieu of PUBMED
entries, and, where available, to full texts at publisher’s websites.
For just under one half of entries (2822 of 5773), PIP-DB also
records the protein sequence, as abstracted from UniProt
(UniProt Consortium, 2014) or NCBI (NCBI Resource
Coordinators, 2014).

2.3 Web implementation

PIP-DB has been implemented as a polylingual web-enabled
database system, including source code written in Clojure
LISP, JavaScript, Less CSS, M4sh, Make, Python and sh pro-
gramming languages. Additional documentation is formatted in
LaTeX, HTML and Markdown.

PIP-DB can be searched by keywords such as protein name,
source organism, experimental method, and cellular and/ or tissue
location and by numerical properties such as pI, EC number,
temperature and MW. A search engine and domain-speciﬁc lan-
guage has been designed, which enables searching of PIP-DB by
representing compound queries using tree structures in LISP.

Importantly, PIP-DB can also be searched using global se-
quence similarity, as implemented in BLAST (Altschul et al.,
1990). As much of the data we archive have a provenance,
which is legacy in nature, often not linked unambiguously to
explicit sequences, we have generally been conservative in our
assignment of corresponding sequence data, with 2822 sequences
of the 5773 entries.

Ease of use was a priority in constructing PIP-DB, with a
particular emphasis on creating an intuitive search engine.
Navigation through the website is facilitated by the tiered display
of information: encompassing titles, then summary, to full entry,
with links to further information.

3 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

In line with our previous database generation exercises (Blythe
et al. 2002; McSparron et al. 2004; Toseland et al., 2005a,b;
Toseland et al., 2006; Ansari et al. 2010), we extract and
record data as described in the original report, without making
arbitrary changes to it. As it is not possible for logistic reasons to
retest each pI value, we must trust these values are accurate.
Context in the form of associated experimental data allows
users to draw their own conclusions regarding data veracity.

Researchers from many disciplines can potentially beneﬁt from
PIP-DB: such as virtual gel methodology and theoretical IEF, as
well as functioning as a tool in its own right to facilitate study of
the physical chemistry of proteins. In particular, predictive pI cal-
culation needs benchmarking, as the veracity of pI predictors is
assumed and not yet proven. What explicit comparisons there
have been, and they are few in number, have used small datasets
(Patrickios and Yamasaki, 1995), datasets of peptides rather than
proteins (Lengqvist et al., 2011) or report poor accuracy
(Henriksson et al., 1995; Patrickios and Yamasaki, 1995). Thus,
the sequence search feature of PIP-DB will provide an alternative
of true utility to extant predictors and a gold-standard bench-
marking resource for such work.

In summary, PIP-DB is a dedicated, manually-curated fully
searchable database presently containing >5500 measured pI
values, and associated data of many types. As new studies
appear, and legacy data are continually polled, additional infor-
mation will be integrated into PIP-DB. Moreover, we will extend
the scope of the PIP-DB to include peptides, nucleotides and
viruses (Subirats et al., 2011).

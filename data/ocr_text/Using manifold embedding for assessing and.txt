ABSTRACT

Motivation: High-throughput protein interaction data, with ever-
increasing volume, are becoming the foundation of many biological
discoveries, and thus high-quality protein—protein interaction (PPI)
maps are critical for a deeper understanding of cellular processes.
However, the unreliability and paucity of current available PPI data
are key obstacles to the subsequent quantitative studies. It is
therefore highly desirable to develop an approach to deal with
these issues from the computational perspective. Most previous
works for assessing and predicting protein interactions either need
supporting evidences from multiple information resources or are
severely impacted by the sparseness of PPI networks.

Results: We developed a robust manifold embedding technique
for assessing the reliability of interactions and predicting new
interactions, which purely utilizes the topological information of PPI
networks and can work on a sparse input protein interactome without
requiring additional information types. After transforming a given
PPI network into a low-dimensional metric space using manifold
embedding based on isometric feature mapping (ISOMAP), the
problem of assessing and predicting protein interactions is recasted
into the form of measuring similarity between points of its metric
space. Then a reliability index, a likelihood indicating the interaction
of two proteins, is assigned to each protein pair in the PPI networks
based on the similarity between the points in the embedded space.
Validation of the proposed method is performed with extensive
experiments on densely connected and sparse PPI network of yeast,
respectively. Results demonstrate that the interactions ranked top
by our method have high-functional homogeneity and localization
coherence, especially our method is very efficient for large sparse
PPI network with which the traditional algorithms fail. Therefore, the
proposed algorithm is a much more promising method to detect both
false positive and false negative interactions in PPI networks.

1 INTRODUCTION

Over the last decade, the development of novel high—throughput
techniques has resulted in a rapid accumulation of data that provide
a global description of the whole network of protein—protein
interaction (PPI) for many organisms (Chua and Wong, 2008). Many
essential cellular processes such as cellular metabolism, controlling
the function of enzymes, transport and most regulatory mechanisms
rely on physical interactions between proteins. Therefore, the
interactome analysis is expected to obtain biological insights and
enable us to collect comprehensive knowledge for the control
mechanism and organization of a living cell (Rual et al., 2005).

This motivates researchers to utilize the interactome to study
the disease mechanisms at a system level. However, the high—
throughput methods are prone to a high rate of false—positives and
false—negatives, i.e. protein interactions which are identiﬁed by the
experiment do not take place in the cell or interacting protein pairs
can not be identiﬁed by current experiment technology. For example,
it has shown that the false positive (FP) rate of high—throughput yeast
two—hybrid assays is ~50% (Sprinzak et al., 2003). The rate of false
negative (FN) is also very high (Chua et al., 2006). Thus it is highly
desired to develop computational techniques to assess the reliability
of protein interactions and predict new interactions of PPI network.
Many such techniques have emerged recently (Albert and Albert,
2004; Chua et al., 2006; Saito et al., 2003; Valencia and Pazos,
2002).

Currently, the available methods for assessing and predicting
protein interactions can be divided into four categories: (i) functional
homogeneity or localization coherence based methods. The main
idea of these approaches is to utilize the supporting evidence from
the biological perspective to assess the reliability of an interacting
protein pair (Chua et al., 2006). For example, if two proteins are
localized in the same cellular component or have a common cellular
role, the reliability that these two proteins interact with each other
is high. (ii) Methods based on information integration (Bader et al.,
2004; Patil and Nakamura, 2005). For example, via using Bayesian
network approach, Li et al. combined multiple heterogeneous
biological evidences, including gene expression, genome context,
functional annotation, interaction domain and network topology
structure, to assign reliability scores to the human PPIs identiﬁed

by high—throughput experiments (Li et al., 2008). (iii) Experiment
reproducibility—based methods. These methods are based on the
reasonable assumption that an interaction that is observed in two
or more independent experiments is more reliable than one that is
observed in just one experiment (Chua et al., 2006; Hart et al., 2007).

However, the aforementioned methods cannot be implemented
if the prior knowledge about the individual proteins, such as the
information of sequence, structure or chemical properties, is not
available. In order to overcome the weakness of these methods, some
researchers developed the network topology based methods (the
fourth category) (Albert and Albert, 2004; Deng et al., 2003; Liu,
et al., 2008; Saito et al., 2003; Sharan et al., 2007). The main idea of
these approaches is to rank the reliability of an interaction between
a pair of proteins primarily using the topology of the interactions
between that protein pair and their neighbors within a short ‘radius’
(Chua and Wong, 2008). The methods for the repuriﬁcation of
the experimentally derived interactomes from the topology of PPI
networks utilize the observation that a pair of genuine interacting
proteins is generally expected to have a common cellular role and
proteins that have common interaction partners have a high chance
of sharing a common function.

More speciﬁcally, Saito et al. developed two indices called 1G1
and IG2 which use the local topology of a pair of proteins to
rank their interaction probability (Saito et al., 2003). Chen et al.
introduced a novel measure called IRAP for assessing the reliability
of protein interaction based on the underlying topology of the PPI
network (Chen et al., 2005). Similarly, an index called Functional
Similarity Weight Index (FSWeight) was ﬁrst introduced by Chua
et al. to predict protein functions. It can be used to assess protein
interactions and it usually outperformed IG and IRAP on large—
scale protein interaction networks (Chua et al., 2006). Another
simple measure is the Czekanowski—Dice distance (CD—DIST) which
was originally introduced to predict the protein function (Brun
et al., 2003). Although these measures assess the reliability of an
interaction between protein pairs by relying purely on the topology
of PPI networks, they are very effective (Chen et al., 2005; Chua
et al., 2006; Saito et al., 2003).

However, the major shortcoming of using indices like IQ IRAP,
CD—DIST and FSWeight to assess and predict protein interactions is
that their performance will deteriorate rapidly when they are applied
to the sparse PPI network (Chua and Wong, 2008). It is well known
that PPI networks are typically very sparse, with average degree
of 7 or less (Colak et al., 2009). Therefore, computational analysis
techniques for assessing and predicting protein interactions, whose
performance is independent on the sparseness of the PPI network,
are highly desired.

As is well known, proteins interact with other proteins
based on their limited number of biochemical and structural
properties (Terradot et al., 2004). These properties can be
represented mathematically as the dimensions of some abstract
metric space. Therefore, PPI networks may lie on or near some
low—dimensional manifold embedded in the high—dimensional
unorganized observation space.

Our aim in this paper is to develop a technology based on manifold
learning theory (Belkin and Niyogi, 2003; Donoho and Grimes,
2003; Law and Jain, 2006; Lin et al., 2006; Roweis and Saul,
2000; Saul and Roweis, 2004; Tenenbaum et al., 2000; Weinberger
and Saul, 2006; Xiang et al., 2009) to seek a low—dimensional
embedding of the nodes of PPI network (graph), which recasts the

problem of assessing and predicting protein interactions into the
form of measuring similarity between points in its metric space.
The embedding is reasonable if it assigns to nodes of a PPI network
a set of point in a low—dimensional space such that adjacent nodes
in the PPI network correspond to points that are close in the low—
dimensional space, whereas non—adj acent nodes correspond to points
that are further away in the low—dimensional space. Given such
an embedding, we assign an interacting score which indicates the
reliability of two proteins to interact with each other, to each protein
pair in the PPI networks based on the similarity between the points
in the embedded space.

We compare our method with a couple of existing approaches and
show that our method is able to achieve a satisﬁed performance in
both densely connected and sparse PPI network, especially it is very
efﬁcient for large sparse PPI network with which the traditional
algorithms fail. The success at detecting both new and spurious
interactions conﬁrms that the proposed model is able to uncover
the structural features of the true PPI network.

2 ALGORITHM

In this section, we outline the main idea behind the algorithm.
The ﬂowchart of our method is shown in Figure 1. First we
described the embedding algorithm ISOMAP (isometric feature
mapping) (Roweis and Saul, 2000; Tenenbaum et al., 2000), which
is responsible for ﬁnding a network null model for PPI networks.
Then we show how to make the identiﬁcation of both FP interactions
and FN interactions by calculating the reliability index (RI) of
each protein pair based on the similarity between the points in the
embedded space.

2.1 Manifold embedding

Finding a well—ﬁtting null model for PPI networks is a fundamental
problem and such null model will provide insights into the interplay
between network structure and biological function (Higham et al.,
2008). Many researches show that geometric random graphs are a
good model for PPI networks (Przulj, 2007; Przulj et al., 2004).
In a geometric random graph, nodes of PPI network can be
represented by uniformly randomly distributed points in a metric
space and the connection information in PPI network can be
indicated by the distance in the metric space, i.e. if two nodes
are adjacent in the PPI network, the corresponding points are

close enough in the metric space. We take an alternative view of
manifold embedding to develop an efﬁcient algorithm that models
PPI networks. It is based on ISOMAP (Tenenbaum et al., 2000).
Our algorithm only utilizes the connectivity information between
the nodes of PPI network and embeds the nodes of the network into
a metric space so that the topological structure of the network can
be faithfully preserved. That is, the spatial proximity of the points
in the embedded space corresponds to the PPI network connectivity
information.

ISOMAP attempts to ﬁnd a low—dimensional embedding where
the distances between points is approximately equal to the shortest
path distances (on a neighborhood graph in the original input space).
The power of ISOMAP can be demonstrated by the 3D ‘Swiss roll’
dataset (Fig. 2). Although ISOMAP is originally designed for non—
linear dimensionality reduction, here we show that it is suitable
for applying to the low—distortion PPI network (graph) embedding
problem. The framework of manifold embedding algorithm based
on ISOMAP is described as follows.

Although real—world PPI networks are generally non—fully
connected, they have one largest connected sub—network, which
contains most of the networks, nodes and edges (>90%, for details
see Supplementary Material). For example, the PPI network of
yeast deposited in BioGrid database has 4927 proteins with 4895 of
them belonging to the largest fully connected sub—network (~99%).
On the other hand, the ISOMAP algorithm requires the analyzed
manifold is a convex subset of RD . Then, the dataset must be an open
connected subset of RD (Donoho and Grimes, 2003). Therefore, the
ISOMAP algorithm can only handle fully connected PPI networks
or the largest connected component of the non—fully connected
ones (Donoho and Grimes, 2003). Finally, embedding non—fully
connected components of a PPI network into low—dimensional space
will result in meaningless spatial overlap. It is difﬁcult to see how
any previous technology which only uses PPI data can predict new
interactions between members of non—fully connected components.
Therefore, in this study, the embedding methods require a fully
connected network and only the largest connected component of
the PPI network is used.

2.1.] Constructing neighborhood graph A PPI network can be
naturally modeled as a neighborhood graph G=(V,E), where the
set of vertices V={x1, x2,...,xN} are the proteins, and the set
of edges E = {elj} indicate neighborhood relationships between the
proteins. We introduce the weight matrix W for the graph where the

elements are

I if ei- E E
W-- = J . 1
l] {0 otherwise ( )

This indicates that the edge elj that joins the neighboring points
xi and xj has a weight le21 associated with it. If there is no
edge present between a pair of proteins, the corresponding weight
is zero. The justiﬁcation for choosing {0, 1} weight matrix is
that real PPI networks contain only the connectivity information
between the nodes, and each edge in the neighborhood graph
should be treated equally. By constructing neighborhood graph, the
connectivity information of PPI network can be naturally inherited
and the topological structure of PPI network can be faithfully kept.

2.1.2 Computing geodesic distances We estimate the geodesic
distances d,:,- between pairs of nodes by graph distances dig; with
respect to the neighborhood graph G. The graph distances are the
shortest path distances between all pairs of points in the graph
G. Points that are not neighbors of each other are connected by
a sequence of neighbor—to—neighbor links, and the length of this
path (sum of the link weights) is taken to approximate the distance
between its endpoints on the manifold. If the data points are
sampled from a probability distribution that is supported by the entire
manifold, then, as the density of data points tend to inﬁnity, it turns
out that the estimated dig; converges to dij if the manifold is ﬂat.
The shortest path between every pair of vertices in a graph can be
computed by means of the Dijkstra’s or the Floyd’s algorithm (Gall
and Pallottino, 1988).

2.1.3 Manifold embedding Let DG 2 {dg} denote the symmetric
N X N —matrix of graph distances. We apply Multidimensional
Scaling (MDS) to the matrix of graph distances DG with the purpose
of ﬁnding an embedding of the PPI network in a d—dimensional
feature space Y, so that the geodesic distances between nodes are
preserved as much as possible.

2.2 Calculating the interacting R1 of protein pairs

We assign RI, a likelihood indicating the interaction of two proteins,
to each protein pair in the PPI networks on the basis of the

similarity between the points in the embedded space. The RI for
protein interactions is formulated based on the observation that a
pair of proteins having many common neighbors is more likely to
have similar physical and biochemical properties and thus the two
proteins are more likely to interact with each other. This seems
to make biological sense since two proteins will require some
similar biochemical properties to dock to a particular binding site
on a common neighbor, and are likely to participate in similar
pathways if they interact with similar type of proteins. This means
the larger the proportion of interaction partners which two proteins
have in common, the higher the RI is. A criterion of such an index
is the FSWeight, originally designed for the purpose of protein
function prediction from interaction network (Chua et al., 2006).
The FSWeight FS(x, y) of a pair of proteins x and y is deﬁned as

2IN(x)hN(y)I
|N(x)I+IN(x)0N(y)I+kx,y
X 2IN(x)hN(y)I
IN(y)I+IN(x)0N(y)I+kx,y
_ 2IN(x)hN(y)I
_ |N(x)—N(y)l+2IN(x)0N(y)I+kx,y
X 2IN(x)hN(y)I
IN(y)—N(x)l+2IN(x)0N(y)I+ky,x

where N (x) is the set of neighbors of node x. N (x)ﬂN (y) is the
interaction partners that proteins x and y have in common. My 2
max(0,NAVG — (|Nx—Nyl—I— |Nx ﬂNy|)) is a parameter to modify
similarity weights of protein pairs when the proteins have very few
neighbors. We can see the larger the RI is, the more likely the two
proteins interact with each other.

It is reasonable to use this deﬁnition in our study. First, the
common interaction partners are positively correlated with the real
interaction probability between a pair of proteins. The FSWeight
measure also utilizes the proportion of interaction partners that two
proteins have for protein function prediction. Second, it has been
proven that protein pairs which have high—FSWeight values are more
likely to have a common Gene Ontology (GO) terms (Chua et al.,
2006). This is likely to be a consequence of the protein interaction.
More importantly, FSWeight makes it possible to take into account
the topology information carried not only by the nearest neighbors
in the embedded space, but also by points two edges away. The
procedure of calculating RI consists of the following steps.

function learned from the data given by the manifold embedding.
Then we evaluate the performance of the proposed approach by
carrying out experiments on the densely connected and sparse PPI
networks respectively.

3.1 PPI networks

We verify the proposed approach on the model organism
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The PPI datasets of S.cerevisiae
are downloaded from the Krogan Lab Interactome Database
(http://interactome—cmp.ucsf.edul). The database contains many
protein interactions curated from Krogan et al. (2006), Gavin et al.
(2006) and Collins et al. (2007) combined. We assessed only
heterodimers and considered the interactions of protein A (bait)—
protein B (prey) and of protein B (bait)—protein A (prey) to represent
a single interaction (these represent bidirectional interactions in a
two—hybrid experiment). Two yeast protein interaction datasets are
used in this study for computational validation. One is the densely
connected protein interaction network which comprises of 29 922
non—redundant interactions between 3883 of yeast proteins and the
other is the sparse protein interaction network which comprises of
12 934 non—redundant interactions between 3645 of yeast proteins.

3.2 The distribution of pair-wise distance in embedded
space for interactions and non-interactions

In order to quantify the success of embedding the PPI
network into the low—dimensional metric space, we build two
probability density functions based on the densely connected PPI
networks and its embedded space: p(Similarity|Interaction) and
p(Similarity|Non—interaction). The p(Similarity|Interaction) is the
probability density function which describes the distribution of pair—
wise similarities (i.e. the reciprocal of Euclidean distance in the
embedded space) between pairs of proteins which are known to
interact. The p(Similarity |Non—interaction) is the probability density
function which describes the distribution of pair—wise similarities
between pairs of proteins which do not interact with each other.
We can see from Figure 3 that the functions
p(Similarity |Interaction ) and p(Similarity |Non—interaction )
have different distribution and the difference between them is
signiﬁcant. More importantly, we ﬁnd that the interacting protein

pairs in the original PPI network are usually very close in its
corresponding embedded space while the non—interacting protein
pairs in original PPI network are usually far away in the embedded
space (for details see Supplementary Materials: S1—S9). It means
that the PPI networks are well represented by embedding them into
a low—dimensional metric space and the topological structure of the
network can be faithfully preserved. Also the difference between
these two functions proves it is reasonable to classify pairs of
nodes into interactions and non—interactions based on the similarity
between them in the embedded spaces.

3.3 The ROC curves for embedding PPI network into
metric space

To measure the ability of the proposed manifold embedding method
to recover the densely connected PPI network, we draw a ROC
curve shown in Figure 4. The x—axis of ROC curve is deﬁned as
1—speciﬁcity and the y—axis is deﬁned as sensitivity. Speciﬁcity and
sensitivity are two commonly used measures of the performance of
a binary classiﬁcation test, and they are deﬁned as follows

 

Speciﬁcity:

 

and Sensitivity:

TN
(4)
TN+FP TP+FN

where TP (true positive) is the number of true interacting protein
pairs which are predicted to be interacting (the distance between
point pair in embedded space is less than a given threshold). TN
(true negative) is the number of non—interacting protein pairs that
are predicted to be non—interacting (the distance between point pair
in embedded space is larger than a given threshold). FF is the number
of non—interacting protein pairs which are predict to be interacting,
and FN is the number of interacting protein pairs which are predicted
to be non—interacting. The ROC curves are obtained by varying the
threshold 8 from 0 to the maximum distance between the points in
the embedded space.

In Figure 4, we present nine ROC curves for the cases where
the original PPI network is embedded into different dimensional
embedded space. A ROC curve is considered as having good
performance if it rises rapidly, containing points close to x20,
y=1 and the area under it is close to 1. From Figure 3, we can
see that the performances of the ROC curves are excellent, which
means that the structure of the original PPI network is faithfully
preserved by its corresponding low—dimensional space. For example,
the sensitivity and speciﬁcity of ROC curve can reach 93% and 92%,

respectively, when PPI network is embedded into 10—dimensional
spaces. This corresponds to the FN rate ,8:1—Sensitivity=7%
and the FP rate a = 1 — speciﬁcity = 8%. Meanwhile, for dimension
10 of the embedding space, the area under ROC curve is 0.97232
(see Supplementary Materials: S19). Note that here we regard only
those protein interactions in our used PPI dataset as true interactions.
However, TAP and Y2H FP and FN rates are believed to be at ~64%
and 50% correspondingly (Edwards et al., 2004), so using the PPI
dataset as the golden standard may underrate the performance of
ROC curve. The actual performance of the embedding should be
better than what we reported here.

As can be seen from Figure 4, with the decreasing of the embedded
space dimension the performance of the ROC curve is only slightly
worse, which means the choice of dimension is not crucial for the
manifold embedding (for details see Supplementary Materials: S21).
Therefore, the PPI network is well modeled by low—dimensional
embedding metric space and the value of dimensionality does not
change the performance much.

3.4 Assessing the reliability of interactions in densely
connected PPI networks

In this section, we evaluate the performance of the proposed
method in the case of embedding into the 10—dimensional space,
and compare it with IG2 (Saito et al., 2003), IRAP (Chen et al.,
2005), FSWeight (Chua et al., 2006), CD—DIST (Brun et al., 2003)
approaches in term of functional homogeneity and localization
coherence in a densely connected PPI networks.

By the ‘guilt—by—association’ principle (Oliver, 2000), we expect
that as the TP interactions increase in the resulting interactome
processed by the proposed method, the proportion of interacting
proteins with functional homogeneity and localization coherence
should increase correspondingly. Here we use cellular component
annotations in GO (see http://www.geneontology.orgl) for the
localization coherence annotation and the GO terms of biological
process and molecular function for functional homogeneity
annotation. Among the 3883 proteins in our densely connected yeast
dataset, 3775 proteins have functional annotations and 3770 proteins
have cellular component annotations (for details see Supplementary
Material).

We rank interactions according to their RI values from the
highest to the lowest, and measure the functional homogeneity and
localization coherence by computing the rate of interacting protein
pairs with common function roles and cellular localization. Figure 5
shows the functional homogeneity and localization coherence
performance of the interactions in our densely connected yeast
dataset ranked using aforementioned ﬁve methods. It can be seen
that the proportion of interacting proteins with a common functional
role increases in RI—ﬁltered interaction data. The similar effect is
observed for common cellular localization too. We notice that all
of the ﬁve methods can achieve a signiﬁcant improvement although
they just use the topological information of networks instead of
annotation or repeatability information. As can be seen, the CD—
DIST identiﬁed more interactions that have common functional role
and cellular localization than any other methods did in the top 40%.
FSWeight shows a comparable performance in the top 40%, but
its performance is the best after the top 40%. The IG2 performs
the worst among the ﬁve methods. Our method signiﬁcantly
outperforms the IG2 and IRAP methods in the comparison and

achieves comparable performance with the CD—DIST and FSWeight
methods.

3.5 Assessing the reliability of interactions in sparse
PPI networks

In densely connected PPI networks, the proposed method
outperformed the IG2 and IRAP, but a little bit weaker than the
CD—DIST and FSWeight methods. As is well known, one main
drawback of using indices like IG2, IRAP, CD—DIST and FSWeight
to assess the reliability of protein interactions is that the performance
of these approaches deteriorate when the input interaction network
gets sparse (Chua and Wong, 2008). In other words, all of these
methods have inherent limitation when they are applied to a sparse
PPI network.

However, the real PPI networks are typically very sparse, with
average degree of 7 or less (Colak et al., 2009) (for details see
Supplementary Materials). To deal with this challenge, the approach
based on manifold embedding, whose performance is independent
on the network sparseness, is developed to assess the reliability
of protein interaction and predict new interactions. The proposed
approach can overcome aforementioned shortcomings.

We here apply our method to assess the reliability of interactions
in the sparse PPI network in the case of embedding into the
10—dimensional space. Then we compare the performance of the
proposed method with that of FSWeight, CD—DIST, IG2 and
IRAP approach in term of functional homogeneity and localization

coherence in sparse PPI networks. We rank interactions according
to their RI values in the same manner as we did in the last section,
and measure the functional homogeneity and localization coherence
by computing the rate of interacting protein pairs with common
function roles and cellular localization.

As can be seen in Figure 6, the proposed method is the best
in assessing FP interactions in the sparse yeast dataset—as more
interactions which were detected as potential FP interaction were
removed from the interactions, the degree of functional homogeneity
and localization coherence in the resulting interactome increases at a
faster rate than using other ﬁve methods. The second best approach
in the comparison is IG2 method. The IRAP, FSWeight and CD—
DIST methods seem to be less effective with the sparse interaction
datasets.

Since IG2, IRAP, FSWeight and CD—DIST methods are built
on the basis of the topology of the neighbors of the protein pairs
and their formulation implicitly requires the protein pairs being
considered to have sufﬁcient number of partners (Wong and Liu,
2010), the limited direct and indirect interactions in sparse network
lead to their poor performances (Chen et al., 2006). However,
in our manifold embedding method, some potential connection
information, which is very important for methods based on topology
to attain good performance, is discovered by preserving local

geometry structure. Therefore, we argue that the proposed method
is independent on the network sparseness.

3.6 Predicting new protein interactions in sparse PPI
networks

Similarly, for FN detection, we inspect whether the top new
interactions predicted by our method exhibit a higher degree
of functional homogeneity and localization coherence than those
predicted using FSWeigh, CD—DIST, IRAP and IG2 approaches.

In our experiment, the number of possible pairs of nodes that were
assigned RI value of 0.952 or higher is ~1300. We investigated
the biological signiﬁcance of these PPI prediction results using
the GO terms. Figure 7 shows the functional homogeneity and
localization coherence of the new interactions predicted by our
method in the case of embedding into the 10—dimensional space,
IG2, IRAP, FSWeight and CD—DIST methods. As can be seen, the
new interactions predicted by our method are indeed of better quality
than the corresponding sets predicted by IG2, IRAP, FSWeight
and CD—DIST. Comparatively speaking, IG2 method performs the
worst among the ﬁve methods and our method is the best among
them. For example, Figure 7 compares the proposed method to
the IRAP, IG2, FSWeight and CD—DIST on the sparse interaction
dataset. In terms of function homogeneity, it can be seen from

Figure 7(A) that ~58% and 72.5% of the top 1100 predicted
interacting pairs ranked according to IG2 and IRAP, respectively,
have a common function, and >75% of the top 1100 predicted pairs
ranked by FSWeight and CD—DIST share common function. By
comparison, over 85% of the top 1200 predicted interacting pairs
ranked according to the proposed method have a common function.
Therefore, the proposed method outperforms IG2, IRAP, CD—DIST
and FSWeight in functional homogeneity. Likewise, as shown
in Figure 7(B), the proposed method exhibit better localization
coherence than IG2, IRAP, FSWeight and CD—DIST, with CD—DIST
further outperforming IG2, FSWeight and IRAP.

Note that the probability of two proteins in an edge in the sparse
dataset being in the same cellular location is <77.06%. It can be
seen from Figure 7 that proteins in the 1300 top—ranked edges by
our method have >90.5% probability of being in the same cellular
locations and thus they are much more likely to be capable of real
interactions in vivo than other edges in the dataset. For the functional
homogeneity, the probabilities in the sparse dataset and predicted
protein interactions are 85.4% and 85.7%, respectively.

In order to further evaluate the biological signiﬁcant of the new
predicted protein interaction pairs, we compare the 1300 predicted
protein pairs with protein pairs in STRING database. STRING
is a database of known and predicted protein interactions, which
integrate multiple information like sequence, expression and so on.
We count how many of 1300 (with RI 2 0.95) predicted protein pairs
can be found in STRING database. The number of proteins involved
in the 1300 predicted protein pairs is 806. There are ~12 369 PPI
pairs for these 806 proteins in the STRING database. We found that
out of our 1300 high—conﬁdence predictions, 345 protein pairs (i.e.
~26.5%) also have interaction in STRING database. Considering
the STRING database is one of the most complete known and
predicted PPI databases and a huge amount of possible protein
pairs between the involved 806 proteins (~324 415), such overlap
between our new predicted protein pairs and STRING database
is extremely unlikely to have happened at random. The statistical
signiﬁcance of this result (P—value) is <7.43841964979527E—
183 (see Supplementary Materials for details). Therefore, the
success rates for predicting such new interactions are particularly
encouraging.

4 CONCLUSION

In this article, we have developed a robust technique to assess and
predict protein interactions from high—throughput experimental data
using manifold embedding. The proposed approach ﬁrst transformed
the PPI network into a low—dimensional metric space based on
ISOMAP algorithm, and then a RI which indicates the interacting
likelihood of two proteins is assigned to every protein pair in the
PPI networks on the basis of the similarity between the points in
the embedded space. The experimental results show our method
outperforms the existing methods no matter assessing or predicting
interactions when a sparse PPI network is used. Our method is
better than IG2 and IRAP, and has a comparable performance with
CD—DIST and FSWeight method when a densely connected PPI
network is used. We demonstrate that the proposed approach might
shed more light on assessing and predicting protein interaction
in both densely connected and sparse PPI networks. It should be
noticed that our method solely use the PPI network topology to
assess and predict interactions. It is a complementary to those

methods which use other biological information for assessing and
predicting protein interactions. In the future work, we will integrate
the PPI network topology information with other data source to
improve the performance of assessing and predicting the protein
interactions. In the scoring section, we use a simple method to
calculate the reliable index. However, it is possible to utilize a more
sophisticated method to achieve better performance.

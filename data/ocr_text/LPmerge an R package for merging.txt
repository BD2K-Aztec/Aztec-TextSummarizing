ABSTRACT

Summary: Consensus genetic maps constructed from multiple popu-
lations are an important resource for both basic and applied research,
including genome-wide association analysis, genome sequence as-
sembly and studies of evolution. The LPmerge software uses linear
programming to efficiently minimize the mean absolute error between
the consensus map and the linkage maps from each population. This
minimization is performed subject to linear inequality constraints that
ensure the ordering of the markers in the linkage maps is preserved.
When marker order is inconsistent between linkage maps, a minimum
set of ordinal constraints is deleted to resolve the conflicts.
Availability and implementation: LPmerge is on CRAN at http://cran.
r-project.org/web/packages/LPmerge.

1 INTRODUCTION

Broadly speaking, two types of strategies have been used to con-
struct genetic maps across multiple populations. One is to min-
imize an objective function based on the observed recombination
frequencies between markers, analogous to the strategy used
for linkage mapping in a single population. Examples of this
approach include the software packages JoinMap (Van Ooijen,
2006) and MultiPoint (Ronin et al., 2012). The second strategy is
to work directly with the component linkage maps instead of the
underlying recombination frequencies, which can lead to signifi-
cant gains in computational efﬁciency without compromising
map accuracy ONenzl et al., 2006). This second strategy is used
by the software package MergeMap Wu et al., 2011), which has
been used in several different species (Gautami et al., 2012; Khan
et al., 2012; Muﬁoz-Amatriain et al., 2011).

Endelman (2011) identified a weakness in MergeMap and pro-
posed an alternative algorithm for merging linkage maps based
on linear programming (LP), which was incorporated into an
R package called DAGGER. The accuracy of the LP algorithm
was validated on simulated data, and in comparison with
MergeMap using real barley data was found to have lower
mean-squared error on a genome-wide basis (Endelman, 2011).
A significant limitation of DAGGER was that it required the

component linkage maps to have a consistent marker order. In
practice, the linkage maps from different populations often have
ordering conﬂicts, even when there is a single physical order,
because of genotyping errors and statistical errors arising from
the use of small populations. Another weakness of DAGGER
was that the length of the consensus genetic map was shrunken
compared with the original linkage maps.

Both of these limitations have been overcome to create a new
R package called LPmerge, which is available on CRAN. The
LP algorithm has been reformulated without graph theory to
eliminate shrinkage of the consensus map, and a new algorithm
for resolving ordinal conﬂicts between linkage maps has been
added. The objectives of this Applications Note are to describe
these modifications and to illustrate the performance of the
conﬂict resolution algorithm.

2 ALGORITHM

2.1 Consensus map error

In the first step of LPmerge, markers are assigned to bins. If in
every map where two markers were jointly mapped they co-
segregated (had the same map position), they are placed in the
same bin. Because of some markers co-segregating in one map
but not in another, a single linkage map bin may be represented
by multiple consensus map bins. Map positions in the ith linkage
map are denoted by 32,-, and consensus map positions are denoted
by x. Within linkage map i, the markers are ordered from j = l to
M ,-, and the map distance between the jth and (j + q)th markers is
y,(j+q)—y,-(j). Letting u(j;i) denote the consensus map bin con-
taining marker j from map i, the corresponding distance in the
consensus map for these two markers is x(u(j + q;i))—x(u(j;i)). The
absolute error between the consensus map and the ith linkage
map for this interval is thus

Ei,j,q = |[X(u(l' + 61; 1)) — x(“(J'; i))] — [WU + 61) — yi(i)]| (1)

The total error between the consensus map and the linkage
maps is a sum over maps (i), markers (1') and interval sizes (q):

E—iWN—lifa (2)
— l i 1:159
i=1

61:1 i=1

where T is the number of linkage maps and K is the maximum
interval size. At the end of a linkage map, when the sum j+q
exceeds Mi, this expression is evaluated as if the linkage maps
were circular rather than linear. For example, when j=M,-—1

and q = 3, the expression j+q evaluates to 2. These ‘wrap-around’
error terms keep the total consensus map length commensurate
with the average linkage map length. The normalization factor

Mi
Nﬁ=K§:1
j:1

is the number of error terms for map i, and W, is a set of possible
weights for the average (W, = l for unweighted). The maximum
interval size K can be varied to produce different consensus
maps, and additional criteria can be used to select one. A tutorial
illustrating this process is available at http://potatobreeding.cals.

2.2 Resolving marker order conﬂicts

When minimizing the error [Equation (2)], it is desirable that the
consensus map be as consistent as possible with the linkage maps
in terms of marker order. This is achieved through the use of
linear inequalities. For a pair of adjacent linkage map bins (v,w),
each with a single consensus map bin, the corresponding con-
straint is x(w) — x(v) Z 0. When the linkage map bins contain
multiple consensus map bins, constraints are added for every
combination of the consensus map bins. The total set of ordinal
constraints can be written in matrix notation as Ax Z 0.

If there are conﬂicts in marker order between the maps being
merged, the linear system AX Z 1 will be infeasible. Finding the
minimum number of constraints to remove to achieve feasibility
is NP-hard (Amaldi and Kann, 1995). LPmerge uses a polyno-
mial-time approximation from Chinneck (2001) (Algorithm 1),
which is based on the idea of elasticizing constraints. The elastic
LP corresponding to Ax Z 1 is

min bi

x,b l.

Ax+b21 (3
b 2 0

where b represents the elastic variables, and the objective is to
minimize their sum. The algorithm proceeds by finding which
constraint (row of A) leads to the lowest elastic sum when
removed. This constraint is then removed, and the procedure is
repeated. When the algorithm eliminates a constraint and finds
the elastic sum is zero, then that subsystem is feasible and the
algorithm stops.

2.3 LP problem

After removing the ordinal conﬂicts in A, linear programming is
used to find a consensus map with minimum error (see
Supplementary Material online).

3 RESULTS

Figure 1 illustrates the performance of the conﬂict resolution
algorithm on a toy problem from the LPmerge reference
manual. Four linkage maps have been merged (I—IV), each
with seven markers (A—G). Map 1 represents the true marker
order, and in the other maps the order of two adjacent markers

Fig. 1. Toy problem illustrating the ability of LPmerge to resolve marker
order conﬂicts (shown in red). Map I represents the correct order, which
is recovered by LPmerge

has been inverted (highlighted in red) to represent mapping
errors from the single population analyses. LPmerge correctly
identifies the outliers from each map and eliminates them, as
documented in the session log output:

Eliminated following constraints
Map II: C < B

Map III: G < F

Map IV: B < A

Unlike other map-merging algorithms, LPmerge removes in-
equality constraints rather than markers to resolve conﬂicts.
The consensus map returned by LPmerge for this toy problem
has the correct marker order and distances (Fig. 1).

ABSTRACT

Summary: DNA replication, a central event for cell proliferation, is
the basis of biological inheritance. The identification of replication
origins helps to reveal the mechanism of the regulation of DNA
replication. However, only few eukaryotic replication origins were
characterized not long ago; nevertheless, recent genome-wide
approaches have boosted the number of mapped replication origins.
To gain a comprehensive understanding of the nature of eukaryotic
replication origins, we have constructed a Database of Eukaryotic
ORls (DeOri), which contains all the eukaryotic ones identified
by genome-wide analyses currently available. A total of 16145
eukaryotic replication origins have been collected from 6 eukaryotic
organisms in which genome-wide studies have been performed,
the replication-origin numbers being 433, 7489, 1543, 148, 348
and 6184 for humans, mice, Arabidopsis thaliana, Kluyveromyces
lactis, Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Drosophila melanogaster,
respectively.

Availability: Database of Eukaryotic ORls (DeOri) can be accessed

1 INTRODUCTION

The initiation of replication is the central event in the cell cycle.
In all three domains of life, DNA replication begins at specialized
loci termed replication origins. In bacteria, replication initiates from
a single replication origin, whereas eukaryotic organisms exploit
many replication origins (Costas et al., 2011). In eukaryotes, the
origins of DNA replication in the budding yeast Saccharomyces
cerevisiae and ﬁssion yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe have been
well-characterized (Hayashi et al., 2007; Heichinger et al., 2006;
Nieduszynski et al., 2007; Segurado et al., 2003). Recently, a
high-resolution genome—wide map of DNA replication origins in
Kluyveromyces lactis has also been generated (Liachko et al.,
2010). However, only few origins were characterized in the
genomes of higher eukaryotes not long ago. Fortunately, recent
development of genome-wide approaches has led to a boost in the
number of replication origins that have been mapped in eukaryotic
genomes, including those in human (Cadoret et al., 2008; Karnani
et al., 2010), mouse (Cayrou et al., 2011; Sequeira—Mendes et al.,
2009), Arabidopsis thaliana (Costas et al., 2011) and Drosophila
melanogaster (Cayrou et al., 2011). The availability of increasing
origins throughout the genomes has created opportunities for
analysis of the origins on a genome scale. Up to date, the DNA

replication origin database for budding yeast (Nieduszynski et al.,
2007) has been built, whereas the database of other eukaryotic
origins has not been available. In order to gain a comprehensive
understanding of the nature of eukaryotic replication origins, we
have constructed a Database of Eukaryotic ORIs (DeOri), which
contains all the eukaryotic DNA replication origins identiﬁed by
genome-wide analyses currently available.

2 DATABASE CONTENT

All information in DeOri is stored and operated using MySQL
relational database management system. One entry in the database
corresponds to an origin in a certain organism. The corresponding
organism, chromosome, cell type (if any), genomic location, length,
GC content, origin sequence and some related links have been
displayed. In order to facilitate the comparative genomic analysis
and Visualize the chromosome context of the origins, the URLs
that link to UCSC Genome Browser (Fujita et al., 2011) or NCBI
Map Viewer (Sayers et al., 2011) have also been provided. The
database access is Via a web interface based on PHP script and
provides various ways to search for DeOri records, such as DeOri
ID, cell type, species and chromosome. In addition, users can also
BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997) a query sequence against DeOri
to ﬁnd a homologous one. DeOri will be updated timely and a
total of 16 145 eukaryotic DNA replication origins were collected
from 6 eukaryotic organisms in genome-wide studies, including
433 human origins, 7489 mouse origins, 1543 A.thalicma origins,
148 K. lactis origins, 348 S. pombe origins and 6184 D.melcm0gaster
origins in the current release (Table 1), which can be accessed from
http://tubic.tju.edu.cn/de0ri/.

3 DATA RETRIEVAL

The replication origins stored in DeOri include those identiﬁed
in the genomes of human (Cadoret et al., 2008; Karnani et al.,
2010), mouse (Cayrou et al., 2011; Sequeira—Mendes et al., 2009),
A.thaliana (Costas et al., 2011), D.melan0gaster (Cayrou et al.,
2011), Klactis (Liachko et al., 2010) and S.p0mbe (Hayashi et al.,
2007; Heichinger et al., 2006; Segurado et al., 2003). In the human
genome, 283 replication origins have been systematically mapped
using the HeLa S3 suspension cell line (Cadoret et al., 2008) and
in an independent study, 150 new origins have been identiﬁed in
adherent HeLa cells in the ENCODE area (Karnani et al., 2010).
In mouse, identiﬁcation of preferential sites of DNA replication
initiation in 0.4% of the mouse genome has resulted in 97 new
ORIs (Sequeira—Mendes et al., 2009). By performing a genome-wide
analysis in both Drosophila and mouse cell lines, up to 2748 ORIs on
mouse Chromosome 11 (P19 cells) and 6184 ORIs in the Drosophila
genome have been characterized (Cayrou et al., 2011). In A. thaliana,
by high-throughput sequencing of newly synthesized DNA, ~1500
putative have been identiﬁed at the genome-wide level (Costas
et al., 2011). In Klactis, a total of 148 ARSs have been identiﬁed
by a predict-and-verify approach (Liachko et al., 2010). In the
S.p0mbe genome, 385 ORIs have been predicted initially from AT
content calculation (Segurado et al., 2003). Subsequent experiments
have also conﬁrmed most of the prediction (Hayashi et al., 2007;
Heichinger et al., 2006). In addition, the whole genome sequences
of human (hg17), mouse (mm8, mm9), D.melan0gaster (dm2) were
downloaded from http://hgd0wnload.cse.ucsc.edu/downloads.html,
and the whole genome sequences of A. thaliana, S. pombe
and K. lactis were downloaded from the NCBI FTP server
(ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.g0v/gen0mes/). Based on the position information
provided in the literatures or by personal communication and the
corresponding genome sequences, we have obtained the sequences
and other information of the origins. It should be noted that the
positions of the origins in A. thaliana and S.p0mbe have been
relocated and mapped to the newest releases of genome sequences
from GenBank in order to remove the sequencing errors in the
older versions, and the positions of the origins in Mouse_ES_2 have
also been relocated and mapped to the genome sequences of mouse
(mm9) in order to make the UCSC Genome Browser available.

4 CONCLUSION

Consequently, we have constructed a database DeOri, which
contains all the eukaryotic DNA replication origins identiﬁed by
genome-wide analyses currently available. With the availability of
the origins newly identiﬁed by genome-wide analyses, we will
update DeOri constantly to include more entries and integrate
more information for each entry. This database will facilitate the
comparative genomic analysis of replication origins, and provide
some insight into the nature of replication origins on a genome scale.
One of the applications is to predict replication origins based on
homologous sequence search against the origins of closely related
species in DeOri. For example, if query sequences in the rice genome

using BLAST have homologous origins of A. thaliana in DeOri, it is
likely that the query sequences are also served as origins in the rice
genome. Another application is to ﬁnd some principles for speciﬁc
organisms by the genome-wide characterization of the origins in
DeOri, which will be useful to develop new algorithms to predict
replication origins. For example, we can use some tools for motif
discovery to ﬁnd the conserved elements within the origins of a
speciﬁc organism.

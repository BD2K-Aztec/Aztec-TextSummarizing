ABSTRACT

Summary: Protein interaction network-based pathway analysis
(PINBPA) for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has been
developed as a Cytoscape app, to enable analysis of GWAS data in
a network fashion. Users can easily import GWAS summary-level
data, draw Manhattan plots, define blocks, prioritize genes with
random walk with restart, detect enriched subnetworks and test the
significance of subnetworks via a user-friendly interface.

Availability and implementation: PINBPA app is freely available in
Cytoscape app store.

1 INTRODUCTION

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) continue to be a
widely used approach to detect genetic associations with a
phenotype of interest in well-deﬁned populations. As of
September 15, 2014, almost 2000 publications have reported
associations of >13 000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) with close to 200 phenotypes in the GWAS catalog
Welter et al., 2014). The successful record of this genomic map-
ping strategy includes the identiﬁcation of dozens or even hun-
dreds of susceptibility alleles in common diseases, such as
multiple sclerosis (MS), type 1 and type 2 diabetes, lymphomas,
leukemias and metabolic disorders. Despite the unquestionable
utility of this method, most of the data generated by GWAS are
neglected because of the heavy emphasis devoted to eliminate
false discoveries (type I error). Typically, a stringent threshold
(P-value<5 x 10—8) is applied to minimize type I error, thus
inevitably increasing the proportion of false-negative results
(type II error). Although this is a necessary tactic to effectively
evaluate studies testing up to millions of markers individually, a
number of methods that analyze groups of markers simultan-
eously (thus potentially increasing statistical power) have
recently emerged (Huang Da et al., 2009; Khatri et al., 2012;
Lee et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2007; Yaspan et al., 2011). These
approaches, collectively known as pathway analysis, aim at
identifying functional relationships among associated signals.
Given that susceptibility to complex human diseases is likely a
result of genes operating as part of functional modules rather

than individual effects (Lage et al., 2007), pathway analysis
methods hold promise in discovering additional associations
from existing GWAS data.

The most recent class of pathway analysis methods is network
based, and they largely overcome the assumptions of independ-
ence and preselection of reference database that limited its
predecessors. Network-based analyses commonly use a scaffold
of protein interactions to build connections between gene prod-
ucts, where nodes represent proteins and edges represent physical
or functional interactions between pairs of proteins. Rather than
focusing on individual markers, network-based analysis methods
take into account multiple loci in the context of molecular path-
ways. Owing to this critical feature, these methods can afford to
use sub genome-wide statistical signiﬁcance and yet increase the
power to detect new associations and functional relationships
between genes in complex traits. Several network-based methods
have been proposed to identify active modules (subnetworks) in
a given network, such as DAPPLE (Rossin et al., 2011),
deWAS (Jia et al., 2011) and NIMMI (Akula et al., 2011).

The original protein interaction network-based pathway ana-
lysis (PINBPA) method was ﬁrst developed in the context of MS
research (Baranzini et al., 2009) and most recently used to suc-
cessfully identify novel associations by the International MS
Genetics Consortium (International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics
Consortium, 2013). In this article, we introduce the PINBPA app
for Cytoscape (Shannon et al., 2003).

2 IMPLEMENTATION AND FEATURES

PINBPA has been implemented as an app for Cytoscape 3.0 and
later versions using Java. Additionally, R scripts are called via
Rserve inside Cytoscape for plotting.

Like many other pathway analysis methods, PINBPA requires
gene-level summary statistics (P-values), as those generated by
the popular tool VEGAS (Liu et al., 2010). As shown in Figure l,
the PINBPA app directly reads the VEGAS output as input ﬁle
(but other formats are also possible), and has six features: (i)
generates a gene-wise Manhattan plot of the GWAS; (ii) sorts
all genes by their genomic coordinates and deﬁnes association
blocks at any user-deﬁned threshold (P-value< 0.05 by default);
(iii) annotates the user-selected PPI network with imported gene-
wise GWAS P—values; (iv) generates a subnetwork of only
signiﬁcant genes (ﬁrst-order networks) exceeding a user-deﬁned
threshold, and tests the statistical signiﬁcance of the
sub-networks using random permutations; (v) runs network
smoothing (an optional gene prioritization scheme) using a

(vi) detects subnetworks enriched in signiﬁcant genes using either
unweighted (Ideker et at, 2002) or weighted z-scores (W hitlock,
2005). The network z-score is adjusted using 1000 permutations
and then a greedy algorithm (Supplementary File) is applied to
search for the n optimal subnetworks.

3 DISCUSSION

PINBPA is the ﬁrst Cytoscape app designed for network analysis
of GWAS data. Through a user-friendly interface, the PINBPA
app enables genomic researchers and biologists with no compu-
tational expertise to run a powerful and otherwise complex ana-
lytical pipeline. PINBPA is ﬂexible in many ways. First, it
enables the use of any network as scaffold for subsequent ana-
lysis. For example, a user may choose to run PINBPA using a
smaller but high conﬁdence PIN, or a larger network, including
computationally predicted interactions. Additionally, other net-
works such as metabolic, gene co-expression or text mining can
be used. Second, while direct import from VEGAS is available,
any method can be used to convert SNP—level and gene-level P-
values. Third, the user can select the signiﬁcance threshold to
deﬁne association blocks. Although some experimentation may
be needed, this signiﬁcance threshold is typically related to the
power of the GWAS in question (the larger the GWAS, the more
relaxed the P-value for block deﬁnition). Fourth, signiﬁcant
(ﬁrst-order) networks can be generated at any user-selected stat-
istical threshold. Fifth, an optional network smoothing step
allows the user to weight the most signiﬁcant associations differ-
ently. Finally, the size and the signiﬁcance of enriched networks

generated by the greedy algorithm can also be selected, thus
providing maximal control over the ﬁnal output.

In summary, the Cytoscape PINBPA app offers a simple inter-
face to perform a complex set of analyses and can be used under
a wide variety of scenarios, thus empowering genomic scientists
to conduct post-GWAS analysis in a streamlined, rigorous and
reproducible fashion.

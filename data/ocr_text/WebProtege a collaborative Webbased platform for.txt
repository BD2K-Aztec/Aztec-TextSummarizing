ABSTRACT

Summary: WebProtégé is an open-source Web application for editing
OWL 2 ontologies. It contains several features to aid collaboration,
including support for the discussion of issues, change notification
and revision-based change tracking. WebProtégé also features a
simple user interface, which is geared towards editing the kinds of
class descriptions and annotations that are prevalent throughout bio-
medical ontologies. Moreover, it is possible to conﬁgure the user inter-
face using views that are optimized for editing Open Biomedical
Ontology (OBO) class descriptions and metadata. Some of these
views are shown in the Supplementary Material and can be seen in
WebProtégé itself by conﬁguring the project as an OBO project.
Availability and implementation: WebProtégé is freely available for
use on the Web at http://webprotege.stanford.edu. It is implemented
in Java and JavaScript using the OWL API and the Google Web
Toolkit. All major browsers are supported. For users who do not
wish to host their ontologies on the Stanford servers, WebProtégé is
available as a Web app that can be run locally using a Servlet con-
tainer such as Tomcat. Binaries, source code and documentation are
available under an open-source license at http://protegewiki.stanford.
edu/wikiNVebProtege.

1 INTRODUCTION

Ontologies are important artefacts in bioinformatics and life sci-
ences. Many biomedical ontologies, such as the ones made avail-
able in the BioPortal (Noy et al., 2009), the Open Biomedical
Ontology (OBO) Library (Smith et al., 2007) and the OntoBee
platform Oiiang et al., 2011) are published and exchanged as
OWL 2 ontology documents. Furthermore, biomedical ontolo-
gies are typically developed collaboratively by groups of experts
who may receive incremental input from the end-user commu-
nity. However, although there have been some domain-speciﬁc
wiki-based tools for the collaborative editing of biomedical
knowledge (Larson and Martone, 2013), Web-based tool support
for community-based OWL ontology development is severely
lacking. In this article, we present WebProtégé—a Web-based

tool for the collaborative development of OWL 2 ontologies.
Although the latest version of this tool supports the complete
OWL 2 language (Motik et al., 2009), the default conﬁguration
of its customizable user interface (UI) is primarily geared to-
wards lightweight ontology editing [it is possible to conﬁgure
the user interface with OWL 2-speciﬁc Views. Please see
the WebProtégé user guide for more details (http://tinyurl.com/
webprotege-editing—owl)]. In particular, WebProtégé provides
out-of-the-box Views that support a fragment of the language
that is useful for capturing biomedical knowledge and is trad-
itionally catered for by tools such as OBOEdit (Day-Richter
et al., 2007). Moreover, WebProtégé supplies user interface
Views that are optimized for editing the rich OBO-term metadata
and deﬁnitions that are commonly associated with biomedical
ontologies. We believe that these OBO-tailored UI Views along
with collaborative development functionality make WebProtégé
an attractive tool for the community-based development of
biomedical ontologies.

2 COLLABORATION FEATURES

WebProtégé is centred around the notion of a project—a collec-
tion of OWL ontologies, custom user interface conﬁguration
settings and collaboration settings. Projects can either be created
from scratch or they can be initialized with existing ontologies.
Any OWL-compatible ontology, including OBO format
(Mungall et al., 2011) ontologies, may be uploaded and im-
ported. A key aspect of WebProtégé is that it supports multi-
user real-time collaborative ontology development. Once a user
has created a project, they can share it with their collaborators,
adding them as Viewers, commenters or editors. WebProtégé
provides the following features to aid collaboration:

0 Threaded Discussions—Threaded discussions allow issues to
be tracked and associated with terms and change sets. Issues
can be marked as being ‘open’ and can then be ‘resolved’
when they have been addressed.

0 Watches—Users can keep an eye on changes to the ontol-
ogy, changes that modify a description of a particular term
or changes that modify hierarchy branches and descriptions
of terms in branches. Notiﬁcations of changes are sent to
users Via email with direct links to the terms that were
changed.

0 Change Tracking and Versioning—WebProtégé is built on
top of the OWL API, which means that it can take

advantage of a precisely deﬁned notion of ontology changes
and ontology change lists. Change lists, which correspond to
operations in the user interface, are stored along with vari-
ous metadata about which user enacted the changes, the
timestamp of the changes and the ﬁne-grained details
of the changes. All project changes are tracked, and
WebProtégé allows users to download any previous version
or revision of an ontology, making it possible to compare
different versions using tools such as Bubastis (Malone
et al., 2010) or Ecco (Gonqalves et al., 2012).

3 AN OBO FRIENDLY UI

The WebProtégé user interface is customizable, and users can
arrange individual Views (known as ‘portlets’) to suit their
needs. We provide several out-of-the-box Views that are specif-
ically designed for editing biomedical, OBO-Style, ontologies.
Heavily inspired by OBOEdit widgets, many of these Views
shield the user from the verbose and intricate OWL representa-
tion of OBO format constructs. Some of these Views are
described below.

0 0 TermId View: presents a user-friendly OBO Id and Name
for the selected term and hides the under-the-hood represen-
tation of term Ids (IRIs).

o 9 Term Definition View: obviates the need for the user to
know what the correct ‘deﬁnition’ OWL annotation prop-
erty (IAO_0000115) is, and manages the database cross-ref-
erence annotations on the OWL annotation assertion that
speciﬁes the term deﬁnition.

0 6 Synonyms View: manages the speciﬁcation of synonyms,
the scope of these synonyms and database cross references
for them.

0 9 Relationships View: simple OBO relationships correspond
to OWL ObjectSomeValuesFrom restrictions that are super-
class expressions of the subject term. This View manages the
SubClassOf relationship and ObjectSomeValuesFrom re-
strictions under the hood, meaning that users do not need
to know about these OWL constructs. Furthermore, auto-
completion (O) assists the user in typing in correct property
names and term names.

0 6 Cross-Products View: similar to the Relationships
View, this View manages EquivalentClasses axioms and the
bundling of component relationships, represented by
ObjectSomeValuesFrom restrictions, into intersection
classes.

4 IMPLEMENTATION

WebProtégé is based on the OWL API (Horridge and Bechhofer,
2011). This API is widely used by people that need programmatic
access to OWL ontologies, and it is the basis of other widely used

tools such as Protégé (Horridge et al., 2006), services such as the
module and diff analysis tools (Gonqalves et al., 2012; Malone
et al., 2010) and OBO workﬂow tools such as the OBO Ontology
Release Tool. For loading and processing OBO ontologies, we
use the OBO format tools, which provide a ‘reference’ OBO
parser among other things. The WebProtégé user interface and
client/ server communication is implemented using the Google
Web Toolkit (https://developers.google.com/web-toolkit/) and
JavaScript.

5 FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

WebProtégé is currently under heavy development. Some of the
features that are relevant for the biomedical ontology community
that we plan to add are as follows: support for exporting and
publishing projects as OBO ontologies (Via integrations with the
OBO-Ontology Release Tool); tighter integration with third-
party issue trackers that are typically used by biomedical ontol-
ogy projects (such as GoogleCode or GitHub Issues); online rea-
soning and query support (along the lines of the functionality
provided by Protégé 4); mixed subclass and non-subclass (e.g.
partOf) hierarchy Views; better support for Visualization and sup-
port for subset Views (slims).

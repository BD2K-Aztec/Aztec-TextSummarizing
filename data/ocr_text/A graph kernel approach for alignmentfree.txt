ABSTRACT

Motivation: State-of—the-art experimental data for determining binding
specificities of peptide recognition modules (PRMs) is obtained by
high-throughput approaches like peptide arrays. Most prediction
tools applicable to this kind of data are based on an initial multiple
alignment of the peptide ligands. Building an initial alignment can be
error-prone, especially in the case of the proline-rich peptides bound
by the SH3 domains.

Results: Here, we present a machine-learning approach based on an
efficient graph-kernel technique to predict the specificity of a large set
of 70 human SH3 domains, which are an important class of PRMs. The
graph-kernel strategy allows us to (i) integrate several types of phy-
sico-chemical information for each amino acid, (ii) consider high-order
correlations between these features and (iii) eliminate the need for an
initial peptide alignment. We build specialized models for each human
SH3 domain and achieve competitive predictive performance of 0.73
area under precision-recall curve, compared with 0.27 area under pre-
cision-recall curve for state-of-the-art methods based on position
weight matrices.

We show that better models can be obtained when we use information
on the noninteracting peptides (negative examples), which is currently
not used by the state-of-the art approaches based on position weight
matrices. To this end, we analyze two strategies to identify subsets of
high confidence negative data.

The techniques introduced here are more general and hence can also
be used for any other protein domains, which interact with short pep-
tides (i.e. other PRMs).

1 INTRODUCTION

SH3 domains are an important class of peptide recognition
module and probably the most widespread protein domain
found in protein databases (Cesareni et al., 2002). Thus, SH3

domains are involved in many cellular processes such as signal-
ing, cell-communication, growth and differentiation.
Furthermore, the SH3 complexity corresponds with the complex-
ity of the genome (Carducci et al., 2012). These domains specif-
ically recognize short linear proline-rich peptide sequences (Lim
et al., 1994; Mayer, 2001; Musacchio et al., 1992). SH3 domains
have a conserved ,B-barrel fold, which is formed by five or six ,8
strands arranged in two anti-parallel ,8 sheets. SH3 domains are
~60 amino acids in length and mainly found in intra-cellular
proteins.

Approximately 300 SH3 domains are known in the human
proteome (Karkkainen et al., 2006). As 25% of human proteins
contain proline-rich regions (Li, 2005), and SH3 domains recog-
nize proline-rich peptides, it is an open challenge to understand
how the hundreds of SH3 domains achieve a high specificity in
selecting their physiological partners to regulate speciﬁc biolo-
gical functions.

The canonical proline-rich peptide motifs recognized by most
of the human SH3 domains have a PxxP core and are classiﬁed
in two major groups: class I and class II. The consensus se-
quences for these two groups are denoted as —i—x<I>Px<I>P
(class I) and <1>Px<I>Px+ (class II), where x represents any natur-
ally occurring amino acid, CD represents a hydrophobic amino
acid and + represents as a positively charged amino acid (nor-
mally arginine and lysine). Structural studies of the SH3—peptide
complexes with class I and class II motif suggest that these two
types of peptide ligands bind to an SH3 domains in opposite
orientations (Lim et al., 1994; Yu et al., 1994). Previous studies
reveled that the positively charged residues in the peptide se-
quence, such as arginine and lysine, play an important role in
the binding with the respective SH3 domain (Feng et al., 1994,
1995). Based on the characteristics of the binding site, the SH3
domains prefer either one or the other pepitde motif. Peptide
motifs can be further classiﬁed into subgroups depending on
the tolerance for the substitution of the lysine residue with the
arginine residue (Carducci et al., 2012).

Although most human SH3 domains bind with class 1 and/or
class II motifs, a subset of SH3 domains have the ability to rec-
ognize noncanonical or atypical peptide motifs. For example,
NCKl SH3 domains and the SH3 domains from EPS8 family
are able to bind with a PxxDY motif (Kesti et al., 2007;
Mongiovi et al., 1999). EPS8 and its SH3 domain have an im-
portant role in mitogenetic signaling. Overexpression of EPS8
increased epidermal growth factor-dependent transformation
and mitogenic responsiveness to epidermal growth factor

(Fazioli et al., 1993; Matoskova et al., 1995). The RxxK motif
was also found to interact with SH3 domains of the STAM2
(Kato et al., 2000), SLP-76, GRAP2—C proteins (Liu et al.,
2003). Peptides that are sufﬁciently similar to class I or class II
motifs are also recognized by several SH3 domains. For instance,
the motif RxxPxxxP (similar to class I) and the motif PxxxPR
(similar to class II) bind with the SH3 domain in CTTN (Tian
et al., 2006) and CIN85/SH3KBP1 proteins (Moncalian et al.,
2006), respectively.

Enormous amount of data are generated by various high-
throughput experiments designed to address the binding speciﬁ-
city of SH3 domains, such as phage display (Tonikian et al.,
2007), SPOT synthesis (Landgraf et al., 2004) or peptide array
screening (\Nu et al., 2007). Current associated computational
methods, however, are usually based on the popular position
weight matrices (PWMs) (Brannetti et al., 2000; Kim et al.,
2011). There are two major drawbacks of PWMs. First, they
are essentially linear models and thus ignore the correlation be-
tween the various positions in the peptide ligand (Liu et al.,
2010). This also implies that they cannot differentiate between
peptide classes. For that reason, few approaches are proposed
recently, which use multi-PWM models for addressing the prob-
lem of multiple peptide classes (Gfeller et al., 2011; Kim et al.,
2011). Second, they are based on a multiple alignment of the
peptide ligands, which is a hard task for proline-rich SH3-
bound peptides. Even minor alignment errors typically introduce
signiﬁcant noise in PWMs estimate. Other tools rely on resolved
3D domain—peptide structures, which are, however, known only
for a few cases. Thus, they typically cannot directly make use of
the available high-throughput data. These include the structure-
based energy model by Hou et al. (2006) and the neural network
model by Ferraro et al. (2006).

Here, we present a machine-learning approach to overcome
the aforementioned drawbacks. Our method is based on a graph-
kernel technique that, differently from the PWMs, does not
require an initial peptide multiple alignment. Furthermore by
virtue of its nonlinearity assumptions, it can adequately capture
all types of peptide classes. We build specialized models for each
of 70 human SH3 domains achieving competitive predictive per-
formance compared with the state-of—the-art method (Kim et al.,
2011). Furthermore, we show how we can leverage the informa-
tion contained in related domains by building a single compre-
hensive model for a set of six SH3 domains further improving the
predictive performance. Although high throughput datasets are
available to train statistical-based learning approaches, we note
that the presence of spurious interactions in the experimental
data (either false negative or false positive) can severely affect
the quality of the induced model. To tackle this problem, we use
several approaches to identify a subset of high conﬁdence nega-
tive interaction data. These instances are then used to train a
model in a setting with reduced noise-to-signal ratio.

2 METHODS

We present an effective machine-learning method for the prediction of
protein domain-peptide interactions. The method is based on a graph-
kernel approach, which, in contrast to the majority of other approaches,
does not require the peptide sequences to be aligned and can, at the same
time, exploit high-order correlations between amino acid residues.

Finally, we show how to build a model that takes in input both the
peptide information and the (aligned) domain amino acid sequence. By
doing so, we can exploit information from related SH3 domains and
enhance the overall prediction performance.

2.1 Dataset

In our study, we use the large-scale human SH3—peptide interaction data
from the high density peptide array experiment (Carducci et al., 2012). A
total of 9192 peptides of length 15 were used in the CHIP experiment.
The SH3—peptide interactions that gave a positive signal in peptide CHIP
experiment have been stored in the newly developed interaction database
PepspotDB. From PepspotDB, we have retrieved 16032 nonredundant
interactions for 70 human SH3 domains and 2802 peptides. Among them,
a total of 478 interactions were also supported by the literature as re-
ported by the MINT database (Licata et al., 2012) (see Table 1 for
details).

2.2 Feature encoding

2.2.] Single domain modeling For some protein domains, it is pos-
sible to identify a key amino acid necessary for a successful binding of a
peptide (e.g. the phospho-tyrosine for the SH2 domain). This pivotal
amino acid can then be used to identify an absolute reference system
that allows to represent the peptide as a ﬁxed size vector, i.e. each
amino acid is identiﬁed as having position+i or—i starting from the
pivotal amino acid. For SH3 domains, the situation is, however, more
complex, as the key amino acid (proline) is abundant throughout the
peptide sequence. A unique reference system based on proline cannot
therefore be easily identiﬁed. Commonly, an initial alignment of the pep-
tide sequences is performed in a preprocessing step. Errors in this phase
can lead to a bad estimate of the model’s parameters and ultimately to
bad predictive performances.

Here, we propose a kernel approach deﬁned independently of an ab-
solute reference for amino acid positions. In this way, we can move from
a ﬁxed-size vector type of encoding to a variable length sequence type
encoding while still preserving a high discriminative power. The shift
from a vector-based to a sequence-based approach can be extended fur-
ther: if we move from sequences to graphs, we can then encode any other
ancillary information on speciﬁc amino acids. To do so, we have to move
from string kernel to efﬁcient graph kernels. To ensure low run-times, we
resort to the recently introduced (Costa and Grave, 2010) Neighborhood
Subgraph Pairwise Distance Kernel (NSPDK) (see Supplementary
Information for more details).

In more detail, to encode the peptide information, we proceed as fol-
lows. Given the experimental CHIP design constraints in peptide array
library, we can only use peptide sequences of exactly 15 residues in length.
We enrich the information available on each amino acid with their aver-
age physico-chemical properties, i.e. charge and hydrophobicity. As the
graph-kernel approach can deal only with discrete labels, we discretize all
properties. More speciﬁcally, as for charge, we have divided all common
20 amino acids into three groups as basic (R, K, H), acidic (D, E) and

neutral (the remaining amino acids); as for hydrophobicity, we have
identiﬁed four groups (very low, low, high and very high) based on
their hydrophobicity scales following Kyte and Doolittle (1982), obtain-
ing I, L, V as very high hydrophobic residues; A, M, C, F as high hydro-
phobic residues; G, T, S, W, Y, P as low hydrophobic residues; and rest
of the amino acids (i.e. R, K, H, D, E, Q, N) are considered as very low
hydrophobic residues.

The peptide is then modeled as a chain of unlabeled vertices: one per
amino acid. Each vertex is then connected with a side-chain graph that
encodes the ancillary properties, namely, of proximity: the charge, the
hydrophobicity and the amino acid code (see Fig. 1, left). To generate
features that are discriminative of the sequence direction, we model the
peptide as a directed graph.

2.2.2 Multiple domains modeling When developing models for
single domains, the input encodes only the information for the peptide
sequence. However, when we want to induce a general model for a subset
of related domains, the input should include also information on how a
speciﬁc domain relates to the other ones so that useful knowledge can be
transferred from interactions on similar domains. To do so, we model the
domain amino acid sequence information in a similar fashion to the
peptide encoding, with one important difference: as the position of spe-
ciﬁc amino acids is relevant to determine the speciﬁcity of the domain—
peptide interaction, we additionally encode the information of an abso-
lute positional reference. To do so, we align the related domains with the
MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004) alignment software. In contrast to the peptide
alignment, the SH3 domain alignment is highly reliable, mainly the align-
ment of n-SRC-loop and RT—loop in SH3 domains. Each domain-speciﬁc
sequence is then projected onto the alignment, and the necessary gaps are
ﬁnally introduced (see Fig. 1, right). The input for the multi-domain
model therefore comprises two disconnected components, one for the
peptide and one for the domain. To eliminate ambiguity issues, we dis-
tinguish the label alphabet for the peptide sequence from that of the
domain sequence by means of appropriate preﬁxes.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Modeling with graph kernel features

Our approach is based on a graph encoding that allows to model
relations between speciﬁc amino acids as well as different amino
acid abstractions. This graph is then processed by a fast graph-
kernel technique called NSPDK, recently introduced by Costa
and Grave (2010), which extracts as explicit features, the occur-
rence counts of all the possible pairs of near small neighborhood
subgraphs. The subgraph pairs are characterized by a radius and
by a topological distance parameter (for details, see in
Supplementary Information). The ﬁnal classiﬁcation task is
then performed by a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based on
the NSPDK graph kernel. By using an explicit vector encoding,
we gain efﬁciency, as we avoid computing and storing the pair-
wise similarity matrix.

3.1.] Single domain modeling When developing models for each
speciﬁc domain, we need only encode information on the candi-
date peptide sequence as described in Section 2.2. Different
values for the radius parameter give rise to the parts illustrated
in Figure 2.

Given the directed nature of the encoding graph, each neigh-
borhood sub graph includes only amino acids that are downstream
with respect to the current root node. With radius 1 and distance
0, each labeled vertex is considered independently: the corres-
ponding feature representation encodes the frequency of each
physico-chemical property (either the charge, the hydrophobicity
or the amino acid type) in the single peptide; radius 2 allows
properties of adjacent residues (e. g. hydrophobicity and adjacent
charge information) to be modeled; radius 3 allows all properties
for a single residue to be taken into account jointly. Even larger
radius values can capture the joint information for adjacent pairs,
triplets, etc., of residues. When pairs of neighborhood subgraphs
at different distances are used, the composition of the subsequence
between the two root vertices is ignored allowing a don ’t care or
soft type of feature matching. The order in which the properties
are encoded is chosen to avoid generating features that subsume
each other (i.e. given a neutrally charged amino acid, one can have
multiple values for the hydrophobicity, but not the other way
around). The ﬁnal descriptors for each peptide contain all features
with radii ranging from 0 up to Rmax and distances in [0, Dmax].
The optimal ranges are determined experimentally via cross-val-
idation techniques. Finally, the training phase allows the deter-
mination of the weight distribution on all feature types (general
and speciﬁc) to obtain optimal predictive performance

peptides. SH3 domains for FYN, BTK, HCK, FGR, SRC and
LYN proteins are among them. The intuition underlying the
multiple domains approach is that, if we are able to exploit the
similarities across these domains, we can then increase the pre-
dictive performances for each speciﬁc domain. In practice, we
would be performing a form of transfer-learning (Caruana, 1997)
from one protein domain to another so that the examples used to
induce a model on one domain would also contribute to form the
bias of related models, increasing the effective number of avail-
able training instances.

To do so, we proceed by coupling the peptide information
with the encoding for the domain in a joint feature space;
more speciﬁcally, we encode the domain amino acid sequence
information via its projection with respect to the domain con-
sensus alignment. Here, the backbone vertex labels encode the
speciﬁc position of the amino acid within the reference align-
ment. By introducing these absolute reference ids, all features
(those describing physico-chemical properties and those describ-
ing the amino acid composition) become position speciﬁc. This
absolute reference creates a joint feature space that ultimately
allows information about interactions with different domains
to be shared.

We are not trying to model the exact pairs of interacting
amino acid residues (one in the peptide and one in the
domain), as done in Ferraro et al. (2006). To do so would
imply resorting to resolved protein complexes information,
which is not available in large-scale. Rather, we represent the
candidate interacting peptide and domain as a pair of discon-
nected graphs. The NSPDK procedure alone does not instantiate
features that can directly express the relationship between parts
of the peptide and of the domain sequences. However, we can
take full advantage of the kernel trick and use nonlinear (i.e.
polynomial or Gaussian) kernels. By doing so, the peptide-
domain complex is implicitly represented by features that express
combinations of the original features. We then rely on the stat-
istical analysis of high-throughput experiments to infer the im-
portance of each position speciﬁc features in the domain
combined with nonposition speciﬁc features of the peptide
sequence.

3.2 Dealing with false negatives

Traditional methods for peptide characterization rely on genera-
tive approaches where the probability of the model (often repre-
sented as a motif) is estimated from positive data alone. A typical
approach is represented by PWMs (Kim et al., 2011) where the
multinomial probability distribution for each position in the se-
quence is estimated independently via frequency counts. In the
Machine Learning community, it is known that discriminative
models have an advantage over generative ones, as they can rely
on both positive and negative data; this allows them to better
identify the decision boundary for the relevant region of the data
space. Although generative methods often require less training
examples, they do not achieve the same performance (Ng and
Jordan, 2001). However, when negative data are assumed to be
severely affected by noise, or even when the negative data is
overly represented, one-class models can exhibit an advantage
over discriminative ones. A typical scenario is when dealing
with high-throughput experimental results such as phage display

(Tonikian et al., 2007), SPOT synthesis (Landgraf et al., 2004) or
peptide array screening (Wu et al., 2007). Here, to increase the
conﬁdence on the measurements, the experimental protocol
makes use of stringent thresholds (e.g. requiring the agreement
on several replicated experiments). In these cases, a large part of
what would be labeled as lack of interaction (negative example)
is just a weaker true interaction (positive example). To deal with
these cases, we developed two approaches. The ﬁrst one is a
generative approach that makes use of multiple PWMs to
model each peptide class. We then select a subset of instances
that are not recognized by any specialized PWMs and use those
are reliable negative instances to train a binary classiﬁer. The
second approach is based on a combination of a one-class and
a semi-supervised method.

3.2.] False negatives reﬁnement The key idea here is to use a
generative approach to model each peptide class and select a
subset of instances that are not recognized by any specialized
model. We take an approach similar to Hui and Bader (2010)
and select conﬁdent negative interactions using proﬁle-based
models (i.e. PWMs). To better represent the binding speciﬁcity
of each domain, instead of using a single model, we resort to
multiple PWMs, namely, one for each motif class for each SH3
domain.

In more detail, we ﬁrst used the fuzzpro pattern search pro-
gram from the EMBOSS package (Rice et al., 2000) to cluster the
peptides into eight groups, one for each known motif class. We
found that the majority of the peptides belong to the canonical
motifs of class I and/or class II, whereas the rest belong to atyp-
ical motifs, mainly PxRP, PxxxPR, PxxDY and RxxKP motifs
(see Supplementary Table S1).

Afterward, we used the popular EM-based MEME (Bailey
and Elkan, 1995) algorithm to generate a PWM for each group.

Finally, we used MAST (Bailey and Gribskov, 1998), a se-
quence homology search algorithm, to identify the peptides
matching the various PWMs. MAST ranks the input sequences
according to an E—value type of score. We consider the peptides
with high E—value (i.e. those that are not recognized with conﬁ-
dence by the model) as negatives. The cutoff score was set to the
maximum E—value calculated for the known positive instances.
Finally, for each domain, we select those peptides that are not
recognized by any of the class speciﬁc PWMs. By doing so, we
identify a total of ~200 K (262 883) negative interactions for the
whole set of 70 human SH3 domains (see Table l). Peptides
considered as negative but that are close to the cutoff score are
structurally similar to positive peptides.

Training and testing a model using only high conﬁdence nega-
tive interactions can in principle induce a bias. To rule out such a
case, we perform an additional experiment (see Section 3.4 later
in the text) where we do not ﬁlter in any way the negative data.

3.2.2 One class semi-supervised model The key idea here is to
use the SVM one-class approach, pioneered by Scholkopf et al.,
2001, to warm-start the self-training method for semi-supervised
learning (Culp and Michailidis, 2007), restricting the prediction
to negative instances only. In Scholkopf et al., 2001, it is shown
how, to identify a region that contains with high probability
most of the positive data, one can formulate the classic SVM
optimization problem for binary classiﬁcation using the origin of

the feature space as the only negative instance. In case of normal-
ized kernels, this boils down to using negative instances that are
just the symmetric counterparts of the available positive in-
stances. Here, we follow this latter way, given that we can pro-
duce the explicit sparse encoding and can therefore efﬁciently
invert each instance.

The self-training approach to semi-supervised learning (Culp
and Michailidis, 2007) is a wrapper method that iteratively uses
the class predictions over the unlabeled data as true labels for a
successive training phase until convergence to a stable state is
reached. Here, we use the one-class model to initially induce the
class information on the unsupervised instances, but, rather than
using both positive and negative predictions, we accept only
negative predictions. We select those instances that are predicted
with the highest conﬁdence (i.e. that are further away from the
class boundary hyperplane) and use them to iteratively train the
SVM model. For simplicity, we ﬁx the fraction of the accepted
negatives to 50% of the total number of unsupervised instances.

3.3 Performance of single domain model with filtered
negatives

As detailed in Section 3.2.1, we induced PWMs to model several
known classes of binding peptides for each SH3 domain. We
used these models to select and ﬁlter away all peptides that
were experimentally identiﬁed as noninteracting but that are
recognized by the PWMs as belonging to one of the known
classes of binding peptides. In this way, we obtain a total of
262883 conﬁdent negative interactions for all 70 SH3 domains
(the full list of positive and negative interaction data along with
the class balance is given in Supplementary Table S2). We encode
the peptide sequences as described in Section 2.2 and induce an
SVM model for each SH3 domain based on the graph kernel.
Even if here we use a linear SVM, we are inducing a nonlinear
model with respect to the sequence of amino acid residues, i.e.
the linear model is aware of higher order features that capture
the correlation between pairs, triplets, etc., of amino acids.

We used a lO-fold stratiﬁed cross-validation to evaluate the
predictive performance of each model. The hyper-parameters of
the method were optimized in each fold by using a 5-fold cross-
validation over the training set. Speciﬁcally, we optimized the
radius parameter R e {1, ...,8} and the distance parameter
D e {1, ...,8} for the graph kernel. The linear SVM model is
induced using the Stochastic Gradient Descent approach cham-
pioned by Bottou and Bousquet, 2008. The optimal values are
achieved at R = 6 and D = 8 for most of the domains.

In Supplementary Table S3, we report the following quanti-
ties: Sensitivity/ Recall = ﬁv, Speciﬁcity = TNT—3,1,, Precision
= %, the area under the precision-recall curve (AUC PR)
and the Area Under the Curve for the Receiver Operating
Characteristic (AUC ROC). On average, we obtain a remarkable
0.73 AUC PR and 0.94 AUC ROC.

As for run times, as the NSPDK has essentially a linear com-
plexity when dealing with bounded degree graphs, we report
the estimated average time per instance: 0.07 s/instance on an
ordinary 2.33 GHz Intel Core2 Duo CPU. This time includes
the ﬁle upload in main memory, the graph feature generation
and the parameters ﬁtting of the model via the Stochastic
Gradient Descent. In practice, this means that we can generate

a model, given 1 K peptides in l min, or equivalently, a model for
a proteome-scale 100K peptides dataset in <2h on a desktop
machine.

We note that at times, we suffer from the high imbalance
problem. For certain domains (e.g. CSK, DLGl, FISH,
GRAP2-1, RUSCl, STAM2, etc.), the ratio between the avail-
able information for positive interactions and negative inter-
actions is above l—100. It is known in the Machine Learning
literature that severely imbalanced class distribution negatively
affects the performance of adaptive predictors (He and Garcia,
2009), as the tuning algorithms are generally biased toward the
majority class. In our case, the majority class is the negative class,
which implies a low sensitivity (true positive rate).

3.3.] Comparison with state-of—the—art PWM approach We have
compared our results with a recently developed tool (Kim et al.,
2011) based on PWMs called Multiple Speciﬁcity Identiﬁer
(MUSI). Even if the tool tries to increase the modeling complex-
ity by replacing a single PWM with multiple PWMs, it remains in
essence a linear model and therefore still suffers from the issues
detailed in the Section 1, namely, the inability to model features
correlation and the fact that it requires an initial error-prone
peptide alignment phase. We have used exactly the same
experimental setup as in our approach. In Figure 3, we report
the comparative results with respect to AUC PR and AUC ROC
performance measures for all 70 human SH3 domains. On aver-
age MUSI achieves a noncompetitive 0.27 AUC PR and 0.69
AUC ROC.

We were curious to see how our method performs on the same
experimental dataset as done in Kim et al., 2011. To do so, we
collected the interaction data used in the article by Kim et al.,
2011. A total number of 2457 unique positive interactions were
available for the SH3 domain from SRC protein. As the inter-
action peptides were identiﬁed by the phage display experiment,
we could only get the positive interaction data. For preparing the
negative interaction data, we took three different strategies. First,
we consider the ﬁltered negative data used in our study. Second,
we prepare random negatives automatically generated by rand()
function in Perl and third, we prepare the random negatives
generated by the same strategy as described earlier in the text
with PxxP core. Finally, we have performed stratiﬁed lO-fold
cross-validation, using same parameter ranges for optimization
and report AUC PR and AUC ROC performance measures for
all these three datasets. Our approach shows much higher per-
formance than MUSI tool. This would add another layer of
conﬁdence to the performance of our models. We also compare
the performances of our graph-kernel approach and MUSI on
our original dataset with these three datasets (see details in
Supplementary Fig. S4).

The problem of generating the initial alignment was also
tackled in a recent publication by (Andreatta et al., 2013).
They identify multiple speciﬁcities in peptide data by performing
two essential tasks simultaneously, alignment and clustering, and
therefore ﬁnd biologically relevant binding motifs that cannot be
described well with a single PWM. Our approach sidesteps these
issues altogether, as we just make a model based on all available
peptide features (achieving at the same time a speed up of several
orders of magnitude in run times).

3.4 Performance of single domain model with unfiltered
negatives

Training and testing systems using only high conﬁdence negative
interactions can in principle induce a bias that alters the com-
parison between methods. To rule out such a case, we perform
an additional experiment where we do not ﬁlter in any way the
negative data. We use the same setup as in previous experiments
(i.e. stratiﬁed lO-fold cross-validation), using the same param-
eters ranges for optimization. In Figure 3, we report the com-
parative results with respect to AUC PR and AUC ROC
performance measures for all 70 human SH3 domains. The
graph-kernel approach achieves an average AUC PR 0.35 and
0.90 AUC ROC. In the same conditions, MUSI achieves a
noncompetitive AUC PR 0.04 and AUC ROC 0.58. This result
conﬁrm the advantages of the proposed discriminative graph-
based method. The large difference in the performance with
respect to the ﬁltered case is due to (i) the imbalanced class dis-
tribution (up to 1:100) and (ii) the presence of a possibly large
portion of false negatives.

3.5 Test on single domain model with one-class and semi-
supervised ﬁltered negatives

To test how important the precise information on true negatives
(i.e. peptides that do not interact with the domain) is, we used the
one-class and semi-supervised technique described in Section
3.2.2. The key idea here is to make use of information based
primarily on the positive interactions to characterize the binding
peptides; instances that are not well recognized by the model are
then assumed to be negative. Once again, we operate in the same
setup as for the unﬁltered negatives experiment. In Figure 3, we

report the comparative results with respect to AUC PR and
AUC ROC performance measures for all 70 human SH3 do-
mains. The one—class approach achieves an average AUC PR
0.063 and 0.61 AUC ROC. Although this result is statistically
signiﬁcant (according to a Wilcoxon Matched-Pairs Signed-
Ranks Test, with P200003), the magnitude of the result let
us conclude that using a generative approach to model pro-
tein—peptide interactions is noncompetitive with respect to dis-
criminative approaches.

3.6 Multi-domain model

We aligned six domains (SH3 domains for FYN, BTK, HCK,
FGR, SRC and LYN proteins) with the MUSCLE tool (Edgar,
2004). We used the SVM ligh’ (J oachims, 1999) software to train a
Gaussian SVM over the explicit sparse feature encoding of pep-
tide and domain sequence pairs. We evaluated the predictive
performance using a lO-fold cross-validation over the six
domain set using the ﬁltered negatives as speciﬁed in Section
3.2.1. The value for the Gaussian width was optimized on an
internal 20% validation set over the range y e {.001, .01, .1, 1}
and the trade-off parameter C e {1, 10, 100}, whereas the values
of R and D for the graph kernel were ﬁxed at the optimal value
obtained in the previous experiments of R = 6 and D = 8. As a
baseline, we trained (and evaluated in an analogous setting) the
six models independently on each domain, both using a linear
kernel and a Gaussian compounded kernel. In Figure 4, we
report the AUC PR and the AUC ROC for each SH3 domain
and MUSI performance. In Supplementary Fig. S5, we report
the sensitivity and the speciﬁcity, respectively. The experimental
result conﬁrms our intuitions: sharing information across related

domains increases the predictive performance, mainly owing to an
increase in sensitivity. We also note that the difference between
models trained over single domains when using the linear kernel or
the Gaussian one is nonstatistically signiﬁcant. This result is also
in line with our expectations, as the correlation between features is
fully captured by the pairwise neighborhood subgraphs features,
leaving no margin of improvement to the nonlinearity imple-
mented by the kernel trick. With radius R = 6 and distance
D = 8, the kernel generates features spanning the whole sequence.
Finally, we report the performance of the joint model when
trained over the six domains, but tested over a novel albeit related
LCK dataset. In this experiment, we are asking to predict the
speciﬁcity for a novel domain, given only the information about
the alignment of this domain to the overall consensus alignment.
The model achieves an average AUC PR 0.85 and AUC ROC
0.96, with a high sensitivity 0.91 and speciﬁcity 0.96. The interest-
ing ﬁnding is that the results are better than those obtained by
training a model on the LCK protein alone; in this case, we obtain
an average AUC PR 0.86 and AUC ROC 0.94, with a low sensi-
tivity 0.55 and a high speciﬁcity 0.99. To understand the result, in
the case of the LCK domain, we have experimental evidence only
for 150 positive interactions, whereas the dataset for the six do-
mains has a total of 910 nonredundant peptides involved in posi-
tive interactions. The experimental results support therefore the
hypothesis that, at least in the LCK case, the domain alignment is
sufﬁcient to characterize the peptides binding model and to
achieve therefore a higher overall sensitivity.

3.7 Genome-wide analysis

We have performed a genome-wide analysis of SH3 domain-
mediated interactions. Our aim was to identify the novel inter-
actions that have important biological roles. We used
UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database (Magrane and UniProt
Consortium, 2011), which is a manually curated and reviewed
database. We retrieved 20 225 human proteins from UniProtKB/
Swiss-Prot database, release 2012—06. For retrieving the peptide
sequences, we scan all the available proteins with a window size
of 15 and step size of 5. In this way, we have extracted a total
number of ~2M (2 209 474) peptide sequences.

In this analysis, we implemented co-cellular localization ﬁlter
to avoid unlikely interactions, considering the term relative to the
subcellular localization hierarchy in the controlled vocabulary of

the Gene Ontology database (Ashburner et al., 2000). More
clearly, the mature protein that contains the peptide and the
protein that expresses the domains should share the same subcel-
lular localization. In case of multiple cellular localization (e.g.
GRB2 protein can be found in nucleus, cytoplasm, endosome
and golgi apparatus), we consider a peptide eligible for binding
only if it shares at least one of the localization term with the
domain-containing proteins.

After ﬁltering the eligible peptides, we scored them by the
trained models and ranked according to the SVM scores.
Finally, we report the top 50 predictions by each SH3 domain
(see Supplementary File Sl). Among the predictions, we observed
a peptide (CKKLSPPPLPPRASI, position 151—165) from
Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 3-kinase C2 domain-containing
subunit beta (Uniprot-id: 000750) was targeted by many SH3
domains (21 domains) that also share the same cellular compart-
ment as annotated in Gene Ontology term database. There are
also two evidence of interactions between PIK3C2B with GBR2
and PLCy—l reported in STRING database (Franceschini et al.,
2013). In addition, we took 478 real interactions reported in the
MINT database (Licata et al., 2012), discarded them from our
training set and could recover 397 (i.e. a recall 0.83).

In addition, we performed an analysis on these top 50 predic-
tions for each SH3 domain to uncover the novel interaction
functionalities using DAVID tool (Huang et al., 2009). The
tool allows the possibility to perform a term-centric enrichment
analysis on >40 different annotation categories. DAVID func-
tional annotation chart, which identify enriched annotation terms
associated with predicted proteins are reported. The smaller
P—values indicate higher enrichment (see Supplementary File S2).

Applying the term-centric analysis, we have observed some
biological meaningful interactions. For example, (i) SH3 do-
mains from human P85-a binds with a potential group of pro-
teins (Uniprot—id: P21854, Q08209, Q07890, 000459, Q6ZUJ8)
that play important role in B cell receptor signaling pathway. (ii)
Among the top prediction by the SH3 domain from Human
BTK protein, >50% proteins take a vital role in alternative
splicing.

4 DISCUSSION

SH3 domain is probably the most widespread class of protein
recognition modules. The interactions mediated by SH3 domains

constitute an important class of protein interactions, involved in
many cellular process. We presented a computational approach
to predict domain—peptide interactions, using available high-
throughput data. The method is an alignment-free approach
based on an efﬁcient graph kernel. Although, here, we present
an application to SH3 domains, the method is general and can
thus be trained to predict any protein—peptide interaction for
which high-throughput data exists.

Current methods for protein—peptide interaction require often
an initial multiple alignment of the bound peptides. As this is an
error-prone process (especially in the case of SH3-domains,
where peptides are proline-rich), one risks to introduce a signiﬁ-
cant amount of noise and obtain under performing models. In
addition, current methods are often linear models (e.g. PWMs)
and are therefore not able to represent high-order correlations
between amino acid residues. Nonlinear method exist but have to
deal with the high model complexity resulting from exponential
number of high-order correlations achievable even for relatively
short peptide sequences. If one uses the full alphabet of 20 amino
acids, it becomes hard to gain sufﬁcient data for a correct esti-
mation of these complex models. One common solution is to use
a reduced alphabet where each letter represents an entire amino
acid class. This strategy, however, leads to inferior performance,
especially when speciﬁc amino acids are preferred at speciﬁc pos-
itions. An alternative approach is to determine important inter-
action ﬁrst by using resolved 3D domain—peptide structures. The
major obstacle for the widespread application of this approach,
however, is the limited availability of such structural data.

In this article, we use a different approach. We consider an
alignment-free approach based on a graph representation of the
peptide sequence where different abstraction levels are available
in a uniﬁed way. By applying an efﬁcient graph-kernel method,
we were able to model high-order correlations that span different
abstraction levels (e. g. a feature could represent a speciﬁc residue
that has to be three positions to the right of a hydrophobic resi-
due). The regularization provided by the SVM optimization
scheme ﬁnally ensures that the model complexity is appropriately
controlled and that only the features relevant for the task at hand
are selected. Discarding the abstraction information (experi-
ments not shown), i.e. using only the amino acid code informa-
tion, leads to statistically signiﬁcantly lower sensitivity. This
conﬁrms the intuition that using physico-chemical properties in
the feature deﬁnition can adequately model cases that would
otherwise be poorly covered by a sufﬁcient number of sequences.
It was also important to optimize the encoding order; therefore,
we performed an experiment with different encoding order and
proposed the best order to represent our graph (see
Supplementary Fig. S6). Interestingly, the experimentally cross-
validated optimal parameters value (R = 6, D = 8) suggests that
high-order amino acid correlations are required to obtain the
best predictive performance, and that therefore linear models
are inadequate.

Although we have previously used the NSPDK graph-kernel
approach for clustering RNA structures (Heyne et al., 2012),
here, differently from the RNA or molecular case, we do not
have an obvious and natural way to encode information as a
graph. The guiding principle, behind the choice of the proposed
feature encoding, is to add ‘abstract information’ (like charge or
hydrophobicity) in a somewhat ‘soft’ and incremental way.

Rather than using an extended alphabet and maintaining a se-
quence encoding, the proposed graph encoding allows us to
obtain features that are increasingly specialized. We have experi-
mental evidence (see Supplementary Fig. S6) that a different
choice in the ordering of the abstract information would yield
suboptimal results, which become evident in the presence of
imbalanced data. Additionally, we have investigated the per-
formance of a string kernel (the k-mer kernel) along with other
types of kernels, applied to the pure amino-acid sequences (i.e.
without any additional information). Also, in this case, there is
an evident drop in performance (see Section ‘Comparison with
other predictive methods’ and Supplementary Fig. S7 in the
Supplementary Information).

This conﬁrms the intuition that using physico-chemical prop-
erties in the feature deﬁnition can adequately model cases that
would otherwise be poorly covered by a sufﬁcient number of
sequences. Interestingly, we experimentally observed that high-
order amino acid correlations are required to obtain the best
predictive performance, suggesting that linear models are inad-
equate for this application.

Another common practice is to use generative models, i.e.
models that try to capture the density distribution of the inter-
acting peptides only. We showed that using one-class approaches
is sub-optimal, even when considering models more expressive
than the commonly used linear PWMs. The average predictive
performance of a graph-kernel-based domain-speciﬁc model that
is trained in a discriminative fashion is 0.35 AUC PR compared
with 0.06 AUC PR when trained in a one-class way.

We tried to address the problem of selecting high-quality nega-
tive data. The issue is known in literature (see Ben-Hur and
Noble, 2006 and Lo et al., 2005). In the application domain of
protein—peptide interaction, it has been shown (Lo et al., 2005)
that the common practice of generating negative instances by
randomly shufﬂing peptide sequences simply leads to decreased
predicted performance, as these instances do not resemble real
biological sequences and are not therefore useful to determine
useful class boundaries. We note, however, decreasing perform-
ance proportional to the level of class imbalance. When the ratio
of negative instances versus positive ones is within lO-fold, we
maintain an AUC PR 0.8, but for ratios greater than 100, per-
formance drops to AUC PR 0.4 and lower (see Supplementary
Figs S8 and S9).

We showed how the flexible graph-kernel approach allows the
induction of multi-domain models. These models can leverage
experimentally veriﬁed binding interactions on related domains
and achieve high predictive performance even on domains for
which no training material was available.

Finally, we performed a genome-wide prediction of human
SH3—peptide interactions. All the learned models as well as all
the genome-wide prediction interactions are available in http://
www.bioinf.uni-freiburg.de//Software/SH3PepInt.

Our approach is general enough and can easily be applicable
to other similar domains like SH2, PDZ and so forth. As for
future work, given the computational efﬁciency of these models
(a single-domain model can be trained on 100K sequences in
<2 h), we plan to provide a comprehensive set of predictors for
all protein domains for which high-throughput data are
available.

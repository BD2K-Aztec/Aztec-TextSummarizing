ABSTRACT

Summary: Mutually exclusive splicing is a strictly regulated pattern of
alternative splicing. A speciﬁc group of mutually exclusive splicing
events has been shown to be regulated by the formation of specific
RNA secondary structures. This type of regulation has been shown to
exist only in arthropods. The present study involved a detailed
sequence analysis of human gene structures that undergo mutually
exclusive splicing, which showed that this type of regulation may also
occur in dynamin 1 in mammals. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that
the dynamin 1 orthologs in invertebrates did not share the same
sequence features, which suggests that the regulatory mechanism
has independently evolved in the mammalian lineage. Therefore, the
emergence of this elaborate mechanism for mutually exclusive splicing
may be attributable to mechanistic convergence.

1 INTRODUCTION

The alternative splicing of pre-mRNA is regulated in a
spatiotemporal manner and is essential for generating proteornic
diversity. Mutually exclusive splicing is an alternative splicing
pattern where only a single exon is precisely selected from a
cluster of candidate exons. Several different mechanisms have
been proposed for mutually exclusive splicing (Smith, 2005).
For example, an elegant model that involves speciﬁc RNA
secondary structures in introns was ﬁrst proposed for the exon
6 cluster of Dscam in Drosophila species (Anastassiou et al., 2006;
Graveley, 2005). In this model, the formation of RNA secondary
structures between a docking site and selector sequences in pre-
mRNA allows a single exon to be selected, although other cases
that can be explained using this model were not observed for
several years.

A recent study by Yang et al. (2011) expanded the applicability
of this model to other genes in insects, such as 14-3-35 and
myosin heavy chain. In Dscam, it appeared that clusters of mu-
tually exclusive exons other than exon 6 could also be explained
using the docking site-selector sequence interaction model. They
not only predicted the intronic elements responsible for mutually
exclusive splicing but also experimentally demonstrated that the
elements were directly involved with the precise selection of the
exon Wang et al., 2011). At present, this mechanism is only
known to exist in arthropods (Brites et al., 2008), and it is
uncertain whether it applies to genes in other clades, including
mammals.

In this report, a genome-wide analysis of cases of mutually
exclusive splicing was performed by scanning the structures of
human transcripts to gain mechanistic insights into the regula-
tion of mutually exclusive splicing. The RNA base-pairing
potential for pre-mRNA sequences that underwent mutually
exclusive splicing was calculated, and a characteristic sequence
pattern that ﬁtted well with the docking site-selector sequence
pairing model was observed in the sequence of dynamin I (dnmI).
The applicability of this model was supported by evidence, such
as the conservation of sequence patterns in other mammalian
species. The discovery that the pre-mRNA sequence of dnm]
in humans has sequence features similar to that of the alternative
splicing patterns observed in insects greatly expands the applic-
ability of the docking site-selector sequence pairing model to
bilaterian animals.

2 METHODS

2.1 Gene and genome sequences

The genomic sequences and mammalian genome alignments were down-
loaded from the UCSC genome browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu)
(Dreszer et al., 2012). The mammalian genome sequences used in the
analysis were as follows (the release date and assembly identiﬁers are
indicated in parentheses): human (March 2006, hg18), orangutan (July
2007, ponAbe2), marmoset (June 2007, calJacl), mouse lemur (June 2003,
micMurl), rat (November 2004, m4), kangaroo rat (July 2008, dipOrdl),
cow (October 2007, bosTau4), horse (September 2007, eunab2), dog
(May 2005, canFam2), megabat (July 2008, pteVaml), rock hyrax (July
2008, proCapl), tenrec (July 2005, echTell), armadillo (July 2008,
dasNov2), and opossum (January 2006, monDom4). The conservation
scores for the mammalian genome alignments were calculated using the
phastCons program (Siepel et al., 2005) and also downloaded from the
UCSC genome browser (Dreszer et al., 2012).

The genomic coordinates of human transcripts were downloaded from
the UCSC genome browser (Dreszer et al., 2012). There were 66 803
transcripts (‘knownGene’ in UCSC genome browser), which corres-
ponded to 26 570 distinct genes.

2.2 RNA secondary structure analysis

The base-pairings between the surrounding introns of mutually exclusive
exons in pre-mRNA sequences were calculated using the RNAduplex
program in the viennaRNA package (Hofacker et al., 1994) (see
Supplementary Materials for detailed procedure). The signiﬁcance
levels of the base-pairing energy values were evaluated by comparing
them with the background energy distribution, which was obtained by
applying the same program to randomly shufﬂed versions of the original
sequences. This procedure was used to exclude base-pairing with low
energy values because of biased nucleotide compositions

2.3 Molecular phylogeny

The amino acid sequences of dynamins were downloaded from National
Center for Biotechnology Information (Sayers et al., 2012) and aligned
using the MAFFT program (Katoh et al., 2005) with the default param-
eters. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining
method (Saitou and Nei, 1987) with the HT model (Jones et al., 1992)
for amino acid substitutions. Bootstrap values were calculated on the
basis of 100 resamplings of the original alignment data.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 Identiﬁcation of mutually exclusive splicing in the
human transcriptome

For each gene, the structures of the transcripts were compared
with each other to identify mutually exclusive splicing. The de-
tailed procedures were as follows: (i) F or a pair of transcripts
that belong to the same gene, candidate mutually exclusive exons
were observed by comparing the coordinates of the exons. If the
upstream and downstream constitutive exons had the exact same
coordinates and the coordinates of the alternatively spliced exon
located between the constitutive exons were different in each
transcript, these exons were marked as candidate mutually ex-
clusive exons. (ii) After ﬁnding the candidate mutually exclusive
exons, the structures of all the remaining transcripts belonging to
the gene were analyzed, and candidates were rejected if a tran-
script skipped or included both candidate mutually exclusive
exons. If the candidate exons were not rejected during compari-
sons with all the remaining transcripts, i.e. all the transcripts in a
locus have either one of the candidate mutually exclusive exons,
these exons were stored in the ﬁnal list of mutually exclusive

exons. (iii) This procedure was repeated for all possible combin-
ations of transcripts to exhaustively search for examples of mu-
tually exclusive splicing.

This procedure was applied to 66 803 transcripts correspond-
ing to 26 570 genes, and 118 examples of mutually exclusive
splicing were identiﬁed (Supplementary Table S1). These
examples were visually conﬁrmed using the UCSC genome
browser (Dreszer et al., 2012), and a clear pattern of mutually
exclusive splicing was observed, which was retained after com-
paring the EST sequences mapped on these loci. The total
number of the identiﬁed examples is probably a lower limit be-
cause rather stringent criteria were adopted for further analyses
of the regulatory mechanisms.

3.2 The docking site-selector sequence interaction model
can be applied to dnm]

To identify examples that may be explained by the docking site-
selector sequence pairing model, the 118 examples of mutually
exclusive splicing were investigated in detail by measuring their
potential to form base-pairings with the surrounding introns in
the mutually exclusive exons. A striking example was observed in
dnm] where a pair of complementary elements existed in two
intronic regions, i.e. a potential selector sequence in the down-
stream region of exon 10a and a potential docking site in the
proximal upstream region of exon 11 (Fig. 1A). The positions of
these elements relative to the mutually exclusive exons and neigh-
boring constitutive exons exactly matched those observed in the
14-3-35 gene in insects (see Fig. 1 in Yang et al., 2011). These two
elements were located in highly conserved regions (Fig. 1A
and B), suggesting that selection pressures were acting on these

sites. Moreover, both elements can form signiﬁcantly stable base-
pairing (AG 2 —30.8 kcal/mol; z score = —3.34, calculated from
the background energy distribution) (Fig. 1C). Some sites that
were not strictly conserved were not complementary with each
other when the elements formed a speciﬁc RNA secondary struc-
ture, which also supports the functional importance of these
elements during base-pairing. Overall, these features strongly
suggest that RNA pairing between the two conserved elements
observed in dnm1 in mammals directs the choice of the mutually
exclusive exons. This is the ﬁrst clear evidence of the existence of
this mechanism in mammals, which suggests that this is a widely
used mechanism for mutually exclusive splicing in bilaterian
animals.

3.3 Proposed model for the regulation of mutually
exclusive splicing in dnm1

Based on the sequence features of dnm1, a model is proposed for
the regulation of mutually exclusive splicing, which is analogous
to that observed in mutually exclusive splicing events in insects
(Anastassiou et al., 2006; Graveley, 2005; Yang et al., 2011)
(Fig. 2). According to this model, mutually exclusive splicing is
accomplished by competition between the formation of a speciﬁc
RNA secondary structure via the complementary sequence elem-
ents and binding of a repressor protein (Fig. 2). However, what is
the identity of the trans-factor that acts as a repressor during the
regulation of mutually exclusive splicing? In case of the Dscam
exon 6 cluster in Drosophila, Hrp36 is the factor that ensures
ﬁdelity of the mutually exclusive choice of exon 6 (Olson et al.,
2007). Thus, the corresponding human homolog, hnRNP Al
(Zu et al., 1998), which is known to repress splicing by binding
to pre-mRNAs (Smith and Valcarcel, 2000), may be the trans-
factor involved with regulation of mutually exclusive splicing in
dnm1. Another possible factor may be the F ox-l /F ox-2 splicing
regulator, which is known to act as an activator and repressor
during exon skipping (Zhang et al., 2008). The 5’-residues of the
selector sequence (AGCAUG) were highly similar to the Fox
protein recognition sequence (UGCAUG) (Underwood et al.,
2005), and binding to the site may directly prevent the pre-
mRNA from forming speciﬁc base-pairing, thereby inactivating

exon 10a inclusion. This is also supported by the fact that dnm1
and fox-I/fox—2 are both highly expressed in the nervous system
(Powell and Robinson, 1995; Underwood et al., 2005).

The involvement of Fox proteins in mutually exclusive exon
selection in dnm1 was analyzed further using the CLIP-seq data
obtained for F ox—2 Weo et al., 2009). CLIP-seq is used to iden-
tify transcriptome—wide interactions among RNA-binding
proteins and targets RNAs using cross-linking immunoprecipita—
tion coupled with massively parallel sequencing Weo et al.,
2009). The F ox—2 CLIP-seq data were downloaded from the
UCSC genome browser (the ‘F OX2 CLIP-seq’ track)
(Dreszer et al., 2012) and analyzed by counting the sequence
reads mapped on each gene locus. Among the total of
4418213 CLIP-seq reads, 825 reads mapped on the dnm1
locus, and dnm1 was ranked among the top 3% of the total
genes (729th of 26 570 genes; P<0.0001, Poisson distribution)
(Supplementary Fig. S1). This also supported the involvement
of Fox proteins in the mutually exclusive selection of the exons in
dnm1, and it also reinforced the proposed model, which is ex-
plained by the competition between the formation of speciﬁc
base-pairing and binding of a splicing regulator.

3.4 Molecular phylogenetic analysis indicates that the
regulatory elements are speciﬁc invention in
mammalian lineage

To obtain insights into the molecular evolutionary process
underlying the emergence of this elaborate mechanism for mu-
tually exclusive splicing, a phylogenetic analysis was performed
using homologous sequences from several species. Each mamma-
lian species had three closely related dynamins (dnm1, dnm2 and
dnm3), whereas Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila each
appeared to have only one dynamin (van der Bliek, 1999). The
phylogenetic relationships among the dynamins indicated that
the expansion of dynamin paralogs occurred in the common an-
cestor of mammals (Fig. 3). Pairs of mutually exclusive exons
were observed only in mammalian dnm1 and dnm2, and were
absent from all other dynamins (Boumil et al., 2010).
According to the phylogenetic tree, dnm2 and dnm3 were closer
to each other than to dnm1. This suggests that exon duplication
occurred in the common ancestor of mammals, and then dnm3

lost one of the duplicated exons; otherwise, multiple independent
duplication would be required to explain the observed presence/
absence pattern in the mutually exclusive exons. The complemen-
tary sequence elements were observed only in dnm1 in mammals.
This can be explained by the loss of sequence elements in dnm2 or
by the emergence in dnm1. Both possibilities suggest that these
sequence elements independently evolved in the mammalian lin-
eage and not in the bilaterian ancestor.

4 CONCLUSIONS

Recently, it has been reported that long-range RNA structures
are important for the regulation of splicing in mammals and that
a mechanism based on docking site-selector sequence pairing
may be present in mammalian genes (Pervouchine et al., 2012).
To the best of my knowledge, this is the ﬁrst example of a pos-
sible regulatory mechanism facilitated by docking site-selector
sequence pairing during the precise selection of mutually exclu-
sive exons in a mammalian lineage. A direct experimental proof
is still required, but the lines of evidence presented in this study
suggest that the regulatory mechanism responsible for mutually
exclusive splicing is also present in dnm1 in mammals. This mech-
anism was ﬁrst proposed in the exon 6 cluster of Dscam in insects
(Anastassiou et al., 2006; Graveley, 2005). A molecular evolu-
tionary study of Dscam homologs revealed that the regulatory
mechanism exists only in arthropods, and that this was not be-
cause of its loss in other bilaterian species but because it had
independently evolved in arthropods (Brites et al., 2008), which
is the phylogenetic pattern opposite to that proposed for the
dynamins presented in this study. Thus, although mutually ex-
clusive splicing is regulated the same way in dnm1 in mammals
and Dscam in arthropods, neither gene had a common ancestral
gene with the same regulatory mechanism, which suggests that
this type of regulation may be a result of mechanistic conversion.
Convergent evolution of gene structures has often been observed
in mutually exclusive exons (Copley, 2004). The example pre-
sented here indicates that convergence also occurs at the mech-
anistic level of mutually exclusive splicing where distinct genes in
different clades have independently evolved the same mechanism
of regulation to achieve the precise selection of mutually exclu-
sive exons.

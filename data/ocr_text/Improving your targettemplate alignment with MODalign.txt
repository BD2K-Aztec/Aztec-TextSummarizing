ABSTRACT

Summary: MODalign is an interactive web-based tool aimed at
helping protein structure modelers to inspect and manually modify
the alignment between the sequences of a target protein and
of its template(s). It interactively computes, displays and, upon
modification of the target-template alignment, updates the multiple
sequence alignments of the two protein families, their conservation
score, secondary structure and solvent accessibility values, and local
quality scores of the implied three-dimensional model(s). Although it
has been designed to simplify the target-template alignment step
in modeling, it is suitable for all cases where a sequence alignment
needs to be inspected in the context of other biological information.
Availability and implementation: Freely available on the web at
http://modorama.biocomputing.it/modalign. Website implemented in
HTML and JavaScript with all major browsers supported.

1 INTRODUCTION

Protein sequence alignment is a key step in most, if not
all, applications of protein bioinformatics. Evolutionary analysis,
functional assignment and comparative modeling projects all heavily
rely on an accurate sequence alignment. The alignment plays a
particularly pivotal role in comparative modeling: if the target—
template alignment contains errors, it is extremely difﬁcult to correct
them in either the model building or the reﬁnement stage.

In the case of difﬁcult comparative modeling tasks, there can
be several regions that have structurally diverged between the
target and the template(s). To optimize the alignment in such
regions, expert modelers take into account as much information as
possible. This includes sequence conservation patterns in multiple
sequence alignments of the target and template evolutionary
families, secondary structure states, and often their expert biological
knowledge. Moreover, to ﬁnd potential errors in the alignment,
several models based on different alignment versions are usually
built and analyzed in terms of parameters such as unfavorable
burial of charged residues. Combining all this information during
alignment optimization is often difﬁcult and time—consuming
and without thorough inspection of the sequence and structural
parameters can lead to unspotted errors and inaccurate models.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Here we describe an interactive web—based alignment editor that
makes alignment optimization simpler. It works as a dashboard for
computing, displaying, inspecting and updating alignment related
information in real time. The tool also automatically builds models
according to the alignment that is being inspected (without modeling
insertions) and allows the quantitative assessment of their global and
local quality.

Finally, the edited alignment can be directly used for building
a full length three—dimensional model using Modeller (Sali and
Blundell, 1993).

2 TOOL DESCRIPTION

Given a target and template alignment (multiple templates can be
used), the system performs several operations:

- Builds a multiple sequence alignment of representative
sequences for both the target and the template families. For
the target, this step is performed using two iterations of
hhblits (Remmert et al., 2012) with default parameters on the
UniProt20 database. For templates, the alignments are derived
from the HHSearch (deing, 2005) alignment database. The
output alignments are subsequently ﬁltered using the hhﬁlter
program from the HHSearch package;

- Aligns the input template sequence(s) with the sequences
derived from the SEQRES and ATOM ﬁelds of the
corresponding PDB entry(ies);

Displays the sequence alignment of target, template(s) and
their families in the interactive editor interface;

Highlights residues with no coordinates in the template
structure (by showing the residues in lower case);

Graphically depicts sequence conservation for each column
of the alignment as background shading;

0 Displays secondary structure and solvent accessibility values.
Values for the target are predicted using PSI—PRED (Jones,
1999) and ACCpro (Cheng et al., 2005), respectively. The
values for the templates are calculated using DSSP (Kabsch
and Sander, 1983) and POPS (Fraternali and Cavallo, 2002);

0 Upon request, highlights potential errors in the alignment,
such as: (i) insertions or deletions within secondary structure
elements; (ii) cases where, a hydrophobic or charged residue

in the target is aligned to an exposed or buried residue in the
template, respectively;

0 Upon request, computes and displays the QMEAN (Benkert
et al, 2011) global and local scores of the model implied by
the current alignment (without modeling insertions);

0 Performs all the above computations (including QMEAN)
also for representative target homologs, giving an estimate
of how the whole target family ‘ﬁts’ to the selected template;

- Allows for editing operations such as residue shifts and
insertions in either the target or the template. Importantly, the
system automatically introduces the changes in all members of
the family of the protein and recomputes all the data described
above;

0 Submits the alignment to Modeller for model building;
0 Allows export of the alignment in FASTA or PIR format;

0 Provides visualization of templates and model structures
in Jmol (http://www.jmol.org/) also mapping the positions
of insertions and deletions in the current target—template
alignment on the template structures.

The editor interface is composed of several sections showing the

above information and users can choose which sections to display.

Options for saving and modifying the appearance of the results,

including using different amino acid color schemes, are provided.
A snapshot of the tool is shown in Figure 1.

Fig. 1. The MODaIign result page. The alignment can be edited in the target—
template alignment section. When the alignment is modiﬁed, the output, such
as coloring by sequence conservation or highlighting of potential errors, is
modiﬁed in real time, while QMEAN can be recalculated on request.

3 IMPLEMENTATION

The server is built in Python (using Dj ango web framework), HTML
and JavaScript (using ExtJ S library), and utilizes PyCogent (Knight
et al, 2007).

4 CONCLUSIONS

While many useful automatic servers to build comparative models
of proteins exist, it is still the case that a careful inspection
of the sequence alignment makes a difference in the ﬁnal
model quality. Very often, papers reporting the results of a non—
trivial comparative modeling experiment mention that a manual
modiﬁcation of the alignment was required before performing the
model—building step.

In this article, we describe a tool that we believe will be of great
help in these cases for both expert and novice users.

We also believe that the usability of its interface will make
MODalign a useful tool for the inspection of an alignment also
by scientists who do not want to exploit its editing capabilities. For
example, it may be useful for inspecting their proteins of interest in
the context of the alignment of their evolutionary families, secondary
structure, solvent accessibility states and the likelihood of implied
residue—residue interactions (as computed by QMEAN).

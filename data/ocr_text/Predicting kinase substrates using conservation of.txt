ABSTRACT

Motivation: Protein kinases represent critical links in cell signaling. A
central problem in computational biology is to systematically identify
their substrates.

Results: This study introduces a new method to predict kinase
substrates by extracting evolutionary information from multiple
sequence alignments in a manner that is tolerant to degenerate
motif positioning. Given a known consensus, the new method
(ConDens) compares the observed density of matches to a null
model of evolution and does not require labeled training data.
We confirmed that ConDens has improved performance compared
with several existing methods in the field. Further, we show that it
is generalizable and can predict interesting substrates for several
important eukaryotic kinases where training data is not available.

1 INTRODUCTION

Protein phosphorylation is a well studied class of post—translational
modiﬁcation that has powerful inﬂuence over the dynamics of
biological systems. It is characterized by the addition of a phosphate
group (P04) to an amino acid residue by a kinase enzyme (Berg,
2007). Proteins that are subjected to these events often undergo a
biochemical change that can, in turn, affect biological pathways
associated with them (Cohen, 1982).

Kinases often choose phosphorylation targets selectively and
different kinases may favor residues with different local
arrangements of amino acids (which are referred to as ‘consensus
sequences’ or ‘motifs’) (Collins et al., 2007). However, consensus
sequences alone are often insufﬁcient for kinase substrate prediction
because they tend to be short and degenerate and matches are
expected to occur frequently by chance in random sequences.

Computational kinase substrate predictors take advantage of
a myriad of local biological information in generating their
predictions. This includes amino acid arrangement (Blom et al.,
1999; Lam et al., 2010; Obenauer et al., 2003; Xue et al., 2008, 2011;
Zhou et al., 2004), biochemical/structural property (Blom et al.,
1999; Iakoucheva et al., 2004; Lam et al., 2010) and quantity/density

of consensus matches (Chang et al., 2007; Gnad et al., 2011; Lam
et al., 2010; Moses et al., 2007). There are also some that incorporate
interactome information to further enhance their predictions (Li
et al., 2010; Linding et al., 2008).

The focus of our work is to develop a kinase substrate prediction
method based on motif conservation over evolution. This idea is
based on the work in a previous study (Budovskaya et al., 2005)
which illustrated that consensus sites for protein kinase A (or PKA)
are more likely to be phosphorylated if preserved over longer
evolutionary distances.

A challenge in using this approach is that patterns of molecular
evolution in protein sequences are highly heterogeneous. In many
cases, a match to a consensus sequence (which we will also refer to
as ‘match’, ‘motif match’ or ‘consensus match’) can be considered
as functionally conserved if it is well aligned in a multiple sequence
alignment (or MSA) (Fig. 1A). However, in situations where the
entire local sequence neighborhood is also conserved, it will be
difﬁcult to tell whether the matches are ‘speciﬁcally’ conserved
due to a kinase substrate interaction or ‘non—speciﬁcally’ conserved
as part of a larger domain with a different function (Fig. 1C)
(Budovskaya et al., 2005).

At the same time, functional phosphorylation motif matches do
not necessarily align in a MSA. Previous studies have shown that
phosphorylation sites are often not positionally conserved despite
being located in the same local region in orthologous proteins (Ba
and Moses, 2010; Chang et al., 2007; Holt et al., 2009; Moses
et al., 2007). For such examples (Fig. 1B), one can observe that
the quantity of matches in the local sequence neighborhood is
consistent among orthologous sequences (Ba and Moses, 2010; Holt
et al., 2009; Moses et al., 2007). Nevertheless, all of these cases
contrast with the patterns observed for randomly occurring matches
to the consensus site (Fig. 1D) that typically show no consistent
conservation patterns and disappear quickly.

Current conservation—based prediction methodologies are largely
focused on the residue conservation of motif matches (Budovskaya
et al., 2005; Gnad et al., 2011; Lam et al., 2010). Since these
strategies are dependent on the positional conservation of the
matches of interest, they may be insensitive towards situations where
matches are not positionally conserved (Fig. 1B). Furthermore,
the lack of consideration for the local region’s conservation can
lead to false detection of matches located in highly conserved
neighborhoods (Fig. 1C).

To address these issues, we designed a new kinase substrate
prediction method (ConDens) that (i) considers the conservation
of the number of motif matches in a local region of the protein,
rather than the alignment of individual phosphorylation sites and
(ii) uses an evolutionary model to account for the local sequence

Predicting kinase substrates using ConDens

 

divergence to avoid detection of spurious matches in conserved
domains.

Since the method uses a null model of evolution, it does
not require a labeled set of bona ﬁde phosphorylation sites and
negative motif matches. Although it does require an input consensus
sequence, we consider it to be unsupervised relative to other
methods (Lam et al., 2010; Xue et al., 2006, 2011) that train their
classiﬁcation models based on the datasets of previously known
phosphorylation sites.

We compared ConDens’ ability to predict Cdc28 phosphorylation
substrates against that of several methodologically different
phospho—predictors in the ﬁeld and showed it had an improved
classiﬁcation performance compared with these other methods.
Finally, we used ConDens to scan the Saccharomyces cerevisiae
genome for potential phosphorylation substrates of Mecl/Tell, Prk1,
Ipll, PKA, CKII and Ime2 kinases. In all but one case, our results
indicated a statistically signiﬁcant enrichment of known kinase
substrates among our predictions.

2 METHODS
2.1 ConDens, a new kinase—substrate prediction
method

2.1.1 Overview ConDens is designed to assess the conservation of the
number of matches in local regions of a protein of interest (Z), given the local
sequence divergence and without relying on alignment of matches between
orthologous sequences. ConDens ﬁrst deﬁnes a reference local region around
each motif match m and counts the number of motif matches located in
corresponding regions within Z’s orthologs. Then for each orthologous
region, a ‘pair—wise’ P—value is computed to test the null hypothesis of
observing the number of matches in Z’s orthologs in the absence of speciﬁc
selection to retain the motif matches (see Section 2.1.2). The score for a
match is then derived by combining these pair—wise P—values using Fisher’s
method. Finally, ConDens assigns protein Z the most signiﬁcant score of the
matches in its primary sequence.

2.1.2 The ConDens model In principle, a motif match can be conserved
‘speciﬁcally’ (due to the unique properties of the motif) or ‘non—speciﬁcally’
(due to being part of a conserved domain). In the absence of purifying
selection speciﬁc for a kinase—substrate interaction, the number of associated
phosphorylation motif matches in the sequence is expected to approach an
equilibrium level over evolution as dictated by random mutation events and
the local evolutionary rate. On the other hand, where there is purifying
selection for a kinase—substrate interaction, the matches are likely to be
conserved in quantity over evolution (Moses et al., 2007) and thus deviate
from an equilibrium level or approach this level more slowly.

We formulated a statistical model to detect selection on the number of
matches to a consensus sequence, C, by rejecting the null hypothesis of
evolution according to a local evolutionary model with no speciﬁc constraint
to retain motif matches. For our purpose, we deﬁned a consensus sequence
C of width w as an array of character sets C1,. ..,CW, where Cj represents the
set of allowable amino acid residues in the j—th position in the consensus.
As an example, the S/T—P consensus would be represented as [(S,T),(P)] and
have w = 2. Given peptide sequences S and S’, we estimate the evolutionary
distance, t, between S and S’ and compute the distribution of matches in
S/ conditioned on S, an amino acid substitution model (SM) and t. This
evolutionary distance t is estimated based on the model chosen. For instance,
t would be the J ukes—Cantor distance if SM is the J ukes—Cantor substitution
model.

To compute the distribution of the number of matches to C under the null
hypothesis (or the ‘null distribution’), we ﬁrst determine the probability p,-
that a match to C begins at the ith position in S after t evolutionary distance,

assuming evolution of amino acids occurs as dictated by SM.

p,- =Pr(match to C at position i|S,-, ...S,-+w_1,SM,t)

2H ZPr(A|Si+j_1,SM,t) (1)

j=1A€Cj

In this equation, SC is the xth residue in sequence S, and A are the allowed
amino acid residues at the jth position of consensus C.

At any time in evolution, each position can either match C or not.
Therefore, Equation ( 1) can be used to approximate the null distribution
of match counts in sequence S/ as a sum of N =|S| —w+1 independent
Bernoulli random variables with success probabilities p1,..., N. Since
these Bernoulli random variables can have different parameters, we used a
generalized form of the binomial distribution known as the ‘Poisson binomial
distribution’ (Wang, 1993) to approximate the probability of observing n
matches to the consensus sequence C after evolutionary distance t:

Pr(# matches in S/IS, SM, t)%PBN(n|p1, ...pN) (2)
N

PBN(nlp1,...,pN): Z  
XIZijZI/l i=1

Where PBN(n|p1,...,pN) is the Poisson binomial probability density
function (Wang, 1993), X,- e{0, 1} is an indicator variable that equals 1 if
the ith position matches the motif and 0 otherwise, and the sum is over
all possible X =[X1,...,XN] with exactly n matches. We used dynamic
programming to compute Equation (3) in 0(N2) time. Details can be found
in the Supplementary Material.

2.1.3 The ConDens algorithm We are given a protein of interest Z, a
consensus C, a substitution model SM, a multiple sequence alignment of
Z and orthologs, and a search radius parameter d e N. We compute a score
for each consensus match m in Z, as follows (see Supplementary Fig. 1 for
illustration):

Step 1: Find S, a region in Z that encompasses :l:d positions around m’s
ﬁrst position.

Step 2: Find the columns L in the multiple sequence alignment that
corresponds to S.

Step 3: For each ortholog R in the multiple sequence alignment:

(i) Compute an evolutionary distance t based on the local sequence
divergence between proteins Z and R at columns L

(ii) Find the position in R that aligns to the location of m in Z and then
count the number of motif matches, n, within :l:d residues around that
position. If this position is a gap, choose the immediately preceding
non—gapped position in R’s primary sequence.

(iii) Compute the pair—wise P—value, Pr(#matches Z nlS, SM, t), by directly
summing terms computed using Equation (3)

Step 4: Compute a score for match m by combining the pair—wise P—values
acquired in Step 3 by using Fisher’s method.

Once the scores for all m in the protein Z are calculated, the lowest of them
is transformed to —loge space and output as Z ’s score. Higher scores indicate
a greater conﬁdence that there is a match in the protein that is speciﬁcally
conserved.

2.1.4 ConDens parameter and species choice In this study, the ConDens
algorithm was applied to the S. cerevisiae proteome. The window radius d
was chosen to be 20 because that would provide tolerance to the positional
degeneracy of phosphorylated sites. Protein disordered region predictors
(Linding et al., 2003) use windows of this size, suggesting a length scale for
the rapidly evolving regions that contain phosphorylation sites. The amino
acid substitution model SM chosen for this study was JC69AA, which is a
derivative of the JC69 model (Jukes and Cantor, 1969) adapted to amino
acids instead of nucleotides (i.e. 20 residue types instead of 4).

Fig. 1. Patterns of match conservation. Multiple sequence alignments are shown with S/T—P matches boxed and bona ﬁde phosphorylation sites ( Harvey et al.,
2005; Holt et al., 2009;) labeled with arrows. Each alignment has a match of interest on the S. cerevisiae sequence marked with a circle. The ConDens pair—
wise P—values for these matches of interest are shown on the right of each ortholog [‘—loge (P—value)’] and the overall scores for these matches are shown
as large numbers (‘Score’). (A) Swel and orthologs. Marked match starts at Thr 196 where the local rate of evolution is high but the consensus site itself
is conserved. (B) Tif4632 and orthologs. Marked match starts at Thr 196 where the local quantity of S/T—P matches is conserved but not aligned. (C) Tfpl
and orthologs. Marked match starts at Ser 858 (Ser in ﬁrst motif match) where local rate of evolution is low. Both matches in the S. cerevisiae are perfectly
aligned but are not thought to be phosphorylated by Cdc28. (D) Gdsl and orthologs. Marked match starts at Thr 363 (Thr in ﬁrst match) where local rate of
evolution is high. Both matches in the S. cerevisiae protein are neither conserved nor thought to be phosphorylated by Cdc28.

The protein sequences of the S. cerevisiae proteome were a set of 5885
non—dubious open—reading frames (ORFs) in the Saccharomyces Genome
Database (or ‘SGD’) (Cherry et al., 1998) on September 2010. Multiple
sequence alignments were computed using MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004) and
based on protein orthologs of S. cerevisiae in Saccharomyces bayanus,
Candida glabrata, Saccharomyces castellii, Kluyveromyces polysporus,
Zygosaccharomyces rouxii, Kluyveromyces lactis, Ashbya gossypii,
Kluyveromyces waltii, Kluyveromyces thermotolerans and Saccharomyces
kluyveri. The phylogenetic relationships between species were acquired from
(Conde e Silva et al., 2009) and the homology relationships between their
proteins were obtained from the Yeast Genome Order Browser (or ‘YGOB’)
(Muffato et al., 2010).

The choice of species can affect the performance of our method. In absence
of substantial sequence divergence, the conservation of motif matches will
almost certainly be expected under the null hypothesis. On the other hand,
motif matches are less likely to be conserved between very distantly—related
species because the kinase substrate interaction may have diverged. Highly
gapped alignments and repetitive sequences can also pose problems in some
cases (Supplementary Fig. 2)

The effects of using different sets of budding yeast species in the multiple
sequence alignments were studied and it was found that the AUC and AUC50
of ConDens reached a plateau when seven or more species were included in
the sequence alignments (Supplementary Table 1). A similar consistency of
AUC and AUC50 was observed when different values for the window radii
parameter (d = 10, 15, 20, 25, 30) were used (Supplementary Table 2).

2.2 Performance evaluation

2.2.1 Cdc28 dataset We assembled a ‘Cdc28 dataset’ consisting of
proteins phosphorylated by the Cdc28 kinase (‘positives’) and proteins not
phosphorylated by the Cdc28 kinase ( ‘negatives’). This data was drawn from
two Cdc28 phosphorylation studies—an in vitro kinase assay by Ubersax
et al. (2003) and an in vivo genome—wide mass spectrometry experiment
by Holt et al. (2009). Proteins with one or more Cdc28 phosphorylation
site in the in vivo study were considered to be positives and proteins
not discovered to be Cdc28 targets in both studies were considered to be
‘negatives’ (Supplementary Fig. 3). We made a special exception to Cln2
despite it being not a hit in both studies, since it was a well known Cdc28
substrate (Deshaies et al., 1995; Lanker et al., 1996) and was the only false
negative prediction discussed by the in vitro study that was not recovered by
the in vivo study.

We explicitly excluded Cdc28 targets found in the in vitro study that were
not conﬁrmed in the in vivo study, since the conditions used in in vitro studies
may not reﬂect the characteristics of in vivo environments.

To deﬁne a subset of the Cdc28 dataset with sparsely distributed S/T—P
matches, we used the SLR algorithm (Moses et al., 2007) to compute a cluster
score that measures the ‘clusteredness’ of S/T—P matches. For our purposes,
we consider proteins that score <3 to have a sparse spatial distribution
of S/T—P matches (or ‘unclustered’). The command line operation we used
was perl compute_SLR.p1 <ORF FILE> ‘ [ST] P ’ , where <ORF
File> is a FASTA ﬁle of all non—dubious S. cerevisiae protein sequences
from SGD. It is important to note that this is different to the SLR score,
which uses the strong Cdc28 consensus (S/T—P—X—R/K) in addition to the
S/T—P consensus.

2.2.2 Phosphorylation consensus sequences In our experiments, we used
an S/T—P consensus to detect the Cdc28 targets. Although the kinase is widely
reported to have a more stringent S/T—P—X—R/K consensus (Friedman et al.,
1996) (which we refer to as a ‘strong’ Cdc28 consensus), we chose not to
use it due to many known target sites not having the R/K at the +3 position
(Holt et al., 2009).

Based on published literature, we also derived consensus sequences
for Mecl/Tell (Schwartz et al., 2002), Prkl (Huang et al., 2003), Ipll
(Cheeseman et al., 2002), Ime2 (Holt et al., 2007), CKII (Meggio and Pinna,
2003; Nieﬁnd et al., 2007) and PKA (Budovskaya et al., 2005; Kemp and
Pearson, 1990; Townsend et al., 1996) (Table 2).

2.2.3 Known targets of other kinases There are generally no large datasets
for other S. cerevisiae kinases on the scale of the Cdc28 dataset. As a result,
we obtained known targets of these kinases from the PhosphoGRID database
(Stark et al., 2010) and Kinase Interaction Database (KID) (Sharifpoor
et al., 2011). Speciﬁcally, we took substrates with two or more references in
PhosphoGRID and substrates that met the high conﬁdence threshold (6.60)
in KID. Information from these databases was retrieved on Dec 2011.

2.2.4 Collection of classiﬁcation data The following are instructions
for obtaining Cdc28 prediction data from various protein phosphorylation
classiﬁers. For methods that were speciﬁc to human kinases, data from Cdc2
(human ortholog of Cdc28) was collected instead.

Motif Analysis Pipeline: Protein sequences from the whole S. cerevisiae
genome were submitted to the Motif analysis pipeline (MOTIPS) web
interface (http://motips.gersteinlab.org/) (Lam et al., 2010). Scores for each
protein were taken directly from the program output. The parameters used
for the program are same as default; we used the Cdc28 dataset as its training
data and provided it with a PWM determined from the Cdc28—phosphorylated
sites denoted in (Holt et al., 2009).

Group—based Prediction System 2.1 (GPS): Protein sequences from the
whole S. cerevisiae genome were submitted to the GPS 2.1 program (Zhou
et al., 2004). The ‘Threshold’ parameter was set to ‘All’. Matches were
assigned scores for the human Cdc2 kinase from program output. Each
protein was then assigned a score equivalent to the highest given to any
of their constituent matches.

Scansite 2.0: Protein sequences from the whole S. cerevisiae genome
were submitted to Scansite web interface (http://scansite.mit.edu/) (Obenauer
et al., 2003) using the low stringency option. Matches were assigned scores
for the human Cdc2 kinase from program output. Each protein was then
assigned a score equivalent to the lowest given to any of their constituent
matches.

SLR: The SLR program was run iteratively on every protein sequence
in the S. cerevisiae genome. As per recommendation by the paper
(Moses et al., 2007), we used both the S/T—P and S/T—P—X—R/K
consensuses for predicting Cdc28 targets. The command line operation we
used was perl compute_SLR.p1 <ORF File> ‘ [ST]P. [RK] ’
‘ [ST] P ’ , where <ORF File> is a FASTA ﬁle of all non—dubious
S. cerevisiae protein sequences from SGD. We then parsed the resulting
score for each individual protein from the output.

2.2.5 Measures of classiﬁcation performance The performance of a
classiﬁer was evaluated using the area under receiver operator characteristic
curve (AUC) (Fawcett, 2004) and AUC50 (Bauer et al., 2011; Gribskov
and Robinson, 1996), which is the AUC measured for the ﬁrst 50 false
positives. In measuring the AUC, proteins for which no prediction was made
were considered ‘missing data’ and were excluded. Data—points with identical
scores were ranked lexically by their ORF identiﬁers. For plotting precision
and recall and the score distribution histogram (shown in Fig. 2) ‘missing
data’ were included in the lowest bin.

2.2.6 Biological analysis using F unSpec FunSpec (Robinson et al., 2002)
was used to analyze the biological functions of individual proteins. The
parameters we used are the same as the default settings with Bonferroni
correction turned on. Emphasis was given to results in ‘MIPS Functional
Classiﬁcation’, ‘GO Biological Process’, and ‘GO Molecular Function’.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1 Predicting targets of Cdc28

In principle, computational predictors can predict phosphorylation
sites, phosphorylated proteins or both. ConDens can serve either
purpose. We decided to focus on substrate prediction at a protein—
level because we have a comprehensive dataset of Cdc28 substrates

ConDens Score

Fig. 2. Classiﬁcation power of the ConDens score. Distribution of ConDens
scores among Cdc28 targets ( ‘positives’, white bars) and non—targets
(‘negatives’, gray bars). The bin size for the histogram was 2, and the

and recall (crosses) of ConDens’ binary classiﬁcation over a range of score

in S. cerevisiae, as well as a conﬁdent set of proteins that are unlikely
to be substrates of this kinase (see Section 2.2). We also studied the
method’s utility in Cdc28 phosphorylation site prediction and results
are illustrated in Supplementary Table 3.

To test ConDens’ classiﬁcation power at a protein—level, we
computed a ConDens score (see Section 2.1) for every protein in the
Cdc28 dataset (see Section 2.2). The known targets (or ‘positives’)
and non—targets (or ‘negatives’) distributed differently over this
score spectrum (Fig. 2), with the positives being noticeably shifted
toward higher scores (due to having lower pair—wise P—values).
Because both the positives and negative proteins contain matches to
the Cdc28 consensus, these results indicate that ConDens scores will
differentiate bona ﬁde kinase targets from other motif—containing
proteins. This Cdc28 dataset was also used to benchmark ConDens
against two other unsupervised kinase substrate predictors: Scansite
(Obenauer et al., 2003) and SLR. (Moses et al., 2007). Scansite is
a method that ﬁnds good matches to a position weight matrix and
SLR is a method that uses the spatial distribution of motif matches
in the primary amino acid sequence.

The performances of these classiﬁers were compared using the
area under ROC curves (AUC). To assess the classiﬁers’ utility in
guiding experimental kinase substrate discovery, we also computed
the AUC50 (Bauer et al., 2011; Gribskov and Robinson, 1996), see
Section 2.2.5.

Overall, ConDens’ AUC (0.790) was substantially higher than
that of SLR (0.555), Scansite (0.648) and the expectation for a
random classiﬁer (0.500) (Table 1). The same could be said about
the AUC50 scores, although the difference between AUC50s of
ConDens (0.039) and SLR (0.021) was not as large.

Since SLR was based on the detection of motif match clusters,
it is intrinsically unsuited to predict kinase substrates that have a
sparse spatial distribution of motif matches. To test whether or not
ConDens suffered from the same shortcoming, we repeated the same
classiﬁcation analysis on proteins in the dataset that do not possess
spatially clustered S/T—P matches (see Section 2.2.1).

Under this circumstance, SLR’s AUC was no better than the
random expectation. On the other hand, ConDens’ AUC only
decreased by 5% (0.753, Table 1), which indicates that spatial
clustering of matches had little effect on ConDens’ classiﬁcation
performance. Taken together, the results indicated ConDens had
a superior predictive performance compared with these other
unsupervised methods, even when spatial distribution of matches
is sparse.

3.2 Comparison with supervised predictors

Although ConDens is an ‘unsupervised’ method insofar as it does not
require a labeled set of positive and negative examples for training of
parameters, we could also compare its performance with supervised
methods. We repeated the experiments in Section 3.1 using GPS 2.1
(Zhou et al., 2004), trained on Cdc2 targets (the human homolog
of Cdc28) and MOTIPS (Lam et al., 2010), which we trained on
our Cdc28 dataset. The AUCs of the supervised methods were
much closer to those achieved by ConDens. Remarkably, ConDens’
AUC50s were notably higher (Table 1), than these supervised
methods.

This is important because ConDens does not require training data,
but can still obtain strong classiﬁcation results. We therefore suggest
that ConDens will be particularly useful to identify substrates for
kinases when training sets of characterized substrates unavailable,
thus retaining the portability of unsupervised methods.

3.3 Substrate prediction for other S. cerevisiae kinases

ConDens’ generalizability was tested on several additional kinases
in S. cerevisiae (Table 2). For validation, experimentally veriﬁed
substrates from PhosphoGRID (Stark et al., 2010) and Kinase
Interaction Database (KID) (Sharifpoor et al., 2011) were selected as
‘known kinase targets’. While these databases may not be exhaustive
sources of information, they presented a quick and tractable means
of keeping track of the ever—expanding phosphoproteome.

We performed a binary classiﬁcation experiment where proteins
with a ConDens score greater than 9 were considered as predicted
kinase substrates or ‘hits’. The threshold was decided based on
classiﬁcation performance with the Cdc28 dataset (Fig. 2). The
enrichment of the known kinase targets among the hits was
assessed.

Encouragingly, we found statistically signiﬁcant (P < 0.05,
Fisher’s Exact Test) enrichment of known targets (or true positives)
among hits (Table 2) for the additional consensus sequences tested.
In all, 323 predictions were made for the 6 kinases with 26
being found in PhosphoGRID and KID as bona ﬁde substrates
and the remaining 297 being ‘novel predictions’. Our hits were,
on average, 10 times more enriched in known targets than what
would be expected from a random sample of consensus—containing
S. cerevisiae proteins and 25 times more enriched in known targets
than what would be expected from a random sample of S. cerevisiae
proteins. The biological functions of each set of predictions were
analyzed using FunSpec (see sections below).

We also performed a similar test on other unsupervised methods
(Scansite and SLR) to compare their relative predictive power
for these kinases with respect to ConDens. Unfortunately, the
differences in classiﬁcation power were not statistically signiﬁcant
(see Supplementary Fig. 5), which we believe to be due to the small
number of known kinase targets.

1191 : Mrcl

Fig. 3. An illustration of the DNA damage signaling pathway in S. cerevisiae (Anderson and Sinclair, 2000; Clarke et al., 2000; D’Amours and Jackson,
2002; Segurado and Tercero, 2009; Zewail et al., 2003). Shaded bubbles indicate proteins predicted by ConDens to be Mecl/Tell targets. Bolded bubbles
indicate proteins that are among our list of known Mecl/Tell targets. Alignments of novel predictions (Lcdl, S gsl and Exol) and top hit (Mrcl) are shown

on the right. Matches to the S/T—Q consensus are surrounded by gray boxes.

3.4 Mecl, Tell, Prkl and CKII

The Mecl/Tell hits were statistically signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05)
enriched in functional categories such as cell—cycle checkpoint, DNA
damage response, DNA repair and chromosome organization. These
functions were all relevant to the roles of the Mecl and Tell kinases
as DNA damage sensors (Anderson and Sinclair, 2000; Clarke et al.,
2000; D’Amours and Jackson, 2002; Segurado and Tercero, 2009;
Zewail et al., 2003).

We further examined the novel predictions by determining
whether or not they were involved in the DNA damage signaling
pathway (Anderson and Sinclair, 2000; Clarke et al., 2000;
D’Amours and Jackson, 2002; Segurado and Tercero, 2009; Zewail
et al., 2003) (Fig. 3). Based on this analysis, we identiﬁed three
predicted substrates (Sgsl, Lcdl and Exol) that function in this
pathway, but were not found in the databases of known substrates. In
particular, S gs1 was found to have a human ortholog phosphorylated
by the human Mecl/Tell (ATM/ATR) (Davies et al., 2007; Friedel
et al., 2009) and therefore we consider it to be a very promising
prediction.

Like the Mecl/Tell hits, the Prkl hits appeared to be functionally
associated with their kinase’s biological role. Prk1 is a kinase known
for regulating actin organization and endocytosis (Zeng and Cai,
1999), and the Prkl hits were statistically signiﬁcantly enriched
(P < 0.05) in proteins related to actin, endocytosis and cell polarity.
Among the four novel predictions, Prkl (the kinase itself) and

YAP1802 belonged in at least two of the aforementioned biological
processes. YAP1802 is a paralog of a known Prk1 target (YAP1801)
and Prkl was previously reported to autophosphorylate (Huang
et al., 2009).

Although CKII is involved in a large number of biological
processes, the CKII hits were remarkably enriched in ribosome—
related functions, especially for rRNA processing and ribosome
biosynthesis (P<10T14). The connection between CKII and the
aforementioned processes were supported by a number of literature
articles. A study on pre—rRNA processing and ribosome synthesis
suggested that CKII was biologically related to the novel predictions
Ifh1 and Fhll with the former also being an in vitro CKII target
(Rudra et al., 2007). Another study (Meier, 1996) also suggested a
role of CKII in ribosome synthesis through Srp40 phosphorylation.
Interestingly, although Srp40 was noted as being involved in ‘pre—
ribosome assembly’ in SGD, it was not actually listed under rRNA
processing or ribosome biosynthesis in the FunSpec results.

3.5 PKA and Ipll

For the remaining kinases (PKA, Ipll and Ime2), we were unable to
ﬁnd any statistically signiﬁcant functional enrichment in their hits.
However, our top two predictions for PKA, Tod6 and Dot6 were both
previously found to be functionally related to PKA in the ribosome
biogenesis pathway. (Deminoff et al., 2006; Lippman and Broach,
2009) (Supplementary Fig. 6). Whereas Dot6 has recently been

A. C.W.Lai et al.

 

conﬁrmed as a direct target of PKA, Tod6 has not. The fact that Tod6
was predicted to be a target of PKA by ConDens strongly suggested
that PKA also inhibits the activity of this repressor by direct
phosphorylation. Another of our interesting predictions for PKA is
Cyrl (previously known as Cdc35), which is an adenylyl cyclase
that regulates PKA (Guarente and Kenyon, 2000) (Supplementary
Fig. 6).

Our top Ipll prediction (Tid3, formerly known as Ndc80) was
previously reported to be an in vitro and in vivo Ipll substrate
(Cheeseman et al., 2002), but this protein has not yet been included
in the databases of known substrates. The remaining predictions
appear to be unrelated to Ipll functions. A closer inspection of these
results suggests some of them may in fact be detected for other
reasons. For example, we found three closely related ﬂippases (an 1,
an2 and an3) among the Ipll predictions. One of these (an 1) was
reported as an in vitro substrate of a ﬂippase kinase known as Fpkl.
Remarkably, the same study (Roelants et al., 2010) also proposed a
consensus for the Fpkl kinase that greatly overlapped with the Ipll
consensus we used. As a result, it is possible that the Ipll predictions
also included substrates of Fpkl or other related kinases.

This result brings up an important aspect of ConDens’ design.
Since the method is motif—based, it has no actual conception of what
is a kinase. As a result, it can experience difﬁculty in differentiating
substrates of kinases that have substantially similar (or identical)
consensus sequences (as we suspected to be the case for the Fpkl
and Ipll kinases). Under these circumstances, other information such
as subcellular localization and physical interactions (Linding et al.,
2008) are required for ambiguity resolution.

3.6 Ime2

The Ime2 hits were different to the hits of the other kinases in
that they were very few (a total of six) and devoid of known Ime2
targets. We examined the cause of this negative result by inspecting
the local alignments of the known Ime2 phosphorylation sites in S.
cerevisiae. Remarkably, none of the known Ime2 targets showed a
strong conservation of R—P—X—S/T motif matches among the fungal
orthologs. The weak conservation patterns observed was also not
clade—speciﬁc and varied from protein to protein.

A likely explanation of this unexpected observation is that the
functional regulation of Ime2 had diverged over evolution. Indeed,
recent comparative studies on S. cerevisiae and other more distant
fungal species (Hutchison and Glass, 2010; Irniger, 2011) suggested
that Ime2 may have functionally diversiﬁed over evolution. If this
phenomenon also held for the more closely—related fungal species
considered here, then it could explain our inability to detect Ime2
targets through conservation analysis.

3.7 Biologically important T-G motifs in Nup?

Since we were unsatisﬁed with the small number of novel predictions
for Prk1, we ran ConDens on the S. cerevisiae proteome again using
a ‘relaxed’ consensus (T—G as opposed to L/I/V/M—X4—T—G) to obtain
a larger and possibly even more interesting set of predictions. In
contrast to what we hoped for, the majority of novel predictions for
this relaxed consensus did not appear to be biologically related to
Prkl. As a result, we suspect they were not actually targets of the
Prk1 kinase.

However, as with our analysis of the Ipll results (where they
contained targets of another kinase), some of these T—G—based

predictions appeared to be biologically important. As an example,
we detected an enrichment of conserved T—G motif matches in
three nuclear pore proteins (Nup57, Nup100 and Nup116). This
enrichment occurs close to the F—G matches that are characteristic
of many nuclear pore proteins (Yang, 2011) (Supplementary Fig. 7).
Although it may seem unlikely for Prkl to be associated with the
Nup proteins due to vast differences in their biological functions,
these T—G’s might be functionally important and associated with the
F—G’s. This observation is also an indication of this method’s general
applicability. Even though this study placed a strong emphasis on
phosphorylation motifs, the ConDens algorithm was based on the
principle that functionally—important motif matches are conserved
over evolution and this should be applicable to any type of short
linear motifs.

4 CONCLUSION

In all, we offer a new method to predict kinase substrates based
on evolutionary conservation of phosphorylation site recognition
motifs. The requirement for accurate phosphorylation site alignment
was circumvented by using the local retention of motif density as
the measure of conservation. Since the new method is based on a
statistical model of molecular evolution, a labeled training set is
not required. Furthermore, we demonstrated the method’s utility in
mining substrates for kinases with some information on substrate
speciﬁcity but few characterized in vivo substrates. ConDens should
be applicable to a wide variety of model organisms due to available
databases such as Ensembl (Flicek et al., 2010) and INPARANOID
(Ostlund et al., 2010) that provide homologous sets of proteins.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Ontologies and taxonomies have proven highly
beneficial for biocuration. The Open Biomedical Ontology (OBO)
Foundry alone lists over 90 ontologies mainly built with OBO-
Edit. Creating and maintaining such ontologies is a labour-intensive,
difficult, manual process. Automating parts of it is of great importance
for the further development of ontologies and for biocuration.
Results: We have developed the Dresden Ontology Generator for
Directed Acyclic Graphs (DOG4DAG), a system which supports the
creation and extension of OBO ontologies by semi-automatically
generating terms, definitions and parent—child relations from text in
PubMed, the web and PDF repositories. DOG4DAG is seamlessly
integrated into OBO-Edit. It generates terms by identifying
statistically significant noun phrases in text. For definitions and
parent—child relations it employs pattern-based web searches.
We systematically evaluate each generation step using manually
validated benchmarks. The term generation leads to high-quality
terms also found in manually created ontologies. Up to 78% of
definitions are valid and up to 54% of child—ancestor relations
can be retrieved. There is no other validated system that achieves
comparable results.

By combining the prediction of high-quality terms, definitions
and parent—child relations with the ontology editor OBO-Edit we
contribute a thoroughly validated tool for all 080 ontology engineers.
Availability: DOG4DAG is available within OBO-Edit 2.1 at

1 INTRODUCTION

The advent of controlled vocabularies used for gene product
annotation has had a deep impact on life science research
(Bodenreider and Stevens, 2006; Howe et al., 2008), since it was
a prerequisite for the analysis of high—throughput screens and the
cross—referencing between databases of different model organisms
and different types of data. Successful vocabularies in the life
sciences range from formal ontologies deﬁned in description logics
such as SNOMED CT via directed acyclic graphs representing is-a
and part-0f relations such as the Gene Ontology (GO) (Ashbumer
et al., 2000) to hierarchical terminologies which deﬁne narrower and
broader terms such as MeSH [www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh]. Over the
past years, numerous ontologies have been created as evidenced by
over 90 ontologies listed by the Open Biomedical Ontology (OBO)
Foundry (Smith et al., 2007).

Creating ontologies is a labour—intensive, difﬁcult, manual
process, which is supported by dedicated ontology editors
such as Protege [protege.stanford.edu] and OBO—Edit

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

(Day—Richter et al., 2007). Recently, there have been efforts
to alleviate these difﬁculties through text—mining, which comprises
a host of techniques from natural language processing to statistics.
One such system is the Protege plug—in TerMine (Frantzi et al.,
2000), which suggests terms by analyzing the frequencies of word
tuples in a text for a given query. Overall, text—mining has to
address three problems to support ontology creation and extension:
(i) generation of relevant ontology terms, (ii) their deﬁnitions and
(iii) relationships between them. Tables 1—3 summarize the current
state—of—the—art for these three problems. Table 1 shows that a
number of systems have integrated linguistic and statistical ﬁltering
with machine learning achieving either high precision or recall.
Table 2 shows the success rates of deﬁnition generation systems.
In particular, the deﬁnitional question answering task (Voorhees,
2003) in the TREC 2003 information retrieval competition serves
as a good evaluation benchmark. Existing systems achieved
success rates of over 25%. The most difﬁcult problem is taxonomy
induction, since it requires the identiﬁcation of entities and their
relations in text. Table 3 shows recent results with success rates
usually <50%. Besides evaluating ontology creation against
benchmarks, one can assess how well semi—automated ontology
creation and extension adheres to design guidelines as put forward
among others by Schober et al. (2009).

This article is organized as follows: ﬁrst, we introduce
DOG4DAG, the ﬁrst tool for ontology generation within OB O—Edit.
Second, we introduce the approach and system and then evaluate the
quality of term, deﬁnition and relationship generation. Finally, we
discuss how the system supports the design guidelines in Schober
et al. (2009) and its limits.

2 THE OBO-EDIT PLUG-IN DOG4DAG

Before we describe the methods and results underlying our text—
mining approach to ontology generation, we give an example
demonstrating the functionality of the implemented system.
DOG4DAG aims to support the work of ontology engineers, who
create ontologies from scratch and extend existing ontologies, as
well as biocurators, who annotate gene products with terms from
the GO and other ontologies.

2.1 Example: ontology creation

Figure 1 shows a screenshot of DOG4DAG with three panels
for term generation (step 1), deﬁnition generation (step 2) and
suggestion of parent terms (step 3). A user wishes to learn about
endocytosis. DOG4DAG offers to either submit the query to PubMed
or the Web or to upload text or PDF documents (Fig. l (1)). While
PubMed is the default source for terminology, the web is often useful
since full—text articles and other online resource such as clinical trials
can be implicitly included in the search. PDFs are useful as a source
if the user has e. g. a repository of full—text PDF articles covering the
domain in question.

The F-measure is usually <50%. In information retrieval, quality is often measured as
F-measure (F), the harmonic mean of precision and recall (see ‘Methods’ section).

Term generation: the user selects terms from the list of generated
terms (Fig. 1 (2)), such as e.g. traﬁicking and endosome. The
selected terms are added to the clipboard (Fig. 1 (3)). If the
generated term exists already in other OBO ontologies then a
corresponding reference is provided. Endocytosis is e.g. deﬁned
in GO and in the ascomycete phenotype ontology APO, whereas
traﬁicking does not exist in any OBO ontology. Such references
to OBO increase the conﬁdence in the quality of the term and
they allow the user to easily re—use terms and synonyms from
other OBO—Ontologies. For each term, there are two icons (Fig. 1

(4)) to show the source of the term and move to the next step
of deﬁnition generation. Searching and ﬁltering terms (Fig. 1
(5)) allows the user to ﬁnd speciﬁc terms. Filtering for example
by ‘some’ to ﬁnd terms similar to endosome brings up very
relevant terms such as early endosome, recycling endosome,
lysosome and liposome. If abbreviations for a term are found
they are displayed (Fig. 1 (7)).

Deﬁnition generation: next, the user can deﬁne terms. Endosome is
e. g. deﬁned as ‘a membrane-bound organelle that sorts molecules
received via endocytosis... ’. The following deﬁnitions are also
suitable and in fact all mention membrane, organelle or
compartment. Clicking plus, the user can add deﬁnitions to a text
ﬁeld (Fig. 1 (6)) and revise them. Clicking the icon behind the
deﬁnition reveals the source URL of the deﬁnition, which is kept
and added as literature reference (dbxref) to the OBO ﬁle.

Taxonomy induction: in step 3, ‘Add to Ontology’, DOG4DAG
predicts relations to ontology terms loaded in OBO—Edit (Fig. 1
(8)). For endosome known parents, cytoplasmic part and
intracellular membrane—bound organelle are suggested
and other parents are predicted from the deﬁnitions above, namely
endocytic vesicle and organelle. Additionally, terms With
strings similar to endosome are offered as parent candidates.

2.2 Example: biocuration

The above example demonstrates how the creation and extension
of ontologies is supported. Additionally, DOG4DAG can be used
directly for biocuration. By searching for a gene product relevant
terms from known ontologies and novel terms are suggested. This
not only helps biocurators directly in the annotation but also
indirectly to identify other relevant ontologies and terms to be
included in the ontology.

Semi-automated ontology generation within OBO-Edit

 

Let us consider the gene product Pax6. Pax6 is a ‘transcription
factor playing a crucial role in the development of the eye’
according to DOG4DAG’s deﬁnition generation. Querying with
‘Pax6’ brings up terms such as eye, development and aniridia.
The ﬁrst generated deﬁnition of the latter states that it is ‘a
disease in which the iris fails to form normally’. The entry for
aniridia also provides references to the disease ontology, GO
biological processes and the human phenotype ontology (Robinson
et al., 2008). With GO loaded in OBO—Edit, all generated terms
similar to GO terms are shown in bold face. For Pax6 they are
developmental process, transcription, neurogenesis or
eye development. They correspond one—to—one to the UniProt
[www.uniprot.org] annotations of human Pax6, which we use for
validation.

3 METHODS

Next, we describe how the generation of terms, deﬁnitions and parent—child
relations is realized.

Term generation: we extract terms from English text, which we
tokenize before POS—tagging, sentence identiﬁcation, noun phrase and local
abbreviation detection. As POS tagger, we use Ling—Pipe—Tagger [alias—
i.com/lingpipe] trained on MEDLINE and the TNT tagger (Brants, 2000)
trained on the Wall Street Journal corpus. We generally regard phrases with
pattern [adjlverb] >l< [ﬁll]{2}[noun]+ as noun phrases, where ﬁll are ﬁll words
like of, the, for, etc. We group noun phrases to candidate concepts and
select a representative label from all associated abbreviations and lexical
variants. Nested terms, i.e. noun phrases within longer noun phrases, are
expanded as separate candidate concepts. We rank candidate concepts, under
consideration of all lexical variants and abbreviations, according to their
relative importance by the term frequency—inverse document frequency (tf-
idf) measure, a weighting method commonly used in information retrieval.
It captures the importance of a term in a set of documents in relation to a
corpus. As corpus we used all scientiﬁc abstracts listed in PubMed.

Deﬁnition generation: the method aims to generate deﬁnitions that will
follow the deﬁnitional pattern ‘A is a B with property C’, meaning that A is
deﬁned through the more general term B and can be distinguished from
other Bs by its unique characteristic C. For example, ‘Endocytosis (A) is the
process (B) by which cells absorb molecules (such as proteins) from outside
the cell by engulﬁng it with their cell membrane (C‘) (from Wikipedia).
The term to be deﬁned, denoted as A, is used to create queries to retrieve
web search results via Yahoo’s BOSS and Microsoft’s Live Search API. We
perform a search forA as well as A combined with hyponym patterns (Hearst,
1992) of high conﬁdence (‘A is a’, ‘A is an’, ‘A are’, ‘As are’), or lower
conﬁdence (‘such as A’, ‘A is’, ‘such A like’, ‘or other A’, ‘and other A’, ‘A
including’ and ‘especially A’). For some queries, we restrict the search to sites
typically containing deﬁnitional statements like answers.com, wikipedia.org
and reference. com. Typically, 20—40 web searches are performed in parallel
to retrieve the deﬁnitions for one term.

Deﬁnitions are ranked higher according to six criteria regarding the term
A to be deﬁned and the differentia C: ﬁrst, the deﬁnition contains A literally;
second, the deﬁnition starts with A; third, A is the deﬁnition’s subject; forth,
C starts with an ontology term; ﬁfth, C starts with a noun phrase; sixth, the
relation A is a B is found literally. The text processing is the same as for the
term generation.

Ontology referencing: with the help of the Ontology Lookup Service
developed by the EBI (Cote et al., 2006) we map newly generated terms to
OBO terms and within OB O—Edit to the loaded ontology. Terms are regarded
as similar if they show a Hamming distance of <20% of the length of the
shorter term label or synonym. Hamming distance denotes the number of
position two strings differ. We align strings from the beginning and include
the length of overlapping tails in the distance.

Taxonomy induction: given deﬁnitions of the form ‘A is a B with property
C’ we extract existing terms similar to B (again Hamming distance)
as candidate parents in a parent—child relationship. All ontology terms
are ranked starting with the identical term, known parents from other
ontologies, predicted parents from conﬁrmed deﬁnitions, predicted parents
from generated deﬁnitions and ﬁnally terms syntactically similar to the term
to deﬁne. We created an index over all ontology terms to allow fast searching
and ﬁltering.

Evaluation of the term generation: we used the GO (as of 14 November
2009) and 13 sub trees of MeSH2010 (as of 29 October 2009). We
randomly selected 1000 terms from MeSH for term generation and 500
from MeSH and 500 from GO for deﬁnition generation (see Supplementary
Tables SS and S6). During the evaluation, terms have been automatically
mapped to existing ontologies. For OBO, we use the EBI Ontology Lookup
Service, Dec 2009) and for the Uniﬁed Medical Language System (UMLS)
version 2006AB. Mappings are listed in Supplementary Table S4. For term
generation completeness is measured in terms of recall, the ration of retrieved
relevant terms from all known relevant terms. Precision quantiﬁes the portion
from all generated terms which are indeed relevant. The F —measure is the
harmonic mean between precision and recall and allows to compare quality
with respect to one numeric value.

Evaluation of the deﬁnition generation: to evaluate deﬁnition generation, for
500 GO and 500 MeSH terms 10 deﬁnitions were generated and manually
labelled as either correct if they match the GO/MeSH deﬁnition or valid if
they were at least sensible and relevant. All generated deﬁnitions are listed
in Supplementary Tables S8 and S9. A deﬁnition was judged as correct
if it followed the original GO/MeSH deﬁnition with structure ‘A is a B
with property C’ by at least agreement in B followed by a reasonable good
C, or alternatively agreement in C, given a reasonable good B, typically
a more general or speciﬁc term than the original B (see examples in
Table 4). If generated deﬁnitions matched the GO/MeSH deﬁnition exactly
they were excluded since the likely source was the original deﬁnition. This
happened ﬁve times out of 10 000 deﬁnitions. Since GO terms rarely appear
literally in text, see e.g. (Ogren et al., 2004), deﬁnitions for GO terms
have been evaluated excluding common pre— and post—ﬁxes. Example for
‘myosin binding’ we generated for ‘myosin’ the deﬁnition ‘Myosin is a
protein possessing multiple functions integral to muscle contraction, force
generation, muscle development, and production of high—quality processed
meats.’, which we compared to the original GO deﬁnition. We excluded
the pre— and post—ﬁxes ‘activation’, ‘activity’, ‘binding’, ‘regulation of”,
‘localization’, ‘development’, ‘transport’, ‘catabolic process’, ‘metabolic
process’, and ‘biosynthetic process’. This applied to 307 of the 500 GO
terms. The quality for deﬁnition extraction is measures in terms of precision,
recall and F -measure.

4 RESULTS

DOG4DAG is the ﬁrst ontology generation systems that has been
thoroughly validated in the life science domain. It is fully integrated
into the established ontology editor OBO—Edit and supports the
creation and extension of OBO ontologies by semi—automatically
generating terms, deﬁnitions and parent—child relationships from
text and web search results. As the quality of these suggestions
made by automatic methods is of great importance for the overall
usefulness and acceptance, we systematically evaluated it.

4.1 Evaluation of term generation

As the relevance of terms is often subjective, we evaluated the
quality by checking how many generated terms are already part
of existing manually designed ontologies. This reveals whether
signiﬁcant noun phrases according to our term generation have a

Table S4. Relatively independent of the number of terms, over 80%
of the generated terms are similar to UMLS terms. Over 40% of the
generated terms exist in OBO or MeSH. Results for UMLS are best
since it is the largest terminology with nearly 10 million terms which
include GO, MeSH and OBO terms. This shows that our notion
of statistically signiﬁcant noun phrases is a good approximation
to manually deﬁned term labels. The numbers for G0 are lower
(13%) since the GO terms usually do not appear literally in text. We
analyzed the distance of the query MeSH term to the generated term
if it exists in MeSH. Figure 2 (bottom) shows that 15% of terms map
out the direct neighbourhood, i.e. are synonyms, siblings, parent,
children, etc., having a distance to the query term 5 3. Around 20%
of terms are semantically distant and have a distance > 10. Thus,
the generated terms represent several possibly relevant aspects of
the documents.

Nearly all of GO an MeSH terms are deﬁned. 54.1—56.2% of terms are deﬁned via an
ancestor, 15.8—36.6% via a parent term.

4.2 Evaluation of deﬁnition generation

Deﬁnition generation was evaluated 2-fold: ﬁrst, on a benchmark
set of 50 questions of the TRE C2003 deﬁnitional question answering
task and second, on manually created deﬁnitions of existing GO and
MeSH terms.

Evaluation (TREC2003): We evaluated the deﬁnition extraction
method based on questions and answers of the TREC2003 task on
deﬁnitional question answering (Voorhees, 2003). Given a document
corpus, this task required participants to ﬁnd answers for the
questions. In our validation the aim was to prove, that searching
the web with our deﬁnitional patterns and ranking is suitable to
retrieve deﬁnitions. For a deﬁnitional question like ‘Who is Charles
Lindberg?’ or ‘What is a golden parachute?’ the deﬁnitions for the
contained noun phrase ‘Charles Lindberg’ and ‘golden parachute’
have been generated. For 50 questions, the generated deﬁnitions
have been manually compared with the answers given by the
assessors board. For 20 questions out of 50 (40%) the top candidate
deﬁnition was a correct deﬁnition. In 74% (37/50) of the cases a
correct deﬁnition was found in the top 5 and in 90% (45/50) a
correct deﬁnition could be found in the top 10 terms. For only ﬁve
questions the method failed to ﬁnd correct deﬁnitions. These results
are in line with the top competition results with 0.21 precision of the
best system (Liu et al., 2003; Table 2). See Supplementary Table S7
for all questions, generated deﬁnitions and manual curation.

Evaluation (MeSH and GO deﬁnitions): the comparison to
TREC2003 is encouraging and allows to compare the method to
the state—of—the—art, but does not cover the life sciences. For a
speciﬁc evaluation against biomedical ontologies, we compared the
generated to manually created deﬁnitions. On the whole, nearly
all GO and MeSH terms have deﬁnitions with an average of
24 words (GO) and 30 words (MeSH) and contain 2.4 ontology
terms (GO) and 5.7 (MeSH) (Table 5). To assess how well—
generated deﬁnitions can approximate manually created deﬁnitions,
we randomly selected 500 GO and 500 MeSH terms (listed in
Supplementary Tables S5 and S6) and manually veriﬁed whether
generated deﬁnitions matched the GO/MeSH deﬁnition or in another
case gave useful information. For these 1000 terms, we generated
10 deﬁnitions each. All 10 000 generated deﬁnitions were manually
veriﬁed whether they matched the GO/MeSH deﬁnition (correct) or
were proper deﬁnitions of acceptable quality (valid).

A number of example deﬁnitions and whether they were
considered as correct or only valid are provided in Table 4. The

Within top 5 27.8 54.6 49.8 72.6
Within top 10 27.8 54.6 53.6 78.2

 

For 22 — 38% of terms the top ranked deﬁnition captured aspects of the true deﬁnition,
in 41 —47% it was a valid deﬁnition, but not similar to the original one. Within the top
10 ranked deﬁnitions a valid deﬁnition was found for 55 —78% of terms.

complete list of all generated deﬁnitions is given in Supplementary
Tables S8 and S9.

The top deﬁnition was in over 40% valid, meaning that is was
a proper deﬁnition containing useful information about the term.
The results increased to 55% (GO) and 78% (MeSH) for the top 10
deﬁnitions (Table 6). Over half of these 78% were actually correct
deﬁnitions showing that the automated deﬁnitions are by and large
of accetable quality for interactive ontology generation.

4.3 Evaluation of taxonomy induction

Parent—child relations from deﬁnition: taxonomy induction, i.e.
ﬁnding parent—child relationships, is an easy problem if one has
a deﬁnition of the form ‘A is a B with property C’, where B is
the parent of A. Nearly all deﬁnitions in GO and MeSH mention
at least one term. But, Table 5 also shows that only 16% (GO)
and 37% (MeSH) contain the parent in the deﬁnition. However,
it increases to over 50% when B is not necessarily the parent
but an ancestor of the deﬁned term. Interestingly, some of the
sub—ontologies, namely organism, anatomy, geography and cellular
component provide much better results with values of over 70% (for
a detailed break down see Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). As a
consequence, DOG4DAG uses its generated deﬁnitions as source
for predicted parents.

Based on the 10000 deﬁnitions generated for 1000 terms in
Section 4.2, we tested how many deﬁnitions contain the parent or an
ancestor of the term the deﬁnition was generated for (Table 7). For
13% (GO) and the 26% (MeSH) the top 10 generated deﬁnitions
contained the direct parent term, thus DOG4DAG will predict it.
For 38% (GO) and 54% (MeSH) the top 10 generated deﬁnitions
contained an ancestor term, thus DOG4DAG will predict some
correct, but indirect, ancestor relationship. For the vast majority of
GO and MeSH terms already the top ranked generated deﬁnition
contains the parent/ancestor. The numbers for ancestors within
the top 10 generated deﬁnitions correspond nicely to the manual
curations in Table 6, with a correct deﬁnition in the top 10 for 28%
of the GO and 54% of the MeSH terms.

Parent—child relations from co-occurrences: pattern—based methods
as discussed above are known to show high precision but very
low recall (Hearst, 1992). To investigate whether more data could
increase the number of predictions, we also validated a statistical
approach based on similarity of document vectors. The key idea is
to represent all terms as high dimensional binary document vector,
which indicates whether the term is present in the documents or
not. Next, the distance between two terms is deﬁned as the cosine

similarity of their document vectors. In the second phase of the
algorithm, a graph is deﬁned. If two terms have distance below a
given threshold, then an edge between the two terms is added. The
graph is undirected and hence not yet suitable to infer parent—child
relations. This is achieved by identifying the most central term in
the graph and deﬁning this term as root. A similar method has been
described in (Heymann and Garcia—Molina, 2006) in the context of
social networks and image tagging.

With this statistical approach we obtained 23 270 parent—child
relations for MeSH. Depending on the threshold (see Fig. 3), the
statistical approach achieves a precision of 27% with recall of 2%.
If nearly correct relations are considered precision increases to 34%
(Table 8). The statistical approach demonstrates that taxonomic
relationships can be predicted without linguistic information,
although not for all areas, and not for the whole MeSH. As a positive
example consider Figure 3, which shows relations for the MesH
term blood with over 60% correctly identiﬁed parent—child relations.
Since the approach is computationally intensive (generated terms
have to be found in all documents and pairwise distance has to be
computed), it is not feasible to run it on a desktop computer and is
hence not part of the plug—in.

For 26% of the 500 randomly selected MeSH terms the parent and for 54% some ancestor
could be found in the top 10 generated deﬁnitions.

4.4 Runtime

In DOG4DAG, processing terms from 250 scientiﬁc abstracts
takes 3—4 s and a 250 page PDF document 7 s. Generating deﬁnitions
for a term takes <5 s. This allows DOG4DAG to be part of an
interactive application, such as the OBO—Edit Ontology Generation
plug—in.

5 DISCUSSION

In the following sections, we will discuss DOG4DAG in relation to
other tools supporting aspects of automatic ontology creation and
will take position on how DOG4DAG’s input complies to the design
guidelines proposed by (Schober et al., 2009).

5.1 Ontology learning tools

Over the past few years some text—mining approaches and systems
for ontology learning have been developed such as TerMine,
Text20nto, OntoLT for Protege or Ontoleam.

TerMine based on the C—value method (Frantzi et al., 2000)
retrieves and ranks multi—word phrases. Since 15% of all MeSH
terms and synonyms, as well as most gene names consist of a
single word, DOG4DAG’s inclusion of single words as terms is an
important extension not present in TerMine. DOG4DAG achieves
this by ranking terms according to their relative importance (tf-idf).
The grouping of all lexical variants and abbreviations leads to better
frequency counts and less noise. Text20nto (Cimiano and Velker,
2005) is an ontology learning framework including a graphical
user interface which supports terminology recognition, hypernymic
and mereological relationship extraction. The OntoLT Protege Plug—
in [olp.dﬂ<i.de/OntoLT/OntoLT.htm] includes rule—based extraction
of candidate terms and relations based on linguistic features of
provided texts. Both systems build on strong linguistic foundations

but require user input prior to the generation of terms or relations,
such as the creation of rules in Text20nto and an annotated corpus
of documents for OntoLT (Buitelaar et al., 2004). Our evaluation
in Alexopoulou et al. (2008) showed, that the term generation of
DOG4DAG performs equally or better than other state—of—the—art
systems like Text20nto and TerMine.

5.2 Design guidelines

An important question is whether generated terms satisfy naming
guidelines proposed for manually created terms as put forward
by Schober et al. (2009). The authors comprehensively evaluated
existing open biomedical ontologies and deﬁned a number of
guidelines for naming concepts to reach acceptance by the
community. This is satisﬁed by all term generation approaches
since they are based on text, which should be the output of the
community in question. In DOG4DAG, this is additionally satisﬁed
by supporting generation of terms from PubMed abstracts, web
queries, text ﬁles and repositories of PDF documents. According
to Schober et al., abbreviations should be captured with the terms.
This is indeed the case in DOG4DAG, which groups variations of
terms and their abbreviations. Schober et al. promote the avoidance
of ambiguity. In DOG4DAG, ambiguous terms are easily identiﬁed
through their generated deﬁnitions and can hence be avoided.
Schober et al. also recommend to avoid negations and conjunction
in terms. Since negations and conjunctions are rarely used directly
in text, DOG4DAG does not suffer from this problem. We found that
for in total 420 000 terms generated for the evaluation in section 4.1
only 10 contained the words without, excluding or not and only 462
the word and Schober et al. also emphasize the importance of term
re—use. DOG4DAG supports the re—use of existing ontology terms
by checking whether terms or their discovered variants exist in other
OBO ontologies. If this is the case, the use of the existing term label
is recommended and it is offered to include the terms descendants.

5.3 Biocuration

Winnenburg et al. (2008) conclude that manual curation of literature
is necessary for high—quality annotation but can be supported
by automated methods. Systems like Textpresso (Muller et al.,
2004) successfully support manual curation and recently have been
estimated to speed up the curation process of C.elegans proteins to
GO cellular components at least 8—fold (Van Auken et al., 2009).
Integrated in the GO annotation process described by Hill
et al. (2008), DOG4DAG helps to identify appropriate ontology
annotation terms, by showing the GO terms used in literature and
in the same way collecting the literature reference to include in the

annotation record. In cases where novel terms need to be created
DOG4DAG will help to deﬁne and place the new term in the GO.

Deﬁnitions of terms in ontologies are important, but cumbersome
to deﬁne. As Table 5 showed nearly all GO and MeSH terms are
deﬁned. However, for more specialized ontologies, this is not the
case. In over 90 0B0 ontologies, there are 99418 terms without
deﬁnition. Thus, there is a huge potential to save manual labor when
deﬁning terms using DOG4DAG.

5.4 Limitations

There are two major limitations: the ability to compose terms and
the ability to extract speciﬁc relations.

Composition of terms: currently, there are many efforts to
understand the composition of ontology terms following patterns
(Mungall, 2004; Ogren et al., 2004). In Aranguren et al. (2008) the
authors discussed two design patterns for terms. DOG4DAG does
not support such a composition process. However, DOG4DAG’s
ﬁltering of terms helps to realize the value partition pattern. For
example, after a search for ‘stem cell’ one can ﬁlter to keep only
terms containing ‘stem cell’ obtaining among others the value
partition ‘mesenchymal’, ‘hematopoetic’ and ‘neural’.

Extraction of speciﬁc relations: the second limitation of DOG4DAG
is the extraction of relations as promoted in (Smith et al., 2005;
Soldatova and King, 2005). The latter, also mentions that ontologies
should contain axioms. DOG4DAG only deals with extraction of
parent—child relationships. Since part of speech tagging is used there
is in principle the possibility to extract relations from verb phrases.
But since this requires both terms to appear in one sentence, the
coverage would be much lower and is therefore currently omitted.

6 CONCLUSION

Overall, the above results show a high number of existing ontology
terms among the generated terms, show the ability to generate valid
deﬁnitions for up to 78% of terms, and show the prediction of up
to 54% taxonomic relations to parents or ancestors in MeSH or
G0. Thus, our results demonstrate that text—mining can support
ontology engineers with highly relevant terms, deﬁnitions and
parent—child relations. Ontologies are unlikely to be ever fully
automatically generated, but text—mining can contribute to a semi—
automated interactive creation process, which satisﬁes accepted
design guidelines.

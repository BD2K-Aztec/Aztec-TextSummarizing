Abstract

Motivation: Next generation sequencing technologies have revolutionized our ability to rapidly
and affordany generate vast quantities of sequence data. Once generated, raw sequences are
assembled into contigs or scaffolds. However, these assemblies are mostly fragmented and in—
accurate at the whole genome scale, largely due to the inability to integrate additional informative
datasets (e.g. physical, optical and genetic maps). To address this problem, we developed a
semi—automated software tool—Genome Puzzle Master (GPM)—that enables the integration of
additional genomic signposts to edit and build ‘new—gen—assemblies‘ that result in high—quality ‘an—
notation—ready’ pseudomolecules.

Results: With GPM, loaded datasets can be connected to each other via their logical relationships
which accomplishes tasks to ‘group,’ ‘merge,’ ‘order and orient‘ sequences in a draft assembly.
Manual editing can also be performed with a user—friendly graphical interface. Final pseudomole—
cules reflect a user‘s total data package and are available for long—term project management. GPM
is a web—based pipeline and an important part of a Laboratory Information Management System
(LIMS) which can be easily deployed on local servers for any genome research laboratory.
Availability and Implementation: The GPM (with LIMS) package is available at https://github.com/

of bases from a single lane over several days (depending upon com—
plexity) (Schatz et 61]., 2010). PacBio produces hundreds of thou—
sands of long—read error—corrected sequences (up to 20 kb average
read lengths) that can be produced in 3—6 h per SMRT cell. Data
generated by either platform can be used independently, or in

combination, to successfully assemble genomes de novo (Alkan
et al., 2011; Chin et al., 2013; Kajitani et al., 2014). Many assem—
blers have been developed to assemble raw sequence reads into se—
quence contigs (i.e. minimum sequence units for an assembly), such
as SOAPdenovo (Luo et al., 2012), Allpaths (Butler et al., 2008;
MacCallum et al., 2009), HGAP (Chin et al., 2013), or Falcon
(https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/FALCON—integrate). A few
programs or packages (e.g. Bambus, ABACAS, Mauve Aligner,
ALLMAPS, etc.) are also available for scaffolding contigs (Assefa
et al., 2009; Hunt at al., 2014; Pop et al., 2004; Rissman et al.,
2009; Tang et al., 2015). However, software tools that can be used
to inspect/edit NGS sequence assemblies, as well as integrate other
evidence types (i.e. physical and genetics maps) to produce an as—
sembly that more accurately and completely reflects the native struc—
ture of a given genome, are currently lacking.

To analyze, manage and incorporate genome datasets for diverse
sequencing projects, such as pseudomolecule construction for the
maize and several wild Oryza genome sequencing projects (Schnable
et al., 2009; J. Stein et al., submitted for publication; Wei et al.,
2009), we developed a software tool called ‘Genome Puzzle Master’
(GPM). GPM does not require sophisticated bioinformatics skills or
support, and the final products are ready to use in the form of
annotation—ready pseudomolecules. GPM can also facilitate the in—
corporation of additional datasets as new refinements are generated.
Here we make GPM available to researchers who have NGS genome
assemblies and other unlinked genomic datasets, and are struggling to
generate ‘annotation—ready’ or ‘submission—ready’ pseudomolecules.

2 Methods

GPM is a key part of a web—based Laboratory Information
Management System (LIMS) that we developed to manage and ana—
lyze genomic data at different levels from both wet and dry lab ex—
periments. The LIMS is set up in a LAMP environment (Linux
operating system, Apache HTTP Server, MySQL database software
and Perl programing language) and requires additional libraries and
software listed in Supplementary Table S1. We used jQuery (plus
UI), a fast and concise JavaScript library, to build GPM’s highly
interactive web applications.

A database schema was designed which contains one main table
called ‘matrix’ to record most types of data from ‘wet’ or ‘dry’ lab
experiments (Supplementary Table S2), and several extra tables (e.g.
‘lz'n/e’, ‘alignment’) to store relationship data. Combined with these
tables, we can extensively handle all types of datasets and connect
them logically. In our database, the expansibility is ﬂexible, as we
can either add a new type of ‘container’ in the ‘matrix’ table or cre—
ate another table for new data if needed, depending on the data
type. For example, huge amounts of individual clone information
can potentially cause process servers to slow down while performing
complicated search operations on the ‘matrix’ table; hence, we spe—
cifically created a ‘clone’ table to store this type of data and separ—
ately can run queries on it to avoid concurrent queries on the
‘matrix’ table. To include additional information for certain
existing data types, we extended the ability to store more inform-
ative data by adopting the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), a
lightweight data—interchange format, in the ‘note’ field of the ‘ma-
trix’ table.

GPM can currently utilize data categorized into different types,
such as sequence contigs/scaffolds, Bacterial Artificial Chromosome
(BAC) clone end—sequences (BESs), and reference genome sequences
(RefSeq) that are the basic input elements for GPM assemblies.

Different data types can be connected to one another via their se—
quence relationships. For example, AGP (a golden path, https://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/agp/AGP_Specification/) informa-
tion can describe the assembly of a larger sequence object (e.g. a
contig, a scaffold, or a chromosome) from smaller objects and list
their relationships. Most importantly, these kinds of relationships
are used to link multiple datasets and to logically integrate genomic
data with accuracy.

To demonstrate a GPM assembly result, here we specifically
defined two terms, ‘assemblthg’ for a GPM assembly contig and
‘assemblySeq’ for a sequence component that belongs to an
assemblthg. Both data types are stored in the ‘matrix’ table as indi—
vidual containers. In the database, a record of assemblthg describes
its constituent members (assemblySeqs) and attributes (e.g. length,
chromosome number and position); and an assemblySeq records the
original sequence and the actual part and status of the component
sequence (e.g. coordinates and orientation) that contributes to its
corresponding assemblthg. A complete GPM assembly contains a
set of assemblthgs, which are formed by various numbers of
assemblySeqs.

3 Results

3.1 Information—guided assembly

To build pseudomolecules from sequence contigs with reference in-
formation, a GPM ‘assemblyRun’ execution (Fig. 1) can be divided
into 11 optional operations:

1. Assembly initialization. First, to initialize a new assembly,
GPM converts all de novo assembled sequences into
assemblySeqs and each assemblySeq is assigned to a single
assemblthg. (Note: This operation can be skipped for an
existing assembly to avoid losing any manual edits.)

2. Seq—to—Seq alignment. Depending on the potential relationship
of all sequence elements, GPM can prepare overlapping align-
ments among all sequences in an assembly by running a ‘Seq—
to—Seq’ pre—calculation with ‘blastn’ (NCBI BLAST 2.2.29—l—, E-
value :1e—200) (Camacho et al., 2008) as the default alignment
engine. Pre—calculation parameters can be customized as
needed. Overlap information between sequence contigs can be
used in later processing steps, e.g. to determine the orientation
of two neighboring sequences.

3. Physical reference (PR)—guided assembly. Based on an existing
physical reference, such as a physical map (PM) or an AGP ﬁle,
sequences will be assigned to assemblthgs. If an AGP ﬁle is
available, object—component information is used to build links
between sequences. If a FingerPrinted Contig (FPC) ﬁle (Nelson
et al., 2005) is available, we use PM contig—clone information
to connect potentially neighboring sequences and merge two
assemblySeqs from neighboring BACs on PMs into an
assemblthg. Assemblthgs will only be merged when overlap—
ping evidence is detected. For a non—PR—based whole genome
shotgun (WGS) project, the original sequences would be loaded
into GPM, and this operation would be skipped. To build
assemblthgs, the default parameters for merging two
sequences are ‘minOverlapSeqToSeq : 1000 bp’ and
‘identitySeqToSeq: 99%,’ plus the overlap should be at both
ends of each sequence.

4. Seq—to—Genome alignment. This operation allows the user to
run the alignment engine (‘blastn’ as default, E—value :1e—200)
to search against reference genome sequences by using the ori—
ginal sequences of all assemblySeqs. The alignment information

can be used to ‘group,’ ‘order,’ and ‘orient’ assemblthgs at a
chromosomal scale. Depending on the similarity between the
RefSeq and the to—be—assembled sequence, alignment param—
eters can be varied and tested by the user. GPM currently sup—
ports blastn, megablast (Camacho et al., 2008) and BLAT
(Kent at al., 2002) as alignment engines for sequence compari—
son. Users can choose a proper alignment engine to accelerate
GPM’s performance. For example, megablast or BLAT can be
chosen for aligning sequences with high similarities since they

run faster than blastn (in most situations). Importantly, to min-
imize the misleading impacts of repetitive sequences in both to—
be—assembled and reference datasets during this step, users can
(i) activate the ‘Mark Repeat Region’ option to ﬁlter out any
non-unique alignments, which will not be considered as evi—
dence to guide a GPM assembly; or (ii) select the alternative
‘Soft Masking’ option for the blastn/megablast alignment pro—
cessing if repetitive regions in reference sequences have already
been soft—masked for an assembly.

5. Chromosome number assignment. If a high—quality reference
genome is available, we prefer to use it as a guide to automatic—
ally assign chromosome numbers to assemblthgs.
Alternatively, chromosome assignments can also be performed
manually in a batch mode.

6. Redundant assemblySeq removal. GPM will mask and
remove a buried or redundant sequence according to the
alignment information processed in operation 2. Here a
redundant sequence is deﬁned as a sequence that can be fully
aligned by two neighboring sequences and the two neigh—
boring sequences have end—overlapped alignment (default

parameters ‘minOverlapSeqToSeq : 1000 bp’ and
‘identitySeqToSeq : 99%’). Such assemblySeqs would be
marked as redundant and are hidden in the ﬁnal assembly.
Masking redundancies can reduce the computational com—
plexity of orienting assemblySeqs and assemblthgs.

7. Non—redundant assemblySeq orientation. In a multi-
assemblySeq contig, GPM can orient sequences based on
overlap data. This operation is performed on the premise that
an overlapping region of two neighboring sequences
should be at the end of each sequence, speciﬁcally at the
right end of a pre—assemblySeq, and at the left end of the next—
assemblySeq. GPM adjusts the orientation of these
assemblySeqs to ﬁt the premise accordingly with the proper
extension of both non—overlapping parts that will elongate an
expanding contig. GPM determines the orientation of each
initial seed assemblySeq and then the subsequent assemblySeq
one—by—one.

8. Assemblthg orientation. Using a reference genome, GPM can
orient assemblthgs according to the linear information sug-
gested by the ‘Seq—to—Genome’ alignment data.

9. End—to—End assemblthg merge. In some cases, physically over—
lapping sequences can be separated into two different
assemblthgs due to the lack of strong evidence derived from
the guide data, for example, when there is weak evidence to
merge two contigs during a PM construction step. These kinds
of situations usually arise from BACs located at the ends of PM
contigs, and as a consequence, assemblySeqs of these BACs are
also found at assemblthg ends. Detection of end—to—end over—
laps between neighboring assemblthgs facilitates merging into
larger assemblthgs.

10. Redundancies in overlapping regions removed. Overlapping se—
quences between two neighboring assemblySeqs are considered
redundant, and one redundant portion of either assemblySeq is
removed from the ﬁnal pseudomolecule. Here GPM makes no
preferences on which overlapping sequence is retained.
However, if evidence is provided that one overlapping sequence
is of a higher quality than the other, then the highest quality se—
quence will be retained.

11. Assemblthgs ordered and/or renumbered. GPM can sort
assemblthgs based on their chromosomal number and pos—
ition and provide an option to renumber assemblthgs in their
proper order.

After running an automated GPM assembly, the user is also
able to manually check and edit the assembly (Fig. 2). With the
visualization function, GPM can provide a convenient way to
manually check and edit an assembly, thereby eliminating the
need to rely solely on automated assembly results. Relationships
among datasets (including BAC sequences, BESs, physical maps,
reference sequences, etc.) can logically guide assembly operations,
including but not limited to grouping, merging, ordering and

orienting. All manual editing steps are saved automatically, so the
entire editing process can be reproduced and quality checked.
Upon completion of an editing step, GPM can be used to export
contig sequences, chromosome—based pseudomolecules and AGP
files in real time.

3.2 Application ofthe GPM pipeline to assemble two
high—quality reference genome sequences for indica
rice: a case study

Recently, our consortia published two high—quality reference gen—
ome sequences for the two main varietal groups of indica rice—
Zhenshan 97 (ZS97) and Minghui 63 (MH63) (Zhang et al.,
2016a,b). These genomes were primarily sequenced using PacBio
long-read sequencing of minimum tiling path BAC pools, combined
with Illumina WGS assembled contigs to fill gaps. Once individual
BAC sequences were assembled they were loaded into GPM for as—
sembly editing and pseudomolecule construction.

Following is a summary of how these data were used to assemble
two of the highest quality indica rice genome assemblies produced
to date:

To assemble the ZS97 and MH63 genomes, the following data—
sets were loaded in to GPM: (i) Whole Genome Profiling (WGP, van
Oeveren et al., 2011) sequence—based PMs for each genome; and (ii)
5363 assembled BAC sequences (including duplicates for the same
BAC clones sequenced in multiple jobs or pools) from 188 HGAP
jobs for ZS97, and 6,801 from 313 jobs for MH63. Here we take
ZS97 as an example to demonstrate the assembly procedure once
these data were loaded (Supplementary Fig. S1). To start a new as—
sembly, we set the ‘FPC: ZS97 v.1’ PM as the physical reference and
the ‘IRGSP—MSU’ (i.e. O.sativa subsp. japonica cv. Nipponbare gen—
ome sequence, Kawahara et al., 2013) as the reference genome. We
checked ‘Assign chromosome number for contigs’ and ‘Orient con—
tigs based—on reference genome’ since both ZS97 and Nipponbare
belong to the same genus and species (i.e. O.satiz/a), and minor dif—
ferences between the to—be—assembled and reference genomes would
not mislead the results because they are so closely related. ‘Seq—to—
Seq Alignment’ was used to pre—build all possible overlapping rela—
tionships among all BAC sequences since it was expected that those
should be connected. ‘Seq—to—Genome Alignment’ was also used to
map all BAC sequences to the reference genome. We also utilized
the ‘End—to—End Merge,’ ‘Auto—Orient Sequences’ and ‘Filter
Redundant Sequences and Overlaps’ options. (Note: A similar pro-
cess was used to assemble the MH63 genome, except we used the
‘FPC: MH63 v.1’ PM as the physical reference.)

After manual checking, editing and removing redundancies, the
final assembly products yielded 318 (ZS97, composed of 3862
assemblySeqs) and 216 (MH63, composed of 3256 assemblySeqs)
assemblthgs that were ordered, oriented, and assigned to their ap—
propriate chromosomes. The ‘assemblthg’ sequences were used as
the primary frameworks to build pseudomolecules after gap—filling
sequences were integrated during the second round of GPM assem—
bly (Zhang et al., 2016b).

4 Discussion

GPM is an integrated pipeline for generating and editing pseudomo—
lecules from existing next gen sequence assembles using evidence—
based guides such as reference sequences, physical maps, genetic
maps and paired BESs. We demonstrated how GPM can be used to
generate high—quality submission—ready pseudomolecules for two
indica rice accessions, ZS97 and MH63, by the integration of BAC-

Fig. 2. Visualization of typical available data in GPM. (A) GPM assemblthg view of a 500-KB region. AssemblySeqs, top and bottom, are shown as overlapping
(yellow) and fully redundant assemblySeqs are gray. The retained (green) and removed (gray) portions of assemblySeqs are indicated. (B) Chromosome-scale
view of a 500-KB region that compares two genome assemblies to a Reference sequence. The Reference Sequence is shown in the middle (bright green) with
alignments (yellow) to each assemblthg (violet) at the top and bottom. The assemblthg order can be changed by drag-and-drop

based physical maps and reference sequence guides. To perform an
assembly with GPM, not all the resources like those used for ZS97
and MH63 are required, but GPM does require at least one guide
type (e.g. genetic, physical or genome reference). Since GPM does
not reassemble sequence data from the original short/long reads, the
kind and quality of the evidence—based guides will greatly affect the
amount of time required for editing and will impact the final quality
of an assembly. Using a reference genome in a GPM assembly is
quite valuable, however, the utilization of more evidence guides can
greatly enhance the ability to build high—quality pseudomolecules
and to avoid the overuse of the reference sequences in conforming a
GPM assembly to mimic a RefSeq. If a reference genome is the only
evidence to guide an assembly, then reference sequence overuse mis—
takes can’t be avoided. However, using other information that is
available could detect overuse errors which would be corrected

during a manual check step (which is not labor—intensive and
strongly recommended) with GPM. Hence, evidence data are key
factors used to build high—quality GPM assemblies.

In the current version of our LIMS, we can track each processing
step from BAC library construction to the final genome assembly
seamlessly during the entire phase of a sequencing project. BAC li—
brary resources and wet lab sequencing runs are recorded in our sys—
tem. As a part of the LIMS, GPM supports FASTA—formatted
sequences. However, the ability to deal with raw reads has been lim-
ited due to their huge data size. Some additional features, such as
paired end/mate and MTP information, are partially adapted for
assembly manipulation in the version of GPM.
Pseudomolecules in FASTA format with an AGP file can be gener-

current

ated as the final output for further downstream analysis and public
repository sequence submissions (e.g. GenBank).

Fig. 3. Flowchart for processing unitigs with postHGAP

The LIMS can be expanded to integrate new functions for a spe—
cific project as needed. For example, we built a pipeline called
‘postHGAP’ to perform circularization and identification of BAC se—
quences for the two rice genome sequencing projects described above
(Fig. 3). As reported in our data descriptor (Zhang et al., 2016b), we
used a map—based BAC—pool sequencing strategy to produce se—
quence data that were assembled into a set of sequences (termed uni—
tigs by HGAP) for each pool. We were able to process the output of
each corresponding HGAP job to circularize and identify BAC se-
quences properly using related data information in the LIMS as fol-
lows: (i) postHGAP first filtered unitigs with lengths shorter than 10
kb, then (ii) trimmed vectors and circularized plasmid or BAC se—
quences according to pairs of sequences at specific breakpoints and
(iii) assigned BAC IDs to each sequence according to WGP tags or
BES information. During the postHGAP processing step, two param—
eters (default: minOverlap : 500 bp, overlapIdentity: 95 %) could
be set for sequence circularization and four optional parameters
(default: minCloneTagNumber : 5, tagMatchIdentity : 100%,
tagMatchPercent: 80%, besMatchIdentity: 98% if no WGP tags
available) for BAC ID assignment. The program ‘blastn’ (NCBI
BLAST 2.2.29—I—) was used to perform sequence comparison and
alignment analysis in postHGAP. As a result, a total of 501 HGAP
jobs (multiple runs for the same pool count multiple times) for 375
pools were run through postHGAP in this study and produced 12
164 BAC-ID—ready sequences (including duplicates for the same
BAC processed in multiple jobs or pools) for both ZS97 and MH63.
All BAC-ID-ready sequences were seamlessly converted as input
datasets for both GPM assemblies.

Technically, the use of a one—main—table database schema design
may simplify query processing. However, one possible disadvantage
for this schema is that the response time to query might be longer
with increasing amounts of data. Based upon our LIMS structure,
we used the new ‘container’ option for less complicated data and

created new tables for large datasets (e.g. clones). To date, we are
able to operate GPM smoothly on a 4x 12—core cluster with more
than 1.7 million data records. These kinds of strategies are recom—
mended for other users. We can provide free host services to aca—
demic projects of medium—size genomes (up to 1 Gb) with full
technical support.

Several WGS scaffolding packages (e.g. Bambus, Mauve Aligner,
ABACAS, ALLMAPS, etc.) treat assembled contig sequences as non—
overlapping and single—copy sequences. Unfortunately, these pack—
ages are not focused toward the handling of inherent sequence
redundancies and are not programmed to produce incremental
assemblies. Further, these scaffolding tools are all file—based and do
not provide a ﬂexible process for manual checking and editing, espe—
cially if the input data has been modified or updated. In contrast,
GPM is a relationship—based pipeline, which has the ﬂexibility to
edit and visualize assembled data, not only by showing the order
and orientation of contig sequences and sequence redundancies but
also by displaying the necessary guide information for easy user con—
firmation. One thing GPM cannot do is to assemble a genome
de novo from raw reads. This deficit can be compensated for by its
ability to import results (sequences and AGPs) from other assembly
programs to guide new and improved assemblies. The final quality
of a GPM assembly relies heavily on the quality and richness of the
guide information used. For example, if a draft genome assembly is
used as the guide rather than a map—based BAC—by—BAC assembly,
the quality of the GPM assembly will suffer.

DNA sequencing technologies and assembly programs change
rapidly, and the GPM pipeline presented here is no exception. We
will continue to improve the interactive functionalities of GPM, as
well as integrate additional tools to support more data types. With
GPM, data types are seamlessly linked and logically integrated into
an encompassing LIMS for all genomic data. GPM is an open source
software dynamically developed for the genomics research commu—
nity and can be extensively adapted/improved by different research
groups for their own applications.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Understanding the patterns of association between
polymorphisms at different loci in a population (linkage
disequilibrium, LD) is of fundamental importance in various
genetic studies. Many coefficients were proposed for measuring the
degree of LD, but they provide only a static view of the current LD
structure. Generative models (GMs) were proposed to go beyond
these measures, giving not only a description of the actual LD
structure but also a tool to help understanding the process that
generated such structure. GMs based in coalescent theory have
been the most appealing because they link LD to evolutionary
factors. Nevertheless, the inference and parameter estimation of
such models is still computationally challenging.

Results: We present a more practical method to build GM that
describe LD. The method is based on learning weighted Bayesian
network structures from haplotype data, extracting equivalence
structure classes and using them to model LD. The results obtained in
public data from the HapMap database showed that the method is a
promising tool for modeling LD. The associations represented by the
learned models are correlated with the traditional measure of LD DC
The method was able to represent LD blocks found by standard tools.
The granularity of the association blocks and the readability of the
models can be controlled in the method. The results suggest that the
causality information gained by our method can be useful to tell about
the conservability of the genetic markers and to guide the selection
of subset of representative markers.

Availability: The implementation of the method is available upon

1 INTRODUCTION

The detection of linkage disequilibrium (LD), the non—random
association of alleles at different loci in a population, and the
assessing of its intensity, extent and distribution is a fundamental
step in many genetic studies. In association studies, for example,
the search for the locus (or loci) responsible of a particular trait
or disease is narrowed to regions of high LD (LD blocks) where
genotyped genetic markers were observed to be associated with
the studied phenotype (Mueller, 2004). In population genetic,
LD patterns has been widely used to study the evolutionary and
demographic processes in a variety of animal and plant populations,
such as admixtures, migration and natural selection (Tishkoff et al.,
1996; Zhang et al., 2004). LD information was also useful to learn
more about the architecture of the human genome and its biology of
recombination (Pritchard and Przeworski, 2001).

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

A variety of coefﬁcients have been proposed to quantify the
intensity of LD (see Mueller, 2004 for a review). Pairwise
LD measures were the ﬁrst ones reported for this purpose,
which measure the overall allele association between two loci.
Popular examples of such measures are D’ and r2 (Hedrick,
1987). Subsequently, multi—locus LD coefﬁcients were proposed
to measure simultaneous allele associations among multiple loci.
Classical examples are the I A index and the coefﬁcient H (Mueller,
2004; Sabatti and Risch, 2002). Recently, information theory
was used to develop new LD coefﬁcients. Some examples are:
the coefﬁcent 8, based in entropy (Nothnagel et al., 2002); the
normalized mutual information (MIR) coefﬁcient (Zhang et al.,
2009); and the normalized relative entropy (ER) coefﬁcient (Liu
and Lin, 2005). This active search of LD coefﬁcients has been
accompanied with the development of various tools that display
LD measures in a comprehensive way. Examples of those tools
are: GOLDsurfer (Pettersson et al., 2004), Haploview (Barrett
et al., 2005) and LdCompare (Hao et al., 2007). This remarkable
interest in developing new measures and tools for studying LD
can be explained by the dramatic increase of public genotype data
[from the HapMap project (The International HapMap Consortium,
2003), for example], which at the same time enabled association
studies in a whole—genome scale that presented new statistical and
computational challenges due to the vast quantity of data collected.

Although some of the aforementioned LD measures and tools
were useful in characterizing LD at various genomic regions of
several populations, they are limited to provide a static view of the
LD structure in the studied region. In an attempt to go beyond these
measures some generative models (GMs) were proposed (Hudson,
2001; Li and Stephens, 2003; Maniatis et al., 2002; McVean et al.,
2002). GMs are useful because they model the process that generate
the observed data, providing the machinery to do inferences and
simulations of yet unobserved situations or to help understanding
the underlying generative process. Models based in coalescent
theory (Kingman, 2000) have been the most appealing GMs because
they relate LD to evolutionary factors, such as recombination rate,
migration and mutation. However, the parameter estimation and
inference in such models is still computationally challenging and
only applicable to short regions (Nicolas et al., 2006). A more
practical alternative to model LD is to learn probabilistic graphical
models (PGMs) directly from the observed genotype or haplotype
data, as proposed by Thomas and Camp (2004). PGM are a type
of GMs that have proven to be useful in modeling a variety of
complex real—world problems mainly due to the following reasons:
intuitive interpretability of the models, their ability to encode the
joint probability distribution with a reduced number of parameters
(Heckerman et al., 1995) and the existence of efﬁcient methods to
learn PGM from data and to make inferences. Because the learning

Modeling associations between genetic markers using Bayesian networks

 

of PGM from data is an empirical approach, the learned models are
not intended to describe LD in terms of evolutionary factors, but
rather to represent the current LD structure in an accurate, compact
and understandable way, which is important in genetic association
studies. In the present article, we propose the use of Bayesian
networks (BN) to model LD. BN (Pearl, 1988) are a type of PGM
that encode a joint probability distribution via a directed acyclic
graph (DAG), where nodes represent random variables and edges
represent dependencies between them. We choose BN because we
were interested in learning the causality of the associations, which
we found to give additional information about the LD structure.
Our approach is different from the previous works of Thomas
and Camp (2004) and Thomas (2005), which propose the use of
Markov networks to represent dependences between proximal loci
and several runs of simulated annealing algorithm to learn optimal
models. BN models are more naturally interpretable than Markov
networks, since the components (factors) of the factorized joint
probability distribution are associated to the model nodes instead of
cliques. The learning of the BN structures is based on the K2GA
algorithm (Larranaga et al., 1996), which ﬁnds the optimal BN
structure(s) through the combination of a global search [using a
genetic algorithm] GA on the space of topological orderings and a
local search (using the K2 greedy search method) on the subspace
delimited by each ordering. The learning method computes the
strength of each edge. The learned BN structures are grouped
into equivalence structure classes (set of BN with the same set of
dependence/independence relationships), which are represented by
a partially DAG (PDAG). The identiﬁcation of LD associations and
LD blocks are performed in these models. The method was tested in
public haplotype data from the HapMap database in three different
segments located in ENCODE regions. The results showed the
plausibility of the method in modeling LD, representing associations
and LD blocks consistent with standard tools. The effects of pruning
weak edges on the formation of association blocks are studied.
The correlation of the traditional measure D’ with the associations
represented by the PDAGs is also studied.

2 APPROACH
2.1 Data

We consider that we have in hand haplotype data obtained from
a given population. This data are formed by m haplotypes, each
one consisting of N marker loci sorted by their physical location in
the chromosome. Let xij denote the allele state of the j—th marker
in the haplotype i, which can be one of the allele set (1,2, ...,rj),
where rj is the number of alleles of marker j. The haplotypes
may be experimentally determined or inferred from genotype data
by a phasing algorithm [e.g. fastPHASE (Scheet and Stephens,
2006); BEAGLE (Browning and Browning, 2007)]. In the context
of BN, the j—th marker is modeled by a random variable  Thus,
an haplotype xi=(x,-1,...,xiN) is regarded as a realization of a
N —dimensional random variable X = (X 1 , ...,XN).

2.2 Bayesian networks

Bayesian networks (Neapolitan, 2003; Pearl, 1988) are a type
of PGM that can represent the conditional dependencies and
independencies between a set of random variables X = (X 1 , ...,XN)
via a DAG. A BN is composed by a model structure S and a

set of model parameters 0. The model structure is the qualitative
part of a BN and is formed by a DAG S=(V,E), where V
is the set of nodes representing the random variables X and
E is the set of edges representing the conditional dependencies
between the random variables of X. The model parameters are the
quantitative part of a BN that in conjunction with the DAG deﬁne
completely its joint probability distribution. The model parameters
are formed by N parameter vectors 02(61,...,6N) deﬁning the
conditional probability distributions of each variable, i.e. 6,- deﬁnes
the conditional probability distribution of Xi, P(xilpaiﬂi), where
xi represents the instantiation of the variable X,- and pal- represents
the instantiation of the parent variables of Xi, Pai. All BN have
the property that each variable is conditionally independent on its
non—descendants given its parent variables (Markov property). For
example, the BN {a—> b—> c} and {a <—b—> c} represent the same
independences (a and c are independent given I?) and, therefore, are
indistinguishable. The BN {a—>b <—c} differs from the previous
because it represent diferent independencies (a and c are marginally
independent and all other pairs are dependent). This property allows
the computation of the joint probability of any instantiation of
X, x, as the product of the local conditional probabilities: P(x)=

iii-1110m- pal-,6».

2.3 Structural learning of EN

The induction of BN structures from data is a NP—hard problem
(Chickering et al., 2004). We need a heuristic method to ﬁnd the
structure(s) that best reﬂect the dependency/independence relations
contained in the data. To this end, we take the idea of the K2GA
algorithm (Larranaga et al., 1996) to learn model structures from
haplotype data, as described below.

The main idea of K2GA is to ﬁnd optimal BN structures by
searching on the space of topological orderings using a combination
of global search (using a GA) and a local search [using the greedy
search K2 heuristic (Cooper and Herskovits, 1992)]. A topological
ordering (T0) is an ordering of the system variables X such that Vi, j ,
if comes before X,- in the ordering, namely (...,Xj, ...,Xi, ...), then
X,- can only have node  as a parent node. A TO, therefore, delimits
a subspace of structures. A GA is used to evolve a population of TOs.
Each T0 in the evolving population is evaluated by the K2 heuristic.
Such evaluation consists in ﬁnding the best structure within the
subspace of structures spanned by the TO. The data provided to
K2 are: the TO, a dataset D containing the observations of the
variables X, and an upper bound u on the number of parents a node
may have. For each node Xi, (i = 1, ...,N), K2 iteratively attempts
to add up to u edges from Anc(Xl-), the ancestors of X,- according
to the T0. In each iteration one node is selected from Anc(Xi) and
added to the set of parent nodes of Xi, Pai. The selected parent is
one whose addition most increases the structure score. K2 stops to
adding parents to the node X,- when u parents were added or when
no more ancestors in Anc(Xi) can increase the structure score. The
posterior probability of the structure given the data (Heckerman and
Chickering, 1995), known as BDe metric, is used as the structure
score, which is computed as follows:

P(SID>=ni-V=1g(i,Pa.-), (1)

- , _ qz' P(aij) 1’; P(aijk‘l—Nijk)
g(l,Pal)_

where rl- is the number of states of Xi, q, is the number of different
instantiations that the parents Pal- can take; Nljk is the number of
cases in D where X,- takes its k—th state and its parents Pal- take
their j—th state; Nij is the sum of Nljk over k; aljk is a prior on
Nljk, calculated as a/rl-qi when a uniform prior is considered with
equivalent sample size a; and alj is the sum over k of aljk. When
the logarithm of the structure score [Equation (1)] is applied, this
reduces to a sum of node scores, log(g(i,Pa,-)), which only depends
on the node X,- and its parents Pai. This modularization of the
structure score is advantageous to K2, which selects the set of parents
for each node X ,- based in the maximization of the node score instead
of the maximization of the whole structure score.

The strength of any edge is measured as the increase on the
structure score that the edge provokes when it is added to the
structure. For example, if a new parent node  is added to the set of
parents of Xi, i.e. an edge  —> Xi, the edge strength is computed as
log(g(i,PaiU)9))—log(g(i,Pai)). This strength is equivalent to the
logarithm of the Bayes factor.

The GA used to evolve TOs starts with an initial population
of ). TOs (called individuals in the context of the GA) generated
randomly. Then, each individual is evaluated with K2, which returns
the score of the best structure as the ﬁtness of the individual. The
following operators are then sequentially performed to create the
next generation (the evaluated population is referred as the current
generation). (i) Selection: ,0 pairs of individuals are selected from
the current generation to form a mating pool. The selection is
based on the individual’s ﬁtness using the roulette wheel algorithm.
(ii) Crossover: produces two new individuals (offspring) for each
pair of the mating pool. The order—based crossover operator OX2
(Larranaga et al., 1996) is used for this purpose. This operator is
only applied when a random number generated uniformly in the
interval [0, 1] is less than ,u, the crossover rate parameter, otherwise
the resulting offspring is replicated from the mating individuals.
(iii) Mutation: this is applied to each offspring individual resulting
of the previous step. The displacement mutation (DM) operator
(Larranaga et al., 1996) is used for this purpose. Like crossover,
this operator is only applied when a random number generated
uniformly in the interval [0,1] is less than i), the mutation rate
parameter, otherwise the offspring individual is left unchanged. (iv)
Scoring: evaluates the resulting offspring individuals after mutation
with the K2 heuristic. (v) Replacement: creates the next generation
by replacing the worst a individuals of the current generation with
the best a individuals of the offspring population, provided that
the replacing individuals are better than the replaced individuals.
The new generation is set as the current generation and a new loop
is started. The algorithm terminates when a predeﬁned number of
generations is reached.

2.4 Obtaining BN structure equivalence classes for
modeling LD

As pointed by Chickering (2002), it is more appropriate to learn
equivalence classes of network structures than single structures. An
equivalence class represents a group of structures that encode the
same set of dependence/independence relationships.

We took advantage on the ability of the above learning method
in generating several optimal BN structures (structures with the
same maximum ﬁtness found along the evolutionary process) to get
equivalence classes. All the optimal BN structures are analyzed and

grouped according to their topological connection, i.e. structures in
one group only differ in edge directions. Each group is represented
by a PDAG constructed by superimposing all the DAGs of the
group, as shown in Figure 1. The resulting PDAGs can serve to
characterize LD. Two genetic markers are associated if they are not
marginally independent, which imply that the corresponding nodes
are connected in a PDAG by a directed path or by a common ancestor
node. In the example of Figure 1 all the pair of nodes with the same
color are associated. Additionally, the pairs (3, 4) and (3, 5) are also
associated. We deﬁne an association block in a PDAG as the set of
the largest number of consecutive markers (consecutive in terms of
its physical location) that are associated with each other. In Figure 1,
two association blocks can be found, identiﬁed with different colors.

3 RESULTS

The described method was implemented in the C++ programming
language and tested in a 64—bit 2—core (2.1GHz) computer with
4 GB of RAM, running a Linux operating system. The graph
drawing was performed using the Graph Visualization Software
(www. graphviz. org).

To test the ability of the proposed approach in characterizing
LD, we used public data registered in the HapMap database (The
International HapMap Consortium, 2003). We chose three genomic
segment located in ENCODE1 regions of different chromosomes and
different populations, as shown in Table 1. ENCODE regions were
chosen due to their high density of genotyped SNPs markers and to
the availability of existing studies in such regions (The International
HapMap Consortium, 2005). The segments were selected increasing
their size and complexity of the LD patterns (Figs 4, 5 and 6), aiming
to test the method in different situations. The datasets were obtained
from the HapMap repository, version III release 2, via the Genome
Browser web application (http://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov) using the
option ‘Download Phased Haplotype Data’. The SNP markers with
minor allele frequency (MAF) < 0.03 were discarded, since they
have little polymorphism.

The following set of parameters were introduced to the learning
method in all tests: population size 2:20, couples in the mating
pool ,0 = 10, crossover rate ,u = 0.95, mutation rate 1) = 0.05, number
of replacement individuals in each generation a: 10, number of
generations = 300, maximum number of parents a node may have
u=#SNPs— 1. For clarity and space, we ﬁrst detail the results for
the ENm0 10_CHB +J PT dataset and then present summarized results
for the other datasets.

dataset. Only the ﬁrst 20 generations are shown, since the curves
remain unchanged in subsequent generations. As can be observed,
the ﬁrst optimal BN structure is found at the ﬁfth generation. Six
generations later the entire population converged to only optimal
BN structures (the average ﬁtness stabilizes at its maximum value).
This can be considered a fast convergence, since it is reached in
approximately the ﬁrst 4% of the total number of generations. We
use a predeﬁned high number of generations as a stopping criterion
because we were interested in exploring the topological diversity of
optimal BN structures to get equivalence classes (PDAGs).

All the optimal learned DAGs (a total of 5800 DAGs from
generations 11 to 300) were analyzed. Twelve different DAGs were
identiﬁed in that set, which were grouped into four different PDAGs,
each having 31 edges. One of these PDAGs is shown in Figure 3a.
The other PDAGs are similar to this ﬁgure, differing only in the
location of three edges. For each of these PDAGs was determined
the set of pairwise marker associations. No difference was found
between these four sets of pairwise associations. As can be observed,
two association blocks were identiﬁed in the PDAG, which are
consistent with the two LD blocks (Blockl and Block 2) found
in the triangular LD plot (Fig. 4) by the Haploview tool using the
Strong LD Spine block deﬁnition (Barrett et al., 2005).

With the aim to knowing how the associations and association
blocks are affected with the elimination of weak edges, we perform
two experiments in the PDAG of Figure 3a. In the ﬁrst experiment,
the edges with strengths lower than the ﬁrst quartile (the lower
quartile) were eliminated. The resulting PDAG is shown in Figure 3b
with 23 edges. There was no alteration either in the set of pairwise
associations or in the association blocks (these blocks are also
indicated with line segments at the top of the LD plot of Figure 4).

In the second experiment, the edges with strengths lower than the
second quartile (the worst half of edges) were eliminated. The
resulting PDAG is shown in Figure 3c. In this case the number of
pairwise associations fell from 63 to 49, but the association blocks
remained unchanged. This preservation of the association blocks
with the removal of signiﬁcant number of edges can be due to the
high compaction of the LD blocks.

A summary of results of executing the method in all datasets can be
found in Table 2. It can be observed that the convergence generation
increases with the number of markers, as well as the processing
time. This is an expected result, since the search space is bigger and
more complex. Like the results in the ENm010_CHB+JPT dataset,
the four PDAGs obtained from the ENr131_CEU dataset and the
three PDAGs obtained from the ENr321_YRI dataset represent the
same set of pairwise associations and the same association blocks.
These blocks are illustrated as segmented lines with the name ‘All’
at the top of Figures 5 and 6, respectively. As can be noticed, the
association blocks represented in the PDAGs considering all edges
tend to be generous, grouping large quantity of nodes into few
blocks, including in such blocks markers with moderate to low D’
values. When the lower quartile of edges is removed, the association
blocks are splitted into more compact blocks (line segments Q1).
When the second lower quartile of edges is removed the association
blocks (line segments Q2) tend to be more segmented and similar
to that found by the Strong LD Spine block deﬁnition.

It is interesting to know the relationship between the learned
associations represented by the PDAGs and the classical measure
of LD D’. For this end, Figures 7a, b and c shows the distributions

of the associations with respect to 10 equally spaced intervals of
D’ for the three datasets, respectively. It is possible to observe a
clear trend in the three datasets to represent associations with high
D’ values (in the interval [0.9—1.0]). When edges are pruned at ﬁrst
quartile, the distributions of the represented associations are almost
unchanged. When the second quartile of edges are removed the
association distributions are moderately altered, predominantly in
the lower intervals of D’ . This means that weak edges are important
components of weak D’ associations, and vice versa.

The learned PDAGs showed another interesting information: the
markers most central in the blocks tend to have more outgoing edges
(e.g. markers 4 and 24 in all PDAGs of Fig. 3) and the markers on
the block boundaries tend to have predominantly incoming edges
(markers 1, 13, 19 and 27 in all PDAGs of Fig. 3). An explanation
for this behavior is that genetic markers near the center of the blocks
are highly conserved in the population (had minimal recombination),
which is reﬂected in the learned models by their tendency to be
more causative than dependent nodes. This suggests that the causal
information gained by BN models can be useful to tell about the
conservability of the genetic markers in the analyzed population. The
learned causal information can also be useful to guide the selection
of an informative subset of ‘tags’ markers, since nodes that have
predominantly outgoing edges can explain the allele status of their
dependent markers, being good candidates as ‘tag’ markers.

4 CONCLUSIONS

In this article a novel application of Bayesian networks to model
associations between genetic markers was proposed. The method is
based on learning optimal BN structures (weighted) from haplotype
data, extracting equivalence structure classes (PDAGs) and using
them to model LD. The results obtained in public data from the
HapMap database showed that our approach is a promising tool
for modeling LD. All the association blocks represented in the
learned PDAGs were consistent with LD blocks found by standard
tools. It was shown that by pruning weak edges is possible to
control the granularity of the association blocks and the clarity and
interpretability of the models. The associations represented by the
PDAGs were shown in correlation with the traditional measure of
LD D’ . It was suggested that the causality information learned by our
approach can be useful to infer about the conservability of the genetic
markers and to guide the selection of informative ‘tags’ markers. Our
current developments are in improving the efﬁciency of the method

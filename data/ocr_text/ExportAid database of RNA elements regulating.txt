ABSTRACT

Motivation: Regulation of nuclear mRNA export or retention is
carried out by RNA elements but the mechanism is not yet well
understood. To understand the mRNA export process, it is import-
ant to collect all the involved RNA elements and their trans-acting
factors.

Results: By hand-curated literature screening we collected, in
ExportAid database, experimentally assessed data about RNA
elements regulating nuclear export or retention of endogenous, heter-
ologous or artiﬁcial RNAs in mammalian cells. This database could
help to understand the RNA export language and to study the possible
export efficiency alterations owing to mutations or polymorphisms.
Currently, ExportAid stores 235 and 96 RNA elements, respectively,
increasing and decreasing export efficiency, and 98 neutral assessed
sequences.

Availability and implementation: Freely accessible without registra-
tion at http://www.introni.it/ExportAid/ExportAid.html. Database and
web interface are implemented in Perl, MySQL, Apache and
JavaScript with all major browsers supported.

1 INTRODUCTION

The major challenge of the post-genomic era is to understand the
meaning of the genomic sequences, i.e. to decipher the languages
used by different molecular processes such as transcription,
RNA and protein folding, RNA splicing, RNA export,
microRNA regulation and so on. Unfortunately, this research
is demanding because each language has a wide set of possible
words, they are not placed in ﬁxed positions in genes, the words
of different languages could overlap and many words have more
than one meaning because of the cellular context. For example,
genetic, RNA splicing, RNA folding and RNA export codes
can coexist in exons (Barbieri, 2003; Giulietti et al., 2013; Piva
et al., 2012).

A highly conserved process among eukaryotes but not yet well
understood is the RNA export. It occurs at the end of tran-
scripts’ maturation, ﬁnely regulating their nuclear export, reten-
tion or import (Carmody and Wente, 2009; Cullen, 2003;

Erkmann and Kutay, 2004). Small RNAs are bound directly
by the mobile export receptors that bring RNAs through the
nuclear pore complex, whereas mRNAs assemble into ribonu-
cleoprotein particles and recruit their exporter receptors, such as
TAP—p15 and CRMl, via adaptor proteins like ALY/REF and
SR proteins (Anko, 2014; Kohler and Hurt, 2007; Stewart, 2010).
Most of the adaptors are part of the exon junction complex
(EJC), which, binding non-speciﬁc sequences near exonic junc-
tions, mediates the mRNA export (Le Hir et al., 2001; Rodrigues
et al., 2001; Zhou et al., 2000). However, the EJC role is not
completely clear; in fact, one could wonder if transcripts with
many introns are exported in a more efﬁcient manner, as, owing
to splicing, they manage to recruit more EJ C proteins.
Alternatively, more EJC proteins would be needed to carry out
the export of long mRNAs.

As also transcripts that do not undergo splicing can be
exported, this suggests that further cis—acting RNA elements
provide for the mRNA export. Actually, by studying mamma-
lian intronless RNAs (Lei et al., 2011, 2013) and some viral
transcripts, mainly in retroviruses (Leblanc et al., 2013), new
RNA export elements have been discovered.

It emerges that a comprehensive knowledge of all the RNA
sequences involved in nuclear export, and of their trans-acting
factors, is crucial for a better understanding of the transcript’s
nuclear export process and functions. In particular, collecting
all this information, scattered throughout the literature, in a
unique resource would help to explain the export of transcripts,
such as intronless genes, some long non-coding RNAs
(lncRNAs) and viral genomes that do not undergo splicing,
or the retention of transcripts that undergo splicing.
Moreover, to shed light on this mechanism, it would be
useful to study the possible export efﬁciency alterations owing
to mutations or polymorphisms.

By hand-curated literature screening, we collected, in
ExportAid database, experimentally assessed data about
RNA elements regulating nuclear export or retention of en-
dogenous, heterologous or artiﬁcial RNAs in mammalian cells.
This specialized resource constitutes a repository, including in-
formation on functional sequences, their genomic location, ex-
perimental data and involved export pathways. ExportAid is
freely accessible at www.introni.it/ExportAid/ExportAid.html
and currently stores 235 and 96 RNA elements, respectively,
increasing and decreasing export efﬁciency, and 98 neutral as-
sessed sequences.

2 SYSTEM AND METHODS

For PubMed searches, we entered the words ‘RNA export’,
‘export RNA element’ or other similar terms or the name of
the known RNA export elements, including their synonyms.
We included all papers reporting mammalian, viral, mutated
or artiﬁcial RNA elements reported to be functional for the
RNA export in mammalian cell lines. For each paper, we
annotated the reported sequences and related information,
such as the name of the RNA functional elements lying in
the sequences, the organism to which the sequences belong
and the genomic coordinates along with the GenBank acces-
sion numbers. We also extracted the experimental conditions,
such as the cell lines used to test the sequence functionality,
and the structure of the genetic constructs used in transfec-
tions. In particular, we annotated whether the constructs were
produced by joining sequences from different parts of the
same genome or from different genomes, whether constructs
were built by putting together different functional elements
and whether the sequences belonged to known genes. As
constructs are usually cited in papers by name, to be easily
recognized, we also collected their name, or when missing, the
name of the used vector.

As in all papers the authors quantiﬁed the export efﬁciency
of each RNA element, by the percentage of relative cytoplas-
mic accumulation by assessing the RNA or the activity level
of a reporter gene, we thought it would have been useful to
annotate these functionality levels. Therefore, for each paper,
we scaled them from 1 to 10 and assigned a score ranging
from —10 to +10 for each sequence. This score describes the
functional effect of an RNA element in terms of tendency to
increase or decrease the nuclear export efﬁciency. We anno-
tated ‘(0) neutral effect’ to those sequences for which inser-
tion or deletion in a construct did not alter the export
efﬁciency. We assigned a positive or a negative score to the
functional elements that, respectively, increased or decreased
the RNA export efﬁciency. The user has to consider that an
RNA element with score +10 does not confer 100% export
efﬁciency of the construct, but only that it has the maximum
effect in increasing the export among the sequences assessed
in the same paper. The same goes for a score of —10.

Finally, to assure the database quality, we established guide-
lines for the literature review and annotation of records, and
performed an inter-annotator analysis (Colosimo et al., 2005)
carried out by post-doctoral researchers, PhD students and a
senior researcher.

3 DATABASE

3.1 Current status of the database

Overall, the database contains 235 and 96 RNA sequences, re-
spectively, increasing and decreasing export efﬁciency, and 98
neutral assessed sequences. As shown in Table 1, most of the
elements derive from viral genomes, in particular HIV and
SRV retrovirus, whereas humans have a bigger variety of func-
tional elements. It should be noted that we have also included
information about the post-transcriptional regulatory element of
woodchuck hepatitis virus (WPRE), although its involvement in

export is still debated (Donello et al., 1998; Higashimoto et al.,
2007; Zufferey et al., 1999).

Unfortunately for most functional elements, there are few
known sequences. Even the PRE has been found, to date, only
in CD83 human gene (Prechtel et al., 2006). Instead, a few export
elements have been found in various genes that, intriguingly, are
involved in similar functions. For example, the sequence element
eIF4E-SE (eIF4E sensitive element) is borne by some genes,
mainly those encoding cyclins, that constitute an RNA regulon
governing cellular proliferation (Culjkovic et al., 2006).
Analogously, the signal sequence coding region (SSCR) element
lies in mRNAs coding for secretory proteins (Palazzo et al.,
2007).

Most RNA export elements we collected have a length ranging
from a few ten to a few hundred nucleotides. The shortest
ExportAid sequences are mouse H2a element (22 nt) and
human eIF 4E sensitive element (40 nt). Among the characteristic
RNA export elements used by retroviruses to express their
unspliced mRNAs in the host cell, the constitutive transport
element (CTE) of the simian retrovirus and Mason—Pﬁzer

monkey virus and the RRE (Rev-responsive element) of the
human immunodeﬁciency virus type 1 are the most studied.
Moreover, we annotated whether some retroviruses encode the
trans-acting factors that interact with the virus’s export elements,
such as Rev protein of the human immunodeﬁciency virus or
ORF57 of the human herpesvirus-8.

3.2 Using ExportAid

ExportAid can be freely queried using Browse or Blast pages.
The ﬁrst page contains different criteria for performing searches
(by organism, RNA element, RNA-binding protein, export
pathway and functional effect), and at the bottom of the
page, it is possible to download the entire database in different
formats. Results are returned as concise records, each corres-
ponding to an RNA export sequence, and the user can expand
the record of interest, thus obtaining the card with the detailed
annotations (Fig. 1).

We have installed the local NCBI BLAST, which is accessible
via the Blast page, to allow the user to search his sequence versus

ExportAid

 

the entire database returning alignments linked to the respective
cards. The returned alignments have to be correctly interpreted
because not all alignments mean the presence of an RNA
functional element in the user sequence. It should be taken
into account that ExportAid collects the exact sequences assessed
in the reference papers, so some of them consist of hundreds or
thousands of nucleotides, but only a shorter part is thought to be
functional. To help the user to identify the functional elements
inside a sequence, we equipped each card with an image we made
that shows the structure and the genomic context each sequence
derives from. So the user can verify whether the returned align-
ment overlaps to a known functional element by using the images
enclosed with each card. The colour of the boxes representing
functional elements reﬂects their main activity: for example, the
INS element of HIV-1 is red because usually it prevents export,
and the RRE element of HIV-1 is green because generally it
promotes export. In some cases, an RNA export element can
exert opposite functions depending on the presence or absence
of its trans-acting factor, and the user can retrieve this informa-
tion from the ‘Note’ ﬁeld. For example, the RRE element of
HIV-1 has a context-dependent functionality, as it prevents
or enhances nuclear export respectively in absence or in presence
of its Rev protein.

Naturally, if the returned alignment does not extend to the
entire length of the functional element, it does not guarantee
the functionality of the user-submitted sequence, as the binding
site for its trans-acting factor could be lacking or its binding
could be prevented. In fact, RNA secondary structure is import-
ant for the function, and a shorter sequence would not fold
correctly. To make these evaluations easier, we added some
links in each card that allow the user to fold the database se-
quence by different RNA folding tools, such as RNAfold, mfold,
UNAFold, RNAshapes, Context Fold and RNAstructure.

Regarding annotations of the trans-acting elements, we took
into account also the following rare cases. When a sequence did
not contain any known functional element and was neutral for
export according to the literature, we indicated ‘None’ in the
ﬁelds ‘RNA functional element’ and ‘RNA binding protein’,
as we assumed that no RNA binding protein involved in ex-
port could bind this sequence. When an RNA element lying in
a sequence was unknown but the sequence was assessed as func-
tional, we indicated ‘Unknown’ in the aforementioned ﬁelds, as
we assumed that the sequence could bind some trans-acting
factor involved in export but was not yet identiﬁed.

Annotating genomic coordinates, we realized that some viral
sequences are associated to different genome assemblies, and
therefore, in these cards, we reported coordinates according to
different GenBank accession numbers. For example, the HIV-1
genome has been mainly referred to K03455 and AF033819
NCBI IDs but their coordinates are shifted of 455 nt, so we
reported both notations.

4 IMPLEMENTATION

For storage and query of the data, we constructed a MySQL
relational database maintained in our server. In the main table,
for each sequence, we annotated the species it belongs to, the
name of harboured functional elements, their synonyms, details
about the structure of the investigated sequence or the possible

overlapped genes, cell lines used to assess the functional effect,
genomic coordinates, a score describing the functional effect and
the related literature.

For each record, we created an image showing the genomic
context the sequence derives from. The second table stores the
trans-acting factors and the involved export pathways.

We also created a user-friendly web interface that allows users
to browse RNA sequences and align a sequence against
ExportAid collected sequences. The web interface uses Perl
DB1 and CGI, Javascript, and Ajax/XML languages to connect
with the database, facilitate data visualization and retrieval.
Moreover, the wide use of cross links to external databases
allows an easy switch to source database, such as NCBI
taxonomy (organism ﬁeld), NCBI EntrezGene (sequence struc-
ture ﬁeld), NCBI nucleotide (coordinates ﬁeld) and PubMed
(references ﬁeld).

5 DISCUSSION

To our knowledge, ExportAid is the only resource that collects
information about the RNA elements regulating nuclear export.
All of them have been experimentally assessed in mammalian
contexts and belong to both mammalian and viral genomes
while others are artiﬁcial. We also stored sequences that have
no effect on export. This comprehensive collection of experimen-
tal data can be of great interest, for example, to build binding
preference models of RNA export proteins to be used in predic-
tion algorithms. Using neutral sequences, as examples to train
machine learning algorithms, it is possible to obtain prediction
tools with a low rate of false-negative and -positive results. This
work highlights which functional elements have been poorly
investigated and should be further studied to build binding pref-
erence models.

This database could help to understand the rules of the RNA
export language and to build an algorithm to predict the fate of
gene transcripts, non-coding RNAs and viral RNAs, both normal
or mutated. In particular, prediction of molecular effects of poly-
morphisms constitutes the core of the prioritization process that is
carried out before association studies (Blasi et al., 2013; Galeazzi
et al., 2014; Piva et al., 2011). Moreover, ExportAid could be used
in virology to study the effect of emerging viral mutants, or to
design lentiviral gene therapy vectors with more efﬁcient RNA
export elements (Oh et al., 2007).

Our data could also help to explain the export or the retention
of transcripts, such as intronless genes, some lncRNAs and viral
genomes, that do not undergo splicing and so do not have the
canonical adapter proteins. Similarly, it may be useful to under-
stand why some transcripts, despite undergoing splicing, are
retained in the nucleus. For example, the steroid receptor RNA
activator (SRA) lncRNA is processed by splicing machinery, but
its mature sequence is retained in the nucleus. This retention is
not because of adenosine-to—inosine editing, as SRA stem struc-
tures are shorter than 25/30 bp, the minimum length required
to be edited and thus retained in the nucleus (DeCerbo and
Carmichael, 2005; Novikova et al., 2012, 2013). Analogously,
the retention of the Gomafu lncRNA has not been explained;
in fact, it was hypothesized that it was owing to binding with
SF 1 but subsequently this involvement was not conﬁrmed
(Sone et al., 2007; Tsuiji et al., 2011). Also the X—inactive-speciﬁc

transcript (XIST) lncRNA is retained in the nucleus after intron
removal but this seems due to inefﬁcient binding with the EJ C
protein Magoh and the export factor TAP/NXFl (Cohen and
Panning, 2007). However, the lncRNAs can have an active role
in regulating the RNA export. For example, the reduction
of NEATl impairs the editing-associated nuclear retention
pathway (Chen and Carmichael, 2009) and even its knockdown
increases the nucleus-to-cytoplasm export of Rev-dependent
HIV-1 transcripts (Zhang et al., 2013).

Our data can also be useful to understand the mRNA export
dysregulation in cancer. This is because of aberrant expression of
export factors like, for example, the eukaryotic translation initi-
ation factor eIF4E (Carroll and Borden, 2013) that increases the
export of speciﬁc transcripts involved in proliferation, survival
and oncogenesis (Culjkovic-Kraljacic and Borden, 2013). Besides
the critical role in cancer genesis and maintenance, RNA export
can be modulated in response to cellular signalling or stress, such
as growth factors, cytokines, chemokines and oncogenic tyrosine
kinases that are able to induce THOC5, a member of the TREX
export complex (Tran et al., 2014). In addition, it was recently
reported that, GANP protein, subunit of the TREX complex,
promotes the nuclear export of a subset of mRNAs involved in
RNA synthesis and processing, thus facilitating rapid changes in
expression of many genes Mickramasinghe et al., 2014).
Unfortunately, it is not yet known which export motifs, lying
in these mRNAs, bind GANP.

In this work, we realized that different splicing proteins (9G8,
SRp20, SF2/ASF, hnRNP A2/B1, hnRNP C, hnRNP L and
HuR) are also involved in RNA export suggesting a crosstalk
between these two processes. According to SpliceAid 2 (Piva
et al., 2012) resource, these splicing proteins recognize degenerate
RNA motifs that are spread in mRNA and not only at exonic
junctions, prompting export language to be overlapped both to
the splicing language and the genetic code.

Interestingly, whereas splicing language is fragile, as most mu-
tations affect the correct intron removal giving rise to aberrant
splicing patterns, the export language seems to be robust in genes
that undergo splicing. In fact, the export of only two mRNAs
(collagen COLlAl and dystrophia myotonica-protein kinase,
DMPK) is impaired by mutations (Hurt and Silver, 2008)
unlike intronless genes (Grzybowska, 2012).

Finally, we plan to continuously update the database, also
with the contribution of users who can signal new elements.

Abstract

Summary: Waggawagga is a web—based tool for the comparative visualization of coiled—coil predic—
tions and the detection of stable single oc—helices (SAH domains). Overview schemes show the
predicted coiled—coil regions found in the query sequence and provide sliders, which can be used
to select segments for detailed helical wheel and helical net views. A window—based score has
been developed to predict SAH domains. Export to several bitmap and vector graphics formats is

 

supported.

1 Introduction

Coiled coils are oc—helical structural domains common to all domains
of life and present in 2—12% of the proteins of a proteome (Liu and
Rost, 2001). The classical coiled coils comprise dimerising long
oc—helices that wind around each other forming superhelices (Crick,
1952) as found in structural proteins such as oc—keratins, muscle
myosins and tropomyosin (KMTs). In the last years, this view has
shifted to defining coiled—coil segments based on the presence of
knobs—into—holes packing of side chains between oc—helices resulting
in many different architectures and topologies (Moutevelis and
Woolfson, 2009). The basis for a coiled coil is an amino acid heptad
(‘abcdefg’), in which the ‘a’ and ‘d’ positions are occupied by hydro—
phobic residues.

Coiled coils were among the first structural domains to be pre—
dicted by algorithms (Lupas et 61]., 1991). In this method a query se—
quence is compared with a database of known coiled—coil sequences,
which were the KMTs available at that time. Subsequently, a simi—
larity score is computed and a probability to form a coiled—coil
calculated. In principle, this is an implementation of the basic ideas
already presented nine years before, that residues show an asymmet—
ric distribution within the heptad repeats and that this statistical

data can be used to predict coiled coils in other proteins (Parry,
1982). This position—specific scoring matriX (PSSM) approach has
been improved both on the database site and on the feature site try—
ing to disfavor the assignment of high coiled—coil probabilities to
hydrophilic sequences.

Another approach to predict coiled coils is based on the pairwise
residue probabilities as implemented in Paircoil (Berger et 61]., 1995)
and Paircoi12 (McDonnell et 61]., 2006). Here, pairwise frequencies
of heptad residues are calculated from known coiled—coil sequences
and the probability of a pair of amino acids in a given sequence for a
certain combination in the heptad is scored. With this approach bet—
ter predictions for long coiled—coil regions could be obtained com—
pared to PSSM predictions. Improvement of the prediction of short
coiled coils has been reached by using a hidden Markov model as in
Marcoil (Delorenzi and Speed, 2002), and, recently, Markov
Random Fields as used in Multic0i12 (Trigg et 61]., 2011). These gen—
eral coiled—coil prediction approaches have been extended by soft—
ware to predict different oligomerization states as Scorer
(Armstrong et al., 2011), PrOCoil (Mahrenholz et 61]., 2011), and
LOGICOIL (Vincent et 61]., 2013). However, all these approaches
provide different results and fail to distinguish between coiled coils
and stable single oc—helices (SAH domains). A special case of SAH

domains consisting of alternating repeats of four glutamic acid (E)
residues and four positively charged residues of either lysine (K) or
arginine (R) has been termed EIUK motif (Sivaramakrishnan et al.,
2008). SAH domains are in most cases mispredicted as coiled coils
but have been shown to form stable monomeric structures in aque—
ous solution (Knight et al., 2005; Suveges et al., 2009). SAHs
are highly enriched in E, Q, K and R residues, which stabilize the
0t—helices through intrahelical salt bridges (Peckham and Knight,
2009)

Waggawagga is designed to provide a direct schematic compari—
son of many coiled—coil prediction tools. Users can inspect the pre—
dictions in classical helical wheel (Schiffer and Edmundson, 1967)
and helical net (Dunnill, 1968) representations. Visualization of the
coiled—coil predictions in helical wheel schemes provides the possi—
bility to fast and easily identify potential hydrophobic seams in ‘a’
and ‘d’ and oppositely charged residues in ‘e’ and ‘g’ positions, re—
spectively. In contrast, SAH domains have patterns of highly
charged residues only occasionally interrupted by hydrophobic or
hydrophilic amino acids. Therefore, charged residues are highly en—
riched in the ‘a’ and ‘d’ positions. The hydrogen—bonded and
charged interaction network in SAH domains is best seen in helical
net representations showing the potential interactions along the
helix. Waggawagga provides layouts that can easily be used in pres—
entations and manuscripts.

2 Features

Waggawagga allows the comparative analysis of six coiled-coil pre-
diction (Marcoil, Multicoil, Multic0i12, Ncoils, Paircoil, Paircoi12)
and three oligomerization state prediction programs (Scorer,
PrOCoil and LOGICOIL). In addition, Multic0i12 distinguishes
dimers, trimers and non—coiled—coil oligomerization states. These
tools can be run in any combination against single or multiple query

sequences.

2.1 Domain View

The interactive domain view (Fig. 1A) is the main control element
for setting the two analysis views, the helical wheel (Fig. 1B) and the
helical net views (Fig. 1C). Separate schemes are generated for each
of the results of the selected coiled—coil prediction programs visualiz-
ing the coiled—coil regions on top of the query sequence. For each re—
gion, the predicted oligomerization state is given depending on the
selected tools. In the selected domain scheme, any specific region
can be chosen by mouse clicks or by moving an interactive slider.
The respective region is shown in detail in the helical wheel and the
helical net views.

2.2 Helical wheel View

The exact sequence borders of the coiled—coil region and several dif—
ferent types of helix arrangements (parallel dimer, anti-parallel
dimer, trimer) can be set in the configuration panel. In the helical
wheel view, every 0t—helix is shown along the helix axis and the heli-
ces are arranged that the hydrophobic core is in the interface of the
two or three helices. Each helical wheel represents 10 helix turns.

2.3 Helical net View

Intra-helical interactions are displayed in the helical net view, which
is the representation of a helix split open along a line parallel to its
axis and laid ﬂat. Solid and dashed lines mark strong and week
interactions, respectively. Strong and weak interactions are mainly
formed by oppositely charged residues from subsequent turns result—
ing in hydrogen-bonded networks in addition to charge interactions,
with the strength of the interaction given by the distance between
the residues and their relative orientation. Interaction networks lead
to extra stabilization in addition to that of the component pairs,
and hydrophobic seams favor helix association in contrast to single
helices. The so—called SAH—score is calculated as the sum of the

interactions divided by the window—size resulting in values from 0 to
1. SAHs typically have values greater than 0.25.

2.4 Line plots and tables
Here, the prediction scores are presented as line plots and tables

(Fig. 1D). These are particularly useful to evaluate the relevance of
SAH regions.

2.5 Performance and limitations

The SAH prediction scheme and score have been developed and
tested against previously reported regions from human proteins
(Peckham and Knight, 2009), SwissProt proteins (Suveges et al.,
2009), and thousands of cytoskeletal and motor proteins from all
across the eukaryotes as available from CyMoBase (http://www.
cymobase.org). There are other proteins that are mispredicted as
coiled coils although forming monomeric 0t—helical structures, such
as stathmin, which, however, are not enriched in E, Q, K, and R
residues and do not form stable structures in solution (Honnappa
et al., 2006). These types of proteins do not contain SAH domains
according to their definition (Peckham and Knight, 2009; Suveges
et al., 2009), and are consequently not detected and characterized as
monomeric oc-helical proteins in the current implementation of
Waggawagga.

3 Implementation

The web application framework is Ruby on Rails. In order to pre—
sent the user with a feature rich interface the site makes extensive
use of Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) using jQuery
(http://jquery.com) and FancyBox (http://fancybox.net). Interactive
schemes are drawn as SVG and graphs are generated with the graph—
ical toolkit GnuPlot (http://www.gnuplot.info). Figure export is
done through an intermediary SVG file, which is converted into
various output formats using the Inkscape graphics package (http://
inkscape.org). User—uploaded data is stored temporary on the server
and deleted when leaving the application.

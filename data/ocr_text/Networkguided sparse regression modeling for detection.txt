ABSTRACT

Motivation: Genetic variants identified by genome-wide association
studies to date explain only a small fraction of total heritability. Gene-
by-gene interaction is one important potential source of unexplained
total heritability. We propose a novel approach to detect such
interactions that uses penalized regression and sparse estimation
principles, and incorporates outside biological knowledge through a
network-based penalty.

Results: We tested our new method on simulated and real data.
Simulation showed that with reasonable outside biological knowledge,
our method performs noticeably better than stage-wise strategies (i.e.
selecting main effects first, and interactions second, from those main
effects selected) in finding true interactions, especially when the mar-
ginal strength of main effects is weak. We applied our method to
Framingham Heart Study data on total plasma immunoglobulin E
(lgE) concentrations and found a number of interactions among differ-
ent classes of human leukocyte antigen genes that may interact to
influence the risk of developing lgE dysregulation and allergy.
Availability: The proposed method is implemented in R and available

1 INTRODUCTION

Unlike Mendelian diseases, in which disease phenotypes are lar-
gely driven by mutation in a single gene locus, complex disease
and traits are associated with a number of factors, both genetic
and environmental, as well as lifestyle. In addition, while most
Mendelian diseases are rare, many complex diseases are fright-
fully common, from asthma to heart disease, hypertension to
Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s to various forms of cancer.
Arguably motivated by classical successes with Mendelian dis-
eases and traits, the study of complex diseases and traits in the
modern genomics era has focused largely on the identiﬁcation of

individually important genes. Genome-wide association studies
(GWAS), the current state of the art, have been central to the
discovery of many genes in various diseases (e.g. Hindorff et al.,
2010). However, unfortunately, the vast majority of genetic
variants associated with complex traits identiﬁed to date explain
only a small amount of the overall variance of the trait in the
underlying population (Manolio et al., 2009). As a result, most
GWAS ﬁndings thus far have had little clinical impact.

Currently, most GWAS are carried out one single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) at a time. Typically, for each SNP, a model
is speciﬁed, relating disease status or disease trait to the SNP plus
other potentially relevant covariates. The statistical signiﬁcance
of each SNP is quantiﬁed through the P—value of an appropriate
test. Finally, a multiple-testing correction is applied to correct the
collection of P—values across SNPs. The end result is a list of
SNPs declared to be signiﬁcantly associated with the status or
trait of interest, which in turn can be mapped to their closest
genes, although some associations have been found in ‘gene
deserts’ (Hindorff et al., 2010). The single-SNP approach has
the important attribute that it is (relatively) computationally
efﬁcient. However, it can be severely under-powered because of
the small effect size of most genetic variants identiﬁed to date
(Hindorff et al., 2010; Manolio et al., 2009). Additionally, this
approach does not adjust for correlation among SNPs, nor does
it extend in a natural manner to search for interactions between
markers. In contrast, multiple regression (i.e. where multiple
SNPs are modeled simultaneously) is a natural alternative.
However, naive implementation (i.e. incorporating all SNPs of
interest) is both infeasible and undesirable. This is due to various
reasons, including the sheer number of SNPs typically available
(e. g. hundreds of thousands to millions), the comparatively small
number of SNPs likely to be associated and “small n, large 19’
problems.

Recently, however, computationally efﬁcient multiple regres-
sion strategies for GWAS have begun to emerge that use various
methods of high-dimensional variable selection (e.g. Ayers and
Cordell, 2010; Logsdon et al., 2010; Ma et al., 2010; Szymczak
et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2009, 2010; Zhou et al. 2010). Compared
with traditional single-SNP methods, penalized regression
methods have been found to yield fewer correlated SNPs
(Ayers and Cordell, 2010) and to be capable of producing sub-
stantially more power while having a lower false-discovery

rate (FDR; He and Lin, 2011). Furthermore, and most relevant
to the current article, regression methods can include SNP by
SNP interactions in a natural manner. However, to date, this
typically has been done in a greedy stage-wise manner, by ﬁtting
main-effect models ﬁrst and then restricting attention to inter-
actions among those effects found signiﬁcant (VVu et al., 2009,
2010). In addition, the above work makes limited or no use of
supplementary biological information on, for example, biological
pathways and gene function.

We propose a novel network-guided statistical methodology to
facilitate the discovery of gene-by-gene (G x G) interactions
associated with complex quantitative traits related to human dis-
ease, one which addresses both of the shortcomings cited above.
Main effects and interaction effects in our model are chosen
simultaneously, thus allowing for the possibility of detecting
genes for which the marginal main effect is weak. Variable selec-
tion is done through penalized regression using sparse estimation
principles. The penalty allows for the incorporation of informa-
tion on biological pathways and gene function into the analysis
of continuous traits related to human disease. In doing so, this
penalty acts as an informal prior distribution on the set of pos-
sible G x G interactions, which in practice allows the investigator
to reduce the number of interactions examined for the model
from the nominal and computationally prohibitive 0((number
of SNPs)2) to a more manageable, say, 0(number of SNPs).

Simulations indicate that, given relevant pathway information,
our approach performs well in ﬁnding true interactions without
losing the ability of detecting main effects, and can noticeably
outperform existing stage-wise methods. In addition, application
of our proposed methodology to a study of plasma total
immunoglobulin E (IgE) concentrations for participants in the
Framingham Heart Study (FHS) illustrates the substantial prom-
ise of the method.

The rest of this article is organized as follows: in Section 2, we
describe our statistical approach. We introduce the model and
our proposed penalty, describe how biological information is
incorporated into the penalty and explain the optimization algo-
rithm used for model ﬁtting and a strategy for choosing tuning
parameters. The design and results of an extensive simulation
study are presented in Section 3, in which we examine models
with varying degrees of interactions and penalties reﬂecting
different extents of biological knowledge. Our analysis of the
IgE concentration data is provided in Section 4. Some additional
discussion may be found in Section 5.

2 METHODS
2.1 Modeling G x G interaction

Let Y be a quantitative trait of interest, and let {X}}j~’:1 be p predictors
representing SNPs. To include interactions, we are interested in a model
of the form

17
Y=30+ZﬁjAG+Zi3ijjk+€ (1)
j=l k> j

where X]- : A’J-Xk. We expect that both the 81s and the ,8ij are sparse,
as it is unlikely that there is more than a small fraction of SNPs affecting

the phenotype Y, either as main effects or as interactors.
In practice, 1) will range from hundreds to millions. Our goal is to ﬁt
the high-dimensional model (1) to data. When p is large but only a small

percentage of predictors and interactions are present in the true model, a
general approach is to minimize a penalized regression criterion.
Accordingly, we propose to estimate the coefﬁcients ,8 = ({8j},{8jk})T
in our model using a penalized least-squares criterion. Let
Y: (Y1,  Yn)T, X,- =(X1j,...,an)T and X,,, = (XUXlk, 
anXnk)T represent our variables Y, X]- and Xjk collected over 11 samples.
Our criterion is then written as follows:

- 1 1’
19 = argngnEIIY — Z 19ij — Zﬁjkxjkir + PM) (2)
j=l k>j

Penalized linear regression has been found to be a powerful tool for
ﬁtting high-dimensional models, particularly in situations where the nom-
inal number of variables is large relative to the number of observations
(e.g. Biihlmann and Van De Geer, 2011). In the context of GWAS,
typically p >> 11. Hence, it is impossible to ﬁt a model with the full set
of 0(p2) nominal interactions among all p SNPs. However, the coefﬁcient
vector ,8 is expected to be sparse. Therefore, a penalty function that
enforces sparseness can be helpful here, by encouraging the optimization
in (2) to ﬁnd solutions in which a large percentage of the main effects
and their interactions are zero, thus dropping the corresponding terms
from the model.

Following standard practice, we wish to include interactions only if
their corresponding main effects are also included in the model. The
construction of the sparseness penalty PW, therefore, must be handled
with some care, so as to enforce the resulting hierarchical constraint
among coefﬁcients. In addition, we would like our penalty to allow for
the use of biological knowledge (e. g. biological pathways, gene functional
classes, etc.) in ﬁtting the model. We address these two goals by deﬁning
a penalty of the form

1/2
1’
PM) = M Z (wijIXjﬁjllz + Z wfkiixjkﬁjkiiz)
j=l

1:79

where the wJ-k Z 0 are non-negative weights provided by the investigator,
and W = [wJ-k] is used to denote the matrix of weights over all SNP pairs
1', j. The values Al, A2 >0 are tuning parameters.

Our penalty is a generalization of that proposed by Radchenko and
James (2010) for the purpose of ﬁtting general types of interaction models
(in Radchenko and James (2010), wJ-k E 1 for all j, k). Note that, following
those authors, we express the penalty in un-normalized form (standard
lasso algorithms, for example, without interactions, assume ||Xj|| = l and
hence ||X1-,8j||2 = 8}). It can be shown that the penalty automatically en-
forces the hierarchical constraint (i.e. inclusion of main effects before
interactions). Main effects and interactions can be treated differently by
varying A2 with respect to M. The elements of the matrix W are generic
and allow for the possibility of including biological information a priori
into the model selection process. We next describe a manner for doing so,
in which network principles are used in a natural way.

2.2 A network-based penalty

Here we describe how we construct the matrix W, using information on
biological pathways. Similar constructions may be had generally using
other common resources (e.g., databases of genes and their biological
function, such as Gene Ontology). Note that W acts as a dissimilarity
matrix in PW. Under our construction, Wis deﬁned in association with a
graph showing relationships among SNPs, which in turn derives from a
bipartite graph relating SNPs to pathways. The intuition underlying our
construction is to (i) allow interactions only among SNPs corresponding
to genes that are common to at least one pathway, and (ii) to encourage
interactions more among those SNP pairs that are common to more
pathways.

Fig. 2. One-mode projection of the three examples in Figure 1

 

Let S1 , .. . , S1, denote ourp SNPs, and P1 , . . . , Pm, our m pathways.
We deﬁne G to be a bipartite graph, with one set of nodes representing
SNPs, and the other, pathways. An edge in G connects an SNP S, to a
pathway Pg if that SNP maps sufﬁciently close to a gene found in the
pathway. We then deﬁne GSNp to be the one-mode projection of G onto
the set of SNPs. Figures 1 and 2 show three toy examples of graphs G and
GSNp, for p = 3 SNPs and m = 2 pathways.

An equivalent representation of the relationship between SNPs and
pathways in the network GSNp is a p X m incidence matrix M, describing
which SNPs are linked to which pathways. For the three examples in
Figure 1, the corresponding incidence matrices are

1 0 1 0 1 0
0 l l l 0 1

Similarly, the analogous m X m (weighted) adjacency matrix is the stand-
ard representation of the one-mode projection GSNp. Calling this matrix
A, it is related to the incidence matrix M of the original graph G through
the expression A 2 MM T. For the three examples shown in Figure 1 and
Figure 2, the adjacency matrices are
1 1 0 1 1 l 0 0
A1: 121 A2: 22 A3: 011 (5)
0 1 1 2 2 0 1 1

Finally, we deﬁne the dissimilarity matrix W element-wise by setting
wJ-k = l/ajk. In the case where ajk = 0, we set wJ-k = 00 by convention.
Note that the resulting implication for the optimization in (2) is that 81-],
is set to zero, i.e. the term XJ-k cannot enter the model. Hence, only those
pairs of SNPs j, k that share at least one pathway (i.e. wJ-k < 00) may po-
tentially enter the model. As a result, it is possible to substantially reduce
the number of interaction terms considered for entry into the model, thus
making the simultaneous search for main effects and interactions easier to
perform. For example, in the application presented in Section 4, 17 025
SNPs were used, nominally corresponding to ~145 million interactions.
However, in using the 186 pathways from the Kyoto Encyclopeida of
Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database to construct our matrix W, this
number was reduced to less than 480 000 potential interactions.

We note that there are certainly other ways of constructing the matrix W.
For example, a variation on the procedure described above would be to
deﬁne wJ-k = 1 if ajk > 0, and inﬁnity otherwise. This is equivalent to equip-
ping the graph GSNp with a binary adjacency matrix and letting wJ-k = l /aJ-k
as before, and results in the equal treatment of all interactions that are
allowed to enter the model, regardless of how many pathways are shared
by pairs j, k. In addition, of course, other types of outside information—if
judged relevant—can be used in place of pathways, as mentioned above.

2.3 Model selection and ﬁtting

To perform the optimization in (2), we use cyclic coordinate descent, a
now-standard choice for problems such as ours (e.g. Friedman et al.,

2007; Wu and Lange, 2008; Wu et al., 2009). As the name indicates,
the cyclic coordinate descent algorithm updates one element of ,8 at a
time using coordinate descent principles, while holding all others ﬁxed,
and cycles through all elements until convergence. In our context, the
details of the resulting algorithm parallel those of Radchenko and James
(2010). We, therefore, present only a sketch of the algorithm and relevant
formulas here. Detailed derivation can be found in Supplementary
Material, Section 1.

Consider the estimation of 81-. We note that, with respect to this par-
ameter, the objective function in (2) can be written as
1 ~ T ~
E (Y; — X1131) (Y1 — X1131)

where 31,- = Y — 2,37,]. X383 — 21,321 2,», ng8gk. Here 85 is the current
value of 83 at this stage of our iterative algorithm, and similarly for
313k, While Q is all of the rest of the penalty term PW(,8) that does not
involve ,8,-.

The updates to the estimates ,8]- of the main effects ,8]- take the form of
a shrinkage estimate, ,8]- = 09,31", for Olj 6 [0,1]. Here ,8]- : X1731]- is the
solution to the problem of ﬁtting a regression-through—the—origin for Y]-

the Newton—Raphson method. In the special case where cj = 0, which

participate in any interactions), Equation (7) can be solved in closed
form, yielding oz.- = <1 — kiwi/rm} xix/211211).-

Now consider the estimation of 817,. Similar arguments show that the

is achieved. Following standard practice, on termination of our cyclic
coordinate descent algorithm, we generate a ﬁnal estimate of coefﬁcients
for those variables X]- and Xjk that were allowed to enter the model, using
ordinary least squares. All corresponding effect-size estimates and
P-values produced by our methodology result from this ﬁnal step.

For datasets with a small number of predictors {Xj}, the algorithm can
be easily ﬁt as described. However, for larger numbers of predictors, we
use a ‘swindle’, in analogy to that proposed by Wu et al. (2009) and
implemented in MENDEL (Lange et al., 2001). The basic idea is to
apply the algorithm to a much smaller number, say k, of pre—screened
predictors, and to choose the smoothing parameter(s) such that only a
desired number, say S< k, of predictors X]- enters the model. The Karush—
Kuhn—Tucker (KKT) conditions for our optimization problem are then
checked for the estimate ,8 resulting from our algorithm (augmented with
zeros for coefﬁcients of all predictors eliminated at the pre—screening
stage). If the KKT conditions are satisﬁed, we are done; if not, we
double k and repeat the process. Following Wu et al. (2009), we let
our initial choice of k be a multiple of s, i.e. k = 10 X S in the applications
we show. Pre—screening consists of sorting the t statistics of ﬁtting ordin-
ary least-square regression of Y on each predictor X]- separately (i.e. trad-
itional GWAS) and extracting those predictors with the k largest
t statistics. Details can be found in Supplementary Material, Section 2.

2.4 Choice of tuning parameters

In the penalty function PW deﬁned in (3), the tuning parameters 21,22
directly inﬂuence the number of variables that enter the ﬁnal model.
In principle, these two parameters may be allowed to vary freely and a
cross-validation strategy used to select the best values. However, this
strategy is unrealistic for GWAS, where the number of SNPs may
range into millions. Instead, we use a strategy that allows investigators
some control in dictating how many variables enter the model, and
thereby specify the tuning parameters implicitly.

First, we impose a linear relation between the two tuning parameters,
i.e. A2 2 ch. Because 22 is directly involved only in the selection of inter-
action terms, specifying the constant c may be interpreted as ‘tuning’ the
number of interactions relative to main effects. The tuning parameter 21
is responsible for the number of main effects in the model. Because 21 is
essentially a decreasing function of the number of main effects entered in
the model and often investigators have at least some rough expectation
of how many SNPs they feel are likely to be associated with their pheno-
type, we set 21 by pre—specifying the number of main effects to include in
the ﬁnal model (i.e. denoted S above).

Second, calculations show that the relation c R  holds, where
01.2 = 2pJ-(l — 17]) is the variance of SNP j coded as the number of minor
alleles under the assumption of Hardy—Weinberg equilibrium; the
variance is deﬁned here in terms of the minor allele frequency (MAF)
pj, and r is the ratio of the thresholds for main effects and interactions
to enter the model within the cyclic coordinate descent algorithm. See
Supplementary Material, Section 3, for details. We recommend that
c be chosen by the user through (i) specifying a desired ratio r and
(ii) knowledge of the distribution of SNP MAFs.

By setting the desired number of main effects and the value c, we
implicitly specify the values of the tuning parameters 21,22. A smaller
value of c (corresponding to a larger value of r) means more interactions
may enter the model, for a ﬁxed number of main effects.

 

3 SIMULATION
3.1 Simulation study design

We carried out a simulation study to assess (i) the performance
of our method under various interaction scenarios and (ii) the
effect of different choices of the W matrix in our penalty on our
ability to detect interaction. We also compared our method with

the stage-wise selection method proposed by Wu et al. (2009),
which restricts interaction search to SNPs ﬁrst declared to have
main effects. In each simulated dataset, there are 1000 subjects
and 1000 SNPs as predictors. The SNPs are coded additively
(0, l, 2), simulated with a MAF of 50%, and drawn from
a binomial distribution with two trials. Lower MAFs were also
investigated (MAF Z 10%, see Supplementary Material, Section
4.5). The quantitative trait Y is then simulated using the effect
SNPs and interactions speciﬁed under assumed models. The
effect sizes are set for 80% power under standard single-SNP
additive models. Among the 1000 SNPs, 20 (SNPs 1—20) have
true main effects on the simulated trait, and the remaining 980
SNPs have no effect.

To test our method in various interaction situations, we evalu-
ate three different models:

0 Model 1: only 20 main effects with no interaction,

0 Model 2: 20 main effects +all two way interactions among
SNPs 1—5, and

0 Model 3: 20 main effects—l— SNPl X SNP2—l— SNP3 X
SNP4—l— SNPS X SNP6—l— . . . —l— SNP19 X SNP20.

Model 1 has no interactions involved. Models 2 and 3 both
have 10 interaction terms involved, and the interactions are all
among true main effects. However, in Model 2, there is one
cluster with 5 interacting SNPs, while in Model 3 there are
10 clusters, each with two interacting SNPs.

In addition, we explore six different ways to construct the
W matrix used in the penalty. In each case, we allow all SNPs
to be evaluated as possible main effects, by having all ones down
the diagonal of W. For the possible interaction terms, coded by
the off-diagonal elements of W, we consider the following
additions:

0 W1: + true interactions in models,

0 W2: + two-way interactions among all true main effects
(SNPs 1—20),

0 W3: + true interactions + random ‘noise’ interactions,

W4: + two-way interactions among all true main effects -l—
random ‘noise’ interactions,

0 W5: + two-way interactions among SNPs 1—40 (all true
main effects and 20 non-active SNPs), and

0 W6: + two-way interactions among SNPs l—lO and 21—30 -l—
two-way interactions among SNPs ll—20 and 31410.

The matrix W1 is an ideal case. It only allows true interactions
built in the model to enter that model. Note that W1 is different
for each of Models 1, 2 and 3. The matrix W2 introduces some
‘noise’ interactions by allowing all interactions among true main
effects. It is equivalent to a single pathway of SNPs l—20 and is
the same for all models. The matrix W3 adds random ‘noise’
interactions to W1, while W4 adds random ‘noise’ interactions
to W2. Note that W3 and W4 both vary across models. The
random ‘noise’ interactions are introduced in a manner aimed
at mimicking the interaction structure corresponding to the
KEGG database, only some subset of which will likely be rele-
vant to any given study (and the rest, ‘noise’). Speciﬁcally,
an additional set of ‘pathways’ (i.e. gene sets) were deﬁned, in

Sparse regression for G X G interactions

 

addition to those deﬁned by the models themselves, until 20 path-
ways were formed. To these 20, we then randomly allocated 160
additional SNPs so that the average number of SNPs per path-
way roughly mimicked what is observed in KEGG. W5 repre-
sents a single pathway of SNPs 1—40, similar to W2 but with
more SNPs (20 non-active SNPs) involved. W6 then represents
two pathways with each having 10 active and 10 non-active
SNPs. It is similar to W5 in the sense that the allowed inter-
actions involve SNPs 1—40, but W6 has smaller amount of
non-active interactions.

We chose 21 by setting the desired number of main effects
selected as 25, the value of 21 is automatically determined by
our program once the value 25 is provided. This is a natural
choice because there are 1000 SNPs in our data and 20 true
main effects in the models. This choice will affect type I error
because at least 5 of the 25 predictors selected as main effects will
be false, but this number is modest compared with the total of
1000 SNPs and can be easily adjusted by resetting 21 according
to investigator preference. The parameter c is set to 0.5 (i.e.
r = 1.0 under our model). The selected predictors are then
ranked by their absolute t—values resulting from the ordinary
least-square ﬁt on the selected predictors for the ﬁnal model.
By setting a threshold on the rank, we choose the number of
interactions to be reported and compare the performance of
interaction selection under various W matrix speciﬁcations
across a range of thresholds.

3.2 Simulation results

In Figure 3, we compare the results under various W matrix
speciﬁcations, for Models 2 and 3. We assess the ability to ﬁnd
true interactions by computing the average FDR of interactions
over 100 trials and plotting l — FDR against the rank threshold
for selected interactions. As the threshold increases, more inter-
actions get selected, and thus FDR increases and the curves have
a downward trend. Examining the results, we see that W1 clearly
has the best performance, as it reﬂects the truth about the inter-

and thus the l — FDR curve for W1 is a straight line at 1. Recall

that W3 is equivalent to W1 plus random ‘noise’. Importantly,
therefore, we note that pure ‘noise’ among non-active SNPs does
not appear to impact much the selection of true interactions, as
W3 has the second best performance after W1. This conclusion is
reinforced by the results for W2 and W4, where the l— FDR
curves are nearly identical. In contrast, the results in Figure 3
also suggest that selection of interactions is to some extent ad-
versely affected when allowing ‘noise’ interactions among active
SNPs, as W6 has better performance than W2 and W5, while W2
and W5 have similar performance.

In comparing our method with that of Wu et al. (2009), as
implemented in Mendel, we can see in Figure 3 that our method
outperforms stage-wise selection for all choices considered for
the matrix W. This observation is signiﬁcant in showing that
using accurate prior information, even with moderate ‘noise’
(i.e. specifying non-existent interactions), it is possible to outper-
form the stage-wise approach by over 10—20% on the l — FDR
scale. Note that we used the default option in Mendel that tests
interactions among selected main effects. There are other options
in Mendel one can choose that may perform somewhat better.

With respect to the detection of main effects, the performance
of our methodology is shown in Table l. The average power of
main effects are grouped into three categories: the true SNPs
involved in interaction, true SNPs not involved in interaction
and the SNPs that have no effect on the simulated trait. Recall
that there is no interaction in Model 1, and all true SNPs in
Model 3 are involved in interaction, so they have only two rele-
vant groups of SNPs. As we can see from the Model 2 result,
SNPs involved in interactions are detected more easily than
SNPs not involved in interactions. Comparing Table l with
Table 2, we can also see that our method has the same or
higher average power for detecting true main effects than the
stage-wise approach of Wu et al. (2009), as implemented in
Mendel. In both approaches, the non-active SNPs have a small
chance of being declared as main effects.

We also tested two more cases where main-effect sizes were
moderate and weak, corresponding to 50% power and 20%
power, respectively, under standard single-SNP additive

interactions under these various strengths of main effects, we
reverse the direction of interactions so that there are no marginal
SNP effects. The W matrix we used is W2, as described before,
to make a fair comparison with respect to the inclusion
of noise interactions. The results under such models are shown
in Figure 4. As we can see from the ﬁgure, the approach imple-
mented using Mendel could not ﬁnd true interactions under

any of the models [the regular (Mendel), the moderate
(Mendel.moderate) and the weak (Mendel.weak) main-effect
models], as it only searches for interactions among main effects
selected in the ﬁrst stage. In contrast, our proposed approach is
able to ﬁnd some of the true interactions because it incorporates
information from the W matrix, the network of interactions
built from outside knowledge. Not surprisingly, the model
with stronger main effect (M2W2, M3W2) performs better in
ﬁnding true interactions than moderate (M2W2.moderate,
M3W2.moderate) or weak (M2W2.weak, M3W2.weak) main-
effect models.

There are a number of other important questions that one
can explore in simulations. We further checked four of them
and found that (i) our approach outperforms simple association
tests; (ii) scaling up data size by adding more ‘noise’ SNPs makes
it harder to ﬁnd true main effects but does not adversely affect
the selection of interactions’ (iii) besides the obvious advantage
of decreasing computing time, using network information in our
penalty yields advantages in detecting interactions beyond that
deriving from the hierarchical nature of the penalty; and (iv) our
approach is robust to modest linkage disequilibrium among
SNPs. A detailed description of these results can be found in
Supplementary Material, Section 4.

4 APPLICATION TO IGE CONCENTRATION

We applied our algorithm to evaluate G X G interactions for log
plasma IgE concentration, a biomarker that is often elevated in
individuals with allergy to environmental allergens. An elevated
plasma IgE concentration is associated with allergic diseases,
including asthma, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, atopic dermatitis
and food allergy. Although several genes inﬂuencing IgE concen-
trations have been identiﬁed to date, the interactions among
these genes or others yet to be identiﬁed to be important players
have not been studied (Granada et al., 2012).

We sought to investigate G X G effects on log IgE concentra-
tion in the FHS cohorts. Participants from the town of
Framingham, Massachusetts, have been recruited in these studies
starting in 1948, and have been followed over the years for the

Sparse regression for G X G interactions

 

development of heart disease and related traits, including pulmon-
ary function and allergic response measured by IgE concentra-
tion. Our analyses include 6975 participants, 441 from the original
cohort recruited in 1948, an additional 2848 from the Offspring
cohort recruited in 1971 and ﬁnally 3686 participants from the
Third Generation cohort initiated in 2002. A recent GWAS on
Framingham participants identiﬁed new genetic loci associated
with plasma total IgE concentrations (Granada et al., 2012).
We are interested in looking at G X G interactions associated
with IgE concentration, as an illustration of our methodology.

4.1 Preliminaries

Genotypes were from Affymetrix 500K and MIPS 50K arrays,
with imputation performed using HapMap 2 European reference
panel (Li et al., 2010). Dosage genotypes (expected number of
minor alleles) were used in our analysis, although the software
implementation of the Wu et al. (2009) approach (Mendel)
required genotypes to be coded as 0, l or 2 and could not
handle dosage. Therefore, in our analysis using Mendel, for
each individual, we used the genotype with the highest posterior
probability at each SNP. We analyze the natural logarithm of
plasma total IgE concentrations as our phenotype (i.e. Y),
adjusted for smoking status (current, former and amount of life
time smoking in terms of pack-years), age, sex and cohort of
origin. A total of 6975 participants (3209 men and 3766 women)
aged 19 years and older had good-quality genotypes and were
included in our analysis. Familial relationship was ignored when
applying our algorithm and the Wu et al. (2009) approach, but we
subsequently applied linear mixed-effect models to account for
familial correlation to obtain estimates of effect sizes.

Some pre—processing was used to select a set of SNPs to
include in our analysis. First, we attempted to map each of the
2411 590 genotyped and imputed SNPs in the dataset to a refer-
ence gene containing it. If no such gene was available, then we

Table 3. Results of application to IgE concentration data

mapped the SNP to the closest reference gene within 60 kb of the
SNP, if available. Otherwise, the SNP was excluded. After estab-
lishing this mapping between genes and SNPs, some genes were
found to include multiple SNPs. We kept only one SNP for
each gene, selecting in each case that SNP most signiﬁcantly
associated with the phenotype, based on a linear mixed-effect
regression. As a result, the SNPs in the ﬁnal dataset have low
linkage disequilibrium (correlation) and a unique SNP-to-gene
correspondence (additional analyses suggest that our results, re-
ported below, are fairly robust to modest amounts of disequilib-
rium in these data. See Supplementary Materials, Section 4.4).

The ﬁnal dataset has 17 025 SNPs/genes. We used the KEGG
pathway database to build our W matrix, following the steps
described in Section 2. The KEGG pathway database has a
total of 72 354 genes and 5268 unique genes, resulting in
479 066 interactions allowed in our W matrix.

4.2 Results

For our analysis on 17025 SNPs, we chose to look for 10 main
effects, although we allowed the algorithm to terminate after
selecting 10:l: 1 main effects, resulting in 9 main effects selected
in the current analysis. The parameter c was set to 0.1, which,
based on an average estimated SNP variance of 0.27 for these
data, corresponds to r w 2.7. Nine interactions were found in our
approach, yielding a model with 15 = 9 + 6 variables. To cali-
brate our results with those from the stage-wise procedure of Wu
et al. (2009), as implemented in Mendel, the latter was run to
select 9 variables in the ﬁrst stage (i.e. ﬁtting only main effects),
and then 15 variables in the second stage (i.e. ﬁtting both main
effects and interactions, selected from among the 9 SNPs result-
ing from the ﬁrst stage). This process produced a ﬁnal model
with nine main effects and six interactions. In terms of comput-
ing time, our analysis ran in ~5 min on our cluster Linga,
equipped with two Intel Xeon CPUs E5345 @ 2.33 GHz, with

four cores each, and 16 GB/32 GB of RAM for each node (the
job was submitted to one node and used one core), while the
analysis in Mendel ran in ~2 min. Given that our method evalu-
ates 479 066/55 % 8710 times more potential interactions than
Mendel, the observed trade-off between computing time and
number of possible interactions being evaluated appears to be
reasonable.

The results from our proposed method and from the stage-
wise procedure are shown in the left and right, respectively, of
Table 3. The estimates of effect size and the ranks are from the
linear mixed-effect model for the ﬁnal model after variable selec-
tion procedure, for both methods. Genes previously found in a
GWAS of these FHS data (Granada et al., 2012) are indicated
with an asterisk in the table. In our approach, four of the six
interaction pairs involved human leukocyte antigen (HLA)
genes, which encode antigen-presenting cell-surface proteins
that are key regulators of the immune response. The other two
interactions identiﬁed were among genes both previously asso-
ciated with log IgE concentrations (Granada et al., 2012). In
contrast, Mendel did not detect any interactions among genes
in the HLA regions or among pairs of previously associated
genes.

From a biological perspective, a number of the interactions
discovered by our method are of non-trivial potential interest.
The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigens
HLA-A, -B and -C are involved with cell-mediated immunity
targeting cells expressing proteins produced intracellularly, for
example, by viruses, while the MHC class II antigens HLA-
DP, -DQ and -DR play key roles with humoral immunity,
including the production of IgE antibodies directed against en-
vironmental allergens (Klein and Sato, 2000). HLA-G is a non-
classical MHC class I antigen that may have immunomodulatory
effects through actions on natural killer cells, T lymphocytes and
antigen-presenting cells (Carosella et al., 2008). Genetic variants
in these different classes of HLA genes—each class inﬂuencing a
different but interconnected aspect of immune function—could
well interact to inﬂuence the risk of developing IgE dysregulation
and allergy. The observed interaction between SNPs in the alpha
chain of the high afﬁnity receptor for IgE (FCERlA) and inter-
leukin (IL)—l3 genes may reﬂect a number of mechanisms. For
example, a genetic variant causing increased expression of
FccRIa on mast cells would lead to increased antigen-induced
activation of these cells, which would consequently produce
more IL-l3 (Burd et al., 1995), leading to more class-switch re-
combination and IgE production. Genetic variation of FccRIa
on classical antigen-presenting cells may also promote Th2 cell
activation (Potaczek et al., 2009) with consequent IL-l3 release.
Thus, SNPs in these two genes in the same pathway leading to
increased IgE production could have synergistic effects. Overall,
identiﬁcation of these interactions may help identify the children
at highest risk for developing allergy, possibly helping focus
interventions to prevent allergy, and may provide new insights
into the genetic basis and mechanisms of allergy.

5 DISCUSSION

There are many potential sources of missing hereditability.
G X G interactions is one such source. In turn, there are many
types of genetic interactions, including multiplicative and

non-multiplicative (Mukherjee et al. 2008, 2012). In this article,
we focus on investigating multiplicative interactions in the form
of a product between two variables. Our proposed methodology
provides a promising new approach to tapping this source, by
exploiting the wealth of biological knowledge accumulated in
various pathway databases.

The simulations reported here suggest that our approach per-
forms better in ﬁnding true interactions with a reasonable prior
biological knowledge incorporated, compared with the stage-
wise regression method that ﬁrst ﬁts a main-effect model and
then searches for interactions among selected main effects.
Furthermore, the real-data results are promising in suggesting
that better performance likely may be realized in real data
as well.

Future work to be done on this topic includes extending the
computational algorithm to account for linkage disequilibrium
among SNPs, and producing a software implementation that
uses standard formatted ﬁles such as genotype ﬁles from the
PLINK (Purcell et al. 2007) software package.

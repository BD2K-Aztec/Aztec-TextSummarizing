Abstract

Motivation: Cancer genomes exhibit a large number of different alterations that affect many genes in a
diverse manner. An improved understanding of the generative mechanisms behind the mutation rules and
their influence on gene community behavior is of great importance for the study of cancer.

Results: To expand our capability to analyze combinatorial patterns of cancer alterations, we developed
a rigorous methodology for cancer mutation pattern discovery based on a new, constrained form of
correlation clustering. Our new algorithm, named C3 (Cancer Correlation Clustering), leverages mutual
exclusivity of mutations, patient coverage, and driver network concentration principles. To test C3, we
performed a detailed analysis on TCGA breast cancer and glioblastoma data and showed that our algorithm
outperforms the state-of-the-art CoMEt method in terms of discovering mutually exclusive gene modules
and identifying biologically relevant driver genes. The proposed agnostic clustering method represents a
unique tool for efficient and reliable identification of mutation patterns and driver pathways in large-scale
cancer genomics studies, and it may also be used for other clustering problems on biological graphs.

Rapid advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies have provided unique
opportunities for analyzing large numbers of cancer genomes. However, the

complexity of genomic alterations in cancer causes signiﬁcant analytical and

a large number of diverse mutations (e. g., point mutations or copy number changes)
most of which are neutral, one problem of signiﬁcant importance is to identify a small
set of mutations that perturb key biological pathways and have signiﬁcant impact
on tumori genesis (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011). Hence, a central question in cancer
genomics is how to distinguish “driver” mutations, which contribute to tumori genesis,
from functionally neutral “passenger” mutations.

on simple estimates of recurrence or frequency of mutations usually do not workN
well in practice. To mitigate this problem, several recent approaches have integrateda
frequency analysis with pathway-based and network-based models in order to ensure
high accuracy of common driver mutation discovery (Pe’er and Hacohen, 2011; Ng
et al., 2012; Bashashati et al., 2012; Paull et al., 2013; Hou and Ma, 2014). Such
methods have an advantage in so far that in addition to mutation analysis, they take
into account gene interactions as an added source of prior knowledge.

In parallel, methods have been proposed to identify driver pathways, i.e., groups of
genes that may interact together in combinatorial patterns to promote tumorigenesis.
Ciriello et al. (2012) described a method called MEMO, and subsequently used

it to show that mutually exclusive modules based on known networks can aid in
determining groups of genes that contribute to tumorigenesis. These gene groups,
or modules, are jointly highly recurrent, have similar pathway impact in terms of
biological processes, and their corresponding mutations tend to be mutually exclusive,
meaning that very often only one gene in each gene group is mutated at a given time in
any given patient. This mutual exclusivity rule in cancer pathways is supported by the
observations that, in general, one mutated gene sufﬁces to perturb the function of its
corresponding pathway. Multiple mutations would require signiﬁcantly higher energy
investments on the part of cancer cells, and are hence selected against. Zhang et al.
(2013) expanded the ideas behind the concept of MEMO with iMCMC, and provided a
framework to integrate mutation data, copy number, and expression information into
cancer network weights which they used to identify modules; they also performed
multiple types of integrative cancer perturbation data analysis. Dendrix (Vandin et al. ,
2012) was developed to identify driver pathways de novo using mutual exclusivity
and coverage (patient coverage) principles, without relying on known network
information that has the potential to improve the discovery process of new modules.
MDPFinder from (Zhao et al., 2012) expanded on the overall framework of Dendrix
by incorporating gene expression information to ensure that genes in discovered
mutually exclusive pathways were also co-expressed. Multi-Dendrix (Leiserson et al. ,
2013) and CoMDP (Zhang et al., 2014) improved on the limitations of Dendrix and
MDPFinder, respectively, by allowing their algorithms to ﬁnd multiple co-occuring
modules. More recently, CoMEt (Leiserson et al. , 2015a) was proposed to address an
inherent bias in Dendrix and Multi-Dendrix that resulted in high frequency mutations
being signiﬁcantly more likely to be included in mutually exclusive modules.

However, while methods such as Dendrix, Multi-Dendrix and CoMEt all have
the ability to identify mutually exclusive modules de novo, they still have signiﬁcant
limitations. The aforementioned methods are typically inefﬁcient when applied to
large-scale datasets with large values of their relevant parameters. Also, some of
these methods are randomized in nature and no guarantees exist that multiple runs
of the methods will produce compatible results. Furthermore, almost all methods
are able to identify only a small number of modules of limited size, as cluster sizes
are critical algorithmic parameters from the perspective of computational tractability.
Most importantly, they have to be redesigned or restructured whenever new biological
information is included in the discovery process.

To overcome these and other shortcomings of existing methods, we introduce
a novel method called Cancer Correlation Clustering (C3) to directly tackle the
problems of integrating diverse sources of evidence regarding driver pattern behavior
and eliminating computational bottlenecks associated with large cluster sizes or cluster
numbers. The C3 method uses a new agnostic optimization framework speciﬁcally
developed and rigorously analyzed for the driver discovery task, in which patient
data is converted into a simple set of weights used in the objective function that
do not require the algorithm to change upon incorporation of new data sources. In
addition to this ﬂexibility, C3 has low computational cost, and it allows for adding
relevant problem constraints while retaining good theoretical performance guarantees.
Furthermore, the algorithm outperforms CoMEt in three out of four evaluation criteria,
where the three criteria depend on which weights are “emphasized” in the optimization
problem: tuning the weights allows one to select which features to improve or
emphasize. What the relevant constraints features are may be chosen by the user,
although our analysis included coverage, mutual exclusivity, expression data and
network pathway information. We also point out that the weights may be chosen so
as to cater to the need of many other computational biology problems that involve
optimization on graphs.

To test C3 , we ran extensive simulations for sevem cancer types (including breast
cancer, kidney cancer, ovarian cancer, glioblastoma, etc). Unfortunately, the patient
sample set sizes for all except two cancers — breast cancer and glioblastoma — did not
allow for accurate and statistically signiﬁcant driver identiﬁcations for any of the used
methods. We hence report results for these two cancers only, although a pan-cancer
study is easy to conduct once sufﬁciently many samples become available.

The paper is organized as follows. A basic introduction of the principles of
correlation clustering is provided in section Approach. Section Methods contains
a description of how to transform patient data into clustering weights used for the
computations, the algorithmic clustering approach based on the computed weights,
and the evaluation criteria used to compare C3 and CoMEt. Section Results contains
the main results of our analysis, a comparison of the performance of C3 and CoMEt
on breast cancer and glioblastoma data. A discussion of our ﬁndings and concluding
remarks are given in Discussions. A rigorous mathematical performance analysis of
C3 may be found in the Supplementary Materials, along with more extensive software
evaluations and explanations of relevant concepts.

2 Approach

The basic idea behind the C3 approach is correlation clustering, an agnostic learning
technique ﬁrst proposed in Bansal et al. (2004). In the most basic form of the clustering
model, one is given a set of objects and, for all or some pairs of objects, one is also
given an assessment as to whether the objects are “similar” or “dissimilar”. This
information is described using a complete graph with labeled edges: each object is
represented by a vertex of the graph, and the assessments are represented by edges
labeled with either a “+” symbol, for similar objects, or a

‘3 ”

symbol, for dissimilar
objects. The goal is to partition the objects into clusters so that the edges within clusters
are mostly positive and the edges between clusters are mostly negative. Unlike in many
other clustering models, such as k-means (Hartigan and Wong, 1979), the number of
clusters is not ﬁxed ahead of time and ﬁnding the optimal number of clusters is part
of the problem. Furthermore, the assignment of positive and negative edges does not
have to be mutually consistent: for example, if the graph contains a triangle with
two positive edges and one negative edge, then we must either group the endpoin s
of the negative edge together, erroneously putting a negative edge inside a ClUStCD
resulting in a “negative error” or else we must group them separately, forcing one
the positive edges to erroneously go between clusters, resulting in a “positive error’g
An illustrative example is shown in Supplemental Fig. 1. When a perfect clustering"
is not possible, we seek an optimal clustering: one that minimizes the total number of;
“errors”. This form of correlation clustering is known to be NP—hard, but depending 03
the graph topology, various constant or logarithmic approximation guarantees existb‘
Bansal et al. (2004) also proposed a weighted version of the correlation-clustering
problem. A more general weighted formulation was introduced in Charikar et a '
(2003, 2005), and this is the formulation we subsequently generalize. In this mode?
each edge e is assigned two nonnegative weights, to: and we— . A clustering incué;

If no restrictions are placed on the weights to: and we— , then it is possible to havg'
edges with w:— = we— : 0; these edges are effectively absent from the graph, so therg
is no loss of generality in assuming that the graph is a complete graph. Nevertheless, igs

The analytic approach pursued in this work operates on the following model:
genes which show sufﬁciently large mutation prevalence in cancer patients represent“
vertices of a complete (fully connected) graph whose vertices are to be clustereg1
according to similarity criteria and weights to be described in detail in the neg-
section. Note that we only use the top 5% of mutated genes in cancer patient@_
ordered by mutation frequency, as vertices. The reasoning behind our approach is?
as follows: First, low-frequency mutations require specialized statistical and netwo
analysis methods which have to be developed in parallel and for which not sufﬁcientlg,3
many patient samples are yet available (Torkamani and Schork, 2009; Vogelstei

Uﬂl

et al., 2013); Second, even when restricting our attention to the most frequentl'
mutated genes we outperform all known methods, which illustrates that one cal

these numbers may appear prohibitively small given that more than a hundred canceg,
driver genes are reported, usually only a very small number of driver genes are needeg
to initiate the process of tumorigenesis (For example, in Tomasetti et al. (2015), g
was shown that only three driver gene mutations are required for the development 0?:
lung and colorectal cancers.) 0g

coverage strength, network distance and expression similarity. More precisely, the;
negative weights we— are chosen to be relatively small if the endpoint genes describin
the edge are deemed to be mutually exclusive in cancer patients. A small negative
weight encourages placing mutually exclusive genes within the same cluster, as the
penalty paid for placement in the same cluster is small. The positive weights jointly
depend on the coverage, network distance and expression correlation of the endpoint
genes: The larger the joint coverage, co-expres sion and inverse of the network distance
of the endpoint genes, the larger the positive weight and the more likely the genes
will end up in the same cluster so as to avoid paying a large cross-cluster cost. Precise
mathematical formulations of the weight functions will be provided in the next section.

To control the size of the resulting clusters so as to discourage uninformative
singleton and giant clusters, we developed two new correlation clustering algorithms
that use cluster sizes as problem parameters that may be chosen by the users. These
cluster size bounds also allow for more accurate comparison with other methods which
operate with inherent cluster size constraints. Furthermore, as pointed out in Vandin
et al. (2012), driver pathways obeying mutual exclusivity and coverage constraints
are usually smaller than most pathways annotated in the literature. This observation
provides another reason for using bounded cluster sizes as well. Note that unlike in the
aforementioned known methods, the cluster sizes have no bearing on the complexity of
our algorithm nor on their overall approximation quality, and they may be completely
removed by the user if so desired.

The driver discovery approaches closest to C3 are Multi-Dendrix (Leiserson
et al., 2013) and CoMEt (Leiserson et al., 2015a). Multi-Dendrix is an integer linear
programming clustering algorithm that ensures that the genes within a cluster have
mutation patterns that satisfy mutual exclusivity and coverage: In a nutshell, for any
two genes in a cluster, the number of patients in which these genes are mutated at
the same time is relatively small; in addition, a large portion of the patients has
at least one mutation in each cluster. CoMEt uses a statistical score for mutation
exclusivity that is conditioned on the frequency of each alteration, alleviating the
inherent bias caused by frequently mutated genes. Compared to Multi-Dendrix and
CoMEt, C3 uses a weighted linear programming relaxation instead of an integer
linear program which signiﬁcantly improves the versatility and running time of
the algorithm. Furthermore, the weights allow for straightforward incorporation of
heterogeneous sources of evidence into the clustering method and the algorithm itself
remains unchanged with the addition of new data. On the other hand, Multi-Dendrix
cannot be easily adapted to new problem constraints. This ﬂexibility comes at the
cost of C3 providing only an approximate solution, but the approximate solutions
exhibit large overlap with the exact solutions for a number of tested smaller synthetic
networks. In addition, given the inherently approximate nature of optimization criteria,
the weight selection and parametrization of both algorithms, this does not appear to
be a signiﬁcant shortcoming. Also, empirical evaluations on real data suggest that the
approximation algorithms produce results very close to the optimal solution.

3 Methods

Before rigorously describing our algorithmic methods, we introduce some relevant
notation and explain how to estimate appropriate clustering weights based on available
data. The weights are deﬁned separately for each combination of datasets in order to
better explain the trade-offs between different choices of weights and to allow the
user to restrict her/his attention to the combination for which the best and largest
collection of data points and samples is available. In the Results section, we describe
the performance of C3 for all combinations of datasets and corresponding weight
choices.

3.1 Clustering Weights

Let G(V, E) be a complete graph, where V(G) denotes the set of vertices and E (G)
denotes the set of edges of the graph G, respectively. As the graph is complete, an
edge exists between any pair of vertices and the only relevant edge property is its
pair of weights. Note that we follow this formalism as it is an established approach
in correlation clustering. The symbol 6 E E(G) or e = uv with u, 'v E V(G)
is used to denote a generic edge. Each edge is assigned a positive weight w:— and
a negative weight we— . Recall the interpretation of these weights: For two distinct
vertices u, 'v E V(G), ma}, is the cost of placing u and 'v in different clusters;
consequently, by making the positive weight of an edge large, one can discourage
placing the corresponding two genes into different clusters. Similarly, 11);” is the cost
of placing u and 'v in the same cluster, and hence making this weight large discourages
placing the corresponding two genes into the same cluster. In the rest of this section,
we will explore different ways of deﬁning the weights 11);” and mi”; in order to
avoid confusion between the different deﬁnitions, each weight we deﬁne will include
a parenthetical abbreviation, so that, for example, w+ (c) m, will refer to the positive
weight of uv deﬁned according to the coverage criteria, while w+ (c,n) m, will refer
to the positive weight of uv according to the coverage and network criteria. The
weights are computed using four types of datasets: gene mutation data, copy number
variation (CNV), network information (NI), and gene expression (GE) data. As each
data type carries information of different importance to the driver discovery process
(for example, CNVs are directly connected to driver gene properties, while GE data
may only carry indirect information; CNV may also causally inﬂuence GE), when
fusing different sources of information we allow for linear combinations of the weights

11);” and ma}, corresponding to individual data sources based on their importance or
accuracy (for example, there are still a number of unresolved issues in computing
the exact CNV of a gene, while a large number of GE datasets are very noisy). To
illustrate these points, if one source were to suggest positive and negative weights
11),},(1) and qua—1A1), while another source were to suggest 11);” (2) and ma}, (2),
where the second source is deemed twice more important or accurate, the resulting
weights would be obtained through a linear parameter fusion equation

“will = (1/3)w1;u(1)+ (2/3)’va(2),

will = (1/3)w1—l—v(1) + (2/3)w1—l—v(2)'

In our weight assignment process, we also make frequent use of the notions of
coverage and mutual exclusivity which we roughly described in previous sections.
Coverage refers to the number of patients in which the same mutation is observed.
High coverage postulates that important driver pathway should be mutated in as man
patients as possible. Mutual exclusivity refers to the property that mutated driver genes)
in a patient tend to belong to different pathways, and that the number of patients with-i“
more than one mutated driver gene per given pathway is small. 8

CNV data: we set C(i, j ) = 0 if there is no change in the copy number of gene 2' i1§
sample j ; otherwise, we choose an integer value reﬂecting the deviation of the CNV;
number from its baseline. Hence, the CNV matrix contains both positive and negativﬁ'
values corresponding to the copy number changes of the corresponding gene in eaclé;

bounds on copy numbers that may be chosen by the user. These bounds determine
what is deemed to be a signiﬁcant CNV change. In our tests, we set lam, = —1 and

more conservative CNV thresholds tend to decrease coverage, while more relaxed
CNV assumptions tend to decrease mutual exclusivity. Based on the procedure abovea
we arrive at one “combined mutation” matrix M which we use instead of the matrices:
A and C, as it captures both mutations and CNVs. A positive entry in row i an '

Observe that some datasets are clearly correlated with each other while other
may have very little correlation (e. g., CNV and gene expression are clearly correlated),%
nevertheless, different datasets provide different expert opinions that contain potentiagF

where a is a scaling parameter to be chosen by the user, and the label e in the weight
refers to “exclusivity”. The intuition behind the choice of the weight is as follows:
the smaller the number of patients in which both or and U are mutated, the smaller the
weight and the more likely that u and r: are mutually exclusive. The reason behind
the use of the factor a. is that we can strengthen or weaken the importance of mutual
exclusivity through a: If a is large (e.g., empirically, a value of a. > 3 is deemed
large), mutual exclusivity is enforced strictly, while if a. is small, (e.g. a. < 3), the
genes in each cluster will not be highly mutually exclusive. Also, note that

M <1

To capture the coverage property through the positive weights, observe that if two
genes increase the coverage signiﬁcantly, their positive weight should be large so that
they are encouraged to be placed in the same cluster. To determine the positive weights,
we ﬁrst form the set D : {D(u, 1:0}, for all u, r; E V(G), where D(u, v) :
|8(ri) A 8(v)| and A denotes the symmetric difference of two sets. A large value for
the symmetric difference D (u, 1;) suggests that the vertices u and r; should be placed
in the same cluster, since they increase the coverage of the cluster.

Given the set D, we deﬁne T(J) to be the Jth percentile of the values in D. In all
our runs, we used the default value of J = 95, although this choice may be governed
by the user as well. The positive weights are chosen according to:

Clustering Weights Determined Based on Mutual Exclusivity, Coverage, and
Network Information (N I-ME-CO)
The comprehensive results of pan-cancer studies reported in a number of recent
papers (Leiserson etal., 2013; Porta-Pardo etal., 2015; Leiserson et al., 2015b; Garcia-
Alonso etal., 2014) have revealedthe important connection between network topology
and cancer driver distribution patterns. More precisely, the effect of deleterious
mutations on the phenotype may be suppressed through a particular conﬁguration of
the corresponding protein complexes, and at the same time, the strength of the effect
of amutation may be emphasized through another conﬁguration. As an example, most
of the variants observed in healthy individuals seem to appear at the periphery of the
interactome, and they do not seem to inﬂuence network connectivity. In contrast,
cancer driver somatic mutations tend to occur in central, internal regions of the
interactome and within highly co-integrated components. It appears that no previous
attempts were made to more precisely quantify the network distances between driver
variants, which prompted us to perform the following analysis. We ﬁrst computed the
pairwise (shortest) network distances between genes in a large pathway comprising
8,726 genes from (Ciriello er al., 2012) via an implementation of the standard
Dijkstra algorithm (Skiena, 1990). In this test, we randomly selected 1,000 pairs in
order to reduce the computational burden of running Dijkstra’s algorithm 0(87262)
times. By using the most complete known driver list from the Cancer Gene Census
(CGC) (Futreal et al., 2004), we computed the same distances for driver genes, this
time for all pairs of genes. The resulting distribution of shortest paths is depicted in
Fig. 1. One can clearly observe that the average shortest distance between drivers is
signiﬁcantly smaller than the average shortest distance between two randomly selected
genes. A permutation test conﬁrms this observation, and we calculated a p-value of
less than 0.001.

These ﬁndings suggest that when determining potential driver mutations, one
should make use of network distance and connectivity information. This may

criterion over the other offers improved algorithm performance on some datasets.

Clustering Weights Determined Based on Mutual Exclusivity, Coverage, and
Gene Expression Data (EX-ME-CO)

Similar to network information, expression data may be incorporated through the
positive weights, using the assumption that co-expressed genes may be involved in
the same function or cancer pathway. Hence, highly (positively or negatively) co-
expressed genes should be encouraged to cluster together.

To explain how to incorporate gene expression data into the clustering procedure,
assume that 2(a) and 2(1)) denote the vectors of time-evolving expression values
corresponding to genes u and '1), respectively. The ﬁrst step in assigning the positive
weights is to determine the set 9 = {g(u, '12)}, where for every pair of genes u, v,

|(Z(u), z(v))|

W' (10)

9(u7v) =

Here, (a, b) denotes the classical inner product of the vectors a and b, while ||a||
stands for the £2 norm. A large value for g(u, '0) indicates that the expression vectors
of u and 'v are highly correlated and hence should be clustered together (We used
absolute values to capture both positive and negative correlations). Also, note that
0 S g(u,'u) S 1foralluand'v.

Given the set Q, we let T’ ’ (J ’ ’ ) denote the J ’ ’ th percentile of the values in Q.
For any u, 'v E V(G), the positive weights are chosen according to the following
formula:

wt” (c,x) = w wide) + w wt. (x), (11)

where w1,w2 Z 0, on —I— wg = 1, and

and
+ _ 1, if 9(u7'v) > T”(J") 13
win) (X) — W x g(u,'v) otherwise. ( )

Hence, all the algorithmic conditions required are satisﬁed for the weights, except
possibly the third one. In order to make sure that for all u, 'v E V(G), 11);” (e) —I—

Note that other combinations of datasets may be used, with appropriate changes
in the weights. For example, incorporating coverage, network information as well as
expression information into a positive weight may be accomplished by setting

valid clustering, the fractional solutions have to be subsequently rounded to produce
integer solutions. Unfortunately, known rounding algorithms we previously developedg
in Puleo and Milenkovic (2015) tend to produce very small clusters, often as small aso‘
single-vertex clusters that are not meaningful. For our study, we hence slightly modify
the algorithm by moving the cluster size constraint (18) from the LP to the rounding
procedure. The new rounding procedure is described in Algorithm 1. Hence, the
clustering algorithm involves solving 16 without the constraint 21} 7e“ (1 — mm, ) S K
and then applying the rounding procedure of Algorithm 1.

Algorithm 1 is closely based on the rounding algorithm described in Charikar

examine its closest neighbors, where closeness is governed by the value of the output

variables we Of the LP, and partition large neighborhoods if needed tO get clusters Of
size at most K —I— 1. In the Appendix Of the Supplementary Materials, we prove that
the LP and Rounding Algorithm 1 provides a 9-approximation for the EP problem,
given that the parameter a is set tO 2 / 7 and given that the weights obey the following
constraints:

0 u):— S 1 for every edge e, and
o w: —I— we— 2 1 for every edge e.

The above inequalities were addressed as described in the previous section, and we
remind the reader that they were imposed on the weights through proper normalization.

Note that we only used high frequency mutations for our clustering problem, and
hence did not encounter any computational issues with the LP solvers. On the other
hand, if one were tO use all 25, 000 genes in the analysis, the LP solver implemented
in GurObi (https://www.gurObi.com/) would inevitably break down due tO the large
number Of constraints, which is quadratic in the number Of genes. In this case, a much
simpler scalable solution is tO use approximate LP solvers, akin tO those described
in Srith et al. (2013). The approximate solver is guaranteed tO produce a solution
that does not exceed the LP solution by more than a factor 1 —I— e, for some small value
Of 6, by using gradient descent methods that are highly scalable.

3.3 Evaluation methods

We evaluated the performance Of both C3 and COMEt in terms Of their ability tO
detect mutually exclusive, high-coverage, and biologically relevant gene clusters.
At this pOint, it is important tO observe that the inference and evaluation strategies
may appear tO involve circular arguments: Mutual exclusivity, coverage and network
distance, used tO predict the clusters, are also used tO evaluate the performance Of the
clustering method. But this is clearly not the case, as mutual exclusivity, coverage
and network distance are optimization constraints, and one always needs tO test the
quality Of a (approximate) solution tO an optimization problem based on how well
the constraints are accounted for. Other driver discovery tOOls, such as COMEt, use
the same constraint modeling and evaluation criteria. Furthermore, we added one
more evaluation criteria, related tO biological signiﬁcance and pathway enrichment
analysis, which is independent on the optimization criteria. As will be shown in the
subsequent section, this evaluation criteria conﬁrms the quality Of the C3 analysis for
cancer driver gene inference and its improvements over COMEt.

We ran both the C3 and COMEt methods using mutation and CNV data collected
from TCGA, pertaining tO breast cancer (BRCA) (Network et al., 2012) and
glioblastoma (GBM) (Brennan et al., 2013). In addition tO GBM and BRCA, we
also considered kidney cancer (KIRC) and ovarian cancer (OV), but the available
patient data appeared limited at this stage tO allow for statistically signiﬁcant and
comprehensive results. We accessed the TCGA provisional data using the cBiOPOItal
platform (GaO et al., 2013) on August 14, 2015. We ran both methods using the
same alteration dataset. We evaluated both pOint mutations and indels, and for CNVs,
we used the GISTIC thresholds (Mermel et al., 2011) Of —1 and 3 as our cut-Offs
(as already pOinted out in the previous section). TO focus on mutations with high

frequency, we only selected genes in the tOp 95 percentile Of alteration frequencies,
thereby obtaining 130 genes spanning 959 patient samples in BRCA and 170 genes
spanning 291 patient samples in GBM.

TO test the effects Of cluster sizes and the quality Of our results, we ran both C3
and COMEt tO ﬁnd clusters Of sizes upper bounded by 5, 6, 7, 10, and 15. As already
pOinted out, larger cluster sizes are easily accommodated for by C3 , but since COMEt
failed tO produce solutions for clusters Of sizes roughly greater than ten, we restricted
our attention tO the aforementioned range Of values. Due tO the fact that correlation
clustering and COMEt will cluster all genes in a dataset, and hence produce a partition
Of the gene set, a large number Of clusters will contain neutral mutations only and
will hence have no biological signiﬁcance. This is why we only compared the tOp ten
most mutually exclusive gene sets generated by C3 with those Of COMEt.

We ran COMEt with 1, 000 iterations each and 3 initialization pOints tO ensure
both timely and consistent runs. For C3, we ran the C3 clustering method for all
combinations Ofweightswl , w2, w3 E {0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1}thatsatisfyw1—I—w2—I—

biologically signiﬁcant clusters. Furthermore, the patient coverage criteria appears tg’
be less relevant than pathway coverage and some other coverage properties that havB
not been explicitly investigated in the literature. Nevertheless, we observe that thg
choice Of the weights may be completely governed by the user, and that the increasg
in one weight may produce better results in one performance category while reducing
the performance in another category. C

We used four statistical methods tO assess the performance Of the algorithms whic
reﬂect both the statistical and biological signiﬁcance Of the clusters found.

Mutual Exclusivity. TO evaluate the degree Of mutual exclusivity in a cluster, we.
performed a Fisher’s exact test (Fisher, 1922) for each pair Of genes in the cluster. ThEP

Network Clustering. We performed an additional pathway analysis for ﬂag
potential cancer gene drivers. As pOinted out in the previous section, driver geneg
tend tO be, on average, closer tO each other in a pathway compared tO randomlFF

using Dijkstra’s Algorithm on 8,726 genes from CiriellO et al. (2012). o‘
Biological Signiﬁcance. In addition tO testing the quality Of the algorithm in terms
Of optimizing mutual exclusivity and coverage, we also investigated the biological
signiﬁcance Of the C3 and COMEt methods from the perspective Of gene discovery
and pathway analysis. Although there is no overarching gold standard tO determine
biological signiﬁcance, a commonly accepted metric employed by MEMO, Dendrix,
Mutex, COMEt and other similar tOOls is tO count the number Of known driver
genes found within the best clusters according tO the given criteria. These clusters
usually contain known driver genes. TO determine the driver gene-based biological

signiﬁcance, we calculated the proportion Of drivers found in the ten most mutually-
exclusive C3 and COMEt clusters using a comprehensive, curated list Of known drivers
from the CGC.

It is important tO pOint out that while the four test benchmarks we introduced
are a reliable way tO test the Optimization quality and performance Of COMEt and
C3, nO perfect benchmark exists for detecting mutually exclusive and biologically
signiﬁcant genes clusters. The hOpe is that multiple evaluation methOds taken together
may prOVide a better understanding Of which methOds outperform others in a given
parameter and criteria setting.

4 Results

In what fOllows, we demonstrate that C3 outperforms COMEt in almost all Of the
aforementioned benchmarking criteria, or more precisely, for three out Of the four
chosen criteria. This is achieved without any special parameter tuning or Optimization.
As a rule Of thumb, C3 can be made tO outperform COMEt in any chosen single, pair
of triple of criteria by adjusting the weights. This Observation may be explained by
the fact that the weights trade Off the strengths Of different mOdeling assumptions. We
supplement our statistical analysis with a discussion Of the biological relevance Of our
ﬁndings, and explore the rOle Of the new potential drivers found by C3 within their
driver gene communities. In particular, we discuss the signiﬁcance Of large mutually
exclusive clusters that cannot be recovered by other methOds. Recall that we restrict
our attention tO the ten best performing clusters according tO mutual exclusivity, as
this approach was used in the original evaluation process Of the COMEt algorithm.

4.1 Performance evaluation

The results Of our extensive comparison between C3 and COMEt, regarding mutual
exclusivity, coverage, driver identiﬁcation, and pathway-level evaluation, are shown in
Fig. 3. Both algorithms were tested on the same server with a 256GB RAM memory.
Both methOds ran uninterruptedly when the cluster sizes were constrained tO k =
5, 6, 7, and 10. COMEt reported segfault memory errors for k = 15, and for this case,
only C3 was benchmarked.

TO assess the biological signiﬁcance Of the two methOds in terms Of their ability tO
cluster high-impact drivers from the CGC repository together, we compared the results
Of C3 and COMEt both tO each other and tO a “baseline” value equal tO the average
proportion Of drivers in the ten most mutually-exclusive clusters found, in this case
0.067, using uniform random sampling Of genes (see Fig. 3A). In BRCA, we found
that C3 detected a median driver proportion Of 0.160 and COMEt detected a median

sopch

driver proportion Of 0.117 in the tOp ten clusters. C3 outperformed COMEt for eaclb
cluster size. We also used a Mann-Whitney Rank Sum test (Rosner and Grove, 1999) tog-a
compare the overall performance Of the algorithms with respect tO mutual exclusivityé
for all cluster sizes. We chose a rank-sum test because it is unclear that the drivers area

outperform the expected number Of drivers per cluster in the random setting (p-valué,

1.594 X 10—5 and p—value 1.312 X 10—3 for C3 and COMEt, respectively).
We next tested the clusters found by each methOd based on their mutual exclusivity-h

plotted the transformed p—value distribution. Hence, in this system, larger value§l
indicate more mutually exclusivity. We again used a Mann-Whitney rank-sum test;
tO evaluate the performance Of C3 and COMEt. For BRCA, one can see that whil m
both methOds have signiﬁcant median exclusivity values (p = 7.541 X 10—6 for C
and p = 3.337 X 10—4 for COMEt), C3 has an overall more signiﬁcant p-valuegQ,
for each cluster size. The median p—value Of C3 for each cluster size is lower thanlicD
its COMEt counterpart except for the case k = 10. However, C3 does have superiorg
performance overall with a rank-sum p-value Of p = 4.0202 X 10—4. For GBM
the median exclusivity results are not as strong as for the BRCA set, for both thE°
C3 and COMEt methOd. C3 has a median p-value Of 0.3795 as Opposed tO COMEt’sﬁ
0.5022. The general drOp in signiﬁcance may be attributed tO a lower conﬁdence 015’
the Fisher’s test due tO a small number Of samples available; recall that the GBlViQ
set inVOlved 291 samples, compared tO 959 BRCA samples. This indicates that one2
should lOOk at individual signiﬁcant clusters tO evaluate mutual exclusivity. Even for
the reduced median p-value regime, C3 outperforms COMEt in signiﬁcance, having
lower median p—values for each cluster size. Overall, the C3 p-values are consistently
and signiﬁcantly lower than those prOduced by COMEt for mutual exclusivity (the
rank-sum test p-value equals 0.04401).

The results Of the coverage tests are depicted in Fig. 3C. In the coverage
benchmark, COMEt outperforms C3 for GBM, but neither methOd outperforms the
other for BRCA. In BRCA, both methOds show comparable performance, with a

8

Hou ef al.

 

median result for the fraction of samples covered equal to 0.5505 for C3, and 0.5662
for CoMEt. This rather poor performance of both methods is observed for all values of
k, with no p-value based on Student’s T—test (Zimmerman, 1987) being less than 0.05.
The largest difference in coverage recorded for the two methods is present for k: : 6.
In conclusion, there appears to be no statistical difference between C3 and CoMEt in
terms ofBRCA coverage percentage (p-value of 0.5127). In GBM, the median p-value
for coverage difference is more pronounced. The median coverage of C3 is 0.632 and
the median coverage of CoMEt is 0.696. CoMEt ﬁnds signiﬁcantly higher-coverage
clusters according to Student’s T-test, with p-value 0.0345, and the most pronounced
coverage percentage differences exist for small values of is (0.3745 vs. 0.6495 for
k: = 5 C3 and CoMEt, respectively). It is also important to note the wide distribution
of coverage score values produced by C3 for small it: the IQR (Interquartile range)
value is roughly 0.35 for k: = 5. The most likely reason behind this result is
that our test weights were chosen to boost the relevance of mutual-exclusivity and
biological signiﬁcance rather than coverage. Mutual exclusivity accounts for 100%
of the negative weights of edges, while coverage accounts for only 16.7% of the
positive weights. We justify this weight choice by the fact that it leads to multiple
signiﬁcant cluster discovery and with our assumption that coverage is a less signiﬁcant
driver property compared to mutual exclusivity. We also point out that it appears that
a biologically more relevant coverage constraint is pathway coverage, rather than
patient sample coverage.

As already mentioned in the previous sections, one advantage of C3 is that the
user can adjust the weights according to her/his own belief about the signiﬁcance of
patient coverage. For example, by changing the averaging weights in our GBM run
to 101 : 0.60 (coverage), :02 : 0.20 (network), and rug : 0.20 (expression), we
obtain a coverage percentage of 0.7903 for k : 5. However, this excellent coverage
comes at a cost of a less signiﬁcant mutual exclusivity score (fractional value 0.4288)
and a lower proportion of detected drivers (fractional value 0.1267). As may be seen
from the above example, C3 can be adapted to the user’s speciﬁcation to best reﬂect
the scope and preferences of the analysis.

Fig. 4. A cluster of potential driver genes inferred from BRCA. (A) shows the alteration landscape of
the cluster, with blue representing mutation events, red representing copy number deletions, and green
representing copy number ampliﬁcations. (B) represents a known subnetwork which contains 6 genes (out
of 7) in (A). The more intense the red, the higher the alteration frequency of the gene. Nodes highlighted
in black represent driver candidates identiﬁed by C3 within a small subnetwork. Edges are depicted in
black if there exists a direct interaction between two genes. Green edges represent an interaction that

undergoes a protein state change. Purple edges are other interactions.

Another setting in which we analyzed C3 and CoMEt involves pairwise distances
of drivers in the network (see Fig. 3D). Here, we calculated the average pairwise
distance between all pairs of genes clustered together. We then used Student’s T—test
to determine the statistical signiﬁcance of this value. We also compared the values for
both algorithms based on 1000 randomly selected genes by using aperrnutation test.
For BRCA, we found no signiﬁcant performance difference between the two methods
in terms of the average pairwise distance: 3.110 for C3 and 3.070 for CoMEt, with

a p-value of 0.9330. In GBM, C3 showed a smaller average pairwise distance of
2.908 compared to CoMEt’s 3.097. This difference is statistically signiﬁcant, with
a p-value of 0.0379. The small average network distance results of C3 for GBM,
coupled with the low coverage, leads to the conclusion that C3 favors niche, exclusive
clusters in biologically relevant cancer pathways. Hence, the method may be useful
for discovering speciﬁc molecular cancer subtypes. Both methods had an average
pairwise distance well below the permutation benchmark of 3.903: the p-values of
both C3 and CoMEt were less than 2 X 10‘16 for both cancers.

In conclusion, from our detailed evaluation we conclude that although C3 does not
simultaneously outperform CoMEt with respect to all four evaluation criteria, but only
three of them (which already represents a signiﬁcant advantage), the C3 performance
indicates a strong overall propensity to select biologically more relevant and more
mutually exclusive clusters, with a higher degree of ﬂexibility compared to CoMEt.

4.2 Discovering potential driver pathways

We examine next the potential of the C3 algorithm to detect clusters whose geneg
may be new candidate cancer drivers. We focus our search on clusters that contaia
biologically signiﬁcant driver genes and known biological network interactions, 3.11%
exhibit high mutual exclusivity and coverage. At the same time, we only consider thg‘
large cluster size regime, as results in this domain have not been previously reporte

in the literature and as they offer many new interesting insights. Two examples of Dig
analysis are shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5.

In BRCA, one candidate cluster with several potential novel driver genes i5
the cluster containing PTEN, H UWEl, CNTNAPZ, GRIDZ, CACNAIB, CYSLTRZ,
M YH I depicted in Fig. 4. The genes in the candidate cluster are mutually exclusive
(p-value : 0.0084). The genome landscape of this cluster is dominated primarily by
mutations in PTEN and HUWEI, and secondarily by homozygous deletions in PTEN
and C YSLTRZ. The most frequently altered gene in this set is a common driver gene
PTEN, a tumor suppressor gene that negatively regulates the AKT/PKB apoptosis
pathway (Stambolic et al., 1998). The remaining six genes in the cluster are potential
driver candidates. H UWEI is a part of the Mule multidomain complex of the HECT

domain family Of E3 ubiquitin ligases responsible for apoptosis suppression, DNA
damage repair, and transcriptional regulation (Inoue et al., 2013). CNTNAP2 is a
neurexin protein with functions in cell-tO-cell adhesion and an epidermal growth
factor and was found tO be hypomethylated in breast cancer cell lines (Shann et al.,
2008). Hypomethylation and the association with epidermal growth factors, coupled
with a large number Of ampliﬁcations in the alteration landscape Of CNTNAP2
suggest potential oncogenic functions Of the gene. GRID2 is an ionotrOpic glutamate
receptor that is frequently deleted in lymphomas (Roy et al. , 2011). CACNAI B codes
for a N-type calcium channel which is responsible for calcium inﬂux. Defects in
the calcium inﬂux channel can lead tO alteration in the apoptosis, proliferation,
migration and invasion pathways Of breast cancer (Azimi et al., 2014). CYSLTRZ
is a prOinﬂammatory cysteinyl leukotriene receptor that plays a rOle in cancer cell
differentiation and is associated with breast cancer survival rates (Magnusson et al.,
2011). MYH1 is a myosin heavy chain protein that plays a rOle in cell signaling and
prO-apotosis pathways.

Perhaps more important than the prOpensity Of each individual gene tO be a driver is
the collective interaction pattern Of the seven genes in the cluster in a cancer pathway.
From Fig. 4, it is clear that the each gene in the cluster interacts with each other
in a tightly-connected community with nO gene more than three nOdes away when
plotted in the network, using the cBiOPortal visualization tOOl. The seven genes in
the cluster PT EN, H U WEI , CNTNAP2, GRID2, CACNAI B, CYSLTR2, MYH1 are
strong candidates tO deﬁne a novel driver pathway. This conclusion is reinforced by
the presence Of high impact common drivers (TP53, MY C, AKYZ and PIK3RI) which
deﬁne several important cancer pathways such as apoptosis, DNA repair, and cell
cycle arrest (Vazquez et al., 2008; Stemke-Hale et al., 2008).

We also examined a cluster containing potential cancer drivers relevant for GBM.
In GBM, we found a cluster Of size 10 with four known drivers and many potential
drivers. The cluster includes GLII, WNT2, BRAE PLCGI, FAS, CREBBP, BRCA2,
GLIZ, PIK3R5, VAMP3 (see Fig. 5). This large cluster has a p—value Of 0.090 1 in terms
Of mutual exclusivity, which is actually low as compared tO other GBM clusters. The
cluster also contains several important driver genes such as WNTZ, BRAE BRCA2
and CREBBP which encompass pathways such as sonic hedgehog signaling, cell fate
determination, cell growth and apoptosis, checkpoint activation, and DNA repair.

Additionally, six out Of the ten members are within the same compact network
community (GLII, PLCGI, FAS, CREBBP, BRCA2, PIK3R5). Of these six genes,
GLIl and GLI2 are hedgehog signaling genes that are common and ﬁrst isolated
in glioblastoma. These genes are responsible for cell differentiation and stem cell
self-renewal (Clement et al., 2007). PLCGI is involved in intracellular transduction
Of receptor-mediated tyrosine kinase activators, and it has been classiﬁed as a
biomarker in GBM (SeraO et al., 2011). FAS is a cell surface receptor that
mediates apoptosis. FAS is known as a histological hallmark Of GBM, affecting both
apoptosis and necrosis factors (Gratas et al., 1997). Finally, PIK3R5 is a subunit Of
phosphatidylinositOl 3-kinases whO together have important effects on cell growth,
proliferation, differentiation, motility, survival and intracellular trafﬁcking.

Additional cluster analysis examples are relegated tO the Supplementary materials,
focussing on clusters that contain lesser known and documented driver genes.

5 Discussion and Conclusion

We described a novel methOd, termed C3, which has the potential tO precisely and
efﬁciently identify clusters Of gene mOdules with mutually exclusive mutation patterns.
The C3 algorithm uses large-scale cancer genomics datasets which are pre-processed
tO yield parameters governing novel constrained correlation clustering techniques.
The Optimization criteria used in clustering include patterns Of mutual exclusivity Of
mutations, patient sample coverage, and network driver concentration.

There are several major advancements Of our methOd when compared tO previously
known approaches. Unlike methOds that use randomized approaches without the
guarantee that multiple runs Of the methOds on the same data will prOduce compatible
results (such as COMEt), C3 is “consistent” in so far that by running the same LP
solver, the same results will be generated. Also, C3 has computational complexity
that does not depend on the chosen cluster sizes, and is hence much more appropriate
for large cluster prOblems than other methOds. Furthermore, it partitions the gene set
and hence creates clusters covering all genes used in the analysis, although it may also
be adapted tO accommodate overlapping clusters. This is in contrast with the results
prOduced by other methOds that tend tO identify only a small number Of mOdules with
limited number Of genes.

None Of the previous methOds were able tO identify clusters utilizing different
sources Of information via a weighting mechanism. This is important because it gives
us ﬂexibility tO focus more on certain aspects based on the analysis. For example, we

can focus more on mutual exclusivity instead Of coverage tO identify clusters speciﬁc
tO a group Of samples which may facilitate the discovery Of subtype-speciﬁc mOdules.

By addressing the above challenges, we believe our new methOd C3 represents a
unique tOOl tO efﬁciently and reliably identify mutation patterns and driver pathways
in large-scale cancer genomics studies.

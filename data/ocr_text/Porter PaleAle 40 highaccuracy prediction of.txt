ABSTRACT

Summary: Protein secondary structure and solvent accessibility pre-
dictions are a fundamental intermediate step towards protein structure
and function prediction. We present new systems for the ab initio
prediction of protein secondary structure and solvent accessibility,
Porter 4.0 and PaleAIe 4.0. Porter 4.0 predicts secondary structure
correctly for 82.2% of residues. PaleAIe 4.0’s accuracy is 80.0% for
prediction in two classes with a 25% accessibility threshold. We show
that the increasing training set sizes that come with the continuing
growth of the Protein Data Bank keep yielding prediction quality
improvements and examine the impact of protein resolution on
prediction performances.

Availability: Porter 4.0 and PaleAIe 4.0 are freely available for
academic users at http://disti||f.ucd.ie/porterpaleale/. Up to 64 kb of
input in FASTA format can be processed in a single submission,
with predictions now being returned to the user within a single web
page and, optionally, a single email.

1 INTRODUCTION

As the Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure
Prediction enters its third decade of life after CASPlO,
one-dimensional protein structural features such as secondary
structure (SS) and relative solvent accessibility (RSA) still
remain a fundamental stage towards structure prediction, as
they are indispensable for remote homology detection (Fischer
and Eisenberg, 1996), contribute to contact map predictions
Wullo et al., 2006b), help the selection of local structural frag-
ments for model reconstruction (Simons et al., 1999) and, ultim-
ately, when known, considerably reduce the degrees of freedom
available to a protein. SS and SA, alongside other structural
features, have also proven useful in many other tasks, e.g. the
prediction of protein subcellular localization (Nair and Rost,
2005), intrinsic disorder Wullo et al., 2006a), bioactive peptides
within proteins (Mooney et al., 2013) and protein—protein inter-
actions (Porollo and Meller, 2007). Reﬂecting the usefulness of
SS and RSA, our public predictors of these features, Porter and
PaleAle have served a combined 275000 queries to date from
40000 distinct users, and Porter’s SS predictions are used for

fragment selection within the protein structure prediction pack-
age Rosetta (Simons et al., 1999).

We have trained larger, more expressive ensembles of cascaded
bidirectional recurrent neural networks (BRNN) on recent re-
dundancy-reduced subsets of the Protein Data Bank to predict
SS and RSA. The new systems, Porter 4.0 and PaleAle 4.0, out-
perform our older public web servers Porter and PaleAle, with
SS now at >82% correct prediction and 2-class (25% threshold)
RSA predictions 80% correct. The new systems, Porter 4.0 and
PaleAle 4.0, are freely available for academic users through a
new public web server.

2 METHODS AND PERFORMANCES

Porter 4.0 and PaleAle 4.0 are based on ensembles of BRNN
(Baldi et al., 1999). In both servers, we use a cascaded architec-
ture as in (Pollastri and McLysaght, 2005; Pollastri et al., 2007;
Mooney and Pollastri, 2009) with a first BRNN predicting SS
from the primary sequence and multiple sequence alignments
(MSA), and a second BRNN ﬁltering the predictions of the
first stage. MSA are generated with three rounds of PS1-
BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997) against a 90% redundancy-
reduced UniProt (Suzek et al., 2007). The main differences
between Porter 4.0 and PaleAle 4.0 and our previous servers
Porter and PaleAle are the greatly expanded size of the training
sets, the rough doubling of the number of free parameters of the
models to accommodate a greater number of examples and a
deeper training procedure.

The dataset Porter 4.0 and PaleAle 4.0 are trained on is
derived from the Protein Data Bank as available on June 23,
2012. We sorted the set by quality (measured as reso-
lution+r_value/2O or ﬁxed at 10 for NMR structures) and re-
dundancy, and reduced it at a 25 % sequence identity threshold,
resulting in 9152 proteins. We further selected the 7522 proteins
with a quality better than 4 (F ull_set), but reserved the remaining
1630 proteins of lower quality for testing purposes (LowRes_set).
A total of 2128 proteins of F ull_set have a quality better than 2.5
(HiRes_set).

Porter 4.0 is trained to predict SS in three classes: Helix:
H,G,I from DSSP (Kabsch and Sander, 1983); Strand=E,B
from DSSP; and Coil=the rest. PaleAle 4.0 predicts RSA in
four classes, with accessibility ranges: [0%,4%]; [4%,25%];
[25%,50%]; [50%,oo]. Both systems were trained and bench-
marked in 5-fold crossvalidation on F ull_set. Five architecturally
different BRNN were trained for each fold and then ensembled.
The number of free parameters in each BRNN ranges between

Note: Performances of Porter and PaleAle on sets of diverse quality. When the
training set is Full_set, performances on Full_set and HiRes_set are in 5-fold
cross validation, whereas LowRes_set performances are measured as the average
obtained by models from all 5-folds of Porter and PaleAle. When the training set is
HiRes_set, performances on HiRes_set are in 5-fold cross validation, whereas
Full_set and LowRes_set performances are averages from the 5 training folds.

13000 and 18000, compared with 5000—8000 parameters for
the old Porter and PaleAle. The overall prediction performances
are reported in Table 1, alongside the performances of past
versions of the servers. Porter 4.0 predicts 82.2% of all residues
in the correct class, an improvement of 3.1% over Porter
(Pollastri and McLysaght, 2005). PaleAle’s improvement is
0.9% over the 2007 version, for a 4-class correct classiﬁcation
of 55.3%, or 80.0% when the 4 classes are recast into 2 with an
RSA threshold of 25%. Although PaleAle 4.0 is not optimized
for this task, real valued solvent accessibility obtained from its
class outputs by simple linear regression yields a mean average
error of 0.14.

We also evaluated how the quality of a protein structure re-
lates to the servers’ accuracy (Table 2). Porter 4.0 is only mar-
ginally more accurate on the HiRes_set than on the F ull_set
(82.3% versus 82.2%), whereas PaleAle 4.0 is signiﬁcantly
more accurate (56.8% versus 55.3%). Similarly, when we test
the methods on LowRes_set, which contains poor resolution
and NMR proteins, PaleAle’s performances decrease more
markedly from Full_set levels (—5.7%) than those of Porter
(—3.6%). We also trained the full Porter and PaleAle systems
on all 9152 proteins (Full_set + LowRes_set). The overall results
(not reported) were only marginally different, with a fractional
improvement on LowRes_set and a loss of <0.1% on the rest of
the set. Finally, we trained Porter and PaleAle only on HiRes_set
and tested them on all three sets (Table 2). In this case, the per-
formances are signiﬁcantly lower on all sets for both predictors.

The 5-fold cross validation performance of Porter on HiRes_set
is 81.3%, which is higher than the 2004 results (79.1%), which
were obtained on a similarly sized training set but with older
MSA, but lower than what we obtain on F ull_set (82.2%),
which is larger, but based on the same MSA. This seems to sug-
gest that at least some of the gains of the more recent predictors
(Table 1) may come from training set sizes, rather than from the
size of the sequence databases MSA are obtained from.

3 THE PORTER 4.0 AND PALEALE 4.0
WEB SERVERS

Porter 4.0 and PaleAle 4.0 are freely available for academic users
as web servers at the address: http://distillf.ucd.ie/porterpaleale/.
The servers implement an ensemble of all the models from all
folds, that is 5 models by 5 folds or 25 models in total per server.
As this effectively means that the servers are trained on 25%
more proteins than their benchmark in 5-fold cross validation,
their performances are expected to at least match those reported,
although this will have to be validated when new independent
sets will become available in the future.

The interface of the servers requires the user to input the
queries in FASTA format and, optionally, an email address.
Up to 64 kb of input (~200 average proteins) can be processed
in a single submission. Larger predictions can be processed Via
subsequent submissions of up to 64 kb each. An exemption from
the 64 kb limit can be obtained on a one-off basis by email
request to the authors. The predictions are returned to the user
as a web page and, optionally, Via email if an address is provided.
Links on the response web page also give access to conﬁdence
values for the predictions, and to PaleAle’s outputs mapped
onto real valued RSA. Depending on the load on the queue,
a protein of 300 residues takes as little as 4 min to be processed
and a maximal submission of 64 kb as little as 2h. The sets
used for training the servers are available for download on the
web server.

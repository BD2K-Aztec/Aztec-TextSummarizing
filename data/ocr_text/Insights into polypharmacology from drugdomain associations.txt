ABSTRACT

Motivation: Polypharmacology (the ability of a single drug to affect
multiple targets) is a key feature that may explain part of the decreas-
ing success of conventional drug discovery strategies driven by the
quest for drugs to act selectively on a single target. Most drug targets
are proteins that are composed of domains (their structural and func-
tional building blocks).

Results: In this work, we model drug—domain networks to explore the
role of protein domains as drug targets and to explain drug polyphar-
macology in terms of the interactions between drugs and protein do-
mains. We find that drugs are organized around a privileged set of
druggable domains.

Conclusions: Protein domains are a good proxy for drug targets, and
drug polypharmacology emerges as a consequence of the multi-
domain composition of proteins.

1 INTRODUCTION

The decrease in the translation of drug candidates into effective
therapies during the past two decades has occurred concurrently
with the goal of rational drug design of developing selective lig-
ands that act on a single target (Hopkins, 2008). This ‘classical’
perspective is an oversimpliﬁcation challenged by a growing
body of evidence showing that there are many drugs for each
target and that a single drug can affect multiple targets (Goh
et al., 2007; Mestres et al., 2009; Yildirim et al., 2007).

The emergent concept of polypharmacology bears this out,
both from a target and a drug perspective. On one hand, we
can obtain the correct combination of targets from analyses of
the biological networks associated with a given disease, and on
the other hand, we can select or design ‘magic shotguns’, i.e.
drugs that are able to bind multiple targets with low speciﬁcity
(Zanzoni et al., 2009). The network perspective from the study by
Yildirim et al. (2007) illustrates this situation well. They orga-
nized all approved drugs reported by DrugBank into a drug—
target network in which the drugs are depicted as nodes that
are connected if the drugs share a protein target, and they also
generated a target—protein network in which the proteins are
nodes that are connected if the proteins are targeted by the
same drug. More than half of the drugs in the drug—target net-
work formed a giant interconnected cluster, and in both

networks, the majority of the nodes were connected to at least
one other drug/target, that is drugs share protein targets and
proteins are targeted by more than one drug. Although
Yildirim et al. bring up polypharmacology as a general attribute
of drugs, their results also illustrate an important bias of drug
design, which is that many approved drugs are based on the same
therapeutic targets. Mestres et al. pursue this topic further and
show that because of limited time and resources, small molecules
are not screened systematically through a large and complete
panel of proteins. Thus, drug—target networks derived on the
basis of public bibliographic sources may be more representative
of the target space explored by the pharmaceutical industry
rather than being a true reﬂection of drug polypharmacology
(Mestres et al., 2008). When they take into account drug afﬁnity
data by including targets with no particular therapeutic interest,
they ﬁnd that drugs target even more proteins, illustrating that
drug polypharmacology is the rule rather than the exception.

Polypharmacology has recently been explained in terms of
protein modularity within protein interaction networks. Within
any protein interaction network, a module represents a densely
connected group of nodes (and these may be either proteins or
functional motifs/domains) that are weakly connected to the re-
maining network. A rich variety of global measures based on
reverse engineering of network topologies have been suggested
to uncover the organizing principles behind complex networks.
Such reverse engineering of network topologies-based measures
reveal that networked structures can emerge at different levels,
from single-node characteristics and the tendency of pairs of
nodes to connect to each other, to the patterns exhibited by
associations of three or more nodes known as motifs (Nacher
and Schwartz, 2012). Here, we aim to re-orientate the ﬁeld to
the fundamental principle of protein science, the premise that the
functional units of proteins are domains, to explain
polypharmacology.

Protein domains are compact and functional structures that
can be considered the building blocks of proteins. The deﬁnition
of protein domains overlaps the structural and functional views
of proteins (Koonin et al., 2002). Because domains are units of
structure (Orengo et al., 1997) and there is a limited repertoire of
domain types Wolf et al., 2000), protein domains are combined
to form different proteins with different functions (Kummerfeld
and Teichmann, 2009). Furthermore, protein—protein inter-
actions are dominated by domain—domain interactions (Pang
et al., 2012). Therefore, we think that drug—target interactions
may be mediated by drug—domain interactions; hence, we argue
that protein domains can be major contributors to polypharma-
cology. In other words, because proteins have a modular struc-
ture and the same domains can be repeatedly found in different
proteins, the reason why a drug binds multiple protein targets

Polypharmacology from protein domains

 

may be related to the proteins sharing a common domain
that the drug may be targeting. In this work, we attempt to
unravel the association between drugs and protein domains to
address the hypothesis that protein domains are the areas on
which drugs act and are an important factor in the polypharma-
cological behaviour of most drugs.

2 METHODS

2.1 Data retrieval

We compiled a drug—target interaction dataset for human proteins using
interaction data from the databases DrugBank (Knox et al., 2010),
STITCH (Kuhn et al., 2008) and MATADOR (Gunther et al., 2008).
We ﬁltered the drug—target interactions from DrugBank to exclude nutra—
ceutical compounds and to include only approved and experimental
drugs labelled with a PubChem Compound identiﬁer. High-conﬁdence
drug—target interactions from STITCH and MATADOR were added to
our data to obtain a comprehensive non-redundant set of drug—target
interactions for human proteins. The CATH and PFAM domain com-
positions for each target protein were obtained from Gene3D (release
10.2) and BioMart (Guberman et al., 2011), respectively.

2.2 Scoring and evaluation of drug—domain associations

Each drug that interacts with a protein in our initial dataset is associated
with all the domains that comprise the protein. We formulated a scoring
scheme based on the information content of a drug associated with a
domain, i.e. the self-information of each drug—domain pair from all the
possible drug—domain pairs. The self-information for a drug—domain
pair, taken from the mathematical theory of information, is deﬁned as

nd nD
IdDz—l PD'P D: .D=_._
( ) ng (d. ), (d. ) pal) p( ) (Z d) (21,)
where P(d,D) is the probability of ﬁnding a drug (d) associated to a
domain ( D ), and nd and nD are the number of times that drugs and
domains, respectively, appear in the dataset. We calculate the score (s) for
each drug—domain pair in our network as

s(dD) = N(dD) . I(dD)

where N ( dD ) is the number of times the pair dB is in the network.

Random drug—domain networks were computed by shufﬂing the ini-
tial drug—target interactions and keeping the same CATH and PFAM
domain composition for each target. For each drug—domain pair in our
network, we obtained a distribution of scores computed from the random
networks in which the particular drug—domain pair was found. Thus, for
each drug—domain pair, we have a score and a distribution of 25 random
scores. We computed the probability that each score was included in the
distribution of random scores using a statistical t—test. Using a P—value
threshold of 0.001, we could assess whether a drug—domain association
was likely to occur by chance.

2.3 Domain co-occurrence network

Two domain co-occurrence networks were built using the CATH and
PFAM domain composition for each protein in the drug—protein inter-
action dataset. Two domains in the network are linked if they appear in
the same protein.

2.4 Evolutionary analysis of drug targets

Protein sequences of human GPCRs and kinases were obtained based on
the presence of characteristic CATH domains in the human proteome
and aligned with ClustalW (Larkin et al., 2007). We obtained the phylo-
genetic distance from each tree and built one network for each target class

in the sequence similarity space. In these networks, nodes represent pro-
tein sequences, and two nodes are linked if the phylogenetic distance
between the proteins is <0.75.

Data retrieval, network building and analysis were performed using
the Ruby and Python scripting languages and the Networkx Python
module (http://networkx.lanl.gov/). Bipartite graph analyses were per-
formed with Cytoscape and with the BipartiteNet plugin developed by
our group.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Modelling the drug—domain networks

Our initial dataset comprises 5531 drugs, 3580 proteins and
12754 drug—protein interactions. We have considered two com-
plementary perspectives on protein domains: the structural per-
spective provided by CATH (Orengo et al., 1997) and the
function-oriented perspective offered by PFAM (Finn et al.,
2010).

With our scoring scheme based on the statistics of domain
occurrence in the protein targets of each drug, we provide reli-
able drug—domain associations for 26.05% (CATH) and 27.78%
(PFAM) of the drugs in the initial drug—protein interaction
dataset. Our drug—domain network models include only the
drug—domain associations that are more likely to appear than
those expected at random (P-value = 0.001), based on the statis-
tical meaning of the occurrence of every possible drug—domain
pair.

To provide a meaningful comparison of the drug—domain as-
sociations with the drug—protein interactions, we built drug—pro-
tein subnetworks for the drugs that we can associate with the
PFAM and CATH domains. Table 1 shows the global properties
of the resulting drug—domain and drug—protein bipartite
networks.

3.2 Druggable domains

The drug average degree indicates that drug—domain networks
tend to be organized around particular druggable domains that
draw together most of the drugs. We checked this ﬁnding by
examining the network heterogeneity and the clustering coefﬁ-
cient of the drug—drug projections. Monopartite projections of
the drug—domain and drug—protein networks (where drugs are
nodes and two drugs are connected by an edge if they share at
least one target in the corresponding bipartite network) contain
information about how drugs are targeting the same proteins (or
domains). Projections from drug—domain networks tend to have
fewer hubs and more clusters than those from drug—protein net-
works, as shown in Table 2.

When we compared the drug—domain bipartite networks with
the drug—protein bipartite subnetworks, it was clear that drugs
revolve around a privileged set of targets to a greater extent in
the former. We aimed to identify these druggable domains as
proxies for the druggable genome. Hopkins and Groom (2002)
used drug-binding domain annotations to identify the druggable
protein families in the human genome. Our drug—domain asso-
ciations revealed roughly the same description of the druggable
genome.

3.3 Drug selectivity in drug—domain networks

Drug—domain associations are more selective than drug—protein
interactions. The degree distributions of the bipartite networks
clearly indicate the higher selectivity of drug—domain associ-
ations (Fig. 1).

The fraction of drugs targeting one domain is considerably
higher than that targeting one protein in both the CATH and
the PFAM drug—domain networks, whereas the fraction of drugs
with more than one target is lower in both the CATH and the
PFAM drug—domain networks except for drugs with two targets.
In this particular case, there are more drugs targeting two do-
mains than drugs targeting two proteins. When we inspected the
co-occurrence of these domain pairs in the same proteins using
domain co-occurrence networks, we found that 94.5% (CATH)
and 87.5% (PFAM) of the pairs appear in the same protein.

Nacher and Scwartz (2012) showed that proteins linked by
drug associations tend to interact preferably with one another
than with other proteins. To check whether the domains asso-
ciated with promiscuous drugs are clustered in modules, we
mapped drugs associated with two or more PFAM domains to
a protein—domain interaction network obtained from the
DOMINE database Wellaboina et al., 2010). We identiﬁed 575
modules within this domain interaction network using
ModuLand (Kovacs et al., 2010). We found that 85% of these
modules contained up to ﬁve domains, and that 46.94% of the
promiscuous drugs are associated with the PFAM domains con-
tained in these modules.

3.4 Phylogenetic relationships between druggable domains

To get insight into the evolutionary relationships between do-
mains associated with polypharmacological drugs, we selected
two examples of drugs targeting the main classes of

pharmacological targets (GPCRs and kinases): doxepin
(PubChem ID 667 477), a modulator of a number of serotonin,
adrenergic and histamine receptor subtypes, and staurosporine
(PubChem ID 44120114), a protein kinase inhibitor. In
Supplementary Figure S1, we represent the phylogenetic trees
for GPCRs and kinases as networks in the sequence similarity
space, where proteins with high sequence similarity appear linked
together in modules. Doxepin targets are closely related to each
other, whereas staurosporine targets show a much lower se-
quence similarity.

4 DISCUSSION

Our work is not the ﬁrst to attempt to associate drugs with
protein domains. Wang et al. (2012) developed a statistical ap-
proach to predict potential targets for new drugs based on inter-
actions between drugs and protein domains. Interestingly, they
assumed that drugs act by binding to speciﬁc proteins, contrary
to the idea proposed by drug polypharmacology. Moreover, they
relied on the idea that drugs interacting with the same domain
tend to share therapeutic effects; hence, they associate domains
with therapeutic categories using the anatomical therapeutic
chemical (ATC) codes, that is, a domain is associated with a
group of drugs sharing the same ATC code. As far as we
know, the work described in this report is the ﬁrst attempt to
identify direct drug—domain associations in a systematic and
comprehensive manner.

Other previous research has focused on drug—domain relation-
ships as well. Hopkins and Groom (2002) and Russ and Lampel
(2005) relied on manual annotations of drug-binding domain to
explore the druggable genome. We obtained roughly the same set

Polypharmacology from protein domains

 

of druggable domains with our automatic method. We found
that drugs tend to revolve around a privileged set of domains,
as can be observed in the drug—domain bipartite networks and
can be deduced from the monopartite projections of the drug—
domain and drug—protein networks. Network heterogeneity re-
ﬂects the tendency of a network to contain hub nodes; a drug—
drug projection of a bipartite network with a low heterogeneity
reﬂects a trend in which drugs are organized around a privileged
set of targets. This is the case for the drug—drug projections of
both drug—domain networks when compared with their corres-
ponding drug—protein subnetworks, as shown in Table 2.

Drug degree distributions (particularly in drug—domain net-
works), after we corrected for the co-occurrence of domains in
the same proteins, clearly show that drugs target domains in a
more speciﬁc way than they target proteins. Different domain
targets for a polypharmacological drug tend to cluster in the
same modules, within domain interaction networks such as
DOMINE. These domains, and in particular co-occurring do-
mains, can be interpreted as a single module or as a single
pharmacological target, in the same sense that protein complexes
are considered as drug targets in the work of Nacher and
Schwartz (2012).

To get a hint of the evolutionary perspective of druggable
domains, we selected polypharmacological drugs that target the
two main families of druggable proteins, as described by
Hopkins et al. (2002) in the druggable genome, i.e. GPCRs
and kinases. Although both doxepin and staurosporine can be
associated with protein domains that are archetypical for each
protein class, the targets of doxepin are closely related in the
GPCRs phylogenetic tree, whereas the targets of staurosporine
are widespread in the human kinome. These two examples illus-
trate a difference in the subfamily targeting speciﬁcity of the
selected drugs and suggest further studies, such as the implica-
tions in drug polypharmacology of the evolutionary conservation
of structural domains (with particular focus on binding site con-
servation) and the structural similarity of domains for distinct
targets.

Our results support the idea that protein domains are a good
proxy for drug targets when considering the structural and func-
tional perspectives of their deﬁnition. Hence, drug polypharma-
cology, understood as the ability of a single drug to bind several
proteins, emerges as a consequence of the multidomain compos-
ition of proteins.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: A growing body of literature has demonstrated the
potential for non-invasive diagnosis of a variety of human genetic
diseases using cell-free DNA extracted from maternal plasma
samples in early gestation. Such methods are of great significance
to the obstetrics community because of their potential use as
clinical standard of care. Proof of concept for such approaches has
been established for aneuploidy and paternally inherited dominant
traits. Although significant progress has recently been made, the
non-invasive diagnosis of monogenic diseases that segregate
in a recessive mendelian fashion is more problematic. Recent
developments in microfluidic digital PCR and DNA sequencing have
resulted in a number of recent advances in this field. These have
largely, although not exclusively, been used for the development of
diagnostic methods for aneuploidy. However, given their prevalence,
it is likely that such methods will be utilized towards the development
of non-invasive methods for diagnosing monogenetic disorders.
Results: With this in mind, we have undertaken a statistical modeling
of three contemporary (digital) analytical methods in the context
of prenatal diagnosis using cell free DNA for monogenic diseases
that segregate in a recessive mendelian fashion. We provide an
experimental framework for the future development of diagnostic
methods in this context that should be considered when designing
molecular assays that seek to establish proof of concept in this field.

1 INTRODUCTION

During the past few decades, there has been great interest in the
search for deﬁnitive, yet minimally invasive, low risk procedures
for the prenatal diagnosis of fetal genetic disease. Although
sophisticated evolution of serum-based screens has occurred,
in which concentrations of speciﬁc protein markers associated
with fetal malformations are determined in combination with
ultrasonography; these do not achieve deﬁnitive diagnosis (Meier
et al., 2003; Summers et al., 2003a, b).

Recently, there has been rapid development of non-invasive and
potentially deﬁnitive diagnostic approaches that utilize circulating

cell-free fetal DNA as a substrate. This circulating fetal DNA is
thought to be of trophoblast origin and is present in maternal plasma
at a genome equivalent frequency of between ~3—10% (Fan et al.,
2008; L0, 2009). Practical applications of the analysis of fetal DNA
in maternal plasma are growing and are perhaps best exempliﬁed by
successful non-invasive prediction of fetal Rhesus D blood group
status (Chiu et al., 2005; L0, 1999, 2000), the diagnosis of other
paternally inherited mutations causing, for example, thalassemia
and achondroplasia (Li et al., 2005, 2006, 2007) and the detection
of trisomy 18 via methylation—speciﬁc PCR of polymorphic fetal
alleles.

Despite the rapid progress towards the development of diagnostic
methods for fetal disease using cell-free DNA in maternal plasma,
there are still a number of obstacles to overcome before this can
be used in routine clinical practice. Most signiﬁcant is the fact the
maternally inherited fetal alleles are identical in primary sequence to
their endogenous maternal counterparts. One approach to overcome
this has been to exploit the fact that the nucleated portion of the
maternal hematopoietic system and apoptotic bodies derived from
the placental villus are the primary sources of the maternal and
fetal components of cell-free plasma nucleic acids, respectively.
Therefore, functional genomic differences between these tissues can
be exploited to identify biomarkers for the selective enrichment
of fetal nucleic acids (Chu et al., 2009b; Tsui et al., 2004) and it
has been shown that differentially transcribed and/0r methylated
loci on informative chromosomes can be used for the diagnosis of
aneuploidy (Tong et al., 2006).

Recently it has been demonstrated that microﬂuidic digital PCR
approaches have utility for the diagnosis of aneuploidy using
functional biomarkers (Lo et al., 2007). Digital PCR has also been
used for the diagnosis of monogenic disease (Lun et al., 2008)
in which allelic ratios are quantiﬁed in maternal plasma DNA
samples. In the context of a recessive mutation that segregates in
a Mendelian fashion, an affected fetus would be distinguished from
a heterozygous carrier by deviation from a 1:1 allelic ratio to a state
in which the recessive allele is over-represented as a consequence
of its increased fetal contribution and concomitant absence of the
wild type fetal counterpart.

It has also recently been shown that high-throughput whole-
genome DNA sequencing can be used for the detection of fetal
aneuploidy (Chiu et al., 2008; Chu et al., 2009a; Fan et al.,
2008). This is an exciting development with great potential because
it is a direct method that requires no gene or chromosome-
speciﬁc biomarkers and provides chromosome-wide insight into
karyotype. Signiﬁcantly, high-throughput DNA sequencing allows

massively parallel quantitative analysis of multiple loci. Therefore,
this approach has the potential to provide quantitative insight into
allelic ratio changes at multiple loci for the simultaneous analysis
of, for example, multiple recessive Mendelian diseases.

In light of these, the above developments, we have undertaken
a statistical modeling of DNA sequencing and digital PCR in
the context of the non-invasive prenatal diagnosis of recessive
Mendelian disease in maternal cell-free DNA. The resulting data
provide valuable insight into experimental parameters and study
design for the enablement of these methods for future clinical
diagnosis.

2 METHODS AND RESULTS

Consider a recessive Mendelian disease in which the two possible alleles are
designated A and B and an affected individual will have the genotype BB.
The purpose of the prenatal diagnostic test is to determine whether the fetus
has genotype BB and, therefore, to determine whether it is affected by the
disease. Throughout this article, we assume that the maternal genotype is
known.

Suppose that a small percentage, say, P < 0.5, of the cell-free DNA from
maternal plasma originates from fetal tissue. The ratio of number of DNA
fragments carrying allele A to the number carrying allele B can only have
one of the following values.

When the maternal genotype is AA, we do not need to test the fetal
genotype, because it can only be AA or AB. When the maternal genotype
is BB, it is straightforward to test whether the fetal genotype is BB too: if
we can detect allele A from the maternal plasma, the fetal genotype must be
AB; otherwise, the fetal genotype is BB. The more challenging problem is
to determine the fetal genotype when the maternal genotype is AB. Clearly,
from the table above (Table 1), the fetus has the disease causing genotype BB
if and only if the ratio of allele A to B is less than or equal to (1 — p) / (1 + p),
and the fetus carries genotype AB or AA if and only if the ratio is greater than
or equal to 1. The principle behind our method is that we can test the null
hypothesis H0 that the ratio of allele A to allele B is greater than or equal
to 1, against the alternative hypothesis H1 that the ratio is equal to or less
than (1 — p)/(1 + p), by counting the allele frequency of A to B in the cell-
free DNA from maternal plasma. Note that there is a ‘gap’ of size 2p / (1 + p)
between the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis, and the gap is an
increasing function of p for 0 < p < 1. The size of this gap affects the power
of the test of H1 against H0.

Below we consider three different approaches to test the hypothesis H0
against H1, depending on three different ways to estimate the allele count
ratio of A to B. In all three approaches, we assume that the percentage of
the fetal DNA component of the total cell-free DNA in the maternal plasma
sample is known. This piece of information is critical to calculate the power
of the tests, which is essential for the tests to be used as diagnostic tools. We
described in another paper a sequencing-based highly accurate method of
estimating the percentage of fetal DNA in cell free maternal plasma sample
(Chu,T. et al., submitted for publication).

2.1 Sequencing without PCR (Seq)

Emerging technologies allow the direct sequencing of DNA substrate
libraries without any pre-ampliﬁcation (Harris et al., 2008), enabling direct
counting of the number of DNA fragments carrying alleles A and B,
respectively. Ignoring the bias and noise introduced by the sequencing
procedure, let XA and X3 be the counts of A and B in the sequenced library
respectively, then conditional on the sum N =XA +XB, the count XA of
allele A has a Binomial distribution with parameters (N ,q), where q is the
percentage of DNA fragments carrying allele A out of all DNA fragments
carrying either A or B. Clearly, we have q 2 0.5 if the hypothesis H0 is true
(that is, fetus has genotype AB or AA), and q=(1 — p) /2 if the hypothesis
H1 is true (that is, fetus has genotype BB). Fisher’s exact test and two-
proportion z-test can be used to test H0 against H1. In Table 2, we show the
total number of alleles A and B need to be sequenced for the Fisher’s exact
test of H0 against H1, at a signiﬁcance level of 5% to have a power of 95%.
(The high power is desirable because we are developing a diagnostics tool,
which requires high sensitivity.)

2.2 Sequencing with PCR (Seq-PCR)

Most contemporary sequencing technologies, such as Illumina (Bentley
et al., 2008) and ABI SOLiD (Ondov et al., 2008), require DNA substrate
libraries to be ampliﬁed by PCR before being sequenced. Let XA and X3 be
the counts of A and B in the sequenced library, respectively, conditional on
the sum N =XA +XB, the distribution of XA is no longer Binomial. However,
ignoring the bias of the PCR and the bias and noise introduced by the
sequencing procedure, based on the asymptotic results of the Sampling,
Ampliﬁcation, and Resampling (SAR) model (Chu, 2002) (See Appendix
in Supplementary Material), it can be shown that there is a parameter c 5 1
such that the distribution of the proportion of allele AXA /N is approximately
Normal with mean q and variance q(1 — q) / (cN ), where q is the percentage of
DNA fragments carrying allele A out of all DNA fragments carrying either
A or B in the original (pre-PCR) sample. It is interesting to note that the
mean and variance of X4 /N is the same as X ’/( cN ), where X ’ has a Binomial
distribution with parameters (cN, q). Therefore, we can use the approximate
proportion test to test the hypotheses about E [XA /N] as if cXA has a Binomial
distribution with parameters (cN, q).
The parameter c, called the SAR factor, is deﬁned as:

1_1+N 2
c_ M1+A

where 0 5 A 5 1 is the efﬁciency of PCR, which is deﬁned as, in each cycle
of PCR, for each DNA template the average number of new DNA templates
to be produced. The parameter M is the number of DNA fragments carrying

alleles A or B in the sample before PCR. The value of c can be estimated—
preferably conservatively—based on information about the PCR efﬁciency
as well as the number of copies of DNA fragments in the original (the value
of the efﬁciency should be between 0 and 1).

As mentioned above, after multiplying the allele count by c, we can use
the two-proportion z-test to test hypothesis H0 against H1 for the ratio of the
modiﬁed allele counts. Like in the case where the DNA sample is sequenced
without PCR, the parameter q 2 0.5 if the hypothesis H0 is true (that is, fetus
has genotype AB or AA), and q = (1 — p) / 2 if the hypothesis H1 is true (that
is, fetus has genotype BB).

It should be noted that, since c < 1, the variance of the proportion XA /N
for the tags sequenced from a sample ampliﬁed using PCR is higher than
if it were obtained from tags sequenced without ampliﬁcation. Thus, if we
use Seq-PCR method, more tags need to be sequenced to achieve the same
performance as the Seq method. Table 3 shows the number of sequenced tags
needed for the Seq-PCR method to achieve the same performance of the Seq
method without PCR. For example, in a sample containing 40 000 genomic
copies (equivalent to the 20 000 genome equivalents), with a PCR efﬁciency
of 0.5 and 20 000 tags from the Seq-PCR method, the performance of the
mutation test will be the same as using 12000 tags from the Seq without
PCR method (Table 3). Also, it is easy to see that cN < M. Therefore, even
if we can use Seq-PCR method to generate a large number of tags such that
N > > M, the performance of the Seq-PCR method still cannot exceed using
the Seq method to sequence all the M copies of DNA fragments in the origin
DNA sample.

2.3 Digital PCR (Dig-PCR)

An alternative method for estimating allele count ratio is digital PCR. Here
the sample is diluted into N wells so that some of the wells will contain
neither allele A nor allele B, and PCR is performed for each well to detect
the presence of either allele A or allele B. The counts of alleles A and B in
each well are independent and both follow the Poisson distribution. Let AA
and AB be the parameters of the Poisson distributions for alleles A and B,
respectively. Under the hypothesis H0, we have AA 2 AB, while under the
hypothesis H1, we have AA/AB 5 (1 — p) / (1 + p), where p is the percentage
of fetal DNA. To test H0 against H1, we note that the probability that allele
A is absent in a well is exp(—AA), and the probability that allele B is absent
in a well is exp(—AB), thus the number of wells where allele A is present has
a Binomial distribution with parameters (N, 1—exp(—AA)), the number of
wells where allele B is present has a Binomial distribution with parameters
(N, 1 — exp(—AB)). Then we can test H0 against H1 by testing if the proportion
of wells where allele A is present is the same as the proportion of the wells
where allele B is present. Assuming that about 25% of the wells contain
neither allele A nor allele B, we calculate a table (Table 4) for the number of
wells needed to test H0 against H1 with signiﬁcance level at 5% and power
95%. The column ‘Total copies of DNA’ gives the number of DNA fragments
carrying either allele A or allele B needed in the sample.

contemporary methods for quantitative analysis of DNA including
sequencing and digital PCR. The development of these statistical
methods is inspired by our interest in developing accurate non-
invasive diagnostic tests for fetal genetic disease. Our interest spans
a range of scenarios including common aneuploidy and simple
mutations that segregate in a Mendelian fashion. In this context,
it is likely that high—throughput DNA sequencing will be of great
utility because it affords the potential for multiplexed or massively
parallel quantitative analysis of multiple genetic loci. Also of interest
is the recently developed method of microﬂuidic digital PCR, which
has been successfully used for the detection of trisomy 21 via the
use of an mRNA-based placental biomarker. Our statistical methods
address each of these approaches with speciﬁc focus on the diagnosis
of recessive Mendelian disease.

Signiﬁcantly, our investigation of the digital PCR approach
reveals that many thousands of sequence-speciﬁc DNA target
molecules are required to be present before ampliﬁcation. Although
promising preliminary results relating to the diagnosis of mono genic
disease using digital PCR have recently been published by Lun et al.
(2008) this study utilized far fewer positive reaction wells than
would be recommended based upon our model (Lun et al.,
2008). It is possible therefore that the routine and reliable use
of this technique will require far higher numbers of end point
measurements for accurate allelic ratio determination in a clinical
context. Furthermore, our results may explain why allelic ratios in
plasma DNA samples containing <10% fetal DNA could not be
determined in this previous study. Signiﬁcantly, when examined
in the context of a previously published analysis of fetal and total
genome equivalents in maternal plasma (Chiu et al., 2001), our data
(Table 4) suggest that digital PCR probably performs at borderline
levels in terms of the optimal conditions required to detect a single
recessive mutation. Despite the obvious promise of the digital PCR
method, we have concern that it may be limited by its inability to
allow parallel ampliﬁcation of multiple target loci. This is largely
due to the fact that fetal genome equivalents are scarce in maternal
plasma, limiting the potential for running multiple assays. For
example, the parallel ampliﬁcation of multiple disease loci, such
as in a cystic ﬁbrosis [CFTR] mutation panel, and simultaneous
determination of fetal DNA frequency is likely to be challenging.

Based on the above limitations and the data we present in Tables 2
and 3, it is reasonable to postulate that DNA sequencing, with
its high throughput and inherent potential for massively parallel
analysis of multiple loci, is likely to provide a practical approach
for the non-invasive prenatal diagnosis of recessive Mendelian
disease. However, a dramatic increase in throughput and a reduction
in associated costs for such approaches are required before these
approaches can become routine standard of care.

It should be noted that our analyses are based on statistical
models of allele counts under the assumption that the experiments
are performed perfectly without the introduction of any bias and
extra noise. In practice, this assumption is always more or less
violated. In particular, the difference in the sequences between two
DNA fragments may lead to slightly different PCR efﬁciency and
noticeable difference in the number of copies generated from each
DNA fragments after many PCR cycles. Therefore, we suggest that
a large number of experiments should be performed to establish
empirically, after PCR, the ratio of the number of copies generated
from a DNA fragment carrying allele A, to the number of copies
generated from a DNA fragment carrying allele B. Call this ratio
the NB bias factor. We can drive a new allele count ratio table
corrected by this factor, and design statistic tests based on the new
table (Table 5).

Finally, we would like to point out that, while the focus of this
article is the diagnosis of recessive Mendelian diseases, the methods
discussed in this article can be easily applied to other the diagnosis of
other type of Mendelian diseases. For example, suppose a dominant
Mendelian disease is caused by the presence of allele A. When the
maternal genotype is AA, the fetus must be affected. When the
maternal genotype is BB, the fetus is affected if and only if allele
A can be detected from the maternal plasma. (Note that this is also
true for the diseases caused by de novo dominant mutation.) When
the maternal genotype is AB, the fetus carries the benign genotype
BB if and only if the ratio of allele A to B is less than or equal
to (1 — p) / (1 + p), the fetus has the disease causing genotype AB or
AA if and only if the ratio is greater than or equal to 1. Thus, we
can determine if the fetus is affected when the maternal genotype is
AB by testing the null hypothesis that the ratio of allele A to allele
B is less than or equal to (1—p)/(1+p), against the alternative
hypothesis that the ratio is greater than or equal to I. For diseases
caused by compound heterozygous mutations, our methods can be
used to determine the fetal genotype at all relevant loci. Of course,
when multiple tests are conducted simultaneously, we need to use
the Bonferroni correction to control the family-wise error rate.

In conclusion, we provide a statistical foundation for the
development of digital methods including PCR and DNA sequencing
for the non-invasive diagnosis of recessive Mendelian human
disease. The methods we provide should guide the future design

of studies in this realm and be considered when establishing proof
of concept for such methods.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Conserved patterns across a multiple sequence
alignment can be visualized by generating sequence logos.
Sequence logos show each column in the alignment as stacks
of symbo|(s) where the height of a stack is proportional to its
informational content, whereas the height of each symbol within
the stack is proportional to its frequency in the column. Sequence
logos use symbols of either nucleotide or amino acid alphabets.
However, certain regulatory signals in messenger RNA (mRNA) act
as combinations of codons. Yet no tool is available for visualization
of conserved codon patterns.

Results: We present the first application which allows visualization
of conserved regions in a multiple sequence alignment in the
context of codons. CodonLogo is based on WebLogo3 and uses
the same heuristics but treats codons as inseparable units of a
64-letter alphabet. CodonLogo can discriminate patterns of codon
conservation from patterns of nucleotide conservation that appear
indistinguishable in standard sequence logos.

Availability: The CodonLogo source code and its implementation
(in a local version of the Galaxy Browser) are available at http://
recode.ucc.ie/CodonLogo and through the Galaxy Tool Shed at
http://too|shed.g2.bx.psu.edu/.

1 INTRODUCTION

‘Sequence logos’ are simple graphical representations of conserved
elements in multiple sequence alignments. Sequence logos were
ﬁrst introduced by Tom Schneider and colleagues (Schneider and
Stephens, 1990). However, the popularity of sequence logos was
greatly boosted by the advent of WebLogo (Crooks et al., 2004),
which provides a web—based interface for sequence logo generation.
WebLogo allows the processing of multiple sequence alignments and
generates a logo where each column of the alignment is represented
by a stack of letters. The height of the entire stack is proportional
to its informational content (maximum—2 bits for nucleotides and
4.32 bits for amino acids), whereas the height of each symbol is
proportional to its frequency.

Sequence logos inspired development of several other tools that
use principles of Shannon’s information theory (Shannon, 1948)
for graphical Visualization of conserved biological elements. For

example, RNALogo (Chang et al., 2008) allows Visualization
of conservation of nucleotides in the context of secondary
RNA structures diagrams. CorreLogo (Bindewald et al., 2006)
generates 3D images that represent not only local conservation
of nucleotides but also mutual information, thus allowing for
Visualization of double—stranded regions in RNA structures, the
characteristic signature of which is compensatory mutations (Dixon
and Hillis, 1993). BLogo (Li et al., 2008) allows one to Visualize
both overrepresented and underrepresented symbols in multiple
alignments. Logopaint improves Visualization of patterns within
alignments of coding regions by removing distortion caused by
unequal evolutionary rates for synonymous and non—synonymous
substitutions (Schreiber and Brown, 2002). We have been able to
identify 13 different tools (data not shown), freely available through
the Web that are closely related to the idea behind sequence logos.
Despite the impressive fertility of sequence logos, we have not
been able to ﬁnd a single tool that enables Visualization of codon
patterns.

Codons have speciﬁc biological meaning during translation.
Codons are the units interacting with transfer RNAs (tRNAs)
during protein sequence decoding, and on numerous occasions the
meaning of synonymous codons is not the same. Synonymous
codon substitutions could have drastic effects on such phenomena
as programmed ribosomal frameshifting (Baranov et al., 2002;
Namy et al., 2004), and they also could affect speed (Tuller et al.,
2010) and accuracy of translation (Drummond and Wilke, 2008).
Moreover, altered combinations of codons could greatly affect the
overall efﬁciency of translation (Coleman et al., 2008). Therefore,
it is clear that the patterns of codons have biological signiﬁcance.
However, as we show, standard sequence logos are unable to
discriminate between conserved patterns of codons and conserved
patterns of nucleotides if the nucleotide composition of multiple
alignment columns is the same. To overcome the current limitations
of sequence logos, we have developed a new tool that we have
named CodonLogo.

2 ALGORITHM AND IMPLEMENTATION

CodonLogo is based on WebLogo3. The source code for WebLogo3
(http://WebLogo.threeplusone.com/) has been modiﬁed so that the
information content is determined across three consecutive columns
instead of a single column treating each codon as a member of
a 64—symbol alphabet. The information content of a particular
codon column in a multiple sequence alignment is determined
according to

Fig. 1. Performance of CodonLogo. (A) In this example, two different
multiple alignments are shown with the same nucleotide composition per
column. CodonLogo is capable of distinguishing between two different
situations that appear indistinguishable with WebLogo. (B) CodonLogo
output for an alignment of 857 insertion sequences from the IS407 family
requiring programmed ribosomal frameshifting for their expression (see
text). CodonLogo output was produced in three different frames as indicated.
The site of programmed ribosomal frameshifting is highlighted

where p,- is the relative frequency of the ith codon in the particular
column of the alignment. IC can be adjusted for background
compositional bias and small sample correction. Background
models can be provided as frequencies of codons and three (for
Homo sapiens, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli) are
distributed with CodonLogo. The source code of CodonLogo is
freely available at http://recode.ucc.ie/CodonLogo. CodonLogo also
can be used without the need for local installation through the Galaxy
browser interface (Blankenberg et al., 2010; Giardine et al., 2005;
Goecks et al., 2010) that is available through the above URL and
the Galaxy Tool Shed repository at http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/.
CodonLogo requires the CoreBio and NumPy libraries to run locally.

As input, CodonLogo accepts multiple alignments in a variety of
formats (nbrf, fasta, clustal, phylip, genbank, stockholm, msf, nexus
and table format). CodonLogo generates output images in either png,
eps, pdf or jpeg. While using CodonLogo, users can specify a reading
frame for separating nucleotide sequences on codons. It is possible
to limit generation of CodonLogo images to a particular subsection
of a multiple alignment.

3 PERFORMANCE

We illustrate the advantages of CodonLogo in comparison to
sequence logos in Figure 1. Figure 1A shows an artiﬁcial situation,
where two alignments are compared. Both alignments have the same
nucleotide composition and the same frequency of nucleotides per
column. However, in one alignment, codons are conserved (same
codons occur in the same column), while in the other alignment
codons appear only once in a column. Standard sequence logos
are identical for both alignments; however, CodonLogo is able to
discriminate between the two situations. Figure 1B illustrates a
real example, where the use of CodonLogo is beneﬁcial. In this
example, the CodonLogo output was generated for a subsection
(857 sequences) of a multiple alignment of insertion sequences
from the IS407 family containing a site of programmed ribosomal
frameshifting that differs among individual IS elements (Sharma
et al., 2011). As it can be seen in Figure 1B, CodonLogo successfully
captures conservation of the patterns. We found this program to be
useful in visualization of patterns responsible for recoding as those
identiﬁed in a recent study (Sharma et al., 2011).

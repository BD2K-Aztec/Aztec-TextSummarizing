ABSTRACT

SUMMARY: The evolutionary analysis of presence and absence
profiles (phyletic patterns) is widely used in biology. It is assumed
that the observed phyletic pattern is the result of gain and loss
dynamics along a phylogenetic tree. Examples of characters that
are represented by phyletic patterns include restriction sites, gene
families, introns and indels, to name a few. Here, we present a
user-friendly web server that accurately infers branch-specific and
site-specific gain and loss events. The novel inference methodology
is based on a stochastic mapping approach utilizing models that
reliably capture the underlying evolutionary processes. A variety of
features are available including the ability to analyze the data with
various evolutionary models, to infer gain and loss events using either
stochastic mapping or maximum parsimony, and to estimate gain
and loss rates for each character analyzed.

1 INTRODUCTION

Numerous biological characteristics are coded using binary
characters to denote presence (‘1’) versus absence (‘0’). The 0/1
matrix is termed a phylogenetic proﬁle of presence—absence or
phyletic pattern and is equivalent to a gap—free multiple sequence
alignment (MSA), in which rows correspond to species and columns
correspond to binary characters. Phyletic pattern representation
is useful in the analysis of various types of biological data
including restriction sites (Felsenstein, 1992; Nei and Tajima, 1985;
Templeton, 1983); indels (Belinky et al., 2010; Simmons and
Ochoterena, 2000); introns (Carmel et al., 2007; Csuros, 2006); gene
families (Cohen et al., 2008; Hao and Golding, 2004; Mirkin et al.,
2003) and morphological characters (Ronquist, 2004). Interestingly,
even questions in ﬁelds other than biology can be addressed by
this approach. For example, the evolution of human languages was
studied by analyzing the phyletic patterns of lexical units (Gray and
Atkinson, 2003).

Following the development of realistic probabilistic models
describing the evolution of DNA and protein sequences, the
analysis of phyletic patterns data has progressed from the traditional
parsimony (Mirkin et al., 2003) to models, in which the dynamics
of gain (0—> 1) and loss (1 —> 0) is assumed to follow a continuous—
time Markov process (Csuros, 2006; Hao and Golding, 2006;
Spencer and Sangaralingam, 2009). Probabilistic—based analysis of

phyletic patterns is currently available in programs such as RESTML
(Felsenstein, 1992), MrBayes (Ronquist and Huelsenbeck, 2003)
and Count (Csuros, 2010). Nevertheless, for the inference of
branch—site—speciﬁc events the parsimony criterion is still the most
commonly used methodology.

However, the parsimony paradigm may be misleading
(Felsenstein, 1978; P01 and Siddall, 2001; Swofford et al.,
2001; Yang, 1996), especially in characters experiencing multiple
(recurrent) events along longer branches (Suzuki and Nei, 2001).
Towards a more accurate inference of gain/loss events, we have
recently integrated stochastic mapping approaches (Minin and
Suchard, 2008; Nielsen, 2002) to accurately map gain and loss
events onto each branch of a phylogenetic tree. The analysis is
based on novel mixture models, in which variability in both the gain
and loss rates is allowed among gene families (Cohen and Pupko,
2010). We have shown that our mixture models are robust and
accurate for the inference of gene family evolutionary dynamics
(Cohen and Pupko, 2010).

Here, we developed the user—friendly Gain and Loss Mapping
Engine (GLOOME) web server. The main novelties of our web
server are: (i) we implement probabilistic models that are not
implemented elsewhere, which better capture gain/loss dynamics;
(ii) we provide accurate estimates of the expectations and
probabilities of both gain and loss events using stochastic mapping;
and (iii) the interface via a user—friendly web server should make 0/ 1
analyses more accessible compared to other stand—alone programs.

2 AVAILABLE FEATURES AND METHODS

The required input is a phyletic pattern provided as a 0/1 MSA. A
phylogenetic tree is either provided as input by the user or estimated
from the phyletic pattern.

2.1 Evolutionary model

The available probabilistic models range from simple to more
sophisticated ones that may capture the gain and loss dynamics
more reliably. For details regarding the models, see Cohen and
Pupko (2010). There are three options for gain and loss rates: (i)
‘Equal gain and loss’—the probability of a gain event is assumed
to be equal to that of a loss event; (ii) ‘Fixed gain/loss ratio’—
gain and loss probabilities may be different but the gain/loss ratio
is identical across all characters and (iii) ‘Variable gain/loss ratio
(mixture)’—gain/loss ratio varies among characters.

Simple models assume that a single evolutionary rate
characterizes all characters. Our models further allow for character
rate variation, assuming that the rate is either gamma distributed or
gamma distributed with an additional invariant rate category.

Fig. 1. Stochastic mapping inference of gain events. The size of the bar
below each character indicates the sum of expected gain events over all
branches. Each character in the phyletic pattern is color coded according to
the probability of a gain event in this character and within the branch leading
to this species (presentation is also available for loss events). (Insert) Tree
with branch lengths proportional to the total number of gain and loss events.

In stationary processes, the character frequencies are equal across
the entire tree. Since this assumption may not hold in certain
evolutionary scenarios (Cohen et al., 2008), we provide the option
‘Allow the root frequencies to differ from the stationary ones’ to
analyze the data using non—stationary models.

A column of only ‘0’s (the character is absent in all taxa) is usually
not observable in phyletic patterns. Maximum—likelihood analyses
must be corrected for such unobservable data. We allow several such
corrections under the menu ‘Correction for un—observable data’.

2.2 Stochastic mapping

The stochastic mapping approach infers for each branch and each
character the probability and expected number of both gain and loss
events. These probabilities depend on the evolutionary model, the
tree and its associated branch lengths. This mapping is provided both
textually and visually (Fig. 1).

2.3 Parsimony

Our server allows the inference of gain and loss events under the
parsimony criterion. The relative costs of gain and loss events can
be modiﬁed by the user.

2.4 Additional features

In addition to the inference of gain and loss events we further
provide: (i) the posterior estimation of the relative rate of each
character; (ii) a separate estimation of the gain and loss rates for
each character, for mixture model only; (iii) the log—likelihood of
the entire tree and for each character; and (iv) the tree and its
associated branch lengths estimated from the phyletic pattern, where
tree topology is reconstructed using the neighbor—joining method
(Saitou and Nei, 1987), from pair—wise maximum—likelihood (ML)
distances. For the ML computation, we assume that the rate of gain
(loss) is proportional to the frequency of 1 (0) in the data.

While the server is designed with a novice user in mind,
we provide several advanced options for expert users, available

under the ‘Advanced’ menu. For example, running times can
be accelerated by changing the optimization level. Additionally,
likelihood estimation of parameters can be avoided by setting their
values based on character counts directly from the phyletic pattern.
There are also several options to correct for missing data (explained
in the web server under OVERVIEW—>METHODOLOGY).

ABSTRACT

Summary: Promiscuity counts allow for a better understanding of
a compound’s assay activity profile and drug potential. Although
PubChem contains a vast amount of compound and assay data,
it currently does not have a convenient or efficient method to obtain
in-depth promiscuity counts for compounds. PubChem promiscuity
fills this gap. It is a Java servlet that uses NCBI Entrez (eUtils) web
services to interact with PubChem and provide promiscuity counts in
a variety of categories along with compound descriptors, including
PAINS-based functional group detection.

1 INTRODUCTION

A better understanding of a compound’s drug potential can be
obtained by determining a compound’s selectivity for protein targets
and how many and what type of assays a compound is active or
tested in. Compound promiscuity data are essential to fully exploit
the therapeutic potential and minimize the toxic effects of drug
candidates (Frye, 2010; Li et al., 2010; Rix, 2009; Xie, 2009).
Promiscuous compounds are also traditionally problematic in high—
throughput screening (HTS) and it is helpful to identify them early
in the HTS process (Schﬁrer et al., 2011). Gathering compound
promiscuity data can help determine if the compound’s activity
may be affected by a particular assay technology, detection method
or interaction with biological targets (Schiirer et al., 2011). There
are additional positive uses for the identiﬁcation of promiscuous
compounds. For instance, ﬁnding chemical promiscuity across a
family of proteins could provide chemical starting points for targets
within that family that lack chemical probes.

PubChem is a public repository of substance information,
compound structures and BioActiVity data for HTS campaigns.
The majority of the data points come from the Molecular
Libraries Screening Center Network (MLSCN) under the NIH
Molecular Libraries Program (MLP) (Austin, 2004; Li et al.,
2010). MLP screening campaigns use the Molecular Libraries Small
Molecule Repository (MLSMR), which is a collection of over
300 000 compounds (http://mli.nih.gov/mli/compound-repository/).
This results in data that is highly amenable for assessing
compound promiscuity. PubChem is a valuable resource for studying

the promiscuity of compounds (Li et al., 2010). PubChem is
integrated with Entrez (NCBI’s primary search engine) and also has
BioActiVity Services (http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.g0V/assay) that
provide simple promiscuity counts for compounds including active
and tested protein and BioAssay counts.

Here, we present a tool that gathers promiscuity counts
and compound descriptors for multiple compounds. Results are
displayed in a formatted web table for easy interpretation. Although
PubChem has extensible search and data management features, to
manually obtain the results that the tool provides a user would
need to Visit ﬁve BioActiVity Services web pages and complete
nine Entrez queries (see Section 2). Each Entrez query requires
determining the appropriate search terms and extracting the data
from those searches. In comparison, this tool runs queries in batches
and provides results in only a few seconds per compound.

2 METHODS

The promiscuity analysis gathers promiscuity counts and chemical
descriptors for PubChem compounds or substances. Assay and protein
counts are, respectively, hyperlinked to PubChem BioActiVity DataTable
and Summary results so that the associated assays, proteins and data can
be Viewed. Sorting and ﬁltering are possible and useful to ﬁnd and then
disregard sparsely tested compounds.

The input to the tool is a list of PubChem compound or substance
identiﬁers (CIDs or SIDS). Various PubChem BioAssay, Compound or
Substance queries are then performed using NCBI Entrez Utilities (eUtils)
eLink, eSearch and eSummary web services (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
entrez/query/static/esoap_help.html). Cross-links between databases are
speciﬁed (http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.g0V/corehtml/query/static/entrezlinks
.html) as are controlled vocabulary ﬁelds and operators (http://www.ncbi
.nlm.nih.g0V/books/NBK3837/#EntrezHelp.Entrez_Searching_Options)
and (http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/help.html#PubChem_index).

There are two output formats: overall promiscuity counts for each
compound (per compound) or individual counts per protein target (per
compound and protein). The tool provides all the following data:

Assay counts: are active and total counts for PubChem BioAssays that a
compound is tested in. A compound is active in an assay if the compound’s
PubChem activity outcome (speciﬁed by the depositor) is assigned active.
Assay counts are found using the link names pccompound_pcassay and
pccompound_pcassay_active. MLP and ChEMBL (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/
chembldb/index.php) assay counts are provided separately and found
using the search term and ﬁeld combinations ‘NIH Molecular Libraries
Program’ [SourceCategory] and ‘ChEMBL’[SourceName] (see Section 4).

Project counts: a ‘project’ is a set of assays that are PubChem XRef assays
to a summary assay. A compound is active in a ‘project’ if it is active in one or
more XRef assays that contain only protein targets that are also targets in the
summary assay. A compound is not active in a ‘project’ if it is active in one or

more XRef assays that have protein targets differing from the targets in the
summary assay. The search terms and ﬁelds used to ﬁnd ‘project’ counts are
‘summary’ [ActivityOutcomeMethod]. All projects and MLP project counts
are provided.

Protein target counts: protein target counts are a compound’s activity
against all the protein targets it has been tested against. A compound is
considered active against a protein if the compound is active in at least one
assay where the protein is one of the targets of the assay. Protein targets are
retrieved from the assay’s Entrez eSummary. Assays with no protein target
(e.g. cytotoxicity assays) are also provided.

Luciferase, ,B-Zactamase and ﬂuorescence assay counts: luciferase assays
have designs based on the ‘luciferase-induced conversion of luciferin
substrates that result in the emission of light’ (Fan and Wood, 2007; Schiirer
et al., 2011). Most ,B-Iactamase assays ‘use ﬂuorescence resonance energy
transfer (FRET) substrates, resulting in a ﬂuorescence shift upon hydrolysis
of the beta-lactam’ (Schiirer et al., 2011; Zlokarnik et al., 1998). These assays
are found by looking for keywords in the BioAssay protocol and description
(e.g. ‘luciferase’[AssayProtocol] OR ‘luciferase’[AssayDescription]).

Compound descriptors: ‘Rule of 5’ (Lipinski et al., 2001) Violation count,
smiles and a full set of chemical descriptors available from eUtils eSummary
are provided. Chemical descriptor columns are hidden in the web table
output.

Functional group detection: SMARTS patterns for pan assay interference
compounds (PAINS) (Baell and Holloway, 2010) that are frequent hitters in
high-throughput screens were obtained from http://blog.rguha.net/?p=850.
These are compared against each compound and detected groups are ﬂagged
(see Section 3).

3 IMPLEMENTATION

This tool was developed as a Java (http://www.0racle.com/
technetwork/java/index.html) servlet utilizing the previously
published PubChemDB Java API (Southern and Grifﬁn, 2010)
for eUtils functions. J OELib (http://s0urcef0rge.net/pr0jects/joelibl)
was used for SMARTS querying of functional groups. SmartClient
(http://www.smartclient.com/product/smartclientjsp) was used to
display the output web table.

4 DISCUSSION

PubChem promiscuity extracts promiscuity counts and compound
descriptors from PubChem, and example results of known
promiscuous compounds are available on the tool’s website. This
data can give a picture of a compound’s selectivity and drug
potential. The promiscuity counts are not easily accessible in
PubChem itself, especially if desired for several compounds at
once. The resultant data are accessible in a convenient and
relatively quick fashion that is based on the restrictions of using
NCBI eUtils web services (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/
query/static/eutils_help.html). Design considerations and limitations
are addressed below:

Project counts eliminate artiﬁcial inﬂation of assay counts where
a compound is tested multiple times within one screening campaign.
With the deﬁnition of ‘active project’ used for this tool, it is possible

that probes of a project may not be counted as active if that
compound is active in an assay that is part of the project and has a
target that is not in the ‘PubChem Summary AID’.

Protein counts can show if a compound is protein selective, and
assays with no-protein targets can typically point out cytotoxic
compounds. If a compound is speciﬁed as active in a ‘PubChem
Panel Assay’, it is not possible with NCBI Entrez to determine
which individual panels and therefore targets the compound is
active against. PubChem promiscuity will return the result that the
compound is active against all the targets in the panel assay, but this
may not be true.

Assay reporter technologies that are commonly used include
luciferase, ,B-lactamase and ﬂuorescence. If a compound is active
in many or all assays that use the same assay reporter technology
and across protein targets, this could mean that the compound is
interfering with the assay technology. PubChem does not have an
annotation for these types of assays and therefore the counts are
dependent on the keywords and ﬁelds used in the search.

MLP and ChEMBL are two common sources of assays in
PubChem. MLP assays are large-scale screening assays, and
ChEMBL assays are mostly single points curated from the scientiﬁc
literature. Also, ChEMBL data may not specify compounds as active
or inactive. MLP and ChEMBL assay counts are given separately
because of the contrast in the data they provide.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Phylogenetic profiling methods can achieve good
accuracy in predicting protein—protein interactions, especially in
prokaryotes. Recent studies have shown that the choice of reference
taxa (RT) is critical for accurate prediction, but with more than
2500 fully sequenced taxa publicly available, identifying the most-
informative RT is becoming increasingly difficult. Previous studies
on the selection of RT have provided guidelines for manual taxon
selection, and for eliminating closely related taxa. However, no
general strategy for automatic selection of RT is currently available.
Results: We present three novel methods for automating the
selection of RT, using machine learning based on known protein—
protein interaction networks. One of these methods in particular,
Wee-Based Search, yields greatly improved prediction accuracies.
We further show that different methods for constituting phylogenetic
profiles often require very different RT sets to support high prediction
accuracy.

1 INTRODUCTION

With the advent of next-generation technologies, genomic data are
now appearing at a rate that renders manual annotation and analysis
of genome sequences infeasible, thus motivating the development
of automated computational methods. Prediction of protein—protein
interactions (PPIs) is a key problem in systems biology, and methods
based on e. g. interactions between protein domains (Ng et al. , 2003),
gene-fusion events (Enright et al., 1999) and phylogenetic proﬁling
(Gaasterland et al., 1998; Pellegrini et al., 1999) (PP) support
genome-scale inference at low computational cost. The application
of PP in PPI prediction is based on the hypothesis that gene products
which function together are likely to exhibit a common pattern
of occurrence across taxa. The phylogenetic proﬁle of a gene or
gene product represents its pattern of presence and absence across
a set of taxa, and thus similarity between proﬁles can be used as
an indicator of functional linkages. PPI prediction using PP has

proven to be fairly accurate in prokaryotes but has been much less
successful in eukaryotes, a situation attributed to the modularity
of eukaryotic proteins, large-scale evolutionary trends including
secondary endosymbioses and parasitism and the limited diversity
of sequenced genomes (Jothi et al., 2007; Ruano-Rubio et al., 2009;
Snitkin et al., 2006).

Many studies identify the choice of reference taxa (RT) as critical
for accurate prediction and suggest that accuracy can be improved
by matching the RT to the interaction network under investigation.
Representatives of all three domains of life (bacteria, archaea and
eukaryotes) should be used for highly conserved networks, whereas
close relatives are best suited for predicting more specialized
functions. Furthermore, inclusion of too many closely related taxa,
and taxa with derivative or biased gene complements, can diminish
the prediction accuracy (Herman et al., 2011; Jothi et al., 2007;
Karimpour—Fard et al., 2007; Singh et al., 2008; Snitkin et al.,
2006; Sun et al. , 2005, 2007). Balancing these considerations greatly
complicates manual RT selection, thus motivating the development
of automatic selection approaches.

Here we introduce three novel machine-learning methods for
selection of informative RT based on known PPI networks. We
compare the accuracy with which PPIs in one prokaryote and
three eukaryotes are predicted with the resulting taxon sets, and
demonstrate that one of the methods in particular, T ree-Based
Search (TBS), supports highly accurate predictions. Four different
PP methods are used in the PPI prediction experiments, and we
show that no single taxon set achieves top accuracy with all PP
methods. Finally, we show that taxon sets can be optimized using
PPI networks from other taxa without substantially affecting the
prediction accuracy.

2 DATA
2.1 Phylogenetic proﬁles

Our set of RT consists of all fully sequenced species in UniProt
(Bairoch et al., 2005) version 22. This set contains 52 eukaryotes, 859
bacteria and 69 archaea, including multiple strains of some species.
We downloaded the complete set of protein sequences from UniProt,
including plasmids, and used these to create real-valued phylogenetic proﬁles
containing E -Values from pairwise BLAST searches. For binary proﬁles, we
used an E-Value threshold of 10—7.

Jothi et al. (2007) investigated the prediction of metabolic pathways in
Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae using PP and a series of
manually selected reference-taxon sets. In their experiments, the taxon set
BAE3a, containing 60 taxa from all three domains, supported the best average

prediction accuracy in both query taxa. We compiled a taxon set which
closely resembles BAE3a (ﬁve strains unavailable in Uniprot were replaced
by closely related strains) to enable a comparison with a manual taxa selection
approach.

2.2 Phylogenetic trees

We created a multifurcating phylogenetic tree (T) over all 980 RT using the
taxonomic common tree tool from the NCBI webpage (http://www.ncbi.nlm
.nih.gov/Taxonomy/CommonTree/wwwcmt.cgi). In T, taxa with multiple
strains in RT are represented as internal nodes, whereas all other taxa are
represented as leaf nodes. A second tree Thin, based on T, was constructed as
follows. Each taxon in RT represented as an internal node in T was replaced
with an artiﬁcial node and then reinserted as a leaf at a random position under
the artiﬁcial node. For each set of sibling leaf nodes S,- with parent pi, where
|S,-| > 2 a new binary tree with room for |S,-| leaves was constructed and used
to replace the subtree rooted at p,- in T. The nodes in S,- were then inserted as
leaves at random positions in this binary tree. In the resulting tree Thin, all taxa
in RT are thus represented as leaves and have at most one sibling (Fig. 1).
Thin allows a more ﬁnely grained selection of RT compared with T when
used in combination with the Tree Level Filtering (TLF) and TBS methods
presented in Section 3.3, due to an increased number of hierarchical levels.

2.3 PPI networks

High conﬁdence PPI networks were created for each of E. coli, S. cerevisiae,
Drosophila melanogaster and Arabidopsis thaliana using the STRING
database (Jensen et al., 2009; von Mering et al., 2005) version 8.3 (Table 1).
These networks were created by ﬁltering for binding proteins supported by
experimental data, curated databases or both. Only interactions where at least
one of these evidence channels has a conﬁdence score 20.9 (the highest
conﬁdence in STRING) were used. The interactions include both proteins
that interact physically and proteins that are part of the same protein complex
but without direct contact.

For each of the four networks, we created a dataset containing all PPIs
in the network, and twice as many non-interacting protein pairs. These were
generated following Ben-Hur et al. (2006) by randomly pairing proteins
and discarding pairs for which STRING contains evidence of interaction
at any conﬁdence level excluding evidence originating from PP methods

(the co-occurrence evidence channel). Exclusion of PPIs that are supported
only by co-occurrence—based methods would lead to an overestimate of
the prediction accuracy of PP methods, and thus such pairs are regarded
as negatives. Results of experiments with datasets containing different
positive—negative ratios (see Section 3 of the Supplementary Material)
indicate that the use of a ratio higher than 1:2 will not affect prediction
accuracies signiﬁcantly.

3 METHODS

3.1 Prediction accuracy measure

We use the area under curve (AUC) as a measure of prediction accuracy,
which enables the accuracy of different combinations of PP methods,
optimization methods and PPI networks to be compared in a clear way but
ROC curves for key results can be found in Section 4.4 of the Supplementary
Material. Given a list of protein pairs ranked by interaction conﬁdence, the
AUC was computed using the Gini coefﬁcient:
1 n
AUC= 5 [kn —Xk_1)<Yk +Yk_1)), <1)
k=1

where X is the false positive rate and Y the true positive rate at pair k in the
ranked list.

Tenfold cross-validation experiments are used to evaluate the performance
of different taxa selection approaches as follows. Each dataset was divided
into 10 random subsets of equal size and each subset was then used to evaluate
a taxon set which had been optimized on the remaining nine subsets. Paired
t-tests for key cross-validation experiments are provided in Section 4.5 of
the Supplementary Material.

3.2 Phylogenetic proﬁling methods

The original PP method by Pellegrini et al. (1999) (referred to as
the Pellegrini method) employs the Hamming distance between binary
phylogenetic proﬁles to cluster similar proﬁles. Instead of clustering proﬁles,
the Hamming distance between proﬁle pairs can be used as a conﬁdence
score for interactions between the corresponding proteins, thus allowing the
ranking of a list of protein pairs. The Pellegrini method considers two proﬁle
pairs with the same Hamming distance as equally signiﬁcant evidence of
interactions. This is problematic as, in an extreme case, all matching entries in
one proﬁle pair could contain ones while they contain zeroes in the other pair.
To ensure that the Pellegrini method infers only interactions between proteins
where there is signiﬁcant evidence of correlated evolution, proﬁle pairs for
which the number of matches (Number of matching entries containing ‘1’)
falls below the threshold |BP| -0.1 are assigned a distance of |BP| where
|BP| is the length of the binary proﬁles. This threshold yielded the highest
accuracy in preliminary experiments.

Date et al. (2003) use mutual information between pairs of real-valued
proﬁles as a conﬁdence score, where a high score is taken as evidence of
correlated evolution (referred to as the Mutual Information method). We
calculated mutual information values as described in Date et al. (2003), and
use these values to rank protein pairs.

Wu et al. (2003) calculate conﬁdence scores for interactions between
protein pairs using binary proﬁles and the hypergeometric distribution
(referred to as the Hypergeometric Distribution method). The expected
number of matches between two proﬁles is described with a hypergeometric
distribution, assuming no interaction and uniform distribution of matches.
The conﬁdence score is then computed as the P-value for the number of
matches between two proﬁles being as large as the number of matches under
the hypergeometric distribution. This method was further developed ﬁrst
by Kharchenko et al. (2006), who adjusted for the size of each reference
genome, and later by Cokus et al. (2007), who showed how phylogenetic
relationships among RT could be taken into account. For this method we
adopt the linear coefﬁcient from Cokus et al. (2007) to combine P-Values.
The conﬁdence scores computed by both the hypergeometric distribution

and Runs Informed methods are used to rank a list of protein pairs in our
experiments.

3.3 Reference-taxon set optimization methods

Selecting the set of RT that leads to the best prediction accuracy can be
formulated as an optimization problem. Given a set of RT, the objective is to
identify the subset of taxa which optimizes a score function S(RT’ ,P,P’ ,F).
Here RTl is a subset of RT, P is a set of putative interacting proteins,
and P’ is a subset of P containing true interacting protein pairs (e.g. a PPI
network). F is a PP-based method which assigns conﬁdence scores to protein
pairs in P using phylogenetic proﬁles computed using the taxa in RT’. The
score function ranks protein pairs in P according to their conﬁdence score
and computes the corresponding AUC as described in Section 3.1. RTl is
represented as a binary vector of length |RT|, where each entry corresponds
to a reference-taxon and contains ‘1 ’ if the taxon is in RT/ and ‘0’ otherwise.
As there are 2'RT' different combinations of RT, it is infeasible to identify
an optimal RTl using exhaustive search, and hence heuristic methods must
be used.

3.3.] Tree-level ﬁltering The method of Sun et al. (2007), referred to here
as the TLF method, ﬁlters out closely related taxa from a reference-taxon set.
A phylogenetic tree with hierarchical levels (Fig. 2) is used for the selection
of taxon sets of different sizes as follows. For each level l, a set of clades
C1 is constructed by ﬁrst placing the leaves of each subtree rooted at level l
in the same clade, and then placing all remaining leaves in their own unique
clade. Given some l, one of three different ﬁlters is applied to select a single
taxon from each clade deﬁned at level l. The exterior and outlier ﬁlters select
a random taxon positioned at the highest and lowest level in each clade in
C], respectively, and the random ﬁlter selects at random a taxon from each
clade in C]. We applied all three ﬁlters to each level in Thin, and the taxon
set which gave rise to the highest score was taken as the best. If T is used
instead of Thin, taxa positioned as sibling leaf nodes can be selected in only
one of three ways by the TLF method. (i) None of them is selected. (ii) One
of them is selected. (iii) All of them are selected. Thin allows such nodes to
be selected in more ways as each leaf has a maximum of one sibling.

3.3.2 Iterative taxon selection In the Iterative taxon selection (ITS)
method, the binary vector RTl is ﬁrst initialized with random values and
scored. The entries in RTl are then reversed in random order, and after
each change the resulting set of taxa RT” is scored. If S(RT”,P,P’,F) >
S(RT’,P,P’,F), RT’ is replaced by RT”. The optimization terminates if
changing all entries in RTl once does not improve the score; otherwise
another iteration of the search heuristic is performed.

3.3.3 Genetic algorithm Genetic algorithms (GA) (Holland, 1975) are
a family of search heuristics applicable to binary parameter vectors.
The genetic algorithm used in this work maintains a population of n
parameter vectors (initialized with random values) and iteratively applies
recombination, mutation and selection steps to create successive generations

of parameter vectors. The recombination step randomly pairs parameter
vectors in the population, and applies uniform crossover (Syswerda, 1989)
on each pair with a probability of 0.6. The uniform crossover strategy
swaps each pair of parameters in two vectors with a probability of 0.4. The
mutation step introduces random mutations in parameter vectors by inserting
random values in each vector element with a probability of 0.001. After the
recombination and mutation steps, the score of each vector is computed
and a new population of size n is created from the old population in the
selection step, using binary tournament selection (Goldberg, 1990; Goldberg
et al., 1991). This selection scheme iteratively selects two random parameter
vectors from the previous population, and stores the best-scoring vector in
the new population (note that each vector can be selected multiple times).
Our selection scheme also uses elitist selection, where the best-scoring vector
is always included in the new population.

We also investigated two other recombination strategies that take
phylogenetic relationships of RT into account, but as the accuracy and rate of
convergence achieved using these strategies were similar to those of uniform
crossover, they were not included in the experiments. Details on these
recombination strategies can be found in Section 1 of the Supplementary
Material.

3.3.4 TBS Similar to TLF (above), the TBS method uses a phylogenetic
tree with hierarchical levels (Fig. 2) to guide the search for an informative
reference-taxon set (see Section 2 of the Supplementary Material for
pseudocode). This takes place in three steps: ﬁrst, RT’ is initialized with
all reference taxa (RTl =RT), and scored. A new set of taxa, RT”, is then
constructed by copying RT/ and removing all taxa rooted at some inner
node v e T. If RT” results in a better score than RTl , the pair (v, As) [where
As=S(RT’,P,P’,F)—S(RT”,P,P’,F)] is stored in a set M, and RT/ is
replaced by RT”. The hierarchical levels in Thin are used to deﬁne the order
in which nodes are Visited as follows: at each level, a node v is Visited if v
is an inner node and no ancestor of v is found in M. Nodes are Visited in
random order at each level, starting at level 0 and progressing to the highest
level in the tree. This ﬁrst step works as a crude ﬁlter that quickly excludes
many taxa from RT/ .

In the second step, a more ﬁne-grained ﬁlter is applied to the taxa rooted
at v, where (v, As) EM. The pairs in M are ordered by their As values and
removed in ascending order, i.e. the nodes which gave rise to the smallest
improvements in the score are removed ﬁrst. For each removed pair, the
children of v are Visited in random order and for each child c, RT” is
constructed as a copy of RT/ where entries corresponding to taxa rooted
at c are negated. Next, As is computed and if As > 0, RT/ is set to RT”. For
any value of As, M is updated by inserting the pair (c, |As|). Experiments
showed that exclusion of subsets of taxa rooted at a node v [where (v, As) 6 M
and As is small] improves the score more often than does exclusion of taxa
rooted at nodes where As is large. Intuitively, a set of taxa rooted at a node
with a small As is more likely to contain both informative and uninformative
taxa that cancel each other out, where removing uninformative taxa improves
the score.

In the third step, all remaining taxa in RTl are excluded one by one. If an
exclusion results in a better score, that taxon stays excluded; otherwise it is
again included in RT’ .

As with the TLF method, the use of Thin in the ﬁrst and second steps
allows taxa represented as sibling nodes in T to be selected in more ways.
However, because of the ﬁne-grained selection performed by third step, the
difference between using T and Thin is often negligible with this method.

4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

4.1 Cross-validation experiments

Four PPI datasets (Section 2.3) were used to evaluate the 10-fold
cross-validation prediction accuracy (AUC) of the different RT
selection methods using the PP methods described in Section 3.2.

Because of space limitations we present only the results for the
E. coli and D. melanogaster PPI networks here, whereas the results
for S. cerevisiae and A. thaliana are presented in Section 4.3 of
the Supplementary Material. T bin was used where applicable, as
preliminary experiments indicated that this tree supported the best
overall prediction accuracy for TLF and TBS.

The four optimization methods described in Section 3.3 were
employed to create sets of taxa for each PP method, with the
exception of the Runs Informed method. As both ITS and GA require
the score function to be evaluated many times where |RTl | is large,
it is infeasible to use them in combination with Runs Informed, as
it runs in O(|RT’ l4) time. In all experiments, the GA method used
a population size of 32 and 5000 generations to optimize reference-
taxon sets; this was sufﬁcient to ﬁnd (local) maxima for all PP
methods in our experiments.

The results of cross-validation experiments for E. coli and
D. melanogaster are shown in Figures 3 and 4, respectively.
All optimization methods were able to identify reference-taxon
sets which improved the prediction accuracy compared with both
the complete set of 980 taxa and the BAE3a set. However, the
increase in prediction accuracy differs considerably among the four
PP methods. The Pellegrini and Runs Informed methods show a
signiﬁcant improvement in AUC for both query taxa, whereas the
AUC of the Mutual Information method was improved only slightly.
The improvement in prediction accuracy for the hypergeometric
distribution method is small for the three eukaryotes, whereas a large
improvement can be observed on the E. coli datasets. As shown in
Table 2, the hypergeometric distribution method requires a large
number of RT to make accurate predictions, hence with only 52
eukaryotes available as RT it is difﬁcult to improve the accuracy of
this method for an eukaryotic query taxon. The standard variations in
Figure 3 are larger compared with the results for the three eukaryotes
which can be explained by the relatively small size of the E. coli
network.

Interestingly, when used with optimized reference-taxon sets the
cross-validation results show that the Pellegrini method achieves
prediction accuracies equal to or better than the more recent PP
methods we investigated. Predictions with the Pellegrini (and Runs
Informed) method have a tendency to result in either low or high
AUCs depending on the reference-taxon set used. Thus, it seems that
the correct choice of RT is of particular importance for the Pellegrini
method.

Reference-taxon sets optimized using ITS generally lead to higher
AUCs than those optimized with TLF. A notable exception is the
results for the Pellegrini method with D. melanogaster where ITS
apparently gets caught in a local maximum, leading to an AUC
similar to that of the complete taxon set. The granularity by which the
TLF method can select RT is limited by the number of hierarchical
levels in the phylogenetic tree (25 in T bin). Consequently, the simple
ITS method is often able to outperform TLF as it can select taxa with
a much ﬁner granularity. TBS achieves the best overall prediction
accuracy, followed closely by our GA. Compared to ITS, GA and
TBS sample a larger part of the search space and are therefore
less prone to getting caught in a poor local maximum. Paired
t-tests (see Section 4.5 of the Supplementary Material) conﬁrms
that TBS achieves signiﬁcantly higher AUCs compared with other
optimization methods in most cases and as TBS require considerably
less evaluations of S than GA, it is the preferred method for
selecting RT.

In many cases, the BAE3a taxon set resulted in lower AUCs
compared with the complete taxon set. This indicates that the greater
number of fully sequenced genomes now available has helped to
increase prediction accuracy and it is therefore unfair to compare the
AUCs from BAE3a directly with those achieved by optimizing on
the complete taxon set. Furthermore, BAE3a is aimed at predicting
metabolic pathways and may therefore not contain an appropriate
composition of taxa for predicting the proteins in our datasets. But
as BAE3a was selected speciﬁcally for PPI prediction in E. coli
and S. cerevisiae, where it showed a good average performance
on different metabolic pathways, BAE3a is expected to be more
informative regarding interactions in these query taxa compared
with the full taxon set. The cross-validation results for E. coli and
S. cerevisiae do not indicate that this is the case, thus illustrating the
difﬁculty of selecting informative RT manually.

4.2 Composition of RT

Table 2 presents the distribution of taxa over the tree kingdoms
of life in taxon sets optimized using TBS. The distribution of taxa
in sets optimized for S. cerevisiae and A. thaliana can be found
in Section 4.1 of the Supplementary Material. It is obvious that
different PP methods require very different conﬁgurations of RT
to achieve top prediction accuracy. Both the Pellegrini and Runs
Informed methods perform well on relatively small taxon sets
composed mostly of taxa that represent the same domain as the query

taxon. Conversely, the Mutual Information and Hypergeometric
Distribution methods achieve top accuracies with large taxon sets
in which prokaryotes predominate. In the case of E. coli, the
best taxon set found for the Runs Informed method is relatively
large compared with taxon sets found for the three eukaryotes.
We therefore speculate that the low prediction accuracy of the
Run Informed method with E. coli could be attributed to a poorly
optimized reference-taxon set.

4.3 Cross-taxon prediction

Figures 5 and 6 present the results of cross-taxon PPI prediction
experiments (See Section 4.3 of the Supplementary Material for
additional results). In these experiments, taxon sets were optimized
using TBS with the full dataset for each of the four PPI networks.
The resulting reference-taxon sets were then used for PPI prediction
in S. cerevisiae and D. melanogaster to investigate if optimized
taxon sets can be applied across species. For each PP method, we
show the result of a self-test, i.e. where training and prediction were
carried out using the same dataset. As the AUCs of the self-tests are
similar to the average AUCs in the 10—fold validation experiments,
overﬁtting does not appear to be a major concern, and the self-test
AUCs can therefore be used as benchmarks.

In both Figure 5 and 6, the taxon sets optimized for E. coli lead to
low prediction accuracies when used for prediction in eukaryotes.
This is unsurprising, considering the large phylogenetic distance
between the three eukaryotes used here and E. coli. Although the
three eukaryotes are not closely related either, the results in Figure 6
indicate that optimized taxon sets can be shared between these. In

particular, the AUC for the Pellegrini or Runs Informed methods
show a signiﬁcant increase when both optimization and prediction
was performed with an eukaryote. In one experiment where the Runs
Informed method was used to predict PPIs in S. cerevisiae with a
taxon set optimised for D. melanogaster, the prediction accuracy did
not improve compared to using the full taxon set (see Section 4.3
of the Supplementary Material). An explanation for this observation
could be that the relatively small size of the D. melanogaster PPI
network. When a taxon set is optimized using a small network, the
evolutionary history of taxa in the resulting set cannot be expected
to encompass other interactions than those present in the network,
and thus the taxon set will be more-specialized than a set optimized
using a larger network. As large high-quality networks are currently
available for only a few eukaryotes, cross-taxon optimization seems
to be a useful approach for increasing the accuracy of PPI prediction.
The results in Table 3 support this as a taxon set optimized with the
large A. thaliana network results in high prediction accuracies when
used for PPI prediction in S. cerevisiae and D. melanogaster.

The number of taxa shared between each pair of taxon sets
used in the cross-taxon experiments is shown in Table 4 (see
Section 4.2 of the Supplementary Material for additional results).
Taxon sets optimized for E. coli have a small or non-existent overlap
with those optimized for the three eukaryotes, and result in a low
prediction accuracy in eukaryotes (Fig. 5). However, there is no
clear relationship between the size or extent of intersections and
the prediction accuracy in three eukaryotes. The Pellegrini method
achieves a high AUC when predicting PPI in S. cerevisiae using
the taxon set optimized for A. thaliana although only 20% of the
taxa in this set are found in the set optimized for S. cerevisiae.

CV = average AUCs of 10-fold cross-validation. CT = AUCs of cross-taxon experi-
ments, where the reference-taxon set was optimized with A. thaliana PPI data.

Conversely, when the taxon set optimized for D. melanogaster is
used in combination with the Runs Informed method to predict PPIs
in S. cerevisiae, the result is a low AUC despite a much-larger
overlap of 40%. Studies (Jothi et al., 2007; Singh et al., 2008)
indicate that some taxa can be substituted or even omitted from
a reference-taxon set without signiﬁcantly degrading the prediction
accuracy, whereas other taxa cannot. Accordingly, two taxon sets
with a small overlap can support similar AUCs as long as informative
taxa are present in both sets and less-informative taxa, e.g. with
low-quality annotation, are left out.

4.4 Cross-method prediction

Studies of the effect of reference-taxon selection on the prediction
accuracy of PP methods typically focus on a single method (Jothi
et al., 2007; Karimpour—Fard et al., 2007; Singh et al., 2008;
Sun et al., 2005, 2007). Our results demonstrate that the optimal
composition of RT depends not only on the query taxon but also
on the PP method used. Figures 7 and 8 show the cross-method
prediction results where taxon sets were optimized with TBS for
each of the four PP methods, and then used for PPI prediction with
each of the four PP methods (see Section 4.3 of the Supplementary
Material for additional results). In cases where taxon sets are
optimized for one PP method and then used for prediction with
another method, the prediction accuracy drops signiﬁcantly. From
these results, it is evident that PP methods are not interchangeable
with regard to a given taxon set which further complicates the
selection of RT, as selection must target a speciﬁc PP method.

factors such as phylogenetic relationships among RT and quality
of annotation. Guidelines such as those presented by J othi et al.
(2007) represent an improvement over use of all possible RT, but as
the optimal composition of RT depends on not only query taxon but
also PP method, manual selection of RT is an unpromising direction,
particularly as more genomes are sequenced.

Previous studies have concluded that the prediction accuracy of PP
methods in eukaryotes is generally poor compared with the results
achieved in prokaryotes (J othi et al., 2007; Kharchenko et al., 2006;
Ruano-Rubio et al. , 2009; Snitkin et al., 2006). Insufﬁcient numbers

Taxa selection for phylogenetic profiling

 

(e. g. endosymbioses), genome reduction in parasites, mismatch
between breadth of the reference-taxon set and the network under
investigation, and quality of annotation were put forward as possible
causes of lower prediction accuracy. Here we have shown that with
a correct selection of taxon sets, PPI prediction can be as accurate
for eukaryotes as for E. coli. However, the results in Herman et al.
(2011) indicate that co-complexed proteins are easier to predict with
co-occurrence—based methods compared with transient interactions.
Thus, the increase in prediction accuracy which can be achieved with
the presented taxon set optimization methods may vary depending
on the type of query interactions and the quality of available
training data.

5 CONCLUSIONS

We have introduced three new methods for automatic selection of RT
for PP which can be used in combination with existing PP methods.
Our results show that the choice of RT can have a substantial effect
on the accuracy of PPI prediction, and that a single reference-
taxon set does not guarantee good prediction accuracy with all
PP methods. Taxon sets optimized with TBS achieved consistently
high prediction accuracies compared with those attained Via the
previously published TLF method or with a manually composed
reference-taxon set. Furthermore, our experiments showed that the
original Pellegrini et al. PP method often supported higher prediction
accuracies compared with more recent alternatives when optimized
taxon sets were used.

As complete genome sequences appear at an ever-increasing
frequency, manual selection of informative RT becomes increasingly
difﬁcult. Here we have shown that informative sets of RT can be
selected in an objective, fast and scalable manner for eukaryotes as
well as prokaryotes. Our approach utilizes a known PPI network to
select informative RT and we have demonstrated that where a high-
quality network is unavailable for the query taxon, an informative
taxon set can be constructed using a network from another taxon.
As discussed by Jothi et al. (2007), the evolutionary history of the
RT must correspond with that of the query PPI to achieve high
prediction accuracy. Thus, PPI prediction accuracies could likely be
improved even more by optimizing taxon sets on networks enriched
in proteins homologous (or better, orthologous) to those in the set of
query interactions. For example, a network enriched in membrane
proteins might be used to create a reference-taxon set for predicting
novel PPIs among membrane proteins.

We anticipate that in-depth examination of the composition of
optimized taxon sets could lead to further improvements in taxon-
selection strategies, and in the accuracy of PP methods for PPI
prediction.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: While protein secondary structure is well understood,
representing the repetitive nature of tertiary packing in proteins
remains difficult. We have developed a construct called the relative
packing group (RPG) that applies the clique concept from graph
theory as a natural basis for defining the packing motifs in proteins.
An RPG is defined as a clique of residues, where every member
contacts all others as determined by the Delaunay tessellation.
Geometrically similar RPGs define a regular element of tertiary
structure or tertiary motif (TerMo). This intuitive construct provides
a simple approach to characterize general repetitive elements of
tertiary structure.

Results: A dataset of over 4 million tetrahedral RPGs was clustered
using different criteria to characterize the various aspects of regular
tertiary structure in TerMos. Grouping this data within the SCOP
classification levels of Family, Superfamily, Fold, Class and PDB
showed that similar packing is shared across different folds.
Classification of RPGs based on residue sequence locality reveals
topological preferences according to protein sizes and secondary
structure. We find that larger proteins favor RPGs with three
local residues packed against a non-local residue. Classifying by
secondary structure, helices prefer mostly local residues, sheets
favor at least two local residues, while turns and coil populate with
more local residues. To depict these TerMos, we have developed
2 complementary and intuitive representations: (i) Dirichlet process
mixture density estimation of the torsion angle distributions and
(ii) kernel density estimation of the Cartesian coordinate distribution.
The TerMo library and representations software are available upon

1 INTRODUCTION

The existence of common secondary structure motifs in proteins, as
initially proposed by Pauling and Corey (1951a, b), is well known,
and application of these backbone sequence preferences has proven
successful in protein structure design (Kuhlman et al., 2003) and
prediction (Bradley et al., 2005). As the packing of side—chains

has been shown to be broadly regular and tetrahedral (Bagci et al.,
2003), characterizing the recurring elements that make up protein
tertiary structure would improve approaches to protein design and
the reﬁnement of predictive models toward their native structure.
Our work investigates repetitive units of tertiary structure using
an intuitive analysis of tetrahedral packing. Using an approach
combining graph theory and the Delaunay tessellation (Delaunay,
1934), we can classify recurring patterns of side—chain packing that
clearly describe motifs of tertiary structure.

Initial studies of protein tertiary structure (Kozitsyn and Ptitsyn,
1975; Nandi et al., 1993; Rustici and Lesk, 1994) were limited
by the size of the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (Dutta et al.,
2009). Currently, tertiary analyses are applied to improve structural
alignment accuracy (Artymiuk et al., 1994; Berger, 1995; Berger and
Singh, 1997; Dudev and Lim, 2007; Huan et al., 2004; Liu et al.,
2009; Nebel et al., 2007; Ortiz et al., 2002; Roach et al., 2005; Shi
et al., 2007; Sun et al., 1997), while classiﬁcation of tertiary structure
motifs has focused on side—chain packing within a fold family
(Bandyopadhyay et al., 2009a, b; Bradley et al., 2002; Holmes and
Tsai, 2005; Huan et al., 2005; Selvaraj and Gromiha, 2003). For
example, Tropsha and co—workers (Bandyopadhyay et al., 2009a, b;
Huan et al., 2005) used the Delaunay tessellation (Delaunay, 1934)
and subgraph mining to identify tertiary packing motifs common
to members of individual protein families, but no comparison
of side—chain geometries were made. Comparison of the family
subgraphs found no motifs in common between families. A number
of studies have tried to identify tertiary motifs across protein fold
families (Heringa and Argos, 1991; Kannan and Vishveshwara,
1999; Kleywegt, 1999; Nandi et al., 1993; Russell, 1998). Using an
agglomerative clustering scheme, Heringa and Argos (1991) found
clusters that involved large side—chains and tended to be on the
surface of the protein. Limiting their search for conserved clusters
to immunoglobulins and globins showed that aligned clusters were
generally at aligned positions. Side—chain packing motifs have also
been used to characterize binding or active sites (B agley and Altman,
1995; Gregory et al., 1993; Gunasekaran et al., 2004; Pidcock and
Moore, 2001; Russell, 1998; Russell et al., 1998; Shamim et al.,
2007; Spriggs et al., 2003). Here, we are interested in the tertiary
packing that deﬁnes a protein’s global structure and build on these
studies of tertiary structure to develop a new approach to classify
the regular packing motifs across the PDB (Dutta et al., 2009).

Contact deﬁnitions based on radial distance cutoffs are ambiguous
near their cutoff (see Section 2). The Delaunay tessellation
(Delaunay, 1934) or its dual the (Voronoi polyhedra Voronoi, 1908)
avoids this ambiguity by ﬁnding pairs of atoms satisfying an empty

sphere criterion: if a sphere is drawn with the two atoms representing
the endpoints of its diameter, no other atoms will fall within that
sphere. Previously, our group applied this method to analyze tertiary
structure in terms of pairwise contacts within the globin fold family
and showed that ~85% of the globin sequences fall into the volume
delineated by these tertiary contacts (Holmes and Tsai, 2005).
This result strongly suggested that further investigation using the
Delaunay tessellation had the potential to characterize the regular
elements of protein tertiary structure.

In this article, we have developed a simple construct to describe
tertiary motifs: the TerMo. A TerMo is a clustered group of relative
packing groups (RPGs). An RPG is a set of side—chain residues that
are all in contact with each other when the Delaunay tessellation
is used for contact identiﬁcation. Analysis was performed on all
tetrahedral RPGs from all folds in the PDB (Dutta et al., 2009).
Geometric comparisons are made at the SCOP deﬁned levels of
Family, Superfamily, Fold and Class (Murzin et al., 1995), before
comparing across the entire PDB. We also ﬁnd clear correlations
between relative sequence positions of residues and the types
of secondary structure being packed. Finally, we apply statistical
modeling to the TerMos that produces a simpliﬁed descriptions of
tertiary packing based on torsion angles and Cartesian coordinates,
which are similar in spirit to the Ramachandran plot’s description
of protein secondary structure (Ramachandran et al., 1963).

2 METHODS

2.1 Construct deﬁnitions

We deﬁne a tertiary motif (TerMo) as a set of clustered relative packing
groups (RPG). A relative packing group is a set of residues that all are
in contact with each other, i.e. a clique in the contact graph. The contact
graph was deﬁned by performing a Delaunay tessellation (Delaunay, 1934)
on all non—bonded, protein heavy atoms and connecting residues (nodes)
that had at least one atom in contact (Fig. 81). In addition to side—chain
to side—chain contacts, we included main—chain to main—chain contacts for
all non—neighboring residues and side—chain to main—chain contacts for all
residues. RPGs were deﬁned using the maximal clique detection method
of Bron and Kerbosch 1973). We found RPGs for all 15 273 domains in
the ASTRAL SCOP 1.73 set of structures ﬁltered at 95% sequence identity
(Chandonia et al., 2004) to permit comparisons of RPGs at the Domain
and Family levels of SCOP. Also, the analysis considers the inﬂuence of
redundancy added by such a high sequence cutoff. We focus our analysis on
the tetrahedral RPGs deﬁned by four residues. From our protein domain set,
there are a total of 4 113 191 tetrahedral RPGs.

2.2 Tertiary motif: clustering of RPGs

We deﬁned TerMos by clustering the RPGs described above using RMSD
as a distance metric. RPGs were grouped and labeled based on the number
of residues falling into helical (H), extended sheet (E), turn (T) and coil
(C), where H is all helical DSSP deﬁned residues (h, g, i), E includes sheets
with their bulges (e, b), T are all turns (t, s), and C is everything else. Thus,
an RPG with one residue from each DSSP class would be [H1 E1 T1 C1],
whereas an all helical RPG would be labeled [H4 — — —]. These secondary
structure groups were the subjects of a complete hierarchical clustering
based on the minimum root mean square distance (RMSD) between their
oz—carbons and their side—chain centers of mass for all possible permutations
of residue ordering. In a complete clustering, RPGs (or an RPG cluster) are
added to growing clusters if the maximum RMSD between that RPG and
any member of the growing cluster is the current minimum in the all vs. all
RMSD matrix. This procedure yields a tree structure that can be pruned at an
arbitrary RMSD cutoff. To produce the TerMos, we pruned our tree at 1.5 A

RMSD and 2.0 A RMSD. These cutoffs were chosen based on the distribution
of RMSD’s for RPGs from different proteins that are completely aligned
in a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) using MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004;
Fig. 82). After an initial clustering within each sequence family, the member
of each cluster with the lowest average RMSD to all others in the cluster and
clustering of these representatives was repeated to identify TerMos at the
SCOP (Murzin et 01., 1995) deﬁned levels superfamily, fold, class and PDB
levels. A 2.0A RMSD cutoff was required for clustering at the class and
PDB levels. Clustering with a 2.0 A RMSD cutoff does not always preserve
side—chain orientations (Fig. S3). However, a post hoc division of the cluster
based on these subpopulations preserved common side—chain orientations.

Random TerMos were created to conﬁrm that the observed clusters were
meaningful. For each TerMo with at least 100 members, 1000 sets of
randomly selected RPGs wer generated. Each of these randomly generated
TerMos had the same number of members as the selected real TerMo. The
radius of gyration and solvent accessible surface area were calculated for the
real and random TerMos. The probability that a real TerMo could be formed
at random was quantiﬁed by calculating the percentile of random TerMos
with values as far or farther from the mean as the real TerMo.

2.3 Modeling tertiary motifs

2.3.1 Torsion angles To calculate joint densities for angle pairs, we use
a Dirichlet process mixture of bivariate von Mises distributions developed
previously (Lennox et al., 2009). For a set of angle pairs (go), 10,-), i = 1,  ,n,
we consider the model:

($13wiﬂﬂiaVia9i~p((¢iawi)lﬂiavi9i) (1)
(MiaviaQiNGNG (2)
G~DP(tH1H2) (3)

where DP(tG0) is a Dirichlet process with mass parameter ‘E and centering
distribution H1H2. The distributions p and H1 are bivariate von Mises sine
models (Singh et al., 2002), which are deﬁned as:

 

10((915a WNW v, S?) = CeXp{a} (4)
where a=1c1 cos(¢—u)+/czcos(w— v)+ksin(¢ —u)sin(w— v) with
_1_ 2 x 2m A2 m
C —471  (4mm) Im(K1)Im(K2) (5)
and
_ K1 —)\.
$2 _ |:—)\. K2] (6)

and where [m (x) is the modiﬁed Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind of order m.
The distribution H2 is a 2—dimensional Wishart distribution with parameters
050 and ﬁg, and mean ao/(2ﬁo). Note that the deﬁnition of the angle pairs
as (go), 10,-) is arbitrary, and these distributions are equally valid for the pairs
($13 X1,i) and (101‘, X1,i)~

For all distributions of interest, we ﬁt the aforementioned model using the
sampling scheme described in Lennox et al. (2009). For H1, we used prior
parameters u0 2 U0 2 0, and 52 was a diagonal matrix with elements 1/1802.
For H2, we took 050 = 2 and ﬁg was a 2 x 2 diagonal matrix with elements
equal to 400. For each model ﬁt, we ran two independent chains for 11000
iterations with the initial 1000 iterations discarded as burn in. Using 1—in—
20 thinning gave 1000 total samples. We evaluated each distribution on a
360 x 360 grid of points for plotting.

2.3.2 Centroid-Ca cartesian coordinates The side—Chain centroid
positions within a TerMo and the Cat positions, as Cartesian coordinates,
lend themselves to a kernel density estimation approach. Let our data
consist of a set {cl-EL] of n RPGs, where each observation c,- consists of
the coordinates for the atoms from a clique of size m from the i—th RPG.
That is Cl‘j = (xij, yl-j, Zij) for j = 1, . . . , m. We propose to model the distribution

3 RESULTS

3.1 RPG clustering to tertiary motifs

The results of clustering the RPGs to TerMos with a 2.0 A RMSD
cutoff across the SCOP categories (Murzin et al., 1995) are given
in Figure 1 and Supplementary Table Sl. Our analysis shows that
clustering is not random. We calculated the average and sample
standard deviations of radius of gyration and solvent accessible
surface area for all TerMos and for random sets of RPGs of the same
size as the true TerMos. We then calculated the percentiles of the true
TerMo statistics relative to the distribution for random RPG clusters.
If the clustering were random, the random and real TerMos would
have the same values and the distribution of these percentiles would
be uniform. As shown in Supplementary Figure S4, the distribution
is not uniform, indicating that the clustering is not random.
Clustering within the Family level results in a 5— to 50—fold
reduction in the number of tertiary motifs (TerMos). TerMo classes

with more residues in regular helical and/or sheet secondary
structure cluster better than TerMo classes with more irregular
coil secondary structure, indicating more ordered packing. The
Superfamin level has a smaller decrease in clustering. Many
Superfamilies contain only one family, so no further clustering is
observed in these cases. This is also true at the Fold level, where
there are 10 to 100 times fewer clusters of classiﬁcation than there are
starting RPGs. The next major reduction in the number of clusters
occurs at the Class level. Here, 1086 folds are placed in one of
seven classes based primarily on their secondary structure, though
small proteins, disordered proteins, and membrane proteins have
their own classes. This 100—fold reduction in SCOP classiﬁcations
results in an approximately 7—fold reduction in clusters, indicating
that TerMos are relatively dissimilar in different folds. The ﬁnal
level of clustering compares representative structural motifs from
different classes and yields another 2.5—fold reduction in the number
of clusters. Overall, this agglomerative clustering scheme yields
~200 clusters per TerMo secondary structure type, with oc—helical
and B—sheet TerMo classes clustering signiﬁcantly more consistently
than TerMos involving residues from turns and loops. From this
ﬁnal clustering, histograms of TerMo populations along with radii
of gyration and solvent accessible surface area are shown in
Supplementary Figure S5 Of the over 4 million RPGs, <2% cluster
in low populations of under 100 members, while the remaining 98%
are 100 members of larger (Supplementary Fig. SSA). These well—
populated TerMos display a smaller radius of gyration and solvent
exposure with tighter distributions than the low populated TerMos
(Supplementary Figs 85B and 85C, respectively).

The number of different TerMos in a protein domain depends on
the size of the domain. On average, the average number of TerMos
per residue is 0.27, and 95% of domains have fewer than 0.5 TerMos
per residue. The set of TerMos that are common to all domains of
a Family, Superfamily, or Fold can be used to distinguish between
different Families, Superfamilies, or Folds. We compared the sets
of TerMos that were present in at least 90% of the structures in all
Families, Superfamilies and Folds with at least 40 members. This
resulted in 1404 pairs of Families, 3740 pairs of Superfamilies and
2911 pairs of Folds. There was one pair of Families in this set with
identical TerMos (SCOP classes: b.1.1.2 and b.1.1.4) and one pair of
Families that share more than 80% of their TerMos (SCOP classes:
0.1.8.1 and 0.1.8.3). All Fold and Superfamin conserved TerMo sets
are unique.

Comparing all the TerMo secondary structure classes individually
provides the ﬁner details of regular tertiary structure and is
summarized in Table Sl. To be clear in our discussion of TerMos,
we will use a consistent notation, because the packing interactions
are deﬁned relative to each residue. Residues that are neighbors or
near neighbors in the primary sequence will be referenced against
an initial residue i, while non—local contacts will use j, k, & l. The all
sheet [— E4 — —], helix contacting sheet [H1 E3 — —], and all helix [H4
— — —] TerMos ( Fig. 2A, B and C, respectively) produce the largest
clusters with over 100 000 representatives within 2.0A RMSD of
the representative RPG when clustering is carried across the full
PDB. The largest [— E4 — —] TerMo describes the packing of three
consecutive residues of one strand i, i+1, i+2 packing against one
residue on the neighboring strand j (Fig. 2A). This TerMo involves
side—chain to side—chain contacts between residues i, i+2, and j, as
well as side—chain to main—chain contacts to residue i+1, and does not
distinguish between parallel and anti—parallel strands. Similarly, the

largest TerMo involving only helical residues describes the packing
of one helix against another (Fig. 2C). This TerMo involves three
residues from consecutive turns of one helix (i, i+1, i+4) packing
with one residue from another helix (j) and is entirely deﬁned
by side—chain to side—chain contacts. The most populated TerMo
in helix—sheet packing involves one residue from a helix packing
against three residues from two strands of a sheet [H1 E3 — —], and
as with the helix—helix packing motif described above, is entirely
deﬁned by side—chain to side—chain contacts (Fig. 2A and B). As
an example of RPGs clustering from unaligned positions, Fig. 2B
depicts 2 [H1 E3 — —] RPGs from topologically distinct protein folds.

TerMos involving turns and loops are more difﬁcult to describe
in terms of sequence separation. In regular secondary structure (i.e.
oc—helices and B—sheets) the orientations of consecutive residues are
strongly correlated, whereas in turns and loops the orientations of
consecutive residues are not correlated. Thus, in motifs involving
turns and loops, consecutive residues in different RPGs do not
necessarily align with each other. As an example, Figure 2D shows
two loop RPGs from different loops in one immunoglobulin light
chain structure. Both loops cluster in the largest all loop (I- - - C4])
motif found in the immunoglobulin light chain structure. One of the
RPGs is formed by three consecutive residues (i, i+1, i+2) from one
loop packed against a residue (1') in another loop whereas the other
loop is formed by three non—consecutive residues (i, i+3, i+4) in one
loop packed against a residue (1') in a second loop. When the RPGs
are aligned (Fig. 2D, inset), residue j from the ﬁrst RPG aligns with
residue i from the other, and the remaining residues i, i+1, and i+2
in the ﬁrst RPG align with residues i+3, i+4 and j, respectively, in
the other.

 

3.2 Dependency on sequence separation

As introduced by Singh and coworkers (Singh et al., 1996),
tetrahedral RPGs can be grouped into ﬁve classes based on the
sequence locality of their contacts (Table 1). We consider residues in
an RPG to be locally consecutive in sequence if they are separated
by three or fewer positions. The average number of RPGs in each
of these locality groups is a linear function of the protein’s length as
shown in Figure 3A. The slopes fall into two groups. The 1+1+1+1
(all non—local), 2+2 and 4 (all local) classes exhibit shallow slopes
of 0.28, 0.25 and 0.21, respectively. The steeper slopes of 0.75
and 0.69 for the 3+1 and 1+2+1 classes, respectively, indicate that

RPGs having a given sequence locality on the number of residues in a protein.
Errors bars represent one standard deviation. The lines are linear ﬁts to the
data with the following equations: 1+1+1+1 y = 0.28*x — 14, R2 = 0.992;
1+2+1 y = 0.69*x—27, R2 = 0.991; 3+1 y =0.75*x—20, R2 = 0.999; 2+2

of RPGs with different sequence locality as a function of secondary structural
class. The helix, extended, turn, and coil classes represent RPGs in which a
majority of the residues (3 or 4) are in the given secondary structure. The
mixed class represents RPGs in which no secondary structure type dominates.
Sequence localities are illustrated in the inset box and described in the text.
Circles connected by lines represent residues that are close in sequence and
unconnected circles represent residues that are not close in sequence.

larger proteins’ local contacts increase at a faster pace than non—local
contacts. The rate at which a protein folds has been shown to be
correlated with its contact order, a measure of the sequence locality
of contacts (Plaxco et al., 1998), and these results corroborate the
observation that larger proteins decrease in contact order.

By collapsing these secondary structure TerMos into their
dominant classes of helix, extended, turn, coil and mixed (Fig. 3B),
we discover some simple propensities favored by helices and sheets.
More detail is provided by Supplementary Fig. S6, which shows the
populations of each of the ﬁve types in Table 1 binned by the number
of secondary structure types in the TerMo. Packing between and
within helices favor RPGs with no local contacts (1+1+1+1 class),
three local residues (3+1 class) and all local residues (4 class). In all
helical residues [H4 — — —], the 1+1+1+1 TerMos do not generally
indicate that four separate helices are interacting, but rather that

four residues in separate turns from two helices pack against each
other. The 3+1 TerMos of [H4 — — —] indicate packing of two helices
against each other, where two locally packed residues from one
helical turn pick up one local residue from the next turn and pack
against a residue from another helix. Somewhat similar trends are
shown for helical residues interacting with other types of secondary
structure (Fig. S6). We ﬁnd that these all non—local TerMos are most
favored by two helical residues from consecutive turns packing with
at least one sheet residue. The 3+1 class is dominated by the packing
of three helical residues to any of the other secondary structure
conformations ([H3 E1 — —], [H3 — T1 —], or [H3 — — C1]). In helices,
the all local 4 class is always 2 or 3 helical residues with either turn
or coil that are towards the ends of a helix and again exposed to
solvent.

In direct complement to helical packing, extended sheets favor
classes involving two local residues: 2+2 and 1+2+1 (Fig. 3B).
The all sheet TerMos [— E4 — —] favor the 2+2 class, but not the
1+2+1 class. As detailed in Supplementary Figure S6, The 1+2+1
conﬁguration is dominated by 3 sheet residues packing against a
helix [H1 E3 — —], where the sheet residues consist of 2 local residues
from 1 strand with the third coming from a neighboring strand.
The 2+2 is primarily favored by 2 or more sheet residues packing
with either coil or turn (no helix residues are favored). In contrast,
secondary structure classes favored in the 1+2+1 arrangement
involve at least one sheet residue with one helix residue packing
against turn or coil, which includes the [H1 E3 — —] discussed above.
A similar propensity is seen in the 1+1+1+1 all non—local class
with the exception that [H1 E3 — —] does not favor this packing
arrangement.

In general, turns and coils disfavor all non—local interactions
1+1+1+1. As expected, contacts in turns are dominated by the all
local 4 interactions (Fig. 3B). Indeed, TerMos with four consecutive
residues are found only in turns and TerMos with 2 or more turn
residues display the highest frequencies in the all local 4 arrangement
(see Supplementary Fig. S6). Similarly, packing between coil
elements tends to involve relatively long stretches of local residues,
though it is more likely to include one or more non—local residue.
Coil has the highest frequency in 3+1 arrangement. This is due to
favored contributions from all the predominantly coil classes and is
also characteristic of any secondary structure TerMo that involves
coil. The ‘mixed’ category includes situations where two residues or
fewer from a secondary structure class pack against other secondary
structure classes and shows no strong preferences for any type of
primary structure arrangement. Our more detailed explanation of
the previous classes encompassed many of the speciﬁc instances
included in this category.

3.3 Representing TerMos

In a similar fashion that the planar backbone helped produce
insightful predictions (Pauling and Corey, 1951a,b) and useful
representations (Ramachandran et al., 1963) of secondary structure,
any reduced representation of protein packing needs to allow an
intuitive interpretation of tertiary structure without sacriﬁcing the
higher order, 3D nature of interactions. The RPG and its grouping
into a TerMo allows simpler representations that retain the 3D
network of tertiary interactions. To produce a simpler representation,
we split the characterization of a TerMo into angular data and
Cartesian data. For both, we provide clearer interpretation of the

data by modeling continuous distributions of the data in Figure 4.
We chose to model a well—populated [H1 E3 — —] TerMo as it
demonstrated the general trends found between local and non—local
residues.

The angular data provides a representation of the conformational
preferences for different TerMos and can be expressed in terms of
the torsion angles (xl, x2, ...) of their constitutive side chains. In
order to relate backbone and side—chain conformational preferences,
these X angles can be related to the backbone q), 1p angles through
Ramachandran—like plots (Ramachandran et al., 1963). Estimating
the density of the q), xl torsion angle pairs (Lennox et al., 2009)
produces the plots shown in Figure 4A for the helix—sheet ([H1
E3 — —]) TerMo shown in Figure 2A. This modeling should not be
mistaken as individual plots of simple rotamer preferences,but all 4
plots in Figure 4A should be considered together as a description of

tertiary structure. The 4 shown distributions correlate the rotamer
preferences for the speciﬁc [H1 E3 — —] residues with each other and
to their backbone conformations.

Because the angular data describes only residue conformations,
a complete description of a TerMo also requires information about
the positional relationship between the residues. We approximate
the residues in a TerMo by considering the positions of the 4 side—
chain centroids and 4 backbone Coz’s. In this case, we have used a
kernel density estimation to model the Cartesian space sampled by
the TerMo (see Section 2) and the result is shown by Figure 4B.
The modeling of the positional data has many advantages that can
be seen by comparing Figure 2A with Figure 4B. The overlay of
residues in Figure 2A provides a basic view of the TerMo residues,
but the ﬁner features of the data is obscured. The density in Figure 4B
deﬁnes the orientation of the packing between the residues and their
backbones in the TerMo and provides a clear depiction of the volume
distribution occupied by the TerMo residues. The results illustrates
that the 2 local residues vary much less (smaller volumes) than the
2 residues that are non—local in the TerMo (larger volumes).

4 DISCUSSION

Our goal in developing the RPG analysis of protein packing and
the tertiary motif (TerMo) library of RPG clusters was to produce a
construct that provided useful insight and an intuitive representation
of the regular tetrahedral elements of protein tertiary structure. This
is in contrast to sequence—structure motif ﬁnding algorithms, such
as I—SITES (Bystroff and Baker, 1998) and TRILOGY (Bradley
et al., 2002), which look for structurally similar motifs with well
deﬁned sequence patterns primarily within a sequence contiguous
secondary/super—secondary structure class or within a maximal
contact pattern in protein fold families, respectively. While these
methods have been successful in describing speciﬁc motifs, we
are looking for more general relationships in, for example, how
helices pack with sheets. We also draw a distinction between our
work and that of Russell and coworkers (Russell, 1998; Russell
et al., 1998) and others who have found regular motifs in protein
active sites. Solvent accessible surface area calculations indicate that
some TerMos are preferentially found on the surface of proteins,
but we do not correlate any of our TerMos with speciﬁc active
sites. The TerMo classiﬁcation based on sequence locality provides
a simple yet general vocabulary to discuss and compare repetitive
tertiary structure between proteins of similar or different folds. In
the following sections, we discuss the general implications of our
ﬁndings within the context of current views of protein structure
and lastly provide a speciﬁc example where our two representations
provide a characterization of the tertiary propensities of a TerMo.

4.1 Contact Order, packing and protein size

Protein folding is generally thought of in terms of a funnel, where
each unit of structure formed has to gain enough contact energy
to overcome the conformational entropy lost in ordering that unit
(Bryngelson et al., 1995). This is why proteins with high contact
order fold more slowly than those with low contact order (Plaxco
et al., 1998). In high contact order proteins, long sections of chain
must become ordered to form a unit of tertiary structure, leading to a
greater loss of entropy and requiring a larger gain in contact energy
to balance that loss. The residues in an RPG have maximized their

Tetrahedral packing motifs in protein tertiary structure

 

contacts with the other residues; they all form contacts with all other
members of the RPG RPGs thus maximize their ability to overcome
conformational entropy loss, making them natural packing units.

The distribution of RPGs having different sequence locality (e. g.
all local 4, all non—local 1+1+1+1, and the three mixed local—non—
local groups) suggests a limit on the possible packing topologies
available to proteins. In a naive random model, we would expect
that the number of RPGs in each locality class would increase at the
same rate with increasing protein size. As the protein size increases,
however, the relative number of mixed local and non—local (i.e. 3+1,
1+2+1) RPGs increases (Fig. 3A). For every local RPG that is added,
one 1+1+1+1, one 2+2, three 1+2+1 and three 3+1 RPGs will be
added on average. There are three possible orderings of local and
non—local residues in the 1+2+1 RPGs (1+2+1, 2+1+1, 1+1+2), so
the increase in the number of 1+2+1 RPGs may still be described
by a random model. There are only two possible ways to form a
3+1 RPG (3+1, 1+3), leaving us with the conclusion that packing
arrangements in which one residue is packed against a cluster of
three local residues are favored in larger proteins. The 3+1 class
has the most local contacts of all of the mixed classes with 3 local
contacts out of the 6 total contacts (2+2 has 2 of 6, 1+2+1 has 1
of 6). Only the all—local RPGs have more local contacts. Thus, the
overall effect of these changes in packing is to decrease the relative
contact order of longer proteins, consistent with earlier observations
(Ivankov et al., 2003).

The detailed view of packing interactions provided by the TerMos
also gives us insight into the differences between naturally occurring
proteins and human designed proteins. For example, in most
members of the protein G family, only one or two RPGs are within
1.5 A RMSD of any other RPG from the same protein. In the
designed protein L variant 1KHO (Kuhlman et al., 2002), however,
virtually all of the sheet only ([— E4 — —]) RPGs are within 1.5 A
RMSD of each other. The structure derives much of its packing
arrangements from the same TerMo. This design did not use a limited
amino acid alphabet, so it is likely that this homogeneity is due
to certain packing arrangements being excessively favored by the
simple energy function used in the design (Kuhlman and Baker,
2000).

4.2 Tertiary motif depiction

While we do not have space to go into detail for all the TerMos, we
use the well—populated [H1 E3 — —] TerMo shown in Figure 2B as an
example and discuss the insights provided by our two representations
of TerMos shown in Figure 4. Both density plots are able to capture
subtle features of the 1+2+1 packing arrangement that are not
necessarily apparent by simple inspection. The gauche- side—chain
conformation is favored by the two adjacent positions on the B—strand
(i, i+2), whereas in the non—local sheet and the helical positions,
both the gauche- and trans conformations are populated. Relating
these data to backbone conformational preference, we ﬁnd in this
[H1 E3 — —] case that a more negative to residue angle in sheet
conformation tends to shift the side—chain population towards the
trans conformation (compare the 3 sheet distributions in Fig. 4A).
The kernel density estimation in Figure 4B complements the
torsion angle plots. The two adjacent positions on the B—strand
are more constrained in their packing, as seen by their smaller
volumes of density, while the non—local sheet and helical residues
exhibit a much larger range of packing conformations. These data

Fig. 5. Tertiary structure simpliﬁed. (A) The core residues of Protein G [1pgb
(Gallagher et al., 1994)] are shown in ball and stick representation, while
the backbone is depicted in the classic cartoon ribbon. (B) For the same
protein in A, the core residues are replaced with the centers of masses based
on C6 position of the RPGs. Each is color coded according to the sequence
locality of interacting residues (see Table 1), where red: ‘3+1’; green: ‘2+2’;
blue: ‘1+2+1’; and yellow: ‘1+1+1+1’. No all local or 4 RPGs exist in this
structure.

strongly suggests that the structural and sequence variation are
largely accommodated by the non—local sheet and helical residues.
Of particular interest is that the C01 atoms for the non—local sheet
and helical positions exhibit the broadest range of spatial positions.
The implication is that sequence changes in this TerMo cause larger
backbone changes than side—chain rearrangements, but only for the
non—local sheet and helix residues. The two local sheet residues
remain more restrained in their backbone and side—chain positions.
In this way, the TerMo construct in conjunction with our two
representations is able to capture and depict the detailed tendencies
for repetitive elements of tertiary structure.

While the previous two representations provide a quantitative
analysis of TerMo conformations, Figure 5 demonstrates how the
sequence locality classiﬁcation of RPGs simpliﬁes, yet clearly
describes tertiary structure. Corroborating our results from Figure 3,
the core of Protein G possesses the dominant classes of locality RPGs
(3+1 and 1+2+1) are the major RPGs for the core of Protein G where
the helix favors the 3+1 RPGs and the sheet 1+2+1 RPGs.

Also, the 3+1 RPGs are concentrated in the densest area of the
helix/sheet packing. Dotting the outside of the core are a single 2+2
and three non—local 1+1+1+1 RPGs. As highlighted by Figure 5, the
tetrahedral clique construct of an RPG describes a basic packing
unit of tertiary structure. In conjunction with the sequence locality
classiﬁcation, the RPG becomes an intuitive description of the
packing within a protein core. The construct is simple enough for
analyses within and between protein folds, but complex enough to
capture the uniqueness of individual fold’s tertiary structure. By
providing a precise vocabulary to discuss tertiary structure, the
sequence locality RPG classiﬁcation has the potential to produce
new insight and characterizations of protein tertiary structure.

ABSTRACT

Summary: With the rapidly expanding availability of data from
personal genomes, exomes and transcriptomes, medical researchers
will frequently need to test whether observed genomic variants are
novel or known. This task requires downloading and handling large
and diverse datasets from a variety of sources, and processing them
with bioinformatics tools and pipelines. Alternatively, researchers
can upload data to online tools, which may conflict with privacy
requirements. We present here Kaviar, a tool that greatly simplifies
the assessment of novel variants. Kaviar includes: (i) an integrated
and growing database of genomic variation from diverse sources,
including over 55 million variants from personal genomes, family
genomes, transcriptomes, SNV databases and population surveys;
and (ii) software for querying the database efficiently.

Availability: Kaviar is programmed in Perl and offered free of
charge as Open Source Software. Kaviar may be used online as
a programmatic web service or downloaded for local use from
http://db.systemsbiology.net/kaviar. The database is also provided.

The advent of personalized systems medicine (Auffray et al., 2009)
will be predicated on the availability of precise genomic information
for each patient, which will be gleaned by genotyping of known
variants, by exome and transcriptome sequencing and through
whole-genome sequencing. A fraction of the personal variants
observed are false positive artifacts of random sequencing error or
cell line mutations, which may confound the search for disease-
causing mutations. When family genomes are available, over half
of the errors may be identiﬁed by inheritance state analysis (Roach
et al., 2010). Variants frequently observed in other personal genomes
are less likely to be random artifacts. Given the list of personal
variations, one of the ﬁrst analytical tasks is thus to determine,
for each variant, whether it has already been observed in humans.
Depending on the type and extent of sequencing done, a physician
or medical researcher may need to test from just a few to potentially
a very large number of observed genome variants, most of which
are single nucleotide variants (SNVs).

dbSNP is a freely available, periodically updated general
catalog of genome variation (Sherry et al., 2001). The recent
explosion of genomic sequencing projects have identiﬁed vast
numbers of variants that have not yet been incorporated to dbSNP,

a trend expected to increase as genomic sequencing becomes
more economical. Researchers therefore need to compare observed
SNVs with data from several different sources to ascertain whether
a variant is novel or known, and to determine the population
frequencies of the alleles. Access to these datasets is offered Via
various web interfaces, or as voluminous downloadable ﬁles. These
ﬁles come in a variety of formats and may specify coordinates
relative to different genome versions, thus requiring signiﬁcant
processing.

Importantly, the personal nature of the data may impose
signiﬁcant restrictions on the methods used for studying them:
Institutional Review Board (IRB) and other human subject protocols
may have speciﬁed that the data should be kept within the
institution’s intranet, or even limited to a speciﬁc machine, with tight
controls on data access. In this case, the use of web applications
to study personal data may be restricted or entirely disallowed,
leaving researchers with the single option of downloading huge ﬁles,
developing bioinformatics pipelines to use them and maintaining the
entire system updated as more data are produced. This effort is being
replicated in laboratories worldwide.

We have created Kaviar (Known VARiants), a compilation of
human SNVs collected from many and diverse sources (Table 1).
We obtained genomic shotgun data (as BAM ﬁles) and mapped
RNA-seq reads to hg19 using blat (Kent, 2002), then used VarScan
2.2.5 [Koboldt et al. (2009), with parameters: —min-coverage 8 —
min—reads2 4 —min-Var-freq 0.4 —p-Value 0.05] to identify SNVs.
We used liftOver to translate coordinates between genome references
as needed. See Methods in Supplementary Material for a detailed
description of processing pipelines, parameters and the querying
tools provided.

Kaviar answers a very speciﬁc question: what variants are
known for a given speciﬁc genomic location? For each SNV
in a query, Kaviar reports all known variants and their sources
(in which population or individual genomes they were observed),
or the fact that no variants are known. Where available, dbSNP
identiﬁers are displayed. Output formats include tabular html
annotated with relevant links, tab-delimited text, J avaScript Object
Notation (J SON) and Variant Call Format (VCF, Danecek et al.,
2011). The database encodes SNV positions, identities and sources.
SNVs are identiﬁed by their genomic location using standard hg18
(NCBI Build 36) or hg19 (GRCh37) coordinates. The Kaviar
database is compact, at 3.44% the size in Genome Variation
Format (GVF) (Reese et al., 2010) and 23.8% of the gzipped
GVF. Table 1 summarizes the various data sources represented
in Kaviar’s database as of July 26, 2011. Over half of the
current SNVs lack dbSNP identiﬁers. The largest contributor of
novel SNVs is the 1000 Genomes Project (1000 Genomes Project
Consortium, 2010). Individual genomes and variation databases

may include vast numbers of sequencing errors (Day, 2010). By
tracking of the provenance of each variant to its source individual
genome(s), Kaviar facilitates the selection of SNVs conﬁrmed by
independent observation. Caution should be used when interpreting
results, as SNV novelty need not imply functional or clinical
relevance. Conversely, known SNVs may have unknown functional
implications.

A variety of tools and services exist for collecting and annotating
genome variations, including Varietas (Paananen et al., 2010),
Squnt (Shetty et al., 2010), SVA (Pelak et al., 2010), PanSNde
(Ngamphiw et al., 2011) and ENGINES (Amigo et al., 2011).
Most of these tools focus on functional annotation of variants and
only offer web-based interfaces, or downloadables with difﬁcult
technical requirements. Some report only dbSNP data. Kaviar offers
the widest range of different SNV sources integrated into one
package. While most of the data sources in Kaviar are public,
local installations can be conﬁgured to include data particular to
an institution’s IRB protections and not made visible to outside
researchers. Alternatively, aggregate anonymized data can also be
reported. Indeed, the current distribution includes such aggregate
data from 44 unrelated individuals of diverse origins, which were
sequenced by the Institute for Systems Biology (see Methods in
Supplementary Material).

Kaviar is easily incorporated into automated workﬁows for
genome analysis, and results can be easily used by downstream tools
such as MAGMA (Hubley et al., 2003). Kaviar output can be used

to study genomic admixture and to judge the population frequency
of alleles, in turn used by many algorithms, including those that
integrate data across highly linked SNV (Roach et al., 2006).

We expect Kaviar to be of use to the casual researcher interested
in determining the novelty of sets of observed SNVs, to the growing
number of people with their own personal genome information, and
to researchers studying genome-wide personal variation requiring
strict conﬁdentiality.

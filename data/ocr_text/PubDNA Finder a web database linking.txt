ABSTRACT

Summary: PubDNA Finder is an online repository that we have
created to link PubMed Central manuscripts to the sequences of
nucleic acids appearing in them. It extends the search capabilities
provided by PubMed Central by enabling researchers to perform
advanced searches involving sequences of nucleic acids. This
includes, among other features (i) searching for papers mentioning
one or more specific sequences of nucleic acids and (ii) retrieving the
genetic sequences appearing in different articles. These additional
query capabilities are provided by a searchable index that we created
by using the full text of the 176 672 papers available at PubMed
Central at the time of writing and the sequences of nucleic acids
appearing in them. To automatically extract the genetic sequences
occurring in each paper, we used an original method we have
developed. The database is updated monthly by automatically
connecting to the PubMed Central FTP site to retrieve and index
new manuscripts. Users can query the database via the web interface
provided.

Availability: PubDNA Finder can be freely accessed at

1 INTRODUCTION

The biological literature is the main source of information reporting
empirically validated genetic sequences, such as for instance PCR
primers and probes. As result, researchers usually need to review the
available literature to search for sequence data, which can be a hard
and time—consuming task. PubMed Central is currently the main
source of open—access full—text papers reporting genetic sequence
data. However, the search engine provided by PubMed Central does
not support researchers to retrieve papers containing the genetic
sequences speciﬁed by the user, and to automatically identify and
extract the sequences of nucleic acids mentioned in the retrieved
articles.

PubDNA Finder is an online repository linking PubMed Central
manuscripts to the different genetic sequences appearing in them.
It extends the search capabilities provided by PubMed Central

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

by allowing researchers to (i) retrieve all articles containing the
genetic sequences speciﬁed by the user—featuring both exact and
approximate matching; (ii) retrieve all the sequences appearing in
the manuscripts matching a keyword—based query; and (iii) retrieve
all articles matching a keyword—based query and containing the
sequences speciﬁed by the user. PubDNA Finder currently contains
the 176672 papers available from PubMed Central at the time of
writing. The database is automatically updated on a monthly basis
to retrieve and index new manuscripts.

2 METHODS

To create the index, we downloaded all the 176 672 XML—formatted
manuscripts available from the PubMed Central FTP site1 at the time of
writing. We used Apache Lucene2 3.0.1 to index the different documents
based on the full text of the manuscripts and the genetic sequences appearing
in each manuscript. The latter were automatically identiﬁed and extracted—
together with the context in which they appeared—using a method created
by the authors and reported elsewhere (Garcia—Remesal at 611., 2010). The
adopted method resorts to a rule—based expert system to automatically
identify and extract the sequences of nucleic acids. To enable users to
interactively query the developed index, we created a web interface.

3 FEATURES

Users can perform three different types of queries using PubDNA
Finder, as described below.

3.1 Sequence-based queries

Sequence—based queries (SBQs) are aimed at retrieving all
manuscripts containing one or more genetic sequences speciﬁed
by the user. There are two different types of SBQs: simple and
advanced. Simple SBQs are composed of one or more complete
sequences linked by a single logical operator, such as ‘retrieve all
manuscripts containing either the sequence TATGGAAMAGATC—
GGCGG or the sequence ATTGGCGAAGTCGGTAGG’TO launch
this query, we would type the target sequences—one per line—in
the text—box labeled with ‘Sequences’ (Fig. l) and then we would
select the OR logical operator in the ‘Operator’ combo box.

In contrast, advanced SBQs can involve complex expressions
following the Lucene query syntax. This includes, among other
features, the use of wildcards—eg. ‘?’ to match a single character
or ‘*’ to match any number of characters—range—based queries,
fuzzy queries (to perform approximate matching) and complex
logic combinations of different expressions. An example of
advanced SBQ would be ‘retrieve all manuscripts containing genetic
sequences matching any of the expressions AT??TGAA*TA or
AT??TGAA*GA’. To launch this query, we would type the string
‘AT??TGAA*TA OR AT??TGAA*GA’ in the textbox labeled as
‘Sequences’ and then we would select the ‘LUCENE’ operator in
the ‘Operator’ combo box.

3.2 Keyword-based queries

Keyword—based queries (KBQs) are designed to retrieve the
sequences appearing in manuscripts matching the search terms. To
perform a KBQ, we would type a sequence of keywords in the
textbox labeled as ‘Free Text’ (Fig. 1). After executing the query, we
would be presented with the sequences appearing in all manuscripts
containing any of the search terms. Additionally, we can create more
complex queries by following the Lucene query syntax. For instance,
the query “‘TaqMan probe” AND “Brucella Melitensis”’ would
retrieve the sequences mentioned in all the manuscripts containing
both the strings ‘TaqMan probe’ and ‘Brucella Melitensis’.

3.3 Combined queries

Combined queries (CQs) are aimed at retrieving all articles matching
a keyword—based query and containing the sequences speciﬁed by
the user. Figure 1 shows an example of a CQ, where we are interested
in retrieving all manuscripts matching the KBQ ‘(primer OR probe)
AND “plasmodium falciparum” ’ and containing sequences that
match the expression ‘TGTG‘I< OR TGTT*’.

As shown in Figure 1, users are presented with the different
sequences (and manuscripts) matching the user query, together with
the context in which they appear. Users can also access the full text
of the retrieved manuscripts at PubMed Central by following the
provided links.

3.4 Additional features

PubDNA Finder can also retrieve all the sequences mentioned in
any speciﬁc manuscript identiﬁed by its PubMed Central identiﬁer
(PMCID). For instance, to retrieve all sequences appearing in the
article whose PMCID is 1253840, we would type the query string
‘pmcid11253840’ in the text—box labeled with ‘Free Text’.

Additionally, PubDNA Finder features a built—in recognizer and
extractor of genetic sequences. Users can paste any text in the
‘Sequences’ text—box to automatically identify and extract all the
sequences mentioned in the pasted text simply by clicking the button
‘Detect Sequences’.

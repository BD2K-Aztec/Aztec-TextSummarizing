ABSTRACT

Summary: The reliable detection of RNA editing sites from massive
sequencing data remains challenging and, although several methodol-
ogies have been proposed, no computational tools have been
released to date. Here, we introduce REDItools a suite of python
scripts to perform high-throughput investigation of RNA editing using
next-generation sequencing data.

Availability and implementation: REDItools are in python program-
ming language and freely available at http://code.google.com/p/redi
tools/.

1 INTRODUCTION

RNA editing is an important post-transcriptional mechanism
that alters primary RNAs through the insertion/deletion or
modiﬁcation of speciﬁc nucleotides (Gott and Emeson, 2000).
It occurs in a wide range of organisms and, concurrently with
alternative splicing, increases the diversity of eukaryotic tran-
scriptomes and proteomes (Mallela and Nishikura, 2012).

In humans, RNA editing affects both coding and non-coding
transcripts by the deamination of cytosine to uridine (C-to-U) or,
more commonly, through the conversion of adenosine to inosine
(A-to-I) by members of adenosine deaminase (ADAR) family of
enzymes, which act on double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) (Gott
and Emeson, 2000). Editing events can lead to a variety of bio-
logical effects depending on the RNA type (mRNA or ncRNA)
or region (5’-UTR, 3’-UTR, CDS, intron) involved in the RNA
editing modiﬁcation (Keegan et al., 2001). For example, changes
in UTRs can lead to altered expression, preventing efﬁcient ribo-
some binding or recognition by small regulatory RNAs whereas
alterations in coding protein regions can induce amino acid re-
placements with variable functional consequences. In addition,
RNA editing can inﬂuence the activity of ncRNAs such as
siRNAs, miRNAs and potentially of piwiRNAs by affecting
base-pairing interactions within RNA secondary structures
WVulff and Nishikura, 2012). The importance of RNA editing
is underlined by the fact that its deregulation in humans is asso-
ciated with a variety of neurological or neurodegenerative

disorders and cancer (Gallo and Locatelli, 2011; Silberberg
et al., 2012).

Although the identiﬁcation of sites subject to RNA editing is
simple, in principle, requiring the direct comparison between tran-
scripts and their corresponding genomic loci of origin, accurate
genome-wide implementation remains a challenging task (Bass
et al., 2012). Few years ago, we published the ﬁrst attempt to
use massive transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) for exploring
the RNA editing landscape in mitochondria of grapevine (Picardi
et al., 2010). Since then, RNA-Seq has become the de facto stand-
ard approach to study RNA editing potential in whole eukaryotic
genomes, with sometimes questionable results (Hayden, 2011;
Ramaswarni et al., 2012). The major challenge in identifying
RNA editing changes by RNA-Seq data is the discrimination
of true RNA editing sites from genome-encoded SNPs and tech-
nical artefacts caused by sequencing or read-mapping errors
(Eisenberg, 2012; Ramaswarni et al., 2012). The use of DNA-
Seq data from single individuals, annotations in dbSNPs and
several stringent ﬁlters can minimize the detection of false RNA
editing sites (Eisenberg, 2012; Ramaswami, et al., 2012).

Although several methodologies to reveal the RNA editing
potential in eukaryotic transcriptomes have been proposed, no
comprehensive software devoted to this aim has been released. In
the meantime, massive transcriptome sequencing data are rou-
tinely produced worldwide and a large number of experiments
from different organisms and conditions are freely available
through specialized databases such as the Short Read Archive
at NCBI.

To promote the investigation of RNA editing at large scale in
the next-generation sequencing era, we developed the package
REDItools—comprising of a suite of scripts written in the port-
able python language. REDItools are available under the MIT
license at http://code.google.com/p/reditools/, are not organism
oriented and work with RNA-Seq and DNA-Seq data from any
sequencing platform.

2 FEATURES

REDItools include three main scripts to study RNA editing using
both RNA-Seq and DNA-Seq data from the same sample/indi-
vidual or RNA-Seq data alone. REDItooanaRNA.py detects
RNA editing candidates by comparing pre-aligned RNA-Seq
and DNA-Seq reads in the standard BAM format. The script
explores genomic positions site by site and returns a table contain-
ing the coverage depth, the mean quality score, the observed base
distribution, the strand if available and the list of observed

substitutions as well as the frequency of variation. If DNA-Seq
data are also available, the same information, except for the
strand, is provided to assess genomic sequence and, thus, exclude
potential SNPs. In addition, individual positions can be ﬁltered
according to read coverage, base quality score, mapping quality,
bases supporting the variation, type of substitution and frequency.
REDItooanaRna.py can exclude positions in homopolymeric re-
gions of predeﬁned length, in intronic sequences surrounding
known splice sites, invariant RNA-Seq positions, sites not sup-
ported by DNA-Seq and positions near read ends. Additionally,
users can provide genomic regions to include or exclude in RNA
editing searches. Additional read level ﬁlters include the possibility
of excluding ambiguously mapped reads, possible PCR duplicates
and discordant paired-end reads. In the case of directional RNA-
Seq data, REDItooanaRna.py can infer the strand per position,
improving the reliability of RNA editing calls by excluding noise
from antisense transcription or mapping errors. Alternatively, the
strand of individual positions can be inferred from user speciﬁed
annotations.

REDItoolKnown.py, has been developed to explore the RNA
editing potential of RNA-Seq experiments by looking at known
events only, following an improved methodology implemented in
our ExpEdit web service (Picardi et al., 2011) (see Supplementary
Material for details).

Finally, REDItoolDenovo.py performs the de novo detection of
RNA editing candidates using RNA-Seq data alone without
resequencing data for the individual donor genome (Picardi
et al., 2012) (see Supplementary Material for details).

REDItools includes some accessory scripts to post-process
output tables, ﬁltering candidates position-by-position using
known annotations and identifying ambiguous alignments by
Blat. All candidate positions can also be easily and quickly anno-
tated using relevant databases as those in the UCSC genome
browser.

3 IMPLEMENTATION

REDItools are in the portable python programming language
and based on the Pysam module, a wrapper for the widely
used SAMtools (Li et al., 2009), which includes methods and
functions to handle read alignments in SAM/BAM format—
facilitating the browsing of multiple read alignments site by site
along a reference genome. All scripts have low memory request
enabling RNA editing calling on standard desktop computers.
Because the search for RNA editing candidates is time-consum-
ing requiring the processing of individual genomic positions,
REDItools can speed up the process by distributing calculations
over independent cores using the native python multiprocessing
module. Filtering and annotation of individual positions is
extremely fast and memory efﬁcient, as it is performed by the
tabix program (Li et al., 2009) wrapped in the Pysam module.

REDItools require inputs in BAM format from any platform/
organism, and results are provided in tab-formatted tables
facilitating downstream analyses.

We tested REDItools on the lymphoblastoid cell line
GM12878 used in Ramaswami et al. (2012) for which BAM
ﬁles produced by the BWA mapper (Li and Durbin, 2009) were
kindly provided by the authors. Limiting the analysis to chr21
and using the same ﬁltering scheme as the original work, we

obtained remarkably similar results (see Supplementary
Material for details). Remapping all reads by GSNAP WV u and
Nacu, 2011) to preserve the paired end information and reapply-
ing REDItools, we obtained 221401 and 2089 candidate editing
sites in Alu regions and non-Alu non repetitive regions, respect-
ively, with respect to 147 029 and 1451 sites detected by
Ramaswami et al. (2012) (see Supplementary Material for
details).

In conclusion, REDItools is a unique and effective resource
for the investigation of RNA editing from NGS data. It is highly
ﬂexible, including a variety of ﬁlters and quality checks, and may
provide very reliable sets of editing candidate sites according to
the user requirements (see Supplementary Material for a further
benchmark application on Illumina Body Map RNA-Seq data).

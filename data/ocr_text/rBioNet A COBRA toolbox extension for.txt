ABSTRACT

Motivation: Genome-scale metabolic networks are widely used in
systems biology. However, to date no freely available tool exists that
ensures quality control during the reconstruction process.

Results: Here, we present a COBRA toolbox extension, rBioNet,
enabling the construction of publication-level biochemical networks
while enforcing necessary quality control measures. rBioNet has
an intuitive user interface facilitating the reconstruction process for
novices and experts.

Availability: The rBioNet is freely available from http://opencobra
.sourceforge.net.

1 INTRODUCTION

Genome—scale metabolic reconstructions play an important role in
molecular systems biology as they provide a structured format
for genomic, genetic and biochemical information available for a
target organism (Palsson, 2006). A reconstruction often has detailed
gene information, literature references and reaction/metabolite
information associated in addition to an organism—speciﬁc reaction
list (Thiele and Palsson, 2010). The reconstruction process is well
established for metabolic networks and has been applied to >45
organisms on a genome scale. While this approach is widely
used, no comprehensive, easy—to—use and free—of—charge software
package exists that ensures quality of the mostly manually curated
reconstruction content. Existing tools for metabolic reconstructions
include MetAnnoGen (Gille et al., 2007) and MEMOSys (Pabinger
et al., 2011). However, many researchers still use spreadsheets
for the reconstruction process to assemble and monitor the
reconstruction content, which have the disadvantage of missing
quality control modules. A quality check—as—you— go would make the
reconstruction effort more efﬁcient and traceable.

Here, we present a freely available software package that
implements important quality control and assurance measures
(QC/QA), which are crucial for the construction of high—quality
genome—scale biochemical networks (Thiele and Palsson, 2010).

rBioNet is embedded in the Matlab programming environment
relying on many QC/QA measures already present in the COBRA
toolbox (Becker et al., 2007; Schellenberger et al., 2011).
Biochemical reconstructions, assembled with rBioNet, can be

readily converted into mathematical models, and they can then be
interrogated using constraint—based methods (Palsson, 2006).

2 METHODS

rBioNet consists of three parts: (i) a metabolite creator with associated
metabolite database (MetDB); (ii) a reaction creator with reaction database
(RanB); and (iii) a reconstruction creator (Fig. 1). To ensure consistency
and quality, reactions can only contain metabolites present in MetDB and
they can only be added to a reconstruction when they are present in RanB.

MetDB and RanB are stored in metab.mat and rxn.mat, respectively.
The provided ﬁles within this package contain only sample metabolites and
reactions, which may be expanded prior to or during any reconstruction
effort.

Metabolite creator: there are three ways to create metabolites: (i) manual
addition of metabolite information; (ii) loading of a tab—delimited ﬁle
containing all necessary information; or (iii) loading metabolite information
from other COBRA reconstructions (model structure). Required and optional
information is described in the manual. When saving a new metabolite,
entered information will be checked against MetDB for potential duplicate
entries. This check will be done based on metabolite abbreviaton and
charged formulae. No entry can have the same metabolite abbreviation but
duplicated formulae may exist (e. g. for isoforms). Metabolites within MetDB
are organism— and compartment independent. A new metabolite can also
be created by opening, modifying and saving an existing entry as a new
metabolite (under a new abbreviation).

Reaction creator: there are three ways of populating the RanB: (i)
manually entering corresponding information; (ii) loading a tab—delimited
ﬁle; or (iii) loading another COBRA reconstruction (model structure). Also,
a new reaction can be added to the database by copying and modifying

an existing entry. Note that in all cases the reaction(s) can only contain
metabolites that exist in the MetDB. Reactions are organism independent
but compartment speciﬁc. When adding a new reaction to RanB, the
reaction will be checked for mass and charge balance. An unbalanced
reaction will provoke a warning and a detailed report of unbalanced
elements/charge. However, the user may choose to proceed as certain
reactions are unbalanced even in high—quality reconstructions (e. g. biomass
reaction, exchange reactions) (Thiele and Palsson, 2010). Subsequently, the
new reaction is checked for uniqueness. This step may require some time
depending on the size of RanB. The check includes uniqueness of reaction
abbreviation and of reaction formulae. No duplicated reactions with different
abbreviations are permitted. However, a reaction may re—occur in a different
cellular compartment. New compartments can be readily created.

Reconstruction creator: a user can choose to create a reconstruction
from scratch or to load an existing reconstruction for expansion and/or
modiﬁcation. Again, only reactions that are present in the RanB can be
added to the reconstruction. All reaction information present in the RanB
will be associated with the model when a reaction is added to the working
model. The user can edit and add further information (e. g. references, notes,
subsystems) to a reconstruction reaction. Furthermore, global information,
such as reconstructor, reconstructed organism, version, and source of gene
index, can be added to the reconstruction.

GPR creator: each reconstruction reaction can be associated with genes via
gene—protein—reaction—associations (GPRs). Therefore, a gene index needs
to be imported into the reconstruction creator, a tab—delimited ﬁle describing
key properties of the organism’s gene annotations. A GPR is created using
Boolean logic, ‘AND’, ‘OR’.

Reconstruction analyzer: basic information about the reconstruction
is provided and dead—end metabolites are highlighted. This analyzer
provides real—time feedback on reconstruction progress and potential missing
reactions. A detailed description can be found in the manual.

Export a reconstruction: a reconstruction can be saved in Matlab format as
a model structure. All associated information will be stored. This model
structure can be used for further analysis within the COBRA toolbox
or exported to other formats, including spreadsheet and Systems Biology
Markup Language (SBML) using the COBRA toolbox (writeCBmodel).

Import a reconstruction: a reconstruction can be imported into rBioNet using
the reconstruction creator from Matlab format (model structure), spreadsheet
or SBML (via COBRA toolbox). If a reconstruction had been constructed
with rBioNet, all associated information will be loaded. When loading an
existing reconstruction into the reconstruction creator, the user is asked to
provide a ﬁle location of the gene index. This ﬁle is optional but if provided,
information is accessible through the reconstruction creator.

Reconstruction versus model: a reconstruction provides a detailed list of
biochemical functions encoded by an organism’s genome and serves as a
basis for condition—speciﬁc models. rBioNet is an environment to assemble
a reconstruction. The constraints on the exported model structure have to be
adjusted as desired using the COBRA toolbox to obtain a condition—speciﬁc
model. We do not consider reaction directionality, which are contained in the
exported structure, as condition—speciﬁc constraints for this purpose.

3 IMPLEMENTATION

rBioNet was encoded in Matlab programming environment
(MathWorks, Inc.) requiring the COBRA toolbox, version 1.3
or higher (Becker et al., 2007; Schellenberger et al., 2011),
to be installed. A user—friendly interface faciliates the use of
this tool by novices in programming and/or metabolic network

reconstruction. A comprehensive manual is provided including
installation information and frequently asked questions.

4 DISCUSSION

rBioNet is freely available permitting the reconstruction of
high—quality, genome—scale biochemical networks consistent with
established standard procedures (Thiele and Palsson, 2010). In
particular, it ensures QC/QA measures required for publication—
level reconstructions. rBioNet is embeded within the COBRA
toolbox enabling iterative approach of reconstruction, validation and
debugging. In particular, we put emphasis on an intuitive interface
that allows novices to Matlab to perform high—quality metabolic
reconstructions. The database allows customized inclusion of
metabolites and reactions in the corresponding databases but
thanks to its import function, online databases, e.g. KEGG ligand
database (Kanehisa et al., 2010), may be incorporated into MetDB
and RanB.

A current shortcoming of rBioNet includes missing database
binding for the metabolite, reaction and reconstruction creator.
Nevertheless, the current setup enables simultaneous use and
modiﬁcation by multiple users. Future extensions may include
the availability of a globally available and accessible database
for metabolites and reactions, which could be directly used by
any rBioNet user and thus, would permit ultimatively compability
between biochemical models. The creation of such database would
require signiﬁcant work and would need to be coordinated with the
existing biochemical databases and efforts.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: A major challenge in genomics is the accurate
annotation of component genes. Enzymes are typically predicted
using homology-based search methods, where the membership
of a protein to an enzyme family is based on single-sequence
comparisons. As such, these methods are often error-prone and lack
useful measures of reliability for the prediction.

Results: Here, we present DETECT, a probabilistic method for
enzyme prediction that accounts for the sequence diversity across
enzyme families. By comparing the global alignment scores of an
unknown protein to those of all known enzymes, an integrated
likelihood score can be readily calculated, ranking the reaction
classes relevant for that protein. Comparisons to BLAST reveal
significant improvements in enzyme annotation accuracy. Applied to
Plasmodium falciparum, we identify potential annotation errors and
predict novel enzymes of therapeutic interest.

1 INTRODUCTION

Comprising the entire network of chemical reactions carried out
by a living cell, metabolism represents sets of enzymes and
pathways that drive the synthesis and degradation of the essential
molecules of life. The reconstruction of these networks through
genome analyses are beginning to reveal a considerable diversity
in metabolic complements, reﬂecting fundamental biological and
ecological adaptations (Chen and Vitkup, 2006; Kharchenko et al.,
2006; Pal et al., 2006; Samal et al., 2006). As such, there is increasing
interest in the accurate reconstruction of metabolic networks for
purposes of metabolic engineering and drug discovery (Lee et al.,
2009; Pharkya and Maranas, 2006; Wang et al., 2006).

Prior to the advent of genomic sequencing, metabolic network
construction involved painstaking studies focused on individual
enzymes derived from an organism of interest. As a result, only a
small number of reconstructions were possible (Papoutsakis, 1984),

but are very well—developed and serve as models for the
reconstruction process in other organisms (Christie et al., 2004).
The challenge is now to apply this knowledge to help annotate the
increasing numbers of genomes that are currently being sequenced.
The process has been aided by the development of the Enzyme
Commission (EC) hierarchy in which sequences are mapped to
distinct enzymatic functions. Due to the large number of genes
encoded by a genome, the annotation process is reliant on the
use of automated methods based on sequence similarity or proﬁle
discovery. Commonly used tools such as BLAST (Altschul et al.,
1990) are useful when looking for homologues based on overall
sequence similarity, while more sensitive proﬁle based methods [e.g.
PFAM (Bateman et al., 2002), PROSITE (Hulo et al., 2008)] focus
on the conservation of domains, sequence patterns and even single
residues (Mistry et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2008).

Although widely applied in databases such as KEGG (Kanehisa
et al., 2007) and BioCyc (Caspi et al., 2007), sequence—based
methods suffer from limitations when dealing with enzymatic
proteins. In particular, homology transfer methods typically ignore
the range of sequence variation characterizing individual enzyme
classes; while certain enzymes are relatively easy to classify based
on sequence conservation, there are numerous examples of enzymes
that share high sequence similarity and catalyze different reactions
(Rost, 2002). Furthermore, the use of only a single protein match
to assign function (usually the highest scoring homolog) greatly
impacts the reliability of the assignment. In the absence of some
measure of reliability, genes may be indiscriminately annotated
with incorrect EC numbers that can lead to non—biologically
relevant interpretations (Green and Karp, 2005). Consequently, there
is a need to associate enzyme annotations with an appropriate
conﬁdence score, which is lacking even in recently developed
functional classiﬁcation tools (Espadaler et al., 2008; Levy et al.,
2005). In an attempt to circumvent these issues, enzyme databases
such as KEGG and BioCyc devote considerable effort to manual
curation to improve on the quality of annotations. However, critical
comparisons of these databases reveal numerous discrepancies,
highlighting the importance of developing consistent methods and
standards for assigning reliable gene annotations (Ginsburg, 2009).

Here, we describe a new probabilistic method for enzyme
prediction based on both global and local sequence alignment,
which we term Density Estimation Tool for Enzyme ClassiﬁcaTion
(DETECT). DETECT uses a Bayesian framework that integrates
information from density estimation proﬁles generated for each
EC number. Instead of relying on similarity to a single sequence,

DETECT and its application to P.fa|ciparum

 

a probability score is calculated from the similarity scores of all
relevant proteins for a particular EC number. Each EC number
is represented by a family of proteins that have been either
biochemically characterized or computationally predicted to have
the same catalytic activity. We deﬁne an enzyme family as the
set of proteins that share a common EC number. A high—scoring
match of an unknown protein to a single member of an enzyme
family provides evidence for shared catalytic activity, but is not
always sufﬁcient to justify the transfer of function. In many cases,
the unknown protein will also exhibit varying degrees of similarity
to other members of the family and, more importantly, may also
show similarity to proteins from different enzyme families. Based
on this prior information, we can compute a posterior probability
representing the likelihood of membership to a particular enzyme
family. By providing a list of probabilities associated with predicted
functions for an unknown enzymatic protein, DETECT not only
improves enzyme annotation accuracy, but also provides ranked
lists of candidate enzymes that may be exploited for the purposes
of metabolic network reconstruction. Applying DETECT to the
genome of the apicomplexan Plasmodiumfalcipamm, the causative
agent of malaria, we demonstrate how DETECT improves on
existing approaches.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Protein sequence and enzyme data

Proteins used for generating the density estimation proﬁles were obtained
from SwissProt Version 57.0 which is considered a non—redundant database
(Bairoch and preiler, 2000). Sequence fragments were excluded by
rejecting sequences annotated with a description ﬁeld containing ‘fragment’.
The 397 213 proteins taken from SwissProt were assigned either: (i) a
complete EC number, (ii) an incomplete EC number (either partial EC or
contained ‘n’ as an EC digit), (iii) multiple EC numbers or (iv) no EC
number (representing unannotated enzymes and/or non—enzyme proteins).
To avoid ambiguity, multifunctional enzymes (proteins that have been
assigned multiple EC numbers) and incompletely annotated enzymes were
excluded, leaving 127 478 proteins spanning 2277 complete EC categories.
The proteome for P.falciparum was obtained from PlasmoDB (version 5.5,
http://www.plasmodb.org; Bahl et al., 2003). As of January 2009, the
P.falcipamm genome consists of 5459 proteins, 2022 of which have been
functionally annotated, leaving 3257 proteins with unknown function.

2.2 Generation of probability proﬁles

To increase efﬁciency of analyses, proteins from Swiss—Prot were aligned
using BLAST and ﬁltered with an E—value <1. Protein pairs from these
alignments were globally aligned using the Needleman—Wunsch algorithm
(Rice et al., 2000), resulting in a total of 55 089045 alignments covering
4147 species (based on unique Swiss—Prot identiﬁers). Here, we use global
rather than local alignments to avoid individual domain matches that may not
be relevant to the catalytic speciﬁcity of the enzyme. All self—alignments and
alignments with a BLAST bit score <50 were considered unmeaningful and
excluded from the DETECT analysis. EC categories were mapped to query
and hit proteins of all global alignments. Alignments were grouped by the
EC annotation of the query protein. Each EC—speciﬁc set of alignments was
further divided into one of two categories: (i) positive alignments: aligned
protein is annotated with the same EC number as the query protein, or
(ii) negative alignments: aligned protein is annotated with a different EC
number (or has no EC number at all). A probability proﬁle was generated
for each enzyme, consisting of the density estimation values for positive
alignment scores and density estimation values for negative alignment scores.
Density estimation values were calculated using the R statistical program

(http://www.r—project.org/). This was performed for all enzyme categories
with 30 members or more (585 EC categories). EC categories with less than
30 members were considered to have inadequate sequence data to produce
accurate and meaningful probability proﬁles.

2.3 Probability score calculation

The probability proﬁles provide a probabilistic framework for predicting the
enzymatic function of an unknown protein based on sequence diversity. For
an unknown protein P, pairwise global sequence alignments are generated
with every Swiss—Prot protein. The resulting alignments are then categorized
by the EC number of the aligned protein (only proteins annotated with EC
categories are included in this analysis). The non—redundant set of hit EC
numbers E = {E 1 , E2, ... ,En} represents n potential enzyme activities that are
performed by the unknown protein. A probability score corresponding to the
likelihood that P has enzyme activity E,- is calculated for each i = 1,2, ..., n,
based on the respective alignment scores, together with the prior information
known about Ei. We integrate these multiple pieces of evidence using Bayes
Theorem as follows.

Given unknown protein P and alignments that have been categorized by
EC number as described earlier, let F be the EC category of interest and m
be the number of alignments between P and proteins with activity F. Now
deﬁne the alignments as a1,a2,  ,am having hit proteins f1,f2, ...,fm and
scores 51,52, ...,sm. The probability p,- that P belongs to F based on a,- is

P(F) 'P(SiIF)
P(F) 'P(Si| |F)+P(F/) 'P(SiIF/).

 

Pi=P(FISi)= (1)
P(F) is the probability that a protein belongs to F, calculated as the ratio
of proteins with F activity to the total number of proteins. P(F’) is the
probability that a protein does not belong to F, and equal to 1—P(F).
P(sl- |F) represents the probability of seeing an alignment with score 5,- given
that the hit protein has activity F ; this is simply the density estimation
value taken from the positive hit distribution for the probability proﬁle of
F. P(sl-lF/) is the probability of seeing an alignment with score 5,- given
that the hit protein does not have activity F, and is equal to the density
estimation value taken from the negative hit distribution for the probability
proﬁle of F. Thus, p,- represents the likelihood that P belongs to F given
its alignment to protein f,- with score 51-. This gives us m likelihood scores:
p1,p2, ..., pm. Combining these probabilities, we obtain a single score that
represents the overall likelihood that P is classiﬁed with activity F. The
integrated likelihood score is calculated as

n
Pcombined =1_ H(1_pi) (2)

i=1
and represents a combined score that expresses increased conﬁdence when
additional evidence is available. While formula (2) is relatively simple to
implement and has been applied in other contexts such as the prediction of
protein—protein interactions (von Mering et al., 2005), it is appreciated that an
alternative and more elegant solution would be to merge Equations ( 1) and (2)
as previously described (Leontovich et al., 2008). However, comparisons
between these approaches revealed little signiﬁcant difference. In many
instances, an unknown enzyme will have multiple EC predictions, which

can then be ranked according to the integrated likelihood score.

2.4 Five-fold cross-validation and ROC analysis

To compare the performance of DETECT with BLAST and PSI—BLAST,
we applied a 5—fold cross—validation approach to predict EC categories for
proteins from Swiss—Prot. Proteins annotated with an EC category containing
less than 30 protein members were removed, while the remaining 385 142
proteins were randomly assigned into ﬁve sets of equal size. For each set,
training data were assembled from the other four data sets and used to
generate density estimation distributions for all enzyme classes. Using these
distributions, DETECT was applied to generate predictions where each EC
number is associated with a probability conﬁdence score. Separate BLAST

and PSI—BLAST searches were performed for each protein in the test set
against the training set and the highest scoring match extracted. PSI—BLAST
was run with ﬁve iterations and an E —value cutoff of 1. For each method, we
deﬁned true positives (TP) as Swiss—Prot annotated enzymes that matched the
prediction with a score greater than the assigned cutoff; false positives (FP)
as those proteins with incorrect enzyme predictions (including those with
no enzyme annotation); true negatives (TN) as proteins neither predicted
to have enzymatic activity nor annotated by Swiss—Prot as having enzyme
activity; and false negatives (FN) as enzymes annotated by Swiss—Prot but
not predicted to have any enzyme activity. Values were determined for a
range of score cutoffs (BLAST E—value 0.1 to e-300; DETECT probability
0.1 to 1.0) and were used to generate receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curves. Another method based on enzyme proﬁles, PRIAM (Claudel—Renard
et al., 2003), was also considered for the ROC analysis. However, due to
the implementation of the algorithm, this was not possible since PRIAM
proﬁles cannot be regenerated for ﬁve—fold cross—validation as they have
been pre—trained on Swiss—Prot.

2.5 Prediction of malarial enzymes

Each automated method (DETECT, BLAST and PRIAM) was applied to the
P.falcipamm proteome to generate predictions that were compared to the
well annotated database of Malaria Parasite Metabolic Pathways (MPMP;
Ginsburg, 2006; release 17 December 2008). For the DETECT predictions,
density distributions were constructed after the removal of Plasmodium
proteins from Swiss—Prot. After removing partial EC numbers, annotations
to EC numbers with less than 30 proteins, and proteins that mapped to more
than one EC number, 457 protein—EC mappings were obtained from MPMP.
The query sequences were classiﬁed as either: (i) enzymes based on MPMP
annotation or (ii) non—enzymes based on Gene Ontology (GO) evidence.
The set of enzymes representing 457 unique proteins were annotated by
MPMP with a single complete EC number containing at least 30 protein
members. The set of non—enzymes represented 274 unique proteins with
annotations that were not in MPMP, did not contain ‘ase’, and mapped to a
G0 experimental and/or author statement evidence code.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 Assessing enzyme diversity

Previous sequence based methods for genome annotations have
relied on single score cutoffs to deﬁne enzyme classiﬁcations.
As such these methods typically ignore the range of sequence
variation characterizing individual enzyme classes, which can
make certain enzymes easier to discriminate on the basis of
sequence similarity than others. To explore sequence diversity within
different enzyme families, we performed a systematic set of global
alignments for each enzyme against every other protein within
the Swiss—Prot database (Boeckmann et al., 2005). The Swiss—Prot
database was chosen as it provides manually curated high—quality
protein annotations (Schnoes et al., 2009). From Swiss—Prot, we
identiﬁed 127 478 proteins annotated with one of 2277 complete
EC categories. Of these, 1285 (56%) were associated with 10
or fewer distinct protein sequences, while only 80 (4%) were
represented by >400 (Supplementary Fig. S1). For each of these
127 478 enzymes, we initially performed a BLAST search against
Swiss—Prot to identify potential sequence matches. Each match was
globally aligned using the Needleman—Wunsch algorithm. Results
were split into two groups: (i) aligned protein is annotated with
the same EC number as query protein (‘positive alignment’); or
(ii) aligned protein is annotated with a different EC number than
query protein, or has not been annotated with an EC number
(‘negative alignment’). For each EC category, similarity scores of

the positive and negative alignments for each individual protein
belonging to that category are combined to yield two density
distributions. To reduce potential bias caused by sampling relatively
small datasets, density proﬁles were created only for those enzyme
families which contain 30 distinct proteins or more (5 85 EC numbers
represented by 115 407 proteins; Supplementary Table S1). The
results of this analysis for ﬁfty representative enzymes are shown
in Figure 1. Across all enzymes we note a wide spectrum of
sequence diversity suggesting that some enzymes are easier to
discriminate than others. For example, for proteins belonging to
the enzyme family, EC:2.7.2.3 (phosphoglycerate kinase), scores of
alignments to other family members may be readily discriminated
from the alignment scores of non—family members. Conversely,
for proteins belonging to EC:2.7.11.1 (serine/threonine kinases),
it is difﬁcult to distinguish family members on the basis of their
alignment scores. Interestingly, we found that for enzymes on
both ends of the sequence diversity spectrum, one or two EC
categories predominated the negative alignments for that enzyme.
This could be problematic for enzymes considered difﬁcult to
distinguish based on alignment scores, and may be explained by
the level of speciﬁcity present within the EC hierarchy where
a new reaction must be assigned on the basis of a very small
difference in sequence speciﬁcity. For instance, EC:1.1.1.37 has
most of its negative alignments to EC: 1.1.1.27; while both enzymes
perform similar activities, they differ in sequence by only a
few key catalytic residues. We found this was the case for
many enzymes with low discrimination proﬁles. For enzymes
with highly discriminatory proﬁles, however, the predominant
negative EC category was typically associated with a completely
different enzyme activity showing no similarity in function or
substrates. The enzyme EC:3.3.1.1 (Adenosylhomocysteinase), for
instance, hits mostly EC: 1.1.1.86 (Ketol—acid reductoisomerase) in
the negative distribution. These observed differences in alignment
score distributions may at least in part be attributable to the
degree of substrate speciﬁcity associated with the enzyme. As an
example, we note that EC:2.7.2.3 has a very speciﬁc function in
the glycolysis pathway where binding of 3—phospho—D—glycerate
leads to its phosphorylation. On the other hand the reaction
involving EC:2.7.11.1 is thought to involve ~30% of all cellular
proteins (Cohen, 2000). Within our set of 585 enzymes, 401 (69%)
exhibit some degree of overlap between their positive and negative
alignments (Fig. 1). This suggests that homology—based methods
used to predict enzyme function could be improved through
accounting for such sequence similarity overlaps. Motivated by
these considerations, in the following section we describe to the
development of DETECT, a novel homology—based approach for
automated enzyme annotation.

3.2 Density estimation tool for enzyme classiﬁcation
(DETECT)

In the previous section, we noted that the distribution of alignment
scores may be used to discriminate members of enzyme families.
While score increases with the length alignment, it is not true that
the length of the enzyme is correlated to its sequence variability
(Supplementary Fig. S2). Consequently, it should be possible to
exploit these distributions to classify potentially unknown proteins.
For example, from Figure 1, we note that if a protein aligns to a
member of EC: 1 . 1 . 1 . 100 with a score between 200 and 600, there is a

Fig. 1. Boxplots show ranges of global sequence alignment scores for a representative set of 50 gold standard enzymes. Alignments scores were divided
into enzymes from the same EC category (blue) and enzymes from different EC categories (red). Enzymes are ordered by the percent overlap between the
interquartile ranges of the positive and negative hit scores. Boxplots close to the right side of the graph represent enzymes that are readily distinguishable on
the basis of sequence alignment scores. In contrast, enzymes closer to the left—hand side represent enzymes that are more difﬁcult to discriminate. The lower
graphs represent density distributions of alignment scores for three enzymes representing the cross—spectrum of enzyme diversity. Again, colours indicate
alignment scores to enzymes from the same EC category (blue) and different EC categories (red). The Table inset shows a summary of enzyme overlap in
global alignment scores that match the same EC (positive dataset) or a different EC (negative dataset). Overlap is averaged between positive and negative
datasets (i.e. 10% overlap means if score range was 500, then the overlap was 50). Numbers have been presented for enzymes that have been annotated for
at least 30 proteins. For further information see ‘Materials and Methods’ section.

level of uncertainty as to whether the protein belongs to that enzyme
class. Furthermore, as score increases, there is a corresponding
increase in conﬁdence associated with the classiﬁcation. Hence,
through comparing the distribution of alignment scores of an
unknown protein to the set of proteins associated with an enzyme
family in comparison to those not belonging to that family, it is
possible to obtain a probability of the unknown protein belonging
to that enzyme class. For example, given an alignment with a score
of 450, an unknown protein is more likely to belong to 1.1.1.100
than to another EC number since the score distribution of positive
alignments is denser than that of negative alignments. Conversely,
for an alignment with a score of 300, an unknown protein is unlikely
to belong to 1.1.1.100. Hence by incorporating information on the
sequence diversity across the various enzyme families, it is possible
to compute a probability score for the likely association of an
unknown protein to each enzyme family.

Based on these ideas, we have developed a novel algorithm, which
we term DETECT which applies a Bayesian statistical framework to
the enzyme density proﬁles generated above, to assign a probability
score to an enzyme annotation. For a query protein, 6}, a BLAST

search ﬁrst retrieves all matches of q to Swiss—Prot. For each
EC category within the set of matches, the Needleman—Wunsch
algorithm was used to generate global alignment scores between
qand each protein assigned that EC category. These scores are then
used to derive a pair of density estimation values from the density
distribution plot for that EC category generated earlier (Fig. 2A).
The two values correspond to the density of positive and negative
alignment scores previously generated for that EC category. Multiple
pairs of values generated from all matches to proteins from the
same EC category, are combined within a Bayesian framework,
to generate an integrated likelihood score (ILS) that q belongs to
that EC category. Brieﬂy, for each pair of scores, a likelihood score
is generated based on prior probabilities associated with that EC
category. The ﬁnal ILS is then obtained from the product of all
likelihood scores. See Materials and Methods for further details.
To evaluate performance, we compared DETECT with BLAST
and PSI—BLAST using 5—fold cross—validation to predict enzyme
activities for proteins in Swiss—Prot. Due to difﬁculties in
differentiating between enzymes with multiple catalytic sites and
those with a single catalytic site performing multiple types of

reactions, proteins assigned multiple EC categories were not
included. Applying a range of score cutoffs, DETECT predictions
were deﬁned as the EC category with the highest ILS; BLAST
and PSI—BLAST predictions were the highest scoring hit from the
training set. Proteins predicted to have two or more EC numbers
were not included in the performance analysis. DETECT and
BLAST were also evaluated based on the entire list of predictions
(not just top—scoring prediction). From the ROC curves in Figure 2B,
it is clear that the DETECT approach signiﬁcantly outperforms the
BLAST—based methods with greater sensitivity and speciﬁcity across
all score thresholds. The gain in performance when the entire list
of predictions is considered is almost negligible, illustrating the
discriminatory power of DETECT and highlighting the usefulness
of a ranked list of ILSs. In contrast, BLAST (similar to PSI—
BLAST) predict with much lower accuracy when the top—scoring
hit is considered.

3.3 Comparison to current prediction methods

One of the central aims of developing DETECT is to improve
the automated prediction of enzyme function from genomic
information. Here, we are interested in DETECT’s ability to

accurately predict metabolic enzymes from the annotated genome of
P. falciparum. To date, a number of resources have been constructed
that describe genome— scale reconstructions of enzyme complements.
For Pfalcipamm, these include KEGG (Kanehisa et al., 2007),
BioCyc (Caspi et al., 2007), BRENDA (Schomburg et al., 2004)
and the MPMP (Ginsburg, 2006). Each dataset exhibits a wide
range in coverage and accuracy, reﬂecting potential errors and biases
in their respective curations (Fig. 3). Due its high standard of
curation and coverage, we chose MPMP as a suitable baseline to
examine the performance of DETECT relative to the other resources,
simple BLAST analyses and predictions derived from a proﬁle—
based tool termed PRIAM (Claudel—Renard et al., 2003; Table 1

DETECT and BLAST are comparable due to the lack of a good
negative training set for P. falciparum. Consequently, the improved
speciﬁcity observed with Swiss—Prot for DETECT is difﬁcult to
assess. Of 765 proteins annotated with EC numbers by MPMP,
DETECT predicts activities for 622. Of these, 325 (52.3%) matched
the MPMP/BRENDA annotations. However, within this set of 622
proteins are 198 which are annotated by MPMP/BRENDA with EC
numbers not present within the set of 582 EC categories used by
the DETECT algorithm (Supplementary Table S2), ignoring these
increased correct predictions to 76.7%. Furthermore, considering
only predictions with an ILS in excess of 0.2 (a deﬁned cutoff,
providing a good compromise between speciﬁcity and sensitivity as
derived with reference to Fig. 2B), DETECT correctly predicts 246
of 276 proteins (89.1%). BLAST unsurprisingly provided a higher
number of matches—352 (58.4%) compared to DETECT. However,
PRIAM was found to correctly predict only 117 of the 424 proteins
annotated with one of the 582 EC categories, while KEGG and
BioCyc match 233 (55.0%) and 150 (35.4%), respectively. We also
performed a comparison to a generic automatic annotation tool based
on the transfer of Gene Ontology terms, Blast2GO (Conesa, 2005).

From the list of 276 proteins with DETECT ILS scores >02 and members of the 582 EC categories with :30 members, four were correctly identiﬁed by DETECT but not BLAST
(E-value <1), and 10 were correctly identiﬁed by BLAST but not DETECT. Grey backgrounds indicate predictions matching MPMP annotations. Positives and negatives indicate

the number of proteins used to formulate the DETECT prediction. Seven of the incorrect DETECT predictions were based on matches to less than ﬁve proteins.

Using MPMP as the gold standard, DETECT was found to have
signiﬁcantly greater accuracy and coverage than Blast2GO. Of the
301 Blast2GO annotations only 154 matched MPMP annotations
(51.1%) compared to an accuracy of 76.7% for DETECT (data not
shown).

Of the 246 DETECT predictions with an ILS>0.2, which match
MPMP/BRENDA annotations, four were incorrectly predicted by
BLAST (Table 2). These include MAL13P1.301 and PF11_0395,
annotated by MPMP as guanylyl cyclases (GCs — EC:4.6.1.2). GCs
are responsible for the synthesis of cyclic GMP, an important
secondary messenger molecule. In eukaryotes, GCs are highly
conserved and the presence of multiple isoforms is common. The
two Plasmodium GCs, however, are signiﬁcantly divergent from
mammalian homologues in both structure and function (Baker and
Kelly, 2004). In addition to containing two GC catalytic domains,
the sequences of MAL13P1.301 and PF11_0395 appear to have
regions similar to P—type ATPases (EC:3.6.3.—; Fig. 4). On the
basis of only local similarity, applying BLAST would incorrectly
assign these proteins to EC:3.6.3.1. On the other hand, from
Figure 4, we note the distributions of MAL13P1 .301 and PF11_0395
alignment scores to GCs produce signiﬁcantly greater overlap to the
positive distribution for EC:4.6.1.2 than for EC:3.6.3.1 resulting in
higher ILS’s (MAL13P1.301: ILS = 0.27 and 0.0024 for EC:4.6.1.2
and EC:3.6.3.1, respectively; PF11_039: ILS=0.91 and 0.55 for

EC:4.6.1.2 and EC:3.6.3.1, respectively). While a role for the
P—type ATPase domain has yet to be found, a previous study has
suggested the two isoforms of GC encode bifunctional enzymes
in Pfalcipamm (Carucci et al., 2000) The diverse nature of these
sequences relative to their hosts, suggests that these two GCs
may represent suitable targets for therapeutic intervention. The
serine/threonine—speciﬁc protein phosphatase (EC:3.1.3.16) activity
of PF10_0320, was also correctly predicted by DETECT but not by
BLAST. Such phosphatases have been shown to play an important
role both in parasite growth and development (Ward et al., 1994) and
also in the invasion process (Rangachari et al., 1986). The density
estimation proﬁles resulted in the assignment of a high probability
for EC:3.1.3.16 (ILS =0.94) relative to the top BLAST prediction
of EC:6.1.1.17 (ILS =10T5). Conversely, there were 10 examples
where BLAST but not DETECT correctly predicts enzyme function
(Table 2). Note that the majority of these proteins were correctly
predicted by DETECT based on the top 2nd hit, further supporting
the usefulness of having a ranked list of enzymes. Additionally,
while only two of 246 correct DETECT predictions had less than ﬁve
positive matches, we note that seven of the ten incorrect predictions
were based on fewer than ﬁve positive matches. This suggests
that the number of positive matches should be used as additional
criteria to ﬁlter DETECT predictions. Intriguingly, the remaining
three incorrect DETECT predictions were based on a large number

of positive sequence matches to their respective EC categories.
This might suggest that the MPMP annotations are incorrect. For
instance, PFB0505c is reported in PlasmoDB as a ,B—ketoacyl—
ACP synthase III (fabH; EC:2.3.1.180) but annotated by MPMP
as a ,B—ketoacyl—ACP synthase I (fabB; EC:2.3.1.41) and fatty—
acid synthase (FASN; EC:2.3.1.85). Based on a large number of
alignments to both EC:2.3.1. 180 and EC:2.3. 1.41, DETECT predicts
the gene to have FabH activity, whereas BLAST predicts it to
have FabB activity. Although FabH activity has been demonstrated
for P. falciparum (Waller et al., 1998), recent experimental studies
focusing on a putative FabB/F enzyme indicates that FabF and
not FabB activity is also present (Sharma et al., 2009). Another
potential misannotation involves PF13_0141, assigned L—lactate
dehydrogenase activity (LDH; EC:1.1.1.27) by MPMP but predicted
by DETECT to be malate dehydrogenase (MDH; EC:1.1.1.37).
In Plasmodium, LDH is an essential enzyme required for the
production of ATP (Gomez et al., 1997), while MDH plays a
crucial role in pathogenicity (Chan and Sim, 2004). Members of
both families have been characterized and sequenced from a wide
variety of organisms representative of all domains of life (Madern,
2002). While structurally distinct, MDH and LDH share signiﬁcant
sequence similarity. Furthermore, analysis of the MDH family
identiﬁed two distinct groups of closely related enzymes (Goward
and Nicholls, 1994), responsible for a bimodal distribution of within—
family alignment scores (Fig. 5). This is further supported by a group
of LDH members that share greater sequence similarity to the MDH
family than the rest of the LDH’s (Pazos et al., 2006). Based on
global alignments, PF13_0141 produces many signiﬁcant matches
to both LDH and MDH family members. Inspection of the resulting
density distribution proﬁles indicates a better ﬁt to the distribution of
positive alignment scores for EC:1.1.1.37 than that of EC:1.1.1.27
(Fig. 5), resulting in a higher ILS (0.97 versus 0.31). Interestingly, a
recent study uncovered additional MDH activity for the Plasmodium
LDH based on molecular function (Wiwanitkit, 2007), suggesting
that perhaps PF13_0141 has broad speciﬁcity.

3.4 Expanding the metabolome of P. falciparum

As noted above, BLAST proved to be very effective in conﬁrming
MPMP predictions. However, a major challenge in enzyme
annotation is to be able to discriminate false positive predictions. By
calculating an ILS that accounts for observed diversity in sequence
similarity distributions, DETECT provides a useful method for
the generation of ranked lists of enzyme predictions that can be
combined with metabolic network reconstruction (Caspi et al., 2007;
Kanehisa et al., 2007) methods to help prioritize candidate enzymes
for more detailed studies. Applied to Plasmodium, DETECT
predicts activities for an additional 2451 genes (Supplementary
Table S3). However, using an ILS > 0.2, relying on predictions
involving at least six positive sequence matches and ignoring
the highly promiscuous EC categories—2.7.11.1 (serine/threonine
kinase: 47 annotations), 2.7.13.3 (histidine kinase: 735 annotions)
and 2.7.7.6 (RNA polymerase: 70 annotations), results in a high
conﬁdence list of 88 predictions worthy of follow—up investigations.

The conserved Plasmodium protein of unknown function,
PF11_0207, is predicted by DETECT to be EC:5.99.1.2 (DNA
topoisomerase) with an ILS ~0.48. Biochemical evidence has been
found for topoisomerase (Topo) I and II in P. falciparum (Cheesman
et al., 1994; Tosh and Kilbey, 1995), and a number of putative
annotations for Topo are reported in PlasmoDB. BLAST, on the other
hand predicts PF11_0207 to be EC:6.5.1.1 (DNA ligase) with an
E —value <10T14. While many eukaryotes express three DNA ligase
isoforms, P. falciparum expresses only one (Cheesman et al., 1994).
The gene for the sole ligase, DNA ligase I, has been identiﬁed, and no
evidence suggests the presence of additional isoforms in the parasite.
The density proﬁle for PF11_0207 alignment scores against the
positive score distribution for EC:5.99.1.2 shows a large degree of
overlap, compared to a single alignment for EC:6.5.1.1, suggesting
a more likely membership to the Topo family (Supplementary
Fig. S3). The accurate identiﬁcation of the genes encoding Topo
may be important as studies have suggested that certain Topo II
poisons may act selectively against the human malaria parasite
(Chavalitshewinkoon et al., 1993; Gamage et al., 1994).

DETECT also serves to reinforce the predictions of existing tools
when searching for genes with unidentiﬁed enzyme activity. For
instance, PFIl475w, a merozoite surface protein, is predicted by
BLAST to be EC:3.1.11.6 (Exonuclease VII) with only moderate
statistical support (E—value <0.001). With an ILS~0.56, DETECT
also makes the same prediction, where analysis of the density proﬁle
for matching PFIl475w alignment scores against the positive score

DETECT and its application to P.fa|ciparum

 

distribution of EC:3.1.11.6 indicates a good ﬁt (Supplementary
Fig. S4). The putative Exonuclease VII has not been biochemically
characterized in Pfalciparum, but genes for Exonuclease I and III
have been identiﬁed, suggesting other exonucleases are yet to be
identiﬁed.

Even in instances of less than six positive matches, the ILS can
produce informative predictions. For example two genes annotated
with ‘unknown function’ are PFD0485w and PFL1535w, which
DETECT predicts to have glucose—6—phosphate isomerase (GPI)
activity (EC:5.3.1.9) with high conﬁdence scores of 0.90 and
0.91, respectively. One may dismiss these as spurious predictions
given that the experimentally characterized GPI (Srivastava et al.,
1992) has been annotated in Pfalciparum as PF14_0341. This
enzyme, which catalyzes the reversible conversion of glucose—6—
phosphate to fructose—6—phosphate, is necessary for glycolysis in
P. falciparum. As evidenced by the absence of mitochondrial activity
in the parasite (Mather et al., 2007), the energy needs of P. falciparum
are met entirely through the anaerobic consumption of exogenous
glucose. While PF14_0341 is the only gene that has been annotated
to have GPI activity, puriﬁcation studies detected the presence of
several isozymes in Pfalciparum (Srivastava et al., 1992). The
appearance of multiple isozymes is a common feature for Plasmodial
glycolytic enzymes (Maeda et al., 2009) suggesting that PFD0485w
and PFL1535w may represent isozymes for GPI. Global alignments
of PFD0485w and PFL1535w to non—Plasmodium members of the
GPI family have optimal scores based on their ﬁt to the positive
distribution for EC:5.3.1.9 (Supplementary Fig. S5).

Finally, in cases where enzyme activity may be expected (e. g.
through biochemical assays or hole ﬁlling algorithms), DETECT
provides a powerful approach to identify and prioritize candidate
proteins that may be at the extreme of sequence homology
detection. The MPMP database identiﬁes 428 enzyme categories,
of which 404 have been annotated to one or more proteins.
Of the remaining categories, DETECT predicts a protein for four
although all with low ILSs: EC:1.1.1.25 (PF14_0424, ILS ~10‘7),
EC:1.4.4.2 (PFL2095w, ILS ~0.001), EC:2.7.1.23 (PF106500,
ILS ~0.001) and EC:3.6.1.1 (PF14_0541; PFL1700c; PF11_0190;
and PF11_0202, ILS:1; 1; ~0.003; ~0.0006, respectively).
PF14_0541 and PFL1700c are both annotated in PlasmoDB as
putative V—type H+—translocating pyrophosphatases, conﬁrming
the DETECT predictions, but currently lack the appropriate EC
designation. As a component of the shikimate pathway, not
present in mammals EC:1.1.1.25 (shikimate dehydrogenase) is of
particular interest from a drug target point of view. Evidence
for the requirement of the shikimate pathway was originally
provided by isolation of Pfalciparum mutants requiring pABA for
growth (McConkey et al., 1994). While the presence of shikimate
dehydrogenase has been reported at very low levels in P. falciparum,
no protein has previously been identiﬁed. Although possessing only
a low ILS, PF14_0424, produces reasonable alignments to the active
site of three shikimate dehydrogenase proteins found in bacteria
(Supplementary Fig. S6). As such, PF14_0424 represents a suitable
target for conﬁrming shikimate dehydrogenase activity.

3.5 Applications and future work

By focusing on P. falciparum as a model organism, we have shown
that sequence diversity is an important factor in the accurate
identiﬁcation of enzymes. Through providing a ranked list of ILSs,

DETECT facilitates the prioritization of potential novel enzymes
that can help guide species—speciﬁc metabolic reconstructions. A
future goal is to apply DETECT to the prediction of multifunctional
enzymes. Current Swiss—Prot annotations indicate that there are over
4000 proteins that catalyze more than one reaction. A potential
approach involves assessing all high—scoring predictions made by
DETECT and examining the potential of multiple catalytic domains
within the protein of interest.

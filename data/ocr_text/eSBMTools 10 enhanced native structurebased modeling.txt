ABSTRACT

Motivation: Molecular dynamics simulations provide detailed insights
into the structure and function of biomolecular systems. Thus, they
complement experimental measurements by giving access to experi-
mentally inaccessible regimes. Among the different molecular dy-
namics techniques, native structure-based models (SBMs) are based
on energy landscape theory and the principle of minimal frustration.
Typically used in protein and RNA folding simulations, they coarse-
grain the biomolecular system and/or simplify the Hamiltonian resulting
in modest computational requirements while achieving high agreement
with experimental data. eSBMTooIs streamlines running and evaluating
SBM in a comprehensive package and offers high flexibility in adding
experimental- or bioinformatics-derived restraints.

Results: We present a software package that allows setting up, mod-
ifying and evaluating SBM for both RNA and proteins. The imple-
mented workflows include predicting protein complexes based on
bioinformatics-derived inter-protein contact information, a standar-
dized setup of protein folding simulations based on the common
PDB format, calculating reaction coordinates and evaluating the simu-
lation by free-energy calculations with weighted histogram analysis
method or by phi-values. The modules interface with the molecular
dynamics simulation program GROMACS. The package is open
source and written in architecture-independent Python2.

1 INTRODUCTION

Energy landscape theory and the principle of minimal frustration
stipulate that biomolecular evolution results in an effective over-
all bias of a macromolecule’s energy landscape being funnel-
shaped toward its global minimum at the native folded state
(Onuchic and Wolynes, 2004; Schug and Onuchic, 2010).
Native structure-based models (SBMs, also often referred to as
Go-models) realize an idealized minimally frustrated folding
funnel devoid of any energetic traps by a simple Hamiltonian
(Clementi et al., 2000; Whitford et al., 2009) that allows molecu-
lar dynamics simulations to reach biologically relevant timescale.

The SBM potential is based on the native folded structure and
native contact information. The number of formed native con-
tacts in a structure is the dominant reaction coordinate typically
called Q. The Q value can be used as a reaction coordinate to
investigate folding paths or as an order parameter for the
weighted histogram analysis method (Kumar et al., 1992).

The SBM can be combined with coarse-graining approaches.
Proteins can be represented by single beads at the positions of
their Ca atoms. Accordingly, there exist formulations of the
SBM at an all-atom Whitford et al., 2009) and Ca (Clementi
et al., 2000) graining level (see Supplementary Information).
Bioinformatics-derived contact information (Schug et al., 2009)
or experimental measurements Whitford et al., 2011) can be
added as restraints to SBM.

Eventually, the SBM deﬁnes a force ﬁeld that results in com-
putationally tractable simulations that facilitate simulations on
the effective timescale of seconds (for small proteins even on
single CPUs) in combination with extensive sampling. Existing
web-based solutions like the SMOG—server (Noel et al., 2010)
allow a straightforward setup and evaluation of standard
SBM. Our open source eSBMTools extends the customization
options enabling the setup of automatized workﬂows and strong
modiﬁcations of SBM by, e.g. adding arbitrary additional con-
tacts, protein/ RNA structures, novel ligand topologies or manip-
ulating force ﬁeld parameters.

2 FUNCTIONALITY

eSBMTools is organized in modules that can be loaded into
Python projects. The modules and their input and output ﬁles
interface with tools that are part of the standard GROMACS
software package (Hess et al., 2008). It can be used at all stages in
the context of SBM simulations: from generating the SBM itself,
over manipulations of the model and conﬁguration ﬁle gener-
ation, to extensive post-processing of simulation data. Several
examples can be found in the Supplementary Information.

The SBM is generated starting from a PDB structure with the
help of an XML-based topology deﬁnition that introduced the
bonded interactions Via bonds, angles and dihedral angles.
eSBMTools provides topology deﬁnitions for DNA/RNA or
protein systems in an all-atom or a Ca formulation. The XML
format allows the user to easily extend the existing topology
deﬁnitions by custom additions of arbitrary ligands or experi-
mental markers (for example F RET—ﬁuorosphores). The non-
bonded interactions Via inter-atomic contacts are implemented
by a simple cut-off formulation. Two atoms are considered to
form a contact when the distance between the atoms is below

Residue i

Fig. 1. Contact maps of protein HigA in the standard homogeneous
formulation and the Miyazawa—Jernigan formulation. Each square
stands for a contact between residue i and j in the native structure of
H igA. The upper left contact map represents the homogeneous energetics
of the standard SBM formulation. However, the lower right contact map
illustrates the possibility of weighting each native contact by Miyazawa—
Jernigan factors (Miyazawa and Jernigan, 1996)

a certain threshold. A contact map represents every contact
between two atoms by an entry, as in Figure 1.

The generated SBM can be modiﬁed according to the require-
ments of the user’s system of interest. The contact information
can be manipulated to include, e. g. predicted contacts (Dago
et al., 2012; Morcos et al., 2011) or the energetics of all contacts
can be re-weighted by, e.g. by amino acid interaction matrices
(Miyazawa and Jernigan, 1996), shown in Figure 1.

Two SBMs can be merged to set up combined systems for,
e. g. complex formation simulations (Schug et al., 2009). Once all
the ﬁles that describe the system of interest are prepared,
eSBMTools generates the required conﬁguration ﬁles for
GROMACS simulations. This generation can be customized
within Python to adjust simulation parameters, e. g. temperature,
duration or resolution to steer simulations within a workﬂow.

The simulation output by GROMACS can be processed in
various ways depending on the desired evaluation protocol.
The root-mean-square deviations along the trajectory of the
simulation can be generated and included in further post-
processing. Similarly, the Q values (the number of formed
native contacts) can be generated from a trajectory. The Q
values can be used to generate time-depending contact maps or
ﬁltered by certain ranges to follow the folding process of sub-
structures within the system of interest. Based on histograms of
Q values, it is possible to calculate g) values (Fersht and Sato,
2004) that give a measure for a residue’s stability in the transition
state. eSBMTools can also be used to perform a more demand-
ing analysis of Q value and energy histograms: the weighted
histogram analysis method (Kumar et al., 1992). This method
yields the free-energy landscape AG(Q, T) over the sampled Q
values and a chosen temperature range, based on a ﬁnite number
of simulations at distinct temperatures, preferably around the

folding temperature. In addition, it is possible to calculate the
heat capacity over the temperature range, which allows the user
to determine the folding temperature.

3 CONCLUSIONS

We present the full release version of our Python2-based soft-
ware package for SBM simulation pre- and post-processing. The
package provides a comprehensive tool box to perform and
evaluate simulations in the ﬁeld of SBMs. The open source pack-
age interfaces with a standard build of the GROMACS software
suite, which is a state-of—the—art software for molecular dynamics
simulations. The combination of a high-performance simulation
software with a user-deﬁned Python2 framework makes
eSBMTools versatile yet compact. Computationally tractable
SBM can be set up in a platform-independent manner as work-
ﬂows for extensive sampling on both HPC systems and local
computers.

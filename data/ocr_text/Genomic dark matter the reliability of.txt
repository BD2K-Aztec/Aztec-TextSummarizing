ABSTRACT

Motivation: Genome resequencing and short read mapping are two
of the primary tools of genomics and are used for many important
applications. The current state-of-the-art in mapping uses the quality
values and mapping quality scores to evaluate the reliability of
the mapping. These attributes, however, are assigned to individual
reads and do not directly measure the problematic repeats across
the genome. Here, we present the Genome Mappability Score
(GMS) as a novel measure of the complexity of resequencing a
genome. The GMS is a weighted probability that any read could be
unambiguously mapped to a given position and thus measures the
overall composition of the genome itself.

Results: We have developed the Genome Mappability Analyzer
to compute the GMS of every position in a genome. |t leverages
the parallelism of cloud computing to analyze large genomes, and
enabled us to identify the 5—14% of the human, mouse, fly and yeast
genomes that are difficult to analyze with short reads. We examined
the accuracy of the widely used BWA/SAMtools polymorphism
discovery pipeline in the context of the GMS, and found discovery
errors are dominated by false negatives, especially in regions with
poor GMS. These errors are fundamental to the mapping process
and cannot be overcome by increasing coverage. As such, the GMS
should be considered in every resequencing project to pinpoint the
‘dark matter’ of the genome, including of known clinically relevant
variations in these regions.

1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background

DNA sequencing technology has dramatically improved in the
past decade so that today an individual human genome can be
sequenced for less than $10 000 and in less than 2 weeks (Drmanac
et al., 2010), compared to years of effort and hundreds of millions
of dollars for the ﬁrst sequenced human genome (Stein, 2010).
This dramatic improvement has lead to an exponential growth in

sequencing, including several large projects to sequence thousands
of human genomes and exomes, such as the (1000 Genomes Project
Consortium, 2010) or (International Cancer Genome Consortium,
2010). Other projects, such as (ENCODE Project Consortium,
2004) and (modENCODE Consortium, 2010), are extensively using
resequencing and read mapping to discover novel genes and binding
sites.

The output of current DNA sequencing instruments consists of
billions of short, 25—200 bp sequences of DNA called reads, with
an overall per base error rate around 1—2% (Bentley et al., 2008).
In the case of whole genome resequencing, these short reads will
originate from random locations in the genome, but nevertheless,
entire genomes can be accurately studied by oversampling the
genome, and then aligning or ‘mapping’ each read to the reference
genome to computationally identify where it originated. Once the
entire collection of reads has been mapped, variations in the sample
can be identiﬁed by the pileup of reads that signiﬁcantly disagree
from the reference genome (Fig. 1).

The leading short read mapping algorithms, including BWA (Li
and Durbin, 2009), Bowtie (Langmead et al., 2009), and SOAP (Li
et al., 2009b), all try to identify the best mapping position for each
read that minimizes the number of differences between the read and
the genome, i.e. the edit distance of the nucleotide strings, possibly
weighted by base quality value. This is made practical through
sophisticated indexing schemes, such as the Burrows—Wheeler
transform (Burrows and Wheeler, 1994), so that many billions of
reads can be efﬁciently mapped allowing for both sequencing errors
and true variations. The primary complication of short read mapping
is that a read may map equally well or nearly equally well to multiple
positions because of repetitive sequences in the genome. Notably,
nearly 50% of the human genome consists of repetitive elements,
including certain repeats that occur thousands of times throughout
(International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium, 2001).

For resequencing projects, the fraction of repetitive content
depends on read length and allowed error rate. At one extreme,
all single base reads would be repetitive, while chromosome
length reads would not be repetitive at all. Similarly, increasing
the allowed error rate increases the fraction of the genome that is
repetitive. The short read mapping algorithms use edit distance
and other read characteristics to compute a mapping quality score
for each mapped read (Li et al., 2008). The mapping quality
score estimates the probability that the assigned location is the
correct position given the edit—distance of the alignment relative
to the edit—distance of alternate alignments. This metric advanced
the state—of—the—art for resequencing studies because then the
variation discovery algorithms and other post—mapping algorithms

Fig. 1. The top sequence represents the reference genome, with many individual reads mapped to the sequence beneath. The left highlighted column illustrates
a homozygous substitution and the right highlighted column illustrates a heterozygous substitution. Two green reads are same sequence, which means the
read can be mapped to multiple position. Consequently the origination is ambiguous

could use this score to rule out false—positive variations caused
by incorrectly mapped reads. However, as we show below, this
metric is very sensitive to small changes in read positions or
read qualities. Furthermore, it does not measure the ‘mappability’
of the genome itself to show where reads can be conﬁdently
mapped, only the conﬁdence of individual reads that have
already been mapped. There have been a few attemps to deﬁne
mappability, focusing on the uniqueness of ﬁxed length kmers
(http://genomebrowser.wustl.edu/cgi—bin/hgTrackUi?db=hg1 8&g=
ngncodeMapability) or uniqueness of kmers allowing a small
number of differences (Koehler et al., 2010). However, these
metrics do not fully capture all of the experimental conditions of a
sequencing experiment, such as read length, error rate, error type
or library characteristics.

Addressing these limitations, we have developed the Genome
Mappability Analyzer (GMA) pipeline that leverages the mapping
quality score and other metrics into a new probabilistic metric
called the Genome Mappability Score (GMS). The GMS measures
the inherent uncertainty of mapping reads to each position in the
genome as a weighted probability of mapping certainty. We have
applied the GMA to compute the GMS proﬁle for several important
genomes under a variety of experimental parameters to measure
the relative effect in mappability with respect to read length, error
rate and sample preparation. In further experiments, we relate the
GMS proﬁle to the accuracy of the widely used BWA/SAMtools
single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) discovery algorithm. Our
experiments show that, even at very high coverage of the genome,
most variation discovery errors are false negatives and most of
these errors occur in regions with low GMS values. Furthermore,
virtually all mutations reported by the 1000 Genomes project (1000
Genomes Project Consortium, 2010) exist within high GMS regions
of the genome, and almost none in low GMS regions. These results
highlight the signiﬁcance of the GMS as it quantiﬁes and identiﬁes
the substantial fraction of genome for which resequencing cannot
conﬁdently identify variations or conﬁdently measure biological
activity. This genomic ‘dark matter’ should be taken into account
in every resequencing study, especially when evaluating size or
distribution of the discovered variations.

1.2 Mapping quality scores

The primary complication in short read mapping is that the true
position of the read may be ambiguous if the read maps equally well
to multiple positions. This is primarily due to repetitive sequences,
but true variations and sequencing errors may also obscure where
the read originated. If this ambiguity is not detected, reads will

be frequently mis—mapped to the wrong location in the genome,
potentially leading to the false discovery of variations at positions
that do not have any variations or other mis—interpretations of the
mapping. This complication lead to the development of the mapping
quality score, initially presented by (Li et al., 2008) and also widely
adopted in SAMtools (Li et al., 2009a), BWA, and several other
leading short read analysis programs.

The mapping quality score Q5 of an alignment is a probabilistic
measure that a read is correctly mapped. It is typically expressed
in Phred—scaled form as shown in equation 1, where pS is the
posterior probability that the read originates at position u, L: |x|
is the length of the reference genome x and l = lzl is a length
of a read z. Accordingly, higher values of Q5 represents a more
conﬁdent alignment, and the mapping quality score Q5 will be lower
or zero for reads that could be mapped to multiple locations with
nearly the same number of mismatches. The probability of observing
the particular read alignment, p(z|x,u), is deﬁned as the product
of the probability of errors recorded in the quality values of the
bases that disagree with the reference sequence. The posterior error
probability 19s is therefore minimized when the alignment with the
fewest mismatches is selected.

Mapping quality scores are now commonly computed by the
alignment algoirthms, using various heuristics for efﬁcency such
as only considering alignments within a certain edit distance of the
minimum. The mapping quality scores are also extensively used by
the variation detection algorithms, such as the SAMtools algorithms,
to ﬁlter out low conﬁdence mapped reads and largely prevents false—
positive variation discovery. However, the mapping quality score is
very sensitive to minute changes to read position and trimming a
read by as little as two bases can lower a high—conﬁdence mapping
into a zero conﬁdence mapping if those two bases were used to
‘anchor’ the alignment to unique sequence (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Furthermore, the mapping quality score is limited in that it measures
the reliability of the mapped reads only, but does not directly identify
the problematic repeats in the genome.

What is needed is a metric that integrates the mapping quality
score of all possible reads at a given position and a process for
building a proﬁle of this metric throughout the genome to provide a
global perspective. ENCODE and the ‘Uniqueome’ as proposed by

scores for all possible reads related to speciﬁc position

(Koehler et al., 2010), use exact matching krners or krners allowing
a small number of differences to measure if individual subsequences
of the genome can be uniquely mapped. However, these two methods
for measuring mappability are problematic because they do not
consider full—length reads, paired end reads, multiple read lengths,
error rates or other sequence characteristics. They also use very
basic methods to combine the uniqueness of individual kmers to
compute a score at a given position in the genome. Furthermore,
no published study has been performed to correlate these metrics
with the accuracy of variation discovery algorithms except for a
few anecdotal examples.

2 METHODS

2.1 Genome mappability score

Here in, we introduce a new probabilistic metric called the GMS that builds
on the mapping quality scores to build a proﬁle of certainty of mapping reads
across the genome. The core of the GMS is to consider all possible reads up to
a ﬁxed coverage level C spanning every position in the genome, as illustrated
in Figure 2. For the speciﬁc position >l< sequenced using l—bp reads, there
will be 1 possible reads spanning, each with a potentially different mapping
probability ps(u|x,z). The GMS is the average mapping probability of these
spanning reads as deﬁned in equation 3. In this way, the GMS is the expected
mapping probability of any read: a value of 100% means the base can be
precisely mapped by any spanning read, and if the GMS is zero, it cannot
be reliably mapped by any read. Unlike the mapping quality score, which is
assigned to individual reads, the GMS is computed for every position, and is
robust to biases in coverage or quality values that may artiﬁcially reduce the
mapping quality score. The GMS is also naturally extended to consider other
experimental conditions such as the error rate or insert size for paired—end
sequencing by simulating reads with these characteristics.

To illustrate the utility of the GMS, consider mapping 100 bp error—free
reads drawn from a sequence consisting of 1000 consecutive A nucleotides,
followed by a unique 1000 bp sequence found in the human genome. When
mapping those reads, it is ambiguous where reads that fully originate from
the ﬁrst 1000 bp should be mapped and conversely, it is certain where reads
that originate from the last 1000 bp should be mapped. When mapping the
simulated reads with BWA, we ﬁnd that indeed, reads fully from the unique
sequence are given high—mapping quality score, and reads fully from the
repeat have zero mapping quality score as shown in Figure 3. However,
the mapping quality score computed by BWA shows an extremely sharp
transition with just one intermediate quality score for the read that spans the
boundary starting with 20A’s. In contrast, the GMS proﬁle follows a more
gradual transition between the two extremes as a progressively larger fraction
of reads can be unambiguously mapped across the transition.

Furthermore, Supplementary Figure S4 shows a similar experiment where
instead of using simulated reads with a 0% error rate, we repeat the
experiment using a 2% error rate. Around position 1030, a base variation
was randomly simulated which caused the mapping quality score drop to
zero. In contrast, the GMS remains relatively stable with a value just below
100% meaning that almost every read can be unambiguously mapped near
this potential mutation.

2.2 Genome mappability analyzer

The GMA is our pipeline for computing a proﬁle of the GMS of a reference
genome. GMA can be run in serial on a local machine and also in parallel on
a cloud (Section 2.3). For small genomes, local execution is recommended,
while the cloud version is recommended for genomes larger than 10 Mbp
because the runtime is proportional to the genome size times the read length.

The input for the GMA is the selected reference genome sequence
formatted in a regular FASTA ﬁle, and as output records a proﬁle of the GMS
for each position in a tab—delimitated format similar to UCSC WIG format.
The pipeline consists of a read simulator, read mapping tool, information
extractor and analyzer (Supplementary Fig. S5). The read simulator generates
reads from the reference genome in FASTQ ﬁles using the parameters for:
(i) read length, (ii) error model, (iii) single or paired—end sequencing, (iv) the
insert size if paired—end and (v) coverage. By default, the coverage is set to be
the same as the read length, but this can be reduced to lower levels, especially
for very long reads. The coverage parameter should be set substantially higher
than the sequencing coverage so that the GMS value has a large sample of
reads at every position. In general, the coverage can safely be set to 100—fold
coverage when evaluating reads > 100 bp, because every position will still be
sampled 100 different times. Next, the GMA aligns the simulated reads to an
indexed version of the genome using BWA or BWA—SW for long reads, and
outputs the result in SAM format. The GMA then uses SAMtools to interpret
the alignment ﬁles and passes the read map positions and mapping quality
scores to the extractor, which summarizes the mapping information for the
analyzer. Finally, the analyzer sorts the mapping information and scans the
values to compute the GMS for every position of the reference genome.

At this point, two questions can be naturally raised: (i) Why use simulated
reads? and (ii) Why is BWA used instead of another short read mapping
algorithm?

For the ﬁrst question, the pre—condition for computing the GMS across
the genome is that all possible reads should be considered at every possible
starting position, and the correct mapping location for every read is known.
Given a 100—bp read length, the GMA simulator generates uniform 100—fold
coverage, with the speciﬁed error model and library sizes. The origin of every
read is recorded so that any mismapped reads can be incorporated into the
GMS score by ensuring their mapping quality score is 0. These goals are not
achievable using reads from a sequencer. In a real sequencing experiment,
the coverage varies approximately according to a Poisson distribution, and to
guarantee 100—fold coverage would require substantially higher sequencing
and costs (Supplementary Fig. S2). More signiﬁcantly, reads originating from
poorly mappable regions will be hard or impossible to correctly assess, which
is precisely the quality we wish to measure with the GMS. Therefore, the
GMS uses simulated reads so that it can guarantee 100—fold coverage and
know exactly where in the genome the read originated from. In addition,
with the simulator, we have full control over all experimental parameters
and can evalute different sequencing conditions in silico.

Another important question is why BWA should be selected over other
mapping programs. Holtgrewe et al. (2011) benchmarked the most reputable
mapping tools and ranked their performance. They reported that BWA and
Shrimp2 outperformed Bowtie and SOAP2, especially because the results
for Bowtie and SOAP2 ﬂuctuated considerably by error rates and read
length. BWA is very fast, maps both short reads and long reads, reads
with mismatches and indels and computes the mapping quality score of
alignments, and has thus become the read mapping algorithm of choice for
many resequencing projects.

position drastically changes the mapping quality score, while the GMS increases much more gradually. 100—bp error free reads are used

2.3 Cloud-scale GMA

Running GMA on a local machine is sufﬁcient for small genomes such
as microbes and small eukaryotes, but a cloud computing environment is
strongly recommended for larger genomes, especially because the amount
of data that GMA processes is substantial. For example, proﬁling the 3 Gbp
human genome with 100 bp reads requires at least 300 Gbp of intermediate
sequence. Therefore, we have designed the GMA for scale using Hadoop
to distribute computations across many computers in parallel. MapReduce
(Dean and Ghemawat, 2004) is patented by Google and only available
internally, but Hadoop is an open—source implementation in Java, and
provides many of the same basic functions and abstractions of MapReduce,
making it a popular choice for the research community. Furthermore, Hadoop
is becoming a de facto standard for large—data analysis and has proven to be
very successful for research in computational biology (Schatz et al., 2010).

The overall design of the cloud—enabled GMA pipeline is generally the
same as the local version, except it partitions the genome into partially
overlapping regions that are scanned on different machines in parallel, paying
special attention to the boundary and overlap between regions (Fig. 4). Since
Hadoop divides input ﬁles based on lines, GMA preprocesses the genome
into lines with 5000—7000 bp so that each line overlaps the next by 500—
700 bp as needed by the selected parameters. As a Hadoop/MapReduce
program, each map task then processes as input one or more overlapping
lines of sequence from the reference genome, which are then combined into
a reference genome segment. Then within the mapper, the read simulator
simulates reads in FASTQ format as is done for the local process using the
speciﬁed parameters list above. Then these simulated reads are mapped to
the entire indexed reference genome using the short read mapper BWA as
before. To save space, GMA extracts just the required ﬁelds from each SAM
record and are then output as key—value pairs using the chromosome region
as the key. These outputs are then shufﬂed and sorted by Hadoop to collect all
alignments that map to a given region of the genome. The reducers compute
the GMS at each position and outputs the results to ﬁles in the HDFS.

The runtime performance of GMA in a Hadoop environment depends
primarily on how many cores can be used, how much memory and
hard disk space is available and the interconnect between the machines.
For this analysis, we used a Hadoop cluster at Cold Spring Harbor
Laboratory (CSHL), which consists of 12 nodes connected by gigabit
ethemet, with a total of 48 cores, supporting 96 threads simultaneous tasks
with hyperthreading. Each machine has 24 GB memory and 4 TB storage for
the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)(Shvachko et al., 2010) running
under Hadoop version is 0.20 on CentOS Linux 5.5. The Hadoop pool is
conﬁgured to allow for 48 mappers and 48 reducers to run simultaneously.

3 RESULTS
3.1 GMS proﬁles

Computing the GMS proﬁle of the human genome is necessary for
human resequencing projects to pinpoint the regions of the genome
that can and cannot be reliably mapped. Beyond the human genome,
researchers may be interested in the GMS proﬁle of other model
organisms such as mouse, ﬂy and yeast. Fortunately, the GMA makes
it straightforward to compute the GMS proﬁle of any reference
sequence under a variety of experimental conditions.

We computed the GMS proﬁles with common Illumina
resequencing parameters of a 100 bp unpaired library and 100 bp
paired—end reads from a 300 bp library. Both libraries used a 2% error
rate for analyzing the human genome and three important model
organisms: yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) fruit ﬂy (Drosophila
melanogaster) and mouse (Mus museums). The results of the
analysis are displayed in Table 1, and show that 87—95% of these
genome sequences are ‘highly mappable’ meaning the GMS is at
least 50%. Yeast at 1/600 the size of the human genome has the
highest fraction of high GMS bases, because it has the fewest
repeats. Furthermore, 94.5—97.5% of the transcribed sequences of
these species are highly mappable. The remaining fraction with
low GMS values will be difﬁcult or impossible to measure using
today’s sequencing technologies. Moreover the fraction of highly
mappable bases is robust to the threshold on GMS used to deﬁne
highly mappable (Figure S5). We also computed the GMS proﬁle
of the 160 Mbp genome of the human pathogen Trichomonas
vaginalis (Carlton et al., 2007), which is one of the mostly highly
repetitive genomes sequenced to date. This shows that despite having
a relatively small genome size, 33% of the genome has a GMS below
10, and over 50% of the genome has a GMS below 50 (Table S1).
As such, it will be extremely difﬁcult to resequence the genome and
conﬁdently discover variations.

3.2 Parameters to mappability

In addition to measuring the GMS proﬁle with a given experimental
design, the GMA can be rerun multiple times with alternate settings
to examine the tradeoffs of read length, error rate, mate—pairs, etc.

This is important when starting to resequence a genome, as the
parameters needed to sequence the entire genome or regions of
interest with high conﬁdence will be unknown. The design needed
for genomes like T. vaginalis will be substantially different then
those needed to resequence the human genome which are different
than those needed for yeast. These tradeoffs will, in turn, determine
the cost or scope of the project, as sequencing costs depend on the
length of the read and the size of mate—pairs.

Paired—end sequencing allows more highly reliable mapping than
unpaired sequencing (Supplementary Figure S6), so we use paired—
end sequencing for all other experiments in this article unless
speciﬁed. Another signiﬁcant parameter for the GMS proﬁle is the
read length, as this greatly inﬂuences the fraction of genome that is
repetitive: very short reads will be much more repetitive than long—
reads. For example, Figure 5 shows the GMS proﬁle of a 1000 bp
region of human chromosome X using 50 bp (red) and 100 bp (blue)
reads and shows much more of the region can be unambiguously
mapped with 100 bp reads compared to 50 bp reads. Here, just a
small region is shown, but the GMA allows one to exactly measure
this tradeoff across any region of interest or even the whole genome
to see if the extra sequencing cost is justiﬁed.

Furthermore, there is an inverse relationship between error rate
and average GMS. Figure 6 shows the relationship between error
rate and GMS proﬁle using three different error rates for a 10 000 bp

overall trends are very consistent, which means the GMS is generally
robust to the speciﬁc errors introduced by the GMA.

3.3 Technologies to mappability

The previous analyses have focused on sequencing parameters for
projects utilizing Illumima sequencing. However, the GMS can play
an important role at evaluating the information gains using other
sequencing technologies, and measure the fraction of the genome
that is accessible using one technology over another. To do so,
we evaluated the GMS proﬁle of the reference human genome
(hg19) using the sequencing characteristics of several different
platforms: SOLiD, Illumina, Ion Torrent (Rothberg et al., 2011),
Roche 454 (Gilles et al., 2011) and Paciﬁc Biosciences (Grad
et al., 2012). When evaluating PacBio sequencing, we considered
both the raw sequencing error rate produced by the instrument
and the characteristics after applying the PacBio error correction
(PacBio EC) (Koren et al., 2012). For each of these technologies,
we evaluated their GMS proﬁle for 100—fold single end coverage (75—
fold coverage for SOLiD), using their typical read length and error
model as reported in the literature. For example, SOLiD and Illumina
sequencing tend to have mostly substitution errors and negligible
indel errors, while the other platforms have higher rates of indels.
For SOLiD sequencing, we considered nucleotide reads rather than
color space reads, since we wished to capture the information content
and mappability of the genome rather than the capacity to correct
errors.

Table 2 shows the error characteristics and read lengths used for
each sequencing technology, along with the fraction of the genome
that has either a low or high GMS value (runtime performance is
shown in Supplementary Table S 1). The general trend was the longer
the read length, the greater the fraction of the genome had a high
GMS value. The notable exception is the pre—error corrected PacBio—
like reads, which scores 100% low GMS values. This is because the
error rate was so high, and the base quality values are so poor that
the mapping quality scores were always extremely low. This can be
improved by optimizing the alignment algorithm to tolerate a higher
rate of errors and especially more indels. In fact, by adjusting the
BWA alignment parameters to reduce the gap opening and extension
penalties (—b5 —q2 —r1 —z10) as recommended by the BWA author,
the mappability substantially improves. For example, with these
parameters, the high GMS region improves from 0% to 63.7% along
chr22, compared to 65.1% for Illumina—like and 67.4% for PacBio
EC—like. With additional algorithm optimizations, the mappability
of the uncorrected Pacbio reads may approach those of the 454—like
or even the PacBio EC—like values. In contrast, the error corrected
PacBio reads had the most high GMS bases of any technology, and
represents the upperbound on what could be achieved with the pre—
error corrected reads. Interestingly, even 2000 bp is not long enough
to make the entire genome highly mappable.

3.4 Variation discovery and ‘dark matter’

Many genomics project are using DNA resequencing to identify
SNPs and other mutations to explain differences among people or
among healthy and disease phenotypes. One of the most widely used
pipelines for discovering sequencing variations is to use BWA for
short read mapping and then SAMtools/B CFTools for calling SNPs
and other variations from the pileup of reads. Given sufﬁciently deep
coverage of the samples, the accuracy of this pipeline is generally

In general, the longer the read length, the greater the fraction of the genome which can

quite high, but we have identiﬁed a substantial dark matter fraction
of the genome with very poor accuracy using our Variation Accuracy
Simulator (VAS).

3.4.] Variation accuracy simulator The VAS is implemented
with the GMA pipeline and auxiliary tools to explore the relation
between variation detection and GMS. The VAS is a pipeline
consisting of (i) genome mutator and reads simulator (WGSIM,
distributed with SAMtools, (ii) read mapping program (BWA),
(iii) SAM format interpreter (SAMtools), (iv) SNP—calling program
(BCFtools, distributed with SAMtools) and (v) the analyzer that
compares the output of the SNP—calling program to the set of
variations introduced into the genome (Supplementary Figure S8).

In the experiment, we examined using typical Illumina sequencing
reads chromosome X (173M) of hg19, the 8th largest genome
and linked to many inherited genetic diseases. The ﬁrst step was
to introduce random artiﬁcial mutations into the reference using
WGSIM with the default .1% mutation rate of which 10% will
be insertion/deletion (indel) mutations. These variations occur at
roughly the same rate as occur between randomly selected humans
and are recorded to a ﬁle to be used as our gold standard reference
set of variations. We also use WGSIM to simulate sequencing reads
from the mutated genome using typical parameters of 100 bp paired—
end reads from a 500 bp insert library. For sequencing error rates
(option ‘—e’), we ran VAS for two error rates: 2%, a common error
rate for 100—bp reads, and 0% as an idealized control group so we
can factor out base errors as the source of false—positive or false—
negative variation discovery. We can instead conclude if variation
cannot be discovered with a 0% error rate, it must be because of low
reliability of the mapping quality scores.

Table 3 shows the results of the experiment using simulated 30—
fold coverage and 0% sequencing error rate. The overall variation
detection accuracy is very high, and is 4—5 times as high (98.96%)

in high GMS regions compared to low GMS regions (20.45%). The
detection failure errors are dominated by false negatives, which
means the SNP calling program fails to ﬁnd such variations. In
particular, among all 5022 false negatives, 3505 (70%) are located
in low GMS region, and only 1517 (30%) are in high GMS region.
Considering only 13 and 14% of human genome is low GMS
region, variations in low GMS regions are clearly and substantially
overrepresented. It is not surprising that errors are dominated by
false negatives, as the SNP—calling algorithm will use the mapping
quality score to ﬁlter out low conﬁdence mapping. What is surprising
is the extent of false negatives and the concentration of false
negatives almost entirely within low GMS regions.

3.4.2 Genomic dark matter False negatives are typically caused
when the variation is not sufﬁciently sampled by enough reads,
especially in light of the expected Poisson distribution in coverage.
To measure this effect, we repeated the experiment at 10 coverage
levels: 2, 3, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 and 70—fold in order to observe
how coverage contributes to variation detection errors even though
60 or 70—fold coverage is beyond what is commonly used.

Figure 7 shows the results of the VAS with increasing coverage
at the two error rates. As expected, the accuracy is extremely poor
at 2 or 3—fold coverage, as many of the variations will not have any
covering reads. The accuracy rate steadily improves with increasing
coverage as more of the variations have sufﬁcient read coverage for
the SNP—calling algorithm to ﬁnd the variations. The improvement
ends at around 20—fold coverage, though, because at this point
almost every variation has sufﬁciently deep coverage. Beyond 20—
fold coverage the accuracy of the high mappability regions remains
very high, but interestingly, the accuracy of low mappability regions
remains very poor.

That means that unlike typical false negatives, increasing
coverage will not help identify mutations in low GMS regions, even
with 0% sequencing error. Instead, this is because the SNP—calling
algorithms use the mapping quality scores to ﬁlter out unreliable
mapping assignments, and low GMS regions have low mapping
quality score (by deﬁnition). Thus, even though many reads may
sample these variations, the mapping algorithms cannot ever reliably
map to them. Since about 14% of the genome has low GMS value
with typical sequencing parameters, it is expected that about 14%
of all variations of all resequencing studies will not be detected. To
demonstrate this effect, we characterised the SNP variants identiﬁed
by the 1000 genomes pilot project, and found that 99.99% of the

Fig. 7. We measured the Variation Discovery Accuracy test on 20
experiments. 0% Error rate is used as a control group so that only the effect of
mutation remains. The accuracy of the 0% error rate outperforms that of 2%
error rate but by a very small margin at 30—fold coverage. Given sufﬁcient
coverage, the accuracy rate is close to 100%, in high GMS region, while it
cannot be improved in low GMS region, even though high level of coverages
are used. Therefore, 28% detection efﬁciency is the upper limit in low GMS
region using current sequencing technology

SNPs reported were in high GMS regions of the genome, and in fact
99.95% had GMS over 90.

The results from the 1000 Genomes project and our VAS
experiments are alarming for projects using sequencing to identify
causal mutations because low GMS regions occur throughout
the human genome, throughout the exome, and even include
clinically relevant SNPs (Supplementary Table S2). In particular,
within the low GMS regions, there are important variations
(Supplementary Table S3) such as rs33992775 (GMS:0.00) related
to hemoglobin, rs104893928 (GMS:0.00) related to survival of
motor neurons, rs116840812 (GMS:0.00) related to ribosomal
proteins and so on. The frequency of known SNPs and known
clinically relevant SNPs is heavily biased away from the low
GMS regions: only 0.03% of all known SNPs and only 0.14%
of all known clinically relevant SNPs occur in low GMS regions
even though 8.74% of the genome and 0.92% of the transcribed
bases have low GMS bases. This is not at all surprising,
since existing catalogs of variations have been constructed using
methods that face inherent and unavoidable limitations and
can only be addressed by using radically different sequencing
technology.

4 DISCUSSION

Short read mapping has become one of the most important
tools in molecular biology, with many signiﬁcant applications to
understanding human health and disease, plant and animal genomics
and basic biological processes. The algorithms for efﬁciently
mapping reads to the genome are now rapidly maturing, but until
now it was an open question of how to interpret the reliability of
those mappings. Prior working focusing on the mapping quality
score or the Uniqueome were narrowly focused on individual
reads or individual subsequences and missed the larger genomic
context.

Here, we have presented a novel probabilistic metric, the GMS
for identifying and quantifying the regions of the genome that can
be reliably mapped under various experimental conditions. We have
also developed the GMA pipeline for computing the GMS proﬁle

of a genome, leveraging Hadoop to accelerate the computation to
genomes of any size. Using the GMA pipeline, we have identiﬁed
that 14% of the human genome and 4% of the known transcribed
region has low GMS values in which variations will be difﬁcult
or impossible to measure given today’s sequencing technology.
Furthermore, our analysis of the widely used BWA + SAMtools
single nucleotide polymorphism detection algorithm shows that
most SNP detection errors are false negatives, and most of the
missing variations are in regions with low GMS scores. These types
of errors are fundamental to the genome composition, and cannot be
overcome by merely increasing coverage. Notably, the vast majority
of variations reported by the 1000 Genomes project are within high
GMS regions and nearly none is reported in low GMS regions.

These results highlight the importance of measuring the GMS
proﬁle when analyzing the results of resequencing studies, especially
when interpreting the degree or distribution of variations within
the genome. Without considering the GMS, an analysis may
falsely conclude that certain regions of the genome do not
undergo mutations, while in fact through an unavoidable limitation
of the resequencing method, the experiments have no power
to measure those variations. These hidden mutations in the
genomic dark matter may play a very signiﬁcant role to disease
analysis.

It remains for future work to fully integrate the GMS proﬁle into a
full genotyping solution. For example, a major challenge in detecting
structural variations is reconciling putative mutations with repeat
elements. The GMS proﬁle could be used to identify regions of
the genome that can be conﬁdently measured, and poorly mappable
regions can be ﬁltered from the analysis.

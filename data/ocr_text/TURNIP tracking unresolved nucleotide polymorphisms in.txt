ABSTRACT

Summary: TURNIP comprises a suite of Perl scripts and modules
that facilitates the resolution of microheterogeneity within hard-
to-assemble repetitive DNA sequences. TURNIP was originally
developed for the Saccharomyces Genome Resequencing Project
(SGRP) within which the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) of 36 strains of
S.cerevisiae were analysed to investigate the occurrence of potential
polymorphisms. Here, ‘partially resolved SNPs’, or pSNPs, as well
as indels, were found to be far more prevalent than previously
suspected. More generally, the TURNIP software ascertains degrees
of variation between large tandem repeats within a single locus,
offering insights into mechanisms of genome stability and gene
conversion in any organism for which genome sequence data are
available.

1 INTRODUCTION

The drive to continually decrease the cost of DNA sequencing
to achieve better sequence value—for—money has led to a whole
host of new sequencing platforms and analytical techniques. High—
throughput ‘next—generation’ platforms such as ABI SOLiD, Roche
454 and Solexa (Illumina, Inc.) can generate so much data in a
single run that where previously major concerns centered around
read quality and coverage, now the challenges are shifting towards
data storage, data management and timely analysis.

Assembly strategies and tools have had to keep up with the
deluge of nucleotide bases, and as a result many are now highly
sophisticated. Alongside (and often coupled with) these tools are a
large number of SNP calling algorithms that aim to categorise point
variation using reference—based or de novo assembly. However, these
algorithms are not appropriate in all cases, such as dealing with
repetitive regions.

An extreme case of a large repetitive genomic region is the
ribosomal DNA (rDNA) tandem repeat array. For example, in the
brewer’s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae this array, which typically
comprises between 50 and 200 copies of a 9 kb repeat unit depending

on the strain, can occupy up to 60% of chromosome XII on which
it is located at a single locus (Kobayashi et al., 1998; Petes, 1979).
In fact the rDNA consensus of S.cerevisiae strain S2880, the ﬁrst
yeast and indeed ﬁrst eukaryote to have its almost entire genome
sequenced, is only derived from the terminal left— and right—hand
rDNA repeat copies (Goffeau et al., 1996). Thus, the complete
sequence of this essential housekeeping fragment of the genome is
neither straightforward to extract nor analyse as the sequence reads
cannot be reliably assigned to a given repeat.

Analytical tools have been developed to cope with relatively
small arrays comprising short repetitive sequences, e. g. the TRAP
algorithm (Tammi et al., 2003), but elucidating the order and
variability of large repeats is still a complicated and unsolved
problem. Single molecule sequencing may provide a solution, but in
the interim we present TURNIP, a new software suite to address the
problem of resolving variability in large repetitive genomic regions.

2 SYSTEMS AND METHODS

TURNIP uses a previously derived consensus sequence as a reference and
compares aligned ‘seed’ read bases at each position, recording those that
comply with set threshold parameters, and hence functions in a similar
fashion to other SNP calling algorithms such as the Illumina SNP Caller
(Bentley er al., 2008) and an analagous process within the MAQ software
(Li et al., 2008).

However, both SNP Caller and MAQ do not record partially resolved
polymorphisms, whereas TURNIP is speciﬁcally designed to accomplish
this task by the following means. Region—speciﬁc sequences are found
by performing a BLAST search (Altschul er al., 1997) of reads against a
supplied consensus region, and are then indexed by read ID for subsequent
retrieval during the polymorphism calling process.

Using a sliding window approach (Fig. 1A), seed reads are anchored to a
consensus using a less stringent BLAST than that carried out in the previous
step for identifying region—speciﬁc sequences. These are then processed
as 100mer (maximum) windows, in which the central 20mer is the target
sequence for each window.

TURNIP may see reads that do not fully span the current window, and
hence anchor regions that are smaller than 100 bp, in which case a minimal
shortness threshold (default of 70 bp maximum resulting in a 20mer target
and 25 bp ﬂanks) can be set to ensure a large enough proportion of the read
is available to anchor.

TURNIP uses MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004) to perform a gapped multi—
alignment on each set of distinct subject (seed read) sequences and the
window template (consensus) at each sliding 20mer position. The consensus
template is retained in the alignment to identify gaps in the consensus that
represent potential insertions in the seed sequences. If an alignment program
other than MUSCLE is preferred, this may be changed easily within the
TURNIP conﬁguration.

Fig. 1. (A) Sliding window approach, depicting the central 20mer region
anchored by longer ﬂanking regions. (B) Seed read ﬁltering procedures
employed whereby quality scores are checked across each 20mer and rejected
if any drop below a given threshold. (C) ‘Stacking’ of reads that align to
a single copy consensus to ascertain SNP, indel and partial SNP (pSNP)
variation. Variation is discarded if it is only resolved in a single read per
20mer window, e. g. the insertion and deletion would both be discarded here.

Inserted gaps in the template and subject sequences are spanned with
surrounding known quality scores. Aligned seed read 20mers at a given
window position are discarded if they have any single base below a set
sequence quality score threshold (this does not mean that a particular read
is discarded for the whole analysis, but just at the current 20mer window.
See Fig. 1B). If they pass these constraints, the seed read 20mers are then
compared with the consensus and called for variation (Fig. 1C).

In this way, the TURNIP software encapsulates, and contains
improvements to, the method suggested by us and used in James et al.
(2009). In particular, due to ﬁne—scale alignment and ﬁltering mechanisms
employed within, TURNIP is able to resolve variable—length indels as well as
point mutations, and other problematic features such as long homopolymeric
(polyA and polyT) tracts. The TURNIP algorithmic process is described in
greater detail in the online documentation.

Portions of the TURNIP software, such as BLAST, MUSCLE and the
sliding window approach, can be conﬁgured to run concurrently on a
multi—core/cluster environment and hence analyse multiple window positions
simultaneously. As an example, strain YS4 from the Saccharomyces Genome
Resequencing Project (SGRP) strain set, sequenced using Sanger whole—
genome shotgun sequencing at approximately 1X coverage, has an estimated
100 repeat copies (James et al., 2009) giving a complete dataset of just
under 1Mb. On a dual core 3 GHz desktop machine with 2 GB RAM, this
dataset took 3 min to process using TURNIP.

At each stage of the analysis, TURNIP writes output ﬁles that allow it to
use precomputed data in case of process interruption, or if certain variation—
calling threshold parameters are changed and a simple reanalysis of the ﬁnal
alignments is needed. TURNIP produces simple text ﬁle output describing the
positions, types and frequencies of the resolved polymorphisms, as well as
SQL ﬁles for database importing and GFF3 for bulk loading into a GBrowse
database (Stein et al., 2002). A custom pie chart glyph and an example
GBrowse conﬁguration ﬁle are included in the TURNIP distribution.

The TURNIP suite also provides scripts to produce distance matrices
and phylogenetic trees from the output variation frequency data. Trees
generated from analysis of the SGRP S.cerevisiae dataset can be viewed
and interactively modiﬁed by strain subset selection at the NCYC web site
(see Availability). The trees generated from pSNP distances closely match
those produced as part of the study of Liti et al. (2009), showing that
analysis of the rDNA region of the yeast genome alone can be sufﬁcient to
produce informative phylogenies based on variation that is not fully resolved.
This information could be used in future for the purposes of precision strain
characterization and evolutionary studies including investigation into gene
conversion in closely related lineages.

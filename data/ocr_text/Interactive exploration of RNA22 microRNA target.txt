ABSTRACT

Summary: MicroRNA (miRNA) target prediction is an important prob-
lem. Given an miRNA sequence the task is to determine the identity of
the messenger RNAs targeted by it, the locations within them where
the interactions happen and the speciﬁcs of the formed heterodu-
plexes. Here, we describe a web-based application, RNA22-GUI,
which we have designed and implemented for the interactive explor-
ation and in-context visualization of predictions by RNA22, one of the
popular miRNA target prediction algorithms. Central to our design has
been the requirement to provide informative and comprehensive visu-
alization that is integrated with interactive search capabilities and per-
mits one to selectively isolate and focus on relevant information that is
distilled on-the—fly from a large repository of pre—compiled predictions.
RNA22-GUI is currently available for Homo sapiens, Mus musculus,
Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans.

1 INTRODUCTION

MicroRNA (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs, ~22 nucleotides
in length, that regulate messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in a
sequence-dependent manner (Bartel, 2009; Pasquinelli, 2012).
Efforts during the past decade have shown the importance of
miRNA-based regulation in diverse contexts and in health and
disease (Esteller, 2011). Thus, the ability to predict miRNA tar-
gets has attracted a lot of attention and several algorithms have
been proposed (for a review, see Rigoutsos and Tsirigos, 2010).
Despite progress, the problem of miRNA target prediction has
proven to be a vexing one and improved solutions continue to be
sought (Thomas et al., 2010).

RNA22 (Miranda et al., 2006) differs from other algorithms in
several ways: it is trained with known miRNAs, not with experi-
mentally validated heteroduplexes; it permits combinations of
G:U wobbles and bulges in the seed region of a heteroduplex;
and, it neither relies on nor requires a target’s conservation across
genomes. RNA22 has successfully predicted non-canonical tar-
gets as well as targets beyond the 3’-untranslated region (3’-UTR)
(Duursma et al., 2008; Lal et al., 2008, 2009; Tay et al., 2008).
Also, independent studies (Hammell et al., 2008; Ritchie et al.,
2009) have shown that RNA22 exhibits a high signal-to-noise
ratio. To facilitate work with RNA22 targets, we implemented

RNA22-GUI, an application that permits user interaction with
the server, exploration of various attributes of the predicted tar-
gets, Visualization of the predictions in context, link-out to exter-
nal expression repositories and databases, and so forth.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

Our design had the following key requirements: (i) informative
and comprehensive Visualization that is integrated with
context-dependent search and ﬁltering capabilities—a ﬂexible
and user-friendly interface permits one to zoom-in on relevant
information that is distilled from a large (hundreds of GBytes)
repository of pre-computed predictions; (ii) speedy access to a
succinct collection of mRNA:miRNA predictions in a multitude
of formatting choices that facilitate downstream analyses;
(iii) collaborative sharing enablement through a dynamic-in-
nature system that permits information transfer through URL
exchange; (iV) ability to store the generated data on the user’s
computer to enable offline studies without the need to connect to
our web server; and (V) remote harvesting or downloading of our
pre—compiled data (see Supplementary Material).

3 FUNCTIONALITY

The main page of RNA22-GUI allows the user to choose an
organism. Currently, predictions are available for Homo sapiens,
Mus musculus, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis ele-
gans. The user is then taken to a new page, referred to in what
follows as the ‘main page’. For the remainder of the presentation,
we will work with H. sapiens.

3.1 Interactive ‘search by. . .’

Input boxes on the main page permit searches using a miRNA
identiﬁer, an ENSEMBL gene or ENSEMBL transcript identiﬁer,
or, a common gene name (Supplementary Figure S1). Help but-
tons next to each input box link to help information speciﬁc to the
input type, examples of use and an interactive demo with anno-
tated pictures. Input validation is provided throughout the appli-
cation: ambiguous queries (e.g. hsa—miR—29) lead the system to
recommend more speciﬁc instances and to prompt the user to
select the intended one (e. g. hsa—miR—29g, hsa-miR-29h, etc).
This being a transition period for miRNA nomenclature, we
have opted for a solution that allows for maximal ﬂexibility (see
Supplementary Material). Malformed or non-existent identiﬁers
also result in user notiﬁcation. For queries with an ENSEMBL
w identiﬁer, the user is presented with a list of known transcripts
for the gene and links to the relevant ENSEMBL records and the
gene’s entries in the Human Protein Atlas, the Gene Expression
Atlas and the Allen Institute for Brain Science repository.

Interactive exploration of RAM22 miRNA target predictions

 

A pre-populated link to F ACTA+ (Tsuruoka et al., 2011) allows
the generation of term associations for the gene’s function. Other
links allow one to View the 500 most accessed transcripts and to
submit questions /comments through email.

3.2 Boolean operations on miRNAs

For queries that use a miRNA identiﬁer, we permit implicit use of
the AND operator by allowing the user to enter multiple space-
separated miRNA identiﬁers. The output will include those tran-
scripts that are predicted to be targeted simultaneously by the
listed miRNAs. We are in the process of implementing a parser
that will allow the use of more complicated Boolean expressions
e.g. (miR-17 AND miR-18a) AND (miR-19a OR miR-19b-1) to
minimize the amount of needed ofﬂine processing by the user.

3.3 Interactive tabular output of predicted targets

After selecting the ﬁltering criteria, a simple or a composite
miRNA query will generate a multi-column list (Supplementary
Figure S2) of all predicted targets satisfying the criteria. This
output includes common gene name, ENSEMBL gene and tran-
script identiﬁers, the total number of predicted targets in the
transcript for the speciﬁed miRNA(s), chromosome and strand
information, links to tabular and html-based maps of the pre-
dicted targets for the transcript for all currently known miRNAs,
links to the matching ENSEMBL records and a description of
each transcript’s function. The user can interact with the output
in multiple ways sorting the rows in ascending or descending
order of the entries in the various columns, or can cut-and-paste
it into a spreadsheet program. Importantly, the user can save the
entire web page on his/her computer for subsequent ofﬂine ana-
lysis. The user can also generate single column lists with gene or
transcript identiﬁers or common gene names for use with other
tools, e.g. DAVID (Huang et al., 2009).

3.4 In-context interactive visualization of predictions

Queries with a transcript identiﬁer allow the retrieval and Visual-
ization of predicted targets in the form of a navigable map. The
engine will render the corresponding cDNA on consecutive lines
each containing 60 nucleotides. In the map, the 5’ and 3’-UTRs
are shown in a separate color than the coding sequence and the
amino-acid translation is juxtaposed to the cDNA. Predicted
targets sites (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S3) are optionally
delineated with thin red rectangles superimposed on the cDNA.
Regions of cDNA regions predicted to be hotspots of miRNA
targeting are rendered in gradually darker shades of gray and are
automatically updated if the user changes the ﬁltering criteria. A
pull-down menu at the top of the page lists the targeting miRNAs
and their target locations in miRNA numerical order. Selecting a
miRNA/target—location allows the user to jump to the corres-
ponding location of the page. Pull-down menus next to each
cDNA line permit one to selectively show one or more predicted
targets and the corresponding heteroduplexes. The heterodu-
plexes are aligned to the cDNA and shown in a semi-transparent
pop-up window. Filtering criteria (e. g. folding energy of a hetero-
duplex) can be changed on-the-ﬂy; detailed help is available within
the ﬁltering dialog. Notably, toggling target Visualization is sep-
arate and distinct from the changing of the ﬁltering options. As
with the tabular output, the cDNA map can be saved on the user’s

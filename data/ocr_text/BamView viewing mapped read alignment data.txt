ABSTRACT

Summary: BamView is an interactive Java application for visualizing
the large amounts of data stored for sequence reads which are
aligned against a reference genome sequence. It supports the BAM
(Binary Alignment/Map) format. It can be used in a number of
contexts including SNP calling and structural annotation. BamView
has also been integrated into Artemis so that the reads can be viewed
in the context of the nucleotide sequence and genomic features.
Availability: BamView and Artemis are freely available (under a
GPL licence) for download (for MacOSX, UNIX and Windows)
at: http://bamview.sourceforge.net/

1 INTRODUCTION

Second— generation sequencing produces large volumes of short—read
sequence data. In common applications of the technology, such as
resequencing or transcriptome sequencing, reads are mapped against
a reference genome. In many cases, bases in a reference are covered
with alignment depths varying by orders of magnitude and therefore
present a challenge for Visualization.

SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) and BAM (Binary
Alignment/Map) formats are emerging as a standard representation
for read alignments. It is therefore important to have Visualization
software for this format. BAM ﬁles contain the same information
as SAM. As BAM format is compressed it provides an efﬁcient
means to store the data and enables fast retrieval of regions and so
this format has been adopted here.

SAMTools (Li et al., 2009) includes a very simple text alignment
Viewer using the GNU ncurses library giving a detailed View at
the nucleotide resolution level. Lookseq (Manske and Kwiatkowski,
2009) is a perl—cgi application used to display, in a web browser,
reads mapped against a reference. It can read the data either directly
from BAM ﬁles or from a relational database to display reads and
plots paired read positions against their inferred size.

Alignment tools can be used to produce BAM format ﬁles. For
instance, SSAHA (Ning et al., 2001) now supports SAM format
(Long et al., 2009) and Maq output (Li et al., 2008) can be converted
to SAM/BAM using SAMTools.

BamView can be used as a stand—alone Java application or
displayed in Artemis (Carver et al., 2008; Rutherford et al., 2000,
Fig. 1) in conjunction with the reference sequence and annotation.

BAM View is displaying RNA—Seq Solexa reads from the early ring stage
in the life cycle of P. falciparum. (b) This is a zoomed in View showing the
boundaries of adjacent exons. These boundaries are conﬁrmed by the reads
in BamView. A paired read is selected and marked by a red rectangle. SNPs
are coloured red. The black reads are single reads.

Artemis is a freely available genome browser and annotation tool.
BamView in Artemis provides the annotator with an extra level of
information that can inform them about structural annotation.

BamView not only displays the Lookseq type of View (plotting
against the paired reads inferred size) but also has other types of
Views that are described below. It does not require a web server and
reads the data from an indexed BAM ﬁle.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

The BAM ﬁle needs to be sorted and indexed using the SAMTools
command tool. This creates the BAM index ﬁle that the Viewer
uses to access the region to display in a fast way. BamView uses
picard (picard.sourceforge.net), which is a Java API to read from
the BAM ﬁle the reads in the region of sequence being displayed.

Bam View

 

Picard requires Java 1.6+ and so this is the minimum requirement
for BamView.

The alignment data can be displayed at different levels
of resolution (Fig. 1). Zooming out displays more of the
read alignments across the reference sequence. The stand—alone
BamView has ‘+’ and ‘—’ buttons to zoom in and out. In Artemis,
the resolution of BamView matches the top feature display (Fig. 1).
The resolution is controlled using the Artemis zoom scrollbar (on the
right—hand side of the feature display). All other BamView options
and functionality are in both the standalone and integrated versions.

Right clicking on the window gives a pop—up menu with a ‘View’
menu. There are four Views provided by BAMView. The ﬁrst is
similar to one devised within Lookseq, whereby paired reads are
plotted against their inferred insert size. An option displays single
read alignments. There is an option to draw this against a log scale
of the inferred size. In situations where the distribution of inferred
sizes is broad this has the advantage of showing them closer together.
The second is a ‘stack View’ where reads in a region are displayed
piled against the reference to reduce the alignment depth. A variation
is the ‘paired stack View’, where lines join paired reads within the
stacks. When forward and reverse reads are described in the BAM
ﬁle, the ‘strand stack View’ can be used to display reads abOVe and
below a line representing the reference.

The reads are colour coded so that paired reads are blue and those
with an inversion are red. Reads that do not haVe a mapped mate
are black and are optionally shown in the inferred insert size View.
In the stack View, duplicated reads that span the same region are
collapsed into one green line.

In addition to these Views, when zoomed in the reads are displayed
at the nucleotide level to shows how they are aligned to the reference
sequence. Bases can be coloured by their mapping quality score
(blue <10; green <20; orange <30; black :30) and there is an
option to display insertions.

Bases that disagree with the reference consensus (sequencing
errors or polymorphism) can also be displayed by selecting an option
in the pop—up menu. These are red Vertical lines on the reads and
displayed as red nucleotides when zoomed in.

From the pop—up menu, BamView has the option to ﬁlter the
reads displayed. This enables the user to display reads that are
of signiﬁcance and it also has the advantage of reducing the
memory required by the programme. Reads can be ﬁltered based
on their mapping quality (i.e. the MAPQ ﬁeld in the BAM ﬁle).
Read alignments can also be ﬁltered using the FLAG ﬁeld. This
ﬁeld is used in the SAM/BAM speciﬁcation to describe predeﬁned
properties of each read alignment (e. g. proper pair, mate unmapped,
ﬁrst of pair).

When the user points the mouse cursor 0Ver a read, a tool—tip
will display information about the read (name, coordinates, insert
size and reference sequence name). The reads can be selected which
is useful to track the read when zooming in and out. When fully
zoomed in, the selected reads are highlighted by a red rectangle.
Right clicking on a reads shows a pop—up menu that includes an
option to go to the other read of a mate pair.

3 DISCUSSION

Using the different Views in BamView and as an integrated window
in the Artemis tool means that it has a range of uses. For example,
BamView can be used to inspect the conﬁdence of a deep alignment
of short reads, by highlighting base discrepancies. As it is integrated
into Artemis, the underlying reference consensus sequence can be
edited directly based on the aligned eVidence. More commonly,
the View is used in—house to assess the eVidence behind a SNP
or other polymorphism call. The alignment depth and base quality
can both be easily browsed and inspected. Perhaps the greatest
strength of BamView, when embedded in Artemis, is that it allows
annotation to be changed based on manually inspecting data from
transcriptome sequencing experiments (RNAseq, Otto et al., 2009;
Wang et al., 2009). An annotator can zoom into intron—exon
boundaries, identiﬁed from coverage plots, and see the quality
of eVidence supporting a prediction or manually adjust exons
coordinates to ﬁt the eVidence. Simply Viewing individually aligned
reads cannot resolVe alternate splicing patterns, but by clicking
through read—pairs, an annotator can reconstruct the phase of exons
in different isoforms.

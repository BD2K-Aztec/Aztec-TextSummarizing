ABSTRACT

Summary: BioTextQuest combines automated discovery of
significant terms in article clusters with structured knowledge
annotation, via Named Entity Recognition services, offering
interactive user-friendly visualization. A tag-cloud-based illustration
of terms labeling each document cluster are semantically annotated
according to the biological entity, and a list of document titles enable
users to simultaneously compare terms and documents of each
cluster, facilitating concept association and hypothesis generation.
BioTextQuest allows customization of analysis parameters, e.g.
clustering/stemming algorithms, exclusion of documents/significant
terms, to better match the biological question addressed.

1 INTRODUCTION

Several information retrieval tools are available to the scientiﬁc
community, each attempting to analyze the large amount of
biomedical information from a different perspective (Kim and
Rebholz-Schuhmann, 2008). Most of the currently available
literature mining systems are based on Natural Language Processing,
supervised machine learning or their combination (Cohen and
Hunter, 2008; Larranaga et al., 2006; Winnenburg et al., 2008).
An alternative approach is the summarizing of large query outputs
by document clustering, where similar documents are grouped
on the basis of particular, meaningful terms (Iliopoulos et al.,
2001). It is an unsupervised technique, thus its success does not
depend on prior knowledge or domain expertise (Iliopoulos et al.,

2001; Lu, 2011; Theodosiou et al., 2008). Existing biomedical
literature clustering systems include ClusterMedTM (http://dem0s
.ViVisim0.com/clustermed) and PuReD-MCL (Theodosiou et al.,
2008). ClusterMedTM is a commercial software whose free version
supports the clustering of at most 100 abstracts. PuReD-MCL is a
downloadable collection of Perl and R scripts, mostly addressing
expert users (Theodosiou et al., 2008). With BioTextQuest,
our aim has been to provide researchers with a user-friendly
web application that enables online queries for deﬁning corpora
of biomedical abstracts followed by document clustering and
Visualization. BioTextQuest is an application that offers an array
of Visualization tools for efﬁcient navigation among biomedical
records, and concept extraction. It also supports the depiction of
term associations within clusters and can be easily customized. In the
following sections, we describe the BioTextQuest architecture and
demonstrate its functionality, based on a reworked query example
of a Drosophila developmental pattern presented in the original
TextQuest publication (Iliopoulos et al., 2001).

2 IMPLEMENTATION

BioTextQuest is a user-friendly web application, offering a simple interface
and support for Visual term associations. The core component is based
on TextQuest (Iliopoulos et al., 2001), a prototype capable of extracting
the terms of biomedical signiﬁcance in a group of records and grouping
these records according to their similarity based on the extracted terms. To
query PubMed, while minimizing response times and hardware resource
requirements, BioTextQuest (i) uses the NCBI eSearch service from the
Entrez Programming Utilities (http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.g0V/) to retrieve the
identiﬁers of the PubMed records matching a given user query and (ii) looks
up these identiﬁers in a local index that matches them to their corresponding
textual contents. Such a system takes advantage of the PubMed query
syntax and of the capabilities of the NCBI utilities while mitigating the
necessity of a local full-text PubMed index. A daemon monitors the new
MEDLINE/PubMed releases and is responsible for downloading the new
records and dynamically updating the local index. An overview of the
BioTextQuest architecture is provided in Supplementary Figure S 1, and it has
been tested on the most common web browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Safari and
Opera). Compared with the original TextQuest algorithm, the web application
BioTextQuest:

(1) offers optional use of the Lovins stemming algorithm (Lovins, 1968);

(2) employs a set of clustering algorithms namely: (i) K -Means
[Cluster 3.0 package, de Hoon et al. (2004)], (ii) spectral clustering

offers integrated Visualization and interactive re-analysis capabilities,
such as the option of selecting terms, documents and clusters
for removal and re-clustering. User interface elements are based
on HTML, CSS and JavaScript (JavaScript libraries: scriptaculous

invokes third-party text annotation web services [Reﬂect, Paﬁlis et al.
(2009); WhatIzIt, Rebholz-Schuhmann et al. (2008)] to annotate the
terms of biomedical importance identiﬁed by the clustering algorithm.

3 FUNCTIONALITY

The BioTextQuest server is designed to be as user friendly as
possible, offering the aforementioned features in the most intuitive
way. A Google-like search page allows users to pose direct queries
to PubMed and interactively set the analysis parameters. Text
annotation services are employed to map the extracted terms of
biomedical signiﬁcance to the biological entities they describe. The
resulting document clusters and their corresponding terms, along
with the retrieved annotation, are combined to produce a series of
Views of the analysis results. Importantly, users can interactively
subcluster and/0r recluster the results of any completed analysis.

The Home page (Supplementary Fig. S2) is designed to be
minimal to allow users to concentrate on the main functionality. Pop-
up instructions assist users in executing an analysis. More complex
queries can be issued following the Entrez syntax. Users may
specify up to a maximum of 2000 articles to be retrieved/processed.
Advanced options, such as stemming and clustering methods (with
respective parameters), are hidden by default and may be used to
ﬁne-tune the results. Each algorithm may prove useful to address
different kinds of questions. Since the functionality of the web
tool partly relies on other web services (e.g. Entrez Programming
Utilities), users are notiﬁed whether these services might be
unreachable.

The Results page (Supplementary Figs S3—S5) provides Views
organized under tabs, along with a frame displaying a summary
(query and parameters) and a form for a new run. The ‘Tag
Clouds’ View returns an informative display of cluster-speciﬁc
terms (Supplementary Fig. S3). This type of literature mining for
biomedical concept discovery (Krallinger et al., 2008), reﬂects
the size of each term proportional to the fraction of documents
with the speciﬁc term within the cluster. The ‘Biomedical Terms’
View lists and graphically annotates the GoList terms identiﬁed in
the same manner as above (Supplementary Fig. S4). Finally, the
‘Documents’ View provides titles of documents belonging to each
cluster with a PubMed link, and links to the plain or semantically
annotated (Reﬂected) abstract (Supplementary Fig. S5). Users may
interact with the results by requesting a ﬁne-grained analysis of
the active corpus, i.e. the collection of abstracts currently being
processed. This is achieved by any combination of (i) simply altering
available options (e. g. stemming or clustering); (ii) excluding terms
from the GoList available in the Biomedical Terms View and
(iii) removing clusters of documents from the Tag Clouds View.
BioTextQuest employs third-party text annotation web services to
enrich terms (by highlighting terms and using popups) according
to the biological entity they describe. To identify protein names

BioTextQuest invokes the Reﬂect service (Paﬁlis et al., 2009).
WhatIzIt (Rebholz—Schuhmann et al., 2008) is optionally used
to identify terms referring to pathway, molecular function and/0r
cellular component names. Additionally, the user can highlight
non-standard English terms and terms unique to a cluster. When
stemming is used, the root terms are displayed in the Tag-Cloud,
whereas the respective unstemmed terms are available upon clicking
on the respective link.

4 CONCLUSION

We describe BioTextQuest, an online text mining system, enabling
concept discovery from the biomedical literature recorded in
PubMed Via a clustering-based procedure. Further exploration of
literature information is facilitated by intuitive graphical depictions
of biologically relevant terms and interactive re-/subclustering
capabilities. BioTextQuest is designed with simplicity for end-users,
while advanced options enable further analyses.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Exome sequencing (exome-seq) data, which are typically
used for calling exonic mutations, have also been utilized in detecting
DNA copy number variations (CNVs). Despite the existence of several
CNV detection tools, there is still a great need for a sensitive and an
accurate CNV-calling algorithm with built-in QC steps, and does not
require a paired reference for each sample.

Results: We developed a novel method named PatternCNV, which (i)
accounts for the read coverage variations between exons while lever-
aging the consistencies of this variability across different samples; (ii)
reduces alignment BAM files to WIG format and therefore greatly
accelerates computation; (iii) incorporates multiple QC measures
designed to identify outlier samples and batch effects; and (iv) pro-
vides a variety of visualization options including chromosome, gene
and exon-level views of CNVs, along with a tabular summarization of
the exon-level CNVs. Compared with other CNV-calling algorithms
using data from a lymphoma exome-seq study, PatternCNV has
higher sensitivity and specificity.

Availability and implementation: The software for PatternCNV is im-
plemented using Perl and R, and can be used in Mac or Linux envir-
onments. Software and user manual are available at http://
bioinformaticstools.mayo.edu/research/patterncnv/, and R package
at https://github.com/topsoil/patternCNV/.

1 INTRODUCTION

DNA copy number variations (CNVs) are genomic structural
changes that result in regional or chromosomal loss or gain of
DNA copies (Hastings et al., 2009). Owing to the significant roles
in human diseases, various laboratory techniques have been

developed to detect CNVs, including recently advanced massive
parallel sequencing of whole genomes and coding exomes. For
exome-seq, it is commonly observed that coverage depths of
short reads across regions vary, caused by different target cap-
ture efﬁciencies (Parla et al., 2011), as well as the differences in
mappability of exons. Such coverage variations impose substan-
tial challenges for reliable CNV detection. Most existing methods
use a paired-sample approach, based on the intuitive assumption
that somatic sample and its paired reference share similar cover-
age bias that can be cancelled out through pairing (Koboldt
et al., 2012; Sathirapongsasuti et al., 2011). Although this as-
sumption approximately holds, it oversimpliﬁes the problem
with two limitations unaddressed: (i) The region-speciﬁc noise
(coverage variability) of a local region is not accounted for, lead-
ing to ampliﬁed noise in log-ratio values of coverage between
sample and the paired reference. (ii) In the case of a missing or
low-quality reference sample, CNV detection based on paired
reference will be infeasible or have degraded accuracy/ sensitivity.
A recent published method, FishingCNV, tried to address the
second limitation by using the average of multiple reference sam-
ples as the denominators in log-ratio calculation, but did not
address the regional noises in individual samples (the numer-
ator), which led to false CNV calls (details in Supplementary
Section S2.3). Considering these issues, we proposed a novel
method called PatternCNV, which summarizes overall consistent
patterns of both depths and variability of exonic region coverage
across samples, where ‘patterns’ of coverage and variability are
summarized using multiple ‘normal’ or reference samples. We
observed that the same patterns only exist between samples pre-
pared using the same version of exome capture kit. During CNV
detection, we compute the differences of observed coverage ver-
sus the common pattern, while penalizing regions associated with
larger variability using a weighting scheme. Further, whole-
genome CNV can be interpolated from exon—level CNV using
any third-party segmentation method, e.g. circular binary seg-
mentation (Olshen et al., 2004).

The PatternCNV was implemented in two different versions: a
Mac and Linux/Unix version, and an R package version. We
also developed a conversion tool to transform Binary version

of sequence Alignment/Map (BAM) format ﬁles to much smaller
wiggle (WIG) format ﬁles (<1% of BAM ﬁle size), which greatly
speeds up pattern learning and CNV calculation. When com-
pared with other state-of—the-art CNV algorithms in a lymphoma
case study, PatternCNV displayed higher resolution and greater
sensitivity/speciﬁcity.

2 FEATURES

2.1 Input, output and major functions

PatternCNV is divided into three major functional components:
(i) BAM-to-WIG conversion for improved computational per-
formance: a BAM2WIG converter using SAMtools (Li et al.,
2009) and BEDtools (Quinlan and Hall 2010), which takes as
input a BAM ﬁle, a ﬁle of Browser Extensible Data (BED)
format deﬁning exon regions and a second BED ﬁle for capture
targets deﬁned by the exome capture kit. The outputs are WIG
ﬁles with greatly reduced ﬁle sizes compared with BAM ﬁles; (ii)
CNV detection: starting with WIG ﬁles, PatternCNV estimates
the coverage and variability patterns from multiple reference
samples and calculates CNVs relative to the pattern for all sam-
ples including the references; and (iii) CNV summary and visu-
alization: this module outputs a detailed exon-level CNV
summary ﬁle per sample, and provides several visualization op-
tions for viewing CNVs at the whole-genome level or chromo-
some level. In addition, there are built-in QA/QC steps to detect

2.2 Description of the PatternCNV algorithm

Each exon is ﬁrst divided into consecutive bins of user-deﬁned
size (e.g. 10 base pairs). To make the exon coverage of different
samples comparable, log2-transformed RPKM (reads per kilo-
base per million total reads) is used to standardize the bin cover-
age. Denoting x; as log2-transformed RPKM coverage of l-th
bin in a given exon, the standard coverage of a bin without CNV
is assumed to approximately follow a normal distribution
N(Mla01)- The ﬁzmlli=1,...,L and 8=[81]l=1,...,L are eStimated
from a pool of reference samples as the coverage and variability
patterns. For a bin with a copy number of C, the bin signal is
calculated as r=log2(C/2), x1~N(r + u], 01). Hence, a bin-level
CNV can be estimated as f1=x1 — 11). Considering variability of
bin coverage depending on its relative position in an exon or with
respect to capture probe, we further smooth multiple bins within
k—th exon (we denote related bin indices as l e Ek), leading to a
maximum likelihood estimation: fk = 2 [GE]: w1(x1 — ,al), where w;
is designed to take variability of each bin into consideration (de-
tails of the statistical formulation are described in Supplementary
Section Sl).

2.3 Lymphoma case study

We applied PatternCNV to a set of 15 germ line—tumor pairs of
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma exome-seq data (Lohr et al., 2012).
When comparing CNV results derived from exome-seq using
PatternCNV with those calculated from SNP microarray data
proﬁled on the same samples, the two sets of results largely cor-
relate for large CNVs. As expected, PatternCNV identiﬁed many
small CNV regions at the single exon and/or multiple exon level
(Supplementary Section S2.3) that the SNP array failed to detect
owing to lack of probe coverage/density at the region. In add-
tion, thanks to the digitalized dynamic range of read coverages,
PatternCNV can differentiate high versus low ampliﬁcations,
while microarrays are limited by the saturation of probe hybrid-
ization signal. We compared PatternCNV with three other
exome-seq-based CNV detection methods, ExomeCNV
(Sathirapongsasuti et al., 2011), Varscan2 (Koboldt et al.,
2012) and FishingCNV (Shi and Majewski 2013) using CNV
detected by SNP microarrays as the ground truth. PatternCNV
displayed superior visual resolution and achieved better speciﬁty
and sensitivity when compared with the paired approaches used
by ExomeCNV and Varscan2 (Supplementary Section S22), and
had much less false positives compared with FishingCNV
(Supplementary Section S2.3). In several focused comparisons,
we also saw an increased resolution of PatternCNV-based esti-
mations compared with these two methods (Supplementary
Section S2.l). In situations where a reference sample had less
reliable quality than its paired counterpart, we often observed
dramatically reduced performance of both Varscan2 and
ExomeCNV for CNV detection, but not PatternCNV
(Supplementary Section S2.l). This highlights the robustness of
the pattern-based approach over conventional paried
approaches. FishingCNV uses a method of taking the average
across normal samples, which is more similar to PatternCNV

than the paired methods used by the other two tools. However, a
detailed comparison shows that FishingCNV has different data
processing and CNV detection methods (Supplementary Section
S2.3). FishingCNV’s principle component analysis (PCA) step
over corrects batch effects and consequently removes CNV sig-
nals, resulting in false negative calls. We recommend that the
users do not perform the default PCA step of FishingCNV.
Moreover, it also oversimpliﬁes average read-depth approach,
producing an alarmingly high number of false-positive CNV
calls (Supplementary Section S2.3). In contrast, PatternCNV’s
novel use of both the weighted average read depth and coverage
variability produces results that are superior and simpler to use
by improving true positives and greatly reducing false-positive
CNV calls.

3 DISCUSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS

We introduce PatternCNV, a software package designed to focus
on exon-level CNV detection from exome-seq data. CNV esti-
mate is based on coverage and variability patterns summarized
from multiple reference samples. The implemented algorithm
uses WIG ﬁle format, which improves the runtime and space
efﬁciency. Several post-processing functions are included to fa-
cilitate interpretation, through visualization, segmentation and
tabular summarization. As demonstrated by the case study, we
believe it is a useful utility for exome-seq studies where robust
detection of germ line and/or somatic CNVs is of interest.

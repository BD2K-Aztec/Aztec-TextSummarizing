ABSTRACT

Summary: Endeavour is a tool that detects the most promising
genes within large lists of candidates with respect to a biological
process of interest and by combining several genomic data sources.
We have benchmarked Endeavour using 450 pathway maps and 826
disease marker sets from MetaCoreTM of GeneGo, lnc. containing
a total of 9911 and 12432 genes, respectively. We obtained an
area under the receiver operating characteristic curves of 0.97 for
pathway and of 0.91 for disease gene sets. These results indicate
that Endeavour can be used to efficiently prioritize candidate genes
for pathways and diseases.

1 INTRODUCTION

Identifying disease causing genes is a key challenge in human
genetics. In the process of identifying such disease genes,
researchers are often confronted with large lists of candidate genes
among which only one or a few are actually causal. The validation
of each candidate is often too costly and time consuming, so that
only a few candidates are further experimentally validated. A related
problem arises when trying to identify new members of a biological
pathway. The selection of a small subset of optimal candidates
for validation is called gene prioritization. Since going manually
through all possible sources of information is a slow and tedious
process, several bioinformatics methods have been developed to
tackle this problem (Oti and Brunner, 2007; Zhu and Zhao, 2007).
We previously developed Endeavour (Aerts et al., 2006; Tranchevent
et al., 2008) whose key feature is that it uses multiple genomic
data sources (e. g. sequence, expression, literature and annotation)
to estimate how promising a candidate gene is by measuring its
similarity with a set of training genes. The training genes are
genes which are already known to play a role in the biological
process under study. The underlying assumption is that the most
promising candidate genes are the ones that exhibit many similarities
with the training genes. A schematic view of the algorithm is
shown in Figure 1. Originally, Endeavour was benchmarked by
leave—one—out cross—validations on 32 gene sets corresponding to

Fig. 1. The Endeavour algorithm. (A) The inputs are, on the one hand, the
training genes (on top, in red), known to be involved in the process of interest,
and, on the other hand, the candidate genes to prioritize (at the bottom, in grey
and orange). (B) Data are collected for these genes: e. g. expression proﬁles,
functional annotations and protein—protein interactions. (C) Candidate genes
are prioritized, i.e. ranked according to their similarities to the training genes.
For example, the gene in orange is the most promising candidate (i.e. it ranks
in ﬁrst position) because (i) its expression proﬁle is similar to the red ones,
(ii) it also shares several functional annotations and (iii) it is interacting with
several training proteins.

3 bio—molecular pathways and 29 genetic diseases, representing
around 700 prioritizations in total (Aerts et al., 2006). In the current
study, we brieﬂy report on the largest benchmark to date for a
gene prioritization method using 1276 pathways and diseases from
MetaCore and prioritizing a total of 22 343 genes.

2 METHODS

We used the MetaCoreTM Pathway Maps and Disease Marker Sets as
provided by GeneGo, Inc. in October 2008. This resulted in 450 pathway
maps containing a total of 9911 genes, and 826 disease marker sets containing
a total of 12 432 genes (see Supplementary Material). In addition, the
OMIM and Gene Ontology based benchmarks were built as described
in Aerts et al. (2006), see also Supplementary Material. The Endeavour
prioritization platform was accessed remotely using a secured connection
from a command line interface allowing the automatic processing of
thousands of prioritizations.

3 RESULTS

The cross—validation procedure measures the ability of the program
to capture the information of the known genes and to correctly use
this information to prioritize the left—out gene. To assess the ability

Fig. 2. Results of the large—scale validation of Endeavour on the 450
pathways and 826 disease marker sets from MetaCore. The disease ROC
curve, in green, results in an AUC of 91.65% and the pathway ROC, in
red, indicates an even better performance with an AUC of 97.72%. The
dotted curves represent the performance for the OMIM diseases (dotted
green, 94.12%) and the GO pathways (dotted red, 93.37%). The black
curve serves as a control (49.86%). The optimal control experiment would
consist of shufﬂed gene sets but randomly selected gene sets were used as
an approximation. AUCs for diseases and pathways are signiﬁcantly larger
than the control AUC (Wilcoxon rank sum <1e—6).

of Endeavour to capture the information of known pathway and
disease—related gene sets, we used the pathways maps and disease
marker sets of MetaCoreTM from GeneGo, Inc. Since the gene sets
in MetaCore are manually curated, we consider them as a reliable
representation of the current knowledge of the functional contexts in
which the genes are active. We have benchmarked Endeavour using
450 pathway maps and 826 disease marker sets containing a total of
9911 pathway members and 12 432 disease genes, respectively. In
addition, we have also benchmarked 29 OMIM diseases and 37 Gene
Ontology pathways that contain 620 and 1216 genes, respectively.
For each prioritization run, the position of the left—out gene among
99 randomly chosen candidates is recorded (see also Supplementary
Material). We use the area under the receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) curves (AUC) as a measure of the performance. We obtained
an AUC of 0.97 for the MetaCore pathways. Moreover, 64%
of the prioritizations have the left—out gene being ranked in the
ﬁrst position. The AUC value obtained for the MetaCore disease
marker sets is 0.91 and 33% of the prioritizations have the left—out
gene being ranked in the ﬁrst position (Fig. 2). The AUC values
obtained for the Gene Ontology pathways and OMIM diseases are
0.93 and 0.94, respectively. Altogether, the results indicate that
Endeavour efﬁciently prioritizes candidate genes for both pathways
and diseases. As observed and discussed in our previous work
(Aerts et al., 2006), the performance of gene prioritization is higher
for pathways than for disease marker sets because data sources
such as Gene Ontology contain pathway speciﬁc information and

because diseases often implicate a complex set of cascades making
their proﬁling more challenging. Furthermore, the performance is
higher for OMIM diseases than for MetaCore diseases because
the MetaCore sets include markers derived from gene expression
studies whereas the OMIM sets only rely on known causative
genes. Such markers are indirectly associated to the disease and
it is therefore harder to prioritize them. Assessing the performance
of a novel type of bioinformatics tool, such as gene prioritization
methods, is of crucial importance. Our large—scale benchmark
demonstrates the effectiveness of Endeavour. It should be noted
that the evaluation was carried out at Novartis by S. Schuierer
and U. Dengler independently of the core Endeavour team. In
particular, the Endeavour platform was used as is and no parameter
ﬁne tuning was performed (i.e. all available data sources were
used, see also Supplementary Material). We are aware of the many
pitfalls of benchmarking gene prioritization and function prediction
methods (Myers et al., 2006), so that the performance observed in
cross—validation studies is likely to be higher than that observed in
prospective studies. We have recently conducted such a prospective
validation in Drosophila (Aerts et al., 2009), which also conﬁrmed
further the effectiveness of our strategy.

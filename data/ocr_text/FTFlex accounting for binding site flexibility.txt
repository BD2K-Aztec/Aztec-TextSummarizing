ABSTRACT

Computational solvent mapping finds binding hot spots, determines
their druggability and provides information for drug design. While map-
ping of a ligand-bound structure yields more accurate results, usually
the apo structure serves as the starting point in design. The FTFIex
algorithm, implemented as a server, can modify an apo structure to
yield mapping results that are similar to those of the respective bound
structure. Thus, FTFIex is an extension of our FTMap server, which
only considers rigid structures. FTFIex identifies flexible residues
within the binding site and determines alternative conformations
using a rotamer library. In cases where the mapping results of the
apo structure were in poor agreement with those of the bound struc-
ture, FTFIex was able to yield a modified apo stmcture, which lead
to improved FTMap results. In cases where the mapping results of the
apo and bound structures were in good agreement, no new structure
was predicted.

1 INTRODUCTION

Computational solvent mapping emerged as an important tool
for the identiﬁcation and characterization of binding sites in pro-
teins (Brenke et al., 2009), for determining their druggability
(Kozakov et al., 2011) and for providing information for frag-
ment-based drug design (Hall et al., 2012). Mimicking the radio-
graphic crystallographic approach of multiple solvent crystal
structures (Mattos and Ringe, 1996), this computational
method places molecular probes—small organic molecules con-
taining various functional groups—on a dense grid deﬁned
around the protein, ﬁnds favorable positions using empirical
energy functions, further reﬁnes the selected poses by energy
minimization, clusters the low-energy conformations, calculates
the partition function for each cluster and ranks the clusters on
the basis of their probabilities. The consensus sites are then
deﬁned as those where clusters of different probes overlap;
such consensus sites identify the binding hot spots, i.e. regions

of interactions that substantially contribute to the binding free
energy and hence are of prime importance to drug design.

We have shown that the approximate location of binding hot
spots is generally not affected by conformational changes, and
can be identiﬁed by mapping unbound protein structures even in
cases in which the goal is to ﬁnd small molecule binding sites
in protein—protein interfaces (Kozakov et al., 2011). However,
the exact shape of hot spots may change on ligand binding, and
hence, accounting for protein ﬁexibility provides more accurate
mapping results. Mapping snapshots from molecular dynamics
simulations is a useful but computationally demanding approach
(Ivetac and McCammon, 2012; Landon et al., 2008). Here we
describe the FTFlex algorithm, which incorporates side chain
ﬂexibility considerations into our previously developed compu-
tational mapping method, FTMap (Brenke et al., 2009), in an
efﬁcient fashion, while providing similarly accurate results.

2 METHODS

The algorithm, FTFIex, identiﬁes ﬂexible side chains around an initial hot
spot, generates their alternative conformers via the use of a previously
developed rotamer library (Beglov et al., 2012), and adjusts the side
chains one-by-one to generate a modiﬁed structure with a maximally
opened binding site. Side chains are treated individually, that is, rotamers
are generated for a particular side chain, while all other side chains are
held ﬁxed in their original conformation. FTFIex was tested on a set of
15 apo structures with varying degrees of side chain movement; the results
were compared with the respective bound structures. These targets were
selected from the Astex non-native data set Werdonk et al., 2008) based
on either the presence or absence of side chain motion. Details regarding
the FTFIex algorithm and selection of the data set can be found in the
Supporting Information.

3 RESULTS

To increase efﬁciency, FTFlex only considers residues that
exhibit (i) signiﬁcant ﬂexibility as evident by the large number
of possible rotamers and (ii) signiﬁcant contributions to binding
site size based on RMSD. Thus, FTFlex considers rotamers of
the following residues: Arg, His, Lys, Met, Phe, Trp, Tyr, Asp,
Asn, Glu and Gln. To test this implementation, the FTFlex
algorithm was used to map the apo structures for 15 targets.
The apo structures were ﬁrst mapped using only FTMap—
these structures are referred to as ‘apo structures’ throughout.
The mapping results for apo, FTFIex-modiﬁed apo and bound
structures were compared in terms of % contact frequencies,
deﬁned as the number of non-bonded contacts between probes

Residues

Fig. 1. Selected results from FTFIex test set. (a) Distribution of non-bonded contacts between probe clusters and residues from the mapping of apo,
FTFIex-modiﬁed apo and bound structures. The % contact frequency is deﬁned as the number of non-bonded contacts between probes and each
individual residue, divided by the total number of non-bonded contacts. Results are shown for TGT (left), CDK2 (center) and DHFR (right). (b) Probe
cluster centers in the bound (left, PDB ﬁle 1n2v), apo (center, PDB ﬁle lpud) and modiﬁed apo (right) TGT active sites (tan surface), with the target

ligand (white sticks) shown

and each individual residue, divided by the total number of non-
bonded contacts. We also calculated correlation coefﬁcients be-
tween the % contact frequencies for apo and bound structures,
as well as for modiﬁed apo and bound structures. The more
similar are the probe—protein interactions, the higher the correl-
ation value. Figure 1a shows % contact frequencies for tRNA-
guanine transglycosylase (TGT), left, and cyclin-dependent
kinase 2 (CDK2), center. In both cases, there is a deviation in
the mapping results obtained using FTMap for the apo and
bound structures as indicated by the differences in the probe—
protein interactions. For TGT, this deviation can be attributed to
Tyr106, which blocks the ligand binding site in the apo structure
(Fig. 1b, left and center panels for bound and apo mapping re-
sults, respectively). In the FTFIex-modiﬁed apo structure,
Tyr106 has been rotated out of the site (Fig. 1b, right), which
opens the pocket and yields mapping results in better agreement
with those of the bound structure. A similar improvement is
observed for CDK2 (Fig. 1a, center). For dihydrofolate reduc-
tase (DHF R, PDB ID lai9), there are minimal structural differ-
ences between the apo and bound structures, and FTFIex
predicts no new conformations (Fig. 1a).

4 DISCUSSION

Using F TF lex, we have shown the following results: (i) Mapping
results were improved in cases of poor correlation between
bound and apo structures. (ii) When the mapping results for
apo and bound structures were similar, no new structure was

predicted. (iii) For Tyr, Phe, Trp and His, the new residue con-
formation predicted by FTFlex for the apo structure was similar
to the conformation found in the bound structure.

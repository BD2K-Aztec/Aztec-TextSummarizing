Abstract

Motivation: The deconvolution of isoform expression from RNA—seq remains challenging because
of non—uniform read sampling and subtle differences among isoforms.

Results: We present a weighted—log—likelihood expectation maximization method on isoform quan—
tification (Wele). Wele integrates an effective bias removal with a weighted expectation maxi—
mization (EM) algorithm to distribute reads among isoforms efficiently. The weight represents the
oversampling or undersampling of sequence reads and is estimated through a generalized Poisson
model without any presumption on the bias sources and formats. Wele significantly improves
the quantification of isoform and gene expression as well as the derived exon inclusion rates.
It provides robust expression estimates across different laboratories and protocols, which is
valuable for the integrative analysis of RNA—seq. For the recent single—cell RNA—seq data, Wele
also provides the opportunity to distinguish bias heterogeneity from true biological heterogeneity
and uncovers smaller cell—to—cell expression variability.

1 Introduction

The rapid advances in high—throughput sequencing technologies pro—
vide us an opportunity to dissect transcriptomes with unprecedented
resolution (Cloonan et 61]., 2008; Marguerat and Bahler, 2010;
Mortazavi et 61]., 2008; Nagalakshmi et 61]., 2008; Wang et 61].,
2009). Based on RNA—seq studies, alternative splicing has become
more and more appreciated as a key mechanism in higher eukary-
otes to eXpand transcriptomes by generating multiple isoforms from
a single gene (Brett et 61]., 2002; Graveley, 2001; Nilsen and
Graveley, 2010). For example, it has been reported that up to 95%
of human multi—exon genes undergo alternative splicing (Pan et 61].,
2008). Therefore, an accurate quantification of transcript isoforms
is important to understand gene regulation through alternative
splicing.

However, the accurate estimation of transcript isoform expres-
sion from RNA—seq data remains a challenge. Many state—of—the—art
approaches initially assumed that short sequence reads in RNA—seq
were uniformly sampled from each transcript. However, the pos—
ition—level read count often demonstrates larger variation than eX—
pected under the uniform sampling assumption (Li et 61]., 2010;
Srivastava and Chen, 2010), and shows enormous inter—gene and
intra—gene bias heterogeneity. As a result, read counts need to be ad—
justed in a dynamic way for the abundance quantification. Add—0n
functions have been introduced to handle the overdispersion in the
methods of isoform expression estimation (Li and Dewey, 2011;
Roberts et 61]., 2011). These methods usually assumed a constant
bias factor for each relative position of genes or simply corrected the
sequence—specific bias caused by random hexamer priming.

However, the overall bias is complicated and caused by multiple fac—
tors including many unknown ones, and the bias pattern can vary
significantly across different regions and different protocols (Hansen
et 61]., 2010; Li et 61]., 2010; Roberts et 61]., 2011). In light of these
facts, previously we proposed to use the generalized Poisson (GP)
model to estimate the bias in a data—adaptive way without any pre—
sumption (Srivastava and Chen, 2010). However, this has not yet
been integrated into the isoform expression deconvolution.

In this article, we propose a robust isoform—expression quantifi—
cation method: Weighted—log—likelihood expectation maximization
Isoform Quantification (WemIQ). Given gene annotation, WemIQ
can accurately quantify RNA products at both the gene and tran—
script isoform level from RNA—seq data. WemIQ uses the expect—
ation maximization (EM) strategy to distribute reads among
different isoforms and incorporates the fragment length information
of paired—end reads. More importantly, bias in RNA—seq is corrected
by assigning different weights to reads from different gene regions
when calculating the weighted log—likelihood. The weighted—log—
likelihood approach enables efficient isoform expression deconvolu—
tion with appropriate bias removal.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we applied
WemIQ to both simulated and real data sets. Simulation studies
show that, in both transcript—isoform—centric and exon—centric quan—
tification, our approach significantly outperforms the state—of—the—
art software, such as Cufflinks (Trapnell et al., 2010), RSEM (Li
and Dewey, 2011) and SpliceTrap (Wu et 61]., 2011a). Cufflinks and
RSEM quantify isoform expression, while SpliceTrap quantifies
exon inclusion rates in an exon—centric way. Unlike other simulation
studies which generated reads based on the uniform assumption (Li
and Dewey, 2011; Mortazavi et 61]., 2008) or based on a pipeline in
consideration of only a few bias factors (Griebel et 61]., 2012), our
simulations generated reads with various bias patterns to mimic the
real situation. Analyses on a variety of real RNA—seq data sets also
show that our bias correction is more effective; our expression quan—
tification is more accurate; and the expression estimates are more
robust across different laboratories and different protocols. For the
application to the recent single—cell RNA—seq data, interestingly, we
found that compared with population—cell RNA—seq, single-cell
RNA—seq usually exhibits a larger bias variation across different
genes or different regions of the same gene, and WemIQ meets the
challenges by separating bias heterogeneity from true biological het—
erogeneity by obtaining smaller but still significant cell-to-cell
variability.

2 Methods

2.1 Bias estimation in Wele and weight assignment
for each read

As in our previous paper (Srivastava and Chen, 2010), we separated
a gene into non—redundant virtual exons. An overlapped exon would
be split into multiple virtual exons (see Supplementary Fig. S1). Let
X represent the number of mapped reads starting from a certain pos—
ition within a virtual exon, and it follows a GP distribution with

ea i“ *W ! =0,1,2,...
P(X_x)_{ ( +x) 6 /x x , (1)
0 x>qif2<0

where 2 represents the average bias effort from all possible sources
that makes the read deviating from the uniform sampling, and 0 is
the underlying true expression. Besides, 61(6124) is the largest posi—
tive integer for which 0 —l— 612 > 0 when 2 < 0. The limit on q when 2
< 0 is imposed to ensure that there are at least five classes with

non—zero probabilities and the truncation errors (i.e.
2:0 P(X : x) is slightly smaller than 1) do not affect practical ap—
plication (Consul, 1989). Let 2 denote the MLE of 2, E denote
the sample mean of the mapped read counts. Then the MLE of 0
can be expressed as 0 = (1 — 2B, which is a weighted sample mean
and it preserves the true expression after the bias removal.
Therefore, for each read, we assign a weight w = 1 — 2 to adjust for
its bias.

2.2 Isoform and gene expression quantification in
Wele

For a considered gene with m transcript isoforms, we estimate the
fraction of reads coming from each isoform 7 : {t1,. . ., 7),. . ., 7m} by
the EM strategy. Specifically, the observed data are the read set R
: {r1,. . ., 7),. . ., 7n} mapped to this gene, where n is the total number
of reads. The hidden data are the reads’ origins of transcript iso—
forms: 77 : {7T1,. . ., 76),. . ., an}. 7t,- 21' if 1’,- belongs to isoform 1'. Then
the probability that 1’,- comes from isoform j with the starting pos—
ition b,- and ending position 6,- can be represented as:

P{r,- comes from isoform j}
= P{B,‘ = bi,E,‘ = 6,", TE,‘ 2 
= P{B.~ = bzlni = i, Tl’PiEi = el- I3: = biﬂz = i, em = i I 1,} <2)
1 I 717:.
: L_,i >< P{1,-,,-} x If I)
where L/l- is the effective length of transcript j, and it can be can be
approximated by L/i : L,- — E(l) where L,- is the length of transcript
j and EU) is the average fragment length (either inferred from reads
mapped to single—isoform genes or specified by users). lial- denotes the
fragment length of r,- if the read comes from isoform j and is a
Gaussian distributed random variable with parameters inferred
from single-isoform genes or specified by users. P(liy) : 0 if r,- is in—
compatible with transcript j. Then the complete—data log likelihood
for a regular EM algorithm can be expressed as

11 m

1
21(7'61' =   >< P{l,'7i} X If) . 

i=1 i=1

log(P{R, 77 | 1:) 2

However, considering bias in RNA—seq, we assign each read 1’,- a
different credibility weight w,- = 1 — 2,. If r,- spans multiple virtual
exons, the first virtual exon was used for the bias assignment. As we
mentioned, the bias level 2,- is estimated from its corresponding vir-
tual exon in a data—adaptive way. Our proposed weighted complete—
data log likelihood is:

weighted log(P{R, 77 | 1:)
= Z Z tut-1(a- = 010% (F X P {1131'} X Ti) (4)
i=1 {:1 I
The expectation and maximization steps are iterated to estimate

1:. The expression level of isoform j is then estimated as:

n n  >< PULI'} X Ti
9i=ZwiP{ﬂi=ilfiabia€i}=Zwi m '1
1:1 1:1 '  X P{li7i1} X Ti/
/’=1 7

 

The gene expression is estimated as the sum of the isoform ex—
pression: 02::10i. The relative expression of isoform j is
defined as (3,- : Hi/H, and the relative estimation error can be ex—
pressed as ZZ1|5i — (SH/(3i.

We aligned sequence reads to the reference genome using
TopHat (version 2.04) (Trapnell et 61]., 2009). The resultant SAM

files were taken into WemIQ and Cufflinks (version 2.02) for iso-
form quantification. RSEM (version 1.2.4) and SpliceTrap (version
0.90.5) took raw reads as input and performed the alignment intern-
ally by calling Bowtie (Langmead et al., 2009). MMSEQ (version
1.0.8) (Turro et al., 2011) was also used in the performance com—
parison for simulations under real gene structures. For MMSEQ, the
isoform percentage was calculated as the ratio between the isoform
expression and the gene expression estimates. Their Gibbs
Sampling—based estimates were also considered in Section 4 of
Supplementary Text S1. STAR (version 2.3.0) was utilized for part
of the read mapping (details in Section 5 of Supplementary Text S1).
The implementation of WemIQ is efficient. Starting from SAM files,
it only takes WemIQ approximately 8 min and <2 Gb memory to
estimate gene and isoform expression based on a total of 5.6 million
read pairs.

2.3 Normalization of gene and isoform expressions

Let G, mg and L/gy denote the total gene number, the isoform num-
ber for gene g and effective length of transcript j in gene g. Our
‘isoform-reads per kilo base per million bias—corrected reads’ is
defined as:

/ 0 '

Note that we omitted subscript g in the previous paragraph for ease

3. Results

3.1 Bias heterogeneity needs to be properly handled in
isoform expression quantification

Bias may arise from every step of the RNA—seq experiment in a dy—
namic manner and hence is intrinsically heterogeneous across differ—
ent genes or even across different regions within the same gene. To
explore the extent of sequencing bias heterogeneity, we first studied
the overdispersion variation in several human tissues (Illumina
BodyMap2 transcriptome). As expected, for different exons of the
same transcript, the degree of overdispersion, represented by 2 in
the GP model (Srivastava and Chen, 2010), shows a large range. For
example, the largest 2 difference within each gene had a median of
0.20—0.32 in a variety of tissues (brain, muscle, liver and kidney). In
addition, different genes exhibited different bias. For instance, the
gene—level bias reﬂected by the median of exon—level 2 for a gene
could be as high as 0.95 or as low as 0.21 in the kidney tissue. Such
intra—gene and inter—gene bias heterogeneity need to be considered in
the quantification of isoform expression (more discussions in
Section 1 of Supplementary Text S1 and Fig. S2).

Although bias in RNA—seq has received much attention, the cur—
rent bias removal methods are still far from optimal. To demon-
strate the inappropriateness of the current bias removal methods, we
studied the expression of single—isoform genes in these human tissues
(Illumina BodyMap2 transcriptome). If read fragments are sampled
uniformly along a single-isoform gene, the position—level read count
is expected to follow a Poisson distribution. The observed extra het—
erogeneity of read counts reﬂects RNA—seq bias. We performed the
Kolmogorov—Smirnov (KS) test to compare the observed read—count
distribution with the expected Poisson distribution. A KS statistic
near zero indicates good fitting, while a lager KS statistic indicates
more severe bias. The solid lines (no bias correction) in Figure 1
clearly show severe deviations from the uniform sampling in real

Fig. 1. Comparison of different methods for bias correction in RNA-seq. The
cumulative distribution functions of the KS statistics are plotted for the uncor-
rected data (‘_non'), data whose bias has been corrected by WemIQ
(‘_WemlO'), data corrected for the sequence-specific bias ('_seq') and data
corrected for both the sequence-specific and the positional bias (‘_seq+pos')

data as the majority of genes display a large KS statistic. We then
corrected the sequence—specific bias from random hexamer priming
and the bias from relative positions similarly to those in Hansen
et al. (2010) and Wu et al. (2011b) in order to understand whether
these biases could account for most, if not all, of the deviations (de—
tails in Section 2 of Supplementary Text S1). Surprisingly, the devi—
ation from the uniformity was even worse (the dashed—dot lines in
Fig. 1). Notably, Cufﬂinks has recently changed to use only the se—
quence—specific bias correction in light of the reduced accuracy
caused by positional bias correction for some RNA—seq datasets. We
therefore corrected the sequence—specific bias alone. However, the
performance was still worse than that without any correction, and
similar to the performance when both types of bias were removed
(the dotted lines in Fig. 1 and they overlapped the dashed—dot lines
with slight differences).

Different from the other bias removal approaches, WemIQ uses
the GP—based model which captures the bias directly from the read—
count distribution without specifying the bias source (Srivastava and
Chen, 2010). WemIQ assigns each read a credibility weight w = 1
—2 according to its bias level 2 estimated from GP (details given in
Section 2). As shown in Figure 1 (boxplots given in Supplementary
Fig. S3), our correction (dashed lines) effectively removes the bias in
all considered tissues. For example, in the muscle tissue, up to
90.0% of the single—isoform genes had a KS statistic <0.1 after the
bias correction by GP. This percentage decreased to 52.4% with the
traditional positional and sequence—specific bias corrections. Hence,
WemIQ removed the bias effectively. Additional data sets were used
to further evaluate the performance of the WemIQ bias correction.
Similar results were obtained (Supplementary Fig. S4). However, it
is worth pointing out that the bias correction was usually integrated
into the expression quantification process. It is difficult to study
the benefit from the bias correction alone for these expres—
sion—quantification methods. However, the large bias heterogeneity
both within and across genes justifies the immediate necessity of
deliberate handling of the read non-uniformity.

Accurate and robust isoform quantification method

 

3.2 Simulations show improved quantification of
isoform expression by WemIQ

Our WemIQ removes the bias heterogeneity in RNA—seq when
deconvoluting isoform—level expression through a weighted EM al—
gorithm, as shown in the ﬂow chart in Supplementary Figure S1. We
performed a variety of simulations to demonstrate the improvement
over other methods (Supplementary Fig. SS). Instead of using the
generative model with the uniform—sampling assumption or only a
few known bias sources (Griebel et al., 2012), we simulated read
counts with overdispersion to mimic the dynamic nature of real
RNA—seq experiment. For a fair comparison, the negative binomial
instead of the GP distribution was used to generate the reads (details
in Section 3 of Supplementary Text S1), even though the latter has
been shown to better fit the read—count distribution in real RNA-seq
data (Srivastava and Chen, 2010) and additional simulations based
on GP also demonstrated the significant improvement from WemIQ
(results not shown).

We started from a simple gene model with two transcript iso—
forms: the longer one contains five 25 0—nucleotide (nt) exons; while
the shorter isoform lacks the second exon (Supplementary Fig. SSA).
A total of 27.8 million 50—base pair (bp) pair—end reads were gener—
ated for 1000 cases of this gene model. We also turned on the bias
correction for Cufﬂinks and RSEM. For the simulated datasets, the
bias correction in RSEM improved its performance while Cufflinks
reported similar results regardless of its bias removal. For the real
data analyses in Sections 3.6—3.7, the results without the bias correc—
tion were similar or slightly worse than those with the bias correc—
tion (details in Section 5 of Supplementary Text S1). Hereinafter, we
adopted their internal bias correction options in RSEM and
Cufﬂinks in comparison with WemIQ. As shown in Figure 2A,
WemIQ significantly outperforms Cufflinks and RSEM no matter
when the longer (‘L’) or the shorter (‘cas2’) isoform was the minor
isoform. For example, when the shorter isoform was the minor one,
the mean relative error of isoform percentages for WemIQ was 0.20
as compared with 0.38 for Cufflinks and 0.36 for RSEM
(Ps < 2.2 x 10‘16, paired Wilcoxon tests).

Despite the advances of sequencing technologies, some regions
or genes still have limited sequence reads, either because of low ex—
pression levels or lower mappability (e.g. repetitive regions).
Therefore, we simulated another group of relatively low—coverage
data with the average position—level read count of 1.1 for the two—
isoform gene model. WemIQ still significantly outperformed the
other methods (Fig. 2B, Ps < 2.2 x 10‘16, paired Wilcoxon tests).

We extended the two—isoform gene model to a three—isoform
model by adding a third isoform (‘cas4’) in which the fourth exon
was skipped (Supplementary Fig. SSB). Consistent with the two—
isoform cases, WemIQ greatly improved the estimation of relative
expression of isoforms (Fig. 2C). The mean relative errors were
around 0.38—0.5 8 for WemIQ while they were as high as 0.74—1.10
for the other two methods. When the long (‘L’) isoform was minor,
the isoform quantification became more challenging. This is possibly
due to the limited number of the read fragments that spanned the
two cassette exons and uniquely belonged to the longer isoform.
WemIQ still achieved the smallest estimation errors (Fig. 2C). Under
this scenario, the chance for Cufflinks and RSEM to falsely declare
the minor isoform among the three isoforms was as high as 0.18 and
0.27, while the chance was only 0.04 for WemIQ.

To compare the performance of the models on isoforms with
subtle differences, we considered another three—isoform model with
a cassette—exon event (‘cas2’) and an alternative—splice—site event
(‘ASS’). The alternative splice sites were separated by only 15 nt
(Supplementary Fig. S2C). WemIQ again demonstrated significant

improvements (Fig. 2D). For example, the mean relative estimation
error of WemIQ was 0.43 when the long (‘L’) isoform was the minor
one. It increased to 0.80 and 0.66 in Cufflinks and RSEM, respect—
ively (Ps < 3.8 X 10T8, paired Wilcoxon tests).

3.3 WemIQ improves isoform expression quantification
despite incomplete gene annotations

Although RNA—seq provides an opportunity to dissect the complex—
ity of transcriptomes, it is still challenging to reconstruct transcript
isoforms from RNA—seq ab initio. In a recent survey of an array of
computational methods with multiple alignment protocols, the high-
est sensitivity is only about 21% and the highest precision is about
60% (Steijger et al., 2013). Our WemIQ requires the pre—assembled
gene annotations as input. To understand how incomplete annota—
tion would affect isoform quantification, we tested the performance
of our model and others through simulation studies where some
existing isoforms were missed by annotations.

There are many possibilities of how a missing isoform may affect
the quantification of remaining known isoforms. The scenario that
makes the deconvolution more challenging is when the missing iso-
form is very similar to one of the known isoforms. To simulate such
a case, we built on top of the two—isoform gene model, and assumed
a third isoform that was lowly expressed and missing in the annota—
tion. The missing isoform was similar to the longer (or the shorter)
transcript, but used an alternative splice site 100 nt away from the
original splice site at the fourth exon (Supplementary Fig. SSD and
SSE). As shown in Figure 3, WemIQ still significantly outperforms
RSEM and Cufﬂinks. For example, when the missing isoform was
truncated from the longer one (‘ML’), the mean relative error for the
two known isoforms was 0.56 for WemIQ, but increased to 0.74

3.4 WemIQ provides more accurate and robust
estimation of exon inclusion rates

Exon—centric studies require the accurate inference of the inclusion
rates of cassette exons. We compared the performance of WemIQ,
Cufﬂinks, RSEM and SpliceTrap on this task in the two—isoform
model (Fig. 4). Specifically, we considered six scenarios where the
simulated true inclusion rates of the cassette exon were 1/5, 1/4, 1/3,
2/3, 3/4 and 4/5, respectively (the red lines in Fig. 4). In all cases,
WemIQ outperformed Cufflinks, RSEM and SpliceTrap by provid—
ing more accurate estimation of inclusion rates with smaller vari—
ation (Fig. 4). When the exon was included at a relatively low level
(i.e. 1/5—1/3), WemIQ still accurately inferred the inclusion rate
while the performance of the other three methods was unsatisfac—
tory. In general, Cufﬂinks and RSEM tended to overestimate the in—
clusion rates and SpliceTrap underestimated the inclusion rates.
These deviations were further compounded by a large variation of
the estimates (Fig. 4). In studies of splicing regulation, a difference
of 0.1 in the inclusion rate is usually of high interest. We found that
18.9%, 21.6% and 40.9% of the exons analyzed by Cufﬂinks,
RSEM and SpliceTrap, respectively, exhibited an inclusion rate devi—
ating from the true rate by more than 0.1. Conversely, only 1.4% of
cassette exons in WemIQ had such an error.

3.5 WemIQ provides accurate isoform quantification for
simulations based on real gene structures

To test the performance of WemIQ under complicated gene struc—
tures, we also selected 78 genes with a variety of annotation struc—
tures from the Ensemble annotation. We then generated RNA—seq
reads that shared similar bias characteristics as real data (see details
in Section 4 of Supplementary Text S1). Besides, another quantifica—
tion method MMSEQ (Turro et al., 2011) was included in the com—
parison here. The errors of isoform percentage estimates are shown
in Supplementary Figure S6. WemIQ demonstrates lower estimation

True Isolorm Percent

Fig. 5. Isoform percentage estimation for simulations based on real gene an-
notation structures. WemlO still demonstrates improved estimation accuracy
with better agreement with the true percentages and smaller number of iso-
forms with large errors (red dots, lestimate—true value| 20.1)

errors than those for Cufﬂinks, RSEM and MMSEQ (Ps < 0.0007,
Wilcoxon tests). Linear regression models were used to evaluate the
consistency between the true and estimated isoform percentages.
The R—squared value for WemIQ was as high as 0.9273, larger than
0.879 for cufﬂinks, 0.8748 for RSEM and 0.883 for MMSEQ. In
addition, WemIQ provides noticeably smaller number of isoform es—
timates with errors 20.1 (smaller number of red dots in Figure 5 as
compared with other methods), suggesting improved estimation ac—
curacy. Then we extended this simulation scheme to the genome—
wide scale by selecting the annotation structures of all the multi—iso—
form autosomal genes in the Ensemble annotation (version 75).
WemIQ still provided improved isoform—level estimation
(Supplementary Fig. S7).

3.6 Comparison of gene expression estimation with
qRT—PCR

In addition to the advantages in the estimation of relative isoform
expression and exon inclusion rates, WemIQ also provides more
accurate overall gene expression estimation (i.e. the sum of isoform

expressions). We used the TaqMan qRT—PCR results on ~1000

genes in the Microarray Quality Control Project as a benchmark for
gene expression measurements (Shi et al., 2006). Then we applied
WemIQ, Cufﬂinks and RSEM on a set of 50—bp paired—end reads
from the same human brain sample used in the qRT-PCR experi-
ments and compared the estimates from both platforms (Au et al.,
2010). The Pearson correlation of the log scale qRT—PCR and
WemIQ gene quantifications was 0.739, higher than those of
Cufﬂinks (0.681) and RSEM (0.700), indicating an improved overall
gene expression estimation. The scatter plots of the RNA—seq quan—
tification by different methods versus the qRT—PCR measurements
are shown in Supplementary Figure S8. In addition, we investigated
the gene—level estimation when its transcripts are heavily overlapped
through simulations (Section 6 of Supplementary Text S1). WemIQ
still performs better than other considered methods (Supplementary
Fig. 811).

3.7 Robustness of expression estimates across
laboratories and protocols

It is well known that even in the same tissue, biases in RNA—seq data
usually vary significantly across different laboratories or protocols
(Hansen et al., 2010; Li et al., 2010; Roberts et al., 2011).
Therefore, a robust mRNA quantification method providing consist—
ent estimation is valuable, particularly for the comparison or inte-
grative analysis of RNA—seq data across laboratories. Here, we
tested WemIQ, Cufflinks and RSEM on four RNA—seq datasets
from two laboratories (‘Caltech’ and ‘Cshl’) with different proto—
cols. Each laboratory provided two RNA—seq technical replicates for
the GM12878 cells.

We observed a small but significant difference in the 2 (i.e. the
bias estimator) distribution in the four data sets, demonstrating dif—
ferent bias levels across laboratories. For example, the median 2 for
the ‘Caltech’ data (without preserving the strand information) were
only 0.175 and 0.230, but they increased to 0.270 and 0.256 for the
‘Cshl’ data (preserving the strand information) (Ps<2.2 x 10‘16,
paired Wilcoxon tests). To evaluate the estimation consistency
across laboratories, we calculated the expression fold change be—
tween the two laboratories. The median gene expression fold change
(i.e. the ratio of the larger value to the smaller value) was 1.74 for
WemIQ, consistently <1.86 for Cufflinks and 2.05 for RSEM
(P=5.8 x 10—11 for Cufflinks, and P < 2.2 x 10—16 for RSEM;
paired Wilcoxon tests). However, ideally the median fold change
should be around one to enable the direct cross—laboratory analysis.
We further focused on the 628 highly expressed genes (details in
Section 5 of Supplementary Text S1) because the estimation power
for them is usually higher. The median fold change from WemIQ
reduced to 1.47, still remarkably less than those from Cufflinks and
RSEM (1.68 and 1.80, Ps < 2.2 x 10—16; paired Wilcoxon tests). In
addition, we found that WemIQ consistently provided less number
of genes with large expression fold changes (Fig. 6A). Specifically,
only 20.5% of the highly expressed genes showed more than 2—fold
expression changes, compared with 35.0% for Cufﬂinks and 42.0%
for RSEM (scatter plots in Supplementary Fig. S9).

Similarly, WemIQ provided more consistent expression estimates
at the isoform level. The median fold change of expressed isoforms
between the two laboratories was 1.83 for WemIQ, significantly less
than those for Cufflinks and RSEM (1.92 and 2.09; P = 1.4 x 10—10
for Cufﬂinks, and P < 2.2 X 10‘16 for RSEM; paired Wilcoxon
tests). We also selected 1938 highly expressed isoforms (details in
Section 5 of Supplementary Text S1), the median fold change in
WemIQ was only 1.36, but increased to 1.50 in Cufflinks and 1.66
in RSEM (Ps<2.2 >< 10_16, paired Wilcoxon tests). Furthermore,

centage of genes (or isoforms) exhibiting a fold change greater than the

tories are pooled together

12.7% of the highly expressed isoforms showed a larger than 2—fold
expression change in WemIQ, compared with 23.8% and 32.9% in
Cufﬂinks and RSEM, respectively (Fig. 6B, scatter plots in
Supplementary Fig. S10). All these results suggest the improved
robustness of isoform level estimation across laboratories.

3.8 WemIQ accounts for the bias heterogeneity in
single—cell RNA—seq data

There is a rapidly emerging need to dissect the transcriptome from a
tiny quantity of RNA (e.g. RNA from a single cell) (Adiconis et al.,
2013; Shalek et al., 2013). Starting from very limited amount of
genetic material, many more rounds of amplification are necessary
during the library construction steps, possibly resulting in different
bias patterns and additional computational challenges (Adiconis
et al., 2013; Griebel et al., 2012). Here, we applied our method on
21 RNA-seq samples, including 18 single—cell and 3 population—cell
RNA—seq data sets for the mouse bone—marrow—derived dendritic
cells (Shalek et al., 2013).

The degree of bias is more variable in single—cell RNA-seq than
population—cell RNA—seq. Compared with population—cell RNA—seq
(‘P1—P3’), single-cell RNA—seq (‘C1—C18’) demonstrated larger vari—
ation among exon—level bias within a gene (Fig. 7A, Ps<4.1 ><
10_16, Wilcoxon tests). As shown in the barplot of Figure 7B, the
gene—level bias in a single—cell RNA—seq also varies a lot across dif—
ferent genes, demonstrating more severe bias heterogeneity across
genes than that of population-cell RNA—seq (Ps < 2.6 X 10‘11,
Wilcoxon tests). Besides, we calculated the pairwise gene—level 2 cor—
relation between the samples and provided the heatmap in
Figure 7B. We found that the largest Pearson correlation coefficients
were among the population—cell RNA—seq data sets (0.55 9—0.610),
and the correlation between single—cell RNA—seq data sets (or be—
tween single—cell and population—cell RNA—seq) was much lower
(0279—05 83). The above results suggest that bias from single—cell
RNA—seq varies more across genes or different regions of a specific
gene than population—cell RNA—seq. Therefore, the heterogeneity of
the observed read counts among individual single cells was severely
complicated by the bias heterogeneity among single—cell RNA-seq
experiments. The appropriate bias correction is essential to dissect
real transcriptome differences among individual cells.

By correcting the heterogeneous bias patterns through WemIQ,
we obtained lower cell—to—cell expression variability than other
methods (Fig. 8). Specifically, we selected 991 highly expressed

genes (details in Section 5 of Supplementary Text S1) and calculated
the coefficient of variation (CV) values of the 18 single—cell expres—
sion estimates for each gene. CV is often used to describe the extent
of variability with respect to the mean, and a larger CV value sug—
gests larger data variability. The median CV for WemIQ was 0.78,
significantly less than 0.87 and 0.89 for Cufflinks and RSEM
(Fig. 8A, Ps < 2.2 X 10‘16, paired Wilcoxon tests). Besides, 907
highly expressed isoforms were selected and similarly we observed
significantly smaller CV values from WemIQ (Fig. 8B, 0.76 versus
0.84 and 0.85 for Cufﬂinks and RSEM; Ps<2.2 x 10‘16, paired

Wilcoxon tests). Although the cell—to—cell variability was smaller, it
was still significantly larger than the CV from population-cell RNA-
seq (Ps<2.2 x 10‘16, paired Wilcoxon tests for highly expressed
genes or isoforms).

Furthermore, we focused on expression fold changes between
the values averaged across the 18 single—cell estimates and those
from each of the population—cells (e.g. >10 000 cells) data. At both
gene and isoform level, WemIQ provided less number of genes or
isoforms with large fold changes. For example, only 25.9% and
25.3% of the highly expressed genes and isoforms exhibited at least
2—fold expression changes, obviously less than those from Cufflinks
and RSEM (31.2% and 30.3% for Cufflinks, 36.8% and 35.2% for
RSEM).

4 Discussion

Sequencing bias during RNA—seq experiments hinders the deconvo—
lution of transcript isoform expression, because the expression het—
erogeneity caused by multiple isoforms of the same gene is mixed
with that caused by different biases for different regions. Hence, iso—
form—level expression estimation from RNA-seq experiments is still
a challenging problem and lines of methods were proposed for more
accurate quantification (Bohnert and Ratsch, 2010; Hu et al., 2014;
Huang et al., 2013; Li and Dewey, 2011; Mezlini et al., 2013; Suo
et al., 2014). We previously developed a hierarchical Bayesian
model (BASIS) to identify differentially isoforms without quantify—
ing the absolute isoform expression for each condition (Zheng and
Chen, 2009). However, the estimation of the absolute expression
levels of transcript isoforms requires a more delicate handling of
bias in RNA—seq. Our GP—based model can effectively separate bias
from true expression signals (Srivastava and Chen, 2010). However,
the simple integration of the GP probability mass function to the iso—
form deconvolution makes the computation infeasible.

WemIQ targets the challenges of accurate isoform quantification
by an efficient weighted—log—likelihood—based EM algorithm. Reads
from different genomic regions were assigned with different weights
according to the degree of the sequencing bias. The bias parameter
was estimated in a data—adaptive manner without any assumption
about the bias source and format. The weight assignment can be
treated as a ‘weighted sampling’ scheme to penalize or compensate
oversampled or undersampled sequence reads.

Simulation studies with simple and real gene structures demon—
strated that WemIQ significantly improved the expression estima—
tion from both the isoform—centric and the exon—centric perspectives
under a variety of gene structures. WemIQ can handle the additional
overdispersion caused by missing transcripts and thus provides more
robust estimations over Cufflinks and RSEM when gene annotation
is incomplete. Besides, we compared the overall gene expression lev—
els with other platforms such as the qRT—PCR results and WemIQ
showed an improved estimation. It is worth mentioning that al-
though qRT—PCR may not perfectly measure gene expression, it rep—
resents another independent platform with potentially different bias
sources. Due to the lack of benchmark dataset, it is difficult to dir-
ectly compare the isoform expression measurements. In addition to
the improved estimation accuracy, WemIQ also provides very ro—
bust estimates based on the study of sub—sampled reads from a real
RNA—seq data set (details in Section 7 of Supplementary Text S1,
Supplementary Figs S12 and S13). On the other hand, we should
note that there may be some extreme gene structures with many iso—
forms and each of them containing only a few nucleotide differ—
ences. The power of isoform quantification for these cases is limited

and waits for more advanced sequencing technologies with more
and longer sequence reads.

We also applied our method on a variety of real RNA—seq data,
including the ENCODE data from different laboratories and single—
cell sequencing data with very low input genetic materials. Results
demonstrate that WemIQ provides more robust expression estima—
tion at both the gene and isoform level. Therefore, WemIQ may
serve as a powerful tool to make direct comparison across different
experiments. We also note that in the cross—laboratory comparison,
the median fold change was still higher than the ideal value of 1.0
and could be as large as 1.735 even for highly expressed genes or
isoforms. Since we simply used the total bias—corrected reads to per—
form the normalization across samples, additional improvements on
the normalization may further help the cross—laboratory analysis of
RNA—seq data. In addition, we observed larger bias heterogeneity
from single-cell RNA—seq data than the population—cell RNA—seq,
which further complicated the exploration of true cell—to—cell expres—
sion variation. Due to the careful read weighting scheme, WemIQ
discovered smaller expression variability in single cells.

WemIQ utilizes only reads that are uniquely mapped to the gen—
ome for the expression quantification. For earlier RNA—seq data
where the read length is usually 36 nucleotides or less, it might be an
issue to discard reads mapped to multiple genomic locations.
However, with the development of sequencing technologies for
longer reads, the effect of discarding multireads could be small for
majority genes.

In summary, we propose WemIQ to quantify gene expression
from the RNA—seq data with the transcript isoform resolution.
It separates sequencing bias heterogeneity across different genomic
regions or different laboratories from expression heterogeneity due
to different transcript isoforms or different single cells. WemIQ can
serve as a powerful quantification tool for transcriptomics.

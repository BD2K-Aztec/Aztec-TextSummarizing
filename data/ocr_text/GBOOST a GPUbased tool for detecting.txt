ABSTRACT

Motivation: Collecting millions of genetic variations is feasible
with the advanced genotyping technology. With a huge amount of
genetic variations data in hand, developing efficient algorithms to
carry out the gene—gene interaction analysis in a timely manner
has become one of the key problems in genome-wide association
studies (GWAS). Boolean operation-based screening and testing
(BOOST), a recent work in GWAS, completes gene—gene interaction
analysis in 2.5 days on a desktop computer. Compared with central
processing units (CPUs), graphic processing units (GPUs) are highly
parallel hardware and provide massive computing resources. We are,
therefore, motivated to use GPUs to further speed up the analysis of
gene—gene interactions.

Results: We implement the BOOST method based on a GPU
framework and name it GBOOST. GBOOST achieves a 40-fold
speedup compared with BOOST. |t completes the analysis of
Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium Type 2 Diabetes (WTCCC
T2D) genome data within 1.34h on a desktop computer equipped
with Nvidia GeForce GTX 285 display card.

Availability: GBOOST code is available at http://bioinformatics.ust

1 INTRODUCTION

Interaction patterns of single—nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) can
be used to interpret genetic disease risks in individuals. With the
advances of technologies, the burden of collecting genome—wide
DNA sequence variations has been lifted. The burst of genotype
data leads to an urge of efﬁcient algorithms to analyze many
genome—wide association studies (GWAS) data in a reasonable
period of time. Acomprehensive review (Cordell, 2009) summarized
some popular methods in detecting gene—gene interactions. PLINK
was recommended as the most computationally feasible method
for detecting gene—gene interactions in genome—wide data. It was
reported that PLINK ﬁnished the pairwise interaction examination
of 89 294 SNPs selected from the WTCCC Crohn disease dataset
with ~5000 samples in 14 days (Cordell, 2009).

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Recently, Wan et al. (2010) proposed a fast method, named
BOOST, to examine all pairwise interactions in genome—wide
case—control studies. BOOST completed the pairwise interaction
analysis of human genome data with ~350 000 SNPs and ~5000
samples on a computer with 3 GHz central processing unit (CPU)
and 4 GB memory in 60 h.

However, we can foresee that the growth of data will overwhelm
BOOST in the near future. Ma et al. (2008) suggested that
the analysis time in GWAS can be largely reduced by parallel
computing. The development of graphical processing units (GPUs)
enables modern display cards to have hundreds of cores, providing
a high memory bandwidth at a low price. A recent GPU
implementation of the multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR)
method (Greene et al., 2010) has signiﬁcantly reduced the time
required for detecting gene—gene interactions. The demand of
massive memory operations in collecting contingency tables and
independence of analyzing different SNP pairs in BOOST make it
suitable to implement BOOST in GPU. Here we propose GBOOST,
a GPU implementation of BOOST. GBOOST is able to ﬁnish the
genome—wide interaction analysis of a typical dataset on a single
workstation within a few hours.

2 METHODS

GBOOST is a software package targeting at gene—gene interaction analysis
of large genome data. It is a C++ parallel implementation of the BOOST
method using Compute Uniﬁed Device Architecture runtime application
programming interface (Corporation, 2008).

Fig. 2. A snapshot of a pathway graph generated from 20 interaction pairs from one GBOOST result. Each node is labeled by its SNP name and the node
value is the marginal association score from the association analysis. The edge value is the interaction score of the linked nodes (i.e. SNP pairs). Scaling,
rotation and translation are available in the pathway graph. Various functions are also avaliable to remove or highlight components in the pathway graph. The

layout can be interactively customized.

The computational burden of BOOST lies in the screening stage. Thus,
GBOOST modiﬁes input data structures and parallelizes computations in
the screening stage. Figure 1 gives the key differences between BOOST
and GBOOST. Please refer to the Supplementary data for the detailed
implementation of GBOOST.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Table 1 shows the performance of BOOST and GBOOST
on different datasets. It also provides basic visualization by
using two publicly available libraries JFreeChart (http://www.jfree
.org/jfreechart) and JUNG (http://jung.sourceforge.net/). Figure 2
presents a pathway graph example generated from one GBOOST
result.

In our future work, we plan to extend GBOOST to support
execution on multiple GPUs and explore new memory optimization
techniques.

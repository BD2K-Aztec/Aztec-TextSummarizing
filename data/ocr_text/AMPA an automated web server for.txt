ABSTRACT

Summary: AM PA is a web application for assessing the antimicrobial
domains of proteins, with a focus on the design on new antimicrobial
drugs. The application provides fast discovery of antimicrobial
patterns in proteins that can be used to develop new peptide-
based drugs against pathogens. Results are shown in a user-friendly
graphical interface and can be downloaded as raw data for later
examination.

Availability: AMPA is freely available on the web at
http://tcoffee.crg.cat/apps/ampa. The source code is also available
in the web.

1 INTRODUCTION

The widespread use of antibiotics has promoted the emergence of
antibiotic—resistant strains that often pose serious health problems.
Many efforts have been directed toward ﬁnding alternative
antibiotics unaffected by resistance mechanisms. Antimicrobial
peptides (AMPs) are regarded as one of the most promising
alternatives in this regard (Yeung et al., 2011).

AMPs usually act through membrane permeation, receptor—
independent mechanisms that greatly reduce the risk of inducing
resistance in microorganisms (Hilpert, 2011). Moreover, many
AMPs are active against a wide diversity of pathogens, including
Gram—negative and Gram—positive bacteria, fungi and parasites.
All these features make AMPs attractive candidates for ﬁghting
microbial infection. A growing interest, therefore, exists for
identifying natural AMP leads that can be developed into novel
antibiotics.

An increasing number of proteins and peptides with antimicrobial
effects have been identiﬁed in many organisms, many of such
proteins belonging to the innate defense system but others are
unrelated to immune response. The design of new AMPs based on
these proteins is hampered by the fact that the mechanisms of their

antimicrobial action are not yet fully elucidated. It is commonly
accepted that an adequate combination of hydrophobic and cationic
amino acid residues underlies the action of antimicrobial regions,
generally by conferring them an amphipathic secondary structure
that favors interaction with microbial membranes, that induces
cell damage which kills the microorganism (Wimley, 2010). The
antimicrobial activity is usually conﬁned to discrete stretches of the
protein rather than spread over the entire sequence. Such stretches
are often located at the N— or C—termini of proteins found in
the secretion granules of immune cells such as neutrophils and
eosinophils, from which they are released by limited proteolysis
upon infection (Ramanathan et al., 2002).

Due to the growing interest in AMPs, algorithms for predicting
antimicrobial activity have been developed (Lata et al., 2007;
Torrent et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2011) and used to propose
short AMP sequences (Fjell et al., 2009) that after high—throughput
synthesis and screening can be validated as novel AMP leads (Hadley
and Hancock, 2010). In contrast, the in silico identiﬁcation of
protein sequence stretches with potential AMP activity has not to our
knowledge been successfully addressed. Here, we present a method
for efﬁcient screening of protein sequences in search of antimicrobial
stretches that can provide novel AMP leads.

2 METHODS
2.1 Description

The AMPA algorithm is based on an antimicrobial propensity scale derived
from high—throughput screening results (Torrent et al., 2009b) from the
AMP bactenecin 2A for which antimicrobial IC50 values for all amino acid
replacements at each position have been determined (Hilpert et al., 2005).
From these data, an antimicrobial index (AI) can be calculated providing a
fair assessment of the tendency for such amino acids to be present in an AMP
sequence. As low IC50 values correspond to high activity, amino acids with
a low index are the most favored to be part of an AMP. By using a sliding—
window method the algorithm draws an antimicrobial proﬁle. The regions
(>12 amino acids length) located below the threshold are considered putative
antimicrobial domains.

The AMPA server has been integrated within the new T—Coffee web server
framework (Notredame et al., 2000), developed in Perl and Java. To submit
a job, the query sequences must be provided in FASTA format. Also the
window size and the threshold values must be speciﬁed (default values
are provided). Once launched, the job is processed and the output results
page is displayed and sent to the email address provided. On the top of the

results page, an interactive antimicrobial proﬁle of the query sequences is
provided. Antimicrobial proﬁles can be switched on and off for a better visual
inspection of the results. The information on the antimicrobial stretches of
the query protein (i.e. the number and location of the antimicrobial regions
and the mean AI of the protein together with a statistical evaluation of the
results) is displayed on the top of the webpage and can be downloaded for
later examination.

AMPA is intended for multiple purposes. While its main application is
the fast automatic detection of antimicrobial regions in proteins that can
serve as new templates for AMP design, as shown in Figure 1, AMPA—
derived AI values can be used to automatically classify proteins or domains
thereof as either antimicrobial or non—antimicrobial, and to compare different
protein sequences in this regard. When used in conjunction with the T—coffee
alignment tool, antimicrobial regions can be checked to identify potentially
conserved antimicrobial domains.

The AMPA screening system has been optimized to work with the
default window size and threshold values provided. Both search parameters,
however, can be tuned for speciﬁc purposes such as locating antimicrobial
regions in very large—or very short—proteins, or to analyze sequences using
more stringent than usual criteria. For instance, long antimicrobial domains
in large (e. g. > 1000 residue) proteins may be better deﬁned by increasing the
window size from 7 to 9—19 amino acids. Larger window sizes, however, are
not advised, as the averaging process may miss small antimicrobial motifs.
On the other hand, for very short sequences (<25 residues), small window
sizes may provide slightly better deﬁned antimicrobial proﬁles. Threshold
values, on their part, while not altering the antimicrobial proﬁle, can be
adjusted to highlight the hi ghest—scoring stretches in proteins with more than
one antimicrobial region.

2.2 Validation

The algorithm has been extensively validated in silica and found to correctly
identify 80—90% of the antimicrobial proteins and properly predict their
antimicrobial domain (Torrent et al., 2009b). Besides, the system has
successfully allowed predicting the N—terminal domain of eosinophil cationic
protein as the region embodying the antimicrobial activity of the entire
protein (Torrent et al., 2009a). To experimentally test the automatic detection
of antimicrobial domains by the AMPA algorithm, we have analyzed
six proteins reported as antimicrobial but without any identiﬁed domain.
Peptides derived from the regions identiﬁed by AMPA were found to retain

antimicrobial activity in a micromolar range (Supplementary Material).
Hence, we propose the use of AMPA as a valuable resource to accurately
detect antimicrobial domains in proteins.

ABSTRACT

Summary: The atomic structures of protein—protein interactions are
central to understanding their role in biological systems, and a wide
variety of biophysical functions and potentials have been developed
for their characterization and the construction of predictive models.
These tools are scattered across a multitude of stand-alone programs,
and are often available only as model parameters requiring reimple-
mentation. This acts as a significant barrier to their widespread adop-
tion. CCharPPl integrates many of these tools into a single web server.
It calculates up to 108 parameters, including models of electrostatics,
desolvation and hydrogen bonding, as well as interface packing and
complementarity scores, empirical potentials at various resolutions,
docking potentials and composite scoring functions.

Availability and implementation: The server does not require regis-
tration by the user and is freely available for non-commercial academic
use at http://life.bsc.es/pid/ccharppi

1 INTRODUCTION

Protein—protein interactions are involved in most cell processes,
and their structural and functional annotation is essential to
understand biological and pathological phenomena and to de-
velop new therapeutic approaches. The increasing volume of ex-
perimental data on protein—protein interactions at the molecular
level offers many opportunities for functional characterization
and the construction of predictive models based on properties
arising from structure, such as interface geometry, hydrogen
bonding, electrostatics and desolvation energy, which act as an
intermediate layer between structure and function (Chothia and
Janin, 1975; Jones and Thornton, 1997). Indeed, the selection
and combination of structure-based potentials within a learning
framework have been used for many tasks, often beyond their
original development purpose, such as the prediction of binding
afﬁnity (Moal et al., 2011), kinetics (Moal and Bates, 2012),
mutational effects (Agius et al., 2013; Moretti et al., 2013;
Pallara et al., 2013), interface design (Fleishman et al., 2011;
Yu et al., 2012), protein—protein docking (Moal et al., 2013b)
and the detection of hotspots (Lise et al., 2009; Zhu and Mitchell

2011), with many further possibilities remaining to be explored
(Moal et al., 2013a). Although many tools have been developed
to calculate structural properties, some of which are available
online (Tuncbag et al., 2009), their availability and ease of
use are an impediment, often requiring the installation of
stand-alone programs with different library dependencies, reim-
plementation of models for which only parameters are given and
reformatting of pdb ﬁles. Thus, there is a need to consolidate
these methods into a single implementation. Here, we present
CCharPPI, a web server, which gathers together a large
number of these functions, including those on which many of
our previous models were based, into a single easy-to-use
interface.

2 THE WEB SERVER

CCharPPI incorporates many parameter calculation tools into a
single web application, which is freely available for academic
non-commercial use. Up to 108 intermolecular parameters are
calculated for the input protein—protein interface/s, including 43
potential functions, which have been reimplemented (Chuang
et al., 2008; Feng et al., 2010; Lu et al., 2003; Liu and Vakser,
2011; Liu et al., 2004; Mintseris et al., 2007; Moal and
Fernandez-Recio, 2013; Pokarowski et al., 2005; Rajgaria
et al., 2008, 2006; Shen and Sali, 2006; Tobi, 2010; Tobi and
Bahar, 2006), as well as terms calculated with 11 stand-alone
programs (Feliu et al., 2011; Li and Liang, unpublished; Lu
et al., 2008; Mitra and Pal, 2010; Pierce and Weng, 2007, 2008;
Ravikant and Elber, 2010; Viswanath et al., 2013; Yang and
Zhou, 2008a,b; Zhang and Zhang, 2010; Zhou and Skolnick,
2011) and 4 packages: FireDock (Andrusier et al., 2007),
PyRosetta (Chaudhury et al., 2010), SIPPER (Pons et al.,
2011) and PyDock (Cheng et al., 2007). A detailed list of indi-
vidual parameters is given online (http: //1ife.bsc.es/pid/ccharppi/
info/faq_and_help#descriptors). Users can easily calculate de-
scriptors of interest using a clear workﬂow. There are three dif-
ferent input sources: a protein databank ID code for automatic
retrieval, an uploaded complex in PDB format, or a compressed
batch job ﬁle for analysing multiple interfaces, for instance, those
derived from docking predictions. The web front end acts as user
input source and makes results available for display and down-
load. The back end polls for queued projects and schedules jobs
for parallel execution. The distribution of descriptor values can
be Visualized by clicking the descriptor name on the results page.
For comparison, values are shown against a background distri-
bution pre-calculated using a set of diverse non-redundant

complexes of known afﬁnity (Kastritis et al., 2011), with the
relationship between afﬁnity values and the pre-calculated de-
scriptor values indicated by a scatter plot. Two pre—calculated
datasets are available from the website. The ﬁrst consists of the
structural afﬁnity benchmark (Kastritis et al., 2011), a set of 144
complexes with experimentally determined afﬁnity. The second
consists of 157 wild-type complexes and 2731 unique mutations
in the SKEMPI database (Moal and F ernandez-Recio, 2012), as
modelled using FoldX (Guerois et al., 2002). Computational
time for calculating all descriptors is typically <5 min and took
<15 min for the largest complex tested (the FAB/inﬂuenza haem-
agglutinin, PDBid 2VIS). Calculations are quicker when exe-
cuted in parallel using the batch mode, with the 157 wild-type
and 2731 unique mutants in the SKEMPI set taking 18h to
complete, and the 144 complexes in the structural afﬁnity bench-
mark completing in 1h 20 min. The server has been tested on
major browser for MacOS, Ubuntu 12.4, Windows 7 and
Windows 8.

3 CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, we have brought together many different methods
for characterizing protein—protein interactions, and provide pre-
calculated descriptors for two datasets, one of which is also used
to provide a Visual comparison of uploaded complexes with com-
plexes of known afﬁnity. The ease with which these descriptors
can be calculated can accelerate the prototyping of reproducible
predictive models, allow users to mix and match different func-
tional forms to model physical phenomena, ﬁnd new terms for
their scoring functions and characterize their complexes of inter-
est. F or researchers interested in local execution or incorporation
into their own software, all scripts and code are available on
request. We intent to expand the pre—calculated datasets, as
well as the features as new methods become available.

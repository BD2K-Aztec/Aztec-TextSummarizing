Abstract

Motivation: Biomedical researchers often search through massive catalogues of literature to look for
potential relationships between genes and diseases. Given the rapid growth of biomedical literature,
automatic relation extraction, a crucial technology in biomedical literature mining, has shown great po-
tential to support research of gene-related diseases. Existing work in this field has produced datasets
that are limited both in scale and accuracy.

Results: In this study, we propose a reliable and efficient framework that takes large biomedical litera-
ture repositories as inputs, identifies credible relationships between diseases and genes, and presents
possible genes related to a given disease and possible diseases related to a given gene. The frame-
work incorporates name entity recognition (NER), which identifies occurrences of genes and diseases
in texts, association detection whereby we extract and evaluate features from gene-disease pairs, and
ranking algorithms that estimate how closely the pairs are related. The F1-score of the NER phase is
0.87, which is higher than existing studies. The association detection phase takes drastically less time
than previous work while maintaining a comparable F1-score of 0.86. The end-to-end result achieves a
0.259 F1-score for the top 50 genes associated with a disease, which performs better than previous
work. In addition, we released a web service for public use of the dataset.

1 Introduction

Recent scientiﬁc discoveries have revealed the molecular, cellular and
genetic components of diseases. Researchers have gained many new
insights into cellular signaling pathways, genetic alterations and their
consequences. Combined with diagnostic breakthroughs, there have been
increasing efforts and successes in identifying patient segments deﬁned
by biomarkers that are more susceptible to certain diseases or will max-
imally beneﬁt from certain treatments. Traditionally, oncology was the
disease area where the majority of such research was focused. However,
in the last decades, there have been considerable advancements in other
disease areas, such as respiratory diseases, infectious diseases and in-
ﬂammatory diseases. All of these new ﬁndings are contained in the vast
amount of biomedical literature. The effective extraction of gene-disease
associations from biomedical literature will potentially enable the dis-
covery and development of new therapeutic targets and patient segment

biomarkers. However, it has remained a daunting task because of the
massive volume and the textual complexity of biomedical literature.
Given the strong demand for gene-disease relation extraction ﬁom
the biomedical literature, over the years ample studies have attempted to
tackle it or part of it. The task of gene-disease relation extraction can be
broken down into three phases. The ﬁrst is gene and disease recognition
in free text, which can be categorized as a Named Entity Recognition
(NER) problem. Machine leaming-based methods are one of the ap-
proaches used to identify biomedical entities in free text. B Settles (
Settles, 2004) proposed a conditional random ﬁeld model ABNER to
recognize biomedical named entities based on orthographic and semantic
features. Z Ju et a1 (Ju et al., 2011) used SVM to recognize biomedical
named entities such as proteins and genes in biomedical literature. There
are rule-based and pattem-based methods as well. Hanisch D et a1
(Hanisch et al., 2005) developed a rule-based method to recognize genes
and proteins in biomedical text. Singer and Collins (Singer and Collins,
1999) discussed the pattem-based method for name entity recognition in

their work. In this phase, we used search engines to enrich our dis-
ease/gene libraries. Previous efforts have been made to accomplish a
similar task, including using the World Wide Web to enrich ontologies
(Agirre et al., 2000), using search engine query data to detect epidemics
(Ginsberg et al., 2009) and using Google data as a complement to co-
occurrence frequency in the literature to identify disease-related genes
(Kim et al., 2015).

The second phase is to identify the relationships between genes and
diseases. A relationship between a gene-disease pair can include but is
not limited to therapeutic targets, prognostic factors etc. For example, in
the sentence “Our prospective ﬁndings suggest that individuals carrying
the HFE C282Y mutation may be at increased risk of CHD,” a relation-
ship between the gene “HFE” and the disease “CHD” is made clear.
Kernel methods are widely used in relation extraction (Bunescu and
Mooney, 2005; Zelenko et al., 2003). Recently, several systems have
been proposed to identify drug-gene relationships Om and Wang, 2012),
drug-drug interactions (Percha et al., 2012; Segura-Bedmar et al., 2011),
and gene-disease relationships (Bravo et al., 2015; Pletscher-Frankild et
al., 2015; Ozgur et al., 2008). Kim S et a1 (Kim et al., 2010) has suc-
cessfully implemented dependency kernels to extract protein-protein
interaction information. The Shallow Linguistic Kernel is also used to
extract drug-drug interaction information (Segura-Bedmar et al., 2011).

The third phase is to rank the gene-disease relations obtained from
the previous phase in an intelligent manner. A frequency-based ranking
system is commonly adopted in earlier works. BeFree (Bravo et al.,
2015) ranks the relationships according to the frequency of occurrence.
Clematide et a1 (Clematide et al., 2012) uses a logistic regression-based
method to optimize ranking of relations from curated abstracts.

There has been some work dedicated to the gene-disease relation ex-
traction problem, which is the end-to-end problem that we try to solve in
this paper. CoPub (Frijters et al., 2008) provides a text mining tool that
detects co-occuring biomedical concepts in abstracts from the MedLine
literature database. BeFree (Bravo et al., 2015) can be used in a text
mining workﬂow aimed at extracting information on biological associa-
tions from scientiﬁc publications. But all current work is limited both in
coverage and ranking precision.

Herein, we present a framework for extracting gene-disease relation-
ships from biomedical literature that addresses all three phases. It takes
large biomedical literature repositories and the name of a gene or a dis-
ease of interest as inputs and produces a meaningful ranked list of dis-
eases or genes that are related to the input entity with supporting evi-
dence. In the NER phase, we implemented an algorithm that combines
dictionary-based fuzzy matching and conditional random ﬁelds (CRF) to
recognize genes and diseases in free text. Next, we trained a SVM model
combining lexical features and syntactic features to identify the relation-
ships between genes and diseases. Finally, we proposed a ranking algo-
rithm to rank the disease-related genes based on co-occurrence frequen-
cy, paper citations, and author information.

2 Materials and Methods

In this section, the data sources used in this work and the detailed algo-
rithms and methods designed for this framework will be introduced.

2.1 Data Sources

The data used in this work mainly include the gene/disease term librar-
ies, the biomedical literature database, the annotated data and the ground
truth.

2.1.1 Gene Library

The gene library used in this study is a combination of three publicly
available gene/protein databases, namely the NCBI-gene database
(Brown et al., 2015), the HGNC gene dataset (Gray et al., 2015) and the
UniProt knowledge base (Uniprot Consortium, 2015), with cross-
references. NCBI-gene database contains almost all of the publicly avail-
able nucleotide sequences and their protein translations. By August,
2014, HGNC provided the names and symbols of 39,135 genes. UniProt
is a comprehensive resource of protein sequence and functional infor-
mation. Since genes are sometimes named after their protein names,
UniProt is also used as a data source for gene recognition.

The combined gene library has 60,197 genes. Each gene and its
synonyms were cross-referenced among all three data sources mentioned
above.

2.1.2 Disease Term Library

Disease Ontology (Mitraka and Schriml, 2015), MedDRA(The Medical
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities) (Brown et al., 1999), UMLS (The
Uniﬁed Medical Language System) (Bodenreider, O., 2004) and IDDB
(Infectious Disease Database) were cross-referenced to yield the disease
database used in this study. The disease term library is hierarchical. If
disease A belongs to a parent class B, an attribute “is a” with the value
being B will be attached to the disease A. In total, the disease library
includes 22,831 diseases. For each disease, the library includes its unique
identiﬁer, disease name, disease synonyms, ID in each source disease
database and its parent classes.

2.1.3 Biomedical Literature Database

The biomedical literature database used in this study is Medline
(https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/mms/medlineelements.html), the US.
National Library of Medicine (NLM) journal citation database. It in-
cludes citations ﬁom more than 5,600 scholarly journals, over 25 million
references to biomedical and life science journal articles ﬁom as early as
1946. The downloadable database contains 779 ﬁles in the XML format
in chronological order. Every piece of data contains the PMID, the pub-
lication date, the author information, the citations etc. PubMed

(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25499/#chapter4.EFetch)
provides retrieval APIs to Medline.

2.1.4 Annotated Data

In order to train and evaluate the methods and tools used in this work, we
gathered annotated texts containing a total of 2340 positive disease-gene
relationship labels and 1437 negative relationship labels. 2113 of the
positive labels and 1010 of the negative labels are from Genetic Associa-
tion Databases (GAD) (Becker et al., 2004), a database of genetic asso-
ciation data ﬁom complex diseases and disorders. Since GAD didn’t
label all gene/disease entities contained within a sentence, which will
bias our NER training, many of the data ﬁom GAD are re-annotated
manually by domain experts for gene entities, disease entities, positions
of genes and positions of diseases at the sentence level. The remaining
training data are sentences randomly selected ﬁom the biomedical ab-
stracts in Medline. Gene entities, disease entities, positions of genes,
positions of diseases and the relationships between genes and diseases
are manually labeled in each sentence.

2.1.5 Ground Truth

Human annotated gene-disease associations for 10 randomly selected
diseases obtained from DisGeNET (http://www.disgenet.org/) serve as

112 [310'SIBIIJHO[plOJXO'SODBIILIOJIIIOIQ/[I(11111 moxj papeolumoq

9IOZ ‘09 lsnﬁnV no :2

our ground truth data set. The diseases include Retinitis Pigmentosa,
Adrenal Gland Chromaffmoma, Bipolar I Disorder, Hyperlipidemia,
Papilloma, Thrombocytopenia, Glioblastoma, Hernia Diaphragmatic,
Brain Ischemia, and Cerebrovascular Accident. The ground truth is used
to evaluate the end-to-end results of a system.

2.2 Extraction Workﬂow

To extract gene-disease associations from biomedical literature, we aim
to extract ﬁom Medline triples of the format (disease; gene; score). “Dis-
ease” and “gene” denote the unique identiﬁers of diseases and genes
respectively in our disease library and gene library. “Score” refers to the
plausibility of gene-disease associations. When the user queries the
relevant genes of a particular disease, the framework will return the
results based on “score”.

Speciﬁcally, to accomplish the goal, we ﬁrst pre-process the data
ﬁom Medline and obtain three kinds of information: 1) Title and abstract
of articles, 2) author information, and 3) article reference information.
Then, the gene/disease recognition module processes the titles and ab-
stracts using both a Stanford NER tool (Finkel et al., 2005) trained on
2000 annotated sentences (1000 ﬁom GAD and 1000 ﬁom our manually
labeled data library) and a dictionary-based longest match strategy using
the gene and disease libraries. Recognition results of the two methods are
combined. In case of discrepancies, heuristic rules are applied to resolve
them. Next, in the association detection phase, all recognized gene-
disease pairs that co-occur within the same sentence are considered as
candidate evidence. A binary SVM classiﬁer, which extracts two types
of features, namely local lexical features and global syntactic features, is
used to determine the plausibility of the candidate pairs. Finally, positive
pairs are ranked by three methods. The basic method is counting the co-
occurrence frequency. The second method is to weigh each co-
occurrence by the PageRank of the paper from which the evidence was
extracted, in a paper citation network constructed from PubMed. The last
and most advanced method considers the duplicated evidence published
by the same author, and thus suppresses the contribution of such evi-
dence. Details of each part of the workﬂow will be presented in the
sections below.

2.3 Gene/Disease Recognition

The gene/disease recognition task is an NER task where the entities
being recognized are genes and diseases. We brought up a hybrid recog-
nition method in this study. A CRF-based NER tool, namely the Stanford
NER tool (Finkel et al., 2005), is combined with a dictionary-based
longest match strategy.

The Stanford NER tool provides a general implementation of (arbi-
trary order) linear chain CRF sequence models. It was trained on 2,000
annotated sentences ﬁom Medline before being used to recognize genes
and diseases names in the titles and abstracts of articles from Medline.
Recognized genes and diseases are then mapped to the unique identiﬁers
in the gene and disease libraries. The Stanford NER is further enhanced
in the following fashion. If a gene or a disease recognized by the Stan-
ford NER tool can’t be found in the libraries, a web crawler will auto-
matically query Bing (https://www.bing.com/) to search for information

that can relate the gene/disease name to one of the unique identiﬁers. A
gene/disease is added to the results only when it can be related to a
unique identiﬁer. If a gene/disease that can be related to a unique identi-
ﬁer is currently not in its synonym set, it will be added as a synonym.

Next, a dictionary-based longest match algorithm is implemented
using the gene and disease libraries as dictionaries. The longest match
strategy uses a sliding window. A ﬁxed-length window slides within the
sentence and the words within the window are fuzzy matched to the
items included in the gene and disease libraries. The “fuzzy match”
strategy picks up both terms that are exact matches and terms with small
discrepancies in some punctuation or singular/plural form. (For example,
“lung type-i cell membrane-associated glycoprotein” is considered a
match to “lung type i cell membrane-associated glycoprotein”, and “be-
nign gastric tumours” is considered a match to “benign gastric tumour”)
If the words covered by the window are matched to a gene or a disease,
they will be marked to make sure that other matched words will not
overlap with them. When the window reaches the end of the sentence,
the window length is reduced by one, and the window resumes sliding
from the start of the sentence, until the length is zero.

The results of the two methods are combined and a number of heu-
ristic rules are applied to resolve possible discrepancies: 1) If a term’s
length is less than four characters, it is likely to be either an acronym or
an incorrect recognition. It will be treated as an acronym if its longer
synonym (complete form) occurs in the former context. 2) If a term with
less than four characters does not have a longer synonym occurring in
the text before it, but it is recognized by the enhanced Stanford NER,
then it will be added to the ﬁnal results. 3) If a term is recognized by
both the dictionary-based method and the enhanced Stanford NER, the
result of the enhanced Stanford NER is used. The rationale is that the
enhanced Stanford NER takes advantage of web search engines, which
encompasses more knowledge and therefore is potentially more accurate
in recognizing named entities.

Genes and diseases may sometimes share the same synonyms. Thus,
a term may be mapped to several unique identiﬁers. However, if a sync-
nym of the term occurs in the previous context and the synonym can be
mapped to a speciﬁc unique identiﬁer, the term will be considered as
belonging to the same unique identiﬁer. Otherwise, the term is mapped
to each of the unique identiﬁers once. Considering the hierarchies among
genes and diseases, a term will be mapped not only to its unique identiﬁ-
er, but also its parent class’s unique identiﬁer.

Gene-disease pairs recognized in this phase are considered candidate
evidences for association between the gene and the disease.

2.4 Association Detection

In this step, a binary SVM classiﬁer is implemented to determine the
plausibility of association between a gene and a disease based on the
gene-disease pairs extracted from the previous step. Given a sentence
S=w1,...,g,...,wi,...,d,...,wn, the classiﬁer decides whether there is a
gene-disease relation between entities g and d.

The classiﬁer utilizes two types of features, namely local lexical
and global syntactic features. The local lexical feature contains words
surrounding the gene or the disease terms in the original text. The global
syntactic feature, which contains unigrams, bigrams and trigrams drawn
from 1) the shortest path between the gene and the disease terms in the
dependency tree, and 2) the path between the least common ancestor
(LCA) of the two terms and the root of the dependency tree. The features
are detailed in Table 1. Feature 1 is the local lexical feature and contains
the context information of the gene and the disease terms, while features

9IOZ ‘09 lsnﬁnV no 2:

 

2 and 3 are the global syntactic features and contain rich syntactic infor-
mation ﬁom the dependency tree. The lemmas and the dependency tree
are generated by the Stanford CoreNLP tool (Manning et al., 2014).

Table 1. Features Extracted for Association Detection

 

Feature Type Description

 

1 Local Lemmas of the two words in front of the gene
lexical term and the two words behind the gene term,
feature and lemmas of the two words in ﬁont of the

disease term and the two words behind the dis-
ease term.

2 Global Unigram, bigram, and trigram of lemmas on the
syntactic shortest path between the gene and the disease

feature terms in the dependency tree.

3 Global Unigram, bigram, and trigram of lemmas on the
syntactic path between the LCA of the gene and the dis-
feature ease terms and the root of the dependency tree.

 

The effect of words with the part-of-speech (POS) tag “neg” or
“advmod” that modify verbs is taken into account in feature extraction.
(For example, the word “not” in “does not relate with” or the word “rare-
ly” in “rarely indicates the association” strongly implies the negative
association of a candidate pair.). Words with POS tag “neg” or
“advmod” that modify verbs are included in the paths used by global
features. Besides, the gene and the disease terms in the paths are replaced
with the general names “GENE” and “DISEASE”, because speciﬁc
gene/disease names do not contain information concerning association

detection.
Take the following sentence as an example:

 

All three complementary approaches employed (family-based, case-
control and quantitative trait design) suggest a role for the MAO A
promoter-region polymorphism in conferring risk for ADHD in our

patient population.

 

 

 

In this sentence, “MAO A” is a gene term and “ADHD” is a disease
name. A part of the dependency tree of the sentence is drawn in Figure 2.
“for”, “the”, “promoter-region”, “polymorphism”, “risk”, “for”, “in” and
“our” are extracted for feature 1. From the shortest dependency path
between the gene and the disease terms, n-grams like “risk for
DISEASE” and “in risk for” are extracted for feature 2. The LCA of the
gene and the disease terms in the dependency tree is “suggest”. N-grams
including “suggest role for” and “role for polymorphism” are extracted

for feature 3.

proaches employed (family-based, case-control and quantitative trait design) sug-

ADI-ID in our patient population.”

After the features are extracted, libsvm (Chang and Lin, 2011) is
used to train the binary SVM classiﬁer. The kernel function of SVM
grades the local lexical feature (i.e. feature 1) and the global syntactic
features (i.e. feature 2 and 3) and combines the scores linearly. The fea-
tures are treated as a bag of words. Every possible word or n-gram is
considered a dimension in a vector. If the feature contains a particular
word/n-gram, the value of the corresponding dimension is set to one;
otherwise, it is zero. The similarity between two instances of features is
quantiﬁed by the cosine value between vectors.

A set of positive gene-disease pairs along with the unique identiﬁers
of journal articles in which they co-occur are generated and passed on to
the next step.

2.5 Ranking

For a given disease, hundreds of positive gene-disease pairs are generat-
ed from the previous steps, and vice versa. The ranking of genes for a
particular disease and the ranking of diseases for a particular gene is
done using the following three ranking methods.

The basic ranking method uses the co-occurrence frequency. Dif-
ferent pairs with the same disease are ranked by the number of distinct
journal article in which they co-occur.

The second method is to grant a weight to each co-occurrence ac-
cording to the PageRank of the journal article, in a paper citation net-
work constructed from PubMed. PageRank was proposed by Larry Page
and Sergey Brin (Page et al., 1999). It is used by Google for website
ranking. PageRank operates on the idea that the more important a web-
site is, the more websites will link to it. So it utilizes the number and
importance of websites that link to a given website to assess the im-
portance of this website, or the PageRank of the website. In this study,
we apply the principle of PageRank to the task of publication citation. If
a journal article is cited by more articles and the articles that cite it are
more inﬂuential, the article itself is more inﬂuential and its PageRank is
higher.

According to the reference information obtained from Medline, we
ﬁrst built a paper citation network, as shown in Figure 3. Nodes in the
network denote the journal articles, and the edge from node A to node B
means that Paper A cites Paper B. Based on the paper citation network,
the PageRank of each node (i.e. each article) is calculated.

Fig. 3. Simpliﬁed Paper Citation Network

When we get the PageRank of the articles, the following formula is
used to calculate the score of the gene-disease pair, where g denotes the
gene, (1 denotes the disease, C(gm denotes the set of all the articles that
contain the (g,d) pair and pr(a) denotes the PageRank of paper a.

Score(g,d)= Z pr(a) (1)

aeC(g’d)

The third ranking method takes the authors into consideration. Bio-
medical researchers, who focus on speciﬁc diseases or genes, may write

112 [310'SIBIIJHO[p.IOJXO'SODBIIHOJIIIOIQ/ﬂ(11111 111011 papeolumoq

9IOZ ‘09 lsnﬁnV no 2:

about the same gene-disease pair in multiple publications. For instance,
Mark J Samak mentioned the association between Kidney Failure and
Cystatin C in up to twelve distinct papers. They should not be considered
as twelve independent evidences. In the third method, if a gene-disease
pair is repeatedly mentioned by the same author, the contribution of the
duplicated evidence will be suppressed.

We assume that the sum of weights an author can grant to different
evidences of the same pair is one. If an author mentions the same pair in
multiple publications, the weights of the evidence from each of the pub-
lications is equal and sums to one. The weight of each paper where the
evidence of (g,d) is extracted is

 

 

W, (g, d ) = —
Ill
where 1 denotes the author list of paper a, |cx| denotes the number of
papers author x wrote about (g,d). Then we can modify the score func-
tion of gene-disease pairs proposed in the formula (1).

Score(g,d) = Z wa(g,d)><pr(a) (3)

aede)

(2)

The fourth method uses a PageRank function that is adjusted by a
time factor. This is based on the observation that recently published
papers may have “less exposure” for citation than those published before
them. The time-weighted PageRank is deﬁned as below.

1" V
pr(u)=d Z p—()+(1—d)><Tu (4)
veB(u) NV

where Tu denotes a smoothed time factor related to each paper’s year of
publication. Disease gene pairs mentioned by the same author is also be
suppressed in this method.

2.6 Signiﬁcance Testing

The micro sign test (Yang et al., 1999) is used to examine whether the
improvements in Fl-scores are statistically signiﬁcant. A one-sided p-
value that is less than 0.05 is considered as statistically signiﬁcant.

3 Results

The number of associations extracted by our method is shown in Table 2.
The number of associations extracted by our method is signiﬁcantly
larger than Befree (Bravo et al., 2015). At the meantime, the precision of
our extraction is better than Befree, which is detailed in Section 3.3.

3.1 Gene/Disease Recognition

First, we evaluated the Gene/Disease recognition module on 800 anno-
tated sentences. In these 800 sentences, 592 diseases and 525 genes were
labeled. The recognition results are shown in Table 3. We found that
Stanford NER tool has high precision but poor recall. By combining it
with dictionaries, our hybrid recognition method has about a 0.125 en-
hancement on the F-score than the dictionary-only method, which is

similar to the method used by BeFree (Bravo et al., 2015) and CoPub
(Frijters et al., 2008). The F-score improved about 0.014 (p < 0.01) after
we enriched our gene and disease dictionary using Bing. Our method
also performs much better than ABNER (Settles, 2004) on these sen-
tences.

3.2 Relation Extraction
We evaluated the performance of the SVM classiﬁer through 10-fold
cross validation on a training set with 2,080 positive samples and 1,277
negative samples. The result is shown in Table 4. We found that the F-
score can only reach 0.755 if we use the local lexical features alone.
However, if we use both the local features and the global features, the
SVM classiﬁer achieves the best performance.

Feature Precision Recall F-score
Local Lexical Feathers 0.761 0.748 0.755
Global Syntactic Features 0.827 0.853 0.839

Due to the large volume of biomedical literature, computation time
becomes an important issue in the relationship extraction task. A com-
parison between the state-of-art system BeFree and our work is shown in
Table 5. Although the F-score of our work is slightly lower than that of
BeFree, the training speed of the classiﬁer and the testing speed on 420
randomly selected instances of our work are signiﬁcantly (more than
10x) faster.

The ground truth is obtained from DisGeNET. We selected 10 diseases
and computed the mean reciprocal rank (MRR)of ranks obtained by the
three methods mentioned above. The result is shown in Table 6. For
most diseases, the suppressed PageRank achieves the best performance.
Overall, compared with the frequency-based method, the MRR increased
10.6% if we weighted the paper with PageRank score. And, after sup-
pressing the contribution of the same author, the MRR increased by
8.4% .

result is shown in Table 7. If we select the top-50 genes, the Suppressed
PageRank method achieves the better result compared with other meth-
ods. While K increases, the performance of these four methods’ is simi-

genes are ranked on top. The numbers of true positives, false positives,
and false negatives for the Suppressed PageRank method are listed in the

We also compared our results with BeFree (Bravo et al., 2015) and
Copub (Frijters et al., 2008). The results are shown in Figure 4. In most
cases, Suppressed PageRank results are about 0.03 higher than CoPub
and BeFree. In addition, our system extracts many more genes associated
with a speciﬁc disease. (cerebrovascular accident: 1238 associated

4 Discussion

In the named entity recognition phase, the dictionary-only method,
which is similar to the method BeFree (Bravo et al., 2015) and CoPub
(Frijters et al., 2008) used, shows an F-score of 0.738. We achieved a
0.125 improvement on the F-score by combining the Stanford NER tool
with the dictionary-based method. The CRF model behind the Stanford
NER tool takes advantage of the distribution information of words and
thus compensates the dictionary-only method. Incorporating the Internet
search engine further improved the F-score by 0.014, for that information
from the Internet enriched our gene/disease libraries.

In the relation extraction phase, we achieved an F-score of 0.863
using both the local lexical features and global syntactic features. Using
the local lexical features or the global syntactic features alone gives a
lower F-score, which indicates that, both the local and the global features
are effective and necessary. While the F-score of our method is nearly as
good as that of BeFree (Bravo et al., 2015), our speed is more than 10
times faster. It is because we utilized fewer but more representative
features than BeFree so that we can achieve this advantage in speed
while maintaining the F-score.

In terms of the MRR results, the suppressed PageRank method
achieved the best overall performance. The PageRank-based method
increased the overall MRR by 10.6%. This is because our PageRank-
based method weighted the trustworthiness of each paper according to
the citation information. The suppressed PageRank method further im-
proved the overall MRR by 8.4%. This supports our assumption that
some authors wrote multiple papers about the same gene-disease associa-
tion and such behavior will falsely boost the ranking of the aforemen-
tioned association in the PageRank-based method. The same judgement

on the performance of the four ranking methods is given by the F-score
results. Adding a time factor in the PageRank function does not seem to
improve the MRR. This may suggest that cutting edge research get cited
frequently despite the short amount of time since publication.

Furthermore, our end-to-end results showed that our system ex-
tracted much more genes related to a given disease than BeFree (Bravo
et al., 2015) and CoPub (Frijters et al., 2008) did. This is due to the large
scale of our input and the good performance of our NER method and
relationship extraction method.

5 Conclusion

In this paper, we proposed a framework for the automatic extraction of
gene-disease relation from biomedical literature. For the gene and dis-
ease recognition, we built large gene and disease libraries by combining
and cross referencing existing biomedical knowledge bases. We enriched
our dictionary by identifying new synonyms using search engines. For
association detection, we designated effective features and built an efﬁ-
cient SVM classiﬁer. For the ranking, we considered the weight of pa-
pers and the other contributions by the same authors and proposed three
different algorithms for ranking. In addition, we launched a web service
for public access to our results. Overall, our system created a disease-
gene association dataset that is several times larger than any previously
reported dataset of similar nature, achieved a good balance between
accuracy and computation time, and outperformed existing state-of-the-
art systems on similar tasks. The system has been made available online
for free public access, which will potentially enable the discovery and
development of new therapeutics and breakthrough in diagnostics.

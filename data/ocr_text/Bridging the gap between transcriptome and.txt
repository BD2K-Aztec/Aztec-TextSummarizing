ABSTRACT

Motivation: Despite much dynamical cellular behaviour being
achieved by accurate regulation of protein concentrations, messenger
RNA abundances, measured by microarray technology, and more
recently by deep sequencing techniques, are widely used as proxies
for protein measurements. Although for some species and under some
conditions, there is good correlation between transcriptome and prote-
ome level measurements, such correlation is by no means universal
due to post-transcriptional and post-translational regulation, both of
which are highly prevalent in cells. Here, we seek to develop a data-
driven machine learning approach to bridging the gap between these
two levels of high-throughput omic measurements on Saccharomyces
cerevisiae and deploy the model in a novel way to uncover mRNA-
protein pairs that are candidates for post-translational regulation.
Results: The application of feature selection by sparsity inducing
regression (I1 norm regularization) leads to a stable set of features:
i.e. mRNA, ribosomal occupancy, ribosome density, tRNA adaptation
index and codon bias while achieving a feature reduction from 37 to 5.
A linear predictor used with these features is capable of predicting
protein concentrations fairly accurately (R2 = 0.86). Proteins whose
concentration cannot be predicted accurately, taken as outliers with
respect to the predictor, are shown to have annotation evidence
of post-translational modification, significantly more than random
subsets of similar size P<0.02. In a data mining sense, this work
also shows a wider point that outliers with respect to a leaming
method can carry meaningful information about a problem domain.

1 INTRODUCTION

The analysis of high-throughput experimental data has played a
dominant role in biological research over the last decade or so.
Advances in instrumentation, coupled with our ability to archive
and share data, have revolutionized the way one approaches
biological problems, more at a systems level than at the individ-
ual component level. Terabytes of data from thousands of
experiments at the transcriptome, proteome and metabolome
levels are now available along with metadata corresponding to
the primary scientiﬁc question. There is, however, a massive
skew in the amount of interest shown across the above omic
scales, gene expression measurements made with microarray
technology being highly dominant with respect to the other

two. The rapid take-up of this technology by the experimental
community, the monotonic reduction in cost of arrays and the
early establishment of data archiving initiatives (Brazma et al.,
2001) have led to a large community-wide focus on the transcrip-
tome. Functional inference about co-regulated genes or genes
along a signalling pathway (Brown et al., 2000), disease state
classiﬁcation focusing at the molecular level subtypes (Golub
et al., 1999), subspace projections (Zheng—Bradley et al., 2010)
and the reconstruction of regulatory networks (Liao et al., 2003;
Sanguinetti et al., 2006) have been a number of notable success
stories with transcriptome-level studies.

However, the transcriptome itself can, at best, give an approxi-
mate picture of cellular state and function. Useful biological
phenomena such as dynamic cellular function and differential
spatio—temporal behaviours arise from quantitatively and pre-
cisely regulating protein levels. Such behaviours arising from
protein-level regulations have been modelled extensively by
mathematical and computational models. Examples include con-
trolled progression through the cell cycle (Chen et al., 2004),
transcription delay-driven oscillations (Monk, 2003) and spatial
selectivity in morphogenesis (Houchmandzadeh et al., 2002; Liu
and Niranjan, 2011).

Several authors have evaluated the correlation between
mRNA measurements and the corresponding protein measure-
ments (Beyer et al., 2004; Futcher et al., 1999; Gygi et al., 1999;
Wu et al., 2008) and report varying levels of correlation. Tuller
et a]. (2007) have developed a machine learning-based predictor
of protein concentrations, which takes a different approach to
previous research. In addition to mRNA levels, they construct a
dataset with several properties of mRNA—protein pairs and train
a linear predictor to predict protein levels. They carry out a
greedy feature selection procedure to select a subset of relevant
features. By this process, Tuller et a]. (2007) achieved a correl-
ation of 0.76 between the true concentrations and the corres-
ponding linear predictions. Their greedy feature selection
approach selects three input features as relevant predictors:
(i) mRNA levels; (ii) tRNA adaptation index (tAI); and (iii) evo-
lutionary rate (ER), determined by rate of evolution of a gene by
comparison with orthologous in other organisms.

Data-driven models have been used extensively in the analysis
of genomic data. Clustering, classiﬁcation and time series ana-
lysis of microarray data have been carried out by several authors.
Probabilistic approaches such as coupled mixture model with
clustering (Rogers et al., 2008) and Bayesian model (Kannan
et al., 2007) on transcriptomic and proteomic expressions
investigate the relationship between these measurements. An
approach that has not attracted much usage in genomic data

Post-translational regulation

 

analysis is novelty detection, in which one builds a statistical
model of normal data and tests these against newly arriving
abnormal data. The basic premise in such an approach is
that when a data-driven model is applied to data, examples
(or subsets of data) on which the model fails will also be inform-
ative. We build on this notion and, by seeking to develop a
predictor of protein concentrations in the same spirit as in
previous work (Tuller et al., 2007), identify mRNA—protein
pairs that are novel with respect to the performance of such a
predictor.

We construct a data-driven linear predictor of protein concen-
trations, using as input mRNA concentrations and other proxy
variables that can potentially regulate protein levels. Once we
construct such a predictor, we look for systematic errors made
by the predictor; i.e. we hypothesize that those mRNA—protein
pairs for which construction of a data-driven predictor is difﬁcult
and also predicted protein abundance is lower than the measured
abundance, are likely candidates for post-translational regula-
tion. This follows from the fact that the input features used
in constructing a regressor have no information pertaining to
post-translational modiﬁcations (PTMs).

Post-translational regulation of proteins is important in many
biological processes. For example, Tebaldi et a]. (2012) demon-
strate signiﬁcant response variations at the translational level,
decoupled from the transcriptional level, of mammalian cells
under various stimuli. O’Neill et a]. (2011) show that animal
and plant cells have prominent post-translational contributions
to timekeeping with respect to biochemical oscillations. Further,
powerful computational models are also being applied to cor-
recting measurements of post-translationally modiﬁed proteins
(Chung et al., 2013).

PTMs are known to be triggers of intracellular proteolytic
degradation (Callis, 1995). In vivo stability of proteins can be
substantially inﬂuenced by speciﬁc amino acid substitutions.
PTMs such as phosphorylation and acetylation can act as
proxies for such mutations by attachments at speciﬁc local
sites, increasing the susceptibility of the protein to proteinase
action (Holzer and Heinrich, 1980; Hood et al., 1977).
Localized PTMs, such as methylation, can be equivalent to
site-speciﬁc amino acid substitutions, affecting the degradation
rate of proteins (Stadtman, 1990). Nalivaeva and Turner, (2001),
reviewing PTMs, suggest that glycosylation (glycoprotein)
and N-link acetylation inﬂuence protein stability. They also
claim modiﬁcations caused by isopeptide bond formations with
members of the ubiquitine family can be implicated in protein
turnover, post-translationally. Swaney et al.’s (2013) study
shows that phosphorylation machinery can be regulated by
ubiquitination.

Further, motif information on determinants of protein stabil-
ity and degradation under PTMs is often available. The presence
of PEST motif sequences located in ﬂexible regions accelerates
degradation under phosphorylation (Garcia-Alai et al., 2006;
Marchal et al., 1998). N-terminus segments act as degradation
signals in cellular proteins. Thus, N—actelylation with N—acetyl-
transferase segments is directly involved in protein degradation
process (Hwang et al., 2010; Solomon and Goldberg, 1998).
D and KEN Box motifs signal the anaphase promoting complex
machinery that leads to ubiquitination and subsequent protein
degradation (Burton and Solomon, 2001; Pﬂeger and Kirschner,

2000). The previously mentioned are observations we will exploit
to conﬁrm that proteins found by our novelty-detection frame-
work are likely candidates for post-translational regulation of
their concentrations (see Section 3).

This article makes two contributions to data-driven modelling
at the transcriptome—proteome interface. First, the linear regres-
sion with sparsity inducing regularization (LASSO) method can
identify features that are relevant to a prediction problem. This,
in the context of computational biology problems, is an alternate
approach to the often used greedy forward selection of features.
The accuracy of prediction of protein concentrations shows
improvement over previous efforts at this problem. Second,
model failures carry useful information, and this is demonstrated
by identifying genes whose predicted protein concentrations are
outliers (Li and Niranjan, 2006) with respect to predictions
obtained by a global regression. These are conﬁrmed by checking
functional annotations.

2 METHODS
2.1 Data preparation

Several datasets were combined together using the open reading frame
(ORF) and gene names to generate our ﬁnal dataset. mRNA abundance
data for Saccharomyces cerevisiae were downloaded from Greenbaum
et a]. (2003). We used PaxDb (Wang et al., 2012) to ﬁnd the relevant
protein abundance data, which was developed by integrating four data-
sets (de Godoy et al., 2008; Desiere et al., 2006; Ghaemmaghami et al.,
2003; Newman et al., 2006). Ribosome density was taken from Arava
et a]. (2003). Gene length, ribosomal occupancy, proteins per second and
relative translation rate data were obtained from Greenbaum et a].
(2003). mRNA half-life data were downloaded from Miller et a].
(2011). Twenty-eight sequence-derived properties, also used by Tuller
et a]. (2007), were obtained from Cherry et a]. (2012). tAI data were
taken from Man and Pilpel (2007) and ERs of proteins were downloaded
from Wall et a]. (2005). In all cases, experimental data used corresponded
to S.Cerevisiae cell cultures under exponential growth conditions.
Comparing with previous work (Tuller et al., 2007), gene length, riboso-
mal occupancy, proteins per second, ribosome density, relative transla-
tion rate and mRNA half-live are used as new features in our study.
When these different datasets are put together, and some data are ﬁltered
for missing values and low mRNA abundances (log expression of —1), we
obtained feature values and protein concentrations for 1895 proteins,
which was the dataset we worked with.

2.2 Sparse regression

Feature selection is a key step in regression problems. For technical rea-
sons, it is usually beneﬁcial to reduce the dimensionality of the space,
thereby avoiding the curse of dimensionality, which states that the amount
of data needed to reliably estimate probability densities grows exponen-
tially with dimensions. Further, by selecting a subset of features, we are
likely to improve our ability to explain useful aspects of the problem
domain. The search for a subset of features has combinatorial complexity
and greedy searches such as sequential forward selection and backward
deletion are commonly used (Lovell et al., 1998). For the protein concen-
tration prediction problem, Tuller et a]. (2007) used greedy forward
selection. This approach is particularly weak when there are correlated
features in the input data. We chose the alternate approach of sparsity
inducing regularizers embedded within the estimation of linear regression,
also known as LASSO (Tibshirani, 1994), to achieve feature selection.
This ll-regularized regression has attracted much interest in recent litera-
ture and has the appealing property of easy implementation via convex

Features Sets
Fig. 1. Feature selection by [1 regularization. (A) Variation in the average
number of selected features as a function of the regularization parameter
y, which have a stable region over three orders of magnitude of y (0.001
and 1). (B) Identiﬁcation of the best set of features (set 3) from the most
frequent six sets of features, which recognized from the stable y region

programming (Lu et al., 2011; Park and Casella, 2008; Wu et al., 2009).
The objective function minimized is as follows:

min{llXW — yII2 +1/llWll1} (1)

where X is the input matrix of covariates, y is the response vector and w is
the weight vector of unknowns. y controls the amount of regularization,
and with the [1 norm constraint determines the number of non-zero terms
in w, i.e. sparsity of the solution. We used the CVX package within a
MATLAB environment for optimization of the sparse regressor and,
after observing a histogram of the resulting weight values, centre clipped
the weights at 0.2 to arrive at the sparse solution.

To evaluate uncertainties in estimates, we constructed 1000 boot-
strapped samples of 500 genes each from the data and estimated the
sparse regressor over 20 values of y in the range 0—1000. Average
number of features selected (Fig. 1A) shows a stable region over several
orders of magnitude of y, from which a stable feature set is selected.

2.3 Development of protein abundance predictor

The protein abundance predictor is a linear predictor, based on the ﬁve
features selected by the LASSO method, obtained by minimizing the
following:

min{||XW — yllz} (2)

Data were partitioned into ﬁve groups at random. With each of the
groups retained as test data, linear models were estimated from the
remaining four groups pooled together. Thus, all predicted values of pro-
tein concentrations from which outliers were detected (see Section 3) were

on out-of—sample predictions. Predictors were developed with the ﬁve
features selected by LASSO, the set of three features from previous
work (Tuller et al., 2007) and with all 37 features as input.

Neural net: We also implemented neural network predictors to conﬁrm
any non-linear relationships between the variables and output protein
concentrations. For this the neural network toolbox in MATLAB
was used with stochastic gradient descent optimization of a multi—layer
perceptron neural network with 10 hidden units (Bishop, 1995).

2.4 PTM annotation check

We looked for outliers being post-translationally regulated by observing
the functional annotations at two levels. At the ﬁrst level, we used
UniProt database (Magrane and Consortium, 2011), which is cross-
referred by the PaXDb (Wang et al., 2012) where we obtained our initial
protein abundances. Several databases were used to carry out the ﬁner
level annotation check. EMBOSS explorer epestf ind database
(Rice 61 al., 2000) was used to detect PEST motifs of the proteins with
phosphorylation modiﬁcation. N—termini segments of acetylation were
obtained by NetAcet 1.0 database (Kiemer et al., 2005). D and
KEN box motifs, which accelerate ubiquitination, were detected using
GPS —ARM 1.0 toolkit (Liu et al., 2012).

3 RESULTS

Sparse linear regression selects a compact set of features relevant
for predicting protein concentrations accurately. Further, out-
liers with respect to the predictor we constructed, for whom
the predicted protein concentration (P) was greater than the
measurement (P), contained signiﬁcant over-representation for
proteins annotated with keywords of PTMs.

3.1 Feature selection

In implementing ll-regularized regression, the choice of regular-
ization term y is crucial. Figure 1(A) shows the variation in aver-
age number of retained features, as a function of y. We note that
the number of features selected does not reduce linearly. Instead,
there is a stable region, over three orders of magnitude of y
(0.001 and 1) in which ﬁve features are selected, suggesting
that this dataset consist of ﬁve dominant features. To conﬁrm
this, we constructed several datasets of similar size with uniform
random numbers and carried out such sparse regressions.
We found the monotonic reduction in the number of features
selected, also shown in Figure 1A (dashed line), on the random
regression problems had no stable region of a constant number
of features retained.

Across the 1000 bootstrap samples (see Section 2), six com-
binations of feature subsets (containing 6, 5, 5, 6, 4 and 4 fea-
tures) were frequently identiﬁed as relevant for the prediction.
The corresponding frequencies are shown in Figure 1B. We note
that feature set identiﬁed as set 3, consisting of ﬁve features,
appears signiﬁcantly more number of times than any of the
others. This set consisted of the following features: mRNA,
ribosomal occupancy, ribosome density, tAI and codon bias.
This differs slightly from Tuller et al.’s (2007) study that identi-
ﬁed mRNA, tAI and ER as relevant features. We ﬁnd that in
addition to mRNA and sequence derived features, measurements
relating to translational efﬁciency (ribosomal density and occu-
pancy) are also signiﬁcant. This is to be expected because trans-
lation efﬁciency directly inﬂuences the quantity of protein
synthesized (Greenbaum et al., 2003).

Post-translational regulation

 

Codon bias refers to differences in the frequency of occur-
rences of synonymous codons in coding DNA and evolutionary
origins of codon bias has been investigated by Wallace et a].
(2013). The role of such evolutionarily accrued biases in encod-
ing on protein concentrations has been noted previously
(Brockmann et al., 2007; Tuller et al., 2010). tAI might have a
similar role, being related to the codon adaption index for a gene
(Reis et al., 2004). In a study on the human proteome, Waldman
et al. (2010) directly associate tAI with translational efﬁciency.

3.2 Protein abundance predictor

With the ﬁve features we selected by ll-regularized regression,
protein abundances were predictable to a higher level of accuracy
by a linear predictor than either simply looking for correlation
with mRNA levels or by the features identiﬁed in Tuller et al.’s
(2007) work. Our best ﬁve features gave a correlation of
r2 = 0.86 between predicted and true values, whereas the com-
bination of mRNA, tAI and ER, identiﬁed in Tuller et al.’s
(2007) work, gave only r2 = 0.80. Using all 37 features also
achieved r2 = 0.80 on unseen (cross-validated) data, which is
lower than our ﬁve feature accuracy. Thus, in various combin-
ations of tests the ﬁve features selected from regularization
turned out to be superior.

Performing prediction on neural net non-linear model gave
only r2 = 0.82 for our feature set and r2 = 0.79 for the three
feature combination from previous work. When the neural net
was trained on all 37 features, the accuracy of prediction
dropped drastically to r2 = 0.69. Thus, similar to the observation
made by Tuller et al. (2007), there is no signiﬁcant advantage in
using a non-linear model to this prediction task.

As ER was not selected as a dominant feature in our feature
selection model, we examined the prediction performances by
progressively adding our ﬁve features and then including ER
as a sixth feature. As shown in Figure 2, the inclusion of the
ﬁve features monotonically improved prediction results (this
happens to be true for any order in which they are taken), but
when ER was taken as an additional feature, the results dropped
to r2 = 0.80. ER as the only feature achieves a correlation of

Fig. 2. Performance of ll-regularized regressor, adding features one at
a time. Addition of our mRNA, codon bias, ribosomal occcupancy,
ribosome density and tAI, which identiﬁed by ll-regularization feature
selection process, monotonically increased the accuracy in each step.
However, addition of evolutionary rate reduced the overall accuracy of
the predictor

r2 = —0.46 with protein concentrations. Similar to adaptation

indices, the role of ER as a predictor of protein concentration
is merely an empirical observation noted by researchers (e.g.
Moreira et al., 2002), but the precise molecular mechanism of
regulation remains unknown.

3.3 Post-translational regulations

Figure 3 shows a scatter plot of the predicted protein concentra-
tion (P) against the true concentration (P) from which we
detected outliers, points that are furthest away from the regres-
sion line (shown as solid line). When we select the top 50 outliers,
48 of them were found to be in the upper half of the graph where
P<P, i.e. the measured concentration is smaller than what the
global regression predicts from mRNA level information.

To conﬁrm that proteins for which P < P are likely candidates
for post-translational regulation, we carried out an analysis using
functional annotations at two levels: (i) at a coarse level,
PTMs are a primary requirement for regulation and (ii) at a
ﬁner level, PTMs coupled with information about protein
stability determinants (motifs) are stronger indicators of post-
translational regulation (i.e. Phosphorylation +PEST motifs,
Acetylation+N-termini segments and Ubiquitination—l—D or
KEN Box motifs). At both levels, we looked for over-represen-
tation of annotations within the outlier set when compared with
random subset of same size.

3.4 Level 1: coarse level PTM analysis

Forty-two proteins among the 48 outliers (upper half) were
recognized as being subject to PTMs and are shown in
Table 1. Neither of the proteins found as outliers in the lower
half of the scatter plot had this property.

To estimate a level of conﬁdence in the PTM keyword over-
representation in the outlier set, we used 1000 random samples of
proteins of size 50 and constructed a Gaussian distribution of
the number of PTM proteins found in these sets. The resulting
distribution had mean and standard deviation of 34.286 and
3.576, respectively. From this the claim of over-representation
of PTM proteins among the outlier subset can be made at sig-
niﬁcance of P = 0.02. As is usual in biomedical research of this
kind (McDonald, 2009), if we take a P=0.05 as a threshold of

accepting a hypothesis of interest, our suggestion that proteins in
P< P outlier set are post-translationally modiﬁed is supported.

We also checked 50 outliers from the Tuller et al.’s (2007) three
feature set predictor for signiﬁcance of over-representation of
PTM proteins. Thirty-seven proteins were identiﬁed with PTM
annotations, giving P:0.22. When we took 50 outliers directly
from a scatter plot of mRNA and protein levels, the number of
PTMs detected was 35, corresponding to a P:0.42.

We also looked at various cut-off levels at which an mRNA—
protein pair could be called an outlier with respect to the global
predictor. Setting cut-offs to extract 1, 2.5 and 5% of the data as
outliers, we repeated the above exercise and obtained P-values.
These are shown in Table 2.

With our ﬁve feature predictor, the top 100 outliers containing
over-represented post-translationally modiﬁed proteins are at a
higher level of signiﬁcance than for the top 50 outliers detected
from Tuller et al.’s (2007) three feature predictor (P: 0.17 and
P: 0.22, respectively). This further conﬁrms that the ranking of
data arising from our ﬁve input predictor is more informative.

3.5 Level 2: ﬁner level PTM analysis

At this level of probing annotations of the outlier set of proteins,
37 of the 50 had PTM with motif information. The correspond-
ing conﬁdence level, computed similarly to the level 1 check,
achieved P< 10‘”.

For predictors with Tuller et al.’s (2007) feature set and for
simply considering mRNA—protein scatter plot to pick outliers,
the ﬁner level annotation that gave higher levels of conﬁdence in
over-representation (P : 0.0017 for 26 proteins and P : 0.042 for
22 proteins, respectively).

When we changed the cut-off levels to 1 (20 proteins) and 5%
(100 proteins) of the data deﬁned as outliers, we obtained con-
ﬁdence levels of P: 10‘12 and P:0.001, respectively.

We note that this level of checking annotations information,
i.e. incorporating PTMs with motif information that inﬂuence
protein stability, gives higher levels of conﬁdence in support of
our hypothesis.

Thus, in all checks carried out comparing available annotation
information, we can conclude that the outlier set of proteins are
more likely to be regulated post-translationally. Further, PTM
detection ability of our predictor (by looking at the outliers)
outperformed in both annotation checks.

Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis: We also subjected
the 50 outliers to GO enrichment analysis using Gene Ontology
Enrichment Analysis Software Toolkit (GOEAST) (Zheng

and Wang, 2008). Thirty-seven GO annotations were found
in the outlier set, four of which were common to >30 genes
(GO:0044444, GO:0009058, GO:1901576 and GO:0032991),
and were found in cellular component and biological process
categories. We also observed that our outlier set is enriched for
ribosomal proteins with 14 GO terms relating to the ribosome.

Role of ribosomal proteins: Ribosomal genes are known to
undergo intense transcriptional activity coupled with efﬁcient
translation (\Narner, 1999), followed by several PTMs such as
methionine removal, N—terminal acetylation, N—terminal methy-
lation, lysine N—methylation and phosphorylation (Carroll et al.,
2008). As our outlier set of 50 proteins contained 23 ribosomal
proteins, we evaluated the effect of the dominance of ribosomal
proteins on out methodology. Though several of the ribosomal
proteins in the dataset had high expression levels, their distribu-
tion was not signiﬁcantly different from the remainder. We
repeated the entire analysis after removing the 155 ribosomal
proteins from the dataset. With the reduced set, when we took
50 outliers (3%) 42 had PTM annotations at the level 1 of our
check P:0.02 and P:36 had PTM annotation at the level
of P<10—12. This conﬁrms that the dominance of ribosomal
proteins did not unduly inﬂuence the methodology.

Analysis of protein half-life: We checked if the prediction abil-
ity had any systematic variability that was inﬂuenced by protein
half-life, i.e. concentrations of rapidly degrading proteins likely
to be under-quantiﬁed. We compared absolute and squared
errors of our predictor against protein half-lives published by
Belle et al. (2006) and found no signiﬁcant correlation. Of the
50 outliers we detected, protein half-life data were available for
only 26 proteins, and they showed no systematic behaviour.

3.6 Discussion and conclusion

In this work, we have shown that by constructing a machine
learning based predictor of cellular protein concentrations,
based on the corresponding mRNA levels and other features
pertaining to transcription regulation, we can identify, as out-
liers, proteins that are likely candidates for post-translational
regulation. Of the proteins we identify as outliers, proteins that
are annotated as being subject to PTMs are signiﬁcantly over-
represented than in any random subsets of similar size. We will
not be able to get a perfect ranking in which all post-translation-
ally regulated genes come on top. This is because a gene being
annotated as being subjected to PTM, need not be modiﬁed
under all conditions, several such restrictions are condition
speciﬁc and for richer experimental data will be required to
give a complete picture.

Two generic points also need to be mentioned in closing.
First, when ﬁtting a data-driven model in the analysis of high-
throughput data, outliers or model failures can carry useful
information. Unlike previous authors who focused on the cor-
relation between mRNA and protein levels, and on building
accurate protein concentration predictors, our method, by look-
ing at model failures, extracts potentially useful information
about how these proteins may be regulated. This is an example
of a wider point about the use of machine learning in computa-
tional biology; i.e. the purpose, unlike in building a voice recog-
nition or ﬁnger-print recognition system where performance is
measured in terms of accuracy of classiﬁcation, in biology what

we require is to cut down the space over which experimental
work needs to be carried out to conﬁrm biological function,
PTMs in our case. Ultimately though, proof of biological func-
tion is conﬁrmed in wet-laboratory experimental ﬁndings. What
machine learning can offer is to ﬁnd a reliable reduction in the
space over which such experimental explorations need to be
carried out.

Second, the dataset we put together is synthesized from several
different experiments carried out by different authors in different
laboratories. Though all the experiments correspond to a par-
ticular organism (S.cerevisiae) growing under well-deﬁned
(exponential growth) conditions, there is bound to be variability
in the data resulting from the fact that the different measure-
ments were not taken from identical laboratory conditions. It is
difﬁcult to quantify the effect of such variability in the results
we report.

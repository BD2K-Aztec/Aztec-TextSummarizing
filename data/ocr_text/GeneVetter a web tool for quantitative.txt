Abstract

Summary: When performing DNA sequencing to diagnose affected individuals with monogenic
forms of rare diseases, accurate attribution of causality to detected variants is imperative but im-
perfect. Even if a gene has variants already known to cause a disease, rare disruptive variants pre-
dicted to be causal are not always so, mainly due to imperfect ability to predict the pathogenicity of
variants. Existing population-scale sequence resources such as 1000 Genomes are useful to quan-
tify the ’background prevalence’ of an unaffected individual being falsely predicted to carry causal
variants. We developed GeneVetter to allow users to quantify the ’background prevalence’ of sub-
jects with predicted causal variants within specific genes under user-specified filtering parameters.
GeneVetter helps quantify uncertainty in monogenic diagnosis and design genetic studies with
support for power and sample size calculations for specific genes with specific filtering criteria.
GeneVetter also allows users to analyze their own sequence data without sending genotype infor-
mation over the Internet. Overall, GeneVetter is an interactive web tool that facilitates quantifying

 

and accounting for the background prevalence of predicted pathogenic variants in a population.

1 Introduction

Inaccurate attribution of causality to rare genetic variants found in
sequencing studies of subjects with rare diseases can limit the bene-
fits of screening and potentially result in harm (MacArthur et al.
2014). For accurate classification of a variant’s pathogenicity,
investigators typically account for multiple characteristics, such as
its allele frequency, conservation score and predicted functional con-
sequences. However, even after careful filtering and application of
these parameters to a known set of causal genes, a proportion of
non-causal variants are still at risk for being misclassified as causal
due to imperfect filtering. For example, it is reported than >1% of
general population can be falsely determined to carry causal variants
for maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY), a monogenic

form of diabetes (Flannick et al., 2013). Our work is motivated by a
study of nephrotic syndrome (NS), a rare disease with more than 20
genes implicated as monogenic causes (McCarthy et al., 2013).
Diagnosis of a monogenic cause in an NS patient may be important
for personalizing treatment plans. Many studies have quantified the
fraction of monogenic cases through targeted sequencing followed
by pathogenicity filtering in case-only cohorts (Sadowski et al.,
2014). However, applying imperfect variant-filtering procedures
will misdiagnose a fraction of truly non-monogenic cases as harbor-
ing putative causal variants. In addition, this will result in a
non-negligible rate of ‘background prevalence’ of monogenic NS
diagnosis in the unaffected population. Beyond NS, when making
genetic diagnosis of any rare diseases in clinical or research settings,

new methods and tools that account for this ‘background preva-
lence’ should improve accuracy of this classification.

To facilitate accounting for the background prevalence in
sequencing studies of rare diseases, we developed an intuitive web
tool, GeneVetter. It provides comprehensive analyses and visualiza-
tions of putative causal variants when sequencing a set of genes
across >25 00 individuals in 1000 Genomes (1000G). Users can ob-
tain background prevalence for a specific population and also calcu-
late power and sample size for genetic studies assessing enrichment
of case-specific rare and disruptive variants. When sequencing data
is already available for a specific cohort, users can apply the same
filtering criteria to GeneVetter to systematically compare cases with
1000G, without sending any individual-level information over the
network.

2 Key features

GeneVetter is a highly interactive web application implemented
with AngularfS, based on the 1000 Genomes Phase 3 resources
annotated by deSFP 2.5 and SNPEff 3.5 using GENCODE version
9. The implementation details can be found in the Supplementary
Text. In next the section, we describe the key features of GeneVetter.

2.1. Quantifying uncertainty in monogenic diagnosis

Given a set of genes known or assumed to causes a monogenic form
of disease, GeneVetter quantifies the background prevalence that a
subject in 1000G carries putative causal variants defined by user-
specified criteria. For example, the default variant filtering criteria
for genes under a dominant inheritance model considers a variant to
be pathogenic if its frequency is less than 0.5% in the Exome
Variant Server (EVS) for both European and African Americans and
results either in a loss of function, or, a missense change predicted to
be damaging by at least two of SIFT, PolyPhen2 and
MutationTaster. For genes under a recessive model, the EVS

Fig. 1. (A) Background prevalence for MODY and NS with monogenic causes
estimated by GeneVetter. For both diseases, the background prevalence is
quantified across ~2500 individuals from 1000G using the default filter and a
stringent filter. The stringent filter decreases the AF threshold to 0.1% in the
EVS, requires a GERP++ score> 4, removes variants present in > 1% in any
individual population of 1000G, and uses the most conserved transcript per
gene. (B) The number of case samples required to attain 80% power with
exome-wide significance (P=2.5 x 10‘6) versus ~2500 controls across differ-
ent true prevalence of monogenic case (false negative rate=0.1). Each line
represents the required sample size estimated from the background preva-
lence calculated with default filter in (A) with the same genes

threshold is relaxed to 1%, and two or more variants per gene are
required. The filtering criteria are highly customizable with multiple
prediction methods available. Through an interactive web interface,
GeneVetter displays background prevalence not only across all
~2500 subjects in 1000G but also stratified by continental or sub-
continental population. It also provides top principal components of
genetic ancestry for the carriers of putative causal variants for users
to have a detailed understanding of potential effect of population
stratification.

Figure 1A illustrates the background prevalence of two rare dis-
eases across known monogenic genes, MODY (7 genes-domin-
ant and 0 genes-recessive mode of inheritance) and NS (6 genes-
dominant and 21 genes-recessive mode of inheritance). The striking
enrichment of carriers of putative causal variants compared to the
known disease prevalence suggests that background prevalence esti-
mates are elevated due to imperfect variant filtering, or incomplete
penetrance. When classifying a carrier of putative causal variants as
a monogenic case, we expect a similar risk of misclassifying non-
monogenic cases as monogenic cases if the populations and sequenc-
ing techniques match. Applying a stringent filter is effective to de-
crease the background prevalence, at the potential expense of
decreased sensitivity for identifying truly monogenic cases. The
background prevalence quantified by GeneVetter can allow users to
estimate aggregate relative risk of imperfectly predicted set of causal
variants that could help in determining their clinical implications.

2.2. Designing genetic study of rare diseases

GeneVetter enables researchers to devise well-powered targeted
sequencing studies. If users have an informed estimate of the propor-
tion of cases carrying putative causal variants across a gene set,
GeneVetter calculates the number of samples needed to have a speci-
fied power to identify significant associations in gene-level burden
tests with a specified level of Type I Error. GeneVetter uses the back-
ground prevalence estimated from 1000G as a default baseline, and
calculates the statistical power to identify rare variant associations
for a true prevalence of monogenic cases with a specific sample size.
The hypothesis test used for the power calculations was a difference
in binomial proportions using a z-statistic (see the supplementary
Text and GeneVetter’s help page). By specifying a small Type I error
(e.g. 2.5 X 10‘6), it is also possible to design an exome sequencing
study, calibrated by the power to identify a specific set of high prior-
ity genes. Figure 1B illustrates an example of the power calculation
performed by GeneVetter for MODY and NS.

To further assist with study design, GeneVetter also provides a
simulation in which a user can specify the background prevalence
per gene, number of genes studied and estimated disease prevalence
in a case cohort. Users can inspect how these parameters affect the
total proportion of subjects correctly and incorrectly classified as
monogenic cases, the statistical power or required sample size to
identify associations and the false discovery rate.

2.3. Harmonized and secure comparison of sequenced
cases with public data

Finally, if users have their own set of sequenced cases, GeneVetter
allows them to contrast their VCF file to the 1000G populations by
applying the same pathogenicity criteria. The filtering is performed
in the client’s browser using JavaScript. No individual genotype in-
formation is sent to the server. Only the variant site list is sent to the
server so that GeneVetter can obtain the annotations of variants,
and the information is immediately discarded after the use. The ‘in-
spect’ function summarizes the monogenic prevalence by gene, the

variants that implicate subjects, and all the variants passing the filter
criteria. GeneVetter also displays a point estimate and 95% confi-
dence interval for the odds ratio of monogenic classification in a
user’s cases versus the 1000G subjects.

3 Conclusion

Studying monogenic rare diseases while accounting for the back-
ground prevalence of putative causal variants provides useful quan-
titative information for making accurate monogenic diagnosis,
calibrating stringency of variant filtering and estimating the effect
size from aggregate set of rare variants. GeneVetter comprehensively
and efficiently achieves this in a highly interactive fashion. While its
default settings were chosen carefully, we acknowledge that there is
as of yet no optimal filtering strategy. Thus it is also highly custom-
izable, allowing construction of alternative filters. Users can also
analyze their sequenced cases with GeneVetter and compare with
1000G without transferring individual genotype information over
the network. We expect GeneVetter to aid clinicians and scientists
who may not have time or technical expertise to perform tedious

data management tasks, but seek to improve accuracy in implicating
variants as causal for their disease of interest.

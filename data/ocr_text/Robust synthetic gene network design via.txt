ABSTRACT

Motivation: Synthetic biology aims to develop the artificial gene
networks with desirable behaviors using systematic method. These
networks with desired behaviors could be constructed using diverse
biological parts, which may limit the development to complex
synthetic gene networks. Fortunately, some well-characterized
promoter libraries for engineering gene networks are widely available.
Thus, a synthetic gene network can be constructed by selecting
adequate promoters from promoter libraries to achieve the desired
behaviors. However, the present promoter libraries cannot be directly
applied to engineer a synthetic gene network. In order to efficiently
select adequate promoters from promoter libraries for a synthetic
gene network, promoter libraries are needed to be redefined based
on the dynamic gene regulation.

Results: Based on four design specifications, a library-based search
method is proposed to efficiently select the most adequate promoter
set from the redefined promoter libraries by a genetic algorithm (GA)
to achieve optimal reference tracking design. As the number and
size of promoter libraries increase, the proposed method can play
an important role in the systematic design of synthetic biology.

1 INTRODUCTION

Synthetic biology seeks the improvement of rational design and
reprogramming of biological systems based on design principles.
During the past decade, synthetic biology had signiﬁcant progress
in designing biological parts. Synthetic biologists have assembled
these parts into genetic circuits to achieve basic functions such
as toggle switches (Gardner et al., 2000; Kramer et al., 2004),
oscillators (Atkinson et al., 2003; Goh et al., 2008; Stricker
et al., 2008; Tigges et al., 2009), pulse generators (Basu et al.,
2004), genetic counters (Friedland et al., 2009), logic evaluators
(Rinaudo et al., 2007; Win and Smolke, 2008), ﬁlters (Hooshangi
et al., 2005; Sohka et al., 2009a, b), sensors (Kobayashi et al.,
2004; Win and Smolke, 2007) and cell—cell communicators (Basu
et al., 2005; Kobayashi et al., 2004; Pai et al., 2009). Recently,
the design concepts of next—generation gene networks, such as

tunable ﬁlters, analog—to—digital and digital—to—analog converters,
adaptive learning networks and protein—based computational
circuits, have been proposed to enable the construction of more
complex biological systems (Lu et al., 2009). With the full
understanding of biological parts and modules, synthetic biologists
can construct useful next—generation synthetic gene networks with
real—world applications in medicine, biotechnology, bioremediation
and bioenergy (Lu et al., 2009).

At present, engineered organisms contain only very simple genetic
circuits since there are problems for assembling biological parts
into more complex genetic circuits. For example, although standard
biological parts can be obtained from the Registry of Standard
Biological Parts (http://partsregistry.org), only a few parts have
measured characteristics describing quantitative behavior in the
composed devices (Kelly et al., 2009). There is still lack of an
efﬁcient method to select adequate biological parts from usable
libraries to engineer a genetic circuit to track the desired reference
trajectory (Wu et al., 2011).

In this article, we ﬁrst redeﬁne the presented promoter libraries
based on promoter activity, and then a proposed library—based search
method is used to efﬁciently select adequate promoters through
their promoter activities in order to engineer a synthetic gene
network with desired behaviors despite intrinsic ﬂuctuations and
environmental disturbances on the host cell. The proposed library—
based search method can solve the global optimization problem
by employing genetic algorithm (GA) (Chen and Chen, 2010;
Goldberg, 1989; Grefenstette, 1986; Holland, 1992; Katayama and
Narihisa, 2000; Renders and Flasse, 1996). Hence, the most adequate
promoters from redeﬁned promoter libraries can be efﬁciently
selected to achieve a desired reference trajectory. Finally, two
design examples are given to illustrate the design procedure of the
proposed method in silico. In the future, synthetic biologists can
employ the proposed library—based search method to select the most
adequate promoter set from redeﬁned promoter libraries to construct
a predictable synthetic gene network.

2 METHODS

In order to efﬁciently select adequate promoters from different promoter
libraries for synthetic gene networks to achieve desired behaviors, the
promoter libraries should be redeﬁned based on the promoter activities
according to the promoter characteristics and experimental data in the present
promoter libraries. The design procedure for a synthetic gene network is
shown in Figure 1, including following steps: (i) characterize the redeﬁned
promoter libraries based on the promoter activities; (ii) construct a stochastic

2.1 Redeﬁnition of promoter libraries based on
promoter activities

In general, two types of promoters are used to regulate gene expression in
gene networks, i.e. constitutive— and repressor—regulated promoters. Their
promoter activities of them are both indirectly measured by the ﬂuorescent
protein (Canton 61611., 2008; Murphy 61611., 2007), and a dynamic model can
be used to indirectly evaluate the promoter activities (Ellis etal., 2009; Kelly
etal., 2009; Leveau and Lindow, 2001). The scheme of indirectly measuring
the promoter activities of promoters is shown in Figure 2. It is worth to note
that activatable promoters can also be used in synthetic gene networks. Since
activatable promoters, however, are not used in this study, their promoter

libraries (i.e. Libconst, LibTetR and LibLad) comprise different promoters
(i.e. Jk, k = 0, ..., 18, Tk and Lk, k = 0, ..., 20) with their corresponding
promoter activities of cs and or obtained from experimental data of previous
promoter libraries (Ellis etal., 2009) (See Supplementary Material)

libraries are not mentioned here. The related discussion of promoter libraries
for activatable promoters is mentioned in the Supplementary Material.

In order to redeﬁne the constitutive promoter library, Libconst, a dynamic
model in Figure 2a for a promoter 0 in Libconst can be built. The promoter
activity of c can be determined by assuming the dynamic model at a steady
state (Kelly et 611., 2009)

where yss denotes ﬂuorescence of the gene network at the steady state; 6
and nyGFp denote the degradation rates of mRNA yegfp and protein yEGFP,
respectively. 01 denotes the translation rate; r} is the ratio of ﬂuorescence to the
concentration of yEGFP (Hooshangi et 611., 2005; Leveau and Lindow, 2001).

In this study, we redeﬁne the constitutive promoters BBa_J23100—
BBa_J 23118 in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts
(http://partsregistry.org) to build a constitutive promoter library Libconst and
denote as Jo—J 13 listed in Table 1. The detailed procedure of evaluating the
promoter activity is shown in Supplementary Material.

Since a repressor—regulated promoter is regulated by the repressor, it
has always the minimum and maximum expression with and without the
repressor binding, respectively. Therefore, a promoter in repressor—regulated
promoter libraries has two promoter activities, with and without saturating
concentration of repressor binding.

In Figure 2b, for example, a constitutive promoter expresses the TetR
repressor, which is regulated by anhydrotetracycline (ATc) and represses
the TetR—regulated promoter. In order to simplify the illustration, we
denote the repressor activity r of TetR as the following form (Alon, 2007;
Nakanishi 61611., 2008):

are shown in Table 1.

Furthermore, the parameters KATC and nATC from the repressor activity

identiﬁed and listed in Table 2.

The promoter activity 6: {6r, 63} of each promoter in the LacI—regulated
promoter library LibLacI can be also determined by a similar process, as listed
in Table 1. The detailed procedure for redeﬁning the promoter libraries is
shown in Supplementary Material.

Finally, the promoter regulation function can be extended to illustrate
the promoter activity in the constitutive promoter. The promoter regulation

2.2 Construction of synthetic gene network based on

circuit topology

Consider the synthetic two—stage transcriptional cascade in Figure 3
(Hooshangi 61611., 2005). The yegﬁ) expression is controlled by LacI protein,
which can be repressed by the TetR repressor. TetR is expressed constitutively

 

Fig. 3. A simple synthetic transcriptional cascade. The protein TetR,
expressed constitutively from the constitutive promoter C1, inhibits the
production of LacI by binding the TetR—regulated promoter 62, and LacI
inhibits the production of yEGFP by binding the LacI—regulated promoter 63.

from the promoter selected from Libconst. When IPTG is added to the
growth medium, IPTG binds to the LacI repressor and then induces the
yegﬁ) expression. Suppose x1 (C1 , t ), x2 (C2, 1‘ ), X3 (C3, 1‘ ), X1 (C1 , t ), X2 (C2, 1‘)
and X3 (63,1) as the concentrations of mRNA tetR, 16161, yegﬁ) and proteins
TetR, LacI, and yEGFP, respectively. The dynamic model in Figure 3
with promoters C1, 62 and 63, selected from the promoter library Libconst,
LibTetRLibLaCI, respectively, is modeled as follows (Gardner 61 611., 2000;
Kobayashi 61 611., 2003)

551(ciat)=pj(ciari)_ﬁxi(Ciat)
Xi(ciat)=axi(ciat)_1/1Xi(Ciat)

where y(6,t) denotes the desired concentration of yEGFP; {y1,y2,y3}=
{yretR,yLaC1,nyGFp}; and the three promoters C1, 62 and 63 are considered
as a promoter set, 6: {61,62, 63}.

In general, biological parts are inherently uncertain in this network.
We assume that the promoter activities, degradation rates of mRNAs and
proteins, translation rates are stochastically uncertain due to gene expression
noises in transcriptional and translational processes, thermal ﬂuctuations,
DNA mutations and evolutions (Alon, 2007) as follows:

Ci: {cm-ms,- }—> €1+Acm1(t)= {cm-ms,- }+ {Mn-Ac” }n1(t)

where Acri, Acsi, Ayi, A6 and A01 denote the amplitudes of stochastic
parameter variations, and 11,- (t) is a Gaussian noise with zero mean and unit
variance.

Synthetic gene networks often also suffer from environmental
disturbances on the host cell, as follows:

{561 (Ci’I)=Pj (citri)_ﬁxi (6110+ (Pj(Aci’ri)—Aﬁxi(0111))”i(t)+vi(t)

The design purpose is to select the most adequate promoter set 6* =
{6’f, C: , 6;} from corresponding promoter libraries so that the observed output
y(6*,t) can track the following desired reference trajectory.

yr (t)=fr (I) (10)

Hence, in order to engineer a stochastic synthetic gene network in (9), which
can robustly and optimally track a desired trajectory (10), a library—based
search method is provided to efﬁciently select the most adequate promoter
set 6* = {CT,C:, 6;} from promoter libraries.

2.3 Synthetic gene network design: library-based
search method

Consider a more general design for a synthetic gene network. We extend the
above gene network in Figure 3 with promoters from constitutive, TetR— and
LacI—regulated promoter libraries to an n— gene network with promoters from
m promoter libraries Lib-, j = 1,2, . . .m based on a prescribed genetic circuit
topology. In the n—gene—gene network, the promoter regulation function for
the promoter can be represented as follows:

csi —cri
1+(rt/K,->"f
Ci: {CrI,CSI}€L1b',j=I, 2, ..., m

.C.,r. :Ci_I_
p](l 1) r I (11)

where K]- and nj are the corresponding parameters to be identiﬁed or
estimated. For example, the parameters KTetR and nTetR are for the TetR—
regulated promoter library estimated and listed in Table 2. Hence, a dynamic
model of the n—gene circuit topology with n promoters selected from m
promoter libraries with intrinsic parameter ﬂuctuations and environmental
disturbances is represented as

X(c.t)=f(X.c.t)+Af(X.c.t)n(t)+v(t)
y(C.t)=HX(C.t) , (12)
C={C1,C2,...,Cn}€L1b',j=l, 2, ..., m

where x,- (6,-,t) and X,- (6,-,t) denote the concentrations of mRNA
and proteins in the synthetic gene network, respectively. X (C,l)=
[x1 (c, t),X1 (c, t), . . . ,x,,(c, t),x,,(c, 1)]T denotes the concentrations of mRNAs
and proteins in the synthetic gene network; f (X ,6,t) denotes the non—
linear gene regulation of transcription and translation based on the circuit
topology; Af (X ,6,t) denotes the parameter ﬂuctuations of the non—linear
gene regulation f(X,6,t); and y(6,1):[y1(6,t),...,yp(6,t)]T denotes the
observed proteins we are interested in. H is a p x n output matrix determining
what proteins we are interested in.

The stochastic dynamic system in (12) can be established from the
prescribed genetic circuit topology, and the most adequate promoter set
6*={6’1*,6§,...,6:} selected from corresponding promoter libraries Libj,
j: 1, 2, ..., m can make the synthetic gene network track the prescribed
desired trajectories via the library—based search method. For convenience
in illustrating the proposed library—based search method, four design
speciﬁcations are given as follows:

(1) Given the desired reference trajectory y, (t ) 2f, (t ), which dimension
is consistent with the numbers of ﬂuorescent proteins y (6, t) in ( 12).
(2) Given the promoter libraries Libj, j = 1, ..., m as in Table 1.

(3) Given the environmental disturbances v,- (t) and standard deviations
of promoter activities, ACi={ACrl-,ACSI}, of degradation rates of
mRNAs and proteins, A6 and A74, and of translation rates, A01, to

be tolerated in the host cell. These are quantitative speciﬁcations of
system robustness of synthetic gene networks in the host cell.

(4) Select a promoter set 6: {C1,C2,...,Cn} from the promoter libraries
Libj, j = 1, ..., m to minimize the following cost function, i.e.

tf
J(C)=E/0 (y(C.t)—yr(I))T(y(C.t)—yr(t))dt (13)

If the cost function in (13) can be minimized by selecting the most adequate
promoter set 6* ={6’f,6§, ...,6:} under design speciﬁcations (1)—(4), then
the observed output y(6*, t)of the synthetic gene network can optimally and
robustly track the prescribed reference trajectories yr (1) under the intrinsic
parameter ﬂuctuations and environmental disturbances on the host cells.

Using conventional optimal design methods, the many combinations of
promoter sets required to satisfy four design speciﬁcations generally will
waste a large amount of computation time and trail—and—error experiments.
In this study, a library—based search method using a genetic algorithm (GA)
is employed to select the most adequate promoter set 6* from corresponding
promoter libraries. GA is a stochastic optimization algorithm, originally
motivated by the mechanisms of natural selection and evolutionary genetics.
GA has been proven to be efﬁcient for solving constrained optimization
problems in many areas (Grefenstette, 1986) and further details on GA can
are available elsewhere (Goldberg, 1989). The analysis of computational
complexity is shown in the Supplementary Material.

By the library—based search method and four design speciﬁcations, the
most adequate promoter set 6* can be selected in design speciﬁcation (2).
Despite intrinsic parameter ﬂuctuations and environmental disturbances in
design speciﬁcations (3), the gene network can achieve the desired reference
trajectory in design speciﬁcation (1) by minimizing the cost function J (6) in
design speciﬁcation (4). In fact, this library—based optimal reference tracking
problem in (13) is a highly non—linear optimization problem. In conventional
search algorithms, the optimal solution can be obtained, but it may not be the
global optimization. The library—based search method using GAis an iterative
procedure to select the most adequate promoter set 6* 2 {6’1*, 6:, ...,6:} that
satisﬁes design speciﬁcations (1)—(4). When the most adequate promoter set
6* is selected, design speciﬁcations (1)—(4) for the synthetic gene network
can be satisﬁed, and then the synthetic gene network can track the desired
reference trajectory robustly and optimally.

A design procedure for this library—based search method using GA is given
as follows.

2.4 Design procedure

(1) Build redeﬁned promoter libraries from the experimental data of
maximum and minimum outputs and input—output relationship
between the ﬂuorescence, repressor and inducer.

(2) Construct a genetic circuit topology such as Figure 3 or 4 with
promoters, and then build the stochastic dynamic model in ( 12) for
the synthetic gene network.

(3) Provide the design speciﬁcations (i)—(iv) for the synthetic gene

3 RESULTS

In this section, two in silico design examples are given to illustrate
the design procedure of the proposed library—based search method.
First of all, synthetic biologists need to engineer a genetic circuit
topology, and then a dynamic model could be constructed. Finally,
the proposed library—based search method is used to obtain the most
adequate promoter set 6* ={6’1*,6’2*, . .. ,cfl}.

3.1 Design of synthetic transcription cascade

Consider the dynamic system (7) or (9) of the synthetic
transcriptional cascade shown in Figure 3. The design speciﬁcations
are provided and listed as follows:

(i) The desired reference trajectory to be tracked is

106, 1540,1>80
yr(t)= (14)
2x107, 40<1§80

i.e, the reference trajectory yr (1) is high from 40 to 80h
and low at other times. In this design example, 10 mM IPTG
is added to induce the network transition from 40h and is
removed at 80 h. The concentration of yEGFP will track the
reference trajectory yr (1) in (14).

(11) Since Cl 6 Libconst, C2 6 LibTetR and C3 6 LibLaCI, Cl 6 J m, C2 6
Tk and 63 ELk,m=0, 1, ..., 18,k=0, 1, ..., 20 are looked up
in Table 1.

(iii) Suppose the standard deviations of parameter
ﬂuctuationsA6i={Acri, Acsi}={0.lcri,0.lcsi}, i=1, 2, 3,

disturbances v,- (1) are independent Gaussian white noises
with zero means and unit variances.

(iv) The following mean—square tracking error needs to be
minimized

In order to solve the constrained optimal tracking design
problem of synthetic gene network via the proposed library—
based search method, GA operators are set as follows: (i)
a roulette wheel selection is used to increase the selection
efﬁciency of the population with a lower cost function score;
(ii) the cross—over rate is 0.8; (iii) the chromosome mutates
uniformly with the mutation rate 0.1. Then the most adequate
promoter set 6* ={6’1*,6’2*,6§}={J4, T2, L1} can be obtained.
The simulation result shows that the proposed library—based
search method can efﬁciently ﬁnd the most adequate promoter

set 6* (See Supplementary Figure S2).

3.2 Design of synthetic genetic oscillator

Consider a synthetic gene oscillator with negative feedback loops
shown in Figure 4 (Elowitz and Leibler, 2000). The repressor protein
LacI inhibits the expression of the gene 61, whose protein product in
turn inhibits the expression of the gene 161R. The repressor protein
TetR inhibits the transcription of 16161 and yegfp. The negative

so we suppose the promoter regulation function has a ﬁxed form as (17).

feedback loops lead to temporal oscillations if the adequate promoter
set is selected. For convenience, the concentrations of mRNA: 16161,
61, 161R, yegfp and proteins: LacI, CI, TetR, yEGFP are denoted by
X1 (61,1), X2 (62,1), 963 (C311), 964 (C411), and X1 (61,1), X2 (62,1),
X3 (63,1), X4 (64,1), respectively. The dynamic system for circuit
topology in Figure 4 is given as

Since there is no CI—regulated promoter library at present, we
suppose that the promoter regulation function for CI has a ﬁxed

form as

Based on the synthetic gene network in (3) with intrinsic

speciﬁcations are provided and listed as follows:

4 DISCUSSION

The main challenge in genetic circuit design lies in selecting well—
matched genetic parts that combine and produce the desired behavior
reliably. Some studies have proposed to engineer a synthetic gene
network to achieve a desired steady state (Chen and Wu, 2009)
or an H2 optimal tracking of a desired oscillator (Chen and Wu,
2010). However, the above design methods need to tune some kinetic
parameters to achieve the desired steady or oscillatory state. In fact,
tuning intrinsic parameters of biological devices to ﬁt the designed
parameter is currently quite a difﬁcult or even unfeasible task for
biotechnology. Further, it is still hard to select adequate biological
parts to implement a desired cellular function with quantitative
value. To overcome this problem, synthetic biologists usually create
many versions of synthetic circuits with diverse characteristic by
directed evolution, point mutation or random combinational of DNA
components, and the functions of these versions are investigated
to engineer the gene circuit with the desired behavior (Chatterjee
and Yuan, 2006; Guet et 611., 2002; Yokobayashi et 611., 2002). But
when the design of the genetic circuit is complex, the number of
mutated versions needed to be created and tested is dramatically
increased. Hence, these experimental steps become tedious and
time consuming due to the signiﬁcant amount of trail—and—error
experiments. Our method is to select the existent promoters from
promoter libraries and will be more appealing to synthetic biologists
in the future.

In this study, the present promoter libraries are ﬁrst redeﬁned
based on the dynamic gene regulation from experimental data,
and a library—based search method is then introduced to engineer
a synthetic gene network with desired behaviors by satisfying
four design speciﬁcations. Through re—characteristic biological part
datasheets, we can design a synthetic gene network with a new
function in the existing libraries without having to perform a
large number of trail—and—error experiments. Using GA operators,
the library—based search method is used to mimic the realistic
gene network evolution under natural selection to ﬁt four design
speciﬁcations but with much fast evolution needed for synthetic gene
networks to achieve their desired behaviors. Hence, the proposed
method can efﬁciently engineer a synthetic gene network to perform
its desired behaviors despite intrinsic parameter ﬂuctuations and
environmental disturbances.

In design examples of the synthetic gene network, the most
adequate promoter set 6* is selected to achieve the minimum
tracking error between the desired reference trajectory and the
observed output (i.e. ﬂuorescence) despite intrinsic parameter
ﬂuctuations and environmental disturbances in vivo, as shown in
Supplementary Figure S2. It is worth to notice that this method
is also useful for constructing a synthetic oscillator (Fig. 4). After
constructing the synthetic gene network and providing four design
speciﬁcations, the library—based search method can efﬁciently select
the most adequate promoter set to track the desired trajectory, as
shown in Supplementary Figure S3. For the oscillator design in
Fig. 4, only 71.4% of the promoter sets selected from Table 1
have oscillatory behavior, and only a few set of these can track
the reference trajectory. Furthermore, by the proposed method, the

design procedure of a synthetic gene network can be simpliﬁed for
in vivo experiments.

5 CONCLUSION

In this study, promoter libraries are redeﬁned based on their promoter
activities so that they are more suitable for the gene circuit design
of synthetic biology. The library—based search method can produce
biological insights for how to design a synthetic gene network
with prescribed functions. A GA—based search method is proposed
to mimic the gene network evolution under natural selection to
select adequate promoters to ﬁt four design speciﬁcations with
more fast evolution speed. The proposed design method to select
the most adequate promoter set from promoter libraries will help
synthetic biologists to simplify the design procedure of synthetic
gene networks and accelerate the progress of synthetic biology.
With advances in modern DNA synthesis technologies, together
with well—deﬁned characteristics of promoters and other standard
biological parts, in the future our systematic method could be
widely applied for the faster design cycle of synthetic gene
networks.

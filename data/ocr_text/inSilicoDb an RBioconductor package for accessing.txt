ABSTRACT

Microarray technology has become an integral part of biomedical
research and increasing amounts of datasets become available
through public repositories. However, re-use of these datasets is
severely hindered by unstructured, missing or incorrect biological
samples information; as well as the wide variety of preprocessing
methods in use. The inSilicon R/Bioconductor package is a
command-line front-end to the lnSilico DB, a web-based database
currently containing 86104 expert-curated human Affymetrix
expression profiles compiled from 1937 GEO repository series. The
use of this package builds on the Bioconductor project’s focus
on reproducibility by enabling a clear workflow in which not only
analysis, but also the retrieval of verified data is supported.
Availability: inSilicon is available as part of the Bioconductor
project. There is a companion web interface that can be
used for browsing available datasets before importing them into
R/Bioconductor (http://insilico.ulb.ac.be).

1 THE INSILICO DATABASE: BUILDING ON GEO

With >500 000 genomic proﬁles freely available in NCBI GEO
(Edgar et al., 2002), there is a huge amount of genome—wide
information available, which could contain the clues necessary
to treat fatal diseases such as cancer. However, accessibility to
these datasets requires complex and intensive computational steps.
Additionally, manual parsing and compilation of experimental
attributes and values is tedious and error—prone (Baggerly and
Coombes, 2009). Also, the large number of normalization and
preprocessing methods in use make the comparison of different
existing studies difﬁcult, or even impossible (Sims, 2009).

The inSilico project has uniformly compiled a large amount
of human Affymetrix gene expression studies (Colletta et al.,
in press) from publicly available datasets in GEO—ca. 1 billion gene
expression measurements. Through the inSilicon package, the
InSilico DB content is made available for enhanced programmatic
access. inSilicon enables large—scale genome—wide analysis

through automated scripting by seamless integration with the
R/Bioconductor genome—wide datasets visualization and analysis
platform (Gentleman et al., 2004).

2 USING THE INSILICODB PACKAGE

Other software packages to retrieve gene expression datasets in
R/Bioconductor exist (Davis and Meltzer, 2007). However, the
information about the samples is in a raw form requiring a manual
curation step in transit between a data repository (e.g. GEO)
and a data analysis platform (e.g. R/Bioconductor). In contrast,
inSilicon streamlines this process by providing data manually
veriﬁed by volunteers from the scientiﬁc community. Contributed
content is entered through a spreadsheet—based online collaborative
biocuration platform. This approach avoids the complexity of
deﬁning and using formal ontologies (Shah et al., 2009), but requires
trust in the contributions made by the community.

Accessing these data from the InSilico DB is simple and
straightforward with the inSilicon package:

> library("inSilicon");
> eset = getDataset("GSE78l", "GPL96");
> dim(eset);
Features Samples
22283 17

The getDataset function queries the InSilico DB for a given
series and platform identiﬁers and returns an ExpressionSet
object, a standard R/Bioconductor data structure. In GEO, a Series
is composed of samples assayed on one or more platforms, each
platform containing tens of thousands of gene measurement probe
sets. In InSilico DB, the series are conveniently represented by
multiple samples X genes matrices. Two auxiliary functions to
allow ﬂexible management of studies with multiple platforms are
provided: getDatasets to retrieve, for a given series, all gene
expression matrices, and getPlat forms to retrieve all platforms:

> getPlatforms("GSE78l");
[l] "GPL96" "GPL97"

> esets = getDatasets("GSE78l");
> sapply(esets, annotation);
[l] "hgul33a" "hgul33b"

By default, numerical data downloaded is identical to the data
originally provided by GEO. However, when combining different

studies, a consistent preprocessing is required and therefore all
studies for which raw data exists are available re—normalized [fRMA
normalization algorithm (McCall et al., 2010)].

The unit of interest is usually the gene but there is no consensus
on how to combine microarray probe measurements mapping to the
same gene. The inSilicon offers the option to retrieve the probe
set— or gene—level measurements. For the probe-to-gene mapping,
the most recent versions of the R/Bioconductor platform annotation
packages are used (hgu13 3a. db, hgul3 3plus2 . db, ...). The
maximum probe set value is retained when multiple probe sets map
to the same gene.

The following example illustrates the use of the gene s parameter.

> eset = getDataset("GSE78l", "GPL96",
genestALSE);
> dim(eset);
Features Samples
22283 17

> eset = getDataset("GSE78l", "GPL96",
geneszTRUE);
> dim(eset);
Features Samples
12679 17

Both normalization and gene/probe options are precomputed for
all datasets and are therefore as fast and easy to retrieve as the
original data.

3 AN EXAMPLE

Once an expression set is retrieved, all available Bioconductor
packages can be applied for further analysis. Executing the code
below results in the clustered heatmap shown in Figure 1:

> library("limma")
> library("inSilicon")

> eset = getDataset("GSE4635", "GPL96",
norm="FRMA", geneszTRUE)

> labels 2 pData(eset)[ ,"Smoker"]
> design 2 model.matrix(~labels)

# Find significant genes
> fit 2 eBayes(lmFit(eset, design))
> t = topTable(fit, coef22)[,c("ID","logFC","adj.P.Val")]
> deg = t[sort(t[,"logFC"],index=TRUE,decr=TRUE)$ix,"ID"]

> heatmap(exprs(eset[deg,]), labColzlabels, RowvaA)

More information and examples to perform large—scale analyses
can be found in the accompanying vignette of this package.

4 CONCLUSION

The inSilicon R/Bioconductor package provides an efﬁcient means
of performing large—scale genomic analysis on the large and
growing amount of human Affymetrix gene expression proﬁles using
automated scripting. The accompanying web interface (InSilico
DB) allows search and browsing of curated datasets that can then
be automatically retrieved, adding a means for reproducible data
sourcing to the reproducible analysis platform R/Bioconductor.

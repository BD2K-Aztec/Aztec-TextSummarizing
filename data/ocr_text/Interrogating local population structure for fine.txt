ABSTRACT

Motivation: Adjustment for population structure is necessary to
avoid bias in genetic association studies of susceptibility variants
for complex diseases. Population structure may differ from one
genomic region to another due to the variability of individual
ancestry associated with migration, random genetic drift or natural
selection. Current association methods for correcting population
stratification usually involve adjustment of global ancestry between
study subjects.

Results: We suggest interrogating local population structure for
fine mapping to more accurately locate true casual genes by better
adjusting the confounding effect due to local ancestry. By extensive
simulations on genome-wide datasets, we show that adjusting
global ancestry may lead to false positives when local population
structure is an important confounding factor. In contrast, adjusting
local ancestry can effectively prevent false positives due to local
population structure and thus can improve fine mapping for disease
gene localization. We applied the local and global adjustments to the
analysis of datasets from three genome-wide association studies,
including European Americans, African Americans and Nigerians.
Both European Americans and African Americans demonstrate
greater variability in local ancestry than Nigerians. Adjusting local
ancestry successfully eliminated the known spurious association
between SNPs in the LCT gene and height due to the population
structure existed in European Americans.

1 INTRODUCTION

Unrecognized population structure can potentially lead to both false
positive and false negative ﬁndings in genetic association studies
(Campbell et al., 2005; Lander and Schork, 1994; Zhu et al.,
2008a, b). Current statistical method used to adjust population

stratiﬁcation in genetic association studies often focus on adjusting
global population structure, which is mainly caused by recent
migration and genetic random drift. Global population structure
can be characterized as an individual’s global ancestry calculated
as the proportion of the individual’s genome inherited from a given
ancestral population. In contrast, local population structure can be
characterized in a similar way but in local genomic region or at
a locus. A popular procedure to eliminate the effect of population
structure is the genomic control (GC) approach (Devlin and Roeder,
1999), which assumes that the variance inﬂation factor of a test
statistic is a constant across the genome. However, variance inﬂation
can also be due to locus—speciﬁc attributes. For example, the imprint
of natural selection has recently been identiﬁed in many regions
across the genome (Sabeti et al., 2007; Voight et al., 2006), and can
create substantial variation in F S; which in turn affects the degree
of variance inﬂation for speciﬁc loci (Crow and Kimura, 1970).
Thus, the GC approach will eliminate the effect due to the global
population structure, but may not be effective in eliminating the
effect due to local population structure. An alternative method to
correct population structure is based on the principal components
(PCs) of the genotypes, in which the PCs of the genotype score
matrix of many markers across the entire genome (referred to as
global PCs hereafter) are used to represent individual ancestry
background and used as covariates in association analysis (Epstein
et al., 2007; Price et al., 2006; Zhu et al., 2002, 2008a, b). Various
studies have shown that the global PCs can effectively represent
human demographic history (Cavalli—Sforza and Bodmer, 1999;
Novembre and Stephens, 2008). However, local genomic regions
harboring functional variants may be subject to subtle forms of
population structure not only as a result of demographic history
but natural selection and local random ﬂuctuations of admixture
(Genovese et al., 2010; Tang et al., 2007).

In genome—wide association studies, numerous markers are
usually tested one at a time. The test of a non—causal maker locus,
which is dependent of a causal gene, may be confounded by a
pathway leading through both global and local ancestries (Fig. 1).
The dependence between a non—causal marker and a causal gene
may due to short range or long—range LD. Short—range LD may exist
when two loci are nearby. Long—range LD might exist between two
genes in different chromosomes, i.e. due to co—evolution (Rohlfs
et al., 2010).

Fig. 1. The pathways which confound the relationship between a non—causative marker G and phenotype Y. A single—arrowed line indicates correlation which
is possibly directive (i.e. D to Y), and a double—arrowed line indicates correlation only. Population history determines local ancestries Ag, AD and their
correlation, i.e. Ag and AD can be correlated if markers G and D are close to each other, population admixture or co—evolution occurred on both regions;
local ancestries impact the variations of I‘ and the allele frequencies of G and D; and D and I‘ directly impact phenotypic variation. Therefore, both global and
local ancestries may confound G— Y relationship. Ag may impact phenotypic variation either indirectly (A) due to correlation or directly (B) due to natural
selection. Adjusting Ag can effectively control the type I error due to the confounding by both Ag and I‘. Adjusting I‘ alone may not well control type I error,

especially when Ag directly confounds the G— Y association.

We reason that the whole genome is a mosaic consisting of
chromosome segments coming from different ancestral populations.
Figure 1A illustrates one way of thinking about global and local
ancestries. For one individual, we denote by Ag the local ancestry
of one marker genotype and deﬁne the global ancestry (P) as
the average of Ag across the entire genome. Individuals within
a population have varying family trees leading to variation in F.
For example, some African Americans may have 25% European
ancestry, whereas some others may have 50% European ancestry.
While P and Ag are correlated as shown in Figure 1A, they
are different quantities. The allele frequencies of a marker may
be different in different ancestral populations. Hence, the global
ancestry (P) and genotype (G) are independent conditioning on local
ancestry (Ag). However, conditioning on global ancestry (P), the
phenotype (Y) may still be dependent on Ag due to the pathway
G—Ag—AD—D—Y (see Pearl, 2010 for a further explanation
of admissible covariates). Hence, when testing for genotype—
phenotype association, type I error may not be adequately controlled
in principle by adjusting global ancestry P alone. It may be
instructive to adjust local ancestry Ag. Figure 1B further illustrates
why adjusting local ancestry (Ag) is important for ﬁne mapping. In
this ﬁgure, AD is the local ancestry at the causal gene (D), which
is associated with the marker (G). There are multiple pathways
confounding the genotype—phenotype relationship. The pathways
G— Ag — Y and G— Ag — AD — Y may be blocked by adjusting Ag
but cannot be blocked by adjusting P. When attempting to detect
genes, one may not wish to block the pathway G — Ag — Y because
the marker (G) possibly nears a true causal locus. Local ancestry
adjustment, however, may serve to reﬁne the location of the true
disease locus.

With current high—throughput genotyping technologies and recent
methods development on ancestry inference (Patterson et al., 2004;
Price et al., 2009; Pritchard et al., 2000; Sankararaman et al., 2008;
Tang et al., 2006; Zhu et al., 2006), it is possible to estimate the
ancestry of a local genomic region even when the entire genome
is a mixture of several ancestral populations. In practice, the real
ancestry at a speciﬁc locus is usually unknown. For recently admixed
populations such as African Americans, the ancestral populations are

typically known with good approximation. In this situation, locus—
speciﬁc ancestry can be inferred accurately using hidden Markov
model—based methods (Patterson et al., 2004; Price et al., 2009;
Pritchard et al., 2000; Sankararaman et al., 2008; Tang et al., 2006;
Zhu et al., 2006). However, it is difﬁcult to accurately infer locus—
speciﬁc ancestry for a population whose substructure is subtle,
due to either the lack of information on the ancestral population
or when admixture has occurred within similar populations. For
example, among European Americans, where population admixture
occurred within populations of similar origin, it is difﬁcult to
accurately infer locus—speciﬁc ancestry due to the lack of ancestral
population information. For such scenarios, we propose using
local PCs to present local ancestries. By extensive simulations,
we ﬁnd that the correlation between global PCs and true local
ancestries is very weak. Hence, global PCs may not well capture
the variations in local ancestry. In contrast, the PCs of the genotype
score matrix of the markers within local genomic regions (referred
to as local PCs hereafter) are strongly correlated with true local
ancestries.

To illustrate the advantages of incorporating local PCs into
ﬁne mapping, we evaluated Local Ancestry Principal Components
Correction (referred to as LAPCC). Our simulation results illustrated
that LAPCC was more effective in eliminating false positives
due to local population structure than Clobal Ancestry Principal
Components Correction (referred to as GAPCC) and it retained
testing power successfully. We further performed local PC analysis
and LAPCC to the datasets from genome—wide association studies
(GWAS) in three populations: African—Americans from Maywood,
Illinois, Nigerians from Igbo—Ora and Ibadan, Nigeria and European
Americans from Framingham, Massachusetts (Kang et al., 2010;
Levy et al., 2009). High degrees of variability in local ancestry
of African Americans and European Americans were uncovered
whereas very little was found among Nigerians of Yoruba ethnicity.
This result is consistent with the demographic histories of the three
populations. In addition, LAPCC successfully removed the spurious
association between the LCT gene and height, which results from
Northern and Southern European population structure in European
Americans.

Interrogating local population structure for fine mapping

 

2 METHODS

2.1 Association methods

In LAPCC, we divided each chromosome into 4 Mb adjacent window cores
according to the SNP map and constructed an envelope with an 8 Mb—margin
to each side of the window core (Supplementary Fig. $1). The left (right)
envelopes of the ﬁrst (last) two windows on each chromosome might be
shorter than the inner envelopes. We computed the ﬁrst 10 PCs of the
genotype score matrix of the SNPs within the enveloped 20 Mb window. This
window size was chosen based on the linkage disequilibrium due to recent
population admixture (Patterson et al., 2004; Zhu et al., 2006). These local
PCs were then used to adjust population structure for the SNPs within the
4 Mb core. At each SNP in the core, we computed genotype score residuals
g, and trait value residuals y,- by regressing genotype scores g,- and trait
values y,- on the 10 PCs, respectively. We measured the evidence of trait—
SNP association by s2 =(N—12)r2/(1—r2), where N was the number of
individuals used after excluding individuals with missed genotypes and r was
the correlation coefﬁcient between residuals y,- and 52,-. Asymptotically, s2
follows x? under the null and if population structure is well adjusted. In
GAPCC, the ﬁrst 10 global PCs were computed using the genotypes of all
markers across the genome and utilized in the aforementioned way to contrast
the association test of each SNP, which is similar to EIGENSTRAT (Price
et al., 2006). When the true local ancestry is known, we can incorporate
the true local ancestry in a regression model and we termed this approach
as RegRA. We termed the naive regression analysis without controlling for
population structure as RegUa.

2.2 Local and global PCs

To assess the degree of discrepancies between global PCs and local PCs,
we calculated the coefﬁcients of multiple—determination (R2) and squared
coefﬁcients of canonical correlation (A2). Let N denote the sample size,
A: [31, ...,aK] denote the N x K matrix consisting of the ﬁrst K global PCs,
and B: [b1,...,bK] denote the N ><K matrix consisting of the ﬁrst K local
PCs in a local window. The coefﬁcient of multiple—determination R].2 for

bj and A is the R2 in the linear regression of bj on A. The j—th largest
squared coefﬁcient of canonical correlation A]? between A and B is the j—th
largest coefﬁcient of determination between any linear combination of B’s
columns and any linear combination of A’s columns. Mathematically, R? 5
A? and R? + ~ ~ ~ +R12{ = A? + ~ ~ ~ + A2 ,Rj2 equals the j—th diagonal element and
A]? equals to the j—th largest eigenvalue of B/ AA/ B, and 121225.21 +...+rj2K,
where rjzl.=(b/ja,-)2 is the coefﬁcient of determination between bj and 3,.
Canonical correlation analysis and multiple—determination analysis enable
us to evaluate the degree of discrepancies between local and global PCs and
facilitate the exploration of population structures. R2 indicates how much
variation of local PCs can be accounted for by global PCs and A2 measures
the shared variance between local and global PCs.

2.3 GWAS data

In our analysis, we used three genome—wide datasets: Maywood, Nigeria
and Framingham (Kang et ul., 2010; Levy et ul., 2009). The detailed
description and QC for Maywood and Nigeria data can be found in Kang
et al. (2010). Brieﬂy, the Maywood cohort included 775 unrelated African
Americans sampled from Maywood, IL, with 909 622 SNPs genotyped by
Affymetrix 6.0 platform. We dropped 74 individuals because of possible
DNA contamination, false identity and relatedness. For the 701 retained
individuals, we removed 86 800 SNPs whose missing rates >5%, minor
allele frequencies <1%. The ﬁnal analysis dataset included 822 822 SNPs
in each of 701 individuals. Similar QCs were applied to Nigeria data,
which Affymetrix 6.0 platform was also used for genotyping. After QCs, the
Nigeria dataset contained 759 222 SNPs genotyped for 982 individuals. For
Framingham dataset, Mendelian errors were checked and the corresponding
SNPs with Mendelian inconsistence were set missing. SNPs with HWE
P < 10‘6 were dropped. We selected unrelated individuals from each family

(i.e. spouses) based on an algorithm that prioritizes individuals with higher
genotyping rates, selecting individuals at random when needed. After
QCs, the Framingham dataset contained 415 281 SNPs genotyped for 1106
unrelated individuals.

3 SIMULATION STUDIES
3.1 Designs

3.1.] Admixed populations without selection pressure We ﬁrst
applied the software ADMIXPROGRAM (Zhu et al., 2006)
to the Maywood dataset to infer the individual’s SNP—speciﬁc
ancestries for the 701 Maywood subjects using 2606 selected
ancestry informative SNPs. We observed that the distribution
of individual genome—wide CEU allele portions can be well
ﬁtted by Beta(4.8, 19.2), the beta distribution with mean 0.2 and
standard deviation 0.08. Based on this distribution, we simulated an
admixed population with average 20% European and 80% African
ancestries. Speciﬁcally, we simulated N,- individuals with average
ancestries wl- (Supplementary Material). For each individual, we
simulated the genotypes at the SNPs on 22 autosomes using
HapMap dataset, which included 1969 739 SNPs with complete
haplotype information for CEU, YRI and CHB/JPT samples. For
each autosome, we simulated the number of crossover points s from
the Poisson distribution of mean ,u :1 X g X 10‘7, where l was the
length of an autosome, g was the generation since the individual
began admixture and was randomly sampled from 1 to 10. Then,
we uniformly distributed s crossovers across the chromosome.
Next, we randomly sampled haplotype segments from CEU or YRI
HapMap data between two crossovers independently according
to the average ancestry wi. Using this simulation procedure
(denoted by GenoAnceBaseO), we simulated the SNP genotypes
and ancestries for 2000 unrelated individuals.

3.1.2 Admixed populations with selection pressure We assumed
that natural selection will result in non—concordance between local
and global ancestry. For each of the 22 autosomes, we randomly
picked one locus where selection pressure would be observed. We
adopted speciﬁc admixture weights for the segments covering the
chosen loci. For an odd (even) numbered chromosome, we simulated
the segments covering the locus with average 10% (40%) European
ancestry and 90% (60%) African ancestry. For the rest of genomic
regions, we applied the algorithm GenoAnceBaseO. We called the
method for generating selection pressure as GenoAnceBasel.

3.1.3 Genetic models To compare different methods, we
considered six different genetic models (Supplementary Table S1).
Models 1, 2 and 3 were designed to evaluate whether type I errors are
under control for different methods. Speciﬁcally, in Model 1, only
global ancestry contributed to the phenotypic variation; in Model
2, only local ancestries contributed to the phenotypic variation;
whereas in Model 3, both global and local ancestries contributed
to the phenotypic variation. Models 4, 5 and 6 were designed to
evaluate the utilities for ﬁne mapping for different methods. Besides
random effect and the effects of 66 QTLs, in Model 4, only global
ancestry contributed to the phenotypic variation; in Model 5, only
local ancestries contributed to the phenotypic variation; whereas
in Model 6, both global and local ancestries contributed to the
phenotypic variation. We randomly sampled three SNPs on each
chromosome as QTLs for all the three models, but for Models 5

and 6 we let one QTL fall in the region where selection pressure
was present. This enabled us to investigate the impact of local
ancestry on the power for different methods. Among the 66 QTLs we
simulated, one had a strong effect and explained phenotypic variance
nine times higher than each of the other 65 QTLs, which explained
the same amount of phenotypic variance. The variances expressed
by global ancestry, local ancestry and QTLs for all the six models
were listed in Supplementary Table S1. For both power and type
I error comparisons, we simulated datasets with 2000 individuals
each. To mimic the Maywood Affymetrix 6.0 data, we kept 554 297
of the Maywood SNPs which were present in HapMap for CEU,
YRI and CHB/JPT samples, and sampled additional 245 703 SNPs
from the HapMap via rejection sampling (Supplementary Fig. S2).
For Models 4—6, we sampled only 29 QTLs and the others were
assumed to have not been genotyped.

3.2 Results

3.2.] PCs and true local ancestries We used simulations to
examine whether the local PCs can represent local ancestries better
than global PCs. Using the Maywood and HapMap datasets, we
simulated a dataset using the GenoAnceBaseO algorithm to mimic
the admixture of two ancestral populations without local population
structure, i.e. no selection pressure conﬁned to speciﬁc genomic
regions. We also simulated a dataset using the GenoAnceBasel
algorithm to ensure the presence of local population structure under
the circumstances where selection was acting on speciﬁc loci.
Since selection may occur in different regions in the genome, in
the datasets generated using the GenoAnceBasel algorithm we
randomly selected 1 local region in each of the 22 autosomes
with a selection effect. Since the real ancestry at each locus was
known, we calculated the adjusted RZ—value (Rgdj) by regressing
the real ancestry at each SNP on the ﬁrst 10 local PCs of the
enveloped window. For comparison, we also computed the Rid].
value by regressing the real ancestry at each SNP to the ﬁrst
10 global PCs. Figure 2 displays the distributions of Rid]. values
for local and global PCs in the two simulated datasets. For both
simulated datasets, local PCs reﬂected variation of real ancestry
much better than global PCs. For the dataset by GenoAnceBaseO,
Rid]. = 0.50 :l: 0.09 for local PCs wheras Rid]. = 0.10 :l: 0.03 for global

PCs. For the dataset by GenoAnceBase1,R3dj = 0.50 :l: 0.09 for local
PCs, whereas Rid]. = 0.09 :l: 0.03 for global PCs. The Rid]. values of

the real ancestries for global PCs in the 22 regions under selection
pressure were even smaller when compared with other genomic
regions, as evidenced by the hump in Figure 2B due to the 22 regions
with selection pressure. Our results indicate that global PCs do not
capture local ancestry well, especially when signiﬁcant effects from
natural selection are present.

3.2.2 Type I When there are no genetic variants contributing
to the phenotypic variation, a quantile—quantile (Q—Q) plot of
—log10(P—value) of a test statistic against a uniform distribution
should be close to the diagonal line. Supplementary Figure S3
displays the Q—Q plots of single SNP analysis for the four different
methods when applied to the datasets simulated from Models 1
to 3. RegUa performed poorly because there was no adjustment
of population structure. When only global ancestry contributed to
phenotypic variation (Model 1), both RegRA and LAPCC were
within the 95% concentration band and GAPCC was associated
with a slightly inﬂated type I error rate (Supplementary Figs S3Ai
and S3Aii). However, when phenotypic variation was inﬂuenced by
local ancestry (Models 2 and 3), GAPCC yielded notably inﬂated
type I error rates whereas both RegRA and LAPCC still controlled
type I error rates close to the nominal level (Supplementary
Figs 83B and S3C). The Q—Q plots of GAPCC went beyond the
95% concentration band and the k—values were substantially larger
than 1. GAPCC failed to control type I error rates when the local
ancestries contributed to phenotypic variation. In contrast, the Q—Q
plots of RegRA and LAPCC were concentrated around the diagonal
line and the k—values were close to 1.

To address the robustness of LAPCC to the change of window—
wide SNP density, we dropped the odd—numbered SNPs and re—
analyzed the genotype—ancestry data of even—numbered SNPs in the
simulated Affymetrix 6.0 datasets and studied the representativeness
of the ﬁrst 10 PCs of 20—Mb local windows for the ancestry
structures of their 4—Mb cores. Even though half of SNPs dropped,
the patterns of false positive control were essentially unchanged
(comparing Supplementary Fig. S4 with S3). This suggested that
window—wide local PCs well maintained the representativeness for
true local ancestry structures (Supplementary Fig. S5). The denser a
window, the better the local PCs capture the true ancestry. However,
the improvement is limited in general, suggesting the SNP density
of Affymetrix 6.0 or Affymetrix 500K is adequate for controlling
population stratiﬁcation using LAPCC (Supplementary Fig. S6 and
Table S2). It should be noted that ideally we would require each

testing SNP is centered with its own 20—Mb window and our
approach is only for reducing computational burden when analyzing
GWAS data. In this case, the performance should be even better.

3.2.3 Power We evaluated the power of different methods based
on 1000 replicate datasets generated under three QTL models
(Models 4—6 in Supplementary Table S1). Table 1 shows the power
for the three methods, viz, GAPCC, LAPCC and RegRA. Power
for LAPCC and RegRA was only slightly lower than GAPCC for
all the models we evaluated. However, power of GAPCC could be
overestimated when local ancestries contributed to the phenotypic
variation because GAPCC might fail to control type I error as noted
below. When true ancestry was known, RegRA seemed to have
slightly better power than LAPCC.

3.2.4 Fine mapping Since linkage disequilibrium created by
admixture may extend over much longer distance than the
background LD (Zhu et al., 2006), we expect to see association
signals for many non—causal markers surrounding a true QTL
if local population structure is not properly controlled, even
when the distance to the QTL is over several mega base pairs.
We examined the performance of LAPCC and GAPCC for the
1351 SNPs within a 5Mb region of the strongest QTL (Fig. 3).
When global ancestry contributed to phenotypic variation, LAPCC
and GAPCC performed similarly and we did not observe high
signiﬁcance for the SNPs far away from the QTL (Fig. 3A).
However, when local ancestry contributed to the phenotypic
variation, we observed that substantially more SNPs were in
association with GAPCC than LAPCC, and many of them were
several Mbp away from the true QTL (Figs 3B and 3C).
Similarly, we also observed more SNPs showing association
evidence with GAPCC than LAPCC for QTLs with smaller
effects (data not shown). Our results suggest that false positives
might be detected if local population structure at non—causal
markers is not properly controlled. LAPCC could effectively
eliminate such spurious association and thus improve mapping
resolution.

4 APPLICATIONS TO GWAS DATASETS

4.1 PCA

We compared local and global PCs from the three GWAS datasets
to uncover local ancestry patterns in the three populations. Figure 4
presents the RZ—values of the ﬁrst local PC in each window and
global PCs as well as the largest kz—value between local PCs in
each window and global PCs. The distribution of the top 10 R2— and
kz—values are presented in Supplementary Figure S7. In general,
we observed a small degree of correlation between local and global
PCs in the samples we studied. However, the R2 of the ﬁrst local PC
and AZ are substantially larger for the Maywood and Framingham
samples than for Nigerian sample (Fig. 4), similar for the R2 values
for the rest local PCs (Supplementary Fig. S7). The results of the
other AZ values for the three GWAS datasets are similar. These
results suggest that there is relatively little population structure in
the Nigerian sample, whereas Maywood and Framingham display
relatively more population structure. Somewhat surprisingly, the
Framingham participants demonstrated much more complex local
population structure than the other two samples, at odds with the
usual assumptions. To alleviate the concern that the ﬁnding in the
Framingham data was caused by the presence of related individuals
we removed 22 participants who shared >15% of their genome
identical by descent. The results were essentially the same (data not
shown).

4.2 Association analysis

To the three GWAS datasets, we applied RegUa, GAPCC, LAPCC
to study the BMI and height association. To remove the potential
confounding effect of age and gender, we regressed log(BMI) and
height on age and obtained the residuals, within each gender (Kang
et al., 2010). We then performed linear regression by regressing the
residuals on each SNP, which was coded additively. Supplementary
Figure S8 shows the Q—Q plots of the —log10(P—value) for
association tests for the three methods. We observed that the
three methods performed similarly for both the Maywood and the
Nigeria datasets, but their performance differs substantially for
Framingham (Supplementary Figs S8A and S8B). Interestingly,
RegUa had similar GC inﬂation k—values as the other two
methods for both height and BMI in Maywood, which seems
contradictory to the intuition, as it is generally believed that
population structure will inﬂate type I errors. For the Nigeria
dataset, the three methods performed equally well, consistent
with the aforementioned observation that the Nigerian samples
did not have either global or local population structure. For the
Framingham data, we observed the largest GC inﬂation k—value
for RegUa, followed by LAPCC and GAPCC for both BMI and
height (Supplementary Fig. S8C). One possible reason for the
relatively large k—value for LAPCC is that the 10 PCs we calculated
may not well capture the local population structure if a speciﬁc
window does not include enough ancestry informative markers
(AIMs). It is also possible that there are a large number of height—
associated variants across the genome and the collection of these
variants will result in departure from the diagonal line for the Q—Q
plot. To investigate this further, we examined the known spurious
association between SNPs in the LCT gene and height, which
results from Northern and Southern European population structure
in European Americans (Campbell et al., 2005). Both LAPCC and

the true QTL. (A) Global ancestry contributes to phenotypic variation. (B) Local ancestries contribute to phenotypic variation. (C) Both global and local

GAPCC eliminated this spurious association but RegUa did not
(Table 2).

Many genetic variants have been reported to contribute to
variation in human height (Gudbjartsson et al., 2008; Lettre et al.,
2008; Weedon et al., 2007, 2008). We searched the published
literature and identiﬁed 121 SNPs reported to be in strong association
with height, 56 out of which were also available in the Framingham
dataset. Supplementary Figure S9A displays the Q—Q plot obtained
from these 56 SNPs. The LAPCC had a slightly larger k—value
than GAPCC. We further examined the 100—Kb regions surrounding
the 121 reported SNPs and identiﬁed 2879 SNPs genotyped in
the Framingham dataset. We then presented the Q—Q plot for
these SNPs and again LAPCC had a larger k—value than GAPCC
(Supplementary Fig. S9B). In both cases, we observed that LAPCC
had larger k—values than GAPCC, which could be potentially caused
by cryptic relatedness among the subjects. To eliminate the impact of
relatedness, we further removed the 22 individuals as identiﬁed by
IBD analysis (Section 4.1) and analyzed the reﬁned data for height
association. The Q—Q plot patterns were essentially unchanged
although the k—values of RegUa and GAPCC increased slightly
(Data not shown). Thus, the observed larger k—value for LAPCC
in Framingham height association might be caused by large amount
of true genetic variants contributing to height, although we cautioned
that LAPCC could not perform well in some regions without
sufﬁcient AIMs. Further simulations (Supplementary Figs S 10—S 12)
indicate that 600—2000 QTLs with small genetic effects together
with SNPs in LD with QTLs may lead the genomic inﬂation factor to

be larger than one, further suggested that the observed larger k—value
for LAPCC might be caused by large amount of height QTLs.

5 DISCUSSIONS

In this article, we investigated the effectiveness of local and global
ancestry adjustments for ﬁne mapping in genetic association studies.
Through extensive simulations, we observed that local PCs were
strongly correlated with true local ancestry, whereas global PCs were
merely weakly correlated with the true local ancestry. Moreover,
our simulations illustrated that adjusting local ancestry (i.e. LAPCC
or RegRA) was able to remove spurious association due to both
global and local population structure and retain statistical power,
whereas global ancestry adjustment methods such as genomic
control and global PC—based methods may be inadequte. In our
simulations, many signiﬁcantly associated SNPs surrounding the
causal variants in the GAPCC analysis were no longer signiﬁcant
in the LAPCC analysis, whereas the causal variants are essentially
not affected. When spurious association is created due to the
long—range LD, which is shown in Figure 1 when the correlation
between Ag and AD is due to coevoluation, our proposed method
should also work well. Further, we point out that adjusting local
ancestry may in theory reduce type I error equally well as adjusting
global ancestry when local ancestry confounds association only
through global ancestry. When only global population structure is
present, the power of LAPCC is still comparable to the power of
GAPCC.

Our simulation ﬁndings were corroborated by the application
of PCA, LAPCC and GAPCC to the three real GWAS datasets.
We observed that there could be abundant variation in local
ancestry structure across the genome and local ancestry would be
weakly correlated to global ancestry for admixed poulations, i.e.
African Americans and European Americans, consistent with the
demographic histories of these populations. For the three GWAS
datasets, the association results produced by LAPCC are roughly
comparable to those produced by GAPCC. For the Framingham
height data, RegUa had the largest GC inﬂation A—value, followed
by LAPCC and GAPCC. To investigate whether it was due to

the reduced power of GAPCC, we further examined the SNPs
surrounding the loci reported to be associated with height. As
expected, LAPCC had much larger GC inﬂation k—value than
GAPCC did, suggesting that the smaller k—value for GAPCC could
be due to the power reduction since global ancestry adjustment
might not completely remove the effect of population stratiﬁcation.
Furthermore, we examined the SNPs in the LCT gene which
was reported to be spuriously associated with height in European
Americans. LAPCC ﬁrmly abolished all those SNPs found positive
by RegUa, suggesting that local ancestry adjustment would control
the effect due to population structure in European populations. For
the Maywood data, we observed that RegUa had a similar GC
inﬂation k—value to LAPCC and GAPCC, ﬁtting a continuous gene
ﬂow model under which population structure would not have a large
effect in association studies (Rosenberg and Nordborg, 2006). For
the Nigerian data, all the three methods performed similarly, and this
observation is consistent with our observation that no substantial
local or global population structure is present in Nigerians.

Like other approaches, the LAPCC has limitations. The SNP
density of a segment may impact its performance. In our analyses,
it worked well when a 20—Mb window covered >1000 SNPs in
minimum (Supplementary Figs S3—S6 and Table S2). We caution
that it may not perform well in the regions without enough AIMs.
It is reasonable to run LAPCC on the subset of markers which
are found positive by GAPCC. In doing so, we could prevent
false positives due to other confounding resources, improve ﬁne
mapping and save computing time as well. In addition, it may

be possible to improve LAPCC by introducing some metric of
deﬁning a meaningful window size instead of working with a ﬁxed
window size.

Abstract

Summary: Biological sequence databases are integral to efforts to characterize and understand
biological molecules and share biological data. However, when analyzing these data, scientists are
often left holding disparate biological currency—molecular identifiers from different databases. For
downstream applications that require converting the identifiers themselves, there are many re-
sources available, but analyzing associated loci and variants can be cumbersome if data is not
given in a form amenable to particular analyses. Here we present BISQUE, a web server and cus-
tomizable command-line tool for converting molecular identifiers and their contained loci and vari-
ants between different database conventions. BISQUE uses a graph traversal algorithm to general-
ize the conversion process for residues in the human genome, genes, transcripts and proteins,
allowing for conversion across classes of molecules and in all directions through an intuitive web
interface and a URL-based web service.

Availability and implementation: BISQUE is freely available via the web using any major web
browser (http://bisque.yulab.org/). Source code is available in a public GitHub repository (https://
github.com/hyulab/B|SQUE).

1 Introduction

 

The proliferation of genomic and proteomic databases has helped us or-
ganize and understand biological molecules and phenomena, but has
left the scientific community using many different naming conventions
for the same, or intrinsically related biological entities: genes, proteins
and transcripts (Cunningham et al., 2015 ; Gray et al., 2015 ; Pruitt
et al., 2014; UniProt—Consortium, 2015). While there are many tools to
convert the identifiers themselves, there are insufficient resources to con-
vert loci and variants annotated in reference to these identifiers
(Supplementary Table S1). Due to pervasive sequencing and variant an-
notation, this has led to a routine burden on biologists to convert from

one naming convention to another, and may lead to errors when build-
ing upon other labs’ research (McCarthy et al., 2014).

Here we present BISQUE (The Biological Seggence Exchange),
a multi-interface utility for converting human genomic, tran-
scriptomic and proteomic loci and variants from their reported form
into forms useful for downstream research. BISQUE is an extensible
conversion framework deployed as a web server (http://bisque.
yulab.org) for user-friendly conversion among the most popular
human database identifiers. It is also available as a programmatic
web service, downloadable as a customizable standalone application

module.

2 Methods

BISQUE is designed to track the manifestation of variants in coding
regions of human biomolecules. It can trace genomic variants to
their effects in higher order molecules (transcripts and proteins) and,
conversely, discover the source of proteome aberrations in lower
order genomic sequences (genome and genes). As such, BISQUE
catalogues positions in molecules that are functional in their tran-
scription or translation across all catalogued molecular classes (gen-
ome/genes, transcripts and proteins). To further functional
discovery, BISQUE incorporates two peripheral databases for inves-
tigation, dbSNP (Sherry et al., 2001) and the PDB (Berman, 2000),
allowing users to quickly determine the relationships between
known genomic variants and their potential effects on protein
structures.

The nodes in the BISQUE core conversion graph (Fig. 1a) include
the latest human genome builds (GRCh37 and GRCh38) (Benson
et al., 2015), Ensembl gene, transcript and protein (Cunningham et al.,
2015 ), RefSeq transcript and protein (Pruitt et al., 2014), UniProt pro-
tein (UniProt—Consortium, 2015 ), dbSNP (Sherry et al., 2001) and the
PDB (Berman, 2000). The connections between these nodes in the
graph represent all potential traversals to produce conversions, begin-
ning at an origin node determined by user input and a destination node
based on a selection by the user. BISQUE then identifies the optimal
path through the conversion graph from the origin to the destination
based on the available edges (Supplementary Note 1.5). Conversions
are computed stepwise along this path as single conversions between
one input node and one output node. At each step, BISQUE first
checks if a mapping exists for the input identifier in the selected output
database. If a mapping exists, any associated loci and mutations will
be converted according to the rules that describe the edge and its direc-
tion between the nodes (Supplementary Note 1.6). For instance, when
converting from a genomic locus to a transcript locus, introns must be
removed, strand-sense (whether or not the transcript is on the
sense (+) or antisense (—) genomic DNA strand) must be taken into ac-
count, and variant bases complemented in a transcript annotated in

reference to the antisense strand. The output of each stepwise conver-
sion is fed as input to the next stepwise conversion. Figure 1b describes
an example conversion, showing the input and output of each step
required to convert from genomic variant to protein substitution.

3 Usage

BISQUE is available in several forms to increase its usability for a
variety of applications. For small queries (up to 1000 conversions at
a time), the web server is recommended. For larger queries and sys-
tematic integration, the web service or command-line application
may be more appropriate.

3.1 Web server

The BISQUE web server is both a frontend to the conversion engine
and a portal to learning more about available web functions and ac-
cessing BISQUE in its other forms (discussed below). Queries can be
submitted either one at a time or in batch (by pressing the ‘+’ but-
ton) through the interactive form on the home page. Batch queries
may be manually entered into a form or uploaded as a text file in a
variety of formats, including the Variant Call Format (VCF).
Conversion results are presented in a table which is exportable in
several popular formats including CSV, JSON and XML.

3.2 Web service

BISQUE also provides simple programmatic access to its conversion
engine through URL-based queries that produce tab-delimited, plain
text output. By passing query parameters through CGI fields, users
may rapidly access BISQUE’s conversion capabilities in their own
scripts (examples using both Python and Perl are provided on the
About page), or incorporate BISQUE conversions into publicly
available web servers and databases.

3.3 Command-line application

The BISQUE conversion engine is encapsulated in a separate, down-
loadable command-line application. Two versions of this tool are
available for download through the BISQUE web server—a lite and
a full version. The full version download includes all MySQL tables
required for mapping so that a user may install BISQUE without any

trons and non-coding exons (UTRs and alternatively spliced regions) and codon-aligns the result to match amino acids in UniProt proteins

tionality as the full version, but relies on an internet connection to
access data from the public BISQUE MySQL database.

The command-line application is open source, written in Python
and importable as a Python module, providing users with another
avenue to incorporate BISQUE into their scripts. This also gives
more advanced users the ability to modify BISQUE to meet their
own needs, for instance to expand the coverage of database identi-
fiers available for conversion by adding and removing edges and
nodes from the conversion graph. For most new databases this is
achievable through included utilities and documentation, and may
not require modifying the code.

4 Discussion

While there are some tools available to perform limited conversion
of positions and variants associated with database identifiers
(Supplementary Table 1), these often exist as coupled conversion-
analysis tools, which lack the all-to-all conversion capability of
BISQUE. Furthermore, variant conversion is typically coupled with
much more computationally expensive functions, such as variant an-
notation. What is lacking in these tools is modularity—a core design
principle of complex systems that allows functional components to
be repurposed for other tasks. BISQUE embraces modularity in its
own internal structure through a generalized conversion framework,
which enables the expansion of its conversion capability. BISQUE is
also a module itself, with the ability to perform multiple conversions

for a scripting task or to act as the conversion engine for a data-
base or analysis tool. In this way, BISQUE will be very valuable to
the scientific community as it publicizes vital biological
infrastructure.

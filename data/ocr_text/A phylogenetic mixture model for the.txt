ABSTRACT

Motivation: To understand the evolution of molecular function within
protein families, it is important to identify those amino acid residues
responsible for functional divergence; i.e. those sites in a protein
family that affect cofactor, protein or substrate binding preferences;
affinity; catalysis; flexibility; or folding. Type | functional divergence
(FD) results from changes in conservation (evolutionary rate) at a
site between protein subfamilies, whereas type II FD occurs when
there has been a shift in preferences for different amino acid
chemical properties. A variety of methods have been developed
for identifying both site types in protein subfamilies, both from
phylogenetic and information-theoretic angles. However, evaluation
of the performance of these methods has typically relied upon
a handful of reasonably well-characterized biological datasets or
analyses of a single biological example. While experimental validation
of many truly functionally divergent sites (true positives) can be
relatively straightforward, determining that particular sites do not
contribute to functional divergence (i.e. false positives and true
negatives) is much more difficult, resulting in noisy ‘gold standard’
examples.

Results: We describe a novel, phylogeny-based functional
divergence classifier, FunDi. Unlike previous approaches, FunDi uses
a unified mixture model-based approach to detect type | and type II
FD. To assess FunDi’s overall classification performance relative to
other methods, we introduce two methods for simulating functionally
divergent datasets. We find that the FunDi method performs better
than several other predictors over a wide variety of simulation
conditions.

1 INTRODUCTION

Functional divergence in proteins over evolutionary time includes
the processes of sub— and neo—functionalization after gene
duplication, as well as specialization or loss of functions of proteins
in distinct organismal lineages (Henikoff et al., 1997; Li, 1983).

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Two main patterns of functional divergence (FD) at the amino
acid residue level have been described in the literature and were
classiﬁed by Gu (1999, 2001) as Type I and Type II. In the case
of a protein family composed of two subgroups, Type I functional
divergence is characterized by greater conservation at a site in one
subfamily versus the other subfamily, indicating a difference in
evolutionary rate between them due to fewer selective constraints in
the more rapidly evolving group. For Type II, divergence sequence
conservation at a site is observed in both subfamilies, but with
a marked preference for different amino acids, generally with
very different physicochemical properties in each group. Accurate
prediction of (FD) residues, also known as ‘speciﬁcity determining
sites’ in the case where divergence changes the substrate that is
bound (Gerlt and Babbitt, 2000), leads to an enhanced understanding
of the mechanisms underlying functional diversiﬁcation.

Three main approaches have been used for the prediction of FD
protein residues that, in broad terms, can be classiﬁed as primarily
phylogenetic, information theoretic or biophysical. Phylogenetic
approaches such as evolutionary trace (Lichtarge et al., 1996),
DIVERGE (Gu, 1999, 2001; Gu and Vander Velden, 2002) and
various likelihood ratio test/rate shift based tests (Knudsen and
Miyamoto, 2001; Knudsen et al., 2003; Susko et al., 2002)
explicitly take into account a phylogenetic tree that describes
the evolutionary relationships among the sequences in the protein
family under consideration. In general, phylogenetic methods for FD
prediction correlate observed patterns of amino acid substitution at
a site in a multiple sequence alignment across subgroups within a
phylogenetic tree. Local conservation (i.e. within a subgroup on
a phylogenetic tree) relative to other sequences reﬂect probable
functional speciﬁcity of that subgroup if the degree of conservation
is large relative to the overall divergences of the sequences within
that subgroup. This general case can be extended to more rigorous
statistical models of functional divergence such as the type I
and type II speciﬁc prediction methods employed by DIVERGE
(Gu, 1999, 2001; Gu and Vander Velden, 2002).

In contrast, information—theoretic approaches do not generally
explicitly consider the relationship between sequences, only the
known or predicted divisions into functional subgroups and perhaps
some weighting based on overall sequence distances as in GroupSim
(Capra and Singh, 2008). These approaches contrast information—
theoretic measures of variation of site proﬁles within a subgroup
to those observed at a site across the whole multiple sequence
alignment. These proﬁles may most commonly be represented by
some information—theoretic measure of variability among residues

at a site such as the Jensen—Shannon Divergence (Lin, 1991),
Relative Entropy/Kullback—Leibler Divergence (Kullback and
Leibler, 1951), Sequence Harmony (Feenstra et al., 2007; Pirovano
et al., 2006) and/or simple Shannon Entropy.

Biophysical/structural methods may also include some measures
of sequence diversity/information content as above, with a greater
focus on the physicochemical properties of structurally conserved
residue positions. Active sites modeling and clustering (de Melo—
Minardi et al., 2010) compares proﬁles of structurally aligned and
modeled active sites to identify speciﬁcity—determining residues.
Surface map techniques have also been developed (Pawlowski and
Godzik, 2001; Sael et al., 2008) that compare properties such as
charge and hydrophobicity of surface proteins of two proteins.
Other methods have been used to predict the substrate speciﬁcity of
unknown family members in cases where annotation transfer from
paralogs (Caffrey et al., 2008) and the related task of identifying
functional sites (Capra et al., 2009; Sankararaman et al., 2010)
may not be adequate. No structural methods were evaluated as part
of this study due to the lack of adequate methods for simulating
evolutionary divergence in the context of protein structure.

Here, we introduce a new phylogeny—based method, called FunDi,
for detecting FD sites across a phylogenetic split in a protein
family tree. By explicitly modeling type I and type II functional
divergence using a mixture model, FunDi provides a maximum
likelihood phylogenetic framework to predict FD sites using speciﬁc
models of amino acid substitution. As an open framework for
functional divergence classiﬁcation, FunDi is easily extended to
accommodate the latest methods/programs for maximum likelihood—
based phylogenetic reconstruction and new, more accurate models
of amino acid substitution. We also evaluate whether a weighted
average of FunDi’s score and the Jensen—Shannon Divergence
scores of surrounding residues (Capra and Singh, 2008) improves
performance.

A number of well—characterized protein datasets have been
used for evaluations of the performance of some functional
divergence/speciﬁcity—determining classiﬁers (FD classiﬁers)
(Chakrabarti et al., 2007). One limitation of these biological
datasets is the difﬁculty in assigning the labels of ‘true negative’ or
‘false positive’ to sites that are not involved in functional divergence.
Thorough molecular characterization of every amino acid position
in a protein family is practically infeasible; requiring mutagenesis
and functional studies not only on a single representative sequence,
but also over the biological sequence diversity represented by the
protein family. While these biological datasets are unavoidably
‘noisy’ for testing the efﬁcacy of functional divergence predictors
for these reasons, their true positive sites are often well supported
with robust experimental validation. We evaluated the performance
of FunDi, and several other FD classiﬁers over 11 of these
biological datasets with two phylogenetically distinct subfamilies
each (Chakrabarti et al., 2007). In order to provide a more robust
estimate of performance on less noisy data, we also introduce two
alternative frameworks for simulating functional divergence. In
this framework, we examine the impact of taxon sampling and the
scale of branch lengths on the predictive performance of functional
divergence classiﬁers, because undersampling of phylogenetic
diversity (taxon sampling) and overall sequence divergence are two
well—known factors inﬂuencing the accuracy and error associated
with phylogenetic reconstructions (Susko et al., 2005; Zwickl and
Hillis, 2002). In the case of functional divergence, it seems likely

that undersampling of meaningful phylogenetic diversity can lead
to incorrect observations of substitution patterns and sequence
conservation levels (Blouin et al., 2005). By explicitly taking the
phylogeny of protein families into account with an appropriate
model of functional divergence, we expect improved predictive
performance relative to programs that do not use this information.

2 METHODS
2.1 FunDi

We assume that a given multiple sequence alignment is composed of
sites that fall into two classes, those contributing to functional divergence
and non—divergent sites. To capture the dynamics of the FD class, we
construct a two—component phylogenetic mixture model, where non—FD
sites evolve across a shared phylogenetic tree (standard evolutionary
model/dependent component), whereas FD sites are treated as being
evolutionarily ‘uncoupled’, evolve on independent subtrees (FD component).

Speciﬁcally, the dependent component models amino acid residues whose
evolutionary constraints remain similar across a single phylogenetic tree.
This is captured by a standard substitution model of protein evolution such
as JTT (Jones et 01., 1992), WAG (Whelan and Goldman, 2001) or LG
(Le and Gascuel, 2008) with rates across sites (RAS) modeled using a discrete
rate approximation to the gamma distribution.

During functional divergence, this ’standard’ model of evolution is
violated. Under type I functional divergence, a rate shift has occurred
(heterotachy) such that a site can no longer be adequately modeled by the
same rate category in different lineages of the tree. A similar argument
can be made for type II functional divergence where a site has undergone
a shift in the amino acid preferences across a phylogenetic tree. In both
cases, the normal assumption of a homogeneous substitution process across
lineages no longer holds. In order to capture functional divergence, we
introduce an ‘independent component’ approximation where sites in subtrees
are modeled as if they were completely independent observations. In the
maximum likelihood (ML) framework, model parameters such as the alpha
shape parameter, amino acid frequencies and branch lengths are allowed to
be independently optimized in each subgroup. The total likelihood of a site
under this simpliﬁed approximate FD model will therefore be the product
of the site likelihoods for each subgroup. Note that this is equivalent to
assuming that the length of the internal branchlength between the subtrees,
b, is effectively inﬁnite and approximates the period of rapid evolution that
immediately follows the changes in functional constraints at a site associated
with FD. For two subgroups, the likelihood of a site x under this independence
model is given by:

Lx=P(X1|T1)P(X2|T2) (1)
T1 and T 2 are the phylogenies and associated branch lengths for each of the
two subtrees while X1 and X2 are the data patterns in the two subgroups at
that site. In a mixture model context, the likelihood of a site is given as the
weighted sum of the dependent and FD components:

Lx = pP(X1 ,Xz | T, b) + (1 — p)(P(X1|T1)P(X2|T2)) (2)

where ,0 represents the optimized class weight parameter and T refers to
the entire phylogenetic tree comprised of T1 and T 2 linked by an internal
branch of length 19. The site likelihoods of each component are calculated
by standard ML phylogenetic estimation software using a supplied tree and
alignment along with subgroup assignments for taxa. The ,0 parameter is
optimized using a two—step grid search procedure to two decimal places of
precision.

While the observed FD site patterns in the two subtrees are not
expected to be completely independent (i.e. they retain a shared evolutionary
history/trajectory), approximating them as independent offers several
advantages. First, it allows for maximum ﬂexibility of ML model choice.
Any phylogenetic software tool that outputs site likelihoods can be used
as the back—end engine for likelihood calculations. Currently, FunDi can

Functionally divergent residues

 

accept site log—likelihood values from PUZZLE (Schmidt et al., 2002),
RAxML version 7.2.6 (Stamatakis, 2006), QmmRAxML (Wang et al., 2008)
or FastTree (Price et al., 2009, 2010). This ‘Plug—And—Play’ utility allows
FunDi to rapidly accommodate new, complex models of sequence evolution
as they are developed. In addition, by implementing FunDi as a mixture
model containing both independent and dependent components, the shared
evolutionary history of FD sites is not completely ignored. All sites will
be modeled with likelihood contributions from both components. It is the
relative contribution of the independent component, measured by the site—
wise posterior probability of the FD class, that serves as an estimator of the
FD character for a given site.

Here, the performance of FunDi using either the ‘base’ RAxML v.7.2.6
(called FunDi—RAxML) or QmmRAxML (called FunDi—QmmRAxML) is
evaluated. In brief, QmmRAxML is a mixture model of a user—deﬁned
number of rate matrix classes (Qi’s) each with an associated weight (w,)
that is optimized by ML. Here for each class i, we deﬁne entries of an
instantaneous rate matrix ij(i) =Rjknk(i) for all pairwise combinations of
amino acids k and j. Rjk is the standard amino acid exchangeability of amino
acid j for amino acid k from an exchangeability matrix (WAG in this case) and
the I'll-’s represent nine commonly occurring amino acid frequency proﬁles
estimated by Sjolander et al. (1996). The WAG database frequencies form
a 10th, catch—all, class. l'lk(i) is therefore the frequency of the amino acid
k in the frequency proﬁle class i. Under the FD model, this model has the
advantage that each subgroup can optimize toward different class (proﬁle)
preferences and rates, allowing for functional shifts at particular sites across
the split.

FunDi outputs the posterior probability of each site belonging to the FD,
class. FunDi can optionally be run with the ConsWin windowing method
(FunDi—ConsWin) as described in Capra and Singh (2008), which weights
site scores based on the Jensen—Shannon Divergence of surrounding amino
acid residues. The J ensen—Shannon divergence score for all sites is calculated
using a python script as detailed by Capra and Singh (2007). The average
Jensen—Shannon divergence score of a window of surrounding columns in
the alignment is then weighted and added to the posterior probability of
functional divergence:

S(FD)x = AP(FD)x + (1 — msnavg (3)

where S(FD)x is the functional divergence score at site x, A is the weight
for the posterior probability of functional divergence (P(FD)) at site x, and
JSDaVg is the average Jensen—Shannon Divergence score of the window.
Here we used the recommended optimal values (Capra and Singh, 2007)
of 0.7 for A and a window size of 3 to either side of the column under
consideration. This sliding—window scheme has been shown to improve
predictive performance both in the GroupSim method and with other
classiﬁers (Capra and Singh, 2008).

2.2 Simulations

We have implemented two simulation strategies for functional divergence
in order to evaluate the relative performance of various FD classiﬁers.
Alignments containing both FD and non—divergent (non—FD) sites were
simulated over a variety of tree topologies in order to provide a
comprehensive analysis of performance.

2.2.] Strategy I: site-speciﬁc amino acid proﬁles INDELible (Fletcher
and Yang, 2009) was used to simulate alignments consisting of both FD and
non—divergent sites using the 10—component QmmRAxML mixture model
described above. In order to conform to GroupSim assumptions, FD sites
were required to be located within windows of non—FD sites in the primary
amino acid sequence and all sites were selected, as described below, to have
speciﬁc Jensen—Shannon divergence score distributions. Distributions for
each site type were estimated from biological datasets that have been used
in previous studies (Chakrabarti et al., 2007), with ﬁve sets of distributions
used. Jensen—Shannon divergence scores were calculated for all FD sites,

sites located in a three residue windows on either side of an FD site, and all
other sites separately. This was done for all the two—family alignments used in
Chakrabarti et al. (2007). Four sets of the above estimates were used directly
while a ﬁfth set of score distributions was set to be of intermediate values
compared with the other four. The divergence score distributions for Window
and other non—FD sites in this set were equal to one another (Supplementary
Table Sl). One hundred random trees and corresponding alignments were
simulated under each of these ﬁve sets.

Phylogenetic trees: Random phylogenetic trees were generated using
INDELible with a birth—death (BD) process. Trees were randomly chosen to
have between 10 and 50 taxa. Birth, death and mutation rates were randomly
selected from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 while the sampling
parameter was constrained to a value of 1 [for details about the BD process
see Yang and Rannala ( 1997)]. For each of the ﬁve sets of J ensen—Shannon
divergence scores, one thousand individual trees were simulated and from
these 100 pairs were randomly selected and joined by a midpoint rooted
internal branch of length 1 expected substitution per site (0.5 on either side
of root). This represented 500 protein family trees undergoing functional
divergence across a central split.

Simulated alignments: Ten thousand non—FD sites were simulated from
a random ancestral root sequence under each of the 10 mixture model
components. Sites were then sampled from these sets randomly to construct
both the non—FD windows around divergent sites and the remainder of non—
FD sites in an alignment. To generate FD data, we simulated, from a shared
ancestral sequence, over each subtree independently with a zero internal
branchlength between the subtrees. Subtrees of non—FD sites were separated
by an internal branchlength of 1. For all site types, four discrete I‘ site—rate
categories were used based on an a—shape parameter of 0.5.

Type I FD sites (i.e. rate—shifted sites) were simulated using the standard
WAG model of evolution. Aroot sequence was sampled from the WAG model
frequencies and sequences for each subtree were simulated separately, with
the same root sequence to allow for independence of rates. The simulated
pool of sites was then ﬁltered to remove all columns where an identical
evolutionary rate was randomly assigned by INDELible.

For Type II FD sites, nine pairs of mixture model components were
selected from the mixture model such that amino acids with a high frequency
in one component of the pair will have a low frequency in the other and vice
versa. For each component pair, we simulated 10000 sites. Root sequences
were randomly sampled from each of the two amino acid distributions of
the components used. As for Type I sites, an alignment was simulated for
each subtree independently with the same ancestral sequence. To simulate
the effect of selection for differing physico—chemical properties, each branch
in the subtree was allowed to evolve according to the proportional model
(i.e. rates of interchange are proportional to the frequency of the target amino
acid, similar to the CAT—Poisson model of Lartillot and Philippe, 2004) using
pairs of the 10 component amino acid proﬁles selected as described above.
The resulting 90 000 simulated sites were combined into a single pool of
type II FD sites. To accentuate the differences between subtrees, type I and
type II simulated datasets were then ﬁltered to remove any columns where
the most prevalent amino acid in one subtree represented 30% or more of
sites in its counterpart. Alignment columns were also sampled from the type
I and type II pools to have appropriate Jensen—Shannon divergence score
distributions comparable to one of ﬁve biological datasets. To accomplish
this, all site types (Type I FD, Type II FD, non—FD) were simulated in excess
as described above and a subset was sampled so that proportions of J ensen—
Shannon divergence scores in a given subset roughly matched those of the
biological datasets. The ﬁnal alignments used were 400 residues in length,
40 of which were FD sites (20 Type I and 20 Type II). Each FD site was
given a window of three non—FD sites to either side in the ﬁnal alignment
to conform to the assumptions made by the GroupSim ConsWin (Capra and
Singh, 2008) method as described above.

Taxon sampling: To test the impact of taxon sampling on FD prediction, two
phylogenetic trees were chosen to represent best and worst case examples

based on the performance of FunDi relative to other classiﬁers. Taxa were
randomly re—sampled from these datasets in groups of 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 and
35 with the only constraint being that a minimum of four taxa were present in
each subgroup. Ten replicate samplings were conducted for each number of
taxa. A phylogenetic tree was then re—estimated from the data using RAxML
version 7.2.6 (Stamatakis, 2006) and predictions of functional divergence
made with each of the tested prediction methods.

Branch length scaling: The two tree topologies discussed above were again
used as best and worst cases to investigate the impact of branch lengths
on predictive performance of FD detection. For each of the two trees, the
branches in the subtrees were re—scaled by a factor of 0.5, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5 or
10, or the internal branch separating the two subtrees was set to a length of
1.5, 3, 5 or 10. A simulated dataset was generated as described above on
this new phylogenetic tree and evaluated using each of the chosen prediction
methods.

2.2.2 Strategy 11: deﬁned motifs The ‘evolutionary motif’ method in
Indel—Seq—Gen version 2 (Strope et al., 2007; 2009) was also used.
In brief, the sequence motifs of FD subsites from select datasets used
in prior performance evaluations (Chakrabarti et al., 2007; Chakrabarti and
Panchenko, 2009) were compiled for each of the two subgroups in a given
family (Supplementary Table S2).

FD sites were constrained to the motifs found in the biological datasets
selected as recommended by Strope et al. (2009). An ancestral character
state for FD sites in both subtrees was randomly selected and evolved
according to the differing motifs of the subtrees. As before, window
sites were constructed surrounding each FD residue, but in this case
were constrained to be 100% conserved in order to provide optimal
conditions for the ConsWin windowing method and GroupSim. Non—
FD sites for the remainder of the sequence length were simulated with
INDELible using the 10—component amino acid proﬁle mixture with WAG
exchangeabilities, 4 I‘ rate categories and an a shape parameter of 0.5
using the original tree from the protein family. Non—FD sites were simulated
under each of these 10 components, 25 sites per component for 250 non—FD
positions unconstrained in their conservation level. For each of the selected
biological datasets, 10 independent simulations were performed, to yield 70
simulated alignments over 7 different phylogenetic trees. This simulation
strategy allows true FD sites to be simulated based on known biologically
derived parameters/motifs while removing the serious problem, in biological
datasets, of undetected positives from being incorrectly labeled as negatives
(false negatives).

2.3 Testing divergence

For all programs, where appropriate, default values and raw scores were used
to produce ordered lists with sites labeled 0 or 1 according to whether they
were a truly FD ( 1) versus a non—FD (0) site. When necessary, raw scores
of programs were rescaled to be between 0 and 1, with high scores being
indicative of functional divergence (Supplementary Materials). To evaluate
overall performance receiver operator characteristic (ROC) and precision—
recall (PR) curves, as well as the total area under the curve for both curves
(AUC—PR and AUC—ROC), values were calculated using AUCCalculator 0.2
(Davis and Goadrich, 2006). The AUC values each yield a single relative
performance score for evaluation of the overall classiﬁcation performance;
the greater the AUC, the better the predictor averaged over all thresholds. An
AUC value =1 indicates perfect performance according to the criterion. We
also used the ‘average ranks’ evaluation method that averages the rank of
all true positive sites (ordered by decreasing FD score) in a tested dataset or
series of datasets (in this case all 500 or 70 datasets for a simulation method).
The lower the average rank, the better the performance of the method. AUC
values and calculated average ranks were then used to generate boxplots
using the R statistical package. All programs were evaluated over the larger
500 alignment and tree set (simulation set 1) and the smaller 70 alignment

set with motifs (simulation set 2) as well as a set of 11 biological datasets
(Chakrabarti et al., 2007).

3 RESULTS

We investigated and compared the performance of the FunDi
methods and several other methods for FD site prediction over
a range of tree topologies and sizes, identifying particular tree
topologies that may prove problematic for prediction of functional
divergence. The impact of taxon sampling (recovery of true
molecular diversity), length of the branch separating the subtrees
and overall tree length was also investigated in order to build a
robust picture of the behavior of the various functional divergence
prediction algorithms and their performance over phylogenetically
diverse data.

Several programs were selected based on their performance in
previous studies (Brandt et al., 2010; Capra and Singh, 2008;
Chakrabarti and Panchenko, 2009) as well as their ability to be used
in a large—scale testing pipeline. We tested the performance of our
own method, FunDi (using both QmmRAxML and RAxML for site
log—likelihood calculation), FunDi+ConsWin, SPEER (Chakrabarti
et al., 2007), GroupSim (Capra and Singh, 2008), Sequence
Harmony (Feenstra et al., 2007) and Multi—RELIEF (Ye et al.,
2008). Both Sequence Harmony and Multi—RELIEF were used
as implemented in Multi—Harmony (Brandt et al., 2010). These
programs represent the top—performing methods as determined
by prior studies and include both phylogenetic and information—
theoretic approaches. A likelihood ratio test method for FD detection
was also evaluated (Knudsen and Miyamoto, 2001; Knudsen et al.,
2003) on both the simulated and real biological datasets. However,
as it had poor performance in initial tests we did not do a complete
set of analyses (see Supplementary Materials).

Eleven two subfamily biological datasets were selected from
Chakrabarti et al. (2007) and performance was evaluated. The 11
datasets were selected with the requirement that each subfamily
had to be phylogenetically distinct and contain a minimum of four
taxa per subfamily. The datasets selected feature a broad range in
terms of number of taxa and number of FD sites. The performance
of most classiﬁers as measured by AUC—ROC was very similar,
with more variation seen in the AUC—PR metrics (Supplementary
Figure S1). Using the medians of the AUC—PR distribution to judge
the overall performance, GroupSim appeared to have the overall
best performance with FunDi—ConsWin and Multi—RELIEF as the
next best performers in the AUC—PR plots. Median performance as
measured by AUC—ROC is slightly higher on these 11 biological
datasets than that observed under either of the two simulation
conditions examined below, but not signiﬁcantly, except in the
case of SPEER in case of simulated dataset 2. We also compared
the performance of the Real—Value Evolutionary Trace (Mihalek
et al., 2004) and Difference—ET methods (Madabushi et al., 2004;
Raviscioni et al., 2006) here, but due to technical constraints were
unable to perform those evaluations on our larger simulated datasets.

In simulation Set 1 across all 500 datasets, the performances of
FunDi using either QmmRAxML or RAxML were highly similar,
outperforming all other methods tested as measured by the area
under the precision—recall curve (AUC—PR), the area under the
ROC curve (AUC—ROC) and the average rank of true positive
FD sites (Fig. 1). The program GroupSim (Capra and Singh,
2008) applies a simple windowing method (ConsWin) for adjusting

Higher values reﬂect increased performance with a maximum value of 1.0.
Additionally performance was characterized by the average rank of true

FD score of the program tested. All scores transformed (if required) to be
between 0 and 1 with high scores reﬂecting a better functional divergence
score. For average rank lower median values show increased performance.
The methods evaluated in all cases are FunDi with QmmRAxML, FunDi with

The 500 datasets were simulated with varying conditions over randomly
generated tree topologies.

scores of functional divergence based on neighboring residues
in the primary sequence (described previously). We applied this
same method to the posterior probabilities of functional divergence
P(FD) generated by FunDi with QmmRAxML to see if it yielded
an improvement and to ensure that our simulation settings were
appropriate for Group—Sim’s prediction strategy. FunDi+ConsWin
displayed an increase in predictive performance compared with
the non—windowed P(FD) scores alone (Fig. 1). GroupSim was
the next best classiﬁer after the three FunDi—based methods across
all datasets. Surprisingly given previous studies (Chakrabarti and
Panchenko, 2009), SPEER appeared to have the lowest performance
for all three scoring metrics. The distribution of AUC—PR values
for FunDi was signiﬁcantly different from the other predictors in
all pairwise comparisons by the Wilcoxon signed—rank test with a
Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (P <8.8e—16). All
other tests were also signiﬁcantly different from one another with
Bonferroni corrected P << 0.05.

3.1 The impact of phylogenetic tree shape and the
number of taxa

We also investigated performance of the classiﬁers as a function of
several common phylogenetic tree shape statistics. The clearest trend
indicated that performance was greatly inﬂuenced by normalized
tree length (i.e. overall sum of branch lengths divided by the number
of taxa) as shown in Figure 2. All programs that we examined
exhibited some increase in AUC—PR as the normalized tree length

increased; however, this trend was much stronger in the three
variations of FunDi tested. As the normalized tree length increases,
the performance gap between FunDi and the other prediction
programs increases, with the FunDi—based methods doing much
better in general at longer tree lengths. We also identiﬁed two
tree topologies with identical normalized tree lengths (NTL: 0.18)
where the performance of FunDi differs signiﬁcantly (Fig. 3). For the
tree in Figure 3A, FunDi performs poorly (AUC—PR = 0.33), whereas
in the tree in Figure 3B, it performs much better (AUC—PR = 0.51).
Curiously, the AUC—PR results under the poorly performing tree
are nearly indistinguishable from those of Group—Sim (second best
performing method overall), while there is a large difference in
AUC—PRs under the ‘high—performance’ tree. These two topologies
differ mainly in their tree shapes, with a large discrepancy between
the branch lengths in the subtrees. These two tree topologies are
best and worst case examples for FunDi and were selected for
further analyses on the effect of branch length and taxon sampling on
functional divergence prediction. While large discrepancies between
branch lengths of subtrees in datasets with functional divergence
is not uncommon, in this case a large branch length discrepancy is
compounded with relatively short branches throughout the tree when
compared with similar trees from 11 biological datasets examined
(Supplementary Table S3). This may explain why performance
increases so dramatically when branches in the subtrees are made
longer (see below).

3.2 The impact of taxon sampling

To test the effects of taxon sampling on functional divergence
prediction, random taxon subsets were created from the simulated
datasets from trees A and B in Figure 3. Results are shown
in Figure 4. For both trees, addition of more data in the form
of additional taxonomic coverage improved the performance of
FunDi (AUC—PR; AUC—ROC shown in Supplementary Figure S2)
relative to other tested methods, although the trend is much more
pronounced for tree B. On the other hand, information—theoretic
methods appear to be relatively insensitive to taxon sampling,
showing only moderate performance increases (or some apparent
decreases, e.g. Fig. 4B).

Fig. 3. Trees used for simulations that led to (A) poor performance of
FunDi (relative to other classiﬁers) and (B) good performance. These trees
were selected for further analyses of the impact of taxon sampling and
branch length rescaling as best and worst case examples of phylogenetic
tree shapes, balance and differences between subtrees. Both tree topologies
have an identical normalized tree length of 0.18. Performance of FunDi on
tree topology A (as measured by the area under the precision—recall curve)
was 0.33, while it was 0.51 for tree topology B.

3.3 The impact of branch length scaling

We also investigated the impact of branch lengths on performance
using trees A and B as examples. We present only the results for
AUC—PR as they showed the clearest trends. For both trees, either
the branch lengths in the subtrees or the internal branch length
separating the two subtrees were rescaled and for each case, a dataset
was simulated and tested. The branch length effect is dependent on
which branch is being rescaled (Fig. 5), as well as the given tree.
Increasing the internal branch (Fig. 5A and B) separating subtrees
results in a decrease in predictive performance for all classiﬁers
for tree B. For tree A, it is difﬁcult to discern a clear trend as
the performances of most classiﬁers do not change dramatically,
although at the longest branch length setting (10) all methods do
generally poorer than at shorter lengths. This general effect is
expected in terms of the performance of FunDi; as the internal
branch between subgroups increases, the whole tree becomes closer

measured by the area under the precision—recall curve (A and B) on tree
topologies A (A) and B (B) from Figure 3. For each tree 10 subsampled

and closer to the independence model, decreasing the distinction
(and separatability) of the two components of the mixture model.

In the case of varying branch lengths in subtrees (Fig. 5C and D),
AUC—PR clearly increases for all classiﬁers and on either tree as
the branch lengths are increased. The trend is most dramatic for
all three versions of FunDi relative to the other programs. As
each subtree is evolving under its own evolutionary model, longer
branches in subtrees provide additional time for substitutions that
allow discrimination between the two site types (FD versus non—FD)
to appear (if such a substitution did not occur along the internal
branch) and provide more information upon which a classiﬁcation
can be made. This may be particularly true for Type I functional
divergence as longer branches lead to more scrambling of the amino
acid states at that site in the subtree with relaxed selective pressures.
In tree A (the ‘poorly’ performing tree topology), we see rapid
increases in performance for the FunDi—based methods as branch
lengths increase.

3.4 Prediction of type I versus type II FD sites

We evaluated whether there were differences in the ability of
methods to predict Type I versus Type II FD sites. While
better performance is observed for Type II sites (Supplementary
Figure S3), the difference is not great as median values for AUC—PR
or AUC—ROC metrics for Type I or Type II sites fall within the other
site type’s interquartile range.

3.5 Performance with deﬁned evolutionary motifs

The functional divergence prediction programs were tested using
the same performance metrics on the 70 alignments from simulated
dataset 2, which used the ‘deﬁned evolutionary motifs’ simulation
strategy. Overall, the same general trends in relative performance are
observed. The median AUC—PR was highest for FunDi (RAxML,
QmmRAxML and QmmRAxML+ ConsWin) with GroupSim, the
next best performing prediction method (Fig. 6A). The large range

Fig. 5. Impact of branch length rescaling on internal (A and B) or subtree (C and D) branches as measured by the area under the precision—recall curve.
Rescaling was applied to both tree topologies A and B from Figure 3. Scaling factors are shown on the x—axis with AUC—PR scores on the y—axis. For each of
the two topologies rescaling was applied to the indicated branch length(s) and a random dataset simulated and performance of the tested functional divergence

classiﬁers assessed as described in Section 2.

of performance scores observed with the AUC—PR data can
best be explained by the varying performance on individual
motifs and phylogenetic tree shapes used (data not shown).
When evaluated using AUC—ROC, FunDi+ ConsWin was the best
performing prediction method, followed by GroupSim, then by
FunDi (QmmRAxML or RAxML) without the windowing method
(Fig. 6B). Performance of FunDi (AUC—PR values) is signiﬁcantly
different from other predictors as measured by the Wilcoxon signed—
rank test (P <2.65e—12). If non—FD windows that are more highly
conserved compared with the majority of non—FD sites do tend to be
located around FD sites, a windowing method such as ConsWin is
of clear beneﬁt, regardless of the testing methodology, as described
previously (Capra and Singh, 2008).

4 DISCUSSION

Although not dramatic, there is an apparent discrepancy between
the performance results for the 11 real datasets versus those of the
two simulation studies. GroupSim does best overall for the real
datasets with FunDi—based methods among the next best performers,
whereas in the two kinds of simulations, FunDi—based methods

(especially FunDi+ConsWin) typically outperform GroupSim and
other methods. The source of the discrepancy is not very clear, but
we would suggest that all the performance metrics are inherently
less trustable for the 11 real datasets because, for these, only the
true positive class of sites is known with certainty. As the relative
rank of performance of the various methods is similar over two
completely distinct functional divergence simulation settings and
multiple performance indicators, we believe that the simulation
results are more representative of the true performance properties of
the various methods.

While FunDi performs better overall, its predictive power,
as measured by precision—recall curves, remains relatively low
(although performance as measured by ROC curves appears quite
strong). This low predictive power is due to a variety of factors.
Even under our simulation conditions, some functional shifts may
result in relatively subtle amino acid substitutions, especially in
complex situations that are an apparent mix of type I and type II
functional divergence types, or what have been termed ‘Marginally
Conserved’ sites. It is these marginally conserved sites that prove to
be the most difﬁcult in terms of prediction (Chakrabarti et al., 2007).
In addition, the majority of existing approaches essentially search

Fig. 6. Boxplots of performance of functional divergence classiﬁers on 70
datasets simulated with deﬁned motifs using Indel—Seq—Gen—v2 as measured
by area under the precision—recall (A) and receiver operator characteristic
(B) curves as well as the average rank (C). The 70 simulated datasets are
simulated with 10 replicates over each of 7 tree topologies (and with deﬁned
motifs) from real biological datasets from Chakrabarti et al. (2007 and 2009).

for particular patterns of amino acid usage, patterns which can arise
in an evolutionary context due simply to stochastic neutral changes
over the underlying phylogeny of the protein family without any
functional shift occurring, making adjustments for the underlying
phylogeny of great importance. FunDi can also leverage improved
models of amino acid evolution, such as the 10 component amino
acid proﬁle mixture models implemented in QmmRAxML (Wang
et al., 2008) using WAG (used in this study), JTT, LG or user—
supplied exchangeabilities. Judicious model selection allows the
incorporation of some prior knowledge of the protein’s evolutionary
history, structure, function and amino acid frequencies.

We have also introduced two new simulation strategies for
functional divergence that are useful for benchmarking new
prediction programs, and improving existing ones, especially in
phylogenetic ‘trouble spots’ (e.g. worst case tree used in our
analyses of the impact of branch lengths and taxon sampling).
Unfortunately, we were unable to compare our results with some
of the other phylogenetically based methods such as DIVERGE
(Gu, 1999; 2001; Gu and Vander Velden, 2002), because the
software implementation and run times of the latter precluded
analyses of large simulated datasets. Furthermore, the Gu 2001—
based predictions could not be obtained for several of the biological
datasets examined. Since FunDi is: (i) scalable to the analysis of
multiple (potentially thousands) of large protein datasets; (ii) has
a single coherent framework for the prediction of type I and type
II FD sites; and (iii) can be used with any phylogenetic model of
protein evolution implemented in a maximum likelihood framework,
it has distinct advantages as compared with other phylogenetic—based
functional divergence predictors currently in use.

Our analysis on a large, phylogenetically diverse set of simulated
FD datasets shows that taking into account the phylogeny of a protein
family is an important part of the prediction of FD sites. While

non—phylogenetically aware prediction schemes such as GroupSim
can be characterized as insensitive to issues of taxon sampling and
phylogenetic tree topologies, they also do not increase in predictive
accuracy under appropriate phylogenetic conditions and show
generally poorer performance under a wide range of conditions.
FunDi, as a phylogenetically aware prediction program, shows
marked improvement in the quality of its predictions under increased
taxon sampling (recovery of true biological diversity) as well as
increased evolutionary time as measured by the normalized tree
length and illustrated in our branch length rescaling experiments.

The main problem with using real biological data to evaluate the
performance of functional divergence methods is the infeasibility of
experimentally testing false and true negative prediction; there are
simply too many sites and too many character state combinations
to test comprehensively. The two simulation strategies described
here therefore provide much cleaner data, with less noise than true
biological data and so can be used to evaluate the performance
of functional divergence methods over a wide range of possible
evolutionary conditions such as tree topologies and taxon sampling.
The ability to specify particular sequence motifs for FD residues
based on observed biological data, as we have done here in the
second set of simulations, may be useful in developing methods
that have better performance on difﬁcult—to—classify functionally
divergent residues.

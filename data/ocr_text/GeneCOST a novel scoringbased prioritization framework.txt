Abstract

Summary: Due to the big data produced by next-generation sequencing studies, there is an evident
need for methods to extract the valuable information gathered from these experiments. In this
work, we propose GeneCOST, a novel scoring-based method to evaluate every gene for their dis-
ease association. Without any prior filtering and any prior knowledge, we assign a disease likeli-
hood score to each gene in correspondence with their variations. Then, we rank all genes based on
frequency, conservation, pedigree and detailed variation information to find out the causative rea-
son of the disease state. We demonstrate the usage of GeneCOST with public and real life
Mendelian disease cases including recessive, dominant, compound heterozygous and sporadic
models. As a result, we were able to identify causative reason behind the disease state in top rank-
ings of our list, proving that this novel prioritization framework provides a powerful environment
for the analysis in genetic disease studies alternative to filtering-based approaches.

1 Introduction

The progress in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies
have led to an increased usage of whole exome and whole genome
sequencing in medicine. The practice of high-throughput methods in
identifying disease causing genes is becoming more prevalent with
the aim of exploring the unresolved Mendelian diseases. Hence,
there is still a need for effective tools to analyze the big data coming
out of sequencing experiments.

An important step in extracting information from huge amount
of data produced by high-throughput technologies is ‘variant priori-
tization’. Variety of tools have been proposed in the literature for
identifying the causative reason behind Mendelian diseases such as
BierApp (Aleman et al., 2014), Privar (Zhang et al., 2013),
Mendelscan (Koboldt et al., 2014), KggSeq (Li et al., 2012) and
eXtasy (Sifrim et al., 2013).

Most of these methods actually rely on tight filtering approach
to reduce the number of variants. However, NGS technology is
prone to errors at many steps such as optical reading and alignment.
Therefore, filtering-based approaches have the possibility of missing
the real causative reason behind the disease state. Additionally,
some of the programs are web based and require the uploading of
the variant file to the program owners’ server which may
compromise the privacy of the individuals. Furthermore, most of the
programs can only operate on a single individual’s data hence they
are not able to use the whole information coming from the pedigree.

In this study, we propose a novel scoring-based approach for
evaluating disease causing genes. Unlike any other method,
GeneCOST focuses on genes instead of single variations. Hence, if
several different mutations in a single gene are causing the same
disease which is observed at sporadic cases, GeneCOST would

perfectly identify that gene as well. By adopting a scoring-based
approach we aim to overcome the problems coming with the quality
of the data. Thus, we show in our work that GeneCOST is superior
to other prioritization tools no matter the data is faulty or not.
Moreover, GeneCOST has a wider range of applicability than any
other existing methods since it can make use of the pedigree
information. It can accept multiple affected and healthy individuals’
information, which is crucial for sporadic cases. Our method works
ofﬂine on personal computers and users are not obliged to upload
the vcf file to our servers which carries sensitive information.
Additionally, GeneCOST does not require any prior knowledge of
the disease such as phenotype information and can be easily applied
using the command line.

2 Methods

When disease model is defined for a certain disease, GeneCOST
evaluates each gene and ranks the genes according to their costs
(likelihood scores) with the aim of finding disease causing gene
among the first few candidates. For this purpose, we have validated
GeneCOST for all disease models; sporadic, recessive, dominant and
compound heterozygous.

2.1 Annotation

Our environment involves an annotation tool which takes the result
of GATK genotyping as input and outputs an annotated vcf file
which makes the vcf file suitable for GeneCOST execution. Details
are provided in the Supplementary File.

2.2 Cost function
The disease likelihood score (cost function) in GeneCOST is defined
to have a robust structure so that it can be applied to any kind of
data.

The Cost function considers following parameters:

1. Minor Allele Frequency: frequency value taken from 1000
Genome and ESP65 00, takes a value between 0 and 1,

2. Segmental Duplication Information: takes a value between 0
and 1,

3. Mutation Rankscore: 11 prediction algorithms are retrieved
from deSFNP, a value between 0 and 3,

4. Mutation Type: a value between 2 and 3 depending on mutation
severity considering type of the mutation (single nucleotide poly-
morphism, frameshift, splice, etc. . . ),

5. PhastCons: considers the Conservation Score of the region of the
variant: a value between 0 and 1,

6. Pedigree Information,

7. Sequencing Quality of a Variant.

The details of the cost function and general workﬂow of GeneCOST
are explained in more detail at the Supplementary Section.

GeneCOST is implemented in C# and performs well with 64-bit
structure. The program can easily be executed using personal
Windows PCs. It requires a memory of 1.5 times of the vcf file and
has also the ability to work with large vcf files where some of the
previously proposed tools fail to accomplish.

3 Data and results

As current programs either only support single patient information
or do not have the capability to work with our vcf files due to vari-
ous reasons explained in Supplementary Section, we have compared

our method with other available methods by applying sample files
of eXtasy (Supplementary Table S3). Furthermore, we have proved
applicability of our program for eleven different cases including
both public and in-house (real-life) data.

1. Disease causing mutations for Miller Syndrome embedded to
publicly available Corpas family vcf ﬁle for all disease models
(Biesecker, 2010).

2. Publicly available Pigo.vcf ﬁle is used for the compound
heterozygous case of hyperphosphatasia with mental retardation
(Krawitz et al., 2012).

3. Family with Klippel—Feil Syndrome (Bayrakli et al., 2013).

4. Family with X-linked Renpenning syndrome.

5. Three family cases with autosomal recessive cerebrofaciothora-
cic dysplasia (Alanay et al., 2014).

6. Single individual with non-ketotic hyperglycinemia.

Related pedigree information for these studies and evaluation of our
program with respect to identifying disease causing gene is
presented in the Supplementary Section (Supplementary Table S4).

As a result, for the cases with high sequencing quality,
GeneCOST perfectly identified the causative reason behind the
disease state at the first ranking of the candidate list. Even though
when the read quality is low as in the case of Inhouse6 dataset and
the expected variation was not observed in one of the samples,
GeneCOST has successfully identified the causative reason at the
10th ranking, which would not be possible with any kind of filtering
method.

GeneCOST has major advantages over existing programs. It
supports pedigree information and multiple patient cases. The
program does not require any prior knowledge of the disease, hence it
can be used to identify novel genes. The disease likelihood score is cal-
culated on a gene level approach, therefore, GeneCOST provides a
valuable tool for sporadic cases where the patients do not have any
kinship relation. Finally, the proposed method does not rely on any fil-
tering procedure, hence, it is more robust to NGS-related errors which
has not been observed at any other programs. Moreover, to the best
of our knowledge, GeneCOST has been tested against a widest range
of Mendelian diseases compared with other prioritization tools. We
have demonstrated the usage of GeneCOST with artificial and real
data over a number of Mendelian diseases from different inheritance
models. Overall, GeneCOST is a powerful prioritization tool offering
a strong alternative to filtering-based tools.

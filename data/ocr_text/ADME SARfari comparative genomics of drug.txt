Abstract

Motivation: ADME SARfari is a freely available web resource that enables comparative analyses of
drug-disposition genes. It does so by integrating a number of publicly available data sources, which
have subsequently been used to build data mining services, predictive tools and visualizations for
drug metabolism researchers. The data include the interactions of small molecules with ADME (ab-
sorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) proteins responsible for the metabolism and trans-
port of molecules; available pharmacokinetic (PK) data; protein sequences of ADME-related molecu-
lar targets for pre-clinical model species and human; alignments of the orthologues including
information on known SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) and information on the tissue distri-
bution of these proteins. In addition, in silico models have been developed, which enable users to
predict which ADME relevant protein targets a novel compound is likely to interact with.

1 Introduction

The aim of drug discovery is to design and deliver a potential thera-
peutic agent, not only efficacious for the chosen disease but also
with an acceptable dosage and safety profile. It is important to
understand how a drug’s disposition and its interaction with drug-
metabolizing enzymes and transporters in pre-clinical species are
likely to translate to humans. This could contribute to a more
refined means of predicting human systemic exposure and any
adverse events such as drug—drug interactions or tissue-specific
toxicities arising from the species-specific disposition of the drug
molecule and/or its metabolites.

There are a large number of examples where expensive clinical
drug development programs had to be terminated due to an
unfavourable PK profile. For example, in the literature, there is
evidence on several drug candidates that are metabolized by

aldehyde oxidase (AOX1) (e.g. Austin et al., 2001, Hutzler et al.,
2013) where large species differences in gene structure and
regulation have led to wide variance of exposure (and consequently
efficacy and safety) between species.

Currently, identifying and integrating ADME (absorption, distri-
bution, metabolism and excretion) -related data in a consistent way
to aid species PK investigations is not a trivial process. For this
reason, we have developed a new computational system called
ADME SARfari, which integrates, genetic, proteomic, phenotypic
and molecule interaction data and offers the potential of becoming a
resource for community ADME data exchange and re-use. The pri-
mary data source for interaction and pharmacokinetic (PK) data is
the ChEMBL database (Bento et al., 2014). To broaden the scope
and analytical power of ADME SARfari, we have included data
from resources such as PharmaADME (http://www.pharmaadme.

org), Ensembl (Flicek et al., 2014) and the Human Protein Atlas
(Uhlen et al., 2010). To access the data, a freely accessible web inter-
face has been developed, which presents users with a summary of
ADME and PK data related to protein targets and compounds
relevant to their specific field of research.

2 Methods

2.1 Data collection

The PharmaADME core and extended gene lists were used as the
primary source for the list of ADME-related genes. Further process-
ing of the ADME gene list, which included the removal of pseudo-
genes and duplicates and the inclusion of additional ADME-related
genes, resulted in a final list of 303 human ADME genes. An auto-
mated process using the EnsemblCompara API (Vilella et al., 2009)
added orthologous genes from model organisms to the list. The final
collection of ADME genes was mapped to the ChEMBL database,
which allowed the ADME-related bioactivity and compound data to
be extracted.

The orthologue mapping was extended to include a mapping be-
tween the predicted protein sequences found within the Sus scrofa,
Goettingen minipig and the Cam's familiaris beagle genomes
(Vamathevan et al., 2013). The reason for including these relatively
new specific genomes is their popularity in preclinical toxicology
studies and known intra-strain variation of PK (Bode et al., 2010).

The Human Protein Atlas resource was used as the reference
source of protein expression levels in various human cell types and
tissues.

2.2 Model building and validation

In an attempt to bridge the chemistry/biology/ADME space, predict-
ive models for suitable ADME genes were generated and validated.
When given a chemical structure as input, these models return a
ranked list of likely ADME targets based on the structural similarity
to other compounds and activity trends within ADME SARfari. This
is described in more detail in the Supplementary Information S1.

2.3 Database and interface

The data described in Section 2.1 was loaded into an Oracle 11g
database, where it was then further enriched. One such example of
the data enrichment is the generation of multiple sequence align-
ments of the groups of orthologues. Access to the data is provided
via a Web-based application, which provides users with a client-side
feature-rich interface. Much of the functionality the web application
relies upon is built into a series of RESTful web services.

3 Results

The ADME SARfari interface presents the user with a series of sec-
tions, which correspond to the different datasets parsed and loaded
into the ADME SARfari system. The different sections are
Homepage, Orthologues, Tissues, Bioactivz'tz'es, Molecules,
Pharmacokinetics and About. As well as being able to generate com-
plex workflows, which can help answer ADME-related questions,
the user is free to browse and export data from the system’s various
sections, without needing to run a pre-emptive search.

3.1 Workflows and research competency questions
To outline the functionality offered by the ADME SARfari system, a
sequence of industry-focused ADME research scenarios and their

corresponding ADME SARfari workflows are shown in
Supplementary Table S1.

3.2 Orthologue summary

The orthologue summary page (see Supplementary Fig. S1B) pre-
sents a tabular overview of all ADME-related genes. Each cell within
the first column of the table corresponds to the unique set of human
proteins and the subsequent columns contain proteins from poten-
tial model organisms. This results in each row of the table represent-
ing a set of orthologues. The page provides a number of data
manipulation tools including options to filter, sort and toggle the
display of columns. The orthologue summary page also presents the
user with search context-specific colouring. For example, if a user
conducts a BLAST search, they will be directed to the orthologue
summary page and only rows that contain at least one BLAST ‘hit’
are returned (a hit is defined as any ADME protein sequence, which
shares sequence identity >35 % to the user submitted query). To
help interpret the BLAST results, each protein target ‘lozenge’ is col-
oured using a dark to light-green colouring scheme, where darker
shades of green indicate higher sequence identity to the user query.
Similarly, when a user conducts a model prediction-based search,
only rows that contain at least one gene product predicted to inter-
act with user submitted smaller molecule are returned. The model
prediction hits can be identified as those protein target ‘lozenges’
that are coloured green.

3.3 ADME target prediction model

The target prediction model (Supplementary Information S1) is
exposed to end users via the web interface. The service allows users
to draw molecules using the ChemAxon Marvin JS chemical
sketcher (https://www.chemaxon.com/products/marvin/marvin-j s/)
or upload structures, which can then be submitted to the predictive
model. The results of the search are displayed in the Orthologue
summary page. Here, the top 10 targets predicted to interact with
user-submitted molecule are highlighted in green.

3.4 Pharmacokinetic summary

To provide a cross-species comparison of PK measurements, the
Pharmacokinetic summary page was created (see Supplementary
Fig. SlC). This allows a user to compare normalized PK measure-
ment values [clearance (CL), maximum plasma concentration
(Cmax), bioavailability (F), plasma half life (Tl/2), time for maximum
plasma concentration (Tmax) and volume of distribution (Vd)]. This
is carried out by binning the PK measurement values into low (dark
red), medium (red) and high (light red) ranges. Associating each
range with a colour allows a user to visually compare inter-species
PK measurements.

4 Further work

The ADME SARfari system is a novel and completely open web-
based tool, aimed to assist researchers working on translational
ADME studies. Future technical improvements include automating
access, by exposing the underlying RESTful Application
Programming Interface. This will allow developers and users famil-
iar with workflow tools, such as KNIME and Pipeline Pilot, to reuse
these components and extend the Use Cases defined in
Supplementary Table S1.

We see the system as a tool to assist users in the selection and
design of costly preclinical ADME/PK assays and subsequent inter-
preting the results of these assays. An underlying constraint imposed

on the system is the dependence on published ADME data. To help
enhance all actual (e.g. orthologue mappings, tissue expression lev-
els), predicted (e.g. ADME protein interaction models) and inferred
(e.g. cross-species PK comparison) results produced by the system,
the subsequent direction is to identify additional sources of ADME
data. We, therefore, encourage the ADME research community to
contact us and consider depositing their datasets into ADME
SARfari and/or the ChEMBL database.

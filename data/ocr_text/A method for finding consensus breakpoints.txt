ABSTRACT

Motivation: Recurrent DNA breakpoints in cancer genomes indicate
the presence of critical functional elements for tumor development.
Identifying them can help determine new therapeutic targets. High-
dimensional DNA microarray experiments like arrayCGH afford the
identification of DNA copy number breakpoints with high precision,
offering a solid basis for computational estimation of recurrent break-
point locations.

Results: We introduce a method for identification of recurrent break-
points (consensus breakpoints) from copy number aberration data-
sets. The method is based on weighted kernel counting of
breakpoints around genomic locations. Counts larger than expected
by chance are considered significant. We show that the consensus
breakpoints facilitate consensus segmentation of the samples. We
apply our method to three arrayCGH datasets and show that by
using consensus segmentation we achieve significant dimension
reduction, which is useful for the task of prediction of tumor phenotype
based on copy number data. We use our approach for classification of
neuroblastoma tumors from different age groups and confirm the
recent recommendation for the choice of age cut-off for differential
treatment of 18 months. We also investigate the (epi)genetic properties
at consensus breakpoint locations for seven datasets and show
enrichment in overlap with important functional genomic regions.

1 INTRODUCTION

DNA breaks occur often during cell replication and are espe-
cially dangerous if the DNA repair mechanisms do not succeed
in restoring the damaged locus correctly. Erroneous DNA repair
events can disrupt essential mechanisms that maintain the integ-
rity of the cell and, on rare occasions, can cause the cell to
become cancerous. Insertions, deletions, ampliﬁcations, trans-
locations and inversions are types of DNA structural damage

frequently observed in cancer genomes that occur as a conse-
quence of unrepaired DNA breaks.

Tumor genomes exhibit hundreds of DNA breakpoints. Some
of them promote tumor development by disrupting crucial func-
tional elements, and thus survive the selective pressure that
acts on cancer cells. These breakpoints tend to recur in tumors
of the same type, suggesting common progression mechanisms.
Other breakpoints may have no or less effect on tumor progres-
sion, e.g. the contribution of non-recurrent breakpoints that
appear at arbitrary locations in the genome is difﬁcult to evalu-
ate. Identifying relevant breakpoint hotspots and characterizing
their inﬂuence on tumor phenotype can help to identify molecu-
lar factors responsible for tumor progression and thus to develop
new therapeutic strategies.

Very high-resolution microarray technologies for genome-
wide measurement of copy number alterations, such as
arrayCGH (Pinkel et al., 1998; Solinas-Toldo et al., 1997) or
SNP arrays (Sherry et al., 2001) can reveal DNA breakpoints
related to copy-number changes in cancer genomes. The reso-
lution of microarray-based technologies can be very high, with
the distance between probes being as little as 2—3 kb, facilitating
sufﬁciently accurate estimation of the location of a DNA break-
point. The estimation is carried out by performant segmentation
algorithms, such as CBS (Olshen et al., 2004; Venkatraman and
Olshen, 2007). Presently, large collections of high-resolution
arrayCGH data are publicly available at the Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO, http://www.ncbi.nhn.nih.gov/geo/), The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA, http://cancergenome.nih.gov/) and other
repositories, for many types of cancer.

In this article, we introduce an algorithm for identifying recur-
rent breakpoints (or consensus breakpoints) in tumor cohorts,
based on DNA copy number aberration data. The approach is
called Consensus breakpoints by Kernel Smoothing (C-KS, pro-
nounce as ‘seeks’). C-KS identiﬁes genomic locations around
which breakpoints tend to accumulate more frequently than
expected by chance and assigns to each a signiﬁcance Z—score.
The input of our algorithm consists of the locations of break-
points of all tumors in the cohort; therefore, the computational
running time is independent of the resolution of the experimental
assays that produced the data.

In Ritz et al. (2011), a competing approach for identifying
breakpoint hotspots called Neighborhood Breakpoint
Conservation (NBC) is presented. NBC is applied directly to

the raw log-ratios of arrayCGH experiments. The authors devise
a special single-array segmentation algorithm, which assigns to
each pair of adjacent probes a probability of a breakpoint occur-
ring between them. Then, locations of recurrent breakpoints are
analytically estimated and sorted by signiﬁcance (P—value). NBC
has two main shortcomings. First, the segmentation models are
based on parametric assumptions that are speciﬁc to arrayCGH
data and, therefore, not applicable to next-generation sequen-
cing. Second, the complexity of the NBC algorithm is high, the
segmentation step using a dynamic program that requires quad-
ratic runtime in the number of array probes. Therefore, NBC
does not scale well to the most recent microarray platforms, such
as Agilent IM or Affymetrix SNP 6.0.

By identifying consensus breakpoints, our approach can
afford consensus segmentation of a set of cancer genomes,
which is a generalization of the single-sample segmentation
procedure. We assume that between two consecutive consensus
breakpoints, each tumor has constant copy number, given, for
example, by the average log-ratio (in the case of microarrays).
We call these regions consensus regions.

To validate the C-KS algorithm, we use the consensus regions
as super-features in classiﬁcation tasks that predict some binary
indicator of tumor phenotype. We applied our method to seven
arrayCGH datasets from ﬁve cancer types with various pheno-
typical annotations. We show that in comparison with models
trained on probe data, the accuracy of the classiﬁcation models
using the consensus regions is comparable and sometimes higher.
Hence, disregarding all breakpoints that are not consensus
breakpoints does not adversely impact the predictive power of
the model. We also show that consensus segmentation affords
substantial dimension reduction of the sample data without
signiﬁcant loss of information.

Moreover, we present an important biological ﬁnding that arose
from our classiﬁcation models using C-KS segmentation.
Speciﬁcally, the tumor genomes of neuroblastoma patients of
different age groups are most distinct when the age grouping
is deﬁned as ‘<18 months’ against ‘>18 months’. Our ﬁnding
has potential impact on differential therapy of neuroblastoma
patients, which are currently divided into two prognostic groups:
<12 months at diagnosis (good prognosis) and older (poor prog-
nosis). Our result is also supported by other studies (Evans and
D’Angio, 2005; London et al., 2005; Schmidt et al., 2005).

For a qualitative validation of the C-KS algorithm, we
investigate genomic and epigenomic properties of the genomic
locations corresponding to consensus breakpoints and show that
they tend to be enriched in functional elements and certain DNA
sequence patterns. These associations are interesting and deserve
further biological investigation.

2 METHODS

Given are N samples (tumors) and corresponding copy number measure-
ments at p loci, in the form of the logarithm of the ratio between the
tumor copy number and the normal copy number (log-ratios). We
assume that the samples have been segmented using some procedure
that identiﬁes breakpoints and reports segments of constant copy
number between them, without calling gains and losses. Examples of
such procedures include CBS (Olshen et al., 2004) and GLAD (Hupé
et al., 2004). As a consequence, the log-ratio sequence of each sample

can be partitioned into a sequence of intervals of constant copy number.
A breakpoint in this context is deﬁned as the genomic location that marks
the boundary between two adjacent intervals of distinct copy number in
one particular sample.

Let V be the set of breakpoints observed in the N arrays, represented as
triples as V: {(v,,s,,w,)| 1 5 is I}, where T is the total number of
breakpoints, v,- is the genomic location of the ith breakpoint, s,- is the
index of the sample on which the ith breakpoint was observed,
s,- e {1, ..., N} and w,- is the difference in copy number at breakpoint v,-
(from right to left) and it is called its weight. The weight w,- can be nega-
tive or positive, depending on whether the copy number decreases or
increases, respectively. The start position of each chromosome is con-
sidered a natural breakpoint for each sample, and it is a member of V.
Because at the start of the chromosome, there is no proper copy number
change, the weight of this breakpoint is considered zero.

In this manuscript, we say that a genomic location B is a consensus
breakpoint if around location B, more breakpoints occur in the set of
samples than expected by chance.

2.1 Algorithm C-KS

We present an approach called C-KS (consensus breakpoints via kernel
smoothing) for identifying consensus breakpoints in the set of N samples.
C-KS uses a kernel smoothing technique for identifying genomic loca-
tions around which unexpectedly large accumulations of breakpoints
occur. By sliding a location pointer along the genomic sequence, we
observe the breakpoints located within the vicinity of the current location
and estimate the likelihood of this observation under a null model
(Z—score). The null model assumes that the locations of the breakpoints
of each array are uniformly distributed along the genomic sequence and
do not depend on the array. The locations at which the estimated Z—score
is large enough are reported as candidates for consensus breakpoints.

Formally, let x be a location on the genome and IC(-; 11,0) be a
Gaussian kernel with mean u and standard deviation o>0. We deﬁne
the score function 1‘ as F(x; 0) = 1 | w,- | [C(vi; x,o). 1‘ quantiﬁes the
abundance of breakpoints around location x. The size of the neighbor-
hood is controlled by the standard deviation of the kernel, 0. The absolute
values of the weights w,- increase the contribution of large changes in log-
ratio and reduce the contribution of small changes. Consequently, a high
F(x, 0) score is attained either by the contribution of many breakpoints of
low-weight around location x or by few breakpoints of large weight.
Weights also decrease the inﬂuence of small log-ratio changes, which are
wrongly classiﬁed as breakpoints by the segmentation procedure.

1‘ assigns a score to each genomic position (in practice, only locations
{v,-| 1 5 i 5 I} are scored). Local maxima of P, which are signiﬁcantly
large, are candidates for consensus breakpoints. The parameter a (kernel
width) of 1‘ speciﬁes how ‘tightly’ the breakpoints should align to be
considered to form a consensus breakpoint. Based on the observation
that in real data, breakpoints aggregate in varying degrees of tightness,
we apply the scoring function multiply, with different kernel width
values. In our experiments, kernel widths can take values from the set
SD = {103,104, ...,108}.

Let the kernel width 0 be ﬁxed. To identify the local maxima of I‘(- ; a)
that are statistically signiﬁcant, we compare a local-maximum score to a
null reference, which is obtained by randomly re-arranging the break-
points, such that the dependencies between arrays and the dependence
on the genomic locations are destroyed. The random re-arrangement is
carried out as follows: for each array independently, its breakpoints
are re-located to random genomic positions, which are generated by a
uniform distribution over the entire chromosome. After all arrays have
been processed, a null instance of the consensus breakpoint detection
problem is generated, of the same size as the initial problem. Let
V0 = {(v?,s,-,w,~)| 1 5 is T} be the null instance. The I‘(- ; a) score is
computed at the null locations {v9 | 1 5 i 5 I}. This procedure is repeated
P times (P: 50 in our experiments), enough for obtaining a large

population of null scores covering the chromosome. After appropriate
sorting and re—indexing of the P sets of null genomic locations,
let 12(1), ...,ng be the genomic locations at which the null scores
y?, . . . , ygT have been estimated.

The signiﬁcance of the observed score at location x for kernel width 0
is given by a Z—score as follows:

F(x; 0) — mean {1411, ..., y?+j|v?+1, ..., v?+j arej NN of x}

sd{yl.0+1, 

 

z(x,o) = .
, yf+j|v?+1, ..., 129+]. are] NN of x}

(1)

where NN stands for nearest-neighbor. The Z—score indicates how large
is the observed score at a certain location x, measured in standard devi-
ations from the mean of the null scores at j NN locations around x.
In our experiments, the value of j is 50. Locations with Z—score below
some positive threshold {>0 are considered not signiﬁcant. The C-KS
algorithm returns a list of local maxima of the scoring function I‘ with
positive Z—scores, sorted decreasineg by Z—scores.

Supplementary Figure S1 from the Supplementary Material illustrates
the C-KS algorithm.

In this manuscript, we call consensus regions the genomic intervals
between two consecutive consensus breakpoints.

2.2 Validation of C-KS algorithm

In the absence of a benchmark of annotated consensus breakpoints, we
suggest two approaches for validating the C-KS algorithm. One approach
is qualitative, investigating key genomic and epigenomic properties of the
locations at which we report consensus breakpoints (see Section 4.2). A
second approach is quantitative, and it uses the breakpoints Bl, ..., Bm
as a basis for genome segmentation and dimension reduction by repre-
senting the samples a,- e 721’ in an m-dimensional space as follows.
All log-ratios of sample i measured at genomic loci between consecutive
consensus breakpoints Bk and Bk+1 are averaged. The resulting value,
denoted by x,(k), is the km component of the reduced representation x,-
of sample i in the space of the consensus regions. With the reduced
representations x1, .. . , xm as rows, we form the matrix X. We use X as
input data for a supervised prediction of a binary indicator )2 of tumor
phenotype. Examples of phenotype indicators include binary representa-
tions of tumor stage, tumor grade, age at diagnosis, survival, response to
treatment and so forth. We compare the prediction accuracy of the model
to that of a baseline model, using the initial probe data as input and the
same phenotype y. If the set of consensus breakpoints is biologically
meaningful, then the accuracy of the prediction based on the reduced
representation X should not be signiﬁcantly worse than that based on
the baseline. We base this requirement on the assumption that if biologic-
ally meaningful consensus breakpoints are missed, then important copy
number changes are overlooked and the relation to the phenotype
deteriorates. Moreover, if prediction accuracy increases after dimension
reduction, then reducing the variance between consecutive consensus
breakpoints via averaging is clearly beneﬁcial, and we conclude that the
(relatively small) set of consensus breakpoints carries biological signiﬁ-
cance. This approach is inspired by the existing single-array segmentation
procedures, which even out the raw log-ratios between individual break-
points for more precise estimation of the underlying copy number. The
reduced representation X is a multivariate generalization of the single-
array segmentation, and we call it consensus segmentation. The validation
procedure described above will be referred to as consensus segmentation
validation.

The list of consensus breakpoints identiﬁed by C-KS can be sorted in
decreasing order by Z—score. We expect that the top-ranking consensus
breakpoints are more useful that the ones at the bottom of the list. We
propose a supervised selection of the optimal value k, 1 5 k 5 m, such
that the consensus segmentation using the top-ranking k consensus
breakpoints achieves the largest prediction accuracy. The selection is

carried out via classical cross-validation. This supervised selection
procedure constitutes a data-driven alternative to choosing a signiﬁcance
cut-off for the Z—score, when phenotypic annotation is available.

Technically, for the prediction of phenotype, we use the Lasso-
penalized Logistic Regression method (LLR). LLR models the logarithm
of the posterior probabilities of the classes as linear functions of the
input features. The parameters w of the model are estimated by maximiz-
ing the log-likelihood L(w; X, )2) over the observations in the training set.
Model sparsity is obtained via the Lasso penalty, weighted by a factor A,
which can be optimized with cross-validation. Feature importance is
given by the model weights wLLR = arg maxw L(w; X, y) — A 2le | wj | .

In our experiments, we used the R package glmnet (Friedman et al.,
2010) for training LLR models. Ten-fold cross-validation was carried out
for the simultaneous estimation of optimal parameters A (penalty) and
k (number of consensus breakpoints selected from the list) and prediction
accuracy.

In our experiments, we report the prediction accuracy of the optimal
model as proportion of correctly classiﬁed samples. In one speciﬁc clas-
siﬁcation scenario, in which we deal with models trained on unbalanced
classes, for a fair comparison, we compute the weighted accuracy, or
balanced accuracy:

|{x e C1|f(x) = 1}| |{x 6 Col f (x) = 0}| _ sensitivity + speciﬁcity
2|C1| 2lCol 2 ’

 

 

where C0 and C1 are the two response classes and f is the prediction
function. We abbreviate the weighted accuracy as WACC, to distinguish
it from the classical accuracy, ACC.

2.3 Summarizing genomic and epigenomic properties of
consensus breakpoints with EpiExplorer

We have investigated the genomic and epigenomic properties of the gen-
omic locations at which consensus breakpoints are reported by C-KS.
For this purpose, we used EpiExplorer (Halachev et al., 2012), a web-
based application for interactive exploration of sets of genomic regions.
We explored the overlap with gene promoters, CpG islands, insulators
and various histone modiﬁcations.

EpiExplorer takes as input a set of genomic regions, which for our
study we deﬁned as follows. From each consensus breakpoint, we con-
structed a genomic region, which is likely to cover the set of individual
breakpoints that have a non-negligible contribution to the I‘ score of
the consensus breakpoint. Speciﬁcally, for consensus breakpoint Bk, the
region is centered at the location of the consensus breakpoint, and the
width is twice the width of the kernel pertaining to consensus breakpoint
Bk. For speciﬁcity, we restricted to the subsets of consensus breakpoints
obtained with small kernel width (0 e {1Kbp, 10Kbp}).

EpiExplorer also allows for direct comparison with control regions,
which in our experiments are randomly generated from the genome. For
more meaningful results, we used the option of variance estimation
offered by EpiExplorer, which means that 10 reference sets are used
and corresponding mean and standard deviation are shown.

3 DATA AND CLASSIFICATION SETTINGS

3.1 Neuroblastoma

Neuroblastoma is a tumor that affects the sympathetic nervous
system of young children and infants. For the purpose of therapy
selection, several factors are currently considered, including clas-
sical staging, age at diagnosis and several copy number markers.
Five stages are deﬁned for neuroblastoma: 141 and 4S. Stages 4
and 4S both correspond to metastasized tumors, but stage 4S
neuroblastoma occurs more, most often in infants (aged
<1 year), and has a high chance of undergoing spontaneous

remission. Stage 1, 2 and some of stage 3 neuroblastomas have
good prognosis. For higher stages, prognosis is established taking
into account several molecular markers but also, importantly, the
age at diagnosis. Until several years ago, patients aged <12
months were included in the good prognosis group, whereas the
older ones were considered to have poor prognosis and were ad-
ministered aggressive treatment. In the recent years, many clin-
icians have adopted a higher age cut-off, of around 18 months,
based on research evidence (London et al., 2005; Evans and
D’Angio, 2005; Schmidt et al., 2005). For clinical practice a
larger cut-off has a signiﬁcant impact, as it means that more
young children will not receive unnecessary aggressive
chemotherapy.

Copy number aberrations have been shown to inﬂuence the
outcome of therapy for patients with neuroblastoma (Fischer
and Berthold, 2010). Hyperploidy is generally indicative of good
outcome and is characteristic of tumors occurring in infants.
Ampliﬁcation of the MYCN gene located on chromosome 2, de-
letion of 11p and 1p and ampliﬁcation of l7q are the most widely
used indicators of poor prognosis (Ambros et al., 2009).

We analyzed 162 neuroblastoma tumors, obtained by two
Agilent arrayCGH microarray platforms (44 and 100k reso-
lution). The tumors are annotated with stage and age at diagno-
sis (in short, age). We have formulated the following
classiﬁcation tasks: (i) stage 4S (class 0) versus stage 4 (class 1);
(ii) age 3 t (class 0) versus age >t (class 1). We choose age cut-
offs te {2, 4,6, ...,32} (months) and for each value of t, we
train a classiﬁer. We compute the WACC of each classiﬁer and
suggest that the age cut-off resulting in the maximum WACC
value corresponds to a maximal difference between the genomes
of the tumors from the two groups.

3.2 Breast cancer

From the Gene Expression Omnibus (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
geo/), we obtained public DNA copy number data on three
breast cancer cohorts, all using the Agilent Human Genome
CGH Microarray 244 A platform (236000 60-mer oligonucleo-
tide probes).

The ﬁrst cohort consists of 54 breast tumors (Sircoulomb
et al., 2010). In this manuscript, we call this dataset breast54.
Annotations regarding the estrogen receptor (ER) status and
progesterone (PgR) receptor status are available. Also, a
binary indicator called metastasis-free survival (MFS) with
value 1 if the tumor has not metastasized after 5 years and 0
otherwise is available. The dataset also contains an indicator of
tumor subtype, which can be either inﬂammatory (IBC) or non-
inﬂammatory breast cancer (NIBC). We conducted the following
classiﬁcation experiments: (i) ER negative (class 0) versus ER
positive tumors (class 1); (ii) PgR negative (class 0) versus PgR
positive tumors (class 1); (iii) metastasis-free survival 2 5 years
(class 0) versus metastasis-free survival <5 years (class 1); and
(iv) NIBC (class 0) versus IBC tumors (class 1).

The second dataset comprises 173 breast tumors. The experi-
mental data were published by Bekhouche et al. (2011). We
call this dataset breast173. ER and PgR status annotations are
available for the tumors. We performed the following classiﬁca-
tion tasks: (i) ER negative (class 0) versus ER positive tumors

(class 1); (ii) PgR negative (class 0) versus PgR positive tumors
(class 1).

The third set of array CGH experiments comprises 167 breast
tumors, published by Russnes et al. (2010). We will call this
dataset breast167. The following phenotypic annotations are
provided: ER and PgR status, lymph node spread status (yes
or no), tumor stage, tumor grade and histological subtype. We
performed the following classiﬁcation tasks: (i) ER negative
(class 0) versus ER positive tumors (class 1); (ii) PgR negative
(class 0) versus PgR positive tumors (class 1); (iii) tumor not
spread to lymph nodes (class 0) versus tumor spread to lymph
nodes (class 1); (iv) stage pTl (class 0) versus stage pT2 (class 1);
(v) grade 2 (class 0) versus grade 3 (class 1); and (vi) Histological
subtype ductal (class 0) versus lobular (class 1).

3.3 Colon cancer, ovarian cancer and glioblastoma

The following datasets contained no publicly available clinical
indicators associated with the tumors. Veeriah et al. (2010) inves-
tigated a cohort of 98 colon tumors. The experiments based on the
Agilent Human Genome CGH Microarray 244 A microarrays
have been made public at the GEO. We call this dataset colon.

A comprehensive collection of arrayCGH experiments on 290
ovarian cancer samples are publicly available at TCGA. The
tumors have been analyzed using the Agilent Human CGH
1 x 1M G4447A arrays, with ~1 million probes covering the
genome. We call this dataset ovarian.

From the same repository, we have obtained publicly available
data on 539 glioblastoma tumors, analyzed using Agilent Human
Genome CGH 244 A microarray experiments. This dataset
will be called glioblastoma.

Consensus breakpoints

 

of consensus breakpoints with Z—score larger than zero identiﬁed
in each dataset in comparison with the average number of break-
points per tumor and the total number of breakpoints in each
cohort. We chose a permissive threshold for the Z—score (zero)
to ensure that the supervised selection of the optimal threshold
is decisive.

Table 1 shows that neuroblastoma stands out from the rest of
the cancer types with few breakpoints per tumor (54 on average),
a striking difference to other tumors probably related to the
fact that neuroblastoma appears early during infancy, and
DNA aberrations do not have sufﬁcient time to accumulate.
Moreover, segmental gains or losses are not characteristic of
neuroblastoma, more frequent events being whole chromosome
gain (hyperploidy) or loss (aneuploidy). These are not delimited
by breakpoints located strictly within chromosomes, hence, the
small counts. Colon cancer, glioblastoma, breast cancer follow,
with increasing number of breakpoints. The highest frequency of
breakpoints is observed in the ovarian cohort, with 806 break-
points per tumor.

The total number of breakpoints (excluding duplicates) is the
minimal number of features necessary to represent the segmented
log-ratio data each tumor in the cohort and the values are
evidently large (see column three of Table 1). For the task of
phenotype prediction, for example, dealing with the high dimen-
sionality of the data is a challenge (typical p>>n problem). The
fourth column of Table 1 shows the number of consensus break-
points identiﬁed in each cohort, with indication of standard
deviation, which is the result of the application of C-KS
method independently on 10 sub-folds of the data, each contain-
ing 90% of the tumor samples. The number of consensus break-
points also corresponds to the number of super-features used to
represent the samples after consensus segmentation (see Section
2). The dimension reduction is substantial, the fold change being
indicated in brackets in Table l, fourth column.

We tested whether the new models based on the smaller fea-
ture set exhibit reduced predictivity of tumor phenotype by com-
paring the prediction accuracy of LLR models trained on the
initial datasets and on the reduced datasets, as explained in
Section 2. We performed the classiﬁcation tasks presented in
Section 3. Table 2 shows performance in terms of ACC estimated
via lO-fold cross-validation, for LLR and for LLR after C-KS
segmentation (LLR+ C-KS). Using consensus segmentation
results in comparable accuracy with that given by the baseline
model. In fact, accuracy improves slightly in 7 of 13 cases. This is
so despite disregarding all copy number changes (breakpoints)
between consensus breakpoints. The accuracy values that we
report are competitive with results presented elsewhere. For ex-
ample, Chin et al. (2007) use a k-NN classiﬁer and report an
accuracy of 75.3% for ER status prediction, whereas our method
achieves 75.7% on average over the three breast cohorts. The
same study reports 74.3% accuracy for prediction of tumor
grade, whereas we achieve 75%.

For the case of prediction of age at diagnosis in neuroblast-
oma, in order to make the models comparable in the face of
imbalances in class cardinality, we computed the WACC per-
formance measure for each classiﬁer. Figure la shows the
WACC values for each age cut-off. A maximum WACC is ob-
tained at a cut-off of 18 months, meaning that the age groups are
most different for this dichotomization. Not signiﬁcantly lower

performance is achieved also by the cut-off of 16 months. Our
result is consistent with the recent recommendations for neuro-
blastoma treatment, which suggest 18 months cut-off for differ-
ential therapy. To our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to present
arguments in support of this choice based solely on the copy
number proﬁles of the tumors.

The insights into neuroblastoma that our prediction models
provide reach further. We have analyzed the weights of the
features in the models, in order to assess the predictive value
of each consensus region. To make the weights comparable, we
performed the following simple normalization: for each model,
we computed the absolute value of the weights and divided by
the maximum absolute weight. Hence, the most relevant feature
of each model has a weight of l, and the features that do not
enter the model have a weight equal to 0. All other feature
weights fall between 0 and 1. Figure lb shows a heatmap repre-
sentation of the normalized feature weights. The most predictive
features are consensus regions situated at chromosomes lq, 2q,
3p, 4p, 6q, 11, 14, 17 18 and 20. The importance of these regions
changes smoothly with the increase of the cut-off from 2 to 32
months. Some features are more useful for discriminating be-
tween young patients and the rest, such as the region at 2q,
which is the strongest predictor for a cut-off of 8—10 months.
This region is consistently gained in the younger patients, as a
consequence of the whole chromosome 2 gain. The 17p also
seems predictive if the cut-off value is of 8—10 months, for a
similar reason: whole chromosome 17 gain is characteristic for
younger patients. When the age split is increased to 12 months,
2q is not dominant anymore and instead a combination of 2q,
3p, 4p, 6q, ll, 17 and 18 contributes to the classiﬁcation model.
All these regions are predictive because they indicate full
chromosome gains or losses (polyploidy), which are characteris-
tic to many neuroblastoma tumors. Models corresponding to
cut-offs from 14 to 18 months involve roughly the same regions,
with slight variations. For cut-offs larger than 18 months, region
2q is no longer predictive, but chromosomes 14 and 20 are added
to the model.

4.2 Genomic and epigenomic properties of consensus
breakpoints

Using EpiExplorer, we investigated the (epi)genomic properties
of tight consensus breakpoints with signiﬁcant Z—score from all
seven datasets. Figure 2 summarizes our ﬁndings. Comparing
with a random reference, we observe an enrichment in over-
lap with gene promoters. We also notice an enrichment in over-
lap with CpG islands, which has been reported previously
(Abeysinghe et al., 2003). Because the CpG islands are often
found in gene promoters, we excluded the regions overlapping
with gene promoters and re—evaluated the overlap with CpG
islands (result not showed here). Interestingly, the enrichment
in CpG islands persisted.

We investigated also the overlap with insulators and his-
tone modiﬁcations. As these are tissue speciﬁc and there are
no public annotations of sequence data from cancer tissues,
we used data from human embryonic stem cells. Our results
show slight enrichment of insulator regions overlapping with
consensus breakpoints. Insulators are proteins that bind to
DNA in speciﬁc locations to establish transcription boundaries,
and insulator regions are the genomic regions insulators bind
to. An example is the CTCF insulator protein, the function of
which is often disrupted in cancer, e.g. by hypermethylation
of its binding site (Feinberg and Tycko, 2004). We observe the
enrichment of histone marks that are associated with dynamic
regulation of gene transcription (H3K4me3, H3K27me3 and
H3K36me3).

To guarantee that the particular selection of the probes on
the microarray chip does not bias the enrichment analysis,
for example, by being located mostly within gene-rich regions,
we ran an additional control experiment. We collected all indi-
vidual breakpoints from each dataset and repeated the analysis

using EpiExplorer (white bars in Fig. 2). The overlap with the
(epi)genomic properties was in general lower, notably in the case
of CpG islands. This suggests that the selection of breakpoint
locations performed by the C—KS algorithm is biologically
meaningful.

Although many studies show that the location of the DNA
breakpoint in fusion transcripts is critical, little is known about
the biological relevance of the breakpoints associated with DNA
gain or loss. It is commonly accepted that the oncogenes or
tumor suppressors located within the gained or lost segments
are responsible for tumor development, and the location of the
breakpoint is not essential. This hypothesis is probably true in
most of the cases, as real data show that recurrent aberrations
may vary greatly in their extent. However, many tumors display
focal aberrations with tightly aligned breakpoints, which suggests
that the local structure of the chromatin ‘forces’ the breaks to
occur within certain regions by hindering DNA repair (Soria
et al., 2012) (see also Supplementary Figs S2 and S3 for examples
from our datasets and TightConsensusBreakpoints.xls available
as Supplementary Material).

The enrichment analysis that we performed supports the
hypothesis that the DNA locations of tightly aligned consensus
breakpoints have interesting biological properties that deserve to
be further investigated.

5 DISCUSSION

We have introduced the algorithm C-KS for identifying consen-
sus breakpoints from DNA copy number alteration data. The
algorithm takes as input the list of breakpoints occurring in the
tumor cohort. C-KS uses a weighted kernel counting for evalu-
ating the abundance of breakpoints around genomic locations.

Fig. 2. Properties of consensus breakpoint regions given by EpiExplorer.
On the y-axis, various genomic and epigenomic properties are listed.
On the x-axis, we show the percentage of consensus breakpoint regions
overlapping with each of the properties. In gray, the consensus break-
points from each dataset are represented. In red, the random reference
is shown, with standard deviation bars. In white, summary on the overlap
of individual breakpoints with (epi)genomic properties

A signiﬁcance Z—score is associated to each consensus break-
point, resulting from a comparison with null scores obtained
via random permutation.

We also introduced the concept of consensus segmentation,
which is a generalization of the single-sample segmentation pro-
cedure. We used the consensus segmentation for representing the
data into a space of lower dimensionality and carried out classi-
ﬁcation tasks with tumor phenotype as outcome variable.

We applied the C-KS algorithm to seven arrayCGH datasets.
We showed that despite the signiﬁcant dimension reduction, the
consensus segmentation driven by the consensus breakpoints
results in comparable accuracy of prediction of the tumor pheno-
type. Often, the prediction accuracy increases after segmentation,
especially in cases in which the number of samples is small.

Based on our classiﬁcation models, the copy number aberra-
tion proﬁles of neuroblastoma tumors are most distinct between
age groups deﬁned using a cut-off of 18 months. Our ﬁnding

conﬁrms recent recommendations from the research community,
based on arguments not incorporating copy number alteration
proﬁles. We believe that our result is important, as it provides
with a biologically founded explanation to the impact of age at
diagnosis on outcome.

We also showed that the genomic regions identiﬁed as tightly
aligned consensus breakpoints are enriched in overlap with func-
tional elements, such as gene promoters, CpG islands, several
histone modiﬁcations and insulators, which constitute interesting
biological ﬁndings that deserve further investigation.

To conclude, we describe an algorithm for identifying consen-
sus breakpoints and a method for consensus segmentation of
copy number aberration data. The substantial dimension reduc-
tion achieved by consensus segmentation with no loss of essential
predictive information can constitute the basis of efﬁcient down-
stream analysis and data integration.

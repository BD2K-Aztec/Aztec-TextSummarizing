Abstract

Motivation: Sequencing of matched tumor and normal samples is the standard study design for re—
liable detection of somatic alterations. However, even very low levels of cross—sample contamin—
ation significantly impact calling of somatic mutations, because contaminant germline variants can
be incorrectly interpreted as somatic. There are currently no sequence—only based methods that re—
liably estimate contamination levels in tumor samples, which frequently display copy number
changes. As a solution, we developed Conpair, a tool for detection of sample swaps and cross—
individual contamination in whole—genome and whole—exome tumor—normal sequencing
experiments.

Results: On a ladder of in silico contaminated samples, we demonstrated that Conpair reliably
measures contamination levels as low as 0.1%, even in presence of copy number changes. We
also estimated contamination levels in glioblastoma WGS and WXS tumor—normal datasets from
TCGA and showed that they strongly correlate with tumor—normal concordance, as well as with
the number of germline variants called as somatic by several widely—used somatic callers.

1 Introduction

The decreasing cost of high—throughput sequencing allows analysis
of larger number of samples than before, which as an unfortunate
side effect increases the chances of sample mix—ups and contamin-
ation. Cancer studies often jointly analyze matched tumor—normal
(T—N) samples in order to detect somatic mutations that are present
in the tumor. Even a very low level of cross—individual contamin—
ation in the tumor sample may introduce many low allele frequency
germline variants that will be interpreted as somatic by somatic vari—
ant calling algorithms, resulting in greatly reduced specificity
(Supplementary Figure S1). Detecting sample swaps and low level
contamination in tumor samples are critical quality control steps
that should precede every somatic analysis. However, estimating

contamination in tumor samples is confounded by frequent copy
number alterations that affect allelic ratio distributions.
VerifyBamID (Jun et 61]., 2012) and ContEst (Cibulskis et 61].,
2011) have emerged as standard methods to estimate sample con—
tamination. VerifyBamID maximizes the likelihood of a contamin-
ation level in a two—sample miXture model, given the alleles and base
qualities, using a grid search over a range of contamination fractions
and refining the result using a numerical root—finding method.
VerifyBamID provides an accurate measure for contamination in
mostly diploid (copy—neutral) samples, however it may interpret
copy number—driven allelic imbalance frequently seen in cancer as
contamination. ContEst calculates the maximum a posteriori esti—
mate of contamination based on the base identities and quality

scores from sequencing data, at sites identified on a SNP array to be
homozygous. The method can be applied to tumor—normal studies,
however ContEst requires additional data from a genotyping array.
Alternatively, genotypes of a normal sample called from high cover—
age (>5 0><) sequencing data can be used.

We developed Conpair (Concordance/Contamination of paired
samples) to robustly detect contamination in cancer studies based
on sequence data alone. We show that our method accurately de—
tects contamination levels as low as 0.1% (Supplementary Table
S3), even in presence of copy number changes. In contrast to
ContEst, our tool also allows verifying concordance between
tumor and normal samples and estimating contamination in nor-
mal samples. Conpair is ~50>< faster than VerifyBamID and ~18 ><
faster than ContEst on a 60 ></60>< WGS pair (Supplementary
Figure S11A).

2 Methods

Copy number changes, which are frequent in tumor samples, may
cause difficulties in estimating contamination levels due to shifting
of the expected 50% allelic fraction for heterozygous markers. By
using matched normal samples we can robustly detect homozygous
markers, which are invariant to copy number changes and are not
affected by contamination in the normal sample, and subsequently
use them to reliably estimate contamination level in the tumor sam-
ple (see Supplementary Methods).

Conpair takes as input a pair of BAM files, the reference genome
and a short list of pre—selected highly informative genomic markers
that are provided with the tool (see Supplementary Methods), in
order to run both concordance verification and contamination esti—
mation. For concordant T—N pairs, Conpair measures contamin—
ation first in the normal and then in the tumor sample, using the
genotype information from the normal. Conpair employs the statis—
tical model developed by Jun and colleagues (VerifyBamID), but in
contrast to VerifyBamID allows for only two alleles and uses a lim—
ited set of markers (Supplementary Methods).

3 Results

In silico contaminated data. We constructed two independent sets of
in silico contaminated cancer samples by mixing reads from BAM
files from copy number aberrant (Magi et al., 2013) TCGA glio—
blastoma exomes (Brennan et al., 2013) at a ladder from 0.1% to
95%, yielding a total of 245 samples at 49 different contamination
levels (or) in each set. For each sample we estimated or using Conpair,
VerifyBamID and ContEst (sequence—only mode). Our results indi—
cate a better agreement between Conpair and the ground truth in
both sets (RMSD : 0.0064; 0.009), compared to ContEst
(RMSD : 0.0075; 0.0128) or VerifyBamID (RMSD : 0.062; 0.045)
(Supplementary Figures S4 and SS).

TCGA glioblastoma dataset. After verifying T—N pairing
(Supplementary Figure S6), we applied Conpair to 51 WGS and 396
WXS sample pairs from the TCGA glioblastoma study. Since the
WGS dataset appeared clean according to Conpair (or: 0.0—0.612%/
0—0.905% in the tumor and normal samples respectively), we
focused on the less clean WXS dataset (or: 0.008—4.75%/0.014—6.
52% in the tumor and normal samples respectively). The WXS data—
set consists of 144 T—N pairs that underwent a whole—genome amp—
lification (WGA) library preparation protocol and 252 T—N pairs
prepared by exome capture. Conpair, ContEst and VerifyBamID re-
turned similar contamination values for all the normal samples,

Fig. 1. Relationship between tumor—normal discordance values (1 — concord-
ance) and contamination levels detected by Conpair, ContEst and
VerifyBamID in a set of TCGA glioblastoma WXS tumor samples. Data shows
whole genome amplified samples (red) and exome capture (blue)

independently of the library preparation method (Supplementary
Figure 87A and C).

For tumor samples, the differences in the values returned by the
three programs were substantial. VerifyBamID estimated high or for
the majority of the tumor samples. Contamination estimates gener—
ated by ContEst were higher, but comparable to Conpair for all
samples prepared following exome capture. Conpair and ContEst
did not agree on a subset of tumor samples that underwent WGA,
for which ContEst detected much higher fractions of contamination
(5—10%) (Supplementary Figure 87B and D).

To assess which method was more accurate, we correlated the
contamination estimates with the T—N concordance values (calcu—
lated based only on markers that were homozygous in the normal
sample). Tumor samples with T—N concordance values close to
100% cannot be significantly contaminated (Supplementary Figure
S2). Based on this fact, we were able to show that VerifyBamID
highly overestimated or on the majority of the tumor samples, and
ContEst overestimated or on the subset of the WGA samples. The re—
sults returned by Conpair show a monotonic dependency between
the T—N concordance and contamination values (Fig. 1).

As an independent metric, we also looked at the number of
known germline variants called as ‘somatic’ by three somatic callers:
MuTect (Cibulskis et al., 2013), LoFreq (Wilm et al., 2012) and
Strelka (Saunders et al., 2012). These numbers were strongly corre—
lated with the contamination in the tumor samples returned by
Conpair (Spearman r: 0.76 [P—value:7.5e—20], 0.75 [5.5e—19],
0.67 [3.7e—14], for variants where oc>0.5%), but not correlated
with the estimates returned by ContEst and VerifyBamID (correl-
ations not significant) (Supplementary Figure SS). The obtained re—
sults suggest that Conpair is more robust in estimating
contamination levels in the light of different library preparation
methods.

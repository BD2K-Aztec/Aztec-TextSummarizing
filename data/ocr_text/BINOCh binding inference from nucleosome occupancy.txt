ABSTRACT

Summary: Transcription factor binding events are frequently
associated with a pattern of nucleosome occupancy changes
in which nucleosomes flanking the binding site increase in
occupancy, while those in the vicinity of the binding site itself
are displaced. Genome-wide information on enhancer proximal
nucleosome occupancy can be readily acquired using ChlP-seq
targeting enhancer-related histone modifications such as H3K4me2.
Here, we present a software package, BlNOCh that allows biologists
to use such data to infer the identity of key transcription factors that
regulate the response of a cell to a stimulus or determine a program
of differentiation.

1 INTRODUCTION

Although transcription factors are known to have a high afﬁnity for
speciﬁc DNA sequences, binding is often cell type and condition
speciﬁc, therefore DNA sequence alone is a poor predictor of
in vivo genome—wide binding locations (Carroll et al., 2006).
When the relevant transcription factors are known and suitable
antibodies are available, ChIP—chip and ChIP—seq technologies
enable us to map their genome—wide binding locations. In many
cases, however, the transcription factors governing a regulatory
response are not known or antibodies suitable for ChIP—seq are
not available. Without transcription factor—speciﬁc antibodies, it is
nevertheless possible to infer transcription factor binding events
based on two observations. First, transcription factor binding sites
are often associated with certain types of post—translational histone
modiﬁcations, in particular histone H3 lysine 4 mono— (H3K4me)
and di—methylation (H3K4me2) (Heintzman et al., 2007). Second,
transcription factor binding is frequently associated with a pattern
of nucleosome occupancy changes in which nucleosomes ﬂanking
the binding site increase in occupancy, while those in the vicinity of
the binding site itself are displaced (He at al., 2010). Transcription
factor (TF) binding events can therefore be inferred by comparing
nucleosome resolution H3K4me1/2 ChIP—seq data under treatment

and control conditions. We present a software package, BINOCh, to
allow biologists to carry out an analysis of nucleosome occupancy
data to discover stimulus—induced transcription factor binding.

2 METHOD

2.1 Identiﬁcation and scoring of candidate
transcription factor binding regions

The ﬁrst step in the analysis is to use histone—related ChIP—seq data to
detect well—positioned nucleosomes, which we do with the nucleosome
positioning from sequencing (NPS) package (Zhang et al., 2008) available
at http://liulab.dfci.harvard.edu/NPS. The second step, shown in Figure 1A,
is to ﬁnd pairs of nucleosomes with center to center distances characteristic
of nucleosomes ﬂanking TF binding sites (between 250 and 450 bp) and to
generate a table summarizing ChIP—seq tag counts in these regions. For every
nucleosome pair, we count the number of sequence reads within 100 bp of
the center of each positioned ‘ﬂanking’ nucleosome under both treatment
and control conditions, denoted I’lﬂankat and nﬂankﬂ, respectively. We also
count the number of sequence reads mapped to the ‘central’ region between
two ﬂanking regions, denoted ncemmw and ncemmlﬁ. To generate this table
we provide an easy to use python script, tagtab. We measure nucleosome
occupancy change with the nucleosome stabilization—dcstabilization (NSD)
score,

5 = (\/nflank,t/Nt _ \/ncentral,t/Nt) _ (\/nflank,C/Nc _ \/ncentral,c/Nc)

where N, and NC are the total number of sequence reads in treatment and
control. In the ﬁnal step, using the python script binoch, we compute NSD
scores and search through DNA motif libraries, TRANSFAC (Wingender
et 01., 2000), JASPAR (Sandelin et 01., 2004) and UniPROBE (Berger and

C.A.Meyer et aI.

 

Bulyk, 2009), to detect motifs that are associated with the central regions of
high NSD scoring regions.

2.2 Motif position bias toward the midpoint of central
regions

Our model for transcription factor binding is one in which transcription factor
binding sites are located near the midpoint between paired nucleosomes. To
assess a trend of DNA sequence motif occurrence toward this midpoint,
we compute the mean relative location of motif hits. Statistical signiﬁcance
is derived using a null model where it is assumed that DNA motifs
not associated with binding sites are uniformly distributed relative to the
midpoint. We conduct this analysis on 600 bp DNA segments from the N
highest NSD—scoring set of paired nucleosomes. Figure 1B shows how each
600 bp segment is derived from a 1kb sequence centered at the midpoint
between a nucleosome pair from which 200 bp centered on each of the
pair of well—positioned nucleosomes is excluded. All DNA subsequences
within these sequences are scored by a known motif position weight matrix
using a low—order Markov model to account for the genomic background
sequence composition. For each nucleosome pair i, we obtain two values:
si, the maximum motif score for that pair and xi, a value between 0 and
1 representing the location of the motif position relative to the midpoint.
Sorting paired regions by motif score from high to low, we compute a list
of z scores, Zj = 211.21%- —0.5)/W, that represent the positional bias of
a motif toward the centers of these regions. We calculate the P—value for a
motif from the minimum z—score, making an adjustment for N.

2.3 Motif enrichment in high-scoring NSD regions

The motif centrality statistic, while telling us that a motif is occurring in
the DNA sequence between paired nucleosomes does not allow us to assess
whether this motif is enriched in the high NSD—scoring regions. To make this
assessment, BINOCh computes a P—value motif enrichment statistic where
the frequency with which a motif is found within the set of high NSD—
scoring regions is compared with its occurrence frequency within a control
set of regions. We select the control regions as those having NSD scores
closest to the median of the NSD—score distribution. The analysis is carried
out on the 200 bp of DNA sequence centered on the midpoint between paired
nucleosomes. Motifs that are signiﬁcant by both enrichment and centrality
measures are likely to be bona ﬁde transcription factor motifs important to
the system.

3 CASE STUDY

We applied this approach to nucleosome resolution H3K4me2
ChIP—seq data from the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP under the

control condition and in response to stimulation by the androgen
receptor (AR) agonist 5a—dihydrotestosterone (DHT) (He et al.,
2010). The BINOCh position analysis of this data produces a ranked
list of motifs with their associated P—values (Supplementary Table
1), showing the AR motif to be the most strongly associated with
the midpoint of high NSD scoring nucleosome pairs; in this analysis
TRANSFAC progesterone receptor motif which is the same as
the AR motif obtains the most signiﬁcant P—value (<1e—8). The
FoxAl motif is also biased toward the midpoint (P<1e—6). This
observation is biologically meaningful as FoxAl is thought to be
a ‘pioneer factor’ facilitating the binding of AR. The BINOCh
motif enrichment analysis (Supplementary Table 2) also ﬁnds a
TRANSFAC AR motif to be the most signiﬁcant (P <1e—48). See
http://liulab.dfci.harvard.edu/BINOCh to download the data and
further results of this analysis.

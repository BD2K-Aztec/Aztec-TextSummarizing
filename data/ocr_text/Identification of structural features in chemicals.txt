ABSTRACT

Motivation: Analysis of relationships of drug structure to biological
response is key to understanding off-target and unexpected drug ef-
fects, and for developing hypotheses on how to tailor drug therapies.
New methods are required for integrated analyses of a large number of
chemical features of drugs against the corresponding genome-wide
responses of multiple cell models.

Results: In this article, we present the first comprehensive multi-set
analysis on how the chemical structure of drugs impacts on genome-
wide gene expression across several cancer cell lines [Connectivity
Map (CMap) database]. The task is formulated as searching for drug
response components across multiple cancers to reveal shared ef-
fects of drugs and the chemical features that may be responsible.
The components can be computed with an extension of a recent ap-
proach called Group Factor Analysis. We identify 11 components that
link the structural descriptors of drugs with specific gene expression
responses observed in the three cell lines and identify structural
groups that may be responsible for the responses. Our method quan-
titatively outperforms the limited earlier methods on CMap and iden-
tifies both the previously reported associations and several interesting
novel findings, by taking into account multiple cell lines and advanced
3D structural descriptors. The novel observations include: previously
unknown similarities in the effects induced by 15-delta prostaglandin
J2 and HSP90 inhibitors, which are linked to the 3D descriptors of the
drugs; and the induction by simvastatin of leukemia-specific response,
resembling the effects of corticosteroids.

1 INTRODUCTION

Modeling and understanding the diverse spectrum of cellular
responses to drugs is one of the biggest challenges in chemical
systems biology. Some of the responses can be predicted for
targeted drugs, which have been designed to bind to a speciﬁc
protein that triggers the biological response. The binding of a
drug to a target largely depends on the structural correspondence
of the drug molecule and the binding cavity of the target mol-
ecule, which can be modeled in principle, given ample computa-
tional resources. Off-target effects are harder to predict. They are

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

dependent on the cell types, individual genetic characteristics and
cellular states making the spectrum of responses overwhelmingly
diverse. The less well-known the drug’s mechanism of action and
the characteristics of the disease, the harder the prediction from
ﬁrst principles becomes. The most feasible way to approach this
challenge in an unbiased way, which does not require prior
knowledge of all on- and off-target interactions of drugs, is to
collect systematic measurements across different drugs, cell types
and diseases and search for response patterns correlating with the
characteristics of the drugs. The patterns found can be used as
evidence for hypotheses on underlying action mechanisms or
directly in predicting the responses.

The Connectivity Map (CMap; Lamb et al., 2006) described
the basis for a data-driven study of drug—effect relationships at a
genome-wide level. CMap hosts the largest collection of high-
dimensional gene expression proﬁles derived from treatment of
three different human cancer cell lines with over one thousand
drugs. The CMap data have been used in a multitude of studies
revealing new biological links between drugs and between drugs
and diseases. Genome-wide gene expression responses from the
CMap have been used to discover clusters of drugs having simi-
lar mechanisms of action, resulting in novel ﬁndings, such as
effects of heat shock protein (HSP) inhibitors and identiﬁcation
of modulators of autophagy (Iorio et al., 2010). The CMap data
have also been successfully used in large-scale integrative studies
including the analysis of regulation of drug targets (Iskar et al.,
2010), hERG annotations to predict novel inhibitors (Babcock
et al., 2013) and drugs’ interactions with protein networks
(Laenen et al., 2013).

Quantitative structure—activity relationship analysis (QSAR;
Cramer et al., 1988) is a widely adopted approach to studying
drug responses. Traditionally, univariate biological activities are
predicted using a range of methods, including classical regres-
sion, support vector machines and Random Forests. The key
challenge when moving from traditional QSAR to system-wide
analysis of chemical effects is how to relate structural features to
genome-wide cellular responses.

Integration of chemical structures with genome-wide responses
has become a major research direction in chemical systems biol-
ogy (Iskar et al., 2012; Xie et al., 2012). Keiser et a]. (2009)
studied structural similarities between ligand sets while
Klabunde and Evers (2005) used protein—ligand complexes to
predict off-targets. To infer potential indications for drugs,
Gottlieb et al. (2011) combined similarities from chemical
structures, gene expression proﬁles, protein targets and several

other datasets. Atias and Sharan (2011) modeled linkage between
structural descriptors of drugs and their side effects using canon-
ical correlation analysis (CCA; Hotelling, 1936). Structures have
also been used with genomic datasets to predict toxicity and
complex adverse drug reactions (Russom et al., 2013).
Recently, Menden et al. (2013) combined structures of drugs
and mutation information of cell lines to predict drug cytotox-
icity in a series of cell lines.

Relationships between structural descriptors of drugs and their
gene expression proﬁles have also been studied. Cheng et al.
(2010) examined similarities between chemical structures and
molecular targets of 37 drugs that were clustered based on
their bioactivity proﬁles. Low et a]. (2011) classiﬁed 127 rat
liver samples to toxic versus non-toxic responses, based on com-
bined drug-induced expression proﬁles and chemical descriptors,
and identiﬁed chemical substructures and genes that were re-
sponsible for liver toxicity. In a broader setting, when the goal
is to ﬁnd dependencies between two data sources (chemical struc-
tures and genomic responses), correlation-type approaches
match the goal directly, and have the additional advantage
that a predeﬁned classiﬁcation is not required. Khan et a].
(2012) generalized structure response analysis to multivariate
correlations with CCA on the CMap. Because of the limitations
of classical CCA, their study was restricted to a limited set of
descriptors (76) and genomic summaries (1321 genesets), and did
not attempt to take into account the data from the three separate
cell lines.

In this article, we present the ﬁrst probabilistic approach to the
problem of integrated analysis of effects of chemical structures
across genome-wide responses in multiple model systems. We
extend the earlier work in three major ways: (i) instead of
using only two data sources (as in classical CCA), we used the
recent Bayesian group factor analysis (GFA) method (Virtanen
et al., 2012) that generalizes the analysis to multiple sources, here
three cell lines and two sets of chemical descriptors. (ii) Our
Bayesian treatment with feature-level priors enabled us to cope
better with the uncertainties in the high-dimensional data. (iii)
We included a more informative set of 3D chemical descriptors
to complement the widely used 2D ﬁngerprints, which are
recognized to only explain limited aspects of drugs (Schneider,
2010).

Our goal was to uncover the big picture of relationships be-
tween chemical structure parameters and genome-wide re-
sponses, in a data-driven fashion (Fig. 1). The data came from
CMap, 11 327 gene expression responses in three cell lines
(HL60-Blood Cancer/Leukemia, MCF7-Breast Cancer and
PC3-Prostate Cancer; Lamb et al., 2006) and from two sets of
chemical descriptors: 780 3D Pentacle descriptors of drugs
(Duran et al., 2008) and 2769 functionally relevant structural
fragments (FCFP4; Glen et al., 2006) as 2D ﬁngerprints of the
drugs. These ﬁve datasets consist of samples from the 682 drug
treatments, coupled by the detailed drug identity. We analyzed
the statistical relationships between the datasets by decomposing
them into a set of interpretable components. Our method quan-
titatively outperformed previous studies, thereby validating the
approach. We rediscovered ﬁndings reported earlier as well as
identiﬁed novel drug associations and detailed structure response
relationships.

2 METHODS

2.1 Gene expression datasets

We used the CMap (Lamb et al., 2006) gene expression data as a measure
of the biological response of the three cancer cell lines to drug treatments,
forming the gene expression datasets. The CMap hosts over 7100 gene
expression proﬁles including technical replicates treated with 1309 drugs
and is the largest available resource of its kind. Responses from a subset
of these drugs (682) were measured on all of the three cell lines, namely,
HL60 (leukemia), MCF7 (breast cancer) and PC3 (prostate cancer cell
line).

We obtained the raw gene expression proﬁles from the CMap and used
the data from the most abundant microarray platform (HT-HG-U133A).
The data were preprocessed using the Robust Multiarray Averaging
(RMA; Irizarry et al., 2003) and drug treatment versus control (log2) dif-
ferential expression was calculated batchwise (Khan et al., 2012).
Technical replicates were merged by taking the mean of each gene.
This resulted in gene expression proﬁles for the 682 drugs having meas-
urements over all three cell lines. To reduce noise, we adapted the ap-
proach of Iorio et a]. (2010) for our setting, by retaining the expression of
top 2000 up- and 2000 downregulated genes for each sample, while con-
sidering the rest as noise (set to zero). The threshold was large to retain
diverse effects and removed small values. These proﬁles formed three
biological response datasets (one for each cell line), each being a differ-
ential gene expression matrix of 682 drugs times 11 327 genes.

2.2 Chemical descriptor datasets

The chemical space of drugs was represented using two different types of
chemical descriptors, namely, the 2D ﬁngerprints ‘FCFP4’ and 3D de-
scriptors ‘Pentacle’. The FCFP4 (functional connectivity ﬁngerprints of
radius 4; Glen et al., 2006) are circular topological ﬁngerprints designed
speciﬁcally for structure—activity modeling and similarity searching. They
are rapidly computable and heavily used in a wide variety of applications
(Rogers and Hahn, 2010). Each dimension of the ﬁngerprints represents a
certain 2D fragment of the compounds, interpretable as presence of
certain substructures, typically stereochemical information, and allows
easy visual inspection of structures. Therefore, FCFP4 can be used to
identify the core 2D substructures that make compounds structurally
similar and are responsible for biological activity.

The more complex 3D descriptors Pentacle (Duran et al., 2008) cap-
ture the functional properties of the compounds using molecular inter-
action ﬁelds. They are able to group together compounds with dissimilar
chemical structures and yet having the same type of molecular ﬁeld prop-
erties. This is especially important in our study where the aim is to ﬁnd
small molecules that share biological functions despite structural dissimi-
larity. Most of the traditional ﬁngerprints, like MACCS (Molecular
Access System) and FCFP4, are superior to recognize 2D structural simi-
larity but unfortunately unable to recognize structurally unrelated and yet
biologically similar compounds binding into the same binding pocket.
The opposite is true with most (if not all) ﬁeld-based similarity methods
like Pentacle, which ﬁnd more effective distant similarities; therefore, we
decided to combine both approaches. In the earlier work, Khan et al.
(2012) had used VolSurf descriptors to represent molecular properties.
Although VolSurf is an optimal method for physicochemical properties
estimation, it is not able to describe pharmacophore features extensively,
unlike the Pentacle descriptors, and thus is not an option in our study.

Pentacle ﬁeld distance descriptors were computed using Pentacle v
1.0.4 (http://www.moldiscovery.com/soft_pentacle.php), by Molecular
Discovery. The descriptors were calculated for all the available 10
probe sets, namely, D2, 02, N2, T2, DO, DN, DT, ON, OT, NT, where
D is dry probe to represent hydrophobic interactions, 0 is carbonyl
oxygen probe to represent hydrogen bond donor feature of the molecules
and N ﬂat probe of Nitrogen is the hydrogen bond acceptor, while T is
TIP probe representing shape of the molecule, in terms of steric hot spots.

decomposed into components by GFA. Components of Type 1 represent shared patterns in both chemistry and biology, whereas Type 2 describes
biology-only or chemistry-only variation (not as useful in our case). (C) Each shared component identiﬁes key structures and genes of an underlying

biological process

For each probe set, 78 descriptors were obtained, representing the inter-
action potentials of probes at different distances, resulting in 780 descrip-
tors in total. Distances in the Pentacle descriptors are true distances
between putative interaction sites (hot spots) and are thus connected to
the size of the compound and distances between potential pharmacopho-
ric features. This results in a 682 X 780 data matrix, with each row being a
drug and the 780 columns representing the Pentacle descriptors. This
forms the ﬁrst chemical dataset in our study.

The 2D FCFP4 represent the chemicals as structural fragments. In
FCFP, the fragments are not predeﬁned, rather computed dynamically
and thus can represent variation in novel structures. The FCFP4 ﬁnger-
prints were computed using Pipeline Pilot Student Edition software
(http://accelrys.com/products/pipeline-pilot/), by Accelrys. A total of
2769 unique structural fragments are found, and the ﬁngerprints are rep-
resented as a matrix of 682 compounds X 2769 fragment descriptors. This
forms the second chemical dataset in our study.

2.3 Model: GFA

We search for relationships between chemical descriptors and biological
responses, as clues to the key underlying biological processes. GFA is a
model designed to capture such relationships (statistical dependencies) by
explaining a collection of datasets (‘views’) by a set of factors or compo-
nents, which form a combined low-dimensional representation (V irtanen
et al., 2012). In the multi—view setting, each component is active in a subset
of the datasets and is a simpliﬁed model of an underlying process visible
in those sets. The task solved by GFA is to separate the shared compo-
nents that capture the structure—biology relationships from the rest of the
data: the former are visible in all or a subset of the datasets, whereas
components active in a single view describe variation speciﬁc to that
particular view or noise.

Given a collection of M datasets X“) e RNXD1 ...X(m) e RNXDM, con-
sisting of N co-occurring samples x3"), GFA ﬁnds a set of latent compo-
nents (with upper limit K, see below). Each dataset is assumed to have
been generated as a linear combination of latent components Z G RNXK,

with weights of the combination given by a loadings matrix
WW) 6 RDmXK: Assuming normal distributions for simplicity, the
model is

xglm) ~ Normal ( W(m)zn, 20%)),

zn ~ Normal(0, I),

(1)

where Zn is the nth row of Z, and 20") is a diagonal noise covariance
matrix. GFA is special in that the projections W are required to be
group-wise sparse, i.e. all the elements  are set to zero for the com-
ponents k that are not active in the mm dataset. The components with
non-zero projections between two or more views capture dependencies
between the views.

To increase the interpretability of the model, we extend GFA by intro-
ducing element-wise sparsity in addition to the group sparsity for the
projection matrices, matching the biological prior assumption that each
process typically activates only a subset of genes. We introduce element-
wise automatic relevance determination (ARD; Neal, 1995) prior for the
projection weight matrices, pushing irrelevant weight values  toward
zero and making each component element-wise sparse. For the group
sparsity, we apply the group spike and slab prior where the binary vari-
able Hjcm) controls the activity of the km component in the group m. The

the model description, we set an uninformative before the diagonal elem-
ents of the precision matrix (2010)—1. Here we made two assumptions, (i)

normal distributions for simplicity and (ii) sparsity. Sparsity was imple-
mented by combining the previously (Klami et al., 2013) separately used
beta-Bernoulli formulation and the element-wise normal-gamma ARD.

We represent our (M = 5) datasets as matrices of drugs versus fea-
tures. The rows represent the samples (drugs), and the columns are the
features (genes or chemical descriptors). Drugs pair all the views, i.e. a
row in all matrices corresponds to the same drug. A total of N = 682
drugs were used in the study. The features of the chemical descriptors,
Pentacle (m = 1) and FCFP4 (m = 2) are D; = 780 Pentacle probe ﬁelds
and D2 = 2769 fragments, respectively. The biological responses of the
three cell lines (m = 3,4,5) are represented by differential expression of
Dm = 11 327 genes each.

The hyperparameters are set to a“, b“ = 10‘3 and a”, b” = 1, to obtain
uninformative priors. We initialize the model by sampling the latent vari-
ables from the prior. The model parameters (Wing), Him), 20”), 01272, ark, Z)
are then learned from the data using Gibbs sampling. The number of
components is optimally learned from data by initializing K to be large
enough, such that sparsity assumptions push some to be inactive. Here
for computational reasons, we set K = 80, a value signiﬁcantly larger
than the actual number of shared components, and let the noise model
represent the rest of the data. For sampling, we ran 10 chains and selected
for further analysis the one having its likelihood closest to the mean of
non-outlier chains. The ﬁrst 5000 samples were discarded as the burn-in,
and the chain was run for 1000 more iterations, with a thinning factor of
5. The mean value of the samples was used as a representation of the
model. As a sanity check, we veriﬁed that our shared components had
over 70% similarity in top genes and descriptors with the second (non-
used) chain. The model’s complexity is 0(NDK2 + K3) where
D = sum(D1,.M). The current implementation ran for 5 days on a stand-
ard desktop computer consuming 6 GB memory.

For interpretation, we represent each component by listing the high-
valued latent scores Z and projection values W. For the latent scores, we
performed a permutation test to detect the most signiﬁcantly (q-
value< 0.05) activated drugs, while for the projections we inspected the
top 30 elements.

3 RESULTS

Figure 2 gives an overview of the types of components discovered
by the model. For studying structure—activity relationships, the
most important are the components shared by one or more
chemical view and one or more of the cancer subtypes. The com-
ponents active in only the expression datasets represent drug
responses not captured by the used chemical descriptors, and
components only active in the chemical datasets represent bio-
logically irrelevant structural variance. Additionally, components
active in only a single dataset may represent dataset-speciﬁc
noise. We found 11 shared components, which will be discussed
below. The detailed structure—response relationships discovered
from all the shared components are visualized in Supplementary
Figure S1 and tabulated in a usable format in Supplementary
Table S2.

3.1 Validation via chemical biology ontology

We started by quantitatively evaluating how closely related the
drugs in the shared components are in terms of known chemical—
biology relationships and compared our data with those of two
previous studies (Iorio et al., 2010; Khan et al., 2012) that inves-
tigated drug actions using the same CMap database version.

squares) had a consistently higher mean average similarity (y-axis) in
ChEBI than either of the earlier studies, and random sets of compounds,
over the entire range of ChEBI path lengths (x—axis). To access the rela-
tive contribution of the 3D descriptors we additionally plotted results
with components containing them (dashed line) and components contain-
ing only 2D descriptors (dotted line), demonstrating that both descriptors
are valuable. Error bars (red) are one stdandard over 1000 randomly
generated sets

(ChEBI; Degtyarenko et al., 2008), which is the largest such
ontology of small compounds. ChEBI links compounds with
respect to chemical structure, biological roles they are known
to play and their applications. Examples of classiﬁcations are
antibiotic, coenzyme and agonist (biological); donor, ligand, in-
hibitor (chemical); and pesticide, antiasthmatic (applications).
ChEBI was downloaded as a graph and contained paths between
328 (of 682) of our compounds via 611 ontology terms (http://
www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi).

The average similarity (inverse path distance) of drugs within
the shared GFA components was consistently higher than the
corresponding similarities of Khan et al., (2012) and Iorio et al.,
(2010) and random sets of compounds (Fig. 3). The largest path
length (16) in ChEBI linked all drugs, whereas the smallest (2)
linked only the most similar. Interestingly, the difference in GFA
and others on small path lengths was higher than that on larger
ones, indicating that drugs closely connected in ChEBI were even
better found by GFA.

3.2 Component interpretations

We next analyzed the shared components in detail. Each com-
ponent connects a set of structural drug properties and gene ex-
pression changes, forming a hypothesis of a structure—activity
relationship. A component can be characterized by the set of
drugs that activate it the most, and by the set of genes that are
expressed differentially when the component is active.

We ﬁrst compared the ﬁndings with the two other studies that
have investigated drug actions using the same CMap database
(Iorio et al., 2010; Khan et al., 2012). Of the 11 shared GFA
components, the majority of the drugs in seven components were
similar to the clusters found by Iorio et al. (2010), while three
components captured structurally driven cell-speciﬁc responses
they had missed. Compared with the other earlier study (Khan
et al., 2012), the majority of the drugs in 6 of the 11 GFA com-
ponents matched a corresponding structure-response subcompo-
nent of Khan et al., (2012), again indicating conformance to
known results. Our components also revealed several novel
drug actions because of cell-type speciﬁcity and advanced 3D
descriptors that were missed by both of these earlier studies,
and are presented below.

Detailed interpretation of all the 11 shared components is pre-
sented in Supplementary Table S1. The components are num-
bered in the order of the amount of variation they captured; the
cell line-speciﬁc components identiﬁed by the model are separ-
ately ordered with the preﬁx SP. One component (SP3) captured
outlier response of a single drug and was omitted from further
analysis.

The majority of the components captured effects shared
among all the three cell lines, whereas ﬁve components had re-
sponses that were cell line-speciﬁc (Components SP1, SP2, SP4),
dominant in a speciﬁc cell line (Component 7) or revealed some
cell line speciﬁcity indications for an interesting drug
(Component 1). The 2D structural features were active in most
components, identifying similarities in structurally analogous
drugs. The pentacle descriptors captured similarities in ﬁve com-
ponents, four of which indicated novel responses of drugs that
have not been reported before. We discuss these four novel com-
ponents in detail below. One of them had cell line-speciﬁc effects
(SP2), whereas the remaining cell line-speciﬁc components (SP1
and SP4) are summarized in Table 1.

Component 1 was characterized by cardenolides. The top seven
drugs of the component, lanatoside C, digitoxigenin, digoxin,

digoxigenin, ouabain, helveticoside and strophantidin belonged
to this class. The primary activity of the other drugs anisomycin,
lycorine and cicloheximide is protein synthesis inhibition, and
bisacodyl is used as a laxative through stimulation of secretion
in the colon. Cardenolides act on Na+ /K+ pumps and are known
for ion ﬁux alterations. Interestingly, the other compounds of
Component 1 also appeared to affect membrane potassium ion
ﬂux. Bisacodyl and anisomycin activate K+ ﬁux, lycorine is
known to reduce membrane potential (indicative of potassium
efﬁux) and, indicative of affecting K+, emetine needs to be ad-
ministered with potassium to reduce cardiotoxicity. Interestingly,
bisacodyl exhibited the response in MCF7 and PC3 cells only,
suggesting that its target may be expressed selectively.

On the structural side, the top four FCFP4 fragments collect-
ively represented the correct core 2D response triggering sub-
structure in all the seven cardenolides, as detailed in Figure 4.
The other two key drugs, bisacodyl and anisomycin, were differ-
ent from cardiac glycosides in terms of 2D structures, but the
Pentacle descriptors indicated potential ﬁeld similarities on ON,
OT and NT probes. These probes referred to existence of
common structural pharmacophoric features: hydrogen bonding
and shape-related features. The 3D descriptors may therefore
indicate that these drugs bind the same ion channels as the
cardenolides.

Component 3 captured protein synthesis inhibition. All drugs
in the component are known to inhibit protein synthesis but each
in a different way. The only exception, alexidine, is a derivative
of clorhexidine, which is used as an antibacterial mouth wash.
Interestingly, it has been described to have anticancer cell activity
through an unknown target (Yip et al., 2006). The model identi-
ﬁed pentacle probe ﬁelds of D2, D0 and DT (shape and
lipophilicity-related probes) that relate alexidine’s protein synthe-
sis inhibition response with the known protein synthesis
inhibitors.

Component 5 was HSP90 inhibition response. The component
contains the three similar drugs geldanamycin, tanespimycin,
alvespimycin, and on the 2D structure level dissimilar 15-delta
prostaglandin J2 (PGJ2) and puromycin. Geldanamycin and its
two analogs tanespimycin and alvespimycin are HSP90 inhibi-
tors, and the latter two have been explored in the clinic as
anticancer drugs. PGJ2 has also been described as having
anticancer activity through an unknown mechanism, causing in-
hibition of several cancer survival signals. Puromycin is reported

Fig. 4. Structure identiﬁcation in Component 1. Left: the top four FCFP4 structural fragments identiﬁed by the model as strongly relating to the
response of the drugs (right). When combined, these fragments represent the core response triggering structure steroid backbone (shaded gray) in all the

cardenolides

as an aminonucleoside antibiotic with a primary function of
terminating ribosomal protein translation. At the response
level, this component appeared to be strongly inducing a heat
shock response with many HSP and related genes being upregu—
lated (see Fig. 5, left). The expression proﬁle strongly indicated
that PG] 2 and puromycin are also inhibiting HSP90. PubChem
drug-target data demonstrate that HSP90 targets have been re-
ported as active in geldanamycin and its derivatives, while un-
tested/unspeciﬁed for both puromycin and prostaglandin.

On the structural side, the 2D descriptors conﬁrmed that pure-
mycin and prostaglandin are dissimilar to the three geldanamy-
cin analogs. However, the Pentacle descriptors clearly indicated
that N2, DN and NT ﬁelds shared a strong pattern across all the
ﬁve drugs. The patterns were only visible in features of smaller
distances of these large molecules, indicating that only a small
region of these compounds (polar atoms of all compounds) cre-
ated the activity, whereas the rest of the structure is just needed
to maintain the shape. This ﬁtted well with the observation that
the drugs are overall structurally dissimilar. At the smaller dis-
tances, the structure responsible for biological response was char-
acterized by N2: ligands hydrogen bonding capacity, DN:
hydrogen bonding and lipophilicity and NT: hydrogen bond-
ing/shape—based descriptors. In geldanamycin and prostaglandin,
this distance (see Fig. 5 where N2 descriptor is plotted) was con-
nected to polar ring atoms and more precisely corresponding
hydrogen bonding positions. These same positions, although in
a different conformational arrangement (but with almost identi-
cal distance), are critical in the binding of geldanamycin to
HSP90. Hence, while the expression data strongly argue for
PGJ2 inhibiting HSP90 activity at some level, the structural in-
formation suggests that this effect could be through a direct
binding to HSP90 enzymes.

Component SP2 was characterized by responses to a set of
corticoids, other steroids such as etynodiol, and surprisingly dif-
ferent drugs simvastatin and repaglinide. There appears to be a
dual response: an HL60-speciﬁc metabolic regulatory response
and an HL60 and PC3-selective anti-inﬂammatory response
(Fig. 6) with the MCF7 not exhibiting these responses at all,

indicating that the relevant target or signal may be selectively
expressed in HL60 and PC3 cells. Both simvastatin (a choles-
terol-lowering HMG—CoA reductase inhibitor drug) and repagli-
nide (a diabetes drug) are highly dissimilar at the 2D level when
compared with the corticosteriods, but both interestingly have
been reported to have anti-inﬂammatory activities, likely because
of targets other than the primary target(s). Once again, Pentacle
descriptors capture the underlying similarities between these
drugs through NT and N2 ﬁelds, suggesting that the common
gene expression patterns induced by the different drugs (cortico-
steroids, simvastatin and repaglinide) is a result of binding the
same targets.

4 CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION

We extended the drug response analysis paradigm from standard
QSAR, of relating drug properties and univariate responses, to
ﬁnding relationships between speciﬁc structural descriptors of
drugs with the genome-wide responses they elicit in multiple cell
lines. The task was formalized as discovering dependencies be-
tween multiple datasets and addressed using the state-of-the-art
method GFA. The approach identiﬁed structure—genomic re-
sponse relationships as underlying components of the data and
can be used as a tool for exploring such relationships from large-
scale measurement datasets.

We quantitatively validated our structure—response compo-
nents over the established chemical—biology relationships of
ChEBI and found them to be better than earlier studies (Iorio
et al., 2010; Khan et al., 2012) that did not account for separate
cell lines and advanced 3D chemical descriptors. Moreover, sev-
eral drug groups we identiﬁed were consistent with earlier stu-
dies, while several revealed interesting novel ﬁndings earlier
studies had missed, demonstrating that our approach is viable
for explorative multi-set structure—activity analysis. These novel
ﬁndings were clearly attributed to separate cell lines and
advanced 3D descriptors in our formulation. In a different set-
ting, Yera et al., (2011) found 3D similarity to be more important

for off-target identiﬁcation, and this was partially supported by
our study as well.

The discovered components revealed interesting new ﬁndings
of potential importance for revealing novel action mechanisms of
drugs. The 2D ﬁngerprints highlighted important core structural
groups primarily responsible for activity of similar drugs, such as
the identiﬁcation of the steroid backbone in cardiac glycosides
and aromatic ring in HDAC (Histone deacetylases) inhibitors.
The joint analysis of data from multiple cell lines with advanced
3D Pentacle descriptors allowed us to identify relationships

between drugs that were not known earlier. If validated, this
suggests an approach that could signiﬁcantly help in medicinal
chemistry and drug design. For example, our data led to the
identiﬁcation of a previously unknown and novel shared mech-
anism of 15-delta prostaglandin J2 (PGJ 2) and HSP90 inhibitors.
Interestingly, PGJ2 and related prostaglandin analogs have re-
peatedly been described in the literature for having anticancer
activities, but their mechanism of action has not been clariﬁed
before (Fionda et al., 2007; Hegde et al., 2011; Zimmer et al.,
2010). Furthermore, our analysis revealed that simvastatin, a
cholesterol-lowering drug, has a leukemia-speciﬁc response simi-
lar to a range of corticosteroids. This appears to be a signiﬁcant
ﬁnding as lovastatin, a close structural analog of simvastatin,
was recently shown to selectively inhibit leukemic stem cells to-
gether with several steroids (Hartwell et al., 2013).

Such systematic explorations raise the possibility for targeted
interventions and will become a growing trend in the future as
more large-scale datasets like the CMap will become available.
For drug designers, it opens up the opportunity to tailor drug
molecules to match a desired gene expression ﬁngerprint.
For medicinal chemists, it could help to increase understanding
of action mechanisms of existing drugs and revealing potential on-
label and off-label applications for use in precision medicine.

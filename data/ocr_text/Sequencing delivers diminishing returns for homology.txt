ABSTRACT

Motivation: Databases of sequenced genomes are widely used to
characterize the structure, function and evolutionary relationships of
proteins. The ability to discern such relationships is widely expected
to grow as sequencing projects provide novel information, bridging
gaps in our map of the protein universe.

Results: We have plotted our progress in protein sequencing over
the last two decades and found that the rate of novel sequence
discovery is in a sustained period of decline. Consequently, PSI-
BLAST, the most widely used method to detect remote evolutionary
relationships, which relies upon the accumulation of novel sequence
data, is now showing a plateau in performance. We interpret this
trend as signalling our approach to a representative map of the
protein universe and discuss its implications.

1 INTRODUCTION

Only a tiny fraction of the vast space of all possible protein sequences
is populated by proteins present in existing organisms. Knowledge
of these populated islands can be considered as a map of the
protein universe. As sequencing projects continue to provide new
data, the resolution of the map increases, permitting insights into
protein function and evolution. The map currently covers 1214
published genomes (Liolios et al., 2008). In comparison, there are
over 1.4 million known organisms (Leipe, 1996) while estimates
of the total number of species on earth vary between 4 and 100
million (Crandall and Buhay, 2004). Despite the exponential growth
in sequencing over the past two decades it would appear that a
comprehensive map of the protein universe will not be achievable for
many years. However, for many purposes the map need only contain
representative sequences. A substantial proportion of the current
map has been shown to be composed of very similar homologous
sequences (Li and Godzik, 2006; Li et al., 2002a; Park et al., 2000;
Suzek et al., 2007) whose diversity can be captured by far fewer
representative sequences. Acquiring a representative map of the
protein universe will be possible in a far shorter time than achieving
comprehensive coverage. Here, we investigate our progress towards
such a representative map.

sequence map. Early stages are characterized by the creation of new sequence
islands. In contrast, later stages are characterized by the population of existing
islands leading to an asymptotic approach to the complete protein map.

For the purpose of this work, we consider the protein universe to
be populated by protein sequences clustered by sequence identity
into islands of varying degrees of density. As more genomes are
sequenced, the map of the protein universe can become more
detailed either through the creation of new islands or the progressive
population of existing islands. Early stages of sequencing are
expected to be dominated by the discovery of novel sequence
islands (Fig. 1). As a complete representative map is approached an
increasing proportion of newly determined sequences are expected
to fall within existing islands in sequence space and for the creation
of new islands to become progressively less common. Often, the
evolutionary relationship between proteins is distant: in the map
representation this would be seen as points appearing far apart
within an island or even in a separate island if the map has
insufﬁcient resolution. To detect these remote relationships between
proteins, sophisticated homology detection tools are required. As
novel sequences accumulate in the database, bridging gaps in the
protein map, these tools are expected to be capable of detecting
more of these remote relationships (Lobley et al., 2009; Sandhya
et al., 2003).

Kunin et al. observed the growth in the number of islands while
incrementally adding 83 genomes consisting of 311256 protein
sequences (Kunin et al., 2003). Marsden et al. later used a larger
dataset of 633 546 sequences from 203 genomes (Marsden et al.,
2006). Both investigations showed a linear increase in the number
of islands with the addition of each genome. Since then there has
been a nearly 6—fold increase in the number of genomes sequenced.
More recent analysis (Levitt, 2009) using sequence proﬁle matches
to historical sequence databases, demonstrated that single domain
sequences are now growing slowly and appear to be saturating
in the sequence database. However, novelty in the form of the

Sequencing delivers diminishing returns for homology detection

 

re—arrangements of multi—domain architectures was shown to be
growing linearly with added sequences.

In the current study, we recreated the sequence databases of the
past two decades and through sequence clustering, estimated how
the rate of novel sequence discovery has changed over time. Our
approach considers different multi—domain architectures to lie in
different islands and shows a continued increase in the number of
novel sequence islands over time in agreement with Levitt (2009).
However, by comparing growth in novel islands to the overall
growth in sequencing we ﬁnd that the rate of discovery is in
a sustained period of decline, and predict that at least 80% of
new protein sequences will fall within existing protein islands by
approximately 2017.

The decline in the rate of novel sequence acquisition is expected
to have an impact upon remote homology detection. To investigate
this we employed PSI—BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997), an iterative
technique that uses the information in a sequence database to build
statistical models, called proﬁles, of the mutational propensities
of each position in a protein sequence of interest. In the ﬁrst
iteration, close homologues are gathered using the standard BLAST
algorithm. The alignment of these homologues to a sequence
of interest provides information on the amino acid substitutions
observed at each position. This information permits the generation
of a proﬁle that can be used to search in the next iteration.
This process can be continued, repeatedly reﬁning the proﬁle,
until no further homologues are detected. This procedure is highly
successful and detects more than twice as many homologous proteins
with high conﬁdence compared with BLAST, and has been the
standard benchmark of remote homology detection against which
new techniques are judged for the last decade. Its power stems
from information in the sequence database in the form of sequence
variation of homologues.

By recreating the sequence databases of the past it is possible
to plot the performance of PSI—BLAST in remote homology
recognition over time against a ﬁxed test set of known homologues
based on structure (Fig. 2). We show that the aforementioned decline
in the rate of novel sequence discovery is reﬂected in a plateau in
our ability to map remote homology using PSI—BLAST (Fig. 3).
We suggest that this indicates an approach to a complete
representative protein sequence map.

2 METHODS

Described here are the methods used to investigate the change in sequence
novelty over the past two decades and its effect on homology detection.
Sections 2.1 and 2.2 describe the recreation of past UniProt databases and
the acquisition of metagenomic sequences that were used as the sources of
sequence data. Section 2.3 describes the sequence—based clustering technique
used to partition the data into sequence islands which were used to assess the
change in novelty and to predict the future growth in islands. The remaining
sections describe how the effect of increased sequence data on homology
detection was investigated. Section 2.4 describes the design of the structure—
based homology test set. The method used to create PSI—BLAST proﬁles for
all sequences in the test set using the information in each sequence database
is described in Section 2.5 and the use of these proﬁles to detect remote
homologues within the test set is described in Section 2.6. In Section 2.7,
we describe a variety of analyses used to assess the source of the observed
trend. In order to investigate the effect that the order of sequencing had
on the result, the PSI—BLAST analysis was repeated with random orders of
sequence discovery. In addition, due to the possibility of a small number of

superfamilies dominating the results an analysis was performed on a per—
superfamily basis. Finally, the information content of the sequence proﬁles
created each year was analyzed in terms of the number of sequences entering
the proﬁle and their diversity. Sub—section 2.8 describes the method for
an analogous investigation to that described in Sections 2.5 and 2.6 using
HHsearch, an HMM—HMM based alignment tool, in the place of PSI—BLAST.
Finally, Section 2.9 describes a method of investigating the effect of sequence
redundancy on the PSI—BLAST results.

2.1 Recreation of past databases

The UniProt (Wu et al., 2006) databases from 1987 to 2007 were recreated
using the deposition date ﬁeld within the January 2008 UniProt_trembl.dat
ﬁle and the UniProt_trembl.fasta sequence ﬁles (available from the UniProt
FTP site). Any sequence found to be deposited in UniProt by December 31st
in any given year was included within that year’s database.

2.2 Metagenomic dataset

Metagenomic sequences were downloaded from the UniProt Metagenomic
and Environmental Sequences database (UniMES) (The UniProt
Consortium, 2009). UniMES contains data from the Global Ocean
Sampling (GOS) expedition (Yooseph et al., 2007). The downloaded ﬁle is
non—redundant to a 100% threshold (i.e. contains no identical sequences)
and contains approximately 6 million predicted sequences. A database was
created which contained the full 2007 sequence data plus this metagenomic
dataset. A 50% non—redundant version of this database was also created by
clustering with CD—HIT (see below).

2.3 Sequence clustering using CD-HIT

CD—HIT (Li and Godzik, 2006) is a programme that clusters sequence
databases according to a sequence identity threshold using a short word
ﬁltering heuristic. Representative sequences are selected from each cluster
and are used to form a new sequence database. CD—HIT is a standard tool
for creating representative databases and has been used by UniProt to create
their UniRef (Suzek et al., 2007) reduced redundancy databases.

CD—HIT uses greedy incremental clustering. First, a sequence database is
sorted according to the sequence length and the longest sequence is chosen
as the representative of the ﬁrst cluster. Every other remaining sequence is
then compared with the cluster representative and added to the cluster if the
similarity is above a certain threshold (50% identity in this study). The next

longest remaining sequence is then selected as a representative of a new
cluster and the process continues until all sequences are assigned a cluster.

CD—HIT was run on databases for every other year from 1987 to 2007 at
a threshold of 50% sequence identity. This is effectively the lower limit of
sequence identity achievable by CD—HIT, due to the high level of computer
resources required (100 CPU weeks for this data, see Section 2.10 for
hardware speciﬁcations) and the progressive drop in the efﬁciency of the
heuristic used as the threshold is reduced (Li et al., 2002b). In addition, a
combined 2007 UniProt plus UniMES (metagenomic sequence) database was
created and CD—HIT was run on this database of approximately 10 million
sequences at the same threshold of 50% identity. For each processed database,
a new database was produced, consisting of the representative sequence from
each cluster, each sharing <50% sequence identity to any other sequence.
The size of each of these representative databases provided our measure for
the number of islands.

The ratio of islands to the total number of sequences in each database was
calculated for every other year between 1987 and 2007. A power law curve
was then ﬁtted to this data and extended until 2050 (Fig. 4).

2.4 SCOP30 remote homology test set

The Structural Classiﬁcation of Proteins (SCOP) (Murzin et al., 1995)
version 1.73 was used as a gold standard of homology based on
structure. Homologous sequences sharing no >30% global sequence
similarity (SCOP30) were downloaded from ASTRAL (Brenner et al., 2000;
http://astral.berkeley.edu). These sequences were placed into homologous
groups according to superfamin membership deﬁned within the SCOP
domain classiﬁcation. A PSI—BLAST searchable binary SCOP30 sequence
database was created using the formatdb utility from the National Center for
Biotechnology Information. This static sequence database is used for testing
the power of proﬁles constructed for each year (Section 2.6 below).

2.5 Construction of database speciﬁc PSI-BLAST
proﬁles

Each sequence within the SCOP30 test set was searched against each of the
recreated UniProt databases from 1987 to 2007 using four iterations of PSI—
BLAST with an inclusion threshold (—h parameter) of 0.001. At the end of
the fourth iteration, a checkpoint ﬁle and PSSM was output. This resulted in
a sequence proﬁle for each SCOP30 sequence (6982 sequences) from each
of the 21 recreated (1987—2007) databases (146 622 proﬁles in total) (Fig. 2).
Thus, for each year it is possible to test the performance of PSI—BLAST on
a ﬁxed homology test set (SCOP30).

To subsequently test the robustness of our result, PSI—BLAST proﬁles
were also output from 2, 3 and 5 iterations. The results of which are shown
in Supplementary Figure S1. For the system with the consistently highest
homologue detection rate (four iterations), another run was made with a
more stringent inclusion threshold of 10‘6 (Supplementary Fig. S2). The
same trend was observed under all these conditions.

2.6 Identiﬁcation of remote homologies within the
SCOP30 test set

For each year there are 6982 PSI—BLAST proﬁles corresponding to each
of the SCOP30 sequences. Each of these proﬁles was searched against the
same static SCOP30 database (described in Section 2.5) (Fig. 2). This was
accomplished by initiating a single iteration of PSI—BLAST, restarting using
the checkpoint ﬁles previously created. For example, the SCOP30 sequence
dlxquv will be searched against the full SCOP30 database 21 times, each
search using a proﬁle previously recreated from each recreated sequence
database. In this way, the utility of each database in providing the sequence
data required for remote homology detection can be assessed. Furthermore,
by using the same SCOP30 database, instead of appending the test set to
the recreated databases, the size of the scanned database remained constant
and therefore did not affect the E—value score. The number of SCOP30

sequences belonging to the same superfamin as the query below an E—value
threshold of 0.1 was recorded (see Section 3.3 and Fig. 3c). The proportion
of predictions that were false positives at this threshold varied across the
years between 3.3% and 6.9% with a mean of 5.1%. To ensure that the
results were not dominated by a small number of larger superfamilies, the
number of homologues detected after incrementally removing the largest
superfamilies from the analysis (largest 5, 10, 20 and 30 superfamilies) was
recorded (Supplementary Fig. S3). In addition, the percentage of all possible
homologues found was calculated for all superfamilies and the results were
averaged (Supplementary Fig. S4).

2.7 Proﬁle analysis over time

It is possible that the performance of PSI—BLAST over time is a result of the
order of discovery of sequences. For example, later databases might contain
certain sequences that adversely affect homology detection by inducing drift
in the searching by pollution of the proﬁle with non—homologous sequences.
Alternatively, there may be years when particularly novel organisms have
been sequenced which could lead to sudden peaks in performance. To test
this, the datasets were recreated with randomized orders of discovery, while
ﬁxing the number of sequences for a given year. The same trend was observed
(Supplementary Fig. SS). It is also possible that increases in database size
cause changes in the E —values returned by PSI—BLAST resulting in differing
number of sequences entering proﬁles each year. The number of sequences
entering proﬁles for each year was calculated and is shown in Supplementary
Figure S6. Finally, the diversity of the resultant proﬁles for each year was
calculated using the NEFF measure (Casbon and Saqi, 2004; Peng and
Xu, 2010; Sadreyev and Grishin, 2004). The NEFF, or effective number of
sequences in each alignment, is calculated as the exponential of negative
entropy averaged over all columns of the alignment, resulting in a real
value ranging from 1 to 20 (i.e. the number of amino acid types in nature).
The larger NEFF is, the more diverse the sequence proﬁles. Results are
shown in Supplementary Figure S7. NEFF values for each proﬁle were
provided by HHsearch after PSI—BLAST proﬁles were converted into HMMS
(Section 2.8).

2.8 HHsearch

An analogous experiment to that conducted with PSI—BLAST
(Section 2.7—2.9) was conducted using HHsearch (deing, 2005), a
highly sensitive sequence alignment method based on the pairwise
comparison of proﬁle Hidden Markov Models (HMMS). An HMM was
created for each sequence in the SCOP30 test set using each UNIPROT
database (1987—2007). These HMMs are analogous to the PSI—BLAST
proﬁles constructed in Section 2.6. Two methods of HMM construction
were used: (i) the default method supplied by the HHsearch package and
(ii) a method that directly converts the PSI—BLAST proﬁles into HMMs.
For the ﬁrst method, the HMMs were built using the ‘buildali.pl’ script,
downloaded as part of the HHsearch package from ftp://toolkit.lmb.uni—
muenchen.de/HHsearch/. Buildali.pl constructs a multiple sequence
alignment from a sequence database using a modiﬁed version of PSI—
BLAST that prunes the high—scoring segment pair ends that do not achieve
certain scoring criteria. This modiﬁcation suppresses proﬁle corruption
coming from the ends of domains. The PSI—BLAST parameters used by
the buildali.pl script in the creation of the HMMs were identical to those
used in the PSI—BLAST runs (four iterations with an inclusion threshold
of 0.001). For the second method, HMMs were generated by directly
converting the PSI—BLAST proﬁles described in Section 2.6 into HMMs
(using alignhits.pl and hhmake from the HHsearch package) ensuring
that the same raw data was input both to PSI—BLAST and HHsearch. No
secondary structure information was used in the construction of the HMMs.
The HMMs generated for each SCOP30 sequence in each year were then
concatenated into an HMM database. For each year, an all against all search
of the HMMs was conducted and all hits within the same superfamin
with a conﬁdence (HHsearch returned probability) >95% were recorded.

Sequencing delivers diminishing returns for homology detection

 

The proportion of predictions that were false positives at this threshold
varied between 0.2% and 4.6% over the years with a mean of 2.6%. NEFF
(see Section 2.7) values were calculated for each proﬁle during this stage.
The comparison of results using both methods is shown in Supplementary
Figure S8.

2.9 Homology detection using representative databases
To investigate the potential impact on remote homology detection of reducing
sequence redundancy, the same PSIBLAST and HHsearch procedures
described in Sections 2.7 and 2.9 were applied to the far smaller
representative sequence databases formed from the island representatives
that were created by CD—HIT (Supplementary Fig. S9).

2.10 Hardware

All analyses were performed on a heterogeneous computing cluster of
approximately 250AMD cores with an average of 2.2GHz and 2GB
RAM per core. The entire analysis using the PSI—BLAST, CD—HIT and
HHsearch distributions took approximately 10 CPU years with this hardware
speciﬁcation.

3 RESULTS

3.1 The rate of novel island formation is in decline

We deﬁne a sequence island as a set of proteins that share >50%
global sequence identity to the largest sequence in the island. For
each year, the database was clustered into such islands using the
programme CD—HIT (Li and Godzik, 2006) (see Section 2.3). The
size of these clustered databases is considerably reduced (by 60%
on average) and represents an estimate of the number of sequence
islands for each year. This measure of the number of sequence
islands is a highly conservative upper estimate for two reasons:
ﬁrst, homologous protein domains may often share far lower—less
than 25% (Pearson and Sierk, 2005)—sequence identity than the
lowest threshold achievable by the clustering method. Secondly, the
clustering technique works at the level of whole proteins and so does
not take into account domain combinations. Brieﬂy, this means that
two multi—domain proteins that share one or more domains are placed
in different clusters or islands if their domains are in a different
order or there is at least one domain that they do not share. Thus,
homologous domains will often fall into separate clusters. It has
been previously shown that a large proportion of protein novelty is
seen in the arrangement of domains in multi—domain proteins (Levitt,
2009). This novelty will therefore be seen in this analysis as new
islands where the combination of domains is not already present in
the database.

The recreated databases demonstrate exponential growth,
expanding from approximately 5000 sequences in 1987 to
approximately 4 million by the end of 2007 (Fig. 3a). In each
database, the number of sequence islands steadily increases but is
far smaller than the total number of sequences. This agrees with
previous observations that sequence databases contain a substantial
amount of redundancy in the form of closely related homologues
with high sequence similarity (Li et al., 2002a; Park et al., 2000;
Suzek et al., 2007). While previous observations of redundant
information have been focused on a single static database, the
analysis presented here is broader. By comparing the size of the
clustered and unclustered databases, it is possible to calculate how
the rate of novel island discovery is changing over time (Fig. 3a
and b). From 1987 to 1995, the ratio of the number of islands to

space over the last two decades. All three plots use the same horizontal axis.
2007 plus GOS indicates the combination of the 2007 sequence database
with the Global Ocean Survey metagenomics data. (a) The protein sequence
database (black bars) has grown exponentially over the past two decades. A
much smaller increase is seen in the number of sequence islands (grey bars)
at a level of 50% sequence identity. This is particularly the case with the
metagenomic data (striped) which appears to have high redundancy. Note
that the vertical axis uses a different scale for the top and bottom halves,
in order to show growth both in the early sequence databases and the more
recent ones. (b) The black line indicates the ratio of the number of islands to
the total number of sequences, representing the rate of novel island discovery.
Until 1995 this rate was steady or growing. Since that time this rate has
been falling. There is a sharp drop on the addition of metagenomic data.
(c) This plot shows the change in the ability of PSI—BLAST (black line)
and HHsearch (grey line) to detect homology using proﬁles built from the
databases of each year. It is clear that the more computationally intense
HHsearch detects more homologues in the majority of cases. Although there
is a general improvement in both methods over time, this improvement slows
and in the case of PSI—BLAST, it plateaus and even begins to decline. The
addition of metagenomic data adversely affects both methods.

the total number of sequences increases each year. After this point,
however, the rate is in constant decline. In 1995, the number of
islands was approximately half of the total number of sequences,
and by 2007 this ﬁgure has fallen to just over a third.

An initial explanation for this trend is bias in sequencing
projects towards highly similar organisms. To investigate this
effect, the analysis was extended using metagenomic data derived

Fig. 4. A prediction of future island growth is made by ﬁtting a power law

to 2007. The GOS metagenomic data is not included in our projection. We

from environmental sequencing. Metagenomic projects sample a
substantial diversity of extant sequences across habitats. In this
work, the Global Ocean Survey (Yooseph et al., 2007) data were
merged with the 2007 UniProt sequence database (Sections 2.2
and 2.3) and the novel sequence island contribution was calculated
(Fig. 3a and b, rightmost sample). An even steeper decline in the rate
of novel island discovery than seen to date is observed. However, the
implications of this result are ambiguous. The Global Ocean Survey
has sampled environments across the world, albeit only within the
oceans. In addition, there are likely to be biases in the locations
sampled and the ability to sequence those samples. Finally, the
metagenomic dataset is likely to contain a substantial number of
artefactual sequences (Li et al., 2008), which will artiﬁcially increase
the total number of sequences and islands leading to an overestimate
of the rate of novel island discovery. It is thus premature to suggest
that further metagenomic data could not reverse the trend observed
in this work.

3.2 Prediction of future island growth

These results show an increasing proportion of newly determined
sequences falling within existing islands, which may indicate an
approach to the representative map of the protein universe. If
this trend continues, by approximately 2017 at least 80% of new
sequences will fall within an existing island (Fig. 4) that is, have
a sequence identity >50% with sequences already present in the
database. This does not imply that the remaining 20% are entirely
novel. This is a conservative estimate because the analysis does not
cluster together sequences with <50% sequence identity that may
be homologous, or those that are simple rearrangements of the same
set of domains.

3.3 Improvements in remote homology detection are
slowing or declining

This trend has important implications for the role of sequence—based
homology detection in characterizing the structure, function and
evolutionary relationships of a protein. Increases in the power of
methods such as PSI—BLAST to detect remote homology currently
rely on the steady discovery of novel sequence information.
If, as indicated above, this rate of novel sequence discovery is
declining, then one may expect this to be reﬂected in a slowing in

improvements in the detection of remote homology. To investigate
this, the performance of PSI—BLAST on the sequence databases of
the past 20 years was determined.

We asked whether there has been an improvement over time in the
performance of PSI—BLAST in identifying remote homologues in a
set of 6982 proteins from the Structural Classiﬁcation of Proteins
(SCOP) (Murzin et al., 1995) sharing less than 30% sequence
identity (SCOP30). SCOP is a database of protein structural domains
curated by experts that provides an authoritative classiﬁcation of
remote homologues on the basis of sequence and known structure,
exploiting the fact that structure is more conserved than sequence
in evolution. PSI—BLAST proﬁles were created for each of these
sequences by scanning against each database from 1987 to 2007.
Each sequence proﬁle was then used to search the same static
SCOP30 sequence database and the number of detected homologues
was recorded (see Section 2.5—2.6, Fig. 2). In contrast to the CD—
HIT clustering method, PSI—BLAST is able to routinely identify
relationships with <25% sequence identity and as it operates on
local alignments, and is thus capable of considering independent
domains.

As expected, in the early phases of database growth a steady
rise in remote homology detection is observed (Fig. 30). However,
this improvement does not directly scale with the massive increase
in available sequences particularly evident in the last decade.
Moreover, homology detection plateaus in 2004 and subsequently
shows a slight decline. To determine the cause of this slowing and
decline, a variety of analyses were undertaken.

3.4 Potential causes of the observed decline

To control for the possibility that the order of deposition of
the proteins may affect homology detection, this order was
randomized while holding the database size ﬁxed for each year. This
demonstrated the same trend (Supplementary Fig. SS). As sequence
databases increase in size, so do the E —values for a given alignment
with the same score. It is therefore possible that more recent, larger
databases are performing more poorly as fewer hits are included
in alignments, resulting in less information entering the proﬁles. To
investigate this, the number of sequences entering the proﬁle of each
sequence for each year was calculated. Supplementary Figure S6
shows that the number of sequences being included in proﬁles is
growing exponentially, mirroring the growth in sequence data.

It is also possible that, although the number of sequences entering
the proﬁles is increasing, the diversity of sequences in the proﬁle
is decreasing, thus reducing the power of the proﬁle to detect
remote homologues. Using the NEFF measure of sequence diversity
described in Section 2.7, we observe a continued increase in the
effective number of sequences throughout the 20 years of database
growth, indicating that sequence diversity is continuing to increase
in the proﬁles (Supplementary Fig. S7). However, in comparison
with the absolute number of sequences entering the proﬁle, the
diversity is slowing rapidly.

It is possible that the trend observed in this analysis may be
caused by a small number of protein superfamilies that contain many
members. Performing the same analysis while removing the largest
5, 10, 20 and 30 superfamilies, continues to show the same trend of
a slowing in improvements of homology detection. However, it is
important to note that the decline seen in PSI—BLAST performance
is no longer apparent (Supplementary Fig. S3).

Sequencing delivers diminishing returns for homology detection

 

If a lack of sequence diversity is responsible for the observed
trend, it may be expected that novel sources of sequence data from
metagenomics would alleviate the problem. The same method was
applied to the combined 2007 UniProt and UniMES metagenomic
databases (Fig. 3c, rightmost sample) and substantially fewer
homologues were detected from SCOP30. As discussed earlier, this
is likely to be due to the large number of hypothetical sequences
and sequence fragments within metagenomic datasets, and potential
biases in sampling in sequencing, which have previously been shown
to adversely affect the quality of PSI—BLAST proﬁles (Tress et al.,
2006).

Many of the most successful current approaches for remote
homology detection are based on matching HMMs and such methods
achieve substantially superior performance to PSI—BLAST. The
same historical analysis was performed with a typical example
of such a programme, HHsearch (Seding, 2005). While not
plateauing, performance improvements over time are slowing, and
this slowing is particularly evident when compared with the scale
of sequence discovery (Fig. 30). Almost identical results are seen
for both the HMM construction methods described in Section 2.8
(Supplementary Fig. S8).

The combination of exponential database growth with a decline in
the rate of novel sequence acquisition implies a concomitant increase
in redundancy in the database. Past investigations have implicated
sequence redundancy and sub—optimal sequence weighting as having
a negative effect on homology detection using PSI—BLAST (Li
et al., 2002a; Park et al., 2000). This affect is particularly evident in
large diverse protein superfamilies where highly redundant families
can trap sequence proﬁles, stopping them from detecting more
remote superfamin relationships (Li et al., 2002a). Thus, the trend
reported here might be the result of algorithmic problems of PSI—
BLAST and to a lesser extent HHsearch, in handling large amounts
of redundancy. The entire analysis was repeated using databases
from each year that have had redundancy reduced by CD—HIT to
<50% sequence identity. These databases are typically 60% of the
size of the full database from which they were derived. Using
these databases, we observe a slight improvement in recognition
from 1997 to 2007 and the decline in PSI—BLAST performance is
no longer apparent (Supplementary Fig. S9). However, the same
trend of a plateau in performance is observed. This indicates
that although high levels of sequence redundancy are a factor
in the performance of these techniques, it is not the primary
cause of the overall observed trend. This is compatible with the
results obtained when the largest superfamilies were removed
from the analysis. These superfamilies are likely to contain the
most amount of redundancy and removing them eliminates the
reduction in performance while maintaining the plateau. Due to the
previously discussed limitations of the clustering method, it was not
possible to determine whether using representative database with
mutual sequence identity <50% would improve homology detection
further. However, in a previous investigation into representative
databases and homology detection, databases with <50% sequence
redundancy provided worse performance (Park et al., 2000).

4 DISCUSSION

Our map of the protein universe is reliant on the sequences available
from various sequencing projects. As novel data is acquired, the
resolution of this map is expected to increase and eventually become

a global map fully representing the space of all existing sequences.
Obtaining a representative map will be achievable long before we
have sequenced all of Earth’s biodiversity because of the similarities
inherent in proteins due to sharing a common evolutionary origin.
These similarities mean that proteins will exist in islands, the
distribution, shape and density of which reﬂect their relationship
to each other. When a point is reached where any new sequence
can be placed in a pre—existing island we will have obtained the
representative map. In this study, we investigated the progress
towards such a map over the last 20 years of sequence data
acquisition.

By comparing the number of islands to the absolute number of
added sequences over time we show that the rate of novel island
discovery is in a sustained period of decline. An ever—increasing
proportion of newly sequenced genomes are highly similar to
proteins already in the database. Thus, the general structure of the
sequence map is changing more slowly as it is dominated by those
protein families common to a wide range of species. This is not to
say that novel sequences are no longer being found. It is clear from
Figure 3a that the number of islands continues to increase to the
present day. However, the effect of these sequences on the global
picture of sequence space is diminishing.

Methods for remote homology detection such as PSI—BLAST
are able to routinely identify relationships with sequence identity
<25%. Being able to detect these remote relationships is vital to
our ability to map the protein universe and predict the function
and structure of proteins. The PSI—BLAST paper (Altschul et al.,
1997) has over 30 000 citations in the literature making it the
most highly cited of the past decade. This reﬂects the crucial role
played by remote homology detection for the accurateinference
of the relationships between protein sequence, structure, function
and evolution. It has been assumed (Lobley et al., 2009; Sandhya
et al., 2003) that the continued growth of the sequence database will
bring with it a steady improvement in our ability to detect remote
homology with methods such as PSI—BLAST. Here, we have shown
that the slowing in the gain of novel sequence data is associated
with a plateau in our ability to detect remote homologues with
PSI—BLAST.

The recent decline in PSI—BLAST performance (since 2004) is
of particular importance. Here, we eliminated this decline by either
the removal of the most populated superfamilies from the analysis
or by a global reduction in sequence redundancy in the databases.
Thus, the decline appears to be related to errors regarding the
handling of redundant data that have been previously identiﬁed
(Li et al., 2002a; Park et al., 2000). Given the expectation of
continued exponential growth in the sequence database, problems
caused by redundancy are expected to become more acute. In
addition, this growth is substantially increasing the computational
burden of sequence analysis faster than progress in computational
power. The removal of sequence redundancy can alleviate both
of these issues. However, this approach does not alter the overall
trend of substantial slowing or a plateau in performance over recent
years.

The utility of representative databases for remote homology
detection will apply outside of the test set used here. For example, in
the CASP8 assessment the Phyre structure prediction server (Kelley
and Sternberg, 2009) used sequence proﬁles built using a 50% non—
redundant sequence database similar to that described here and was
placed in the top four servers (Cozzetto et al., 2009).

One of the sources of information on which powerful methods of
remote homology detection rely is bridging sequences that connect
distant—related protein families. If, as it appears, we are approaching
a representative picture of the global sequence map, then the
rate of discovery of such bridging sequences will progressively
decline while the vast majority of sequences will fall into pre—
existing clusters. There are obvious parallels between these bridging
sequences and the ‘missing links’ in paleontology. As with the
missing links, many of these bridging sequences will be transitional
forms, or present in extinct lineages that will never be sequenced.
Although sequence space is continuous, its population by evolution
is not.

That our current sampling of sequence space may already be
approaching a representative map may not be wholly surprising.
In terms of protein 3D structure, such a map appears to be near
completion. Fold space, the space of distinct 3D protein topologies,
appears to be populated by a relatively small number of protein
folds, variously estimated at between 1000 and 10000 (Wolf et al,
2000). Although there is some debate regarding the discreteness
or continuity of fold space, it is clear that the majority of protein
structures fall within a limited range of fold islands (Sadreyev et al,
2009). With the aid of structural genomics initiatives, the number
of experimentally determined protein structures has been growing
rapidly while the rate of novel fold discovery is slowing considerably
(Levitt, 2009). This indicates our view of fold space is changing ever
more slowly and that we are approaching a full representation of the
protein structural repertoire (Zhang et al, 2006).

Two primary factors have governed our progress to date in
remote homology detection and the insights it generates into the
relationships between protein sequence, structure, function and
evolution: novel algorithm development and the growth in available
sequence information. The evidence presented here suggests that
the rate of accumulation of sequences that are sufﬁciently novel
to enable detection of new remotely homologous relationships is
diminishing. If transient bridging sequences are no longer present
in extant species, it may now be necessary to focus attention on
attempts to generate these missing links artiﬁcially. Some groups
have created extra diversity in the sequence databases by creating
artiﬁcial sequences using structural and functional constraints (Pei
et al, 2003) or using phylogenies as a guide to re—create ancestral
sequences (Cai et al, 2004). When these sequences are added to
sequence proﬁles, an improvement is seen in remote homology
detection.

It is important to recognize that the ﬁndings reported here could be
modiﬁed by the sequencing of radically different organisms to those
already analyzed. Unarguably, sequencing projects demonstrate
some degree of bias in their choice of organism to sequence
(Kyrpides, 2009) and this may equally apply to metagenomics
projects. Although the number of unique protein domain sequences
is vast, it is nonetheless ﬁnite. It is inevitable that at some point
the discovery of truly novel sequences will become an extremely
rare event and eventually all but cease. The analysis presented
here suggests that sequencing is already beginning to approach a
representative map of the protein universe.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Images containing spatial expression patterns illuminate
the roles of different genes during embryogenesis. In order to
generate initial clues to regulatory interactions, biologists frequently
need to know the set of genes expressed at the same time at
specific locations in a developing embryo, as well as related research
publications. However, text-based mining of image annotations and
research articles cannot produce all relevant results, because the
primary data are images that exist as graphical objects. We have
developed a unique knowledge base (FlyExpress) to facilitate visual
mining of images from Drosophila melanogaster embryogenesis.
By clicking on specific locations in pictures of fly embryos from
different stages of development and different visual projections,
users can produce a list of genes and publications instantly. In
FlyExpress, each queryable embryo picture is a heat-map that
captures the expression patterns of more than 4500 genes and
more than 2600 published articles. In addition, one can view spatial
patterns for particular genes over time as well as find other genes
with similar expression patterns at a given developmental stage.
Therefore, FlyExpress is a unique tool for mining spatiotemporal
expression patterns in a format readily accessible to the scientific
community.

Spatial gene expression patterns are the lingua franca of
developmental biology and Drosophila melanogaster is a canonical
model organism for understanding animal development. More than
one hundred thousand images containing gene expression patterns
have been published in research articles that have used low and
high—throughput techniques (Kumar et al., 2002; Lecuyer et al.,
2007; Tomancak et al., 2002). With the increase in the volume
of information for spatiotemporal expression patterns, scientists

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

have an unprecedented opportunity to identify co—regulated genes
by comparing spatial expression proﬁles, whose similarity is the
ﬁrst signiﬁcant clue about potential joint roles in developmental
processes. With the increasing size of image datasets, such spatial
pattern comparisons have become increasingly more useful, because
genes with similar and overlapping patterns can now be found with
a much higher probability, for example, to predict functions for new
genes or to understand newly discovered patterns for existing genes.
However, classical manual inspection of spatial patterns for matches
does not scale well for such large datasets, which in turn hampers the
discovery of gene interactions and hypotheses generation. Computer
assisted approaches using annotations of images with textual
controlled vocabulary, while useful, are subject to serious limitations
because it is virtually impossible to describe all aspects of a spatial
pattern by words alone. Furthermore, the text of published literature
rarely contains controlled vocabulary descriptions of spatial patterns
and Google—like text searches produce limited results.

We have developed a unique resource for mining the gene
expression patterns visually for a given developmental stage and
visual projection. This is intended to enable biologists to interrogate
speciﬁc coordinates in a developing embryo and to quickly reveal
genes expressed at that location (Fig. 1A) as well as a list
of published research articles that contain spatiotemporal gene
expression at the selected location (Fig. 1B). A user can select
multiple locations simultaneously, and the genes and publications
are ranked by the number of locations. The outcome is a set of links
to individual gene expression pattern images as well as publications.

For each developmental stage and visual projection, the
user is presented with a global view of gene activity
[Genomewide—Expression—Maps, (GEMs)]. They are constructed by
the aggregation and normalization of spatial expression patterns
that share the same developmental stage and view (see Methods
in Konikoff et al. 2011). The normalized spatial aggregates are then
rendered into heat—maps with the darkest regions showing the largest
numbers of expressed genes. Using this procedure we generated 18
GEMs from 48 190 images for Tomancak et al. (2002) data (BDGP;
3 views X 6 stage ranges; Fig. 1A), 15 GEMs from 30 095 images for
Lecuyer et al. (2007) data (Fly—FISH; 3 views X 5 stage ranges), and
44 GEMs for 5977 images from more than 2600 published articles

Fig. 1. Visual discovery tools in FlyExpress. (A) The user selects a lateral GEM for stage range 9—10, clicks on several points on the GEM to generate a
list of genes with expression present, selects a gene of interest from the list to generate a list of embryo images for this gene, and (C) uses BESTi search to
generate a list of embryo images and their genes with similar patterns of expression. (B) The user selects a lateral PubMed GEM for stage 10, and clicks on
several points on the GEM to generate a list of publications with images showing expression at the selected locations.

(PubMed publications, years 1980—2006; Fig. 1B). By the end of
this year, we expect to have over 20 000 images in PubMed GEMs.

To build these GEMs, we developed a digital library of
expression images in which all the images and expression patterns
have been size standardized and aligned, a prerequisite for
biologically meaningful comparison of spatial expression patterns
and synthesizing information across genes and publications. For all
the data, we determined the anatomical view of each image, because
comparisons are not meaningful for images with different views (e.g.
lateral versus ventral). In this work, we have preserved the original
biological stage range annotations by the authors of the data, which
leads to three types of GEMs (BDGP, Fly—FISH, PubMed). In the
future, we plan to assign individual stages to all the images, which
will enable users to query all the data through integrated GEMs.
Unlike the high—throughput data (B DGP and FlyFISH), images from
PubMed data were manually annotated by our team of curators.
We are continuing to add images from more recent articles and
developing systems for authors to directly submit their data to our
resource for inclusion.

In addition to the GEM—based data mining, FlyExpress provides
facilities to display expression patterns for any gene and a tool to
identify co—expressed and, thus potentially co—regulated, genes by
searching for other genes with similar or overlapping expression
proﬁles by using the Basic Expression Search Tool for Images
(BESTi), e.g. Kumar et al. (2002). In the output, genes are sorted
based on their spatial similarity score with the query proﬁle
and the probability of randomly (by chance) ﬁnding a match
with a given S—score or better (P—value; methods described in
Konikoff et al., 2011). In summary, FlyExpress addresses an urgent

need to standardize and summarize image data from Drosophila
embryogenesis in order to facilitate the generation of novel gene
interaction hypotheses and accelerate biological discovery. And, it
provides a template for creating similar image searchable databases
of gene expression patterns from other developmental model
systems.

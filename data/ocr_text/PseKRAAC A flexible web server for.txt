Abstract

Summary: The reduced amino acids perform powerful ability for both simplifying protein complexity and identifying func-
tional conserved regions. However, dealing with different protein problems may need different kinds of cluster methods.
Encouraged by the success of pseudo-amino acid composition (PseAAC) algorithm, we developed a freely available web
sewer, called PseKRAAC (The pseudo K-tuple reduced amino acids composition). By implementing reduced amino acid
alphabets, the protein complexity can be significantly simplified, which leads to decrease chance of overfitting, lower
computational handicap, and reduce information redundancy. PseKRAAC delivers more capability for protein research by
incorporating three crucial parameters that describes protein composition. Users can easily generate many different
modes of PseKRAAC tailored to their needs by selecting various reduced amino acids alphabets and other characteristic
parameters. It is anticipated that the PseKRAAC web server will become a very useful tool in computational proteomics

and protein sequence analysis.

1 Introduction

With the emergence of big data in the post-genomic age, an enormous amount
of data had been generated, which requires efﬁcient computational methods
for rapid and effective identiﬁcation of biological features contained in se-
quences(Chen, et al., 2015) . Even more so in the study of proteomics, be-
cause of the structure of protein exhibits more complexity when compared to
nucleotide, due to the possible 20 amino acid peptides to the 4 nucleic bases.
Therefore, the complexity and information content are expanded exponential-
ly when polypeptides are formed. Also, protein sequence vary widely in
length, which poses additional difﬁculty for incorporating the sequence-order
information consistently in both dataset construction and algorithm formula-
tion.

To overcome these obstacles, the pseudo-amino acid composition (Pse-
AAC) algorithm was proposed in the year 2001(Chou, 2001). This concept
has been widely utilized in nearly all areas of computational proteomics, and
was selected as one of the key topics in “Molecular Science for Drug Devel-
opment and Biomedicine”(Zhong and Zhou, 2014). Encouraged by the suc-
cess of this idea, various approaches similar to PseAAC had been simulated to
deal with problems in protein and protein-related systems, including three
powerful software programs for generating different modes of PseAAC: Pse-
AAC-Builder(Du, et al., 2012), propy(Cao, et al., 2013), PseAAC-
General(Du, et al., 2014) and Pse-in-One(Liu, et al., 2015).

When dealing with extremely large dimensions can potentially cause over-
ﬁtting or high-dimension disaster Wang, et al., 2016), restrict by computation
handicap, and increase information redundancy, which results in bad predic-
tion accuracy. To solve this problem, we present a convenient approaches
based on the idea of pseudo reduced amino acid composition (PseRAAC), and
provide a ﬂexible and user-friendly web server for pseudo K—tuple reduced
amino acids composition (PseKRAAC) (http://bigdata.imu.edu.cn/ psekraac),
where users can easily generate many different modes of PseKRAAC tailored
to their needs by selecting various reduced amino acids alphabets and other
characteristic parameters.

2 Reduced amino acids alphabets

Based on physicochemical features or evolutionary relationships, amino acids
residues can be clustered into groups because they serve similar structural or
functional roles in proteinsONang and Wang, 1999). The reduced amino acids
not only simplify the complexity of the protein system, but also improve the
ability in ﬁnding structurally conserved regions and the structural similarity of
entire proteins(Peterson, et al., 2009). In recent years, the alphabet reduction
techniques play high potential roles for enhancing the power in dealing with
protein sequence analysis(Supplementary Data)(Feng, et al., 2013; Liu, et al.,
2015; Liu, et al., 2014). Therefore, it is reasonable to use the reduced amino
acids alphabets to formulate PseKRAAC for protein sequences. Here, 16

types of reduced amino acid alphabets were proposed to generate various
different modes of PseRAAC(Table 1)(Liu, et al., 2015).

3 Reduced amino acid composition

The proposed server can generate two different types of PseKRAAC for pro-
tein sequences analysis: I. g-gap and II. lt—correlation PseKRAAC(Chou,
2001). Suppose a protein sequence P with L amino acid residues as follows,
P = R1R2R3R4R5 ...RL_3RL_2RL_1RL
where R1 represents the amino acid residue at the sequence position 1, R2
represents the amino acid residue at position 2 and so on. For each K-tuple of
reduced amino acid cluster (RAAC), the feature vector of the protein se-
quence contains RAACK dimensions.
1. g—gap PseKRAAC

The g-gap PseKRAAC is used to represent a protein sequence with a vector
containing RAACK components, where g represents the gap between each K-
tuple peptides(Liu, et al., 2015; Wang, et al., 2016). A g-gap of n reﬂects the
sequence-order information for all dipeptides with the starting residues sepa-
rated by n residues. Supplementary Figure 1A shows the schematic drawing
of g-gap deﬁnition of dipeptide (K=2).

II. lt-correlation PseKRAAC

The X-correlation PseKRAAC, also called parallel correlation PseKRAAC,
is used to represent a protein sequence with a vector containing RAACK com-
ponents, where l» is an integer that represents the correlation tier, and is less
than L — K. The n’h-tier correlation factor OFn) reﬂects the sequence-order
correlation between n’h most nearest residue. Supplementary Figure 1B shows
the schematic drawing of X-correlation deﬁnition of dipeptide (K=2).

4 Server description

A step-by-step server guide on how to use PseKRAAC can refer to the Sup-
plementary Data. Compared to the original Chou’s PseAAC server,
PseKRAAC server offers following important improvements and advantages:
First, by implementing the concept of reduced amino acid alphabet for amino
acid clustering, the complexity of protein composition is signiﬁcantly simpli-
ﬁed, which leads to decrease chance of overﬁtting, lower computational hand-
icap, and reduce information redundancy.

Also, PseKRAAC delivers more capability for protein research by incorpo-
rating three crucial parameters that describes protein composition: K-tuple
peptide functionality for K up to 3, lt-correlation PseKRAAC, and g-gap
PseKRAAC for protein characterization. Users can increase the 9» value in
PseAAC webserver to cover more global sequence-pattem effects or increase
the K value to count more local sequence-pattem effects. Finally, PseKRAAC
provides easier application for inputting sequences by accepting protein se-
quences in FASTA format via directly enter into the input text box or upload

it as a FASTA ﬁle. The server is also capable of outputting result ﬁles in
LIBSVM, CSV and FASTA format for further analysis. When uploading
FASTA outputting ﬁles to other PseAAC webservers, the user can easily
generating more various modes of PseAAC(Chou, 2005).

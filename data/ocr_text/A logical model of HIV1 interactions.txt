Abstract

Motivation: Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV—1) hijacks host cellular processes to repli—
cate within its host. Through interactions with host proteins, it perturbs and interrupts signaling
pathways that alter key cellular functions. Although networks of viral—host interactions have been
relatively well characterized, the dynamics of the perturbation process is poorly understood.
Dynamic models of infection have the potential to provide insights into the HIV—1 host interaction.
Results: We employed a logical signal flow network to model the dynamic interactions between
HIV—1 proteins and key human signal transduction pathways necessary for activation of CD4+ T
lymphocytes. We integrated viral—host interaction and host signal transduction data into a dynamic
logical model comprised of 137 nodes (16 HIV—1 and 121 human proteins) and 336 interactions col—
lected from the HIV—1 Human Interaction Database. The model reproduced expected patterns of
T—cell activation, co—stimulation and co—inhibition. After simulations, we identified 26 host cell
factors, including MAPK1&3, Ikkb—Ikky—Ikka and PKA, which contribute to the net activation or inhib—
ition of viral proteins. Through in silico knockouts, the model identified a further nine host cell
factors, including members of the PI3K signalling pathway that are essential to viral replication.
Simulation results intersected with the findings of three siRNA gene knockout studies and identi—
fied potential drug targets. Our results demonstrate how viral infection causes the cell to lose
control of its signalling system. Logical Boolean modelling therefore provides a useful approach
for analysing the dynamics of host—viral interactions with potential applications for drug discovery.

1 Introduction

Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV—1) is the pathogenic
agent responsible for acquired immune deficiency syndrome. HIV-1
cannot replicate on its own, requiring host cellular machinery to re-
produce. The virus accomplishes this by interacting with its host via
thousands of highly specific molecular interactions (Fu et 61]., 2009;
Ptak et 61]., 2008). These interactions constitute a complex network
that drives cellular functions to viral—favourable conditions and
cause a host response to infection, altering the normal cellular func-
tioning of the host system. The HIV—1, host cell factor interaction
network is complicated with numerous direct and indirect

interactions involving viral—viral factors, viral—host cell factors and
host—host cell factor interactions in the exploited host cellular sys—
tems (Pinney et 61]., 2009). A primary goal of HIV—1 research is to
obtain a detailed and coherent understanding of infection and viral
replication. Critical to this goal is an understanding of viral—host
interactions, the host’s immune response and anti—viral mechanisms
that play key roles in combating infection. This network of inter-
actions may provide valuable insights into the development of treat—
ment regimes and the identification of novel drug targets (Fu et 61].,
2009; Nikolsky et 61]., 2005; Ptak et 61]., 2008). Extensive HIV—1,
human protein interaction data have been collated in the HIV—1

Human Interaction Database (HHID). This resource gives detailed
descriptions of experiments on HIV—1 host molecular interactions
curated from the primary literature. Each interaction is recorded,
described and linked to the National Library of Medicine PubMed
identification numbers describing it—the gene Entrez ID and the
NCBI Reference Sequence protein accession numbers (Fu et al.,
2009; Ptak et al., 2008).

Computational modelling techniques have been employed to cre—
ate static HIV—1 interaction networks, but these have not usually
considered spatial and temporal aspects. Static models provide use—
ful information on basic topological properties of HIV1—host inter—
actions (Dickerson et al., 2010). For instance, van Dijk et al. (2010)
constructed an HIV—1—human protein interaction network using
HIV—1 host protein—protein interactions contained in HHID and
reported that, depending on the cellular process being perturbed,
viral proteins interact both directly and indirectly with HIV depend—
ency factors (HDFs). Therefore, studying the HDF network has the
potential to improve our understanding of HIV—host interactions.
However, the cell is in a dynamic state. External and internal signals
inﬂuence protein interactions and hence cellular functions. As a con—
sequence of these signals, different cellular processes are halted or
activated. Processes may become active only under certain condi—
tions or in a particular cell type. Static networks alone do not
account for such complexities. In a dynamic system, the effect of
specific signals on its function can be determined. Construction of
dynamic models of virus—host interactions will therefore improve
our understanding of the viral hijack of the host cell’s signal trans—
duction network. Signalling pathway networks can explain the dy—
namic ﬂow of signals between molecules in a cell. These networks
not only represent the proteins and interactions involved, but they
also show the direction of signal ﬂow. An application of computer
modelling techniques to understanding cellular interaction dynamics
is the logical Boolean model formalism (Klamt et al., 2006). Logical
Boolean models are qualitative signal ﬂow networks that provide a
means to dynamically represent complex networks lacking in kinetic
details and quantitative data. They reveal functional dependencies
and non-linear relationships between components of the system, rep—
resent its dynamic response following from input signals and per-
turbations and predict end states which the system is likely to reach
either as steady states or attractor cycles (Klamt et al., 2007). The lo—
gical model can also be used to determine properties such as depend—
encies, feedback loops, robustness and sensitivity. Logical Boolean
models find applications in many biological phenomena. For
example, they have been used to reproduce knockout and overex—
pression profiles of mutant mice (Herrmann et al., 2012) and to pre—
dict that the overexpression of Src results in increased endocytosis of
EGFR in the absence/low amount of the epidermal growth factor in
human mammary epithelial cells (Helikar et al., 2013).

Of all immune cells, CD4—)— T lymphocytes are the most import—
ant cell type involved in HIV—1 infection. HIV—1 enters into these
cells via the interaction of its envelope proteins with the CD4 recep—
tor and CXCR4 or CCR5 co—receptors. Besides viral entry, HIV—1’s
interaction with these receptors can trigger signals that activate mul—
tiple signalling pathways stimulating cellular processes within the
host cell. In this study, we have computationally analysed signalling
pathways essential for T—cell activation through the T—cell receptor
complex (TCR), its co—stimulators and its co—inhibitors. Since che—
mokines, apart from inducing chemotaxis, also amplify T—cell acti—
vation signals, we have included chemokine signalling pathways.
We thus present the first integrated logical model of HIV-1 inter-
actions with T—cell activation pathways. By plotting the interdepen—
dencies between host and viral proteins, we identify host proteins

that inhibit or activate HIV—1 proteins in these pathways. By simu—
lating loss of functions, i.e. in silico knockouts, we determine puta—
tive points for potential drug intervention. We demonstrate that
insights into HIV-1 human protein interactions can be obtained by
integrating HHID and other biological data into a modelling frame—
work. This approach will be transferable to other pathways.

2 Methods

2.1 Data collection and model building

Host cell factor (HCF) interactions were obtained from 338 papers
from the primary literature. These were guided by pathway data
from the Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (Kanehisa
et al., 2004) and WikiPathways (Kelder et al., 2012). Only molecu—
lar interactions in which direct involvement could be established be—
tween any two HCFs or between viral proteins and HCFs were
considered as interactions in the model. We used HHID (2012 up-
date) as the primary source to obtain viral—host protein interaction
data. Each interaction between human and viral proteins was manu—
ally curated to establish that it is a direct physical interaction.
Indirect interactions were excluded. The nature of each interaction
and a brief description of the dynamics and combinations employed
are detailed in Supplementary Table S1. In presenting the inter-
actions between two proteins, ‘X’ and ‘Y’, we considered the inter—
action between them to be ‘activating’ if it allows Y to perform its
biological function and ‘inhibitory’ if it prevents it from performing
its biological function. We have built our model with the program
CellNetAnalyzer, a comprehensive user interface for analysis of
cellular networks that runs in MATLAB (Klamt et al., 2007), avail—
able at http://www2.mpi—magdeburg.mpg.de/projects/cna/cna.html.
Three siRNA gene knockout studies by Brass et al. (2008), Zhou
et al. (2008) and Konig et al. (2008) were accessed to identify HDFs
involved in these pathways. The pathway was visualized using the
System Biology Graph Tool in Certus Technologies’ Electronic Lab
Notes software.

2.2 Interaction graph—based study
Interaction graphs show relationships between nodes (molecules)
and arcs (interactions, between molecules, also referred to as edges).
For any interaction between two nodes, a sign—directed arc indicates
the direction of interaction between the two nodes. Converting path—
way information into an interaction graph enables the calculation of
dependencies between nodes. Dependencies reveal to which extent a
node in the network requires another node to be biologically active.
It is the inverse of inﬂuence, which describes the extent of involve—
ment of a source node in the biological activation or inhibition of
the target node. We use an algorithm that analyses binary inter-
actions (i.e. activating and inhibitory) to describe the influence of a
molecule on another (Klamt et al., 2007; Saez—Rodriguez et al.,
2007) based on the combination of directed paths between them
(Klamt et al., 2006). A path reveals a series of interactions between
molecules that link them in a single direction. Paths consist of mul—
tiple arcs that connect nodes, where each arc could be positive (indi—
cating activation) or negative (indicating inhibition). In computing
the influence, both the shortest positive and negative paths (if they
exist) are taken into consideration. Also, the presence of an adjoin—
ing node (a node with a negative feedback loop along the shortest
path, either positive or negative) would weaken the strength of its
activation or inhibition.

For example, if we consider the nodes A and D, where multiple
paths link A to D, the inﬂuence of A on D is determined by the existence

of the shortest positive and negative paths (or both) linking A to D. If all
paths from A to D include positive arcs only, A is said to totally activate
D. In general, the inﬂuence of A on D would be as follows:

1. ‘Ambivalent’ if both positive and negative paths are present be—
tween the two nodes such that the net positive or negative inﬂu—
ence cannot be easily ascertained but depends on the kinetics of
the system.

2. ‘Strong activation’ if there exists only positive paths between the
two nodes and there is no adjoining nodes with a negative feed—
back loop.

3. ‘Weak activation’ if the shortest path between the two nodes is
positive and there is at least one adjoining node with a negative
feedback loop.

4. ‘Strong inhibition’ if there exists only negative paths between the
two nodes and there is no adjoining nodes with a negative feed—
back loop.

5. ‘Weak inhibition’ if the shortest path between the two nodes is
negative and there is at least one adjoining node with a negative
feedback loop.

6. ‘No effect’ if no path exists between the two nodes.

For every type of influence of A on D, D depends on A. That is,
if A strongly activates D (influence), D is strongly activated (depend—
ency) by A. The dependency matrix captures this relationship (see
Supplementary Fig. S3 for further details).

2.3 Understanding signal propagation in pathways

Signal propagation explains how signals are transduced from input
nodes (cell receptors, etc.) through the intermediate nodes to the
output node. After examining model interdependencies, we analysed
our network as a logical model. A logical model consists of nodes
(molecules) connected by edges (interactions) in a Logical
Interaction Hypergraph (LIH). Each node is assigned a state, which
defines its condition for a biological property, for example, concen—
tration. Likewise, each edge is assigned a rule that expresses the na—
ture of the interaction (activation/inhibition) between reactant
nodes and product. Logical models use discrete values to express the
state of nodes: a value 0 represents a node that is switched OFF, this
means the molecule is in a biologically inactive state; a value 1 repre—
sents a node that is switched ON, the molecule is biologically active
and is able to transduce signals. To represent interaction effects
between proteins, we have employed a Boolean representation
called the Disjunctive Normal Form (‘sum or products’) that uses
‘AND’, ‘OR’ and ‘NOT’ functions to describe the combination of
arcs required to activate or inhibit a node. For example, column 3,
rows 16 and 150 in Supplementary Table S1 is represented as follows:

I CBL —l— TCR (complex) —I— ABL —> ZAP70

ZAP70 —> CRK

The first expression states that TCR (complex) and ABL are
required to activate ZAP70, and that CBL must be inactivated. For
the second expression, ZAP70 activates CRK. Biologically, this
means if we switch ON TCR and ABL but switch OFF CBL, active
TCR (complex) and active ABL would activate ZAP70. ZAP70,
which is now active, would activate CRK.

2.4 Logical steady—state analysis

We investigated in vivo signal propagation of the activation path—
way in the T cell using logical steady—state analysis (Klamt et al.,
2007). Logical steady states (LSSs) are situations where the state of

each node is stationary with respect to all the incoming Boolean
functions. LSS analysis presents a good platform to study signal
transfer and response to external stimuli in networks (Klamt et al.,
2007). The algorithm determines a state for intermediate and output
nodes in the model based on interaction combinations of input
node(s) whose states are already given (Klamt et al., 2007). It
changes the states of each node in a dynamic manner based on the
LIH. At LSS, the system no longer changes dynamically, unless a
new perturbation is applied (Klamt et al., 2006). Given a set of input
values, the Boolean algorithm assigns a determined state to each
node in the model. The state of each node is determined by the
Boolean function it is associated with. If there are no feedback
loops, the LSS computed is said to be complete as signals are propa—
gated from input straight to the output. But feedback loops often
lead to multi—stationarity or iterations that could prevent the exist—
ence of LSS or create a partial LSS (Xue and Miller-Jensen, 2012).
Note, a partial LSS does still provide functional information on the
model and negative feedback loops could give insights into points in
the network whose parameterization would change its dynamic be—
haviour. In a partial LSS, CellNetAnalyzer represents nodes which
do not reach a stationary state as ‘undetermined’. We have run the
logical steady—state analysis for different input conditions and node
deletions.

2.5 Test for putative drug targets

To simulate the action of drugs on proteins in the pathway, we
employed an in silico knockout technique. We set the value of a
particular node to 0 to exclude it from interactions. We then deter—
mined the new LSS for this set of conditions.

3 Results

3.1 Model integration reveals the complex
interdependent nature of the signal transduction
pathway

We have constructed a model comprising 137 nodes (16 HIV-1 pro-
teins and 121 human proteins) involved in 336 interactions. The
model consists of three main layers: the input, intermediate and out—
put layers. The input layer consists of nodes from which signals
enter into the pathway. The intermediate layer consists of nodes that
transduce signals from the input layer, and the output layer consists
of nodes through which signals leave the pathway to other cellular
processes. Antigens and cell membrane receptors (7 in total) that are
important in T-cell activation or inhibition are the main inputs in
the model. Six molecules whose activation is independent on the sig—
nalling pathway have also been set as input. Details of molecules set
as inputs are given in Supplementary Table S3.

The HIV-1 T-cell pathway model represents the transduction of
signals from antigens which activates the TCR complex, chemokines
that stimulate the chemokine receptors, co—receptor molecules (CD4
and CD45), T—cell activation co—stimulators, inducible T—cell
co—stimulator (ICOS) and the CD28 molecule and co—inhibitors,
cytotoxic T—lymphocyte—associated protein 4 (CTLA4) and the pro-
grammed cell death protein 1 (PD—1). It includes interactions be—
tween HCFs in the pathway and also their relations with viral
proteins. Major pathways described in the model include the TCR
signalling pathway, the chemokine signalling pathway, the calcium
signalling pathway, the MAPK signalling pathway, the PI3K-Akt
and JAIOSTAT signalling pathways that relate to processes like
IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 interferon gamma and tumour necrosis factor
alpha production, cytokine production, cell survival, migration,
apoptosis and regulation of actin cytoskeleton.

The T-cell activation model is highly interconnected with host
protein nodes linking each other in a complex hypergraph. Forty
percent of the successor (products) could be activated by at least two
separate interactions. PI3K can be activated as a result of six differ—
ent interactions. Of the 223 T—cell activation interactions we
observed, 16 interactions were inputs and therefore had no prede—
cessors, 158 interactions required only one predecessor, 30 had two
predecessors, 16 of them had three predecessors, and one and two
had four and six predecessors, respectively. All interactions had only
one successor (product) except 16 output interactions. This means
that 22% of product nodes in the model have more than one prede—
cessor node which combine to initiate their biological functions.
Fifty—one host molecules in our results interact with at least one viral
protein. This represents a significant degree of interaction (37.2%)
with the host signalling pathway.

3.2 Model validation

The model was built based on local interactions described in pri—
mary literature. We have used only direct interactions in building
the model. For example, if A interacts with B and B interacts with C,
the interaction A—B is direct, while the interaction A—C is indirect.
Some experimental groups may have observed that C is activated as
a result of A being activated; however, only if this interaction is
shown to occur in the absence of B should a direct link between A
and C be inferred. As the validity of our model would depend on the
accuracy of the host signalling pathway interactions, we have first
sought to validate the host signalling pathway interactions described
in our model. Therefore, we excluded all virus—host protein inter—
actions from analysis during model validation. Logical Boolean
models allow us to determine the states of proteins during signal
propagation through the use of ‘ON’ and ‘OFF’ states that describe
if the protein is biologically active and able to activate its down—
stream effectors or not (Klamt et al., 2006). This can be achieved
through logical steady—state analysis. Given a set of input conditions
(Klamt et al., 2006), a logical Boolean model would fix states for
downstream effectors (Klamt et al., 2006) according to the Boolean
value assigned to it.

We set input conditions as described in Supplementary Table S3
and tested if our model would reproduce known global properties
using logical steady—state analysis. A sample of 25 global inter-
actions obtained from 23 primary literature papers was used and we
reproduced 21 (~84%) of them. For example, CD28 co—stimulation
is not required for c—Jun N—terminal kinase activation in T cells,
CD28 co—stimulation of TCR activation increases BCL2-like 1 lev-
els, inhibits the BCL2—antagonist of cell death (Bader and Hogue,
2003) and amplifies MAPK14 (p38) and RAC-VAV-RHOA path—
ways (Cronin and Penninger, 2007). The chemokine signalling path-
way reportedly plays a role in T—cell activation and when it is
activated along with TCRs, it amplifies the effects of TCR stimula-
tion; our model reproduced these findings. Some other notable re—
production of literature observations include inhibition of the AKT-
dependent activation of NFKB and calcium signalling dependent
activation of NFAT when co—stimulator CD28 and co-inhibitor
CTLA4 are both activated along with the T cell receptor (Parry
et al., 2005), and the inhibition of the RASGRPl—dependent pool of
IL-2 production via MEK1/ERK. Some results could not be repli—
cated, for example, Patsoukis et al. (2012) state that PD—1 inhibits
the MEIOErk and AKT pathway; although our results indicated par—
tial inhibition of the pathway, they did not indicate full inhibition.
Nonetheless, it is a positive outcome to have 84% of predictions
confirmed. The small number of unconfirmed predictions are most

likely due to the presence of feedback loops that mitigate effects
in the system and thereby prevent a clear change in protein levels.
Full details of our model validation results are provided in
Supplementary Table S3.

3.3 HIV—1 ensures activation of pathways

In the model, we first analysed the dependency of each protein node
on other nodes so as to better understand the viral—host protein
relationships. To understand the effect of HIV—1 on cellular function,
we compared the uninfected T—cell activation pathway with the in-
fected HIV—1 host pathway. Thus, we removed HIV—1 interactions
from the model and generated the dependency matrix (Supplementary
Fig. S1) for all elements in the pathway. In the dependency matrix for
the uninfected pathway, each host molecule is strongly or weakly acti—
vated or inhibited by its predecessors and strongly or weakly activates
or inhibits its successors. In general, host molecules either have no ef—
fect or ambivalent effects on other elements that are not their
upstream or downstream effectors (Fig. 1). The most frequent rela—
tionship observed is ‘no effect’ represented by black boxes, followed
by ambivalent effects in Supplementary Fig. S1.

Next, we added HIV—1 interactions and repeated the procedure to
obtain the dependency matrix (Supplementary Fig. S2). A comparison
of the HIV—1 host pathway dependencies with the uninfected path—
way dependencies reveals how viral proteins hijack the pathway. An
important observation is that viral proteins could activate host pro—
teins without the need of the predecessors of these host proteins. For
example, the NCK adaptor protein (Verbanck et al., 2013) and the
p21 protein (Cdc42/Rac)—activated kinase (PAK) (Zenke et al., 2004)
are two proteins responsible for actin cytoskeleton regulation in T
cells. PAK is normally activated in T lymphocytes by NCK. But HIV—
1 Nef binds and activates PAK (rows 141 and 283 in Supplementary
Table S1). In the presence of Nef, if for any reason NCK becomes in—
active within the host, PAK will still be biologically active and actin
skeleton reorganization would still take place. This trend is observed
throughout the model. One consequence is that the host does not
have full control over its immunological pathways in the presence of
viral proteins. Although our model could not ascertain the extent of
activation of these host molecules by viral proteins, it shows that the
virus tries to ensure the activation of the T—cell pathway.

Our results indicate that viral—host interactions create multiple
activation routes that lead to the same functional output. An evident
observation from comparison of dependencies of the uninfected and
infected pathways is the shift in dependencies of host proteins, due
to interactions with viral proteins. Most factors move from strong
or weak activation or inhibition effects to generally ambivalent ef—
fects. For example, in dependency results of the uninfected pathway
(Supplementary Fig. S1), MAPK1&3 (Erk) is weakly activated by
11 host molecules, weakly inhibited by three host molecules, while
50 host molecules are ambivalent and 57 host molecules in the
model have no effect on it. In the dependency result of the HIV—1
host pathway, however (Supplementary Fig. S2), MAPK1&3 (Erk)
is weakly activated by five host molecules, weakly inhibited by one,
ambivalent for 108 and unaffected by 23. More nodes have ambiva—
lent effects and fewer nodes have no effect on the HIV—1 chemokine
pathway. This shows that viral proteins function to maintain the
pathways in an activated state and suppress the normal checks and
controls in each pathway by weakening the dependence of the HCFs
on their upstream nodes.

In the uninfected pathway dependencies, the CAMP—dependent
protein kinase (PKA) family of genes is weakly inhibited by chemo—
kine, CCR5/CXCR4, GRK, GRKL, Gai and the GaiGBy protein

(Supplementary Fig. S2), many factors that strongly inhibited PKA

tivation or inhibition of PKA in the HIV—1 host pathway are
completely different to those in the uninfected pathway. This sug—
gests that HIV—1 induces the activation of PKA and cAMP—depend—
ent processes which are normally inhibited in the chemokine
signalling pathway.

The protein NFKB is totally inhibited by four HCFs (AC, cAMP,
GADD45 and PKA), and totally activated by 26 proteins in the un—
infected pathway dependencies (Supplementary Fig. S1). In the HIV-
1 host pathway dependencies (Supplementary Fig. S2), however, it is
neither inhibited nor activated by any protein. NFKB plays a key
role in regulating the immune response to infection and anomalies in
its regulation have been linked with viral infection, cancer and auto—
immune diseases (Sheikh and Huang, 2003). Because NFKB is
involved in DNA transcription, it has been suggested that NFKB
may play a role in viral transcription from latency, this is an indica-
tor of a loss of control of the T—cell activation system (Hiscott et al.,
2001; Nimmerjahn et al., 2004; Wu et al., 1995). Another example
is the protein paxillin (PXN) that is totally activated by 21 host pro—
teins and inhibited by four host proteins in the uninfected pathway.
In the HIV—1 host pathway, however, there are only five weakly acti—
vating proteins affecting PXN with about 109 ambivalent factors
and 23 factors having no effect on it. Also, the regulatory host pro—
tein PTPN6 (SHP1) shows this trend. In the uninfected pathway de—
pendency results, it is weakly inhibited by 12 proteins and weakly
activated by 3 proteins. However, in the infected pathway, it is nei-
ther activated nor inhibited by any protein. The trend is constant for
all proteins in the dependency results.

The dependency matrix also permits the assessment of dependencies
of viral proteins via the pathway connections. Knowledge of the depend—
encies of viral proteins on HCFs in the pathway could offer insight on
how HIV—1 depends on host proteins during replication (Klamt et al.,
2006). For example, if a host protein activates a viral protein, deletion
of this host protein could reduce the biological efficiency of the viral pro-
tein. Table 1 shows the dependencies of HIV—1 proteins on the pathway.
HIV—1 proteins were shown to depend on a total of 26 host proteins for
activation or inhibition. Out of 29 dependencies, only nine coincided
with reaction expressions used to build the model. This shows that the
dependency results predicted 20 new dependency states (Table 1).

3.4 Viral—host interactions activate more host proteins
in the T—cell signalling network
Although resting T cells can be infected with HIV—1, viral replication
takes place preferentially in active T cells (Margolick et al., 1987).
Therefore in defining control conditions, we have chosen the state
whereby the T cell is fully activated. A fully activated T cell requires
the activation of the co—stimulator and TCR receptor. Also because
the activation of chemokine receptor has been shown to contribute to
T—cell activation both in our model and previously (Wong and Fish,
2003), we switched ON the chemokine input node. Because inhib—
ition of T—cell activation is necessary to prevent autoimmunity and
the ligands CD80 and CD86 are shared by CD28 and CTLA4
(Smith—Garvin et al., 2009), we have also switched ON co—inhibitors
in our model. In other words, all input nodes, receptors and non—re—
ceptors required for activation of the model were switched ON, while
input nodes whose activation contributes to the inactivation of the
model, except for the co—inhibitors, were switched OFF. This scen—
ario was set as our control. The full details of values assigned to each
input node in our model can be found in Supplementary Table S2.

As we did for dependencies, we have considered both the unin—
fected T—cell activation pathway and the HIV—1 host pathway. In

calculating the LSS for the HIV—1 host pathway, we have considered
the HIV—1 proteins to be in an inactive state and needing to be acti—
vated by a host molecule via the signal transduction pathway. The
basis for our approach is the knowledge that viral proteins are bio—
logically inactive outside their hosts but becomes active in them due
to their interaction with host proteins. Thus, the viral nodes (pro—
teins) in the model were not assigned values (states) but set as un—
determined. Some viral proteins such as gp120, Nef and Tat interact
with many HCFs in the model, whereas others interact with fewer
proteins. The LSS for both pathways was computed at control con—
ditions too (Supplementary Fig. S4). We compared LSS results of the
uninfected host pathway with the HIV—1 pathway. Under control
conditions in the uninfected pathway, about 16 HCFs were switched
OFF in our model: VAV3, PLCy1, FOXO3, GABZ, CRK, PKA,
LCP2 (SLP76), WASP, SH3BP2, CAMP, LAT, BAD, CDKNA1
(p21), GSK-3, AC and ZAP70 (full names are written in
Supplementary Table S2). In the HIV—1 host pathway, four host pro—
teins, (FOXO3, GSK3, AC and BAD), along with three HIV-1 pro-
teins, (gp160, Integrase (in) and Protease), were switched off. This
shows that more proteins in the uninfected pathway are switched off
when compared with those of the HIV—1 host pathway.

3.5 Model perturbation identifies potential drug targets

The logical model provides an approach to study the effect of per—
turbations resulting from disruptions in the signal transduction
pathway due to external stimuli or mutation (Klamt et al., 2006).
To understand how perturbations from mutations and drugs could
potentially alter the balance of HIV—1—host interactions, we knocked
out host molecules from our model. If a protein Y in a signal trans-
duction pathway is rendered non—functional due to mutation or the
effect of a drug, transfer of signals from Y would be disrupted and
therefore activation or inhibition of downstream nodes could be af—
fected. This scenario can be modelled in silico via ‘knockout’ or
‘knockin’ of interactions and/or nodes in the logical model. To
knock out a node, we exclude the node from the model completely
by assigning the state ‘0’ to it (i.e. switched OFF), leaving all other
states from the control intact. All host molecules in the model were
knocked out one at a time with the other control conditions main-
tained and the LSS at these states were determined. We recorded
viral proteins that are switched off at LSS for each protein being
knocked out, and have listed these as putative drug targets
(Table 2). Knocking out some host molecules switched off one or
more viral proteins. For example, knocking out Erk switched off
Rev, p6 and Vif. This predicts that removal of the protein

MAPK1&3 (Erk) in vivo could impair the function of these three
viral proteins. The removal of discs, large homolog 1 (DLGH1) pro-
tein switched off nucleocapsid but switched on the envelope glyco—
protein complex gp160, suggesting that DLGH1 is an inhibitor of
gp160. The gp160 node, which was off at LSS in the HIV—1 host
model, was switched on by DLGH1. The PI3K pathway is heavily
implicated in our results to inhibit protease as its proteins, when
switched off, turn on protease, which was inhibited at control. Also,
we knocked out different combinations of host molecules indicated
by our dependency matrix results to have significant inhibitory or
activating effects on each viral protein. For example, we knocked
out both STAT and JAK3. JAK3 has been indicated in Table 1 to ac—
tivate capsid. In general, the combinatory knockout of host mol—
ecules does not proffer any new conclusions. According to
Drugbank data (Wishart et al., 2008), five of nine HCFs identified
in Table 2, namely MAPK1/3(ERK), PKA, PDPK1, PI3K and
PKCB8CD, are known drug targets.

3.6 siRNA comparison of results

To test the validity of our results, we compared model predictions
with three high-throughput siRNA gene knockout studies from
Brass et al. (2008), Zhou et al. (2008) and Konig et al. (2008). They
identified 283, 303 and 293 HDFs respectively that are essential for
viral replication in humans. siRNA gene knockout studies are a
form of RNA interference experiment achieved by transfection of
artificial siRNAs which are processed to suppress expression of par—
ticular genes in the cell. The cell with a specifc gene inhibited is in-
fected with HIV and viral replication monitored. Genes whose
absence hampered viral replication are noted as essential for viral
replication. As the associated human proteins are not lethal to the
cell when absent, they represent ideal drug targets.

Although the siRNA screens were expected to identify the same
targets, the experimental procedures, cell types and materials they
used differed leading to limited overlap in results. For example,
(Bushman et al., 2009) compared the three siRNA studies used here
and found only a small overlap (<7%). We have extracted host mol—
ecules from these studies that are genes in the T—cell activation path—
way (Table 3). NFKB appears in all three siRNA studies, and as
many as four HCFs (CD4, NFKB, AKT and CCR5/CXCR4) inter-
sected between the Brass et al. (2008) and Zhou et al. (2008) studies.
In total, 12 HDFs from these 3 studies were host molecules in our
model. Three of these, PKA, ikkb-ikky-ikka and MAP3K14, were
identified in our dependency matrix results (Table 1). Only PKA
intersects with our logical steady—state results (Table 2). Konig

et al.’s (2008) data had no intersect with either dependency matrix
or logical steady—state results. Brass et al.’s (2008) data had two
intersects with dependency matrix results and one with logical
steady—state results.

3.7 Comparing logical steady—state analysis results with
dependency matrix results

There is overlap in the results from both the LSS and dependency
matrix approaches. For example, the AC—cAMP—PKA pathway,
which is normally inactive in the chemokine signalling pathway, ac—
tivates Vpr. It is interesting to note the influence of PKA. PKA is
activated via phosphorylation by cAMP in the chemokine signalling
pathway and is responsible for a variety of cellular functions
(Rodriguez and Kranias, 2005). In the HIV—1 host dependency ma—
trix results, it was observed that PKA is weakly activated and its ac—
tivation pattern is similar to Vpr. The HIV—1 host LSS results show
that deactivation of PKA consequently deactivate szr, a viral pro—
tein critical for viral replication. As PKA was also identified by
siRNA studies, there is evidence that supports the necessity of PKA
in HIV-1 replication.

The MEK1/2—Erk pathway is also identified in both dependency
and LSS results. Interestingly, MAPK1/3 (ERK) is identified as ne-
cessary for the activation of the viral proteins Vif, P6 and Rev in
both tests. This protein is an integration point for many cellular sig-
nals and has functions in cell proliferation, differentiation, transcrip-
tion regulation and development (Avruch et al., 2001). All three
viral proteins are involved in different key stages of viral replication:
Vif assists in viral assembly and maturation, Rev circumvents host
cell defence mechanism by countering mRNAs splicing to aid viral
replication and P6 aids viral infectivity and virus core assembly. The
results suggest that Erk is a very important host protein in viral rep-
lication. This result is similar to cancer cells as it was noted that un—
controlled expression of MEK1/2—Erk pathway leads to cancer
(Downward, 2003). Switching off the host protein DLGH1 acti-
vated gp160 and deactivates nucleocapsid. Potentially, viral cells
may control host signal transduction dynamics intermittently in-
hibiting or activating host proteins to favour viral replication needs
at various stages of infection. In total, four HCFs (DLGH1,
MAPK1&3 (Erk), cAMP and PKA) appeared in both the depend—
ency and logical steady state results.

4 Discussion

We have used logical models as a novel approach to construct
HIV—1 network dynamics, because this technique is efficient in the
absence of detailed quantitative information. Pathogenic viral
infections and cancer have been traced to malfunctioning signalling
pathways that induce disrupted cellular responses to signals and pro—
duce a diseased state (Xue and Miller—Jensen, 2012). Using logical
models, the effect of viral protein interactions on downstream cellu—
lar components can be monitored.

Our dependency results have predicted that HIV—1 interactions
with proteins in these signalling pathways reduce the dependence of
the host proteins on upstream HCFs in the signalling pathway for
their activation or deactivation while ensuring that the pathways re—
main activated. We suggest that HIV—1 has evolved to disrupt the
normal checks and balances that regulate each pathway, thereby fa—
vouring processes that enable its replication. The possibility of by—
passing a stage in the pathway involving host cells interacting with
HIV—1 has also been observed in our model, with PKA as an ex—
ample. The dependency matrix provides a way to analyse the effect

of viral interactions on the host system. Our model has reproduced
experimental viral—host protein interaction effects, and gives an
added advantage of permitting comparison of the effect of viral pro-
teins on all host proteins in the pathway with their consequences for
other host—host protein interactions.

Our approach has also predicted global interactions not reported
in the HHID (e.g. PAK and NCK activating Vpr). HIV—1 host de—
pendency results have suggested that positive feedback loops exist
between interacting pairs: Tat—GSK3 and Tat-MAP3K14 (NIK)
(Nikolsky et al., 2005 ). The feedback loop Tat—GSK3 is recorded in
HHID and verifies the interaction in the database. Not only do de—
pendency matrices predict dependencies, they also predict the influ—
ence of viral proteins on host molecules. Supplementary Table S5
shows the influence of viral proteins on host molecules. One of the
host molecules in the inﬂuence table, ADRBK1, was also identified
by siRNA gene knockout study by Zhou et al. (2008). In the com—
bined dependency (Table 1) and inﬂuence table (Supplementary
Table S5), the HIV—1 T—cell dependency made 33 global predictions;
two of these 33 are found in HHID. This highlights the predictive
power of logical models. Dependency matrices also allow us to
exclude or include interactions in analysis based on differences
due to cell type or stage of infection. With given cell type or
infection stage information, dependency matrix results could be
used to correct false positives and negatives that are recorded in the
HHID.

Logical steady—state analysis provides a way to simulate the
changes in signal transduction cascades due to mutations or external
stimuli like drug actions. In our model, under controlled conditions,
we discover that viral—host interactions activate proteins in the
model that are normally switched OFF in signal transduction path—
ways. In addition to the known behaviour that viral invasion of the
host cell triggers in the immune system, our results indicate that as a
consequence of infection the normal checks and balances in signal
transduction are bypassed, facilitating viral infection. The identifica-
tion of these proteins is important as they represent fixed or immut—
able targets for antiviral therapeutics. Known drug targets among
our LSS results are MAPK1/3 (ERK), PKA, PDPK1, PI3K and
PKCB8CD (Wishart et al., 2008). LSS analysis therefore provides an
avenue to identify potential drug targets for experimental validation
and would be very useful in further in silico pathogenic studies. Our
results suggest that viral—host interactions do contribute to the acti—
vation of more host proteins and hence aid activation of processes
downstream of these proteins. It also suggests that the virus does not
in any way impede these signals but instead amplifies them.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that insights into HIV—1
human protein interactions can be obtained by integrating direct
HHID interactions and other biological data into a logical modelling
framework. It is yet unclear how infection dynamics will change in
CD4+ T-cell signalling when other pathways are included.
Therefore, HIV-1 host infection models need to be constructed on a
larger scale to encompass all pathways and cell types involved in
HIV-1 infection. This modelling framework could also be used to
elucidate other signalling pathways to better understand signal ﬂow
information and rationally identify potential drug intervention
points.

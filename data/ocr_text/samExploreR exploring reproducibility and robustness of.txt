Abstract

Motivation: Data from RNA—seq experiments provide us with many new possibilities to gain in—
sights into biological and disease mechanisms of cellular functioning. However, the reproducibility
and robustness of RNA—seq data analysis results is often unclear. This is in part attributed to the
two counter acting goals of (i) a cost efficient and (ii) an optimal experimental design leading to a
compromise, e.g. in the sequencing depth of experiments.

Results: We introduce an R package called samExploreR that allows the subsampling (m out of n
bootstraping) of short—reads based on SAM files facilitating the investigation of sequencing depth
related questions for the experimental design. Overall, this provides a systematic way for exploring
the reproducibility and robustness of general RNA—seq studies. We exemplify the usage of
samExploreR by studying the influence of the sequencing depth and the annotation on the identifi—
cation of differentially expressed genes.

Availability and Implementation: samExploreR is available as an R package from Bioconductor.

(Sims et al., 2014) or for context specific problems, e.g. for iden—
tifying differentially expressed (DE) genes (Liu et al., 2014
Rapaport et al., 2013).

In this paper, we introduce an R package called samExploreR
that allows the convenient exploration of reproducibility and ro-
bustness of RNA—seq data analysis results. We demonstrate the util—
ity of samExploreR by a case study for identifying DE genes.

2 Methods

The identification of DE genes from RNA—seq data requires the fol—
lowing 4 analysis steps. Step 1: Alignment of short—reads, e.g. with
Bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012). Step 2: Annotation de—
pendent matching and summarization, e.g. CuffLinks (Trapnell
et al., 2010), (Anders et al., 2014) or featureCounts (a function
available in Rsubread (Liao et al., 2013)). Step 3: Normalization
(Dillies et al., 2013). Step 4: Statistical analysis including multiple
testing correction (Soneson and Delorenzi, 2013).

In principle, the subsampling of reads can be implemented as an
additional step at any position before step 3. In this paper, we intro—
duce the R package samExploreR (which is our modification of
featureCounts, that integrates the matching and summarization of
reads (Steps 2) with a subsampling step. Thus, the application of
samExploreR provides ‘a shortcut’ mapping SAM files directly to
subsampled count vectors (cv) representing the number of reads as—
signed per gene, see Figure 2. A significant advantage of our package
is its ability to perform a direct subsampling analysis for various ver—
sions of genomic annotations, as matching reads to genes loci and
reads resampling, in one procedure. This is in contrast to procedures
like SAMtools (Li et al., 2009), Picard (http://broadinstitute.github.
io/picard/) or subSeq (Robinson and Storey, 2014), see Figure 1A for
a visualization.

3 Results

To demonstrate the applicability of samExploreR for studying re-
producibility and robustness we use an RNA—seq dataset from Mus
musculus (mouse) (Fiorenza et al., 2015). This dataset consists of
two groups with three samples in each. Aligning was performed
with Bowtie2 allowing 1 mismatch. For our analysis, we consider
three different annotations (Flicek et al., 2013). For obtaining infor-
mation about the robustness and reproducibility of this dataset
w.r.t. different metrics, we draw m out of n bootstrap short reads

fraction of subsampled reads, i.e.

# subsampled reads

f we lono Su samp e rea S # totalreads

(1)

The parameter f has the interpretation of a ‘simulated sequencing
depth’ of a virtual sequencing experiment. Furthermore, for every
value of f, we generate R = 25 replicates (see loop in Fig. 1). Each of
these datasets is then analyzed with DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014) to
obtain a list of DE genes.

In Figure 1B.A, we show the number of DE genes (y—axis) as a
function of the simulated sequencing depth, f, (x—axis) for three an—
notations. The three included P—values correspond to results from a
Friedman test for dependent groups, comparing the results from
7:3 user—specified values of f (horizontal slices; see arrows) for a
fixed annotation, testing the null hypothesis of equal means. Ideally,
a nonsignificant Friedman test corresponds to statistically robust re—
sults because a further increase of the (real) sequencing depth is un-
likely to change the results. Practically, the Friedman test may give
significant results indicating an imperfection in the robustness of the
results w.r.t. variations of the parameter f, as is the case for the ex—
amples in Figure 1B.A. Next, we study the reproducibility of differ—
ent annotations for fixed f values (vertical slices; see arrows). As one
can see from Figure 1B.A, the results for different annotations are
diverging for increasing values of f making the results less reprodu—
cible w.r.t. different genome annotations. The choice of f values is
explored in the Suppl.file

In order to emphasize that ‘robustness’ as well as ‘reproducibil—
ity’ are always defined w.r.t. to a specific metric, we repeat the
above analysis for the ‘common number of DE genes’ between two
annotations; results shown in Figure 1B.B. Further questions that
could be studied with samExploreR in a similar way would be the
reproducibility of results of RNA—seq data from different wet labs,
sequencing platforms, gene summarizations (including introns), tis-
sue preparations (FFPE versus FF samples) or statistical analysis
methods. Also the robustness of the summarization parameter for
multiple gene hits or the number of mismatches for the alignments
could be explored.

4 Conclusion

A cornerstone of any scientific study is the question regarding the re—
producibility and robustness of obtained results. Unfortunately, for
high-throughput data from RNA—seq experiments such questions

the severe underrepresentation of this topic in the literature.
samExploreR provides a flexible exploratory tool for investigating
general RNA—seq datasets w.r.t. user—defined metrics.

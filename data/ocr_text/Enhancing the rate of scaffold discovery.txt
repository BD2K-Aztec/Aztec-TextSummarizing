ABSTRACT

Motivation: In high-throughput screens (HTS) of small molecules for
activity in an in vitro assay, it is common to search for active scaffolds,
with at least one example successfully confirmed as an active. The
number of active scaffolds better reflects the success of the screen
than the number of active molecules. Many existing algorithms for
deciding which hits should be sent for confirmatory testing neglect
this concern.

Results: We derived a new extension of a recently proposed
economic framework, diversity-oriented prioritization (DOP), that
aims—by changing which hits are sent for confirmatory testing—
to maximize the number of scaffolds with at least one confirmed
active. In both retrospective and prospective experiments, DOP
accurately predicted the number of scaffold discoveries in a batch of
confirmatory experiments, improved the rate of scaffold discovery by
8—17%, and was surprisingly robust to the size of the confirmatory
test batches. As an extension of our previously reported economic
framework, DOP can be used to decide the optimal number of hits
to send for confirmatory testing by iteratively computing the cost of
discovering an additional scaffold, the marginal cost of discovery.

1 INTRODUCTION

All screeners must decide which initial positives (‘hits’) from
a high—throughput screen (HTS) to submit for conﬁrmatory
experiments (Makarenkov et al., 2007; Nicholls, 2008; Rocke, 2004;
Storey et al., 2007). In HTS of small molecules for biological
activity, several hits are often experimentally conﬁrmed by ensuring
they exhibit the characteristic dose—response behavior common to
true actives. Sending the wrong molecules for conﬁrmatory testing
wastes resources, reducing the amount of useful information in
screening results; this is especially true in the context of small
molecule screens which are often very noisy.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Most commonly used hit selection methods focus on maximizing
the number of successfully conﬁrmed molecules in subsequent
conﬁrmatory experiments. These methods include correcting
time— and well position—dependent systematic error in measurements
(Makarenkov et al., 2007), exploiting chemical information (Glick
et al., 2004, 2006; Posner et al., 2009), better normalizing
screening data (Zhang et al., 2005), choosing better experimental
controls (Seiler et al., 2008) or bypassing hit selection entirely
by testing all molecules in dose—response experiments (Inglese
et al., 2006). These methods are effective, increasing the number of
successful conﬁrmations, but largely ignore the fact that screeners
are often looking to maximize the total number of clusters—
groups of molecules with similar structure—containing examples
with conﬁrmed activity (Clark and Webster—Clark, 2008).

Some methods use molecular clustering to improve the design
of HTS experiments. For example, molecular clusters have been
used to reduce the total number of molecules in the primary screen
by about two—thirds (Karnachi and Brown, 2004). Similarly, other
studies pick molecules for follow—up using statistical tests on the data
from a single—dose screen to ﬁnd clusters of active molecules (Varin
et al., 2010; Yan et al., 2005). These methods favor clusters that
contain several active molecules, and attempt to send all these active
molecules for conﬁrmatory testing. As intended, these methods
successfully increase the number of active molecules identiﬁed in
conﬁrmatory testing. In contrast, diversity—oriented prioritization
(DOP) aims to maximize the diversity of conﬁrmed actives by
maximizing the number of clusters with at least one successfully
conﬁrmed active. Rather than picking groups of similar molecules,
DOP picks molecules from as many different groups as possible
given the cost constraint. This aim is motivated by the fact that
screeners often cluster conﬁrmed active molecules to pick series of
molecules to optimize, and that the number of series with at least one
conﬁrmed active is a reasonable way of measuring the information
obtained from a screen (Clark and Webster—Clark, 2008).

The DOP method extends a recently described economic
framework for interpreting HTS data, initially introduced to decide
how many hits to send for conﬁrmatory testing (Swamidass et al.,
2010). This framework is used to iteratively choose each batch of hits
to be sent for conﬁrmatory testing so as to maximize the expected
surplus of the batch. The expected surplus is computed using three
mathematical models: utility, cost and predictive. The utility model
speciﬁes the preferences of the screener, the cost model tracks

the cost of running a conﬁrmatory experiment and the predictive
model guesses the outcome of future conﬁrmatory experiments.
DOP extends this framework by introducing a new utility model,
from which we derive a new method of prioritizing hits.

We validated the DOP methodology and the algorithm that
implements it with both retrospective and prospective experiments.
These experiments demonstrate that DOP can substantially
increase the number of active scaffolds discovered in a HTS
experiment.

2 DATA

The technical details of the assay and subsequent analysis can be
found in PubChem (PubChem AIDs 1832 and 1833). For ~3 00 000
small molecules screened in duplicate, we deﬁned activity as the
mean of ﬁnal, corrected percent inhibition. After molecules with
autoﬂuorescence and those without additional material in stock were
ﬁltered out, 1322 with activity greater than 25% were labeled ‘hits’
and tested for dose—response behavior in the ﬁrst batch. Of these
tested molecules, 839 yielded data consistent with inhibitory activity.
Each hit was considered an ‘active’ if the effective concentration at
half maximal activity (EC50) was less than or equal to 20 11M. Using
this criterion, we determined 410 molecules to be active.

3 METHODS
3.1 Scaffold clusters

There are two common strategies used to cluster small molecules: similarity—
based and scaffold—based clusterings (Bemis and Murcko, 1996; Butina,
1999; Clark and Labute, 2008; Downs et 611., 1994; Schuffenhauer
et 611., 2007; Shemetulskis et 611., 1995; Willett, 2006). Similarity—based
clustering groups structurally similar molecules—as measured by ﬁngerprint
similarity—together. Within each cluster, molecules’ structures are very
close, but it may not be possible to align molecules because there may not
be substructures common to all the molecules in the cluster. In contrast,
scaffold—based clustering groups molecules into clusters with a well—deﬁned
common substructure. Therefore, within each scaffold cluster, molecules are
easily aligned (Clark and Labute, 2008).

Often, HTS campaigns aim to identify as many new scaffolds as possible.
Sometimes intellectual property concerns dictate both avoiding particular
scaffolds and deﬁning discoveries using the scaffold concept. Scaffolds
are often the starting points from which lead—reﬁnement proceeds (Clark
and Webster—Clark, 2008; Good and Oprea, 2008; Schuffenhauer e1 611.,
2007). Therefore, we focused on scaffold—based clustering. Nonetheless, our
methods can be easily adapted to similarity—based clustering.

We computed scaffolds from the structure of each molecule using the
molecular framework algorithm described by Bemis and Murcko (1996):
contiguous ring systems and the chains that link two or more rings together.
Molecular frameworks are only an approximation of a medicinal chemists
subjective concept of a scaffold (Clark and Labute, 2008; Schuffenhauer
e1 611., 2007). Nonetheless, frameworks are commonly used in chemical
informatics because they are clearly deﬁned and easy to compute. Although
we deﬁne scaffolds as molecular frameworks, DOP is compatible with more
sophisticated scaffold detection algorithms; all it requires is that molecules
are grouped appropriately.

In order to ensure our ﬁndings were not overly dependent on the choice
of scaffold deﬁnition, all experiments in this study were replicated using a
modiﬁcation of each scaffold that replaces every atom in the scaffold with a
carbon. The results of this variation are not presented because they are not
notably different. This observation suggests that similar results would also
be observed with other scaffold—detection algorithms, though we have not
directly veriﬁed this.

3.2 Utility model

The preferences of screeners are difﬁcult to assess and often inconsistent
between different experts (Lajiness etal., 2004). Nonetheless, some parts of
their preferences can be modeled. In this study, a scaffold was considered to
be ‘active’ if at least one example of the scaffold was conﬁrmed as active.
Consistent with prior work (Clark and Webster—Clark, 2008), one unit of
discovery was deﬁned as a single active scaffold. Of course, more robust
deﬁnitions of an active scaffold are possible—for example, deﬁning scaffolds
active if they have two or three conﬁrmed active examples—however, these
deﬁnitions require more complicated algorithms to implement and will be
elaborated in future work. The utility model U (D) was deﬁned as a function
of the total discovery so far, D: the number of scaffolds with at least one
example conﬁrmed active, corresponding with maximizing the number of
scaffolds identiﬁed, giving chemists maximally diverse candidate starting
points for follow—up chemistry.

3.3 Cost model

The cost model used is relevant to the implementation of DOP in two ways.
First, in some scenarios, the cost of acquiring different molecules varies.
In the context of HTS, however, molecules under consideration are usually
equally accessible. Therefore, we assumed that it costs the same amount
to send each molecule for conﬁrmatory testing. Second, there are both
large ﬁxed and smaller variable costs associated with sending molecules for
conﬁrmatory tests. Under these circumstances, conﬁrmatory tests are most
efﬁciently performed in large batches, just as is done in practice.

3.4 Predictive model

We considered two predictive models: a logistic regressor (LR) (Dreiseitl and
Ohno—Machado, 2002) and a neural network with a single hidden node (NNl)
(Baldi and Brunak, 2001). Both are structured to use the screen activity as
the single independent variable and the result of the associated conﬁrmatory
experiment as the single dependent variable. Networks with more hidden
layers work as well, but do not yield substantially better results. Both the
LR and NNl models were trained using gradient descent on the cross—
entropy error using the monotonic prior deﬁned in the Appendix A (with
k = 2 and 0: 0.5) along with a Gaussian prior on weights not addressed by
the monotonic prior (Baldi and Brunak, 2001). In general, such a protocol
yields models whose outputs are interpretable as a probabilities,

1 if molecule x is conﬁrmed active
P(x) 0 if molecule )6 is conﬁrmed inactive, (l)
zx if molecule x has not been tested
where zx is the output of the predictive model on the molecule x. There is

little distinction between LR and NNl in practice and, in fact, virtually any
probabilistic method can be used by the DOP method.

3.5 Prioritization algorithm

The economic framework prescribes choosing the next batch to maximize
the expected surplus (ES) after the next batch is screened,

E[U(D/+D)] —(C+C‘) (2)

where D’ is the number of scaffolds in the next batch, D is the number of
scaffolds discovered so far, C is the cost expended conﬁrming molecules so
far and C’ is the cost of screening the next batch. Removing the cost terms,
which are constant across all molecules, shows that maximizing the ES is
equivalent to maximizing expected utility (EU),

E[U(D/+D)]. (3)
Furthermore, because U () is likely to be approximately linear over the
narrow distribution of D’, this equation is well approximated by,

U (E [D‘] +D), (4)
a well—studied approximation from the economics literature (Levy and
Markowitz, 1979; Schoemaker, 1982). Because U(') is monotonically

Diversity-oriented prioritization

 

increasing, maximizing the EU—and also maximizing ES—is approximately
equivalent to maximizing the expected marginal discovery (EMD)

E [D‘], (5)

and therefore we propose prioritizing molecules by choosing the next batch
of molecules so as to maximize the EMD of the batch.

A different protocol is required to select the molecules in the ﬁrst batch
because it is impossible to compute the EMD without knowing the results
of at least some conﬁrmatory experiments. For the ﬁrst batch, we chose
molecules with the top activity in the screen while at the same time assuring
that no more than one example of each scaffold was selected.

3.6 Computing EMD

The algorithm for computing the EMD requires the output from the predictive
model and assumes that each probability of successful conﬁrmation is
independent of the others, and that within a scaffold group each molecule
is screened in the order of decreasing probability of activity. With these
assumptions, the EMD of the x—th molecule in the scaffold is

EMD(x) =P(x—th is ﬁrst active), (6)

where P(x—th is ﬁrst active) is the probability molecule )6 is the ﬁrst conﬁrmed
active within its scaffold group, and the total EMD of the next batch E [D’] is
computed as the sum of the EMDs associated with each molecule in the batch.

To do this, we used an algorithm to compute P(x—th is ﬁrst active).
For each group of molecules with a common scaffold, we deﬁned
the probability that each molecule is active using Equation (1). The
molecules in the group were sorted in decreasing order of probability so
that {P(1)ZP(2)ZP(3)Z...}. Assuming the untested molecules must be
prioritized in this order, the probability that the j—th molecule in this list
is the ﬁrst active is

j—1
EMD(j)=P(j is ﬁrst active)=P(j)1_[ [1 —P(k)], (7)

k=1
where the probability that molecule j is active, P(j), is multiplied by the
probability that all prior molecules in the scaffold group are inactive,

1:, [1 —P(k)].

The EMD of the next batch was thus maximized by choosing the untested
molecules with highest EMD. These EMD’s remain ordered in decreasing
order so that {EMD(l) Z EMD(2) Z EMD(3) Z ...}. Within a scaffold group,
therefore, untested molecules were prioritized in the same order as their initial
HTS activity. Depending on how many total molecules are to be tested,
the algorithm will usually pick one molecule from each scaffold but will
occasionally choose more than one. With respect to molecules from other
scaffold groups, however, their order may be shufﬂed: exactly the behavior
we seek.

4 RESULTS
4.1 Scaffold distribution

The skewed distribution of scaffolds in HTS data motivated our
approach. Ignoring this distribution, resources would be wasted
trying to conﬁrm examples of scaffolds that have already been
discovered; in other words, there is signiﬁcant redundancy both
in HTS libraries and the hits from screens of these libraries. We
considered three sets of molecules: the full set of molecules from
the screen (the Library), the ﬁrst batch sent for dose—response
conﬁrmation (the Dosed) and the molecules subsequently conﬁrmed
as active (the Active). There were 301617, 1322 and 410 molecules,
and 84440, 1043 and 331 scaffolds, respectively, in each of these
sets. Each scaffold is represented by, on average, 3.57, 1.27 and
1.24 examples. The molecules are not distributed evenly among

The ‘Library’ is the approximately 300 000 molecules screened in the initial HTS assay,
‘Dosed’ are the molecules that were sent for dose-response conﬁrmation in the ﬁrst
batch, and ‘Active’ are those molecules subsequently conﬁrmed as active. For each set
of molecules, the top table displays the frequency of the top ﬁve most common scaffolds
and the percentage of the total dataset that each scaffold group represents. The bottom
table displays the number of scaffolds with exactly 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 examples in the data
(frequency) and the percentage of data that these scaffold groups represent.

scaffolds; a few scaffolds are disproportionately frequent, but > 50%
of the Dosed set is composed of scaffolds with only one example
(Table 1). These results reﬂect the prior observation that molecules
follow a power—law distribution when clustered (Benz 61611., 2008).
Similar distributions would be expected if the structures had been
clustered by almost any other clustering algorithm.

The scaffold distribution sets an upper bound on DOP’s efﬁciency.
Of the 1322 molecules sent for dose—response experiments, only
79% could be, in a best—case scenario, the ﬁrst example of their
scaffold group. Therefore, at most we could expect a 21% reduction
in the number of conﬁrmatory experiments required to discover a
ﬁxed number of scaffolds. This estimation is based on one dataset
and would need to be revised upwards or downwards with other
datasets. Furthermore, this estimate only considers the proportion
of singletons; more accurate predictions could be constructed.
Nonetheless, it provides a useful theoretical baseline against which
to gauge DOP’s empirical performance.

4.2 Predicting yield

One test of the DOP algorithm is to assess whether it can accurately
predict yield—the number of scaffold discoveries in a batch of
experiments—using Equations (6) and (7) in conjunction with either
of the two predictive models, LR and NNl.

In this experiment, 1322 molecules with known dose—response
outcomes were ordered by their initial HTS activity. They were then
divided into plates of 30 molecules each. The yield of each plate
was predicted by training a predictive model (LR or NNl) on the
outcome of all prior conﬁrmatory tests, as described in the Section 3.
The predicted probabilities of activity were then used in conjunction
with Equations (6) and (7) to yield a ﬁnal prediction. The predicted
yield is close to the empirical number of discoveries (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1. Predicted conﬁrmation rate of scaffolds. The per—batch predicted
discoveries of active scaffolds (LR and NN1) along with observed
discoveries (labeled ‘Data’).

This experiment demonstrates that the DOP algorithm can predict
the number of scaffold discoveries in a plate. There is some
systematic inaccuracy in these predictions; both LR or NNl seem
to overestimate the number of discoveries by a small amount. It is
possible that this systematic error is due to dependencies in the data
ignored by our model: for example, successfully conﬁrmed actives
are likely to share a common scaffold. Nonetheless, the predictions
are close to the observed yield.

4.3 Reordering hits

Another test of DOP is to verify that it modiﬁes the order in which
molecules are sent for conﬁrmatory testing. Furthermore, because
conﬁrmatory experiments are usually batched in large groups, it is
important to study how the DOP rankings change as the batch sizes
are varied. In this experiment, we compared the order of molecules
ranked by initial HTS activity with the ordering generated by the
DOP algorithm. For comparison, the DOP algorithm was run six
times using two different predictive models and three different batch
sizes: 1 (unbatched), 30 and 300.

This experiment yields several important observations. First, both
NNl and LR yielded almost identical rankings (R2 =0.999). This
is an important result that suggests that DOP is robust to the
predictive model: subtle differences in the predictive model may not
dramatically affect how molecules are ordered. Second, DOP may
be surprisingly robust to batch size. Using a batch size of 30 was
virtually identical to the unbatched DOP (Fig. 2). There were more
noticeable differences with unbatched DOP and DOP using a batch
size of 300. Nonetheless, using DOP with a batch size of 300 yielded
rankings much closer to the unbatched DOP rankings than to the
original HTS rankings. Finally, in all cases, ~200 molecules were
not ranked because their EMDs were equal to zero before they were
prioritized. This is exactly the desired behavior; testing these 200
molecules would be redundant because they have scaffolds that had
already been conﬁrmed active.

4.4 Increasing scaffold discovery rate

The most important in silico test of DOP is to verify that it increases
the rate of scaffold discovery. While it is clear that DOP reorders

molecules relative to the HTS activity, the rate at which scaffolds are
discovered must increase in order to conclude that DOP is preferable
to ordering molecules by HTS activity.

In this experiment, molecules were prioritized by DOP in batches
of 30. Compared with prioritizing by HTS activity, the total number
of scaffolds discovered was plotted against the total number of
conﬁrmatory experiments (Fig. 3). DOP shifts the curve upward,
indicating that for any speciﬁc number of conﬁrmatory experiments,
more scaffolds were discovered using DOP. On average, DOP
discovered 1.18 more scaffolds per batch than HTS activity
prioritization. DOP increased the scaffold discovery rate.

4.5 Effect of batch size

For DOP to be useful in practice, it must be robust to large batch
sizes. We might expect a trade—off between batch size and efﬁciency;
larger batch sizes might decrease DOP efﬁciency due to inaccuracies
in the predictive model and uncertain outcomes in conﬁrmatory
experiments. However, the ranking data suggest that DOP may be
robust to batch size. We performed a more comprehensive test to
resolve these conﬂicting expectations.

In this experiment, DOP was run with several different batch sizes
using both predictive models. Compared with ordering molecules by
HTS activity, the number of conﬁrmatory experiments required to
discover 50, 75 and 100% of the scaffolds was reduced by 8—17%
(Table 2). Surprisingly, these numbers were largely consistent (and
often identical) across all batch sizes and predictive models. Batch
size did not appreciably affect the rate at which scaffolds are
discovered; DOP is robust to batch size.

4.6 Prospective validation

Although these retrospective experiments are promising, the most
important test of DOP is a prospective experiment. In this
experiment, we used a batch size of 500 molecules. DOP, using
both LR and NNl, was used to pick the next 500 molecules to
test. These two lists of candidates were compared with the next
batch of 500 molecules selected by HTS activity. The yield of all
three lists was predicted and as many molecules as were available
were obtained and sent for conﬁrmatory testing. In this case, of the
500 compounds suggested, 479 from the LR and NNl batches and
477 from the HTS batch were sent for testing.

Even without the results of the conﬁrmatory tests, this experiment
reinforced several results from the retrospective experiments. First,
the batches suggested by LR and NNl were almost identical, with
only 10 molecules different, corresponding with the observation that
LR and NNl yielded almost identical rankings in the retrospective
experiments. Second, both DOP batches were substantially different
than the HTS batch, with 105 molecules different in the LR list
and 95 different in the NNl list, again corresponding with similar
observations from the retrospective experiments. More importantly,
LR predicted a 12.5% increase in scaffold discovery (126 compared
with 112). Likewise, NNl predicted a similar 8.7% increase in the
rate of scaffold discovery (113 compared with 104).

The results of the conﬁrmatory testing also correspond with
the results from the retrospective experiments. First, and most
importantly, more scaffolds were discovered in the DOP batches;
170 and 166 scaffolds were discovered in the LR and NNl
batches, compared with 153 scaffolds in the HTS batch. Finally,
the predicted yield was close to, but still underestimated, the actual

5 DISCUSSION

In both retrospective and prospective experiments, DOP increased
the rate of scaffold discovery from an HTS experiment. The
key result of this study is that screeners preferences, when more
accurately modeled, can be applied to change the order in which
molecules are tested so as to increase the rate at which active
scaffolds are discovered.

Percentages in parenthesis indicate improvement with respect to conﬁrmatory tests run
in order of HTS results.

Several additional issues arise when using DOP in practice. First,
there will be several molecules that are very likely active but will not
be sent for conﬁrmatory testing. These molecules are de—prioritized
because they belong to scaffold groups with at least one example
already conﬁrmed active. This is not the behavior some might
expect from a prioritization algorithm. One extension to address this
concern would be to report the probability of activity—the output of
LR or NN1—for all the molecules from scaffold groups with at least
one conﬁrmed active. A succinct way to summarize this information
is to report the total number of actives and inactives expected if all
the molecules in the group had been tested (Fig. 4).

DOP could be used as the ﬁrst stage of a two—stage prioritization
protocol, where the ﬁrst few batches are selected to maximize
scaffold discovery. In the second stage, with the screener’s input,
a number of scaffolds could then be selected for follow—up
experiments based on their structures, the initial results from the
conﬁrmatory experiments and the predicted number of actives and
inactives associated with them. Additional examples of the selected
scaffold would then be sent for conﬁrmatory testing to build enough

Fig. 4. This display is sufﬁciently informative to enabled chemists to
prioritize singletons for follow—up after a screen. All four scaffolds have
only one conﬁrmed active (dark red block), with the predicted number of
actives (light red bars and left numbers) and inactives (blue bars and right
numbers) displayed below each structure. These predictions are fractional,
reﬂecting the expected number of actives and inactives for each scaffold.
The top—left scaffold’s structure and predicted number of actives were
both favorable to a particular medicinal chemist. The bottom—left scaffold’s
questionable structure was outweighed by the number of predicted actives.
The right scaffolds’ structures were so unfavorable that they were considered
undesirable regardless of the number of actives conﬁrmed; the chemist
believed that they were more difﬁcult to chemically modify. Of course,
other medicinal chemists might rank these structures differently based on
their experience and intentions.

evidence to establish the scaffold as a true active. Such a two—
step protocol, ﬁrst maximizing scaffold discovery then conﬁrming
more examples of interesting scaffolds, provides an example of
how our methods could be modiﬁed to better model screeners’
preferences. Better utility functions might seek to maximize the
number of scaffolds with a clique of at least two or three conﬁrmed
actives. Clique—oriented prioritization (COP), however, requires a
more complicated algorithm that will be presented in future work.

Importantly, DOP can and should be used simultaneously with
other HTS analysis algorithms. For example, other prioritization
methods designed to reduce false positives—by using better
controls, chemical information, or other strategies—are all
compatible with DOP; the priorities generated by these methods
can either be substituted for the HTS activity or be presented as an
additional independent variable to the predictive model.

Furthermore, DOP is a direct extension of a previously deﬁned
economic framework and can, therefore, be used to compute the
marginal cost of discovery (MCD) (Swamidass et a1., 2010). The
MCD is the cost required to discover one more scaffold, and yields
an optimal strategy for deciding how many and which molecules
should be sent for conﬁrmatory testing. The MCD is effectively the
price of the next active, and the screener should keep screening
molecules until the MCD rises too high and the utility of the next
scaffold is not worth the cost of ﬁnding it.

DOP is not without limitations. Most importantly, DOP relies on a
deﬁnition of an active scaffold that may not be optimal. Furthermore,
DOP requires that the results from enough conﬁrmatory experiments
are known for the predictive model to be trained. In contrast, most
other HTS hit selection methods are applied to primary HTS data
without knowing anything about the outcome of any conﬁrmatory

experiments (Karnachi and Brown, 2004; Varin et a1., 2010; Yan
et a1., 2005). This limitation essentially requires HTS to proceed
iteratively, with at least two batches. Future work will include
methods of circumventing this limitation by using predictive models
that do not require conﬁrmatory experiments to be parameterized.
Also, as presented, DOP assumes that there are no errors in the
conﬁrmatory experiment, that each molecule’s potency is measured
accurately in the dose—response experiment. However, just like the
primary screen, there can be substantial noise in the conﬁrmatory
experiment (Eastwood et a1., 2006). One method of accounting for
errors in the conﬁrmatory experiment is by labeling molecules by
their probability of having a satisfactory potency when taking the
noise of the assay into account. This strategy would, likely, improve
the quality of the predictive models and more comprehensively
address the problem of noise in HTS projects. A detailed description
and evaluation of this approach will be considered in future work.

6 CONCLUSION

When screeners’ preferences are modeled, they can be applied
to change which hits are selected from a high—throughput screen
and sent for conﬁrmatory testing. For example, DOP relies on the
observation that screeners are looking for active scaffolds more
than they are looking for active molecules. In this study, both
retrospective and prospective experiments demonstrate that DOP
can increase the rate of scaffold discovery from 8% to 17%. DOP is
robust to batch size, and can be applied even when using very large
batch sizes common in HTS experiments. More accurate models of
screeners’ preferences may prove even more useful.

APPENDIX A

A.1 Monotonic models

Models like LR and NN1 estimate the correct weights by using
gradient descent to maximize the log likelihood of the model with
respect to the training data:

L=Z(tilogzi(W)—I—(l —ti)log[1—zi(W)]>, (8)

where i ranges over the training data, t,- 6 {1,0} is the outcome of
the conﬁrmation experiment on the i—th training example, zl- is the
output of the model on the i—th training example and W is the weight
vector whose elements are chosen to maximize the log likelihood L.

Sometimes this process yields weights that are inaccurately
estimated. Usually, the inaccuracy only subtly affects the model’s
yield predictions and the order in which molecules are prioritized.
Occasionally, when trained on small amounts of data, this inaccuracy
can be more dramatic. The worst failure occurs when a model
inaccurately learns that the molecules with the worst activity in the
initial screen are the most likely to be active in the conﬁrmatory
experiment. This, in turn, prioritizes the most clearly inactive
molecules from the initial screen above all others.

This failure can be prevented by ensuring that the model is positive
monotonic: that its output always increases as its input—the activity
in the initial screen—increases. We accomplish this by adding a
gamma prior to components of the weight vector. In the case of LR,
the prior is placed on the weight multiplied by the input data, but not
on the weight added to the product of this multiplication. In the case
of NN1, the prior is placed on the weights that multiply either input
or hidden nodes, but not on any of the threshold weights. Gamma
priors on these weights ensure that trained models will always be
positively monotonic with respect to their inputs no matter what the
training data.

The gamma prior is implemented by deﬁning a probability
distribution over select weights in the model,

k_le_WM9
pm):ij rm), (9)
J

where j ranges over the components of W to which the gamma
priors are applied. k and 6 are the position and shape parameters
of the distribution, and F(-) is the gamma function. This amounts
to changing the objective of the training algorithm to maximize
likelihood,

L=;[(k—l)long—%]+

Z<tilogzi(W)—I—(l—ti)log[1—zi(W)]>. (10)

i

Notably, the likelihood is undeﬁned when any of the weights with a
gamma prior are <0, ensuring that the weights which maximize the
likelihood will always yield a monotonic model.

Care must be taken to use an optimization algorithm that
appropriately handles undeﬁned output from the objective function.
Alternatively, in conjunction with the gamma prior, each wJ- can be
reparameterized to use a new set of variables V such that wJ- (Vj) = eVJ'
for the weights with gamma priors and wJ- (Vj) =vJ- for the rest.
Now, instead of maximizing the likelihood by adjusting each w], the
optimization algorithm adjusts each vi. The mathematical details of
this strategy yield the objective,

L=Z|:(k—I)Vj—%j:|+
j

Z<tilogzi(W(V))—I—(l—ti)log[1—zi(W(V))]>, (11)

where V is optimized by the gradient descent algorithm. Assuming
that the gradient of W is computable, the gradient of V is computed

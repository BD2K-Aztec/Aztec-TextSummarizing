ABSTRACT

Motivation: A crucial phenomenon of our times is the diminishing
marginal returns of investments in pharmaceutical research and
development. A potential reason is that research into diseases is
becoming increasingly complex, and thus more burdensome, for
humans to handle. We sought to investigate whether we could meas-
ure research complexity by analyzing the published literature.
Results: Through the text mining of the publication record of multiple
diseases, we have found that the complexity and novelty of disease
research has been increasing over the years. Surprisingly, we have
also found that research on diseases with higher publication rate does
not possess greater complexity or novelty than that on less-studied
diseases. We have also shown that the research produced about a
disease can be seen as a differentiated area of knowledge within the
wider biomedical research. For our analysis, we have conceptualized
disease research as a parallel multi-agent search in which each sci-
entific agent (a scientist) follows a search path based on a model of a
disease. We have looked at trends in facts published for diseases,
measured their diversity and turnover using the entropy measure
and found similar patterns across disease areas.

1 INTRODUCTION

Diseases are complex problems investigated by myriads of scien-
tists working in parallel. Most of these scientists work on narrow
niches to produce pieces of knowledge that contribute to our
overall understanding of diseases. This understanding then
enables the test of therapeutic interventions that might be
better alternatives to existing treatments. To investigate this pro-
cess, we have used the analogy of a multi-agent system through-
out this study. We compare disease research with a search
performed by a multi-agent system in which the agents (scien-
tists) explore a space (a disease) to enable the selection of the best
solutions (interventions) to a problem. This analogy has limita-
tions, but it aids in delving into the intrinsic properties of the
problem (the metaproblem). There are similar motivations in
intra-human modeling that can be seen in projects such as the
Virtual Physiological Human (Hunter et al., 2010) or
ApiNATOMY (de Bono et al., 2012).

The search agents in our multi-agent system use models of
reality to guide their path. These models represent the models
that scientists use to guide their research. An important part of

disease research involves building models that recapitulate some
of the main properties of diseases. The best known of these
models are in vitro and in vivo proxies that are lower-cost
lower-risk alternatives to clinical studies (e. g. the unilateral
ureteral obstruction mouse is an animal model for human
kidney disease). There are also disease models of a mathematical
nature that represent diseases at the systems or epidemiological
level. Another type of model is based on the knowledge available
for a disease (Thagard, 2012), such as the models used in know-
ledge-based clinical decision support systems. Biomedical
researchers use knowledge models of diseases (Coden et al.,
2009) based on knowledge acquired from textbooks, scientiﬁc
literature and experimental and clinical experience. They are
made up of multiple elements, which can be clinical, cellular,
molecular and public health related—to name a few. These
models are the focus of this study.

For each disease, researchers pay more attention to different
sets of elements. For example, clinicians may use a patient’s
symptoms, demographics, clinical history and laboratory reports
to evaluate disease progression. Biologists, on the other hand,
may use genes, pathways, organelles and other elements to gen-
erate hypotheses about the mechanism of action of a drug or the
activity of signaling pathways. In a disease such as psoriasis, a
clinician may focus on the relationship between psoriasis area
and severity index (PASI) scores and different immunosuppres-
sive drugs, whereas a biologist may investigate the interplay of
cutaneous and immune cells. In diabetic nephropathy, on the
other hand, the interest may fall on the biology of podocytes
and myoﬁbroblast proliferation or on a patient’s glomerular ﬁl-
tration rate and arterial blood pressure. Thus, different elements
are combined by each scientist to construct a model of reality
that enables reasoning about the disease. We incorporate such
scientiﬁc models in our multi-agent system analogy by postulat-
ing that each scientiﬁc agent has a model of a disease built into
its internal state. This model helps the agent navigate its path and
is based on inputs produced by other agents, such as scientiﬁc
publications, compounds or tools. These models are crucial be-
cause the agents cannot perform their search through brute-force
exploration. They need to choose a path based on the likelihood
of success. Thus, disease models facilitate decision making.

We were interested in learning how the structure of these dis-
ease models can affect the task of the search agents. We started
with the hypothesis that some disease models might be more
complex than others for several reasons. One of the reasons
could come from the number of articles published about a dis-
ease per year, as scientiﬁc publishing has been increasing expo-
nentially across many areas of medical research (Larsen and von
Ins, 2010). Another reason could come from anatomy. For
example, psoriasis is a fairly localized disease of the skin;

however, a disease such as diabetes involves multiple organs and
tissues. Yet another reason could come from the multiplicity of
signaling pathways involved in a disease. Thus, a greater multi-
plicity of elements in a disease could mean a greater search space
to investigate.

A theoretical disease model can further illustrate this latter
point. This theoretical model involves a non-existent animal spe-
cies called bigenes, which has two genes in its genome: A and B.
Bigenes suffers a species-speciﬁc disease called X, which is known
to be driven by a mutation in A. Up to the year t, the literature
on X comprised ﬁve articles focused on gene A. The publication
record about X at time t could be represented as X t = {AAAAA}.
Thus, X t is a simpliﬁed representation of what was known about
X up to time t. The genes belonging to X , may not be disease
genes in a traditional sense, but they represent the scientiﬁc con-
versation taking place about X, even in cases when negative re-
sults are reported, which may be contradicted later on. Deﬁning
‘disease genes’ is in itself a complicated task as the relationship
between a gene and a disease can range from strong and ﬁrmly
established to tenuous, depending on the weight of the existing
evidence.

A breakthrough in the research of X occurred in the year t+ I,
when a mutation in B was newly associated with X. New articles
appeared investigating this association; however, other articles
still focused on A, leading to Xt+1 = {AAAAABABBA}, where
the subsequence {BABBA} corresponds to publications for the
year t+ 1. Thus, the discovery of a mutation in B made the
scientiﬁc model of the disease X more complex, and this is
reﬂected in the publication record. This change in complexity
can be quantiﬁed using the entropy measure from information
theory, which is a common measure of statistical complexity
(F eldman and Crutchﬁeld, 1998) used in biomedical applications
such as monitoring heart rates (Perkiémaki et al., 2005) and
brain electrical activity (Stam, 2005) or in evolutionary biology
(Adami, 2002). The entropy for X t is H (X1) :0, but the intro-
duction of B in year t+ 1 leads to H ( X ,+ 1 ) = 0.88 (see Section 2).
H ( X ,+ 1 ) >H ( X t ) reﬂects the increase in complexity over time.

A number of works have been devoted to analyzing the
growth and evolution of publications on gene and protein inter-
actions outside the context of disease by analyzing the accumu-
lated published record (Arbesman and Christakis, 2011; Cokol
et al., 2005; Cokol and Rodriguez-Esteban, 2006; He and Zhang,
2009; Hoffmann and Valencia, 2003; Pfeiffer and Hoffmann,
2007). However, there is a divergence between the published
record and the focus of active research, as older works fade in
inﬂuence (on average). We believe that practical disease models
do not involve every piece of knowledge published about a dis-
ease. Deﬁning boundaries, nonetheless, is not straightforward. In
the case of the disease X, publications were initially only about
gene A, but that changed after an important discovery. Realizing
this requires speciﬁc knowledge of the disease and a scientiﬁc
consensus that may not be found. To generalize, we have used
a time window. A model containing the state of the art in year
t+ I for a 1-year time window would be X ’ 1+ 1 = {BABBA}. We
call this a fading memory model, and it reﬂects that the older a
ﬁnding is, the less relevant it becomes—just like a fading
memory. This decay can be observed in the evolution of citation
counts of published literature over time.

One shortcoming of the fading memory approach is that some
diseases have much higher publication rate than others.
However, memories may fade faster for diseases with higher
publication rate owing to the ﬁnite memory of the scientists
that study them. A ﬁnite memory approach would consider the
latest 11 publications rather than a time window. In the case of X,
this would mean a disease model X ’ 1+ 1 2 {BA} for a memory size
of 1122. We have centered our analysis on the ﬁnite memory
approach because publication rates change widely over time—
and between diseases—and thus comparing ﬁxed time windows
would require some type of normalization, which could intro-
duce distortions. Nonetheless, the fading memory approach is
also discussed, as will be shown later in the text.

Another important aspect of disease models is their evolution
in time. A rapid pace of change may signify, for example, that the
principles of a disease are not properly deﬁned. A disease model
whose elements have a high turnover rate requires a greater
effort at understanding and leaves less time to devote to its
details. In the case of the disease X, the appearance of B in the
publication record was unexpected, which in Bayesian probabil-
ity terms can be expressed as p(BeX’ t+1 | X ’ t ) = 0. On the other
hand, articles about A were fully anticipated, p( A EX ’ 1+ 1 |
X ’ t ) = 1. Thus, conditional probabilities can be used to gauge
the rate of change in a disease model and the novelty of a ﬁnding.

The bigenes example is about an organism with only two genes
(like some simple viruses), but a similar case could have been
made about an organism with only two cell types because
research emphasis on cell types also changes over time. For
example, much immunological research has been focused on
the T-cell subsets Th1 and Th2, but, recently, there has been
increased emphasis on Th17 and Treg cells, whereas new cell
types, such as Th9 and Th22, are regularly proposed. In this ana-
lysis, we have considered disease models not only involving genes
(as in the bigenes example) but also cell types, drugs and chem-
icals, and we have looked at how they inﬂuence each other.

2 METHODS

Disease literature data came from Medline 2012 release abstracts anno-
tated with at least one disease MeSH term (branch C of the MeSH Tree
Structures, which covers human and animal diseases) and published
between 1970 and 2010. Disease groups were based on the main sub-
branches of the disease MeSH tree. Gene, cell type, drug and chemical
annotations came from GeneView [(Thomas et al., 2012); download July
2012]. GeneView uses the GNAT O-Iakenberg et al., 2011) algorithm for
gene recognition, which showed 82% precision and 82% recall for
abstracts in the BioCreative challenge, and which has been extended to
20 model species. Chemical entity annotations in GeneView come from
ChemSpot (Rocktaschel et al., 2012), which achieves 68% precision and
69.5% recall. Cell types and drugs are based on the AliBaba (Plake et al.,
2006) dictionaries of regular expressions and spelling variations.

For each disease in the MeSH Tree Structures, an ordered sequence
was created X k = {xk,1, xhz, xk,3, .. .}, where each x1“,- is the name of a
gene mentioned in an abstract annotated with the MeSH term corres-
ponding to disease k. Each sequence X k was ordered by publication time.
That is, for every xk,,-, there is an associated time stamp tk,,- for which
tk,,- 5 tkd- if i 5 j. The time stamp was based on the publication date of the
abstract. For publication dates that only specify month and/or year, the
earliest possible date was assigned (e.g. the ﬁrst day of the month). For
publications appearing on the same date, the PubMed ID value was used

to decide order. The X k sequences are, therefore, time series that can be
analyzed and compared.

To apply the ﬁnite memory approach, we considered every possible
ordered sequence X1]; 6 Xk of length n, X1]; = {xk,j,xk,j+1, ...,xk,j+n_1}.
Thus, each X 1k is a disease model of disease k under the ﬁnite memory
approach for a memory of size n. The initial value of n chosen was 100.
Overall conclusions did not change for other values of n tested. Entropy
was computed for each X j , following Shannon’s theorem:

IHX1)=-—§jphADMg@ion», (u
l

where p1,;(Al) is the frequency of gene A, within the sequence X or

pqu=zfﬂﬂfﬁﬁiﬁ, (a
where I x“: A l is a binary function that returns one when ka- is equal to A l,
and zero otherwise. Compare this with the log-entropy models for infor-
mation retrieval in (Roy et al., 2011).
Each H(X was associated to a time stamp ij , which is the average of
the time stamps associated to the xkd- components of X The publication
rate for each X 1k was computed as follows:

To assess the evolution of H(X over time and publication rate,
H(X ~ f (ilk, rjk), two methods were used, which produced similar over-
all picture. The ﬁrst method involved computing for each disease k, the
multiple linear regression between the entropy and the publication time
and publication rate {H(X 171;,  for all j values. The second method
involved creating a random sample of values picked among all the
{H(X {LrJIIC} triplets. Randomization followed these steps: a disease
k was randomly picked and then a random value of j for that disease was
selected. This sampling method was implemented to make sure that dis-
eases with longer sequences did not dominate the results. The random
sample had size 100 000.
To measure the novelty of new ﬁndings, the conditional probability of
an element ka-Jm for each sequence X was computed as follows:

window of we: 10 elements was used:

Control sequences similar to X k were created by shufﬂing the disease
annotations across the corpus (Fisher—Yates random permutation).
Using this method, many of the properties of the dataset, such as the
overall frequency of genes and diseases, are preserved. This represents a
higher bar than alternatives such as generating random disease and/or
gene annotations from a uniform distribution.

The same process was followed with the annotations of chemicals and
drugs. For cell types, however, the data were insufﬁcient to construct X
memory sequences of length 100, and thus length 20 was used instead. Thus,
some of the results presented for cell types are not completely comparable
with the rest. Correlations between the H(X of genes, chemicals, drugs
and cell types for each disease k were performed using entropy sequences
with monthly values based on linear interpolation of the values of H(X

The complexity of disease models made of genes has been
increasing over time, as can be seen in Figure 1. This is reﬂected

in the r2 and the multiple linear regression coefﬁcients in Table 1.
To test the robustness of the result, we changed the value of the
time window (originally n = 100) to n e {25, 50, 75, 100, 125,
150,175,200} and found that the relation persisted and even
became stronger with increasing n. The r2 ﬁt increased with the
size n of the window (r2~ 3.4 x 10—2 ln(n) — 2.8 x 10—2), as did
the coefﬁcients for time (r2~2.3 x 10—2 ln(n) —4.2 x 10—2) and
publication rate (r2~ 1.1 x 10—5 ln(n) — 3.4 x 10—5). Choosing
the value of n is a trade-off between resolution and coverage,
as diseases with less than n published facts are not included in the
analysis. We also looked within disease groups and found similar
patterns (see Fig. 2 and Table 2), with, for example, cardiovas-
cular diseases and nervous system diseases increasing in complex-
ity at a faster pace over the period involved, and neoplasms and
substance-related disorders growing slower.

An illustrative example is the disease retinitis pigmentosa
(RP), a retinal degenerative disease. The entropy of its disease
model over time ﬁts a linear regression with r2 = 0.89 and a posi-
tive slope of 0.13, indicating that its complexity has been increas-
ing over time (see Fig. 2d). The lower early entropy is illustrated
by one of the main genes studied in RP: rhodopsin. Owing to the
early discovery of a rhodopsin mutation associated to RP (Dryja
et al., 1990, 1991), rhodopsin was important in publications
about RP, leading to initial low entropy in the RP disease
model. However, rhodopsin has faded relatively in importance
as many other mutations and genes have been associated to RP
in recent times. The current multiplicity of genes studied has led
to higher entropy in the disease model of RP.

For disease models of chemicals and drugs, we can see a milder
increase in complexity (see Section 2). Thus, the increase in

chemical models in the earlier studies of RP is illustrated by
the relatively higher prominence of ﬂuorescein, whose use
tended to be highlighted in the abstract [e.g. (Best et al.,
1971)], a practice which has faded since. Fluorescein is counted
both as a chemical and as a drug (FDA approved in this case).
Thus, the drug and chemical categories overlap.

The control disease models created by random permutation of
disease annotations (see Section 2) do not show any of these
properties (see Fig. 1d). Moreover, control disease models do
not show the heterogeneity of entropy values seen in actual dis-
ease models, suggesting that entropy differences are signiﬁcant
between disease models. For example, the linear regression that
ﬁts the control gene disease model for RP has r2 and slope close
to 0 and does not show dependence with time. Moreover, the
entropy values are high and close to what a discrete uniform
distribution with sufﬁcient cardinality would produce. Actual
disease models have lower entropy than control disease models
because they are concentrated around certain elements such as
popular genes or drugs and form differentiated areas of know-
ledge, as the RP example shows.

An implication is that 100 randomly selected articles about a
disease should, on average, cover less unique facts (e.g. genes)
than 100 articles picked at random from the overall literature.
This means that the focus of a disease’s research is narrower and
there is more repetition, which gives it more coherence and
makes it more understandable to humans. When the focus of a
disease becomes too broad it could be an indication that the
disease deﬁnition has become too inclusive.

As seen in the disease models of RP, the slope of the linear
regression between entropy and time tends to be positive,

indicating that entropy increases over time. For gene disease
models, the median slope is 0.04184, for chemicals 0.01269 and
for drugs 0.0125 (t-tests showed these values to be signiﬁcantly
>0). The interquartile ranges of the slope values are largely posi-
tive: [0.01668, 0.0746] for genes, [—0.00152, 0.03049] for chem-
icals and [0.0125, 0.03273] for drugs. Looking at all diseases, we
found these values to be unrelated to the average publication
rate, showing that disease models with high average publication
rates are no more complex than those of diseases with low aver-
age publication rates. This is similarly reﬂected in Table 1, where
we show that a small fraction of the increase in complexity is
driven by higher publication rates. For example, in gene disease
models, the linear regression coefﬁcients indicate that a 5000-fold
publication rate increase would increase the complexity as little
as 1 year of time would.

By looking at the RP example alone, we could not have known
whether the increase in entropy of its disease models was some-
how related to the increase in the rate of publications about RP
that happened over the same time period. Our analysis, however,
allows us to say that these two variables are generally unrelated.
Instead, diseases with high publication rates would seem to have
a ‘fast forward’ behavior in which ﬁndings are brought up faster
but without an increase in associated complexity. Thus, the ﬁnite
memory approach chosen here (as described in Section 2) seems
more appropriate to study this phenomenon than the fading
memory approach.

As can be seen in Figure 3 and Table 3, the novelty in disease
models made of genes has been increasing over time as well. This
can be seen in the negative relation between time and the prob-
ability of a publication mentioning a gene that is already in a
disease model. For chemicals, this relationship is barely signiﬁ-
cant, and for drugs, it is not signiﬁcant. The linear regression for
disease models of genes has a median slope of —0.00942 and an
interquartile range of [—0.03115, —0.00101] (here, negative slope
means increased novelty). Increased novelty could be one of the
main drivers of increased entropy, as they are related. In the gene
disease model of RP, novelty increases noticeably with time, and
ﬁts a linear regression of slope —0.07 and r2 of 0.63. From the
complexity and novelty of the disease models of RP, we postulate
that RP has become harder to study over time. RP is not a
unique case, as can be seen in Figure 2 for two disease groups
and multiple sclerosis.

As shown in Table 3, we found that publication rates do not
correlate with novelty. Thus, a slower pace of publication does
not entail a lower appetite for novelty in less-explored diseases.
Control disease models show a more stable and much higher rate
of novelty, as would be expected from a randomly shufﬂed set.

To further study the drivers of complexity in disease models
we measured the correlations between the entropies of disease
models for genes, chemicals and drugs (see Section 2). These
correlations were found to be positive (see Fig. 4 and Table 4),
meaning that increases in one category were correlated with in-
creases in another category, even controlling for the common
increase of entropy over time already described. In the case of
RP, for example, the entropies for the disease models of genes
and chemicals were correlated, with a slope of 0.50 and r2 of 0.58.
This shows that changes in complexity of disease models are not
independent for each category and that it would be reasonable
to consider disease models in a multidimensional fashion, with

different categories of elements interacting with each other rather
than studying them separately. It should also be noted that vari-
ations in complexity for each category may have different prac-
tical impact. For example, an increase in cell type complexity
could be more relevant than an increase in gene complexity
because a gene can be associated to different functions in differ-
ent cell types.

4 CONCLUSIONS

Our study shows quantitatively that the complexity of studying
diseases has been increasing over time. A resulting implication is
that selecting molecular targets in target-based drug discovery
becomes a more arduous task as the search space grows,

especially given the limitations of existing therapeutic tools
(Rodriguez-Esteban et al., 2009). Pharmaceutical companies
need to scrutinize and triage more genes to ﬁnd the best candi-
date for development. The effort increases if the set of genes
being studied changes quickly over time—and the same applies
to cells, tissues and compounds. Further studies are necessary to
ascertain the link between this complexity and increased R&D
costs.

The larger the diversity also means the harder the problem
becomes for the limited human cognitive abilities. This can be
seen in a more simpliﬁed multi-agent search example. In this
setting, scientiﬁc production about a disease comes from agents
that only study and publish about a single gene, without consid-
eration of other genes. These agents publish—all of them—at
exactly the same rate. Some diseases have higher publication

rates, but this is as a result of a larger number of agents working
on them owing to greater perceived signiﬁcance. In this scenario,
it would be possible for those diseases with higher publication
rate to have more complex models because each agent can spe-
cialize in a different gene and create a separate research niche.
Thus, having more agents at work would allow for more band-
width on the production side, particularly ‘brain bandwidth’.

However, we have shown that diseases with higher publication
rate do not have more complex disease models. One explanation
could be that scientists are also consumers of the research pro-
duced by other scientists, and therefore they naturally tend to
follow the path that others have opened (Cokol et al., 2005)—in
some cases because it is the only path being funded. Another
explanation is that individual scientists can only process a certain
level of complexity within the limits of their cognitive abilities
and the technologies available to them. Hence, there would be a
limitation on the consumption side of science, and scientiﬁc
production would tend to adapt its output to this consumption
‘bandwidth’. These explanations would leave the open question
of why disease complexity and novelty have, nonetheless, been
increasing over time, as we have shown. A potential reason is
that technological progress has brought forward high-through-
put experimental and in silico technologies that enhance the
ability of scientists to produce, process and understand large
datasets.

Although genetic screens and other unbiased high-throughput
techniques are less affected by an increase in the multiplicity of
prior knowledge, these experiments usually produce extensive
new results that need to be validated with low-throughput meth-
ods by researchers grappling with them (Mons and Velterop,
2009). We should also note that many high-throughput tech-
niques are not completely unbiased and depend on prior know-
ledge. F or example, the therapeutic usefulness of a cell-based
screen will depend on the choice of cell type.

Repeated failure in clinical trials has led to increased efforts at
patient stratiﬁcation, using such techniques as genotyping or
gene expression analysis. Under the framework presented here,
stratiﬁcation could be understood as a way of drawing more
convenient boundaries to a problem to reduce its complexity.
For example, the diversity found in cancer has led to the prop-
osition that it should be considered a constellation of different
diseases classiﬁed by organs, cell types, molecular proﬁles, driver
somatic mutations, active pathways and so forth, which could be
addressed with computational and text mining approaches
(Clancy et al., 2011). Slicing a problem can be an effective way
to simplify it.

Besides the factors considered here, there are other reasons
why some diseases should be more difﬁcult to investigate, such
as experimental limitations (e. g. lack of satisfactory animal
models or cell cultures such as in neurological disorders, impre-
cise data from high-throughput techniques) or clinical constrains
(e. g. frequent comorbidities, inadequate biomarkers, uncertain
diagnostic tools). Genetic or phenotypic heterogeneity or mul-
tiple associated genetic loci, may hinder the understanding of a
disease’s genetic underpinnings. Other difﬁculties could be driven
by disease-protective mechanisms, such as compensatory feed-
backs, fast mutation rates or redundant pathways that make
diseases robust against therapeutic intervention. Moreover, lit-
erature biases such as unpublished negative results or published

conclusions that are unsupported by the available data, as well as
heterogeneity in the quality of the data, could interplay with the
complexity we are measuring or add another layer to the prob-
lem. Beyond these scientiﬁc factors, non-scientiﬁc ones such as
regulatory and legislative problems or patenting issues can loom
large for certain diseases.

Ultimately, complexity should be considered primarily as caus-
ing a tangible impact to the input factors necessary for scientiﬁc
research (time, money, patients, etc.). In this light, the need for
better understanding is highly relevant, considering the stagnat-
ing pace of pharmaceutical research despite the abundance of
incentives to improve existing therapies.

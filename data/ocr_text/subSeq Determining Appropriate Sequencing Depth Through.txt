ABSTRACT

Motivation: Next-generation sequencing experiments, such as RNA-
Seq, play an increasingly important role in biological research. One
complication is that the power and accuracy of such experiments
depend substantially on the number of reads sequenced, so it is im-
portant and challenging to determine the optimal read depth for an
experiment or to verify whether one has adequate depth in an existing
experiment.

Results: By randomly sampling lower depths from a sequencing ex-
periment and determining where the saturation of power and accuracy
occurs, one can determine what the most useful depth should be for
future experiments, and furthermore, confirm whether an existing ex-
periment had sufficient depth to justify its conclusions. We introduce
the subSeq R package, which uses a novel efficient approach to per-
form this subsampling and to calculate informative metrics at each
depth.

Availability and Implementation: The subSeq R package is available

1 INTRODUCTION

Many next-generation sequencing technologies have been de-
veloped to answer important biological questions. One property
these technologies have in common is that they depend on read
depth or coverage: increasing the number of reads typically in-
creases the power and accuracy. For instance, in RNA-Seq
greater read depth is known to increase the power of differential
expression testing and the accuracy of expression estimates (Liu
et al., 2013; Tarazona et al., 2011). The advent of multiplexed
sequencing means that researchers should consider their read
depth as a trade-off against cost and replication when designing
experiments (Liu et al., 2014), which means knowing the rela-
tionship between read depth and power is essential to designing
sequencing experiments. Similarly, many researchers need to
demonstrate that they have adequate depth in an existing experi-
ment to support their biological conclusions.

One valuable approach that multiple studies have used is to
randomly subsample reads (sometimes called downsampling)

and perform an identical analysis on each subsample. This is in
contrast to methods that ﬁt a parametric model to calculate
power, such as Scotty (Busby et al., 2013). By determining
where metrics of power and accuracy ‘saturate’ with increasing
depth, one can both determine recommendations for future ex-
periments and demonstrate whether an existing experiment has
sufﬁcient depth. Studies have used random subsampling to pro-
pose guidelines for future experiments (Black et al., 2014; Liu
et al., 2014), to perform a survey of different RNA-Seq analysis
methods at varying read depths (Labaj et al., 2011; Liu et al.,
2013; Rapaport et al., 2013), or to demonstrate that they had
achieved adequate read depth (Daines et al., 2011; Toung et al.,
2011; Wang et al., 2011). However, all took the approach of
randomly subsampling from either the fastq or alignment ﬁle,
and then reperforming the analysis, including the computation-
ally intensive step of matching reads to genes, on each ﬁle. This
process is slow, demanding of disk space, and requires possessing
the original reads or mappings, which limits the number of sub-
samples that can be performed and the ease of performing this
analysis on existing experiments.

We introduce the subSeq R package, which instead sub-
samples sequencing reads with binomial sampling after they
have been matched to genes and assembled into a count
matrix. Because the step of matching reads to genes is independ-
ent and deterministic, this approach is functionally identical to
the common approach of subsampling the read alignment ﬁles,
but requires only the count matrix rather than the read alignment
ﬁle. It also takes negligible time and computing resources even
on large datasets, as the steps downstream of the read subsam-
pling are much faster than the upstream steps. A similar ap-
proach is used to generate saturation ﬁgures in the NOISeq
package (Tarazona et al., 2011), but subSeq is designed to be
used with any RNA-Seq analysis method. subSeq could be per-
formed immediately on any experiment in the ReCount resource
of analysis-ready datasets (F razee et al., 2011), and on any RNA-
Seq experiment that provides a matrix of read counts per gene.
An early version of this software was used in Robinson et al.
(2014), on Bar-Seq measurements of the yeast deletion set, to
determine the effect of read depth on detection of differential
abundance.

subSeq also streamlines the process of performing a differen-
tial expression analysis on each subsample, and of calculating
relevant biological metrics for each to determine how they vary
depending on read depth. In particular, subSeq reports metrics
representing (i) the power to detect differential expression or
abundance, (ii) the accuracy of effect size estimation and (iii)

2 METHODS

The user provides an unnormalized M x N matrix X of read counts,
where each row represents one of M genes, each column represents one of
N samples and each value denotes the number of reads aligned to each
gene within each sample. The user also speciﬁes a vector of K subsam-
pling proportions p, each in the interval (0, 1], and the number of repli-
cations to perform at each proportion. For each pk, a subsampled matrix
YU‘) is generated such that H”??n~Binom(Xm,n, pk) for m = 1, . . . , M and
n = 1, ... , N. This is equivalent to allowing each original mapped read to
have probability pk of being included in the new counts, as done, for
example, by the Picard DownsampleSam function.

For each subsample, we perform the same analysis that is performed
on the full set of reads. Multiple approaches for the determination of
RNA-Seq differential expression from a matrix of counts, including
edgeR (Robinson et al., 2010) and DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014), are
built into subSeq, as is DEXSeq for differential exon usage detection
(Anders et al., 2012). The user can also provide a custom method to be
applied to each subsample.

Here we use subSeq to examine the effect of depth on the RNA-Seq
dataset from Hammer et al. (2010), testing for differential expression
between rats with induced chronic neuropathic pain and a control
group. The mapped read counts were downloaded from ReCount, only
samples from the 2-month time point were used, and genes with fewer
than ﬁve mapped reads were ﬁltered out. We subsampled 11 proportions
on a logarithmic scale from 0.01 to 1, performing ﬁve replications at each
proportion.

3 RESULTS

As an illustrative example, we show the results of subsampling
of an RNA-Seq dataset from Hammer et al. (2010), using
edgeR or DESeq2 to normalize and test each subsample for
differential expression. To perform these subsamples manually,
it would have required downloading 11.4 Gb of reads, map-
ping them to the mouse genome, downsampling to produce
an additional 95Gb of alignments, matching each read to the
gene annotations and only then performing the differential
expression analysis. Using subSeq, the subsampling requires
only the 4.9 Mb matrix from the ReCount database, can be
performed entirely in memory in R and takes a negligible
amount of time (<1s to perform the 55 subsamplings, ~2—
8 minutes to perform the analysis at each step, depending on
the method chosen).

After constructing subsamples and performing an analysis on
each, subSeq calculates and visualizes summary metrics about
each sequencing depth (Fig. 1); these plots aid in determining
saturation of depth (Supplementary Fig. S1). As the plots
show how read depth changes the conclusions of the analysis,
the ‘oracle’ is deﬁned as the P—values and estimates at the full
depth. To estimate the power, subSeq determines the number of
genes found signiﬁcant at a given false discovery rate. To deter-
mine whether the decrease in read depth affects speciﬁcity, we
also estimate the false discovery proportion (F DP) at each depth.
subSeq does this by using the qvalue package to estimate the
local false discovery rate for each gene in the oracle, then calcu-
lating the average of the oracle local FDR values among the
genes found signiﬁcant at each depth. To determine how depth

subSeq is designed to allow any analysis to be performed on
each subsample. While the example demonstrated here used
RNA-Seq data, subSeq works equally well on other genomic
approaches such as Bar-Seq or Tn-Seq, as demonstrated in
Robinson et al. (2014).

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Document similarity metrics such as PubMed’s ‘Find
related articles’ feature, which have been primarily used to identify
studies with similar topics, can now also be used to detect
duplicated or potentially plagiarized papers within literature reference
databases. However, the CPU-intensive nature of document
comparison has limited MEDLINE text similarity studies to the
comparison of abstracts, which constitute only a small fraction of a
publication’s total text. Extending searches to include text archived
by online search engines would drastically increase comparison
ability. For large-scale studies, submitting short phrases encased in
direct quotes to search engines for exact matches would be optimal
for both individual queries and programmatic interfaces. We have
derived a method of analyzing statistically improbable phrases (SIPs)
for assistance in identifying duplicate content.

Results: When applied to MEDLINE citations, this method
substantially improves upon previous algorithms in the detection
of duplication citations, yielding a precision and recall of 78.9%
(versus 50.3% for eTBLAST) and 99.6% (versus 99.8% for eTBLAST),
respectively.

Availability: Similar citations identified by this work are freely
accessible in the D j vu database, under the SIP discovery method
category at http://dejavu.vbi.vt.edu/dejavu/

1 INTRODUCTION

Most scientists today face intense competition in the race for
peer recognition, visibility and international acclaim. Academic
distinction is gained based on the number of peer—reviewed
publications in highly circulated journals. This intense pressure
to publish, not only to advance, but also simply to sustain one’s
career, is summarized in the adage, ‘publish or perish’. Because
substantial amounts of time and resources are needed to complete
scientiﬁc studies, there is often a natural desire to seek maximum

beneﬁts for the costs incurred. Unfortunately, this sometimes results
in authors publishing the same piece of work multiple times or,
worse, publishing someone else work as their own.

Some forms of duplicated content, such as those appearing
in publications of conference proceedings, important updates to
studies, conﬁrmation of contested results in controversial studies
and translations of important ﬁndings, may no doubt be beneﬁcial
to the scientiﬁc community. Duplication is seen as unethical when
the primary intent is to deceive peers, supervisors and/or journal
editors with false claims of novel data. Given the large number
of papers published annually, the large diversity of journals with
overlapping interests in which to publish, and the uneven access to
journal publication content, it is not unreasonable to assume that
the discovery of such duplication is rare. The recent development of
algorithmic methods to systematically process published literature
and identify instances of duplicated/plagiarized text as accurately as
possible should serve as an effective deterrent to authors considering
this dubious path. Unfortunately, the methods in place now have a
very limited reach, and are conﬁned to abstracts and titles only.

Several cases of duplicate publication have been described in the
literature with the aim of identifying characteristics and signatures
suggestive of duplication. However, the automatic detection of
duplicate publication is still in its infancy. The majority of studies on
this topic have been relegated to speciﬁc ﬁelds because most tools
lack the technology necessary to quickly and efﬁciently identify
cases of duplication (Bailey, 2002; Barnard and Overbeke, 1993;
Blancett et al., 1995; Bloemenkamp et al., 1999; Chennagiri et al.,
2004; Durani, 2006; Gotzsche, 1989; Kostoff et al., 2006; Martinson
et al., 2005; Mojon—Azzi et al., 2004; Roig, 2005; Rosenthal et al.,
2003; Schein and Paladugu, 2001). Findings among these studies
consistently estimate the duplicate publication rate in biomedical
literature to be a few percent.

We previously reported one of the ﬁrst automated processes to
identify highly similar citations in the MEDLINE database, many of
which were later conﬁrmed as duplicates where substantial portions
of text were simply copied and pasted from the earlier to the later
publication (Long et al., 2009). Conducted via text comparison
algorithm eTBLAST, this process successfully identiﬁed duplicate
citations in the biomedical literature with high speciﬁcity (over 99%)
at the expense of a low sensitivity (~50%) (Errami et al., 2007,

2008). We also performed the ﬁrst large—scale automated detection
of duplicate publications in MEDLINE (Errami and Garner, 2008)
and deposited these ﬁndings into the Deja vu database (Errami
et al., 2009). Our estimate of ~200 000 duplicate publications in
MEDLINE is consistent with previous reports (Martinson et al.,
2005; von Elm et al., 2004).

One weakness of this process, however, is that when calibrated
for high speciﬁcity, eTBLAST omits about one—half of the potential
duplicate publications, and thus has a low sensitivity of detection.
We therefore present a new approach to identify potential duplicate
citations overlooked by the eTBLAST method and provide succinct
search strings suitable for use in online searches. This approach uses
‘statistically improbable phrases’ (SIPs), a concept similar to that
implemented by Amazon.com (http://www.amazon.com/gp/search—
inside/sipshelp.html). Since Amazon.com reveals very little about
how SIPs are calculated or can be used by readers and customers,
we have established our own process to deﬁne, score and use SIPs to
discover previously unidentiﬁed pairs of duplicate citations within
MEDLINE.

2 METHODS

2.1 Hardware and programming tools

Our analysis was performed using a PC with 3.0 GHz processors and 4 GB
RAM under Linux (Suze 10.3). The various scripts for this work were written
in Python (http://www.python.org), but the interpreter was Jython 2.2.1
(http://www.jython.org) rather than Python. This allowed us to combine the
simple and elegant scripting syntax of Python with the powerful indexing
capabilities of Lucene, written in Java. J ython fully interprets Python scripts
and also provides simple ways to call Java native libraries.

2.2 MEDLINE datasets

This work was conducted using the entire MEDLINE database as of January
2009. The database was stored as pairs of values (PMID, ‘title + abstract’)
in a MySQL database (http://www.mysql.com) and combined with a Lucene
index (http://lucene.apache.org) for fast and efﬁcient retrieval. The indexing
mode was set to keep the text structure intact and include punctuation signs,
e.g. ‘thus’ and ‘thus’, are distinct. From this database, we constructed three
test sets of citation pairs—two sets with no duplicate pairs and one set of
duplicates. The ﬁrst set of 5000 non—duplicate pairs was obtained by pairing
10 000 randomly selected MEDLINE abstracts. Almost all pairs of articles
in this set are non—duplicates because the occurrence of duplicate citations
in MEDLINE is low enough that the probability of two randomly selected
citations being duplicates is almost zero (Errami et al., 2008). That is, if
1% of papers are duplicates, then the odds of selecting a duplicate pair
is .01*.01 20.0001. A second set of 5000 pairs was obtained by randomly
pairing 10000 related but non—duplicate citations. For each of the pairs in
this second set, one Citation was randomly chosen from MEDLINE and then
paired with one article returned from PubMed’s ‘Related articles’ feature,
excluding the top—most related article. We already know that if a citation
has a duplicate, it appears as the top—most related article 73% of the time
(Errami et al., 2008). However, if the duplicate is not the top—most related
article, there is a low probability of the duplicate appearing in PubMed’s
related article list (data not shown). Therefore, pairs of related articles are
likely not duplicates if the top—most related article is not chosen. The third
test set contained 1300 manually veriﬁed duplicate citation pairs obtained
from the De’ja vu database (Errami et al., 2008).

In order to estimate the performance of SIPs for the identiﬁcation of
highly similar citations, a set of 10000 random citation pairs, as well as
a 171 MEDLINE duplicates (Citations tagged as duplicates in MEDLINE),

were used to estimate the algorithm performance, following our previously
reported method (Errami et al., 2008).

2.3 SIP analysis

2.3.1 SIP scoring as the product of successive bigram transition
probabilities In this study, the words ‘sentences’ and ‘phrases’ are used
interchangeably without underlying grammatical notion. Both words simply
refer to a set of n words in a particular order. As a measure of SIP quality,
we established a scoring scheme based on an n—gram model of word to word
transition probabilities. In an ideal n—gram model, the n—th word depends
on the n—l previous words and the transition probability from word 1
to word n is P(wn|wn_1,wn_2,..., w1). Assuming a model where n=2,
i.e. a string is 2 words in length, we counted 164.3 million bigrams in
the 2009 version of MEDLINE and calculated their associated transition
probabilities as the likelihood of word B following word A. Since there are
almost 16 million unique words in MEDLINE, if every word was equally
likely to follow another, there would be 2.7%16 possible bigrams. This
equates to an average of 10.3 possible words B likely to follow each unique
word A, assuming a non—linear distribution. Extrapolating this to approximate
the number of possible 6—grams produces close to two trillion combinations
of words, each with its own associated probability. Thus, it is impractical
to use a 6—gram model because its many possible combinations do not
permit the efﬁcient storage, indexing and searching of a database of n—gram
expressions and their transition probabilities. Therefore, we approximated
the transition probabilities by decomposing n—grams into successive bigrams.
The transition probability for an n— gram is then the product of the transition
probabilities obtained for the pairs of words in the n—gram:

n
P: (WnIWn—1,Wn—2,,W1) = HP(Wi|Wi—1)
i=2

Bigram probabilities for MEDLINE were calculated using Python and the
Natural Language ToolKit (NLTK) package (http://nltk.sourceforgenet). We
chose the phrase size for this study to be six words, and obtained probabilities
for 6—grams ranging from 10‘22 to 1. For each phrase, we deﬁned its
probability of being observed in another document as score = —log(P).

2.3.2 Measuring citation similarity using SIP score ratios For each pair
of citations, the SIP score ratio was deﬁned as follows:

(i) Six—word phrases common to both citations were identiﬁed by moving
a six—word window on the target citation one word at a time. A SIP
score was determined for each phrase’s individual probability of being
observed in MEDLINE, and the scores were summed. This sum is
denoted Sfound because it is the sum of the scores of the SIPs found in
both citations.

(ii) For whichever citation of the pair had fewer words, the SIP score was
obtained by summing the scores of all its SIPs. This sum is denoted
SmX because it is the score that would be obtained for Sfound if the two
citations were identical.

(iii) The score ratio for the two citations was calculated as score
ratio = Sfound/Smax. Score ratio is a measure of the degree of similarity
between the two citations and ranges from zero, if the two citations
have no SIPs in common, to one, if the citations are identical.

2.3.3 SIP performance evaluation In order to evaluate SIP performance,
we estimated sensitivity (recall), speciﬁcity, positive predictive value
(precision) and negative predictive value as described previously for the
search engine eTBLAST (Errami et al., 2008).

2.3.4 SIP comparison with eTBLAST We have previously shown that
eTBLAST can be used to detect highly similar citations (Errami et al.,
2008). The calibration of eTBLAST for the detection of duplicate citations
in MEDLINE has been described in detail (Errami et al., 2008). Brieﬂy,
when the title and abstract of a MEDLINE citation are queried against the

Statistically improbable phrases

 

MEDLINE database using eTBLAST, the algorithm returns a list of citations
in order of their similarity to the query, as well as a similarity score for each.
The most similar citation is, of course, the citation itself, labeled the Rank 1
citation. We label the most similar non—identical citation the Rank 2 citation,
the second most similar non—identical citation Rank 3, etc. Figure 1 displays
the similarity scores of Rank 2 citations plotted against the ratios of Rank 2
to Rank 1 similarity scores. The division of this plot into four distinct regions
separates the citations pairs into groups with the following characteristics:

Region A: despite relatively high eTBLAST scores, the ratios of Rank 2
to Rank 1 scores are too low to merit classiﬁcation of these pairs as highly
similar while still maintaining high sensitivity and speciﬁcity.

Region B: highly similar citation pairs with a speciﬁcity >99% and a
sensitivity of ~50%. Separation of this region was speciﬁcally chosen to
maximize speciﬁcity at the expense of sensitivity.

Region C: despite high score ratios, the Rank 1 and Rank 2 scores are
too low for eTBLAST to achieve acceptable performance in the detection of
potential duplicate pairs. This region is small and relatively unpopulated.

Region D: because most of the citations in this region have very little
in common, both the similarity scores and score ratios are low. eTBLAST
is considered ineffective at this point. Most citation pairs in MEDLINE,
whether related, duplicates, or not, fall into this region. It is important to
note that this region contains most of the potential duplicate pairs missed by
eTBLAST due to speciﬁcity constraints.

SIPs proved successful in the identiﬁcation of duplicate citation pairs
in Regions B and C. Because Region A contained very few (<20) known
duplicates (data not shown), we focused on using SIPs to identify duplicate
Citation pairs contained in Region D.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Identiﬁcation of the smallest number of words able
to constitute a SIP

To identify the minimum number of successive words needed to
constitute a SIP for use in searches and comparisons, 6 sets of 200
random abstracts were created and scanned using an n—word—window
where n is the number of words, ranging from 3 to 8. To minimize
the bias that occurs when smaller phrases are found, different sets
of 200 abstracts were used for each value of n. Therefore, counts
of common longer phrases (i.e. ﬁve words) will not be biased if
two pairs of citations have common shorter phrases (i.e. three or
four words). The number of SIPs and abstracts used are presented
in Table 1.

For each sentence size, the cumulative sentence count and the
average count per sentence in MEDLINE were calculated. The
cumulative sentence count is the sum of the counts of all sentences
of size n. The average count is the cumulative count divided by the
number of sentences used, ranging from 5470 for 3 word—sentences

to 2 for 8—word sentences. We chose to set the standard SIP size to
six words because it represents the smallest possible sentence size
for which the average count is acceptably small (22 versus 109 for
5—word sentences). See Figure 2.

3.2 SIPs outperform eTBLAST in the identiﬁcation of
highly similar citations

We examined SIP performance for the detection of duplicate
publications as a function of the SIP score ratio threshold. The best
compromise between precision and recall is obtained at a threshold
of 0.1 (F —measure = 81.4%), as shown in Figure 3.

The compared statistics presented in Table 2 show that because
of the substantial increase in sensitivity, SIPs largely outperform
eTBLAST in the detection of duplication publications.

To conﬁrm our results, SIP overlap was analyzed in the three
sets of randomly selected citation pairs, related citation pairs and
duplicate citation pairs. Summarized in Figure 4, these results verify
that, although the same SIP is seldom found in two random articles
or two related but non—duplicate articles, one or more identical SIPs
are commonly found in both abstracts of a duplicate pair.

3.3 SIPs identify duplicate citations when eTBLAST
cannot

To test the SIP method for identifying duplicate citation pairs not
found by eTBLAST, 10 000 citation pairs were selected from region
D of Figure 1. SIP scores were calculated for each of the citations and
the score ratio was subsequently calculated for each pair. Beginning
with the highest score ratios, pairs of citations were compared by
eye to determine whether or not they were duplicates. Findings are
summarized in Figure 5. All citation pairs with score ratios above
0.2 were duplicates. As the score ratio decreased below 0.2, the
false positive rate of duplicates increased. Optimum performance
was obtained with a score ratio of 0.1, a threshold for which 65%
[65/(65 +35)] of the pairs were duplicates. These results conﬁrm
that SIP analysis identiﬁes with near 100% speciﬁcity the duplicate
citation pairs not amenable to analysis by eTBLAST.

4 DISCUSSION

SIPs have been shown to provide a more sensitive method of
duplicate identiﬁcation than eTBLAST, the only tool currently used
to identify duplicate citations. We have demonstrated that the SIP
method performs well in areas where eTBLAST operates with low
sensitivity. Indeed, eTBLAST has been shown to underperform in
abstracts whose text similarity is low and whose size is small,
i.e. below four sentences (data not shown). SIPs also outperform
eTBLAST in computation power. Whereas eTBLAST runs on a 40
CPU cluster and typically compares one abstract to all others in
PubMed in ~40s to 1min, the SIPs of an abstract are searched
through PubMed in 69 s on average and the process can be run on
a single CPU. Although the parallelization of the SIP code has not
been performed on a cluster of 40 CPUs, it would likely result in a
substantial gain of speed when compared with eTBLAST.

Fig. 5. A total of 10000 citations predicted as not highly similar by
eTBLAST and submitted to a SIP analysis. The SIP ratio represents
the SIP similarity between two citations. The X—axis of this ﬁgure is
non—discriminatory and is used to improve readability of the ﬁgure.

In spite of this enhanced performance, the false positive rate of SIP
analysis is roughly equivalent to that of eTBLAST. False positives
are highly similar citations not otherwise considered to be duplicates.
For these cases, the use of a text similarity tool (using a bag of word
approach like eTBLAST or short similar sentences with SIPs) would
fail because text similarity does not account for natural syntactic
inconsistencies such as synonym use or grammatical variations.

When using an appropriate threshold for the SIP score ratio—
0.1 in this analysis—few false negatives were found. Although
we cannot measure the exact number without visually inspecting
thousands of pairs, we estimate the false negative rate of SIP analysis
to be ~18% when calculated using duplicates tagged in PubMed.

Both eTBLAST and SIP analysis use exceedingly simple text
comparison techniques compared to advanced natural language

processing algorithms, yet these tools have proven effective at
identifying the majority of duplicate citations. The exhaustive
identiﬁcation of all duplicates in MEDLINE will necessitate the
development of more sophisticated tools to analyze grammar
and extract meaning from sentences rather than rely on word
comparisons only. Unfortunately, increased awareness of such
technology could lead to an ‘arms race’, whereby authors wishing
to plagiarize seek to exploit these areas of weakness in order to
avoid detection. However, since most publications are now stored
electronically, these authors will have to contend with the possibility
that although the technology needed to detect these exploitations is
not available now, it may be in the near future—at which point any
hidden indiscretions may quickly rise to the surface.

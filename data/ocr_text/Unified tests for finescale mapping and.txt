Abstract

Motivation: In searching for genetic variants for complex diseases with deep sequencing data,
genomic marker sets of high—dimensional genotypic data and sparse functional variants are quite
common. Existing sequence association tests are incapable of identifying such marker sets or indi—
vidual causal loci, although they appeared powerful to identify small marker sets with dense func—
tional variants. In sequence association studies of admixed individuals, cryptic relatedness and
population structure are known to confound the association analyses.

Method: We here propose a unified marker wise test (uFineMap) to accurately localize causal
loci and a unified high—dimensional set based test (uHDSet) to identify high—dimensional
sparse associations in deep sequencing genomic data of multi—ethnic individuals with random
relatedness. These two novel tests are based on scaled sparse linear mixed regressions with Lp
(0 < p< 1) norm regularization. They jointly adjust for cryptic relatedness, population structure
and other confounders to prevent false discoveries and improve statistical power for identifying
promising individual markers and marker sets that harbor functional genetic variants of a com—
plex trait.

Results: With large scale simulation data and real data analyses, the proposed tests appropriately
controlled Type I error rates and appeared to be more powerful than several prominent methods.
We illustrated their practical utilities by the applications to DNA sequence data of Framingham
Heart Study for osteoporosis. The proposed tests identified 11 novel significant genes that were
missed by the prominent famSKAT and GEMMA. In particular, four out of six most significant path—
ways identified by the uHDSet but missed by famSKAT have been reported to be related to BMD or
osteoporosis in the literature.

Unified tests for ﬁne-scale mapping and identifying sparse

1 Introduction

Deep sequencing technologies have been generating huge amounts
of data of rare and common DNA sequence variants. A number of
sequence association tests have been developed to identify marker
sets, e.g. a group of SNPs or CNVs (copy—number variations), that
contain functional genetic variants. Most of these tests, however, do
not jointly model cryptic relatedness, population structure and other
covariates. With the growing demand of analyzing next generation
sequencing data of multi—ethnic individuals, linear mixed models
have become popular because of their demonstrated effectiveness in
accounting for sample relatedness (Amos, 1994) and population
structure which occurs when there are large—scale systematic differ—
ences in genetic ancestry among individuals in a sample. Typical ex-
amples include individuals with various levels of immigrant ancestry
and more recent shared ancestors than one would expect in a
homogenies population. Cryptic relatedness, refers to the presence
of relatives in a sample of ostensibly unrelated individuals, could
pose more serious confounding than population structure (Devlin
and Roeder, 1999), especially for samples from small and isolated
populations (Voight and Pritchard, 2005). Accounting for popula—
tion structure is more challenging when family structure or cryptic
relatedness is also present (Price et 61]., 2010). We paved the way to
correct for the effects of both confounders jointly.

Within the framework of linear mixed models, famSKAT (Chen
et 61]., 2013) and GEMMA (Genome—wide Efficient Mixed Model
Association) (Zhou and Stephens, 2012) appeared as two powerful
sequence association tests for identifying small marker sets that har-
bor dense functional genetic variants. FamSKAT is a set based test
which is an extension of SKAT to be applicable to family data.
GEMMA is a computationally efficient method for fitting multivari-
ate linear mixed models. These prominent tests require that the
number of markers in a testing set is much smaller than the sample
size. However, in deep sequencing studies, one encounters quite
often high—dimensional data sets (HDS), where the number of
marker loci is larger than the sample size and the number of func—
tional variants is very small. The aforementioned tests are incapable
of identifying such sparse HDS and the functional variants. Some
sparse regression methods were developed to localize individual
functional markers from high-dimensional marker sets, ointly mod-
eling pedigree structure and population structure. They include
Lasso (Rakitsch et 61]., 2013), Ridge regression (Endelman, 2011),
Elastic—net (Zou and Hastie, 2005) and the USR that we proposed
recently (Cao et 61]., 2014). However, these methods yield biased so—
lutions and are ineffective to prevent false discoveries of random
markers and high-dimensional marker sets irrelevant to functional
variants.

In this article, we first present a unified test (uFineMap) for ac—
curately localizing individual causal loci. The uFineMap is a marker
wise test under a scaled sparse linear mixed regression, which jointly
models marker wise effect, relatedness and population stratification.
It applies scaled Lp (0 < p < 1) norm regularization to generate a de-
biased solution. Next, we present an additional significant test (uni-
fied high—dimensional set based test, uHDSet) for identifying high-
dimensional sparse associations in deep sequencing genomic data of
related individuals. The uHDset integrates the marker wise statistics
of the uFineMap to identify susceptible high-dimensional marker
sets. In the uHDSet, the dependence among markers is modeled to
appropriately control set—based Type I error rates. Under extensive
simulations, the uFineMap outperformed the GEMMA (Zhou and
Stephens, 2012) and a Scaled Lasso based method (Javanmard and
Montanari, 2014). The uHDSet yields higher statistical power than

famSKAT and GEMMA. Applications to Framingham Heart Study
also show that our methods yield novel interesting candidate genes
and pathways for follow—up studies, showing its advantages over the
two compared prominent alternative methods. Finally, caveats of
the proposed methods and perspective future efforts are discussed.

2 Methods

We focus on constructing statistical tests for high-dimensional gen-
etic data with cryptic relatedness. We propose two significance tests:
uFineMap test (single marker/variant test) and uHDSet test (unified
high-dimensional set test or whole regional test). Similar to
Buhlmann (2013) and Javanmard and Montanari (2014), we de—
velop uFineMap significance test for single variants based on the
scaled sparse regression (Sun and Zhang, 2012), which is a general-
ization of ordinary sparse regression. Furthermore, we build new
statistics for the uHDSet test based on a combination of marker wise
statistics. The uHDSet test facilitates us to identify susceptible genes
or genetic regions instead of single variants.

2.1 Unified scaled Lp norm regularized regression
At first, we need to define some basic notations. Let n denote the
number of subjects; m denotes the number of independent variables
(SNPs); and L represents the number of covariates. Suppose we have
dependent variable Y = (321,322,  ,yn)T, which stands for pheno-
type for each subject. X : (x1,x2,  ,xn) is a nxm matrix where
the row x,- : (xi1,x,-2,..,x,-m)T represents genotype data for the ith
subject. Typically, genotypes are coded as 0, 1 or 2 which denote
the number of copies the minor allele. (ann : (gal-7i) is the kinship
matrix or IBD (identity-by-descent) matrix. The kinship coeffi-
cient to” measures the relatedness between individual i and j. W :
(1111,1112, ... ,wn) is an nxL matrix, where w,- : (uh-1, wig, ... ,wiL)T
represents the covariates, e.g. age, sex, height and weight.

We assume that the phenotypes, genotypes and covariates are

associated with the following linear mixed model:
Y 2 W0! + X13 + s (1)

where 8~N(0,2:GCZD(I)+0§I,,), oz=(oc1,oc2,...,ocL)T and

nent ratio 0,21, / of of covariant matrix )2. In this article, we use
Gemma method to evaluate the C(21) / of ratio.

In model (1), the regression coefficients [3: (ﬂ1,ﬂ2,  ,ﬂm)T
represent the effect of variants which are the most important vari—
ables we are interested in. However, the high-dimensionally of gen-
etic data will easily lead to over—fitting problem under regular
regression model. To overcome this issue, a general form of the uni-
fied sparse regression model with Lp (0 < p < 1) norm regularization
was proposed by USR paper with the following minimization prob-
lem (Cao et 61]., 2014):

(p, a) = argmin (Y — Wot — xp)T2—1(Y — W0! — X13) + mp”; (2)
BERm,a€RL

where the Lp (0 < p < 1) norm regularization is defined by
MIMI; = (Zia-rho < p < 1
i=1

As is well—known (Cao et 61]., 2014; Chen et 61]., 2010; XU et 61].,
2012) that Lp (0 < p < 1) norm regularization results in a sparser so—
lution than L1 norm regularization, which was widely popularized
by the Lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator)

S.Cao et al.

 

(Tibshirani et al., 1996). In particular, previous simulation results in
Cao et al. (2014) suggest that the use of the L03 norm regulariza-
tion, in order to achieve a proper sparsity level of the solution with
great computational efficiency. To keep the method ﬂexible, we also
offer users different choices for the Lp (0 <1) < 1) norm in our R
code.

In addition to the selection of the Lp norm, the regularization
(tuning) parameter 2 largely affects the solution of Equation (2) as
well. In general, the choice of 2 is regarded as a difficult problem.
Popular methods for this purpose include the minimization of either
the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) or the Akaike information
criterion (AIC) as a function of 2, cross—validation, and stability se—
lection (Meinshausen and Buhlmann, 2010) to select 2. However,
none of these methods can be applied to control the Type I error, es—
pecially for a region—based significance test.

By adopting the idea of scaled sparse linear regression (Sun and
Zhang, 2012), which jointly estimates the regression coefficients
and the noise level of the data, we avoid the regularization param—
eter selection problem. The estimated noise level is used for bias cor—
rection. The obtained de—biased estimator is applied to perform
marker wise significance tests for each variant.

The scaled Lp norm based sparse regression model is given by

In the unified scaled sparse regression the tuning parameter 2 is
updated iteratively, which requires an initial value 20. However, the
sensitivity of the results to the selection of 20 is low. Moreover, de—
biased estimators can be constructed to balance out the bias in the
estimated noise level 6' and the bias caused by the Lp norm regular—
ization, which are both proportional to the initial 20. The asymp—
totic distribution of the de—biased estimators can then be derived
without major difficulties.

To solve the optimization problem (3), we combine the algo—
rithm for unified Lp norm based sparse regression with that for the
general scaled sparse regression (Sun and Zhang, 2012) and propose
the following algorithm.

2.2 The bias correction of unified scaled Lp norm
regularized sparse regression
Lasso, Ridge regression, and many other popular regression methods
utilize a regularization term, in order to obtain a stable solution on an
HDS. The L1 norm regularization term used in Lasso typically shrinks
many regression coefficients to zero. This, however, introduces a bias
making the non-zero regression coefficients smaller in magnitude.
Adopting the idea of unbiased estimation (Javanmard and
Montanari, 2014), we develop a unbiased estimator to recover the un—
biased regression coefficients, and to assess the corresponding asymp—
totic Gaussian distribution. A detailed algorithm is presented below.

 

The algorithm for unbiased estimator

 

Step 1: Set 3) =  where 2 and 6' are the estimated parameters of
the uniﬁed scaled sparse regression (3)

Step 2: Set 2 = (xTz-1X) /n

Step 3: For i = 1,2, . . . ,m, solve u,- by the following constraint
convex program:

minimize uz-TZui
subject to ||Zu,- — e,-||00 g y

Because the calculation of each u,- is independent. To increase
the computation speed, we parallelize the calculation.

Step4: SetM: (m1,m2,  ,mm)T (4)

If any of the above problems is not feasible, then set M : Imxm
Step 5 : Define the unbiased estimator by

[3“ = A +%MXT2‘1(Y — xp) (5)

 

where [3 is the solution of formula (3).

2.3 Hypothesis tests and confidence intervals
To clarify the problem, we assume Y is the covariates adjusted
phenotype. After ignoring the covariates, the true model becomes:

Y = x130 + s, s N N(0, 2 2 ago + c531,) (6)

where [30 is the ground truth regression coefficients and stands for
true signal.

We define the sparse level of [30 as So : {ie {1,2,  ,m}|
ﬂoji 7E 0}. In this article, we apply a weak assumption for the sparse
model, which is so : |So| : o( n/log(m)). Without any further no—
tice, we always assume that this assumption holds. Although the
sparse ground truth is preferred, our method is also robust for the
non—sparse setting, according to the simulation result in
Supplementary Figs 5.88 and 5 .98 in the Appendix.

2.3.1 uFineMap test

For each predictor i, we need to develop a significance test to deter—

mine whether the corresponding regression coefficient ﬂl- is signifi-

cant or not. For a specific 1' E {1, 2, . . . ,m}, we define the null

hypothesis H0, ﬂ,- = 0 versus the alternative hypothesis H1: ﬂ,- 7é 0
Supposing the model (6) stands and considering the unbiased esti—

mator (5 ), we prove that the following asymptotic distribution holds

nu?“ — (3°) iN(o, oZMXT2—1XMT), (7)

where M is defined by formula (4). The detailed proof is given in
Theorem 1 in Appendix.

With this theorem, we can directly derive the significance test for
each marker, e.g. uFineMap test. The p—value for each variable can
be calculated by the following:

where q) is the cumulative distribution function of a standard nor—

 

P(:‘)=2 1—q> ,i:1,2,...,m (8)

mal distribution.

2.3.2 uHDSet test

The next major question is how to control the family—wise error
rates (FWER) to claim the whole significant genetic region. Besides
Bonferroni—Holm correction or some existing multiple testing cor—
rection methods to control the FWER or false discovery rate
(Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995, 2000). We are commitment to de—
veloping a powerful and efficient multiple testing adjustment, taking
dependence into consideration, which would be more powerful than
uncorrelated adjustment.

For uHDSet test, the null hypothesis is H0, ﬂl : ﬂz :  :
ﬂm : 0, and the alternative hypothesis is H1, 36,- 7E 0, i E {1,
2,  ,m}.

Inspired by the idea of van de Geer et al. (2014), we develop a
new statistic for uHDSet significance test by utilizing the previous
uFineMap statistics: S : maxiegjzj  7m} 

For an arbitrary z E R, the following equation holds

W:
P(S S zIX) — P(. max I I
,e{1,2,  ,m} 6 [MXT2_1XMT]H

where W~N(0,&2MXT2_1XMT). The proof is presented in
Theorem 2 in Appendix.

Under null hypothesis H0, ﬂl : ﬂz :  : ﬂm : 0, statistic S
is asymptotically equivalent to the maximum of a series of de—

 

SZIX) —>0

pendent 12(1) variables, whose distribution relies on the design ma—
trix XT2_1X. For any fixed matrix XT2_1X, we simulate its
distribution and use its quantile to estimate the p—value of the
uHDSet statistic S.

3 Results

To validate our proposed tests, we conducted simulations under var—
ious types of pedigree structures to demonstrate their performances
comprehensively, in terms of both Type I error rates control and
statistical power.

3.1 Nuclear family simulation

We use the following linear model to generate simulation data with
nuclear family structure (each family consists of two children and
their parents):

Y = bxp0 + s, s N N(O, 2) (9)

where b is the effect size for causal marker; )2 : 1 / 3(1) —1— 2 / 31.

We randomly assign 30% of variables to be rare variants [minor
allele frequency (MAF) < 1%], 20% of variables to be low fre—
quency variants (1% < MAF < 5%) and the rest variables to be com—
mon variants (5% < MAF < 50%).

3.1.1 Data generation
The basic procedure of performing nuclear family simulation is as
follows:

Step 1: Given MAF for each variable, set the ground truth [30 with
10 causal variants (ﬁve of them are rare variants); set the correl—
ation matrix K),- : lel, where i,j E {1,2,  ,m} and the coefﬁ—
cient p determines the correlation for each pair of variables. We
set p = 0.6 throughout the simulation.

Step 2: Sampling Eixm N N(0, I (29 K) and Eﬁxm ~ N(0, I (29 K)

Step 3: For each subject 1' and variable 1', update the genotype matrix
by: X,,- = 1(E}, > o—1(maf(j))) + I(E,2, > o—1(maf(j))).

Step 4: Generate the vector of trait values of 11 subjects according to
model (9) for a given [9. The selection of b is discussed at Section
3.1.3.

3.1.2 Type I error rates evaluation

To validate if the proposed significant tests can control the Type I
error rates, we generated genotype data by the procedure in Section
3.1.1, setting 11 = 500 and m = 1000. The trait value is generated by
Y = 8 N N (0,2). We replicated this simulation 1000 times and re—
corded the corresponding p—values to draw quantile—quantile (Q—Q)
plots. Under null hypothesis, the quantile of the p—value should fol—
low the uniform distribution U(0,1).

Figure 1 illustrates most points are aligned near the diagonal
line, which is expected. The two dashed curves represent 95% con—
centration band (CB). With all the points concentrated within the
95 % CB, we concluded that the observed p—values follow the uni—
form distribution over interval (0,1). The Q—Q plot assures that the
Type I error rates of uFineMap test is appropriately controlled.

Figure 2 shows that the distribution of uHDSet test’s p—values
agrees with the uniform distribution, indicating the validity of the
adjustment of multiple testing. Therefore, we can draw a conclusion
that both of our uFineMap test and uHDSet test can control the
Type I error rates appropriately.

3.1.3 Statistical power analysis

The design matrix is simulated by the same procedure as in Section
3.1.1. As typical, we set the nominal significance level at 0.05 and
generated the trait values with respect to various values of heritabil—
ity H. We define the heritability H to be the ratio of variance be—
tween true signal and the total variance of trait value, which can be
explicitly written as:

_ b2 VdT(XBO) _ b2 VdT(XBO)
_ Var(Y) _ b2 Var(XBO) + Var(s)

Let the ground truth signal to be

, i.e. the true marker set to be re—

covered. We set two of the causal variants to be rare variants and
the other four as common variants. We increased the heritability H
from 0 to 1 and calculated its power at each point. For the sake of
saving computational time, we only repeated the procedure 2000
times for each given H.

The statistical power for the uFineMap test is defined as
Power : 23:1 $512,650 I[P(i) < 0.05]/T, where T is the simulation
replicates; P(i) is the p—value from uFineMap test of 1th marker and
I () is the indicator function.

For uHDSet test, P(t) represents the p—value calculated at t—th
simulation. We define the empirical statistical power to be

Power =

T I[P(t) < 0.05]/T

t—1

To evaluate our method, we compare the uFineMap test with
other high-dimensional inference methods [e.g. Scaled Lasso
(Javanmard and Montanari, 2014), single marker )(2 test and
Gemma (Zhou and Stephens, 2012)]. For the uHDSet test compari—
son, we additionally consider a popular regional based association
test, famSKAT (Wu et al., 2011). The results are shown in Figs 3
and 4, respectively.

In Fig. 3, the uFineMap test performs uniformly better than
Scaled Lasso test, Gemma and the single marker test. It indicates
that the uFineMap test has a noticeable power gain to identify both
common and rare causal variants.

Figure 4 evaluates different methods’ performance with respect
to sample size changes. It illustrates that our uFineMap test overall
outperforms other two methods especially when the sample size are
small. Meanwhile, all the competing methods show a similar pattern
for a large sample problem.

Similar to Figs 3, 4, 5 and 6 indicate that the statistical power of
all regional tests will increase with the growth of sample size and
heritability, which is consistent with our expectation. In addition, at
the lower sample size area, our uHDSet test performs much better
than famSKAT and Gemma. With the increase of the sample size,
the powers of the three methods converge to the same value.

In conclusion, our proposed tests have higher power than com—
peting existing methods regardless of heritability. Meanwhile, it per—
forms almost equally well for large sample size data.

3.2 Complex family simulation

own or over—simplified simulation data, we used the software

the Type I error is well controlled under the null hypothesis.

We randomly assign 50 causal variants (25 common, 25 rare) to
generate the continuous phenotype. Additionally, we proposed two
simulation setting for markers effects. We assign all causal markers
to be positively related to the trait value for the same causal direc—
tion setting. For the different causal direction setting, half of the
causal markers are randomly given a negative relationship with the
trait value.

Figures 7 and 8 present the comparison of three competing meth—
ods under same direction and different direction settings, respect—
ively. The similar patterns also occurred at a marker wise tests
comparison. To make the presentation concise, we only show the re—
sult of regional tests, and the result of marker wise tests can be
found in the Appendix (Supplementary Figs 5 .3S and 5 .48). We can
draw the conclusion that all three methods are robust with respect
to causal variants direction. But our uHDSet test is almost uniformly
more powerful than Gemma and famSKAT for SeqSIMLA simula-
tion data.

3.3 Analysis of sequence data from Framingham Heart
Study

To demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods for real genetic
variants detection, we applied them to the analysis of sequence data
of Framingham Heart Study. This dataset contains both GWAS and
next generation sequencing (NGS) data from 4229 subjects with
HipBMD data. We used the FISH (Zhang et al., 2014) method for
genotype imputation and selected HipBMD as the phenotype data.
After quality control, we obtained 3322 individuals with 6 500 475
SNPs in total. We apply two kinds of data analysis strategies: whole
genome analysis and pathway—based analysis.

3.3.1 Whole genome analysis
We separate each chromosome into several genetic windows and
then apply our uFineMap and uHDSet tests in each window. We set

the window size to be 100 kb base pairs. After the separation, the
whole genome is separated by a total number of 16514 sets of
markers. The phenotype is adjusted by the covariates and the top 10
principle components of the genotype before the application of the
proposed method. Following the same process as in the simulation
studies, we obtain the results and draw the Manhattan plots for 22
chromosomes, as shown in Figs 9 and 10, respectively. Additional
results of Manhattan plots for the whole genome (i.e. from chromo-
some 1 to 22) with higher resolution are presented in Appendix.

By combining the overlapped region of Figs 9 and 10, the
uHDSet test report 68 regions of highest susceptibility that exceed a
p—value threshold of 0.001. The reported p—value is based on the
whole regional test. According to GeneCards websites, there are 11
genes (Table 1) within the selected regions that are associated with
BMD or osteoporosis disease, which further confirms our findings.
However, these 11 genes are missed by the use of famSKAT and
Gemma method. The reported p—value of Gemma is generated by
the minimal p-value after Bonferroni correction for the SNPs within
the region.

For the marker wise test, the uFineMap test report 82 susceptible
SNPs that exceed a p—value threshold of 10‘s. Table 2 shows the six
reported SNPs that are associated with BMD or osteoporosis disease
according to GeneCards websites.

3.3.2 Pathway analysis

To further illustrate the benefit of the uHDSet test, we collect 880
pathways from KEGG, REACTOME and BIOCARTA pathway
analysis databases. We first extract genes belonging to each

pathway, then select the corresponding SNPs. The selected SNPs of
a specific pathway are combined to form the design matrix for asso—
ciation tests. We list six most significant pathways that pass p—value
cut-off 10_3 in Table 3 for which the prominent famSKAT methods
fails to detect. The two P3 8/MAPK pathways were previously found
to play a critical role by other publications (Kim et al., 2013; Lee
et al., 2008). Endogenous Sterols pathway is also related with BMD
reported by another study (Warriner and Saag, 2013). Chemokines
pathway is important regulator in development, homeostasis and
pathophysiological processes associated with osteoporosis
(Lazennec and Richmond, 2010).

Each p—value in Table 3 is generated based on a whole pathway—
based region. It can be seen that, our uHDSet method is more
powerful than famSKAT in identifying significant pathways which
contain a relatively large number of genetic markers.

4 Conclusion

Some promising association tests with the adjustment of family struc—
ture have been established on the LDSs (low dimensional sets).
However, these tests would suffer power loss in high dimensional
data. To overcome the limitations of these tests, we propose the
uFineMap and uHDSet tests for assessing the significance of the

Table 3. The selected functional pathways by uHDSet test only

HDSs with cryptic relatedness, which are based on novel scaled linear
mixed sparse regressions. The proposed tests are designed to address
the challenge of variants detection under complex pedigree structures,
which implement an explicit way to properly control the Type I error
rates at both single marker level and SNPs set level.

The promising results of testing on both simulated and real data
indicate that the uFineMap and uHDSet tests yield considerably
higher statistical power gains in comparison to other competing
methods, especially for high dimensional data with cryptic related—
ness. The uFineMap test can pinpoint single susceptible variants
with higher resolutions, even for rare functional variants. In add—
ition, our methods also maintain substantial power for detecting
susceptibility variants in low dimensional data of large samples.
Last but not least, our methods can identify both rare and common
variants efficiently.

One limitation of the proposed methods is that we assume linear
mixed relationship between phenotype and genotype, which might
not be true in the real world. Therefore, non—linear regression mod-
els with adjustment of relatedness and population stratification may
be more suitable. In addition, the overall computational complexity
is 0(n2m3), which is much higher than simply solving the sparse lin-
ear mixed model or other efficient methods designed for LDSs, par—
ticularly for extremely large data. To solve this issue, parallel
computing is implemented to reduce the total computational time
for large scale genetic data analyses.

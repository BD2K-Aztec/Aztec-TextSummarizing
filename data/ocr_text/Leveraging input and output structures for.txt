ABSTRACT

Motivation: As many complex disease and expression phenotypes
are the outcome of intricate perturbation of molecular networks
underlying gene regulation resulted from interdependent genome
variations, association mapping of causal QTLs or expression
quantitative trait loci must consider both additive and epistatic
effects of multiple candidate genotypes. This problem poses a
significant challenge to contemporary genome-wide-association
(GWA) mapping technologies because of its computational
complexity. Fortunately, a plethora of recent developments in
biological network community, especially the availability of genetic
interaction networks, make it possible to construct informative priors
of complex interactions between genotypes, which can substantially
reduce the complexity and increase the statistical power of GWA
inference.

Results: In this article, we consider the problem of learning
a multitask regression model while taking advantage of the
prior information on structures on both the inputs (genetic
variations) and outputs (expression levels). We propose a novel
regularization scheme over multitask regression called jointly
structured input—output lasso based on an 151/152 norm, which
allows shared sparsity patterns for related inputs and outputs to be
optimally estimated. Such patterns capture multiple related single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that jointly influence multiple-
related expression traits. In addition, we generalize this new multitask
regression to structurally regularized polynomial regression to detect
epistatic interactions with manageable complexity by exploiting
the prior knowledge on candidate SNPs for epistatic effects from
biological experiments. We demonstrate our method on simulated
and yeast eQTL datasets.

1 INTRODUCTION

One of the fundamental problems in computational biology is
to understand associations between genomic variations such as
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and phenotypic variations.
Complex phenotypes (e. g. disease syndromes or pathological
signatures) usually consist of a large number of quantitative traits
such as clinical and molecular (e.g. gene expression) signals.
Differences between these phenotypes involve the complex interplay
of a large number of SNPs that perturb the function of disease—
related genes in the context of a regulatory or interaction network,
rather than these SNPs acting individually (Brem et al., 2005).
Thus, unraveling the causal genetic variations and understanding the

mechanisms of consequent cell and tissue transformation requires
an analysis that jointly considers the epistatic and marginal effects of
genomic locations that affect the phenotypic variations. Speciﬁcally,
genomic locations that inﬂuence the expression levels of genes or
mRNAs are called expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs).

Previously, linear marginal effects of eQTLs have been studied
extensively in the past decade. To increase the power of detecting
causal genetic variants reliably, many different approaches have
been proposed that take advantage of the correlation structures in the
form of either physical or inferred molecular networks in the genome
and phenome, and other prior knowledge of such structures from
previous studies. For example, graph—guided fused lasso analyzed
multiple traits simultaneously by considering a network of multiple
traits to ﬁnd genetic markers with pleiotropic effects that affect
multiple—correlated traits jointly (Kim and Xing, 2009). Another
approach, Lirnet, was proposed to make use of prior knowledge on
regulatory features, such as conservation scores for a more informed
search of association SNPs (Lee et al., 2009).

Unlike linear effects of eQTLs, detecting non—linear SNP—SNP
interactions is still in its infancy due to a very large number of
possible interactions between SNPs [we refer readers to (Phillips,
2008) for the meanings of SNP—SNP interactions or epistasis]. For
example, a typical association analysis often involves up to millions
of SNPs; with J ~ 106 SNPs, the number of candidates of SNP
pairs for pairwise interactions becomes 12 which is clearly pushing
the limit of practical computing resources. More importantly, it also
carries a serious statistical issue that is the multiple testing problem
(Bendera and Langeb, 2001). If we test all SNP pairs to ﬁnd epistatic
effects, only a handful of SNP pairs may be left after correcting
for multiple hypothesis testing. To cope with the problem, previous
methods attempted to reduce the number of SNP pairs for hypothesis
testing in various ways. For example, Devlin et al. (2003) proposed
a two—step approach. It ﬁrst ﬁts a linear regression model with only
marginal effects and then considers only the SNPs with signiﬁcant
marginal effects for epistatic interactions. This approach reduces the
candidate interaction pairs but it signiﬁcantly limits the scope of the
analysis since genetic loci with epistatic effects may not show any
marginal effects. The two—step approach will completely miss such
interactions. Another proposed approach is sequential search (Storey
et al., 2005). It chooses a primary SNP by ﬁnding the SNP with the
largest marginal effect, and then the secondary SNP is selected in
such a way that residual sum of squares is minimized in a regression
setting with the two chosen SNPs. Even though it has been shown
that this approach is more powerful than exhaustive 2D search, it
still suffers from the cases where interacting SNPs do not have
signiﬁcant marginal effects. Furthermore, Emily et al. proposed a
different approach where the candidates of SNP pairs for epistatic
effects are chosen using biology networks (Emily et al., 2009). In
particular, under the guidance of protein—protein interaction network

they reported signiﬁcant interacting SNP pairs for susceptibility to
diseases such as hypertension and bipolar disorder.

Apparently, there is a growing need for a scalable but
mathematically principled approach to make effective use of
structures in both the genome and the transcriptome; to capture
higher order interactions between the genetic variations; and to
enable consistent, optimal, and computationally efﬁcient high—
dimensional inference for large—scale genome—wide—association
(GWA) mapping. In this article, we propose jointly structured
input—output lasso (SIOL) model for multitask regression that
systematically addresses these challenges.

Speciﬁcally, we propose ‘struct i/o multitask regression’, a novel
regression method with structured reguralizers which incorporates
genome and transcriptome structures into a linear regression model
and detects ﬁrst—order effects of SNPs in the genome. Here, genome
(input) structure refers to the phenomenon where multiple—related
SNPs are associated with a single trait; transcriptome (output)
structure corresponds to pleiotropic effect that is a single SNP
is associated with multiple related traits. Note that traits refer to
diverse biological outputs such as eye color, onset of diseases and
expression levels of genes. Taking into account the structures of
the datasets, we can signiﬁcantly improve GWA inference. First,
the genome structure enables us to capture correlated SNPs jointly.
When SNPs are linked with the genes with the same biological
functions via pathways or biological networks, they are likely to be
jointly associated with a trait. Thus, it would be desirable to choose
the correlated SNPs all together as eQTLs. Second, output structure
allows us to ﬁnd SNPs which are associated with multiple—related
traits jointly. The pleiotropy is well—known phenomenon where a
single mutation affects multiple related traits (Dudley et al., 2005).
Therefore, we induce this effect over multiple—related traits in our
model for better GWA inference.

Extending the model ‘struct i/o multi—task regression’, we propose
‘structured polynomial multitask regression’ to detect epistatic
effects as well as marginal effects of SNPs in the genome. In this
model, we adopt polynomial regression (Gavrilets and Scheiner,
1993) and include additional regressors for higher order terms.
However, in genome—wide association studies, considering all pairs
of SNPs is infeasible even for second—order polynomial regression
because given a typical human genome with ~105 SNPs, we need
to include ~1010 regressors which is both computationally and
statistically unmanageable. To ﬁnd a reasonable set of candidates
of SNP pairs, we exploit prior knowledge to guide the search for
plausible SNP pairs with epistatic effects. Speciﬁcally, we will use
a synthetic genetic interaction network (Costanzo et al., 2010) in
our eQTL analysis of yeast. The network was constructed using
large—scale synthetic genetic array (SGA) analysis (Tong et al.,
2004), where query mutations are crossed to the array of viable
gene deletion mutants to generate double mutants [see Boone et al.
(2007) for a review]. If two separate genes with mutations that are
viable in a single mutant cause a cell death or sickness, then we
call the situation a synthetic lethal or sick interaction and edges in
the network are created based on this information. As this network
contains information on pairs of genes whose mutations affect the
phenotype only when the mutations on both genes are present, this
represents a set of ground—truth epistatic interactions. Furthermore, it
is reasonable to expect that SNPs that lie in cis to the two genes with a
synthetic interaction are likely to interact epistatically as well. Thus,
in our approach, we use the synthetic genetic interaction network to

suggest those SNPs that lie in cis to the epistatically interacting genes
as candidate SNPs for epistatic effects on the trait in question. In
addition, one can use any other available resources to determine the
candidate SNP pairs. For example, it would be possible to include
pairs of SNPs having marginal effects to expand the search space
without blowing up the number of candidates. In our experiments,
we also included SNP pairs that were statistically signiﬁcant by
two—locus epistasis test (P—value <10T5).

Given our proposed models, we need to solve convex optimization
problems. To optimize our models, we developed a simple and
efﬁcient algorithm called hierarchical group—thresholding method.
As we shall see later, in our regularizer, we have non—separable
penalties due to the overlap between input and output groups.
Thus, traditional methods such as a coordinate descent method
cannot be directly applied to our problems. Our optimization
technique efﬁciently solved our problems by checking possible
sparsity patterns using optimality conditions and updating non—zero
regression coefﬁcients using a coordinate descent method.

Our experimental results conﬁrmed the efﬁcacy of our approach.
In our simulation study, our method signiﬁcantly outperformed
other competitors in terms of recall and precision rates in ﬁnding
true eQTLs with marginal and epistatic effects. Also, applying our
model with the genetic interaction network to yeast eQTL dataset
(Brem and Kruglyak, 2005), we detected SNPs having marginal and
epistatic effects in yeast genome. Interestingly, we found a novel
SNP pair (chr1:154328 and chr5:350744) with interaction effects
that affects >400 traits related to the same GO category of ribosome
biogenesis (corrected P—value for enrichment =1.2><10_36). It
turns out that these SNPs are very closely located to NUP60 and
RAD51 (within 500 bp), both of which interact with each other (P—
value for interaction 2 3 X 10—7) (Costanzo et al., 2010). Two—locus
epistasis test was not able to detect this epistatic effect with P—
value cutoff (<10T5). The SNP pair was also not reported in Storey
et al. (2005). The rest of this article is organized as follows. We
ﬁrst present background of linear regression model with structured
sparsity in Section 2. Then, in Section 3, we explain struct i/o
multitask regression demonstrating how input and output structures
can be incorporated into a regression model. Then, as an extension
of the previous model, we propose structured polynomial multitask
regression that considers both marginal and epistatic effects. Finally,
we conﬁrm the beneﬁts of the use of input/output structures using
simulated datasets, followed by the analysis of eQTLs with epistatic
and marginal effects in yeast.

2 BACKGROUND: LINEAR REGRESSION WITH
STRUCTURED SPARSITY
We begin with a brief review on regularized regression approaches

including lasso (Tibshirani, 1996), group lasso (Yuan and Lin, 2006)
and multitask lasso (Obozinski et al., 2006).

2.1 Notation for matrix operations
Given a matrix B ERKXJ, we denote the k—th row by ,Bk, the j—th

column by  , and the (k, j) element by  || - H F denotes the matrix
Frobenius norm, ||~||1 denotes an £1 norm (entry—wise matrix £1
norm for a matrix argument), and H - “2 represents an £2 norm. Given
the set of groups Q={g1, ...,g|g|} deﬁned as a subset of the power

set of {1,...,J}, ,8% represents the vector with elements {ﬂi : j 6g,

g6 Q}, or equivalently a subvector of ,Bk for group g. Similarly,
for the set of groups H={h1,...,h|7_u} over K rows of matrix B,

we denote by  the vector with elements {MC :keh,h€7—£}. We
also deﬁne the submatrix of Bi as a |h| >< |g| matrix with elements

{,B‘Iizkeh,jeg,he7-£,geg}.

2.2 Lasso, group lasso and multi-task lasso

Assuming that data are collected for N samples at J inputs and K
outputs, we let x’: denote the observation for the i—th sample and the
j —th input. In the problem of genetic association mapping, for haploid
organisms, xJ’: takes values from {0,1}, and for diploid organisms,

the value of x; is set to the number of minor alleles at the j—th

genetic locus. Let y}; denote the observation of k—th output for the
i—th individual. Then, we use a regression model that combines a
linear model for the marginal effects of individual inputs as follows:

Y=BX—l—E,

where B ERKXJ represents the regression coefﬁcient matrix and
E E RK XN is a matrix of noise terms whose elements are assumed
to be identically and independently distributed as Gaussian with zero
mean and constant variance. In this model, we have only marginal
effects. However, one can extend the model to include higher order
interactions as we shall see later in Section 4. Throughout this article,
we assume that X and Y are standardized. Then, we consider a model
without an intercept.

2.2. I Lasso and group lasso Lasso is a widely used technique for
obtaining a sparse estimate of the regression coefﬁcients. Especially,
it has been popular in genome—wide association studies as it is
known that it works well even when J >>N (Tibshirani, 1996).
The estimates of lasso can be obtained by optimizing the residual
sum of squares along with £1 norm as follows:

_ 1
IIIIHEIIY—BXllichrkllBlli, (1)

where k is the tuning parameter that determines the amount of
penalization. A larger value of 2 tends to encourage a greater number

of the ,Bk’s to be set exactly to zero. The optimal value of k can
be determined by cross validation on regression error, or via an
information—theoretic test based on BIC.

In the problem in equation (1), the input variables are
independently considered. We consider the grouping of SNPs and
apply the group—lasso penalty to B (Yuan and Lin, 2006):

K
- 1 2 g
mmillY—BXHF-I—AE E llﬁkll2, (2)
k=lgeg

I - 2
where “ﬁi “2 = X:ng  and g e Q represents a group of SNPs

(inputs). The penalty term in equation (2) encourages shrinkage of
groups of regression coefﬁcients ,8? Vgeg. Note that g can be
given by prior domain knowledge or computational algorithms. For
example, g can be a cluster of SNPs in genetic interaction networks
as these SNPs might inﬂuence on the same traits jointly. Also,
SNPs in the same pathways can be a reasonable group g (Wang
et al., 2007). If such domain knowledge is unavailable, we can use

computational methods [e. g. graphical lasso Friedman et al. (2008)
and clustering algorithms] to infer meaningful groups of SNPs.

2.2.2 Multitask regression with £1 Mg regularization A multitask
regression with £1 /£2—regularization was proposed to learn a joint
sparsity pattern across multiple tasks (Obozinski et al., 2006). The
51/52 penalty allows us to borrow information across multiple
regression tasks. The £1 /£2—regularized multitask regression is
deﬁned as follows:

J
- 1 2 j
mmEHY—BXHF'l—AE E llﬁhll2, (3)
J=lhEH

. . 2
where Ilﬁ‘illl2Z‘/Zkeh  and hEH is a group of traits

(outputs). The penalty term in equation (3) encourages the outputs in
group h to have a common set of relevant inputs. Notice that h can
also be learned from prior knowledge or computational techniques.
For example, one can group the genes sharing the same biological
functions to form h. It is reasonable as the genes with the same
functions are likely to be affected by common SNPs. If such domain
knowledge is unavailable, one can ﬁnd H using computational
methods. For example, one can estimate a trait network using a
graph inference algorithm, and then ﬁnd the clusters of traits in the
network using a clustering algorithm.

3 STRUCT I/O MULTITASK REGRESSION

We propose our method (SIOL) that incorporates structural
constraints on both the inputs and outputs. The model combines
the mixed—norm regularizers for the groups of inputs and outputs,
which leads to the following optimization problem:

_ 1
mmEIIY—BXII%+?»1IIBII1, (4a)
K
H22: “ﬂing (4b)
k=lgeg
J .
H3: XII/31,“; (4c)
j=1heH

The term in equation (4b) incorporates the groupings of the inputs
Q={g1, ...,g|g|}, where g0 represents the o—th group of correlated
inputs, and the term in equation (40) incorporates the groupings of
the outputs H = {h1, ...,h|H| }, where hm represents the m—th group
of correlated outputs.

Although our proposed model is simply convex combination of
£1 norm, 131/122 norm for input groups and 51/52 norm for output
groups, it is non—trivial to characterize the behavior of the model.
Here, we will demonstrate the grouping effects induced by our
model, and their beneﬁts in terms of rich structured sparsity in B.
Recall that we denote by Bi the block of coefﬁcients for input group
g and output group h. We start with Karush—Kuhn—Tucker (KKT)
condition for equation (4):

(y. —/3kX>(XJ)T =m’}. H24; +A3dj , (5)

where s56,  and  are the subgradient of £1 norm, 51/52 norm for
input groups, and 51/52 norm for output groups with respect to ,B‘li,
respectively. We also deﬁne  = yk — Zlaéj ,Bléxl.

First, we consider the case where all coefﬁcients in Bi become
zero simultaneously, that is Bi :0. Using KKT condition in
equation (5), we can see that Bg :0 if and only if

zzhﬁxjﬂ—ANQFE(Am/EHm/QY. (6)

kehjeg

This condition is due to Cauchy—Schwarz inequality, 21-98,ka 5 1,

and 2166110492 51. Here, if M, M and 23 are large, Bi is likely
to be zero jointly. This structural sparsity is useful to ﬁlter out
a large number of irrelevant covariates as it considers both the
group of correlated inputs g and the group of correlated outputs
h simultaneously.

Our model also inherits grouping effects for only input (or output)
groups. For the analysis of such grouping effects, we ﬁx the groups of
zero coefﬁcients that overlap with, say, an input group ,8 Formally

speaking, let us deﬁne £={i:(,8‘{1,=0,j€g,h’€7—£)V(,B§=0,j€
g’ Ag)}, and ﬁx ,B‘IICs for all jeé. Using the KKT condition in
equation (6), ,Bi :0 if

to handle overlapping group lasso penalty. One can see that if the
size of}; is large, ,8% tends to be zero together because it reduces the
left—hand side of equation (7). This behavior explains the correlation
effects between input and output group structures. When a group of

coefﬁcients (,8? ,B‘il) corresponding to an input group or an output
group become zero, they affect other groups of coefﬁcients that
overlap with them; and the overlapped coefﬁcients are more likely
to be zero. These correlation effects between overlapping groups are
desirable for inducing appropriate structured sparsity as it allows us
to share information across different inputs and different outputs
simultaneously. We skip the analysis of the grouping effects for
output groups as the argument is the same except that the input and
output group are reversed.

Finally, we also have individual sparsity due to £1 penalty.

Suppose that we have ,8% 75 0 and ,B‘il 750. Using the KKT condition,
3; = 0 if and only if

Iéwfkm. o)

It is equivalent to the condition of lasso that sets an individual
regression coefﬁcient to zero. Note that if A2 2 k3 = 0, we have only
individual sparsity, and our model is the same as lasso. When input
and output groups should contain both zero and non—zero entries,
we can handle the situations using equation (8).

When applied to GWA mapping of eQTLs, our model offers a
number of desirable properties. It is likely that our model can detect

association SNPs with low signal—to—noise ratio by taking advantage
of rich structural information. In GWA studies, one of the main
challenges is to detect SNPs having weak signals with limited sample
size. In complex diseases such as cancer and diabetes, biologists
believe that multiple SNPs are jointly responsible for diseases but
not necessarily with strong marginal effects (McCarthy et al., 2008).
Even though they do not have strong effects on phenotypic traits
individually, it is important to detect them because they might cause
signiﬁcant consequences collectively. However, such causal SNPs
are hard to detect mainly due to insufﬁcient number of samples. Our
model deals with this challenge by taking advantage of both input
and output group structures. First, by grouping inputs (or SNPs), we
can increase the signal—to—noise ratio. Suppose each SNP has small
signal marginally, if a group of coefﬁcients is relevant, their joint
strength will be increased, and it is unlikely that they are jointly
set to zero. Conversely, if a group of coefﬁcients is irrelevant, their
joint strength will still be small, and it is likely that they are set
to zero. Second, taking advantage of the output groups, we can
share information across the correlated outputs, and it decreases
the sample size required for successful support recovery (Negahban
and Wainwright, 2011). Overall, to detect causal SNPs having small
effects, our model increases signal—to—noise ratio by grouping the
SNPs, and simultaneously decreases the required number of samples
by grouping phenotypic traits.

4 STRUCTURED POLYNOMIAL MULTITASK
REGRESSION

In addition to marginal effects, we are also interested in detecting
interaction effects where multiple SNPs affect phenotypic traits
through their interactions. Let us explain interaction effects using
an example. Suppose that there are two variants A /a and B /b for
an organism. Uppercase and lowercase letters represent major and
minor genotypes in population, respectively. Assuming that there is
an interaction effect between the two variants, the following scenario
can be possible. If an individual has A(major) and B(major) at two
genomic locations, there are no effects on the sample. Similarly,
genotypes (A and b) or (a and B) cannot affect any traits of an
individual. However, if an individual has two minor genotypes a
and b, his/her traits can be changed accordingly. Therefore, to detect
pairwise interaction effects, we should consider all pairs of SNPs
instead of considering each SNP individually. However, it is often
infeasible to test all SNP pairs in eQTL mappings or association
studies. For example, for human genomes with ~105 SNPs, we
should take into account ~1010 candidates of SNP pairs. It is
clearly computational demanding and statistically challenging due
to multiple hypothesis testing problems. Here, we will show how
to generate good and relatively small number of candidates of SNP
pairs using genetic interaction networks (Costanzo et al., 2010).
Having individual and interaction terms in our model, our model
will be able to detect marginal and interaction effects in the genome
simultaneously.

Following common practice in GWA literature, here, we consider
only pairwise interactions between SNP pairs. Instead of including
all SNP pairs as regressors, we use a synthetic genetic interaction
network (Costanzo et al., 2010) to deﬁne a relatively small
candidate set U of interacting SNP pairs. A synthetic genetic
interaction network is derived from biological evidence of pairwise
functional interactions between genes, such as double knockout

Joint mapping of epistatic and marginal eQTLs

 

experiments (Boone et al., 2007; Costanzo et al., 2010; Koh et al.,
2009; Tong et al., 2004). It contains information about pairs of genes
whose mutations affect the phenotype only when the mutations are
present on both genes, and this represents a set of ground-truth
interaction effects. Given such a network, we consider only those
pairs of SNPs that are physically located in the genome near the
genes that interact in the network within a certain distance. A set
of SNP pairs U generated by this scheme is not only much smaller
than an exhaustive pair—set but also biologically more plausible. It
should also be noted that it is possible to include other sets of SNP
pairs from other resources in our candidate set. For example, in
our experiments, we also added SNP pairs that passed two—locus
epistasis test with P—value < 10—5 into the set U.

We generate the group of SNPs or interacting SNP pairs in two
steps. In the ﬁrst step, we ﬁnd highly interconnected subgraphs
(or clusters) from the genetic interaction network using any
graph clustering algorithms. In our experiments, we used MCODE
algorithm (B ader and Hogue, 2003) for clustering the network. The
clusters consist of genes, and the members in each cluster are likely
to interact with each other. In the second step, we group all the SNPs
or SNP pairs that are linked to the genes in a cluster. We linked the
genes and SNPs based on physical locations in the genome. For
example, if a SNP is located nearby a gene within a certain distance
(e. g. <500 bp), they are linked together. Finally, we deﬁne individual
SNPs in the mth group as gm 6 Q and SNP pairs in the m—th group
as 1m 6 £.

We then look for associations between inputs/input—pairs and
outputs via equation (9) which is equivalent to equation (4) except
that it includes additional interaction terms:

In equation (9), we explicitly show two different tuning parameters

for £1 penalty depending on whether a covariate is modeling an
individual effect (M) or interaction effect (24) because they might
need different level of sparsity. Note that this problem is the same
as equation (4) if we treat interaction terms xix}; as additional
covariates. However, as we have an additional tuning parameter 24,
it requires more computation to determine optimal tuning parameters
using crossvalidation procedure.

5 OPTIMIZATION

Unfortunately, the optimization problem resultant from equations
(4), (9) is non—trivial. One may ﬁnd out that each ,8“;C appears in

all three regularization terms. Thus, our structured regularizer is
non—separable, and simple coordinate descent optimization is not
applicable. To solve this challenging problem, we developed a
highly efﬁcient optimization technique called hierarchical group—
thresholding, and we expect that our method can be scaled to very
large datasets such as human eQTL datasets. In our experiments,
it took <3 s for our method to optimize equation (9) when M =
A4 20.05, 22 :23 =0.1,N 5 3500, J 5 600, and K = 10 on a desktop
with 2.83 GHz CPU and 4GB RAM. Here, we brieﬂy describe
our optimization algorithm. We start with non—zero regression
coefﬁcients of B initialized by other methods [e. g. ridge regression
Hoerl and Kennard (1970)]. We then iterate the following two
procedures until our model converges. First, we set the groups of (or
individual) coefﬁcients to zero according to optimality conditions.
Second, we update non—zero coefﬁcients using a coordinate descent
method. In this article, however, we are unable to elaborate the
optimization technique due to the lack of space.

6 EXPERIMENTS

In this section, we apply our method to both simulation datasets and
yeast eQTL datasets (Brem and Kruglyak, 2005) to demonstrate
the performance of our method. In our simulations, for comparison,
we selected methods including sparse group lasso (Friedman et al.,
2010), sparse multitask lasso, lasso (Tibshirani, 1996) and single
SNP analysis (PLINK) (Purcell et al., 2007). Note that sparse group
lasso is a linear regression model with £1 and 51/52 penalty for
the input groups, and sparse multitask lasso has regularizer that
combines £1 and 51/52 penalty for the output groups. For real data
analysis, using yeast genetic interaction network (Costanzo et al.,
2010), we show our analysis of eQTLs having marginal and epistatic
effects. In all our experiments, we use the following encoding for
SNPs. We set x} :0 if the j—th SNP from the i—th sample is a major

genotype and x1121 if it is a minor genotype.

6.1 Simulation study

As the ground—truth associations between SNPs and gene
expressions for yeast are unknown, to systematically evaluate
the performance of different methods, we perform a simulation
study using the yeast genotypes with output values simulated
from the known regression coefﬁcients. For generating X, we
ﬁrst selected 60 SNPs from the yeast genome sample (N: 100)
as the original input covariates. We then simulated 60 pairwise
interaction terms (x11: X295) by randomly selecting input—pairs from
the 60 SNPs mentioned above. Pooling the 60 marginal terms
and 60 pairwise interaction terms resulted in a input space of
120 dimensions. We simulated B matrix which reﬂects the true
associations. We used different association strengths of 0.2 and
0.4 when simulating true B. Speciﬁcally, we set the coefﬁcients
{ﬁf...,ﬂ,§0},{e§1...,e,§5},{e,§6...,e;0} and {32%,320} for all
k: 1, . .., 10 to the non—zero values of association strengths. Given
the extracted yeast genotype X and simulated B, we made output
variables (or traits) by Y =BX with Gaussian noise with zero mean
and unit variance. For the deﬁnition of input and output groups,
we grouped 5 consecutive input variables, and grouped 10 output
variables assuming that all the output variables belong to the same
group. For each parameter setting, we generated 20 datasets which
have different 100 samples randomly selected from 114 samples in

by changing the threshold of relevant covariates for our proposed method
(SIOL) and other methods including sparse group lasso (S—Group Lasso),

under different association strengths of (a) 0.2 and (b) 0.4

the yeast eQTL dataset and randomly chosen 60 SNP pairs. Based
on the datasets, we report the average performance using precision
recall curves.

In Figure 1(a and b), we show the performance of our method
(SIOL) and other methods including sparse group lasso (S—Group
Lasso), sparse multitask lasso (S—Multi—task Lasso), lasso and single
SNP analysis performed by PLINK (Purcell et al., 2007) for different
association strengths of 0.2 and 0.4. For the results of single SNP
analysis, we discarded SNPs with large P—values (>0.001) which
is equivalent to the P—value cutoff 0.1 with Bonferroni correction.
For all the methods, the tuning parameters were learned using cross
validation. From the simulation results, we observed the following
behaviors of various methods.

(1) SIOL signiﬁcantly outperformed all the other competitors
for all association strengths persistently. In particular, when
the problem is difﬁcult (e.g. association strength 0.2), the
performance gap between our method and others was more
substantial.

(2) The performances of lasso and single SNP were comparable
when association strength was small (e. g. 0.2). With high
recall rate, single SNP outperformed lasso but lasso performed
better than single SNP with high precision rate.

(3) All sparse learning techniques improved performance
signiﬁcantly as the association strength increased from 0.2
to 0.4. However, single SNP could not take advantage of the
high association strength effectively. This result supports that
multivariate analysis should be preferred over single variate
analysis such as single SNP when there are multiple causal
SNPs.

In our simulation study, we veriﬁed that our method truly takes
advantage of input and output structures effectively when there
exists meaningful prior information on both input and output sides.
Also, it should be noted that the performance of our method can be
in par with that of sparse group lasso or sparse multitask lasso even

when one of group structures is unreliable. Our method can adjust
tuning parameters to ignore any incorrect group structures.

6.2 Yeast eQTL dataset

We apply SIOL to budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) data
(Brem and Kruglyak, 2005) with 1260 unique SNPs (out of 2956
SNPs) and the observed gene—expression levels of 5637 genes.
As network prior knowledge, we used genetic interaction network
reported in (Costanzo et al., 2010) with stringent cutoff to construct
the set of candidates of SNP pairs U. We follow the procedure
in Section 4 to make U with an additional set of signiﬁcant SNP
pairs with P—value < 10—5 computed from two—locus epistasis test.
When determining the set U, we assumed that a SNP is linked to
a gene if the distance between them is <500 bp. We consider it a
reasonable choice for cis—effect as the size of intergene regions for
S. cerevisiae is 515 bp on average (Sunnerhagen and Piskur, 2006).
As a result, we included 982 interaction terms from the interaction
network in X with 1260 individual SNPs. The number SNP pairs
from two—locus epistasis test was different depending on the trait.
For generating input structures, we processed the network data as
follows. We started with genetic interaction data which include
74 984 interactions between gene pairs. We then extracted genetic
interactions with low P—values (<0.001). Given 44 056 signiﬁcant
interactions, using MCODE clustering algorithm, we found 55
gene clusters. Using the gene clusters, we generated the groups
of individual SNPs and pairs of SNPs according to the scheme in
Section 4. For generating output structures, we applied hierarchical
clustering to the yeast gene expression data with cutoff 0.8, resulting
in 2233 trait clusters.

6.2.] Marginal eﬂects in yeast eQTL dataset We brieﬂy analyze
eQTLs having marginal effects in the yeast dataset as the focus
of our analysis will be on epistatic interactions. In general, the
association results for marginal effects by our method, lasso and
single SNP analysis showed similar patterns for strong associations.
However, we observed differences for SNPs with small or medium
sized signals. For example, our results had fewer non—zero regression
coefﬁcients compared with lasso. One possible explanation would
be that the grouping effects induced by our model might have
removed false predictions with small or medium sized effects. To
illustrate eQTLs with marginal effects, we show some examples of
association SNPs using GenAMap (Curtis et al., 2012). Figure 2
demonstrates a Manhattan plot on Chromosome 7 for two genes
including YER160C and YJR029W. Both genes have the same GO
category ‘transposition’. As both genes share the same GO category,
it is likely that they are affected by the same SNPs if there exist
any association SNPs for both genes. In our results, we could see
that the same SNPs on Chromosome 7 are associated with both
genes as shown in Figure 2. However, single SNP analysis did not
ﬁnd any signiﬁcant association SNPs in the region. Lasso detected
association SNPs in the region but they were associated with only
YER160C rather than both of them (lasso plot is not shown to avoid
cluttered plots).

6.2.2 Epistatic eﬂects in yeast eQTL dataset As we analyze a
large number of genes (5637), it is interesting to ﬁnd SNP pairs that
affect a large number of traits, which are often called hotspots. Here,
we analyze the hotspots having epistatic interactions, and compare
our results with the results of two—locus epistasis test for all SNP pairs

and SNPs on Chromosome 7. The two genes YER160C and YJR029W
share the same GO category ‘transposition’. Our method detected SNPs
which affect both two genes in this region. However, single SNP analysis
did not ﬁnd any association SNPs and lasso found SNPs associated only
with YER160C in this region. This ﬁgure was generated using GenAMap
software (Curtis et al., 2012)

performed by PLINK (Purcell et al., 2007). Recall that two—locus
epistasis test is the widely used statistical technique for detecting
interaction effects between a SNP pair (r, s) based on the following
model: y}; ~ 190 +b1x£ +b2x§ +b3x£x§, Vi, k. It computes P—value for
the association of the SNP pair (r,s) by testing the signiﬁcance of
the interaction term 193. In the following analysis, we discarded all
SNP pairs if the correlation coefﬁcient between the pairs > 0.5 to
avoid trivial interaction effects.

We ﬁrst identiﬁed the most signiﬁcant hotspots that affect
>100 gene traits. To make sure that we include only signiﬁcant
interactions, we considered interaction terms if their absolute value

(affected genes are enriched with the GO category of ribosome biogenesis
with corrected P—value 1.6 x 10-36), and chr8:56246—chr9z362631 (affected
genes are enriched with the GO category of vacuolar protein catabolic process
with corrected P—value 1.6 x 10‘”)

of regression coefﬁcients are >0.05. For the results of two—locus
epistasis test, we considered all SNP pairs with P—value <10T5.
Figure 3(a and b) shows the hotspots found by our method and
two—locus epistasis test. The rings in the ﬁgure represent the yeast
genome from Chromosome 1 (located at the top of each circle) to
16 clockwise. The lines show epistatic interactions between the two
genomic locations at both ends. Interestingly, our method detected
11 hotspots, and two—locus epistasis test found only two hotspots
with epistatic interactions. In Table 1, we summarized the hotspots
with epistatic effects identiﬁed by our method. Notably, hotspot 1
(epistatic interaction between chr1: 154328 and chr5:350744) affects
455 genes which are enriched with the GO category of ribosome
biogenesis with the corrected P—value for enrichment <10—35
(multiple testing correction is performed by false discovery rate
(Maere et al., 2005)). This SNP pair was included in our candidates

Fig. 4. Hotspots of SNP pairs with epistatic effects which inﬂuence >10
gene traits found by (3) our method and (b) two—locus epistasis test by
PLINK (Purcell et al., 2007). This ﬁgure was generated using Circos software
(Krzywinski et al., 2009)

from the genetic interaction network. There is a signiﬁcant genetic
interaction between NUP60 and RAD51 with P—value 3 X10_7
(Costanzo et al., 2010), and both genes are located at chr1:152257—
153877 and chr5:349975—351178, respectively. As both SNPs
are closely located to NUP60 and RAD51, it is reasonable to
hypothesize that two SNPs at chr1:154328 and chr5 :350744 affected
the two genes, and their genetic interaction in turn acted on a
large number of genes related to ribosome biogenesis. We further
investigated the mechanism of this signiﬁcant SNP—SNP interaction.
In our literature survey, RAD51 (RADiation sensitive) is strand
exchange protein involved in DNA repair system (Sung, 1994), and
NUP60 (NUclear Pore) is the subunit of the nuclear pore complex
involved in nuclear export system (Denning et al., 2001). Also, it
has been reported that yeast cells are excessively sensitive to DNA
damaging agents if there exist mutations in NUP60 (Nagai et al.,
2008). In our results, we also found out that the SNP close to
NUP60 did not have signiﬁcant marginal effects, and the SNP in
RAD51 had marginal effects. According to these facts, it would be
possible to hypothesize as follows. When there are no mutations
in RAD51, the point mutation in NUP60 cannot affect other traits
as the single mutation is not strong enough and if there exist DNA
damaging agents in the environment, DNA repair system would be
able to handle them. However, when there exists the point mutation
in RAD51 involved in DNA repair system, DNA damaging agents
would severely harm yeast cells with the point mutation in NUP60
as DNA repair system might not work properly due to the mutation
in RAD51 (recall that the SNP in RAD51 had marginal effects). As
a result, both mutations in NUP60 and RAD51 could make a large
impact on many gene traits.

Furthermore, we looked at the hotspots which affect > 10 gene
traits. Figure 4a and 4b shows epistatic interactions identiﬁed by
our method and two—locus epistasis test, respectively. In this ﬁgure,
we show signiﬁcant interactions with regression coefﬁcient cutoff
>0.1 for our method, and P—value cutoff <10_6 for two—locus
epistasis test. These cutoffs are arbitrarily chosen to make the
number of hotspots found by both methods similar. Surprisingly, two
methods showed very different hotspots with epistatic interactions.
Figure 4a was very similar to Figure 3a but in Figure 4b several
hotspots emerged which were absent in Figure 3b. We will analyze
these hotspots in two ways. First, we will look at the hotspots
with epistatic effects which appeared in both Figure 4a and 4b.

test (P—value <10‘6) close to hotspot 1 (within <50 kb). Each dot represents
a SNP pair found by two—locus epistasis test, and it was perturbed by a small
amount of random noise to avoid overlapping dots

Then, we will investigate the differences between the two results.
First, we observed that both methods found signiﬁcant epistatic
effects between Chromosomes 1 and 5. Recall that in our previous
analysis of the hotspots, this interaction was discussed (see hotspot
1 in Table 1). Among all signiﬁcant SNP pairs found by two—locus
epistasis test, there was no SNP pair identical to hotspot 1 but there
were 30 SNP pairs close to it (within <50 kb). Also, it turns out that
these 30 SNP pairs had very strong correlation with hotspot 1.

In Figure 6, we show scatter plot to illustrate the strong
correlations between hotspot 1 and these 30 SNP pairs. More
interestingly, the total number of genes affected by these 30 SNP
pairs was 416, and it is very similar to 455, that is, the number
of genes affected by hotspot 1. According to these facts and
our previous analysis for the mechanism of hotspot 1, it seems
that hotspot 1 is truly signiﬁcant, and two—locus epistasis test
found signiﬁcant SNP pairs that are close to the true location but
failed to ﬁnd the exact location of hotspot 1. It supports that our
algorithm could ﬁnd such a signiﬁcant hotspot affecting >400
genes by detecting exact SNP pairs. Second, we investigated the
differences between the two results in Figure 4a and 4b. As we
cannot report all the results in this article, we focused on a SNP
pair (chr10:87113—chr15: 141621) in Figure 4a, and another SNP pair

Joint mapping of epistatic and marginal eQTLs

 

(chr8:633 14—chr9:36263 1) in Figure 4b. Figure 5a and 5b shows the
average gene expression levels for each SNP pair. In this ﬁgure,
x—axis represents the genotype 6 {0, 1} which is the multiplication
of two SNPs (SNP1 >< SNP2, where SNP1, SNP2 E {0, 1}), and
y—axis represents the average gene expression levels of individuals
with given genotype. Each line in Figure 5a and 5b shows how the
average gene expression level changes as the genotype changes from
0 to 1 for each trait affected by the SNP pairs with error bars of one
SD. Interestingly, in Figure 5a, we could see that there is a consistent
pattern, where for most gene traits, the expression levels decreased
as the genotype changed from 0 to 1. However, as shown in Figure
5b, for the SNP pair found by two—locus epistasis test, we could not
ﬁnd such a coherent pattern. It seems that we found consistent gene
expression patterns for the SNP pair as our model ﬁnds SNPs using
input and output group structures. Conversely, it is possible that two—
locus epistasis test found the SNP pair, which affected the expression
levels of multiple genes with different patterns as it analyzed each
SNP pair separately.

7 DISCUSSIONS

We proposed a novel sparse learning technique called jointly—SIOL.
We introduced a structured regularizer that includes £1 penalty,
£1 Mg penalty for input and output groups simultaneously. Using
the rich structured regularizer, we made it possible to use input
and output group structures in a single framework. Our experiments
showed that our method can effectively use structural information
and improve the accuracy for detecting association SNPs.

7.1 P-value computation

Note that our method gives biased regression coefﬁcients. Thus, it
would be desirable to compute P—values to estimate the signiﬁcance
of the non—zero coefﬁcients and control false discovery rate. For
high—dimensional regression problems, a few approaches have
been proposed to compute P—values (Meinshausen et al., 2009;
Wasserman and Roeder, 2009). We can use these techniques to
compute P—values for the covariates (SNPs or SNP pairs) selected
by our method. Here, we brieﬂy describe ‘screen and clean’
procedure proposed by (Wasserman and Roeder, 2009). It starts with
randomly dividing the data (X, Y) into two equal—sized groups, W1 =
(XI: LN/Z] ,YliLN/ZJ) and ‘112 : (xLN/2]+1:N,YLN/2]+I:N). First,
we apply our method with tuning parameters determined by
cross validation to the ﬁrst group of data, W1, and ﬁnd non—zero
coefﬁcients. We denote by Qk={i:,81€750,j=1,...,J}, k=1,...,K,
the set of covariates chosen by our method. Second, for all k, we
calculate P—values of the covariates in Qk based on the second
group of data, 412, using ordinary least—squares estimates. We then
adjust the P—values by multiplication with |Qk|. For the covariates
not in Qk, we assign P—value of 1. Recently, ‘multisplit’ method
(Meinshausen et al., 2009) was proposed for computing P—values
based on aggregate results of the above procedure. Using P—
values computed by ‘multisplit’ method, the authors showed that
family—wise error and false discovery rate can be controlled.

7.2 Comparison between SIOL and other models

A unique contribution of our model is to use both input
structures (groups of SNPs) and output structures (groups of
traits) simultaneously in a highly general setting. Note that we

can deal with overlapping groups, and hence, a SNP or a trait
can be involved in multiple groups. Unlike our model, most
previous models considered only input or only output structure. For
example, composite absolute penalties are introduced to incorporate
grouping and hierarchical structures on input sides (Zhao et al.,
2009). Adaptive multitask lasso is proposed to consider the groups
of traits with many regulatory features in the genome (Lee
et al., 2010). Graph—guided fused lasso (GFlasso) (Kim and Xing,
2009) and tree—guided group lasso (Kim and Xing, 2010) are
developed to incorporate graph and tree structures on output sides,
respectively. Recently, Curtis et al. (2012) proposed graph—graph—
guided fused lasso (gGFlasso) which attempted to use input structure
on transcriptome and output structure on phenome. However, it is
different from our model as it is based on graph structures rather
than group structures.

7.3 Application of our method to Other eQTL data

To apply our method to human eQTL datasets or eQTL datasets
for other species, it is important to ﬁnd reliable groups of SNPs or
groups of traits. In yeast eQTL studies, we have experimentally
validated genetic interaction networks. However, such reliable
genetic interaction networks may not be available for other
domains. Instead, we have abundant biological knowledge such as
regulatory features, LD (linkage disequilibrium) structures, pathway
databases and protein—protein interaction networks. One needs to
ﬁnd meaningful groups of SNPs or groups of traits using such
biological information.

7.4 Effects of unreliable grouping information

Given unreliable grouping information, it is likely that our method
ﬁnds only a few SNPs that are strongly associated with traits. Note
that our method shrink the regression coefﬁcient matrix B based
on the predeﬁned groups of SNPs and traits. Ideally, coefﬁcients
should be grouped together if they can be jointly shrunk rather than
jointly selected. Suppose there is a group of SNPs which contains
a few relevant SNPs and many irrelevant SNPs. In that case, it is
likely that the coefﬁcients corresponding to the group are jointly
shrunk to zero, and we might fail to capture the relevant SNPs
within the group. Conversely, if a group has no relevant SNPs, our
method can still shrink the group of coefﬁcients effectively. Overall,
when using unreliable grouping information, our model might select
SNPs having strong association but miss many SNPs having weak
association.

7.5 Future work

We still have many challenging issues for association mapping
problems. For example, it is non—trivial to ﬁnd biologically
meaningful and reliable input and output group structures. One of
possible approaches would be to combine GWA mapping with the
inference of grouping information to improve the performance of
both tasks synergistically. Also, we want to apply our method to
human disease data as well. Detection of SNPs with true epistatic
and marginal effects will shed light on the better understanding of
genetic factors of complex diseases.

ABSTRACT

Summary: lnterMine is an open-source data warehouse system that
facilitates the building of databases with complex data integration re-
quirements and a need for a fast customizable query facility. Using
lnterMine, large biological databases can be created from a range of
heterogeneous data sources, and the extensible data model allows for
easy integration of new data types. The analysis tools include a flexible
query builder, genomic region search and a library of ‘widgets’ per-
forming various statistical analyses. The results can be exported in
many commonly used formats. lnterMine is a fully extensible frame-
work where developers can add new tools and functionality.
Additionally, there is a comprehensive set of web services, for which
client libraries are provided in five commonly used programming
languages.

1 INTRODUCTION

Integrative analysis exploiting diverse datasets is a powerful ap-
proach in modern biology, but it can also be complex and time
consuming. There are huge quantities of data available in a range
of different formats, and a high level of computational expertise
is often required for performing analysis, even once the data have
been successfully integrated into a single database [for a general
review of biological data integration, see Triplet and Butler
(2011)]. InterMine is a data warehouse framework initially de-
veloped for FlyMine to address these issues for the Drosophila
community (Lyne et al., 2007). It is being adopted by a number
of major model organism databases including budding yeast, rat,
zebrafish, mouse and nematode worm (Balakrishnan et al., 2012;
Shimoyama et al., 2011), and is in use by the modENCODE
project—a large-scale international initiative to characterize
functional elements in the fly and worm genomes (Celniker

at al., 2009; Contrino et al., 2012), as well as for drug target
discovery (Chen et al., 2011), Drosophila transcription factors
(Pfreundt et al., 2010) and mitochondrial proteomics (Smith
et al., 2012). Many features of the InterMine system have been
designed to lower the effort required for the setup and main-
tenance of large-scale biological databases, and these are outlined
later in the text and discussed in more detail in the
Supplementary Material.

1.1 Data loading and integration

The InterMine database build system allows for the integration of
datasets of varying size and complexity. It comes equipped with
data integration modules that load data from common biological
formats (e.g. GFF3, FASTA, OBO, BioPAX, GAF, PSI and
chado—see Supplementary Material for a full list), while
custom sources can be added by writing data parsers using the
Java application programming interface (API) or by creating
XML files in the appropriate format, for which a Perl API
exists. InterMine’s core biological model is based on
the Sequence Ontology (Eilbeck et al., 2005) and can be easily
extended by editing an XML file. All model-based components of
the system are automatically derived from the data model, allow-
ing simple error-free upgrading of the user interface and API as
new data types are added.

One of the challenges of integrating data from different
sources is that valuable datasets can become outdated when
the gene models, and therefore identifiers, are updated.
InterMine addresses this with an identifier resolver system that
automatically replaces outdated identifiers with current ones
when loading the dataset into the InterMine database. This is
achieved using a map of current identiﬁers and synonyms from
relevant databases—the identifiers matching a single synonym
are changed to the current version, while the ones matching
none or multiple synonyms are discarded. Integrating datasets
can also be problematic if data values from different data sources
conﬂict. To address this, database developers are able to set a
priority for each data type, giving precedence to the more reliable
data source at any level of data model granularity. To track data
provenance, the database records each time a database row is
created or modified.

1.2 Performance-tuned architecture

At the core of InterMine is the ObjectStore, a custom object/
relational mapping system written in Java and optimized for
read-only database performance. The ObjectStore accepts
object queries from a client (the web application or web services),
generates SQL to execute in the underlying PostgreSQL database
and materializes objects from the results (Fig. l).

The Query optimizer improves performance using PostgreSQL
tools and using pre—computed tables of results, which are created
after all datasets have been loaded, joining connected data from
different tables in the database. In this way, InterMine does not
require, as other biological data warehouses do, a pre—defined
database schema to perform. The analysis of estimated query
execution times enables performance tuning, and query results
are cached using a smart caching system, which can use previ-
ously run queries or parts of them to improve retrieval speed.
This allows fast data mining of even large databases: modMine,
the InterMine for the modENCODE project (Contrino et al.,
2012), currently contains >325 GB of data.

1.3 Data access

Users can access data both through RESTful web services and
through the web application. The web application includes a
faceted keyword search and powerful query tools. Users can
input their own lists of identifiers (e.g. from genes), and lists
and queries can be saved in a user’s private ‘MyMine’ account.
Data identifiers are automatically updated to the most current
ones for user input data, taking out a time-consuming step ne-
cessary for analysis across datasets. Type-specific report pages
can be set up to provide collated summary information and rele-
vant embedded interactive graphical displays (such as an inter-
action viewer, genome browser and expression heat maps), both
for specific items such as individual genes and for lists of data
items. The report pages provide summaries of results from a wide
range of data types, facilitating serendipitous discovery.
InterMine provides a set of analysis ‘widgets’. These include
tables (e.g. displaying orthologues and interactions), visual
charts (e.g. displaying chromosome distribution graphs, gene
expression results and interaction networks) and enrichment ana-
lysis widgets—see Supplementary Material for details (covering
functional terms, protein domains and publications). Through a
well-defined framework, developers can also create further

widgets to customize the web application to their needs. Query
‘templates’ can easily be created for commonly run queries, and
the QueryBuilder allows construction of advanced custom
queries. InterMine also includes functionality for querying fea-
tures with overlapping genome coordinates.

Query results can be saved and exported from the InterMine
web application, e.g. as tab-delimited, comma-delimited, GFF3,
FASTA or BED files, and can also be exported to Galaxy
(Goecks et al., 2010), where other data analysis workﬂows can
be established and performed, such as analysing high-throughput
sequencing data.

Web service APIs can be used to access the core functionality
of InterMine such as uploading lists of data identifiers and run-
ning queries. They can also be used to access the metadata and
specialized resources, such as retrieving enrichment statistics,
running the region search or exploring the data model.
Custom-written client libraries exist in a number of program-
ming languages, including Python, Perl, Ruby, Java and
JavaScript, enabling users to automate data-based workﬂows
or access data directly without using the InterMine web applica-
tion. The InterMine web application automatically generates
code from queries for each of these client languages. In addition,
query results are available in many formats including J SON or
can be embedded directly in HTML, making it possible to view
data from an InterMine database within another website (e.g.
www.modencode.org). A recent use example of these facilities
is the development of the YeastMine iPhone application
(M. Cherry, personal communication).

2 CONCLUSIONS

Through its speed and ﬂexibility, InterMine provides an
advanced system for setting up biological data warehouses that
facilitate bioinformatics analysis. As new data types emerge, the
data model can be easily adapted to accommodate them. There is
already a range of user-friendly tools, and the extensible frame-
work means that specific analysis tools can be developed to cater
to the changing needs of the users, making it particularly
well-suited to the needs of biomedical researchers. Many of the
major model organism databases are adopting InterMine as their
data warehouse of choice, putting it in a good position to work
on cross-organism interoperability as part of future development.
There is an active InterMine developer community, and funding
is in place until 2018, promising long-term sustainability of
InterMine as a resource and continued improvements to meet
researchers’ needs.

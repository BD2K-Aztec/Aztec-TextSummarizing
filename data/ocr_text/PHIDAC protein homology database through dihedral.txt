ABSTRACT

Finding related conformations in the Protein Data Bank is essential in
many areas of bioscience. To assist this task, we designed a dihedral
angle database for searching protein segment homologs. The search
engine relies on encoding of the protein coordinates into text charac-
ters representing amino acid sequence, (p and w dihedral angles. The
search engine is advantageous owing to its high speed and interactive
nature and is expected to assist scientists in discovering conformation
homologs and evolutionary kinship. The search engine is fast, with
query times lasting a few seconds, and freely available at http://
tarshish.md.biu.ac.il/~samsona

1 INTRODUCTION

Over the past years, structural data in the Protein Data Bank
(PDB) has grown exponentially. At the present time, ~92 000
structures are available in the PDB (Berman et al., 2002). The
data abundance makes it difﬁcult to navigate the information,
particularly when one tries to retrieve segment motifs (Levitt,
1992). To ﬁnd segment motifs in the PDB structures, several
computational engines have been designed. One such engine is
SPASM, which ﬁnds spatial motifs consisting of arbitrary
main-chain and side-chain conformation in a database of protein
structures (Kleywegt, 1999). An additional search engine named
Fragment Finder was designed to identify similar structural
motifs based on backbone dihedral angles (Ananthalakshmi
et al., 2005). Another engine, PAST, is based on translation-
and rotation-invariant representation of protein backbone oz-di-
hedral angles (Taubig et al., 2006). Both PAST and Fragment
Finder suffer from dihedral angle discretization of 50, which
coarse grains the results, and preclude amino acid sequence,
which prevents a comprehensive search. Also noteworthy is the
Dali Server, which enables the user to browse for homologs in
Cartesian space (Holm et al., 2008). None of these engines allows
a combined search using amino acid sequence and dihedral
angles in a rapid manner.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Here we describe an online search engine that rapidly ﬁnds
protein segments based on amino acid sequence and g0 and 1p
dihedral angles. The search engine, named Protein Homology
through Dihedral Angle Constraints (PHI-DAC), is advanta-
geous owing to its speed, generality and simplicity. It is expected
to be helpful to the scientiﬁc community by easing the identiﬁ-
cation of conformation homologs and distilling useful informa-
tion from the PDB.

2 METHODS

Protein structure representation. To describe the 3D conformation of a
protein we use (p and w dihedral angles. These angles have the advantage
of being invariant to translation and rotation of the protein structure in a
coordinate system. The angles are calculated using DSSP (Kabsch and
Sander, 1983) and encoded into a structural alphabet (Levitt, 1992)
represented by text characters from 0 to 359°. This transforms the
information of the 3D backbone conformation from all protein
structures contained in the PDB into sequences of text that are easily
searchable.

Construction of the PHI-DAC database. All PDB ﬁles containing pro-
tein structure are handled as separate entries and included in PHI-DAC.
As of January 2014, a total of ~96 000 ﬁles describe protein structures.
Computation of the PHI-DAC database, given the (p and w dihedral
angles and amino acid sequences, takes ~l min on a standard PC
(2.7GHz). The size of the database is 174 MB, and it can be held in
working memory, making all calculations extremely fast. The search
engine is hosted on a 2.7GHz PC with 2GB random access memory
operating under Linux. Update of the PHI-DAC database is expected
monthly.

3 RESULTS

PHI-DAC database. In Table 1, an example entry of the PHI-
DAC database is shown. The entry is composed of four pipe
delimited ﬁelds. The ﬁrst and second ﬁelds contain the PDB
identiﬁcation (ID) and the amino acid sequence, respectively.
Chain IDs are referenced to the DSSP ﬁles, and cysteines are
in lowercase letters. Duplicate lowercase letters form disulﬁde
bridges, ‘a’ with ‘a’, ‘b’ with ‘b’, etc. Exclamation points
denote a chain break or a new polypeptide chain. The third
and fourth ﬁelds contain the g0 and 1p dihedral angles encoded
in double characters. The ﬁrst character represents units of 10
(A: 0, B =10...S = 180, and a=—0, b =—10...) and the
second character represents units of 1. Thus, ‘A0’ is 00, ‘Al’ is
+10, ‘A2’ is +20, ‘S0’ is +180o (or —1800), ‘al’ is —l0 (or 3590),

Fig. 1. The PHI-DAC search engine. The search engine ﬁnds protein
segment homologs based on (p and w dihedral angles and amino acid
sequence. (A) Search parameters include PDB coordinates, PDB and
chain ID, as well as residue range. (B) The result page of PHI-DAC
lists the segments that matched the query. Shown here is an example
query for segment 7—10 of chain A of PDB ID 1L4W with a torsion
angle tolerance of 8°. The results are listed in order of the RMSD of
dihedral angles between the query and result. Notice sequence identity
indicated by pipes

and so on. This protein backbone representation is concise and
accurate. The database is available for download.

Querying PHI-DAC. To perform a search for similar protein
backbone conformations in the PDB, the web interface offers the
following search parameters: PDB ID, chain, ﬁrst and last
residue and tolerance. The tolerance is a range of neighboring
dihedral angle intervals in 1° increments. The dihedral angle dis-
cretization of 1° is superior to Fragment Finder and PAST and
allows for more accurate results. The tolerance is limited to
:l:30°, so as to provide meaningful spatial superposition.
A screenshot of the query interface is shown in Figure 1.
Supplementary Table S1 summarizes the run times and the

work range of the server in terms of peptide length, complexity
of fold and dihedral angle deviation. Note that the bottleneck of
the server is the dihedral angle deviation.

Interpreting the results. Following a query submission, the
result table should be loaded automatically within few seconds.
A screenshot of the result table of the example query is
shown in Figure l. The result page contains the PDB ID,
chain, position and the amino acid sequence. The PDB IDs are
hyperlinked to the respective PDB ﬁle. The results are classiﬁed
according to the dihedral angle root-mean-square deviation
(RMSD) between the query segment and the result segment
(low to high).

Example queries. Two example queries are readily accessible
on the Web site. In the ﬁrst example query the coordinates of a
small bent helix in PDB ID 9XIM (residues 121—127) are
used. Searching with the (p and 1p dihedral angles by using a
tolerance of :l:3° and without conserving the amino acid
sequence leads to 14 matching segments belonging to 14 different
PDB entries. In the second example query, the coordinates of the
,B-hairpin segment 7—10 of chain A of PDB ID 1L4W is
used. Querying with the (p and 1p dihedral angles by using a
tolerance of :l:8° and without conserving the amino acid
sequence leads to 13 matching segments belonging to 13 different
PDB entries.

Local versus global homology. PHI-DAC is based on local
dihedral angle homology and is not designed to detect global
spatial similarities. As such, PHI-DAC does not detect similarity
between large SCOP or CATH folds with perfect superimpos-
ition in the core and major differences in the loops. For spatial
superimposition, SCOP, CATH and Dali should be used.

4 CONCLUSION

Our method of encoding the backbone (p and 1p dihedral angles
into text characters has proven to be a fast solution for answering
queries about local structural similarities in the PDB. Compared
with SPASM, PHI-DAC shows similar results, while being much
faster and addressing a different question compared with Dali.
Therefore, compared with Dali, we consider PHI-DAC to be a
valuable tool for the fast detection of protein segments based on
dihedral angle conservation.

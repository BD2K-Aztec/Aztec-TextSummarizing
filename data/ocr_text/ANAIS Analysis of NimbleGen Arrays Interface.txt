ABSTRACT

Summary: ANAIS is a user-friendly web-based tool for the
processing of NimbleGen expression data. The interface reads
single-channel microarray files generated by NimbleGen platforms
and produces easily interpretable graphical and numerical results.
It provides biologists six turnkey analysis modules—normalization,
probe to gene, quality controls, differential expression, detection,
queries and clustering—to explore quickly, freely and without the
need for computer programming, NimbleGen transcriptome data.

1 INTRODUCTION

Microarray technologies have become widely used in genome—
wide gene expression studies. The NimbleGen platform (http://www
.nimblegen.com/), that offers customized high—density arrays with
multiple long—oligos per gene, is particularly gaining popularity
among biologists. Nevertheless, few complete, ready—mixed and
free analysis tools are available (Carazzolle et al., 2009; Wang
et al., 2006). Here, we report an intuitive web interface that
allows scientists to conduct themselves all the analysis steps needed
to interpret a NimbleGen expression experiment. In addition to
the conventional processes, such as normalization and differential
expression, the tool also offers interesting modules performing
quality controls, detection and queries. Moreover, the toolset was
developed with a sake of rapidity compatible with a remote use via
Internet, and accepts all one—colour NimbleGen expression array
designs.

2 FEATURES

ANAIS is composed of eight modules. The initial module is for data
loading. Subsequently, the workﬂow includes six steps of analyses.
The ﬁnal module is dedicated to downloads and project management

(Fig. 1).

2.1 Data input and project deﬁnition

Users are ﬁrst prompted to create, select or restore a project. The
setting—up of a new project is initiated by loading a zip archive
containing pair and calls standard NimbleGen ﬁles, which are quite
light and therefore adequate for Internet ﬂows. The project deﬁnition
is then completed by the user’s experimental design.

Parameters for the vertical line are conﬁgured by the user, in order to deﬁne a
threshold of expression. (D) Hierarchical clustering and heat map for queried
genes. (E) Intensity proﬁle curves for queried genes.

2.2 Normalization and probe to gene

Normalization is essential to analyse experiments involving multiple
arrays, whereas probe to gene methods summarize gene expression
from probe sets. ANAIS is able to manage NimbleGen pre—proces sed
ﬁles, and offers also its own processes, including the widely used
quantile normalization (Bolstad et al., 2003).

2.3 Quality controls

ANAIS especially focuses on quality controls and offers many
graphical representations to check data before further analyses.
The graphs display signal intensities, either for all arrays: box
plots (Fig. 1A), histograms, scatter plots of intra—array duplicates;
or for two chosen arrays: scatter plots, ratio histograms, MA
plots. Moreover, the reproducibility between replicates can be well
estimated by ANAIS hierarchical clustering of arrays (Fig. 1B).

2.4 Detection

Hybridization signals provide information as absolute measurements
of gene expression, which may, for instance, give evidence for
in silico predicted genes. To identify the set of genes whose intensity
is above a signal—to—noise threshold, ANAIS calculates widely used
cut—offs from random probes (Bilban et al., 2002). The novelty of
ANAIS interface is to allow users to determine visually the threshold
of expression on histograms where random probes and adjustable
cut—off levels are represented (Fig. 1C). ANAIS also calculates a
detection P—value, which represents the conﬁdence that a gene is
expressed above random probes. The statistical test is adapted from
Illumina detection call algorithm (Archer and Reese, 2010; http://
www.illumina.com).

2.5 Differential analysis

The main goal of a transcriptome experiment is to identify the set
of genes differentially expressed between conditions. Based on the
experimental design provided by the user, ANAIS calculates the
fold changes, and performs an analysis of variance (ANOVA) for
each gene (Churchill, 2004). To deal with multiple testings, ANOVA
P—values are further adjusted by family—wise error rate (FWER) or
false discovery rate (FDR) methods (Strimmer, 2008). The obtained
P—values are used as indicators of the strength of the evidence for
differential expression.

2.6 Queries and clustering

To retrieve analysis results, ANAIS offers queries based on gene
names or on differential expression issue. The selected gene values
can then be downloaded, textually or graphically displayed by
clustering and heat map (Fig. 1D), proﬁle curves (Fig. 1E) or volcano
plots. ANAIS also provides ready—to—use text ﬁles to access more
clustering functionalities with specialized softwares like Genesis
(Sturn et al., 2002).

2.7 Outputs and project management

All graphical and numerical results generated during the analyses
steps of the current project can be downloaded as zip ﬁles. Project

can be stored on the server for subsequent analyses, cleared or
downloaded for further restoration.

3 IMPLEMENTATION

ANAIS is a web—based tool written in Python and R. Dynamic
interfaces are generated with python cheetah template engine (http://
www.cheetahtemplate.org/) and CGIwithR package (http://cran
.r—project.org/web/packages/CGIwitth). Python/R interfacing is
provided by RPy package (http://rpy.sourceforge.net/). Modules use
methods from the Bioconductor project (http://www.bioconductor
.org/; Gentleman et al., 2004).

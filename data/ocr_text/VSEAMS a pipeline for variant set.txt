ABSTRACT

Motivation: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified
many loci implicated in disease susceptibility. Integration of GWAS
summary statistics (P-values) and functional genomic datasets
should help to elucidate mechanisms.

Results: We extended a non-parametric SNP set enrichment method
to test for enrichment of GWAS signals in functionally defined loci to a
situation where only GWAS P-values are available. The approach is
implemented in VSEAMS, a freely available software pipeline. We use
VSEAMS to identify enrichment of type 1 diabetes (T 1 D) GWAS asso-
ciations near genes that are targets for the transcription factors IKZF3,
BATF and ESRRA. IKZF3 lies in a known T1D susceptibility region,
while BATF and ESRRA overlap other immune disease susceptibility
regions, validating our approach and suggesting novel avenues of re-
search for T1 D.

1 INTRODUCTION

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful
in identifying loci associated with many phenotypes WVelter
et al., 2014), and summary statistics in the form of a list of
single, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) P-Values for each
marker tested are increasingly becoming available in the public
domain (Burren et al., 2011; Okada et al., 2014). In tandem with
this, large amounts of functional genomic data across a wide
variety of tissues and conditions are increasingly available
through public repositories. Integrative methods that combine
genome-wide genetic and genomic data have the potential to
highlight functional genomic categories suitable for further
study in relation to a given phenotype. This is particularly im-
portant in type 1 diabetes (T1D) where of the 49 susceptibility
loci currently described (http://immunobase.org, accessed March

15, 2014), only 12 are consistent with a non-synonymous coding
SNP as the causal variant. This is in accord with previous re-
search (lari et al., 2012; Schaub et al., 2012), and indicates a
central role for gene regulatory SNPs in the modulation of com-
plex disease, where integrative methods have utility.

One such integrative approach is to modify gene set enrich-
ment analyses methods (GSEA) developed for microarray path-
way analysis (Subramanian et al., 2005) for use with GWAS
study datasets WVang et al., 2007). These approaches partner
SNPs to genes based on public annotations and then test for
differences in evidence of association between SNPs assigned to
two sets of genes. There are several limitations with existing
approaches. First, most methods require access to raw genotype
data to correct for inter-SNP correlation due to linkage disequi-
librium (LD). Raw genotype data are typically not available in
the public domain, and this problem is compounded for meta-
analysis—based GWAS, which combines multiple datasets.
Second, the permutation-based approaches usually used to
adjust for correlation are computationally expensive. Finally,
classical gene set enrichment analysis is typically based on tests
derived from the Kolmogorov—Smirnov, which is under pow-
ered. A need for simpler and more powerful methods has been
identiﬁed (Irizarry et al., 2009), but the proposed alternative, a t-
test, has been criticized because it cannot cope with strong cor-
relation between genes (Tamayo et al., 2012).

We have previously used a Wilcoxon-based GSEA method to
demonstrate enrichment for T1D association to a gene network
driven by the transcription factor [RF 7 (Heinig et al., 2010). The
Wilcoxon test was used as a more powerful alternative to a
Kolmogorov—Smirnov test, but the approach still required per-
mutation to correct for the effects of LD. In this article, we de-
scribe an approximate method, that allows such tests to be
performed with greater computational efﬁciency and, crucially,
without access to raw genotype data, by extending an approach
by Liu et al. (2010). We implement this extended approach in a
freely available software pipeline VSEAMS. Although we have
chosen the Wilcoxon test, the pipeline would be easily adaptable
to any test of location such as a t-test.

Given previous evidence for the involvement of a network of
genes linked to the transcription factor [RF 7 (Heinig et al., 2010)
in (T1D), we hypothesized that networks of genes dependent on

other transcription factors might also show enrichment for T1D
association. We used VSEAMS to test for enrichment of T1D
association among the targets of 59 transcription factors identi-
ﬁed through knock-down experiments in lymphoblastoid cell
lines (Cusanovich et al., 2014).

2 METHODS

2.1 Outline of existing Wilcoxon-based approach

Given two sets of genes (test and control), our task is to decide whether
GWAS-association signals for a given trait differ between SNPs near test
and control genes—a comparison of two distributions of P-values. We
use a non-parametric test, the Wilcoxon rank sum test, to test a null
hypothesis that these two distributions have equal medians, but any
test of location could be used. The test statistic is denoted W. Its mean
is known theoretically, but its variance is inﬂated when SNPs are in any
degree of LD. To address this, Heinig et al. (2010) repeatedly permuted
case/control status in a GWAS dataset to generate replicates of W under
the null. A Z—score can be derived

2 (W — #0)

—W ,
where W is the observed test statistic, ,uo is its theoretical mean, and V is
its empirical variance derived from the replicates of W. V is problematic
to compute because the univariate tests of association between SNPs are
slow to compute and require access to raw the genotype data, which are
not always available.

2 (1)

2.2 Approximation of V by V*

VSEAMS removes the need to access the raw data by instead approx-
imating V by V*. Given a matrix of pairwise genotype correlations at
SNPs of interest, 2, which may be derived from public data, we repeat-
edly sample Z* ~N(0, 2), from which P-values can be derived in the usual
manner. The link between correlation of genotypes and correlation of
Z—scores is not entirely obvious and is derived in the supplementary in-
formation. These P-values can be combined in the same way as the
observed data to give replicates of W, with V* equal to the empirical
variance of these replicates. The full VSEAMS pipeline is described in
Figure 1 and Supplementary Information.

2.3 Validation analyses

To validate the method, we used T1D GWAS data from the TlDGC
study (see Supplementary Information) for which we have raw genotype
data, ~ 4000 cases and 4000 controls drawn from the UK population to
compute and compare V and V* under different scenarios. SNP testing
was conducted using the R package snpStats. To examine how VSEAMS
performance is affected by gene set, we selected a random set of 200
protein coding genes (Supplementary Table S3) and generated 100 sets
of 100 control and 100 test gene sets by randomly sampling from these
200 genes. For each set, we computed an enrichment Z—score using
(i) VSEAMS and summary P-values and (ii) permuted case/control
status and raw genotype data. To simulate modest enrichment, we re-
peated these analyses with the P-value for each SNP in the test set multi-
plied by 0.9.

To examine the effect of sample size and number of simulations, we
created case/control genotype sets by randomly sampling a subset of cases
and controls from the TlDGC dataset. For each sample size, we repeated
this ﬁve times, and compared the Z statistics produced by VSEAMS (up
to 10000 simulations) or permutation methods (10000 permutations).

Fig. 1. The VSEAMS pipeline; mandatory inputs are shaded grey; a
dashed border indicates that one or the other input is required.
VSEAMS takes as input either two lists of genes or two lists of regions
for comparison. Given genes, regions are deﬁned by taking gene coord-
inates :I: 200 kb around the TSS. GWAS summary statistics (P-values) for
SNPs in those regions are extracted. The observed Wilcoxon rank sum
test statistic is compared with its null distribution determined by its the-
oretical mean and a variance derived by simulating null P-values with a
correlation structure matching the underlying genotype structure.
Caching of pregenerated LD matrices reduces computation time. A full
description of each step is available in the Supplementary Information

2.4 Benchmark analyses

The VSEAMS pipeline is designed to run on a shared distributed com-
puting platform, complicating runtime comparisons. We therefore de-
signed a set of benchmarking tests to compare runtime for generating
simulated and permuted test statistics under the null, the main methodo-
logical difference we wished to examine. We randomly selected 1000 LD
blocks from the set of precomputed covariance matrices. Each underlying
covariance matrix was ﬁltered, so that only SNPs present and passing QC
for the TlDGC study dataset were present. For each LD block, we
created a set of corresponding genotype ﬁles using data from the
TlDGC study.

In total, 14753 SNPs were included over the 1000 randomly selected
LD blocks. We examined the median runtime speed using the R package

microbenchmark comparing the wgsea function pairtest() for the
permutation method against the VSEAMS function mvs .perm () for
10 permutations or simulations, for a variable number of cases and con-
trols. All benchmarks were run on a 4 Core AMD Opteron (2.8 GHz)
with 32 GB of RAM. Each individual benchmark corresponds to the
median time taken to generate 10 permutations or simulations for a
given LD block for a given sample size. To estimate the total execution
time for a given sample size, we summed median execution over all
LD blocks.

2.5 Transcription factor gene set processing

Cusanovich et al. (2014) present the results of differential gene expression
in siRNA knock-downs of 59 transcription factors and chromatin modi-
ﬁers in lymphoblastoid cell lines. We downloaded results available in their
Supplementary Table S3. For each transcription factor, we created a set
of test genes that were differentially expressed at an false discovery rate
(FDR) of 5%, making sure that the transcription factor itself was
excluded from this list, using the qvalues R package. We created a control
set by taking the remaining genes not in the test set and removing those
with missing values or showing evidence of differential expression at an
FDR of 10%. We ran each test/control set in parallel using VSEAMS,
and extended gene regions to incorporate :I:200 kb around gene transcrip-
tional start site (TSS) to best capture regulatory variation (Stranger et al.,
2012). We simulated 100 000 replicates of W to conﬁdently estimate V*.

3 RESULTS

3.1 VSEAMS pipeline

VSEAMS is a software pipeline implemented in R and Perl. To
maximize performance, it uses grid-based computing and the
macd queue submission manager. VSEAMS was developed to
run using the Sun Grid Engine; however, macd is designed to
be extensible to support other high-performance computing sub-
mission solutions. All software is available under open-source
license (GPL v2) from (http://github.com/ollyburren/vseams
and http://github.com/ollyburren/macd).

3.2 V* is a good approximation for V and
computationally more efﬁcient

There is good correlation between results obtained from
VSEAMS approximations and those from directly permuting
genotype (Fig. 2). The simulation method implemented in
VSEAMS is more efﬁcient than a comparable permutation ap-
proach. Figure 3a shows that the generation of simulated statis-
tics is faster than using permutation. Both methods exhibit a
linear relationship with number of SNPs; however, the simula-
tion is on average 100 times faster for a moderate GWAS of 4000
cases and 4000 controls (Fig. 3b). The permutation method run-
time shows a linear relationship with sample size, whereas the
simulation method runtime is independent of sample size, and is
10 times faster, even for 500 cases and controls.

3.3 T1D susceptibility enrichment in targets of the
transcription factors IKZF3, BA T F and ESRRA

Genes perturbed by 3 of 59 transcription factors in knock-down
experiments (Cusanovich et al., 2014) were enriched for associa-
tion with T1D (Fig. 4): IKZF3 (P = 1.1 x 10-4, 11 = 1798), BATF
(P = 4.4 x 10-4, n=210) and ESRRA (P = 8.0 x10-4,n= 614),
where n is the number of genes in each set. Fourteen genes are

Bonferroni threshold for that set (Supplementary Table S3). Of
these, 63 overlap regions of known T1D susceptibility (http://
immunobase.org accessed March15, 2014). We draw attention
to 10 genes that have no conclusively established association to
T1D but have been highlighted for other immune-modulated
diseases in ImmunoBase (Table 1), three of which are implicated
as candidate causal genes in one or more diseases: T RAF3IP2 in
psoriasis, ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease (Jostins et al.,
2012; Tsoi et al., 2012), ZNF438 in multiple sclerosis (IMSGC
et al., 2011) and RUNX3 in ankylosing spondylitis and psoriasis
(IGASC et al., 2013; Tsoi et al., 2012). The 22 remaining genes
have no established association to autoimmune disease, their
membership of functionally deﬁned gene sets, which show over-
all association with TlD suggests that they are also worth noting.

3.4 Effect of sample size and simulation number

We picked two gene sets from the Cusanovich et al. (2014) data-
set with similar test set SNP counts to examine the effect of

sample size and gene set selection on VSEAMS performance,
IKZF3 as an example where enrichment is present and YYI
where it is absent. Both sets exhibited similar behaviour. In gen-
eral, we see that the number of permutations required for a stable
correlation between permutation and VSEAMS Z—scores is inde-
pendent of sample size and is mainly dependent on gene set, and
for these gene sets, 5000 simulations seems sufﬁcient to ensure
VSEAMS is a good approximation for permutation. At sample
sizes <10 with a ﬁxed number of permutations, we observe
a large difference between Z—scores generated using
VSEAMS and permutation method (Fig. 5). Small sample sizes
(<200) show reduced correlation even for large numbers of
permutations.

4 DISCUSSION

Correlation is a problem for all enrichment analyses because it
results in inﬂated test statistics compared with their theoretical

differing sample size, for example, gene sets, where enrichment is present
(IKZF3) and absent (YYI). (a) Shows difference in Z—scores between both
methods with 10 000 simulations and a variable sample size, with an equal
number of cases and controls. 0)) Shows how the correlation between Z-
scores over a variable number of permutations varies with respect to
sample size. The coloured lines represent a locally estimated scatterplot
smoothing (LOESS) ﬁtted model for each sample size

distribution. This problem exists in GSEA of gene expression
datasets, but is more pronounced for SNP data, in which histor-
ical recombination events produce LD patterns that are both
complex and strong. The original GSEA method accounts for
this correlation by permuting phenotypes and repeating the
entire gene expression analysis multiple times (Subramanian
et al., 2005), an approach we also took in a previous variant
set enrichment analysis (Heinig et al., 2010). This computation-
ally intensive approach seems required because permuting SNPs
or genes directly destroys the correlation structure. Tests have
been adapted for gene set enrichment that deal theoretically with
the inﬂation of variance by estimating an average variance inﬂa-
tion factor WVu and Smyth, 2012), but for SNPs, we do not
believe a single variance inﬂation factor can capture the strength
and highly variable correlation observed. Instead, in VSEAMS,
we adapt a multivariate normal sampling approach, which we
show is not only faster than phenotype permutation, but can be
applied in the typical case where raw genotype data are not
available. Our analyses indicate that the exact number of simu-
lations required for a stable approximation of V* is speciﬁc to a
gene set, but suggest that 5000 permutations is sufﬁcient for the
GWAS data we consider here. VSEAMS is designed not to re-
quire raw genotype data, and alternative methods to conﬁrm
sufﬁciency of simulation could be adopted from those developed
in the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) literature (Geweke,
1992). Although this framework could equally be applied to
parametric tests such as t—tests, we chose to concentrate on a
non-parametric Wilcoxon) test because it is more robust to

occasional genotyping errors that may arise and that, without
access to genotyping data, are impossible to check.

Although the selection of test sets is often straightforward, the
selection of appropriate control sets tends not to be and requires
careful understanding of the competitive hypothesis tested in en-
richment studies and consideration of the appropriate control
set. Here, we restricted our set of control genes to genes that
were perturbed by at least one transcription factor in the lym-
phoblastoid cell line knock-down experiments (Cusanovich et al.,
2014). We encourage users to think carefully about the construc-
tion of control gene sets; for example, for microarray derived
sets, we advocate matching on mean gene expression and coefﬁ-
cient of variation.

All three transcription factors we identify from Cusanovich
et al. (2014) have been previously implicated in autoimmunity
when cross-referenced with data from ImmunoBase (http://
immunobase.org accessed April 3, 2014), providing validation
of the method. IKZF3 is a transcription factor located within a
T1D susceptibility locus at 17q12 (Barrett et al., 2009) and over-
laps susceptibility loci for ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease, pri-
mary billiary cirrhosis and rheumatoid arthritis (J ostins et al.,
2012; Liu et al., 2012; Stahl et al., 2010). IKZF3 is implicated in
the regulation of B cell lymphocyte proliferation and differenti-
ation (Morgan et al., 1997). BA T F overlaps rheumatoid arthritis
and multiple sclerosis susceptibility loci at 14q24.3 (IMSGC
et al., 2011; Stahl et al., 2010). Mice over expressing Batf show
impaired T-cell development in vitro and no induction of IL—2
Williams et al., 2003). ESRRA overlaps alopecia areate, Crohn’s
disease, multiple sclerosis and ulcerative colitis loci at 11q13.1
(IMSGC et al., 2011; J ostins et al., 2012; Petukhova et al., 2010)
and is a metabolic regulator of T—cell activation and differenti-
ation (Michalek et al., 2011). Future work will determine
whether the enrichment pattern observed with T1D is shared
with, or distinct from, other autoimmune traits.

The set of genes perturbed when [RF 7 is knocked down shows
no evidence for enrichment, in contrast to our previous work
(Heinig et al., 2010). This likely reﬂects that the transcription
factor experiments were performed in a lymphoblastoid cell
line. The master regulator of the [RF 7 network previously
described is GPRI83, and is known to be activated by exposure
to Epstein—Barr virus; therefore, [RF 7 responsiveness is likely to
be altered in LCLs, which emphasizes a need for transcription
factor function to be studied in primary cells.

Imprecise knowledge of regulatory variants for individual
genes hampers any test of variant set enrichment. As regulatory
variation may lie 200 kb from a gene (Stranger et al., 2012), we
use a large window to assign SNPs to genes. This increases the
likelihood of overlapping regions occurring in test and control
sets. We have implemented a random assignment strategy to
mitigate this, and, although unbiased, this approach can result
in a loss of power in the test for enrichment. Combination of
chromatin state annotation with high-throughput chromatin
conformation capture (‘Hi—C’) has the potential to allow better
deﬁnition of genomic regions involved in regulating speciﬁc
genes. This increased resolution will require a corresponding in-
crease in GWAS resolution through the use of imputation.
Additionally, as regulatory function varies in a cell-speciﬁc
manner, annotation of multiple primary cell types and careful

required. However, we expect this more precise deﬁnition of
functional SNP sets will allow a sharp increase in the power of
variant set enrichment analyses, and this will allow VSEAMS
analyses to interpret functionally deﬁned genetic regions by link-
ing them to end-point phenotypes.

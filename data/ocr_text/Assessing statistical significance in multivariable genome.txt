Abstract

Motivation: Although Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) genotype a very large number of
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), the data are often analyzed one SNP at a time. The low
predictive power of single SNPs, coupled with the high significance threshold needed to correct for
multiple testing, greatly decreases the power of GWAS.

Results: We propose a procedure in which all the SNPs are analyzed in a multiple generalized linear
model, and we show its use for extremely high—dimensional datasets. Our method yields P—values
for assessing significance of single SNPs or groups of SNPs while controlling for all other SNPs and
the family wise error rate (FWER). Thus, our method tests whether or not a SNP carries any add—
itional information about the phenotype beyond that available by all the other SNPs. This rules out
spurious correlations between phenotypes and SNPs that can arise from marginal methods because
the ‘spuriously correlated’ SNP merely happens to be correlated with the ‘truly causal’ SNP. In add—
ition, the method offers a data driven approach to identifying and refining groups of SNPs that jointly
contain informative signals about the phenotype. We demonstrate the value of our method by apply—
ing it to the seven diseases analyzed by the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC). We
show, in particular, that our method is also capable of finding significant SNPs that were not identi—
fied in the original WTCCC study, but were replicated in other independent studies.

1 Introduction

 

Genome—wide association studies (GWAS) have enjoyed increasing
success and popularity in recent years, due mostly to the thousands
of genetic variants found to be significantly associated with complex
traits (Welter et 61]., 2014). The two common designs are case—
control studies, which look for associations between SNPs and

disease, and population—based studies which focus on finding associ—
ations between SNPs and continuous traits (McCarthy et 61]., 2008).
The larger goal of these studies is to function as hypothesis—generat—
ing machines, resulting in sets of loci that require further analysis.
Thus GWAS are an important first step in the gene identification
process (Cantor et 61]., 2010). The findings from these studies

provide preliminary genetic information, which need additional ana—
lysis and follow—up experiments to be validated. However, many
studies have found only a few common SNPs per trait, and these
SNPs have generally low predictive power, explaining only a small
percentage of the variance (Manolio et 61]., 2009).

Often, SNPs are tested individually for association with the
phenotype, using the Armitage Trend Test. Because genome—wide
scans analyze hundreds of thousands or even millions of markers,
the multiple testing issue is resolved by applying a stringent signifi-
cance threshold—most commonly 5 >l< 10—8 (Panagiotou and
Ioannidis, 2012)—to the P—values. This method is successful only if
the study is well—powered, such that the associations are strong
enough to pass the stringent threshold. However, even if that is the
case, this type of analysis has several limitations, which have been
addressed in the literature (He and Lin, 2011; Hoggart et 61]., 2008;
Li et 61]., 2011; Rakitsch et 61]., 2013; Schork, 2001). Here we focus
on two of them. First, single SNPs tend to have small effect sizes.
We can increase the explanatory power by looking at the joint effect
of multiple SNPs. Second, when we test a SNP individually, we ig—
nore the effects of all other SNPs. If we analyze marginally two suffi-
ciently correlated SNPs, out of which only one is causal for the
disease, both may show an association. This leads to higher false
positive rates.

Joint modeling of all SNPs is challenging. Since in most GWAS
the number of SNPs is much larger than the number of samples, the
data cannot be analyzed using standard multivariable approaches.
An established method in the field is the Genome—wide Complex
Trait Analysis (GCTA), which is based on linear mixed models
(Yang et 61]., 2011, 2014) and enables some joint analysis of SNPs. It
allows for statistical significance tests of single SNPs (as fixed ef—
fects) while all SNPs other than the considered single SNP are built
into the model as a simultaneous random effect. We would classify
the obtained statistical significance of the SNPs as a hybrid between
marginal (with only one or a few SNPs as fixed effects) and joint
(since all the SNPs are in the model) modeling. It also enables to as—
sess the combined effect of all SNPs which quantifies the heritable
component of phenotype variation explained jointly by all the geno-
typed SNPs (Yang et 61]., 2010). Another solution to the high-dimen-
sionality of the problem is the use of penalized regression, which
constrains the magnitude of the regression coefficients, and allows
them to be estimated. The two most widely used penalization meth—
ods are the Lasso (Tibshirani, 1996) and Ridge regression (Hoerl
and Kennard, 1970). The Lasso penalizes the sum of the absolute
values of the regression coefficients. It is a sparse estimator, meaning
that it sets some regression coefficients to zero, while keeping others
non-zero. Ridge regression penalizes the sum of squared regression
coefficients, but it does not reduce the number of parameters in the
model. In Abraham et al. (2013) it has been shown in the context of
GWAS that penalization decreases the false positive rate and in—
creases the probability of detecting the causal SNPs. There are sev—
eral papers which consider a joint analysis. Methods which apply a
penalized model include: the Bayesian Lasso (Li et 61]., 2011), a two—
stage procedure using single regression followed by a Lasso selection
(Shi et 61]., 2011), stability selection in the context of GWAS
(Alexander and Lange, 2011), the so—called ISIS (Iterative Sure
Independence Screening) combined with stability selection to select
significant SNPs (He and Lin, 2011), a combination of Lasso and
linear mixed models (Rakitsch et 61]., 2013), Lasso for screening (Wu
et 61]., 2010) or ridge regression (Malo et 61]., 2008). None of the pro—
posals (Alexander and Lange, 2011; He and Lin, 2011; Li et al.,
2011; Rakitsch et 61]., 2013; Shi et 61]., 2011) compute P—values for
SNPs. Wu et al. (2010) aims to control the type I error rate, the

approaches using stability selection aim to control the expected
number of false positive selections (Meinshausen and Bijhlmann,
2010), while Shi et al. (2011) controls the False Discovery Rate
(FDR).

Our goal is to construct valid P—values for SNPs in a (joint) mul-
tiple generalized linear model together with a computationally effi—
cient and powerful way to address the issue of massive multiple
statistical hypothesis testing. The problem is challenging due to the
complex setting with hundreds of thousands of SNPs. Our method
relies on a hierarchical procedure from Mandozzi and Buhlmann
(2015) which we apply here for the first time to GWAS with very
high—dimensional datasets. It provides P—values for multiple (joint)
regression modeling of SNPs in high—dimensional settings. We com—
pute P—values not only for individual SNPs, but also for groups of
SNPs. The idea is to adapt to the strength of the signal present in the
data: if the signal is too weak or the SNPs exhibit too high correl-
ation, we might still detect a significant group of SNPs, instead of
single SNP markers. Additionally, we compute the explained vari—
ance for every such group in a high-dimensional generalized linear
model.

We demonstrate our method on the WTCCC data (The
Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium, 2007), due to the fact
that strong associations have been found for some phenotypes in
this dataset, and many of their findings have been replicated in sub—
sequent studies. However, our method’s advantages are also evident
for phenotypes with weak associations: for biologically distant
phenotypic traits, the goal is rather to find regions of the genome
that are strongly associated with the phenotype. Our proposed
method makes it statistically and computationally possible to assess
the significance of the parameters in a multiple (generalized) linear
model, for large scale GWAS problems with millions of SNP
markers. The interpretation of the parameters in a multiple (general—
ized) linear model is markedly different from marginal associ-
ation and also from GCTA (Yang et 61]., 2011). In fact, under
some assumptions, we can link the (joint) multiple linear model to
causal inference (see Section 2.1). Thus, it as an important step to
perform the statistical inference in a multiple generalized linear
model.

2 Methods

Consider the following setting and notation. There are 11 samples
(e.g. persons in a study), and each of them is indexed with
i E {1, . . . ,  A response variable Y,- for the ith sample point (e.g.
the ith person in the study) encodes the status of a phenotype of
interest. For example the binary status of a disease with Y,- E {0, 1},
the continuous value of a survival time with Y,- E RT or the continu—
ous degree of an exposure or (log—) concentration with Y,- E IR. The
regressor X,- is a (long) p X 1 vector which encodes the SNP profile
for the ith sample point: Xi),- E {0, 1,2} is the value of the jth SNP
for sample point 1', taking three possible values corresponding to the
number of minor alleles per person. Typically, the number of SNPs
(regressors) is p m 106, while the number of samples is at least one
order of magnitude smaller. A model measuring multivariable asso—

ciation is introduced next.

2.1 Generalized linear models

A well—established model for relating the phenotype (response vari—
able) and the SNPs (regressors) is a generalized linear model
(McCullagh and Nelder, 1989).

The easiest form thereof is a linear model for continuous (IR—val—
ued) responses:

P
Yi=ﬂo+Zﬂ,-X.~,,-+si(i=1,...,n), (1)

i=1
where 81, . . .,8,, are independent and identically distributed noise

terms with expectation IE[8,-] : 0, finite variance and which are
uncorrelated with the regressors X17).

For binary responses with Y,- E {0, 1}, representing case (2 1) or
control (2 0), we consider a logistic regression model:

Y,- N Bernoulli(7t,-),

._ ._ . _L<m> -_
TE,—P(Y,—1|X,,ﬂ)—1+exp(m),(1—1,...,7’t),

7'51"

 

1n( ) = m = ﬂo + Z 12X”- (2)

1—7'51'

Here, it,- represents the probability of individual i having a case sta—
tus given its SNPs Xi. There is no additional noise term and the sto—
chastic nature of the model comes from the probability in.

In both models, ﬂo denotes the intercept, and the coefficients ﬂ,-
are the (logistic) regression coefficients which measure the associ—
ation of the jth SNP with the response. Such models, which take into
account all SNPs, have two features. First, the (generalized) regres—
sion coefficients have the following (well—known) interpretation: ﬂ,-
measures the association effect of Xi),- on Y,- which is not explained
by all other variables {X,7k; la #1}. Thus, a large ﬂ], in absolute
value, has the very powerful interpretation that SNP j has a strong
association to the phenotype given all other SNPs or controlling for
all other SNPs. This is in sharp contrast to marginal correlation be—
tween SNP j and the phenotype Y which can easily be of spurious
nature and caused by another SNP la having a strong correlation
with the phenotype and with SNP 1'.

Furthermore, the regression models are predictive in the sense that
for a new sample point (e.g. person) with a given SNP profile chw we
obtain a prediction for the corresponding phenotype (e.g. disease
status) E[Yncw|XneW] = [30 + :3le pixnew, or IP[YneW = 1|Xn6W] =
nnew, where anew : ﬂo —l— 2le ﬂanewji. Note that this prediction is
likely to be more informative or precise than a prediction that is based
merely on marginal correlations because the general linear model
applied here enables us to use the whole new SNP proﬁle, and not
just single SNPs, for predictive purposes.

Our main goal is to infer statistical significance of a single SNP
or of a possibly large group of correlated SNPs for a given pheno—
type. More precisely, we aim for P—values, adjusted for multiple test—
ing, when testing the following hypotheseszfor single SNP j

H07): ﬂl- : 0 versus HA7): ﬂl- 7E 0, (3)
or for a group G Q {1, . . . ,p} of SNPs
H07G: ﬂl- =0 foralle G

versus HAaG : at least for onej E G we have that ﬂ,- 7é 0. (4)

The obtained P—values are with respect to a regression model and
hence, they share the interpretation with the regression parameters
described above. In particular, they are markedly different from a
marginal or linear mixed model approach: the differences are also
illustrated in simulation studies in Section 3.1.

A link to causal inference. If we assume (i) that the model is cor—
rect and that beyond the measured SNPs there are no hidden con—
founding variables—a condition that might be somewhat less
problematic when having a million or more SNP markers—and (ii)
that the causes point from the SNPs to the phenotype Y, the param—
eters ﬂl- (j = 1, . . . , p) can be given a causal interpretation. This link
to causal inference shows again that a (joint) multiple regression
model is very different from a marginal model. In a structural equa—
tion model the assumption that the causes point from the SNPs to
the phenotype Y means that the arrows in a directed acyclic graph,
that encode the causal influence diagram, point to Y and never point
away from Y, i.e. Y is childless. Such an assumption says that some
SNPs might be the cause for a phenotype, but the phenotype cannot
be a cause for the SNPs, which seems a very reasonable assumption.
Under these conditions, the following holds: if ﬂ,- 7é 0, then there
must be a directed edge in the causal inﬂuence diagram of a linear
structural equation model from SNP j to the phenotype Y with non-
zero edge weight, i.e. there exists a non—zero direct causal effect
from SNP j to the phenotype Y. This statement is not true with mar—
ginal associations (i.e. if SNP j is only marginally associated with Y)
since adjusting for all other SNPs (different from SNP j) is crucial
for causal statements. The details are given in Proposition S1.1 in
the Supplementary Material Section S1.

2.2 The challenge of high—dimensionality
The difficulty with a regression type analysis is the sheer high—
dimensionality of the problem. The number of SNPs p m 106 is mas—
sively larger than sample size n, which is at least one order of magni—
tude smaller. In such scenarios, standard statistical inference
methods fail. Recent progress based on new methods such as mul—
tiple sample splitting, has allowed us to obtain statistical signifi—
cance measures for regression parameters ﬂ,- (Buhlmann, 2013;
Meinshausen et al., 2009; Zhang and Zhang, 2014, cf.) or groups
thereof (Mandozzi and Buhlmann, 2015). We rely here on this
method (Mandozzi and Buhlmann, 2015), which shows reliable per—
formance over a wide range of simulation settings (Dezeure et al.,
2015), and enjoys the property of being computationally vastly
more efficient than procedures which operate on the entire dataset.
We extend the procedure from Mandozzi and Buhlmann (2015)
from linear to logistic regression, and we show here for the first time
how it performs for extremely high—dimensional GWAS data. The
entire statistical procedure is schematically summarized in Figure 1.
In view of the high-dimensional nature of GWAS, it is rather un—
likely to detect single SNPs which are significant when controlling

Fig. 1. Schematic overview of the method. ‘Clustering' refers to the step of
hierarchically clustering the SNPs. SNPs on different chromosomes are clus-
tered separately, after which the 22 clusters are joined into one final cluster
containing all SNPs. ‘Multi-Sample Splitting and SNP Screening' stands for
the SNP selection in steps 1 and 2 of the method described in Section 2.4.2.
These selected SNPs are used to compute the P-values. Finally, the last step
of the method—‘Hierarchical Testing'—uses the selected SNPs to test groups
of SNPs and eventually single SNPs. This testing is done hierarchically, on
the cluster previously constructed. The output of the method consists of sig-
nificant groups, or single SNPs, along with their P-values, that are adjusted
for multiple testing

for all other SNPs. Thus, it is a—priori more likely to detect (large)
significant groups of SNPs with respect to the group hypotheses
H07G in a regression model. The construction of such groups is
achieved by clustering the SNPs, as explained next.

2.3 Clustering

Our goal is to perform significance testing on single SNPs (the
hypotheses H0”) as well as arbitrarily large groups of SNPs (the
hypotheses HoaG). We do this hierarchically since this allows for
powerful multiple testing adjustment as well as for efficient compu—
tation (see Section 2.4).

We first discuss the hierarchical clustering of SNPs. The hier-
archy can be constructed in different ways. One option is to use spe—
cific domain knowledge to group the SNPs, for instance by
clustering them first into genes, and then into functional pathways.
Another option is to use standard hierarchical clustering methods
which rely on a distance measure between the SNPs.

Here we adopt the second approach, which is similar to the con-
struction of haplotype maps (Barrett et al., 2005). We use hierarch—
ical clustering with average linkage (Jain and Dubes, 1988) which
can be represented as a cluster tree, denoted by T. The method re—
quires a distance or dissimilarity measure between SNPs. We con—
sider the distance between two SNPs as one minus their linkage
disequilibrium (LD) value, where LD refers to the statistical depend—
ency of the DNA content at nearby locations of the chromosome.
One of the most common measures of LD is the square of the
Pearson correlation coefficient (Hill and Robertson, 1968), which
quantifies the linear dependence between two loci. Thus, two SNPs
will have an LD equal to one if they are perfectly correlated, or an
LD equal to zero if they are uncorrelated. Since LD has a tendency
to decay with the distance of the studied loci, close—by SNPs are typ—
ically in high LD. This means that SNPs belonging to the same gene,
or more generally, neighboring SNPs will end up in the same cluster.
Often, LD is studied within each chromosome separately. Therefore,
we construct separate cluster trees for each chromosome (in add—
ition to providing a biological interpretation, clustering each
chromosome separately results in substantial computational gains
for problems with p m 106 SNPs), and we then join these into
one tree T which contains all the SNPs in the study, as shown in
Figure 2.

2.4 Statistical significance testing
A cluster, as described in Section 2.3, is denoted by the generic letter
G which encodes a subset of {1, . . . , p} of single SNPs. We explain

Fig. 2. The final cluster tree. The SNPs are first partitioned into chromosomes,
and then a cluster tree is built for each chromosome separately using hier-
archical clustering with average linkage. The hierarchical clusters of SNPs
within chromosomes are not shown due to their size

here how to test a null—hypothesis for a group Hojc in (4) or for a
single SNP H07,- in (3).

2.4.1 Hierarchical inference

In Section 2.4.2 we will show how one can construct valid P—values
for the hypotheses H07,- and HoaG. On the basis of valid P—values, our
hierarchical approach proceeds as follows:

1. Test the global hypothesis Hogglobal where Gglobal : {1, . . . ,p}:
that is, we test whether all SNPs have corresponding (general-
ized) regression coefﬁcients equal to zero or alternatively,
whether there is at least one SNP which has a non—zero regres—
sion coefﬁcient. If we can reject this global hypothesis, we go to
the next step.

2. Test the hypotheses Hog1 , . . . , Hog22 where Gk contains all the
SNPs on chromosome la. For those chromosomes la where Hog,e
can be rejected, we go to the next step.

3. Test hierarchically the groups G which correspond to chromo—
somes la where Hog,a was previously rejected. Consider ﬁrst the
largest groups and then proceed hierarchically (down the cluster
tree) to smaller groups until a hypothesis HoaG cannot be rejected
anymore or the level of single SNPs is reached.

4. The output is a collection of groups Gfina171,...,Gﬁna17m where
Hojcﬁnalk is rejected (la : 1, . . . ,m) and all subgroups of Gﬁnalak
(la : 1, . . . ,m) downwards in the cluster tree are not signiﬁcant
anymore.

In such a hierarchical testing procedure, which belongs to the
scheme of sequential multiple hypothesis testing, the multiple testing
adjustment is resolution dependent. To guarantee that the family-
wise error, i.e. the probability for at least one false rejection of the
hypotheses among the multiple tests, is smaller than or equal to or
for some pre—specified 0 < at < 1, e.g. or = 0.05, the hypothesis
tests must be performed at different significance levels, depending
on where one is in the hierarchy. The more we descend in the hier—
archy, the more the multiple testing adjustment increases because
we do more tests. It is important to keep in mind that even though
the procedure controls the type I error simultaneously over all levels
of the hierarchy, the adjustment for larger clusters does not depend
on whether one will test their subclusters or not. While there is an
ordering of the clusters, due to the nature of the hierarchical cluster—
ing procedure, and testing of subclusters stops once the null hypoth—
esis of the parent cluster is accepted, the adjustment applied to the
P—value of any cluster does not depend on the number of tests that
have already been performed, but only (essentially) on the size of
that particular cluster, see Section 2.4.2. The details have been de—
veloped by Meinshausen (2008). In other words: the final output of
the method are P—values for significant groups Gfina171,...,Gﬁna17m
with the interpretation, that these P—values control the familywise
error rate for multiple testing (if we collect all groups with a P—value
smaller or equal to at, then the probability for making one or more
false rejections among all considered tests is less or equal to ac).
Furthermore, due to the hierarchical structure of the procedure, we
can massively reduce the number of computations: if the final clus—
ters or groups Gﬁnalak are relatively high up in the hierarchy of the
cluster tree, we only need to compute relatively few hypothesis tests.

2.4.2 Construction of the P-values

The hierarchical inference procedure above assumes that one has a
method that constructs P—values which are valid (a P—value P is
valid for a null-hypothesis H0 if IPHO [P g at] g or for any

0 < at < 1, where PHO denotes the probability assuming that H0 is
true).

Due to the high—dimensionality with p >> n, obtaining a P—value
for the hypotheses Hg),- or HoaG in (3) or (4) is a non-trivial problem.
We rely here on a multiple sample splitting approach from
Meinshausen et al. (2009), and we follow exactly the method from
Mandozzi and Buhlmann (2015). The idea is as follows. For h = 1,
. . . ,B repetitions:

1. Randomly partition the n samples into two parts, say N55) and
N531.

2. Using a variable selection procedure such as the (logistic) Lasso
(Friedman et al., 2010; Tibshirani, 1996), select regressors
(SNPs) based on data from the ﬁrst half—sample N55). Denote the
selected regressors by 80)) Q {1, . . . ,p}. Because a Lasso esti—
mated model has cardinality smaller or equal to min(n, p), the
number of selected variables  | < n/2 will be smaller than
half of the sample size. We choose to select the ﬁrst n/ 6 SNPs
that enter the Lasso path. This ensures that we have enough
regressors for computing P—values.

3. Based on data from the second half—sample N52, use classical
P—value constructions in a linear or generalized linear model
with the selected regressors (SNPs) from 80)) in the previous
step. The construction of a P—value of a cluster G is done in the
following manner: we intersect the hierarchy T constructed in
Section 2.3 (using hierarchical clusteringg) with S (b), obtaining an
induced hierarchy with root node S . The testing is then
applied on this induced hierarchy. Finally we assign the P—value
to the engre cluster G, although we have only used the variables
in G D S .

Finally, the hierarchically adjusted P—value of a cluster G is:
P]? = max PG (8)

DETzGQD

The sample splitting in step 1 is made to avoid being over—optimistic
when performing variable selection and P—value construction on the
same dataset. The repeated sample splitting in step 4 helps to
achieve much more reliable results which do not depend in a sensi—
tive way on how we split the sample (Meinshausen et al., 2009, cf.).
More details about the assumptions which guarantee control of the

familywise error rate are provided in Supplementary Material
Section S2.

This multi-sample splitting method is computationally fast since
Lasso in step 2 is rather cheap to perform and step 3 requires clas—
sical P—value computations in low—dimensional models with fewer
than n regressors only. In terms of accuracy for type I error control,
i.e. avoiding false rejections of hypotheses, the multi—sample splitting
approach has been found very reliable in extensive simulations rela-
tive to other methods. This reliability comes at the price of being
slightly inferior in terms of power to detect true underlying positive
findings (Dezeure et al., 2015), see also Mandozzi and Buhlmann
(2015 ). However, this slightly more conservative scheme has the ad—
vantage of limiting false positives.

3 Results

3.1 Simulation studies

We used the WTCCC Crohn’s disease genotype data to create semi—
synthetic datasets. To generate the new genotype matrix, we kept all
the samples (n = 4682), but selected a block of 500 consecutive
SNPs from each of the 22 autosomal chromosomes, having in total
11 000 SNPs. The phenotype data was generated from a logistic re—
gression model with the probability of having the disease as the de—
pendent variable and 10 causal SNPs as the independent variables.
We considered three designs for choosing the causal SNPs:

To ensure that the number of cases and controls are not too dif—
ferent, we required the ratio between cases and controls to be within
the interval [0.67, 1.5]. We kept the genotype matrix constant, and
generated 100 simulation runs for each design, using new coeffi-
cients for every simulation run.

We chose to compare our method to three other algorithms. One
is the classic bivariate testing, implemented in PLINK (Purcell et al.,
2007). The other two are mixed model approaches: the FaST—LMM
(Lippert et al., 2011) and the GCTA (Yang et al., 2011) algorithms.
Both calculate a genetic relationship matrix (GRM) to control for
the effect of the other SNPs. There are many ways of computing the
GRM. One can use all the SNPs, or just a particular subset. An ap—
proach that is computationally efficient is leave—one—chromosome—
out (LOCO) (Yang et al., 2014). With this option when one tests the
SNPs in a particular chromosome, the SNPs from all the other
chromosomes besides the one being tested are used to compute the
GRM. The main difference between mixed models and our method
is the way in which the effects of other SNPs are modeled. While the
mixed model uses a random component to account for all the other
SNPs, our method considers each SNP as a fixed effect, and includes
all of them in the model.

Our goal was to assess how good these methods are at detecting
the causal variants (which are known for simulated data), while lim-
iting the number of false positives: SNPs that are not truly causal
(but perhaps correlated with the causal variants). Assessing the

performance of the methods was done by considering several crite—
ria. The first is the FWER, which we expect to be controlled at level
or. This is equivalent to expecting 100 *oc false discoveries, when per-
forming 100 simulations. As a less conservative criterion, we also
consider the k—FWER, a generalized version of the FWER. The k-
FWER is defined as P{V 2 la}, where V is the total number of false
rejections. For our simulations, we are interested in the value of la,
under which the k—FWER is controlled at level or = 0.05. In the case
of our method, a rejection is considered false only if the cluster does
not contain any of the true causal SNPs. The third assessment crite—
ria is the power of the method. Also here we consider two variants.
The first is a ‘naive’ version, which considers all findings where the
true causal SNP is present in a cluster, irrespective of the cluster size.
The second metric penalizes the size of the group with respect to the
causal variants. This is computed in the following way:

where Gsign is the set of groups declared significant by our method,
and SO is the set of true causal SNPs. For the three comparison meth-
ods, we declare significant SNPs that have a P—value below 5 >l< 10—8,
and compute the power, FWER and k—FWER using this set.

The results shown in Table 1 are in line with our expectations. In
the first 2 designs, our method has a lower power compared to the
other three methods that behave almost identically. The cost of a
larger power is however a significant increase in the number of false
positives. While our method fails to control the FWER due to the
very complex correlation structure in the data, it does however con—
trol the 2—FWER at level or. This means that the probability of mak—
ing more than 2 false rejections is below or. In comparison, the other
three methods do on average at least one order of magnitude more
false rejections. This has to do with the fact that they infer marginal
associations, or associations which are partially adjusted by random
effects: many significant findings are spurious because of high cor—
relation between some of the SNPs. The lower power of our
hierGWAS procedure can be explained by the fact that it aims to
infer associations which are adjusted for other SNPs: our method
would detect some of them individually, some of them as groups,
and if the correlation among some SNPs is too strong (or the signal
too weak), it would miss some. This becomes apparent also when
we consider the two power measures: POWadaPn-Ue is always smaller
than POW, because some of the causal SNPs will be grouped into

clusters, due to their correlation structure. In the case of the third de—
sign, our method has the same power as the other three to detect the
causal SNPs. If we assume that this is close in spirit to the real life
case of having one causal SNP surrounded by many others that are
in LD with the causal one, our method has the power to detect it
just as well as the marginal methods, while providing a greatly
reduced set of false positives, and a much stronger interpretation of
the findings. While the FWER is the highest in the third design, due
to the fact that there are many more confounders around each SNP
compared to the other two designs, our method still performs much
better, by controlling the 3—FWER at level or. We note that GCTA
and FaST—LMM have a slight disadvantage regarding the control of
false positives, because we used the LOCO approach to compute the
GRM. However, since this is an established approach, and the strat—
egy of eliminating only the SNP being tested, and using all other
SNPs to construct the GRM is computationally infeasible (Yang
et al., 2014), we believe that this situation reﬂects reality.

3.2 WTCCC data

We validate our method on data from The Wellcome Trust Case
Control Consortium (2007). The Wellcome Trust Case Control
Consortium study used 3000 subjects and 2000 shared controls from
the British population to examine 7 major diseases: bipolar disorder
(BD), coronary artery disease (CAD), Crohn’s disease (CD), hyperten—
sion (HT), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type
2 diabetes (T2D). The subjects were genotyped using the Affymetrix
GeneChip 500K Mapping Array Set. Though The Wellcome Trust
Case Control Consortium (2007) reported all SNPs with a P—value
< 5 >l< 10—4, the threshold for strong association was set to 5 >l< 10—7.
Using the standard marginal analysis, the WTCCC study identified 21
new SNPs strongly associated to the phenotype. For BD rs42025 9 on
chromosome 16, for CAD rs1333049 on chromosome 9, for CD, the
WTCCC study identified 9 SNPs strongly associated to the phenotype:
rs11805 303 on chromosome 1, rs10210302 on chromosome 2,
rs9858542 on chromosome 3, rs17234657 and rs1000113 on
chromosome 5, rs10761659 and rs10883365 on chromosome 10,
rs17221417 on chromosome 16 and finally rs2542151 on chromo-
some 18. 2 SNPs were found for RA: rs6679677 on chromosome 1
and rs6457617 on chromosome 6. T1D was strongly associated to 5
SNPs: rs6679677 on chromosome 1, rs9272346 on chromosome 6,
rs11171739 and rs17696736 on chromosome 12 and rs12708716 on
chromosome 16. Finally, for T2D 3 associations were found:
rs9465871 on chromosome 6, rs4506565 on chromosome 10 and
rs9939609 on chromosome 16 . For HT, the WTCCC did not find any
SNP strongly associated to the phenotype.

Before applying our analysis, we have preprocessed the data, by
excluding some SNPs and samples, as well as imputing the missing
SNPs. Details about this procedure are given in the Supplementary
Material Section S4.1.

The output of our method is a list of SNP groups of different
sizes. These represent the smallest jointly significant groups in the
hierarchical tree of SNPs. We create a distinction between small
(<10 SNPs) and large groups, and present the corresponding results
separately. The number 10 is somewhat arbitrary and determined by
notational simplicity to list at most 10 SNPs per group. We identi—
fied small groups for 5 of the 7 diseases, and present them below.
Large groups have been identified for all of the diseases, however we
chose to present in detail the results for BD only. We chose BD be—
cause it is the disease for which the WTCCC found a single strongly
associated SNP, which we did not identify using our method. The
large groups for the other six diseases are detailed in the

Supplementary Material Section S4. It is important to note that these
groups are not overlapping. For example, if in a specific chromo-
some we find a small group of four SNPs, as well as two large
groups both containing thousands of SNPs, these three groups do
not share common SNPs and they belong to different regions of the
chromosome. This happens because our method finds the smallest
group of SNPs for which the null hypothesis can be rejected. Such a
result means that one region of the chromosome exhibits a strong
signal, while there are other regions exhibiting weaker signal. Thus,
the size of the group reﬂects the strength of associations: the weaker
these associations, the larger the significant groups.

Tables 2 reports on individual SNPs or small clusters of SNPs se—
lected by our method for the seven diseases we analyzed. We found
a total of 20 such clusters, out of which 16 are individual SNPs.

Twelve out of the 20 clusters contain at least one SNP that was
found to be strongly associated to the phenotype in the original
WTCCC study. The remaining eight clusters contain SNPs that are
either in LD with the ones identified by the WTCCC, belong to the
same gene or genomic region, or have been identified as having a
significant effect in other studies. While it is informative to see if
our findings have been previously reported in other studies, it is
important to remember the distinction in terms of interpretation.
Our method makes the significance of previous findings much
stronger, because it does not simply compute the marginal correl-
ation, but it instead tests whether the effect of a SNP or a group is
still significant after we have taken into account the effect of all
other SNPs. In the case of the small clusters, it restricts the con—
founders to a reduced number of SNPs that are either introns in the
same gene, or in close proximity to each other. Besides these small

significant groups, our method also identified larger groups.
Again, it is important to keep in mind that these larger groups are
not overlapping with the smaller ones, and they are in other re—
gions of the chromosome. These clusters contain many of the SNPs
that were identified to have moderate associations in the original
study. Because of their size, they are given lower weight in terms of
power, however, they reflect the assumption that these diseases are
highly polygenic, and associations appear in many places through—
out the genome. In the following we will describe in more detail
our findings for each disease.

3.2.1 Coronary artery disease

We replicated rs1333049, an intergenic SNP on chromosome 9, the
only finding from the WTCCC study. Our result however has a
much stronger interpretation compared to the original finding, be-
cause we control for all possible confounders. Thus, rs1333049
shows an association with the phenotype, even after taking into ac—
count the effects of all other SNPs.

3.2.2 Crohn’s disease

On chromosome 1 we identified a small significant cluster of five
SNPs: rs11805303, rs2201841, rs11209033, rs12141431 and
rs12119179. Two of them: rs11805303 and rs2201841 are introns
in the IL23R gene, while the last three SNPs are up to 22—kb down—
stream from IL23R. Though rs11805 303 showed strong association
in the WTCCC study (The Wellcome Trust Case Control
Consortium, 2007), our result has a different and much stronger in-
terpretation. Our finding is a group of five SNPs that are jointly sig—
nificant, though none of them is significant individually. Because

this significance results from a joint model of all SNPs, it means that
our group is jointly significant while controlling for all other SNPs
in the study. The interpretation of this finding is that we limit the set
of confounding SNPs to four other SNPs. When a SNP is declared
significant by computing the marginal correlation, like in The
Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (2007), the set of possible
confounders that produce this correlation is the set of all other
SNPs. Thus, if the correlation turns out to be a spurious one, there
could be hundreds of other SNPs that produce it. In contrast, our
method not only drastically reduces the number of confounders, but
gives a small set of much more plausible ones, that are in a narrow
region of the chromosome, often clustered around a gene. On
chromosome 2 we identified an individual SNP, rs10210302, which
showed strong association in the WTCCC paper (The Wellcome
Trust Case Control Consortium, 2007). This SNP has by far the
lowest P—value (4.6 >l< 10—5 ) in CD, and it also explains a relatively
large proportion of the variance attributed to chromosome 2: 0.014
compared to 0.05 explained by all the selected SNPs in the chromo—
some. On chromosome 5 we identified a group of 9 SNPs:
rs6871834, rs4957295, rs11957215, rs10213846, rs4957297,
rs4957300, rs9292777, rs10512734 and rs16869934. They are all
intergenic, 85 kb apart and located in the 40.4M region of the
chromosome. rs16869934 is 4 kb downstream from the SNP
rs17234657 showing strong association to CD in The Wellcome
Trust Case Control Consortium (2007). On chromosome 10 we
found 2 significant SNPs. The first is rs10883371, a 2—kb upstream
variant both for LINC01475 and NKX2—3. rs10883365, found to
be strongly associated to CD in the WTCCC study is a 2—kb up—
stream variant in LINC01475. Our second finding on chromosome
10 is rs1076 165 9, a non—coding intergenic SNP mapping 14-kb telo-
meric to gene ZNF365 and was identified first by the WTCCC (The
Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium, 2007), followed by a
meta—analysis (Franke et al., 2010) and later a study of a southern
european population by Julia et al. (2013). On chromosome 16, we
found an individual SNP, rs207675 6, which is an intron in NOD2.
Interestingly, this SNP was not found to be significant in the original
WTCCC study, while our approach shows that it is even significant
when we control for all other SNPs. This SNP has been confirmed
by several studies (Franke et al., 2010; Julia et al., 2013; Kenny
et al., 2012; Rioux et al., 2007). Finally, on chromosome 18, we
identified a single intergenic SNP: rs2542151. This finding was re-
ported by The Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (2007), as
well as by Parkes et al. (2007).

3.2.3 Rheumatoid arthritis

We identified two SNPs, both individually significant. The first,
rs6679677 is located on chromosome 1 and is a 2—kb upstream vari—
ant in the PHTF1 gene. This finding was reported by The Wellcome
Trust Case Control Consortium (2007). The second SNP,
rs9272346, is located on chromosome 6 and is also a 2—kb upstream
variant in the HLA-DQA1 gene. This SNP belongs to the MHC re—
gion, just like the WTCCC finding.

3.2.4 Type 1 diabetes

Eight individual SNPs were declared significant by our method. Five
of these are the five associations found in The Wellcome Trust Case
Control Consortium (2007). These are: rs6679677, a 2—kb upstream
variant in the PHTF1 gene on chromosome 1, rs9272346, a 2—kb up—
stream variant in the HLA-DQA1 gene on chromosome 6,
rs11171739, an intergenic SNP on chromosome 12, rs17696736, an
intron in the NAA25 gene on chromosome 12 and rs12924729, an

intron in the CLEC16A gene on chromosome 16. Additionally, our
method identified 3 new associations. Two of them are located on
chromosome 6: rs9272723 is an intron in the HLA-DQA1 gene and
rs2523691 is intergenic. The third new finding, rs17388568, is
located on chromosome 4 and is an intron in the ADAD1 gene. It
did not reach the genome wide significance threshold in the
WTCCC study, however it showed moderate association with a
P-value of 3 >l< 10—6. It also showed moderate association in an inde-
pendent study by Plagnol et al. (201 1).

3.2.5 Type 2 diabetes

We identified two small SNP clusters, one on chromosome 10 and
the other on chromosome 16. The first cluster contains 10 SNPs:
rs4074720, rs10787472, rs7077039, rs11196208, rs11196205,
rs10885409, rs12243326, rs4132670, rs7901695, rs4506565, all
introns in the TCF7L2 gene, spanning a 62 kb region. One of them,
rs45 06565, was originally identified by The Wellcome Trust Case
Control Consortium (2007), while rs7901695 showed a significant
association in a replication study by Zeggini et al. (2007). The se—
cond cluster is comprised of four SNPs: rs9926289, rs7193144,
rs8050136, rs9939609, all introns in the FTO gene spanning 10 kb.
rs9939609 was significantly associated to the phenotype in The
Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (2007). Additionally,
rs8050136 was found to have strong significance in Zeggini et al.
(2007) and Scott et al. (2007).

3.2.6 Bipolar disorder

For BD, the WTCCC identified only one SNP strongly associated
to the phenotype: rs42025 9. While we did not identify it in a small
group, it is present in the large group found to be significant on
chromosome 16. Furthermore, as can be seen in Table 3, we found
clusters in many of the chromosomes. Table 3 shows the group
size, both in terms of number of SNPs, as well as in terms of per—
centage of the total SNPs in that particular chromosome.
Additionally, we investigate whether the SNPs identified using the
standard analysis with PLINK (Purcell et al., 2007) map into our
groups. The size of the group is in a way inversely proportional to
the strength of associations. If a certain chromosome contains
SNPs with large effects, we will be able to find them in very small
clusters, or maybe even individually. If however the signal is weak,
we can only identify larger regions. For example, on chromosomes
4, 6, 7, 8, 10 and 15 the signal is so weak that we can only report
that the joint effect of all SNPs in these chromosomes is significant,
but we cannot further localize the signal. On the other hand, on
chromosome 3 we were able to identify a much smaller group con—
taining only 6% of the SNPs.

Our method returns the smallest number of SNPs for which we
can find a significant effect, while controlling for all other SNPs.
The fact that we cannot disaggregate the signal to small clusters, or
single SNPs does not mean that genetics plays no role in BD, but
rather that the signal is very dispersed and the effect sizes are very
small. This explains why our groups are so large, and why we can—
not attribute the signal to narrower regions. Figure 3 shows the
variance in bipolar disorder explained by the SNPs on individual
chromosomes. We only consider the SNPs selected by the Lasso, in
step 2 of Section 2.4.2, as these SNPs are a proxy for the truly rele-
vant SNPs. The total variance explained by all the SNPs is 0.5 , and
Figure 3 describes how this variation is distributed across the
chromosomes. The fitted line corresponds to a linear model, where
the predictor is the chromosome length, and the response is the ex—
plained variance. The plot gives weight to our previous statement,

eWe counted the number of SNPs with P-Values < 5 >I< 10’4 identiﬁed
using PLINK (Purcell et al., 2007). We looked at how many of those SNPs are
present in the groups selected by our method. The numbers refer to the SNPs

on individual chromosomes.

Length of individual chromosome (% of total length of genome)

Fig. 3. Variance in bipolar disorder that is explained by individual chromo-
somes. The variance on the vertical axis is given by the R2 value of all the se-
lected SNPs in a chromosome, as described in the Supplementary Material
Section 83. The total variance explained by all the selected SNPs on all the
chromosomes is 0.5

as the variance is homogeneously distributed across the chromo—
somes. The plot shows an excellent fit (R2 m 0.91), meaning that
the length of a chromosome is a very good predictor for the

amount of variance that a particular chromosome explains.

3.2.7 Hypertension

Hypertension was the only disease where The Wellcome Trust Case
Control Consortium (2007) did not find any strongly associated
SNPs. We also haven’t found small clusters or individual SNPs, but
we did find larger clusters on 13 of the chromosomes. The results
are shown in the Supplementary Material Section S47.

4 Discussion

We have presented a new method for assigning statistical signifi-
cance in GWAS. Our approach goes beyond the bivariate testing of
individual SNPs that looks only at marginal associations. Instead,
we use a multivariable approach which includes all the SNPs and
controls the familywise error rate. We propose to assign P—values in
a hierarchical manner: first for chromosomes, and then in a top—
down fashion from larger to smaller groups of SNPs. Such an ap—
proach addresses several issues. First, since regression parameters of
individual SNPs are typically very small, due to their interpretation
and meaning in the model, it is much more likely to detect signifi—
cant groups of SNPs. Second, because we proceed hierarchically, the
problem of multiple testing is much less severe than for the classical
one—SNP—at—a—time approach: roughly speaking, one has to adjust
only for the number of tests which are considered, and this number
is typically much smaller than the entire number of SNPs in the
study. Our method is data—driven in the sense that its resolution for
the groups of SNPs depends on the strength of the signal present in
the data: how much we proceed in the hierarchy and refine the clus-
ters of SNPs depends on how strong the associations are. If the sig—
nal is strong and well—localized, we find small clusters or individual
SNPs, whereas if the signal is weak, we identify larger regions.

We demonstrate our method on the WTCCC data (The
Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium, 2007), where we analyze
the seven diseases. Though it is interesting to conceptually validate
our findings by comparing them with a measure of marginal associ—
ation, our method is different and allows for a more powerful inter-
pretation of the findings than testing only marginal association
between a SNP and the phenotype. This is because we test whether
or not SNPs in a cluster carry any additional information about the
phenotype, beyond that available through all the other SNPs. That
is, we adjust for the effect of all other SNPs that are not part of this
cluster, which translates to a very strong interpretation of the signifi-
cant clusters. This can be related to causal statements when making
additional assumptions (see last paragraph in Section 2.1). Due to
the fact that we control for all other SNPs, often we can reduce the
number of possible confounders from hundreds or thousands of
SNPs to less than 10. Moreover, our possible confounders are desir—
able candidates, as they are usually part of the same functional unit.
This is a favorable outcome because in most cases it is unclear which
is the causal SNP, and in many contexts the gene might be the more
meaningful biological unit. Even for phenotypes with weaker and
more dispersed signal, such as BD and HT, we could still identify
larger regions. While these clusters might be too large to identify
specific genes, we can still gain insights into the joint influence of all
selected SNPs, or the distribution of the variance across the chromo—
somes. This case is the one which motivated our approach. For dis—
tant, non—disease related phenotypes it is perhaps more useful to
identify the chromosomes, or the regions that drive the signal, and
their contribution to the total explained variance. In such cases iden—
tifying single SNPs is most likely impossible, and due to their low
predictive power, not very useful.

Multivariable genome Wide association analysis

It is difficult to directly compare our results to other marginal
methods because we assign significance with respect to a generalized
multiple regression parameter, and not only for individual but also
for groups of SNPs. Nevertheless, we performed a small simulation
study in which we compared the results for our method to the stand—
ard marginal approach, as well as two mixed model algorithms. The
findings were in line with our expectations: while our method had
slightly reduced power in two of the settings, it compensated by pro—
ducing a significantly reduced number of false positive selections. In
the third design our method had the same power as the mixed model
and marginal testing approaches, while still having a superior con—
trol of the false positives.

One direction for improving the method would be to change the
clustering, which could be performed through the use of more in—
depth biological knowledge. For instance, if we would cluster the
SNPs into genes, and then into pathways, even for a weak signal we
would potentially identify larger pathways, which would be useful
in terms of biological meaning.

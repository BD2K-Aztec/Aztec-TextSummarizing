Abstract

Summary: The rapid development of CRISPR—Cas9 mediated genome editing techniques has given
rise to a number of online and stand—alone tools to find and score CRISPR sites for whole genomes.
Here we describe the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute Genome Editing database (WGE), which
uses novel methods to compute, visualize and select optimal CRISPR sites in a genome browser
environment. The WGE database currently stores single and paired CRISPR sites and pre—
calculated off—target information for CRISPRs located in the mouse and human exomes. Scoring
and display of off—target sites is simple, and intuitive, and filters can be applied to identify high—
quality CRISPR sites rapidly. WGE also provides a tool for the design and display of gene targeting
vectors in the same genome browser, along with gene models, protein translation and variation
tracks. WGE is open, extensible and can be set up to compute and present CRISPR sites for any
genome.

Availability and implementation: The WGE database is freely available at wmnN.sanger.ac.uk/htgt/

1 Introduction

CRISPR—Cas technology is a powerful tool for genome editing that
can be applied to virtually any species, from viruses to plants to
mammals (Hsu et 61]., 2014; Mali et 61]., 2013). The CRISPR—Cas
system, exemplified by Cas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes, is an
RNA—guided endonuclease that can be targeted to specific sequences
by Watson—Crick base pairing between a guide RNA (gRNA) mol-
ecule and a 20 bp target sequence adjacent to an obligate NGG pro—
tospacer adjacent motif (PAM). By replacing the first 20 bp of the
gRNA with the desired target sequence Cas9 can be re—programmed
to induce a double—stranded break at any N(20)NGG site in the gen—
ome. The Cas9 endonuclease will tolerate some mismatches in the
alignment between the gRNA and target DNA sequence and off—
target damage can occur at other sites in the genome with high
sequence similarity to the CRISPR site (Hsu et 61]., 2014). Therefore,
when designing gRNAs for genome editing, it is important to

consider potential off—target sites as well as the position of the
gRNA site within a gene.

Many web—delivered software solutions are available for choos—
ing highly specific CRISPR sites in vertebrate genomes
(Supplementary Table S1). Some require the input of target or
gRNA sequences (Bae et 61]., 2014; Hsu et 61]., 2014; http://www.
benchling.com). Others provide a basic genome browser (http://hori
zon.deskgen.com; Montague et 61]., 2014). One can be run locally
(Bae et 61]., 2014), and a few have more involved scoring schemes,
both for gRNA’s and off—targets (e.g. Heigwer et 61]., 2014; http://
www.benchling.com). Some use a heuristic short—read aligner such
as Bowtie (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012) to compute gRNA
specificity (Ma et 61]., 2013; Montague et 61]., 2014; Sander et 61].,
2010).

Here we describe WGE (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/htgt/wge). In
contrast to existing websites, WGE guides the genome editing

process using Genoverse—a fast, open and extensible genome
browser. The display of single and paired CRISPR sites is integrated
with pre—computed off—target scores and user—controlled filters. The
browser also incorporates Ensembl gene structure, available vari—
ation, protein translation and user—generated targeting construct
designs. The WGE website (Fig. 1) enables a designer to view and
consider CRISPRs in the context of the underlying genomic land-
scape. CRISPRs and targeting vector designs can be stored and
retrieved later by means of a Google login.

The WGE system is divided into four parts: the CRISPR—
Analyser software tool, the WGE database, the WGE Website and
the Vector Designer (Supplementary Fig. S1.) We have used the
WGE CRISPR—Analyser software to pre—compute genome—wide off—
target potentials of all CRISPR sites within the mouse and human
exomes, plus 200 bp of sequence. These results are stored in the
WGE database. The storage of CRISPR sites and their off—target
scores allows users to rapidly browse the genome and alter filter
criteria to select CRISPRs. Website users can also initiate real—time
off—target scoring for previously un—scored CRISPRs: the resulting
scores are stored and made available to all users. All data on the
website is accessible via an API.

Our focus is on mouse and human genomes, but the components
have been written to make the process of installing and extending to
other genomes easy. See, for example (https://github.com/coronin/
CRISPR-Analyser) which extends the CRISPR—Analyser software to
NGG and NAG—pam sites in the dog genome.

2 Methods

2.1 CRISPR—analyser: CRISPR display and scoring

The WGE CRISPR-Analyser package identifies CRISPR sites by
scanning every 23 bases of the reference genome, searching for a CC
as the first two bases (indicating a PAM site on the reverse strand)
or a GG as the final two bases (PAM site on forward strand). The
CRISPR-Analyser software also provides very fast, genome—wide
off—target CRISPR scoring (approximately 3seconds per CRISPR
site). Off—target potential is found by directly comparing the
CRISPR sequence to all other possible matches in the genome,
with up to 4 bp of mismatch. This is done very rapidly by building
an in-memory index of all CRISPR sequences (Supplementary
Information Section 2 and Supplementary Fig. 82). In contrast to
other packages (e.g. Naito et al., 2014), no other alignment software
is used. Using 80 parallel processes, we computed genome—wide
off—target scores for all CRISPR sites (PAM : NGG) in the mouse
and human exomes—including 200 bp flanks—in less than 2 weeks.
In combination with the built—in web server, the software is also
fast enough to score moderately small numbers of CRISPR sites
in real time for user—generated requests, made from the WGE
website.

2.2 WGE database and WGE website

All CRISPR sites, pre—computed and user—requested off—target
scores, as well as user—generated vector designs are stored in the
WGE Database (Supplementary Information Section 3). Bulk down-
loads of the stored CRISPR locations and off—target information are
available via the WGE website or by directly querying the WGE
database with a REST API (Supplementary Information Section 1).
The WGE website is built using Genoverse (www.genoverse.org)
and standard web development components (Supplementary
Information Section 4).

3 Results and discussion

Users enter the CRISPR—finding part of the WGE website by select—
ing a species—currently human or mouse—and the marker symbol
of the gene to inspect. They are then prompted to select a target
Ensembl exon. All possible CRISPR sites and paired sites
(Supplementary Fig. S3) are shown on a scrollable Genoverse gen—
ome browser view, which incorporates the current gene models
from Ensembl (Flicek et al., 2014), protein translation, available
variation and any user—generated targeting vector designs (see
below). ‘Paired’ CRISPR sites (Shen et al., 2014) are shown in WGE
when CRISPR sites on opposite strands have a separation of up to
30 bp, or an overlap of up to 10 bp.

Our scoring system reports the number of similar sequences in
the genome with up to four mismatches (excluding the PAM region),
summarized in a simple output string. For example, a score ‘0:1,
1:0, 2:0, 3:4, 4:56’ indicates there is 1 genomic site with 0 mis—
matches (the CRISPR site itself), no off—target sites with 1 or 2 mis-
matches, and an increasing number of potential off—target sites with
3 and 4 mismatches. By clicking on a CRISPR site, off-target infor-
mation is displayed with a link to a summary report which high-
lights the bases that differ within the off—target sequences (Fig. 1)
and reports their genomic coordinates and genomic context (inter—
genic, intron, exon). In this way, users can immediately grasp the
off—target potential for each CRISPR site.

Users can also filter CRISPR sites based on their stored off—target
characteristics (Supplementary Fig. S4). Using this interface,
hundreds of possible CRISPR sites can be narrowed down and eval—
uated to select the optimal site(s) for an editing task. WGE also
mimics other CRISPR-finding websites by allowing a user to directly
paste in genomic sequence, which is analysed rapidly to show
CRISPR sites and their pre—computed off—targets (Supplementary
Fig. 55).

WGE can be used to design PCR primers for the assembly of
gene targeting vectors by Gibson assembly (Gibson et al., 2009) or
other similar PCR—based methods. This involves first choosing a

target exon, and then adjusting design parameters via a web inter—
face to allow the primer calculations to be run (Supplementary Fig.
S6). The resulting targeting vector designs can be bookmarked,
edited, and are displayed alongside CRISPR sites in the genome
browser (Supplementary Fig. S7).

WGE provides the user with a highly visual method of rapidly
designing genome edits using CRISPRs and targeting vectors. We
plan to exploit this open and extensible platform to incorporate
more genomes as needed, efficiency—based CRISPR scoring strategies
and other useful browser tracks.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Skyline is a Windows client application for targeted
proteomics method creation and quantitative data analysis. It is
open source and freely available for academic and commercial
use. The Skyline user interface simplifies the development of
mass spectrometer methods and the analysis of data from
targeted proteomics experiments performed using selected reaction
monitoring (SRM). Skyline supports using and creating MS/MS
spectral libraries from a wide variety of sources to choose SRM
filters and verify results based on previously observed ion trap data.
Skyline exports transition lists to and imports the native output
files from Agilent, Applied Biosystems, Thermo Fisher Scientific and
Waters triple quadrupole instruments, seamlessly connecting mass
spectrometer output back to the experimental design document.
The fast and compact Skyline file format is easily shared, even
for experiments requiring many sample injections. A rich array of
graphs displays results and provides powerful tools for inspecting
data integrity as data are acquired, helping instrument operators to
identify problems early. The Skyline dynamic report designer exports
tabular data from the Skyline document model for in-depth analysis
with common statistical tools.

Availability: Single-click, self-updating web installation is available
at http://proteome.gs.washington.edu/software/skyline. This web
site also provides access to instructional videos, a support board,
an issues list and a link to the source code project.

1 INTRODUCTION

In recent years, the promise of targeted proteomics has gained
signiﬁcant attention. However, the tools for its practice have
been either limited and cumbersome or proprietary and speciﬁc
to a particular instrument vendor (Supplementary Text 1).
Skyline was explicitly designed to accelerate targeted proteomics
experimentation and foster broad sharing of both methods and results

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

across instrument platforms (Supplementary Fig. l). The software is
developed under the open source Apache 2.0 License as part of the
ProteoWizard project. An ofﬁcial public release is freely available
and currently in use in many proteomics labs, both commercial and
academic.

2 DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION

Skyline uses the MSData component of the ProteoWizard Data
Access Library (Kessner et al., 2008) to provide unprecedented
import of native output ﬁles from Agilent, Applied Biosystems,
Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc and Waters triple quadrupole instruments
(Supplementary Text 2, Fig. 2). File conversion is unnecessary,
although Skyline can also read selected reaction monitoring (SRM)
data in XML formats (Supplementary Material). This critical
requirement favored the choice of C# and Windows Forms as a
development platform, since all of the required vendor libraries
existed as Windows—only DLLs, and ProteoWizard already had a
common language infrastructure binding.

Other considerations in the choice of C# and Windows Forms
included:

0 Familiar Windows—based graphical user interface that is
intuitive to learn and use.

0 High—performance, low—latency, rich data interaction.

0 ClickOnce installation, which makes Skyline easy to install
from a web site without administrator privileges, as well as
self—updating.

° Growing availability of open source and freely available
C# software like ZedGraph, NHibernate, SQLite.NET and
DigitalRune docking windows.

The development of Skyline as a rich—client application presented the
opportunity to build classic, event—driven, document—view software
with its unique multilevel undo and redo support (Supplementary
Fig. 3). This architecture gives Skyline powerful method editing
capabilities that can easily be undone and makes it responsive in
displaying large amounts of complex graphical data. We use an
immutable tree (Okasaki, 1998) for the document model to maintain
these features while performing background processing.

2.1 Method building

Skyline provides several ways of building and editing SRM
methods. Most users establish their Skyline document by pasting
protein sequences or lists of peptides, precursors and product
ion transitions either into a dialog or directly into the document.
Transition lists and results for private and published experiments,
including MRMer (Martin et al., 2008) and CPTAC Study 7 (Addona
et al., 2009), conducted before Skyline was developed, are easily
recreated in Skyline through these mechanisms.

Peptides can also be typed into the document. A background
Proteome database, built from the FASTA formatted sequences for
an experiment’s expected protein matrix, adds further direct editing
features like auto—complete from protein description fragments,
protein names and peptide sequences (Supplementary Fig. 4).
Skyline digests proteins and fragments peptides in silico to support
direct peptide, precursor and transition picking, as well as automated
picking using ﬁlters or spectral libraries.

2.2 Spectral library support

Skyline supports reading a variety of public spectral library formats
(Supplementary Text). It also builds BiblioSpec libraries (Frewen
et al., 2006) (Supplementary Fig. 5) from the peptide search results
of many common search engines (Supplementary Text). These
custom—built libraries provide full access to library features for
peptide spectrum matches acquired in local labs as well as those
stored in repositories like PeptideAtlas (Desiere et al., 2006).

Matching spectra are shown in a graph pane with ion peak
intensity ranking expressed in both the graph and document
tree (Fig. l). Transitions matching the most intense ions can be
automatically selected, as described previously (Prakash et al.,
2009), and imported results can be compared with the spectra
for veriﬁcation of ion ratios when no labeled internal standard is
present.

2.3 Quantitation

Because of the high sensitivity and speciﬁcity of SRM, it has
been widely used for quantitative measurements using labeled
internal standards. Skyline fully supports these experiments with
dialogs for deﬁning static and heavy isotope modiﬁcations (Fig. 2)
and assigning them broadly or explicitly to individual peptides.
After importing result ﬁles, Skyline calculates ratios between the
unlabeled peptide and the labeled internal standard and provides
direct editing of integration boundaries.

2.4 Results analysis

Results analysis in Skyline begins with importing SRM mass
spectrometer ﬁles in either native or portable format. Skyline caches
them in a single high—performance data ﬁle which is usually a small
fraction of the size of the original ﬁles, can be loaded in under a
second for experiments with over 50 sample injections and simpliﬁes
sharing even complex experiments (Supplementary Fig. 6). During
cache creation, the CRAWDAD peak detector (Finney et al., 2008)
is used to calculate transition peaks which are then grouped by
precursor and stored for quick display in a chromatogram graph
pane. With enough screen resolution, Skyline can display useful
information in 10 or more graph panes simultaneously and update
them all as the selection changes without noticeable latency (Fig. 2).
Hydrophobicity scores from SSRCalc (Krohkin et al., 2004) can
be displayed in these graphs to increase conﬁdence in peptide
identiﬁcation using retention time prediction (Fig. l).

The unique Skyline custom report designer provides complete
access to the data contained in the document model, allowing
it to be ﬂexibly exported to comma separated value format
for further analysis with statistical tools like Excel and R
(Supplementary Fig. 7).

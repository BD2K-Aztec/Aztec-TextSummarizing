Abstract

Motivation: Researchers worldwide have generated a huge volume of genomic data, including thou—
sands of genome—wide association studies (GWAS) and massive amounts of gene expression data
from different tissues. How to perform a joint analysis of these data to gain new biological insights
has become a critical step in understanding the etiology of complex diseases. Due to the polygenic
architecture of complex diseases, the identification of risk genes remains challenging. Motivated
by the shared risk genes found in complex diseases and tissue—specific gene expression patterns, we
propose as an Empirical Bayes approach to integrating Eleiotropy and Tissue—§pecific information
(EPS) for prioritizing risk genes.

Results: As demonstrated by extensive simulation studies, EPS greatly improves the power of
identification for disease—risk genes. EPS enables rigorous hypothesis testing of pleiotropy and tis—
sue—specific risk gene expression patterns. All of the model parameters can be adaptively
estimated from the developed expectation—maximization (EM) algorithm. We applied EPS to the bipo—
lar disorder and schizophrenia GWAS from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, along with the gene
expression data for multiple tissues from the Genotype—Tissue Expression project. The results of the
real data analysis demonstrate many advantages of EPS.

concerns the nonzero effect of a locus on different phenotypes and
allows the effect direction to be either the same (i.e. the risk allele in-
creases the risk of two diseases) or different (i.e. the risk allele in-
creases the risk of one disease while decreases the risk of another
disease). For example, the G allele of rs6983267 increases the risk
for prostate cancer and colorectal cancer (Thomas et 61]., 2008;
Tomlinson et 61]., 2007) but the G allele of rs12720356 increases
the risk for Crohn’s disease and decreases the risk for psoriasis
(Franke et 61]., 2010, Genetic Analysis of Psoriasis Consortium and
the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium 2 and others, 2010). A
closely related but different concept is ‘genetic correlation’ (also
known as ‘co—heritability’—Cross—Disorder Group of the Psychiatric
Genomics Consortium, 2013a). This refers to the correlation between
the genetic effect sizes of two phenotypes and thus the direction of
these effects plays a role. To be clear, when referring to ‘pleiotropy’ in
this article, we adopt its original definition. We are interested in the
substantial overlap of genetic factors that underlie the multiple, seem—
ingly different phenotypes. Fortunately, more GWAS results are
becoming publicly available from GWAS repositories, such as the
GWAS—GRASP (Eicher et 61]., 2015). This offers us an unprecedented
opportunity to explore pleiotropic effects.

Besides an enormous amount of GWAS data, diverse data resources
for biological processes at different layers are also becoming available
(Civelek and Lusis, 2014). For example, the ongoing Genotype—Tissue
Expression project (GTEx) is generating a comprehensive atlas of gene
expression and regulation across multiple human tissues (Lonsdale
et 61]., 2013). This provides abundant information to quantify biolo—
gical processes that occur at the cellular level and thereby helps us to
dissect the etiology of complex diseases. Moreover, the comprehensive
gene expression data in multiple tissues may avoid the potential bias of
the ‘candidate tissue approach’. For example, in the study of obesity,
the affected tissue is fat, but the causal tissue is, in some cases, the
hypothalamus (Loos et 61]., 2008). This suggests that the integration of
GWAS data and gene expressions from multiple tissues may advance
our understanding of complex diseases.

At present, the accumulating evidence on pleiotropy (Wang et 61].,
2015; Yang et 61]., 2015) and vast, publicly available data on tissue—
specific gene expression [e.g. TiGER (Liu et 61]., 2008) and GTEx
(Moore, 2013)] require novel statistical approaches to gain a deeper
understanding of complex diseases (Ritchie et 61]., 2015). Statistical
approaches that take pleiotropy into consideration have recently be—
come very active (Solovieff et 61]., 2013), such as the conditional false
discovery rate (FDR) approach (Andreassen et 61]., 2013), and linear
mixed model—based approaches (Shriner, 2012; Zhou and Stephens,
2014). Various statistical methods have also been proposed to analyze
tissue—specific gene expression data (Gutierrez—Arcelus et 61]., 2015),
such as joint eQTL analysis in multiple tissues (Flutre et 61]., 2013)
and covariate—modulated FDR (CMFDR) (Zablocki et 61]., 2014).
More recently, a statistical approach named ‘GPA’ (Chung et 61].,
2014) was proposed to simultaneously integrate both pleiotropic in—
formation and functional annotation. Although GPA has demon—
strated a very promising direction for the integration of multiple
sources of genomic information, it does not fully account for the ef—
fects of linkage disequilibrium (LD) and only allows binary annota—
tion as its input. These disadvantages may limit its use in the
integrative analysis of large—scale genomic data.

In this article, we propose an Empirical Bayes approach to inte—
grating Pleiotropy and Tissue-Specific (EPS) information for priori-
tizing risk genes. Compared with some existing approaches (Lee
et 61]., 2015; Torres et 61]., 2014), EPS has several merits. First, EPS
only requires the summary statistics at the gene level, rather than the
genotype data at the individual level. The LD effects are carefully

accounted for when grouping the SNP—level summary statistics into
the gene level summary statistics by using reference panel data (e.g.
1000 genome data). Second, EPS is able to integrate both pleiotropy
information and gene expression data (e.g. GTEx data), which
greatly improves the power of risk gene prioritization. Third, EPS
provides rigorous hypothesis testing to evaluate the significance of
pleiotropy and tissue—specific patterns. These merits are demon—
strated via extensive simulation studies and real data analysis.

2 EPS: basic model, algorithm and inference

2.1 Basic model

Suppose we have the P—values of all SNPs from one GWAS. Instead
of working at the SNP level, we group the P—values at the SNP level
into the P—values at the gene level using VEGAS (Liu et 61]., 2010).
There are several advantages to working at the gene level. First, the
signals at the gene level are often more visible than those at the SNP
level (Li et 61]., 2011). Second, the gene itself is highly consistent
across populations, which leads to more consistent results across a
population and thus increases the replication rate (Neale and Sham,
2004). Third, it is more convenient to integrate expression data
from multiple tissues with GWAS data at the gene level. We demon—
strate these advantages in the real data analysis below.

Let us start with the simplest case. Consider P—values at the gene
level: P1,. . .,Pg,. . .,PG, where G is the number of genes. We use the
‘two—group model’ (Efron et 61]., 2008) and assume that the P—values
come from the mixture of a null and a non—null distribution, with a
probability of no and n1 : 1 — no, respectively. Let Zg : (Zg0,Zg1)
be the hidden variable indicating whether the P—value for the gth gene
is from the null or non-null group, i.e. Zgo E {0,1}, Zg1 E {0,1},
and Zgo —l— Zg1 : 1 (a gene can be either null or non-null). Here, Zgo
: 1 means that the gth gene is not associated with the trait (null) and
Zg1 : 1 means that the gth gene is associated (non—null) with the
trait. Thus, we have no : Pr(Zg0 : 1) and n1 : Pr(Zg1 : 1). Next,
we model the conditional distribution of P—values given Z as: Pg|Zg0
: 1 N “(0, 1) and Pg|Zg1 : 1 N B(oc,1), where “(0, 1) is the uniform
distribution on [0, 1], and B(oc, 1) is the Beta distribution with param—
eters or and 1, where 0 < at < 1.

For the ease of presentation, we demonstrate the model for the
case with two GWAS datasets but the generalization to more than
two GWAS datasets is straightforward. Suppose, we have P—values
from two GWAS datasets at the gene level and denote them by
P : (ng) E RGXZ, where g E {1, . . . , G} is the index for the gene
and k E {1,2} is the index for the GWAS dataset. Similar to the
aforementioned basic model, we introduce the hidden variable Zg
: (Zgoo, Zg10, Zg01,Zg11) indicating the association between the gth
gene and the two traits: Zgoo : 1 means the gth gene is associated
with neither of them, Zg10 : 1 means it is only associated with the
first trait, Zg01 : 1 means it is only associated with the second trait,
and Zg11 : 1 means it is associated with both traits. Then, we ex—
tend the two—group model to the following ‘four—group model’.

7500 = Pr(Zg00 = 1) :Pg1 NU(0,1), sz NU(0,1),
7510 = Pr(Zg10 = 1) :Pg1 N 8(061, 1), sz NU(0,1),
7601 = Pr(Zg01 = 1) I Pg1 NU(0,1), sz N 13(062, 1),

7611 = Pr(Zg11 = 1) :Pg1 N 13(061, 1), sz N 8(062, 1),

where 0 < ark < 1,/e : 1,2. Since the LD among SNPs has been
taken into account by using simulation based on the LD structure of

a set of reference individuals from 1000 genome in VEGAS2 (Liu
et al., 2010; Mishra and Macgregor, 2015 ), it is reasonable to as—
sume the independence of gene markers. Therefore, the joint distri-
bution can be written as

G G
Pr(P) = H (2 Pr(Pg|Zg))Pr(Zg )) = H (2 7thr(Pg|Zg) = 1));

g=1 leL g=1 16L
(1)

where Pg is the gth row of P and L : {00,10,01,11}.

To incorporate the gene expression from multiple tissues, we ex—
tend model (1) as follows. Suppose we obtain expressions of G genes
from T tissues and denote it by E E RGXT. Without loss of general—
ity, we assume that each of G gene expressions is normalized tissue
by tissue (in column of E) with mean equal to 0 and variance equal
to 1. Similar to the distribution of P—values, given hidden variable
Zg, we have

Eg|zg0 = 1 N N(y0,2) andEg|Zg1 = 1 N N(p1,2), (2)

where Eg is the gth row of E representing the gth gene expression
across multiple tissues, M is a length—T vector representing the mean
of gene expression across T tissues in the lth group (I E {0, 1} in the
two—group model), and )2 is a T X T covariance matrix. Note that
model (2) is very similar to linear discriminant analysis (LDA): con-
ditioning on the indicating variable Zg, Eg is normally distributed
with different mean but the same covariance. However, a fundamen—
tal difference between model (2) and LDA is that Zg is not directly
observed here, which makes our problem much more challenging.
Regarding the Gaussian distribution on gene expression data, it
is a reasonable assumption as long as gene expression data is appro—
priately normalized (Efron, 2010).

Like the way we model G gene expressions in two—group model,
we have Eg|Zgl : 1 N N(yl,2),l E L : {00, 10, 01, 11} in the four-
group model. Then, the joint distribution can be written as

G
Pr(P,E) = H (2 7thr(Zgl = 1)Pr(Pg;Eg|zg, = 1))

g=1 leL

G
= 11 (Z nzPrU’gIZgz = 1)Pr(EgIZgz = 1)), <3)
g=1 leL

where Pg and Eg are the gth row of P and E. The first equality holds
by assuming the independence among genes. The second equality
holds by assuming the independence between Pg and Eg, conditional
on Zg). The independence among genes could be a strong assump—
tion. To evaluate the impact of this assumption, we set up simula—
tion studies using the real datasets from GTEx. The details of
simulation studies are given in Section 4.1 and the Supplementary
materials.

2.2 EM algorithm

In this section, we describe an EM algorithm to estimate parameter
based on the joint model (3). Let G) collect all model parameters
as 9 = (7.5007751077501775117a17a27”007”107”017”1172) and Zgag =
1, . . . , G, be the latent variable. Then the complete likelihood can be
written as

G
Lc(®;P,E, 2) = H H(n1Pr(PgIZg1 = 1)Pr(EgIZgz = 1))Zg’. <4)
g=1 lEL

Based on the complete likelihood, the E—step and M—step in the
sth iteration of the EM algorithm involves the following
calculations.

E—step: For I E L, posterior probabilities for association of the
gth gene are obtained as

z}; = Pr(zg, = 1|P, E, 90)
n§S)Pr(Pg|zg, = 1; @(’))Pr(Eg|Zgl = 1; 9(5))

_ anf)Pr(Pg|Zgll :  9(5))Pr(Eg|Zgll :

2.3 Statistical inference

2.3.1 False discovery rate

After the parameters in the EPS model are estimated, genes can be
prioritized based on their local FDRs (Efron, 2010). For single
GWAS without incorporating gene expression, the estimated FDR
of the gth gene is the probability that the gth gene belongs to the
null group given its P—value, i.e.

ﬁoPr(Pg|Zg0 = 1; a)

Z a,Pr(Pg|zg, = 1; a)
le{0,1}

 

fdArg = Pr(Zg0 = 1|Pg; (3)) = (5)

For the joint analysis of two GWAS, we are interested in the
three estimated local FDR of the gth gene if it is claimed to be associ—
ated with the first GWAS, the second GWAS and both GWAS,
respectively.

$84 : Pr(Zg0* : 1|Pg;®)7

fd/Tgp/aare : 1 _ Pr(Zg11 : lngi 9): 

where Zg0* = goo + Zg01, Zg*0 = Zgoo + Zg10, and Pg 18 the gth
row of the P—value matrix P. To incorporate gene expression from
multiple tissues, the estimated local FDRs are given as

where Eg is the gth row of expression matrix E. Based on the known
relationship between local FDR and global FDR (Efron, 2010), we
can easily convert the estimated local FDR to global FDR using

$181?qung 3 K]

impr=f%f———————sr, <&

where K is a pre—specified threshold for local FDR, function  is
the indicator function which returns 1 if the argument is true, 0
otherwise, and the resulting global FDR is smaller than I. By doing
so, it is convenient for users to control FDR either in terms of global
FDR or local FDR.

2.3.2 Hypothesis testing of risk genes differentially expressed in a
tissue-specific manner

It is also very important to test whether the risk genes are differen-
tially expressed in a tissue—specific manner, which offers us more
biological insights on etiology of complex diseases. First, we con—
sider evaluating whether the risk genes from a single GWAS are dif-
ferentially expressed in the tth tissue. Let go), and 1117, be the mean
expression values of genes from the null and non-null groups, re-
spectively. Whether goat and 1117, are significantly different from each
other can be evaluated via the following hypothesis testing:

HP=w.=m,wmmHPzw,#uu. @)

The likelihood ratio test (LRT) statistic is given by
A“) = 2 <10gPr(P, E,; (3)) — logPr(P, E,; (650)),

where P is the P—value vector of one GWAS, E; is the standardized
gene expression from the tth tissue, 9);) is the parameter estimates
obtained under the H0 and its superscript t indicates the tth tissue.
Based on the asymptotical theory (Van der Vaart, 2000), the test
statistic A“) asymptotically follows the 1&le under the null. This hy-
pothesis testing allows us to evaluate whether risk genes are differen-
tially expressed in a specific tissue. In such a way, we can marginally
scan all tissues one at a time.

When there are two GWAS, the null hypothesis of testing with
respect to the tth tissue can be naturally extended as follows:

H8” 3 #00,: = #10): = #01,: = M11,t- (10)

The LRT test statistic asymptotically follows the Xﬁf23 under the
null.

2.3.3 Hypothesis testing of pleiotropy

It is of great interest to test pleiotropy between two different traits/
diseases. Based on the definition of pleiotropy, we are interested in
whether there exists a significant overlapped genetic factor that
underlies the two phenotypes. Under the null, there is no pleiotropy,
i.e. the proportion of shared genes in two GWAS is independent of
each other. Statistically, this can be evaluated by testing whether the

joint probability of {Zg00, Zg10, Zg01,Zg11} equals to the product of
their marginal probability:

H017I11 = maﬁa V-S-H1 17m 75 “Lima, (11)

where m... 2 me + an and m1 = n01 + R11 are the marginal prob-
ability. Clearly, this hypothesis test can be done via the LRT, and
the test statistic is given as

NP) 2 2 <10gPr(P; (3)) — logPr(P; (3)),1’ ))), (12)

where the superscript (P) indicates that the test aims at evaluating
pleiotropy and (3)813) is the parameter estimates obtained under H0.
Under the null, the test statistic A03) asymptotically follows )(2 distri—
bution with df = 1, denoted as Xﬁle.

2.3.4 Empirical null for inﬂated P—Values

In the case that the P—values are inflated, it is inappropriate to as—
sume that the P—values from null group follow Uniform distribution
on [0, 1] (Schwartzman, 2008). Alternatively, we may use Pg|Zg0
: 1 N B(ocnu11, 1) to accommodate the inflation. The parameters ocnuu
in null distribution can be estimated using P—values close to 1, e.g. P—
value 2 0.5. Then we use B(ocnu11, 1) to replace Z/{[0, 1] as the null dis-
tribution and keep ocnuu unchanged during the EM updates. The
strategy adopted here is similar to the one in the previous models (1)
and (3) using the empirical null.

3 Extended model

3.1 Integrating a large number of tissues

If a large number of tissues are involved for gene expressions, the
proposed model may not be appropriate because the number of par—
ameters in )2 increases quadratically with respect to the number of
tissues T (see Equation (2)). To overcome this difficulty, we propose
a stage—wise approach when T is large, where penalized LDA is used
to regularize our model.

In this section, we describe this stage—wise approach. Let us begin
with a single—GWAS analysis, with the extension to a joint analysis
straightforward.

We fit the model only with the P—value vector P from one GWAS
and obtain the first—stage posterior probability for all G genes:

2: [z1;zz;...;zG] ERG><2

, where 2g 2 (zgo,zg1),g = 1,... ,G.

Treating the first—stage posterior probability 2 as a response ma—
trix, we use the penalized LDA (Witten and Tibshirani, 2011) to
find a sparse linear discriminant vector, denoted as B E RT, to sep—
arate the null (zgjo) and non-null (zg71) group. The purpose here is to
use a sparse discriminant vector to select the most useful tissue types
and reduce the effects of irrelevant tissues. Using the discriminant
vector B, we can update the gene expression based on the sparse
projection as E : EB E RC. The details of our modified LDA are
given in the following section.

We fit model (4) using E, a sparse compression of gene expres—
sion, to replace the original high-dimensional gene expression E
E RG><T (T is large), and then compute the second—stage posterior
probability with Pg, 131g as Pr(zg, = 1 (Pg, 13,), 1 6 {0,1}.

To extend the model to the joint analysis of two—GWAS, we
need to find three sparse projection vectors B E RTX" because there
are four groups L E {00, 10, 01, 11}. As a result, E : EB is a G X 3
matrix. In this case, it is still applied to fit the model (4) using E to
replace E.

3.2 Penalized LDA
We need to modify penalized LDA proposed by Witten and
Tibshirani (2011) because here we only have the first—stage posterior
probability (zg) of each gene from the null and non-null groups with
no knowledge of its exact group membership.

Taking this uncertainty into account, the within—class covariance
matrix 2W is estimated using the first—stage posterior probability:

A 1 G A A
2w =  Zzgl(Eg _ ﬂl)(Eg _ “If:
g=1 lEL

where [1, is the sample mean in the lth group:
A 1
“I : E Z zglEg.
g

Similarly, the between—class covariance matrix can be estimated
as

A 1
)2), : —ETz(sz)_1zTE.
n
The remaining part is the same as the original paper (Witten and
Tibshirani, 2011). For completeness, we describe more technical de—

tails of penalized LDA in the Supplementary materials.

4 Results

4.1 Simulation

In this section, we report the simulation results to evaluate the per—
formance of the model. We generated a gene expression matrix E
E RGXT for G genes from T tissues, where each entry of E was from
the standard normal distribution. Let yg : Egb —1— 6g be the latent
variable controlling the membership of the gth gene, where b
E RTX1 is the effect sizes of genes from T tissues, Eg is the gth row of
E, and 6g is the random noise, g = 1, . . . , G. After generating yg, we
dichotomized the G genes into the null and non—null groups using a
probit model. Denote the proportions of the null and non-null genes
of both GWAS as no and m, respectively. The P—values for the first
GWAS were simulated as:

Pgallyg N 803(1)   2 617:0,

. (13)
Pgallyg Nu(071)7 1f3’g < 61710;

where 617,0 (no : 0.8 and 0.9) is the quantile of interest. To simulate
the P—values of the second GWAS, we took pleiotropy between two
GWAS into account. Specifically, we used 0 g y g 1 to control the
number of genes with pleiotropic effects as G7I1(7t1 —1— Mo). When
1» = 0, the number of genes shared by two GWAS equals an which

Test at p in pint model

is exactly the shared proportion when the two GWAS are independ—
ent of each other. When 1» = 1, the number of risk genes shared by
two GWAS equals Gm, i.e. all of the risk genes are shared by the
two GWAS. The risk genes of the second GWAS were randomly se—
lected such that the total number of genes with pleiotropic effects
was G7I1(7t1 —1— Mo) (note that the total proportion of risk genes in
the second GWAS was kept to R1 for simplicity). After the group
membership was generated for each gene, the P—values of the second
GWAS were simulated from B(oc2, 1) and LI (0, 1) for risk genes and
null genes, respectively.

First, we evaluated the type I errors of testing tissue—specific differ—
ential expression in a separate—GWAS analysis (9) and a joint—GWAS
analysis (10), and the type I errors of testing pleiotropy (11). In this
simulation, we set the number of genes G = 20 000, the number of tis—
sues T: 5, the effect size b = 0, and the pleiotropy controlling param-
eter y = 0. For simplicity, we chose 1x1 : 012 = or E {0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6}
(the smaller or, the stronger GWAS signals) and no E {0.8, 0.9}. For
each parameter setting, we ran the EPS 500 times. The experimental
results are shown in Figure 1. Clearly, all type I errors were well con—
trolled at the nominal level (P = 0.05 ). We noticed that the test of plei—
otropy was underpower when the GWAS signal was weak (e.g.
or 2 0.5) and the proportion of risk genes was small (e.g. n1 2 0.9).
More detailed information on these three tests is summarized in the
QQ-plots in Supplementary Figures S1 and S2.

Next, we conducted a simulation to evaluate the power of the pro—
posed method. We started with a small number of tissues, i.e. T: 5.
We simulated yg : Egb —1— 6g, where the variance of ﬁg was specified
such that the signal—to—noise ratio (SNR) was controlled at around 2
(note that the SNR is defined as W). We varied y to
check the inﬂuence of pleiotropy on the performance of gene priori-
tization. To quantitatively evaluate the performance of EPS, we calcu—
lated the area under the curve (AUC) and the power with the global
FDR controlled at 0.2. The results are shown in Figure 2. Comparing
the red boxplots (separate—GWAS analysis with gene expression) with
the blue ones (separate—GWAS analysis without gene expression), we
observed a clear improvement after incorporating informative gene ex-
pression data from T tissues. The benefit of integrating pleiotropy was
also confirmed by comparing the green boxplots (joint—GWAS analysis
without gene expression) with the blue ones (separate—GWAS analysis
without gene expression). Integrating both pleiotropy and gene expres—
sion from multiple tissues further improved the performance of EPS,
as indicated by the yellow boxplots (joint—GWAS analysis with gene
expression). However, there are two remaining concerns: how are the
results of the joint analysis affected when there is no pleiotropy, and
how is the analysis affected when all of the incorporated tissues are
non-informative? For the first concern, as shown in Figure 2, the 0th
analysis in EPS showed comparable performance with a separate

analysis in the absence of pleiotropy (y = 0), suggesting that EPS can
adapt to available pleiotropic information and avoid overfitting.
To address the second concern, we performed a simulation study in
which all of the tissues were non—information. As shown in
Supplementary Figure S3, EPS performed robustly when a small num-
ber of non-informative gene expressions were incorporated into the
analysis.

As observed in Fan and Fan (2008), inclusion of too many non-
informative variables will generate too much noise, and thus de—
grade the performance. In such a case, we advocate using
the extended model (Section 3), which uses penalized LDA to adap—
tively remove irrelevant tissues. To evaluate the performance of the
extended model, we simulated gene expression from T: 100 tissues,
only five of which were informative. The simulation results
(Supplementary Fig. S4) suggest that the extended model performed
very well for gene prioritization, even when most of the issues
were non-informative. In addition to performance comparison, we

investigated the accuracy of parameter estimation. These results are
shown in Supplementary Figures S5 and S6. We compared EPS with
CMFDR, which was designed to integrate one GWAS with func—
tional annotation. The results shown in the left panel of
Supplementary Figure S7 demonstrate that EPS performs better than
CMFDR in terms of the AUC (top panel of Supplementary Fig. S7).
CMFDR seems to have a greater power (middle panel of
Supplementary Fig. S7), but it suffers from an uncontrolled FDR
(lower panel of Supplementary Fig. S7).

Another issue with integrating multiple GWAS is the overlap of
control samples. Although we did not take this issue into account in
our analysis, we investigated its potential effects on EPS using simu—
lation studies. The empirical results (shown in Supplementary Fig.
S8) indicate that the FDR of EPS is indeed inﬂated in some extreme
cases, but the inﬂation is small or moderate for the majority of cases
(the true FDR is 0.3 where nominal FDR is 0.2). We plan to address
this limitation in our future work.

4.2 Analysis of schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar
disorder (BPD) with the GTEx data

In this section, we applied EPS to the analysis of BPD and SCZ.
Previous studies have shown that BPD and SCZ share some common
polygenic variation and susceptibility genes (Maier et al., 2006;
Purcell et al., 2009). Therefore, it is ideal to jointly analyze BPD and
SCZ by considering the pleiotropy between them. Detailed informa-
tion about these GWAS is provided in Cross—Disorder Group of the
Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (2013b). We downloaded the
summary statistics for BPD and SCZ from the Psychiatric Genomics
Consortium (PGC) website. There are 1 233 533 and 1 237 959
SNPs reported in the PGC GWAS for BPD and SCZ, respectively.
We took the intersection of these available SNPs and obtained
1 219 805 overlapping SNPs and their P—values. As all of the sam—
ples are of European ancestry, we used VEGAS2 (Liu et al., 2010;
Mishra and Macgregor, 2015) to combine P—values at the SNP level
and obtained 17 763 P—values at the gene level, where 379 European
ancestry samples in 1000 genome data served as the reference panel
in the VEGAS method.

The GTEx (Lonsdale et al., 2013) provides an up—to—date re—
source for the gene expression data in multiple tissues (http://www.
gtexportal.org/home/). As of April 2015, the gene expression data
for 53 tissues from 2921 samples were available on GTEx. As the
sample sizes of some tissues may have been too small to provide reli—
able analysis results, we only considered the tissues that had at least
16 samples. We collected gene expression data from 46 tissues for
analysis. For each tissue, there were 25 208 gene Ensembl IDs. We
matched these genes with the list of genes from the output of
VEGAS, and ended up with gene expression data for 13 815 genes
from 46 tissues and their P—values from SCZ and BPD at the gene
level. We further performed quantile normalization of the gene ex-
pression data. In practice, the expression of genes may not be inde—
pendent, i.e. the rows of matrix E could be correlated. Because
independence among genes is assumed in EPS, we performed add—
itional simulation studies to evaluate the type I errors using this real
data. The results shown in Supplementary Figures S7 and S8 indicate
that EPS performed robustly in the presence of a correlation.

Next, we checked the distribution of the P—values from VEGAS
and found that these gene—level P—values were inﬂated for both SCZ
and BPD (the QQ—plots of these P—values are shown in
Supplementary Fig. S9). Therefore, we chose to use the empirical
null for the null distribution as described in Section 2.3.4. The par—
ameters anuus were estimated to be 0.72 and 0.80 for SCZ and BPD,
respectively.

To identify tissue—specific—enrichment patterns of a complex trait,
we applied EPS to integrate multiple tissues with their P—values from
GWAS and then evaluated whether risk genes were differentially ex-
pressed in a tissue—specific manner. We performed this analysis for all
46 tissues using hypothesis testing (9) (a complete list of the test results
is given in Supplementary Table S1). The test results suggested that the
risk genes for BPD are differentially expressed in brain—cerebellar hemi-
sphere and brain—cerebellum. Although a number of studies have sug—
gested that the cerebellum plays a critical role in emotion processing
(Hoppenbrouwers et al., 2008), its importance in BPD is still uncertain
(DelBello et al., 1999; Mills et al., 2005). A recent study based on
quantitative T1p mapping (Johnson et al., 2015 ) investigated brain
abnormalities in BPD and highlighted the critical role of the cerebellum
in BPD, which is consistent with the result of our analysis. The risk
genes for SCZ also showed differential expression in adrenal-gland, pi-
tuitary, EBV—ETL cells, spleen, testis and whole—blood, in addition to
the brain cerebellum regions. The significance in both the adrenal—gland

and pituitary supports the important role of the hypothalamic—pituit—
ary—adrenal axis function in SCZ (Walker et al., 2008). The evidence
that differential expression of SCZ risk genes in ‘Cell—EBV—ETL’ sup-
ports the recently discovered link between SCZ and the immune system
(Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics
Consortium, 2014). Although the biological explanation of the differ-
entially expressed genes in the spleen, testis and whole blood remains
elusive, our method suggests that they warrant significant consider—
ation. We brieﬂy explain the reason for this in the next paragraph
where we discuss the gene prioritization results of our method.

The gene prioritization results with or without the inclusion of
gene expression data are summarized using Manhattan plots in
Figure 3. To control false positive findings, we use the local FDR g
0.1 as the criterion to report risk genes in the remainder of this section
[the threshold for the local FDR, set at 0.1, is more stringent than the
default setting of 0.2 in the classical local-FDR approach (Efron,
2010) (also see the ‘locfdr’ R package). In fact, setting the threshold
for the local FDR at 0.1 often leads to a global FDR of around 0.05
(Efron, 2010)]. Without gene expression, EPS identified the same nine
risk genes for both SCZ and BPD (see Supplementary Table S2 for de—
tails). For example, EPS identified two genes at 6p21-p22.1: NKAPL
and PGBDI. These two genes have been identified as SCZ—risk genes
in the Han Chinese population (Yue et al., 2011). In this Han Chinese
population, rs2142731 is the most significant variant in PGBDI,
while its P—value is 0.7387 based on the PGC samples from European
ancestry. Similarly, the P—value of rs1635 in an exon of NKAPL is
6.91 x 10‘12 in the Han Chinese population, while its P—value is
0.7866 in the PGC samples. As genetic variants may have different al-
lele frequencies and LD structures across different populations, it is
difficult to replicate GWAS findings at the SNP level. However, genes
can be highly consistent across ancestry (Neale and Sham, 2004).
Here, EPS made use of the P—value at the gene level and successfully

replicated these findings. According to the GTEx data, PGBD1 had a
relatively high expression in the brain—cerebellum and brain—cortex,
suggesting that PGBD1 may be more active in the brain than in other
tissues. Another risk gene NKAPL had a relatively high expression in
the testis, which explained why EPS detected some differentially
expressed genes in the testis. These tissue—specific expression patterns
of PGBD1 and NKAPL are shown in Supplementary Figures S10
and S11.

When incorporating the gene expression data into our analysis,
we did not use only the gene expression data from the significant tis-
sues because using data twice may lead to a selection bias
(Tibshirani and Efron, 2002). Instead, we incorporated the gene ex—
pression data from all tissues, and performed the analysis using
penalized LDA as discussed in Section 3.2. The EPS results suggest
that the gene FLOT1 may be a risk gene for SCZ, but not for BPD,
which is consistent with a very recent large sample study
(Andreassen et al., 2015 ). In fact, the GTEx data suggest that
FLOT1 is highly expressed not only in the blood, but also in ad—
renal-gland, indicating that FLOT1 may be related to the function—
ing of the hypothalamic—pituitary—adrenal axis.

To demonstrate the possible benefits of leveraging the pleiotropic
effects among different traits, we compared the separate GWAS ana—
lysis and the joint SCZ—BPD analysis without incorporating gene ex—
pression. In the joint analysis, EPS detected strong pleiotropy between
SCZ and BPD, as indicated by the P—value < 1 x 10‘3’0 [the estimated
proportions are itoo : 0.972, 1110 = 0.001, 7101 = 0.001 and
7111 = 0.026, then the test statistic (12) equals 209.35]. Leveraging the
pleiotropic effects enabled EPS to identify many more risk genes than
the separate analyses of SCZ and BPD, as shown in Supplementary
Table S2. For example, the identification of the gene CACNA1 C in the
joint analysis is consistent with a recent GWAS with a larger sample
size (Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics
Consortium, 2014) and a study using the conditional FDR (Andreassen
et al., 2013). The gene CACNA1 C, which encodes an alpha—1 subunit
of a voltage—dependent calcium channel, has played an important role
in the development of calcium antagonist drugs. As reported in
Solovieff et al. (2013), this finding has been highlighted in clinical trials
of calcium antagonist drugs, which are potentially effective in the treat—
ment of psychiatric disorders.

Finally, we performed an integrative analysis of BPD—SCZ with
the gene expression data from all tissues. As shown in
Supplementary Table S2, the incorporation of the gene expression
data enhanced the association signals of some genes. For example,
FNDC4 and NT5DC2 were observed to be highly expressed in ad—
renal—gland, based on the GTEx data (Supplementary Figs S10 and
S11). EPS also indicated that SCZ and BPD risk genes tend to be dif—
ferentially expressed in the adrenal—gland. Combining all of these
pieces of evidence, the strength of association between FNDC4 and
NT5DC2 was adaptively enhanced by EPS. The association signals
may also be weakened after incorporating gene expression data into
the analysis. For example, HISTIHZBN is non-significant with a
local FDR g 0.1 because its expression levels are very low in all of
the tissues from the GTEx data. To the best of our knowledge, there
is no strong evidence that HISTIHZBN is a risk gene for SCZ or
BPD. By incorporating gene expression data, EPS was able to reduce
the association strength and possibly avoid a false positive finding.

5 Conclusion

We have presented a statistical approach, named EPS, that can inte—
grate pleiotropy information from GWAS data and tissue—specific
gene expression data. Compared with some existing approaches,

such as linear mixed models, which require genotype data at the in—
dividual level, EPS only requires summary statistics for analysis.
More importantly, EPS provides statistically rigorous evaluations of
tissue—specific gene expression patterns and pleiotropic effects via
hypothesis testing. These merits make EPS an attractive and effective
tool for the integrative analysis of GWAS data with gene expression
data from multiple tissues. Despite the promising statistical im—
provements we have made, the biological implications need to be in—
dependently replicated. One limitation of EPS is that it does not take
into account overlapping samples. Addressing this issue in integrat—
ing multiple GWAS is an important area for future work.

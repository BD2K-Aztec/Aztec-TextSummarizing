ABSTRACT

Summary: Bisulfite sequencing allows cytosine methylation, an
important epigenetic marker, to be detected via nucleotide
substitutions. Since the Applied Biosystems SOLiD System uses a
unique di-base encoding that increases confidence in the detection
of nucleotide substitutions, it is a potentially advantageous platform
for this application. However, the di-base encoding also makes reads
with many nucleotide substitutions difficult to align to a reference
sequence with existing tools, preventing the platform’s potential
utility for bisulfite sequencing from being realized. Here, we present
SOCS-B, a reference-based, un-gapped alignment algorithm for the
SOLiD System that is tolerant of both bisulfite-induced nucleotide
substitutions and a parametric number of sequencing errors,
facilitating bisulfite sequencing on this platform. An implementation
of the algorithm has been integrated with the previously reported
SOCS alignment tool, and was used to align CpG methylation-
enriched Arabidopsis thaliana bisulfite sequence data, exhibiting
a 2-fold increase in sensitivity compared to existing methods for
aligning SOLiD bisulfite data.

Cytosine methylation is a major epigenetic marker in eukaryotes,
performing functions such as transcriptional regulation and
transposon silencing. It is now possible to create genome-wide
maps of this type of DNA modiﬁcation at single-nucleotide
resolution using a technique termed bisulﬁte sequencing, or BS-Seq.
The method utilizes high-throughput sequencing technologies
in conjunction with selective nucleotide substitutions. These
substitutions are induced by bisulﬁte, which converts cytosine
residues to uracil residues, but occurs at a much slower rate for
5-methylcytosine (the most common type of methylated cytosine).
After an appropriate amount of bisulﬁte treatment and subsequent
PCR ampliﬁcation, 5-methycyt0sine residues will be represented by

cytosine (or guanine on the complementary strand) and cytosine
residues by thymine (or adenine on the complementary strand).
By sequencing the converted DNA and aligning with a reference
sequence, methylation can be inferred from these substitutions
(Frommer et al., 1992).

While any sequencing method can be employed for BS-Seq,
the Applied Biosystems SOLiD System is attractive for this
application because it is designed around the reliable detection
of nucleotide substitutions. This reliability arises not from the
absence of sequencing errors, but from the ability to discern most
of them from true substitutions. The system achieves this by
querying overlapping dinucleotides rather than single nucleotides,
such that each nucleotide of each read is ultimately queried by two
independent ligation events. The caveat is that each dinucleotide is
reported as a color that could represent any of the four dinucleotides,
and alignment must be performed using these colors (in ‘color-
space’) in order for sequencing errors to be distinguished. In
color-space, a nucleotide substitution appears as a speciﬁc pattern
of two adjacent color-space mismatches. This increased divergence
is not a major problem for applications in which reads will typically
only contain one nucleotide substitution, such as single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) detection. However, in BS-Seq, bisulﬁte-
induced nucleotide substitutions (BINS) are ubiquitous, causing
most reads to contain too many color-space mismatches relative to
the reference sequence to be aligned using the standard color-space
alignment tools.

There are ways to avoid this issue and align a portion of the
reads with standard tools. One is to create reference sequences that
represent the original sequence and complete bisulﬁte conversion
of both the Watson and Crick strands of the sequence, as done in
previous bisulﬁte experiments (Lister et al. , 2008). Reads can then be
aligned using existing SOLiD alignment tools. The problem with this
approach is that reads containing both methylated and unmethylated
cytosines could contain numerous color-space mismatches against
either reference sequence. Since areas such as CpG islands are dense
with potential methylation sites, many reads that are of particular
interest would not be aligned within realistic error tolerances.
The other possible method is to convert SOLiD reads from their
di-nucleotide encoding into nucleotide strings. The reads can then
be aligned with an existing tool that is tolerant of BINS, such as
the one developed by Cokus et al. (2008). The issue here is that
the conversion process assumes the absence of sequencing errors,

causing the majority of the reads to be converted incorrectly. Both of
these methods ignore much of the information contained in SOLiD
output, and thus do not realize the potential of this platform for
BS-Seq. Ideally, an alignment tool for this application should be
tolerant of BINS as well as some sequencing errors.

Here, we present SOCS-B, an alignment algorithm tolerant of both
bisulﬁte-induced nucleotide substitutions and SOLiD sequencing
errors, facilitating BS-Seq using the SOLiD system. The algorithm
is based on the iterative version of the Rabin—Karp algorithm that is
the foundation of SOCS (Karp and Rabin, 1987; Ondov et al. , 2008).
The ﬁrst phase of the algorithm is the creation of a hash table to index
potential matches, drastically paring the number of alignments to be
performed. The second phase is the assessment of these potential
matches by comparison of the color-space sequence of the reads to
the color-space sequence of the reference. Both phases of SOCS-B
are tolerant of both BINS and sequencing errors. Hashes are created
by ﬁrst translating the color-space reads into nucleotide sequences.
To account for the translational effects of sequencing errors, four
translations are computed, starting from all four nucleotides (rather
than just the terminal primer base provided with the read). Then
substrings of all four translations are used to generate partial hashes,
which are analogous to seeds. This ensures that the partial hashes
based on the correct translations are represented in the hash table,
regardless of any sequencing errors that occurred earlier in the
reads. A reduced representation of the translated nucleotides, which
treats cytosine and thymine as the same symbol, is enumerated in
ternary to form each partial hash. To assess the quality of each
potential alignment discovered in the hash table, BINS must be
distinguished from sequencing errors. Since the validity of a color-
space mismatch depends on whether neighboring colors have been
attributed to BINS, SOCS-B uses a dynamic programming table to
compute the most probable methylation state for each cytosine based
on the quality scores for each color (Supplementary Fig. S1). The
number and positions of errors follow from this information. If the
optimal translation has fewer than a user-speciﬁed number of color-
space mismatches against the reference sequence, the alignment is
kept until the algorithm completes or a more probable alignment is
found.

SOCS-B was tested on 54 705 478 50-color reads produced with a
SOLiD 3 Plus system from bisulﬁte-converted Arabidopsis thaliana
genomic DNA that had been pre-enriched for CpG methylation by
methyl—binding domain afﬁnity chromatography and spiked with
phage lambda DNA (to measure bisulﬁte conversion efﬁciency).
As a control, the reads were ﬁrst aligned using the alignment
tool provided by Applied Biosystems (mapreads) against reference
sequences representing the fully bisulﬁte converted Watson and
Crick strands and the unconverted Watson strands of A. thaliana
and phage lambda. This approach is analogous to that employed by
previous BS-Seq studies (Lister et al., 2008). Alignment was then
performed against only the unconverted genomes using SOCS-B,
which exhibited a 2-fold increase in total sensitivity for reads with
three or fewer errors (Table 1). Using reads that uniquely aligned
to the lambda genome, the bisulﬁte conversion rate was estimated
to be 99%, indicating that the increase in sensitivity (and thus
the abundance of heterogeneously converted reads) was due to

complex methylation patterns, rather than incomplete conversion.
Furthermore, since the most biologically relevant methylation sites
in the genome occur in dense clusters, it seems possible that the
additional reads aligned by SOCS-B might be of more biological
signiﬁcance than those aligned with mapreads. Because of the
algorithm’s inherent lack of bias, SOCS-B also showed increased
speciﬁcity when aligning simulated reads (Supplementary Table S2).
SOCS-B alignment took 30h using an Apple Mac Pro
(dual 2.93 GHz Quad-Core Intel Xeon with hyper—threading,
32 GB RAM). Since color-space errors are fairly abundant in SOLiD
reads, more reads can be aligned by allowing more mismatches,
either at the expense of run time (by increasing the sensitivity)
or of speciﬁcity (by increasing the tolerance). For larger reference
genomes or datasets, or for higher error sensitivity, SOCS has
features that facilitate distributed processing. Executable versions,
source code, sample datasets, and usage instructions are available at

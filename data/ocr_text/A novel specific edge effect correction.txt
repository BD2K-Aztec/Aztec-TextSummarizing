ABSTRACT

Motivation: High-throughput screening (HTS) is an important
method in drug discovery in which the activities of a large number
of candidate chemicals or genetic materials are rapidly evaluated.
Data are usually obtained by measurements on samples in microwell
plates and are often subjected to artefacts that can bias the
result selection. We report here a novel edge effect correction
algorithm suitable for RNA interference (RNAi) screening, because
its normalization does not rely on the entire dataset and takes into
account the specificities of such a screening process. The proposed
method is able to estimate the edge effects for each assay plate
individually using the data from a single control column based on
diffusion model, and thus targeting a specific but recurrent well-
known HTS artefact. This method was first developed and validated
using control plates and was then applied to the correction of
experimental data generated during a genome-wide siRNA screen
aimed at studying HIV—host interactions. The proposed algorithm
was able to correct the edge effect biasing the control data and thus
improve assay quality and, consequently, the hit-selection step.

1 INTRODUCTION

In high—throughput screening (HTS) campaign, although most
repetitive errors can be controlled, some biases, such as edge effects
(also called border effects), which appear after a long incubation
period, cannot easily be corrected due to well—to—well discrepancies
inherent in the spatial structure of each plate. In these cases, a
number of post—screening correction methods have been developed
to normalize the data and are currently applied to small molecule—

based screens. Recently, the emergence of genome—wide RNA
interference (RNAi) HTS has raised experimental complications
such as the requirement for more incubation time than compound—
based screens. However, because of the speciﬁcity of the small
interfering RNA (siRNA) library format and the diversity of
phenotypes induced after siRNA treatment, the classical methods
developed for post—processing in compound screens cannot be
efﬁciently implemented in RNAi screens. Within this framework,
the relevance of the positive results, or ‘hits’, is highly linked to the
consistency of each test within the complete screening campaign
(Shun et al., 2011). Thus, every experimental parameter is a potential
source of variation and can lower the accuracy of the entire screen.
Consequently, the entire process must be designed to maximize the
similarity between each individual experiment. In such a context,
each spatial or time—dependent dissimilarity can also be considered
to be a possible source of response variability. The most widely used
platform for biological experiments in HTS is the microtitre plate
(hereinafter referred to simply as ‘plate’); it is basically a rectangular
rigid support containing an array of wells, each containing a single
experiment. This type of support displays intrinsic heterogeneity in
its spatial design: each well has a unique physical location, making it
different from the others in terms of its immediate neighbours. Thus,
the surrounding properties of a given well can have consequences
for its response (usually a cellular phenotype) in the biological
experiment; this is especially true for wells that are located at the
border of the plate. Therefore, this locational variability can cause
a differential in response across the plate. In practice, location—
dependent variations in observed phenotypes can be due to many
physical causes such as temperature and evaporation differences,
inhomogeneous cell or agent dispensing, cross—contamination or
plate—reader edge effects (Hser, 2006; Makarenkov et al., 2007).

In many applications, these factors are either neglected or
prevented by the use of speciﬁc countermeasures (Lundholt et al.,
2003). Nevertheless, because of the expense and technology
involved in a screening campaign, such preventive measures are
not always feasible or applicable. In these cases, post—correction of
the data is mandatory.

In compound—based screening, methods for correcting spatial
patterns of variation in plate responses have been widely studied
and described in the literature (Brideau et al., 2003; Dragiev et al.,
2011; Heyse, 2002; Kevorkov and Makarenkov, 2005; Makarenkov
et al., 2006, 2007; Malo et al., 2006). These methodologies rely

on several main assumptions that are usually justiﬁed in a standard
compound—based screening:

0 the difference between a positive and a negative response is
obvious (in an uncorrupted case); and

0 the positive responses are sparse and rare.

In some cases, it can also be assumed that the artefact occurs on a
large number of plates. In this case, the correction process is well
established. Indeed, considering hits to be impulsive noise, a simple
plate data average directly describes the trend and consequently
leads to an accurate evaluation of the trend. A simple correction
process allows for a practical correction of the biased data.

If the hypothesis of a reproducible artefact throughout the plate set
is not fulﬁlled, it is still possible to apply a plate—to—plate correction
algorithm, such as those reported in (Birmingham et al., 2009;
Brideau et al., 2003; Heyse, 2002; Kevorkov and Makarenkov, 2005;
Makarenkov et al., 2006, 2007; Malo et al., 2006). These algorithms
can be classiﬁed into two different methods: global and local.

In the global methodology, the background is ﬁtted with a simple
parametric function (usually a low—order polynomial), with the
function considered to yield accurate bias modelling (Kevorkov and
Makarenkov, 2005). With such an approach, the relevance of the
model is crucial, and the function parameters should therefore be
carefully chosen. Indeed, on one hand, too simple a function is
unable to accurately model the spatial bias, leading to an inadequate
correction, whereas on the other, a too—complex function can induce
an overﬁt of the signal, raising the risk of the loss of true positive
events. However, such approaches are well suited for smooth and
well—deﬁned spatial bias such as row, column and bowl—shaped
effects as described in (Zhang, 2011).

With the local approach, the 2D signal deﬁned by the plate spatial
responses is denoised using limited—size kernel ﬁltering, such as the
non—linear median method (Brideau et al., 2003; Malo et al., 2006).
In this situation, the sparsity of hits and the high signal—to—noise ratio
of the positive versus negative controls are of primary importance.
Indeed, this denoising methodology is based on the assumption of
impulsive noise corruption and can thus generate artefacts when this
assumption is not realistic.

Recently, in addition to traditional compound—based screening,
commercially available genome—wide libraries of chemically
synthesized siRNAs have enabled the emergence of RNAi HTS.
RNAi using siRNA has become the gold standard method for loss—of—
function studies in a variety of organisms. Compared to compound
screening, one difference in siRNA—based screening is the extended
incubation. Typically, the cells are ﬁrst transfected with siRNA
using a lipofectant compound and then incubated for 48—96 h before
the phenotypic assay. Thus, when compared to small—compound
screening, these two to four additional days of incubation required
for an efﬁcient knockdown of protein expression are likely to
exacerbate experimental bias and cause additional artefacts. Indeed,
long incubation periods combined with low—volume wells create
ideal conditions for inconsistency.

The normalization methods developed for compound screening
mentioned above are not applicable to siRNA—based screening, as
the basic hypotheses on which these methods rely on cannot be
veriﬁed (Birmingham et al., 2009; Zhang, 2008). First, commercial
siRNA libraries are clustered in most cases, and hits should therefore
not be randomly distributed. Indeed, siRNA libraries are organized

into sublibraries (e. g. kinases, phosphatases and GPCR), and siRNA
experiments targeting the same pathway or the different subunits
of a given heterodimer will have similar well contents in the same
vicinity. Hence, positive events should appear in a clustered fashion,
rejecting the main hypothesis that hits are rare, isolated events.
Secondly, as opposed to compound screens, where most compound
have no effect on cells, therefore the distribution of their readout
can be roughly considered as Gaussian with positive event being
‘outliers’ (Malo et al., 2006; Shun et al., 2011), the results from
siRNA screens are generally more widely distributed. Such a wide
range of responses can be explained by several hypotheses described
in Supplementary Material 1. Recent correction approaches such
as B—score perform well on general cases, but can display errors
when dealing with edge effects in a noisy environment, strong bias
or hit clusters (Supplementary Figs S8—Sl7). Considering the new
experimental conditions required by siRNA screening (e.g. increased
incubation periods and clustered libraries) and the speciﬁcities of the
RNAi—induced responses (e. g. wide phenotypic scales and possible
patterns of responses), we introduce here a new method enabling
the correction of edge effects occurring in RNAi screens. For each
individual plate, the algorithm ﬁrst extracts and evaluates the spatial
bias from a control column and extrapolates the artefact model to
the remainder of the plate.

In (Zhang, 2011), the authors identiﬁed a set of spatial artefacts
corrupting their siRNA screenings and classiﬁed them in three
categories: column—, row— and bowl—shaped effects. The last one
displays similarities with what we deﬁned here as an edge effect.
However, if a second—order polynomial can usually model efﬁciently
the effect; such approach was unable to correct properly our edge
effect. The widely used B—score correction also generated similar
artefacts as shown in Supplementary Figs S8 and S9. Our goal here is
not to propose a generic approach for correcting unknown systematic
error corrupting experimental data in high—throughput screening, but
to target a speciﬁc and recurrent type of artefact known as edge
effect. Thus, for our method to be effective, the user has to identify
and assess the error type by performing control plate analysis prior
or within the screening campaign. This article’s purpose is also to
show that a relevant prior on the phenomena can provide not only
a better understanding of the error, but also a relevant correction
by making the method adapted to one speciﬁc case. However, we
proved that if no bias is present, our correction scheme does not
induce modiﬁcation of the original data.

We developed and validated our proposed method on control
plates and applied the data—correction protocol to a genome—wide
siRNA screen studying the interactions between human cells and
the human immunodeﬁciency virus (HIV).

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Border-effect characterization

During screening development, the robustness and reproducibility of the
assays were addressed. The accuracy and homogeneity of each automated
process was veriﬁed to exclude any artefact possibly caused by automatic
liquid handling. To ascertain the inter—well and intra— and inter—day
reproducibility of the assay, two sets of ﬁve control plates were evaluated
with a 1 day interval under exactly the same conditions as in the subsequent
HTS (Fig. la and Supplementary Material 2).

As shown in Figure 2, this study revealed a dramatic edge effect, as the
HIV infection burden was increased on the border of the 384—well plates.

Fig. 1. Spatial bias visualisation. (3) Overview of the edge effects on the ﬁve control plates evaluated on Day 1 (top row) and on Day 2 (bottom row). Panels
(b) and (c) display a synthetic reconstruction of a 384—well control plate with the confocal images of HIV—infected cells. For each well, a randomly chosen
picture acquired within the considered well is displayed, giving an overview of the biological nature of the bias. The confocal images were acquired on Day
5 after infection. Cells overexpress the EGFP reporter protein when infected (green).

Despite the complications of plate—to—plate and overall day—to—day variation
in the HIV infection, the bias that was observed for the edge wells was
reproducible and seemed to follow a regular trend. Inaccurate cell dispensing
and variation in knockdown efﬁcacy were ruled out as explanations for this
bias. Indeed, on Day 4 after transfection and before HIV infection, the
cell number (measured by cell coverage) and silencing level (monitoring
the EGFP ﬂuorescence of cells transfected with EGFP and non—targeting
siRNAs) were found to be reproducible and homogeneous compared with
wells located at the centre and the edges of 10 control plates (Fig. la).

The data displayed a systematic strong spatial bias, corrupting the
ﬂuorescence intensities (see Figs 1 and 2 and Supplementary Fig. SS). Indeed,
unlike a compound—based screening, an siRNA—based screening presents a
large variety of results. Thus, it is inappropriate to consider the results as
a very large number of negative responses containing rare and sparse hit
events. Consequently, the data—correction algorithm should rely mainly on
the dedicated positive controls, and the correction must be extrapolated over
the entire plate.

To characterize the artefact, we used the 10 control plates and created
a synthetic image resulting from a well—by—well average of the pictures
acquired for each well. The result is displayed in Figure 1c, as is the
corresponding 3D graph representing the average intensity level for each

well (Fig. lb). This analysis shows that this systematic bias was located on
the borders of the plate and seems to be caused by the plate geometry itself.
The intensity of the bias corresponding to each well appears to be related to
the distance of the well from the plate border.

Consequently, we refocused our study on a more speciﬁc aspect of
background modelling. Indeed, in the HTS context, as the liquid volume
in each well is relatively low (particularly in 384—well plates), it is clearly
sensitive to evaporation and hydration by atmospheric moisture (Ramadan
et al., 2007). Such processes have a direct impact on the quality of the
results (Fig. l) and should be taken into account during either the screening
optimization procedure (Lundholt et al., 2003) or the data analysis step
(Birmingham et al., 2009; Zhang, 2008).

The main assumption of the proposed method is that the evaporation
process can be modelled over time by a diffusion model; i.e. the readout of
each well will vary following this diffusion law across the entire plate. The
evaporation begins at the plate borders, creating this ‘edge effect’, evolving
continuously and smoothly over space and time. Consequently, our aim was
to ﬁrst deﬁne the correct set of parameters governing the diffusion—state
model corresponding to the experimental data observed on each plate and
then apply a relevant correction. However, libraries provided by vendors in
384 wells plate format do not let the user the choice of the control wells,

which are usually located at the ﬁrst and second columns near the plate
edges. Even if the second column is still robust for evaluating the effect in
various conditions, the relevance of our approach obviously increases with
the number of controls. We propose here a correction identifying the model
parameter from one column and apply the correction to the entire plate, but in
case of adapted data (i.e. acceptable signal to noise ratio and no hit cluster),
the model evaluation can be performed on the entire plate.

2.2 Diffusion model

2.2.1 Plate and signal modelling Assuming a multiplicative bias, the
values associated with each well are given by:

Z2011) = (bn(iaj)*zn(iaj))+E(ivj)av(ivj) 6 F, (1)

where (i, j) represents the spatial coordinates of the well over the plate,
n is the plate index, zn(i, j) is the original ﬂuorescence signal, bn(i, j) is
the multiplicative bias and EU, j) is the standard additive noise, usually
deﬁned as Gaussian noise with low variance. F deﬁnes the dispensed set
of well coordinates on a plate of dimension M ><N (I‘: [1,M] >< [1,N] for
a rectangular, fully dispensed plate). In this speciﬁc application, we do
not consider the bias to be correlated from plate to plate, and thus, we
do not consider the plate index n as a relevant parameter for the surface
(background) estimation. Consequently, and to simplify the notation, the
plate index n is omitted hereafter. Nevertheless, if the operator can highlight
a plate—to—plate repeatability in the bias, the bias estimation can be improved
by averaging the signal over a set of plates and thus increasing the robustness

of the proposed algorithm. Finally, assuming a multiplicative bias and a good
signal—to—noise ratio for the additive noise [i.e. 6(l , j) w 0], a ﬁtting procedure
for the background b(i, y) should allow us to retrieve the unbiased signal
z(i,j) using Equation (1).

2.2.2 Diﬁusion equation To model the edge effects, we choose a linear
version of the diffusion equation, also known as the heat equation. This
speciﬁc 2D diffusion process follows the parabolic differential equation
given by

Bag-J) =cAl3(i,j, t), (2)

 

where 13(i, j, t) is the estimated spatiotemporal diffusion ﬁeld over the
plate (i.e. the estimated bias), 0 is the diffusion coefﬁcient (set at unity for
convenient notation) and A is the Laplacian operator. The partial differential
equation (PDE) solutions are also deﬁned by the initial conditions l3(i , j, t =
0). Under the assumption of a bias related to plate geometry, for a fully and
equally dispensed plate, these boundary conditions can be written as follows:
l3(i,j,t)=U1, V(i,j)ez2\r 3
{E(i,j,t=0)=U0, V(i,j)el" ()

where U0 and U1 are positive parameters. These initial conditions can be
physically seen as follows:

0 at the initial time i=0 of the dispensing, there is no edge effect on the
plate; and

0 the effect strength is driven by a physical difference between the inside
(r) and the outside (z2 \ r) of the plate.

Note that Equation (3) can be spatially adapted with regard to the initial
well dispensing and thus can take into account different spatial conﬁgurations
of the wells (i.e. partial or heterogeneous dispensing). We then assume that
plate background response ﬂuorescence values can be accurately modelled by
the function 13(i , j ; P) with P2001”, U0, U1)T. This triplet should be estimated
using conventional optimization schemes. To properly model the bias, we
propose to split the optimization framework into two consecutive operations:
the ﬁrst obtains the bias proﬁle related to top), and the second shifts and scales
the data to properly ﬁt the physical values acquired during the screen. In the
following, we ﬁrst describe the optimization process for the ﬁrst parameter
top). For this application, we simulate a discrete version of the diffusion
process based on the heat Equation (2), with the boundary conditions deﬁned
in Equation (3).

To numerically solve this partial differential, we use the classical approach
based on ﬁnite differences by substituting the partial derivatives with
truncated Taylor series approximations. Then, Equation (2), using the ﬁnite
forward difference in time and the central difference in space (FTCS), can
be written in a 2D discrete manner as follows:

 

 

l3(i,j,t+k)—l~)(i,j,t) _ l3(i+h,j,t)—2l3(i,j,t)+13(i—h,j,t)
k — 4

+

 

~ lL ~
h4 I

where k is the time step, and h is the spatial step (which here are
horizontally and vertically identical). In our application, it is important to
note that the minimum value of h is limited by the horizontal and vertical
number of wells.

The time evolution of the bias generated by the model at location (i , j) e F
can be written as follows:

E(i,j,t+k)= (1—4hi4)13(i,j,t)+
,£.(z3(i—h,j,t)+z”o(i+h.j,t) (5)
+l3(i,j—h, t)+E(i,j+h, t)).

The solution of such a partial differential equation is known to be stable
and convergent if the Courant—Friedrichs—Lewy condition (CFL condition)
is respected (Courant et al., 1967). This condition is particularly critical in

our case, where the spatial resolution is low due to the large area of the
wells compared with total area of the plate, which limits the F tessellation
resolution.

Speciﬁcally, the iterative process described by Equation (5) is achieved by
applying a discrete Laplacian operator over the image (see Supplementary
Movie 1 for an example of plate—based diffusion process) and adding it to the
previous solution, generating a set of 2D solutions over time [i.e. E(i , j, t), Vt e
R+]. Among these solutions, one should correspond to the diffusion state of
the considered plate z’ (i, j) (Supplementary Fig. S1). To ﬁnd it, we must
deﬁne a metric for evaluating the similarity between the model l3(i , j, t) and
the considered plate z’ (i, j) (Fig. 1).

As the solutions of Equation (2) are related to the initial border value U0,
we consider them to be true as multiplicative and additive coefﬁcients that are
deﬁned by the well—response values (here, ﬂuorescence quantiﬁcation). This
assumption eliminates many non—normalized distances, such as the standard
Euclidean distance. For the purposes of our application, we decided to use
the standardized Euclidean distance ,0 as a cost function. The optimization
scheme can thus be written as follows:

argmaxp(z/, Z3). (6)

top; 

Thanks to the low dimensionality of the model, the optimization process
can be achieved using a brute—force approach, avoiding local maxima results.
Once this parameter top, is obtained, we can consider the bias proﬁle
to be deﬁned. Until this point, the physical values in the heat equation were
normalized by simple practical boundary conditions (i.e. U1 2 l and U0 2 0).
To complete the process, we must estimate the last two parameters, U1 and
U0, based on the dynamics of the plate—ﬂuorescence responses. Basically, we
must estimate the shift and stretch values of the modelled proﬁle based on
physical values. This is performed by ﬁtting the model 13 to the data z’ using
a L2 distance function. This second optimization scheme can be written as
follows:
argmax IIE..,,,(U0, U1)—z/||2 (7)
U0,U1€R+
This step is achieved by using a conjugated gradient algorithm, leading
ﬁnally to the triplet P2001,“ U0, U1)T characterizing the diffusion proﬁle,
i.e. the solution of the equation under the physical constraints dictated by the
system.

The correction process is concluded by dividing the original signal z by the
estimated bias 5, leading to the corrected plate 2(i , j), (i , j) e F (Supplementary
Fig. S l). The results obtained within this framework tend to conﬁrm that the
assumptions used to model the bias found in these control plates using a
diffusion equation are relevant. Figure 3 displays ﬁve control plates before
and after correction with their associated readout values (i.e. intensities).
A ﬁrst visual inspection of the plates conﬁrms the elimination of the bias,
leading to a more evenly distributed intensity readout. Moreover, the central
limit theorem states that the resulting distribution of the intensity average
should approach the normal distribution, as the readouts are assumed to have
independent and identical distributions. The original plates tend to display
heavy—tailed distributions (at times even seeming bimodal), whereas the
corrected plates present a normal intensity distribution. We can thus conclude
that the correction process removed the spatial bias, leading to the expected
probability distribution for the results. As our algorithm targets the edges
effects, a test validating the presence of this artefact is required to provide
an accurate correction. Such test can be performed either on fully dispensed
plates prior or within the screen campaign. A relevant and regular way to
assess the well—funded correction can be done by applying the correction
algorithm to the deﬁned plates followed by a normality test to the corrected
readouts. Either a visual inspection of the bell—shaped data distribution or a
graphical tool such as a normal probability plot can be performed. As the
second option does not require a large amount of readouts, the linearity of the
probability plot can also be assessed on the control column of each individual
plate of the screen. Finally a pseudo code summarizing the correction method
is provided to the user in Supplementary Material 4.

2.3 Model extrapolation: from control wells
to entire plate

The method proposed in the previous section is based on a standard, fully
dispensed plate deﬁned by F: [1,M] >< [1,N]. In a screening context, those
control plates are regularly acquired in order to assess the reproducibility
of the readouts within a large set of experiments. These plates can be used
to validate and extract the parameters of the diffusion model. However, our
modelling allows us to restrain the domain F to a subset of wells SZCF
designated during assay development. Indeed, as explained in Section 1
and Supplementary Material 1, the readout values extracted from an siRNA

screen cannot be used for the direct modelling of the artefact: we must rely on
a set of control wells that are speciﬁcally chosen for this purpose. Our method
is not constrained to any speciﬁc pattern for the control (Supplementary
Fig. S4), and the user can even choose an unconnected set of wells, as was
proposed in (Zhang, 2008). In our case, each plate contains a negative control
that was designed as a column at a speciﬁc and recurrent position on every
plate.

The number and spatial conﬁguration of the wells required to estimate
the diffusion background is difﬁcult to assess as it is related to the quality
of the control experiments, their positions and their numbers. To evaluate
the robustness of our methodology, allowing for an accurate extrapolation
of the model from the controls to the complete plate, we simulated a set
of experiments representing the standard conditions of an siRNA screening
(Supplementary Fig. S6). Based on the diffusion model presented in Section
2.2.2, we generated three different artiﬁcial plates corresponding to three
different diffusion times (i.e. incubation times). The background was then
estimated using (i) the full plate or (ii) only the third column. Finally, the
same experiment was performed using the same set of plates but corrupted
by additional Gaussian noise, as deﬁned in Equation (1) (Supplementary
Fig. S6). The noise varies up to a peak signal—to—noise ratio (PSNR) of 19.48
dB, representing fairly poor plate conditions.

It appears that even under the worst signal—to—noise conditions, the use
of only the third column in modelling the diffusion process is sufﬁcient to
provide accurate results similar to those provided by the processing of the
full plate (Supplementary Fig. S3 for a more complete study of the column
position impact on the reconstruction quality).

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 HIV genome-wide siRNA screening: a case study

To identify host factors involved in the interactions with the HIV,
we performed an RNAi screening of human cells transfected with a

is described in more details in Supplementary Material 3.

Based on the means (21min) and standard deviations (SDp,SDn)
of, respectively, the positive and negative controls, a 2’ factor (Zhang
et al., 1999) was calculated for each plate n based on the following
formula:

A clear spatial artefact affected the infection burden, as increased
ﬂuorescence values of the reporter protein were obtained in the edge
wells compared to those located at the centre of the plate (Fig. 4a).
Intra— and inter—day reproducibility of the artefact was studied and
revealed that increased infection values were consistently obtained
in the edge wells (Fig. 5b). However, both the mean infection
burden and the dynamic range of the variation between the lowest
and highest values varied within each screening day and, more
noticeably, between screening days.

Such an observation emphasizes the need for a correction method
that is able to evaluate and correct for the bias within each plate
individually and can also adapt to the dynamic range of both
the infection and the artefact. Our normalization algorithm was
adapted for automated correction and applied for the correction
of the 68 assay plates in the screening. The correction method
was very efﬁcient in eradicating the edge effect, as homogeneous
infection values were obtained throughout the columns containing
positive and negative controls (Fig. 6A and data not shown). As
a consequence, the assay window of detection was signiﬁcantly
improved. The average 2’ factor was increased signiﬁcantly

that suffered from inaccurate cell dispensing and hence displayed
very low 2’ factors (values —1.1, —0.47 and —0.36) were not

—0.08). This illustrates the adaptability and the mildness of our
algorithm, which prevents any overcorrection issues.

where z: (i , j) represents the normalized output value, 2 and SD,
respectively, the readout mean and SD values over the complete
screen. A negative z—score corresponds to the decrease or the
blockage of HIV infection as compared with non—targeting control
(Fig. 5a), suggesting that the targeted gene has a decreasing
effect on an HIV burden (Fig. 5b). Pools were classiﬁed as host—
dependency factor (HDF) positive if they decreased in both screens
of EGFP ﬂuorescence by at least 3 SD from the negative controls.
In contrast, a positive z—score correlates with an increased HIV
burden, suggesting that the corresponding gene is a host cell factor
involved in the control of viral infection (Fig. 5c). Pools were
classiﬁed as host—restriction factor (HRF) positive if they increased
in both screens of EGFP ﬂuorescence by at least 3 SD from the
negative controls. As observed for the control columns (Figs 2
and 4a), the entire assays suffered from a dramatic spatial artefact,
as infection burden was increased at the border of the plates (Fig. 6).
Consequently, the selection of hits was strongly biased by this trend.
Indeed, hits classiﬁed as HDF because they decreased the infection
as compared to controls were preferentially located in the centres
of the plates. Conversely, hits increasing the infection compared
with the controls and classiﬁed as HRF occurred at the borders
of the plates (Fig. 6). However, after plate correction, the selected
hits were much more evenly distributed throughout the assay plate
for both HDF and HRF populations (see right Fig. 6a and b,
respectively). In addition, to select a comparable number of HRF
hits, much more stringent selection criteria were needed to be applied
after the correction, showing the overall assay detection window
improvement.

4 CONCLUSIONS AND MODEL IMPROVEMENT

Due to the extended incubation period required for the knockdown
procedure, RNAi—based HTS are likely subject to edge effects.
Moreover, due to the wide range of phenotypes, these screens
raise new challenges for the post—processing data normalization. We
developed a novel algorithm that is able to predict the edges—related
spatial bias for each plate individually using the data from a single
control column. The methodology is based on a physical modelling
of the bias, providing for its robust estimation. Supplementary
Figures 7 assesses the robustness of our approach on unbiased data.
Moreover, when the bias is associated to a diffusion process, the
cost function displays a clear global minimum. This can be used
to reject the diffusion model as the source of bias (Supplementary
Fig. S2). Our correction was applied to the data from a genome—wide
siRNA screen and was shown to signiﬁcantly increase the overall
assay quality and to improve the hit—selection process.

The constant development of RNAi screens and the emergence
of experiments requiring extended incubation periods (e. g. stem
cell differentiation) emphasize the need for a method of correcting
recurring edge effects. Moreover, the trend towards assay
miniaturization (for instance, plates containing 1536 samples) can
also increase the evaporation impact. However, with such plates, and
regarding the experiments, the cross—contamination artefact should
be taken into account in the correction model.

In addition, such a correction method should be able to circumvent
any bias that encountered in each library and/or biological process
and be adaptable to each plate individually. Finally, our correction
method could be made more robust in cases where the user has
prior knowledge of a redundancy in the bias over a set of plates
and can then average the control areas over those plates, further
reducing the experimental noise.

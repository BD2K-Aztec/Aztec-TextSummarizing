Abstract

Motivation: Comprehensive analysis of genome—wide molecular data challenges bioinformatics
methodology in terms of intuitive visualization with single—sample resolution, biomarker selection,
functional information mining and highly granular stratification of sample classes. oposSOM com—
bines those functionalities making use of a comprehensive analysis and visualization strategy
based on self—organizing maps (SOM) machine learning which we call ‘high—dimensional data por—
traying’. The method was successfully applied in a series of studies using mostly transcriptome

data but also data of other OMICs realms.

Availability and implementation: oposSOM is now publicly available as Bioconductor R package.

1 Introduction

Bioinformatics tools are needed which allow to statistically, func—
tionally and visually summarise high—dimensional data such as tran—
scriptome studies at different levels of resolution ranging from
individual samples and genes to sample classes and expression mod—
ules of co—regulated genes. For this purpose, we developed a
bioinformatics analysis pipeline based on self-organizing map
(SOM) machine learning which facilitates a holistic view on
this data (Wirth et 61]., 2011, 2012b). We termed this technique
‘high-dimensional data portraying’. It subsumes the visualization of
the data landscape of each individual, a series of downstream bio—
informatics and statistics analysis options and the detailed and com—
prehensive reporting of the results. We have chosen SOM machine
learning as backbone because it combines strong clustering, dimen—
sion reduction, multidimensional scaling and visualization capabil—
ities which have been shown to be advantageous compared to
alternative methods such as clustering heatmaps and negative matrix
factorization when applied to molecular high—throughput data (see
Wirth et 61]., 2011 and references cited therein). We complemented
the basal SOM algorithm with a sophisticated data analysis work—
ﬂow including visualization of the individual feature landscapes,

statistical testing for differential features and biomarker selection,
mining of biological function, and also sample diversity analysis to
assess classes of samples. oposSOM continues and largely extends
the scope of a previous SOM—based expression analysis tool, the
‘gene expression dynamic inspector’ (GEDI) (Eichler et 61]., 2003):
oposSOM is under steady development, provides a multitude of
sample diversity analyses and, most importantly, provides compre—
hensive functional annotations.

Our portraying—method has been developed in first instance for
gene expression data comprising from tens up to thousands of sam—
ples (e.g. tumour specimen in patient cohorts, experimental condi-
tions in cell line experiments). The portraying functionality is
unique and suited especially for scientists who attach importance to
visual control and intuitive perception of complex data. The soft—
ware was applied in a series of previous studies aiming at discover—
ing the gene expression landscapes of healthy human tissues (Wirth
et 61]., 2011), of cancer subtypes (Hopp et 61]., 2013a, b;
Reifenberger et 61]., 2014) and of stem cell development (Charbord
et 61]., 2014). Further applications addressed the integrative analysis
of mRNA and miRNA expression data (Cakir et 61]., 2014), the
proteome of algae (Wirth et 61]., 2012a), whole genome histone

2 Functionality

2.1 Package usability

The oposSOM package requires the input of gene—centered expres—
sion data solely, e.g. as pre—processed microarray intensity data or
RNA—seq read counts in log—scale. All other program parameters are
optional (see package vignette). An image of the analysis environ-
ment is stored upon completion of the oposSOM run.

2.2 Workflow

oposSOM comprises a multitude of analysis modules whose func—
tionalities were described in detail in our previous publications. An
illustration of the workflow and a complete list of methods imple—
mented in the package can be found in the Supplementary Material.
In brief, the package fulfils the following tasks:

' The SOM space obtained from the training process is character—
ized by several supporting maps and proﬁles providing, e.g. the
number of genes mapped to each meta—gene.

° Samples are individually portrayed in PDF report sheets allowing
the detailed examination of their expression landscapes and espe—
cially to identify modules of co—expressed genes.

° Feature maps, reports and lists allow feature selection and evalu—
ation of their statistical signiﬁcance.

° Gene set enrichment analysis of the expression modules provides
their functional context based on a large collection of predeﬁned
gene sets.

° Sample diversity analysis and class discovery is performed using
multiple algorithms (e.g. hierarchical clustering, correlation
spanning tree) and different metrics (Euclidean distance,
Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient).

2.3 Results

oposSOM stores the results in a defined folder structure. These re—
sults comprise a variety of PDF documents, which provide extensive
information about the systems studied (for example plots and
images of the input data, supplementary descriptions of the SOM
generated and associated metadata, the sample diversity landscape
and also functional annotations). The PDF reports are comple—
mented by CSV spreadsheets, which render the complete informa-
tion accessible. Detailed descriptions of the algorithms and
visualizations were given in our previous publications (Hopp et al.,
2013a, b; Wirth, 2012; Wirth et al., 2011, 2012b). HTML files are
generated to provide easy access to the analysis results via an intui—
tive and descriptive interface. A Summary/own] can be found in the
results folder created by oposSOM. We recommend new users to
browse the results using this interface.

3 Use case: portraying of cancer subtypes

We applied oposSOM to patient expression data of mature aggres—
sive B—cell lymphomas to characterize their genome wide expression
landscapes in terms of four distinct molecular subtypes which asso—
ciate with differing clinical phenotypes and survival prognosis
(Hopp et al., 2013a).

Figure 1 provides an overview of the analysis steps: The expres—
sion portraits visualize the expression landscape of each individual
sample (Fig. 1a) and of each subtype (Fig. 1b). Red and blue ‘spots’
in the portraits can be assigned to modules of co—expressed genes

up— and down—regulated in the respective sample/subtype, respect—
ively. The subtype portraits in Figure 1b immediately reveal distinct
and subtype—specifically over—expressed expression modules emerg—
ing as red spots located near the corners of the respective portrait.

All expression modules detected are summarized in the spot—
overview map (Fig. 1c). Each module is characterized in terms of the
list of genes included, their mean expression profile in all samples
studied and a list of enriched gene sets enabling functional interpret-
ation (Fig. 1d). Sample diversity plots, e.g. based on correlation net—
work and correlation spanning tree algorithms visualize
multivariate similarity relations between the samples (Fig. 1e, f).
They support our definition of the molecular subtypes by forming
well separated sample clusters.

A second use case addressing the expression landscapes of
human tissues can be found in the supplement. It illustrates advan—
tages of oposSOM data portraying compared to a ‘traditional’ two—
way clustering heatmap.

4 Conclusion

oposSOM bundles a series of sophisticated analysis methods with
intuitive visualization options to study high—dimensional data with
the special focus on gene—centered expression data. It is designed for
a broad user community ranging from bioinformaticians with de-
mands for comprehensive analyses in a sophisticated workflow to
application—oriented experimenters with needs in intuitive visualiza—
tion options for their data.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Cellular networks usually consist of numerous chemical
species, such as DNA, RNA, proteins and small molecules, etc.
Different biological tasks are generally performed by complex
interactions of these species. As these interactions can rarely be
directly measured, it is widely recognized that causal relationship
identification is essential in understanding biological behaviors of a
cellular network. Challenging issues here include not only the large
number of interactions to be estimated, but also many restrictions on
probing signals. The purposes of this study are to incorporate power
law in cellular network identification, in order to increase accuracy
of causal regulation estimations, especially to reduce false positive
errors.

Results: Two identification algorithms are developed that can be
efficiently applied to causal regulation identification of a large-scale
network from noisy steady-state experiment data. A distinguished
feature of these algorithms is that power law has been explicitly
incorporated into estimations, which is one important structural
property that most large-scale cellular networks approximately have.
Under the condition that parameters of the power law are known
and measurement errors are Gaussian, a likelihood maximization
approach is adopted. The developed estimation algorithms consist
of three major steps. At first, angle minimization between subspaces
is utilized to identify chemical elements that have direct influences on
a prescribed chemical element, under the condition that the number
of direct regulations is known. Second, interference coefficients
from prescribed chemical elements are estimated through likelihood
maximization with respect to measurement errors. Finally, direct
regulation numbers are identified through maximizing a lower bound
of an overall likelihood function. These methods have been applied
to an artificially constructed linear system with 100 elements, a
mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway model with 103 chemical
elements, some DREAM initiative in silico data and some in vivo data.
Compared with the widely adopted total least squares (T LS) method,
computation results show that parametric estimation accuracy can
be significantly increased and false positive errors can be greatly
reduced.

1 INTRODUCTION

Inferring causal relationships of a cellular network is one of
the fundamental problems in understanding cell behaviors. Major
reasons behind extensive attentions to this problem appear to lie
upon two facts. One is that cellular networks are generally of a
large scale and there are a huge number of causal interactions to be
estimated. The other is that there are many restrictions on probing
signals in biochemical experiments. For example, the perturbations
must be non—negative and some chemical elements may not be
directly affected, and so on. These make the problem of estimating
a cellular network much more difﬁcult than identifying an industrial
process (Akutsu et al., 1999; Andrec et al., 2005; Barabasi and
Oltvai, 2004; Gardner and Faith, 2005).

With signiﬁcant development of high—throughout technologies
and proteomics analysis methods, several approaches have now been
proposed for unraveling the interactions of a cellular network, such
as Boolean network methods (Akutsu et al., 1999; Shmulevich et al.,
2002; Zheng and Kwoh, 2004), Bayesian network methods (Ferrazzi
et al., 2007; Perrin et al., 2003), partial correlation analysis (de la
Fuente et al., 2004), differential equation—based time series analysis
(Bansal et al., 2006; Sontag, 2008) and so on. However, when
applying these methods to large—scale cellular networks, several
difﬁculties may arise (Cantone et al., 2009; Prill et al., 2010). For
example, with the number increment of chemical elements in a
network, computational burden of most of the methods increases
exponentially. To overcome this difﬁculty, some methods limit the
maximum direct regulation number, but this may restrict application
ranges of the method itself and give rise to a problem of selecting
principal chemical elements. On the other hand, statistical methods
such as partial correlation analysis rely on a variety of pairwise
correlation measures. This means that an indirect effect may be
wrongly recognized as a direct one, and therefore leads to a high
false positive rate.

In addition, a ‘top—down’ approach is proposed in Kholodenko
et al. (2002) and Andrec et al. (2005) for causal regulation
inference from steady—state concentration changes of chemical
species. This strategy is based on the total differential formula
and total least square (TLS) estimations. Afterwards, the results
have been extended to time series data, quasi—steady—state data, etc.
(Sontag, 2008), and the ‘non—direct effect’ condition on experiment
designs has been signiﬁcantly weakened (Berman et al., 2007).
Our computation experiences, however, show that when data length
is of a moderate size, it is very rare that an identiﬁed regulation

coefﬁcient is near zero. Recalling that a large—scale system usually
has a sparse structure, this means that TLS estimates usually give
incorrect information in case that a chemical element has no direct
effect on another chemical element. In other words, there may exist
signiﬁcant false positive errors in TLS—based estimates.

On the other hand, it is widely recognized that in cellular network
identiﬁcation, distinguishing direct and indirect regulations is of
great biological signiﬁcance (Barabasi and Oltvai, 2004; Cantone
et al., 2009; Prill et al., 2010). In actual identiﬁcations, however,
experimental data alone are rarely sufﬁcient to obtain a statistically
sound model. To make things worse, it may even be possible that
the identiﬁcation problem is under—determined if direct regulations
exist between every two chemical elements. These imply that in this
identiﬁcation problem, compared with false negative errors, it may
be much more difﬁcult to reduce false positive errors. To overcome
this difﬁculty, various interesting methods have been suggested, such
as to incorporate qualitative knowledge, to restrict the maximum
number of non—zero regulatory inputs, to penalize the sum of direct
regulation strengthes, etc. (Cantone et al., 2009; Chang et al., 2008;
Gardner et al., 2003; Prill et al., 2010).

In this article, we investigate possibilities of utilizing structural
information of a large—scale system to reduce both computational
complexities and false positive errors. As pointed out in Barabasi
and Oltvai (2004), most large—scale cellular networks obey
approximately a so—called power law.1 This observation gives
us some important a priori information about the structure
of cellular networks. However, to the best of our knowledge,
there are few researches so far that have explicitly explored
possibilities of utilizing this structural property in cellular network
identiﬁcation. In this article, we incorporate this property into
some estimation algorithms, in order to facilitate the inference of
direct causal regulations from noisy steady—state experiment data.
More speciﬁcally, a power law is incorporated into a likelihood
function to give an estimate about the direct regulation number
to a chemical element. When the number of direct regulations
is ﬁxed, angle minimization between subspaces spanned by two
groups of measurement data vectors is adopted to identify chemical
elements that provide direct regulations, while the regulation
coefﬁcients are estimated through likelihood maximization with
respect to measurement errors. Compared with a combinatorial
optimization—based algorithm, an attractive characteristic of the
suggested methods is that their computational complexity increases
only linearly with the increment of species number.

The suggested algorithms are compared with the widely adopted
TLS method, on an artiﬁcially generated linear network with
100 elements, a mitogen—activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling
network model with 103 proteins (Schoeberl et al., 2002), some in
silico data of the DREAM initiative (Prill et al., 2010) and some

 

1It has been recently argued in Clauset et al. (2009) that distributions such
as log—normal and stretched exponential ones may also be appropriate in
describing the sparseness of protein interaction networks, and it may be
more appropriate to use other distributions to characterize the structure of a
metabolic network. Our attentions, however, are focused on the power law
distribution. The reasons are that only two parameters are required to describe
this distribution, and the so—called parsimonious principle is widely adopted
in system identiﬁcation (Ljung, 1999). On the other hand, the suggested
algorithms can be easily modiﬁed to situations in which the number of direct
regulations obeys other stochastic distributions.

Computation results show that parametric estimation accuracy can
be signiﬁcantly increased and false positive errors can be greatly
reduced.

2 METHODS
2.1 A general description of the identiﬁcation
procedure

In this article, causal relations are inferred from steady—state concentration
changes of chemical species in a cellular network. This strategy is based
on the total differential of a nonlinear function which has also been used
in Kholodenko et al. (2002) and Andrec et al. (2005). A brief derivation is
given in Appendix A of the Supplementary Material for relations among
measurements of species concentrations and direct regulations, which
extends the results of Kholodenko et al. (2002) and Andrec et al. (2005)
from single perturbation to multiple perturbations. Assume that there are
n chemical elements in a cellular network and in the j—th experiment, some
external perturbations are added on a chemical element which do not directly
change the concentration of this species, then, the following relation can
be established approximately for a cellular network when the dynamics of
its species concentrations can be described by a set of ordinary nonlinear
differential equations,

k=1,k;éi

szluqm (n

Here, rik stands for the direct inﬂuences of the k—th chemical element on
the i—th chemical element around the perturbed equilibrium, while Rig-lg:1
can be obtained from measured species concentrations. More speciﬁcally, a
positive/negative rik means that there is an activation/repression effect from
the k—th chemical element to the i—th chemical element. If rik =0, then, it is
regarded that there are no direct inﬂuences from the k—th chemical element
to the i—th chemical element.

Assume that m experiments have been performed. Denote vectors
[Fl-1172  rial--1 rial-+1  rin]T and [lesz ...Ri_1,jR,-+1,j ...an], respectively
by x and Rj. Moreover, deﬁne matrix A and vector 19, respectively, as
A=col(Rj E7121) and b=C01(Rij|Jm:1), in which col(-) represents stacking
matrices/vectors in the brackets from top to bottom. Then, the relation of
Equation (1) can be compactly expressed as

Ax%b (@

The problem discussed in this article is to identify vector x under the
condition that both matrix A and vector 19 are provided. A distinctive
characteristic of this problem is that measurement errors exist in both matrix
A and vector 19. On the other hand, when n is large, it is now well known
that the distribution of the number of non—zero elements of vector x obeys
approximately the so—called power law. More precisely, let n,- represent the
number of chemical elements that have direct inﬂuences on a randomly
chosen chemical element in a cellular network, and Pr{'} the probability of
the occurrence of a random event. Then, there exist a positive number 7/ and
a positive integer kmin, such that2

th is worthwhile to point out that in structural analysis for a large—scale
network, investigations are usually focused on large ni’s (Clauset et al.,
2009). As there is generally no statistical information about the distribution of
small n,- ’s, it is reasonable to assume that all of them have an equal probability
to occur. This treatment makes the methods suggested in this article also
applicable to identiﬁcation of small— or moderate—sized networks, as well as
consistent with the method proposed in Gardner et al. (2003), which restricts
the number of non—zero direct regulations.

in which c= [kégny+zz:kmin+lk_y] 1. The purposes of this article are
to incorporate the above structural information into cellular network
identiﬁcation and to investigate its capabilities in estimation accuracy
improvements.

2.2 Identiﬁcation algorithm

As a ﬁrst step toward incorporating the so—called power law into cellular
network identiﬁcation, the following two assumptions are adopted.

0 Represent measurement errors of matrix A and vector b, respectively,
by 8,4 and 81,. It is assumed that elements of [8A 81,] are independent of
each other and have an identical normal distribution N(0, 02) with a
known o.

0 Parameters kmin and y are known for the power law.

When these pieces of information are available, a natural approach
for causal regulation identiﬁcation from experiment data is likelihood
maximization. More speciﬁcally, let #0 represent the number of non—zero
elements of a matrix or vector. Then, the likelihood function of measurement
errors and the direct regulation number, denote it by L(8A, 8b,k), can be
written as follows.

true), eblT [eA ebl}

L(8A, 8b, k)=(27102)_mn/2Pr{n,- =k}e_ 202 (4)
subject to: (A—sA)x=b_8b and #(x):k (5)

in which tr(') denotes the trace of a square matrix.

Note that m, n, kmin, y and o are assumed to be known. Recalling that
ln(.) is a monotonically increasing function over (0, 00), it is obvious that
the above maximization problem is equivalent to minimizing a cost function
l(8A, 81;, k) under the conditions of Equation (5). Here,

(6)

1(8A, 81;, k):

tr{[8A sbﬂsA 8g} jam/(min) 1: k 5 kmin
2o2 yln(k) kmin < k 5 n

While the above cost function is physically signiﬁcant, both discrete and
continuous variables are included in its optimization. Currently, it appears
difﬁcult to derive an analytic expression for the optimal k, 8,4 and 8b, as well
as to develop a globally/locally convergent optimization algorithm. In order
to obtain an estimate about a cellular network, the following three major
steps are adopted in this article.

0 For a ﬁxed k, angle minimization between two subspaces is utilized to
determine positions of the non—zero elements of vector x.

0 Under the condition that positions of non—zero elements are prescribed,
vector x is estimated through minimizing the ﬁrst term of the cost
function l(8A, 81;, k) with respect to measurement errors 8A and 8b.

0 The number of non—zero elements of vector x is obtained through a
numerical search which minimizes an upper bound of the cost function
[(SAaSbak)'

These three steps are investigated, respectively, in the following
subsections.

2.2.1 Position determination for direct regulations When the number of
non—zero elements of vector x, denote it by k, is given, there are in principle
C'n‘_1 possibilities to locate these non—zero elements. Here, C'n‘_1 denotes the
combinatorial number of selecting k elements from the set {l,2,...,n— 1}.
Note that for a ﬁxed k, C’n‘_1 increases exponentially with the increment
of n. This implies that when a large—scale system is under investigation,
in other words, when n is large, it is usually computationally intractable
to consider all these combinations in order to ﬁnd the optimal locations of
the non—zero elements. As a matter of fact, according to our experiences,
computation time is currently prohibitive if four direct regulations should
be searched for a chemical element within a network having more than
100 species. On the other hand, it is clear from Equation (5) that when there
are only k non—zero elements in vector x, then, only k columns of matrix A

are used to ﬁt the experiment data of vector b. Denote the i—th column of
matrix A from the left by a,, the i—th element of vector x from the ceiling by
xi, i: l, 2, ...,n — 1. Moreover, assume that the ja—th element of vector x has
been determined to be non—zero, a: l, 2, ...,k. Deﬁne matrix A and vector
5c, respectively, as A: [aj1 aj2  Cljk] and 5c=[xj1xj2 ...Xjk]T. Then, the ﬁrst
constraint of Equation (5) can be rewritten as

[A—ag‘ﬁzb—ab (7)
in which 8A =[aajl 801-2  aajk ], and ea]. represents measurement errors of
vector Clj,j=1,2,...,l’l—1.

Note that under this situation, there are no longer restrictions on ea].
whenever 1'75 ja, Va=l,2,...,k. According to the deﬁnition of the cost
function l(8A, 81,, k), the corresponding optimal ea]. is the zero vector. It can
therefore be declared that

min tr{[8A 8blT [8A 8bl}
s.t. (A—23A)x=b—el7 and #(x)=k

= min tl'{[8;‘ 8b]T[8A 8b]} (8)

s.t.(A—£A)5c=b—£b
The minimization problem on the right—hand side of the above equation
is widely known as the TLS, and has been well settled. In fact, the following
results have been established for a long time (Gloub and Van Loan, 1989;
Van Huffel and Vandewalle, 1991).

min true;abiTisAsb]}=g2([Ab]) (9)

s.t.(A—£A)5c=b—£b

in which g(.) stands for the minimal singular value of a matrix. Note that
every singular value of a matrix is non—negative. Therefore, the optimal
non—zero element position determination problem can be mathematically
expressed as

min gait b1) (10)
ja€{1,2,...,n—l},a=1,2,...,k

While the above results are elegant, they cannot be directly applied to the
optimal position determination of the non—zero elements of vector x, as the
corresponding minimization problem is still a combinatorial optimization
one for which it is generally hard to ﬁnd a globally or locally convergent
algorithm with polynomial computational complexities. On the other hand,
let range(b) and range(A) denote, respectively, the subspaces spanned by
vector b and vectors of matrix A. Then, it can be proved that there is an
upper bound of g([A b]) that is proportional to the sine of the half of the angle
between range(A) and range(b). More precisely, we have the next theorem,
while its proof is deferred to Appendix B of the Supplementary Material.

THEOREM 1. Let ék represent the angle between range(A) and range(b), ||b| |2
the Euclidean norm of vector b. Then,

g([?1b]):2llbllzsin%k (11)
In addition, deﬁne matrix A and vector b, respectively, as A =A(ATA)_1/2
and b = b(bTb)_1/2 , and denote the j—th column of matrix A from the left by a,,
j: 1,2, ...,n — 1. Then, we have the following results about subspace angle
minimization, while their proof is given in Appendix C of the Supplementary
Material.

THEOREM 2. Let 6k represent the angle between the subspace spanned by
vectors aja|§21 and the subspace spanned by b. Moreover, let jgpt], at:
l, 2, ---,k, stand for the positions of the elements of vector ATb with the ﬁrst

k biggest magnitudes. Then,
{1'ng1] $2,} =arg min 9,. (12)

jrajzamjk

From these two theorems, it can be seen that if the minimization of the
minimal singular value of [A b] is replaced by the minimization of 6k, then,
the optimal jo, lk can be expressed analytically, and therefore the problem

05:1
of the exponential increment of computation complexities is avoided.

Cellular network inference

 

On the other hand, let 10,-, lgi Sn— 1, denote the i—th row element of
ATb. Then, it can be shown that

k
~ 1
- 2 2
sm 6k51—_—§ :10, (13)
02(A)Hblléo,:,

A derivation of this inequality is given in Appendix D of the Supplementary
Material. Therefore, through selecting ill/0:21 that maximizes 2:21 101.2“, an

upper bound of 0k, and therefore an upper bound of g([A b]), has been
minimized.

It is worthwhile to point out that although relations between 6k and
0k are still not very clear, computation experiences show that compared
with maximization of 22211011, minimization of 6k generally leads to
better estimation performances in cellular network identiﬁcations. This is
illustrated by examples in the next section. However, theoretical reasons for
this phenomenon are still under investigations.

2.2.2 Estimation of regulation coeﬁ‘icients When locations of non—zero
elements of vector x have been determined, their values can be directly
obtained through singular value decomposition (Gloub and Van Loan, 1989;
Van Huffel and Vandewalle, 1991). More speciﬁcally, we have the following
results.

THEOREM 3. Assume that g(A) > g([A b]). Let v= [v1 v2  vk+1]T denote the
right singular vector of matrix [A b] with respect to its minimal singular
value, and ﬂop” the optimal vector 5c corresponding to the left hand side

minimization problem of Equation (9). Then, ﬂow] 2 — vklﬂ [v1 v2  vk]T.

 

When the condition g(A) >g([A b]) is not satisﬁed, analytical forms are
still available for the optimal solution of the aforementioned minimization
problem, but the expressions are more complicated. An interested reader is
recommended to refer to Gloub and Van Loan (1989), and Van Huffel and
Vandewalle (1991) for details.

2.2.3 Determination of the number of direct regulations In the above
estimations, it is assumed that the number of direct regulations is known
for a species in the cellular network. In actual applications, this is generally
not the case. To have an estimate of this number, the cost function of
Equation (6) should be minimized. This minimization problem, however,
is not mathematically tractable currently. To overcome this difﬁculty, on the
basis of Equation (9), an estimate of the direct regulation number is obtained
through minimizing a cost function J (k) which is deﬁned as follows.

 

J(k): (14)

2
Q (inlet “is”  “its” bl) + ylnacmin) ke [1, km]
202 ylnac) ke(kmin.n]

Obviously,
J (k) 3 min
8A, 812
subject to Equation (5)

l(8A, 81;, k) (15)

Therefore, minimization of J (k) has an explanation of minimizing an upper
bound of the cost function l(8A, 81,, k), which is equivalent to maximizing a
lower bound of the likelihood function L(8A, 81;, k).

Note that o, kmin and y are prescribed positive numbers. This means
that although it appears difﬁcult to obtain an analytic form for the optimal
k, this optimum can be obtained through linear searches for which many
methods are available. On the other hand, it is obvious that the ﬁrst term
of the above cost function is a non—negative and monotonically decreasing
function of k, while the second term is a non—negative and monotonically
increasing function of k. It can be expected that J (k) usually only has
one local minimum, which has been conﬁrmed by extensive computation
experiences.

From the above analyses, the following algorithms are suggested in this
article for identifying direct effects in a large—scale cellular network.

Algorithm I for Cellular Network Inference:

(1) Initialize vector x and J (0), respectively, as x = 0 and a large positive
number, for example, J (0) = 10100.

(2) Compute matrix A and vector ATb. Denote the i—th row element of
AM by y,-, and assume that |yj1 | Z lyjzl Z  Z lyjnil I.

(3) Construct matrix Ak as Ak = [aj1 aj2  Cljk ]. Compute the value of J (k)
which is deﬁned as

M): fail/(bl) Vim/cm) 15k :kmin

20'2 VIIIUC) kmin < k S 71

If J (k) <J (k— 1), replace k by k+1 and repeat the above Step 3. If

J(k) Z J(k — 1), go to the next step.

(5) Perform singular value decomposition of matrix [Ak_1 b]. Denote
its right singular vector associated with its minimum singular value
Q([Ak—1b]) by V

(6) Let v,- represent the i—th row element of vector v. Replace the ji—th
row element of vectorx by —VV—]:, i=1,2,...,k—1.

V

Algorithm II for Cellular Network Inference: this algorithm is completely
the same as that of Algorithm 1, except that in the second step, matrix A is
replaced by matrix A.

3 RESULTS

To illustrate the effectiveness of the developed inference algorithms,
we compare them with the TLS method in this section using ﬁve
examples, which include an artiﬁcially constructed large—scale linear
system, a MAPK pathway model of ordinary nonlinear differential
equations, some in silico datasets from the DREAM initiative (Prill
et al., 2010), and some in vivo datasets of Gardner et al. (2003) and
Cantone et al. (2009).

Note that in predicting the behaviors of a network, not only
structure of the network, but also regulation directions and strengthes
among its elements, play important roles. In addition to some
widely adopted speciﬁcations in network inferences, such as ROC
(receiver operating characteristics) curve, PR (precision recall)
curve, AUROC (area under a ROC curve), AUPR (area under a PR
curve), PPV (positive predictive value), Se (sensitivity), FP (false
positive) rate (Cantone et al., 2009; Gardner and Faith, 2005; Prill
et al., 2010), etc., the following three speciﬁcations are also adopted
in this article, which reﬂect the rate of false sign errors and parameter
estimation accuracies, respectively.

To be more speciﬁc, consider a cellular network consisting of n
chemical elements. Let xlj, i , j = 1,2, . . .,n, denote the actual direct
effect of the j—th chemical element on the i—th chemical element,
and fry- its estimate. Moreover, let N and P represent the total
numbers of x,:,- = 0 and xij 750, respectively. Furthermore, deﬁne FP
(false positive number), FN (false negative number), FS (false sign
number), LA (low accuracy number) and AA (acceptable accuracy
number), respectively, as follows.

0 FP: the total number of the case that xij :0 but lfcijl > pa;
0 FN: the total number of the case that x,:,- #0 but I)?le 5 pa;
0 FS: the total number of the case that xii-ch < 0;
0 LA: the total number of the case that xij #0 and fry- #0,
but |(5eij _xij)/xij| > pr;
0 AA: the total number of the case that x,:,- =0 and lyAcl-j | 5 pa,
as well as the case that xij #0, Sci]- #0 and

Here, pa and ,or represent acceptable magnitude bounds,
respectively, for absolute and relative parametric estimation errors.
Their values may vary with applications.

With the above numbers, the following three speciﬁcations are
deﬁned, which are used in this article to evaluate the effectiveness
of a network identiﬁcation algorithm.

0 FS rate (rate of false sign errors): FS/P;
0 LA rate (rate of estimates with low accuracy): LA / P;

0 AA rate (rate of estimates with acceptable accuracy):
AA / (P+N).

Moreover, note that the sum of the numbers of false negative
estimates and true positive estimates equals to P. We therefore have

that PPV: %, Se: 1 — g and FPrate: liq—P.

3.1 Example 1: an artiﬁcial linear network

In this subsection, the suggested algorithms are tested on
an artiﬁcially constructed network in which all the adopted
assumptions are completely satisﬁed. More precisely, a network
with 100 elements are utilized which obeys the power law with
kminzl and y=2.5. The number of direct regulations, as well
as regulation coefﬁcients, to a network element, are randomly
generated. Moreover, 500 trails have been performed to investigate
the statistical properties of the estimates.

The numerical simulation settings are as follows. Denote the
matrix consisting of the actual interactions among network elements
by X0. Every column of X0 is independently generated according to
the next three steps.

0 At ﬁrst, number of non—zero elements of a column is randomly
generated according to the power law with kmin = 1 and y = 2.5.
Assume it to be k.

0 Locations of non—zero elements are determined by the Matlab
m—ﬁle randpermm for random permutations. That is, elements
of the set {1, 2, . . ., 100} are at ﬁrst randomly permuted, and then
the ﬁrst k elements are adopted as the numbers of the rows in
this column with a non—zero entry. Denote them by ja l: :1.

0 The entry of the ja—th row of this column is generated
independently according to a uniform distribution over
[—2, —,oa]U[,oa2], a=1,2,...,k. All the other entries are
assigned to be zero.

On the other hand, a 103 X 102 dimensional real matrix A0 is
randomly generated whose entries are independent and uniform
samples from [1, 5]. Moreover, two 103 X 102 dimensional matrices
8A and 83 are generated with independent random samples of a
normal distribution N(0, 4). Finally, matrices A and B are generated
as A=A0+8A and B=A0X0+83.

After the production of matrices A and B, every column of X0
is estimated independently on the basis of the data of matrix A
and that of the corresponding column of matrix B. Estimation
performances are evaluated using the aforementioned speciﬁcations
with p, =10—5 and p,=5%.

In Table 1, both the empirical expectations and the empirical
standard deviations (SDs) are reported for the aforementioned
speciﬁcations, on the basis of 500 independent simulation trails.
In Figure 1, the empirical expectations of the corresponding ROC
and PR curves are shown, together with their empirical SDs.

The above numerical experiments have been repeated when
entries of matrix A0 take independent and uniform random samples
from [—5, —1]U[1, 5]. The corresponding results are given in the
aforementioned appendix of the Supplementary Material.

From these results, it is obvious that the suggested methods have
distinguished advantages over TLS estimations in both false positive
errors and parametric estimation accuracy. On the other hand, recall
that in a TLS estimate, an entry very rarely takes a value near 0.
It is not surprising to see that with respect to the rate of false
negative errors, which is equal to 1—Se by deﬁnitions, the TLS
method has an almost perfect performance. Moreover, compared
with the rate of false positive errors of the TLS estimate, the rate
of false negative errors of the suggested methods takes a much
smaller value. Furthermore, although compared with Algorithm I,
Algorithm II performs better sometimes in reducing both the rate of
false sign errors and the rate of low accuracy parametric estimates,
the differences are not very signiﬁcant. In addition, when elements
of A0 take values from [1,5], Algorithms I always outperforms
Algorithm II with the speciﬁcations Sensitivity, AUROC and AUPR.
However, when the set [1, 5] is replaced by [—5, —1]U[1, 5],
Algorithm II is slightly superior to Algorithm I in general.

It is worthwhile to point out that if only AUROC and AUPR
are adopted in performance assessment, then, when measurement
errors are not very signiﬁcant, the above simulations show that the
TLS method performs better than both Algorithms I and II. This is
not very surprising, as in the extreme situation, that is, when o :0,

Equation (2) is replaced by Ax =b for a linear network, but there is
no guarantee that minimization of 6k or 6k always leads to actual
positions of non—zero elements of vector x.

3.2 A nonlinear MAPK pathway model

In actual applications, it can rarely be expected that assumptions
adopted in algorithm developments are perfectly satisﬁed. In this
subsection, the suggested estimation algorithms are tested on a
MAPK pathway model, which consists of 103 chemical elements
and is described by a set of ﬁrst—order ordinary nonlinear differential
equations. These equations take completely the same form as that
of Equation (S1) of the Supplementary Material. This model is
originally built in Schoeberl et al. (2002) and capable of explaining
many biological observations. The structure of the model is given
in Figure S4 of Appendix F of the Supplementary Material.

Causal interactions among chemical elements of this network
are identiﬁed around one of its steady states or stable equilibria.
To apply the suggested algorithms, parameters for the power law
are required. To obtain this information and evaluate estimation
accuracies, the Jacobian matrix of the nonlinear function vector
[ﬁ(xk|l£31,pk|%:7l)]|llg is at ﬁrst computed at the selected stable
equilibrium xm, which is further used to calculate the actual
interactions among chemical elements using Equation (S3) in the
Supplementary Material. Based on these information, parameters of
the power law are estimated through counting the number of non—
zero rij with a ﬁxed i, i, j: 1,2, ..., 103; and ﬁtting the logarithm
of the corresponding empirical probabilities. Using this method,
19:0.8000 and kminzl are obtained. On the other hand, using
the likelihood maximization—based method of Clauset et al. (2009),
1? = 1.4718 and kmin = 1 are obtained. Figure S5 of Appendix F of the
Supplementary Material shows the calculated empirical probabilities
and the estimated power laws.

It is worthwhile to mention that although there are 103 chemical
elements in the MAPK pathway model, some of the species do
not have direct inﬂuences on their own concentration change

W = 0. In this case, the
xi 

interference parameter rij of Equation (S3) in the Supplementary
Material is not well deﬁned, and therefore the suggested methods,
as well as the TLS method, cannot be applied. On the other
hand, numerical simulations show that for some species with self—
concentration inﬂuences, the ﬁrst—order Taylor series approximation
of Equation (S6) in the Supplementary Material is not valid,
and therefore invalidates applications of all linearization—based

speeds, that is, for these species,

estimation methods. This happens when 0(| DECS] | lg, “SP | |%) is of the

fact, using the deﬁnition of rij, Equation (S9) in the Supplementary
Material can be rewritten as

Simulations show that at the selected stable equilibrium, for some

 

species, Ki(x[s],5)[CS],5p) has a magnitude >05; and in the worst
case, this magnitude is very close to 108. Under these situations,
the approximation of Equation (S9) in the Supplementary Material
is no longer valid.

Based on these considerations, 37 species are ﬁnally chosen
whose steady—state concentration change can be appropriately
approximated by the ﬁrst—order Taylor series and whose
concentration change speed can be directly inﬂuenced by its own
concentration.

In data generations, kinetic parameters pj | and initial values of

xk $231 are changed in a way similar to that of Andrec et al. (2005)

and Kholodenko et al. (2002). That is, when direct inﬂuences on
the i—th species are to be estimated, only the values of these pj,
je 1,2, . . . , 247, are permitted to be changed which do not explicitly
alter the value of the nonlinear function fi(x, p). More speciﬁcally,
an appropriate pj is selected together with 8~12 xks that are,
respectively, changed to 0.9999 xoszj for all the simulated time
and 0.9999X ,kak at the initial time. Here, both aj and ,Bk are
independent and uniform random samples from [0.9, 1]. Steady—
state concentration of every species in the network is calculated
before and after a perturbation using the toolbox Simulink of
the commercial software MATLAB. To every calculated relative
concentration change at the steady states, that is, 6E5] /xl[s], a random
number is added which is independently generated according to the
normal distribution with mean 0 and SD 10‘5 .

Estimation performances with pa 210—8 and ,or = 5% are shown
in Table 2 when experiment data length takes an integer between
142 and 146, while Figure 3 shows the corresponding ROC and
PR curves. The actual data length varies slightly with the number
of direct regulations from external perturbations on the chemical
element under investigation. From this table, it is clear that the TLS
method is superior to the methods of this article in false negative
errors. On the other hand, in both false positive errors and parameter
estimation accuracy, the methods of this article have prominent
advantages. Moreover, in either false sign errors or estimates with
large relative errors, both Algorithms I and II are also better
than the TLS method. Furthermore, except Sensitivity, Algorithm I
outperforms Algorithm II with respect to all the other adopted
speciﬁcations. These results are consistent with those obtained in
the previous linear network simulation example. However, when
AUROC and AUPR are considered, the TLS method has a better
performance than Algorithm II.

It is also clear from these estimation results that although curve
ﬁtting and likelihood maximization lead to very different estimates
for parameters of the power law, these differences do not lead to
signiﬁcant changes in network estimation performances, no matter

whether Algorithm I or II is used. This may imply that these two
estimation procedures are robust against estimation errors of these
parameters. In fact, several other artiﬁcial kmin and )A/ have also been
utilized, and consistent observations have been obtained.

In addition, a detailed analysis of the false negative errors of
Algorithm I with the curve ﬁtting—based parametric estimates of
the power law, shows that there are totally 75 direct regulation
coefﬁcients that have been incorrectly estimated as zero. With
respect to these regulations, the results of the corresponding TLS
estimates are as follows.

- Forty—one of them have a sign different from its actual value.

0 In the remaining thirty—four estimates, only one of them has a
relative error belonging [—5%, 5%]. As a matter of fact, most
of them have a relative error with a magnitude > 100%.

Consistent phenomena have also been observed for the false
negative estimates of Algorithm I with the likelihood maximization
based estimates of the power law parameters, as well as those of
Algorithm II. These results are summarized in Table S2 of the
Supplementary Material.

To investigate convergence properties of the suggested
algorithms, the species numbered 11 in Schoeberl et al. (2002),
that is, (EGF—EGFRi)2, is selected for which its direct regulation
coefﬁcients from other species are estimated with the data length
m varying from m=20 to m=104. In these investigations,

500 samples are taken for the data length m which equally distributes
over [20, 104]. Moreover, for every prescribed data length m,
100 simulations are performed to calculate empirical mean square
errors and empirical bias of the estimates, which are widely adopted
in assessing performances of an algorithm in system identiﬁcation
and state estimations (Akutsu et al., 1999; Gardner and Faith, 2005;
Ljung, 1999). Deﬁnitions of these two speciﬁcations are given in
Appendix F of the Supplementary Material.

Calculated values of these two speciﬁcations are, respectively,
shown in Figure 4a and b.3 From this ﬁgure, it is clear that for both of
the TLS method and the methods proposed in this article, estimation
error and estimation bias converge to zero. But if convergence rate
should also be considered, which is again an important index in
performance assessment of estimation algorithms, then, it can be
declared that Algorithm I has obvious advantages. But performances
of Algorithm II are poor.

As false positive error reduction is very essential in cellular
network estimations, errors are also computed for the estimated

 

3Note that when the data length is <102, Equation (2) is under—determined.
This implies that results for the TLS estimate in these ﬁgures are valid only
when the data length is Z 102. On the other hand, it can be simply proved
that when Algorithm I or II is adopted, the optimal estimate for the number of
direct regulations never exceeds the number of rows of matrix Ak. This means
that the aforementioned under—determinedness problem happens neither to
Algorithm I nor II.

number of direct regulations. In Figure S6 of Appendix F of the
Supplementary Material, these errors are shown for every simulation
with Algorithms I and II when the data length m increases from 20 to
104. Clearly, for Algorithm I, this error also monotonically decreases
in magnitude with the increment of data length. But for Algorithm II,
the magnitude of this error does not decrease appreciably even if the
data length becomes very large. This implies that when Algorithm I
is adopted, false positive errors can also be asymptotically reduced.
This is signiﬁcantly different from the TLS method, for which zero
elements can rarely be obtained in a corresponding estimate.

3.3 Application to other datasets

To evaluate performances of the developed algorithms, they have
also been applied to the in silico steady—state dataset of the Size 100
subchallenges of DREAM3 and DREAM4 in the DREAM initiative
(Prill et al., 2010). The results are given in Appendix G of the
Supplementary Material.

From these results and those available on the DREAM project web
site, it may be concluded that, Algorithm I/Algorithm II/T LS would
have been placed 4th/5th/12th in the DREAM3 subchallenge among
the 22 participated teams with a score of 32.0813/14.1991/2.7557,
and 16th/17th/18th in the DREAM4 subchallenge among the
19 participated teams with a score of 9.4248/5.8975/0.8830.
However, it should be emphasized that these results are not directly
comparable because the reported participants were completely blind
to the structures and dynamics of the networks.

Note that the top—5 teams of DREAM3 utilized both steady—
state data and time series data. Moreover, it is clear now that
these two kinds of data provide complementary information about
network structures (Prill et al., 2010). It appears safe to declare
that Algorithm I works well with the DREAM3 Size 100 sub—
challenges. In addition, our estimation procedures have signiﬁcantly
lower computational complexities. To be more speciﬁc, for the best
performer of these subchallenges, it is reported that approximately
78 h have been consumed to obtain an estimate with a high—end
cluster. But for both Algorithms I and II, <2 s were required even
if a personal computer is utilized, which is equipped with 2.00 GB
RAMs and two 2.40 GHz Intel(R) Core(TM) Quad CPUs.

However, performances of both Algorithms I and II are still very
poor for the DREAM4 Size 100 subchallenges. This may possibly
be due to that the adopted assumptions on noises 8A and 8b have
been seriously deteriorated.

On the other hand, except Sensitivity, both Algorithms I
and II outperform the TLS method in all these subchallenges.
Moreover, except in some speciﬁcations such as FS rate and
FF rate, etc., Algorithm II is slightly superior to Algorithm I,
Algorithm I outperforms Algorithm II in almost all the other adopted
speciﬁcations. In addition, when ROC curve is utilized to assess
estimation performances, both Algorithms I and II perform better
than random predictions in all the attacked subchallenges, but in
most of the DREAM4 subchallenges, performances of the TLS
method are very close to random predictions. In the extreme case,
that is, for the network Netl, the TLS method performs even worse
than random predictions.

To investigate the ﬂexibility of the suggested methods in cellular
network identiﬁcations, they have also been applied to the in vivo
data of the SOS test network (Gardner et al., 2003) and that of the
IRMA (in vivo ‘benchmarking’ of reverse—engineering and modeling

approaches) network (Cantone et al., 2009). The SOS test network
and the IRMA network have, respectively, only 9 and 5 genes.
Generally, the power law cannot be applied to networks with a
size of this order. But when the distribution of Equation (3) is
utilized, we found that it is still efﬁcient in improving performances
of TLS estimates. The details of the estimation results are provided
in Appendix H of the Supplementary Material. In these cases, as
the size of the involved network is not very large, it is feasible to
consider all the possible positions of non—zero elements of vector
x when the number of direct regulations is prescribed. To see
the conservativeness of the upper bound of Equation (14), the
corresponding estimation results have also been included in the
Supplementary Material.

The results of Appendix H of the Supplementary Material show
that performances of the suggested methods are close but slightly
better than the reported estimates. On the other hand, combinatorial
optimization—based estimate does not provide signiﬁcant estimation
performance improvements, although its computation time is almost
10 times longer than that of both Algorithms I and II.

In the above estimations, only curve ﬁtting—based estimates for
the power law parameters are utilized. But it has also been found
that ﬁnal estimation performances do not change appreciably even
if the likelihood maximization—based estimates for these parameters
are utilized.

4 CONCLUSION

In this article, possibilities have been investigated for incorporating
the so—called power law into identiﬁcation of direct causal
regulations in a large—scale cellular network. Under the assumption
that measurement errors are independently and normally distributed,
a likelihood maximization approach is suggested. On the basis of
relations between subspace angles and matrix singular values, two
procedures are suggested to estimate these interactions.

These methods are applied to an artiﬁcially constructed linear
large—scale network, a MAPK pathway model, some recently
developed performance assessment networks and the in vivo data
set of a nine—gene network and a ﬁve—gene network. Comparisons
with the widely adopted TLS method show that the suggested
methods have distinguished advantages on both reduction of false
positive errors and improvement of parametric estimation accuracy.
Moreover, one of the supposed algorithms has a much faster
convergence speed when either estimation error or estimation bias
is considered.

While most of the reported results are encouraging, the developed
estimation procedures are still far from satisfaction of practical
application requirements. This has been made very clear by the
unsatisfactory performances with the sub—challenges of DREAM4.
As further researches, it is interesting to investigate parameter
estimation from experiment data for the power law, simultaneous
identiﬁcation of direct causal regulations for multiple species,
appropriate statistical descriptions of noise and measurement errors,
as well as extending the procedures to estimations with other kinds
of experiment data, such as quasi—steady—state data, time series data
with non—uniform sampling, etc.

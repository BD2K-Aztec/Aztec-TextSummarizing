Abstract

Motivation: Aptamers are synthetic nucleic acid molecules that can bind biological targets in virtue
of both their sequence and three—dimensional structure. Aptamers are selected using SELEX,
Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment, a technique that exploits aptamer—
target binding affinity. The SELEX procedure, coupled with high—throughput sequencing
(HT—SELEX), creates billions of random sequences capable of binding different epitopes on specific
targets. Since this technique produces enormous amounts of data, computational analysis repre—
sents a critical step to screen and select the most biologically relevant sequences.

Results: Here, we present APTANI, a computational tool to identify target—specific aptamers from
HT—SELEX data and secondary structure information. APTANI builds on AptaMotif algorithm, ori—
ginally implemented to analyze SELEX data; extends the applicability of AptaMotif to HT—SELEX
data and introduces new functionalities, as the possibility to identify binding motifs, to cluster
aptamer families or to compare output results from different HT—SELEX cycles. Tabular and graph—
ical representations facilitate the downstream biological interpretation of results.

1 Introduction

 

DNA or RNA aptamers are small oligonucleotides (<100 nucleo—
tides) that recognize their ligands With an affinity equal or superior
to antibodies (Kim et 61]., 2011). These small molecules are not im-
munogenic, have a high capacity to penetrate tissues and can be eas—
ily modified to regulate their half—life or conjugated With drugs
(Wang et 61]., 2011). Aptamers have entered the clinical pipeline
with more than nine phase I and II ongoing clinical trials for diseases
as macular degeneration, coronary artery bypass graft surgery and
various types of cancer (Keefe et 61]., 2010). Aptamers are selected
in vitro by the use of an unsupervised iterative method called
SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential

Enrichment), in which aptamers specific for a ligand are selected
from an initial pool of random oligonucleotides using counter—selec—
tion and selection procedures. Historically, a SELEX experiment
required multiple (>15) rounds of selection With the undesirable ef—
fect of amplifying some intrinsic pitfalls, as e.g. the selection of poly—
merase chain reaction (PCR) artifacts. In recent years, the advent of
high—throughput sequencing technologies revolutionized the SELEX
technique, drastically reducing the number of cycles and, conse—
quently, the possibility of generating artifacts. HT-SELEX (the
SELEX procedure, coupled With high—throughput sequencing)
boosted the use of SELEX technique to identify monoclonal
aptamers against different epitopes of a ligand or of a Whole cell.

However, the quantity of data derived from a single HT-SELEX ex-
periment requires the development of new computational tools to ef—
fectively identify aptamers with elevate binding proprieties.
Considering that the binding affinity, of a specific aptamer toward
its target, depends on the aptamer secondary structure (Tucker
et al., 2012), structural properties could be exploited to select those
aptamers that more likely interact with a ligand. To date, even
though interest in secondary structures is rising (Thiel et al., 2012),
most of the available algorithms and software that analyze HT-
SELEX data do not make use of any structural information but rely
solely on the abundance (frequency) of the nucleotide sequences at
the various cycles. To fulfill this gap, we developed APTANI a soft—
ware package to select aptamers from HT—SELEX experiments using
both sequence counts and structural motifs. APTANI builds on
AptaMotif algorithm, originally implemented by Hoinka et al.
(2012) to analyze SELEX data and extends its applicability to HT—
SELEX data. Additionally, APTANI, through the integrative ana—
lysis of frequency and secondary structure, allows to identify not
only those aptamers with the highest binding probability but also
their putative binding motifs. Finally, APTANI comprises some add—
itional functionalities as the possibility to cluster aptamer families or
to compare output results from different HT-SELEX cycles.

2 Methods

APTANI workflow consists of four major steps: (i) frequency calcu—
lation; (ii) secondary structure and motif breakdown; (iii) extraction
of structural motif consensus sequences and (iv) aptamer scoring
and structural motif identification.

Given an input file in FASTQ format, the first step calculates the
relative frequency of each individual aptamer sequence produced by
the HT—SELEX process. Frequency counts can be quantified either
using the whole aptamer sequence or only its variable region, i.e. the
part of the aptamer comprised between right and left ﬂanking se-
quences (tags). Low abundant sequences are then filtered, setting a
threshold on the minimal frequency (the default value is 10—7), to se—
lect only high frequent aptamers for the further steps.

In the second step, APTANI predicts, for each aptamer that
passed the frequency filter, all secondary structures in a specific en—
ergy range and extracts the motifs represented in these structures
(i.e. sub—structures and the correspondent sub—sequences). At this
stage, APTANI adopts the same procedure of AptaMotif as
described in Hoinka et al. (2012). Specifically, secondary structures
are predicted using RNAsubopt (Hofacker et al., 1994; Wutchy
et al. 1999), an algorithm, contained in the ViennaRNA package
(Lorenz et al. 2011) and embedded in APTANI, that calculates all
suboptimal secondary structures within a user defined energy range
above a minimum free energy (MFE) threshold. For this type of cal—
culation, the default MFE threshold is usually set to 3 Kcal/mol.
However, given the massive number of analyzed sequences in
SELEX/HT-SELEX experiments (from 1 to 3 million sequences), an
MFE threshold of 3 Kcal/mol requires an exorbitant computation
time. Thus, to identify an appropriate threshold for the MFE, we
performed several rounds of secondary structure prediction testing
different values of the MFE and identified in 1 Kcal/mol a reason—
able trade—off between running time and thorough structure investi—
gation. Nevertheless, this value can be easily modified setting the
energy (—e) parameter from the APTANI command line (see the
Supplementary Information for further details on the usage of
APTANI parameters). As in AptaMotif (Hoinka et al., 2012), we
consider four different types of secondary structure motifs, i.e.

hairpin loops, bulge loops (either right or left) and intra—strand
loops. Specifically, hairpin loops are closed continuous structures
characterized by the pairing of two nucleotides that close the loop
and confer the hairpin conformation; intra—strand loops are struc—
tures consisting of two different strands of variable length, ranging
from three to a non—definite number of nucleotides and bulge loops
(either right or left) are sub—structures of the intra—strand loop cat—
egory in which one strand consists of two nucleotides, while the
other has a non—defined length. Right and left bulge loops are
defined depending on where the two—nucleotide strand lays. Since
RNAsubopt outputs secondary structures as combinations of dots
and brackets, we defined dedicated regular expressions to search
each type of loop structure and retrieve the associated nucleotide se—
quence from the investigated aptamer. Secondary structures are
identified on the whole aptamer sequence or, in case the frequencies
have been quantified using the variable region only, on the variable
region supplemented by right and left tags.

The third step extracts consensus representations for any of the
four secondary structure motifs from the sub—sequences of all
aptamers where a specific structural motif has been identified. To re—
duce the computational load of inspecting all sub—structures and
sub—sequences of the whole aptamer pool, we assume that if a struc—
tural motif, with a given sub—sequence, is shared by a large fraction
of aptamers, then it is highly probable that the motif will emerge
even when considering only a subset of the entire pool (Bowser,
2005). Thus, a portion of all aptamers and their secondary structure
motifs are iteratively randomly picked from the output of the second
step, and their sub—sequences are aligned to obtain a consensus se—
quence for any of the four secondary structure motifs. This step re—
sults four different consensus sequences at any iteration, i.e. one for
any of the four different types of secondary structure motifs (hairpin
loops, left and right bulge loops and intra—strand loops). Consensus
sequences, for any of the four secondary structure motifs, are con—
structed using the most frequent nucleotides of the aligned se—
quences. Gaps are introduced in the case nucleotides show a
frequency lower than a background frequency or when two or more
nucleotides have the same frequency. The background frequency is
calculated counting the occurrences of each nucleotide in the filtered
aptamers pool and dividing them by the total number of nucleotides
investigated. The number of sub—samplings and the percentage of
the whole aptamer pool selected at each iteration are specified
through the cycle (—c) and the percentage (—p) parameters, respect—
ively. Multiple sequence alignment is performed with Clustal
Omega (Sievers et al., 2011) using default parameters. However,
Clustal Omega parameters (as, e.g. the number of hidden Markov
model iterations or the maximum number of examples in any clus—
ter) can be modified from the APTANI command line. Clustal
Omega alignments can be visualized as a clustering tree. The cluster—
ing plot is generated using FigTree, embedded in APTANI and freely
available at http://tree.bi0.ed.ac.uk/software/figtreel.

In the last step, any aptamer sub—sequence, correspondent to a
specific secondary structural motif, is aligned to the consensus repre—
sentation of that structural motif (i.e. the sequence of the hairpin
loop in a given aptamer is aligned to the hairpin loop consensus se—
quence). Before alignment, the motif sub—sequence in each aptamer
is trimmed to the length of the consensus sequence. The alignment
score is then calculated using a match/mismatch—scoring scheme
(match: +1; mismatch: —1) with a gap penalty of 0.5. The total
score is finally normalized to account for the different consensus se—
quence lengths. Score values range from —1 to 1, with a score of —1
indicating that the aptamer secondary structure motif is completely
different from its respective consensus sequence. Instead, a score of

1 indicates a complete match between the aptamer and the consen—
sus secondary structure motifs. In essence, the score, quantifying the
similarity of an aptamer secondary structure motif to the ideal motif
of the most abundant secondary structures, gives an indication of
the binding potential of aptamer sequences bearing the motif. The
normalized alignment score is thus used to rank aptamers (that
passed the frequency filter) in terms of matching of the motifs they
contain to the corresponding secondary structure consensus motifs.
As a result, APTANI returns, for any aptamer, its abundance, the
alignment scores, the structural motifs and the consensus sequences
(Supplementary Table S1).

2.1 Installation and usage

APTANI is written in Python 3.3, does not require any specific
Python module and the package contains all necessary files for the
execution of a complete analysis. However, the software requires
the installation of Clustal Omega (Sievers et al., 2011) and of a Java
Virtual Machine while includes RNAsubopt 2.1.9 (Wuchty et al.,
1999), to calculate secondary structure and FigTree (http://tree.bio.
ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/) to generate the clustering tree image.
Further details on the software installation and usage are available
in Supplementary Information.

3 Results

To test APTANI performances and validate its findings, we analyzed
a sequence library corresponding to an HT-SELEX experiment de-
signed to isolate aptamers specific for murine IL4Ra (Roth et al.,
2012). Briefly, epoxy beads conjugated with the extracellular do—
main of IL4Ra were used to screen a combinatorial random RNA li-
brary of approximately 1014 aptamer species. Libraries from the
PCR reaction of SELEX cycles 0, 1, 3, 5 and 11 were tagged in 5 ’
and 3’ with DNA tails containing the primers and tags for hybridiza-
tion and control. Libraries were quantified via real—time PCR and
bio—analyzer, admixed equally and sequenced with an Illumina
NGS. The derived FASTQ files were processed with Illumina soft—
ware to separate the clones from each library and imputed to
APTANI to select potentially binding aptamers directed to IL4Ra.
The experiment comprised 11 different cycles of evolutionary selec—
tion of the randomly generated aptamers, leading to a final cycle
containing approximately 2—3 million sequences.

Setting the threshold for the frequency cut-off at 107, APTANI
selected, from cycle 11 data, 410 842 different aptamer sequences of
99 base pair length. The majority of the sequences from the last
cycle were extremely similar (95—99% similarity with Clustal
Omega alignment) to the Cl.42 aptamer, previously demonstrated
to be specific for mouse and human IL4Ra using conventional meth-
ods (i.e. cloning and sequencing; Roth et al., 2012). Interestingly,
while conventional methods were able to identify the Cl.42 clone
starting from cycle 5, APTANI identified Cl.42 just from the data of
the first cycle of selection (cycle 1), i.e. from a pool of sequences still
in the process of being selected and composed mostly of the initial
random oligonucleotides with only few aptamers displaying affinity
for the target. The secondary structure analysis of these cycle 1 se—
quences (using 100 iterations and selecting, at each iteration, a num—
ber of random aptamers equal to 20% of the entire pool) allowed
selecting 53 aptamers containing secondary structure motif sub—se—
quences with an alignment score (with loop consensus sequences)
>0.25 and clustering in three major families dominated by Cl.42
aptamer (alignment score > 0.8; Supplementary Fig. S1). Frequency
and score values of the intra—strand loop identified by APTANI in

Cl.42 suggested that the CCAUGC secondary structure motif could
be essential for the binding to IL4Ra. To test this hypothesis, we
generated a mutant aptamer (mutCl.42) in which the CCAUGC
motif was substituted by UUUCCC. The analysis of the putative sec—
ondary and tertiary structure of mutCl.42, using RNAfold
(Denman, 1993) and RNAComposer (Popenda et al., 2012), con—
firmed that this mutation completely disrupts the intra—strand loop
of Cl.42 (Fig. 1). To experimentally verify the dependency of Cl.42
binding activity from the intra—strand loop, we evaluated Cl.42 and
mutCl.42 affinities in a binding assay against epoxy beads loaded
with recombinant IL4Ra. As shown in Figure 1, while Cl.42 cor-
rectly binds to beads loaded with IL4Ra, the mutant aptamer does
not show any binding activity suggesting that the intra—strand loop
identified by APTANI is indeed required for conferring functional
activity to the aptamer sequence.

To access the impact of parameters on the final results, we run a
second analysis with lowering the number of iterations to 50, while
keeping constant the percentage of randomly picked aptamers at
each cycle (i.e. 20% of all aptamers) and the frequency threshold.
With this set of parameters, APTANI retrieved 30 aptamers, con—
taining secondary structure motif sub—sequences with an alignment
score >0.25 and clustering in three major families dominated by
Cl.42 aptamer, whose alignment score remained >0.8. We finally
performed the same analysis considering the aptamer variable re—
gion. With the same set of parameters used in the previous experi—
ments, APTANI retrieved, from cycle 11, 416 616 different variable
sequences, with a frequency spanning from 10'1 to 10'8 and a length
ranging from 35 to 40 nucleotides. Of these variable sequences, 42
presented highly populated motifs and frequencies. As in the

Fig. 1. The Cl.42 loop identified by APTANI is necessary for Cl.42 aptamer
binding to the cognate receptor. To assess the functional relevance of the
CCAUGC motif identified by APTANI, we first synthetized the C142 aptamer
(A) and a mutant Cl.42 (mutCl.42, B), with the original CCAUG sequence sub-
stituted by UUUCC. Secondary structure analysis suggests that this five nu-
cleotides substitution completely abrogates the original intra-strand loop (A
and B). Then, to evaluate whether the CCAUGC motif was important for the
aptamer binding to IL4Ra, Cl.42, mutCl.42 and an irrelevant aptamer were
labelled with Cy3 and incubated with epoxybeads conjugated with recombin-
ant IL4Ra. Binding was evaluated by FACS after washing out the unbound
Cy3 labeled aptamer with PBS (C). As expected, the Cl.42 aptamer (red line)
binds to the cognate receptor as determined by the higher fluorescence inten-
sity detected on beads. On the contrary, the mutCl.42 aptamer (blue line)
shows a binding similar to the irrelevant aptamer (gray), used as negative
control

previous experiments, Cl.42 aptamer resulted the most abundant se—
quence and its intra—strand loop among the most represented motifs.

3.1 Comparison with other methods
To date, four different tools are available to analyze aptamers
sequences obtained by SELEX and HT—SELEX experiments, i.e.
AptaMotif (Hoinka et al., 2012), AptaCluster (Hoinka et al., 2014),
MPBind (Jiang et al., 2014) and FASTAptamer (Alam et al., 2015).
AptaMotif, the algorithm that inspired APTANI, performs a secon—
dary structure motif analysis on SELEX data but cannot be applied
to HT-SELEX experiments. AptaCluster is a robust method to clus—
ter SELEX and HT-SELEX data, but although extremely efficient in
clustering large aptamer pools, it does not take into account the sec—
ondary structure conformation of the aptamers during the investiga—
tion process. Moreover, the usability of AptaCluster is hampered by
some software dependencies (i.e. MySQL, C—I——I— libraries, etc.) that
require a sound informatics expertise for installation and usage.
MPBind scans aptamer sequences for conserved sub—sequence motifs
and then applies a statistical analysis to define their relevance.
MPBind cannot analyze HT—SELEX data and, although able to
retrieve sub—sequence motifs, no secondary structure analysis is per—
formed during this process. FASTAptamer handles both SELEX and
HT-SELEX data and contains a dedicated tool (named
FASTAptamer Search) that allows searching the aptamer pool for
user—defined sequence motifs. However, FASTAptamer is designed
neither to perform any secondary structure analysis nor to search for
de—novo sub—sequences or sub—structures. Finally, also Galaxy
(https://usegalaxy.org/) NGS—pipelines could, in principle, be applied
for the analysis of HT—SELEX data. As evidenced in Supplementary
Table S2, only AptaCluster and FASTAptamer can analyze HT-
SELEX data; however, we could compared APTANI only to
FASTAptamer, since a compilation error in the C—I——I— code
AptaCluster blocked installation on different Linux distributions.
When applied to the FASTAptamer reference dataset (Ditzler
et al., 2013, APTANI identified as intra—strand loop the asymmetric
loop structures of FASTAptamer original publication (Alam et al.,
2015). Moreover, APTANI retrieved several different sub—
sequences, related to this intra—strand loop, partially overlapping
with the degenerate motifs ArCGUy and CArAr (r and y stand for
any purine and any pyrimidine, respectively) identified by
FASTAptamer (Supplementary Table S3). APTANI was also able to
identify high-populated hairpin loops that FASTAptamer algorithm
was unable to find (Supplementary Table S4). Although both algo—
rithms used <8 GB of RAM, APTANI outperformed FASTAptamer
in terms of computational speed, completing the analysis in about
30 min compared with the 90 min required by FASTAptamer.
Finally, the FASTA format of FASTAptamer output resulted less
intuitive to interpret compared with the tab delimited tables pro—
duced by APTANI.

The main characteristics of the different tools for the analysis
of SELEX data are summarized and discussed in the Supplementary
Information, along with a comparison of their performances.

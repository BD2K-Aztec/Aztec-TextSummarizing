ABSTRACT

Motivation: A molecular interaction network can be viewed as a net-
work in which genes with related functions are connected. Therefore,
at a systems level, connections between individual genes in a molecu-
lar interaction network can be used to infer the collective functional
linkages between biologically meaningful gene sets.

Results: We present the human interactome resource and the gene
set linkage analysis (GSLA) tool for the functional interpretation of bio-
logically meaningful gene sets observed in experiments. GSLA deter-
mines whether an observed gene set has significant functional
linkages to established biological processes. When an observed
gene set is not enriched by known biological processes, traditional
enrichment-based interpretation methods cannot produce functional
insights, but GSLA can still evaluate whether those genes work in
concert to regulate specific biological processes, thereby suggesting
the functional implications of the observed gene set. The quality of
human interactome resource and the utility of GSLA are illustrated with
multiple assessments.

1 INTRODUCTION

A wide range of genome-wide proﬁling technologies has emerged
during the past decade, and these have become a foundation of
current biological research (F arnham, 2009). The challenge is no
longer obtaining the proﬁling data; instead, the challenge is the
interpretation of molecular proﬁles, to elucidate biological mech-
anisms and overcome the ‘curse of spreadsheets’ (Csermely et al.,
2012).

The traditional approach to interpreting a molecular proﬁle is
to focus on a handful of the most signiﬁcantly changed genes.
Because of the noise inherent in proﬁling technologies and the
poor annotation of many genes, this approach has signiﬁcant
limitations (Subramanian et al., 2005). To better interpret the
biological signiﬁcance of a molecular proﬁle, annotation enrich-
ment-based approaches have been developed. These approaches
examine whether members of a gene set deﬁned by an established

biological concept (i.e. an annotation term, typically a biological
process) tend to be enriched in the list of signiﬁcantly changed
genes (Li et al., 2004; McLean et al., 2010) or occur toward the
top/bottom of the ranked list of all genes (Subramanian et al.,
2005). In this manner, these approaches determine whether an
established biological concept (and the gene set deﬁned by it) is
correlated with the molecular proﬁle. Because annotation enrich-
ment-based analyses tend to produce results that are more repro-
ducible and interpretable than individual gene-based analyses
(Subramanian et al., 2005), they have quickly become popular
(Huang da et al., 2009).

However, these approaches are not always useful, as that
‘whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent’
Wittgenstein, 1922). Annotation enrichment-based approaches
examine whether genes that constitute well-established biological
concepts are enriched in a molecular proﬁle. Therefore, these
approaches essentially map the observed molecular proﬁles to
established biological concepts (i.e. deﬁning what these proﬁles
are), and the researchers are left to interpret the functional im-
plications of these molecular proﬁles using their knowledge
regarding the biology of the mapped concepts. For a truly
novel molecular proﬁle that does not have established concepts
to describe it, annotation enrichment-based approaches would
fail to map to established concepts; consequently, researchers
would be unable to appreciate the functional implications of
observing such a proﬁle by examining the ‘identity’ of the proﬁle.

However, it is important to understand the functional impli-
cations of novel molecular proﬁles because novel molecular pro-
ﬁles are often the basis for the introduction of new biological
concepts that expand our knowledge. To meet this analytical
challenge, we developed a tool called gene set linkage analysis
(GSLA), which detects signiﬁcant functional linkages between
‘biologically meaningful gene sets’, i.e. experimentally observed
‘signiﬁcantly changed genes’ and gene sets deﬁned by established
biological concepts. Functional linkages that relate an observed
molecular proﬁle to well-established biological concepts might
assist in interpreting the functional implications of the observed
molecular proﬁle even in a case in which no established concept
can be found to describe (i.e. be enriched in) the observed
molecular proﬁle.

To identify these collective functional linkages between gene
sets, we developed the GSLA tool, which evaluates a largely
homogenous functional interactome, the human interactome re-
source (HIR). Here, ‘homogenous functional interactome’ means
that the functional interactions in the interactome have similar
strengths and represent an unbiased sample of the true (com-
plete) functional interactome. In a homogenous functional

interactome, the density of inter-gene-set interactions will be able
to indicate the overall strength of the functional linkage between
two gene sets. The idea of exploring interaction density for func-
tional inference has been discussed previously (Asur et al., 2007;
Bader and Hogue, 2003; Brun et al., 2004). Based on the cover-
age and reliability of HIR, we designed a pair of tests that val-
idate both the ‘strength’ and the ‘biological signiﬁcance’ of the
observed inter-gene-set interaction density to detect substantial
functional linkage at the gene set level.

In the following sections, we provide a description of our
method for obtaining a largely homogenous functional interac-
tome HIR and the details of our GSLA approach. The quality
of HIR and the utility of GSLA were evaluated in a series of
systematic evaluations and case studies.

2 RESULTS
2.1 Method for constructing a homogenous functional
interactome

GSLA relies on a simple strategy that considers the density of
inter-gene-set interactions as the measure of the overall strength
of the functional linkage between two gene sets. For this simple
strategy to work, the underlining functional interactome needs to
be homogenous, i.e. consist of functional interactions that are of
similar strength and represent an unbiased sample of the true
functional interactome. Obtaining a homogenous functional
interactome is challenging because ‘functional interaction’ is an
umbrella term, that describes diverse types of biological mech-
anisms that connect the functions of two genes. These diverse
types of biological mechanisms are exhibited in diverse types of
data. Functional interactions suggested by only one type of data
are often unable to represent an unbiased sample of the complete
functional interactome.

For example, a protein interaction network is a type of func-
tional interactome in which functional interactions are suggested
by only one type of data—physical protein interactions. The
structure of protein interaction networks has been extensively
studied (Bu et al., 2003; Han et al., 2004). In a typical protein
interaction network, there are clusters of densely interconnected
genes, which are called modules (Han et al., 2004). Network
modules often encode cellular processes (or functions). There
are bridge proteins that connect two modules and mediate the
ﬂow of information between the modules. Therefore, bridges are
effective regulators of modules OK u at al., 2007). For example,
bridges were found to be effective drug targets (Hwang et al.,
2008; Nguyen and Jordan, 2010; Nguyen et al., 2011), and
unique bridges (bottlenecks) were found to be preferential targets
of regulatory microRNAs WVang et al., 2011). The fact that
bridges are effective module regulators indicates that bridges
have strong functional interactions with the proteins in the mod-
ules that they regulate. In the true functional interactome, many
functional interactions are expected between the bridges and pro-
teins in the modules that the bridges regulate. However, in a
protein interaction network, by deﬁnition, bridges interact with
only a few proteins in the modules that the bridges regulate;
proteins that interact extensively with module members are con-
sidered to be module members rather than bridges. In fact, many
bridges that connect two modules have only two interactions,

one interaction with each module. Therefore, the many func-
tional interactions between the bridges and proteins in the mod-
ules that the bridges regulate are underrepresented in a protein
interaction network. This arrangement means that in a protein
interaction network, the number of interactions between a bridge
protein and proteins constituting a bridge-regulated module does
not reﬂect the strength of the functional linkage between this
bridge protein and the cellular process (or function) that is
encoded by the module. Accordingly, the simple strategy of
GSLA that uses inter-gene-set interaction density to measure
the overall strength of the functional linkage between two gene
sets will not work well if bridge proteins are involved in the gene
sets.

One approach to constructing a homogenous functional inter-
actome is to integrate multiple types of data that suggest func-
tional interactions between genes. For example, the functional
interactions between the bridge proteins and the proteins in the
modules that the bridges regulate, which are underrepresented in
protein interaction networks, could be revealed in co-expression
networks or co-evolution networks. However, integrating mul-
tiple types of data is not straightforward because we do not
currently have an intuitive or established way to consistently
and rigorously measure the ‘strength’ of the functional inter-
action suggested by multiple types of data. Therefore, we took
a rather rough approach to measuring the ‘strength’ of a func-
tional interaction. We assume that the strengths of the functional
interactions between the genes that encode physically interacting
proteins were approximately at the same level. Therefore, we
used a statistical learning approach to identify pairs of genes
that are most similar to the pairs of genes that encode physically
interacting proteins, with respect to multiple types of data that
suggest functional interaction. In this manner, we integrated mul-
tiple types of data to infer the functional interactions between
genes, which were expected to represent the true functional inter-
actome in a more unbiased manner. At the same time, these
inferred functional interactions were of similar strengths, approx-
imating the strengths of functional interactions between genes
that encode physically interacting proteins.

Technically, this approach was similar to predicting physical
protein interactions based on evidence of functional association,
which has been previously explored for validating interactions
using unreliable high-throughput experiments (Giot et al., 2003)
or directly predicting novel protein interactions (Basso et al.,
2005). However, in our methodological framework, this
approach was used for a different purpose: implementing a con-
sistent (although not rigorous) measure of the ‘strength of func-
tional interaction’ between two genes when functional
interactions were suggested by multiple types of data.

The workﬂow of our interaction inference procedure is out-
lined in Figure 1 and is detailed in the Supplemental Material. To
train an inference model, a gold-standard example dataset con-
sisting of positive examples (reliably known interactions) and
negative examples (random pairs of proteins) was assembled.
For each example (a protein pair), 25 features (real numbered
values) measuring ﬁve types of data that suggest functional
association were computed. The quality of these features, i.e.
their ability to distinguish positive and negative examples, was
assessed. Then, a support vector machine prediction model was
created to determine the contrast between the feature values in

the positive and the negative examples. This contrast was used to
predict whether an arbitrary pair of proteins was likely to inter-
act based on its feature values. The inference model was evalu-
ated using newly curated interactions in the major data
repositories. Newly curated interactions refer to interactions
that are curated after the time when all of the data that were
used for interaction prediction were collected.

The inferred interactions and the experimentally reported pro-
tein interactions were integrated to create the HIR interactome,
which contains 155 974 non-redundant interactions. Evaluated as
a physical protein interactome, HIR was expected to cover
22.1% of the entire human interactome with a per-interaction
reliability of 41.0%. HIR can be considered a largely homogen-
ous functional interactome. As shown in the Supplemental
Material, the inferred interactions and the experimentally
reported interactions were similar in the overall strength of func-
tional interaction, and the integrated interactome showed an im-
proved representation of functional linkages between the bridge
proteins and the module proteins that the bridges regulate (which
were underrepresented in protein interactions). In addition, a
case study was conducted to illustrate that HIR provided an
up—to-date view of the functional associations between genes.

2.2 Gene set linkage analysis

Based on HIR, the GSLA tool was created to identify functional
linkages between user-deﬁned gene sets (which can represent any
type of biological signiﬁcance) and established GO biological
processes. The functional linkages between the GO biological
processes are pre-computed and searchable on the HIR website.
The topology of the GO biological process network is analyzed

 

in the next section as part of the validation of the GSLA
approach.

GSLA relies on a test of two hypotheses to detect substantial
functional linkages between biologically meaningful gene sets.
The ﬁrst hypothesis (Q1) expects that the inter-gene-set inter-
action density between functionally linked gene sets is higher
than the background interaction density between random
genes. The second hypothesis (Q2) expects that the observed
high density between functionally linked gene sets can be
observed only in the biologically correct interactome, i.e. the
density observed in HIR is higher than the densities observed
in random interactomes consisting of the same genes, with each
gene having the same number of neighbors. Q1 tests the strength
of the functional linkage between two gene sets. Q2 veriﬁes that
the observed strong linkage is a result of the biologically correct
network topology (i.e. our knowledge about the molecular mech-
anisms) rather than a result of the compositions of these two
gene sets. Some genes known as hubs have considerably more
neighbors than other genes. Gene sets that include many hubs
are therefore more likely to connect to other gene sets. Q2 is used
to remove the confounding factor of gene set composition and to
ensure the ‘biological signiﬁcance’ of the detected functional link-
ages between gene sets. Q1 and Q2 are related but different tests.
They complement each other to increase the sensitivity and
speciﬁcity of GSLA.

To test the Q1 hypothesis, the density of the inter-gene-set
interactions is ﬁrst calculated as the observed number of inter-
gene-set interactions divided by the total number of possible
inter-gene-set gene pairs. The number of inter-gene-set inter-
actions was computed as follows. A common gene shared by
two gene sets was treated as two distinct delegate genes, with
each delegate gene belonging to only one gene set. Any gene

Fig. 2. The mean and standard deviation of the expected interaction
density between random genes

that interacted with the shared gene was considered to interact
with both delegate genes in both gene sets. The fact that two gene
sets shared a gene was not by itself considered an inter-gene-set
interaction.

According to the central limit theorem, the expected density of
interactions in a sufﬁciently large number of pairs of genes, N,
follows the normal distribution. As shown in Figure 2, the ex-
pected mean of this normal distribution is the density of the
interactions among all genes (0.0008). The expected standard
deviation approaches 0.0012 with an increase in N in our simu-
lation, where N random gene pairs were sampled 100 000 times
to calculate the mean and standard deviation of the interaction
density. According to these data, a not-very-high inter-gene-set
interaction density of 0.01 translates into a small P-value
(P<10_1°) when the two gene sets both have >20 members
(N Z 400). Functional linkages between two gene sets that are
worthy of experimental investigation are anticipated to be
much stronger than those linkages that marginally pass the sig-
niﬁcance threshold. Therefore, we used a density-based cutoff for
Q1 (density 20.01) in later analyses. P-values were no longer
used because the densities have a more intuitive biological inter-
pretation (the strength of the gene set interaction), and the
P-values for the densities above this cutoff were always
signiﬁcant.

To test the Q2 hypothesis, the HIR interactome was rando-
mized 100 000 times. Suppose that there were two interactions
that involved four genes, G1—G2 and G3—G4. By replacing these
two interactions with two new interactions, G1—G3 and G2—G4,
the topology of HIR is changed, but the gene composition and
the number of neighbors for each gene remain the same. This
type of topology perturbation was performed 100 000 times to
create one random interactome. With 100 000 random interac-
tomes, the P—value for Q2 was computed as the fraction of
random interactomes in which the densities of inter-gene-set
interactions were higher than the density observed in HIR.
A cutoff of P 5 1 x 10—4 was used.

To interpret the biological signiﬁcance of an experimentally
observed molecular proﬁle, we recommend using the top 20—200
‘signiﬁcant’ genes to create a gene set that represents the pheno-
type. The GSLA algorithm outlined earlier in text treats all of the
genes in the same gene set equally. Therefore, using too many

genes will dilute the focus on the most prominent changes. On
the other hand, because proﬁling data are intrinsically noisy and
the interaction network has false positives and false negatives,
using too few genes will not be able to suppress this noise and
take advantage of the corroborative strength of a gene set. In our
experience, using the top 20—200 signiﬁcant genes to represent a
molecular proﬁle usually produced consistent results. In add-
ition, GO biological processes that are functionally linked to
gene sets of such sizes were typically speciﬁc in concept, and
therefore useful for further research. For example, as detailed
in later sections, when interpreting the expression changes
induced by statin treatment, using the top 20, 50, 100 and 200
genes to represent the expression proﬁles produced consistent
results (Supplementary Table S1).

2.3 A functional linkage network connecting GO
biological processes

In general, knowledge concerning the mechanisms of life is orga-
nized in the manner that complex cellular functions arise from
composite coordination between biological processes, which con-
sist of interacting molecules (Lu et al., 2007). Extensive efforts
have been made in the past to deﬁne these biological processes in
terms of their constituent genes. However, the functional coord-
ination between biological processes was poorly deﬁned. For
example, the GO biological processes are arguably the most
popular deﬁnitions of biological processes (Ashburner et al.,
2000). GO provides semantic relationships between biological
processes at different conceptual scales, but it does not provide
the functional linkages between semantically different biological
processes. Therefore, to evaluate whether GSLA could identify
biologically meaningful functional linkages, we computed the
functional linkages between all GO biological processes and ana-
lyzed them. The GO biological process linkage network
(GO-BPLN) produced by GSLA was composed of 38 984 link-
ages that connect 1850 biological processes (Supplementary
Table S2).

In the GO—BPLN, a signiﬁcant proportion of the functional
linkages was supported by semantic similarity or by genes that
were shared between biological processes. Wang et al. proposed
an approach to measure the semantic similarity between two
biological processes, which considered both the number and
the location of their common ancestor processes in the GO
semantic hierarchy WVang et al., 2007). For example, the two
processes ‘translational initiation’ (GO:0006413) and ‘transla-
tional termination’ (GO:0006415) had a semantic similarity
score of 0.61. Using this approach, we computed the average
semantic similarity between processes that were connected in
GO-BPLN. This average semantic similarity was signiﬁcantly
higher than that expected in random biological process networks
that were composed of the same processes, with each process
having the same number of neighbors (0.20 versus 0.13,
P = 1 x 10‘8). These data suggested consistency between the top-
ology of GO—BPLN and the semantic hierarchy of GO. Notably,
not all of the processes connected in GO-BPLN were semantic-
ally similar. In particular, there were 5313 (13.6%) linkages that
connected biological processes that shared no common ancestor
other than the root process (GO:0008150, ‘biological process’).
For example, ‘epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF R)

transactivation by G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling
pathway’ (GO:0035625) was connected to ‘sensory perception’
(GO:0007600). It was shown that epidermal growth factor recep-
tor can be transactivated in a calcium-dependent manner (Zwick
et al., 1997) and that sensory perception involves many G-pro-
tein coupled receptors that regulate calcium levels (Dong et al.,
2001).

On the other hand, in GO—BPLN, 24071 (61.7%) linkages
connected biological processes that shared one or more genes.
This percentage was signiﬁcantly larger than the percentage of
gene-sharing linkages expected in random biological process net-
works that were composed of the same processes, with each pro-
cess having the same number of neighbors (61.7% or 24071
interactions versus 29.5% or 11 518 interactions, P=1 x 10‘3).
These data suggested correlation between the topology of GO-
BPLN and the compositions of these biological processes. It is
important to note that two gene-sharing processes were not ne-
cessarily connected. For example, the ‘activin receptor signaling
pathway’ (GO:0032924) and the ‘cell—cell junction organization
process’ (GO:0045216) shared one gene, but this inter-gene-set
interaction density did not qualify for a substantial functional
linkage at the gene set level. Likewise, two biological processes
that shared no genes were not necessarily disconnected. For ex-
ample, ‘histone H3-K9 methylation’ (GO:0051567) was con-
nected to ‘negative regulation of transcription from RNA
polymerase II promoter’ (GO:0000122). This functional linkage
was supported by the ﬁnding that histone H3 methylation is
associated with transcriptional elongation by RNA polymerase
II (Krogan et al., 2003; Lehnertz et al., 2003), and histone H3K9
methylation is required in siRNA-related centromeric gene silen-
cing, in which centromeric RNA is transcribed by RNA poly-
merase II (Moazed, 2009). Notably, this functional linkage was
identiﬁed based on the inferred functional interactions between
the SETD8, SIRT1 and HDAC family genes (which have the
annotation of negative regulation of transcription from the RNA
polymerase II promoter) and the histone methylation enzyme
SUV39H1. Therefore, successful identiﬁcation of this functional
linkage also suggested the usefulness of including inferred inter-
actions in HIR.

The above results indicated that the topology of the GO-
BPLN inferred by GSLA was consistent with our expectations,
with respect to the semantics and gene compositions of the GO
biological processes. In addition, we also conducted a case study
to show that GSLA identiﬁed biological processes with func-
tional linkages to the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) cascade
process, which were mostly supported by previous research
(Supplemental Material). In short, our evaluation suggested
that GSLA reliably identiﬁed functional linkages between estab-
lished biological processes.

2.4 A case study to illustrate the capability of GSLA to
interpret the functional implications of observing a
gene set in an experiment

In addition to identifying functional linkages between well-estab-
lished biological processes, an important use of GSLA is to sug-
gest the functional implications of observing a gene set in an
experiment by connecting that gene set to established biological
processes. This use of GSLA is illustrated in the following

re-analysis of the expression proﬁles that describe statin-induced
selective apoptosis.

Statins are a family of hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A
reductase inhibitors commonly used to treat patients with hyper-
cholesterolemia. Recently, statins were shown to induce apop-
tosis in a variety of tumor cells, including multiple myeloma
(MM) cells. However, a reduction in cancer risk was observed
only in some, but not all, MM patients undergoing early-phase
clinical trials. Therefore, it was important to understand the se-
lective mechanisms of statin. Clendening et al. reported that four
MM cell lines, H929, KMS11, LP1 and SKMMl, showed
dichotomized responses to lovastatin. H929 and KMS11 were
sensitive, whereas LP1 and SKMMl were not. The statin-
induced expression changes that occurred in these cell lines
were examined using traditional annotation enrichment analysis
(AEA) (Clendening et al., 2010). Their results showed that 22
biological processes were enriched for differentially expressed
genes in the two insensitive cell lines. These processes included
the cholesterol-related metabolic processes, which were consist-
ent with the notion that lovastatin targets the cholesterol biosyn-
thesis pathway, and this pathway was transactivated by its
enzyme-level inhibition. In contrast, in the two sensitive cell
lines, no biological processes were consistently enriched; i.e. the
enzyme-level inhibition of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway
did not induce its expression.

Although AEA revealed the existence of different cellular re-
sponses to lovastatin, it identiﬁed no biological process related to
apoptosis activation. However, the aim of measuring expression
proﬁles before the onset of apoptosis was to identify mechanisms
of statin action that are independent of the general apoptosis
changes (Clendening et al., 2010). For this purpose, AEA
failed to provide useful insight.

The same expression proﬁles were re-analyzed with GSLA.
The top 50 differentially expressed genes were used to deﬁne
the ‘expression phenotype’ of each cell line after lovastatin ex-
posure (Supplementary Table S3). AEA analysis of these pheno-
type gene sets generated the same conclusions as those reported
in the original publication (Supplementary Table S4), which sug-
gested that the top 50 genes from each proﬁle were adequate to
capture the differences between the statin responses in sensitive
and in insensitive cell lines.

GSLA analysis of these phenotype gene sets produced three
notable results (Supplementary Table S4). First, consistent with
AEA, GSLA indicated that cholesterol-related metabolic pro-
cesses were regulated in the insensitive cell lines but not in the
sensitive cell lines. However, unlike AEA, GSLA was able to
indicate that apoptosis-related biological processes were regu-
lated in the sensitive cell lines but not the insensitive cell lines,
which predicted the observed apoptosis behavior of the sensitive
cell lines. In addition, GSLA suggested cell line-speciﬁc biolo-
gical processes that might lead to the activation of apoptosis in
each sensitive cell line. In the KMS11 cell line, toll-like receptor
(TLR) signaling pathways were regulated, whereas in the H929
cell line, Rho/GTPase signaling pathways were regulated. These
processes were known to be regulated by statin in other cell types
and are known triggers of apoptosis (Supplemental Material).

To evaluate the usefulness of GSLA, we also compared two
other analysis tools that interpret the biological signiﬁcance of
experimental observations. The ﬁxed network enrichment

analysis (FNEA) tool (Supplementary Table S5) is another net-
work-based tool that interprets the biological signiﬁcance of an
experimentally observed gene set (Alexeyenko et al., 2012). The
gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) tool (Supplementary Table
S6) is a famous expression analysis tool that analyzes the entire
expression proﬁle instead of the highest altered genes. GSEA
does not use network information. In the scenario of two pheno-
types (treatment/control), GSEA can be considered to be a
simple enrichment analysis, but GSEA uses a score that is similar
to the score of the Kolmogorov—Smirnov test to measure the
enrichment (Subramanian et al., 2005), whereas AEA uses a
hyper-geometric test to measure enrichment (Boyle et al., 2004).
Table 1 shows the ranks of four categories of biological pro-
cesses, which were most likely relevant to this study, in the results
produced by GSLA, AEA, FNEA and GSEA. The four cate-
gories included the apoptosis-related biological processes, which
represented the observed phenotype of statin-sensitive cell
lines; the cholesterol-related metabolic processes, which are the
pharmacological targets of statin action and distinguished the
statin-sensitive/insensitive cell lines in the classical AEA analysis;
and the TLR signaling pathways and the Rho /GTPase signaling
pathways, which were implicated by GSLA as cell line-speciﬁc
routes to active apoptosis (with indirect literature support).
AEA, F NBA and GSLA consistently identiﬁed the cholesterol
metabolic processes as the distinguishing responses between the
sensitive/insensitive cell lines, whereas with GSEA, one of the
sensitive cell lines also showed differential expression in the chol-
esterol metabolic processes (similar to the insensitive cell lines).
In addition, FNEA and GSLA consistently implicated that the
TLR signaling pathways and the Rho/GTPase signaling

pathways were regulated in the statin-sensitive cell lines.
However, only GSLA was able to indicate that the expression
changes of sensitive cell lines implied apoptosis activation.

In summary, this case study illustrated the difference between
GSLA and traditional enrichment analyses. GSLA identiﬁes the
biological processes the members of which have extensive func-
tional interactions to the changed genes that change in an experi-
ment. In other words, GSLA asks the question of what biological
processes these changed genes might together regulate. In con-
trast, enrichment analysis asks the question of what biological
processes constitute the changed genes. In other words, the
GSLA question is about the ‘functional implication’ of the chan-
ged genes, but the enrichment question is about the ‘identity’ of
the changed genes. Traditionally, with enrichment analyses, we
ﬁrst ﬁnd the ‘identity’ of the changed genes in terms of established
biological processes; then, we use our knowledge about these pro-
cesses to manually interpret the ‘functional implications’ of obser-
ving these processes. In contrast, GSLA directly provides the
‘functional implications’ without the need to explicitly deﬁne the
‘identity’ of the changed genes, thereby circumventing the problem
that some sets of changed genes observed in experiments might
not have an ‘identity’ in terms of established biological processes
(‘whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent’).

This case study was chosen to illustrate this difference. All of
the expression proﬁles were measured before the ﬁrst onset of
apoptosis. Therefore, the ‘identity’ of these proﬁles was not
apoptosis. Enrichment analyses, by design, are not expected to
annotate them to apoptosis. AEA analysis of the changed genes
in sensitive cell lines produced biological processes that are rela-
tively general in concept (Supplementary Table S4), which

suggests that these changed genes did not have a good ‘identity’
in terms of conceptually speciﬁc biological processes. Without
such an identity, our knowledge about biological mechanisms
cannot be used to interpret the functional implications of obser-
ving these changed genes. However, statin treatment induced
apoptosis in sensitive cells. Therefore, apoptosis activation is a
biologically important ‘functional implication’ of statin-induced
expression changes. GSLA is designed to detect such functional
implications without the prerequisite to answer the question of
what the changed genes are in terms of established biological
processes.

In addition, in GSLA analysis, functional linkages between
gene sets were supported by functional interactions between
the individual genes in HIR. Approximately 41% of these gene
level interactions represent physical protein interactions
(Supplemental Material). These interactions can provide further
assistance in the design of experiments to conﬁrm the functional
linkages at the gene set level.

2.5 Web interface to HIR and GSLA

The GSLA tool and its supporting HIR interactome have a
uniﬁed Web site (http://www.cls.zju.edu.cn/hir/). A lightweight
graphical network viewer was integrated within the Web site
for visualizing multiple functional interactions between genes
or gene sets. The functional linkages between GO biological
processes are pre-computed and can be searched with GO term
accessions. To link an observation-derived molecular proﬁle to
established biological processes, the phenotype gene set must be
uploaded as a list of HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee
(HGNC) gene IDs. An ID mapping tool is provided for convert-
ing other gene or protein IDs to HGNC IDs. For each identiﬁed
functional linkage between gene sets, the gene level functional
interactions supporting this linkage are provided. All gene level
functional interactions in the HIR interactome can be queried at
the Web site or downloaded as compressed datasets. Functional
interactions can be searched by specifying one or both of their
component genes. Genes can be searched by their speciﬁc IDs or
by sequence. For each functional interaction, the multiple types
of data supporting this interaction are provided along with other
details of this interaction. In addition, although predicting gene
functions with the ‘guilt-by-association’ strategy does not actu-
ally implement the idea of GSLA (see Supplemental Material),
we nevertheless provide the predicted biological process annota-
tions for each gene in HIR to facilitate related research.

3 DISCUSSION

GSLA summarizes functional linkages at the individual gene
level to identify functional linkages at the gene set level.
Therefore, the quality of the reference network has a critical
impact on the usefulness of the approach. The reason why
GSLA produced biologically interesting functional linkages in
our assessments is most likely because GSLA used an interaction
network that has balanced coverage and speciﬁcity.

For example, assuming that we aim to identify functional link-
ages between speciﬁc biological concepts and, in particular, that
we aim to identify functional linkages between two small biolo-
gical processes, each consisting of 20 genes, if 10 functional

interactions between genes in these two processes were good evi-
dence for a biologically interesting gene set interaction, then we
would need a reference network that can cover at least 20% of
the true interactome to observe at least two inter-gene-set func-
tional interactions. In this case, a false-positive rate of only
5 x 10‘3 false interactions per pair of genes would result in two
random false interactions between two 20- gene processes. If HIR
had a false-positive rate this high, such a signal-to-noise ratio
would make it difﬁcult to identify biologically meaningful func-
tional linkages. As detailed in the Supplemental Material, the
interactions in HIR were predicted using data before January
10, 2011. Using new interactions reported after this date, we
estimated that HIR covered 22.1% of the physical human inter-
actome with a per-interaction reliability of 41 .0%. This per-inter-
action reliability corresponds to a false-positive rate of
5.08 x 10‘4 false protein interactions per pair of genes or 0.2
random false protein interactions between two 20-gene processes.
This signal-to-noise ratio was likely to allow the identiﬁcation of
biologically meaningful functional linkages at the gene set level.

Before this work, several other human interactomes have been
developed, e.g. the STRING database (Franceschini et al., 2013)
and the HumanNet (F ranceschini et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2011).
These interactomes were not rigorously assessed for their cover-
age and reliability using newly reported interactions. Typically,
they included half a million interactions or more (>2.5 x 10—3
interactions per pair of genes). In contrast, the rate of yeast pro-
tein interactions is ~1.3 x 10‘3 per pair of genes OK u at al., 2008),
and we estimated in this work that the rate of human interactions
is ~1.5 x 10‘3 per pair of genes (Supplemental Material).
Therefore, the false-positive rates in these interactomes are
likely high, which might not provide sufﬁcient signal-to-noise
ratios for GSLA to identify biologically meaningful gene set
interactions. For example, if HumanNet or STRING was used
in the above statin case study, GSLA would no longer be able to
connect the expression changes in statin-sensitive cells to apop-
tosis-related biological processes.

To further improve our network-powered ‘functional implica-
tion’ interpretation approach, we believe that the bottleneck is
the creation of a high-quality network that can provide a sufﬁ-
cient signal-to-noise ratio for downstream approaches to accur-
ately summarize gene level functional interactions into gene set
level functional linkages. Our approach to building a protein
interaction-like functional interactome shows promise: GSLA
identiﬁed biologically meaningful functional linkages in a series
of assessments. However, this approach is still limited, primarily
because its theoretical basis involves many concepts that are still
poorly deﬁned, particularly the ‘strength’ of a functional inter-
action. We hope that this work inspires future research to deﬁne
a rigorous and consistent measurement of the strength of a func-
tional interaction as suggested by multiple types of data, which is
likely the key to building accurate functional interactomes and
useful network-powered gene set interpretation approaches.

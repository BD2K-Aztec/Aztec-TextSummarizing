ABSTRACT

Summary: Pathway Processor 2.0 is a web application designed to
analyze high-throughput datasets, including but not limited to micro-
array and next-generation sequencing, using a pathway centric logic.
In addition to well-established methods such as the Fisher’s test and
impact analysis, Pathway Processor 2.0 offers innovative methods
that convert gene expression into pathway expression, leading to
the identification of differentially regulated pathways in a dataset of
choice.

Availability and implementation: Pathway Processor 2.0 is available
as a web service at http://compbiotooIbox.fmach.it/pathway
Processor/. Sample datasets to test the functionality can be used
directly from the application.

Bioinformatics online.

1 INTRODUCTION

The advance of high-throughput methods, particularly because
of the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) provides an
unprecedented amount of data from a single experiment.
Although analysis method handling such data has considerably
improved, comparing and especially integrating results between
different platforms and analysis systems is still a challenge.

For these reasons, there is a need for newer methods able to
handle this type of data effectively and in a robust manner.

In recent years, pathway-based approaches have emerged as a
way to compare, integrate and interpret results from different
‘omics’ experiments (Beltrame et al., 2009; Manoli et al., 2006).
In particular, pathway-based approaches can be useful methods
to investigate complex phenotypes (Rizzetto et al., 2010, 2012).
The main advantage of these methods is a greater ease of inter-
pretation and increased comparability among different experi-
ments, methodologies and platforms. Methods using pathways
have evolved considerably as well, starting from the classical
Fisher’s test (Grosu et al., 2002), over more complex systems
such as Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (Subramanian et al.,

2005) and impact analysis (Khatri et al., 2012). In addition,
newer methods have been proposed, which target RNA-seq data-
sets speciﬁcally in addition to microarrays: one of these is the
Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) (Haenzelmann et al.,
2013), which shifts the focus from gene expression to pathway
expression through the generation of enrichment scores.
Although methods like the Fisher’s test are commonly available
in bioinformatics software, more advanced algorithms are often
just part of customized software pipelines, and as such are not
potentially useful to biologists. Also, a part of this software was
developed with microarrays in mind, and while most algorithms
are platform agnostic, often adapting them to newer technologies
requires a considerable effort. Here, we describe Pathway
Processor 2.0, a substantial upgrade over the original Pathway
Processor introduced in 2002 (Grosu et al., 2002). Developed as a
web-based software, Pathway Processor 2.0 aims at using path-
way-based approaches on omics data to extract meaningful and
biologically sound information to support the biological hypoth-
esis being tested. To do so, it offers well-established statistical
methods in addition to a new method to calculate differential
pathway expression between two user-supplied phenotypes.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

Pathway Processor 2.0 was implemented as a web-based ser-
vice, using PHP for the graphical interface and for the analysis
relies on a back-end written using R and Python. The back-end
carries out the pre-processing, analysis and generation of ﬁnal
results, whereas the front-end handles the selection of analysis
type, the input parameters and the display of input and results.
Special care was taken to make the analysis back-end
independent of the input platform and in fact Pathway
Processor 2.0 supports any type of high-throughput data (micro-
array, RNAseq and proteomics).

Pathway Processor 2.0 can analyze high-throughput data
using four different methods, divided by the type of the input
data and the possibility of using custom pathways (Table 1;
Supplementary Data). The Fisher’s test is implemented as
in the original Pathway Processor, but with some important
improvements: in particular, multiple species are supported
(currently human, mouse, rat, yeast and fruit ﬂy) as long as
the supplied identiﬁers for Differentially Expressed Genes
(DEGs) and ‘gene universe’ (the whole list of genes on micro-
array chip or the complete list of genes of the organism under
investigation) are in the correct format (Entrez Gene ID, RefSeq

or gene symbols). Furthermore, in addition to the built-in
KEGG pathway set, any custom gene set can be analyzed, by
uploading an archive ﬁle containing the pathways (or gene sets)
of interest. Visualization of genes over signiﬁcant KEGG path-
ways is also possible (Supplementary Data). The user has to be
aware that the statistical signiﬁcance of the Fisher’s Exact Test is
affected by the size and the connectivity of the gene set tested.
Therefore, the results from this test have to be considered as a
rapid and user-friendly way to discover the biological processes
to be further investigated and veriﬁed experimentally.

The impact analysis method (Draghici et al., 2007; Tarca et al.,
2009), which allows to determine activation or inhibition of path-
ways depending on the alteration of the genes involved and the
topology of the pathways themselves, is implemented in Pathway
Processor 2.0 using the improved version present in the ‘graphite’
R package (Sales et al., 2012), which provides a fully updated
pathway model for KEGG, Reactome and the Pathway
Interaction Database. Currently, impact analysis is limited to
data from Homo sapiens only.

Gene Ontology analysis is implemented through the R
‘topGO’ package, using a weighted algorithm over the whole
Gene Ontology tree to select the signiﬁcant affected nodes
(Alexa et al., 2006).

In all cases, analysis parameters can be adjusted to ﬁne-tune
the results (Supplementary Data), and all data ﬁles produced can
be downloaded from the web server for further analysis. Multiple
test correction procedures are used to control the rate of false
positives (Supplementary Data).

The third analysis offered by Pathway Processor 2.0 is the
application of the recently developed GSVA, coupled with
linear models for differential expression analysis. This method,
given a set of pathways and normalized gene expression data,
allows the transformation of the data into pathway enrichment
scores (a measure of the state of each pathway), generating a
pathway expression matrix. This matrix is then used for a com-
parison of two user-supplied phenotypes of interest using mod-
erated t-tests as implemented in the R package ‘limma’ (Smyth,
2005). The ﬁnal result is a list of Differentially Regulated
Pathways (DRPs; Supplementary Data) that can then be used
to interpret data with a pathway-based view, providing more
information in elucidating complex phenotypes. The GSVA

matrix can also be downloaded, enabling its use in other down-
stream applications.

All the analyses can be run on the web server after uploading
the required ﬁles, without the need for any local installation of
additional software or analysis tools. The software’s perform-
ance is in line with existing solutions (Supplementary Data).

3 CONCLUSIONS

Pathway Processor 2.0 is a useful tool to analyze ‘omics’ datasets,
regardless of the platform that produced them, usable with both
microarays and next-generation sequencing data. The web-based
interface provides a one-stop shop to well-tested bioinformatic
algorithms, and the new methods included in this software enable
interpretation of the data with a true pathway-based view, allow-
ing for deeper insight into complex biological problems.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Binding site identification is a classical problem that is
important for a range of applications, including the structure-based
prediction of function, the elucidation of functional relationships
among proteins, protein engineering and drug design. We describe
an accurate method of binding site identification, namely FTSite. This
method is based on experimental evidence that ligand binding sites
also bind small organic molecules of various shapes and polarity.
The FTSite algorithm does not rely on any evolutionary or statistical
information, but achieves near experimental accuracy: it is capable
of identifying the binding sites in over 94% of apo proteins from
established test sets that have been used to evaluate many other
binding site prediction methods.

Availability: FTSite is freely available as a web-based server at

1 INTRODUCTION

Locating ligand binding sites is of fundamental importance for
a range of applications, such as the structure—based prediction
of function, the elucidation of functional relationships among
proteins, protein engineering and drug design. A number of methods
aimed at ligand binding site identiﬁcation have been developed;
these include geometric analyses, energy calculations, evolutionary
considerations, machine learning and various combinations of these
approaches. Over the years, improvements in methodology have led
to an increase in the success rate of binding site detection as the top
prediction from 52% by SURFNET (Laskowski, 1995) to 83% by
VICE (Tripathi and Kellogg, 2010) for the LIGSITECSC test set of
48 unbound protein structures (Huang and Schroeder, 2006), which
has been used to evaluate many binding site detection methods.
The VICE algorithm (Tripathi and Kellogg, 2010) has not been
implemented as a server, and the best server currently available is
MetaPocket 2.0 (Zhang et al., 2011), which seeks consensus among
eight different methods and reaches 80% accuracy for the unbound
LIGSITECSC test set. Here we describe the energy—based method
FTSite, which is capable of identifying the binding sites with 94%

success rate as the top prediction for the same LIGSITECSC test set,
and has been implemented as a server.

2 METHODS

The premise behind FTSite is that ligand binding sites also bind small
organic molecules of various shapes and polarity, as observed by nucleic
magnetic resonance (NMR) (Hajduk et al., 2005) and X—ray crystallography
experiments (Mattos and Ringe, 1996). The solvent mapping algorithm
(Brenke et al., 2009) in FTSite is a direct computational analog of these
screening techniques. Brieﬂy, computational mapping individually places
each of 16 different small molecular probes (Supplementary Fig. $1) on a
dense grid around the protein and ﬁnds favorable positions using empirical
free energy functions. For each probe type, the individual probes are then
clustered and the clusters are ranked on the basis of the average free energy
(Supplementary Material). Next, consensus clusters are identiﬁed as sites in
which different probe clusters overlap. The consensus clusters are ranked
on the basis of the total number of non—bonded interactions between the
protein and all probes in the cluster. The consensus cluster with the highest
number of contacts is ranked ﬁrst; nearby consensus clusters are also joined
with this cluster. The amino acid residues in contact with the probes of this
newly deﬁned cluster constitute the top ranked predicted ligand binding site
(Fig. 1a). Clusters with fewer contacts deﬁne lower ranked predictions.

3 RESULTS

FTSite was evaluated using apo structures from two test sets of
proteins that have been previously used in the evaluation of other
binding site prediction methods. These test sets are the LIGSITECSC
set (Huang and Schroeder, 2006) and QSiteFinder set (Laurie and
Jackson, 2005). FTSite achieves accuracy rates of 94 and 97% for the
LIGSITECSC and QSiteFinder sets, respectively, when determining
the binding site as the highest ranked consensus site. For each test
set, we employed the same assessment criteria that were used in the
respective previous studies (Supplementary Material). A comparison
to other methods is shown in Figure 1c.

FTSite was able to identify the ligand binding site using only the
top ranked prediction in a number of difﬁcult cases. Two examples
are shown in Figure lb (see the Supplementary Material for other
examples); the ligand from the halo structures is superimposed on
the results of the apo structures for comparison. In both cases,
conformational differences between the halo and apo structures
make binding site detection difﬁcult. In the case of ,B—amylase, the
loop formed by residues V99, G100 and D101 closes down on the
ligand in the halo form, yielding a better deﬁned ligand binding site.
Similarly, in the apo form of HIV—2 protease the ligand binding site

is very open, and becomes well formed only upon ligand binding.
Despite the poorly deﬁned binding sites present in the apo structures
of these two proteins, FTSite identiﬁes the binding site as the top
ranked prediction.

4 DISCUSSION

Key to the success of FTSite is the use of multiple molecular probes
rather than a single probe as implemented in most other energy—
based methods. Screening by NMR and X—ray crystallography
shows that the binding sites of proteins possess a tendency to bind
small organic compounds that vary in size, shape and polarity,
thus improving the robustness of FTSite to conformational changes.
Although individual probes may bind to other cavities, the largest
clusters of multiple probes occur in ligand binding sites (Hajduk
et al., 2005). Thus, FTSite does not rely on surrogate measures of
ligand—binding propensity such as pocket volume, cavity depth or the
ability of binding non—polar spheres. Due to its strong biophysical
basis, the method provides high accuracy without evolutionary
considerations. We note that solvent mapping also had success in
identifying druggable binding sites in protein—protein interfaces
(Kozakov et al., 2011).

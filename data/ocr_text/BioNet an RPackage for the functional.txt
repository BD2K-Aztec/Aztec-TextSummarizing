ABSTRACT

Motivation: Increasing quantity and quality of data in transcri-
ptomics and interactomics create the need for integrative
approaches to network analysis. Here, we present a comprehensive
R-package for the analysis of biological networks including an exact
and a heuristic approach to identify functional modules.

Results: The BioNet package provides an extensive framework for
integrated network analysis in R. This includes the statistics for
the integration of transcriptomic and functional data with biological
networks, the scoring of nodes as well as methods for network
search and visualization.

Availability: The BioNet package and a tutorial are available from

1 INTRODUCTION

Integrated analysis of microarray data in the context of biological
networks such as protein—protein interaction (PPI) networks has
become a major technique in systems biology. The primary
objective is the identiﬁcation of functional modules (signiﬁcantly
differentially expressed subnetworks) within large networks. This
can be achieved by computing a score for each node in the
network reﬂecting its functional relevance. Subsequently, a network
search algorithm is required to ﬁnd the highest scoring subgraph.
In fact, this problem has been proven to be NP—hard (Ideker
et al., 2002). Various heuristic approaches have been proposed,
most of them inspired by the seminal work from Ideker et al.
(2002) that used a simulated annealing heuristic to identify high—
scoring sub graphs in integrated networks. Recently, we have devised
an algorithm (heinz, heaviest induced subgraph) that computes
provably optimal and suboptimal solutions to the maximal—scoring
subgraph (MSS) problem in reasonable running time using integer
linear programming (ILP) (Dittrich et al., 2008). In extension
to this, we present an R package for (i) integrating multiple
P—Values obtained from different experiments, (ii) scoring the nodes
of the network by a modular scoring function, (iii) calculating

2 DESCRIPTION

The BioNet package provides a comprehensive set of methods
for the integrated analysis of gene expression data and biological
networks. P—Values are distributed uniformly under null hypotheses.
Therefore, as a ﬁrst step, multiple P—Values derived from the
analysis of different experiments (e. g. t—test or regression models)
can be aggregated using a uniform order statistics (aggerals)
(Dittrich et al., 2008). The resulting distribution of combined
P—Values can be considered as a mixture of signal and noise,
where the signal component is modelled to be Beta(a,l) distributed
(Pounds and Morris, 2003). The model ﬁt can be veriﬁed by
the provided diagnostic plots (plot .bum, hist . bum). By
ﬁtting a beta—uniform mixture (BUM) model (fitBumModel),
the maximum—likelihood estimates for the mixture model can be
obtained. These parameters are subsequently used to score the nodes
of the network (scoreNodes , scoreFunction). The adjusted
node score is given by (a—l)(log(x)—log(t(FDR))), where 1'
denotes the threshold for a given false discovery rate (FDR). The
optimal and heuristic solutions of the M88 can be calculated by
runHeinz , runFastHeinz. Bioconductor data structures and
classes (Gentleman et al., 2004) of the graph packages graph,
RBGL as well as igraph are supported (Carey et al., 2005; Csardi
and Nepusz, 2006). Networks can be imported and exported in
different formats, allowing a smooth data exchange with standard
network analysis tools like Cytoscape (Shannon et al., 2003).

3 APPLICATION

We apply our package to gene expression data from diffuse large
B—cell lymphomas (DLBCL) and survival data (Rosenwald et al.,
2002) with a human PPI network based on human protein reference
database (HPRD; Prasad et al., 2009) as described in Dittrich et al.
(2008). The data consist of 112 tumors with the germinal center
B—like phenotype (GCB) and 82 tumors with the activated B—like
phenotype (ABC) and includes information on patient survival.
All data are available in the BioNet and DLBCL package. We
use standard microarray analysis and Cox regression to obtain
gene—wise P—Values for differential expression and risk association,

The exact search algorithm can be started from R by runHeinz
if the CPLEX library is installed (Dittrich et al. , 2008). Alternatively,
the fast heuristic search algorithm (runFas tHe inz) often delivers
a close approximation. Finally, the resulting modules can be
visualized in 2D or 3D.

BioNet captures an interaction module that has been described
to play major biological roles in the GCB and ABC DLBCL

subtypes (Fig. 1C). The combination of biological and clinical
data with PPI networks generates a meaningful biological context
in terms of functional association for differentially expressed,
survival—relevant genes.

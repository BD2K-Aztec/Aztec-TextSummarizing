ABSTRACT

Motivation: Analysis of millions of pyro-sequences is currently playing
a crucial role in the advance of environmental microbiology.
Taxonomy-independent, i.e. unsupervised, clustering of these
sequences is essential for the definition of Operational Taxonomic
Units. For this application, reproducibility and robustness should be
the most sought after qualities, but have thus far largely been
overlooked.

Results: More than 1 million hyper-variable internal transcribed spacer
1 (ITS1) sequences of fungal origin have been analyzed. The ITS1
sequences were first properly extracted from 454 reads using general-
ized profiles. Then, otupipe, cd-hit-454, ESPRIT-Tree and DBC454, a
new algorithm presented here, were used to analyze the sequences. A
numerical assay was developed to measure the reproducibility and
robustness of these algorithms. DBC454 was the most robust, closely
followed by ESPRIT-Tree. DBC454 features density-based hierarch-
ical clustering, which complements the other methods by providing
insights into the structure of the data.

1 INTRODUCTION

Environmental microbiology has advanced greatly in the past
few years with the advent of next-generation sequencing
technologies. A microbial community can now be sampled by
the exhaustive sequencing of the PCR products obtained from a
carefully chosen pair of primers. Currently, the Roche 454 pyro-
sequencing is the favored technology because it produces
relatively long and sufﬁciently numerous reads at an acceptable
cost. However, pyro-sequences suffer from a non-negligible rate
of error (Huse et al., 2007), which often affects the sequence
regions in which a given nucleotide is repeated several times.

In this study, we have used a dataset of the fungal internal
transcribed spacer l (ITS1) coming from soil samples obtained

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

from 198 different locations in the western Swiss Alps. Each
location represented a 4m2 of grassland. The locations were
selected by following a random-stratiﬁed design and, thus, are
distributed over a great variety of soil types and altitudes.
Overall, more than a million pyro-sequences have been obtained,
with the aim of identifying how biotic and abiotic factors inﬂu-
ence the fungal diversity at different scales. Ecological results of
this study will be reported elsewhere, the focus of this article
being to introduce a novel classiﬁcation method capable of
robustly analyzing this large-scale dataset.

There are currently three taxonomy-independent, i.e. unsuper-
vised, clustering algorithms that can determine Operational
Taxonomic Units (OTUs) on a large scale, say in the range of
a million of pyro-sequences. These algorithms are cd-hit-454
(Niu et al., 2010), otupipe (Edgar, 2010; Edgar et al., 2011)
and ESPRIT-Tree (Cai and Sun, 2011). They have been recently
reviewed and numerically benchmarked (Sun et al., 2012) in an
article that constitutes an excellent introduction to the ﬁeld of
taxonomy-independent microbial community analysis and that
summarizes what is the state of art in the field.

Here, we introduce DBC454, a density-based hierarchical clus-
tering algorithm that departs on several points from the previ-
ously mentioned ones. It was designed with the following
requirements in mind: it should (i) determine the optimal
number of clusters, (ii) properly separate arbitrarily shaped dis-
tributions, (iii) not be affected by the order in which the data are
presented, (iv) be robust and resistant to noise (e.g. not assign
outliers to clusters), (v) use intuitive-free parameters, (vi) be cap-
able of clustering millions of observations in thousands of clus-
ters and (vii) return a solution in a reasonable amount of time.

We also introduce a new numerical benchmark for unsuper-
vised clustering algorithms, which measures their robustness with
respect to the errors that are likely to affect the input sequences.

2 METHODS

2.1 Source material

Fungal ITS1 sequences were obtained from 198 soil samples
gathered from 4m2 plots in grasslands along wide soil and alti-
tudinal gradients in the western Swiss Alps (Dubuis et al., 2012).
From each plot, five subsamples of 250 mg soil samples were
taken, from which DNA was extracted and used for fungi bar-
coding using the Roche Genome Sequencer FLX Titanium 454

System. The technical details of this experiment will be described
in another paper. In total, 1649 376 reads were generated, of
which 1 152121 were full-length ITS1 sequences (see below).

2.2 Extraction of full-length fungal ITSl

Two generalized proﬁles of a length of ~50 residues were built
with the PFTOOLS v2.3 package (Luthy et al., 1994; Sigrist
et al., 2002) (http://web.expasy.org/pftools) to recognize the
highly conserved regions that ﬂank the ITS1 regions, located at
the end of the 18S rRNA and at the beginning of the 5.8S rRNA,
respectively (Fig. 1). These proﬁles were manually edited to pro-
duce global matches on the proﬁle side and local matches on the
sequence side. In addition, because of the early termination of
many pyro-sequences in the 18S region, the proﬁle scoring
system at the corresponding extremity (left of proﬁle 1 on
Fig. l) was modiﬁed to permit the termination of the alignment
at the end of the sequence while within the proﬁle. As far as we
know, the generalized proﬁle as implemented in the PFTOOLS
v2.3 package remains the only sequence alignment method that
permits such a degree of detail in the design of an alignment
scoring system for DNA sequences. The two proﬁles were
calibrated on shufﬂed 454 reads to determine the most appropri-
ate score thresholds (Pagni and Jongeneel, 2001). The pyro-se—
quences were searched independently with both proﬁles, and
when both were matching on a sequence, the ITS1 was deﬁned
as the intervening sequence between them. With this strategy,
1 152121 full-length ITS1 were recovered, among which
341 585 were unique, out of the l 649 376 raw pyro-sequences.

The same proﬁle-based search strategy was applied on the
FUN, PLN, ENV and INV sections of the release 109 of the
EMBL: both strands were searched and 127 577 intervening se-
quences with a length from 1 to 500 nt were retained as ITS1 to
constitute a reference dataset. The biological conclusions drawn
with the latter sequences will be discussed in the companion
paper.

The only drawback of this proﬁle-based extraction is that it
rejects the ITS1 that do not have enough of the 18S region
sequenced, i.e. <20 nt. Hence, the longer ITS1 are likely to be
under-sampled, given the observed distribution of the lengths of

the raw 454 reads (not shown). In contrast, this eliminates the
difﬁculties linked to the analysis of incomplete sequences, which
is especially relevant here, as one will only use algorithms that
rely explicitly or implicitly on global sequence alignments.

2.3 Computer programs and parameters

The DBC454 algorithm is presented in Section 3. DBC454 was
run using default parameter values (23 steps, using starting and
ending distances of 3.317 and 7.141, respectively). We also tested
ﬁve alternate starting distance levels (3.464, 3.606, 3.873, 4.000
and 4.243). The resulting partitions of the data are named dbc—sO
for the default parameters and dbc-sl to dbc-s6 for the alternate
starting levels.

cd—hit-454 v4.5.4 was run using default parameters, but
different values were tested for the sequence identity threshold:
98, 97, 95 and 90%. The resulting partitions of the input data are
designated as cdh-98, cdh-97, cdh—95 and cdh—90, respectively.

otupipe v9, with usearch v5.1.22l, was run using default par-
ameters, and with different values (98, 97, 95 and 90%) for
PCTID_ERR, PCTID_OTU and PCTID_BIN parameters.
The resulting partitions of the input data are designated as
otu-98, otu-97, otu-95 and otu-90, respectively.

ESPRIT-Tree 11152011 was obtained from the author Yjun
Sun and run using default parameters, which produces a hier-
archical clustering with 15 levels. By cutting this hierarchy at
different heights, one can obtain 15 different partitions of the
data. These are named etr-OO to etr—l4 (from lower to higher
levels).

The sequences of every cluster were aligned using mafft
(Katoh and Standley, 2013), and the cluster ‘radius’ was com-
puted as the average of the percent divergences of every sequence
pairs in the cluster.

Perl and R scripts were extensively and creatively used
throughout this study to re—format, glue together and analyze
all the data.

2.4 Robustness benchmark

Artiﬁcially mutated versions of the ITS1 dataset were created
using the msbar program from the EMBOSS suite (Rice et al.,
2000). To simulate the errors that occur during the 454 sequen-
cing, we followed the quantitative analysis of Huse et al. (2007).
Brieﬂy, 18% of the original sequences were randomly selected,
and among them, 61% were given a single error, 17% two errors
and 22% three errors. The types of errors introduced were inser-
tions, deletions or substitutions in 46, 33 and 21% of the cases,
respectively. We repeated this procedure ﬁve times, to obtain ﬁve
distinct versions of the mutated dataset.

Two different partitions of the same dataset (e.g. from two
different algorithms), or the partitions of two related datasets
(e.g. original versus mutated with the same algorithm), were
compared by computing the adjusted Rand index (ARI;
Hubert and Arabie, 1985) with the R package ‘clues’.

2.5 Accuracy benchmark

For every algorithm, the 1 152121 ITS1 were clustered together
with the 127 577 reference ITS1 previously extracted from the
EMBL. The taxa of EMBL entries at the species, genus and

family ranks were assigned whenever possible using the NCBI
taxonomy. Reference sequences corresponding to environmental
samples and uncultured organisms were clustered, but not used
to assess the accuracy.

3 RESULTS
3.1 The DBC454 algorithm

3.1.] The choice of a metric The DBC454 algorithm requires
that every sequence be represented as a point in an n-dimensional
space with integer coordinates. Then, the algorithm relies on the
computation of the Euclidian distance between two points X and

Y, deﬁned by
d(X,Y) = 112(1)? — Yi)2
i=1

Although sequences are often believed to ‘live in some pseudo-
metric space’ (Cai and Sun, 2011), there is no generally accepted
manner to encode a sequence as a point in an n-dimensional
space. Regarding our speciﬁc problem with fungal ITS1, which
are nucleotide sequences with a length between ~50 and 300 nt, a
relatively simple encoding was investigated and proved a posteri-
ori to be successful.

The simplest encoding is certainly to count the numbers of A,
C, G and T of a sequence and to represent it as a point in a four-
dimensional space. Obviously, this is a poor encoding, as it is
likely that two distinct sequences of the same length can share the
same nucleotide composition. However, this principle of encod-
ing can be improved by increasing the number of dimensions, for
example, by counting the number of adjacent dinucleotides,
which encode a sequence as a point in a l6-dimensional space.
The encoding used by DBC454 goes one step further, also count-
ing all the dinucleotide separated by one or two residues. Thus,
every sequence is encoded as a point in a 48-dimensional space.
For example, the dinucleotide counts for the sequence ATAATA
are AT=2, TA=2, AA: 1; the counts for dinucleotide sepa-
rated by one nucleotide are A?A=2, T?A= l, A?T= 1; counts
for those separated by two nucleotides are A??A=2, T??T= l;
and all the other counts are zero. In theory, this encoding strat-
egy does not exclude that two unrelated sequences of the same
length can share exactly the same encoding. However, we have
never observed such a case while working with real data. In
contrast, the DBC454 encoding has also some interesting proper-
ties, particularly regarding the comparison of pyro-sequences,
which are especially prone to insertion/deletion errors that
affect repeated stretches of a given nucleotide. The examples
given in Table 1 illustrate that the metric featured by DBC454
is, for example, less sensitive to this type of errors than a metric
based on pairwise sequence identity. This is also somehow rem-
iniscent of the ﬂowgram comparison of pyro-sequences that have
been used by previous authors (Quince et al., 2009).

3.1.2 Density-based hierarchical clustering The DBC454
algorithm depends on two essential parameters: N, the minimal
number of points that are required to ﬁnd a valid cluster; and a’,
the maximal distance between two points for them to be
connected together. For a given distance threshold a’, all the

points that can be connected together will form a valid cluster
if their count reaches, or exceeds, N. Taken together, the N and a’
parameters implicitly specify the density constraint that is placed
on the deﬁnition of a valid cluster. However, no constraint is
placed on the ‘shape’ of a cluster, in that it can be compact and
spherical, doughnut shaped or thread shaped. For DBC454,
there is no such thing as a cluster ‘center’ as deﬁned for classical
hierarchical clustering algorithms, nor of a cluster seed, as im-
plemented in cd-hit-454 and otupipe. Furthermore, as all dis-
tances are evaluated, independent runs of the algorithm on the
same dataset provide the exact same partition, independently of
the sequence order.

For a’ = 0, no clusters are returned, unless a unique sequence is
present at least N times in the input dataset. For a’=oo, there
exists only a single cluster containing all the sequences. A
ﬂowchart of the algorithm is presented in Figure 2. The hierarch-
ical clustering starts by providing DBC454 with a low value for
a’, which is progressively increased by a user-speciﬁed amount up
to the greatest distance value desired. As a’ increases, three
observations can be made: (i) new clusters with at least N
sequences can be discovered; (ii) existing clusters can grow; and
(iii) existing clusters can merge. Eventually, a tree of merge
events, i.e. a hierarchical clustering, is obtained, and it is possible
to retrace the order (according to a’), in which the clusters have
been discovered. Figure 3 presents a typical example of a clus-
tering hierarchy observed in the ITS1 dataset. In addition, it is
possible to retrieve the level a’ at which a sequence ﬁrst entered
the classiﬁcation. This is a convenient way to distinguish the
sequences that are representative of the core of a cluster (i.e.
they entered the hierarchy at a low a’ value), from outlier
sequences that entered at a greater a’ value. When the clustering
is stopped at the largest a’ value, the sequences that have not been
attributed to any cluster are considered to be noise.

3.1.3 Re—assignment t0 the final partition The ﬁnal number of
clusters is taken as equal to the number of leaves found in the
hierarchical clustering, independently of the level a’ at which the
leaf has appeared. The sequences placed in the leaf clusters

account for only a fraction of all the sequences, but represent the
core of the classiﬁcation. The cluster sizes tend to increase while
climbing every branch of the tree. The particular clusters found
just before their ﬁrst merging event will be referred to as the seed
clusters and are shown in gray in Figure 3. At the end of the
clustering process, the seed clusters are used to attract and re—as-
sign the sequences that entered the clustering hierarchy in a
branch above the ﬁrst merge event. More precisely, this re—as-
signment is based on the shortest distance between the sequence
to re—assign and every sequence already placed in seed clusters.
When all the sequences have been assigned to a cluster, or left
in the noise, DBC454 can optionally process a set of reference
sequences supplied by the user, and assigns them to the closest
cluster at the proper a’ value. Only reference sequences sufﬁ-
ciently close to an already established cluster are retained, and
all the other reference sequences are rejected as noise. Again, the
level at which a reference sequence enters the hierarchy is indi-
cative of how close this sequence is to the core of the cluster.
When taxonomically curated sequences are used for this optional
last step, this allows the annotation of the clusters. By separating
the reference sequences (if any) from the main dataset, one en-
sures that they will not contribute to the cluster discovery and

thus alter the results. However, to ease the comparison of the
algorithms in the accuracy analysis (see below), this feature was
not used (e.g. the whole dataset, including the reference
sequences, was clustered all at once).

3.2 Number of clusters and percentage of classiﬁed
sequences

The goal of this study was to identify how the environmental
factors inﬂuence the fungal diversity at a large geographic scale
from a particularly large number of samples. Thus, within this
project, it was essential to consider the dominant species and not
the rare ones. In other words, clusters should contain a repre-
sentative number of members to be worth considering in subse-
quent ecological analyses. In our example of ITS1 sequences
generated from 198 geographically different sites, we decided
that this minimum number will be 100 (roughly the half of the
number of the geographic plots considered in the project). Note
that this number corresponds to <0.01% of the total number of
sequences. Thus, for DBC454, the minimal number of sequences
to seed a cluster was set to 100 (N: 100). We have applied the
same condition to ﬁlter the results of all the other algorithms at
the post-processing stage, i.e. all the sequences from clusters
smaller than 100 were pooled as noise.

Figure 4 summarizes the number of clusters that was found by
each algorithm, as well as the percentage of classiﬁed sequences,
i.e. not assigned to the noise. DBC454 and ESPRIT-Tree tend to
classify more sequences in a smaller number of clusters than
cd—hit-454 and Otupipe. For each algorithm, the number of clus-
ters decreases and the number of classiﬁed sequences increases
when the clustering parameters are relaxed. This effect is the least
pronounced with DBC454. An analysis of the average radius of
the clusters discovered shows that DBC454 radii are in the range
of those obtained with cd-hit-454 and otupipe. ESPRIT-Tree
spans a much larger range of cluster radii.

3.3 Robustness analysis

In our view, the most important criterion to evaluate a method of
clustering metagenomic data is robustness. Ideally, if an experi-
ment is repeated, e.g. if the same samples are re—sequenced, one
hopes to retrieve exactly the same cluster structure/OTU deﬁn-
ition. In other words, the ﬁnal partition should be resistant to the
errors that actually occur during the sequencing. To measure this
quantitatively, we have designed the following numerical bench-
mark. Five ‘mutated’ datasets were derived from the original
dataset, by introducing typical 454 sequencing errors
(Huse et al., 2007). See Section 2 for details. We performed the
clustering with each one of the ﬁve mutated datasets, and com-
pared the partition obtained with the original one. The measure
of robustness was given by the ARI, which equals 1 when two
partitions are identical and approaches 0 when the partitions are
random with respect to each other.

As explained earlier, we were only interested in clusters
containing at least 100 sequences. Thus, before proceeding with
the ARI computation, two distinct treatments can be applied to
the sequences left in the noise: (i) consider the noise as a single
additional cluster; and (ii) reject from the analysis all the
sequences that appear in the noise in either one of the two com-
pared partitions. Figure 5A presents the numerical results

distance 4.359 and one at distance 5.099. The so-called seed clusters are represented in gray. They are the larger clusters found in a branch, just before the
ﬁrst merge event, and play a pivotal role for the post-assignment of the sequences that enter the classiﬁcation at a higher level

ter: DBC454 is clearly the most robust method, but ESPRIT-
Tree also achieves a good robustness for some intermediate tree-
depth values. Figure 5B presents the results, while ignoring the
sequences that are unclassiﬁed (e. g. appear in the noise) in either
one of the two compared partitions. The ARI values are, on
average, improved, but the global picture of the comparison of
different algorithms remains the same. It should be noted that
cd-hit-454 and otupipe are especially sensitive to sequencing
errors when their default parameters are used.

3.4 Comparison of the different partitions

Figure 6 shows the results of the comparison of the dbc-s0 par-
tition with the partitions obtained with all the other methods.
The DBC454 partitions appear insensitive to the starting distance
parameter. Regarding ESPRIT-Tree, the partition etr-04 appears
remarkably similar to dbc-s0 (ARI: 0.88 and 0.95 when noise is
or is not considered, respectively). Noticeably, etr-04 was

previously shown to be one of the most robust partitions pro-
duced by ESPRIT-Tree (Fig. 5).

We have conducted a detailed investigation into the discrepan-
cies that exist between the dbc-s0 and etr-04 partitions. Multiple
sequence alignments of homologous ITS1 were produced and
analyzed using phylogenetic trees and multidimensional scaling
(Borg and Groenen, 2005). These strongly suggest to us that both
algorithms are essentially producing coherent classiﬁcations of
the sequences, but sometimes they produce clusters with distinct
levels of granularity.

3.5 Accuracy analysis

Another round of clustering was performed on an extended data-
set consisting of the previously investigated ITS1 sequences plus
127 577 reference ITS1 from the EMBL, for which the taxa at the
species, genus and family ranks were obtained from the NCBI
taxonomy. It must be noted that most of the reference ITS1
ended up in the noise, i.e. in clusters with less than 100 members,

Fig. 7. Analysis of the clustering accuracy at the family (white), genus
(gray) and species (black) ranks for the various algorithms tested, using
the NCBI taxonomy as an external reference

3365 (62), 3709 (113) and 4022 (1122) sequences (taxa) for
family, genus and species, respectively. We used the NCBI
taxonomy as the reference partition, and computed the ARI
for each partition. Our results (Fig. 7) show that overall, each
method behaves similarly, albeit poorly. In particular, the accur-
acy achieved at the species rank is clearly worse than at the other
taxonomic ranks. This might reﬂect the fact that the ITS1 itself,
considering the sequencing errors, is not informative enough to
reliably assign the species rank. cdh-98, otu-90 and etr-l2 have
the best accuracy at the species, genus and family ranks, respect-
ively. However these partitions are not among the most robust,
as shown previously. We are aware that such an accuracy ana-
lysis is delicate, as it depends both on the investigated dataset
and on the quality of the reference taxonomy. This analysis is
certainly not devoid of a circularity problem, as part of the ref-
erence fungal taxonomy used here was likely established using
numerical methods that convey implicit or explicit assumptions
on the deﬁnition of a fungal taxon.

3.6 Computation times

The computational complexity of DBC454 is quadratic with the
number of sequences and proportional to the number of levels, in
the worst case. The algorithm is fully deterministic and has been
parallelized with MPI to run up to 256 CPUs. Actual perform-
ance depends on the nature of the dataset. For the dataset
reported in this article, all computation times were determined
on Intel E5540 Xeon CPU at 2.53 GHz. The computation of the
partition of the 1 152 121 input sequences by cd-hit-454 and otu-
pipe both took ~5 min. The DBC454 computation was executed
in parallel on 16 CPUs and took ~l3min (wall clock time),
which actually corresponds to a total of 3.6 h of CPU to generate
a hierarchical classiﬁcation with 23 different levels (i.e. ~10 min
per level). ESPRIT-Tree required ~9 h of CPU to generate a
hierarchical classiﬁcation with 15 levels.

When considering the mutated dataset, the average computa-
tion times increased by 69% (cd-hit-454), 48% (otupipe), 61%
(ESPRIT-tree) and 90% (DBC454). This can be explained by the
number of unique sequences that are increased in the mutated
datasets compared with the original one.

4 DISCUSSION

The use of generalized proﬁles for deﬁning the hyper-variable
ITS1 by its highly conserved ﬂanking regions alleviates most of
the sensitivity problems encountered with pattern-based search
methods (Bellemain et al., 2010), including sequencing errors,
such as indels. In addition, this permits the recovery of all the
ITS1 from the EMBL, irrespective of the particular primers that
have been used by the original authors.

DBC454 relies on an arbitrarily deﬁned encoding of every
sequence as a point in a 48-dimensional space. When this encod-
ing is used for hierarchical density-based clustering, an especially
robust partition of the input sequences is obtained, which a pos-
teriori corroborates its relevance.

DBC454 uses density-based clustering to identify groups of
related sequences that are naturally dense in the input dataset.
As a density-based method, DBC454 places no constraints on the
cluster shape and radius, and has no concept of a cluster center.
In contrast to all the other algorithms considered here, which
remove the redundancy among the sequences as an initial step,
DBC454 explicitly uses this information for the clustering
(see the note on ESPRIT-Tree below). One of the unintuitive
aspects of density-based clustering is that its performance tends
to improve with the size of the input dataset, contrary to many
other clustering approaches. Our results show that this approach
leads to especially robust partitions without being detrimental to
the overall accuracy.

This study demonstrates that DBC454 and ESPRIT-tree (at a
carefully chosen level) are currently the two most robust methods
for the deﬁnition of OTUs in the dataset we have studied. The
partitions produced by these two methods are only slightly dif-
ferent and essentially compatible. The key observation here is
that DBC454 and ESPRIT-Tree rely on completely different
algorithmic approaches. This indicates that both methods are
actually capable of ‘recognizing’ the same structure in the input
dataset, which is an encouraging result regarding the future
reproducibility of the experiments in the ﬁeld of metagenomics.
It must be noted that the ESPRIT-Tree algorithm also includes a
‘density-sensitive’ computation step, i.e. the weighting scheme
that is used to update the probabilistic sequences at level greater
than 0 (Cai and Sun, 2011). This might help to explain the con-
vergent results obtained for DBC454 and ESPRIT-Tree.

Recently, much attention has been placed on the beneﬁts of
‘denoising’, i.e. correct the suspected sequencing errors of the
pyro-sequences before performing the taxonomy-independent
analysis itself (Bonder et al., 2012). Considering their particular
sensitivity to the sequencing errors demonstrated here, this rec-
ommendation obviously makes sense when cd-hit-454, otupipe
or ESPRIT-Tree (at the lowest level) is used for the clustering
analysis. However, the introduction of an additional pre—process-
ing step implies the optimization of additional parameters and
has a cost in terms of CPU, which is currently prohibitive for
large datasets. Instead of requiring two successive steps
(‘denoising’ followed by clustering), we have shown here that

the clustering process itself can be used at the same time to pro-
duce a robust partition (insensitive to sequencing errors) and to
identify the outlier sequences, i.e. those that were pooled as
‘noise’ in this article.

Abstract

Motivation: A standard approach to classifying sets of genomes is to calculate their pairwise
distances. This is difficult for large samples. We have therefore developed an algorithm for rapidly
computing the evolutionary distances between closely related genomes.

Results: Our distance measure is based on ungapped local alignments that we anchor through
pairs of maximal unique matches of a minimum length. These exact matches can be looked up
efficiently using enhanced suffix arrays and our implementation requires approximately only 1 s
and 45 MB RAM/Mbase analysed. The pairing of matches distinguishes non-homologous from
homologous regions leading to accurate distance estimation. We show this by analysing simulated
data and genome samples ranging from 29 Escherichia coli/Shigella genomes to 3085 genomes of
Streptococcus pneumoniae.

Availability and implementation: We have implemented the computation of anchor distances
in the multithreaded UNIX command-line program andi for ANchor Distances. C sources and
documentation are posted at http://github.com/evolbioinf/andi/

1 Introduction

 

The spread of infectious diseases is nowadays often monitored by
sequencing the genomes of the outbreak strains. Since a given pan-
demic is usually caused by the rapid expansion of a single clone,
monitoring by sequencing leads to the accumulation of hundreds to
thousands of similar genome sequences. For example, Petty et al.
(2014) studied the spread of the multi-drug resistant Escherichia coli
strain ST131, which causes extra-intestinal infections in humans.
The authors sequenced 99 outbreak strains and reconstructed their
phylogeny. This revealed that the outbreak was caused by a single
lineage of ST131. On an even larger scale, Chewapreecha et al.
(2014) studied pneumococcal carriage in a refugee camp by

sequencing 3085 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, which causes
pneumoniae in humans. Again, phylogeny reconstruction based on
these genomes was an early step in the study.

Classifying bacteria by clustering their genomes is set to become
routine. For this purpose, Petty et al. (2014) computed a multiple se-
quence alignment of their E.colz' ST131 strains using the program
mugsy (Angiuoli and Salzberg, 2011). It is based on the MUMmer
software (Kurtz et al., 2004), which makes mugsy one of the fastest
multiple genome aligners available: it took only 19 h to align 5 7
complete E.coli genomes. However, the run time of mugsy becomes
unacceptable when applied to the recently collected samples of hun-
dreds or even thousands of bacterial genomes.

B. Haubold et al.

 

For their study of 3085 pneumococcal isolates, Chewapreecha
et al. (2014) mapped the sequencing reads onto a reference genome,
thereby approximating a multiple sequence alignment. Such align-
ment by mapping is widely used, and Bertels et al. (2014) have
shown that its accuracy can be further improved by mapping
against multiple reference genomes instead of the customary single
reference. Their implementation of this idea, REALPHY, requires
2min and 250 MB/Mbase analysed. The genome of S.pneumom'ae
is 2.2 Mbase long, so REALPHY would run 9.4 days on the
3085 S.pneumom'ae isolates. However, a more prohibitive aspect
of REALPHY might be the RAM requirement of 1.7 TB.

Perhaps surprisingly, it is not necessary to compute an explicit
alignment for phylogeny reconstruction. This insight has sparked
interest in devising alignment-free methods for rapidly calculating
pairwise distances between genomes (Haubold, 2014), which can
then be clustered using various quick algorithms (Felsenstein, 2004).

Alignment-free distance computation is either based on counting
words of a certain length or recording match lengths (Haubold,
2014). When counting words, there is a choice between the trad-
itional approach of counting exact words and a more recent method
of looking for words that enclose one mismatch. The latter is imple-
mented in the program co—phylog (Yi and Jin, 2013), which
gives better distances than exact word counting while requiring only
moderate additional resources (Haubold, 2014).

Haubold et al. (2009) devised an alignment-free estimator of
genetic distance based on match lengths. The expected match length
is the inverse of the proportion of mismatches. For example, if 1%
of positions between two genomes are mismatched, the expected
match length is 100. Domazet-Loso and Haubold (2009) imple-
mented this idea using a generalized suffix tree of all input sequences
to look up the match lengths. Their program kr computes the dis-
tances between the complete genomes of 29 E.coli/Shigella strains in
just 5.5 min on a single processor. However, this takes 5.3 GB RAM
and kr has been criticized for excessive RAM utilization
(Cohen and Chor, 2012). Moreover, Yi and Jin (2013) noted that
co—phylog gave a better phylogeny when applied to the bench-
marking sample of 29 E.coli/Shigella genomes.

This has prompted us to devise a replacement for kr. Our new
strategy is to look for mismatches that are bracketed by long exact
matches, which we call anchors. We show through simulation that
the resulting program andi, for ANchor DIstances, is accurate, fast
and memory efficient. Moreover, we apply andi to three sets of bac-
terial genomes: the 29 genomes of E.coli/Shigella Yi and Jin (2013)
used for benchmarking co—phylog, the 109 genomes of E.coli
ST131 studied by Petty et al. (2014)—of which they sequenced
99 strains—and the 3085 genomes of S.pneumoniae sequenced by
Chewapreecha et al. (2014). In each case, andi quickly recovers
pairwise distances. For the E.coli samples, we compare the new dis-
tances to alignment-based distances and find they are so similar that
they yield almost identical phylogenies.

2 Methods

2.1 Defining anchor distances
We compute anchor distances using maximal matches by imposing
three criteria on them: uniqueness, equidistance and a minimum
length. In this section, we explain each of these criteria in turn,
which sets the stage for the description of our algorithm in
Section 2.2.

Consider two DNA sequences, a query Q and a subject S.
Taking our cue from genome alignment tools such as MUMmer

Q _®___
V
Q _[S\__ __

Fig. 1. Exact matches of a given minimum length (anchors) between query
(0) and subject (8) sequences. A: Equally spaced anchors; here we count the
mismatches in the intervening segment. B: Unequally spaced anchors; these
are ignored in the distance computation. (Color version of this figure is avail-
able at Bioinformatics online.)

(Kurtz et al., 2004) and mauve (Darling et al., 2004), we call a
unique maximal match between Q and S an anchor, if it has some
minimum length. We look for pairs of anchors that have the same
distance in Q and S, as shown in Figure 1A. Such anchor pairs
approximate ungapped alignments, and we count the mismatches in
the intervening segment. In contrast, if the anchors are unequally
spaced as shown in Figure 1B, the regions they bracket are either not
homologous or contain indels. We ignore such anchor pairs in our
analysis. The total number of mismatches bracketed by equidistant
anchors divided by the number of nucleotides covered by the an-
chors and the bracketed regions is our estimate of the number of
mismatches per site, dm(Q,S). This is converted to the number of
substitutions per site using the correction by Jukes and Cantor
(1969»

_mgsy=—%nO—gadgsv.

K(Q, S) is not symmetrical, that is, K(Q, S) 75 K(S, Q). We there-
fore define the anchor distance between two sequences z' and j as the
average Jukes—Cantor distance computed from the two possible
labellings of i and j:

_ _ K ,S + K S,
dam) : (Q )2 < Q) _

A critical parameter in the computation of da(z',j) is the min-
imum anchor length, I. We compute this as a function of GC content
and subject length using equation (6) by Haubold et al. (2009):

Pmsx} : 1:236 (awe—mack“ - pk(%—p)x‘k)'s',

where X? is the length of a match starting at position i in Q and any
position in S, and 2p is the GC content of S. We define l to be the
97.5% quantile of the distribution of Xf.

2.2 Algorithm and implementation

For computing anchor distances, we first order alphabetically all
suffixes contained in the forward and reverse strands of S. From this
suffix array, we compute the array of common prefix lengths be-
tween consecutive suffixes using the <I)-algorithm listed as Algorithm
4.4 by Ohlebusch (2013). Together with the suffix array, this lon-
gest common prefix array forms the enhanced suffix array, E, which
is the central input for computing K(Q, S). Algorithm 1 uses the
function getMatch(E, string) to look for the longest prefix of

string that matches somewhere in S. In Line 8, string is the suf-
fix of Q that has not yet been matched against S. Function
getMatch (not shown) is a slight variation on Algorithm 5.2 by
Ohlebusch (2013). The matching step is repeated one residue be-
yond the mismatched nucleotide that terminates the previous match
until an equidistant pair of anchors (Fig. 1A) is found in Line 12.
The mutations in the intervening segment are counted (Line 13) and
the distance between the current and the previous match is added to
the homologous nucleotide counter (Line 14). The search for equi-
distant anchor pairs continues until the complete forward strand of
Q has been traversed. Then K( Q, S) is computed as the ratio of mu-
tations to homologous nucleotides (Line 24). This streaming of Q
against S using an enhanced suffix array is an idea we took from
vmatch (http://www.vmatch.de).

For our suffix array computation, we use the libdivsufsort
library (http://homepage3.nifty.com/wpage/softwarel). The function
getMatch is based on range minimum queries, for which we use an
algorithm and corresponding implementation by Fischer and Heun
(2007). The memory requirement of the resulting program andi
is dominated by the computation of the enhanced suffix array.
To minimize the memory footprint of andi, it initially streams all
sequences against the enhanced suffix array of the first sequence,
then against the enhanced suffix array of the second sequence,
and so on. Thus at any one time, only the enhanced suffix array for
a single sequence is kept in memory. This approach also allows
for easy parallelization, which we implemented using the OpenMP
framework. andi runs fastest when the number of taxa is equal to

the number of processors. In that situation, all rows of the distance
matrix are filled in simultaneously and the program takes time
proportional to the length of the longest genome.

2.3 Simulations

For simulating pairs of related DNA sequences, we used our pro-
gram simK, which is linked from the andi web page. Here is the
command for a typical simulation run

simK —1 1000000 —k 0.01 | andi

where —1 is the sequence length and —k is the number of substitu-
tions per site. Time and memory consumption was measured using
commands such as

/usr/bin/time —f “\n %E elapsed, \n%M memory” \
andi sim. fa > sim.dist 2> andi . res

on a 32 core 2.3 GHz AMD Opteron system with 256 GB of RAM.

2.4 Datasets
Apart from simulated data, we analysed three sets of genomes of
increasing size:

1. Twenty-nine E.coli/Shigella genomes used by Yi and Jin (2013)
for benchmarking, average length 4.9 Mbase;

2. One hundred and nine E.coli ST131 genomes, average length
5.2 Mbase (Petty et al., 2014);

3. Three thousand and eighty-ﬁve S.pneumom'ae genomes, average
length 2.2 Mbase (Chewapreecha et al., 2014).

Links to these datasets are also posted on the andi web site.

2.5 Alignment

The two E.colz' genome samples were aligned with mugsy, which
generates output in ‘mutation annotation format’ (maf) (Angiuoli
and Salzberg, 2011). We converted this to PHYLIP format with
our script maf2phy.awk, also posted on the andi web site.
Jukes—Cantor distances were computed using the program dna—
dist, which is part of the PHYLIP package (Felsenstein, 2005).

2.6 Phylogeny reconstruction

Distances were clustered using neighbor and the trees midpoint
rooted using retree, both also part of PHYLIP. Trees were plotted
uising njplot (Perriere and Gouy, 1996) or drawgram (PHYLIP).
Topological distances between trees were computed using the
programs rspr (Whidden et al., 2013) or treedi st (PHYLIP).

3 Results

3.1 Simulations

Figure 2A shows our new distance measure da as a function of
the number of substitutions per site, K, for simulated pairs of
100 kbase sequences, which implies a minimum anchor length of 8.
Under these ideal conditions, da is an excellent estimator for a
wide range of divergence values. However, for K 2 0.5 the probabil-
ity increases that no anchor pair is found and da cannot be com-
puted. The proportion of failed estimations therefore grows
from 0.7% for K: 0.5 to 94% for K: 0.65 (Fig. 2B, open circles).
This might suggest that a lower minimum anchor length yields bet-
ter estimates. However, it leads to underestimation of distances
(Supplementary Fig. S1). We thus recommend using andi only for
sequences with K S 0.5.

Our main motivation for developing da is efficiency. Figure 3
shows the time and memory consumption of andi as a function of
sequence length. The run time would ideally be linear in the size
of the input sequence, that is, time oc length, which is close to the
observed run time O(length1'05). Notice also that the more divergent
sequences with K=0.1 take slightly longer to analyse than those
with K = 0.01. The reason for this is that the streaming of the query
against the enhanced suffix array of the subject takes time propor-
tional to the number of calls to the matching function. This in turn
depends on the number of substitutions, with divergent sequences
requiring more matching steps. Nevertheless, as a rule of thumb
andi takes 1 s/Mbase. The memory consumption shown in
Figure 3B is initially constant in the sequence length reflecting
program overheads. For longer sequences, memory consumption
is exactly linear in the size of the input data, as expected. In fact,
we observe that 45 bytes memory are used per base pair.

We conclude from our analysis of simulated data that andi
is accurate and efficient. Next, we apply andi to three samples
of genomes: 29 E.coli/Shigella genomes, 109 genomes of E.coli
ST131 (Petty et al., 2014) and 3085 genomes of S.pneumom'ae
(Chewapreecha et al., 2014). Where appropriate, we compare
the results obtained by andi with those of co—phylog and align-
ment-based distances.

3.2 Application to genomes

from their complete genomes. These genomes are often used for
benchmarking (Bertels et al., 2014; Yi and Jin, 2013) and are on

average 4.9 Mbase long. Aligning them to compute the phylogeny in
Figure 4A took mugsy 5 h, 33min and 2.9 GB RAM. The corres-
ponding co—phylog computation took only 9min, 21 s and 156.8
MB RAM. The resulting tree in Figure 4B is shorter than the reference
from which it is separated by a topological distance of 3. Two of these
topological differences affect short branches in clade C. The other dif-
ference concerns the position of E.coli strain UMN026, which
switches between the two most basal clades. With 29 threads andi
took 19.85 and 7.2 GB RAM to compute Figure 4C. Its branch
lengths are almost indistinguishable from the reference tree and its
topological distance from the reference is only one due to a difference
in clade C, where strain 536 should branch off at a more basal pos-
ition. However, the position of strain UMN026 is correct.

Figure 5 shows the andi tree constructed from 109 E.coli
ST131 strains (Petty et al., 2014) in 1 min 21 s using 30 CPUs and
7.7 GB RAM. The 99 strains sequenced by Petty et al. (2014) fall
into three clades, A, B, and C, shown online in red, orange and
green, respectively. The clades identified by andi are identical to
those reported in the original publication based on a mugsy align-
ment computed on our hardware in 5.6 days using 52.7 GB RAM.
That is, andi analyses the 109 E.colz' genomes approximately 6000
times faster than mugsy and uses seven times less RAM.

As the third and final challenge, we applied co—phylog and
andi to 3085 complete genomes of the human bacterial pathogen
S.pneumom'ae. Its genome is 2.2 Mbase long, amounting to a dataset
comprising 6.7 Gbase. co—phylog took 36.5 days and 2.3 GB
RAM to compute the pairwise distances shown in Figure 6A. With
32 threads andi took 7h, 35 min and 23.8 GB RAM to carry out
the same computation (Fig. 6B). Unfortunately, we cannot com-
pare these two trees to a reference tree. Moreover, their

Robinson—Foulds distance (Robinson and Foulds, 1981) is 4570,
which is disconcertingly large. However, we found that the average
Robinson—Foulds distance between 10 random trees with 3085
leaves is 6166. Also, the longest branches indicated by arrows
in Figures 6A and B harbour the same three strains sequenced
in lanes 6680_6#10, 6775_1#8 and 6823_7#22. It would be inter-
esting to further investigate what sets these strains apart.

4 Discussion

Our new distance measure, da, approximates local alignments by an-
choring them with long, unique matches (Fig. 1). The requirement
that the matches are equidistant in the query and the subject
(Fig. 1A) is equivalent to restricting the analysis to ungapped align-
ments. andi is therefore a cross between the early version of BLAST
(Altschul et al., 1990) and the genome aligner MUMmer (Kurtz et al.,

2004): From early BLAST it inherits the idea of ungapped local
alignments, from MUMmer the idea of looking up unique matches by
indexing the subject.

Domazet-Loso and Haubold (2009) had previously used the
power of indexing algorithms to estimate the number of substitu-
tions from the match length distribution. Their program kr works
on the same principle as the average common substring distance
(Cohen and Chor, 2012; Ulitsky et al., 2006), except that kr imple-
ments theory by Haubold et al. (2009) to transform common sub-
string lengths to mutation rates.

Fast as the average common substring methods are, they suffer
from two disadvantages: First, local fluctuations in the mutation
rate affect the average match length. As a result, the same number of
mutations can lead to different distances depending on the degree to
which the mutations are clustered. Haubold et al. (2013) have used
this property to devise a test for recombination. andi does not have
this problem as it counts mutations directly rather than inferring
them from match lengths. The second disadvantage of match-length
based methods is that matches induced by non-homologous

vergent regions. Even a moderate divergence of K = 0.1 implies an
average match length of 10. Compare this to the expected length of
a random match in a 1 Mbase sequence, which according to the the-
ory by Haubold et al. (2009) is 10.4. To overcome this limitation of
match length distances, Leimeister and Morgenstern (2014) pro-
posed a k-mismatch generalization. They show that this outperforms
the classical zero-mismatch version of their distance. However, it re-
mains unclear how to choose the critical parameter h when applying
this method.

Instead of a generalized mismatch approach, we bracket muta-
tions with paired anchors. This should give more accurate results
than kr, and andi did compute a better tree for 29 E.colz' genomes
than co—phylog, which in turn gave a better tree than kr. Hence,
andi is substantially more accurate than kr.

The accuracy of andi is excellent when applied to simulated se-
quences with a wide range of substitution rates, K (Fig. 2).
However, at K > 0.5 the search for suitable anchors fails increas-
ingly often (Fig. 2B), which cannot be overcome by lowering the
minimum anchor length (Supplementary Fig. S1). Hence, our
method is effectively limited to K305.

To get an intuition for the evolutionary times implied by
K = 0.5, consider the average synonymous substitution rate in mam-
mals of 3.51 x 10_9 (Li, 1997, p. 420). The last common ancestor
that can occur in a tree restricted to K305 lived 0.5/3.51/10_9/2
= 71 X 106 years ago. This would allow the analysis of great apes,
which diverged 15.7 X 106 years ago (Hedges et al., 2006) and mice
(Muridae, 26.9 X 106 years), but not of these two groups together
(92.3 x 106 years).

Apart from maximizing accuracy, we strove to minimize time
and memory usage by implementing three ideas: (i) Streaming of
query against subject as first implemented in vmatch speeds up suf-
fix array construction compared with the suffix array of all input se-
quences underlying kr; it also uses much less memory. Our second
idea was (ii) to construct only as many enhanced suffix arrays as
there are genomes in the sample, rather than constructing an
enhanced suffix array for each pairwise comparison. This means
that for a sample of n genomes andi requires only 11 suffix array
constructions, whereas a program like mugsy requires the computa-
tion of O(n2) suffix trees. The third idea was (iii) multithreading,
which allows access to the multi-processor architecture of modern
computers. However, other programmers might have chosen a
different combination of time/memory consumption. For example,
vmatch uses half as much memory as andi for suffix array
construction, but is slower than the libdivsuf sort library
we used.

When clustering hundreds of genomes, efficiency becomes para-
mount. As shown in Figure 3, andi uses only 1s/Mbase and 45
bytes/bp when applied to simulated sequences. There is an intimate
connection between the efficiency of andi and its limitation to
closely related sequences: andi approximates local alignments by
concatenating exact matches. Looking up exact matches is fast,
but this strategy breaks down for divergent sequences where
homologous matches become shorter than random matches.
This phenomenon is also the reason why fast genome alignment
programs like mauve and mugsy work best when applied to
closely related genomes (Angiuoli and Salzberg, 2011; Darling
et al., 2004).

The accuracy and efficiency observed with simulated data
carried over to the analysis of genomes. Here, we compared andi
to co—phylog as Haubold (2014) had found this to be the best
alignment-free distance estimator for long sequences. However,
andi gave a more accurate tree when compared to the tree based on
the mugsy alignment (Fig. 4). This improvement in accuracy came
without a time penalty as co—phylog computed its tree 36 times
faster than mugsy, while andi was a thousand times faster than the
alignment. The superior speed of andi comes from the structure of
its algorithm and the multithreading, without multithreading, andi
would still be 1.6 times faster than co—phylog when applied to
the 29 E.coli/Shz'gella genomes. The memory consumption of andi
is strictly linear in the number of threads, while time is roughly
inversely proportional to the number of threads. This gives the

user the opportunity to trade speed for memory and processors,
depending on the hardware available.

Aligning the 109 genomes of E.coli ST131 took mugsy 5 .6 days
and 52.7 GB RAM. Compare this to the 5 h 33 min it took mugsy
to align 29 E.coli genomes. In other words, a 3.8 times larger sample
took 24.6 times longer to align. In contrast, andi took with 1 min,
21 s only 4.1 times longer, yielding the correct classification of
strains into clades A—C in Figure 5. Moreover, the memory require-
ment of mugsy grew 18-fold, while that of andi grew by only 7%
to 7.7 GB. These comments are not meant to imply that the mugsy
alignment computed in the original study was superfluous; it was
used for a number of analyses apart from phylogeny reconstruction,
including the detection of horizontal gene transfer (Petty et al.,
2014). However, quick clustering of genomes is useful, if only as a
quality control step.

For our final application, we chose the set of 3085 genomes of
S.pneumoniae, because here an alignment program like mugsy
would run far longer than anyone is willing to wait. The current
method for comparing sets of bacterial genomes this size is mapping
the reads to a reference genome. There is some debate as to the
accuracy of the resulting trees (Bertels et al., 2014). andi takes
as input assembled contigs, which are generated from the raw
reads early on in all genome sequencing projects. Given these
contigs, andi analyses them in 7h and 35 min using 23.8 GB RAM
on a 32 processor computer. Such computing resources are available
in most genomics labs. The three outlier strains identified by andi
are identical to those found by co—phylog after a 36.5 days run.
This is gratifying and underlines the usefulness of our program.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: An autoimmune disorder occurs when the immune
system mistakenly attacks and destroys its own healthy body tissues.
The initiation of a geoepidemiological database, for recording autoim-
mune incidents with a focus to clinical manifestations, demographic
parameters and geographic background is crucial to detect
correlations.

Results: The dAUTObase collects an ever increasing number of pub-
lications—currently counting 435—on autoimmune diseases’ frequen-
cies in various populations and ethnic groups. The respective data
have been hosted by a web application developed for the task. It
uses three data visualization tools: the PivotViewer, the Disease
Treemap and the Disease World Map, to assist the effective data
querying.

Availability and implementation: The dAUTObase 2.0 version (www.
biodata.gr/dautobase) needs no registration for querying, but data
entry and modification is reserved for registered users (curators-
administrators).

1 INTRODUCTION

The autoimmune diseases result from a dysfunction of the
immune system due to which elements of the organism (cells,
tissues or whole organs) are subjected to immune attack by
agents of its own immune system. The immune response is com-
plicated and entails numerous, different and complex mechan-
isms of control and regulation; still, its core discriminative power
stems from the specificity of the antigen—antibody interaction.
Most of the classiﬁed autoimmune diseases target nervous
tissue, but the cumulative prevalence lies with endocrine
system, which is implicated in more high-prevalence autoimmune
syndromes (Hayter and Cook, 2012; Invernizzi, 2010).
Autoimmune disorders are mostly of unknown etiology, as
they constitute a heterogeneous group as far as demographic
profile and primary clinical manifestations are considered, but

with a common denominator: the effector of tissue and organ
injury is an erroneous immune response to self antigens.

Cases of comorbidity (Invernizzi, 2010) might link more than
one results to a single cause, which is in stark contrast to the
usual approach of multifactorial diseases, whence a number of
causes play a contributory role towards one, given result/syn-
drome (Cooper et al., 2009). This clustering allowed the notion
of “autoimmune disease class’, where syndromes of similar
pathogenesis but different anatomic manifestation or epidemi-
ology are grouped together (Hayter, 2012). Considerable evi-
dence supports a role for genetic, environmental and other
factors in inducing autoimmune disorders (Baranzini, 2009;
Cooper and Stroehla, 2003; Mayes, l999; Selmi et al., 2009).

The epidemiological indices for the same disease vary between
patients from different geographical regions—up to 10x,
(Youinou et al., 2010)—and in many cases variations are
observed within the same country, as happens with psoriasis in
Australia were the native (Aborigines) population is much less
affected than recent immigrants from Europe (Chandran and
Raychaudhuri, 2010).

Geoepidemiology aims at analyzing the spatial distribution of
disease incidents to identify risk populations and possible causal
factors. The first requirement from epidemiological surveys is to
estimate disease incidence in order to focus the investigation on
high-incidence areas and subsequently to determine spatial risk
factors such as UV and natural radioactivity exposure, inhal-
ation of iodine, ambient temperature and locally available food-
stuff (Shapira et al., 2010). Although different geographic
distribution is a well-substantiated fact in many cases, such as
the almost complete lack of psoriasis in the natives of the Andes
mountains compared with the high incidence in Europe amongst
native Europeans (Chandran and Raychaudhuri, 2010), rate
variation across the map may also reﬂect differences in the qual-
ity of data (e.g. in the diagnosis, classiﬁcation or reporting of the
incidents as exemplified by Cooper et al., 2009) rather than true
differences in incidence rates (Best and Wakefield, 1999).
Additionally, people and communities tend to cluster in space
in systematic ways that may be highly predictive of disease risk
(Zeki et al., 2010). Such spatially organized socioeconomic pat-
terns may have important inﬂuence on the rates of diseases
observed in small areas (Dolk et al., 1995), while communities
aggregating different populations show complicated indices: The

Asian-Americans and African-Americans are in higher risk of
systemic lupus erythematosus and scleroderma but in lower
risk of Type I Diabetes than Americans of European origin,
while rheumatoid arthritis shows no variation (Cooper and
Stroehla, 2003).

The dAUTObase is the first attempt to register a great number
of epidemiological studies on autoimmune diseases, to combine
them with geographical and statistical parameters and to visual-
ize the results in order to mine valuable data, that is, relations
between specific autoimmune diseases and regions/populations/
society mechanics. Such correlations may greatly assist decisions
on public health policies, encourage sensible research prioritiza-
tion and form the basis for a temporal versus spatial/population
database of the evolution of such diseases from an epidemiolo-
gical point of view. Recent advances in data availability and
analytic methods have created new opportunities for investiga-
tors to improve on the traditional reporting of disease at national
or regional scale. They also present new challenges because, as
the scale of the investigation becomes broader, local variations in
data quality are likely to be shadowed in the greater picture
(Youinou et al., 2010), whereas at the small-area scale, these
variations could lead to serious biases if not reported.

By employing data mining techniques, a great number of epi-
demiological studies were screened with initial emphasis on 22
autoimmune diseases. Data mining was performed on specific
indices: incidence, prevalence, mortality, age at onset etc.
Similar attempts for the compilation and development of epi-
demiological databases are numerous and proven, but the em-
phasis of such endeavours rests mostly on infectious diseases
(Gray et al., 2009).

To date, there are several data repositories that fall under the
banner of autoimmune diseases databases, such as ‘The
Autoimmune Disease Database’ (Karopka et al., 2006) and
‘The ARRC Research Database Register’ (The Autoimmune
Resource & Research Centre Research Database Register.
Available at: http://www.autoimmune.org.au/arrc—research—par-
ticipant—database/.aspx). However, these databases, which are
mostly literature derived, focus on the documentation of auto-
immune diseases and their causative background, mainly genetic
or/and the clinical manifestations; they provide no epidemiolo-
gical aspect as to population distribution, much less to geograph-
ical distribution, national, regional or global. To this end, we are
currently experimenting with various visualization techniques in
an effort to promote a novel and promising approach in the
study of autoimmune diseases, called ‘geoepidemiological
databases’. The aim of such databases is the study of the descrip-
tive epidemiology of autoimmune diseases and the risk
assessment as to their comorbidity in both individual and popu-
lation levels.

In this work, we present the development of interactive web-
based data visualization and querying tools for dAUTObase
(http://www.biodata.gr/dautobase). These tools allow users to
compare the epidemiological indices of the documented in
dAUTObase autoimmune diseases among different populations
and thus identify hidden relationships between individual pieces
of information (Chandran and Raychaudhuri, 2010; Youinou
et al., 2010). More specifically, we have built an elegant web-
based multimedia frontend which is based on a software tool
launched by Microsoft, namely the PivotViewer (Microsoft

Live Labs—Pivot Available at: http://www.getpivot.com/silver-
light/pivotviewer), in order to provide a high-level visualization
of the data collection and the mining process. Additionally to the
PivotViewer, there are also two alternative visualization querying
interfaces; the one based on the Flare visualization toolkit
(Flare—Data Visualization For The Web, Available at: http://
ﬂare.prefuse.org/) and the JQV map (JQVmap, Available at:
http://qumap.com/) providing two extra visualization types of
the underlying data collection, namely the Disease Treemap
and the Disease World Map; these allow users to query disease
distributions and correlations among populations
(Papadopoulos et al., 2014).

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

After initial screening of more than 1000 publications in PubMed, a large
number (435 and still rising) of epidemiological studies on autoimmune
diseases, which were recording the respective frequencies in various popu-
lations around the globe, have been selected and manually imported to
the database by the curators- the team of Asst Prof. K. Poulas, in the
Universitv of Patras. Data were not collected from other databases, in
order to simplify the implementation of selection criteria and the import-
ing of records with consistency. Special emphasis was given to the iden-
tiﬁcation of incidence and prevalence rates, while additional information,
if available, was registered under the respective fields (number of patients,
mortality, morbidity, age at onset). Suitable publications were identified
by periodical scans of the PubMed using as keywords the term autoim-
mune and/or the name of the autoimmune syndrome. Case reports were
not included had they not been, according to their authors, a novelty in
either of the syndrome/geography or syndrome/population schemes.
Moreover, entries were validated and used only when directly stating at
least one of the abovementioned epidemiological indices.

2.1 System architecture

The dAUTObase (www.biodata.gr/dautobase) is a web application re-
cording solely epidemiological data of autoimmune diseases in various
populations around the globe. It is public and there are no registration
requirements for data querying.

The dAUTObase is based on a relational database developed with
Microsoft SQL Server (Microsoft SQL Server, Available at: http://
www.microsoft.com/sqlserver/en/us/default.aspx). Database records in-
clude the population, the geographic region, the relative publication
and a number of epidemiological indices like incidence, prevalence, mor-
tality, morbidity, age at onset etc. The entire database schema is depicted
in Figure 1. The overall system architecture is based on a three-tier model,
which is robust and ﬂexible enough to aggregate multiple information
sources and integrate modular development (Eckerson, 1995). This way,
dAUTObase supports scalability. As the dAUTObase dataset grows, the
expansion of the existing data types will be possible in order to include
new data fields. This will be possible upon decision of the curators and
the administrator in order to proceed with an upgrade of the database
schema.

2.2 Technologies used

The dAUTObase provides a web-based multimedia visualization envir-
onment for population-based autoimmune diseases epidemiological data
collection and retrieval utilizing state-of—the-art visualization technologies
implemented in three alternative data querying and visualization inter-
faces. The dAUTObase main querying interface is based on Microsoft
Silverlight PivotViewer control (Microsoft Live Labs—Pivot Available
at: http://www.getpivot.com/silverlight/pivotviewer), a free web browser
plug-in that displays full, high-resolution content without long loading

prevent users from feeling overwhelmed by large quantities of
information.

The dAUTObase PivotViewer application enables users to interact
with thousands of objects at once, and categorize and browse data in
multiple ways revealing hidden associations and discovering tracks and
trends.

The dAUTObase queries can also be performed utilizing the Flare
Visualization Toolkit, an open-source library. Because it includes a
wide variety of features, ranging from basic charts to complex interactive
graphs, it supports data management, visual encoding, animation and
interaction techniques. In dAUTObase, Flare implements an alternative
representation of the underlying data collection, the Disease Treemap, an
easy way of analyzing large amounts of data in a small space (Treemap:
Treemap—Available at: http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/treemap/).

Finally, dAUTObase queries output can also be visualized by using an
alternative interface based on the J QVMap which enables the change of
the look and feel of the maps by adding colours, events, and interactivity.
We have utilized the J QVMap technology to implement the Disease
World Map.

3 IMPLEMENTATION

Because dAUTObase is the first attempt for a geoepidemiologi-
cal database for autoimmune diseases, our primary goal was to
provide scientists with a powerful tool for the study of the epi-
demiology of autoimmune diseases. The first step was the selec-
tion of relative publications with suitable in volume and context
epidemiological data to be included in the dAUTObase. The
publications are selected through PubMed scans by the reference
of the autoimmune syndrome in their title. The database does
not use controlled terminology; the autoimmune syndromes are
mentioned and reproduced by the most frequent orthography/
nomenclature forms, which were selected to make the database
friendlier to as many users as possible. To this end the ‘The
Autoimmune Disease Database’ (Karopka et al., 2006) is fol-
lowed. On the other hand, ethnicities are recorded as in the ori-
ginal publications, provided they are not in discord with UN
mandates and decisions.

The next step was the efficient visual representation of the
collected information in a way that would give researchers the
opportunity to explore, analyze and understand the screened
data. The three querying interfaces mentioned earlier, all support

when users zoom-in on a card providing in—depth information about the
card currently selected

sophisticated data exploration and allow users to apply advanced
filtering criteria upon a set of multiple aspects of the same under-
lying data collection, giving them an active role in the mining
process. Moreover, they offer users the possibility to zoom-in
from the extensive dAUTObase datasets to particular disease-
specific and/or population-specific data. This way, users can
detect the links between apparently unassociated and/or re-
mote data entities and handle them in a rather intuitive way
reﬂecting their semantic proximity. It is noteworthy here that
user experimentation with different querying scenarios some-
times results in making incidental discoveries of potentially
high medical importance, such as the discovery of demographic
patterns and the extraction of population-based patient
characteristics.

The form of a card (Fig. 2A) is used for the representation of
each autoimmune disease, in order to provide a more human-
centric visualization approach. This card is accompanied by a
sidebar information panel (Fig. 2B) which provides in-depth in-
formation on the particular autoimmune disease and population
upon users’ zooming-in on the card. The entire dAUTObase data
collection, as generated by PivotViewer (http://www.biodata.gr/
dautobase/pivot/), is shown in Figure 3. A data filtering panel
(displayed on the left side; Fig. 3) is available to offer a variety of
filtering criteria applicable to the underlying data collection.
Moreover, by clicking on the disease name or the ‘PubMed
Link’ at the sidebar information panel, the user can have
access to the original publication of the selected card item.
This way, users are able to dynamically sort, organize and cat-
egorize data according to common characteristics that can be
selected from the data query menu and then zoom-in for a
closer look, by either filtering the collection to get a subset of
information or clicking on a particular card. There is a
‘Download dataset’ link at http://www.biodata.gr/dautobase/
allowing users to have full access to the data displayed by the
visualizations tools. More specifically, all the recorded studies are

exported to a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, including a reference
to the respective PubMed Identiﬁer.

Such an example would be the query of the occurrence of the
Type I diabetes in different populations around the world, sorted
by the population name (Fig. 4).

The dAUTObase data collection can also be launched in an
alternative representation, namely the Disease Treemap (http://
www.biodata.gr/dautobase/DiseaseTreeMap/) (Fig. 5). It is a
treemap representing the incidence rates of autoimmune diseases
over populations, with each rectangle representing the speciﬁc
incidence rate of an autoimmune disease for a speciﬁc popula-
tion. The colour of each rectangle corresponds to a different
population. Whenever more than one rectangles are included
within a country’s rectangle, the subordinate rectangles refer to
different autoimmune diseases occurring within the same popu-
lation or within regions of the same country. The area of each
rectangle indicates the incidence rate of the autoimmune disease
in the respective population. By clicking on a rectangle,
dAUTObase Disease Treemap displays all the relative popula-
tions having <10% difference of incidence on average.
Additional information, such as the population identity, the dis-
ease, the region name and the corresponding value of the inci-
dence of the speciﬁed autoimmune disease, become accessible
when users hover the mouse over a rectangle. A typical query
example is shown in Figure 5B presenting the incidence rate of

A first step towards the global scale geoepidemiology

 

Type 1 Diabetes in different populations and regions around the
world.

The Disease World Map (http://www.biodata.gr/dautobase/
DiseaseWorldMap/) (Fig. 6) is a visual depiction of the world-
wide map enriched with a variety of epidemiological indices per
population. Through two drop-down lists, the user has the abil-
ity to make a selection of the speciﬁc autoimmune disease and
the type of epidemiological indices to be displayed. When these
selections are made, the Disease World Map dynamically up-
dates the data appearing on the map. The colour scale, corres-
ponding to each country, depends on the screened data and
reﬂects the value of the selected index for the speciﬁed disease
and population. By hovering or clicking on a speciﬁc country, an
additional information panel appears on the left, presenting de-
tails like the name, the ﬂag and the value of the selected index
for the speciﬁed population (the selected country is always
denoted by the green colour). A typical query example is
shown in Figure 6 presenting the incidence rate (among men
and women) for Type 1 Diabetes around the world.

4 DISCUSSION

The databases are important tools for the huge load of data
gathered around the globe in various ﬁelds of medical and bio-
medical interest: genomics, proteomics, structural biology, epi-
demiology feature prominently among so many others. The
geoepidemiological aspect of autoimmune diseases entails the
dynamic to assist in both the elucidation of pathogenetic mech-
anisms and the emergence of population (Chandran and
Raychaudhuri, 2010; Kochi et al., 2009; Selmi and Tsuneyama,
2009), ethological (Cooper and Stroehla, 2003; Shapira et al.,
2010; Youinou et al., 2010) and other, community-derived pat-
terns (Shapira et al., 2010). Recording incidents meticulously and
with an epidemiological focus might help unravel the complex
interactions between the various genetic contributors and envir-
onmental or social factors that alleviate or bolster such heredi-
tary background (Chandran and Raychaudhuri, 2010).
Moreover, better population-scale planning of healthcare ser-
vices could be achieved (Shapira et al., 2010). dAUTObase will
be further expanded to become a dynamic tool for all the re-
searchers who deal with autoimmunity. The thorough and sys-
tematic study of the epidemiology of autoimmune diseases can
pave the way to new perspectives in terms of medical care util-
ization and patient quality of life. In this work, we present the
integration of novel visualization tools within the dAUTObase
2.0 version in an attempt to provide a state-of-the—art data and
querying visualization environment for the epidemiological study
of autoimmune diseases.

The net utility of the dAUTObase lies in three discrete appli-
cations, the audience of which might diverge: (i) The solid re-
cording and compilation of published autoimmune
epidemiological data in a single platform and the compilation
of the source references so as to be reviewed, compared and
downloaded by the user. Such an application, which is the
most basic, is helpful in identifying gaps in epidemiological re-
search and vigilance and the design of further research projects
by healthcare policymakers, epidemiologists and population
biologists/population geneticists. (ii) The second application is
the classiﬁcation and organization of epidemiological data on a

geographical basis, were population groups and nationalities are
secondary parameters in sorting. This way, a world map of auto-
immunity is morphing, for the ﬁrst time. Through this map com-
mercial and public interests can prioritize the offering of
products and services (research and healthcare, the latter in
both preventive and therapeutic contexts) in different areas.
The third application (iii) is entwined with the very design and
the tools provided by the database; the different visualization
tools allow access to different levels of compiled data in an in-
tuitive manner and facilitate combination and/or correlation of
different databits and bytes in order to form hypotheses, draw
conclusions or simply detect tendencies in autoimmune diseases’
aetiology and patterns- such as co-morbidity patterns and geog-
raphy-based incidence biases. Except their potential to increase
our basic knowledge by observation and extrapolation such data
initiate new ﬁelds and contexts for researchers of autoimmune
physiology, genetics and therapeutics as much as physicians,
health professionals and policymakers.

The current version of the dAUTObase complies to no stand-
ards of granulation for ethnicity and other population groups,
nor with standardized terminology and systematic reference; it is
devoted in recording data published in PubMed-indexed papers,
as a measure of quality control. At present, the dAUTObase
offers a solid and massive recording of epidemiological indices
of autoimmune syndromes sorted by natural and political geog-
raphy; priority is given to incidence and prevalence, with four
ﬁelds each (general incidence/prevalence, incidence/prevalence
for men and women separately, year of incidence/date of preva-
lence) but other indices, (such as mortality, morbidity, age at
onset) are also included as mentioned earlier.

Although by themselves general incidence and prevalence rates
provide a rather poor context of geoepidemiology, they are ad-
equate for initial applications and drawing of rough conclusions.
As the database is scalable and additional data types can be
imported within a short time upon decision, other indices, to
be added as more data become available and recordable, are to
further the usefulness of the database to more elegant and spe-
ciﬁc issues.

Meticulously kept epidemiological records, easily accessible to
all interested parties, will allow an ‘alert’ function whenever a
study produces signiﬁcantly different indices than the ones re-
corded in the dAUTObase. In such cases, the publication might
be subject in a quality control step, and if found valid, scientists
and authorities should scrutinize the reason for such deviations.
Further still, records will allow comparative studies, where
comorbidity tendencies and wide-scale biases might be detected
faster and in more intuitive and direct ways than with traditional
tools. Of course the granulation will never sufﬁce for establishing
comorbidity traits within families or, even less, for substantiating
a siblings’ concordance and other family bias as in Myasthenia
Gravis (Bach, 2012; Zagoriti et al., 2014); population-wide traits,
though, as the North—South gradient which is instrumental for
the Hygiene Theory (Bach, 2012) will be easily detectable, if the
number of studies in developing countries offers an argumentum
ex silentio, meaning that no publications on autoimmune dis-
eases means no such incidents and rather than failure to report
them (Best and Wakeﬁeld, 1999; Cooper et al., 2009).

The issue of comorbidity is just the tip of the iceberg: signiﬁ-
cant deviations in similar but geographically distant populations

would point to signiﬁcant environmental or ethological biases
and causative agents, whereas similarities in colocated, mixed
population groups would advocate against signiﬁcant genetic
contribution in syndrome aetiology. On the contrary, similarity
in indices observed in ethnically relative populations located in
distant regions or in a dispersed pattern, would point towards an
increased genetic contribution to the disease phenotypes; such
are Crohn’s disease and IPEX-Immunodysregulatory
Polyendocrinopathy and Enteropathy X-linked (Bach, 2012).
Last, but not least, such retrospective, whole-population queries
might provide insight in long term, low incidence effects of dif-
ferent environmental or technological factors in generating dis-
ease phenotypes, which in many an autoimmune syndrome are
due to acquired deregulation/dysregulation without serious gen-
etic background. Of course, as the database is a recording and
sorting tool rather than an exploratory method, its usefulness
depends on the input achieved. And this is subject to funding
and policy issues, especially among the developing countries.
However, the emergence of the dAUTObase enables prompt
use of high-volume and high-quality data, as they become pub-
lished and available, for compiling larger and more coherent
pictures on the issue of autoimmune diseases.

The integration of the current visualization tools leaves
enough to be desired, as the tools stem from different technolo-
gies, a fact synonymous to hardship in seamless integration.
However, the preparation of a user manual to guide users
through the functionalities of the visualization tools is now in
progress. Furthermore, in the near future, we are planning to
experiment on more querying options and alternative visualiza-
tion types and techniques capable of manipulating multidimen-
sional data, in order to create a global visualization framework
which is to allow the conduct of multifaceted comparative studies
of the querying results by the users.

The administration environment of dAUTObase is another
aspect which we consider of great importance. The system sup-
ports multiple user proﬁles, permitting scaled access to the infor-
mation with users divided into three main groups according to
their privileges, namely the administrators, the curators and the
simple users. Data entry and modiﬁcation in dAUTObase is
possible only for registered users that is, administrator and cur-
ators; the data entered into the system by curators are incorpo-
rated into the dAUTObase collection only after their successful
approval by the administrator who is responsible for their
validity.

Querying needs no registration. This way, researchers world-
wide could concurrently contribute the epidemiological data of
their country of origin and thus dAUTObase can become the
ﬁrst worldwide up-to-date and comprehensive geoepidemiologi-
cal data repository. An external user can become a curator so
that he/she can upload data in the dAUTObase collection, by

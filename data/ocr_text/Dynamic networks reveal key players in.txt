ABSTRACT

Motivation: Because susceptibility to diseases increases with age,
studying aging gains importance. Analyses of gene expression or se-
quence data, which have been indispensable for investigating aging,
have been limited to studying genes and their protein products in
isolation, ignoring their connectivities. However, proteins function by
interacting with other proteins, and this is exactly what biological net-
works (BNs) model. Thus, analyzing the proteins’ BN topologies could
contribute to the understanding of aging. Current methods for analyz-
ing systems-level BNs deal with their static representations, even
though cells are dynamic. For this reason, and because different
data types can give complementary biological insights, we integrate
current static BNs with aging-related gene expression data to con-
struct dynamic age-specific BNs. Then, we apply sensitive measures
of topology to the dynamic BNs to study cellular changes with age.
Results: While global BN topologies do not significantly change with
age, local topologies of a number of genes do. We predict such genes
to be aging-related. We demonstrate credibility of our predictions by (i)
observing signiﬁcant overlap between our predicted aging-related
genes and ‘ground truth’ aging-related genes; (ii) observing significant
overlap between functions and diseases that are enriched in our
aging-related predictions and those that are enriched in ‘ground
truth’ aging-related data; (iii) providing evidence that diseases which
are enriched in our aging-related predictions are linked to human
aging; and (iv) validating our high-scoring novel predictions in the
literature.

1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Motivation and background

Because the US population is, on average, growing older as a
result of ~78 million baby boomers who began turning 65 in
2011, and because susceptibility to diseases increases with age,
studying human aging gains importance. Analysis of gene expres-
sion data has been indispensable for investigating aging (F ortney
et al., 2010; Wieser et al., 2011). However, it has mostly been
limited to studying differential expression of individual genes,

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

without considering their connectivities (F ortney et al., 2010).
However, it is the proteins (gene products) that carry out cellular
processes, and they do so by interacting with other proteins in-
stead of acting alone. And this is exactly what BNs and protein—
protein interaction (PPI) networks in particular model; in PPI
networks, nodes are proteins and edges correspond to physical
interactions between the proteins. Thus, analyzing topologies of
proteins in PPI networks could contribute to the understanding of
the processes of aging. Although, as a proof of concept, this study
focuses on PPI networks, it is applicable to other types of BNs.
High-throughput screens for PPI detection have yielded systems-
level (though incomplete) PPI networks for many organisms,
which are publicly available (Breitkreutz et al., 2008).

The majority of current methods for analyzing systems-level
PPI networks deal with their static representations, due to limi-
tations of biotechnologies for PPI collection, even though cells
are dynamic (Przytycka and Kim, 2010). For this reason, and
because different data types can give complementary biological
insights (Memisevié et al., 2010b; Przytycka and Kim, 2010), we
integrate current static PPI network data (Breitkreutz et al., 2008;
Peri et al., 2004) with age-speciﬁc gene expression data
(Berchtold et al., 2008) to computationally construct dynamic
age-specific PPI networks, to study cellular changes with age
from such networks.

Furthermore, topological positions of aging-related genes in
the static networks have been studied (de Magalhaes, 2009;
Ferrarini et al., 2005; Kriete et al., 2011; Promislow, 2004;
Reja et al., 2009), but mostly with crude measures of topology
that cannot cope with the complexity of PPI networks (Priulj,
2011). For example, node degrees have been used to argue the
central role or aging-related proteins in the yeast network com-
pared with proteins that are not associated with aging, or to
study the role of chaperones (heat shock proteins) in aging
(Promislow, 2004; Sc’Sti and Csermely, 2007). In addition to
aging, many approaches have aimed to link node degrees with,
for example, essentiality (Jeong et al., 2001), disease (Sharan and
Ideker, 2008; Vanunu et al., 2010), cancer (Aragues et al., 2008;
Jonsson and Bates, 2006) or pathogenicity (Dyer et al., 2008).
However, it is possible that the high-degree proteins have been
more studied simply because of their known relevance to human
health (Priulj, 2011; Ratmann et al., 2009). Hence, more con-
straining measures of topology might be needed that go beyond
capturing only the direct network neighborhood of a node
(Milenkovié and Priulj, 2008; Milenkovié et al., 2010). While
such measures exist and have been used to link proteins’ network
positions with their involvement in some biological processes
(Milenkovié et al., 2011; Sharan et al., 2007), to our knowledge,

they have not been linked to proteins’ involvement in aging even
in static, and especially in dynamic PPI networks. Here, we apply
a series of measures of topology, including some highly sensitive
measures (Milenkovié and PrZulj, 2008; Milenkovié et al., 2011),
to the dynamic PPI networks to identify key players in aging.

1.2 Our study

We aim to study human aging via integration of aging-related
gene expression data with static PPI network data (Fig. 1). We
obtain dynamic age-speciﬁc PPI networks by selecting in the
static network (i) all proteins that correspond to actively ex-
pressed genes at different ages and (ii) all PPIs involving these
‘active’ proteins. Hence, each age-speciﬁc network is the network
that is ‘active’ at a given age. We hypothesize that the dynamic
and integrative network analysis provides a valuable model of
cellular functioning that can reveal aging-related information
and that can reveal more of the information than static analysis
of individual data types.

Given the dynamic network data, we ﬁrst aim to answer
whether the overall network topologies change with age
(Fig. 1). Because this is not the case and because the gene expres-
sion data alone may reveal only a small portion of all genes as
aging-related (Berchtold et al., 2008; Lu et al., 2004), it could be
that local topologies around only a subset of proteins in the net-
work do change with age. Hence, we study positions of proteins
in each age-speciﬁc PPI network with respect to measures of
local topology, called node centralities, with the goal of identify-
ing proteins whose centralities signiﬁcantly change with age. We
ﬁnd 537 such proteins (5.7% of all proteins in the static net-
work), which is quantitatively consistent with the result of the
gene expression study by Lu et al. (2004). We predict these pro-
teins to be aging-related and validate them as follows:

(1) The predictions are statistically signiﬁcant, i.e. non-
random.

(2) The overlap of our predictions and ‘ground truth’ aging-
related genes is signiﬁcant. Nonetheless, many of our

Glohal network

indicates no age-
specific change

predictions are novel, i.e. absent from the ‘ground truth’
data. This conﬁrms that dynamic network analysis of inte-
grated data types can reveal additional biological know-
ledge compared with static analysis of individual data.

(3) There is an overlap between functions and diseases that are
enriched in our predictions and those that are enriched in
the ‘ground truth’ aging-related data. Also, diseases that
are enriched in our predictions are linked to human aging.

(4) We manually search in the literature for 10% of our highest-
scoring predictions that are not present in the ‘ground truth’
aging-related data, and we successfully validate all of them.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 Data

2.1.] Aging-related gene expression data As a proof of concept of
our approach, we use a microarray human brain gene expression data set
consisting of 173 samples obtained from 55 individuals, spanning 37 dif-
ferent ages between 20 and 99 years (Berchtold et al., 2008). We deﬁne a
gene as being expressed (or active) in a given sample by following the
methodology of Lu et al.’s work (2004). Because the expression data
consist of multiple samples per age, we integrate all samples belonging
to a given age and deﬁne a gene as being expressed at that age according
to the majority vote rule (Lee et al., 2000). For details, see Supplementary
Section $11

In addition, to test the robustness of our approach, we use an alter-
native RNA-seq human brain gene expression data consisting of 15 sam-
ples obtained from 15 individuals, spanning 15 age- groups between 0 and
98 years (Mazin et al., 2013) (Supplementary Section S1.1). As we show in
Section 3.3, using this alternative RNA-seq data instead of the above
microarray data makes no signiﬁcant effect on our aging-related
predictions.

2.1.2 Static PPI network data We obtain human static PPIs from

HPRD (Peri et al., 2004) and BioGRID (Breitkreutz et al., 2008). HPRD
data consist of 9617 unique proteins (with respect to their gene IDs) and

Fig. 1. Summary of our study. We integrate a static PPI network with aging-related gene expression data to obtain age-speciﬁc networks. We analyze
changes in global and local network topologies with age. While global network analysis indicates no age-speciﬁc change, local topologies (as captured by
seven node centrality measures) of some proteins do signiﬁcantly change with age. We predict such proteins to be aging-related and validate our

predictions in several ways

37 039 unique PPIs between the proteins. BioGRID data consist of 10 078
unique proteins and 50954 unique PPIs between the proteins.

2.1.3 Integrating static PPI network with gene expression data to
form age-specific PPI networks We form dynamic age-Speciﬁc net-
works as follows. To form a network speciﬁc to a given age, we select in
the static network those proteins that are expressed at that age (Section
2.1.1) and all PPIs that exist between the expressed proteins (see
Supplementary Section $12 for a formal description). Because gene ex-
pression data are collected for 37 ages, 37 age-speciﬁc networks are formed
from the given static network. Because we study two static networks
O-IPRD and BioGRID), we obtain two sets of dynamic networks. We
run subsequent analyses on each of the network sets. Because we ﬁnd
that results are similar across the two sets, for simplicity, here we report
results only for the HPRD network. Results for the BioGRID network are
reported in Supplementary Table S2 and Supplementary Figs S2 and S5.

2.1.4 ‘Ground truth’ aging-related data We denote the set of 9426
genes that are present in both the static PPI network (Section 2.1.2) and
brain gene expression data (Section 2.1.1) as StatNetExpression.

By studying the brain gene expression data from Section 2.1.1,
Berchtold et al. (2008) identiﬁed 8277 genes whose expression signiﬁ-
cantly changed with age. Of these, 4520 are present in
StatNetExpression. Henceforth, we denote this ‘ground truth’ aging-
related set of 4520 genes predicted from brain gene expression data
alone as BrainExpression2008Age.

By studying a different brain gene expression data, Lu et al. (2004)
predicted 442 genes as aging-related, as their expression signiﬁcantly cor-
related with age. Of these, 343 genes are present in StatNetExpression.
Henceforth, we denote this ‘ground truth’ aging-related set of 343
genes predicted from brain gene expression data alone as
BrainExpression2004Age.

Clearly, BrainExpression2008Age and BrainExpression2004Age are
similar in the sense that their aging-related genes have been inferred
from brain gene expression data. [And as such, among all ‘ground truth’
data sets (see below), these two sets are expected to be the most similar to
our aging-related predictions, because our predictions are also partly based
on brain human gene expression data.] However, it is important to note
that BrainExpression2008Age and BrainExpression2004Age were pre-
dicted from two independent data sets, and compared with
BrainExpression2004Age, BrainExpression2008Age is a result of a newer
microarray study; it covers more samples and more individuals, and it
covers more samples per individual. And this is exactly why we base our
study (Section 2.1.1) on the expression data by Berchtold et al. (2008)
rather than on the data by Lu et al. (2004).

By studying the brain gene expression data set related to different
stages of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Simpson et al. (2011) identiﬁed
2911 genes that have signiﬁcantly different expression levels at different
stages of AD. Of these, 1541 are present in StatNetExpression.
Henceforth, we denote this ‘ground truth’ AD-related set of 1541 genes
predicted from brain gene expression data as ADExpressionAge.

In July 2012, GenAge contained 261 human genes that have been
linked to aging as sequence-based orthologs of aging-related genes in
model species (de Magalhaes et al., 2009). Of these, 242 are present in
StatNetExpression. Henceforth, we denote this ‘ground truth’ aging-
related set of 242 genes predicted from sequence data by SequenceAge.

2.1.5 Complements of the ‘ground truth’ aging-related data We
deﬁne a set of genes as the complement of a ‘ground truth’ aging-related
data set if the genes are present in StatNetExpression but not in
the ‘ground truth’ data set. We denote the complements of
BrainExpression2008Age, BrainExpression2004Age, ADExpressionAge
and SequenceAge as BrainExpression2008Complement,
BrainExpression2004Complement, ADExpressionComplement and
SequenceComplement, respectively.

All above data sets are deﬁned with respect to HPRD PPI data. For
BioGRID data, see Supplementary Section S13

2.2 Do global network topologies change with age?

Given the dynamic age-speciﬁc PPI networks, we test whether the overall
(global) topologies of the networks change with age. We do so by compar-
ing the different networks with respect to several commonly used global
network properties (Section 2.2.1), by evaluating the ﬁt of each of the age-
speciﬁc networks to a series of well-known graph families, i.e. network
models (Section 2.2.2) (Kuchaiev et al., 2011; Milenkovié et al., 2008), and
by measuring the overlap of the age-speciﬁc networks (Section 2.2.3).

2.2.1 Comparing global properties of age-specific networks We
analyze three properties: the average clustering coefﬁcient, average diam-
eter and graphlet frequency distribution (Memisevié et al., 2010a). The
properties are deﬁned in Supplementary Section S1.4.

2.2.2 Evaluating the fit of age-specific networks to diﬁ‘erent graph
families or network models We compare the ﬁt of the dynamic PPI
networks to different graph families, i.e. network models (Milenkovic':
et al., 2009), to test whether the best ﬁtting model changes with age.
Various network models have been proposed. We use (i) Erdés—Rényi
random graphs (ER), (ii) generalized Erdbs—Rényi random graphs with
same degree distribution as the data (ERDD), (iii) geometric random
graphs (GEO), (iv) geometric gene duplication and mutation model
(GEOGD), (v) scale-free networks (SF) and (vi) scale-free gene duplica-
tion and mutation model (SFGD) (Kuchaiev et al., 2011; Milenkovié
et al., 2008). To evaluate the ﬁt of the data network to a given model,
we compare the topology of the data network with the topology of a
random network instance drawn from the model with respect to a
highly constraining measure of network topological similarity called
graphlet degree distribution agreement (Przulj, 2007). For details, see
Supplementary Section S1.5.

2.2.3 Computing the overlap between age-specific networks We
measure the overlap between each pair of age-speciﬁc networks as the per-
centage of nodes (or edges) in the smaller of the two networks that are
common to the two networks. For details, see Supplementary Section S16

2.3 Do local topologies of proteins change with age?

We study topological positions of proteins in each age-speciﬁc network
with respect to seven node centrality measures (Section 2.3.1). We predict
to be aging-related those proteins whose centralities signiﬁcantly change
with age (Section 2.3.2). We validate our predictions in several ways
(Section 2.3.3).

2.3.1 Local measures of topology or node centralities Various
centrality measures have been used to link topological importance of a
node in the network to its functional importance. Below, we deﬁne each
of the seven measures that we use and provide biological justiﬁcation for
their use.

Degree centrality (DEGC) measures the degree of a node in the net-
work, i.e. the number of the node’s neighbors. The higher the degree of a
node, the more central the node according to DEGC. Because current
PPI networks have ‘power-law’ degree distributions, with many low-
degree nodes and few high-degree nodes, and because the removal of
the high-degree nodes would impact the network structure (by discon-
necting it), DEGC of a gene has been related to the gene’s essentiality as
well as its involvement in disease (Barabasi and Oltvai, 2004; Sharan and
Ideker, 2008).

Clustering coefficient centrality (CLUSC) measures, for a given node,
how many pairs of neighbors of the node are connected by an edge, out
of all pairs of the node’s neighbors. Intuitively, the more interconnected
the neighborhood of the node, the more central the node is according to

CLUSC. In a PPI network, a node with high-clustering coefﬁcient, to-
gether with the node’s neighbors, forms a highly interconnected network
region, which is likely to correspond to a functional module (Barabasi
and Oltvai, 2004).

K—core of a network is a maximal subset of nodes in the network such
that each node is connected to at least k others in the subset. K—coreness
centrality (KC) of a node is k if the node is in k—core. Nodes with high KC
in the human network have been found to correspond to the ‘core dis-
easeome’ that is signiﬁcantly enriched in disease genes and drug targets
(J anjic': and Przulj, 2012).

Graphlet degree centrality (GDC) measures how many graphlets a
node participates in, for all 2—5-node graphlets (Milenkovié et al.,
2011). Intuitively, the more graphlets a node touches, the more central
the node is according to GDC. Because it captures the extended network
neighborhood of a node, GDC is a highly sensitive measure of network
topology. Thus, in a PPI network, proteins with high GDCs represent
potential candidates for therapeutic intervention, as targeting such pro-
teins with drugs would have more signiﬁcant impact on the network
structure than targeting proteins that reside in sparse and non-complex
network regions (Milenkovié et al., 2011). Indeed, GDC has been found
to capture well disease and pathogen-interacting proteins and drug tar-
gets (Milenkovié et al., 2011).

Betweenness centrality (BETWC) measures the involvement of a node
in the shortest paths in the network. Intuitively, nodes that occur in many
shortest paths have high centrality according to BETWC. BETWC of

node v, Cbetwc(v), is: Cbetwc(v) 2 ZS ﬂ £61,623), where V is the set of

 

nodes in the network, as, is the number of shortest paths between
nodes s and t and ost(v) is the number of shortest paths between s and
t that go through v. In a PPI network, BETWC of a protein indicates the
‘likelihood’ of the protein to participate in pathways connecting all other
proteins (Koschutzki and Schreiber, 2008). Removal of a protein that is
on critical pathways between many other proteins could cause loss of
communication between the proteins. Also, targeting such a node with
a drug could cause the drug effects to spread fast to all the nodes
(Milenkovié et al., 2011). This property has been used to identify gene—
disease associations by encoding each gene in the network based on the
distribution of shortest path lengths to all genes associated with disease
(Radivojac et al., 2008).

Closeness centrality (CLOSEC) measures the ‘closeness’ of a node to
all other nodes in the network. Intuitively, nodes with small shortest path
distances to all other nodes have high centrality according to CLOSEC.

CLOSEC of node v, Cclosec(v), is: Cclosec(v) = W, where o(u, v) is
ueV ’

the shortest path distance between nodes u and v. In a PPI network,
CLOSEC of a protein indicates the ‘likelihood’ of the protein to reach
or be reachable from all other proteins (Scardoni et al., 2009). And it has
been a widely accepted assumption that proteins that are closer to each
other are more likely to perform the same function (Sharan et al., 2007).

Eccentricity centrality (ECC) is related to CLOSEC, except that it
measures the ‘closeness’ of a node only to the farthest node in the network
WVuchty and Stadler, 2003). Intuitively, nodes with small shortest path
distances to the furthest node in the network have high centrality accord-
ing to ECC. ECC of node v, Cecc(v), is: Ceoc(v) =

l
maXue V{U(u, v)} °

2.3.2 Prediction of aging-related genes For each measure, we com-
pute centrality values for a node in each of the 37 age-speciﬁc networks.
Then, we calculate Pearson or Spearman correlation between the 37 ages
and the node’s 37 centrality values (Supplementary Section S1.7). We do
this for all genes that are active in >20% of the ages in the gene expres-
sion data (Lu et al., 2004). If such a gene is unexpressed at a given age, we
assign it a centrality value of zero at that age. We note that ignoring the
centrality value of an unexpressed gene as opposed to treating it as a zero
value makes no signiﬁcant difference on our results. Also, because results
are consistent for both correlation measures, here we report them only for

Pearson correlation. Results for Spearman correlation are shown in
Supplementary Fig. S4.

We quantify the statistical signiﬁcance of a given correlation value
observed from the data by measuring the probability (i.e. P—value) of
observing by chance a better value (i.e. the same or higher value when
the original value is positive or the same or lower value when the original
value is negative). We do this by randomly reshufﬂing the 37 node cen-
trality values at the 37 ages and by computing the resulting ‘random
correlation’. We repeat this 999 999 times to get 999999 random correl-
ations, which in addition to the data correlation totals to 1000 000 cor-
relation values (Phipson and Smyth, 2010). We compute the P—value as
the percentage of the 1000000 values in which the random correlation
(including the data correlation) is better than the data correlation. We
perform multiple test correction of each P—value to control the false-
discovery rate in our predictions (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). We
predict a gene to be aging-related if its q—value (the adjusted P-value after
multiple test correction) is <0.01.

Because we study multiple node centralities, each of which can predict
the given gene to be aging-related, we score our predictions so that the
more centrality measures support a prediction and the higher the signiﬁ-
cance of the change of its centrality values with age, the higher the score
and the more credible the prediction. For details, see Supplementary
Section S1.7.

2.3.3 Validation of predicted aging-related genes

Statistical signiﬁcance of our predictions. To test whether our approach
of combining static network data with aging-related expression data into
the dynamic network data actually gives meaningful predictions, we study
whether the number of aging-related genes that we predict from the
actual data is statistically signiﬁcantly larger than the number of aging-
related genes that we predict from ‘randomized data’. By ‘randomized
data’, we mean that we randomize the expression data before integrating
it with the static network data (Supplementary Section S1.8). Then, we
integrate the randomized expression data with the static PPI network,
construct randomized age-speciﬁc networks just as in Section 2.1.3 and
predict aging-related genes from the randomized networks just as in
Section 2.3.2. We repeat the above procedure multiple times, to assign
a P-value to the number of predictions that we make from the actual data
(Supplementary Section S1.8).

Overlap between genes of different data sets. We measure the statistical
signiﬁcance of the overlap between genes of two data sets by using the
hypergeometric test, which computes probability P (i.e. P-value) of obser-
ving the same or larger overlap by chance as follows. Let E be the set of
genes from StatNetExpression. Let A be the subset of genes from E that
are in any one of the data sets. Let G be the subset of genes from E that
are in the other data set. Let 0 be the overlap between A and G. Then:

|0|—1(I€I)(iEi—_izri)
p = 1 — Z ’ 'G' ’ We use the P—value threshold of 0.05.

. lEl

Gene Ontology enrichment. We study the enrichment of a data set in
biological process Gene Ontology (GO) terms (Ashburner et al., 2000).
We use (i) all 5450 GO terms that annotate (independent on the evidence
code) at least two genes from StatNetExpression and (ii) 2392 GO terms
that annotate (with respect to an experimental evidence code only) at least
two genes from StatNetExpression. For a GO term g, we compute the
statistical signiﬁcance of its enrichment via the above hypergeometric test
formula, where now E is the set of genes from StatNetExpression that are
annotated by any GO term, A is the gene set in which we are measuring
GO term enrichment, G is the subset of genes from E that are annotated
by GO term g and 0 is the set of genes in the overlap between A and G.
We use the P-value threshold of 0.05.

GO term overlap. We measure the statistical signiﬁcance of the overlap
of GO terms enriched in one data set and GO terms enriched in another
data set via the above hypergeometric test formula, where now E is the set
of GO terms that annotate at least two genes from StatNetExpression, A

is the set of GO terms enriched in any one of the two data sets, G is the set
of GO terms enriched in the other data set and 0 is the set of GO terms
that are in the overlap between A and G. We use the P—value threshold
of 0.05.

Disease Ontology enrichment. We study the enrichment of a data set in
all 527 Disease Ontology (DO) terms that annotate at least two genes
from StatNetExpression GDu et al., 2009) in the same way as when we
study GO term enrichments.

DO term overlap. We study the overlap of DO terms from different
data sets in the same way as when we study GO term overlaps.

Literature validation. We automatically search for a gene in PubMed
(http://www.pubmed.gov) and consider the gene to be validated in
the context of aging if its name is mentioned (according to NCBI’s

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

We study global topologies of the age-speciﬁc networks in
Section 3.1. We study local topologies of proteins in each net-
work and predict aging-related genes in Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2.
We validate our predictions in Section 3.2.3.

3.1 Global network topologies do not change with age

3.1.1 Global properties of age-specific networks are
similar Average clustering coefﬁcients, average diameters and
graphlet frequency distributions (Section 2.2.1) of the age-
speciﬁc networks do not signiﬁcantly change with age
(Supplementary Figs. S1 and S2).

3.1.2 Networks at different ages belong to the same graph
family We compare the ﬁt of the age-speciﬁc networks to six
network models (Section 2.2.2). The best-ﬁtting model does not
change with age (Supplementary Figs. S1 and S2). Note that our
primary goal is not to identify the best-ﬁtting model for dynamic
PPI networks. Nonetheless, consistent with results for static PPI
networks (Kuchaiev et al., 2011; PrZulj et al., 2010; Ratmann
et al., 2009), it is gene duplication models that ﬁt the age-speciﬁc
networks the best.

3.1.3 Overlap of age-specific networks is large The age-speciﬁc
networks share on average 92% of the nodes and 89% of the
edges, depending on age, whereas every pair of the networks
shares at least 82% of the nodes and 74% of the edges
(Supplementary Fig. S3). Hence, the network overlaps are
quite large.

3.2 Local topologies of proteins do change with age

3.2.1 Prediction of aging-related genes Depending on a study,
gene expression data alone can reveal as few as 442 (Lu et al.,
2004) or as many as 8277 (Berchtold et al., 2008) of the human
genes as aging-related. We integrate the gene expression data
(Berchtold et al., 2008) with the human PPI network, forming
dynamic age-speciﬁc networks, to investigate whether data inte-
gration can contribute to our understanding of aging. While
global network analysis has failed to uncover any aging-related
information, it could be that the dynamic network data encode
aging-related information only locally and around only a subset

of nodes. Therefore, we use centrality measures (Section 2.3.1) to
quantify local positions of nodes in the age-speciﬁc networks and
ﬁnd nodes whose centralities correlate well with age; as such
proteins could be key players in aging.

We predict a gene to be aging-related if its centrality values are
statistically signiﬁcantly correlated with age (Section 2.3.2) for at
least one centrality measure. This results in 537 (5.7%) predic-
tions out of all 9426 genes. Fig. 2a shows the number of aging-re-
lated predictions for each centrality individually and all
centralities combined. Some measures, and GDC in particular,
are superior to others in terms of the number of their aging-
related predictions. Importantly, GDC is a sensitive measure of
network topology, as it captures the extended network neighbor-
hood around a node. As such, its superiority is not necesarily
surprising (Milenkovié et al., 2011).

A gene’s centrality can be positively correlated with age (the
gene becomes more network-central with age) or it can be nega-
tively correlated with age (the gene becomes less network-central
with age). Interestingly, even though it has already been argued
that aging is associated with failure of ‘hubs’, highly intercon-
nected and thus network-central proteins (Soltow et al., 2010),
the majority of our predictions are positively correlated with age
(Fig. 2).

3.2.2 Relationships and potential redundancies of diﬁ‘erent node
centralities We predict a gene to be aging-related if its central-
ity values correlate well with age with respect to at least one
centrality. So, we study whether any genes are predicted by
more than one or even all of the centralities. We ﬁnd that
almost half (47%) of the 537 aging-related predictions are sup-
ported by multiple centralities, while the remaining predictions
are supported by a single centrality (Fig. 2b). As expected, the
number of predictions decreases as the number of centralities
supporting the predictions increases.

We study redundancies of the different centralities by comput-
ing, for each pair of centralities, the correlation between their
centrality values over all nodes in a network, and by averaging
correlations over the 37 age-speciﬁc networks. We observe
high correlations between some measures, such as BETWC,
DEGC, KC and GDC or CLOSEC and ECC (Fig. 3a and
Supplementary Section S2.1). Thus, some centralities appear to
be redundant to others.

When we study pairwise overlaps of aging-related predictions
produced by the different centralities, we still observe high over-
laps between some (though not all) centralities (Fig. 3b). For
example, each prediction made by ECC is supported by at
least one other centrality measure. The overlaps are encouraging,
as they increase the credibility of predictions supported by mul-
tiple centrality measures.

Yet, given that the majority (~53 %) of the predictions are
identiﬁed by a single centrality (Fig. 2b), it seems that not all
centralities are redundant to each other. And when we focus on
our aging-related genes predicted by exactly one centrality, in
most cases, these predictions are not even marginally signiﬁcant
with respect to other centralities (Fig. 3c and Supplementary
Fig. S6), indicating again that the different centralities are in
general not redundant to each other. Thus, we keep all 537 pre-
dictions, independent on the number of centralities supporting
them. Henceforth, we denote this set of 537 aging-related genes

while another measure identiﬁes the same gene as negatively correlated with age. (Panel (c) shows the overlaps of our predictions with aging-related genes
from the four ‘ground truth’ data sets [BrainExpression2008Age (BEA8), BrainExpression2004Age (BEA4), ADExpressionAge (ADEA) and

overlaps are noted at the top of the bars. The results in the ﬁgure are consistent when we use Spearman correlation to predict aging-related genes instead

Fig. 3. Relationships between different centralities (BETWC, CLOSEC,
CLUSC, DEGC, ECC, GDC and KC): (a) Spearman correlation be-
tween each pair of centralities averaged over the 37 age-speciﬁc networks;
0)) pairwise overlap of aging-related genes predicted by the different
centralities; (c) percentage of genes predicted as aging-related (q-value
5 0.01; q—value is the adjusted P—value after multiple test correction) by
exactly one centrality (listed in a row), which have a ‘marginal’ q-value
between 0.01 and 0.05 with respect to one of the six remaining centralities
(listed in a column) and (d) distributions of q—values of our predicted
aging-related genes. Panel (c) can be interpreted as follows. For example,
many predictions made by BETWC (the last row) are marginally signiﬁ-
cant with respect to CLOSEC, DEGC and GDC (intensive color),
whereas very few of the predictions made by ECC (the third row) are
marginally signiﬁcant with respect to any other centrality (light color).
Hence, the predictions made by BETWC only may be more credible than
the predictions made by ECC only, as the former are marginally sup-
ported by additional centralities, whereas the latter are not

predicted Via dynamic network analysis as DyNetAge. We denote
the complement of this set, i.e. the set of genes that are present in
StatNetExpression but not in DyNetAge, as DyNetComplement.
Clearly, DyNetComplement is the set of genes whose network
centralities do not signiﬁcantly correlate with age, and as such,
we do not predict them to be aging-related.

Next, we study the effect of the number of centralities support-
ing a prediction on the prediction’s quality. It is not necessarily
the case that predictions supported by many centralities are more
enriched in ‘ground truth’ aging-related genes (see below) com-
pared with predictions supported by only few centralities
(Supplementary Fig. S7). However, it is the case that the more
centralities support a prediction, the more signiﬁcant the correl-
ation of its centrality values with age (Fig. 3d). Hence, to account
for the number of centralities supporting a prediction, we rank
the prediction so that the more centralities support it and the
more signiﬁcant the change of its centrality values with age, the
more credible the prediction (Section 2.3.2). (Supplementary
Tables S1 and S2 rank the predictions.)

3.2.3 Validation of predicted aging-related genes

Dynamic network analysis gives meaningful and statistically
signiﬁcant aging-related predictions. The number of aging-related
genes in DyNetAge is statistically signiﬁcantly larger than the
number of aging-related genes that we can predict from the
‘randomized’ data (P-Value of 5.3 x 10‘9; Section 2.3.3).

Overlap of our predictions with ‘ground truth’ aging-related
genes is signiﬁcant. Human aging is hard to study experimentally
due to long life span and ethical constraints. Instead, human
aging-related ‘ground truth’ knowledge has been predicted
more or less computationally, by studying expression data or
by transferring aging-related knowledge from model species Via
sequence comparison. (We intentionally use quotes, as we are not
dealing with experimental ground truth data.) Similarly, here, we
aim to predict new ‘ground truth’ data from an additional data

Dynamic networks in aging

 

type — PPIs. (But, by no means do we claim to identify all aging-
related genes.)

Because ‘ground truth’ data are predicted computationally,
they could be noisy. Also, different ‘ground truth’ sets could
be biased toward different data types from which the predictions
have been made, be it expression, sequence or PPI data. Because
different data types could be capturing different functional slices
of the cell (Memisevié et al., 2010b; Przytycka and Kim, 2010), it
might not be alarming if overlaps between the different ‘ground
truth’ sets are not large. However, because all the sets aim to
capture the same biological phenomenon (aging), some overlap
should exist. Ideally, one would hope for a statistically signiﬁcant
overlap. However, the existence of any (even non-signiﬁcant)
overlap would be encouraging, because (i) the overlap could be
low due to the noisiness of each ‘ground truth’ set and (ii) stat-
istically non-signiﬁcant results may be biologically important,
whereas statistically signiﬁcant results may not be (Ho et al.,
2010; Milenkovié et al., 2010).

We measure the overlap of DyNetAge with four ‘ground truth’
data sets: BrainExpression2008Age, BrainExpression2004Age,
ADExpressionAge and SequenceAge (Section 2.1.4). Of the
four, BrainExpression2008Age and BrainExpression2004Age are
the most likely to be similar to DyNetAge (as all three are based
on brain-related data, brain-related gene expression data and brain
aging-related gene expression data; Supplementary Section S2.2),
followed by ADExpressionAge (as our predictions as well as these
data are both based on brain-related data and brain-related gene
expression data), followed by SequenceAge (as our predictions
and these data both capture aging-related information but from
different data types) (Section 2.1.4). Therefore, a high overlap of
DyNetAge with BrainExpression2008Age or BrainExpressio-
n2004Age would validate our method. A high overlap with
ADExpressionAge would suggest that our method could capture
not only brain aging-related genes but also brain aging-related
disease genes. A high overlap with SequenceAge would suggest
that our method could capture genes identiﬁed from a different
data type, namely, sequence data.

And this is exactly what we observe in general (Supplementary
Fig. S8 and Supplementary Table S4). DyNetAge’s overlap is
statistically signiﬁcant for BrainExpression2008Age, Brain-
Expression2004Age and ADExpressionAge, and marginally sig-
niﬁcant for SequenceAge (Table 1). The (marginally) signiﬁcant
overlap between DyNetAge and all four ‘ground truth’ data sets
is encouraging. Importantly, even though most of the overlaps
are signiﬁcant, 26%, 94%, 78% and 96% of our DyNetAge
predictions are not in BrainExpression2008Age, BrainExpressio-
n2004Age, ADExpressionAge and SequenceAge, respectively,
and 20% of our predictions are not in any of the four data
sets (Supplementary Table S5). This conﬁrms that data integra-
tion can reveal additional knowledge compared with studying
individual data types.

Recall that the complement of each ‘ground truth’ data set
(including DyNetAge) is the set of genes not predicted as
aging-related by the given study (Section 2.1.5). Hence, it
would be encouraging to see (i) low (non-signiﬁcant) overlaps
between DyNetAge and complements of the ‘ground truth’
data sets, (ii) low (non-signiﬁcant) overlaps between
DyNetComplement and ‘ground truth’ sets and (iii) high (signiﬁ-
cant) overlaps between DyNetComplement and complements of

‘ground truth’ sets. This is what we typically observe in all three
cases (Supplementary Table S4).

GO enrichment. Two-hundred thirty-three GO terms are sig-
niﬁcantly enriched in DyNetAge (P-Values between 0.049 and
5 x 10‘6), whereas only 9 GO terms are enriched in
DyNetComplement (P-Values between 0.043 and 6.5 x 104)
(Section 2.3.3). Of aging-related GO terms, it is encouraging
that DyNetAge is marginally signiﬁcantly enriched in cell aging
(P-Value of 0.052) as well as (though not signiﬁcantly) in aging,
multicellular organismal aging and cellular senescence.
Importantly, DyNetAge’s performance in this context is typically
comparable with that of the ‘ground truth’ data, especially when
using only gene-GO term associations obtained by experimental
evidence codes (Supplementary Section S2.3).

GO overlap. Our predictions are further validated by (i) high
GO term overlaps between DyNetAge and the ‘ground truth’
data sets, (ii) low GO term overlaps between DyNetAge and
complements of the ‘ground truth’ sets, (iii) low GO term overlaps
between DyNetComplement and the ‘ground truth’ sets and (iv)
high GO term overlaps between DyNetComplement and comple-
ments of the ‘ground truth’ sets (Table 1 and Supplementary
Table S6). For example, when considering gene-GO term associ-
ations of any evidence code, GO terms from DyNetAge signiﬁ-
cantly overlap with G0 terms from three of the four ‘ground
truth’ sets (BrainExpression2008Age, BrainExpression2004Age
and SequenceAge), and some (though non-signiﬁcant) overlap
with G0 terms from ADExpressionAge is also encouraging
(Table 1). Results when considering gene-GO term associations
of experimental evidence codes are shown in Supplementary
Table S7. Importantly, GO term overlap is signiﬁcant between
DyNetAge and BrainExpressionAge2008, whereas it is non-sig-
niﬁcant between SequenceAge and BrainExpressionAge2008,
indicating the superiority of DyNetAge over SequenceAge in
this context (Supplementary Section S2.4).

DO enrichment. Twelve diseases are signiﬁcantly enriched in
DyNetAge (P-Values between 0.048 and 1.5 x 10‘3), whereas no
disease is enriched in DyNetComplement (Section 2.3.3). The 12
diseases in DyNetAge are pemphigoid bullous, lupus erythemato-
sus, infection by Cryptococcus neoformans, capillaries disease,
Wiskott—Aldrich syndrome, Kuhnt—Junius degeneration, carcin-
oma, Rett syndrome, skin cancer, infection, myeloproliferative dis-
ease and IgA glomerulonephritis. Kuhnt—Junius degeneration,

lupus erythematosus, myeloproliferative disease and skin cancer
are not only enriched in SequenceAge as well but these disease
have also been explicitly linked to aging in the literature
[PubMed IDs (PMIDs): 11587915, 11318593, 24138668 and
17942417, respectively]. Pemphigoid bullous is not only enriched
in BrainExpression2008Age as well but this disease also shows
increased risk in old patients (PMID: 10426901). Rett syndrome
is not only enriched in BrainExpression2004Age as well but this
disease also shows aging-related changes in physiological pro-
cesses of patients (PMID: 11247011). Supplementary Table S8
maps the PMIDs to full-paper references. Importantly, even ﬁve
of the six diseases from DyNetAge that are missed by all ‘ground
truth’ sets can all be linked to aging in the literature as well
(Supplementary Section S2.5).

DO overlap. We further validate our predictions by
demonstrating (i) high DO term overlaps between DyNetAge
and the ‘ground truth’ data sets, (ii) low DO term overlaps be-
tween DyNetAge and complements of the ‘ground truth’ sets,
(iii) low DO term overlaps between DyNetComplement and the
‘ground truth’ sets and (iv) high DO term overlaps between
DyNetComplement and complements of the ‘ground truth’ sets
(Supplementary Table S9). It is encouraging that DO terms from
DyNetAge overlap with DO terms from BrainExpressio-
nAge2008, BrainExpressionAge2004 and SequenceAge (though
the overlaps are non-signiﬁcant) (Table 1). Importantly, diseases
from DyNetAge do not signiﬁcantly overlap with diseases from
complements of the ‘ground truth’ sets, whereas diseases from
SequenceAge do signiﬁcantly overlap with diseases from both
BrainExpression2008Age and ADExpressionAge. This indicates
superiority of DyNetAge over SequenceAge in this context. For
details, see Supplementary Section S2.6.

Literature validation. Automatic literature validation (Section
2.3.3) is prone to errors: we ‘Validate’ in this manner equal por-
tion of each ‘ground truth’ aging-related set and its complement.
Therefore, we aim to validate our predictions manually (Section
2.3.3). Because manual validation is laborious, we focus on our
10% highest-scoring predictions (Section 2.3.2). Of these, we
study all eight predictions that are absent from any ‘ground
truth’ set, namely, CD22, CTRL, HMG20B, TRIM21,
UBA52, USP45, OXSRl and POLE2. Importantly, we success-
fully validate all these genes as follows. An aging-associated de-
cline has been found in B cell precursors of bone marrow,
whereas CD22 is one of the markers of B cell precursors
(PMID: 19967915). An aging-dependent degradation has been
found in CTRL that affects chymotrypsin—like activity in the
retina (PMID: 17258201). HMG20B is regulated by the activity
of BRCA2 tumor suppressor, whereas cancers and tumors are
known to be aging-associated diseases (PMID: 21399666).
TRIM21 is involved in a pathway that acts as a potential
driver of lung tumorigenesis, whereas cancers and tumors are
known to be aging-associated diseases (PMID: 21399661).
UBA52 has been found to be signiﬁcantly downregulated with
respect to aging-associated degenerative diseases of the eye
(PMID: 23601964). Aging-related changes have been found in
the ubiquitin—proteasome system, whereas USP45 belongs to the
ubiquitin—speciﬁc protease gene family (PMID: 12944592). It has
been found that oxidative stress responsive transcription factor
pathway is activated during aging in cardiac muscle (PMID:
9011632), whereas OXSRl performs oxidative stress responsive

function. Finally, mutations in POLE2 have been found to be
linked to human colorectal cancer, whereas cancers and tumors
are known to be aging-associated diseases (PMID: 20065316).

As a negative control for literature search, we also aim to
validate genes from DyNetComplement, in hope that their val-
idation rate will be lower than the validation rate of the above
eight highest-scoring predictions. For a fair evaluation, we arbi-
trarily select eight lowest-scoring genes from
DyNetComplement, and we perform manual literature valid-
ation on these genes in the same manner as for the above eight
highest-scoring predictions. As we had hoped, we ﬁnd only one
of them to be aging-related, which further increases conﬁdence in
our aging-related predictions from DyNetAge. For details, see
Supplementary Section S27.

3.3 Robustness to the choice of gene expression data

To validate the robustness of our approach, we also base our
predictions on an alternative gene expression data obtained by
RNA-seq instead of microarray technology (Section 2.1.1), in the
hope that the resulting predictions (which we denote by
DyNetAgeRNASeq) will signiﬁcantly overlap with the ‘ground
truth’ data (including DyNetAge). Indeed, 172 predictions from
DyNetAgeRNASeq (Supplementary Table S3) signiﬁcantly
overlap with BrainExpressionAge2008 (P-Value of 1.7 x 10‘3),
BrainExpressionAge2004 (P-Value of 0.01) and
ADExpressionAge (P-Value of 3.9 x 10‘3). Also, they overlap
(though not signiﬁcantly) with SequenceAge and DyNetAge.
Existence of any (even non-signiﬁcant) overlap is still encoura-
ging (Section 3.2.3). Thus, our approach results in meaningful
predictions independent on the choice of the data.

4 CONCLUSION

Together, our results conﬁrm that dynamic PPI network analysis
via integration of static PPI network data with aging-related gene
expression data can reveal meaningful key players in aging.

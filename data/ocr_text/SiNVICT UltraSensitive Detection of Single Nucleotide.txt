Abstract

Motivation: Successful development and application of precision oncology approaches require robust
elucidation of the genomic landscape of a patient’s cancer and, ideally, the ability to monitor therapy-
induced genomic changes in the tumour in an inexpensive and minimally invasive manner. Thanks to
recent advances in sequencing technologies, "liquid biopsy", the sampling of patient’s bodily fluids such
as blood and urine, is considered as one of the most promising approaches to achieve this goal. In many
cancer patients, and especially those with advanced metastatic disease, deep sequencing of circulating
cell-free DNA (chNA) obtained from patient’s blood yields a mixture of reads originating from the normal
DNA and from multiple tumour subclones - called circulating tumour DNA or ctDNA. The ctDNA/chNA
ratio as well as the proportion of ctDNA originating from specific tumour subclones depend on multiple
factors, making comprehensive detection of mutations difficult, especially at early stages of cancer.
Furthermore, sensitive and accurate detection of SNVs and indels from chNA is constrained by several
factors such as the sequencing errors and PCR artifacts, and mapping errors related to repeat regions
within the genome. In this paper, we introduce SiNVICT, a computational method that increases the
sensitivity and specificity of SNV and indel detection at very low variant allele frequencies. SiNVICT has
the capability to handle multiple sequencing platforms with different error properties; it minimises false
positives resulting from mapping errors and other technology specific artifacts including strand bias and
low base quality at read ends. SiNVICT also has the capability to perform time-series analysis, where
samples from a patient sequenced at multiple time points are jointly examined to report locations of
interest where there is a possibility that certain clones were wiped out by some treatment while some
subclones gained selective advantage.

Results: We tested SiNVICT on simulated data as well as prostate cancer cell lines and chNA obtained
from castration-resistant prostate cancer patients. On both simulated and biological data, SiNVICT was
able to detect SNVs and indels with variant allele percentages as low as 0.5%. The lowest amounts
of total DNA used for the biological data where SNVs and indels could be detected with very high
sensitivity were 2.5ng on the Ion Torrent platform and 10ng on Illumina. With increased sequencing and
mapping accuracy, SiNVICT might be utilised in clinical settings, making it possible to track the progress
of point mutations and indels that are associated with resistance to cancer therapies and provide patients
personalised treatment. We also compared SiNVICT with other popular SNV callers such as MuTect,
VarScan2, and Freebayes. Our results show that SiNVICT performs better than these tools in most cases
and allows further data exploration such as time-series analysis on chNA sequencing data.

1 Introduction

One of the most promising areas of precision oncology is the development
of custom targeted therapies tailored for a patient. Successful development
and efﬁcient application of such therapies require efﬁcient and inexpensive
identiﬁcation and monitoring of therapy-induced changes in a patient’s
tumour DNA. Unfortunately, especially in advanced stage cancers, the
main cause of cancer’s morbidity and mortality is the development of
multiple metastatic lesions, often not easily accessible for tissue sampling.
For example, in prostate cancer more than 90% of metastases occur in bone
and/or deep lymph nodes (Bubendorf et al., 2000). Biopsying such sites
is associated with signiﬁcant morbidity for the patients and thus is not
commonly performed.

The existence of circulating cell free DNA (chNA) in mammalian
blood has been known since 1948 (Mandel, 1948). chNA is thought to
be released from the dying (necrotic/apoptotic) cells - both normal and
tumour, as has been shown in 1994 when mutated RAS gene fragments
were detected in the blood of cancer patients - see (Schwarzenbach
et al. , 2011). The non-speciﬁc mechanism of generating chNA results in
integral representation of all tumour DNA of a patient subject to sampling
variability and, possibly, to tumour’s access to blood stream. In an earlier
study, for example, we observed the presence of multiple mutated forms of
AR (androgen receptor) gene in chNA of patients with castrate resistant
prostate cancer (CRPC) (Azad etal. , 2015) that can be best explained by the
presence of multiple subpopulations of cancer cells in each patient’s body.
This integral representation of multiple tumour foci/subclones provides an
important advantage to the use of blood plasma as a source of tumour-
derived DNA. Unfortunately, the presence of both normal and tumour
DNA in a patient’s blood poses signiﬁcant challenges to the analysis of
chNA sequence data. To make matters worse, tumour DNA is many times
derived from multiple subclones and is thus highly heterogeneous. An
earlier study we performed on mutations in CRPC patients (Azad et al.,
2015) demonstrated that chNA comprised an average of 4.7% (IQR1
4.5%) of ctDNA, based on the proportion of reads with mutations in AR.

There are several somatic and germline mutation callers that were
developed to ﬁnd single nucleotide variants (SNVs) as well as indels within
a given population using WGSS (Whole Genome Shotgun Sequencing), as
well as to detect speciﬁc variants in a patient’s genome through sampling
multiple loci from the same patient. Examples include GATK (McKenna
et al., 2010), VarScan2 (Koboldt et al., 2012), Freebayes (Garrison and
Marth, 2012), Strelka (Saunders et al., 2012), MuTect (Cibulskis et al.,
2013), and others. Most of these tools either use a frequentist or Bayesian
approach to estimate the probability of a locus being an actual mutation
instead of being a false positive caused by noise (due to sequencing or
mapping errors). Among them, VarScan2 uses several heuristics to reduce
the size of the candidate set and then applies some statistical test like
Fisher’s Exact on tumour/benign pairs to call somatic mutations. It also
provides post-processing capability to enable further ﬁltering based on
additional factors such as strand bias. Other tools such as Freebayes,
MuTect, and Strelka make use of the prior and posterior probabilities of
a location being mutated in a Bayesian context in order to call mutations.
Unfortunately, these tools are not designed to work with (i) sequencing
data from patients at multiple time points, (ii) very high read depth (e. g.
20k-30k average, up to 90k and possibly more in the future), or, (iii)

 

1 IQR: the interquartile range is a measure of variability, based on dividing
a data set into quartiles. Quartiles divide a rank-ordered data set into four
equal parts. The values that divide each part are called the ﬁrst, second,
and third quartiles; and they are denoted by Q1, Q2, and Q3, respectively
and IQR = Q3 - Q2 (Speedy Publishing LLC, 2014).

extremely low dilutions (can be as low as around 0.01% variant allele
percentage (Lipson et al., 2014)), or, (iv) samples with high intra-tumour
heterogeneity, or, (v) batches of samples that suffer from systematic noise.
In addition, ctDNA levels can also be below the analytical sensitivity of
existing ctDNA detection approaches in patients with localized disease
and in patients that have received therapy (Bettegowda et al. , 2014).

In order to address problems mentioned above, we introduce SiNVICT
a computational tool that can handle very high read depth and very low
dilutions. SiNVICT can be run on a single tumour sample, on a batch
of multiple tumour samples, or on multiple samples from a single patient
sequenced at multiple time points. This feature allows SiNVICT to process
samples from a single patient in multiple cancer stages, as well as a group
of different patients that are being sequenced and analyzed at the same
time. In cases where these samples have similar disease progression and
dilution levels, SiNVICT can make use of the Signal-to-Noise ratio of
the batch (explained later) to characterise the systematic noise and try to
reduce the number of false positives due to the non-uniformity of noise
across the sequenced regions.

We evaluated robustness of SiNVICT on data obtained by two
sequencing platforms with distinct error rates (0.1% substitution in
Illumina; 1% indel in IonTorrent (Glenn, 2011)), which were applied
to the same tumour samples. Our experiments indicate that SiNVICT is
highly sensitive to calls on data generated by both sequencing platforms.
For example, three previously validated AR (Androgen Receptor gene)
mutations (Azad et al., 2015) in a mixture of 22RV1 and 49C cell-lines
- which were used as reference in AmpliSeq2 calibration and Illumina
calibration experiments - were detected with almost identical sensitivity by
SiNVICT. SiNVICT was also able to detect previously validated mutations
successfully from actual chNA sequencing data obtained from castrate
resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients. These ﬁndings suggest that
SiNVICT might be utilised in the analysis of deep sequencing cancer data
obtained from both Ion Torrent and Illumina sequencing technologies.

As importantly, SiNVICT addresses a unique problem and is not
comparable to existing popular SNV and indel callers (e. g. GATK)
particularly because such tools typically process a fraction of the reads in
datasets with high sequencing depth since multiple occurrences of identical
reads are marked as PCR duplicates. However, identical reads are to be
expected in deep amplicon sequencing and this is not necessarily an artifact
of PCR.

2 Methods

As shown in Figure 1, SiNVICT works in three steps: (i) pre-processing of
raw input, (ii) SNV and indel discovery, (iii) post-processing and reporting
the ﬁnal calls. Details are given in the relevant subsections below.

2.1 Preprocessing Steps

SiNVICT pre-processes and prepares the raw input ﬁle from sequencers
for actual detection of SNVs and indels through the following substeps.

Trimming. SiNVICT trims the input reads in order to remove any
remaining primers or very low quality bases at the ends of reads. If the
reads have already been properly trimmed and quality checked, SiNVICT
can skip this substep.

Mapping. Once the reads are trimmed, read mapping can be performed
using any short read aligner that allows mapping with indels, i.e. mrFAST-
fastHASH (Xin et al., 2013), BWA (Li and Durbin, 2009), etc. SiNVICT
sorts the mapping output with respect to genomic loci.

Recalibration and error correction of low quality mappings. SiNVICT
re-calibrates the “base quality” of low-quality/ambiguous mappings with
the goal of improving the mapping accuracy and reducing the noise
(errors) introduced by these mappings for downstream analysis. After re-
calibration, SiNVICT performs local assembly to do error correction on
the bases. The newly corrected reads are then re-aligned to the reference
genome per the previous substep. The ﬁnal product of this substep is thus
a set of re—calibrated and error-corrected high quality mappings that will
be used for the main part of our method.

We use the tool ABRA (Mose et al., 2014) for recalibration and error
correction of initial mappings. For performing calculations on variant allele
frequencies we use the bam-readcount tool which provides an interface to
samtools pileup. This provides detailed statistics for every single location
within the target regions, including the reference base, read depth, variant
alleles, base counts for each allele, reads mapped to the forward and reverse
strands, average base qualities, average mapping qualities, the distance of
the location from the ends of the read as a fraction, etc.

2.2 Somatic Mutation and lndel Discovery Step

The main goals of SiNVICT are to identify mutations (somatic or germline)
from read errors and to distinguish potential somatic mutations originating
from tumour genomes from allelic variation (due to germline events) in the
normal genome. SiNVICT achieves this by calculating for each potential
mutation (or indel) locus, the probability of the mutation being real (as a
function of the error rate observed for the sequencing platform), as well
as that for the observed allelic distribution being a result of a somatic
mutation vs a germline mutation, through the use of a Poisson model.
In other words, SiNVICT returns the p-value (p) and conﬁdence score
(Q = 10 - loglo p) for each potential mutation as well as those for each
mutation being somatic.

In order to calculate the p-values, SiNVICT processes the readcount
data to obtain the initial set of calls. For that SiNVICT uses (i) N: the
total number of reads covering a position, (ii) K: the number of reads that
support a mutation for that position, and (iii) r: the average error rate (for
each position, determined by the sequencing platform).

Based on this, SiNVICT calculates p1 , the p-value of the mutation as
follows (Illumina, 2013).

p1 = P(Kl>\1) = 641 Z —1
i=0

i! (1)

The above Poisson cumulative distribution function (CDF) gives the
probability that there is an actual mutation at a particular position, if out
of N reads covering that position, K reads support a variant allele. Note
that given the average error rate T, A1 = N X r. SiNVICT allows the
user to set a threshold for the p-value p1 implicitly via the conﬁdence
score conversion (Q = 10 - loglo p1). SiNVICT will not report calls with
conﬁdence score below the user deﬁned threshold.

Once it has been established that there is an actual mutation at a
particular locus, we can again use the Poisson model to calculate p2, the
p-value of the mutation being somatic by setting A2 = N / 2.

p2 = P(Kl>\2) = 642 Z -_2
i=0

2! (2)

In this case, A2 is the average number of events per interval in a Poisson
distribution and N is the total number of reads covering a location. The
null hypothesis here is that the observed mutation is germline. In this case,
around half (i.e. N / 2) of the reads covering this locus are expected to
include the mutation and thus A2 is set to N / 2.

This Poisson model has high sensitivity (on both Illumina and Ion
Torrent Proton platforms) and can introduce many false positives due
to the following. Both Illumina and Proton native mutation callers are
designed to run on the mapping data from a single tumour sample, without
any consideration for strand bias or the read depth. In addition neither of
these callers take into account systematic noise characteristics during the
processing of multiple samples. These result in an inﬂation in the number
of mutation candidates, making further downstream analysis virtually
intractable. In order to reduce the number of the candidates, we thus apply
a number of post-processing steps as described below.

2.3 Postprocessing Steps

SiNVICT applies a number of postprocessing ﬁlters to the candidate
locations to increase its speciﬁcity as follows.

Minimum Read Depth ﬁlter SiNVICT has a ﬁlter to discard locations that
do not meet the minimum read depth. While SiNVICT is intended to be
used with ultra-deep sequencing data, some locations will still have very
low coverage due to the limitations of the sequencing technologies. Thus,
the read depth is very often non-uniform across the locations. In "low
coverage" (< minimum read depth) regions, the sequencing errors can be
misinterpreted as SNVs or indels and thus are ﬁltered out.

Strand Bias ﬁlter The strand bias for a genomic location i (see equation 3)
is deﬁned as the ratio of the number of reads that are mapped to the forward
strand to the total number of reads mapped for that genomic location.
StrandBiaSi = NumReadsForwardi (3)
NumReadsTotali
If the potential strand bias is outside of the range [0.5 — e, 0.5 —I— 6],
then we say that there is a real strand bias in the associated genomic region.
Strand bias could lead to both false positives and false negatives. However,
most of the regions generated by Illumina sequencing technology have
strand bias primarily causing false positives (Guo et al. , 2012). In contrast,
Ion Torrent technology is known to return only a few regions with real
strand bias and for that we only ﬁlter regions with extremely high strand
bias value. It should be noted that while the strand-bias ﬁltering can usually
be more conservative for AmpliSeq (Ion Torrent) technology, due to the
level of noise in our calibration experiment, SiNVICT ﬁlters a larger
number of locations than normally expected.

There is no deﬁnitive cut-off for the strand bias values in general but
we have obtained good results for e = 0.1. The SNV/indel calls for which
there is a real strand bias are declared to be of lower conﬁdence and are
ﬁltered out.

H omopolymer Regions. Calling SNVs and indels in homopolymer regions
are very challenging because mapping the reads correctly to these regions
are very difﬁcult. This source of bias can cause many false positive calls.
To eliminate these false positives, for each location that was called (as an
SNV or indel) earlier, we check the consecutive 3 bases on both sides of
this location and declare it as a lower conﬁdence call (to be ﬁltered out) if
either side contains 3 identical bases.

Fig. 2. Calculating the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) in multiple samples across several
genomic loci. The x-axis depicts 5 loci from a set of samples such that each sample is
represented by a distinct colour. For each location on the x-axis, the corresponding value on
the y-axis indicates the percentage of the most frequent variant allele. The chance of any one
of the loci indicated above having a "uniform" variant allele frequency distribution across 5
unrelated samples is very low and thus there must be location dependent noise in the variant
allele frequency estimates. Most current SNV callers will report a potential mutation for one
of the samples in locations 1 and 2 while they will report a potential mutation for 4 out of
5 samples in location 5. They will not make any calls for locations 3 and 4 because of their
negligible measured variant allele frequencies. For the last position, all samples but one
show substantial evidence for a potential mutation when examined individually. The SNR
ﬁlter utilized by SiNVICT allows such cases to be ﬁltered out under the assumption that
SNVs are expected to be unique to a few patients among a batch for all practical purposes.

Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) in multiple samples. Different regions of
the genome can have different noise levels because of the sequencing
technology (see Figure 2). Therefore having the average noise information
for a particular genomic locus across a number of samples can be very
useful in assessing the likelihood of a false positive. As mentioned earlier,
SiNVICT is capable of performing analysis on a cohort of samples. In
such cases, SiNVICT calculates and stores the average noise level for each
location across the samples. Consequently, these average noise values are
used to distinguish noisy locations from actual variants, and eventually
detect the ﬁnal set of SNVs and indels more accurately.

For calling a location an SNV (or indel) in noisy regions, we calculate
the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) as the ratio of mean and standard deviation
of major variant allele frequency across the samples within the panel, as
per equation 4. The mean ,ui can be calculated as per equation 5 and the

standard deviation, 17,-, is given in equation 6; in both equations the sum
is taken across n samples in the panel, where i is the current genomic
location and j is the current sample.

Each locus with major variant allele percentage 2 3X SNR is then
declared as a high conﬁdence variant. The remaining loci are ﬁltered out.

SiNVICT applies each one of the 4 ﬁlters in the order they are described
above, namely, (1) Read Depth, (2) Strand Bias, (3) Homopolymer and
(4) SNR. Each genomic locus, "passing" the ﬁrst k ﬁlters and "failing"
the k —I— 1st is added to the ﬁle associated with the ﬁlter it fails. Only the
genomic loci that pass all ﬁlters are considered to be high conﬁdence SNVs
(or indels) and are added to the master ﬁle.

2.4 Time Series Analysis

SiNVICT also provides the ability to perform time series analysis on
chNA sequencing data obtained from cancer patients on multiple time
points throughout their treatment. The goal here is to provide the user the
ability to assess whether speciﬁc mutations appear only in speciﬁc time
points or are present in all time points, sometimes with very low prevalence,
e. g. in support of the Big Bang theory of cancer (Sottoriva et al., 2015).
SiNVICT achieves this in two steps. (i) Genomic loci that were sequenced
successfully in all time points for a patient and assigned a sufﬁciently
high conﬁdence score (e. g. >= 90) in at least one of the time points by
the Poisson model used by SiNVICT (Equation 1) are chosen; (ii) Among
these, only the loci with high read depth (e. g. > = 1000) in all samples are
used so that only the highest conﬁdence regions are considered for the time
series analysis. On each of these loci, rather than relying on the Illumina
error rate estimate, SiNVICT calculates the localized error rate by using
the mean VAF (Variant Allele Frequency) from the 10 neighboring bases (5
on each side). The user can increase the size of the neighborhood (from 10
bases to any user speciﬁed number of bases) used to calculate the localized
error rate, at the cost of a higher running time. By calculating p-value of
the detected variant through the use of a localized error rate (rather than
the error rate provided by specs) SiNVICT reduces the position speciﬁc
and sequence content based biases in sequencing errors (Nakamura et al.,
2011). Based on the localized error rate, SiNVICT then recalculates the
p-value as 1 — (1 — errn)1/pe’"cm , where arm, is our error rate estimate
and percm is the percentage of reads that include the mutation.

3 Results

In order to evaluate our method, we performed the following experiments:
(i) we simulated insilico ctDNA/chNA with varying dilutions to
determine SiNVICT’s performance (precision/recall) in SNV detection,
(ii) we mixed 22RV1 and 49C prostate cancer cell-lines and sequenced
them with Ion Torrent and Illumina technologies to emulate various
tumour-normal mixture levels to measure SiNVICT’s SNV as well as
indel detection performance on a mixture of sequencing data, and ﬁnally
(iii) we explored the time-series analysis capabilities of SiNVICT on
cell-free DNA sequencing data from castration-resistant prostate cancer

patients (Wyatt et al., 2016) 3. We compared our method to widely used
SNV callers: MuTect, VarScan2, and Freebayes. In all the experiments,
SiNVICT outperforms Freebayes. Furthermore, our results show that
SiNVICT performs better than MuTect and VarScan2 in most cases for
ultra-deep sequencing data and allows further data exploration such as
time-series analysis on chNA sequencing data.

3.1 Simulated Data

3.1.1 SNV calling on simulated data.

We tested all four tools on simulated data obtained from version hg19 -
i.e. GRCh37- (Meyer et al., 2012) of the human reference genome. The
parameters that are used to run each tool are provided in Supplementary
Table 1. We extracted the exons of the AR gene with BEDTools (Quinlan
and Hall, 2010), representing the normal tissue, and introduced 18 random
SNVs to a copy of the original sequence as the "tumour" tissue. We then
used wgsim (part of Samtools (Li et al., 2009)) to simulate ultra-deep
sequencing with Illumina MiSeq. We tried to keep the parameters close to
the experimentally observed ones (read length = 145, insert size = 175). We
obtained an average read depth of x 20000 in 7 different tumour-normal
mixture levels (50%, 20%, 10%, 5%, 2.5%, 1%, and 0.5% tumour content
level).

SiNVICT was highly sensitive on this simulated data set: it was able
to detect all 18 mutations (as high conﬁdence SNVs) at tumour content
levels of 50%, 20%, 10%, 5%, and 2.5%. At tumour content level of 1%,
SiNVICT was able to detect 13 of the 18 mutations; at tumour content level
of 0.5% it detected 12 of the 18 mutations. With respect to speciﬁcity, out
of 8938 locations in the corresponding exons, SiNVICT called between
15 and 21 (with an average of 20) locations as high conﬁdence SNVs,
resulting in exactly 3 false positives per sample. In all the cases, SiNVICT
had a higher precision than MuTect, Freebayes, and VarScan2. In all except
one case (tumour content 1%), SiNVICT had a better (or equal) recall than
other tools. See Figure 3 and Supplementary Table 2 for details.

3.1.2 Indel calling on simulated data.

We also carried out an experiment to check the precision and recall of all
tools for indel calling on simulated data. From the same reference genome
used in the previous experiment, we extracted exons 2-5 of the PIK3CA
gene and manually added 4 indels (of size 2 each) and generated ﬁve
samples with different tumour-normal mixtures (50%,20%,10%,5%,1%)
with average read depth of x 14000, insert size of 150, and read length of
70. SiNVICT and VarScan2 had perfect precision and recall on all of the
samples. MuTect only missed two indels at 1% level. However, Freebayes
only reported indels on one sample and failed to report anything on the
others. See Supplementary Table 3 for details.

3.1.3 SNV calling on simulated data with intra-tumour heterogeneity.
We evaluated all methods on a more challenging dataset by building
a sample tumour phylogeny to simulate the effect of intra-tumour
heterogeneity. We increased the number of point mutations to 25 and
distributed them among 5 clones. Each clone was assigned 5 distinct
SNVs out of the 25; similar to (Malikic et al., 2015) we assume that our
mutations follow inﬁnite— sites model. This implies that each clone inherits
all mutations present in its parent clone. See Figure 5 for the topology of
the phylogenetic tree used in this experiment.

We prepared 10 samples, each containing a mixture of normal cells
and the above mentioned clones with normal contamination rates of 90%,
to 99% - with unit increments.

SiNVICT and VarScan2 also had perfect recall at 2,5% tumour content. In all the cases,
SiNVICT had better precision than MuTect, Freebayes, and VarScan2. However in tumour
content of 1% VarScan2 had better recall (1 more SNV detected by VarScan2). SiNVICT
made relatively less number of false positive calls resulting in its higher precision. Details
about the number of calls are provided in Supplementary Table 2.

For this experiment, we selected genomic regions from 5 distinct
chromosomes at approximately equal sizes whose total length was 31485
base pairs. We extracted these regions with BEDTools and used wgsim
to simulate ultra-deep sequencing with Illumina MiSeq. We kept the
parameters close to the experimentally observed ones (read length = 145,
insert size = 175). We obtained an average read depth of x 20000 in all
samples. We observed that the detection abilities of SiNVICT for such
a heterogeneous case was adequate for higher prevalence clones up to
97% normal mixed with 3% tumour. Beyond this level, the variant allele
percentage for all clones fell below the 0.6% level, which resulted in
decreased sensitivity. Note that Freebayes, MuTect, and VarScan2 did not
make any calls on this challenging dataset. We believe that this is caused
due to the rejection of the SNV sites by the triallelic site ﬁlter commonly
used by such tools. Because of the extremely high read depth we simulated
(giving rise to many reads with errors), as well as the highly clonal structure
of the samples, most of these SNV locations show evidence towards more
than one possible mutation. SiNVICT only considers the most frequent
non-reference base change and ignores the other lower frequency base
changes - a likely reason for SiNVICT to make correct calls in contrast
to the other tools. For instance, at a sample location with a read depth of
80,000 and a reference base A, one may observe 78,000 reads matching
the reference, 1500 reads suggesting an A to T change, and 500 reads
suggesting an A to C change. Our results are shown in Figure 4 and
Supplementary Table 4 in more detail.

3.2 AmpliSeq and Illumina 22RV1-490 Calibration data

In the above experiment, we assumed that the amount of DNA available
for our use is unlimited. Since chNA is usually obtained from blood, the
amount of DNA available for analysis in reality can be very low, which
will introduce sequencing challenges. In addition to the low amount of

Fig. 4. Precision and Recall of SiNVICT, MuTect, Freebayes, and VarScan2 on simulated
data consisting of 5 clones. To each clone, we added 5 SNVs and each subclone inherited
additional mutations from their parents as shown in Figure 5 and the number of bases
covered was 31485. Detection abilities of SiNVICT for such a heterogeneous case was
observed to be adequate for higher prevalence clones up to 97% normal mixed with 3%
tumour. Beyond this level, the variant allele percentage for all clones fell below 0.6%, which
resulted in a reduction of sensitivity. Freebayes, MuTect, and VarScan2 failed to provide
any calls for these simulated data sets. We believe this is caused due to the rejection of the
SNV sites by the triallelic site ﬁlter commonly used by such tools. Because of the extremely
high read depth we simulated, as well as the highly clonal structure of the samples, most
of these SNV locations show evidence towards more than one possible mutation. Detailed
information about call statistics are provided in Supplementary Table 4.

DNA, low tumour content can further complicate the analysis of chNA
data.

In this second experiment, we simulated such real life scenarios. We
used a mixture of two cell-lines, 22RV1 and 49C, to simulate normal and
tumour tissues respectively. While mixing these cell-lines, we generated
samples with varying amounts of DNA (10ng, 5ng, 2.5ng and 1ng for
AmpliSeq and 50ng, 25ng, 10ng, and 5ng for Illumina). For each amount,
we mixed the cell-lines in different proportions to simulate different
dilutions (5:1, 10:1, 20:1 and 50:1 for AmpliSeq and 10:1, 20:1 and 50:1
for Illumina). Finally, we generated 16 and 12 samples by IonTorrent
Proton and Illumina MiSeq respectively.

3.2.1 Experimental design for the cell-line data.

We used a mixture of prostate cancer cell lines 22RV1 and a LNCaP
derivative 49C (Al Nakouzi et al., 2013) containing different known
mutations as an experimental model. We used a 14 gene TSCA gene
panel designed using Illumina DesignStudio4. We targeted 70,929 bases in
total (175bp amplicon size). The targeted genes were APC, CDK12, AR,
SPOP, TP53, PTEN, BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2, MYC, FOXA1, MED12,
HSD3B1, ASXLl. Ampliseq panel targeted 19 genes (AR, TP53, BRCA1,
BRCA2, MED12, ASXL1, CTNNB1, OR5A1, PIK3CA, SCN11A,
CHDl, KDM6A, SPOP, HSDB3, PTEN, MLL, MYC, CHEK2, FOXA1),
had 104.67bp genome footprint and was designed using AmpliSeq
Designer5 applying FFPE parameters (amplicon target range 125-175bp).
The sequencing was performed at Vancouver Prostate Centre using MiSeq
(KAPA library quantiﬁcation kit, 25M 2x300bp read kit) and Ion Proton
(80M fragments, Ion PI sequencing reagents kit 200 v3, Ion PI chip
kit v3) sequencers according to manufacturer’s instructions. Each library
preparation run included negative (no DNA added) control, in all cases the
number of reads from the negative control was negligible (< 5, 000 reads,
compared with > 1, 000, 000 reads for target libraries).

3.2.2 AmpliSeq Calibration Data.

We evaluated the sensitivity of SiNVICT on these 16 samples by examining
three previously validated SNVs (H875Y, F877L and T878A) within the
AR gene (Azad et al. , 2015) that belongs to only one of the two cell-lines.
H875Y and T878A are homozygous SNVs while F877L is a heterozygous
SNV.

SiNVICT successfully detected all three mutations in all dilutions of
10ng, 5ng and 2.5ng. However it failed to detect the heterozygous F877L
mutation at 20:1 and 50:1 dilutions of 1ng which had observed allele
frequencies of 0.07% and 0.83%, respectively. The failed case at 50:1
dilution is likely due to the very low amount of DNA used and the "tumour"
cell-line being highly diluted at this amount.

In summary, SiNVICT was able to detect 46 of the 48 cases (sensitivity
of 95.8%). The lowest observed allele frequency for successful detection
of a mutation was 1.24% (F877L, 10ng, 50:1). SiNVICT failed to detect
2 cases that fell below 1% observed allele frequency (F 877L at 20:1-1ng
and F877L at 50:1-1ng). Freebayes only reported the H875Y in all 16
samples and failed to detect other mutations. Freebayes in total detected
16 out 48 (sensitivity of 33.3%) validated calls. VarScan2 failed to call
H875Y mutation in dilutions 5:1 and 10:1. Similar to SiNVICT, it failed
to call F877 at 20:1-1ng. Unlike SiNVICT, it reported F877L at 50:1-1ng
sample. VarScan2 in total reported 39 out of 48 (sensitivity of 81.25%)
validated calls. MuTect on this dataset reported 47 out of 48 (sensitivity of
97.92%) cases. MuTect was the only tool to report F877 at 50:1-1ng. See
Table 1 for details about the SNV calls and Supplementary Tables 5 and 6
for details about the read statistics.

3.2.3 Illumina Calibration Data.

We evaluated the sensitivity of SiNVICT on calibration dataset generated
through Illumina sequencing technology by examining the same validated
mutations. As depicted in Table 2, SiNVICT had the best performance
on this dataset by being able to detect 33 out of 36 (sensitivity of 91.6%)
cases while VarScan2 and Freebayes detected 25 (sensitivity of 69.4%)
and 13 (sensitivity of 36.1%) respectively. MuTect was able to detect 28
(sensitivity of 77.77%) out of 36 cases. The highest undetected mutation
had around 0.3% observed variant allele frequency. We have provided
more details about this experiment in Supplementary Tables 7 and 8.

Three previously validated SNVS on the AR gene for the mixture of the 22RV1-49C cell-lines (H875Y, F877L, and T87 8A) were used to
evaluate the sensitivity of SiNVICT in detection of SNVS in real data. Varying amounts of DNA (10ng, 5ng, 2.5ng and 1ng) were used to
prepare each of the samples. For each amount, we mixed the two cell-lines in different proportions to Simulate different dilutions (5:1, 10: 1,
20:1 and 50:1). Note that, expected allele frequency for F877L is half of that for T87 8A due to F877L being a heterozygous mutation.

3.3 Cell-Free DNA from castration-resistant prostate
cancer patients

We obtained two datasets part of a larger study (Wyatt et al., 2016)
to assess the feasibility of using SiNVICT on chNA from cancer
patients. One of these datasets consisted of chNA sequencing data
from castration-resistant prostate cancer patients sequenced with the
Ion Torrent (AmpliSeq) technology and the other dataset composed
of chNA sequencing data from metastatic castration-resistant prostate
cancer patients sequenced with Illumina MiSeq. The AmpliSeq panel
covered several genes whereas the Illumina panel was limited to the
AR gene. More details about the sequencing panels can be found at
http://www.ebi.ac .uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB 1 1659.

First, we performed a basic validation step to ensure that SiNVICT
can perform basic SNV calling in chNA using the AmpliSeq dataset
with several previously validated mutations by the study. We were able

to reproduce all these mutation calls with SiNVICT (see Supplementary
Table 9). Given the high VAF of these mutations and the depths of these
locations, the aim of this experiment was not to assess the sensitivity of
SiNVICT, but to make sure it passed a simple preliminary test for handling
chNA sequencing data.

We then selected 12 patients from the Illumina dataset belonging to
the same study (Wyatt et al., 2016) that were sequenced at all three time
points of interest - baseline, on-treatment (12-weeks), and progression -
and whose respective samples passed quality checks. These samples were
sequenced to obtain DNA from exons 2-8 of the AR gene. Candidate
locations suitable for time series analysis were selected based on the
methodology described in Section 2.4.

We then plotted the variant allele frequencies for these locations for a
patient at the three time points and observed a trend in which one time point

shows an increase in the VAF despite the other two time points showing
little evidence of a variant being present (see Supplementary Figure 1).

Based on this observation, we tried to assess whether the drug treatment
had eliminated some of the subclones while providing selective advantage
to some others that were already present in minuscule amounts before
treatment, through recalculating the p-values based on SiNVICT’s time
series data analysis feature. The recalculated p-values were signiﬁcantly
different than the original p-values (see Supplementary Table 10) implied
by the error rate for the (Illumina) sequencing technology, which might
be an indicator of a subclone being present at other time points in very
low amounts, making it difﬁcult to detect by standard (non-time—series)
analysis.

4 Conclusion

SiNVICT is a highly accurate and sensitive tool for detection of SNVs
and short indels in circulating tumour DNA at very low variant allele
percentages. Mutation detection with high read depth is often difﬁcult
due to sequencing errors getting ampliﬁed with the Amplicon technology
used in most deep sequencing platforms. SiNVICT is capable of ﬁltering
mutation calls by several parameters such as the minimum read depth,
strand bias, etc. We provide more details on the effect of ﬁlters on
the experiments performed in Section 3 in Supplementary Table 11.
SiNVICT is also highly customisable, allowing the user to ﬁne-tune several
parameters to achieve the desired level of sensitivity and speciﬁcity. Time-
series analysis capabilities of SiNVICT might be utilised to gain insight
to how certain drug treatments affect the overall clonal composition for a
patient.

Results obtained from experiments on simulated data suggest that at
variant allele percentages below 0.5%, even increasing the read depth
indeﬁnitely will not help with the calls unless the sequencing errors are
reduced. Results obtained from the cell-line experiments might allow us
to speculate that 2.5ng for AmpliSeq and 10ng for Illumina are the safest
amounts of DNA (among our calibration samples) from which a set of
reliable calls can be obtained at all dilutions mentioned before.

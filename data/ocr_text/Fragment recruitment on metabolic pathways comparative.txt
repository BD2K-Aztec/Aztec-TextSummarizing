ABSTRACT

Motivation: The sheer scale of the metagenomic and metatranscrip-
tomic datasets that are now available warrants the development of
automated protocols for organizing, annotating and comparing the
samples in terms of their metabolic profiles. We describe a
user-friendly java program FROMP (Fragment Recruitment on
Metabolic Pathways) for mapping and visualizing enzyme annotations
onto the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) meta-
bolic pathways or custom-made pathways and comparing the sam-
ples in terms of their Pathway Completeness Scores, their relative
Activity Scores or enzyme enrichment odds ratios. This program
along with our fully configurable PERL-based annotation organization
pipeline Meta2Pro (METAbolic PROfiling of META-omic data) offers a
quick and accurate standalone solution for metabolic profiling of en-
vironmental samples or cultures from different treatments. Apart from
pictorial comparisons, FROMP can also generate score matrices for
multiple meta-omics samples, which can be used directly by other
statistical programs.

Availability: The source code and documentation for FROMP can be
downloaded from https://sites.google.com/site/dhwanidesai/home/
software along with the Meta2Pro collection of PERL scripts.

1 INTRODUCTION

The rapidly accumulating environmental meta-omic (meta-
genomic and metatranscriptomic) projects resulting from high-
throughput sequencing techniques warrant the development of
new protocols that can provide a quick overview of the microbial
metabolic potential or activity. There has been some effort
towards management of such data (Sun et al., 2011), its taxo-
nomic and metabolic proﬁling (Arumugam et al., 2010; Huson
et al., 2007; Meyer et al., 2008; Yamada et al., 2011), Visualiza-
tion of metabolic pathways and statistical analyses of community

differences (Parks and Beiko, 2010). In most cases, the tools are
web-based and the primary method for annotation is BLAST
(Altschul et al., 1990). We describe here a standalone set of
tools to get a rapid and accurate overview of the metabolic func-
tions of the resident microbial community. The enzyme identiﬁ-
cation component of this pipeline, based on the ModEnzA
Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers (Desai et al., 2011) and
Pfam (Punta et al., 2012) proﬁle hidden Markov models
(HMMs), provides a quick and accurate EC number identiﬁca-
tion. The standout feature is the F ROMP (Fragment
Recruitment on Metabolic Pathways) pathway mapping and
comparative Visualization tool, which maps EC numbers
and Pfam annotations onto the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
and Genomes (KEGG) reference (Kanehisa et al., 2012) or
custom-made metabolic pathways. Multiple meta-omic samples
can be compared with each other based on a Pathway
Completeness Score modiﬁed from Inskeep et al. (2010), a
Pathway Activity Score or an odds ratio for enzyme enrichment
(Gill et al., 2006). The increased accuracy of HMM-based anno-
tation and an ability to compare multiple meta-omic samples at
once are attributes that improve on currently available metabolic
proﬁling tools such as Megan (Huson et al., 2007) and
MG—RAST (Meyer et al., 2008).

2 METHODS AND FEATURES

The java program F ROMP is a part of the Meta2Pro
(METAbolic PROﬁling of META-omic data) pipeline
(Supplementary Fig. 51). It maps the EC numbers
from ModEnzA directly onto the KEGG pathways or
user-deﬁned custom-made pathways. The Pfam hits are ﬁrst
mapped to the corresponding Gene Ontology IDs (Ashburner
et al., 2000) (using the conversion ﬁles pfam2go, kegg2go and
ec2go downloaded from http://www.geneontology.org/exter-
nal2go/), which are then mapped to KEGG reaction IDs or
EC numbers.

Pathway Completeness Score: We have modiﬁed the weighing
scheme for EC numbers described in (Inskeep et al., 2010) by
adding a term for the presence of continuous unbranched chains
of reactions.

For each EC 1', the weight

Wi = [(N(T, i)/N(U, i))/N(P, 1)] * x/L(UBC,r)

where Nay) is the total number of ECs in all pathways that have
EC i, Nah) is the number of unique ECs in all the pathways that
have EC i and Nazi) is the total number of pathways where EC i
is present and L(UBCJ) is the total edge-length of the unbranched
chain containing EC i in the reference pathway.

The pathway completeness score for a pathway p is then

C _ ZieECpWi *0 * L(UBc,s)

where W,- is the speciﬁcity weight of each EC i in pathway p, and
I,- is 1 if the EC number is detected in the sample and Lamas) is
the edge-length of the unbranched chain containing EC i in the
sample.

Odds ratio for gene enrichment: As described in Gill et al.
(2006), if A and C are the occurrence counts of a given EC in
sample i and all other comparison samples j, respectively, and B
and D are occurrence counts of all other ECs in sample i and
comparison samples j, respectively, then the odds ratio for the
given EC in sample i is (A/B)/(C/D).

Pathway Activity Score: This is simply the sum of counts for
the ECs in a given pathway multiplied by the EC weight.

Equalization of sequencing effort: To remove bias introduced
by differences in sequencing effort, the user can equalize unequal
sample sizes to the smallest sample by randomly selecting equal
numbers from the other samples.

Custom-designed pathways: In addition to the KEGG path-
ways, the users can design their own pathways in the Pathway
Designer. Chemical species and EC numbers can be placed on a
grid and linked with lines. The customized pathways can then be
added to any project in F ROMP.

Input: Apart from reading the output of the hmmscan program
(Eddy, 1998), F ROMP can also read in tab- or comma-separated
list of EC numbers and Pfam accession numbers (one column),
ECs and Pfams with counts (two column) and ECs and Pfams
with counts and sequence IDs (three column) of the meta-omic
sequences. It also accepts a matrix ﬁle of EC counts, with the
samples arranged in columns and the EC numbers in the rows.

Output: The comparative recruitment of various samples on
the reference pathways can be exported as PNG image ﬁles. The
various score matrices (including the EC count matrix) for the
samples and the sequence IDs of the fragments mapping onto
each EC or pathway can also be exported as text ﬁles.

 

3 COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF
METATRANSCRIPTOMES FROM THE OXYGEN
MINIMUM ZONE OFF PERU

Three metatranscriptomic samples from a depth proﬁle (oxic,
oxycline and anoxic), collected from one station in the
Peruvian oxygen minimum zone, were analysed with F ROMP
and mapped onto a custom-designed pathway that included bio-
logical reactions that are thought to be carried out in
oxygen-depleted environments (Supplementary Figs S2—S4).
The oxic sample metabolism was dominated by sequences
afﬁliated to oxic respiration (cytochrome-c oxidase, EC

1.9.3.1). It also had elevated levels of nitrite reduction transcripts
(EC 1.7.2.1), while sequences from the oxycline and the an-
oxic samples exclusively mapped onto nitrate reductases (EC
1.7.99.4). In the sulfur cycle, sequences similar to hydrogen sul-
ﬁte reductase (EC 1.8.99.3) mostly originated from the anoxic
depth, while the sulfate adenylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.4) was
most abundant in the oxic surface. These visual observations
are also supported by the odds ratio or enrichment factors cal-
culated for the ECs in these samples (Supplementary Fig. S5).

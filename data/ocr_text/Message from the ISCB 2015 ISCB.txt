Abstract

The International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB; http://wvaJscborg) honors a senior
scientist annually for his or her outstanding achievements with the ISCB Accomplishment by a
Senior Scientist Award. This award recognizes a leader in the field of computational biology for his
or her significant contributions to the community through research, service and education. Cyrus
Chothia, an emeritus scientist at the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology
and emeritus fellow of Wolfson College at Cambridge University, England, is the 2015 ISCB
Accomplishment by a Senior Scientist Award winner.

Chothia was selected by the Awards Committee, which is chaired by Dr Bonnie Berger of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He will receive his award and deliver a keynote presenta—
tion at 2015 Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology/European Conference on Computational

 

Biology in Dublin, Ireland, in July 2015.

Cyrus Chothia: the structures and functions
of proteins

Chothia was deeply interested in history as a young student in
England but was discouraged from pursuing this subject by teachers.
‘Because my foreign languages were so bad’, Chothia recalled,
‘my teachers said I couldn’t be an historian. I turned to chemistry’.
As a youth, Chothia remembers being fascinated by a hugely popu—
lar BBC television series by Nobel Laureate John Kendrew called
‘The Thread of Life’. He said, ‘I was enthralled by the series. I knew
what I wanted to do, I wanted to be a molecular biologist and go
Cambridge. I did it eventually in a roundabout way’.

Chothia completed his Bachelor of Science degree at Durham
University in 1964 and his Master of Science degree at Birkbeck
College, University of London, in 1967. He then pursued his PhD
under the guidance of Peter Pauling at University College London.
Chothia has fond memories of his time under Pauling’s supervision.
‘He was a generous supervisor and we got along extremely well’, he
said. His PhD research examined the conformations of molecules at
nerve receptors. This marked the beginning of his lifelong research
interest in protein structures.

After his PhD, Chothia went to the Laboratory of Molecular
Biology (LMB) for postdoctoral training, during which time he got

to know Joel Janin and Michael Levitt. His experience at LMB was
quite different from his time under Pauling, and he and his new
supervisor parted after 3 years. But this presented Chothia with an
opportunity to travel abroad to different laboratories. ‘[Levitt and
Janin] helped me find new places. Kendrew helped me get an EMBO
fellowship to come to America to Fred Richards’ lab at Yale.
America was marvelous scientifically. People were excited about
their work. I then went to the Weizmann Institute in Israel for six
months and then to Paris to Joel’s laboratory for two years. This
was my “Grand Tour” and it was actually very valuable. I went to
all these different labs and learned many things that I could use
when I got back to Cambridge’. This was a very fruitful period for
Chothia, and he published numerous articles with Levitt and Janin.
Chothia and Levitt developed the ‘all—a, all—b, a/b and a—I—b’ classifi—
cation of protein structures, and Chothia and Janin worked out the
underlying principles required for protein— protein recognition and
packing of protein secondary structures.

In 1976, Chothia came back to England and was affiliated with
the University College London and the LMB. He was named the
EPA. Cephalosporin Fund Senior Research Fellow of the Royal
Society in 1980, which offered him stable funding to work as an in-
dependent researcher for 10 years. Chothia recollected, ‘During that

time, I met Arthur Lesk and we got on enormously well. Lesk was
there for more than ten years. Working with him and others was
very productive’. Their work covered a wide range of topics in struc—
tural biology, including how protein structures change to adapt to
mutations, mechanisms by which proteins can transmit information
to distant sites in a structure and the observation that a small reper—
toire of structures exist for the main chain conformation of immuno-
globulin hypervariable regions, and these structures can be predicted
from the amino acid sequences. By 1990, Chothia recalled how his
laboratory work changed. ‘I was given a permanent position at
Cambridge and began to have students’, he said. ‘That made things
somewhat different and I liked working with them. Before this,
I worked with my contemporaries, and they would tell me when I
was talking nonsense. Joel Janin and I used to have fierce arguments.
When I started taking students the relationship became somewhat
different: it was important to explain the terms of the argument’.

In 1992, Chothia’s work on protein structures led him to
propose that most proteins comprised domains that come from
a limited number of families. Together with Tim Hubbard,

Alexei Murzin and Steven Brenner, he created the Structural
Classification of Proteins (SCOP) database. SCOP contains all
entries in the Protein Data Bank and provides a detailed and com—
prehensive description of the structural and evolutionary relation—
ships between all proteins whose structure is known (Hubbard
et 61]., 1997). More recently, Chothia developed the SUPERFAMILY
database with Julian Gough, which is a structural and functional an-
notation for all proteins and genomes (Cough and Chothia, 2002).
The SUPERFAMILY annotation is based on a collection of hidden
Markov models that represent structural protein domains at the
SCOP superfamily level. Superfamilies group together domains with
an evolutionary relationship.

Chothia is still active in the laboratory and is interested in ques—
tions related to biological complexity. His recent work has shown
that a significant increase in the number of superfamilies in eukary-
otes correlates with the complexity of organisms. But he is aware
that there are further questions to answer. He said, ‘The number of
proteins about which we have good information as to function is
small: we don’t know what most proteins do’. These questions are
sure to keep Chothia and other scientists in this field curious and
busy for years to come.

ABSTRACT

Summary: The regulation of protein activity is a key aspect of life at
the molecular level. Unveiling its details is thus crucial to understand-
ing signalling and metabolic pathways. The most common and power-
ful mechanism of protein-function regulation is allostery, which has
been increasingly calling the attention of medicinal chemists due to
its potential for the discovery of novel therapeutics. In this context,
PARS is a simple and fast method that queries protein dynamics and
structural conservation to identify pockets on a protein structure that
may exert a regulatory effect on the binding of a small-molecule
ligand.

Availability: PARS is freely available as a web server at http://bioinf.

1 INTRODUCTION

Tight regulation of protein function is fundamental to life.
Proteins involved in metabolic pathways, signalling cascades
and genomic transcription, among other processes within the
living cell, are commonly under allosteric regulation, i.e. their
activity is modiﬁed through the binding of a ligand molecule
to the protein in a site different from the active site. In fact,
allostery is one of the most powerful protein-function regulation
mechanisms, as it allows proteins to sense and immediately
respond to changes in their environment (Fenton, 2008).
Traditional drug-design approaches focusing on active or pri-
mary binding sites can be, therefore, extended by exploiting allo-
steric sites, as shown by current efforts on GPCRs (Melancon
et al., 2012) or farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (Jahnke et al.,
2010). An advantage of targeting allosteric sites therapeutically is
a reduced risk of secondary adverse effects. This is because allo-
steric sites appear to be signiﬁcantly less conserved than active
sites across homolog proteins WVaerroeck, 2003), enabling the
design of allosteric drugs with high speciﬁcity for a single protein
within a family. This observation has motivated the development
of allosteric drugs for the regulation of phosphodiesterase 4D,
for which active site inhibitors cause emesis, a dose-limiting side
effect (Burgin et al., 2010). Moreover, a drug-discovery approach

based on allosteric sites may result in the development of not
only novel drug-like inhibitors but activators as well (Peracchi
and Mozzarelli, 2011). Other concepts such as the notion of ser-
endipitous allosteric sites, which have no known ligand in nature
but can become functional in the presence of an ‘opportunistic’
ligand (Hardy and Wells, 2004) or the idea that almost any pro-
tein may be regulated allosterically (Gunasekaran et al., 2004),
contribute to the current interest in the pharmacological exploit-
ation of allosteric sites. In this context, it is expected that a
deeper understanding of the properties of allosteric sites and
their identiﬁcation would help streamlining the design and dis-
covery of novel therapeutic drugs (Nussinov and Tsai, 2013).

Despite growing efforts, the atomic-level details that explain
the functional relationship between distant sites in the same pro-
tein molecule have not been elucidated for most of the known
cases of allostery (Peracchi and Mozzarelli, 2011). This has moti-
vated a growth in the number of computational studies on pro-
tein allosteric sites, including the recent publication of three web
servers: SPACER (Goncearenco et al., 2013) and MCPath (Kaya
et al., 2013), which study the allosteric communication across
residues in a protein structure, and Allosite (Huang et al.,
2013), which predicts allosteric sites on protein structures using
a machine-learning approach. Here, we present PARS, which
queries protein ﬂexibility and structural conservation to predict
the location of allosteric sites. The implementation emphasizes
ease-of—use and speed, whereas maintaining high accuracy as
benchmarked against a large set of known allosteric proteins.
Even though our method (as the servers mentioned earlier in
the text) requires a protein structure to work, we have added
an initial homology modelling step that allows the user to run
predictions starting from protein sequence in cases where a
known structure is not available.

2 DESCRIPTION

The current perspective on allosteric transitions and associated
regulatory events relies on the ‘population shift’ concept (Cui
and Karplus, 2008). Brieﬂy, the protein or protein complex ex-
plores different conformations (both active and inactive) in so-
lution, and the allosteric ligand ‘shifts’ the population or
ensemble of conformations on binding, effectively modulating
the protein’s activity rate (Kar et al., 2010). The conformational
space explored by the protein can be sampled using computa-
tional methods such as molecular dynamics (Chiappori et al.,
2012) or normal mode analysis (NMA) (Dykeman and
Twarock, 2010). In our approach, protein dynamics are queried

through NMA, allowing fast large-scale (potentially genome-
wide) analyses. The method developed previously (Panjkovich
and Daura, 2012) is now implemented as a web server working
as follows: (i) initially, the user uploads a protein-structure ﬁle
(PDB format) and selects which chains and ligands should be
considered for the calculations. Alternatively, the user may
submit a protein sequence and the server will attempt to generate
a structural model by homology to known structural templates
(Eswar et al., 2008). (ii) Once the job is submitted, the LIGSITE‘S
program (Huang and Schroeder, 2006) is used to predict putative
ligand-binding sites, where a simpliﬁed representation of a small
molecule (i.e. a set of dummy atoms forming an octahedron) will
be placed to simulate the presence of a ligand. (iii) NMA is
carried out for the apo (unbound) structure. (iv) For each po-
tential ligand-binding site, an NMA is executed for the protein—
ligand complex using a simpliﬁed ligand representation; if a
cocrystallized ligand is selected, the calculation will be performed
for the corresponding binding site. (v) If a signiﬁcant difference is
found between the NMA-derived B-factors of the apo and
ligand-bound states of the protein (Wilcoxon—Mann—Whitney’s
P 5 0.05), the binding site is marked as potentially allosteric.

Complementarily, if enough structural data are available for
the protein family, the structural conservation of each pocket is
also measured. We have previously shown that allosteric sites
tend to be structurally conserved within a protein family
(Panjkovich and Daura, 2010) and that the incorporation of
this measure improves the capacity of the method based on dy-
namics to correctly identify allosteric sites (Panjkovich and
Daura, 2012). Immediately after submission the user is provided
with a link where results can be accessed once the calculation has
ﬁnished. Optionally, the user can choose to be notiﬁed by email
when results are available.

A standard run on a 500-residue protein will take ~3 min.
Even though calculation times increase exponentially with the
number of residues, larger systems can be processed within rea-
sonable time (e. g. 1000 residues% 12 min). The results are de-
livered as a ranking and, if the browser allows it, the binding sites
can be explored online on the 3D protein structure by means of
the Jmol package (http://www.jmol.org/). To complement the
analysis, active site residues are predicted and reported on the
structure using a previously described methodology (Mistry
et al., 2007). Binding sites and ligands are color coded according
to given thresholds for the level of structural conservation
(2 50%) and the predicted effect on protein dynamics
(P5 0.05). The protein structure ﬁle including the position of
identiﬁed sites, a visualization script and a table with calculated
values can be downloaded as well for further processing. Normal
modes and derived B-factors can be explored in detail using spe-
ciﬁcally designed interfaces that are available at the results web
page. A more detailed description of the server and its param-
eters is provided as Supplementary Material and available as
online documentation on the website.

Predicting allosteric sites computationally is not trivial, and to
illustrate the success rate that the user can expect, we have bench-
marked PARS using 102 allosteric proteins. Brieﬂy, the results
show that if we consider all predicted cavities matching an allo-
steric site in the benchmark set, 44% appear in the ﬁrst position

and 18% on the second position of the PARS ranking, whereas a
total of 73% are found in the top three positions. Full bench-
mark details and performance statistics are available as
Supplementary Material.

We expect that this easy-to-use and relatively fast web server
will prove useful for medicinal chemists and other researchers
studying the regulation of protein function for biochemical char-
acterization and other applied tasks such as binding-site priori-
tization for virtual drug screening.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Identifying altered pathways in an individual is important
for understanding disease mechanisms and for the future application
of custom therapeutic decisions. Existing pathway analysis techniques
are mainly focused on discovering altered pathways between normal
and cancer groups and are not suitable for identifying the pathway
aberrance that may occur in an individual sample. A simple way to
identify individual’s pathway aberrance is to compare normal and
tumor data from the same individual. However, the matched normal
data from the same individual are often unavailable in clinical situation.
Therefore, we suggest a new approach for the personalized identifi-
cation of altered pathways, making special use of accumulated normal
data in cases when a patient’s matched normal data are unavailable.
The philosophy behind our method is to quantify the aberrance of an
individual sample’s pathway by comparing it with accumulated normal
samples. We propose and examine personalized extensions of path-
way statistics, overrepresentation analysis and functional class scor-
ing, to generate individualized pathway aberrance score.

Results: Collected microarray data of normal tissue of lung and colon
mucosa are served as reference to investigate a number of cancer in-
dividuals of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and colon cancer,
respectively. Our method concurrently captures known facts of
cancer survival pathways and identifies the pathway aberrances that
represent cancer differentiation status and survival. It also provides
more improved validation rate of survival-related pathways than when
a single cancer sample is interpreted in the context of cancer-only
cohort. In addition, our method is useful in classifying unknown samples
into cancer or normal groups. Particularly, we identified ‘amino acid
synthesis and interconversion’ pathway is a good indicator of LUAD
(Area Under the Curve (AUC) 0.982 at independent validation). Clinical
importance of the method is providing pathway interpretation of single
cancer, even though its matched normal data are unavailable.
Availability and implementation: The method was implemented

1 INTRODUCTION

Cancer arises from normal cells and can evolve to become ma-
lignant, metastatic and/or resistant to therapy. The analysis of
altered pathways in an individual cancer patient may help to
understand the disease status and suggest customized anticancer
therapies.

It is straightforward to compare the molecular proﬁle of an
individual’s tumor and normal cells to discover molecular aber-
rances speciﬁc to his/her cancer. However, it may not be feasible
in the current clinical practice environment to perform a meta-
static tumor biopsy at the time of treatment resistance in patients
with advanced cancer (Dancey et al., 2012). A case study of
custom-tailored medicine based on an individual’s genome and
transcriptome highlights this limitation (Jones et al., 2010).
A patient’s tumor had metastasized to the lung after surgery at
the primary site. A biopsy from his lung tumor was analyzed by
mutation and transcription proﬁling; however, the patient’s
normal lung tissue was not biopsied. Because there was no
matched normal tissue, messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in
the patient’s own blood and information collected from various
normal tissues were used to identify differentially expressed genes
(DEGs). The results of pathway analysis based on DEGs, inte-
grated copy number variation and mutation information led the
doctor to change the patient’s drug treatment, and the disease
was stabilized for 3 months.

Although the personalized interpretation of pathways can be
demanding, most current pathway analyses have been developed
to investigate deregulated pathways between two phenotype
groups. Khatri et a]. (2012) classiﬁed these methods into three
types: overrepresentation analysis (ORA), functional class scor-
ing (FCS) and a pathway topology (PT)-based approach.

ORA approaches typically apply an arbitrary threshold value
(e.g., fold change >2 or P<0.05) on gene expression to assess
whether the number of genes beyond threshold are signiﬁcantly
over- or underrepresented in the given pathway. There are two
drawbacks to ORA. First, it uses only the most signiﬁcant genes
and discards others, thus resulting in information loss for mar-
ginally signiﬁcant genes (Breitling et al., 2004). Second, it con-
siders only the number of genes and does not consider the
magnitude of expression changes, leading to information loss
regarding the importance of genes (e.g. a gene with a fold
change of 2.01 and a gene with a fold change of 4 are considered
equally). Unlike ORA, FCS methods do not discard genes with
an arbitrary threshold but use all available genes, which is an
improvement over ORA (Tian et al., 2005). PT methods are
essentially based on FCS methods with the addition that they
consider network topology information. They compensate for
the common limitation of ORA and FCS in reporting
false-positive gene sets due to sets of overlapping genes. In our
article, we focus on ORA and FCS methods, extending and
implementing each for personalized pathway analysis.

There are two exceptional studies examining individualized
pathway analysis (Drier et al., 2013; Vaske et al., 2010).

Use of accumulated normal tissue data

 

PARADIGM is a tool that infers a pathway status by using
known functional structures. The method models the functional
structure of pathway as a set of interconnected variables, where
the variables are omic objects such as DNA, mRNA and protein,
where the interaction between variables describes the functional
status of a pathway. PARADIGM may perform better with
multiple omics, as it uses known functional relationships between
a gene or inter-gene DNA and protein. Hence, it might not per-
form well with single layer omic data, such as from mRNA
microarrays.

Drier et al. (2013) proposed a personal pathway deregulation
score (PDS), which represents the distance of a single cancer
sample from the median of normal samples on the principal
curve. To calculate PDS, they reduced the dimensions by princi-
pal component analysis and found the best principal curve, using
entire cohort samples containing both normal and/or different
stages of cancers. Drier’s method performs better than
PARADIGM in the mRNA only datasets of brain and colon
cancers. Calculating PDS requires data dependent preprocessing
steps, including selecting the number of principal components to
be used and ﬁltering out noisy gene data to obtain optimized
principal curves. PDS fully uses whole cohort data to interpret an
individual’s pathway, which can be a drawback in that it requires
a number of cohort data to extract principal curve to interpret a
single patient data. It has a limitation to interpret a single sample
such as a patient’s recurrent tumor that is not accompanied with
cohort dataset to extract the principal curve.

Our proposed method is based on the comparison of one
cancer sample with many accumulated normal samples (we use
‘nRef to refer to the accumulated normal samples) that is dif-
ferent from the previous studies in following sense. The proposed
method is suitable to adopt single-layer omics data and expend-
able to interpret a patient in the context of many published or
user-deﬁned pathway gene sets. PARADIGM has less freedom
in terms of data and gene sets, as it prefers multi-layered omics
data and requires predeﬁned functional structure among omics
objects. Unlike PDS, which extracts the principal curve from
entire cohort data, our method does not assume an individual
sample belongs to a cohort. We introduce using accumulated
normal tissue data as a reference. This is a simple and biologic-
ally intuitive guideline in such a case to interpret a single sample
that lack cohort data.

Our method provides a series of analysis steps, which consists
of four parts: data processing, gene-level statistics, individualized
pathway aberrance score (iPAS) and a signiﬁcance test. To dis-
cover the most feasible method for iPAS, we extend existing
pathway analysis techniques, namely, ORA and FCS, to prop-
erly reﬂect the nature of testing one cancer to many normal
samples.

To demonstrate that iPAS captures biologically and clinically
relevant information in a sensible, valid and useful manner, we
apply it to samples of lung and colon adenocarcinoma. We show
that our representation generates clinically relevant stratiﬁca-
tions and outcome predictors, which would not have been
achieved when the same data are analyzed by the conventional
method that does not use accumulated normal data.

Our empirical study suggests two different strategies, depending
on the biological question that iPAS is focused on. In the case of
cancer diagnosis, a method that uses the inter-gene correlation

structure of the accumulated normal samples performs best.
In the case of cancer prognosis, a simple averaging of all
member genes’ standardized gene expression values performs best.

2 METHODS AND MATERIALS

2.1 Gene expression data

We built nRef by the manual curation of data obtained from NCBI GEO
(Barrett et al., 2012). Microarray data of adjacent normal tissues obtained
from patients undergoing surgery were selected to serve as the nRef. Data
from biopsied samples, primary cultures of normal tissues and post-
mortem donors were not included in the nRef. We collected 120 nRef
for lung, 60 from GSE19804 (Lu et al., 2011), 27 from GSE7670 (Su
ct al., 2007) and 33 from GSE10072 (Landi ct al., 2008). Samples came
from individuals with variable smoking histories and different ethnic
backgrounds. We collected 101 nRef” for colon, concentrating on
normal mucosa tissue samples from six datasets available at GEO. To
evaluate the effectiveness of our method in survival analysis, we used
Beer’s data of 442 lung adenocarcinomas (LUADs) (Beer ct al., 2002)
to discover survival-related pathways and validated the associations of 61
LUAD samples of GSE8894 (Lee ct al., 2008). The pathway based iden-
tiﬁcation of LUAD were tested on 120 cancers and 120 normal samples
of GSE19804, GSE7670 and GSE10071. Further validation was con-
ducted with 48 cancers and 35 normal samples collected from
GSE19188 (Hou ct al., 2010) and GSE31547. For patient stratiﬁcation
by colon cancer differentiation status, we used 566 microarrays of
GSE39582 (Marisa ct al., 2013), which provided in a separate manner,
443 for discovery, 123 for validation. GSE17536 (Smith ct al., 2010) was
also used for validation.

2.2 Pathway data

Information from gene sets representing biological pathways were ob-
tained from REACTOME (Croft ct al., 2011), which are also provided
in the Molecular Signature Database (Subramanian ct al., 2005).
Pathways with small number of genes are more easily understood by
human experts. We decided to ﬁlter out pathways of which gene set
size is >97. The cutoff covers at least 80% of contents of each public
pathway resources. Of 674 pathways in REACTOME, 583 pathways
(86.7%) remained after ﬁltering by the gene set size.

2.3 Individualized analysis using the nRef

The aim of our approach is to identify altered pathways in an individual
by making use of the nRef. A schematic diagram of our method of
individualized pathway analysis is described in Figure 1, and the follow-
ing sections describe each step.

2.3.] Data preprocessing and gene-level statistics Expression level
was deﬁned by using the robust multichip average (Irizarry ct al., 2003).
For datasets using different microarrays, only those with probes in
common from Affymetrix U133A to Affymetrix U133P1us 2.0 were
used for further analysis. For individual tumor cases, we performed quan-
tile normalization (Bolstad ct al., 2003) after combining the single tumor
microarray with all nRef samples. In cases of genes with multiple probes,
gene expression level was summarized by averaging probe-level expres-
sion. Individual tumor sample gene expression was standardized using the
mean and standard deviation of the reference.

2.3.2 Pathway-level statistics and significance test We introduce
ﬁve methods as candidates for iPAS. Each method is a modiﬁcation of
existing pathway analysis techniques, enabling us to test an individual
tumor sample’s pathway aberrance by using the nRef. A summary is
provided in Table 1.

Note. Significance can be obtained against the null distribution generated from
normal samples. All the collected normal samples for the nRef are one by one
compared with the nRef to yield statistics of the null distribution. A statistic from
a single cancer case is compared with this null distribution to yield P—value.

Average Z Standardizing the gene expression by mean and standard
deviation from datasets is often used in microarray analysis. A vector
Z = (21, 22, . . . , Zn) denotes the expression status of a pathway where
z, symbolizes the standardized expression value of i—th gene, where
the number of genes belonging to the pathway is n. In typical settings,
standardization is performed using the mean and SD of a given dataset,

mostly the cancer-only cohort data, thus y/n indicates how much the
given sample’s overall pathway gene expression deviates from the
center of the cancer samples. We made the simple modiﬁcation,
Z’ = (21’, 223..., Zn), where 2,, is derived from mean and SD of the
nRef. In this case, y/n gives the samples deviation from the nRef.
We believe this modiﬁcation is biologically valid because every cancer
starts its malignancy from normal cell. Thus, the clinical characteristics of
a single cancer can be captured by measuring the difference of it against
common characteristic of normal cells, which is represented by the nRef
in our study.

Fisher exact test We generated a 2 X 2 contingency table for a given
pathway (S) and DEGs (D) for the test. For individualized interpretation,
we deﬁne D by the ranking of z—value, which is standardized gene expres-
sion for the mean and SD of the nRef. For each individual sample, 5%
(highest 2.5% and lowest 2.5 %) of the total genes are deﬁned as D. We
applied a two-tailed test to detect alteration of pathways due to enrich-
ment or depletion of differential genes. The result of this statistic can be
interpreted as how many DEGs are enriched in the given pathway, where
the expression difference refers to how much a patient’s gene expression
deviates from the nRef.

Gene set enrichment analysis We adopted the original version of
gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) proposed by Subramanian et al.
(2005). Typically, inputs for GSEA are generated by testing whole cohort
samples using phenotype label; t-statistic, correlation coefﬁcients and fold
changes are usually used. In the personalized analysis setting, we use the
z-value as an input for the GSEA algorithm, which is standardized gene
expression by mean and SD of the nRef. The GSEA output enrichment
score reﬂects the degree to which a gene set in the pathway is overrepre-
sented at the extremes (low or high) of the entire ranked list of z-values
from a single patient.

Non-parametric quadratic test Gene expression in a pathway of a
tumor sample is represented by vector Z = (21, 22, . . . , Zn), where z, is
standardized expression level of i—th gene by mean and SD of the nRef,
where n is the number of genes belonged to the pathway. A pathway
characteristic of an individual patient’s pathway can be represented by
the averaged Euclidean distance (ZTZ/n). This gives the distance of a
single patient from the center of the nRef due to the square of standar-
dized expression difference, and thus does not reﬂect increased or
decreased expression, only the extent of the expression difference.

Use of accumulated normal tissue data

 

Genes in the pathway are usually functionally correlated; therefore, use of
the correlation structure of the normal samples may increase sensitivity
enough to capture the aberrance of a single cancer case. We also consider
the averaged Mahalanobis (Z TSZ / n) distance, which uses the covariance
matrix calculated from the nRef. This value describes the statistical dis-
tance from the center of normal samples taking into account correlation
among normal samples. The covariance matrix S is calculated for each
pathway from the nRef.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Pathway-based identiﬁcation and validation of cancer
survival

To assess whether our method can sensitively detect pathway
aberrances that are associated with a patient’s clinical outcome,
a known survival pathway that showed strong association with
patient survival from Beer’s data was tested. Bryant et al. (2010)
reported that the ‘cell cycle stimulatory’ pathway of 51 genes is
signiﬁcantly associated with patient survival (Cox proportional
hazards model, P = 0.000113). In that study, pathway gene
expression was represented as an average of z-values, where the
z-value indicates the standardized expression level, by the mean
and SD, of all cancer samples. The high-risk group was deﬁned
as those in which pathway expressions were >0, and the pathway
showed poor prognostic outcome. The association was signiﬁ-
cant with or without adjusted clinical covariates, and thus the
pathway alone is a strong indicator of cancer prognosis. This
ﬁnding was also validated in the Japanese LUAD cohort
(n = 87, survival data are not provided to public) in Bryant’s
study. As studies have shown a clear association between the
cell cycle pathway and cancer, in terms of driving cancer prolif-
eration, we considered this pathway as a pathway that should be
detected. All of the methods proposed as candidates for iPAS
showed signiﬁcant associations of the ‘cell cycle stimulatory’
pathway from Beer’s data (Table 2). The same pathway analyzed
using GSE8894 (n = 61) data yielded signiﬁcant associations in

Table 2. Survival analysis of ‘cell cycle stimulatory’ pathway reported by

all proposed methods with the marginal exception of
Mahalanobis (P = 0.0549).

Prognostic gene expression signatures for Stages II and III
colon cancers have been reported in seven papers, yielding 207
genes in total (Bandres et al., 2007; Barrier et al., 2006, 2007;
Eschrich et al., 2005; Kopetz and Abbruzzese, 2009; Lin et al.,
2007; Wang et al., 2004). The genes are enriched in 32
REACTOME pathways (False Discovery Rate (FDR)<0.05,
pathway size<96). We assumed the 32 pathways were valid as
ground truth to be identiﬁed and analyzed in the colon cancer
dataset GSE39585 (Stages II and III were only considered).
Average Z provided best performer (sensitivity = 0.88) with 28
pathways deemed as signiﬁcant. GSEA, Fisher, Euclidean and
Mahalanobis gave the following values, 0.78, 0.66, 0.06 and 0.03,
respectively.

These results satisﬁed us that our approach captures the fun-
damental knowledge of cancer, thus it is reasonably considered
as iPAS.

To investigate which of the candidates for iPAS most robustly
reﬂect phenotype association, we evaluated the proposed meth-
ods by determining whether survival-associated pathways are
validated in datasets never used for discovery using LUAD
and colon cancer [LUAD: Beer’s set n = 442 for discovery,
GSE8894 (n = 61) GSE3141 (n = 58) for validation; colon
cancer: GSE39582d (n = 443) for discovery, GSE39582v
(n = 123) and GSE17536 (n = 109) for validation, logrank
P<0.05, comparing tumors in the top 50th percentile of aber-
rance scores to those in the bottom 50th percentile]. Validation
rates varied depending on the dataset, and these were possibly
affected by the small sample size compared with that of the
discovery set. In these cases, we were not able to determine a
superior method that outperformed the others. Average Z gave
the highest validation rate in three of four dataset with validation
rates of GSE8894 (43.6%, 92/211), GSE3141 (13.3%, 28/211)
and GSE17536 (10.7%, 24/224). When validation rates from
four datasets are averaged, Average Z gave the highest validation
rate, (21.9%, Fig. 2, blue bars). Pathways validated as signiﬁ-
cantly associated with patient survival for each cancer are listed

in the Supplementary Materials (Supplementary Tables S1
and S2).

We also investigated the validation rate of iPAS candidates
under the conditions where the same data are not standardized
by the nRef but instead standardized by the mean and SD of
the cohort dataset, which consists of only cancers (Fig. 2, red
bars). It is noteworthy that use of the nRef increased the valid-
ation rate for every iPAS candidate investigated. This implies
that the strategy of using accumulated normal samples as a
reference is beneﬁcial in terms of pathway-based survival
analysis.

3.2 Identiﬁcation of clinical importance

Cluster analysis of using Average Z as the iPAS method on
Beer’s data identiﬁed 12 pathway clusters (denoted by 1~12
in Fig. 3) and 3 sample clusters (S2~S4; S1 is from the nRef;
Fig. 3). Sample clusters S2 and S4 represent well the differen-
tiation status of LUAD (Fisher exact test, P<4.65 x 10’15).
Well-differentiated adenocarcinoma resembles the normal glan-
dular structure; therefore, it is a reasonable result that cluster S2
is close to the nRef. The survival outcome of S2 and S4 are
signiﬁcantly different (P<0.0028), and this assures us that un-
biased clustering-based iPAS has enough sensitivity to capture
clinically important associations. This ﬁnding is concordant with
prior knowledge that well-differentiated LUAD patients are
likely to have better prognosis (Barletta et al., 2010). Pathway
cluster P9 is distinguished as commonly upregulated in tumor
samples. The pathways are transfer RNA aminoacylation, amino
acid or purine synthesis, DNA elongation and the extension of
telomeres.

Unbiased pathway-based clustering of colon cancer data also
captures clinically important associations by revealing sample
clusters that are survival related (S2 and S3, P = 0.0037,
Supplementary Fig. S1). It is important to note that iPAS is
not only sensitive enough to identify clinically meaningful sub-
structure of patients but also reveals common characteristics of a

 

   

cancer at the same time. For example, pathways commonly up-
or downregulated in all cancer samples, for example, P9 or P2,
would have not been discovered if the analysis had been per-
formed by a conventional approach that does not make use of
‘nRef’ (Supplementary Fig. S2).

3.3 Pathway-based identiﬁcation of cancer

Cancer develops unique mechanisms for malignancy. Therefore,
it is reasonable to believe that identifying the unique molecular
aberrances of cancer will aid in cancer diagnosis. Our empirical
study of iPAS-based clustering of LUAD revealed several
pathways commonly up- or downregulated in all of the cancer
samples. Further analysis was performed to determine whether
iPAS could be successfully used in the accurate identiﬁcation of
cancer. We tested this in a simple unsupervised way by judging
whether an unknown sample is signiﬁcantly different against the
nRef, as a tumor, if not as normal. We performed a 5-fold cross-
validation one hundred times with the LUAD dataset, which
consisted of 120 cancers and 120 normal samples. Microarray
data from the normal samples was randomly divided into ﬁve
groups, and four of the ﬁve served as the reference group. The
remaining group was used as the true normal set for the test of
pathway-based identiﬁcation of cancer. To build true cancer set
for the test, the same number of cancer sample was randomly
picked. We considered 583 pathways in REACTOME, giving
293 500 (583 pathways x 5-fold x 100 repeats) AUCs and accur-
acy values. We averaged AUCs and accuracies from the ﬁve
candidate methods for iPAS and used this as a representative
AUC and accuracy of a given pathway.

By ranking the pathways by AUC, top pathways that marked
averagely high performance by all iPAS candidates are listed
(Supplementary Table S3). The ‘amino acid synthesis and in-
terconversion and transamination’ pathway showed the highest
classiﬁcation performance. Unsurprisingly, this pathway was one
of the commonly upregulated pathways in the analysis of the
Beer’s data (Fig. 3, pathway cluster P9). Among the tested

Fig. 5. Performance of pathway-based identiﬁcation of cancer (AUC)
when only a subset of normal samples are served as nRef. (a) ‘amino
acid synthesis and interconversion and transamination’ (b) ‘unwind of
DNA’

iPAS candidates for this pathway, Mahalanobis yielded the high-
est AUC (0.980), while Average Z gave 0.936, and Fisher’s exact
test gave the lowest value (0.914). The standardized gene expres-
sion pattern for this pathway differed between tumor and
normal. Many of the genes deviated from mean of the nRef,
by more than two orders of sigma, contributing to its best per-
formance out of all iPAS candidate methods, including ORA
method like Fisher’s exact test (Fig. 4a).

We also analyzed the inﬂuence of using the subset of normal
samples as nRef. We compared the pathway-based cancer iden-
tiﬁcation results using the full set of normal samples (n = 120)
against 100 different runs using 75% (n = 90), 50% (n = 60) of
randomly chosen normal samples. Among the pathways that
marked averagely high performance in the identiﬁcation of

cancer, the best and the second best pathways are considered,
‘amino acid synthesis and interconversion and transamination’
and ‘unwind of DNA’, respectively. The result shows little less of
performance, even though only a half of normal samples were
used for the test (Fig. 5a and b).

3.4 Validation of the discovered pathway

The ‘amino acid synthesis and interconversion and transamin-
ation’ pathway consists of 17 genes involved in three major
reactions, as it is described at REACTOME. The pathways are
responsible for (i) synthesis of three amino acids (aspartate,
asparagine, glutamate), (ii) the synthesis of glucose under fasting
conditions by using carbon atoms from these four amino acids
and (iii) conversion of amino acids to their corresponding alpha-
keto acids, coupled to their conversion to glutamate, which is the
ﬁrst step in the catabolism of most amino acids.

This function makes sense in terms of the ‘glutamine addic-
tion’ of cancer cells. The nutrients glucose and glutamine are
speciﬁcally required by cancer cells as metabolites for growth
and for production of adenosine triphosphate (Munoz-Pinedo
et al., 2012). Myc and p53 have been revealed to be associated
with this ‘addiction’ by upregulating glutamine synthesis in
cancer cells. Thus, our ﬁnding is in accordance with prior know-
ledge regarding the upregulation of glutamine synthetase.

We further validated our ﬁndings with an independent set that
were not used in the discovery set. We collected two more LUAD
gene expression datasets with normal data at GEO (GSE19188,
GSE31547). Aggregated datasets of 48 microarrays from tumor
tissues and 35 microarrays from normal tissues were used for
independent validation. The pathway was also altered in a can-
cer-speciﬁc way in a validation set yielding an AUC of 0.982 by
Mahalanobis-based iPAS (Fig. 4b, Validation 1). We also as-
sessed the same validation set in a different manner by using
the nRef from the discovery set. Normal sample microarrays
from the discovery sets (GSE10082, GSE7670, GSE10072)

T.Ahn et al.

 

served as the nRef to classify samples in the independent valid-
ation set. The resulting AUC was 0.982 by the Mahalanobis
method (Fig. 4b, Validation 2).

In our experiments using LUAD samples, the Mahalanobis
distance, which used a pre-calculated covariance matrix from
the ‘nRef,’ gave the best performance. The usage of covariance
matrix empowers Mahalanobis to consider a cancer sample as an
outlier, delivering higher accuracy in terms of pathway-based
identiﬁcation of cancer than other methods. One caution of
using Mahalanobis method is that it requires a large number
of normal samples to guarantee the estimation of covariance
matrix. For a small sample size, a structured covariance matrix
would be desirable to avoid the estimation issue.

The biological role of this identiﬁed pathway is to supply nu-
trients and energy to cancer cells. This may be the reason why
this pathway is universally aberrant in all the LUAD samples we
assessed. Our analysis of this pathway in other cancer types
demonstrated less of a role for this pathway, suggesting that it
is more LUAD speciﬁc. We believe that the common disruption
of this pathway is a novel discovery, as this pathway, consisting
of 17 genes, has not been reported as an indicator of LUAD in
any of the studies we acquired datasets from (GSE10082,
GSE7670, GSE10072), nor in a literature search with key words.

4 CONCLUSIONS

We have proposed personalized extensions to ORA- and FCS-
based pathway analysis by introducing the concept of comparing
an individual tumor with many normal samples. Exploratory
analyses of our methods with previously published survival path-
way signatures reproduced the correct survival outcomes. We
have also demonstrated that using nRef improves the validation
rate. Unbiased clustering with iPASs revealed sample clustering,
which is indicative of the cancer differentiation status of LUAD
and of different survival outcomes. Clustering also identiﬁes
pathway characteristics from patients displaying common up-
or downregulations and subgroup-speciﬁc deregulations.

Pathways that are commonly deregulated across all cancer
patients may be useful in identifying cancer from unknown
samples. We explored the pathway-based identiﬁcation of
cancer with ‘amino acid synthesis and interconversion and trans-
amination’ pathway, which is commonly upregulated in LUAD
patients. Validation using independent datasets demonstrated
that this pathway is useful in classifying LUAD and normal
lung samples.

Based on our results, we conclude that individualized pathway
scores using nRef can provide a sensitive measure of a patient’s
clinical features and can be useful for identifying cancer.

In our empirical study, Average Z performed best in highlight-
ing pathway aberrance and in further revealing clinical import-
ance. It had the best statistical power when identifying a
previously known survival-related pathway and the best aver-
aged validation rate for LUAD and colon cancer. In the path-
way-based identiﬁcation of cancer, the Mahalanobis method
performed best.

An important clinical aspect of our methods is that it enables
the interpretation of a cancer case in a single patient, even if
matched normal tissue data from the same individual are
unavailable. Accumulated information of normal tissues from

a data repository will take the place of data unavailable for a
speciﬁc individual. As the data repository is growing rapidly, it is
expected that more ‘nRef’ data will be available for many
diseases in the near future. We hope that our proposed approach
can help in the personalized interpretation of tumor data and can
be a useful tool in the upcoming era of data-based personalized
medicine.

Although we have shown our results in microarray platform,
our method is applicable to different RNA expression platforms
including next-generation sequencer. Our method is also sup-
portive of various pathway resources such as KEGG, NCI
cancer pathway and Biocarta provided in the gmt format. The
R code for our methods, along with nRefs of LUAD and colon
cancer used in our study, is available at http://bibs.snu.ac.kr/ipas.

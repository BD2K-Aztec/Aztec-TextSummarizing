Abstract

Summary: Understanding the biology of ageing is an important and complex challenge. Survival
experiments are one of the primary approaches for measuring changes in ageing. Here, we pre-
sent a major update to Suerurv, a database and online resource for survival data in animals.
As well as a substantial increase in data and additions to existing graphical and statistical
survival analysis features, Suerurv now includes extended mathematical mortality modelling
functions and survival density plots for more advanced representation of groups of survival

cohorts.

1 Introduction

The biological phenomenon of ageing has been a long standing area
of research (Grignolio and Franceschi, 2012). Despite identification
of many gene knock-outs, drug administration and environmental
regimes that can extend lifespan of model organisms under labora-
tory conditions, many questions remain unresolved (Guarente et al.,
2008). A key experimental approach in research on ageing is to use
longevity survival experiments, which usually characterize differ-
ences with respect to ageing between populations when other causes
of death, such as predators, food competition and pathogens, are
excluded. Until recently, numerical data from animal survival ex-
periments were usually not shared, and the data were analysed only
in the original study, hampering method development, re-analysis of
existing data by new methods, meta-analyses combining data and
systems biology approaches.

We have created the Suerurv database and online analysis plat-
form for animal survival data (Ziehm and Thornton, 2013). Here,
we present a major Suerurv update, comprising improvements and
new analysis features as well as increased data content.

2 Description

Suerurv is a database and analysis platform accessible through its
user-friendly web interface at https://www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton—srv/
databases/Suerurvl. The main website gives access to the database
through a search box, querying the manually curated annotations of
experimental conditions and treatments. Annotations use existing
databases and ontologies, where possible, and advanced searches
using specific database fields are available. All data from the data-
base can be analysed online and additional user data can be analysed

alone or in combination with database content. Various data for-
mats for file uploads are supported. The database has more than
doubled its data content since the original release and currently con-
tains survival records for more than 300 000 individuals from vari-
ous organisms including 160 000 Caenorhabditis elegans, 130 000
Drosophila and for the first time a large set of 12 000 mice.
Survival records belong to a total of 4226 cohorts from 60 publica-
tions (see Supplementary Material) and include survival under vari-
ous conditions such as different temperatures, dietary conditions,
genetic mutations and drug administration regimes.

2.1 Analysis features

The Suerurv analysis features include basic Kaplan—Meier survival
plots showing the percentage of the population alive over time.
Additional representations include incidence plots, showing the dis-
tribution of deaths, and log mortality plots, showing the instantan-
eous log-risk of dying. Plots are available in different graphics
formats including PNG, SVG and PDF.

Statistical differences in survival between cohorts can be tested
using the log-rank test or generalized Wilcoxon test. The Wang—
Allison test (Wang et al., 2004) for difference in ‘maximal’ survival
and Fisher’s exact test (Fisher, 1934) for difference at a user-defined
time point can be applied, as can Cox proportional hazards analysis
(Cox, 1972) with Efron approximation for ties. Cox analysis fea-
tures include interaction terms, an automatically conducted test of
the proportional hazards assumption and diagnostic plots showing
the scaled Schoenfeld residuals (see FAQ online and Grambsch and
Therneau, 1994 for more information).

All public cohorts are published under the Creative Commons
Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/)
and can be directly downloaded individually in various file formats.
Whole database MySQL dumps are provided upon request.

2.2 New features

In addition to the large increase in data, a major new feature is the
ability to generate survival density plots. This novel visualization
shows the distribution of a group of survival curves as a two-dimen-
sional density, which can be combined with survival plots of

vival of 290 Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) lines overlaid with

individual cohorts superimposed on top (see Fig. 1). Survival density
plots are composed of horizontal density estimates, which make it
highly sensitive for differences in the decreasing section of survival
curves usually of interest, while the typical initial horizontal stretch
is underestimated.

Previously, mortality models were only calculated once the data
were inserted in the database. Now, the full set of six common
mathematical mortality models (Exponential, Weibull, Gompertz,
Gompertz-Makeham, Logistic and Logistic-Makeham model) can
be directly calculated online for data uploaded by the user for ana-
lysis and user-defined meta-cohorts. In addition, all data from the
database or user-files can now be analysed by pair-wise joint mortal-
ity modelling and detection of significant model improvement by
separately fitted single parameters, i.e. detection of significantly dif-
ferent optimal model parameters. This analysis determines if two
survival cohorts differ with respect to a specific mortality model fac-
tor, e.g. baseline hazard rate, rather than in general or at a specific
time, thereby markedly extending the diagnostic options.

Moreover, the new release of Suerurv contains various add-
itional features and improvements, including colouring schemes and
time units for plotting and plot output as a list of x and y values for
plotting in external programs for customized graphics.

2.3 Implementation

The web interface is implemented in PHP on an Apache webserver
using secure https for all connections. All data are stored in a
MySQL database. Single cohort mortality models and descriptive
statistics are pre-calculated and cached for quick retrieval.

Genes and alleles are annotated using organism-specific data-
bases such as FlyBase (Dos Santos et al., 2015), WormBase (Harris
et al., 2014) or MGI (Eppig et al., 2015). Species are referenced
through NCBI Taxonomy, compounds annotated using ChEBI iden-
tifiers (Hastings et al., 2013), units specified using Unit Ontology
and publications referenced through PubMed ID or DOI, where
possible.

Visualization and survival analysis functions are realized via ser-
ver-side R scripts using the survival package (Therneau, 2015) and
the Survomatic package (Bokov and Gelfond, 2010), which includes
an R port of WinModest (Pletcher, 1999). We implemented the
Wang—Allison test in R. Survival density plots were implemented
using independent 1D density estimates for each 2-percentage sur-
vival band across all cohorts and times using a Gaussian kernel with
a smoothing bandwidth computed by Silverman’s rule of thumb
(Silverman, 1986, eq 3.31). The results are smoothed using directly
neighbouring survival bands.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Retrocopies are copies of mature RNAs that are usually
devoid of regulatory sequences and introns. They have routinely been
classified as processed pseudo-genes with little or no biological rele-
vance. However, recent findings have revealed functional roles for ret-
rocopies, as well as their high frequency in some organisms, such as
primates. Despite their increasing importance, there is no user-friendly
and publicly available resource for the study of retrocopies.

Results: Here, we present RCPedia, an integrative and user-friendly
database designed for the study of retrocopied genes. RCPedia con-
tains a complete catalogue of the retrocopies that are known to be pre-
sent in human and five other primate genomes, their genomic context,
inter-species conservation and gene expression data. RCPedia also
offers a streamlined data representation and an efficient query system.
Availability and implementation: RCPedia is available at http://www.
bioinfo.mochsl.org.br/rcpedia.

1 INTRODUCTION

Retrocopies are gene copies that are generated by reverse tran-
scription and genomic integration of transcribed mRNAs.
Although retrocopies have been described since the early 1980s
Wanin, 1985), their functional roles have only recently been re-
vealed (Ciomborowska et al., 2013; McEntee et al., 2011;
Poliseno et al., 2010). Retrocopies occur frequently in many gen-
omes, including those of primates (Marques et al., 2005), and
some retrocopies are transcribed and have putative functions [see
(Kaessmann et al., 2009) for a review].

Interestingly, retrocopies have idiosyncrasies that simplify
their identiﬁcation. The four main characteristics are as follows:
(i) an original multi-exonic parental gene copy in the genome;
(ii) a mono-exonic region, without intronic regions; (iii) a poly-A
stretch located in the 3’-most region; or (iv) direct repeats of 8—12
nucleotides (nt) ﬂanking them [see (Kaessmann et al., 2009) for a
review]. These characteristics make retrocopy identiﬁcation
through computational pipelines reasonably straightforward,
especially for species for which well-assembled genomes and
transcriptomes are available.

Despite this, there is still a lack a publicly available and
easy-to-use resources dedicated to the study of retrocopies

(Kaessmann et al., 2009), making it necessary either to use
manual and multi-step approaches to explore retrocopies or to
use non-specialized databases, such as the pseudogene databases
(e.g. http://www.pseudogene.org/), that contain only basic and/
or restricted information. Here, we describe RCPedia, a publicly
available database that was developed for the study of retroco-
pies. RCPedia contains a myriad of information on retrocopied
genes from six primate genomes (human, chimp, gorilla, orangu-
tan, rhesus and marmoset), as well as a streamlined graphical
data representation and an efﬁcient information query system.

2 DATA RETRIEVAL AND CURATION

2.1 Data sources

The detection of retrocopies in eukaryotic genomes relies on two
fundamental datasets: (i) a reference genome sequence and (ii) a
set of known transcripts from each organism. The current version
of RCPedia is based on genomic data from the UCSC Genome
Browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu): human (hgl9), chimpanzee
(panTroS), gorilla (gorGor3), orangutan (ponAbe2), rhesus
(rheMac2) and marmoset (calJacS). We used RefSeq sequences
(http://www.ncbi.nih.gov/RefSeq) as the source of known tran-
scripts, except for gorilla for which there are no RefSeq data.
For gorilla, we used Ensembl transcripts (http://www.ensembl.
org/). To evaluate retrocopy expression, we re—analysed the pub-
licly available RNA-seq data from six tissues (brain, cerebellum,
heart, liver, kidney and testis) of ﬁve primates (human, chimp,
gorilla, orangutan and rhesus) (Brawand et al., 2011).

2.2 Identifying orthologous retrocopies

The next step was to determine retrocopy conservation among
the six primates. To avoid misidentiﬁcation, we deﬁned ortholo-
gous retroposition events based on conservation of the retrocopy
and the ﬂanking genomic regions. All retrocopies and their
ﬂanking regions (3 kb up- and downstream, without repetitive
sequences) were aligned against the other primate genomes
using BLAT [(Kent, 2002) with the following parameters: -
mask=lower; tileSize: l2; -minScore= 50; -minIdentity=0].
Only loci that matched the retrocopy and its ﬂanking regions
were considered as orthologous and, therefore, conserved.

2.3 Expression data

To detect retrocopies that were expressed, we developed a strin-
gent multi-step pipeline. First, we searched for chimeric tran-
scripts by analysing all intragenic retrocopies. We used
GSNAP (parameters: -t 30; -B 4; —nofails; -A sam; -m 2; -n l)

to align all RNA-seq reads against genomic loci containing intra-
genic retrocopies Wu and Nacu, 2010). Then, we selected only
the alignments (alignment score >20) that showed two separated
blocks (distance between blocks: >42 nt), where one read over-
lapped the retrocopy and the other aligned with the host gene.
Alignments that were not deﬁned by a canonical splicing site
(GT-AG) were also ﬁltered out. Intragenic retrocopies that con-
tained at least ﬁve reads and showed this alignment pattern were
considered to be expressed. Second, we searched for retrocopy
expression per se by aligning all the reads against their respective
genomes and transcriptomes. The alignment against the tran-
scriptome data was important for removing false positive align-
ments derived from exon—exon junctions. Only unique genome
matches (alignment score: >40) that were ﬁltered by aligning
them with the transcriptome data were used for gene expression
analysis. At least ﬁve supporting reads were required for a retro-
copy to be considered as expressed.

3 DATABASE IMPLEMENTATION

RCPedia is a database and a front-end interface. The database
was build over MySQL (http://www.mysql.com). The website was
developed mainly using PHP (http://www.php.net) based on
CakePHP (http://cakephp.org) as the framework for the develop-
ment of an efﬁcient Model-View-Controller front-end. All gen-
omic annotation and gene expression data were processed
using Perl (http://www.perl.org) scripts developed in-house.
Brieﬂy, all coding transcripts from RefSeq (and Ensembl for gor-
illa) were downloaded and aligned against their respective refer-
ence genomes using BLAT [(Kent, 2002) with the following
parameters: -mask 2 lower; -tileSize = 12; -minIdentity = 75;
-minScore = 100]. All alignments were processed and sequences
with >75 % identity, and either a sequence alignment length >50%
or, at least, 120 matched nucleotides, were selected. Based on the
expected genomic characteristics for retrocopies, we designed a
four-step strategy to identify them. First, any alignment contain-
ing gaps >15 kb in length was eliminated. This step eliminated
transcripts with large (large) introns but kept retroelements,
such as Long Interspersed Elements (LINEs) (~6 kb) and Short
Interspersed Elements (SINEs) (<1kb), that are frequently in-
serted inside retrocopied loci. Second, we retrieved the exon—
exon boundary positions from the parental genes. Next, we
mapped these boundary positions onto the retrocopies and
searched for gaps between them. Putative retrocopy alignments
that contained one or more gaps were excluded because they are
unlikely to have been derived from retroduplications. Third, only
gene copies that contained >50 nt from two or more exons of the
parental genes were selected. Finally, we deﬁned the retrocopy set
by selecting all remaining alignments and, if necessary, grouping
any alignments that were mapped onto the same genomic locus
(Supplementary Fig. S1).

4 DATABASE QUERY INTERFACE AND OUTPUT
VISUALIZATION

4.1 The query system

The RCPedia query system is easy-to-use, complete and fast. It
includes gene (e. g. GAPDH), chromosome (e. g. chr17), genomic

position orientation (e. g. chr17:28 102 500—29 112 200), gene alias
(e.g. RAS) and gene annotation keyword (e.g. kinase or onco-
gene) searches, making it easy for the user to explore the genes
and genomic locations that match their retrocopy events.

4.2 Results

Because there are many unnamed retrocopies, the search output
results in RCPedia are based on parental gene names. The results
of a query can be presented from two data Visualization perspec-
tives: (i) the parental gene perspective, which helps the user to
Visualize all retrocopied events of a given parental gene, as well as
their genomic loci, and their identity to retrocopies, for example
(for the full dataset, see the website) and (ii) the retrocopy per-
spective, which displays information, such as their genomic con-
text, identity to the parental gene, conservation in other species,
and retrocopy expression (see Supplementary Fig. S2 for a sche-
matic View).

5 USING RCPedia

To show how RCPedia can be used, we selected the human gene
DHF R as a sample query. RCPedia reported ﬁve retrocopies for
DHF R in the human genome (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Interestingly, one of the retrocopies was present only in the
human genome. Another retrocopy was expressed in four
human tissues (Supplementary Fig. S2), and it was reported pre-
viously that this locus is expressed and has a putative function
(McEntee et al., 2011).

6 CONCLUSION

RCPedia is a well-organized, user-friendly and streamlined
graphical representation resource dedicated to the study of retro-
copies in primate genomes. To the best of our knowledge,
RCPedia is the most comprehensive and publicly available data-
base in this ﬁeld, although some resources providing similar in-
formation (Karro et al., 2007; Kheliﬁ et al., 2005; Ortutay and
Vihinen, 2008). We strongly believe that RCPedia will signiﬁ-
cantly improve the annotation and functional characterization
of retrocopies present in primate genomes.

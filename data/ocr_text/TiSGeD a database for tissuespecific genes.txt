ABSTRACT

Summary: The tissue-specific genes are a group of genes whose
function and expression are preferred in one or several tissues/cell
types. Identification of these genes helps better understanding of
tissue—gene relationship, etiology and discovery of novel tissue-
specific drug targets. In this study, a statistical method is introduced
to detect tissue-specific genes from more than 123125 gene
expression profiles over 107 human tissues, 67 mouse tissues and
30 rat tissues. As a result, a novel subject-specialized repository,
namely the tissue-specific genes database (TiSGeD), is developed to
represent the analyzed results. Auxiliary information of tissue-specific
genes was also collected from biomedical literatures.

1 INTRODUCTION

The spatial and temporal variation in gene expression carries crucial
information of what the gene does (Bassett et al., 1999). Thanks
to the emergence of high-throughput technologies like microarray,
the expressions of thousands of genes in multiple tissues can be
now monitored simultaneously. Databases were thus constructed
for storing, representing and retrieving the information. Upon these
databases, a series of effective analysis tools were developed as
well to explore and interpret the massive amounts of data in the
context of existing knowledge. These include some sophisticated
algorithms that are able to ‘align’ or ‘cluster’ the gene expression
proﬁles so as to identify those non-trivial patterns such as correlated
expression, differential expression and speciﬁc expression (Barrett
et al., 2007; Parkinson et al., 2009; Vaquerizas et al., 2005; Wang
et al., 2006). Some even mapped the gene expression proﬁles onto
the regulatory, metabolic and cellular pathways (Liu et al., 2008;
Mlecnik et al., 2005; Slonim, 2002; Van Steensel, 2005). Nowadays,
there exist a lot of databases containing tissue-speciﬁc expression
information. Some databases like GEO (Barrett et al., 2007) and
ArrayExpress (Parkinson et al., 2009) generally deposit microarray
datasets produced by various experiments. Some databases like
TiGER (Liu et al., 2008), BODYMAP (Ogasawara et al., 2006),
BioGPS (Su et al., 2002) and TissueDistributionDBs, however,
mainly collect datasets of tissue-speciﬁc expressions. Many of these
databases enable users to Visualize and statistically analyze gene
expression proﬁles. Some further provide special tools to facilitate

the detection of non-trivial patterns (Liu et al., 2008). In this
study, we introduce a novel subject-specialized database, namely
the tissue-speciﬁc genes database (TiSGeD), which particularly
provides information of tissue-speciﬁc genes derived from literature
and data mining of gene expression proﬁles.

2 THE DATA

The microarray datasets and their latest gene chip annotation ﬁles
were derived from public microarray repositories GNF BioGPS,
NCBI GEO and EBI ArrayExpress. In current version of database,
eight high-quality datasets were chosen with criteria of: (i) proper
normalization of proﬁles by MAS or GCRMA methods, (ii) large
tissue scales, and (iii) enough ‘ﬁuctuation’ of gene expressions over
multiple tissues. These criteria ensure the datasets reliable, useful
and representative. Removing those incomplete or defective proﬁles,
the TiSGeD release 1.0 currently compiled more than 123 125
distinct gene expression proﬁles over 107 human tissues, 67 mouse
tissues and 30 rat tissues. In addition to microarray data, tissue-
speciﬁc genes were also manually collected by keyword search of
NCBI biomedical literature database PubMed.

3 THE METHOD

Strictly, the tissue-speciﬁc gene is deﬁned as gene whose function
and expression is restricted to a particular tissue or cell type.
However, in many cases, the speciﬁcity concept is broadened to
tissue selectivity that gene expression is enriched in one or several
tissues/cell types (Shuang et al., 2006). In TiSGeD, we presented
genes of both strictly speciﬁc and highly selective in tissues.

Brieﬂy, the tissue-speciﬁc gene is detected by solving a linear
algebra problem of scalar projection in this study. First, transform
each expression proﬁle of gene x into a vector Xp:

Xp=(X1,X2,X3,...,Xi,...,Xn) (1)

where n is the number of tissues in the proﬁle and x,- is the
gene expression level in tissue 1'. For each element in the proﬁle
Xp, the expression x,- can also be represented by a vector X,- in
high—dimension tissue spaces:

x,-=(0,0,0,...,x,-,...,0) (2)

Then, the tissue speciﬁcity of gene x in tissue 1' is determined by
calculating the ratio of vector Xi’s scalar projection in the direction
of vector Xp (i.e. ||X| |) against the length of Xp (i.e. ||Xp||):

||X||=|(Xi°Xp)/||Xp|||; (3)

Speciﬁcity measure (SPM) = ||X| | / | |Xp | |. (4)

Theoretically, the SPM ranges from 0 to 1.0. A value close to 1.0
indicates that element x,- is the major contributor to the length of
proﬁle Xp in high-dimension tissue spaces; in biological term, high
tissue speciﬁcity.

In practice, user can rely on the SPM value to quantitatively
estimate the tissue speciﬁcity of a gene in a proﬁle regardless of
its absolute expression level. The larger the SPM value, the higher
the tissue speciﬁcity is. However, in the cases of proﬁles with
‘spiked’ expression patterns (which gene expressions are highly
selective in several similar tissues), a large SPM value may not
be achieved. As a feasible solution, the original gene expression
proﬁles are reformatted by merging several similar subtissues into
an ‘integrative’ tissue (individual expressions are summed up as the
expression of the representative) according to the organ hierarchy
tree adopted in this study. For example, intestine represents for small
intestine, large intestine, etc. As a result, the ‘spiked’ expression
pattern can then be detected by SPM analysis as an enriched
expression.

4 DATABASE DESCRIPTION

The TiSGeD database is now accessible at http://bi0inf.xmu.edu
.cn/databases/TiSGeD/index.html. It was curated on Red Hat Linux
release 9 operating system. The data were managed by the RDBMS
Oracle 10 g. Interactive user interfaces and search engines were
coded by PHP or J avaScript. Two methods were developed for
rapid access of the TiSGeD database. They are brieﬂy described
as follows:

A standard search method is designed to retrieve information
Via keyword query forms. User is required to type partial or full
keywords in the respective text ﬁelds of either gene symbol or tissue
name. Wild-card characters like ‘*, &, ?’ are not supported. At the
same time, a positive threshold SPM value, e.g. 0.9 (highly tissue
speciﬁc), is required to initiate the search. Once a keyword and a
valid SPM value are submitted, a list of gene symbols or tissue
names that meet the query criteria will be responded in alphabet
order, respectively. Clicking on the gene symbol or tissue name will
ﬁnally lead to the detailed information page of tissue-speciﬁc gene.
The literature records are always given regardless of the threshold
SPM value. For the user who has no speciﬁc searching intention,
a foolproof quick search method is available for ﬂexible access of
database by just providing a keyword or keyword combination.

TiSGeD also offers an alternative browse method for direct
retrieval of tissue— speciﬁc genes. User is allowed to query the tissue-
speciﬁc genes by species and tissues/cell types. Data of three species
(human, mouse and rat) are now available for browsing. Every
tissue in these three species was non-redundantly assigned into
branches of the physiological organ hierarchy trees and arranged
in alphabet order. All cell types were put under an isolated
branch of ‘Cells’. The branches of the trees are expandable up
to maximum ﬁve levels. Via the tissue hierarchy trees, user can
easily browse information by tissues. Before that, a threshold SPM
value is required in advance. Clicking on a tissue name, genes
that speciﬁcally/selectively expressed in this tissue will be listed
in descending order of their SPM values.

The detailed information page is presented in sections of Gene
Information, Microarray/Literature Evidences and Homologenes.

The Gene Information section contains brief information of
gene including gene symbol, gene description and UniGene ID.
Cross-links to the Gene Ontology database and the UniGene
database Via gene symbol or UniGene ID are also provided.
In the Microarray/Literature Evidences section, records of the
tissue-speciﬁc expressions are listed one by one in descending
order of SPM values. Each record contains the information of
probeset_ID, SPM value, species, dataset and tissue while available.
The respective gene expression proﬁles are further analyzed and
illustrated in charts. The literature evidences are also presented in
this section while available, including the contents of experiment
method, condition, material, PubMed ID, etc. In the last section of
Homologenes, the TiSGeD lists the homologous genes in human,
mouse or rat while available for quick access and comparison of
their expressions in tissue.

Currently, total of 6782 distinct tissue speciﬁcally expressed genes
(SPM>0.9) were identiﬁed Via SPM analysis of microarray data,
including 2032 human genes, 4229 mouse genes and 521 rat genes.
Identiﬁcation of these tissue-speciﬁc genes facilitates our better
understanding of gene function. For example, the myosin light
chain 3 (Myl3) gene was reported to function in cardiac muscle
contraction and may play a role in cardiomyopathy. This gene is
detected consistently as highly heart-speciﬁc gene in human, mouse
and rat (SPM = 1.00, 0.99 and 0.97, respectively) in TiSGeD. Villin—
1 is the Ca2+-regulated actin-binding protein and major component
of microvilli of intestinal epithelial cells and kidney proximal tubule
cells. In TiSGeD, gene of Villin—1 (Vi11) is found highly speciﬁc in
small intestine (much more than in large intestine and kidney) of
mouse, selective in liver (especially in HepG2 cell lines) and kidney
of human and non-selective in tissues of rat. The different tissue
speciﬁcity of Vi11 in animal models suggests that this gene may
play various physiological roles.

5 DATABASE COMPARISON AND UPDATE

According to our survey, most microarray databases, e.g. GEO,
ArrayExpress Altas and BioGPS, do not provide similar information
as TiSGeD does. Comparing to the TiGER which used EST data for
assessment of the tissue-speciﬁc expression, the TiSGeD mainly
adopted microarray data on a much broader tissue scale. Worthy of
mention, TiSGeD is the only one among the above databases that
provides auxiliary literature information.

TiSGeD is scheduled to be updated regularly. More high-quality
microarray datasets will be included into the database continually.
The literature data, however, will be updated yearly.

6 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

In this study, we presented a novel database of tissue-speciﬁc
genes as a useful resource for the communities of functional
genomics, system biology, etiology and drug discovery. A statistical
parameter SPM is introduced as a sensitive indicator in quantitative
estimation of gene spatial expression patterns. This simple idea
is also promising on the identiﬁcation of time-speciﬁc/selective
genes during development when high-quality microarray datasets
are available in the future. However, the SPM value does not
reﬂect the real expression level of a gene since all proﬁles are
transformed and projected into a linear region of 0—1.0. This
weakness may be made up by introducing another statistical

parameter to indicate the relative expression level of a gene against
all genes in a dataset. Besides, sometimes the assignment of tissue-
speciﬁc genes is inconsistent. This is mainly caused by the instability
of microarray technology in detecting genes at a low level. The
different tissue scales between experiments are also responsible for
the inconsistence. Therefore, introduction of a scoring system to
evaluate the detection of tissue-speciﬁc genes is also desired in the
future. Furthermore, SAGE is another high-throughput technology
that is popularly used in accurate measurement of gene expressions.
It may serve as a promising source in detection of the tissue
(time) speciﬁc genes if the SAGE experiments are demonstrated
in relatively large number of tissue (time) samples and in a
simultaneous manner.

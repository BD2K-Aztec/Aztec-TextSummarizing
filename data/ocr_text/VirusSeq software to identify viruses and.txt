ABSTRACT

Summary: We developed a new algorithmic method, VirusSeq, for
detecting known viruses and their integration sites in the human
genome using next-generation sequencing data. We evaluated
VirusSeq on whole-transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) data of 256
human cancer samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Using these
data, we showed that VirusSeq accurately detects the known viruses
and their integration sites with high sensitivity and specificity. VirusSeq
can also perform this function using whole-genome sequencing data
of human tissue.

Availability: VirusSeq has been implemented in PERL and is available
at http://odin.mdacc.tmc.edu/~xsu1NirusSeq.html.

1 INTRODUCTION

About 12% of all human cancers are known to be caused by viruses
(Hausen, 2009); thus, the detection of viruses in human cancer tissue
has signiﬁcant clinical implications in oncology. The advent of
next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies using paired-end
(PE) reads allows for the detection of viruses in human cancer
tissue at unprecedented levels of efﬁciency and precision. Several
groups have developed computational tools for pathogen/virus dis-
covery by exploiting the great amount of NGS data obtained from
human tissue (Isakov et al., 2011; Kostic et al., 2011). These groups
have implemented a computational subtraction analysis, which has
also been used to discover a new polyomavirus associated with most
cases of Merkel cell carcinoma (Feng et al., 2008).

Although detecting viruses in human tissue is important in clinical
oncology, investigating virus integration sites in host cell chromo-
somes is equally valuable, as insertional mutagenesis is one of the
most critical steps in the pathogenesis of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-
mediated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; Paterlini-Brechot et al.,
2003). NGS data have been used to map the HBV integration sites in
HCC samples (Jiang et al., 2012; Sung et al., 2012). However, no
software tool is currently available for detecting viral integration sites
by NGS data. We present VirusSeq, which starts with computational
subtraction on NGS data and subsequently identiﬁes viruses and

their potential integration sites in the human genome with high spe-
ciﬁcity and sensitivity.

2 METHODS

2.1 Mapping/Alignment

The PE reads in FASTQ format are used as input. VirusSeq works with both
whole-genome and whole-transcriptome sequencing data. The raw PE reads
are aligned to the reference genome using MOSAIK (Hiller et al., 2008) align-
ment software, which implements both a hashing scheme and the Srnith—
Waterman algorithm to produce gapped optimal alignments.

2.2 Virus detection from NGS data

VirusSeq starts with computational subtraction of human sequences by align-
ing raw PE reads from whole-genome/transcriptome sequencing to the human
genome reference. Thus, a set of non-human sequences is effectively generated
by subtracting the human sequences. In the second step, VirusSeq aligns the
non-human sequences against a comprehensive database that includes all
known viral sequences from Genome Information Broker for Viruses
(http://gib-v.genes.nig.ac.jp/) and quantiﬁes the virus representation by the
overall count of mapped reads within a virus genome to determine the exist-
ence of viruses in human samples with an empirical cut-off. Any virus with an
overall count of mapped reads below the cut-off is treated as non-existent. We
used 1000 as the cut-off for the overall count of mapped reads within a virus
genome; this cut-off should be applicable for both RNA-Seq data and
whole-genome sequencing data with 30x coverage. This cut-off should be
reduced by half or more for low-pass whole-genome sequencing data.

2.3 Identiﬁcation of virus integration sites

The genome sequences of viruses, which are well known in terms of cancer
association and were detected in the previous step in our The Cancer Genome
Atlas (TCGA) dataset, were concatenated into a single chromosome named
chrVirus, with related annotation of each viral gene in refFlat format. A new
hybrid reference genome named hgl9Virus is built by combining hgl9 and
chrVirus (designated as chr25 in hgl9Virus). All PE reads without computa-
tional subtraction are mapped to this reference (hgl9Virus). If the PE reads
are uniquely mapped with one end to one human chromosome and the other
to chr25, the read pair is reported as a discordant read pair. All discordant
reads are then annotated with human and viral genes deﬁned in the curated
refFlat ﬁle. VirusSeq then clusters the discordant read pairs that support the
same integration (fusion) event (e.g., HBV-MLL4). VirusSeq implements a
dynamic clustering procedure (details in Supplementary Notes) to accurately
determine the boundary of the cluster, whose size is constrained by the insert
size (fragment length) distribution. To remove outliers within a cluster,
VirusSeq implements the robust ‘extreme studentized deviate’ multiple-outlier
detection procedure (Rosner, 1983). Once outliers are detected within a clus-
ter, the cluster boundary is reset by excluding the outlier reads. VirusSeq
reports the fusion candidates by using both supporting pairs (at least four)

and junction spanning reads (at least one) as the cut-offs. Meanwhile, an in
silico sequence is generated using the consensus of reads within discordant
read clusters for each fusion candidate to help the PCR primer design, which
facilitates quick PCR validation.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

To test the accuracy of VirusSeq, we analysed RNA-Seq data of 17
HCC cancers available in the TCGA database and detected HBV
transcripts in four cases (Table 1), two of which are from patients
with serologic evidence of HBV infection and one from a patient
who is seronegative for HBV (and hepatitis C virus). Serology data
were not available for the remaining case. Viral integration loci
identiﬁed in our analysis included known genes MLL4 (two cancers;
both from the two HBV-seropositive patients) and TERT, ITGAD,
TEAD1, TECRL, C19orf55 and MIR548D2. Interestingly, the
cancer with TERT-associated HBV sequences came from the patient
who was reportedly seronegative for HBV. Our ﬁndings validate
other reports that have demonstrated HBV insertion in TERT and
MLL4 (Ferber et al., 2003, Saigo et al., 2008).

We also analysed RNA-Seq data of 239 cases of head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) available in the TCGA database.
We detected human papillomavirus (HPV) transcripts in 37 cancers
as follows: 30 cancers with HPV16, ﬁve cancers with HPV33, one
cancer with HPV35 and one cancer with Epstein—Barr virus. In 24
cancers, HPV transcripts encoding for key viral proteins/oncopro-
teins (E7 in 22 cases; E6 in 20 cases; E1 in 17 cases and E4 in eight
cases) were integrated in the cancer genome, the majority in associ-
ation with known genes. We used the HPV16 status from colorimetric
in situ hybridization and the p16 immunohistochemistry data (clinical
data) to estimate the sensitivity and speciﬁcity for HPV16 detection.
We found that a total of eight samples were HPV16-positive from
colorimetric in situ hybridization (six HPV16-positive) and/or p16
immunohistochemistry (seven HPV16-positive), and 36 samples
were HPV16-negative. The HPV16 status was not available for all
the remaining samples. The conﬁdence intervals (CIs) were estimated
using the Wilson score method by taking the sample size into con-
sideration. For this HNSCC dataset, the sensitivity was 100% (8/8)
with a 95% CI of 67.6—100%, and speciﬁcity was 100% (36/36) with
a 95% CI of 90.4—100% (Table 2).

We have developed a new algorithmic method called VirusSeq for
detecting the known viruses and their integration sites in the human
genome using NGS data. We evaluated VirusSeq on RNA-Seq data
of 17 HCC and 239 HNSCC samples and showed that VirusSeq
accurately detects the known viruses and their integration sites.
VirusSeq can also perform this function using whole-genome sequen-
cing data obtained from human tissue. The main limitation of
VirusSeq is the requirement of the known virus database to nominate
candidate viruses in human cancer tissue. This will certainly miss
novel viruses that are not in the virus database. We expect
VirusSeq to be an effective solution for detecting viruses and their
integration sites in cancer studies. We invite users to test our software.

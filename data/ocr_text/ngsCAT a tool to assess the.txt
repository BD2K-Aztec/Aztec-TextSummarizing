ABSTRACT

Motivation: Targeted enrichment sequencing by next-generation
sequencing is a common approach to interrogate specific loci or the
whole exome in the human genome. The efficiency and the lack of
bias in the enrichment process need to be assessed as a quality con-
trol step before performing downstream analysis of the sequence
data. Tools that can report on the sensitivity, speciﬁcity, uniformity
and other enrichment-specific features are needed.

Results: We have implemented the next-generation sequencing data
Capture Assessment Tool (ngsCAT), a tool that takes the information
of the mapped reads and the coordinates of the targeted regions as
input files, and generates a report with metrics and figures that allows
the evaluation of the efficiency of the enrichment process. The tool can
also take as input the information of two samples allowing the com-
parison of two different experiments.

ngsCAT can be found at http://www.bioinfomgp.org/ngscat.

1 INTRODUCTION

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have opened
new opportunities for inspecting and understanding genomic
and transcriptomic sequences providing a wealth of new data.
Whole-genome sequencing is now technically feasible; however,
it is still expensive to run, and in many cases, only speciﬁc genomic
regions are being sequenced. For instance, whole-exome sequen-
cing is being extensively used to discover gene mutations for her-
editary diseases, and high-throughput sequencing of gene panels is
starting to be explored as a molecular diagnostic tool (Sikkema—
Raddatz et al., 2013). Thus, targeted NGS has become a common
tool for interrogating at once several loci or all coding regions of
the genome at a relatively low cost (Clark et al., 2011).

Target enrichment for high-throughput sequencing includes a
capture step where probes are hybridized to complementary frag-
ments of genomic DNA. Successful sequencing is highly dependent

on the efﬁciency of this target-enrichment procedure. The degree of
enrichment can be estimated before sequencing by quantitative
polymerase chain reaction of a few target regions. Only the analysis
of the sequence data can reveal the degree of enrichment for all
regions of interest (ROIs) and can provide information on the
whole capture process showing if any bias is present.

Comparative studies for target-enrichment experiments have
been carried out by a number of works that allow to identify
some critical aspects to evaluate: (i) sensitivity, to assess the
quality of the coverage on target regions; (ii) specificity, to
measure the proportion of off-target reads; and (iii) uniformity,
to detect sequencing biases in the targeted regions (Asan et al.,
2011; Clark et al., 2011; Tewhey et al., 2009). Systematic de-
tection of biases owing to the capture step is critical to save
time and to avoid drawing incorrect conclusions from down-
stream analysis.

Currently, the number of software packages that allow system-
atic assessment of the enrichment process is limited. For instance,
there are some tools that may be used to get some general stat-
istics for the coverage on/off—target reads and GC metrics like
BEDTools (Quinlan and Hall, 2010) or Picard tools (http://
picard.sourceforge.net). The functionality of these tools for cap-
ture efﬁciency assessment is limited and requires the implemen-
tation of complex scripts to produce informative results, limiting
their use to researchers with knowledge on scripting languages. A
more speciﬁc tool called TEQC has recently been implemented in
R, but it has high requirements of RAM memory when target
regions of the size of current exomes (~50 Mb) are analyzed
(Hummel et al., 2011). NGSrich is another recent tool, imple-
mented in Java, intended to be used as part of a pipeline in a
high-performance computing environment, but it lacks of
some functionality and its reporting is limited (F rommolt
et al., 2012). A comparison of NGS data Capture Assessment
Tool (ngsCAT), TEQC and NGSrich is provided in the
Supplementary Data.

We here present ngsCAT, a Linux command line tool that
allows a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of the
capture step in terms of sensitivity, speciﬁcity and uniformity.
ngsCAT can be run on a standard computer and integrates the
functionalities of the aforementioned tools extending them to
generate a detailed report with metrics, summary tables, ﬁgures
and plots that evaluate the efﬁciency of the targeted enrichment
process.

2 APPLICATION DESCRIPTION

ngsCAT is a command-line application written in Python that
only requires as input a binary alignment map (BAM) ﬁle and a
browser extensible data (BED) ﬁle describing the ROIs.
Therefore, the tool can handle data from all sequencing plat-
forms and can be easily integrated as part of automated analysis
pipelines. ngsCAT implements an efﬁcient multi-threaded pro-
cessing enabling even a full execution for human exome data in a
standard computer (Intel Core 2 Duo, 4GB RAM).

The software calculates a number of graphs and statistics that
allow to assess the performance of the enrichment steps. Thus,
ngsCAT reports the number and percentage of reads on/off
target, the percentage of target bases covered at different cover-
age thresholds, the number of duplicated reads on/off target,
bedgraph tracks of off-target regions with high coverage, the
distribution of the coverage in the ROIs, the variability of the
coverage within the ROIs and the distribution of the coverage as
a function of GC content. The program can also draw a satur-
ation curve of the coverage as a function of the number of reads
that can serve to estimate whether sequencing a higher number of
reads will produce a signiﬁcant increase of the coverage in the
ROIs. ngsCAT can also process two samples at a time, which
allows a simple comparison of two samples. It can be used for the
analysis of small target regions as well as for larger regions like
whole exomes (see Supplementary Data).

The output is integrated in a concise and self-explanatory html
report. For each report section, a minimum threshold value can be
set to produce a warning if the values of the tested experiment are
beyond the preset threshold. Further documentation, examples
and updates can be found at http://www.bioinfomgp.org/ngscat.

3 RESULTS

To show how ngsCAT can assess the performance of the capture
process, three in-house datasets targeting ~5.8 Mb of the human
genome were used (see Supplementary Data for analysis pipeline
details). ngsCAT was used taking as input the BAM ﬁle and the
BED ﬁle that describes the targeted regions. First, we could check
the percentage of target bases covered at different coverage thresh-
olds (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. S1). Interestingly, we found
that ~80% of the targeted bases have at least a 10x coverage,
which is a relatively low percentage, and that the percentage of
reads on target is ~80%, which is a typical value for capture
experiments, suggesting that reads were properly enriched. The
10x coverage saturation curve tends to plateau at ~80% of cov-
ered positions (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. S2), indicating
that no more target bases with a 10x coverage will be obtained
by increasing sequencing depth. When ngsCAT was run with
probe coordinates, instead of ROI coordinates, ~95 % of the
bases were covered at 10x. In addition, the inspection of the
off-target information ﬁles showed the presence of a number of
off-target regions with a coverage higher than 15 x. Thus, ngsCAT
results allowed us to hypothesize that the low percentage of cov-
ered target bases could be due to the capture probe tiling and to
an off-target effect (see Supplementary Data).

4 CONCLUSIONS

Targeted NGS experiments are becoming a common way to in-
terrogate genomic ROIs at a relatively low cost. Systematically
assessing the performance of the capture step is critical before
continuing with downstream analysis. We have implemented
ngsCAT, a tool that allows to easily assess the enrichment efﬁ-
ciency with just one command-line run in a common computer.
This tool has been used as a quality control for >600 exomes
sequenced in our facility in the context of the Medical Genome
Project (http://www.medicalgenomeproject.com), allowing us to
detect samples not properly hybridized, optimize targeted enrich-
ment protocols and adjust data analysis pipelines.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Correlated mutations constitute a fundamental idea in
evolutionary biology, and understanding correlated mutations will, in
turn, facilitate an understanding of the genetic mechanisms governing
evolution. CorMut is an R package designed to compute correlated
mutations in the unit of codon or amino acid mutation. Three classical
methods were incorporated, and the computation results can be rep-
resented as correlation mutation networks. CorMut also enables the
comparison of correlated mutations between two different evolution-
ary conditions.

1 INTRODUCTION

In genetics, the Ka/Ks ratio (or a), dN/dS) is the ratio of the
number of non-synonymous substitutions per non-synonymous
site (Ka) to the number of synonymous substitutions per syn-
onymous site (Ks) (Hurst, 2002), which can be used as an indi-
cator of selective pressure acting on a protein-coding gene. The
selection pressure may reﬂect a change in the function of a gene
or a change in environmental conditions that forces the organism
to adapt. For example, the mutations to confer resistance of a
highly variable virus, e.g. HIV or HCV, to new antiviral drugs
may be expected to undergo positive selection in a patient popu-
lation treated with the drugs against the corresponding virus.

The concept of correlated mutations is a fundamental idea in
evolutionary biology. The amino acid substitution rates are ex-
pected to be limited by functional constraints (Tourasse and Li,
2000). Given the functional constraints operating on genes, a
mutation in one position can be compensated by an additional
mutation. As a result, mutation patterns can be formed by cor-
related mutations responsible for speciﬁc conditions.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Here, we developed an R/Bioconductor package to detect the
correlated mutations among positive selection sites by combining
Ka/Ks ratio and correlated mutations analysis. CorMut is suit-
able for computing the correlated mutations of highly variable
genomes, such as HIV and HCV.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

CorMut provides functions for computing Ka/Ks for individual
sites or speciﬁc amino acids and detecting correlated mutations
among them. The computation of Ka/Ks for an individual site or
speciﬁc amino was based on the model of Chen et a]. (2004).
Traditionally, Ka/Ks computation has been based on sequence
alignment, but this model was revised to compute the selection
pressure for individual sites or speciﬁc amino mutation. The Ka/
Ks of a speciﬁc amino acid substitution (X2Y) for a codon is
computed as follows:

M

K61 _ NS
KS — nY,tft‘I‘nY,va
"S, tft‘I‘nS, va

where NY and NS are the count of X—>Y mutations at that
codon and the count of synonymous mutations observed at
that codon, respectively. Then, NY/Ns is normalized by the
ratio expected under a random mutation model where selection
pressure is absent, which is represented as the denominator of
the formula. In the random mutation model, ft and fV indicate
the transition and transversion frequencies, respectively. They
are measured from the entire dataset according to the following
formulas: ftth/nIS and fV=NV/nVS, where S is the total
number of samples, Nt and NV are the numbers of observed
transition and transversion mutations, respectively, and nt and
nV are the number of possible transitions and transversions in the
focused region (simply equal to its length L and 2L, respectively).

CorMut incorporates three classical methods to detect corre-
lated mutations, including conditional selection pressure, mutual
information and Jaccard index. Conditional selection pressure,
also known as conditional Ka/Ks, indicates the Ka/Ks of one
mutation (X) in the presence of non-synonymous mutations (Y).
It can be used to evaluate the inﬂuence of X on Y. Mutual in-
formation can be used to measure the mutual dependence of two

random variables, making it possible to measure the correlated
mutations between two positions (Cover and Thomas, 2012).
Jaccard index measures the similarity between two variables,
and it has been widely used to measure correlated mutations
(Myers and Pillay, 2008; Reuman et al., 2010; Rhee et al., 2007).

The computation for correlated mutations consists of two
steps: First, the positive selection sites are detected using the
selection pressure-based method. Second, the mutation correl-
ations are computed among the positive selection sites using
the three methods described above. It should, however, be
noted that CorMut can also be used to compute correlated mu-
tations without considering selection pressure at all. Meanwhile,
CorMut facilitates the comparison of the correlated mutations
between two conditions by means of a correlated mutation
network.

3 FUNCTIONS AND SAMPLES

CorMut enables the processing of multiple sequence alignment
ﬁles. Because sequences may have raw bases, the seqFormat func-
tion will replace the raw bases with common bases and delete the
gaps according to the reference sequence. As one raw base has
several common bases, a base causing an amino acid mutation
will be randomly chosen. Once this task is completed, CorMut
provides various functions to compute the correlated mutations.
For the conditional Ka/Ks and mutual information methods,
functions are provided to compute correlated mutations in the
codon and amino units. However, for J accard index method, the
computation is only provided for the amino unit.

CorMut provides a biCompare function to compare the corre-
lated mutations between two conditions by means of a correlated
mutation network. The biCompare results can be visualized by a
plot method. Here, 300 HIV protease sequences of treatment-
naive and treatment groups derived from an HIV drug-resistant
database will be used as examples.

As shown in Figure 1, only positive selection amino acid mu-
tations in treatment-naive or treatment groups were displayed.
Square nodes indicate the distinct amino acid mutations of the
treatment-naive group, which means that these nodes will be
non-positive selection in the treatment group. Circle nodes
indicate that distinct positive amino acid mutations appeared
in the treatment group. The plot function also has an option
for displaying the unchanged positive selection nodes in both
conditions. If plot Unchanged is FALSE, then the unchanged
positive selection nodes in both conditions will not be displayed.

Fig. 1. The network represents correlated mutations between treatment-
naive and treatment groups. Square nodes indicate the distinct amino
acid mutations of treatment-naive group, while circle nodes indicate the
distinct positive amino acid mutations that appeared in the treatment
group. The edge between two nodes indicates the signiﬁcant correlation
between two mutations

Many software tools are available for correlated mutation
analysis, such as CMAT (Jeong and Kim, 2012), HelixCorr
(Fuchs et al., 2007) and OMES-KASS (Kass and Horovitz,
2002), but each of these tools has a singular focus. For example,
HelixCorr was speciﬁcally designed for the transmembrane parts
of membrane proteins. In contrast, CorMut is multifunctional
and can be applied to highly variable genomes. One particular
advantage of CorMut is pre-ﬁltering mutations based on
selection pressure methods, which enables user to focus on the
mutations of evolutionary interest. CorMut also displays the
correlated mutations in network view and intuitively compares
the correlated mutations between two conditions by such corre-
lated mutation network.

4 CONCLUSION

The CorMut package provides simple and ﬂexible functionality
to compute and display the correlated mutations between codons
or amino mutations. The representation of correlation mutations
as a network and the ability to compare correlated mutations
between two conditions make it possible to understand the gen-
etic mechanisms governing evolution.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: The metabolic pathway is an important biochemical
reaction network involving enzymatic reactions among chemical com-
pounds. However, it is assumed that a large number of metabolic
pathways remain unknown, and many reactions are still missing
even in known pathways. Therefore, the most important challenge in
metabolomics is the automated de novo reconstruction of metabolic
pathways, which includes the elucidation of previously unknown reac-
tions to bridge the metabolic gaps.

Results: In this article, we develop a novel method to reconstruct
metabolic pathways from a large compound set in the reaction-filling
framework. We define feature vectors representing the chemical trans-
formation patterns of compound—compound pairs in enzymatic reac-
tions using chemical fingerprints. We apply a sparsity-induced
classifier to learn what we refer to as ‘enzymatic-reaction likeness’,
i.e. whether compound pairs are possibly converted to each other by
enzymatic reactions. The originality of our method lies in the search for
potential reactions among many compounds at a time, in the extrac-
tion of reaction-related chemical transformation patterns and in the
large-scale applicability owing to the computational efficiency. In the
results, we demonstrate the usefulness of our proposed method on
the de novo reconstruction of 134 metabolic pathways in Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). Our comprehensively
predicted reaction networks of 15 698 compounds enable us to sug-
gest many potential pathways and to increase research productivity in
metabolomics.

1 INTRODUCTION

The importance of metabolomics research is growing fast in
recent years. Metabolomics can provide sensitive and thorough
metabolic signatures as effective biomarkers for the diagnosis
of diseases such as cancer. The knowledge about metabolism
(e.g. reaction networks, ﬂuxes, drug metabolism) has proven
useful for performing rational drug design (Cascante et al.,
2002; Hellerstein and Murphy, 2004). Some metabolites of
plants and fungi have long been of Vital use to drug leads
in the pharmaceutical industry (Simmond and Grayer, 1999).

TThe authors wish it to be known that, in their opinion, the ﬁrst three
authors should be regarded as joint First Authors.

In addition, systematic simulation studies on metabolic path-
ways rely on accurately predeﬁned reaction network models.
However, a large number of metabolic pathways remain un-
known, and many reaction steps are still missing even in
known pathways. For example, detailed analysis of human
metabolome (Sreekumar et al., 2009) implies that even well-
investigated species like human have many unknown metabolic
pathways. As the experimental veriﬁcation of reaction net-
works remains daunting, there is a strong need to develop in
silico methods to infer unknown but possible metabolic
pathways.

A variety of computational methods for reconstructing meta-
bolic pathways have been developed thus far, which can be cate-
gorized into the three frameworks, as shown in Figure 1. The
most traditional one is ‘reference-based framework’ (Fig. 1A). In
this framework, many known pathways are collected from litera-
tures to construct a combined pathway, named ‘reference path-
way’, which only considers chemical transformations without
distinguishing the difference of organisms (Fig. 1A, left). For
an organism of interest, enzyme genes are assigned to appropri-
ate positions in predeﬁned reference pathways based on ortho-
logous information (and some other evidences if available) about
genes across different species (Bono et al., 1998; Dandekar et al.,
1999; F orst and Schulten, 1999; Galperin and Koonin, 1999)
(Fig. 1A, right). However, such reference pathway information
is available only for a limited set of genes, enzymes and metab-
olites, and it is inherently incomplete owing to the lack of experi-
mentally identiﬁed compounds and homology information.
These missing reaction steps may cause misleading interpret-
ations in practice. Therefore, the most important challenge in
metabolomics research is de novo reconstruction of metabolic
pathways, which includes the elucidation of previously unknown
reactions to bridge the metabolic gaps (Darvas, 1988; Greene
et al., 1999; Talafous et al., 1994).

The previous studies on the de novo reconstruction can be
classiﬁed based on different aspects, i.e. whether it automatically
hypothesizes the compounds that are not identiﬁed yet, whether
it relies on pre—deﬁned chemical transformation patterns and
whether the target (and/or source) compound(s) has/have to be
speciﬁed, as shown in Table 1. One framework is ‘compound—
ﬁlling framework’ (Fig. 1B), which predicts pathways by
hypothesizing intermediate compounds necessary between the
source and target compounds. Many of the prediction systems
based on this framework are not freely available (Darvas, 1988;
Greene et al., 1999; Talafous et al., 1994), but there are some free

Nate: ‘Yes’ and ‘No’ represent whether the studies are predeﬁned rule-based, re-

pounds needs to be speciﬁed, respectively. There are many previous studies in the
reference-based framework, but they are not regarded as de nova metabolic pathway
reconstruction.

web servers such as PathPred (Moriya et al., 2010) and Univer-
sity of Minnesota Pathway Prediction System (UMPPS; Gao
et al., 2011). A serious limitation of the compound-ﬁlling frame-
work is that it is not suitable for predicting pathways for many
compounds at a time owing to prohibitive computational cost.
Another framework for the de novo reconstruction is ‘reactian-
ﬁlling framework’ (Fig. 1C), which predicts pathways by ﬁlling
in reactions among many existing compounds at a time. Some of

the previous methods depend on predeﬁned chemical transform-
ation patterns (Hatzimanikatis et al., 2005; Nakamura et al.,
2012). The other previous methods reduce this dependency by
comparing chemical graph structures of all compounds in data-
bases and by determining possible chemical transformations
(Kotera et al., 2008; Tanaka et al., 2009), but they suffer from
huge computational costs. Thus, large-scale prediction is not
computationally feasible (Kotera et al., 2008), or its applicability
is limited only to ring-structured compounds (Tanaka et al.,
2009).

In this article, we develop a novel method for a de novo recon-
struction of metabolic pathways from a large compound set in
the reaction-ﬁlling framework. We deﬁne feature vectors
representing the chemical transformation patterns of com-
pound—compound pairs in enzymatic reactions using chemical
ﬁngerprints. We apply a sparsity-induced classiﬁer and support
vector machine (SVM) to learn what we refer to as ‘enzymatic—
reaction likeness’, i.e. whether a compound—compound pair is
possibly converted to each other by enzymatic reactions. The
originality of our method lies in the search for potential reactions
among many compounds at a time, in the extraction of chemical
transformation patterns and in the large-scale applicability
owing to the computational efﬁciency. In the results, we demon-
strate the usefulness of our proposed method on the de novo re-
construction of metabolic pathways in the Kyoto Encyclopedia
of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database (Kanehisa et al.,
2012). Our comprehensively predicted reaction networks enable
us to suggest many potential pathways and to increase research
productivity in metabolomics.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Enzymatic reactions and metabolic pathways

Enzymatic reactions and the associated chemical compounds were
retrieved from the KEGG LIGAND database (Kanehisa et al., 2012).
Chemical compounds in KEGG are given ID numbers consisting of a
letter ‘C’ and ﬁve numerals, e. g. C00002 for ATP. The number of all
chemical compounds with structure information in KEGG LIGAND is
15 698. Metabolic pathway information were retrieved from the KEGG
PATHWAY database (Kanehisa et al., 2012), where pathways are divided
into maps with ID numbers, such as Glycolysis and Gluconeogenesis
(map00010), TCA Cycle (map00020) and Pentose Phosphate Pathway
(map00030). We focus on 134 pathway maps involving at least 10 com-
pounds in this study. These pathway maps are classiﬁed into 11 categories,
such as carbohydrate metabolism and energy metabolism.

2.2 Compound ﬁngerprints

Chemical structures of compounds were encoded by chemical ﬁngerprints
corresponding to chemical substructures and various physicochemical
properties; therefore, each compound was represented by a high-dimen-
sional binary vector. We used the Chemistry Development Kit (CDK)
version 1.4.9 (Steinbeck et al., 2003) to calculate the following eight ﬁn-
gerprints; CDK ﬁngerprint, CDK extended ﬁngerprint, CDK graph-only
ﬁngerprint, CDK hybridization ﬁngerprint, E-state ﬁngerprint, Klekota—
Roth ﬁngerprint, MACCS ﬁngerprint and PubChem ﬁngerprint, and
their dimensions are 1024, 1022, 1024, 1024, 71, 4860, 164 and 879, re-
spectively, where the feature elements absent from the compound set are
merged. Chemically identical compounds with the same structures
(duplicates) were removed; therefore, structures of all compounds in
the dataset were unique.

2.3 Reactant pairs

In addition to the conventional reaction equation format, KEGG stores
‘reactant pair’ format (Kotera et al., 2004) to describe enzymatic reac-
tions. A reactant pair represents a pair of substrate and product with
conserved chemical moiety in the reaction. For example, the reaction
equation ‘glucose + A TP 2 glucose 6—phosphate + ADP’ consists of the
following three reactant pairs: ‘glucose<=>glucose 6—phosphate’ (conser-
ving a glucose moiety), ‘A T P<=>ADP’ (conserving an ADP moiety) and
‘A TP<=>glucose 6-phosphate’ (conserving a phosphate moiety). The
compound pair ‘glucose<=>ADP’ cannot be deﬁned as a reactant pair
because these two compounds do not conserve any atoms in a reaction.
As of November 2012, there were 13 564 reactant pairs stored in the
KEGG RPAIR database, which was used as the gold standard dataset.

Reactant pairs are classiﬁed into ﬁve types, main, trans, cofac, leave
and ligase, depending on the context in metabolic pathways, the topology
of the reactant pair graph (the pattern of substrate-product relations in
the reaction representing the ﬂow of atoms) and the atomic element in-
formation. The main type is given manually for at least one of the pairs in
the reactant pair graph, representing the main ﬂow of atoms, which gen-
erally includes the ﬂow in the pathway diagram and/or the ﬂow of or-
ganic carbon atoms. We used the reactant pair that was given main types
in this study.

2.4 Compound—compound pairs

A compound—compound pair has to be described in two distinct direc-
tions, i.e. forward and backward, to avoid to miss the similarity between a
forward direction of a reaction and a backward of another reaction.
Considering the distinction of forward and backward reactions, the
number of all possible compound pairs is n(n—1): 0(n2), where n is
the number of compounds. The computational cost of searching for simi-
lar compound—compound pairs would be 0(n4). Among all possible com-
pound—compound pairs, those involved in enzymatic reactions (reactant
pairs) found in all enzymatic reactions in KEGG were 13 564 (as of
November 2012). The number of compounds involved in these reactions
was 6729; thus, the number of all the combination of compounds (com-
pound—compound pairs) was 45 272 712. The number of all possible com-
pound—compound pairs in KEGG LIGAND (involving 15 698
compounds) is 246 411 506.

3 METHODS

We formulate the de novo metabolic pathway reconstruction as a series of
reaction predictions (estimation of the enzymatic-reaction likeness) of
each pair of chemical compounds on a metabolic pathway, where the
reaction prediction is solved as the following supervised classiﬁcation
problem. Given a collection of n(n — 1) compound—compound pairs
(Ci, Cj)(i = 1, ...,n,j = 1, ...,n,i7£j), we estimate a function f(C, C’)
that would predict whether a chemical compound C is converted to an-
other compound C’ in an enzymatic reaction. In addition, we aim to
extract biochemical features contributing to the reaction prediction. In
this section, we present a general approach to solve these problems in a
uniﬁed framework. Our approach consists of three major components: (i)
prediction model, (ii) vector representation of compound—compound
pairs and (iii) binary classiﬁer.

3.1 Prediction model

Linear models are a useful tool for classiﬁcation and regression especially
for high dimensional data. Basically, a linear model represents an object
0 by a feature vector d>(0) 6 ER”, and then deﬁnes a linear function
f(0) = wTd>(0), where w 6 ER” is a weight vector. The weight vector w
is estimated such that it can correctly predict the class of objects. The
object 0 is classiﬁed into positive or negative by thresholding the

computed value of f(0). Linear models also have an interpretability of
features. As each element of a feature vector d>(0) corresponds to an
element of the weight vector w, we can extract effective features contri-
buting to the prediction by sorting elements of d>(0) according to the
corresponding values of the weight vector w.

The prediction of enzymatic-reaction likeness is not trivial because the
object corresponds to a compound—compound pair in this study. Let C
and C’ be two chemical compounds. To apply the previous machine
learning approach to this problem, we need to represent a compound—
compound pair by a feature vector <I>(C, C’) and then estimate a linear
function f(C, C’) = wTd>(C, C’). The weight vector w is estimated such
that it can correctly predict enzymatic-reaction likeness of compound—
compound pairs. Finally, the reaction between C and C’ is predicted by
thresholding the value of f(C, C’).

3.2 Vector representation of compound—compound pairs

The design of feature vectors is crucial for the classiﬁcation ability and
interpretability of features in the linear model. We propose two kinds of
feature vectors for each compound—compound pair based on the bio-
chemical knowledge about enzymatic reactions.

Compounds C and C’ are represented by D-dimensional
ﬁngerprints (binary vectors) as d>(C) 2 (c1, 62, ..., cD)T and
d>(C’) = (c’l, c’z, ..., c’D)T, respectively, where ck, c; E {0, 1},
k = 1, ...,D. Let I(cond) be an indicator function, where I(cond) = 1 if
cond is true and otherwise I(cond) = 0. Here, we deﬁne two operations for
the ﬁngerprints as follows:

(MC) /\ cMUD = (1(01 = 0’1 = 1): °--:I(CD = 0’0 = 1)),
and
(<I>(C) e <I>(C’)) = (I(c1 = 1,c’1 = 0), ...,I(cD = 1,c’D = 0)).

(<I>(C) A d>(C’)) represents the common features in d>(C) and d>(C’),
which is referred to as common feature vector. On the other hand,
(<I>(C) e d>(C’)) represents the features present in d>(C) and absent in
d>(C’), which is referred to as differential feature vector. Thus, the both
feature vectors are expected to capture chemical transformation patterns
between compounds C and C’. Using these feature vectors, we propose
two kinds of feature vectors of any compound—compound pair as follows:

<I>(C. C’) = (<I>(C) A <I>(C’), <I>(C) e <I>(C’), <I>(C’) e d>(C))T.
and
«MC. 0) = «mo 9 d>(C’), d>(C’) e d>(C))T.

We shall refer to <I>(C, C’) and <I>(C, C’) as diff-common feature vector
and diff-only feature vector, respectively. The diff-common and diff-only
feature vectors are different in that the diff-common feature vector has
common features in addition to differential features. The diff-only feature
vector is expected to capture substructure changes around the reaction
center in the conversion of a chemical compound to another compound.
The diff-common feature vector is expected to additionally capture core
substructures kept in the conversion of a chemical compound to another
compound.

For example, if d>(C) = (1, 1,0) and d>(C’) = (1,0, 1) are given,
the corresponding feature vectors are computed as
d>(C, C’) = (1,0,0,0, 1,0,0,0, 1) and d>(C, C’) = (0,1,0,0,0,1). The
both feature vectors are asymmetry, i.e. <I>(C, C’) 75 d>(C’, C) and
<I>(C—,C’) 75 W.

3.3 Binary classiﬁer

We apply linear SVM as a binary classiﬁer. Models are typically learned
to minimize the objective function with a regularization for SVM. It is
well-known that the use of regularization is necessary to achieve a model
that generalizes well to unseen data, particularly if the dimension of

features is high. One common regularization is Lz-regularization, which
keeps most elements in the weight vector to be non-zeros; therefore, one
can suffer from interpreting features from learned weights. Another pos-
sible regularization is Ll-regularization that makes most elements in the
weight vector to be zeros; therefore, one can interpret a limited number
of informative features. In this study, we introduce linear SVM with
Ll-regularization for its high interpretability.

Given a collection of compound—compound pairs and their labels
(d>(C,-,Cj),y,-j) where yij 6 {+1, — 1} (i: 1, ...,n,j= 1, ...,n,i7£j),
linear SVM is formulated by the following unconstrained optimization
problem:

It i—l n
minZiZMw Z 
i=1 j=1

j=i+1
where
M,- = max{1 — yy-chr>(C,-, (3,), 0}.

To enhance the interpretability of linear models, the weight vector is
optimized with Ll-regularization as follows:

It i—l n
mwinnwlh + C2 {EM-1+ Z 
i=1 j=1

j=i+1

where H - III is L1 norm (the sum of absolute values in the vector) and C is
a hyper-parameter. Ll-regularization has an effect of making the weights
of uninformative features zeros without loss of classiﬁcation accuracy.
Ll-regularized linear SVM is referred to as LlSVM, whereas Lz-regular-
ized SVM is referred to as L2SVM.

Learning weight vectors from compound—compound pairs is a difﬁcult
problem. As the number of compound—compound pairs is the product of
all the compounds in a dataset, the problem becomes extremely large-
scale. In fact, our dataset consists of 15 698 compounds; thus, there are
246411506 possible compound—compound pairs in total. The previous
studies on classifying object pairs (e.g. compound—protein and protein—
protein pairs) have used kernel SVM, where the input of the SVM clas-
siﬁer is the kernel similarity matrix (Ben-Hur and Noble, 2005; Faulon
et al., 2008; Jacob and Vert, 2008). However, it is difﬁcult to apply the
kernel SVM to large-scale applications. This is because the time complex-
ity of the quadratic programming problem for the kernel SVM is 0(n6),
where n is the number of compounds, and the space complexity is 0(n4),
which is just for storing the kernel matrix. Moreover, the kernel SVM
does not have an interpretability of features. Another crucial observation
is that <I>(C, C’) and <I>(C, C’) are a sparse binary vector. For such sparse
binary vectors, weight vectors can be learned via efﬁcient optimization
algorithms (Hsieh et al., 2008). In this study, we used an efﬁcient algo-
rithm named LIBLINEAR, which is available from http://www.csie.ntu.
edu.tw/cjlin/liblinear/.

In practical applications, we regarded known reactant pairs as positive
examples and the other compound—compound pairs as negative examples
because it is impossible to obtain true negative data for enzyme reactions
in reality. In the learning phase, we randomly selected negative examples
for computational efﬁciency, where the ratio of negative examples against
positive examples is set to ﬁve in this study.

 

3.4 Baseline method

The most straightforward method for the reconstruction is a similarity-
based approach, assuming that reactive compound—compound pairs are
likely to share high chemical structure similarity. Actually, a substrate
compound and a product compound in an enzyme reaction tend to have
a big core structure, and their different region tend to be small (Kotera
et al., 2008). Tanimoto similarity (J accard similarity) between compound
ﬁngerprints can often be considered as a measure of chemical structure
similarity between two compounds. A direct strategy is therefore to

predict the enzyme-reaction likeness between two compounds whenever
the Tanimoto similarity value between these compounds is above a
threshold to be determined. We refer to this approach as BASELINE.

4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

4.1 Performance evaluation on enzymatic-reaction
likeness

We tested LlSVM and L2SVM and BASELINE on their
abilities to predict the enzymatic-reaction likeness of given com-
pound—compound pairs from their chemical ﬁngerprint data. We
performed the following 5-fold cross-validation. (i) We randomly
split compound—compound pairs in the gold standard data into
ﬁve subsets of roughly equal sizes. We regarded known reactant
pairs as positive examples and the other compound—compound
pairs as negative examples. (ii) We took each subset as a test set
and the remaining four subsets as a training set. (iii) We trained a
predictive model based only on the training set. (iv) We com-
puted the prediction scores for compound—compound pairs in
the test set. (v) Finally, we evaluated the prediction accuracy
over the ﬁve folds.

We evaluated the prediction performance by the receiver oper-
ating characteristic curve, which is a plot of true positives as a
function of false positives based on various thresholds, where
true positives are correctly predicted reactions and false positives
are positively predicted pairs that are not present in the gold
standard reactions. We summarized the performance by the
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)
score, where l is for a perfect inference and 0.5 is for a
random inference. We repeated the cross-validation experiment
ﬁve times and computed the average of the AUC scores over the
ﬁve cross-validation folds. The parameters involved in the meth-
ods were optimized with the AUC score as the objective
function.

Table 2 shows the resulting AUC scores and their standard
deviations. Among the eight ﬁngerprints, the PubChem ﬁnger-
print achieved the highest AUC scores in some conditions. The
AUC scores of the diff-common feature vector were slightly
higher than those of the diff-only feature vector in both
LlSVM and L2SVM. This result implies that it is important to
take into account not only substructure transformation patterns
but also common substructures in the reaction prediction.
LlSVM and L2SVM outperformed BASELINE, which suggests
that supervised learning with the proposed feature vectors is
meaningful.

LlSVM has a strong advantage over L2SVM in terms of high
interpretability of features. Although the AUC scores of LlSVM
are comparable or slightly worse than those of L2SVM, the
number of features with non-zero weights in LlSVM is signiﬁ-
cantly smaller than that in L2SVM owing to sparsity constraints.
Figure 2 shows a comparison of the number of extracted features
between LlSVM and L2SVM in the case of using the PubChem
ﬁngerprint, where ALL means the number of all elements in the
feature vectors. It was observed that LlSVM extracted a limited
number of features, compared with L2SVM. This allows mean-
ingful analysis of the extracted features for biological interpret-
ation, which is shown in Section 4.4.

methods

The AUC scores of BASELINE were fairly high, regardless of
ﬁngerprints (except E-state ﬁngerprint, probably owing to the
small dimensions compared with other seven ﬁngerprints),
which validated the fact that a core substructure is shared be-
tween a substrate compound and a product compound in a react-
ant pair. Another explanation about the high AUC scores of
BASELINE is that negative examples (all possible compound
pairs except for reactant pairs in the gold standard data) include
many structurally dissimilar compound pairs. As most of such
compounds are unlikely to be converted to each other in a reac-
tion, BASELINE (a standard similarity-based method) can
easily classify them into negative class. To avoid such trivial
predictions, we removed compound pairs whose Tanimoto coef-
ﬁcient (J accard coefﬁcient) is less than 0.5 from the gold stand-
ard data and constructed a ﬁltered dataset consisting of
compound pairs whose structures are similar to some extent.
Classiﬁcation is more difﬁcult for the ﬁltered data. We per-
formed the same cross-validation experiment on the ﬁltered
data, and the AUC scores are shown in Table 3. The result
shows that the proposed method clearly outperforms the
BASELINE method.

pound—compound pairs in the test set. (v) Finally, we evaluated
the prediction accuracy over the known reactant pairs. We re-
peated the above steps on each of the 134 metabolic pathway
maps in KEGG pathway.

Figure 3 shows the resulting AUC scores by the pathway-
based cross-validation, where the left panel is the result of
using the diff-common feature vector and the right panel is the
result of using the diff-only feature vector. Each point in the
panels corresponds to the result of each pathway map, where
each pathway map belongs to one of the 11 pathway categories.
The AUC scores tend to be lower than those in the 5-fold cross-
validation for all known reactant pairs (in Section 4.1), which
implies that pathway reconstruction is a more difﬁcult problem.
For example, metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides involve
pathways speciﬁc to a limited group of organisms. Removal of
such pathways from the training set results in low predictive
performance, indicating the difﬁculty to model exotic metabol-
ism in newly found organisms. Additionally, although diff-only
feature vector resulted in lower AUC scores than diff-common
feature vector in the 5-fold cross-validation, diff-only feature
vector performed slightly better than diff-common feature
vector in some pathway maps including those in carbohydrate
metabolism and lipid metabolism and so forth. One explanation
is that, because compounds in the same pathway tends to be
structurally similar to each other, removal of all compounds in
the target pathway from the training set may sometimes lose the
effectiveness of the common feature vector in the training set for
the pathway-based cross-validation, and differential feature

vector becomes relatively important. Nevertheless, it was shown
that the proposed method worked well to some extent even when
all reactions in a pathway map are not known. There was no
signiﬁcant difference between different pathway categories or
between different feature vectors. These results suggest the use-
fulness of the proposed method not only for ﬁlling in the reaction
gaps among existing pathways but also for de novo reconstruc-
tion of a series of reactions.

4.3 Interpretation of the chemical transformation patterns

In a reaction, some substructures are formed, whereas other sub-
structures are eliminated. Here, we examined the importance of
such chemical substructure transformations according to the
weights learned by the L1SVM method. We focused on the sub-
structure components in the PubChem ﬁngerprint, removing the
components that do not represent substructures (those in

Hierarchic Element Counts and in Extended Smallest Set of
Smallest Rings set).

Figure 4 is a network representation of such chemical sub-
structure transformations with positive weights that contributed
to estimate the enzyme-reaction likeness. In Figure 4, nodes rep-
resent the substructure components, the node size is proportional
to the weight and edges represent the top 100 co-occurring
(one formed and one eliminated) substructures. For example,
the substructure with the highest contribution was labeled as
‘C(~H)(~O)(~O)’, meaning a carbon atom attaching with a
hydrogen atom and two oxygen atoms, which includes (hemi)-
acetal group, (hemi)ketal group, carboxyl group, O-formyl group
and so forth. This substructure is connected with the substruc-
tures labeled as ‘C(~C)(~O)’, including hydroxy group, alde-
hyde group and so forth. The connection between these two
includes frequently occurring transformations ‘aldehyde
<=>hemiacetal’ and so forth. This substructure transformation
network is useful when interpreting the frequently occurring

chemical transformations. Nevertheless, many ﬁngerprints
including PubChem put some distinctive functional groups in
the same ﬁngerprint component (such as the one labeled as
‘C(~H)(~O)(~O)’). This may lead to the ﬂexibility of the pre-
diction, but at the same time to the increase of false positives.
Additionally, it is not possible to deal with the chemical trans-
formations that cannot be described in the existing ﬁngerprints.
A more suitable ﬁngerprint would be needed for improving the
reliability of the de novo metabolic pathway reconstruction in the
future work. A possible solution would be to include a number of
different levels of substructure (or functional group)
classiﬁcation.

4.4 Newly predicted reactions and chemical
transformations

Having conﬁrmed the usefulness of our method, we conducted a
comprehensive reaction prediction for all possible compound
pairs. We trained a predictive model using all known reactant
pairs in the gold standard data. We then predicted potential re-
actions for 246397942 compound—compound pairs involving
15 698 compounds in KEGG LIGAND (13 564 known reactant
pairs are excluded). All the prediction results can be obtained
from the supplemental materials from http://web.kuicr.kyoto-u.

Fig. 6. Examples of the predicted pairs taken from Figure 5. The chemical transformation patterns in pairs (A—C) are already known and described in
KEGG reactant pairs (Note that these reactions are not known, but the transformation patterns are known), whereas pairs (D—I) have unknown
patterns. (A) C-C bond accompanied with secondary alcohol group is degraded and forms an aldehyde group, which is a reaction typically found in EC
sub-subclass 4.1.2 (aldehyde-lyases). (B) C-S bond in disulﬁde bond is degraded and forms an S-mercapto group, which is found in EC sub-subclass 4.4.1
(carbon-sulfur lyases). (C) This chemical transformation pattern is found in many reactions in EC 2.4.1 (glycosyltransferases) and EC 3.2.1 (glycosi—
dases). (D) This pattern is not found in known reactions. At the ﬁrst sight, this pair may look like two steps of methylation/demethylation (EC 2.1.1) or
intramolecular transfer of a methyl group (part of EC 5.4). With closer investigations of Isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis pathway (map00950, which
these compounds belong to), it looks more natural to occur the two steps of metylenedioxy ring formation/cleavage (EC 1.14.21 or 1.21.3) because some
metylenedioxy ring formation reactions are known to take place in this pathway. However, in any case, methylation and metylenedioxy ring formation
occurs in the context of biosynthesis, whereas demethylation and metylenedioxy ring cleavage occurs in the context of biodegradation. In that sense, this
compound—compound pair may be an example of false positives when taking account of the reaction ﬂow in the pathway level. (E) This compound—
compound pair may look intramolecular transfer of a hydroxy group, which is typically found in EC 5.4.4 (hydroxymutases), but the transfer of hydroxy
group from a position to another in an aromatic ring is not found in any known reactions stored in KEGG. This pair may be another example of false
positives because the substitution of hydroxy group in aromatic ring is much harder to occur than the addition of hydroxy group. It is known that some
anaerobic bacteria have 4-hydroxybenzoyl—CoA reductase (EC 1.3.7.9) that catalyzes the substitution of hydroxy group in aromatic ring. However, we
assume it would be hard to catalyze intramolecular transfer of hydroxy group in substituted aromatic ring. (F) Although there are many varieties of
hydroxylases (part of EC 1.14), there is no known pattern to produce hydroxyl amine from amide group. (G) For this reaction to occur, there need to be
more than one reaction steps, and an important step would be similar to EC 4.1.2 (aldehyde-lyases). (H) There are similar EC 2.3.3 (acyl transferases)
reactions in polyketide synthesis. (I) Some of EC 1.2.3 (oxidases) catalyze similar reactions

same task is not feasible by other reaction-ﬁlling framework
methods because of their methodological limitation (Kotera
et al., 2008; Tanaka et al., 2009). The compound—ﬁlling frame-
work methods (Gao et al., 2011; Moriya et al., 2010) needed tens
of seconds per compound (corresponding to thousands of hours
for all possible compound pairs).

We examined the newly generated reaction network in detail
(Figs 5 and 6). Among the predicted pairs connected with exist-
ing pathways, some pairs formed triangles with existing path-
ways (e.g. pair B in Fig. 5), meaning that some predicted pairs
may represent two- or more-step reactions. With the closer look
at the chemical structures (Fig. 6), it was also assumed that some
pairs (D, E, G and H) would be possibly converted in more than
one reaction steps. Some pairs were found to have the same
chemical transformations as those in known reactions (e. g.
pairs A, B and C), which looks reasonable to occurr. Among
those without known chemical transformations (e. g. pairs D, E,
F, G, H, I), it would be safe to say some pairs (e.g. pairs D, E
and F) are false positives, and it would not be for other pairs (e. g.
pairs G, H and I). It was found that using chemical ﬁngerprints
can easily produce chemically unrealistic false predictions, which
can possibly be ﬁltered out using graph isomorphism. The effect-
ive integration of the speed of the ﬁngerprints and the accuracy
of the graph isomorphism would be one of the important future
developments.

We further investigated the distribution of possible Enzyme
Commission (EC) numbers for the predicted reactions, and it
was clearly shown that the distribution of predicted reactions is
different from that of known reactions, and diff-common and
diff-only feature vectors favor different molecules or reactions
(see Supplementary Material). For example, diff-common fea-
ture vector found compound—compound pairs that are possibly
catalyzed by EC3, and diff-only feature vector found those by
EC4. It is supposed that this bias is partly due to the given
compound sets and partly due to the reaction types that the
proposed method can deal with. We assume that the former is
the main reason of the bias in the new prediction because the re-
assignment experiments did not show signiﬁcant difference from
the original EC classiﬁcations compared with new predictions.

As described earlier in the text, our method based on super-
vised reaction-ﬁlling framework has the potential to suggest pos-
sible reactions among large number of known chemical
compounds not only with known chemical transformation pat-
terns but also with unknown transformation patterns. Reaction
reversibility is not considered in this study. One reason is that
only small numbers of enzymatic reactions are known irrevers-
ible in vitro, and the direction of the reactions in viva may change
according to the context in pathways and conditions. The other
reason is, more importantly, the purpose of this study is gener-
ating the pathways that can be used as a template for modeling
metabolic ﬂux. Testing the generated pathways with metabolic
ﬂux analysis is an interesting and unavoidable future direction of
this study.

5 CONCLUSION

We presented a novel de novo metabolic pathway reconstruction
method in the reaction-ﬁlling framework. The proposed method
does not require manually predeﬁned rules, i.e. it automatically

learns a statistical model to predict enzymatic reaction likeness
for any compound pairs based on all possible existing know-
ledge. This method can deal with any compounds (even if they
are not found in KEGG) as long as they are represented in
chemical ﬁngerprints.

An advantage of our method lies in ﬁnding potential reactions
among many compounds at a time. The previous study (Kotera
et al., 2008) used graph isomorphism, which contributed to the
accuracy of the method but took much more calculation time.
The current study used ﬁngerprints (instead of graph isomorph-
ism) to improve calculation time and deal with vast amount of
compounds. For more accurate prediction, we are going to de-
velop the two-step prediction, where ﬁngerprints are applied to
ﬁlter out vast amount of negative pairs in the ﬁrst step, and
graph isomorphism is applied to reﬁne the predicted pairs in
the second step.

In principle, our method (i.e. reaction-ﬁlling framework) is
insufﬁcient to correctly predict a multi-step pathway, which
can be better dealt with the other framework (i.e. compound-
ﬁlling framework). This does not imply which framework is su-
perior; these two frameworks can complement each other for
more successful de novo metabolic pathway reconstruction. We
assume the proposed study is an important preliminary step
toward the hybrid framework.

Further improvement of the de novo metabolic pathway recon-
struction method would enable the on—demand integration of
reaction network and gene (or protein) networks derived from
metabolome and other omics, e.g. genome, transcriptome and
proteome.

Abstract

Motivation: Protein phosphorylation is a post-translational modification that underlines various as-
pects of cellular signaling. A key step to reconstructing signaling networks involves identification
of the set of all kinases and their substrates. Experimental characterization of kinase substrates is
both expensive and time-consuming. To expedite the discovery of novel substrates, computational
approaches based on kinase recognition sequence (motifs) from known substrates, protein struc-
ture, interaction and co-localization have been proposed. However, rarely do these methods take
into account the dynamic responses of signaling cascades measured from in vivo cellular systems.
Given that recent advances in mass spectrometry-based technologies make it possible to quantify
phosphorylation on a proteome-wide scale, computational approaches that can integrate static fea-
tures with dynamic phosphoproteome data would greatly facilitate the prediction of biologically
relevant kinase-specific substrates.

Results: Here, we propose a positive-unlabeled ensemble learning approach that integrates
dynamic phosphoproteomics data with static kinase recognition motifs to predict novel substrates
for kinases of interest. We extended a positive-unlabeled learning technique for an ensemble
model, which significantly improves prediction sensitivity on novel substrates of kinases while re-
taining high specificity. We evaluated the performance of the proposed model using simulation
studies and subsequently applied it to predict novel substrates of key kinases relevant to insulin
signaling. Our analyses show that static sequence motifs and dynamic phosphoproteomics data
are complementary and that the proposed integrated model performs better than methods relying
only on static information for accurate prediction of kinase-specific substrates.

Positive-unlabeled ensemble learning for kinase substrate prediction 253

 

1 Introduction

Phosphorylation is an essential protein post-translational modifica-
tion characterized by the precise and reversible addition of a phos-
phate group, by proteins called ‘kinases’, to their targets, called
‘substrates’ (Hunter, 1995). The signaling networks established by
protein phosphorylation govern numerous cellular functions such as
metabolic homeostasis, cell proliferation, survival and apoptosis
(Lemmon and Schlessinger, 2010), and the identification of sub-
strates often reveals new mechanisms by which the cell regulates
these processes. The identification of new kinase substrates (i.e. the
phosphorylation site on a given protein) is therefore of great biolo-
gical interest.

Experimental validation of kinase substrates is an expensive and
time-consuming process and must therefore be prioritized and per-
formed for only a limited number of candidates. To select appropri-
ate candidates for experimental characterization, in silico
approaches are widely used to predict candidate substrates of a kin-
ase or family of kinases of interest. To this end, a number of compu-
tational approaches have been developed for de novo substrate
prediction (Miller and Blom, 2009). These range from simple motif-
based approaches to sophisticated machine learning algorithms. A
list of available methods is reviewed and categorized by Trost and
Kusalik (2011) according to the techniques employed for substrate
prediction. For example, methods based on sequence motif either
contain precompiled regular expression patterns (Amanchy et al.,
2007) or rely on calculating position-specific scoring matrices
(PSSMs) (Obenauer et al., 2003; Yaffe et al., 2001) from known kin-
ase substrates extracted from the literature or in vitro experiments.
While motif-based methods are able to sensitively identify substrates
that have a similar sequence composition to those used to compile
the motif (Miller et al., 2008), they generally extend poorly to more
diverse substrates. As increasingly more phosphorylation sites are
deposited in public databases such as Phospho.ELM (Dinkel et al.,
2011) and PhosphoSitePlus (Hornbeck et al., 2011), machine learn-
ing approaches that generalize well to diverse substrates are becom-
ing increasingly necessary. In this category, methods differ in the
learning algorithms that have been employed for modeling (Dang
et al., 2008; Kim et al., 2004; Trost and Kusalik, 2013; Wong et al.,
2007; Xue et al., 2008), the amount of sequence information utilized
(Gao et al., 2010; Xue et al., 2010) and the integration of additional
information such as protein structure (Hjerrild et al., 2004), colocal-
ization (Linding et al., 2007) or interaction (Horn et al., 2014; Song
et al., 2012). While these ‘static’ features (e.g. protein sequence,
structure, co-localization and interaction) are informative, methods
based on ‘static’ features do not account for the dynamic spatio-
temporal kinetics that may help accurately define the architecture of
cell signaling networks.

Recent advances in liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry
has enabled high-throughput protein phosphorylation profiling in
time course studies (Choudhary and Mann, 2010; Sabido et al.,
2012). Coupled with labeling techniques such as isobaric tagging (e.g.
TMT) (Erickson et al., 2014) or stable isotope labeling with amino
acids in cell culture (e.g. SILAC) (Olsen et al., 2006) and increasingly
label-free-based approaches (Humphrey et al., 2015; Oliveira et al.,
2015), tens of thousands of phosphorylation sites can be identified
and quantified with high precision on a proteome-wide scale (Olsen
and Mann, 2013). Computational approaches that integrate static
features with dynamic phosphoproteome will enable kinase-specific
substrate prediction in the context of dynamic cellular systems.

Here, we propose a positive-unlabeled ensemble learning algo-
rithm to integrate kinase recognition motifs with dynamic

phosphoproteomics data to predict novel substrates of relevant kin-
ases of interest. Extending on our previous model (Humphrey et al.,
2013), the proposed algorithm addresses several key computational
challenges faced in model training when using phosphoproteomics
data by using a positive-unlabeled learning technique for an ensem-
ble classification algorithm. First, the class distribution of the phos-
phoproteomics data is highly imbalanced due to the fact that
experimentally verified substrates are sparse, resulting in vastly
more negative training instances compared with positive instances.
We address this by using repeated sampling from the phosphopro-
teomics data and creating an ensemble of classifiers each trained on
a balanced training subset. Second, the model training requires a set
of negative instances to be provided. However, defining a true nega-
tive set is difficult because unannotated phosphorylation sites com-
prise a mix of negative and unidentified positive substrates. To
overcome this problem, a positive-unlabeled learning procedure is
implemented in the ensemble model for improving prediction sensi-
tivity while retaining specificity by correcting for the prediction bias.
We studied the behavior of the proposed positive-unlabeled ensem-
ble approach using simulation on synthetic datasets and subse-
quently applied it to predict substrates of kinases Akt and mTOR
(mammalian target of rapamycin) using a time-course phosphoryl-
ation dataset generated from insulin-stimulated profiling of cultured
adipocytes. Our results indicate that the proposed approach is
highly accurate, based on an array of evaluation metrics, and is able
to take advantage of both static information from amino acid se-
quences as well as dynamic information from phosphoproteomic
data to predict kinase substrates.

2 Methods

Because the number of experimentally verified kinase substrates
(positive set) are often very small compared with the complete set of
phosphorylation sites profiled (unannotated set), our learning model
(Fig. 1) relies on repeated sampling from the unannotated set and
combines each sampling set with the positive set to create balanced
subsets (Section 2.2). The base classifiers of support vector machines
(SVMs) (Section 2.1) are subsequently trained using these balanced
subsets with both static features, extracted from peptide sequences
and dynamic features, extracted from phosphoproteomics data
(Section 2.4). In addition, since the unannotated set comprises both
true negatives and unidentified positives, a positive-unlabeled learn-
ing procedure that uses a correction factor estimated from the repar-
titioned data (Section 2.3) is applied for each base classifier to

correct for prediction bias. These corrected base classifiers are then
integrated to form the ensemble of SVMs, and the final predictions
are made based on the combined probability from all base
classifiers.

2.1 Base classifier

Let x,- (i = 1, ..., n) denote phosphorylation sites and let y,- E {—1, 1}
be a binary label indicating whether x,- is a substrate (31,-: 1) of a kin-
ase or not (y,- = —1). We use SVM, implemented by Chang and Lin
(2011), to form the bases of an ensemble classifier. In dual formula-
tion, an SVM is expressed as

n 1 n n
maXaL(°€) = :00 — EZZYiYiaia/‘k(xiaxi)
i=1

i=1 i=1

subject to : Zyicx, = 0, 0 S (x,- S C,
i=1

where (x,- are Lagrange multipliers and x,- for which or,- > 0 are sup-
port vectors. The parameter C controls the fraction of support vec-
tors, and the kernel of the classifier is defined by k(x,-,x,-).
Specifically, we use nonlinear classifiers with radial basis function
kernels, which is expressed as

1 2
kEBFW’xi) = eXP(— ; llxz‘ — xi'll ),

where o is a parameter that controls the width of the radial basis
function. When data are linearly inseparable, using SVMs
with nonlinear kernel functions can provide better classifica-
tion accuracy while also retaining the robustness of linear classi-
fiers on background noise. The default parameters were used in
this study where C = 1 and 0 equals to the feature dimension of the
data.

2.2 Ensemble model

Kinase substrate prediction can be formulated as constructing a
model f (x), such that f = p(y = 1|x) approximates the truth.
For most kinases, often there are only a handful of experimentally
validated substrates. We denote them as x E P, where P is the set
of validated substrates and hence positive. After excluding these
positive substrates, the number of remaining phosphorylation
sites (denoted by set U) profiled from a large-scale phosphoproteo-
mics studies can easily exceed several thousand. This makes the
prediction of kinase substrates from phosphoproteomics data an
inherent class imbalanced learning problem, because the number
of positive instances are significantly outnumbered by the rest of
the profiled but as yet unannotated phosphorylation sites (P < U).
Many popular classification algorithms, including SVMs that were
used as the base classifiers of the ensemble, are sensitive to the
imbalanced class distribution and would perform poorly without
correction of the class distribution of the training instances (Tang
et al., 2009).

An effective approach to address this class imbalance is to create
an ensemble classifier by sampling from the original dataset and cre-
ating base classifiers, each trained on a balanced subset (Yang et al.,
2014). This strategy can be modified for solving the imbalanced
class problem in our phosphoproteomics application by randomly
sampling from U and combining them with members of P to form
balanced subsets (U1 U P, U2 U P, ..., U, U P), where r is the number
of sampling operations performed. These subsets can then be used to

train the base classifiers from which the ensemble is obtained for
prediction:

1 1'
20% = we = 72m = 1|x; Uz- UP)
i=1

The above prediction is an estimate of the combined probability pE of
a given phosphorylation site x to be a positive substrate of a kinase.

2.3 Positive-unlabeled learning in ensemble

One complication in applying the ensemble model described above
is that U is an unannotated set that comprises a mixture of unidenti-
fied substrates of a given kinase as well as negatives. This is known
as the positive-unlabeled learning problem where only a small set of
positive instances are known, while the rest of the data contains
both positive and negative instances but are unlabeled (Letouzey
et al., 2000). The ensemble model described above makes a naive as-
sumption by treating all members of U (that is, x §Z P) as negative in-
stances for sampling and training the base classifiers. The model
would therefore predict conservatively and may penalize heavily on
novel substrates because they may be selected as negative instances
in model training. This is undesirable since our goal is precisely to
discover from U the set of novel substrates.

It has been shown that by multiplying a correction factor, esti-
mated from a data repartitioned approach, one can correct for the
prediction bias on the unannotated set (Elkan and Noto, 2008). Here,
we extend this positive-unlabeled learning technique for our ensemble
classifier by estimating the correction factors for individual base clas-
sifiers and subsequently correcting their prediction bias in ensemble
classification. Let s = 1 if the instance x is labeled, and s =—1 other-
wise. Since only experimentally validated substrates are labeled, y = 1
is certain when s: 1, whereas y could be 1 or —1 when s=—1.
Therefore, by treating all labeled instances as positive and all un-
labeled ones as negative, we are in fact learning g(x) = p(s = 1|x)
and using this as approximation to p(y =  Elkan and Noto
(2008) have mathematically proved that p(y = 1|x) = p(s = 1|x)/c,
where c = p(s = 1|y = 1) and by reserving a subset of validation data
from the training data the value of c can be estimated as

1
szep>ig<x>7

where P* is a set of labeled instances in the validation dataset and m

c:

is the cardinality of P*.

For our ensemble classifier, we have, for each base classifier,
g,- = p(s = 1|x; U,- U P), (i = 1, ..., 1'). Therefore, a correction fac-
tor can be estimated by reserving a validation dataset for each base
classifier g,(x) and ensemble model with prediction correction can
then be expressed as

1 1'
2050 = 1Ix) = 72206 = 1|x; U,- UP)/c,-
i=1

The corrected and combined probability pf is the estimation of x
being a positive substrate of a given kinase.

2.4 Static and dynamic feature extraction from
phosphoproteomics data

We demonstrate the proposed approach on a previously published
phosphoproteomics dataset where insulin stimulation of 3T3-L1
adipocytes was performed to quantify the insulin signaling

phosphoproteome in adipocyte cells (Humphrey et al., 2013). The
phosphopeptides were quantified in biological triplicates and
included a serum-starved (‘basal’) control and a time-course of insu-
lin treatment (at 15 s, 30 s, 1 min, 2 min, 5 min, 10 min, 20 min and
60 min), as well as cells treated with or without PI3K/mTOR or Akt
inhibitors (LY294002 and MK2206, respectively) applied for
30 min prior to a 20-min insulin treatment. Data were filtered to se-
lect phosphorylation sites that are quantified in at least one of the
three biological replicates in each time point and the basal condi-
tion. This resulted in 12 289 phosphorylation sites.

For each kinase of interest, a positive training set of annotated
substrates was curated from a combination of PhosphoSitePlus
(Hornbeck et al., 201 1) database and manual extraction from litera-
ture. Next, the PSSM was calculated for each kinase of interest using
the six amino acids flanking the actual phosphorylation site (total
length: 13) of its annotated substrates as

1 l
M124": 7210127 = k),
i=1

where l is the number of annotated substrates, 7' is the sequence win-
dow size and k is the set of 20 amino acids. All identified phosphor-
ylation sites are then scored against Mk) to determine their
similarity to the annotated substrates.

For dynamic features from phosphoproteome profiling, we cal-
culate, for each phosphorylation site, the log 2-fold change at each
time point compared with basal control and the log 2-fold change
before and after inhibitor treatments. In addition, we extracted
several secondary features for each phosphorylation site from its
temporal pattern. These include the mathematical mean of the
log 2-fold change at each time point compared with basal control,
the area under the temporal profile calculated as follows:

1 1'
Area 2 5200—1 + D’i),
i=1

and the goodness of a polynomial (degree of two) curve fit measured
by F—test as follows:

260' — 7)2

i=1
F=—,

where t is the number of time points, y,- is the standardized log 2-
fold change at time point i, )7,- is the fitted value of y,- and a,- is the
unfitted residuals from the model at time point i.

2.5 Performance evaluation and comparison

To compare the performance of our models and other commonly
used kinase-specific substrate prediction tools, we used an array of
evaluation metrics including sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), F1
score, geometric mean (GM) and Matthews correlation coefficient
(MCC) defined as follows:

TP TN

 

S€=TP+FN’ Sp:FP+TN’
2TP TP TP
F1=2TP+FP+FN’ GM: TP+FNXTP+FP’
MCCZ TPxTN—FPXFN

\/(TP + FP) x (TP + FN) x (TN + FP) x (TN + FN)’

where TP, TN, FF and FN denote the number of true positives, true
negatives, false positives and false negatives, respectively.

Beside using metrics defined above for evaluating a single classi-
fication threshold, we also generated Precision/Recall curves to
evaluate the performance of the model trained using both motif and
phosphoproteomics data and those trained using only motif or phos-
phoproteomics data across a range of threshold by varying the clas-
sification cutoff c as follows:

. . TP(c) TP(c)
Prec151on(c) 2W; Recall(c) 2W.

Methods with predefined prediction thresholds that cannot be
adjusted to an arbitrary cutoff are represented as single points in the
Precision/Recall comparison plot.

In the simulation study, we repeatedly generated 10 simulation
datasets and for each dataset we trained and compared the predic-
tion accuracy of a single SVM model, an uncorrected ensemble mod-
el and a corrected ensemble model using the evaluation metrics
described above. To evaluate the individual contributions of the
‘static’ motif information and the dynamic phosphoproteome infor-
mation, we created partial models using either motif or phosphopro-
teomics data and compared these with the model trained with both
using the dynamic phosphoproteomics data. In addition, we also
compared the performance of our approach with other commonly
used kinase-specific substrate prediction tools including GPS 3.0
(Xue et al., 2008), iGPS 1.0 (Song et al., 2012), KinasePhos 1.0
(Huang et al., 2005), KinasePhos 2.0 (Wong et al., 2007), NetPhosK
1.0 (Hjerrild et al., 2004) and NetworKIN 3.0 (Horn et al., 2014).
We used the default/suggested parameters for each prediction tool.
Specifically, the prediction specificity of HMM is set to 0.9 for
KinasePhos 1.0, the prediction specificity of SVM is set to 0.8 for
KinasePhos 2.0, the minimum score of 2.0 and the max difference of
4.0 is set for NetworKIN 3.0, the prediction threshold is set to 0.5
for NetPhosK 1.0, high for GPS 3.0 and high for iGPS 1.0. For cal-
culating sensitivity, the annotated substrates were treated as positive
instances, and leave-one-out cross-validation was used for our
model evaluation. For calculating specificity, since we do not know
the set of true negative phosphorylation sites, we assumed that only
a very small fraction of phosphorylation sites in the unlabeled set of
U are positive instances with most of them being negative instances.
On the basis of this assumption, we randomly sampled five sets of
phosphorylation sites from all profiled phosphorylation sites,
excluding annotated substrates of Akt and mTOR and evaluated
each method on each of the five negative sets. The performance of
each method is reported as the mean plus and minus the standard
deviation.

3 Results

3.1 Evaluation of positive-unlabeled ensemble

learning on synthetic data

We generated synthetic datasets to analyze the behavior of different
classification models in classifying data with highly imbalanced class
distribution and with positive and unlabeled instances. Figure 2a
shows a typical example where a synthetic dataset is simulated with
10 positive instances (red points) with two features both generated
from a Gaussian distribution N(6.5, 1) and 10500 unlabeled in-
stances, of which 500 are unannotated positive instances (dark blue
points) and the remaining 10 000 are negative instances (cyan
points) generated from a Gaussian distribution N (4.5, 1). In this ex-
ample, a single SVM would predict every instance, including the 10
positives, as a negative (purple region in Fig. 2b). This is because the
negative class is significantly over-represented in the training data.

In comparison, an ensemble model without positive-unlabeled learn-
ing correction is able to correctly classify 10 positive instances as
well as a large proportion of unlabeled positive instances (orange in
Fig. 2c). By applying positive-unlabeled learning correction for the
base classifiers, an ensemble model is able to correctly classify even
more unlabeled positive instances (orange in Fig. 2d)

To verify if corrected ensemble models (by positive-unlabeled
learning) perform consistently better than the single SVMs or the
uncorrected ensemble models, we repeated the above simulation
10 times, creating 10 synthetic datasets and evaluated each model
based on multiple performance metrics. As listed in Table 1, single
SVMs always predict all instances as negatives. When it comes to en-
semble models with and without positive-unlabeled learning correc-
tion, corrected ensemble models significantly improve prediction
sensitivities compared with uncorrected ensemble models while
retaining comparable specificities. The overall performance of cor-
rected ensemble models is also better than uncorrected ensemble
models according to F1 score, GM or MCC.

3.2 Application of positive-unlabeled ensemble learning
on insulin-activated phosphoproteome

We demonstrate the application of the proposed method using the
mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics data generated from

insulin-activated time-series studies of 3T3-L1 adipocyte cells
(Humphrey et al., 2013).

3.2.1 Kinase selection and feature extraction
Before applying the proposed approach for kinase-specific substrate
prediction, we need to determine kinases that are of interest and

shade of color corresponds to a cluster index

relevant to insulin-activated phosphoproteomics data. Typically,
kinases that are activated or inhibited in the context of the experi-
ment performed are of particular interest. Since many substrates of a
given kinase have similar temporal kinetics, clustering phosphoryl-
ation sites into distinct clusters and testing for enrichment of known
substrates of each kinase (obtained from an annotation database
such as PhosphoSitePlus) (Hornbeck et al., 2011) can facilitate the
identification of kinases that are perturbed during the time course
and/or by the treatments in the phosphoproteomics experiments. To
this end, we filtered the set of all phosphorylation sites by selecting
only those that have an associated gene product and are differen-
tially phosphorylated in at least one of the eight time points profiled,
as determined using a moderated t—test (Gentleman et al., 2005)
(FDR < 0.05). This resulted in 3178 regulated phosphorylation sites.
We then applied knowledge-based cluster evaluation (CLUE) (Yang
et al., 2015) to determine the optimal clustering of the phosphoryl-
ation sites and identified kinases whose substrates are enriched
within each cluster. Using CLUE, we identified four clusters en-
riched with known substrates of a set of kinases (Fig. 3a). Notably,
Akt and mTOR substrates are the most highly enriched (Fig. 3b)
based on Fisher’s exact test. We therefore selected Akt and mTOR
as kinases of interest for substrate prediction.

After selecting Akt and mTOR as kinases of interest, we used a
combination of manual curation and database extraction to compile
lists of annotated substrates for the Akt and mTOR kinases. We
found a total of 22 and 26 substrates for Akt and mTOR, respect-
ively, and used these as positive instances for model training in sub-
sequent analyses (Supplementary Table Sl). We next constructed

PSSMs using sequence recognition sites of the known Akt and

mation for the known Akt and mTOR substrates from the phospho-
protoemics data (Fig. 4b—d). Boxplots of the log 2-fold change of
insulin stimulation versus basal control across the eight time points in-
dicate that Akt substrates responded to insulin activation significantly
faster than those of mTOR (Fig. 4b). This is confirmed by calculation
of the area under the curve (see Section 2.4), where Akt substrates gen-
erally have very large values (Fig. 4c). This temporal latency is in
agreement with the known cellular topology of the insulin signaling
network in which Akt is proximal to the insulin receptor and is rapidly
activated by multisite phosphorylation (Humphrey and James, 2012),
while mTORC1 is downstream of Akt and relies on the multiple dis-
crete steps including the phosphorylation of TSC2 by Akt, ultimately
leading to the activation of the kinase (Laplante and Sabatini, 2012).
Interestingly, the area under the curve values for mTOR substrates ap-
pears to be bimodal suggesting a subset of mTOR substrates may re-
spond to insulin activation more slowly than the others (Fig. 4c). This
is consistent with the enrichment analysis (Fig. 3) where mTOR is

slower cluster (cluster 2). Figure 4d shows the log 2-fold change of
phosphorylation level in insulin stimulation with and without prior
treatment of inhibitors. The phosphorylation levels of both Akt and
mTOR substrates appear to be inhibited by both LY and MK inhibi-
tors although to different degrees.

3.2.2 Determining effective ensemble size

A key parameter in designing an effective ensemble of classifiers is
the number of base classifiers used for creating the final ensemble
model (‘ensemble size’). We tested a range of ensemble sizes for pre-
dicting Akt and mTOR substrates, respectively, and calculated the
correlation of prediction scores for all phosphorylation sites. This
procedure was repeated 10 times to obtain the variance introduced
by using a positive-unlabeled ensemble model with a given ensemble
size. As shown in Figure 5, the correlation from each individual pre-
diction increases with the ensemble size and plateaus at size of
around 30. Since ensemble models with smaller size yield more vari-
able predictions while larger size yield more consistent predictions
(Fig. 5), we made a conservative decision to use an ensemble size of
50 for subsequent ensemble models.

3.2.3 Predicting Akt— and mTOR-specific substrates

After extracting learning features and determining the effective ensem-
ble size, we compared the proposed Positive-Unlabeled Ensemble
Learning models that use both motif and phosphoproteome data for
prediction (‘PUEL’) with those that use only the motif (‘-Motif’) or the

88.5%, while for the models trained on only motif or phosphopro-
teome data, this is 80.8%. It is evident that PUEL performs better
across the range of classification thresholds for mTOR and Akt, based
on Precision/Recall curves (Fig. 6a). These results demonstrate the
complementary nature of static sequence motifs and dynamic phos-
phoproteome data in kinase substrate prediction. It is also evident that
PUEL outperforms the ensemble model without positive-unlabeled
learning (‘EL’) (Table 2), which demonstrates a contribution by posi-
tive-unlabeled ensemble learning toward kinase substrate prediction.

To assess the performance of our approach in relation to that of
other approaches, we evaluated substrate prediction accuracy for
Akt and mTOR kinases using six popular kinase substrate predic-
tion tools (Table 2). For Akt substrate prediction, our ensemble ap-
proach achieved the highest sensitivity and specificity. NetworKIN
and NetPhosK 1.0 performed comparably with high specificity but
with relatively low sensitivity. Compared with KinasePhos 2.0,
KinasePhos 1.0 offers good sensitivity but lower specificity. GPS 3.0
has a perfect prediction sensitivity for Akt substrate prediction.
However, this seems to be achieved by sacrificing specificity. iGPS
1.0 improves the specificity compared with GPS 3.0 but at the cost
of sensitivity. For mTOR substrate prediction, GPS 3.0 did not per-
form as well as our approach. Its variant iGPS 1.0 did not predict
any tested phosphorylation sites to be a positive substrate of mTOR.
The pre-trained models used by KinasePhos 1.0/2.0, NetPhosK 1.0
and NetworKIN 3.0 preclude them from making substrates predic-
tions for mTOR. Overall, the positive-unlabeled ensemble model
performed better than other methods in predicting both Akt and
mTOR substrates according to the evaluation metrics (Table 2) as
well as the Precision/Recall curves (Fig. 6a).

Figure 6b shows the prediction scores (z-axis) of Akt and mTOR
substrates, respectively, using the positive-unlabeled ensemble model
with both motif features and phosphoproteome features. The contri-
bution of motif feature and the phosphoproteome features are plot-
ted on x-axis and y-axis. A complementarity pattern of motif score
and phosphoproteome score can be seen in both Akt and mTOR

predictions. These results argue for the utilization and integration of
dynamic features extracted from phosphoproteomics data with trad-

4 Conclusion

In this study, we developed a positive-unlabeled ensemble learning ap-
proach that enables the accurate prediction of kinase-specific substrates
by integrating motif information derived from amino acid sequences
surrounding the phosphorylation recognition sites with dynamic
phosphorylation patterns quantified in large-scale time-series phospho-
proteomics studies. We extended the positive-unlabeled learning tech-
niques for ensemble learning and illustrated how such an application
can improve the prediction sensitivity while retaining high specificity
for kinase-substrate prediction. Finally, we demonstrated the comple-
mentary nature of the static features extracted from sequence motif
and the dynamic features extracted from phosphoproteomics data.
Compared with traditional sequence motif-centric methods, our study
suggests an alternative approach for predicting kinase-specific sub-
strates that incorporates and exploits the wealth of physiological infor-
mation captured by large-scale phosphoproteomics studies.

With the recent development of high-throughput methods prom-
ising to streamline the generation of large-scale phosphoproteomics
data (Humphrey et al., 2015), we anticipate that the methods
described here will become an increasingly valuable approach for
enabling prediction of kinase substrates, while preserving the dy-
namic and cellular context of the biological system being studied.

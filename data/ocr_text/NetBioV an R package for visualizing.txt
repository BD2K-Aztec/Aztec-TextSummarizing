ABSTRACT

Summary: NetBioV (Network Biology Visualization) is an R package
that allows the visualization of large network data in biology and medi-
cine. The purpose of NetBioV is to enable an organized and reprodu-
cible visualization of networks by emphasizing or highlighting specific
structural properties that are of biological relevance.

Availability and implementation: NetBioV is freely available for aca-
demic use. The package has been tested for R 2.14.2 under Linux,
Windows and Mac OS X. It is available from Bioconductor.

1 INTRODUCTION

Modern research in the biological and biomedical sciences is
driven by technological progress that routinely allows
interrogating genetic or molecular entities on a genomic scale.
For the analysis and interpretation of high-throughput genomics
experiments, frequently networks are used because they enable a
systems approach. However, the graphical representation of net-
works for reasons of their exploratory analysis, interpretation or
merely as a visualization is far from being trivial, especially for
large networks containing hundreds or thousands of genes. For
this reason, several software visualization tools have been
developed. In the Supplementary File, we compared our visu-
alization software NetBioV with Cytoscape, VisANT and yEd
(Hu et al., 2013; Shannon et al., 2003). In summary, NetBioV is
fully integrated into R, the gold standard in the computational
biology community, and hence can use all of its functionality for
user-speciﬁc expansions. Furthermore, NetBioV provides (i)
global, (ii) module, (iii) information ﬂow and (iv) hierarchical
layout styles, discussed in the following, not available in this
form in other packages. Importantly, the provided layout styles
run efﬁciently, even for large networks.

2 METHODS

The graphical representation of NetBioV is based on the igraph package
(Csardi and Nepusz, 2006) by using elementary visualization capabilities,
thereof allowing the composition of advanced graph layouts. NetBioV
provides four principle types of layout styles—(i) global, (ii) modular, (iii)
information ﬂow and (iv) hierarchical layouts. These can be used either
separately or combined with each other, in a nested way. The reason for
this conceptual subdivision is that, ﬁrst, networks contain a multitude of
information that cannot be visualized assuming just one speciﬁc perspec-
tive. Second, it is generally acknowledged that biological gene networks
have a hierarchical and modular organizational structure (Barabasi and
Oltvai, 2004). For this reason, selecting a layout from one of the four
main categories allows to highlight a certain biological aspect of a
network.

2.1 Global layout styles

NetBioV provides six different style functions for generating global
layouts: mst.plot, mst.plot.mod, plot.NetworkSphericaZ.startSet, plot.
NetworkSpherical and plot.spiral.graph. The ﬁrst two functions extract,
initially, a minimum spanning tree (MST) from a network and, then, use
a forced-based algorithm (either Fruchterman—Reingold or Kamada—
Kawai) for the MST to generate the coordinates for the nodes. Finally,
all remaining edges are added. In Figure 1A, we show an example using
the mst.plot.mod function. White edges correspond to the MST, all other
edges are in shades of orange and a darker color corresponds to more
distant nodes. Furthermore, the color of the nodes reﬂects the expression
of the genes (blue low, red high). This approach is different to all other
network visualization software because by using an MST in the ﬁrst step
one gains a considerable advantage in the computing time it takes to
calculate the coordinates of the nodes in large networks (for a numerical
comparison see Supplementary File Section S3.l and S45). The function
plot.NetworkHubView provides a hub-view of a network placing the
nodes according to their degree in a circular order, and the remaining
three functions produce a star-, spherical— and spiral-view of a network
(see Supplementary File).

2.2 Modular layout styles

NetBioV offers four different style functions for modular layouts:
splitgmst, plotobstractmodule, plotobstractnodes and plotmodules. All
of these functions require as an input, information about the partitioning
of the nodes in the form of modules. Modules can be identiﬁed either
with module detecting algorithms (included in NetBioV) or from biomed-
ical databases, e.g. from gene ontology (GO). For instance, the func-
tion splitmst expands the global style function mst.plot to the module
level maintaining the same computational advantages using an MST.
The function plotmodules allows the module-wise speciﬁcation of the

layout style representing each module, which means that it is possible to
select a different layout style for each module in a network. The function
plot.abstract.nodes provides an abstraction of a network, representing
each module by a single node, and edges between modules are collapsed
into a single edge. The size of the nodes and edges can be chosen to be
proportional to the total number of nodes in a module and the edges
between modules, respectively (see Fig. 1B). The resulting visualization is
module-centric, and hence allows masking the connectivity on the gene
level.

2.3 Information ﬂow and hierarchical layout styles

An information ﬂow layout style highlights the shortest paths between
two or more modules, or gene sets. The available functions are plot.mod-
ules and level.plot. The available function plot.modules used in Figure 1C
shows the information ﬂow between two modules. In this view, the short-
est path from an initial set of nodes (red) to a destination set of nodes
(yellow) is color highlighted. A large variety of features can be user-
speciﬁed to enhance a desired visualization effect.

Finally, we provide 2 functions (level.plot, level.plot.spread) allowing a
hierarchal representation of networks. These functions assume an initial
node set, N,, and plot their adjacent neighbors (measured by the Dijkstra
distance) of these nodes iteratively on different levels considering the dir-
ectionality of the edges (if available). For a directed network,
‘level.plot.spread’ shows all generations of ancestors and offsprings of N i.

2.4 Interfacing with R and object-oriented structure

For the presented examples in Figure l, we used various R packages for
(i) identifying the modules of the protein—protein interaction (PPI) net-
work and (ii) obtaining information about the enrichment of the modules
for GO terms. Owing to the integration of NetBioV into R, interfacing
with the large package repositories CRAN or Bioconductor is naturally
enabled allowing to use a multitude of different features that may be used
as part of the visualization of the network.

Aside from this, NetBioV has an object-oriented structure allowing to
combine different types of layouts seamlessly with each other. For ex-
ample, it is possible to specify for each module in a network a different
layout style or color scheme. That means, each of the global layout styles
can be used independently as a layout style for a module. Figure 1C
shows an example, where a different edge and node color are chosen
for the two modules and the connecting path. For the visualization of
the activity of genes or proteins, we provide a function that allows to map
the expression levels onto the network by representing activity levels by
different node colors to identify easily, e.g. differentially expressed genes
(see Fig. 1A). Importantly, the ﬁnal output of a plot can be saved as a
vector graphics format (eps or pdf).

3 EXAMPLES

Figure 1 shows three different network visualizations, two for the
PPI network of Arabidopsis thaliana (Breitkreutz et al., 2008)
(Fig. 1A and B) and one for the gene regulatory network of
B-cell lymphoma, inferred with BC3NET (de Matos Simoes
and Emmert—Streib, 2012) (Fig. 1C). Figure 1C can be repro-
duced by the following code. In the Supplementary File, we
provide additional examples.

4 CONCLUSION

NetBioV allows the efﬁcient visualization of large biological net-
works by emphasizing important aspects of biological informa-
tion processing, e.g. modularity, information ﬂow or hierarchy.
The organization of NetBioV is highly ﬂexible enabling indivi-
dualized network visualizations. Part of the functionality of
NetBioV comes from its integration into R to borrow strength
from existing package repositories and to ensure reproducible
research by saving source code for the network visualization
coordinates and parameters.

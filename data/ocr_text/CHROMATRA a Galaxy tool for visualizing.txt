ABSTRACT

Summary: CHROMATRA (CHROmatin Mapping Across
TRAnscripts) is a visualization tool available as plug-in for the
Galaxy platform. It allows detailed yet concise presentations of data
derived from ChlP-chip or ChlP-seq experiments by visualizing
enrichment scores across genes or other genomic features while
accounting for their length and additional characteristics such
as gene expression. It integrates into typical analysis workflows
and enables rapid graphical assessment and comparison of
genome-wide data at a glance.

1 INTRODUCTION

The pace of advancements in DNA microarray (Stoughton, 2005)
and sequencing technology (Shendure and Ji, 2008) continues to
transform biological research. Both techniques complement each
other and provide powerful platforms to interrogate entire genomes
at high resolution, ranging from sequence decoding, to gene
expression proﬁling, to chromatin modiﬁcation mapping (Collas,
2010; Kapranov et al., 2007; Metzker, 2010).

It is in large part due to these technologies that data are
becoming available to scientists and allow questions to be asked of
unprecedented depth. At the same time, however, the increasingly
large volume and complexity of datasets demands adequate
computational methods to analyze and present the data effectively.

While raw numbers may contain all relevant information of
an analysis, they are not always necessarily suitable to convey
biological meaning efﬁciently, especially when presenting data in
scientiﬁc publications. Graphic visualizations of data can aid in
representing complex content and reveal salient information at
a glance (Gehlenborg et al., 2010). Yet, satisfying this claim is
particularly challenging for genome—wide data. For instance, when
mapping chromatin modiﬁcations or transcription factors using
ChIP—chip or ChIP—seq, it is a major goal to assess their localization
and distribution across all genes of an organism while preserving
structural and functional features of their respective genome.

Current approaches for visualizing binding or modiﬁcation
proﬁles can be broadly distinguished into two categories: ﬁrst, tools

of single—gene resolution, like the Genome Browser (Fujita et al.,
2011), offer the most detailed level of data presentation, but make
it difﬁcult to evaluate proﬁles across genes and derive broader
principles as they disperse the information over multiple plots to
cover the genome. Second, averaging approaches try to circumvent
this problem by grouping genes into classes, e.g. based on length,
Gene Ontology terms (Ashburner et al., 2000) or transcription rate
(Mayer et al., 2010; Pokholok et al., 2005) and calculating average
proﬁles for each class. While they succeed in condensing the mosaic
representation of single— gene visualizations, they inevitably sacriﬁce
detail dependent on the applied grouping given the heterogeneity of
genes with respect to their length and other features.

Here, we present CHROMATRA (CHROmatin Mapping Across
TRAnscripts), a visualization tool for genome—wide DNA—protein
binding and chromatin modiﬁcation maps that balances detail and
compactness of the existing visualization approaches. Developed as
a plug—in for the Galaxy analysis environment (Goecks et al., 2010),
CHROMATRA portrays enrichment proﬁles in a comprehensive yet
condensed form by accounting for feature length and additional
characteristics such as gene expression. CHROMATRA plots reveal
the spatial distribution of chromatin marks or binding events
across all genomic features of interest, and may aid in discovering
unexpected correlations and patterns in enrichment proﬁles.

2 FUNCTIONALITY AND WORKFLOW

CHROMATRA is a plug—in for the Galaxy bioinformatics platform
(Goecks et al., 2010). As one of the most comprehensive
analysis solutions for genomics data, Galaxy integrates different
software tools under a uniﬁed user interface with advanced
workﬂow management capabilities (Blankenberg et al., 2007). Since
CHROMATRA was written in Python it easily integrates with
Galaxy, itself implemented in Python, and has no dependencies on
external libraries not already used by Galaxy.

CHROMATRA consists of two visualization modules, which
can be integrated into the analysis workﬂow for ChIP—chip or
ChIP—seq experiments. Typically, the raw data of ChIP experiments
are normalized and enrichment scores calculated and stored in
standardized formats such as WIG BED and GFF for subsequent
analysis. After these steps, CHROMATRA can be linked to the
workﬂow and used to visualize ChIP proﬁles by reading GFF ﬁles
that contain enrichment scores for the whole genome.

The ﬁrst module, CHROMATRA—L, accounts for differences in
lengths of genomic features, such as transcripts, exons or telomeric

elements, and eliminates potential biases in assessing their ChIP
proﬁles that usually arise when using non—absolute length scales.
It does so by sorting the features by length and calculating mean
enrichment values for bins of absolute size according to the user—
speciﬁed settings, for example at nucleosome resolution. Therefore,
the module requires coordinates of genomic features aligned to a
common position, for example coordinates of genes aligned to their
transcription start site (TSS). These coordinates can be uploaded
by the user or readily derived from other Galaxy modules in a tab—
delimited format. The resulting enrichment proﬁles are color—coded
according to user—deﬁned settings and visualized in a heatmap—like
plot, which is available for download in different image formats,
such as PNG, PDF or SVG Figure 1 shows a representative example,
mapping histone variant H2A.Z proﬁles derived from ChIP—chip
experiments across ~4500 transcripts of Saccharomyces cerevisiae
with known TSS and transcription rate.

The second module, CHROMATRA—T, extends the ﬁrst one by
allowing an additional metric, such as transcription rate (Fig. 1B)
or a pre—computed numerical classiﬁcation scheme, e. g. based on
their Gene Ontology term, to be accounted for when visualizing
enrichment proﬁles of genomic features. According to user—deﬁned
intervals/classes for the second metric, CHROMATRA—T ﬁrst
partitions the set of features accordingly and then sorts each group by
length. Enrichment values are subsequently calculated and displayed
as described above. CHROMATRA—T hence allows assessing ChIP
enrichment proﬁles at a glance according to various characteristics
of genomic features and avoids length—dependent biases.

3 CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK

CHROMATRA implements two visualization approaches for
exploring genome—wide chromatin signatures and facilitating
the discovery of unexpected patterns and correlations. The
comprehensive yet compact visualization allows assessing
enrichment proﬁles for data from any organism. The CHROMATRA

modules have proven their effectiveness in a recent study, addressing
the localization and dependencies of chromatin modiﬁcations in the
context of transcription (Schulze et al., 2011). Besides assessing
genes or transcripts, any other genomic feature that can be aligned
according to a common position can be visualized, including
introns and alternative transcripts. Furthermore, data derived
through related techniques, such as MeDIP—seq (J acinto et al.,
2008; Weber et al., 2005) or MBD—seq (Serre et al., 2010), can be
used as input as well. As a plug—in for Galaxy, CHROMATRA easily
integrates into existing workﬂows and enables direct graphical
exploration of genome—wide data.

ABSTRACT

Summary: The inappropriate expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) is
closely related with disease diagnosis, prognosis and therapy
response. Recently, many studies have demonstrated that bioactive
small molecules (or drugs) can regulate miRNA expression, which in-
dicates that targeting miRNAs with small molecules is a new therapy
for human diseases. In this study, we established the SM2miR data-
base, which recorded 2925 relationships between 151 small mol-
ecules and 747 miRNAs in 17 species after manual curation from
nearly 2000 articles. Each entry contains the detailed information
about small molecules, miRNAs and evidences of their relationships,
such as species, miRBase Accession number, DrugBank Accession
number, PubChem Compound Identifier (CID), expression pattern of
miRNA, experimental method, tissues or conditions for detection.
SM2miR database has a user-friendly interface to retrieve by miRNA
or small molecule. In addition, we offered a submission page. Thus,
SM2miR provides a fairly comprehensive repository about the
inﬂuences of small molecules on miRNA expression, which will pro-
mote the development of miRNA therapeutics.

1 INTRODUCTION

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous, single-stranded and
non-coding RNAs, which regulate their target genes at the
post-transcriptional level through inhibiting protein translation
or degrading mRNA (Bartel, 2009). A miRNA can regulate hun-
dreds of genes and plays key roles in many physiological and
pathological processes, such as proliferation, differentiation
and apoptosis (He and Hannon, 2004). The inappropriate ex-
pression of miRNAs is related to many kinds of critical illness,
including cancer, cardiovascular disease, metabolic disease, in-
ﬂammatory disease and so on (Sevignani et al., 2006; van

Rooij et al., 2012). Various evidences are overwhelming that
the abnormal expression of miRNAs is the hallmark of diseases.
For example, Greither et al. (2010) conﬁrmed that miR-155,
miR-210, miR-222 and miR-203 were highly expressed by
qRT-PCR in pancreatic tumor. The expression of let-7 was sig-
niﬁcantly reduced in colon cancer patients compared with that in
adjacent non-cancerous tissue from the same patient (Akao et al.,
2006). In addition, miRNAs have several attractive features to be
druggable, such as the speciﬁc secondary structures and the con-
served sequences. Recently, many studies demonstrated that
small molecules can regulate miRNA expression, which indicates
that targeting miRNAs with small molecules is a new type of
therapy for human diseases (Zhang et al., 2010). For example,
the expression levels of 22 miRNAs were changed after
5-ﬂuorouracil treatment in human colon cell line through
qRT-PCR (Rossi et al., 2007). Rhodes et al. (2012) detected 22
up—regulated miRNAs and 10 down-regulated miRNAs after the
treatment of trichostatin A in human breast cancer cell lines by
microarray. To sum up, speciﬁc miRNA will be treatment target
for majority of diseases. Therefore, the study of how small mol-
ecule drugs inﬂuence the expression levels of miRNAs is very
signiﬁcant.

Hitherto, diverse miRNA-related databases have been con-
structed. For example, miRBase (Grifﬁths-Jones et al., 2008) is
the central online repository of miRNA sequences and annota-
tions. MicroCosm Targets (Grifﬁths-Jones et al., 2008),
TargetScan (Lewis et al., 2005) and TarBase (Sethupathy et al.,
2006) provide the computationally predicted or the experimen-
tally validated target genes for miRNAs. With the progression
of research on the important roles of miRNAs in human dis-
eases, several manually curated databases about the associ-
ations of miRNAs and diseases were developed, such as
phenomiR (Ruepp et al., 2012), HMDD (Lu et al., 2008) and
miR2Disease (Jiang et al., 2009). However, the databases about
how bioactive small molecules inﬂuence the expression levels of
miRNAs are quite rare. The relevant information is scattered
among the massive literatures, which is inconvenient for re-
searchers to explore the relationships between small molecules
and miRNAs. Yang et al. (2011) presented the miREnVironment
database to describe the complex interactions between genetic
factors and environmental factors, where a few small molecules
appeared as environment factors. Thus, this manuscript
described a curated database SM2miR, which offered more com-
prehensive information about the small molecules’ effects on
miRNA expression and ﬁlled the vacancy in this ﬁeld.

2 DATABASE CONTENT

We extracted the associations of small molecules and miRNAs
from PubMed database using the keywords ‘drug and miRNA’,
‘small molecule and miRNA’, ‘drug and miR’ and ‘small mol-
ecule and miR’. Approximately 2000 articles that were published
before March 2012 were obtained. After manual screening, we
got 2925 relationships of small molecules and miRNAs from
nearly 200 articles, which included 151 small molecules and
747 miRNAs in 17 species. To provide more effective informa-
tion about small molecules and miRNAs, a variety of biological
databases were integrated, such as miRBase, US. Food and
Drug Administration (FDA), PubChem and DrugBank. Each
entry contained the detailed information about small molecules,
miRNAs and their relationships, including species, small mol-
ecule name, DrugBank Accession number, PubChem CID,
approved by FDA or not, miRNA name, miRBase Accession
number, expression pattern of miRNA, experimental detection
method, tissues or conditions for detection, evidences in the ref-
erence, PubMed ID and the published year of the reference. In
total, 108 small molecules have CID, and 62 small molecule
drugs are approved by FDA.

For verifying the small molecules’ effects on miRNA expres-
sion, the researchers applied various experimental methods,
including high throughput methods such as microarray and
next-generation sequencing, low throughput methods such as
PCR, northern blot and Reporter Gene Assays. High through-
put experiments usually get more differentially expressed
miRNAs, which may lead to a higher false-positive rate, whereas
low throughput experiments are more credible. In our database,
2034 entries and 891 entries were got through high throughput
method and low throughput method, respectively. Finally,
SM2miR is developed using Struts, JSP, tomcat 6.0.33 and
MySQL5.0 and runs under Cent OS 5.5 system.

3 WEB INTERFACE

SM2miR provides a user-friendly interface. The users can search
a desired miRNA or small molecule through search pages, which
offer four options: by miRNA name, by small molecule name, by
CID and by DrugBank Accession number. Before searching, you
should choose to View low-throughput or high-throughput
experiment data or both. Searching by miRNA name supports
fuzzy searching. The results list all potential miRNAs that are
related to your inputted miRNA. Then, you can select several or
all miRNAs and click ‘Search’ button for retrieving or click your
desired miRNA directly. The basic information about the small
molecules and your inputted miRNA will be returned. Through
clicking ‘more’, you can obtain the detailed information.
SM2miR database also provides a submission page for users to
submit new data for updating the database and making it more
comprehensive. If the records are approved by our review com-
mittee, they will be available in SM2miR. In addition, all data
can be downloaded freely on the download page.

4 CONCLUSION

More and more evidences have proved that miRNA as a treat-
ment target is meaningful and promising, and many

small-molecule drugs can achieve this purpose. The restoration
of the miRNA expression may cure many kinds of critical illness.
The miRNA-based therapy may work through different
ways. The small molecules can not only structurally bind to
the grooves and pockets of miRNAs (Zhang et al., 2010) but
also target the key enzymes and other cofactors of the process
of miRNA synthesis (Melo et al., 2011; Watashi et al., 2010) or
the transcription factors of miRNAs. Thus, drug-targeted
protein may inﬂuence miRNA expression. However, miRNAs
are important post-transcriptional regulatory factors and can
regulate downstream protein expression. Even if the changed
miRNA expression is the result of protein-targeted treatment,
the miRNA may be a welcome addition to the current drug
targets.

To provide a valuable and comprehensive resource about the
inﬂuences of small molecules on miRNA expression, we manu-
ally retrieved the relationships of small molecules and miRNAs
from literatures and developed the SM2miR database. SM2miR
provides detailed information about small molecules, miRNAs
and evidences of their relationships. The development and
expansion of the SM2miR will continues to progress. In the
future, the next version will incorporate more comprehensive
information and become more powerful.

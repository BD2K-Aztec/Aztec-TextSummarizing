ABSTRACT

Summary: The visualization of gene structure plays an important
role in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primer design, especially
for eukaryotic genes with a number of splice variants that users
need to distinguish between via PCR. Here, we describe a visualized
web server for primer design named VizPrimer. It utilizes the new
information technology (IT) tools, HTML5 to display gene structure
and JavaScript to interact with the users. In VizPrimer, the users
can focus their attention on the gene structure and primer design
strategy, without wasting time calculating the exon positions of splice
variants or manually configuring complicated parameters. In addition,
VizPrimer is also suitable for the design of PCR primers for amplifying
open reading frames and detecting single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs).

Availability: VizPrimer is freely available at http://biocompute.bmi.ac
.cn/CZIab/VizPrimer/. The web server supported browsers: Chrome
(35.0), Firefox (33.0), Safari (34.0) and Opera (310.0).

1 INTRODUCTION

Alternative splicing is widely found for eukaryotic genes, and it
plays important roles in biological processes, such as increasing
protein diversity. The variant—speciﬁc PCR technique requires a
unique region of a transcript variant for the primer design to
distinguish between the speciﬁc variant from other isoforms.
Existing programs, such as Primer3 (Rozen and Skaletsky, 2000),
PerlPrimer (Marshall, 2004) and Primer Premier (Singh et al., 1998),
usually require users to enter or paste the DNA template sequence
and to specify the unique region manually. Another program,
PRIMEGENS—V2, added a new algorithm, HSPD (Srivastava et al.,
2011), to design homolog—speciﬁc PCR primers without any prior
information of the splice variants, but the algorithm requires
much longer search times to generate homolog—speciﬁc primers.
Importantly, none of these programs supports the graphic display of
the splice variants of eukaryotic genes. However, the Visualization

of gene structure makes a more direct impression and provides more
information on the spatial relationships to users than the currently
used, sequence—based information.

In fact, with the rapid development of information technology
(IT) tools, especially HTML5 and JavaScript, the user experience
of PCR primer design can be largely improved. The conﬁguration of
complicated parameters and options can be avoided by some mouse
clicks and simple dragging operations.

Therefore, we developed VizPrimer, a web server for Visualized
PCR primer design based on known gene structure. There are
several features that distinguish VizPrimer from other traditional
PCR primer design programs: (i) instead of pasting the template
DNA sequence, VizPrimer accepts ofﬁcial gene symbols, NCBI
GeneIDs, accession numbers, ofﬁcial full gene names and ‘fuzzy’
words as key words to fetch the gene records from the server;
(ii) instead of directly displaying the sequence on the screen,
VizPrimer graphically displays the gene structure (for all of the
splice variants) with the genome location, as other genome browsers
do (Fig. l), to help users ﬁnd the unique region of a splice
variant for PCR primer design; (iii) rather than asking users to
conﬁgure or input the complicated parameters, VizPrimer provides
an intuitive and easy—control platform to help users to specify the
primer—picking region and other operations; (iv) designing PCR
primers in VizPrimer is ﬂexible and, depending on the primer design
strategy and positions of primer icons, VizPrimer can design PCR
primers for the ampliﬁcation of speciﬁc exons and open reading
frames (ORFs) and the identiﬁcation of transcript variants and single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and (V) in combination with our
previous work, MFEprimer (Qu et al., 2009), VizPrimer acts as
a single package, which includes gene structure Visualization, a
primer design and a speciﬁcity—checking service to help users design
high—quality PCR primers.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

There are ﬁve modules in VizPrimer: (i) user—input query module;
(ii) gene structure display module; (iii) user—interactive module;
(iv) primer design module and (V) primer speciﬁcity check module.

As mentioned above, the user—input query module in VizPrimer
accepts the ofﬁcial gene symbols, NCBI GeneIDs, accession
numbers, ofﬁcial full gene names and fuzzy words as key words
to fetch gene records from the server. In addition, VizPrimer allows

the users to upload their own cDNA and genomic DNA sequence
for visualizing the gene structure. GMAP (Wu and Watanabe, 2005)
was used as a backend program for the gene structure prediction.

There are two layers of gene structure that are displayed. First,
a global View of the gene structure is presented, including all of
the splice variants; the resolution is dynamic and can be easily
controlled. Second, the detailed gene structure can be shown
at a resolution of even one base pair. The Genome Mapping
data (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/lVIapView) was used to display
the splice variant images at the gene level. The JavaScript and
HTML5 ‘canvas’ element were implemented in the gene structure
visualization. A JavaScript—based graphics demonstration has been
widely used in bioinformatic and cheminformatic visualizations due
to its low cost on the server—side and free plug—in feature on the
browser—side.

Unlike the currently and widely used programs, the PCR primer
design work in VizPrimer is similar to playing video games. Without
the need to calculate the position of an exon, the user merely
puts/drags the primer icons (right and left arrowheads) on the
selected exon, and the amplicon size and primer position will be
simultaneously displayed when moving the forward/reverse primer
icons (Fig. 1). All these operations are controlled by JavaScript on
the browser—side, which is fast and does not need to communicate
with the server.

There are four options available in VizPrimer to select the optimal
PCR primers for special demands: ‘Exon locked’ (for splice variant
analysis), ‘3’—terminus free’ (for gene expression analysis), ‘5’—
terminus locked’ (for ORF analysis) and ‘3’—terminus locked’ (for
SNP analysis). The ‘Exon locked’ option indicates that VizPrimer
will search the optimal primers from the full region of the selected
exon, which is useful for the identiﬁcation of the expression of the
splice variant containing this exon. The ‘3’—terminus free’ option
means that VizPrimer will search the optimal primers globally
from the full—length cDNA sequence. The ‘5’ —te1minus locked’
option means that the 5’ —te1minus of the primer is locked on the
position indicated by the primer icons, as denoted by the right and
left arrowheads; this option is suitable for ORF primer design to
amplify the region from the start codon (ATG) to or before the
stop codon (TAA/TAG/T GA). Of course, the users can also specify
their own cDNA region to be ampliﬁed by using this option. In
addition, the ‘3’ —te1minus locked’ option will be useful for SNP
PCR primer design. The kernel primer design program is a Primer3
(version 2.2.3) command—line program. The result page will return

ﬁve PCR primer pairs by default and the graphic gene structure
with the designed primers located on it. Moreover, a link to the
MFEprimer—2.0 (http://biocompute.bmi.ac.cn/CZlab/MFEprimer—
2.0/) speciﬁcity evaluation results is provided for each primer pair.

The overall computing time for both the PCR primer design
and primer speciﬁcity evaluation were ~1s on average, without
considering the network communication time. VizPrimer requires
browsers supporting HTML5, such as Chrome (35.0) and Firefox
(33.0).

3 DISCUSSION

The design of PCR primers for eukaryotic genes in the identiﬁcation
of splice variants is a complex and tedious task. The currently
available primer design programs do not have a function of
graphically displaying the gene structure to help users locate
the unique regions among the splice variants. Using HTML5
and JavaScript for adding interactivity to a web page is a new
paradigm of web computing nowadays. This combination is also
encouraged by scientiﬁc applications due to the fast progress in
the performance of JavaScript engines and HTML5—compatible
browsers. There are already several scientiﬁc applications relying on
the JavaScript and HTML5 ‘canvas’ element and which are currently
available, including Anno—J (Lister et al., 2008) and ChemDoodle
(http://web.chemdoodle.com/). Therefore, by integrating these new
technologies, the widely used primer design program, Primer3, and
the speciﬁcity—checking program, MFEprimer, VizPrimer will be a
beneﬁcial visual PCR primer design tool. In the future, we will add
the function of visualized multiple PCR primer design to VizPrimer.

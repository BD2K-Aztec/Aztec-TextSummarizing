ABSTRACT

Summary: ChemBioServer is a publicly available web application for
effectively mining and filtering chemical compounds used in drug
discovery. It provides researchers with the ability to (i) browse and
visualize compounds along with their properties, (ii) filter chemical
compounds for a variety of properties such as steric clashes and
toxicity, (iii) apply perfect match substructure search, (iv) cluster com-
pounds according to their physicochemical properties providing rep-
resentative compounds for each cluster, (v) build custom compound
mining pipelines and (vi) quantify through property graphs the top
ranking compounds in drug discovery procedures. ChemBioServer
allows for pre—processing of compounds prior to an in silico screen,
as well as for post-processing of top-ranked molecules resulting from
a docking exercise with the aim to increase the efficiency and the
quality of compound selection that will pass to the experimental test
phase.

1 INTRODUCTION

A rate-limiting step in computer-aided drug design (CADD) is
often the need for a computational chemist expert to post-
process compounds that result from a Virtual screening/docking
exercise before selecting which ones should be tested experimen-
tally (Dobson, 2004). This post-processing step entails identifying
and discarding docking poses that result in intra-ligand steric
clashes as well as compounds with undesirable or toxic moieties
and unwanted physicochemical properties (Cournia et al., 2009).
Cheminformatics web applications play an essential role for
searching, ﬁltering and clustering chemical compounds for
drug discovery (Backman et al., 2011). In recent years, several
chemical compound databases have been developed, including
Zinc, chemDB, PubChem and many others (Chen et al., 2007;
Irwin and Shoichet, 2005; Li et al., 2010). Nevertheless, although
knowledge integration can drastically increase the power and the
predictive capability of large-scale computational comparisons of
chemical structures, online open access web applications for
compound mining are limited in number and, importantly, in
pipeline integration level.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Namely, in the EDinburgh University Ligand Selection
System (EDULISS) (Hsin et al., 2011), either similarity or
pharmacophore search of compounds is performed on commer-
cially available molecules based on a proposed ultrafast shape
recognition algorithm or by calculating interatomic distances.

In the SIMilar COMPound and SUBstructure matching of
COMPounds web application (Hattori et al., 2010), chemical
similarity and substructure searches are computed by means of
the maximum common induced subgraph using an atom-based
approach and the maximum common edge subgraph or by a
bond-based approach. Nevertheless, in both web applications,
advanced ﬁltering criteria such as Lipinski Rule of Five
(Lipinski et al., 2001) or custom-made ﬁlters are not available.

By using the FAF-Drugs2 web application (Lagorce et al.,
2011), users are able to process their own compound collections
through simple absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion
and toxicity ﬁltering rules to aid the drug discovery process.
However, the user is not able to apply sub-graph search with a
custom-made Structure Data Format (SDF) (Bodenhofer et al.,
2011) ﬁle. Moreover, van der Waals (VdW) energy or geometric
criteria are not taken into consideration in the ﬁltering section to
discard docking poses with steric clashes. Also, no clustering
technique of compounds with similar characteristics is available
to any of the previously mentioned web applications.

ChemMine Tools (Backman et al., 2011) is a web service for
structure Visualization and comparison, similarity searching and
compound clustering. However, the user can select only two
compounds to compare each time, which is limiting considering
the need for massive similarity searches through the compounds
of a library. Thus, the process does not facilitate large-scale ﬁl-
tering procedures. Furthermore, neither vdW energy or radii re-
strictions nor toxicity checking is available to the user as a
ﬁltering service. Finally, the service does not provide the user
with the most representative compound for each cluster.

To overcome all previously mentioned limitations, we have de-
veloped ChemBioServer as a free web-based application aimed to
assist hit selection arising from CADD. ChemBioServer is a web
application that automates pre-/post-processing tasks during Vir-
tual screening. Through a customized workﬂow, molecules are
discarded by evaluating parameters such as VdW energy, geom-
etry, physicochemical properties and undesired/toxic moieties.
The web application is implemented so that the post-processing
procedure can be tailored to the speciﬁc needs of the user as
every compound query is unique. It also features a clustering
section with two clustering methods, the hierarchical (Backman
et al., 2011) as well as the modern (Frey and Dueck, 2007) af-
ﬁnity propagation (AP) clustering algorithm, grouping together

and proposing a representative compound for each cluster
(Bodenhofer et al., 2011). Additionally, visualization of clusters
and graphical representations of molecular properties are also
available, which provide insights into the compounds’ physico-
chemical similarity level.

2 METHODS AND IMPLEMENTATION

The ChemBioServer web application is divided into six main sections:
(i) basic search, (ii) ﬁltering, (iii) advanced ﬁltering, (iv) clustering, (v) cus-
tomize pipeline and (vi) visualize compounds’ properties. The application
back-end is developed in R programming language (http://cran.r-project.
org/), while the front-end is implemented with PHP (http://www.php.
net/). 2D/3D display of compounds is accomplished by means of the
open-source Java viewer for chemical structures JChemPaint (http://
JChemPaint.sourceforgenet) and Jmol (http://www.jmol.org/), respect-
ively. Compound Fingerprints are generated with Open Babel (12). The
format of the ﬁles that are uploaded to the ChemBioServer is either SDF
or M 0L. However, transformation from other ﬁle formats is facilitated
through proper links in the help page.

The ‘Basic Search’ section (i) enables the researcher to browse the
contents of a compound ﬁle that is uploaded to the server. After the
upload, SDF ﬁles are processed with the use of the ChemmineR (Cao
et al., 2008) package for R. Compounds are displayed with their molecu-
lar name in a list form with their corresponding SDF information at-
tached such as the molecular name, the connection table, the atom, bond
and property block, etc. In addition, 3D visualization of each compound
is available by clicking on the atom name.

In the ‘Filtering’ section (ii), compound mining can be performed based
on a variety of chemical properties. In the predeﬁned queries section, the
researcher is able to upload a ﬁle and select compounds that comply with
the Lipinski Rule of Five. In addition, in the combined search section,
searching can be performed by applying more advanced criteria such as
partition coefﬁcient logP or Polar Surface Area (PSA) (Guha, 2007).

Three main ﬁltering methods are provided in the ‘Advanced Filtering’
section (iii): (a) the exact substructure ﬁltering can be accomplished by
uploading two compound ﬁles and identifying whether compounds of the
second ﬁle can be found in the ﬁrst. It should be noted that the second ﬁle
can also contain fragments of unwanted or toxic moieties; the algorithm
recognizes whether the fragment is found within any compound of the
ﬁrst ﬁle and reports it. This ﬁltering step is accomplished by converting
ﬁles to Simpliﬁed Molecular Input Line Entry Speciﬁcation (SMILES)
with the use of Open Babel (O’Boyle et al., 2011) and applying maximum
common substructure searches for pairs of molecules (Guha, 2007).
(b) Additional toxicity ﬁltering is performed by screening out compounds
that contain a collection of toxic and carcinogenic fragments that is
provided on site. (0) The vdW ﬁltering to discard molecules with steric
clashes is also provided by means of energy and radii tolerance (J orgensen
et al., 1996). Poses that are far from the energy minimum are unlikely to
be adopted in nature and hence should be discarded. In several docking
exercises with Glide (Schrodinger, LLC), we have observed that the
post-docking poses often suffer from vdW clashes (see ChemBioServer
help page). In particular, we observed that even after Glide post-docking
minimization, ~20% of the generated poses should be discarded due to
unrealistic vdW interactions, which required automating this procedure.

The ‘Clustering’ section (iv) includes a classical as well as a modern
clustering algorithm. Compound ﬁngerprints are either provided by the
user or generated using the 166 bit MACCS Open Babel ﬁngerprint.
In the case of hierarchical clustering, the user is able to select the distance,
the linkage and a threshold value. In the case of AP clustering, the algo-
rithm takes as input a set of pairwise similarities among compound ﬁn-
gerprints, considering them as potential representative compounds
(exemplars). The clusters are calculated by exchanging messages between

data points until a maximization process converge. Thus, exemplars for
each cluster are proposed to the researcher for further investigation.
Additionally, visualization of clusters is also available as a PDF dendro-
gram plot.

In section (v), a pipeline workﬂow that combines all or part of the
previously described ﬁltering services is provided by the ChemBioServer
so as to speed up the ﬁltering process. Compound sets are successively
tested on enabled ﬁltering modules and molecules that fail are discarded.
When the process in completed, the user is provided with a single ﬁle that
contains compounds that have passed all previously enabled ﬁltering
tests.

In the ﬁnal section (vi), graphical representations of molecular proper-
ties can be created by means of the Raphaél javascript library (http://
raphaeljs.com/). More precisely, Principal Component Analysis WVehrens
and Buydens, 2007) of the ﬁrst principal component against the second,
based on the tanimoto coefﬁcient can be applied. In addition, graphical
representation of logP against PSA is also available. Finally, MW against
PSA and logP plots can be performed. Thus, compounds that have sur-
vived from the extensive ﬁltering are then explored for the optimum
subset that will pass to the experimental test phase. We have tested this
pipeline in several test datasets and found that the Server produced ac-
curate results and tremendously helped our CADD process in one auto-
mated step (see Help section of the server).

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Recently it has been shown that the quality of protein
contact prediction from evolutionary information can be improved
significantly if direct and indirect information is separated. Given suf-
ficiently large protein families, the contact predictions contain suffi-
cient information to predict the structure of many protein families.
However, since the first studies contact prediction methods have im-
proved. Here, we ask how much the final models are improved if im-
proved contact predictions are used.

Results: In a small benchmark of 15 proteins, we show that the TM-
scores of top-ranked models are improved by on average 33% using
PconsFoId compared with the original version of EVfold. In a larger
benchmark, we find that the quality is improved with 15—30% when
using PconsC in comparison with earlier contact prediction methods.
Further, using Rosetta instead of CNS does not significantly improve
global model accuracy, but the chemistry of models generated with
Rosetta is improved.

Availability: PconsFoId is a fully automated pipeline for ab initio pro-
tein structure prediction based on evolutionary information. PconsFoId
is based on PconsC contact prediction and uses the Rosetta folding
protocol. Due to its modularity, the contact prediction tool can be
easily exchanged. The source code of PconsFoId is available on
GitHub at https://www.github.com/ElofssonLab/pcons-fold under the

1 INTRODUCTION

The protein folding problem is one of the longest standing
problems in structural biology. Although the problem of
physically folding up a single protein chain in the computer re-
mains largely unsolved, there have been continuous effort and
progress, resulting in increased accuracy of predicted models
(Kryshtafovych et al., 2013).

The idea of using residue—residue contacts predicted from
analysis of correlated mutations observed in evolution for 3D
protein structure prediction is not new (Gbel et al., 1994;
Hatrick and Taylor, 1994; Neher, 1994; Shindyalov et al.,
1994; Vendruscolo et al., 1997). However, until recently contacts
predicted from multiple sequence alignments were not
sufﬁciently accurate to facilitate structure prediction methods
signiﬁcantly (Marks et al., 2012). This only became possible
due to new statistical approaches to separate direct from indirect

contact information (Burger and van Nimwegen, 2010; Lapedes
et al., 1999, 2012; Marks et al., 2011; Morcos et al., 2011; Weigt
et al., 2009) as well as a greatly increased corpus of sequence
information. These efforts came to completion with the ﬁrst
demonstration of successful computation of correct folds with
explicit atomic coordinates using maximum-entropy derived
contacts (Marks et al., 2011). Analysis of the relative contribu-
tion of secondary structure and co-evolutionary information
pointed to potential improvements in 3D accuracy (Sulkowska
et al., 2012). Since then there has also been continuous effort to
improve the quality of predicted contacts (Ekeberg et al., 2013;
Jones et al., 2012; Skwark et al., 2013).

In addition to the initial predictions of soluble proteins (Marks
et al., 2011) and protein complexes (Schug et al., 2009), contacts
predicted from evolutionary information have also been applied
in structure prediction of membrane proteins (Hopf et al., 2012;
Nugent and Jones, 2012).

To optimize protein structure prediction from predicted con-
tacts, we developed PconsFold, a pipeline for ab initio protein
structure prediction of single-domain proteins, see Figure l.
PconsFold is based on predicted amino acid contacts from
PconsC. These contacts are used within Rosetta to fold a given
protein sequence from scratch. We benchmark our method on
two datasets and compare it with the CNS (Brunger, 2007)
protocol used in EVfold (Marks et al., 2011). It was found that
the improved quality of predicted contacts by PconsC (Skwark
et al., 2013) increases quality and native-likeliness of predicted
structures by about 33% over EVfold and 16% over EVfold-
PLM, that is using the improved contact predictions from
plmDCA (Ekeberg et al., 2013).

2 METHODS
2.1 Datasets

During the development of PconsFold, we used the proteins from Jones
et a]. (2012) (PSICOV dataset). The dataset consists of 150 single-domain
proteins with sequence lengths between 52 and 266 amino acids. A list of
all Protein Data Bank (PDB) (Berman et al., 2000) and corresponding
Uniprot (Magrane and Uniprot Consortium, 2011) IDs are given in
Supplementary Table S1.

For each protein, we chose to use the PDB seqres sequence as input
and not the atom sequence. This avoids internal gaps due to missing
residues in the crystal structure. Uniprot sequences were not directly
used to avoid including mutations and other sequential differences with
the PDB sequences. This also allows direct comparisons between pre-
dicted models and native PDB structures.

As an additional comparison between PconsFold and EVfold, we used
the set of 15 proteins as in Marks 61 a]. (2011). PDB and Uniprot IDs and

Fig. 1. PconsFold pipeline. Based on a given protein sequence, amino
acid contacts are predicted with PconsC. These contacts then facilitate
protein folding with Rosetta. In the end, PconsFold outputs a structural
model for the given sequence

the sequences are given in Supplementary Table S2. According to the
Uniprot IDs, we extracted the sequences from the Pfam alignments
that were used in the publication. These sequences were submitted to
the EVfold web server and used as input for PconsFold.

2.2 Contact prediction

In PconsFold, residue contacts are predicted using PconsC (Skwark et al.,
2013). The contact predictor plmDCA (Ekeberg et al., 2013) is used by
Rosetta/plmDCA and in EVfold-PLM. Rosetta/plmDCA uses the direct
output from plmDCA, while in EVfold predicted contacts are further
optimized according to Marks et al. (2011). PSICOV (Jones et al.,
2012) was used in Rosetta/PSICOV.

Predicted contacts were ranked according to the conﬁdence score as-
signed by the respective contact prediction method. For each protein, we
selected 11 = f - l top-ranked contacts, where 1 represents the length of the
protein sequence and f a factor to scale 11 relative to sequence length.
Consider f is set to 1.0. A protein with length 100 amino acids will thus be
constrained by the ﬁrst 100 predicted contacts.

2.3 Rosetta

In PconsFold, Rosetta/plmDCA and Rosetta/PSICOV, we apply the
AbinitioRelax folding protocol (Rohl et al., 2004) of Rosetta in version
2013wk42 (Leaver-Fay et al., 2011). The ﬁle abinitio .op—
tions_tmpl in the folder pcons—fold/folding/rosetta 0f the
GitHub repository lists all options we are using with AbinitioRelax.

We employ the function FADE to integrate predicted residue contacts
into the internal scoring function of Rosetta. FADE calculates the energy
of a given contact as a function of the distance d between its residues as
given by the following equation:

 

 

 

 

0.0 ford< lbord> ub
3 2
—2(d;lj> —3(d;[/) +1 ford<lf
FADE(d)= d 3 d 2 (1)
2( _/) —3( _/)+1 ford<uf
z z
w otherwise.

The parameters lb and ub are lower and upper bounds, 2 represents the
fading zone’s width, If and uf denote the inner boundaries for the fading
zone lb + z and ub—z, respectively. The well depth of the interval between
both inner boundaries is given by w. We set lb to —10A, ub to 19 A and z
to 10 A. This deﬁnes a contact to be fully formed if the participating
residues are within 9A of each other. The fading zones allow for a soft
margin between formed and non-formed contacts. In terms of energy, all
non-formed contacts are ignored. In our opinion, this accounts best for
the fuzzy nature of predicted contacts. The fading zone at the lower

bound allows Rosetta to detect and resolve overlapping residues, i.e.
when there is a negative distance between two residues.

To avoid the inclusion of homologous fragments into Rosetta, the —
nohoms ﬂag was used during fragment picking. This means that only
fragments from non-homologous protein structures were selected. This
was done to simulate a real application case and not to overestimate
prediction performance. If not stated otherwise, we used all 150 proteins
of the PSICOV dataset as prediction targets in this section.

2.4 Folding with CNS using EVfold-PLM

On the PSICOV dataset, EVfold-PLM was run in a standalone version.
The alignment E-value cutoff was ﬁxed to 10—4. The parameter m was set
to 0.9. This deﬁnes a threshold to exclude sequences from the alignment
that consist of >90% of gaps. Using just one E-value for the alignment
enabled comparison across the methods, but it should be noted that the
EVfold server offers optimization of the E-values based on sequence
coverage and number of sequences found, which results in improved re-
sults in some cases.

EVfold-PLM was run with default parameters on the small test set
using the web interface available at http://evfold.org/. We ensured that it
uses pseudolikelihood maximization (plm) on all data, instead of the
naive mean ﬁeld approach for contact prediction.

Folding with EVfold-PLM was performed using CNS and the same
protocol as described before (Marks et al., 2011). Here, the distance
geometry protocol is initially used and followed by a short simulated
annealing. The CNS-based folding protocol used in EVfold is approxi-
mately one order of magnitude faster than the Rosetta protocol used in
PconsFold. In addition, PconsC is at least four times slower than just
running the contact predictions used in EVfold-PLM.

2.5 Identiﬁcation of top-ranked model

In addition to internal Rosetta scoring, we assessed the quality of all
predicted models with the model quality assessment programs
(MQAPs) Pcons (Lundstrom et al., 2001), ProQ2 (Ray et al., 2012)
and DOPE from the Modeller software package (Eswar et al., 2006).
Pcons uses a comparative approach and ranks all decoys according to
pairwise structural similarity between them. ProQ2 and DOPE assess
single proteins and evaluate structural features, such as side-chain place-
ment and overall shape. For our ranking, we use the global score each
MQAP assigns to a predicted structural model (decoy). Residue-wise in-
formation about local model quality is thus not used.

For each structure prediction method, all decoys were re-ranked with
each MQAP. The top-ranked model was then selected and compared
with its native structure. For this comparison, we used the TM-score
(Zhang and Skolnick, 2004) as a measure of structural similarity. As
native structure, we used the PDB structure of each protein without fur-
ther loop closing or other reﬁnement. Residues present in seqres but not
observed in the crystal structure, although modelled, are therefore
ignored in the structural comparison.

The positive predictive value (PPW was calculated to assess the quality
of predicted models. It indicates how well a given contact map ﬁts a given
structure. All PPV values were calculated using reference contacts C’8 (CO‘
in case of glycine) distances in the structure (native or model) with a
cutoff at 8 A.

2.6 Model quality assessment

Accurate stereochemistry becomes important when the predicted models
are of correct overall fold. Therefore, we used MolProbity (Chen et al.,
2010) to assess the chemical model quality. The MolProbity tool one—
line—analysis was used to detect clashes and to evaluate backbone
dihedrals as well as side-chain rotamers. To prepare all structures for this
analysis, we ﬁrst relaxed them with ﬁxed backbone atoms. The Rosetta

tool reduce—build. All resulting structures are provided in the
Supplementary Material.

2.7 Running time

A reduction from 20000 to 2000 decoy structures corresponds to a 10-
fold decrease of runtime during the Rosetta folding step but also leads to
an expected decline in average model quality, see Figure 2a. On one core
of an Intel E5-2660 (2.2 GHz Sandybridge), the calculation of one decoy
takes between 1 and 10min for the shortest and longest protein in the
PSICOV dataset, respectively. To compute 2000 decoys for each protein,
we ran 16 threads in parallel. Each of these threads then generates 125
decoys, starting with independent random seeds. With this setting it takes
between two hours and nearly one day to generate all decoys for one
protein. This simple scaling is possible, as Rosetta runs are independent
of each other as long as they are based on independent random seeds.
Increasing the number of threads can then be used to reduce overall
runtime or to generate more decoys within a given time span.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1 PconsFold

For all results in this section, we used the internal Rosetta score
to rank all predicted decoys. The top-ranked decoy structure was
then selected as the ﬁnal model.

Previous studies have shown that 20 000—200 000 decoys are
necessary to sample native-like conformations without using spa-
tial constraints (Simons et al., 1999). We set out using 20 000
models and then reduced the number of decoy structures to
2000. The bulk at around 0.3 TM-score observed for when
only 2000 models are generated represents an increased

number of low quality models, see Figure 2a. In general, the
practical advantages of massively shorter Rosetta runs outweigh
slightly worse predicted models. This parameter is therefore set
to a default value of 2000 but can be speciﬁed by the user via a
command line argument. All further results in this section are
generated with this default setting, i.e. using 2000 models.

We selected the FADE function to incorporate predicted resi-
due contacts into Rosetta’s native energy function. We then
optimized the parameter w (well-depth) of FADE (Equation
1). A subset of 14 proteins of the PSICOV dataset, see
Supplementary Table S1, was used to reduce CPU hours of
this step. The resulting TM-scores are shown in Figure 2b. The
energy term from spatial constraints diminishes with well-depth
values of —0.5 and above. This leads to a signiﬁcant decrease in
model quality. Stronger weights than —5.0 put a larger absolute
weight on the constraints resulting in higher model qualities. This
trend can also be observed when looking at the full dataset. The
average TM-score decreases to 0.28 using a well-depth of —l.0.
At the end, we choose to use a value of —15.0 to achieve high
model quality without outweighing Rosetta’s internal energy
function completely.

With any number of contacts used during structure prediction,
the resulting model quality is on average higher than it would be
without contact information. Figure 3a shows that predicted
contacts generally improve model quality, regardless of method
or amount of contacts.

In addition, improvements in contact prediction methods
further increase the quality of predicted structures. With an aver-
age TM-score of 0.55, PconsFold, i.e. using PconsC contacts,
provides a 10% improvement over using PSICOV or plmDCA
contacts. This observation is consistent with a direct comparison
of contact prediction methods as in Skwark et al. (2013).

Fig. 3. Folding performance on the full PSICOV dataset. (a) The number of contacts used in structure prediction is plotted against average TM-score for
three different methods: PconsFold (green circles), Rosetta/plmDCA (blue triangles) and Rosetta/PSICOV (black squares). For each protein, the number
of top-ranked contacts was selected relative to its sequence length. A value of 1.0 on the x-axis represents one contact per residue on average. Error bars
indicate standard errors. (b) TM-scores are compared with the PPV of underlying contact maps for PconsFold (using PconsC). The colours represent all
four CATH fold classes. Lines are ﬁtted to the data to illustrate performance differences between the fold classes

However, the performance difference between PSICOV and
plmDCA diminishes when their contacts are used in structure
prediction.

There is an optimal number of contacts, speciﬁc to the contact
prediction method. In Figure 3a, the average TM-score max-
imum is reached at x = 1.0 for PconsFold, while for PSICOV
and plmDCA fewer contacts provide better models. This can be
explained by the quality of predicted contacts, i.e. there exists a
larger number of correct contacts in PconsC compared with
plmDCA or PSICOV (Skwark et al., 2013). Using more of
these contacts during structure prediction leads to improved
models.

This relation between contact and model quality can also be
observed in Figure 3b. The overall Pearson correlation between
PPV and TM-score in this dataset is 0.59, i.e. proteins with con-
tact maps of lower quality tend to be modelled less accurate.

Proteins belonging to the mainly alpha CATH fold class seem
to be easier to fold than proteins from the alpha & beta fold class,
and proteins from the mainly beta fold class seem to be hardest to
fold, see Figure 3b and Supplementary Figure S1. On average,
predicted contact maps in mainly a-helical proteins (blue) have
similar or lower PPV values than those of ,B-sheet containing
proteins (green and yellow), but the resulting models are more
accurate in terms of TM-score. This might be explained by
higher contact-order (Plaxco et al., 1998) in beta-sheet proteins,
which renders such proteins more difﬁcult to fold (Bradley and
Baker, 2006).

3.2 Identiﬁcation of top-ranked model

predictions for the PSICOV dataset. It shows average TM-scores

for top-ranked models after re—ranking all models with each
MQAP. The difference between two TM-score values is signiﬁ-
cant with >95% conﬁdence if its absolute value is 0.02 or above.
Due to the different ways constraints are used within CNS and
Rosetta, we did not apply Rosetta’s internal scoring function to
the models generated by CNS. To provide a TM-score baseline,
we ran the Rosetta folding step without constraints and using the
internal scoring only. This resulted in an average TM-score of
0.34. For PconsFold and Rosetta/plmDCA, the internal scoring
performed best, which is indicated by the highest average TM-
score in Table l. The internal scoring function takes into account
the number of satisﬁed predicted contacts as a part of the energy
function, i.e. models that satisfy more predicted contacts are as-
signed low energies and thus ranked on top.

In EVfold-PLM the best method to identify top-ranked
models is by using Pcons (Lundstrom et al., 2001). Further,
Pcons performed only slightly worse than the internal scoring
function of Rosetta on the models from PconsFold and
Rosetta/plmDCA, showing the advantage of simple clustering
methods.

Predicted contacts in the top-ranked model for 1JWQ with the same color scheme. This model has a TM-score of 0.62 and a PPV of 0.46

Further, we examined two quality assessments that have been
reported to show good ability to identify accurate protein
models, ProQ2 (Ray et al., 2012) and Dope (Shen and Sali,
2006). The ProQ2 quality did not perform well on EVfold-
PLM models but only slightly worse than Pcons on models
from PconsFold and Rosetta/plmDCA. We also tested a com-
bination of ProQ2 and Pcons, as in Wallner et al. (2007).
However, the results are omitted, as they were not signiﬁcantly
different from those of Pcons alone. DOPE scoring of EVfold-
PLM models worked almost as good as Pcons, but we observe a
strong decline in average model quality for PconsFold and
Rosetta/plmDCA.

3.3 Does PconsFold optimally use the contact
information?

Next, we examined if the folding protocol has fully used the
available contact information. This was done, by comparing
the number of satisﬁed constraints (PPV) in the top-ranked
model and the native structure. On average, the PPV of predicted
contacts is higher in native structures than in the models (0.55
versus 0.47). This shows that using a more efﬁcient folding
protocol would improve the models. All points in the lower
right triangle in Figure 4a indicate models that could be im-
proved. Clearly, for predicted contacts below PPV = 0.4, many
models satisfy the constraints better than the native structures,
i.e. we would not expect that a better folding protocol would
improve the models. It is possible that these low-quality contact
maps mislead the structure prediction process and that this re-
sults in models that diverge from native structures with a better
ﬁt to the predicted contacts. Possibly, in these cases, it would be
better to use fewer contacts. However, for most proteins with a
PPV higher than 0.4, we are clearly not able to satisfy all con-
straints. Here, an improved folding protocol would improve the
models.

In Figure 4, we also study one example of non-optimal folding
more closely. We selected 1JWQ, as it represents the worst-case

scenario where the difference between native and model PPV is
largest. With a PPV of 0.83, most of the contacts were predicted
correctly for this protein. The overall PPV decreased to 0.46 for
this model. Clearly, the folding protocol has not been able to
produce a compact model. Generating more decoys might solve
this problem but a more efﬁcient folding protocol would be
preferable.

3.4 PconsFold versus EVfold

When looking at Figure 5, the majority of alpha-helical proteins
(blue) achieved higher TM-scores with PconsFold than with
EVfold-PLM. On average, we see an improvement of 14% of
PconsFold over EVfold-PLM on alpha-helical proteins. The
same improvement can also be observed for Rosetta/plmDCA.
Together with Figure 3, this indicates that Rosetta performs
better on alpha-helical proteins. The average performance of
PconsFold on alpha & beta proteins (green) is 15% higher
than for EVfold-PLM. However, Rosetta/plmDCA performs
equally good as EVfold-PLM on average on such targets. The
improvement might thus be due to PconsC contact maps, as it is
only observable for PconsFold and not for Rosetta/plmDCA. At
a level of single proteins, we see quite some divergence between
the results of EVfold-PLM and PconsFold in Figure 5. This is
especially true for mainly beta proteins and alpha & beta proteins.

The analysis with MolProbity reveals that the backbone dihe-
dral quality of Rosetta models is higher than for EVfold-PLM
models. The percentage of Ramachandran outliers is 0.62% for
PconsFold and 12.16% for EVfold-PLM. MolProbity further
reports an average clash score of 10.48 for PconsFold and 9.90
for EVfold-PLM. The EVfold-PLM models have slightly less
clashes than the models from PconsFold. The average ﬁnal
MolProbity score is with 1.85 better for PconsFold then 2.38
for EVfold-PLM. This corresponds to a better average
MolProbity percentile rank of 80.69 for PconsFold than the
average rank of 54.21 for EVfold-PLM. Additional analysis

TM-score - Rosetta/plmDCA

Fig. 5. TM-score comparison for top-ranked models of the proteins in the PSICOV dataset. The decoys for each method were re—ranked using Pcons to
assess the performance of the structure prediction process independent of the model ranking scheme. The colours represent all four CATH fold classes.
(a) PconsFold compared with EVfold-PLM. (b) Rosetta/plmDCA compared with EVfold-PLM

with PROCHECK conﬁrmed this trend with 0.1%
Ramachandran outliers for PconsFold and 8.6% for EVfold.

Table 2 contains TM-scores for the top-ranked models of each
protein in the small test dataset. We compare the EVfold results,
as published in Marks et al. (2011), with results from the current
EVfold-PLM and PconsFold with 20 000 generated decoys. With
an average TM-score of 0.55, EVfold-PLM performs 15% better
than EVfold with mean ﬁeld within the 90% signiﬁcance inter-
val, showing the importance of improved contact prediction.
When using PconsFold, there is an additional improvement of
16% to an average TM-score of 0.64 within the 95% signiﬁcance
interval. This further supports our observation that improved
contact maps improve structure prediction.

Generally, co-evolution based methods are applicable to larger
proteins, as earlier studies on membrane proteins have shown
(Hopf et al., 2012; Nugent and Jones, 2012). Limitations are
given by the number of available sequences per residue (Hopf
et al., 2012; Kamisetty et al., 2013) and runtime.

4 CONCLUSION

Here, we show that improved contact predictions from PconsC
(Skwark et al., 2013) actually lead to improvements in protein
structure prediction. Further, it is clear that for proteins with
better-predicted contacts, the generated models are of higher
quality, i.e. future improvements in contact predictions will
result in higher quality models. According to Kamisetty et al.
(2013), there are 422 protein families without known structure
that are suitable for co-evolution—based contact prediction meth-
ods. This number will surely increase due to improved contact
prediction methods and growing sequence databases at increas-
ing rates. A comparison between using Rosetta and CNS indi-
cates that using similar contact predictions generates models of
similar quality. However, Rosetta models are chemically more
correct. Finally, it is also clear that in many top-ranked models,

the contacts are less well satisﬁed than in the native structures,
i.e. an improved folding protocol would improve the models.
One option would be to use model-PPV as a measure of model
quality, or as a stopping criterion for decoy generation, another
option is to use both CNS and Rosetta and then try to identify
the optimal model. Our results on different fold classes show that
model quality, especially in beta-sheet containing proteins, could

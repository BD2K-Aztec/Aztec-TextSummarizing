Abstract

Motivation: The study of RNA virus populations is a challenging task. Each population of RNA virus
is composed of a collection of different, yet related genomes often referred to as mutant spectra or
quasispecies. Virologists using deep sequencing technologies face major obstacles when studying
virus population dynamics, both experimentally and in natural settings due to the relatively high
error rates of these technologies and the lack of high performance pipelines. In order to overcome
these hurdles we developed a computational pipeline, termed ViVan (Viral Variance Analysis).
ViVan is a complete pipeline facilitating the identification, characterization and comparison of se—
quence variance in deep sequenced virus populations.

Results: Applying ViVan on deep sequenced data obtained from samples that were previously
characterized by more classical approaches, we uncovered novel and potentially crucial aspects of
virus populations. With our experimental work, we illustrate how ViVan can be used for studies
ranging from the more practical, detection of resistant mutations and effects of antiviral treatments,
to the more theoretical temporal characterization of the population in evolutionary studies.

1 Introduction

 

dependent RNA polymerases that replicate

The study of RNA virus populations is a challenging task. Each
population of RNA virus is composed of a collection of different,
yet related genomes often referred to as mutant spectra or quasispe—
cies (Lauring and Andino, 2010). This genotypic diversity is the re—
sult of the high mutation rate of RNA viruses, Which surpasses that
of DNA organisms by orders of magnitude (Sanjuan et 61]., 2010).
This intrinsic high error-rate is largely attributed to the viral RNA

(Steinhauer and Holland, 1987). Recent studies demonstrate that
this high-error rate is essential for viral adaptation and survival
(Ahlquist, 2002; Crotty et 61]., 2001) and can have significant impli-
cations in vaccine and antiviral efficacy (Love et 61]., 2010; Woo
and Reifman, 2012). Changes in the rate at Which these errors
occur may affect virus infectivity, fitness and pathogenesis
(Coffey et 61]., 2011; Crotty and Andino, 2002; Gnadig et 61]., 2012;

Graham et al., 2012). Moreover, it was shown that the diversity
within an RNA virus population enhances tissue tropism and dis—
semination, possibly by improving adaptability and mutual support
(Vignuzzi et al., 2005). These studies suggest that characterizing
RNA virus populations as a whole, rather than focusing on domin-
ant viral haplotypes (e.g. sequences shared by a significant amount
of members in the population) or consensus sequence is far more in—
formative to study pathogenesis. Currently, RNA viruses are genet—
ically characterized through a variety of techniques. The most basic
and common method involves classic Sanger sequencing of cDNA
produced by RT—PCR of total viral RNA (i.e. consensus sequencing).
Although informative, the consensus sequence is the genetic average
of all variants within the virus population and the limitations of this
method include its low resolution and ability to detect only highly
abundant variants. To increase sensitivity and obtain a small, repre—
sentative sample of viral variants in a given population by Sanger
sequencing, individual viruses can be isolated and amplified (biolo—
gical clones) (Vignuzzi et al., 2005) or RT—PCR amplicons of the
whole population can be subcloned into individual plasmids
(molecular clones) (Levi et al., 2010; Sanjuan et al., 2010). An add—
itional method is Single Genome Amplification in which viral RNA
is extracted from a sample and copied into cDNA, which in turn is
subjected to limiting dilution and PCR amplification. Thus the
obtained PCR products are the result of the amplification of one
single molecule of cDNA. These PCR products are then sequenced
directly without cloning. Nevertheless, these three methods are time
intensive and tedious. Furthermore, the limited coverage that can be
sampled (generally <100 clones and 100K nucleotides per popula—
tion) is far from the range of variants (105—109) typically found in
virus samples. Newer high—throughput sequencing (HTS) technolo—
gies have expedited research in microbiology in general, including
virology, due to their high throughput sequence data production
(Capobianchi et al., 2013; Didelot et al., 2012; Radford et al., 2012;
Shomron, 2013). The ultra—deep coverage afforded by HTS technol—
ogies provides obvious improvements to the characterization of
RNA viruses. However, most HTS tools in virology are designed for
virus discovery, de novo assembly of unknown viral genomes, and
the characterization of viral biodiversity found in different organs,
organisms or environments (virome) (Delwart, 2013; Foulongne
et al., 2012; Hurwitz and Sullivan, 2013; Roux et al., 2012; Yin
et al., 2012). More recently, researchers have begun characterizing
the intra—host and intra—strain virus diversity and population dy—
namics for a variety of viruses of clinical or agricultural relevance.
For example, some studies addressed the temporal evolution of vari—
ants, the pre—existing presence of drug resistant mutants and the dy—
namics and emergence of escape mutations in the presence of
various types of pressure (Archer et al., 2012b; Barzon et al., 2011;
Beerenwinkel and Zagordi, 2011; Bull et al., 2011; Escobar—
Gutiérrez et al., 2012; Grad et al., 2014; Love et al., 2010; Martinez
et al., 2012; Selleri et al., 2012; T6pfer et al., 2013; Willerth et al.,
2010; Wright et al., 2011). However, Virologists using HTS technol—
ogies for the purpose of rare variant detection, face major obstacles
when studying virus population dynamics, both experimentally and
in natural settings due to the relatively high error rates of these tech—
nologies (Archer et al., 2012a; Watson et al., 2013; Wright et al.,
2011). In order to overcome these hurdles several methods have
been proposed (Acevedo et al., 2013; Eriksson et al., 2008; Flaherty
et al., 2012; Ghedin et al., 2012; Jabara et al., 2011; Kinde et al.,
2011; Macalalad et al., 2012; Mangul et al., 2014; Schmitt et al.,
2012; Watson et al., 2013; Wilm et al., 2012; Wright et al., 2011;
Wu et al., 2014; Zagordi et al., 2011). These methods can be split
into two main categories. The first increases variant detection

fidelity by modulating the library preparation step. Schmitt et al. tag
and compare both strands of a DNA segment, efficiently pinpointing
strand—discordant variants as errors. Jabara et al., Kinde et al.,
Mangul et al. and Wu et al. use unique identifiers for each sequenced
template, facilitating the identification of PCR and sequencing intro-
duced errors and biases. Acevedo et al. used circularized genomic
RNA fragments to generate tandem repeats which originate from a
single individual within the viral population. Variants that appear in
every copy of a set of repeats are then considered true variants. The
second category includes methods that utilize post—sequencing par—
ameters in order to identify PCR and sequencing introduced errors.
Ghedin et al. utilize the calculated overall baseline error rates while
Flaherty et al. and Wilm et al. calculate these rates per sequenced
base. Watson et al. apply a two step quality based filtration prior to
variant calling and Macalalad et al. used covariation (i.e. phasing)
between variants and an expectation maximization—based quality
recalibration. Methods which aim to identify the genomes of indi-
vidual haplotypes in the population (Eriksson et al., 2008; Zagordi
et al., 2011) utilize clustering of overlapping reads and haplotype re—
construction in order to correct for sequencing errors. The perform-
ance of these methods depends upon the length of sequence reads
with long reads enabling the reconstruction of entire viral genome
sequences. Some methods (Ghedin et al., 2012; McElroy et al.,
2013; Wilm et al., 2012) also include an additional test for strand
bias (Guo et al., 2012) in order to further reduce false positive calls.
Although these second category methods demonstrate very high spe—
cificity (positions without variance are correctly identified as such),
sensitivity (pinpointing true variant positions) remains the major
limiting factor (Wilm et al., 2012). All of the aforementioned tools
focus on accurate variant detection and do not facilitate any down—
stream analysis and interpretation of the detected variants.
Moreover, although the end—users for the aforementioned tools and
methods are, for the most part, Virologists studying highly diverse
viral populations, these tools require the use of unix command line
and other computational proficiencies which are not common in the
field.

In order to better integrate and utilize HTS technology in viral
population studies, we developed a computational pipeline and web
server, termed ViVan (Viral Variance Analysis). ViVan is a complete
pipeline to facilitate the identification, characterization and com—
parison of sequence variance in deep sequenced virus populations
(Fig. 1). ViVan performs per—sample allele rate analysis, translates
the detected changes into amino acid changes, compares and outputs
several informative metrics regarding each analyzed sample.
Applying ViVan on deep sequenced data obtained from samples that
were previously characterized by more classical approaches, we
achieved superior sensitivity and uncovered novel and potentially
crucial aspects of virus populations, which could not have been iden—
tified otherwise and in much shorter time scales. ViVan efficiently
identified low—frequency minority variants across the entire viral
genome and changes in population diversity that correlate with
in vitro and in vivo data of previously described mutator and anti—
mutator strains of RNA viruses. Additionally, it accurately deter—
mined dosage—dependent and drug—specific alterations in mutation
frequency associated with mutagenic, antiviral compounds. More
generally, we monitored temporal changes occurring within RNA
virus populations during experimental evolution and pinpointed
unique variable positions in viral genomes found in specific host en—
vironments that are indicative of positive selection and adaptation.
Overall, we show that ViVan allows rapid characterization of the
genetic composition and population dynamics of rapidly evolving
viral mutant spectra.

Sample Comparison

Fig. 1. Schematic of ViVan pipeline workflow. The analysis starts with raw se-
quence reads output by deep sequencing of a virus population sample. First,
these raw reads undergo quality trimming where low quality bases are
removed from both ends of the read. Second, these quality reads are aligned
against a user-supplied reference sequence and a pileup is produced for
each position. The pileup output is then analyzed, true variants are identified,
variant frequencies are modified and confidence intervals calculated. From
these modified significant variants, an assortment of variation metrics is
produced, including information regarding the predicted amino acid change
in each protein, the variation rates across the viral genome, transition/trans-
version rates and specific nucleotide change tables. Additionally, once variant
frequencies have been calculated, a consensus sequence is produced, utiliz-
ing the major allele in each position. This modified consensus sequence can
then be used for the alignment of the initial quality reads, hence improving
overall alignment and accuracy. Once the analysis is done for each virus se-
quence sample, a comparison is performed between groups of samples in
order to pinpoint both common and unique variants in each group

2 Methods

2.1 Performance validation

Validation data—sets were generated and published by Wilm et al.
(2012). LoFreq (Wilm et al., 2012) version 0.6.1 was run on the
data using default parameters. Variants with a P—value lower than
0.05 were marked as positive calls, regardless of the strand—bias
P—value. VPhaser2 (Yang et al.), was ran on the data using default
parameters. In order to maximize sensitivity, all the variants found
in the raw output file (without strand—bias or FDR corrections) were
considered as positive. In the first data set, Pileup was included in
the comparison and every detected non—reference allele was
considered as a true variant.

2.2 Reproducibility confirmation

In order to test the hypothesis that the frequencies of variants de—
tected only by one replicate (non—reproducible variant; NRV) are
higher than expected in the other un—detected samples, for each
NRV we counted the number of times its frequency is higher than
the other non—reference, non—variant alleles in each replicate. If the
NRV frequency is found to be higher in >3 of the replicates
(P < 0.05) we determine false negative as the reason of non—
reproducibility.

2.3 Measuring diversity of viral fidelity variants

The production and generation of DS libraries of passage 3 low
fidelity variants is described previously (Gnadig et al., 2012). The
raw data were reanalyzed for this article. (For additional details see
Supplementary Data 3).

2.4 Statistical methods

Correlation significance between samples was calculated
using Pearson’s correlation. An unpaired Student t—test was used
for comparison between samples (temporal accumulation of
variations).

2.5 ViVan pipeline

Our ViVan pipeline is composed of both established HTS data ana—
lysis tools and in—house Python scripts. The entire process, from raw
sequencing data to analysis output can be divided into several steps:
(i) quality control, (ii) alignment and Pileup, (iii) variant frequency
collection and filtering, (iv) variant annotation, (v) per—sample met—
rics and supplements and (vi) group comparison. (For additional
details see Supplementary Data 4)

2.6 Variant sites identification with allele frequency and
confidence interval estimation from deep sequence data
We have a sample with minor allele frequency (MAF) f at a
genomic locus of interest. The sequencer generates 11 reads
covering that locus. The 1th read is denoted y, and is either 0 or 1,
where 0 is a non—mutant allele and 1 is the mutant allele. Each
read is associated with a quality score p,- indicating the probability
that it is incorrect. The probability of observing a minor allele is
given by:

P0;- = 1;f) = f(1 —m) + (1 —f)p,-,
and the probability of observing a reference allele is:
1304' =0;f) = 1 _P(3’i = 1;f)-

Because each y,- is in fact a Bernoulli variable, we can write down the
log of the likelihood function as a sum of log—likelihood functions:

1m = 2;, [W108 (Po.- = no) + <1 — yi>log(P<y.- = (10)].

The optimum of the log-likelihood function has no closed form ex—
pression, but the function can be effectively optimized numerically
to find its maximizer, denoted fMLE, which is the maximum likeli-
hood estimator of the MAF f in the sample. We can then construct a
1 — or confidence set using Wilks’ theorem:

c1 = {f e [0,1] I 2(I<fMLE> — 1(0) < X31.)

where Xilﬂ is the 1 — or percentile of the chi—square distribution
with one degree of freedom. This confidence set is consistent
when the estimator is not on the boundary, and conservative when
it is.

A P—value can be similarly derived using Wilks’ theorem:

19.12.: 1 — FX2<2<1(I(MLE)_1(O)>>

where Fxg is the cumulative distribution function of the chi—square
distribution with one degree of freedom.

This analysis is performed for every non—reference allele in every
position with sufficient coverage (set at the start of the analysis).

3 Results

3.1 Performance validation

Minority variants have been shown to be associated with various
viral features, such as viral evolution, pathogenesis and the outcome
of drug treatment (Najera et al., 1995; Vignuzzi et al., 2005). To de—
termine how accurately our method detects low—frequency variants
in a viral population, and to demonstrate how it compares with cur—
rently available methods, we utilized published data generated by
Wilm et al. (2012). We selected three data sets: (i) simulated dengue
virus (DENV) population composed of 10 different in-silico gener-
ated haplotypes in varying rates (01—50%) and varying coverage
levels (50x, 100x, 500x, 1000><, 5000><, 10 000x), (ii) simulated
DENV population using six sequenced clinical samples sub—sampled
at various rates. (iii) six library replicates of DENV2 TSV01 viruses.
On each data set, we compared ViVan’s performance with LoFreq
(Wilm et al., 2012) and VPhaser2 (Yang et al., 2013). As the number
of true negatives (non—variant alleles) greatly surpasses the number
of true positives (resulting in high specificity values across methods),
we chose to focus on positive predictive values (PPVs; Rate of true
variants out of the total identified variants) instead of specificity for
performance assessment. The first data set was used to test perform—
ance as a function of sequencing coverage. In this data set, we also
tested SAMtools pileup’s (Li et al., 2009) performance in order to
mark the upper limit of sensitivity and to demonstrate the import—
ance of variant significance testing. We demonstrated that ViVan
presents a significantly higher sensitivity across coverage levels com—
pared with LoFreq and VPhaser2 (P < 0.005; Fig. 2A and B), iden-
tifying 90 i 5% of the variants with frequencies <0.2% (64 and 0%
in LoFreq and VPhaser2, respectively). The PPV cost of such an in—
crease in sensitivity was found to be minor and significant only in
low coverage levels (<500><; P < 0.01) with a PPV of 0.968 : 0.028
(specificity of 0.99995 i 0.00004) in 5 0x coverage. Calling variants
using pileup, resulted in the highest sensitivity across coverage levels,
but with a much higher cost in PPV. pileup’s PPV ranged from
0.376 : 0.022 in 50X to 0.066 : 0.00003 in 10 000x (93.4% of de-
tected variants are false). This emphasizes the need for computa—
tional variant assessment methods such as those employed by
ViVan, LoFreq and VPhaser2 in order to greatly reduce the number
of false positive calls. The second data set, which includes real
sequencing data, was used to demonstrate ViVan’s performance in
the context of coverage and quality biases (Fig. 2C). In this set, vari—
ants identified in positions that differ from the reference in any of
the six virus strains composing the simulated population were con—
sidered true variants (Table 1.)

Because the coverage in this data set was low (100x) ViVan’s
PPV was the lowest (0.983, 0.995 and 0.99 for ViVan, LoFreq and
VPhaser2, respectively). However, ViVan demonstrated the highest
sensitivity out of the three methods (0.947, 0.828 and 0.803 for
ViVan, LoFreq and VPhaser2, respectively), identifying all but one
of the variants found in the other methods (11 = 208), and detecting

Fig. 2. Performance validation of ViVan using data sets compiled by Wilm
et al. (A,B) Simulated sequencing of an in-silico generated virus population
with varying coverage levels. Performance is demonstrated using sensitivity
and the F1-score which incorporates both sensitivity and PPV
(2*(Sensitivity*PPV)/(Sensitivity+ PPV)). As coverage increases, low fre-
quency variants are detected and sensitivity levels rise across methods.
ViVan demonstrates high sensitivity and specificity across coverage levels
with only a minor cost in PPV, maintaining an overall F1-score higher than
the other methods. SAMtools pileup’s decline in F1-score is the result of a de-
crease in PPV as coverage increases. (C) Simulated virus population, using
sub-sampling of clinical samples with known variant locations. Comparing
true positive variant calls between methods, ViVan demonstrated the highest
sensitivity, identifying all but one of the variants detected by the other meth-
ods, and detecting 24 additional low-rate variants. (D) Reproducibility ana-
lysis using six libraries replicates of the same virus population.
Reproducibility was defined as % of variants detected in more than one repli-
cate. ViVan demonstrates high reproducibility in the higher frequency levels
(>0.5%) which decreases as frequencies drop. This decrease in reproducibil-
ity is due to detection of extremely low frequency variants by ViVan only in
some of the replicates and may be alleviated by sufficient coverage

Simulated DENV population using six sequenced clinical samples sub-
sampled at various rates was used to demonstrate ViVan’s performance in the
context of real sequencing data

Because the coverage in this data set was low (100x) ViVan’s PPV was the
lowest. However, ViVan demonstrated the highest sensitivity out of the three
methods, identifying all but one of the variants found in the other. This
dataset also highlights the need for sequencing-error aware methods in order
to reduce false positive calls such as the ones produced by naive pileup.

24 additional true, low—frequency variants at the cost of four false
positive variants. As we demonstrate using the first data—set, a cover—
age increase should compare ViVan’s PPV to the other methods’
while maintaining higher sensitivity.

The third and final data set, composed of six technical replicates
of the same sequenced DENV population, was used to test ViVan’s
reproducibility. Reproducibility was calculated as the percentage of
variants found in more than one replicate, out of the total number
of detected variants. When limiting the minimal variant rate for

detection, we see that ViVan demonstrates the highest reproducibil—
ity (>91.7%) among methods in variants with frequencies >0.5%.
Lower variant frequencies thresholds resulted in lower reproducibil—
ity across tools, with ViVan detecting the highest number of variants
but at the cost of lower reproducibility (Fig. 2D). We suspected that
this decrease in reproducibility is due to coverage limitation and in
fact represents false negative calls in extreme low frequency variants
in the disagreeing replicates in oppose to false positive calls in the
replicate with detected variant. We therefore reviewed the allele fre—
quencies in the variants not reproduced and found that the majority
of them (93/133) did demonstrate a higher frequency than expected
in the disagreeing replicates (P < 0.05; For more details see Methods
section), suggesting that they are in fact true variants. Simply put,
ViVan managed to detect extreme low coverage variants in some of
the replicates, which, given sufficient coverage, would have been
reproduced in the other samples as well. This demonstrates that
ViVan maintains high reproducibility (88.4%) even in low variant
rates, given sufficient coverage (Fig. 2D).

3.2 Identifying differences in population diversity and
mutagen effects

Although HTS could be a less labor—intensive approach to quantify—
ing diversity than more classic methods involving Sanger sequencing
or biochemical incorporation assays, the relatively high error rate of
the technology might prove to be too great to distinguish between
subtle differences in the genetic diversity of populations. To test
whether ViVan can detect such differences, we deep sequenced wild
type CVB3 virus and two well—characterized low fidelity mutator
strains, 1230F and F232Y, that were shown by classical assays to
generate 3—fold more mutations than wild type (Gnadig et al.,
2012). By molecular cloning, wild type virus was found to have a di—
versity measure of 0.00043 mutations/nucleotide, while the low fi—
delity variants presented roughly 3—fold more (0.00123 mutations/
nucleotide each) (Fig. 3a). When all minority variants identified by
ViVan were taken into account, regardless of their frequency (no
cut—off threshold), the diversity of all three virus populations were
significantly higher. Wild type virus, in particular, had higher than
expected frequencies of 0.00107 mutations/nucleotide in the region
previously sequenced by Gnadig et al., and 0.000996 mutations/nu—
cleotide across the entire genome. These data suggest that the higher
sensitivity of HTS identifies more extremely low—frequency variants
than would otherwise be detected by other available methods.
Indeed, when cut—off thresholds of 0.005 or 0.01 were set, ViVan
generated more conservative mutation profiles that more closely
resembled previously reported values for wild type and low fidelity
variants obtained by molecular clone sequencing(Gnadig et al.,
2012; Levi et al., 2010). Being able to identify subtle changes in
population diversity is important for RNA viruses, because the nat—
urally high mutation frequencies of these viruses confer susceptibil—
ity to conditions that further increase mutation rates above a
maximal threshold. This increased mutation rate may result in ex—
tinction, also termed lethal mutagenesis (Bull et al., 2007; Vignuzzi
et al., 2005).

Chemical agents inducing mutations, i.e. mutagens, are being
explored as possible antiviral agents (Crotty and Andino, 2002;
Graci and Cameron, 2008). An improved characterization of the ef—
fect of RNA mutagens and the genetic modulations they induce may
facilitate their development as antiviral drugs. With this in mind, we

5-AZC, 5-FU or ribavirin (R) or left untreated (control). The frequency (% of
total virus population) presenting specific transitions and transversions in
deep sequence data were classified by ViVan. (c) Dose-dependent effects of
mutagen treatment detected by deep sequencing. HeLa cells were infected
with CV83 with increasing concentrations of ribavirin (0, 100, 200 and

population) of specific transition (C> U, G >A, U >C, A>G; dashed lines)
and transversion (labeled ‘others'; solid lines) were determined by ViVan

(AZC, 300 uM) and 5—fluorouracil (FU, 150 uM). Each base analog
is known to induce different types of mutations, with biases that can
be considered genetic signatures of treatment: ribavirin promotes G
to A and C to U transitions (Crotty et al., 2000), 5—AZC promotes G
to A transitions and G to C, C to G and C to A transversions, and 5 —
FU promotes U to C and A to G transitions (Grande—Pérez et al.,
2002) (Fig. 3b). Using our pipeline to quantify the mutational bias

Using our pipeline, we were able to collect all the positions carrying any variant allele with a frequency >0.1% from every sequenced sample (the starting Virus

population (passage 1), eight cycles in Hela cells and alternating passages between Hela cells and mosquito C6 cells) and pinpoint unique positions across the Viral

genome in which variants were found only in the alternating passages positions. One of these variant positions, found in the Viral polymerase protein (nsp4) dem-

onstrated a high variant allele rate which may suggest functional relevance for survival in alternating host passages.

across the entire viral genome, the untreated sample revealed that
transition mutations are more common than transversions, as ex—
pected, and that the most commonly occurring transition mutations
were A to G and U to C, as previously reported (Levi et al., 2010).
For treatment with AZC, a significant increase in G to A transitions
and in the three transversions, particularly for C to G, was observed.
The deep sequence profile for FU treatment revealed the most com—
monly induced mutations to be the expected U to C and A to G tran—
sitions. Finally, the ribavirin treated population also presents the
expected G to A and C to U transitions with the highest frequencies.
Another aspect of mutagenic drug treatment that can be readily
demonstrated by ViVan is dosage—dependence, characterization of
which would normally require classic sequencing of hundreds of
molecular clones (Levi et al., 2010). We compared a CVB3 sample
without treatment, with infected samples treated with three concen—
trations of ribavirin (100, 200 and 400 uM). The results confirmed a
dose—dependent increase in the ribavirin—associated transition muta—
tions (C to U and G to A) compared with the other transition (A to
G and U to C) and transversion mutations, which showed no dose
dependent effect (Fig. 3c).

3.3 Comparing between samples in evolutionary
studies: identifying population—specific acquired
mutations that correlate with phenotypic differences

For biologists interested in RNA virus evolution, a primary goal is
to identify genotypes and mutations undergoing positive selection
that would represent adaptive mutations to the experimental condi—
tions, requiring comparison between numerous samples and con—
trols. Precise comparison of viral population composition is difficult
to carry out using common technologies as it requires either an im-
mense amount of whole—genome sequencing of individuals from
each population to be compared, or prior knowledge regarding the
expected gene or allele targeted by selection. In order to demonstrate
ViVan’s efficiency in pinpointing these functional mutational hot—
spots in viral populations, we analyzed deep sequence data of sam—
ples produced in a previously published experimental evolution
study (Coffey and Vignuzzi, 2011). In this work, wild type chikun-
gunya virus that normally cycles between mosquito and mammalian
hosts, was adapted to either only mammalian host cells, or cycled
between mammalian and mosquito cells (Coffey and Vignuzzi,
2011). We Applied ViVan on three sequenced samples: the initial
virus population (stock virus); following seven passages in HeLa
cells (p7 HeLa); and after alternating passages between HeLa cells
and mosquito C6/36 cells (p7 alt). In the original study using

molecular cloning data (Coffey and Vignuzzi, 2011), mammalian-
host adapted virus presented the highest amount of genetic diversity
compared with the initial starting population, while mammalian-
mosquito passage had an intermediate diversity. Analysis with
ViVan corroborated these observations. Setting a diversity threshold
of >0.005 we found that the stock virus had a total of 305 minority
variants. This diversity increased to 443 after serial passage in HeLa
cells, and 419 when alternating between HeLa and C6 cells. In the
original article, the presence of a more or less diverse set of neutral—
izing antibody—resistant variants was used as a surrogate for overall
genetic diversity that could not be measured by classic sequencing.
With our new approach, we were able to ascertain the variant rate
across the entire E2 sequence containing these epitopes, detecting
variants in extreme low rates. In correlation with the measured
neutralizing antibody escape in the original studies, we noticed a
significantly higher total variance in the p7 HeLa mammalian
cell passaged E2 protein (1.6603) when compared with the mamma—
lian-insect alternating passage (1.4262) (one tailed t—test,
P = 0.00004) and the starting stock virus (1.3587) (one tailed t—test,
P = 0.00018). Another powerful feature of the ViVan pipeline, is the
ease with which it allows comparing and identifying minority vari-
ants in one group of samples that are common to that group and not
found in a second group of samples. In analyzing this batch of sam—
ples, we assessed all the positions across the viral genome in which
there was a significant variant in the alternating passage sample that
had cycled through mosquito cells, which was not found in any of
the other samples (that encountered only mammalian cells) above a
rate of 0.001. We detected 396 such variants (Table 2 and
Supplementary Data 1). Interestingly, only nine variants had fre-
quencies above 1% of the total population, and the variant exhibit-
ing the highest rate (62%), was an aspargine to lysine change,
position 112 of the non—structural protein 4 (nsp4). It is tempting to
speculate that this mutation in the nsp4 polymerase may represent a
mechanism of adaptation to retain replicative capacity in disparate
hosts.

3.4 Comparing between samples in evolutionary
studies: monitoring temporal changes and emerging
variants during virus evolution

As RNA virus populations adapt to an environment, new mutations
will amplify and eventually dominate the population to change the
consensus sequence if the selective pressures remain constant over
the long—term. However, with HTS technology the emergence of
such mutations would expectedly be detectable long before

dominating the viral population, a significant improvement to both
experimental and clinical studies. As an example, the detection of
low—frequency adaptive variants in an RNA viral population prior
to and during antiretroviral drug treatment could result in more
optimized HIV treatment protocols (Najera et al., 1995). To valid—
ate ViVan in characterizing genome—wide temporal changes during
virus evolution, we sequenced samples infected by three different
coxsackie virus variants [WT, the A372V high fidelity, antimutator
strain and the S299T low fidelity, mutator strain (Levi et al., 2010)]
at three different time points (1, 60 and 120 replication cycles in
HeLa cell culture), with each series performed as biologically inde—
pendent triplicates. As with any RNA virus, we expected rapid gen—
eration of mutations throughout the viral population. We analyzed
the variant rate for each sample and performed group comparisons
based on time point and virus strain. The results demonstrated a sig—
nificantly higher variation rates in the later passages, when compar—
ing passage 1 against both passage 60 and 120, and comparing
passage 60 against passage 120 (one tailed t—test, maximal
P = 0.00016). This significant accumulation of mutations across
viral genome was observed in all three coxsackie virus strains tested
(Fig. 4) and is indicative of the temporal accumulation of variants in
the sequenced viral population, regardless of the strain’s intrinsic
replication fidelity. Further highlighting the sensitivity of this pipe-
line, the high fidelity A3 72V variant and the low fidelity S299T vari—
ant, respectively maintained lower and higher diversity throughout
the 120 replication cycles and in all triplicate series. We then asked
which variants specifically demonstrated a constant increase in rate,
as passages progressed, that could be indicative of positive selection
and could help elucidate functional determinants throughout a gen—
ome. For this purpose, we reviewed the accumulated changes in
each coxsackie virus variant (WT, A372V, S299T) over the three
time points. Using ViVan, we were able to collect all the positions
across each variant’s genome which demonstrated a progressive in—
crease in variant allele frequency. We then reviewed all the variants
that either (i) accumulated in more than one population, or (ii) accu—
mulated at the highest rate. Out of the four variants that accumu—
lated in all three virus variants (Table 3), three occurred within viral
capsid proteins VP3 and VP4, consistent with the higher evolution-
ary rates of viral structural proteins and the localization of many re-
ceptor binding and antigenic epitopes within the VP3 protein
(Carson et al., 1997, 2011). The fourth variant occurred within the
viral polymerase (3D; S452P).

Interestingly, the only accumulated variant in the viral 3B pro—
tein was found in five different population sets (all of the A372V
populations and two of the WT). Out of the variant positions,

Implementing our method on one of the CVB Wild-type samples, and re-
cording the changes throughout the passages (1, 60 and 120), the positions
demonstrating the highest increase in variant allele rate was detected. Out of
the top 10 most changing positions, only four were non-structural, one syn-
onymous in the Viral protease (3C) one nonsynonymous in 2B and two non-
synonymous in the Viral polymerase (3D). The polymerase variants were then
recognized as variants already known to modulate Viral replication ﬁdelity.

common to more than one population and having a rate >5 % in
passage 120 (n: 11; Table 4), seven were within viral capsid pro-
teins, two in 3D, one in 3A and one in 3B. The 3D mutations are the
known natural fidelity variants of the polymerase (Levi et al., 2010):
S299T, known to decrease viral replication fidelity, and A372V,
known to increase viral replication fidelity. By passage 120, the
S299T variant, accumulated to 5 and 1% of the A372V and WT
populations, respectively. A372V accumulated in all three WT
populations with an average rate of 37% at passage 120.

These observations suggest that viral populations may fine tune
their mutation rates during their infection cycles by generating
mixed populations of fidelity variants, so as to increase adaptability
(fidelity decrease) while maintaining genetic integrity (fidelity
increase).

4 Discussion

It is becoming increasingly clear that studying only the consensus se—
quence of an RNA virus insufficiently summarizes the viral popula-
tion. Often, increases in fitness and changes in adaptability are
observed without changes in the consensus sequence (Coffey et al.,
2008; Sanz—Ramos et al., 2008). This hints that minority variants
within the viral population are responsible for this effect. Virus di—
versity represents a pool of randomly generated minority variants,
available for adaptation and gradually amplified in frequency
through selection. Only with the advent of HTS has studying such
minorities become feasible but we are missing standard validated
tools to mine, analyze and compare this information from multiple
samples. Currently available tools require a high degree of computa—
tional savoir—faire, and for more detailed RNA virus population ana—
lysis, the user must write additional scripts.

Our computational pipeline has several advantages over other
methods. We use a robust algorithm, based on each variant allele’s
initial rate and read qualities, to differentiate between sequencing—
introduced errors and actual population variants, facilitating accur—
ate variant assessment even at extremely low rates. Another advan—
tage of the pipeline is the set of different outputs we provide for
analysis (Fig. 1, Supplementary Data 2). First, we provide a table of
the synonymous and non—synonymous changes for each significantly

Seven variants were Within Viral capsid proteins, two in 3D, one in 3A and one in 3B. The 3D mutations are the known natural ﬁdelity variants of the polymer-

ase: 8299T, known to decrease Viral replication ﬁdelity, and A372V, known to increase Viral replication ﬁdelity. By passage 120, the 8299T variant, accumulated
to 5% and 1% of the A372V and WT populations respectively. A3 72V accumulated in all three WT populations with an average rate of 37% at passage 120.
These observations suggest that Viral populations may ﬁne tune their mutation rates during their infection cycles by generating mixed populations of ﬁdelity vari-

ants, so as to increase adaptability (ﬁdelity decrease) while maintaining genetic integrity (ﬁdelity increase).

variable position, organized by gene and position for the whole viral
genome. Second, we provide a battery of metrics including nucleo—
tide substitution matrix, transition/transversion frequencies and
variant allele rates. We also include the consensus changes found to
be different from the original reference, enabling reconstruction of
the genuine consensus for a given sample. Third, we provide three
files with pairwise comparisons supplying the mutations found to be
different or common among samples. These outputs are rapid and
powerful, enabling comprehensive analysis of large data sets.
Importantly, we have made ViVan available and accessible for users
without computational proficiency in the virology community
through an easy—to—use web server, enabling a complete analysis
given raw deep sequencing data.

Using low fidelity CVB3 variants that generate subtle, yet bio—
logically confirmed, differences in mutant composition, we showed
that detected variation frequencies correlated with the mutation fre-
quencies obtained by molecular cloning in the original paper
(Gnadig et al., 2012). We also showed that sequence analysis of
mutagen treated virus populations can identify the specific transi-
tion/transversion footprints for three different mutagens, as well as
reveal dose—dependent effects. The increased ease and sensitivity of
this approach could help identify new compounds with antiviral mu-
tagenic activity and distinguish statistically significant changes that
would otherwise be overlooked by classic methods. This may help
answer the debate as to whether mutagens such as ribavirin have
mutagenic activity at physiological concentrations, as in the treat—
ment of chronic HCV infection (Dusheiko et al., 1996).

In addition to comparing samples from different environmental
conditions, we determined the sensitivity of the pipeline in detecting
temporal changes in minority variant composition within the same
virus population. We serially passaged wild type coxsackie, as well
as naturally occurring high (A372V) and low (S299T) fidelity strains
in a cell line to which the virus is already well adapted, to favor a
general expansion of more neutral or high fitness variants in this
highly permissive environment. Gene by gene analysis of variance
corroborated with previous data on picornaviruses, where variabil—
ity and mutation is seemingly most tolerated in the structural
proteins (P1 region) and the P3 non—structural region; while the
non—structural P2 region is less variable (Kistler et al., 2007). A very
interesting and unexpected observation was the emergence of fidel—
ity altering mutations in late passages of the wild type strain that is

generally considered to be genetically stable. Unlike other fidelity
altering mutations isolated in our lab (Gnadig et al., 2012), these
two alleles exist in some CVB3 isolates (Levi et al., 2010), but the
natural emergence of fidelity variants has not been previously
observed. That they emerge within the wild type population during
longer—term experimental evolution raises the intriguing possibility
that fidelity modulation may occur in natural settings, according to
host environment. Such modulation of fidelity would be reminiscent
of environment—dependent changes in bacterial mutation rates
(Sniegowski et al., 1997). Our method is intended for high coverage
short read data, it does not incorporate information regarding vari-
ants detected on the same read and therefore does not support
haplotype reconstruction (Eriksson et al., 2008; Zagordi et al.,
201 1). Our method is also limited to per—position analysis and there—
fore it cannot directly account for compensatory mutations. If one
wishes to identify such associated variants, we suggest an initial ana—
lysis using ViVan in order to identify significant variants followed
by a deeper assessment of the data in regards to adjacent variants
found within a read length of each other. The examples presented in
this work were performed using virus references matching the mo—
lecular clone (plasmid) that is later used to produce the viruses them—
selves. These references are extremely well characterized and serve
as a good template for variant analysis. In cases where such appro—
priate references are not available, we recommend either (i) an initial
ViVan run on the data and then a re—run using the modified consen—
sus sequence produced, or (ii) an initial assembly of the viral genome
using appropriate assembly tools (Bankevich et al., 2012; Simpson
et al., 2009; Zerbino and Birney, 2008) and using the assembled
genome as input for ViVan.

In this article, we have presented a new bioinformatic pipeline
for the study of HTS data. We hope this tool will help standardize
and facilitate the analysis of data this technology provides. As we
have illustrated with our experimental work, it can be used for stud—
ies ranging from the more practical, detection of resistant mutations
and effects of antiviral treatments, to the more theoretical temporal
characterization of the population in evolutionary studies. Our ana—
lysis pipeline provides an extremely low allele rate cut—off threshold
to determine statistically significant minority variants, as well as sev—
eral metrics and statistics on population diversity, transitions and
transversions bias, synonymous and non—synonymous mutation dis—
tributions, gene—by—gene and whole—genome analysis. Furthermore,

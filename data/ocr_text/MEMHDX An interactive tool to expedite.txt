ABSTRACT

Motivation: With the continued improvement of requisite mass spectrometers and UHPLC systems,
Hydrogen/Deuterium eXchange Mass Spectrometry (HDX-MS) workﬂows are rapidly evolving towards the
investigation of more challenging biological systems, including large protein complexes and membrane proteins. The
analysis of such extensive systems results in very large HDX-MS datasets for which speciﬁc analysis tools are
required to speed up data validation and interpretation.

Results: We introduce a web application and a new R-package named “MEMHDX” to help users analyze, validate
and Visualize large HDX-MS datasets. MEMHDX is composed of two elements. A statistical tool aids in the
validation of the results by applying a mixed-effects model for each peptide, in each experimental condition, and at
each time point, taking into account the time dependency of the HDX reaction and number of independent replicates.
Two adjusted p-Values are generated per peptide, one for the “Change in dynamics” and one for the “Magnitude of
AD”, and are used to classify the data by means of a “Logit” representation. A user-friendly interface developed with
Shiny by RStudio facilitates the use of the package. This interactive tool allows the user to easily and rapidly validate,
Visualize and compare the relative deuterium incorporation on the amino acid sequence and 3D structure, providing
both spatial and temporal information.

The use of improved HDX-MS workﬂows enables the
structural analysis of larger protein systems such as antigen-
antibody complexes (> 180 kDa) or integral membrane
proteins, in a more routine way . The characterization of
such systems results in very complex HDX-MS datasets, for
which specific non-commercial analytical software (e.g.,
HXExpress, HeXicon, EXMS, HDXFinder, etc), as well as
commercial platforms (e.g., DynamX and HDExaminer),
have been developed . Such software extract deuterium
incorporation information from (un)processed raw m/Z data
files and produce deuterium uptake curves that can pinpoint
regions of interest on protein 3D structures. However, many
of these tools do not integrate statistical approaches and use
the absolute difference of deuterium uptake to evaluate the
significance between conditions.

1. INTRODUCTION

Hydrogen Deuterium eXchange followed by Mass
Spectrometry (HDX-MS) is a biophysical tool in structural
biology capable of probing protein/ligand interactions,
conformational changes, and protein folding and dynamics .
Despite an increased number of applications , the expansion
of the technology has been slowed by its intrinsic technical
and analytical complexity (1‘. e., digestion at pH 2.5 and rapid
HPLC separation at 0°C). With recent advancements in
sample preparation robotics, refrigerated ultra-high
performance liquid chromatography systems and high
resolution mass spectrometers, HDX-MS has surged in
popularity and is now emerging from the academic benchtop
to the expanse of the pharmaceutical sector .

Hydra (or Mass Spec Studio) was the ﬁrst standalone
application to introduce a Student’s t-test and p-Values to
statistically evaluate the difference across HDX-MS
experiments Alternatively, Houde and co-workers
calculated conﬁdence limits based on the experimental
uncertainty of measuring deuterium uptake across
replicates . In this context, two distinct conﬁdence limits
were calculated manually using either the differences of
deuterium uptake, or the summed value of HDX differences
measured for each peptide, in each condition, and at each
time point. Lastly, HDX Workbench includes a two-tailed t-
test and Tukey multiple comparison procedure for the
statistical cross-comparison of two or more datasets .

Despite signiﬁcant efforts to design requisite statistical
tools, the aforementioned software solutions are suitable to
analyze HDX-MS data at one time point only, failing to
account for the time-dependency of the HDX-MS reaction.
Thus, Liu and coworkers proposed a multiple regression or
ANCOVA model . By deriving a statistical test based on the
model parameters, they evaluated the signiﬁcant difference
between two groups under comparison, for all peptides in
the dataset, and across all independent replicates.

Expanding on this, we introduce a web application

named “MEMHDX” (Mixed-Effects Model for HDX

experiments) to aid in the rapid statistical validation and
Visualization of large HDX-MS datasets. MEMHDX uses a
linear mixed-effects model where replicates are considered
as random effects. This accounts for both the time
dependency and the variability across replicates. Moreover,
instead of testing the variation in global deuterium exchange
between two experimental conditions, we propose to
calculate two individual p-Values for each peptide. Firstly,
the difference between conditions is measured (p-Value for
the “Magnitude of Delta Deuterium (AD)”), followed by the
evolution of the deuterium uptake behavior over the time
course of the experiment (p-Value for the “Change in
dynamics”). MEMHDX therefore allows the clustering of
each peptide in the dataset based on these two respective p-
values. A user-friendly interface developed with Shiny by
RStudio facilitates the use of the application, allowing the
user to easily Visualize and compare the relative deuterium
incorporation across the entire protein sequence and 3D
structure. As a test system, we used the receptor-binding
Repeat-in-ToXin (RTX) domain of CyaA produced by
Bordetella pertussis, the causative agent of whooping
cough, to pinpoint regions undergoing structural and
conformational changes upon calcium binding .

2. METHODS

The description of the MEMHDX workﬂow is reported in
Figure l. MEMHDX is composed of two independent

elements: a statistical tool written in R for the validation of
HDX results, and a web interface developed with Shiny.
Details of the mixed-effects model, the Shiny web interface
and the outputs are given below.

2.1. The MEMHDX R-package
2.1.1. The mixed-effects model

The aim was to compare the exchange behavior of a deﬁned
set of N peptides derived from the same protein placed in
two distinct states. The incorporation was measured at T
time points (t1,...,tT) for all peptides in both biological
conditions, and the experiment was repeated R times. Ya)”
corresponds to the deuterium incorporation value measured
for peptide E (GE {Lu-lNZ'r), at each time point E (
EE {lu-uﬂ), for each replicate T (TE {Ln-JR?!) and

condition i (i E {L 2}), and can be calculated using:

I’m-L11: = M _ MD,

M = [{c :1: 2:] — 2.1mm“,

MD : [{E K 3:] _ E]EIIL1.-Jt=np

where M and M0 correspond to the mass of the labeled and
unlabeled peptide, 0 represents the extracted centroid value
(m/Z), and Z the peptide charge. Thus, we consider the
following linear mixed-effects model:

Faint =|3rxxt+ lgi':":-"f-1"'|3ri'K Itii+uﬁ=€wr+5

where Emma: is the vector of observations {Fa-Ln: mt, ﬁt, [3,

and Bit correspond to the vectors of ﬁxed effects for the
time, the condition and the interaction between time and
condition, 1!: the vector of random effects (i.e., replicates),
and E the vector of random errors. In our model, the time t,
the condition i, and the interaction between t and i are
considered as ﬁxed effects. The condition and the
interaction represent the two parameters of interest. The
replicates are considered as a random effect.

2. 1.2. The statistical inference

The “nmle” R package was utilized to estimate the vectors
of ﬁxed effects ([3) and ur (http://CRANR-
project.org/package=nlme). The restricted maximum
likelihood method was used to ﬁt the linear mixed-effects
model. To evaluate the statistical signiﬁcance of the

Fig. 1. The MEMHDX strategy. A .csv ﬁle containing deuterium uptake values for all identiﬁed peptides is exported after raw data extraction and analysis by
dedicated HDX-MS software (e. g., DynamX). The .csv ﬁle is uploaded to MEMHDX where a linear mixed-effects model is applied to statistically validate the
dataset. Main results are displayed on a “Logit” representation (for data clustering and validation) and Visualized using a global summary plot and the 3D structure,

condition and the interaction on the rate of deuterium
incorporation of the protein, two p-Values were calculated
per peptide, using two individual Wald tests. The condition-
associated p-Value (hereafter referred to as p-
ValueMagmtude_0f_Delta_D) tests the null hypothesis of there being
no difference in deuterium uptake between condition 1 and
2; the interaction-associated p-Value (hereafter referred to as
p-ValueChange_m_dynamics) tests the null hypothesis of there being
no change in the deuterium uptake behavior between
condition 1 and 2 and takes into account the time
dependency of the HDX reaction (see Comment 1 of
Supplementary Material). A multiple testing procedure was
applied to adjust the signiﬁcance level of each Wald test. In
this work, the False Discovery Rate (FDR) criterion was
used instead of the classical familywise error rate to achieve
higher statistical power .

2.2. User interface and data output
2.2.1.

To facilitate the use of the MEMHDX R-package, a user-
friendly interactive web interface was developed with Shiny
by RStudio (http://shiny.rstudio.com). The “Start analysis”
window (Supplementary Figure 1A) contains a short
reminder of the main variables required in the input .csv ﬁle,
i.e., the sequence and position of each peptide in the protein,
charge state Z, extracted centroid m/Z values for each time
point and replicate and in each condition, exposure time
(min), number of replicates, and the maximum number of
exchangeable amide hydrogens (MaxUptake) that could be
theoretically replaced into the peptide. MaxUptake
corresponds to the number of amino acid residues contained
in the peptide, minus the number of proline residues and
minus one for the N—terminus that back-exchanges too
rapidly to be measured . Once the .csv ﬁle is loaded, the
system informs the user of any missing variables. Missing
centroid m/Z values are allowed; in such a scenario, they are
automatically replaced by the mean value across all
replicates.

The “Start analysis” window

Before starting any analysis, two user-deﬁned
parameters must be deﬁned: the statistical signiﬁcance value
(%) corresponding to the desired stringency of the analysis,
and the percentage of deuterium (D) contained in the ﬁnal
labeling solution (Supplementary Figure 1A). The latter is
used to calculate the Relative Fractional Uptake (RFU)
values. MEMHDX automatically generates RFU values as
follows:

Falter

RFU = —]i
‘1 mﬂptokaﬂxﬂ

where Yam corresponds to the deuterium incorporation
value measured for peptide II at each time point t. RFU can
be Viewed as normalized deuterium uptake values (i. e., the
number of incorporated deuterium becomes independent of
the length of the peptide) and are utilized to generate the
global Visualization charts.

2.2.2. Data output

Once processing is complete, the “HDX-MS Results” panel
appears below the “Start analysis” window. This is
composed of six independent tabs, namely Raw Data,
Peptide Plot, Logit Plot, Global Visualization, 3D Structure
and Summary.

The “Raw Data” tab lists all the variables included in the
.csv ﬁle. The “Peptide Plot” tab (Supplementary Figure
1B1) allows the user to control the quality of the ﬁtted
model for each peptide and to evaluate the reproducibility
across replicates. The “Logit Plot” tab summarizes the main
statistical results (Supplementary Figure 1B2). This is
divided into three sections. The “plot options” section is
used to adjust the options of the plot (size points, max
distance in pixels) and the export. The center area displays
the “Logit” representation, where each dot represents one
individual peptide. The Logit function of the two p-Values
deﬁnes the position of each peptide in the graph. The red
lines correspond to the statistical signiﬁcance threshold for
the “Magnitude of AD” (vertical line), and for the “Change

3

in dynamics” (horizontal line), thus dividing the “Logit”
Plot into four regions (Supplementary Figure 1B2): peptides
only statistically signiﬁcant for the “Change in dynamics” or
the “Magnitude of AD” are located in the “a” and “b”
region, respectively; statistically signiﬁcant peptides in both
states are clustered in the “c” region; statistically non-
signiﬁcant peptides are displayed in the “(1” region. The
“Logit” Viewing mode of MEMHDX provides a rapid and
effective way to discriminate statistically signiﬁcant from
non-signiﬁcant peptides and to classify each based on their
respective HDX behavior. The ﬁnal section appears at the
bottom of the “Logit” screen after selection of an individual
peptide in the “Logit” representation (not shown).
MEMHDX automatically displays a summary table
containing the mean incorporation (in Da) per time point,
and state, and associated “Logit” values. This summary
table can be exported into a .csv format. The identity of each
peptide (i.e., sequence, position and deuterium uptake
curves) appears below the “Logit” plot when the mouse
cursor is hovered over a dot.

The “Global Visualization” and the “3D Structure” tabs
are dedicated to the Visualization of the HDX data and
contain two sections (Supplementary Figures 1B3, 1B4).
The left section allows the user to navigate through the
different parameter options. The right section of the “Global
Visualization” summarizes the deuterium uptake behavior
observed in the two states (Supplementary Figure 1B3,
upper and middle charts). The RFU values calculated by
MEMHDX are plotted as a function of peptide position. In
addition, the lower chart plots the difference in RFU
between state 1 and 2, providing a more quantitative
assessment of the difference between states. Statistically
signiﬁcant peptides are highlighted in gray. The right
section of the “3D Structure” tab displays the mapping of
the HDX results on the crystal structure of the protein
(Supplementary Figure 1B4). Finally, the “Summary” tab
recaps the different parameters used by MEMHDX to
perform the statistical analysis and includes an export option
for both the raw data and statistically relevant results (not
shown).

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

MEMHDX was developed to complement the HDX-MS
pipeline commercialized by Waters Corporation. The
software is fully compatible with the main output generated
by DynamX (i.e., cluster data), but has been designed to
handle data from any HDX-MS platform, as long as the
input ﬁle is structured in .csv format and with the
appropriate architecture, i.e., columns listed in Panel 1 of
Supplementary Figure 1A.

MEMHDX was evaluated using our recently published
differential HDX-MS dataset generated with the C-terminal
Repeat-in-toxin Domain (RD, 701 residues) of the CyaA
toxin . Brieﬂy, we used HDX to identify and locate
secondary structural elements in the intrinsically disordered

Apo-RD protein, and followed its transition to a more
compact and folded state upon calcium binding. In total, 13
experimental time points were selected, and all data was
collected in triplicate.

3.1. Pre-processing and dataset quality control

A total of 602 peptic peptides of RD were identiﬁed by
ProteinLynX Global Server (Waters Corporation) using the
default search parameters, of which 198 remained after
ﬁltering by DynamX. Following this, 162 were selected for
HDX analysis and covered 98.4% of the RD sequence
(Supplementary Figure 2). Considering 162 peptides, 1
charge state, 3 replicates, 14 time points (including the
unlabeled control) and 2 conditions, we have up to 13,608
unique data points in the complete test dataset. This
demonstrates the complexity of datasets acquired using
modern HDX-MS pipelines, the processing and
interpretation of which is extremely challenging and time-
consuming by traditional, manual means.

The current version of MEMHDX can only handle one
unique charge state per peptide. A pre-processing step is
required by the user to select the most appropriate charge
state for analysis. The quality determination of the dataset is
directly accomplished by MEMHDX. A Box and Whisker
plot displaying the agreement across replicates is
automatically generated (Supplementary Figure 1B1). For
each peptide, the calculated deuterium uptake values (Yam)
are averaged across all time points in each respective state.
This comparison is possible as each replicate is considered
as an independent variable. A scoring function (log-
1ike1ihood) is determined per peptide to easily control the
quality of the ﬁtting. MEMHDX includes a ﬁltering option
to sort each peptide according to this score and to remove
those with a low ﬁtting quality from the analysis.

3.2. Statistical analysis and peptide clustering

A central feature of MEMHDX lies in its ability to classify
peptides based on their respective HDX behaviors.
MEMHDX automatically summarizes and displays the
statistical results by means of a “Logit” representation. Two
adjusted p-Values are calculated by the software and deﬁne
the position of each peptide in the “Logit” plot (Figure 2A).
On the one hand, the magnitude of AD-associated p-Value
deﬁnes the magnitude of difference of deuterium uptake
between the two states investigated, while on the other; the
change in dynamics-associated p-Value describes the
timewise evolution of HDX behavior between states.
Considering the magnitude of AD only, the signiﬁcance
increases (i.e., p-Value decreases) as the peptide position
moves from right to left on the plot, due to the greater
magnitude of change observed between states. Similarly, the
signiﬁcance of change in dynamics increases as the peptide
position moves from top to bottom. Deuterium uptake
curves for selected peptides are displayed in Figure 2B to

Fig. 2. Example of statistical results generated with MEMHDX.
(A) “Logit” plot obtained with RD. The effect of calcium binding
on the deuterium uptake behavior was measured on 162 RD
peptides. Each dot corresponds to one unique peptide. Peptides are
classiﬁed and color-coded based on their respective HDX
behavior: peptides showing dynamic events in both the Apo- and
Holo-state are colored in gray; peptides only dynamic in the Apo-
or Holo-state are colored in red and blue; non-dynamic peptides in
both states are colored in green. The statistical signiﬁcance
threshold was set to 1%. (B) Deuterium uptake curves for selected
peptides in the Apo- (open circles) and H010- (ﬁlled squares)

right-hand comer (e. g., peptide 349-365). Statistically
signiﬁcant peptides for the magnitude of AD only are found
at the top of the plot (e. g., peptide 395-401), whereas those
signiﬁcant for the change in dynamics only are plotted on
the far right (not applicable to this dataset). Those peptides
which are signiﬁcant for both states are located in the center
of the plot. Comparing peptides 395-401, 499-506 and 246-
260 allows us to easily Visualize the effect of a change in the
magnitude of AD- or the change in dynamics-associated p-
value. Peptides 395-401 and 499-506 possess the same
magnitude of AD-associated p-Value, but are separated by
their differing change in dynamics-associated p-Value. This
difference is directly linked to the change of HDX behavior
observed in peptide 499-506 in the presence of calcium,
which is not observed in the other peptide (Figure 2B).
Conversely, peptides 499-506 and 246-260 differ only by

their magnitude of AD-associated p-Value because the
magnitude of difference between states is less for the
former, than the latter.

MEMHDX enables the user to color code all peptides in
each state based on their respective HDX behavior (Figure
2A). Dynamic peptides in two states are colored in gray
(e. g., peptide 5 87-594), whereas those which are dynamic in
one or the other state are colored in red or blue [Apo-RD
(e.g., peptide 633-639) in red, and Holo-RD (e.g., peptide
499-506) in blue herein]. Non-dynamic peptides are colored
in green (e. g., peptide 395-401). Results generated with
MEMHDX were compared to those manually obtained for
RD . Excellent agreement was observed between the
automated software and the manual approach. However, the
speed of analysis was greatly increased by MEMHDX and
the validation completed in one full day (10 to 15 sec to
generate the statistical results by the software, followed by
several hours of user interpretation), compared to up-to two
weeks by manual analysis. Visually speaking, the difference
in deuterium uptake between the two states was too small to
be considered as signiﬁcant in the manual analysis of some
peptides. With the introduction of two independent p-Values,
the sensitivity of MEMHDX over the manual approach is
enhanced. This is apparent for RD region 1-25, where
segment l6-25 was considered as non-signiﬁcant in the
manual analysis, whereas was found to be statistically
relevant by MEMHDX (Figures 3A and B). This illustrates
the advantages of our automated MEMHDX approach over
manual means.

3.3. Global and 3D Visualization

MEMHDX integrates two Visualization tools to facilitate the
interpretation of the HDX results. The “global Visualization”
tool contains two distinct plots. The relative fractional
uptake plot enables the user to directly Visualize and
compare the relative deuterium uptake and the exchange
behavior of each peptide across the entire protein sequence,
providing both spatial and temporal information (Figure
3A). Using this representation, the regions of the RD-protein
containing residual structural elements in the Apo-state or
acquiring secondary structures in the Holo-state, are easily
identiﬁed. The second plot displays the difference in relative
fractional uptake between the two states (Figure 3B). A high
uptake difference indicates that the peptide incorporates
more deuterium in state 1 than in state 2 and vice versa. This
is the case for peptide 203-209 of RD, which incorporates
more deuterium in the Apo-state than in the Holo-state,
indicative of a calcium-induced protective effect (Figure
3B). In addition, the statistical results are reported on the
differential uptake plot. Statistically non-signiﬁcant peptides
are highlighted in white, whereas those displaying
signiﬁcant p-Values in gray.

The second Visualization tool allows the mapping of the
HDX results on the 3D structure of the protein (Figures 3C
and D). The user can either download a PDB ﬁle or enter the

Fig. 3. HDX-MS results visualized by MEMHDX. (A) Global Visualization plots of RD in both the Apo- and Holo-state. The Relative
Fractional Uptake values are plotted as a function of peptide position. This representation allows the user to Visualize the deuterium uptake
behavior of each peptide across the entire protein sequence. (B) Fractional Uptake Difference plot showing the variations of deuterium uptake
between Apo- and Holo-RD. A high uptake difference value corresponds to a large calcium-induced protective effect, while a low value is
indicative of a weak effect. Signiﬁcant peptides are highlighted in gray. The statistical signiﬁcance threshold was set to 1%. (C and D) Mapping
of the HDX results on the model of RD using the 3D-structural tool of MEMHDX. RD is shown as a cartoon or in a space ﬁlling model. Regions
experiencing deuterium uptake or dynamic changes upon calcium binding are colored in cyan; regions with no change are colored in red.

Protein DataBank identiﬁer of the protein. In this scenario,
MEMHDX will automatically retrieve and display the
structure from the protein databank archive. Differential
exchange behaviors will be color-coded to distinguish
modiﬁed from unmodiﬁed regions (Figures 3C and D).

4. CONCLUSIONS

MEMHDX is a statistical tool designed to aid in the analysis
of large HDX-MS datasets. The initial concept of the
software was to complement the HDX-MS solution
provided by Waters Corporation, which is to-date, the only
complete automated pipeline commercially available. The
use of two distinct p-Values in the handling of HDX-MS
data introduces a novel way to interpret and classify HDX
results. This was successfully demonstrated here with the
analysis of the RD protein from the adenylate cyclase toxin.

In this regard, the validation of the complete RD dataset was
signiﬁcantly expedited, taking only one day with
MEMHDX, compared to up to two weeks when performed
manually. The current version of the software allows for the
comparison of two unique conditions using only one unique
charge state. As a future perspective, the software will be
enhanced to allow for the comparison of multiple
conditions, using multiple charge states.

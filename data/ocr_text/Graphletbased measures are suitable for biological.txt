ABSTRACT

Motivation: Large amounts of biological network data exist for many
species. Analogous to sequence comparison, network comparison
aims to provide biological insight. Graphlet-based methods are prov-
ing to be useful in this respect. Recently some doubt has arisen
concerning the applicability of graphlet-based measures to low edge
density networks—in particular that the methods are ‘unstable’—and
further that no existing network model matches the structure found in
real biological networks.

Results: We demonstrate that it is the model networks themselves
that are ‘unstable’ at low edge density and that graphlet-based meas-
ures correctly reflect this instability. Furthermore, while model network
topology is unstable at low edge density, biological network topology
is stable. In particular, one must distinguish between average density
and local density. While model networks of low average edge densities
also have low local edge density, that is not the case with protein—
protein interaction (PPI) networks: real PPI networks have low average
edge density, but high local edge densities, and hence, they (and thus
graphlet-based measures) are stable on these networks. Finally,
we use a recently devised non-parametric statistical test to demon-
strate that PPI networks of many species are well-fit by several models
not previously tested. In addition, we model several viral PPI networks
for the first time and demonstrate an exceptionally good fit between
the data and theoretical models.

1 INTRODUCTION

Networks are used to represent relationships in molecular biol-
ogy, such as those between genes in gene regulatory networks
and proteins in protein—protein interaction (PPI) networks.
A PPI network models the physical bindings between types of
proteins in a cell, where a node represents a type of protein and
an undirected edge exists between two nodes if the corresponding
two proteins can physically bind to each other. The network of
all such interactions in a species has been dubbed the interac-
tome, and understanding its structure is an integral step towards
understanding cellular systems.

Recent advances in the experimental determination of PPI
networks, such as yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening

et al., 2000; Rual et al., 2005; Simonis, 2009; Stelzl et al., 2005;
Uetz et al., 2000) and mass spectrometry (MS) of puriﬁed
complexes (Gavin et al., 2002, 2006; Krogan et al., 2006;
Rigaut et al., 1999) have provided an abundance of network
data. As these PPI networks are large and complex, it is neces-
sary to develop efﬁcient and biologically meaningful algorithms
for their analysis. Because exactly solving many graph analysis
problems is computationally intractable, heuristic and approxi-
mate methods must be devised.

Systematic measures of structure (also called topology) of large
networks based on graphlets (small induced subgraphs of large
networks), have been introduced (Priulj, 2007; Priulj et al.,
2004). One is based on comparing graphlet frequencies between
two networks and is termed relative graphlet frequency (RGF)
distance (PrZulj et al., 2004). The other is based on comparing
graphlet degree distributions (GDDs) between two networks and
the agreement in GDDs of two networks is measured (Priulj,
2007). Both allow quantiﬁcation of similarity between the
topology of two data networks (e.g. between two species), or
comparison of a data network with a theoretically derived
model network. Fourteen PPI networks of eukaryotic organisms
were compared with four different random network models and
the ﬁt between the PPI and model networks has been assessed
(Priulj, 2007; Priulj et al., 2004).

The use of graphlet-based measures for network comparison
has been questioned (Rito et al., 2010) owing to the measures
being ‘unstable’ in regions of low edge density. Empirical
distributions of these scores were calculated and a novel
non-parametric test for assessing the statistical signiﬁcance of
the ﬁt between real PPI networks and theoretical models was
introduced. The study found that none of the PPI networks of
yeast and human that were considered were well-ﬁt by the three
theoretical models that were tested.

After a discussion of methods, this article is designed to lead
the reader through the following observations. First, that RGF
distance and GDD agreement (GDDA) are not unstable meas-
ures for low edge density networks, but instead that they
correctly detect the statistically high variance in network struc-
ture that is present in low-density model networks. Second, that
this high variability [described as ‘instability’ by Rito et al.
(2010)] is present in low-density model networks, but neither in
real PPI networks nor in the model networks needed to correctly
represent them. Third, that current PPI networks are denser than
those studied by Rito et al. (2010) and are well outside the highly
variable low-density region. Fourth, that the highly variable
region shrinks with increasing network size and is of negligible

test proposed by Rito et al. (2010) to demonstrate that PPI
networks of many species are well-ﬁt by several existing network
models.

2 METHODS

2.1 Graphs and graphlets

A network or graph G(V,E) consists of a set V of n nodes and a set
E g V X V of m edges connecting them. Because the maximum number
of edges is ( > = n(n — 1)/ 2, we deﬁne the edge density of G as m/ 

n
2
The number of edges touching a node is called its degree; the node at the
other end of an edge is called a neighbour. The degree distribution of G,
DDg, is deﬁned by DDG(k), which is the number of nodes in G having
degree k.

A subgraph of G is a graph whose nodes and edges belong to G. A
subgraph S of graph G is induced if S contains all edges that appear in G
over the same subset of nodes. A graphlet is a small, connected and
induced subgraph of a larger network (Przulj et al., 2004). Figure 1
depicts all 29 of the possible graphlets that have 2, 3, 4 and 5 nodes.
Within each graphlet, some nodes are topologically identical to each
other; such identical nodes are said to belong to the same automorphism
orbit. Figure 1 shows the 73 different automorphism orbits among the 29
graphlets [see Przulj (2007) for details].

Graphlets have been used to measure similarity of structure of PPI
networks and network models (Priulj, 2007; Przulj et al., 2004) resulting
in the proposition of mechanistic models by which these networks have
evolved (Przulj and Higham, 2006; Przulj et al., 2010). Also, they have
been used to align PPI networks of different species and transfer anno-
tation to unannotated parts of these networks, as well as to reconstruct
phylogeny from network alignment scores (Kuchaiev et al., 2010;
Kuchaiev and Przulj, 2011; Milenkovic et al., 2010a; Memisevic and
Priulj, 2012). Furthermore, they have been used to measure the structure
around proteins in the human PPI network that resulted in phenotypi-
cally validated predictions of new members of melanin production path-
ways purely from the PPI network topology (Ho et al., 2010; Milenkovic
et al., 2010b).

2.2 PPI networks

We analyse eight PPI networks of four eukaryotes and 10 PPI networks
of prokaryotes and viruses (Table 1): Homo sapiens (human),
Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast), Caenorhabditis elegans (nematode
worm) and Drosophila melanogaster (fruit ﬂy), and Arabidopsis

orbits are numbered from 0 to 72, and the nodes belonging to the same
orbit are of the same shade within a graphlet (Przulj, 2007)

(Arabidopsis Interactome Mapping Consortium, 2011). Here, HS is the
human PPIs reported by Stelzl et al. (2005), and HG is the human PPIs
reported by Rual et al. (2005); these two PPI networks were analysed
both by Przulj (2007) and Rito et al. (2010), and they are the ﬁrst Y2H
studies of the human interactome and hence are incomplete. HH is the
human PPI network downloaded from HPRD version 9, released in April
2010 (Peri et al., 2004). HR is the human PPI network collected by
Radivojac et al. (2008). Finally, HB, WB, FE and YB are the PPI
networks of human, worm, fruit ﬂy and yeast, respectively, obtained
from BioGRID version 3.1.74, released in March 2011 (Stark et al.,
2006). Viral PPI networks are from Fossum et al. (2009) and are
described in Section 3.6. Bacterial PPI networks include CJJ
(Campylobacter jejuni), ECL (Escherichia coli), SPP (Synechocystis sp.
PCC6803) and MZL (Mesorhizobium loti). All self-loops, duplicate inter-
actions and interspecies interactions were removed from the PPI data, as
we consider only simple undirected graphs.

2.3 Random network models

We brieﬂy review the random network models discussed in this article.
An Erdo‘s—Rényi (ER) random graph (Erdos and Rényi, 1959, 1960) is
generated by ﬁxing the number of nodes n in the network, and adding
edges uniformly at random until a given density is reached. An ER—DD
model is an ER model in which we force the degree distribution to be the
same as that of a data network. Scale-free (SF) networks are those in
which the degree distribution follows a power law (Barabasi and Albert,
1999). SF-GD networks are scale-free networks based on a gene dupli-
cation model (Vazquez et al., 2003). If the degree distribution is the same
as the data and the data are SF, we get a special case of an ER—DD model
called random SF (SF-RND).

A geometric graph (Penrose, 2003) is one in which each node in the
network represents a point in space and nodes are joined if their corres-
ponding points are closer than some ﬁxed global constant r. In this
article, the geometric random networks (GEO) that we generate have
their points distributed uniformly at random in Euclidean space.
GEO-GD graphs are geometric graphs in which the points are distributed
according to a gene duplication model (Przulj et al., 2010).

Stability of graphlet-based measures

 

Finally, the STICKY model is based on a stickiness index that is pro-
portional to the degree of a node in a real network (Przqu and Higham,
2006). It is based on the assumption that the higher the degrees of two
nodes, the more likely they are to be neighbours.

2.3.1 The utility of model networks

‘In the further development of science, we want more than just a for-
mula. First we have an observation, then we have numbers that we
measure, then we have a law which summarizes all the numbers. But
the real glory of science is that we can ﬁnd a way of thinking such that
the law becomes evident.’—Richard P. Feynman, winner of the 1965
Nobel Prize in physics (Feynman, 1963).

We have been asked several times by biologists, including reviewers of
our articles, why modelling biological networks is important and what
models might teach us. It is easiest to answer this question by providing
an example of another science in which models have become vitally
important: physics.

Models provide us a way to think about a system in such a way that we
can understand its behaviour; more importantly, a precise theoretical
model allows us to predict a system’s behaviour, so that we can learn
how it reacts without having to experiment haphazardly on the system.
For example, without a precise and predictive theory of gravity, we would
not be able to understand the motion of planets, stars and galaxies, and
NASA would not be able to launch robotic probes to the planets.

A ﬁrst step towards understanding biological networks is to develop
mathematical models of their structure; these models may not yet have
predictive value, but they have descriptive value, in the same way that
detailed descriptions of observations of movement of planets centuries
ago provided data for Newton to develop a predictive theory of gravity.
Biological network data today are noisy and incomplete, so the network
structure may be hidden by noise and adversely ﬁltered by sampling,
population averaging and other biases in data collection, handling and
interpretation (Collins et al., 2007; Hakes et al., 2008; Han et al., 2005;
Stumpf et al., 2005; von Mering et al., 2002). At this point in the devel-
opment of structural models of biological networks, we cannot gain a
detailed theoretical understanding of the networks. At best, we can try to
measure statistical properties and develop models that have similar stat-
istical properties to the real networks. Even this is an extremely difﬁcult
task. For one thing, graph theory tells us that large graphs can be almost
inﬁnitely complex in their structure; the number of undirected graphs
with n nodes scales as 0(2"("‘1)/2), which is a function that grows
almost unimaginany fast. For example, the number of graphs with 22
nodes is already comparable with the number of atoms in the observable
universe (~1080); the number of graphs with 1000 nodes is ~10150000.

Given these formidable difﬁculties, our goal at this juncture is not to
ﬁnd ‘the’ model that ﬁts the data—that is hopeless. Instead our goal should
be simply to aim the development of our models in the right direction.

2.4 GDD agreement

The notion of the degree has been generalized to graphlet degree (Priulj,
2007). In particular, the standard degree of a node u counts how many
edges it touches; in turn, the graphlet degree of u is a vector of 73 integers
counting how many times u is centered on each of the automorphism
orbits depicted in Figure 1. The degree distribution over degrees k of a
graph is a distribution of how many nodes have degree k, i.e. touch k
edges; in turn, a GDD is an analogous distribution for an automorphism
orbit, e.g. the GDD corresponding to orbit 3 in Figure 1 measures how
many nodes touch k triangles for each value of k. Hence, there are 73
GDDs for graphlets with up to ﬁve nodes; the ﬁrst one of them is the
degree distribution. More speciﬁcally, let G be a given graph. For each of
the 73 automorphism orbits j shown in Figure 1, we denote by 612(k) the
number of nodes in G that are touched k times by a corresponding

graphlet at its orbit j. Because a dense graph tends to have a large graph-
let degree for large values of k, we ﬁrst downweight the graphlet degree
by 1/k and then normalize, giving the normalized graphlet degree for
automorphism orbit j,

NJ'G(k) = M (1)

21:1 d[G(l)/l
For a particular automorphism orbit j, we can compare the orbit j degree
distributions of two networks G and H by treating the normalized degree
for orbit j as a vector in degree space (that has dimension equal to the
largest degree). We compute the Euclidean distance between these two

vectors as
1

00 2
MG, H) = \if (Z [Man — WW) (2)
2 k=1
where the 1/x/2 is a normalization constant that ensures the distance is
always <1 (Przulj, 2010). Finally, we subtract each distance from 1 to get
an ‘agreement’ instead of a distance, and sum over all the 73 values of j to
get the GDDA

72
GDDA(G, H) = % Z (1 — D’(G, H)) (3)
1:0

If two networks G and H have a GDDA close to 1, then G and H have
similar topology in the sense that their GDDs, scaled appropriately to
their network size, are statistically similar.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 GDDA is sensitive, not unstable

A concern that ‘GDDA has a pronounced dependency on the
number of edges and vertices of the networks being considered’
and that the ‘GDDA score is not stable in the region of graph
density relevant to current PPI networks’ has been expressed
(Rito et al., 2010). Figure 2 illustrates the point: it depicts the
dependency of GDDA on edge density when comparing two
model networks with each other. The abrupt drop and ragged-
ness of the GDDA curve at low densities is what was referred to
as ‘unstable GDDA’.

It is crucial to distinguish between a measure being unstable,
versus a measure that correctly detects when the structure of a
network is highly variable. We maintain that GDDA (and RGF
distance, although space limitations preclude a discussion) faith-
fully detects genuine differences between the structure of various
networks, thus making them of the latter sort. For example,
consider two networks that have eight nodes and four edges
each. The ﬁrst consists of four isolated edges, while the other
consists of one square and four isolated nodes. We can rightfully
say that the two networks are different from each other, and
both RGF distance and GDDA would detect this fact. Thus
we see that it is not the measure that is unstable but the network
structure itself. The measure simply reﬂects this ‘instability’ in
networks with a relatively small number of edges.

Thus, although it is true that GDDA has an abrupt drop at
low edge density, we believe that this drop is due to network
properties having a statistically high variance at low edge densi-
ties. This high variance is evident in Figure 2, where the 10 error
bars are signiﬁcantly larger at low densities than they are at high
densities. This high variance in turn causes a low agreement
when comparing two model networks that have low edge densi-
ties with each other. At higher edge densities, the statistical

by color into kingdoms. As can be seen, in all cases the data networks are outside of the sensitive region for both ER and GEO models

properties of two model networks become more similar, resulting
in a higher GDDA.

A simple analogy would be an experiment in which a fair coin
is ﬂipped n times in an attempt to experimentally determine the
probability of heads. If n = 0, then both experiments will agree in
whatever ‘assumed’ probability is assigned a priori (analogous to
GDDA = 1 at zero edge density). If n is ﬁnite but small, then two
experiments are likely to come up with substantially different
estimates of the probability of heads, neither being close to the
true value of 0.5. (This corresponds to the drop in GDDA at low
but ﬁnite edge density.) However, as n —> co, the law of large
numbers ensures that both experiments will provide similar
estimates, both being close to 0.5. (This corresponds to the
‘recovery’ of GDDA as density increases.) Model networks
differ from this analogy in that even as n —> co, the statistical
difference between two models remains ﬁnite rather than ap-
proaching zero.

3.2 The unstable region is small in large networks, and
natural networks have densities outside this region

We wish to quantify the extent of the ‘unstable’ region to decide
if a given network has a density in the ‘unstable’ density region.

The discussion associated with Figure 3 of Rito et al. (2010)
makes it clear that the unstable region they refer to spans the
density range [0, 0.01] for ER graphs with 500 nodes, and the
range [0, 0.005] for GEO graphs with 500 nodes. Consider our
Figure 2c. [The same analysis can be done on Figure 3b of Rito
et al. (2010)]. It is clear that the minimum GDDA score for GEO
graphs occurs at a density that is proportional to k1 /n for some
value of k1, where n is the number of nodes in the graph.
Furthermore, the ‘recovery’ referred to by Rito et al. (2010)
occurs at a density proportional to kg/n for some value of k2.
This scaling is also apparent for all models if we observe
Figure 2a and b: when going from panel (a) to (b) we double
the number of nodes, simultaneously cut in half the extent of the
horizontal axis and yet the two ﬁgures look similar. When
discussing their Figure 3, Rito et al. (2010) say the unstable
region for a 500 node GEO graph spans the density region
,0 6 [0,0005]. From this we infer that k2 % 2.5 for GEO
graphs. A similar analysis of our Figures 2a and b and 3a of
Rito et al. (2010) suggests k2 % 5 for ER graphs. Thus, in gen-
eral, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the unstable region spans
the density region ,0 e [0, k2 / n] for some value of k2 that depends
on the network model but is likely in the range kg 6 [2,5]. In any

Fig. 4. GDDA is robust with respect to noise. In particular, we see that adding, deleting or rewiring as many as 60% of the edges in the model networks
has little effect on which model best ﬁts the data. Thus, conclusions about which models better ﬁt the data are relatively insensitive to the fact that
real-world network data contain substantial amounts of noise. Legend: YB 2 Yeast; FB 2 Fly; HB = Human

case, it is important to note that the width of the unstable region in
density space asymptotically shrinks with increasing n.

Even small real-world networks, such as the viral ones that
will be discussed later in reference to Figure 6, have densities
outside the unstable region. In particular, Figure 2 depicts the
density of viral networks (green vertical lines in Figure 2a and b)
are in the ‘stable’ region, regardless of the assumed theoretical
model.

Figure 3 demonstrates a similar effect for larger networks.
We plot a surface depicting the dependency of GDDA on the
number of nodes n and the density ,0 for two types of model
networks, ER and GEO. We also place each of the non-viral
PPI networks from Table 1 in the (n, ,0) plane. As can be seen,
none of these PPI networks are in the ‘unstable’ region of ER or
GEO models. Note that the instability region and shape is
different for different models; for example, the unstable region
of GEO model is much smaller than the one of ER model with
the same graph size and density. Furthermore, real PPI networks
are not ER [e. g. Przulj et al. (2004); Przulj (2007); also Figure 6].

We note that GDDA can be sensitive to noise, whereas
conclusions about network ﬁt using GDDA are robust to
noise. Figure 4 depicts how GDDA responds when we add,
delete and rewire up to 60% of the edges in the model networks.
We note that as noise is added, GDDA generally (though not
always) decreases. However, the ordering of which model best ﬁts
the data undergoes only small changes when noise is added
because all the curves generally have a negative slope, indicating
that the ordering of models on the horizontal axis remains the
correct ordering of model ﬁt, independent of noise level. Noise
has also been extensively discussed previously (Han et al., 2005;
Kuchaiev et al., 2009; Stumpf et al., 2005; Przulj, 2007; Przulj
et al., 2004).

As can be seen in Table 1, the largest PPI networks have
thousands of nodes and tens of thousands of edges. Assuming
a value of kg 6 [2, 5], we see that most of the real-world networks
in Table 1 have average densities higher than 4/n, and all have
average densities above 3 / n. Because natural networks also tend
to have local densities higher than this [see our Section 3.4 as
well as Colak et al. (2009); Przulj et al. (2004); Gibson and
Goldberg (2011)], they almost certainly are stable to GDDA
measures.

We conclude that for large networks of substantial density, the
width of the sensitive region is negligible, and that for even small
networks that are relatively complete, their density is outside of
the unstable region. This effect was not apparent in the studies
performed by Rito et al. (2010) because (i) they neglected to look
at fairly small but complete networks such as viral ones, (ii) they
restricted the size of their model networks to just 2000 nodes and
did not study how the unstable region shrinks with increasing n
and (iii) they neglected to take into account that local densities
may be higher (see Section 3.4 below).

3.3 Effect of more up-to-date PPI data

For yeast, Rito et al. (2010) analysed the earliest Y2H data (Ito
et al., 2000) with only ~800 nodes and edges, along with an early
MS-based high conﬁdence PPI network (von Mering et al., 2002)
with ~1000 nodes and 2500 edges. For human, they used the
initial Y2H screens of Stelzl et al. (2005) and Rual et al. (2005)
with only ~1700 and 3000 nodes and 3000 and 6700 edges, re-
spectively. All these data are not only out-of-date now, it was
out-of-date at the time Rito et al. (2010) did their study. It is of
signiﬁcantly lower density than more recently available
networks, even networks that were available at the time of
publication of Rito et al. (2010). They also used the current
human PPI data from BioGRID, but split it up into two sub-
networks, one with only PPIs from MS-based experiments
and the other with only PPIs from Y2H experiments. By doing
this, they decreased coverage and density of the currently
available human PPI network, hence increasing false negative
rate in each of the two subnetworks they constructed. Figure 5
depicts a timeline of data available from the year 2000 until
the present, including data that were available signiﬁcantly
before the publication date of Rito et al. (2010) but not used
by them.

3.4 Natural networks have high local densities in which
GDDA is stable

We must distinguish between average and local density. Rito
et al. (2010) used random model networks with the same average
density of the data. However, data networks have local densities
much higher than a uniformly dense random ER or GEO

To the left of the double vertical line, we reproduce parts of Tables 2 and 3 from (Rito et al., 2010). These numbers represent the approximate edge density at which Rito et al.
(2010) expect one graphlet of the type speciﬁed in column 1 to appear in a model network of either ER (columns 2 and 3) or GEO (columns 4 and 5) type with 1000 (columns 2
and 4) or 2000 (columns 3 and 5) nodes. To the right of the double bar are the actual frequencies of each graphlet type in human PPI networks HG (column 6) and HS (column
7), both of which have densities p of ~ 0.002. The bold numbers in row G28 are discussed in the text. Some graphlets are skipped to save space.

network would have. To see this, refer to our Table 2, where we
reproduce part of Tables 2 and 3 from (Rito et al., 2010). In it,
we demonstrate that even the early human Y2H PPI networks,
HG and HS, have many more large dense graphlets than one
would expect in random network models with average densities
of these PPI networks. For example, the highlighted numbers for
graphlet G28 [taken from (Rito et al., 2010)] indicate that we do
not expect even one G28 to appear in a 2000-node ER network
until the density reaches 0.0249 5—more than 10 times the density
of the HG network—and yet the HG network, with 1873 nodes
and a density of just 0.00198, already contains 19 copies of this
highly dense 5-node graphlet. Even if the same human PPI

network were modeled as a GEO network, it is expected to
have zero copies of graphlet G28, rather than 19. Furthermore,
these human PPI networks contain millions of distinct 5-node
graphlets, whereas the models predict only a few, at most. This
tells us that a PPI network of low average density is not of
uniformly low density, but instead contains highly dense subre—
gions where the topology (and hence GDDA) is stable. This is
also conﬁrmed by a well-established observation that PPI
networks have higher clustering coefﬁcients than model networks
(e.g. Przulj et al., 2004).

This effect is also seen in larger clusters on the human PPI
network HS (taken from Stelzl et al., 2005). We have used the

Stability of graphlet-based measures

 

Highly Connected Subgraphs algorithm (Hartuv and Shamir,
2000) to ﬁnd dense subregions of HS network. The largest
dense subregion contains >10% of the nodes (158 nodes) in
the network and ~28% of its edges (744 edges); it has a local
density of 0.06. For a network of n = 158 nodes, the worst-case
density threshold marking the upper end of the instability region
would be 5/n = 0.03; a density of 0.06 for this largest dense
subnetwork of HS is thus well above the threshold. We conclude
the GDDA is stable when measuring the properties of this dense
subnetwork.

3.5 Interpreting the results of non-parametric tests

RGF distance and GDDA provide a way to compare the statis-
tical distribution of graphlets in two speciﬁc networks. Rito et al.
(2010) provided a non-parametric test for assessing the ﬁt
between random model networks and real PPI networks.
Given that our model networks are drawn at random from a
particular distribution, each real PPI network will have a range
of GDDAs with the random model networks. To obtain the
distribution of GDDAs of model-to-model comparisons, we gen-
erate a number of model networks with the same size and density
as the PPI network and compute the GDDAs across all pairs of
these model networks. We also calculate the GDDAs between
the PPI network and these random model networks to get the
distribution of data-to-model comparisons. The difference
between these two distributions can be used to evaluate the
model ﬁt. Rito et al. (2010) were correct in that, to determine
if a particular PPI data network ‘ﬁts’ a particular model, we need
to look at the distribution of GDDAs of many data-to-model
comparisons. If the data network is truly well-ﬁt by the model,
then we would expect the distribution of data-to-model GDDAs
to be the same as the distribution of model-to-model GDDAs.
This non-parametric test is a good test, in that given any measure
of network similarity, it allows us to see if the data network is or
is not statistically distinguishable from the model networks.
However, Rito et al. (2010) use the amount of overlap between
these two distributions (model—model GDDA distribution versus
model—data GDDA distribution) as a simple binary criterion for
whether the data ﬁts the model, without regard to the actual
values of the GDDA. We believe that this interpretation is too
restrictive. We must keep in mind that these models are
extremely preliminary and purely empirical. When ﬁtting such
rudimentary models to such noisy data, we must maintain a
larger perspective than a simple ‘yes/no’ determination can
provide. To improve our models, we need instead to consider
some form of ‘distance’ between the model and the data. For
example, consider the following two cases: (A) Model A has
model—model GDDA distributed normally ~99 :I:0.5% and
model—data GDDA normally distributed ~97:I:0.5%; (B)
Model B has model—model GDDA distributed normally
~80:I: 15% and model—data GDDA normally distributed
~70:I:15%. The ‘overlap’ test would suggest that case (B) is
better than case (A) because case (B) would have substantial
overlap between distributions while case (A) has none.
However, a model—data GDDAof 97% [case (A)] is phenomen-
ally good (assuming the model is derived independently of the
data) compared with a GDDA of just 70% [case (B)]. The fact
that Model A has no overlap with the data may be attributed, for

example, to the model being somehow too narrowly deﬁned;
perhaps the addition of a small amount of noise (to mimic
noise in the data) would bring the model—data agreement
down to 97%, providing a perfect overlap and a high GDDA.
It is not clear to us that overlap alone should be the sole criterion
for judging how well a model ﬁts the data.

3.6 Viral PPI networks are well-ﬁt by models

Large networks such as those from Table 1 are still noisy and
very incomplete; the Arabidopsis Interactome Mapping
Consortium (2011) claims only 2% coverage of the interactome
(i.e. 98% false negative rate). In contrast, the substantially ‘com-
plete’ networks of ﬁve herpes viruses depicted in Figure 6
(Fossum et al., 2009) have ‘only’ ~50% false-negative rate
(Sato et al., 2007; Shimoda et al., 2008). These ﬁve herpesvirus
PPI networks are substantially complete in the sense that all
possible pairs of proteins were tested for interaction using Y2H
technology. The species are as follows: varicella—zoster virus
(VZV), Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV),
herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV—l), murine cytomegalovirus
(mCMV) and Epstein—Barr virus (EBV). Figure 6 compares
these complete PPI networks with six random graph models
using the above-described non-parametric test (Rito et al.,
2010). In this test, we see that the ER random model is the
worst ﬁtting because in no case is there substantial overlap
between the data—model distribution and the model—model
distribution. As we move down the list of models in the ﬁgure,
the amount of overlap generally increases until the STICKY
model appears to have the greatest amount of overlap with
four of the ﬁve viral PPI networks. To our knowledge, this is
the ﬁrst time that the structure of viral PPI networks has been
modeled. Examining the biological reasons for the good ﬁt of the
STICKY model in 80% of the viral networks, and why it is a less
good ﬁt for KSHV, is a subject of future research.

Similar plots (not shown because of space limitations) of three
bacterial PPI networks [MZL (Shimoda et al., 2008), SPP (Sato
et al., 2007) and CJJ (Parrish et al., 2007)], the functional inter-
action network of E. coli (Peregrin-Alvarez et al., 2009), as well
as the Arabidopsis thaliana PPI network (Arabidopsis
Interactome Mapping Consortium, 2011), and PPI networks of
yeast, worm, ﬂy and human from BioGRID, all indicate that
STICKY, SF-GD and GEO-GD (in that order) are the best
ﬁtting models for these networks.

4 CONCLUSIONS

In this article, we have examined the use of GDDA for biological
network comparison. By generating the empirical distributions
of GDDA scores, we have identiﬁed the edge density regions in
which the topology of model networks is unstable. We show that
the GDDA scores correctly measure this topological instability.
These regions do not affect on the analysis of current PPI data,
as current PPI data are dense enough to avoid these regions. We
validate the use of GDDA for searching for well-ﬁtting random
models for PPI networks. We perform new ﬁts to new PPI
networks and demonstrate for the ﬁrst time that ﬁve Viral PPI
networks are will-ﬁt by several models.

Stability of graphlet-based measures

 

We have demonstrated several network models (STICKY,
SF-GD and GEO-GD) are good ﬁts to the most complete exist-
ing viral PPI networks. We believe that this fact, in itself, is a
signiﬁcant milestone in the modelling of biological networks. The
biological signiﬁcance of the ﬁts is not immediately clear, but the
mere fact that we now have reasonably well-ﬁtting models of
viral PPI networks is a stepping stone towards greater under-
standing. Discerning how and why these models are not perfect,
improving them and ﬁguring out why STICKY is often but not
always best, is a subject of future research.

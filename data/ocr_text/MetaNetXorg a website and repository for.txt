ABSTRACT

Summary: MetaNetX.org is a website for accessing, analysing and
manipulating genome-scale metabolic networks (GSMs) as well as
biochemical pathways. It consistently integrates data from various
public resources and makes the data accessible in a standardized
format using a common namespace. Currently, it provides access to
hundreds of GSMs and pathways that can be interactively compared
(two or more), analysed (e.g. detection of dead-end metabolites and
reactions, flux balance analysis or simulation of reaction and gene
knockouts), manipulated and exported. Users can also upload their
own metabolic models, choose to automatically map them into the
common namespace and subsequently make use of the website’s
functionality.

Availability and implementation: MetaNetX.org is available at http://
metanetx.org.

1 INTRODUCTION

Genome-scale metabolic networks (GSMs) consist of compart-
mentalized reactions that consistently combine biochemical,
genetic and genomic information. When also considering a bio-
mass reaction and both uptake and secretion reactions, GSMs
are often used to study genotype—phenotype relationships, to
direct new discoveries and to identify targets in metabolic engin-
eering (Karr et al., 2012). However, a major difﬁculty in GSM
comparisons and reconstructions is to integrate data from differ-
ent resources with different nomenclatures and conventions
for both metabolites and reactions. Hence, GSM consolidation
and comparison may be impossible without detailed biological
knowledge and programming skills. Therefore, community
approaches in form of jamboree meetings were introduced to
collect and integrate data to generate consensus reconstructions
(Herrgaard et al., 2008). Furthermore model repositories, such as
BiGG (Schellenberger et al., 2010), MetRxn (Kumar et al., 2012)
or the Model SEED (Henry et al., 2010) were developed to

integrate models and to allow comparative analyses. In addition,
tools like the COBRA Toolbox (Becker et al., 2007), CytoSEED
(DeJongh et al., 2012), FAME (Boele et al., 2012) or OptFlux
(Rocha et al., 2010) assist in the analysis and modelling tasks.
However, a tight integration of models and software is currently
only provided by the Model SEED, and most of the advanced
tasks, like model manipulations (reaction direction assignment,
adding or removing candidate reactions, modifying the objective
function), are limited to experienced users with programming
skills.

2 OVERVIEW

MetaNetX.org is implemented as a user-friendly and self-
explanatory website that handles all user requests dynamically
(Fig. 1a). It allows a user to access a collection of hundreds of
published models, browse and select subsets for comparison and
analysis, upload or modify new models and export models in
conjunction with their results. Its functionality is based on a
common namespace deﬁned by MNXref (Bernard et al., 2012).
In particular, all repository or user uploaded models are auto-
matically translated with or without compartments into the
common namespace; small deviations from the original model
are possible due to the automatic reconciliation steps imple-
mented by Bernard et al. (2012). However, a user can choose
not to translate his model but still make use of the website’s
functionalities. Furthermore, it is possible to augment the given
reaction set by user-deﬁned reactions, for example, for model
augmentation.

Any available network or pathway can be examined at metab-
olite, reaction, enzyme, pathway or compartment levels using,
for example, an interactive graphical user interface [in contrast
to static KEGG maps (Kanehisa et al., 2012); Fig. lb] or infor-
mation provided at UniProt/SwissProt. In addition, two or more
GSMs or pathways (even from different resources like BiGG,
MetRxn or UniPathway) can be compared to determine
(un)common parts (Fig. lc).

MetaNetX.org also offers an extensive tools section for ana-
lyses based on the network structure (stoichiometric matrix) or
on ﬁux balance analysis (Gianchandani et al., 2010). Speciﬁcally,
it offers services to identify structural inconsistencies such as
dead-end metabolites and their affected (downstream) reactions
and metabolites as well as zero-ﬂux reactions and inconsistent

Fig. 1. Main features of MetaNetX.org. (a) Flowchart illustrating the structure of MetaNetX.org: the website with its common namespace and user
workspace connects the repository of publicly available GSMs or user-deﬁned GSMs/reaction sets with the tools section, as well as the view and export
functions that enable the users to interactively analyse their results inside or outside of MetaNetX.org. (b) Interactive applet viewer showing the network

correlation groups (Terzer et al., 2009). For simulations,
MetaNetX.org provides a tool set to study reaction ﬂuxes, in
particular with respect to biomass production and biomass pro-
duction after performing single reaction or single gene knock-
outs, which are commonly used for model validation.

In the context of model development, a dedicated section of
MetaNetX.org allows one to combine GSMs with respect to
their reaction or protein sets or with respect to the results of
previously performed analyses. For example, it is possible to
create a minimal functional model where every reaction is able
to carry a flux at steady state, i.e. a model without zero-ﬂux
reactions.

All available and newly generated networks as well as the
results of their analyses and predictions can be exported as
SBML- or ﬁat-ﬁles for documentation and further analyses/
modiﬁcations in external tools such as the COBRA toolbox
(Becker et al., 2007).

We believe that MetaNetX.org could become a valuable
resource for accessing, analysing and manipulating GSMs, espe-
cially for users with limited programming skills, or as a resource
for independent validation and testing. We expect that the rigor-
ous format requirements enable a standardized way to deﬁne and
exchange models and that they allow for an effective and efﬁcient
benchmark process for future method development projects.

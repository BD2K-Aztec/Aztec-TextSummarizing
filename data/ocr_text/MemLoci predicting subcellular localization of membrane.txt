ABSTRACT

Motivation: Subcellular localization is a key feature in the process
of functional annotation of both globular and membrane proteins.
In the absence of experimental data, protein localization is inferred
on the basis of annotation transfer upon sequence similarity search.
However, predictive tools are necessary when the localization of
homologs is not known. This is so particularly for membrane
proteins. Furthermore, most of the available predictors of subcellular
localization are specifically trained on globular proteins and poorly
perform on membrane proteins.

Results: Here we develop MemLoci, a new support vector machine-
based tool that discriminates three membrane protein localizations:
plasma, internal and organelle membrane. When tested on an
independent set, MemLoci outperforms existing methods, reaching
an overall accuracy of 70% on predicting the location in the three
membrane types, with a generalized correlation coefficient as high
as 0.50.

1 INTRODUCTION

Knowledge of protein subcellular localization is crucial for
unraveling its cellular function/s (Casadio et al., 2008). Different
membrane types partition eukaryotic cells into functional
compartments and mediate exchange of matter, energy and
information. Biological activity within the different compartments
strictly depends on proteins that are associated to their surrounding
membranes and in turn knowing the subcellular localization of a
given membrane protein helps in elucidating its functional role.
About 30% of the human proteins included in the SwissProt
database are annotated as interacting with membranes (6609 out
of 20 286 in release 08_2010). Nearly 20% of these are integral
membrane proteins (also known as transmembrane proteins) that
span the lipid bi-layer, either with a-helical or B-barrel domains.
The remaining portion consists of peripheral membrane proteins

associated to membranes with different mechanisms (Ghosh et al.,
2008) that includes:

(i) posttranslational covalent attachment to lipid anchors such
as glycophosphatidylinisitol (GPI) anchors (Chatterjee and
Mayer, 2001), palmitoyl anchors (Greaves and Chamberlain,
2007) and myristoyl anchors (Maurer-Stroh et al., 2002);

(ii) interaction between the phospholipid bilayer and speciﬁc
membrane-targeting domains exposed on the protein surface
(Cho and Stahelin, 2005; Lemmon, 2008); and

(iii) association with proteins that directly interact with
membranes.

The interaction of any single protein with a speciﬁc membrane can
involve more than one of the above mechanisms.

Eukaryotic cell membranes can be divided into two main classes
on the basis of both functional and phylogenetic considerations:
the endomembrane system and the organelle membranes. The
endomembrane system comprises the plasma membrane, the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the Golgi complex, the nuclear
envelope, the vesicles, the lysosomes and the vacuoles. These
membranes are thought to have originated from invaginations of the
ancestral prokaryotic plasma membrane (Jékely, 2007). Moreover,
they form a single functional system, since they are either directly
connected or communicate with each other through the vesicle
transport system. The plasma membrane holds a special role in the
endomembrane system, being the interface between the cell and its
external environment.

The other class of membranes comprises the inner and outer
membranes of mitochondria, chloroplasts and other plastids that do
not exchange materials through the vesicle transport and that are
likely to have an independent phylogenetic origin (de Duve, 2007).

The trafﬁcking of membrane proteins from ribosomes to their ﬁnal
localization is a complex process that involves several molecular
mechanisms, only partially unraveled. The best known is the
recognition of speciﬁc targeting peptides that are present in the N- or
C—terrninal segments of the sequence. The most investigated among
them are:

(i) N—terminal signal peptides targeting the proteins towards
the ER, from where they are re-directed to the rest of the
endomembrane system and to the secretory pathway (Hegde
and Bernstein, 2006);

(ii) N—terminal transit peptides targeting the proteins towards the
intracellular organelles, namely mitochondria and plastids
(Balsera et al., 2009; Chacinska et al., 2009);

(iii) C—terrninal propeptides that are cleaved upon the attachment to
a GPI-anchor that associates a protein to the plasma membrane
(Pierleoni et al., 2008).

Other sequential and structural features controlling the trafﬁcking
of membrane proteins are known. Speciﬁc recognition of short
sequence motifs exposed on the surface of proteins associated to
the ER triggers their inclusion into vesicles and their redirection
towards other membranes of the endomembrane system (Barlowe,
2003; Sato and Nakano, 2007), including the plasma membrane
(Rodriguez-Boulan et al., 2005). Unfortunately, no consensus
sequence is available for these motifs. Moreover, proteins can
be associated to membranes by means of domains that are able
to recognize the speciﬁc phospholipid composition and the shape
of the target membranes (Cho and Stahelin, 2005; Lemmon,
2008).

The lack of a deep knowledge on the targeting mechanisms of
membrane proteins is also due to the difﬁculty in carrying out the
experimental determination of their localization: this is particularly
true in the case of peripheral proteins. Several large-scale approaches
have been attempted in order to evaluate the proteome of different
membranes in different organisms (for a review, see Sadowski et al.,
2008). In particular, modern proteomic and labeling techniques
have been applied for determining the plasma membrane proteome
in Arabidopsis and rice (Komatsu, 2008), and the inner and
outer membrane proteomes of mitochondria in rat and mouse
(Distler et al., 2008). However, owing to the intrinsic limitations
of the experimental procedure, the complete characterization of
the proteomes of the different eukaryotic membranes is still a
challenging task (S adowski et al., 2008), and computational methods
can be adopted for rapid and inexpensive prescreening and additional
analysis.

Several tools have been developed for recognizing membrane—
interacting proteins starting from their residue sequences. They
are based on the prediction of transmembrane domains, on the
recognition of posttranslational modiﬁcation sites, and on the
identiﬁcation of lipid-binding domains. However, none of these
predictors is able to identify the membrane where the protein is
localized (Eisenhaber and Eisenhaber, 2007; Punta et al., 2007).
Currently, similarity-based methods or general purpose localization
predictors, mainly trained on globular proteins, are adopted for
accomplishing this task (Briesemeister et al., 2010; Guda and
Subramaniam, 2005 ; Horton et al., 2007; Lin et al., 2009; see for
recent reviews: Casadio et al., 2008; Imai and Nakai, 2010). The only
method speciﬁcally suited to the localization of membrane proteins
is described in a recent work from Sharpe et al. (2010). The method is
based on the analysis of the differences in residue composition and
length of membrane—spanning regions of transmembrane proteins
from ER, Golgi and plasma membranes. A predictor is available
only for single—span transmembrane proteins, not localized in
mitochondria or plastids, and coming from vertebrates and fungi.
In this article, we describe MemLoci, a tool based on support vector
machines (SVMs) speciﬁcally suited to predict the localization of
all the eukaryotic membrane proteins, both integral and peripheral.
This is prompted by considering the limitations of tools based
on sequence similarity for annotating subcellular localization of
membrane proteins and by proving that the existing general purpose
predictors for subcellular localization are largely unsatisfactory in
the case of membrane proteins.

Scarcity of available annotated data prevents from implementing
a predictor that includes a complete classiﬁcation of all the
membranes. Three localizations are then taken into account: the
plasma membrane, the internal membranes (i.e. the endomembrane
system with the exclusion of the plasma membrane) and the
membranes of organelles (mitochondria and plastids). The input
coding includes 123 different features, which cast the available
knowledge about the molecular mechanism and the sequence signals
controlling the sorting of membrane proteins.

The method is freely available on the web at:

2 METHODS

2.1 The dataset

We extracted from the SwissProt database (release 8_2010, July 2010) all
the eukaryotic membrane proteins with known subcellular localization by
parsing the ‘SUBCELLULAR LOCATION’ section of the COMMENT ﬁeld.
Sequences whose annotations were marked as ‘PROBABLE’, ‘POSSIBLE’,
‘BY SIMILARITY’ and ‘FRAGMENT’ were discarded. We ended up with
24 640 sequences of membrane proteins, including transmembrane and
peripheral ones, annotated according to 10 different subcellular localizations.
Localizations were then reduced to the three major classes (plasma
membrane, organelle membranes and internal membranes) following the
scheme detailed in Table 1. We discarded proteins endowed with multiple
localizations in our three-class partition.

In order to reduce the redundancy of the dataset, proteins were grouped
into similarity sets. All-against-all alignments were performed with BLAST.
A graph was built by linking all the pairs of sequences sharing >80% of
identical residues. The connected components of this graph, as determined
with the transitive closure algorithm (Cormen et al., 2001), deﬁned 10 634
non-overlapping subsets. Only one protein per subset was retained. As
listed in Table 1, our complete dataset consists of 10634 sequences: 4016
from plasma membrane, 2308 from organelle membranes and 4310 from
the internal membranes. We adopted this reduced dataset for training and
evaluating MemLoci.

In order to compile training/testing sets containing sequences with low
homology, the reduced dataset (10 634 sequences) was then clustered into
subsets containing proteins that align with an E-Value 510—3 with a transitive

closure procedure. We ended up with 1547 clusters and by construction
proteins belonging to two different clusters share low similarity, since they
align with an E-Value >10—3

In order to build an independent validation set, we retained all the proteins
released after January 1, 2008 and included in clusters containing a single
sequence. With this procedure we obtained 100 sequences that: (i) share low
similarity with all the other proteins in the dataset; and (ii) were not used to
train the other subcellular localization methods, except the tool by Sharpe
et al. (2010). The validation set consists of 32 plasma membrane, 50 internal
membranes and 18 organelle membranes proteins.

The remaining 10534 sequences included in 1447 clusters were used to
train MemLoci. To this aim, 10 cross-validation sets were then deﬁned by
randomly grouping these non-similar clusters.

2.2 The predictor architecture

The MemLoci prediction system consists of three binary SVM classiﬁers
speciﬁcally suited at discriminating one of the three considered localization
classes (plasma membrane, organelle membranes and internal membranes).
During the training procedure of each one of the three SVMs, the
sequences belonging to the class to be discriminated were presented as
positive examples, while all the remaining sequences were presented as
negative examples. The SVM-light package (version 6, freely available at
http://svmlight.joachims.org) was used, adopting the radial basis function
(RBF) kernel and setting the parameters Gamma and C to 3 and 6,
respectively, upon a grid search in the parameter space. The three SVMs
were trained with three different sets of features, each one optimized for a
speciﬁc class (see Section 2.3). In this way, the training procedure determined
three optimal separating hyperplanes in three different feature spaces. Given a
protein sequence, each SVM assigns a binary positive/negative classiﬁcation
based on the discriminating hyperplane. The reliability of the classiﬁcation
improves at increasing distance from the hyperplane. A jury among the three
binary predictions is built in the following way. For each example and for
each class-speciﬁc SVM we compute a signed distance, whose absolute value
is the distance from the discriminating hyperplane and whose sign indicates
whether the example is classiﬁed in the positive or negative set. The ﬁnal
prediction is based on a simple winner-takes-all jury that assigns the example
to the class corresponding to the highest value for the signed distance.

2.3 Input coding

The input vector encodes features that can be grouped into the following ﬁve
classes:

(i) The composition of the sequence proﬁle: sequence proﬁles are
compiled aligning the target sequence with the release 8_2010 of the
SwissProt database using BLAST and adopting a threshold E-Value
equal to 10‘s. The proﬁle consists of a sequence of 20—Valued vectors
reporting the residue composition of the alignment for each position
of the query sequence. The sequence proﬁle composition for a given
segment is obtained by averaging the 20—Valued vectors over the
segment, and consists of a 20—Valued vector with elements ranging
between 0 and 1.

(ii) The composition of the ﬁltered sequence proﬁle: in order to enhance the
contribution of evolutionary conserved positions, the sequence proﬁle
is also ﬁltered by retaining only the residues whose frequencies at a
given position are higher than a given threshold. Two thresholds are
adopted, 0.33 and 0.75. This procedure extracts highly conserved local
signatures, some of which are likely to contain important localization
signals. The ﬁltered proﬁle composition of each segment consists of a
20—Valued vector with elements ranging between 0 and 1.

(iii) The average hydrophobicity of N and C sequence termini: the average
hydrophobicity of N and C sequence termini as computed considering
for each terminus two segments comprising either 40 or 60 residues.
This feature aims at highlighting N and C sequence termini that carry
signal and transit peptides or posttranslational modiﬁcation signals,

often consisting of highly hydrophobic regions. The Kyte—Doolittle
scale is adopted (Kyte and Doolittle, 1982). In order to standardize the
range of the input values, the Kyte—Doolittle parameters are linearly
rescaled so that the highest value (4.5, for isoleucine) and the lowest
value (—4.5, for arginine) are mapped to 1 and —1, respectively. The
transformed values are then averaged over the selected segment. The
average hydrophobicity of a segment is encoded with a single real
value ranging between —1 and 1.

(iV) The residue composition of highly hydrophobic stretches: highly
hydrophobic stretches are identiﬁed by averaging the (rescaled) Kyte—
Doolittle hydrophobicity over a 13-residue sliding window and by
selecting segments reporting an average hydrophobicity >0.33. The
residue composition of highly hydrophobic stretches is then calculated.
This input is then encoded in a 20—Valued vector whose elements
range between 0 and 1. The hydrophobic stretches are likely to contain
localization signals included in membrane spanning regions and the
surrounding residues (Sharpe et al., 2010).

(V) The protein length: the number of residues of the protein sequence is
rescaled by suitable factor (1/2000). The scaling factor was chosen
considering that 90% of the proteins in our dataset are less than 2000
residues long.

Each of the three class-speciﬁc SVM-based predictors is implemented
independently of the others two with its speciﬁc input encoding. The input
encoding was selected after a search in the encoding space, adopting a 10-fold
cross-validation procedure. Eight sets were used to train the binary SVMs,
one was used for evaluating the best input coding, and the remaining one was
used to compute the ﬁnal performances reported in the Section 3. By this,
the evaluation of the predictor performance is unaffected by any possible
overﬁtting resulting from the input optimization procedure.

Since the best performing input encoding is very similar across the 10
cross-validation groups, we adopted a majority consensus for selecting the
feature included in the ﬁnal predictor. Features used for each predictor are
listed in Table S1 (Supplementary Material). The optimization of the REF
kernel parameters for each training set was performed with a grid search. The
10 sets gave very similar values, which were therefore averaged to obtain
the parameters used for training the ﬁnal predictor, namely y = 3 and C = 6.

2.4 Scoring indexes

The performance is evaluated by predicting all the membrane proteins in the
dataset with the 10-fold cross-validation procedure described above. Since
proteins belonging to the same cluster can share up to 80% identity, we
adopted the following normalizing procedure in order to avoid biases of the
predictive scores towards the most populated clusters.

For each one of the three classes (i) and for each one of the 1352
similarity clusters (1') we computed TPJ-(i) and TFJ-(i), the number of correct
predictions in the class i and in the complementary class, respectively,
normalized to the total number of sequences in the cluster. In a similar way we
computed the ratio of false positive and false negative predictions, FPJ-(i) and
FNJ-(i), respectively. These numbers were then summed over all the clusters,
obtaining TP(i), TN(i), FP(i) and FN(i), that give an unbiased estimation of
the number of correct and wrong predictions in the class i.

The recall (Rec), the false positive rate (FPR) and Matthews correlation
coefﬁcient (MCC) for the class i are then computed as follows:

TP(i) +FN(i)
FPR(i) = L“) (2)
TN(i) +FP(i)

TP(i) -TN(i) —FP(i) -FN(i)

3 RESULTS
3.1 MemLoci at work

We developed MemLoci, a predictor of subcellular localization
speciﬁcally suited for integral and peripheral membrane proteins.
Three major classes are discriminated: plasma, internal and organelle
membrane. A complete partition is presently not feasible given the
paucity of non-redundant experimental data. The predictor consists
of three binary SVMs that analyze the composition, the conservation,
the hydrophobicity of the whole sequence and for each sequence the
same features for its N- and C-terminal portions. A winner-takes-all
jury further processes the output of the three class-speciﬁc SVMs
(see Section 2.2 for details).

A rigorous 10-fold cross-validation procedure was adopted for
evaluating the performance of the method. By construction, pairs
of sequences belonging to two different sets align with an E—Value
> 10‘3. In order to estimate to which extent the residual sequence
identity could affect the scores, we also performed a cross-validated
annotation transfer by similarity: for each sequence in each one of
the 10 sets, we searched with BLAST the most similar sequence in
the other sets, and we transferred the corresponding annotation.

Table 2 summarizes the prediction performance. In order not to
over-represent the most populated similarity clusters, the scores
have been weighted as detailed in Section 2. The low values of
the correlation coefﬁcients obtained with the annotation transfer by
similarity indicate that the prediction is close to random. This means
that the E—Value threshold adopted for splitting the dataset ﬁts with
the need of avoiding any overestimation caused by the similarity
between training and testing sets.

The reported performances corroborate the notion that MemLoci
is suited for solving the annotation problem when no similar
sequence endowed with an annotation for subcellular localization
is available. The generalized correlation index is 0.51, while the
Matthews correlation indexes are as high as 0.43, 0.42 and 0.60 for
plasma, internal and organelle membranes, respectively. A detailed
analysis of the prediction reveals that the most frequent error of
MemLoci is to include plasma membrane proteins within the internal
membrane class, and Vice-versa. About 30% of plasma membrane
proteins are predicted as internal membrane and 20% of internal

membrane proteins are predicted in the plasma membrane class
(Data not shown).

3.2 Comparison with general purpose subcellular
localization predictors

Many methods are available for predicting the protein subcellular
localization starting from sequence. Almost none of them is however
speciﬁc for membrane proteins. Some include plasma membrane
proteins in a speciﬁc class and do not make any distinction between
globular and membrane proteins for the other localizations. Among
these tools, the most popular are WoLF-PSORT (Horton et al.,
2007), pTARGET (Guda and Subramaniam, 2005) and Yloc-HiRes
(Briesemeister et al., 2010). Other predictors, such as BaCelLo
(Pierleoni et al., 2006), explicitly exclude membrane proteins from
their training/testing sets. BaCelLo and WoLF—PSORT resulted the
two best performing tools for predicting subcellular localization
in a recent comparative evaluation performed on a set of globular
proteins (Casadio et al., 2008). YLoc and KnowPred were reported
to outperform both WoLF-PSORT and BaCelLo on a recent test
consisting of animal sequences (Briesemeister et al., 2010)

We tested MemLoci and the other state-of—the-art methods on
an independent dataset comprising only sequences released after
January 2008 and comprising 32 plasma membrane, 50 internal
membranes and 18 organellar membranes proteins. None of the
protein in the independent test aligns with an E—Value lower than
10‘3 to the MemLoci training dataset.

Only 52 proteins from animals or fungi have been submitted
to pTARGET since this tool is not designed to predict proteins
from plants. When using YLoc we adopted the HiRes version that
deﬁnes 11 localizations. YLoc can take advantage of gene ontology
(GO) term annotations extracted from proteins similar to the query
sequences, as retrieved from UniProtKB. Therefore, for sake of a
fair comparison, we disabled this option. This procedure, according
to the authors, results only in small differences when predicting
proteins devoid of annotation (Briesemeister et al., 2010). Yloc and
BaCelLo deﬁne three different sets of parameters, for animal, plants
and fungi, and each sequence was predicted adopting the appropriate
parameter set.

The following schema is adopted for reducing the classes deﬁned
by different predictors (5 for BaCelLo, 11 for Yloc—HiRes, 12
for WoLF—PSORT, 9 for pTARGET and 10 for KnowPred) to the
three major classes we take into consideration, namely ‘plasma
membrane’, ‘internal membranes’ and ‘organelle membranes’

0 Proteins predicted as secreted or localized in the plasma
membrane are considered in the ‘plasma membrane’ class.
Secreted proteins are indeed often associated to the external

leaﬂet of the plasma membrane. It is worth stressing that
BaCelLo does not deﬁne a plasma membrane class.

0 Proteins predicted as mitochondrial or chloroplastic are
considered in the ‘organelle membranes’ class.

0 Proteins predicted in all the other localizations are considered
in the ‘internal membranes’ class.

In the case of KnowPred, which computes a score value for each
localization, only the best score is taken into consideration. Based
on this schema, all the predictions were compared to the UniProtKB
experimental annotations. We performed an annotation transfer by
similarity, with the same procedure described in Section 3.2, in order
to evaluate the performances of a baseline predictor that considers
only similarity among the sequences included in the validation set
and those that form the training set.

Scoring indexes on validation set are listed in Table 3. MemLoci,
speciﬁcally trained on membrane proteins, outperforms the other
tools in all the considered classes: MCC values of ‘plasma
membrane’ and ‘internal membranes’ double with respect to the
best prediction achieved with the other methods (from 0.26 to 0.52
and from 0.24 to 0.53, respectively). Only Yloc-HiRes outperforms
MemLoci in the ‘organelle membranes’ class, but it scores much
worse in the two other classes. The global scoring indexes of
MemLoci (GC=0.50 and Q=70%) are therefore far higher than
those obtained with all the other methods. The comparison with
BLAST results conﬁrm that the good performances are not due
to residual similarity between the training and the validation sets.
All the other general purpose methods performs poorly on the
independent dataset and performances are in some case very close
to those reported by the baseline annotation based on transfer
by similarity. BaCelLo and WolfPSort hardly achieve half of the
GC coefﬁcients previously reported in the case of non-membrane
proteins (Casadio et al., 2008). It is worth noticing that BaCelLo,
which explicitly excludes membrane proteins from its training set,
scores with a performance similar to those of WoLF-PSORT and
pTARGET, which include them. The most accurate of the general
purpose methods is YLoc that scores with GC coefﬁcient and overall
accuracy (Q) of 0.37 and 54%, respectively. However both index
values are considerably lower than those obtained by MemLoci
(GC = 0.50 and Q = 70%).

The GC value of MemLoci on the validation set well correlates
with that reported on the training set (Table 3 and Supplementary
Table S2, respectively), proving that the adopted cross-validation

procedure is not affected by biases. Considering separately the three
classes, the validation results are even higher than the training ones,
but in the case of organelle membranes. For most of the other tools,
the validation performances are lower than those achieved on the
MemLoci training set (reported in Supplementary Table S2) since
many sequences in this set were used to parameterize the different
methods. As in the case of MemLoci, on the ‘organelle membranes’
class also the other methods, but Yloc, show lower results on the
validation set than on the training set.

The only method devoted to the prediction of subcellular
localization of membrane proteins has been recently developed by
Sharpe et al. (2010).This neural network-based method is able to
discriminate between single-spanning membrane protein localized
in the plasma, post-G01 gi, pre-Golgi and ER membrane. It explicitly
excludes proteins from mitochondria and plastids. Moreover, it
is suited only to fungal and animal single-span transmembrane
proteins. These limitations restrict the comparison to only 18
proteins (8 plasma membrane and 10 internal membrane). All the
internal membrane proteins are correctly predicted in the post-G01 gi,
pre—Golgi or ER membrane localizations. Only three out of eight
plasma membrane sequences are correctly predicted. On the same
18 sequence-test, MemLoci correctly predicts all the 10 proteins
from internal membranes and 7 out of 8 plasma membrane proteins.

3.3 Analysis of the most signiﬁcant features

Predictions of MemLoci derive from non—linear combination of
several features as performed by SVMs based on RBF kernel. In
order to evaluate the most discriminating ones, for each binary
classiﬁer the means and the SDs of all the features were computed
over each one of the 10 testing sets. The signiﬁcance of the
difference between the average values of the positive and the
negative examples was assessed with the P-Value, as estimated with
a two-tailed Student’s t-test. Supplementary Tables S3—S5 list, for
each localization type, features with P-Values 5 10‘10 in all the
10 testing sets. A summary of the ﬁndings is reported in Table 4.
Several compositional differences are observed, mainly in the whole
sequence and in N-terminal regions. Increasing length is relevant for
plasma membrane proteins and decreasing length is characteristic of
organelle membrane proteins. At the C-terminus, the composition in
Ser residues is enriched in plasma membrane proteins and depleted
in organelle membrane proteins. Differences in C- and N-termini
are likely to cast speciﬁc features of the signals responsible for the
sorting mechanisms, often mediated by protein—protein interaction.

Up arrow: features enriched in the class; down arrow: features enriched in the complementary class.

For example, it has been shown that transit peptides of
mitochondrial proteins tend to be positively charged and rich in
apolar residues (Pfanner and Geissler, 2001), and these observations
agree with the increased composition in Lys and Ala and the
decreased composition in Asp and Glu that we extract as signiﬁcant
features distinctive of organelle membrane proteins. Out of the
10 signiﬁcant features distinctive of proteins from organelle
membranes (Table 4), four are also signiﬁcant for plasma membrane
proteins, although with the opposite sign. The same holds for three
features typical of proteins from organelle membranes that are also
signiﬁcant for internal membrane proteins. The better performance
of MemLoci on organelle membrane proteins may be accounted for
by considering that this class share signiﬁcant features with both the
others with opposite sign and it can therefore be better discriminated.
This analysis highlights some features that are signiﬁcantly different
in the different protein classes, and are therefore relevant for
accomplishing the prediction. Most of them, to our knowledge,
were not previously identiﬁed. It is worth stressing that, although
statistically signiﬁcant, the reported features are not strong enough
to perform an efﬁcient discrimination, unless they are combined in
a complex way with all the other considered features. Indeed SVMs
take advantage of a non-linear combination that it is not simply
accounted for by feature differences among classes.

4 CONCLUSIONS

Here we present MemLoci, an efﬁcient method for predicting
the subcellular localization of integral and peripheral membrane
proteins. MemLoci outperforms currently state-of—the—art methods
for the prediction of subcellular localization, which were not
trained speciﬁcally to solve this task. MemLoci can then be
adopted for characterizing the localization of both the experimental
and predicted membrane proteomes of any eukaryotic organism.
MemLoci can be included in a pipeline, in succession to predictive
methods devoted to the identiﬁcation of proteins associated
to the membrane phase. Efﬁcient predictors are available for
discriminating the different types of integral membrane proteins,
both transmembrane or lipid-anchored (Chou and Chen, 2007;
Martelli et al., 2003; Nugent and Jones, 2009; Pierleoni et al.,
2008). In particular, in the case of transmembrane proteins,
predictive methods achieve the discrimination task with < 1%
false positive or false negative rates. Moreover, MemLoci can be
adopted to deﬁne the localization of proteins detected with different
experimental techniques speciﬁcally developed for determining the
membrane proteome (Lu et al., 2008; Rabilloud, 2009). One possible
application of MemLoci is then to discriminate the fraction of the
membrane proteome interacting with the plasma membrane and
by this signiﬁcantly restricting the protein set where new antigens,
biomarkers and drug targets can be discovered.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Microbial communities have an important role in natural
ecosystems and have an impact on animal and human health.
Intuitive graphic and analytical tools that can facilitate the study
of these communities are in short supply. This article introduces
Microbial Community Analysis GUI, a graphical user interface (GUI)
for the R-programming language (R Development Core Team, 2010).
With this application, researchers can input aligned and clustered
sequence data to create custom abundance tables and perform
analyses specific to their needs. This GUI provides a flexible modular
platform, expandable to include other statistical tools for microbial
community analysis in the future.

1 INTRODUCTION

Several graphical user interface software (GUI) packages exist
for the analysis of microbial community data. These programs
include InVUE, which specializes in creating interactive graphical
representations for large datasets (Ravel et al., 2011) and UniFrac, a
web—based GUI that allows users to compare microbial communities
using phylogenetic information (Lozupone et al., 2006). Many of
these applications were built using programming languages such
as C and C++. Currently, there are few GUIs speciﬁcally available
for the analysis of microbial communities that also take advantage
of the R programming language. This article introduces Microbial
Community Analysis GUI (mcaGUI), an R—package built to help
microbial biologists harness the power of statistical analysis tools
provided in R without having to learn the R programming language.
Using mcaGUI, researchers can perform statistical analyses and
create various interactive and analytical data representations speciﬁc
to microbial ecology.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

What distinguishes mcaGUI from similar applications is its ability
to directly input aligned sequence data that provide information
about microbial community composition. This allows researchers
to create custom abundance tables using both sample metadata and
data on operational taxonomic units (OTU). mcaGUI is modular and
expandable; it provides a platform that can be extended to include
more functionality in the future.

2 METHODS

mcaGUI has a simple layout that is divided into three parts (Supplementary
Fig. $1). The left side of the screen contains the variable browser, which
shows all created variables or objects that contain imported data and
outcomes of data manipulations such as richness estimates. On the top right is
the tabbed browser where the data can be viewed in tabular form and analyses
are performed. For most operations in mcaGUI, a new tab opens where the
user can input additional arguments. On the bottom right is the command
window where information and output of some operations is shown.

We implemented package OTUbase (Beck at 611., 2011) to simplify loading
sequence data into R. These data, along with all relevant information, are
stored in an R object and can be used to construct custom abundance
tables. OTU abundance tables can also be loaded directly but with limited
customization options.

3 BIOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS

mcaGUI provides an interface to access a set of statistical tools
to summarize and analyze microbial community data such as
principal component analysis (PCA), cluster analysis and others (see
Supplementary Table S1 for a detailed listing). A complete workﬂow
with examples, along with detailed description of data input and
output, can be found in the Supplementary material. Herein, we
introduce three examples to illustrate the use of mcaGUI. The ﬁrst
illustrates how to input sequence data and create custom abundance
tables. The second illustrates how to estimate microbial richness and
evenness. The third illustrates how to perform PCA. These examples
utilize the 454 pyrosequencing data presented in Sogin et al. (2006)
that were used to study and compare the microbial community
composition and diversity in seven oceanic sites. Elaborate details
for each of these examples can be found in the Supplementary
material.

Fig. 1. Example output of a Biplot created using mcaGUI. The data used
is from Sogin et al. (2006) but the number of observations and explanatory
variables were reduced to improve readability

3.1 Example 1: create a custom abundance table

To create a custom abundance table, the user must ﬁrst input
sequence data. This is done by navigating to the File Menu
and clicking the Read OTUbase option (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Supplementary Figure S3 shows an image with ﬁlled in values
for reading in the Sogin et al. (2006) sequence data. Once the
data are loaded, the user can navigate to the Data Menu and
press the Abundance Table option (Supplementary Fig. S4). The
user can customize the rows and columns of the abundance table
by pressing the Update Feature and Sample Meta—Data button.
Supplementary Figure SS shows the dialogue box by which the user
creates an abundance table on the genus level aggregated by site.
The researcher can either save this custom abundance table or use
it in further analyses within the mcaGUI interface.

3.2 Example 2: richness and diversity estimation

Richness and diversity can be estimated by navigating to the
Analysis Menu and Clicking the Richness Estimation or Diversity
Estimation buttons, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S6). An
abundance table should be speciﬁed and the output table of estimates
should be assigned to a new variable (Supplementary Fig. S7).
Estimates can be accessed by double clicking this new variable in
the variable browser (Supplementary Fig. S8). The researcher can
then use built in tools to plot these estimates or export the results to
a delimited data ﬁle that can be used with other programs.

3.3 Example 3: using PCA to View groups of
correlated OTUs

We perform a PCA analysis by navigating to the Analysis Menu,
Multivariate and then PCA. Supplementary Figure S9 shows the

dialogue window for PCA. Plot 2D displays a biplot with the ﬁrst two
PCA coordinates (Fig. 1). Figure 1 indicates that Acidimicrobidae
is associated with lower deep water while Cystobacteraceae is
associated with Labrador seawater, for example. Plot 3D shows an
interactive biplot in the ﬁrst three PCA coordinates. These plots
allow the user to zoom in and out and rotate the axes to identify
interesting patterns in the data. Selecting Scree Plot or Elbow plot,
displays a graphic used to identify which PCA directions account
for most of the variation in the data.

4 THE GRAPHICAL VIEW

mcaGUI provides both basic and interactive graphics. When
Bootstrap Interval Estimation is used (Supplementary material),
mcaGUI returns histograms that show the bootstrap distribution of
each statistic requested. When using PCA the user can view a biplot
in the ﬁrst three PCA directions and interactively explore the space.
Other graphical tools include histograms, box plots, scatter plots,
pairs—plots and cluster diagrams.

5 IMPLEMENTATION

Poor Man’s GUI (Verzani, 2010) provided the base layout for
mcaGUI. Additional functionality was added with the gWidgets
(Verzani, 2007) and gWidgetsRGtk2 (Lawrence and Verzani 2011)
R—packages. All GUI layouts were created using Widget and Handler
combinations; a widget is an object that speciﬁes a layout, and a
handler is an action that is then used by the widget to run analyses.
Utilizing these tools, new functionality can be added by linking
pre—existing packages to this GUI.

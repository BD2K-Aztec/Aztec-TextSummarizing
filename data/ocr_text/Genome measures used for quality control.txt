ABSTRACT

Motivation: The transition/transversion (T i/T v) ratio and heterozygous/
nonreference—homozygous (het/nonref—hom) ratio have been com-
monly computed in genetic studies as a quality control (QC) measure-
ment. Additionally, these two ratios are helpful in our understanding of
the patterns of DNA sequence evolution.

Results: To thoroughly understand these two genomic measures, we
performed a study using 1000 Genomes Project (1000G) released
genotype data (N = 1092). An additional two datasets (N = 581 and
N = 6) were used to validate our findings from the 1000G dataset. We
compared the two ratios among continental ancestry, genome regions
and gene functionality. We found that the Ti/Tv ratio can be used as a
quality indicator for single nucleotide polymorphisms inferred from
high-throughput sequencing data. The Ti/Tv ratio varies greatly by
genome region and functionality, but not by ancestry. The het/
nonref—hom ratio varies greatly by ancestry, but not by genome re-
gions and functionality. Furthermore, extreme guanine + cytosine
content (either high or low) is negatively associated with the Ti/Tv
ratio magnitude. Thus, when performing QC assessment using these
two measures, care must be taken to apply the correct thresholds
based on ancestry and genome region. Failure to take these consid-
erations into account at the QC stage will bias any following analysis.

1 INTRODUCTION

The maturity of high-throughput sequencing technology has
greatly enhanced our ability to study the human genome. The
rise of high-throughput sequencing technology also raises vari-
ous bioinformatics challenges. One such challenge lies with the
quality control (QC) of the sequencing data. As high-throughput
sequencing becomes more commonly used, QC measures become
more automatic and less obvious to the researcher. This is par-
ticularly dangerous if these QC measures introduce biases into
the sequencing data that are not clear to the researcher using the
data.

Adenine (A) and guanine (G) are two-ring purine-based nu-
cleotides and cytosine (C) and thymine (T) are one-ring pyrimi-
dine-derived nucleotides. In substitution mutations, transitions

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

are defined as the interchange of the purine-based A<—>G or
pryimidine—based C<—>T. Transversions are defined as the inter-
change between two-ring purine nucleobases and one-ring pyr-
imidine bases. The possible transversions are A<—>C, A<—>T,
C<—>G, G<—>T. If substitution mutations occur randomly, then
the Ti/Tv ratio [the number of transition single nucleotide poly-
morphisms (SNPs) divided by the number of transversion SNPs]
averaged over a large enough number of substations should be
0.5, because there are two possible transitions and four possible
transversions. However, a transversion is considered to be a
more drastic change than a transition, because substitution of
one-ring to two-ring chemical structure or vice versa (transver-
sions) requires more energy than substitution without change in
the ring structure (transitions). Thus, in real sequencing data, the
transition and transversion ratio is often greater than 0.5. The Ti/
Tv ratio has been used as an important parameter in many stu-
dies such as phylogenetic tree reconstruction and estimation of
divergence. Recently, the transition/tranversion ratio has also
been used as a QC parameter in high-throughput sequencing
studies (Durbin et al., 2010; Emond et al., 2012; Guo et al.,
2012a, b, 2013; Wang et al., 2014).

For human-exome sequencing data, the Ti/Tv ratio is gener-
ally around 3.0, and about 2.0 outside of exome regions
(Bainbridge et al., 2011). The Ti/Tv ratio is also different between
synonymous and non-synonymous SNPs (Yang and Nielsen,
1998). The Ti/Tv ratio for the haploid chromosomes (X in
males, Y, mitochondria) is different compared to the diploid
chromosomes (chromosomes 1—22). Much stronger bias toward
transitions over transversions (Ti/Tv is between 21 and 38) in
mitochondria has been observed in multiple studies (Lanave
et al., 1986; Guo et al., 2012a). It has been suggested to consider
haploid and diploid chromosomes separately when computing
Ti/Tv ratios (Guo et al., 2013).

Another useful ratio to compute for genetic studies is the het-
erozygosity to non-reference homozygosity ratio (het/nonref—
hom). There are three possible genotypes for a given diploid
genomic position: AA, AB and BB. If A represents the reference,
then the het/nonref—hom ratio of a person is computed as the
number of SNPs with AB genotype dived by the number of SNP
with BB genotype. Mathematically, the assumptions of Hardy—
Weinberg equilibrium applied over a large set of multiple SNPs
in one individual (instead of one SNP in a large number of mul-
tiple individuals, as is the standard case for Hardy—Weinberg
equilibrium QC tests) results in a het/nonref—hom ratio of 2.0
(Guo et al., 2013). Thus for whole-genome sequencing, the het/
nonref-hom ratio can be used also as a QC parameter.

Genome measures used for quality control

 

In this study, we have performed in-depth analyses of the Ti/
Tv and het/nonref—hom ratios to determine the range of variabil-
ity in these measures. We focused our analyses on three major
aspects of these measures: (i) Genomic region: deﬁned as exon,
intron, intergenic, micro RNA (miRNA) and non-coding RNA
(lncRNA) (ii) SNP type: synonymous or non-synonymous,
(iii) Subject continental ancestry: European, Asian, African and
American. Furthermore, we also explored the reasons for the
measured variations we observed among these three aspects.

2 METHODS

Three different datasets were selected to conduct our study. The major
dataset is the 1000 Genomes Project (Abecasis et al., 2012) (1000G)
released genotype data, which contain 1092 subjects from a diverse eth-
nicity background. The genotypes of the 1092 subjects were inferred by
the 1000G research team from various sequencing data types, including
targeted partial-exome sequencing, whole-exome sequencing, and low-
pass whole-genome sequencing. Imputation techniques were used to
impute the SNPs in strong linkage equilibrium (LD). The lOOOG dataset
is the most complete description of human genomes existing today in
terms of number of subjects, geographic distribution and coverage of
the genome. Thus, our analyses were focused on the 1000G dataset.
The second dataset is part of the Shanghai Breast Cancer Study
(SBCS) (Zheng et al., 2009) which contains 581 subjects. Illumina’s
TrueSeq capture reagent was used to capture the exome sequence data
in this dataset. Paired-end 100 base pair long reads were generated on the
Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. The third dataset derives from a study of
hereditary colorectal cancer and includes six sequenced gerrnline whole
genomes from Caucasian subjects. Paired-end 100 base pair long reads
were generated from the Illumina HiSeq 2000 for these six genomes.

For 1000G released data, no additional QC was performed by us. For
dataset 2 and 3, thorough QCs were performed at the raw data, align-
ment, and variant calling level. Alignment was done using the Burrows—
Wheeler Aligner (BWA) (Li and Durbin, 2009) against the HG19 human
reference genome. We then marked duplicate reads with Picard and car-
ried out regional realignment and quality score recalibration using the
Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) (McKenna et al., 2010). For variant
calling, we only used reads with a mapping quality score (MAPQ) 320
(i.e. 51% probability of being wrong) and bases with base quality score
(BQ) 220. We used GATK’s Uniﬁed Genotyper to call SNPs. GATK’s
best practice SNP ﬁltering recommendation was followed to produce the
ﬁnal list of SNPs used in our analyses.

We divided genomic regions into different subgroups by three criteria:
genomic region, subject ancestry and functional categories. We con-
sidered ﬁve major regional categories: exonic, intronic, intergenic,
miRNA and lncRNA regions. anRNA was chosen as a region because
there has been great research interest in lncRNA in the recent years led by
the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements ENCODE project (Consortium
et al., 2012). In 2012, the ENCODE project claimed that about 80% of
the human genome is functional. This is a direct contradiction of previous
understanding that only 3% of the human genome is functional. Even
though this statement has been criticized by other scientists (Graur et al.,
2013), it is undeniable that the hidden functionality in lncRNA might
hold great potential research interest. ANNOVAR (Wang et al., 2010)
was used to determine whether a SNP is in an exon, intron or intergenic
region. If an SNP can be classiﬁed into multiple regions due to over-
lapping annotations of regions, it will be only considered once in the ﬁrst
region deﬁned. Such SNPs consist of less than 0.1% of all SNPs and do
not contribute to the result signiﬁcantly. To determine whether a SNP
resides in a non-coding RNA region, we used the release of Gencode .vl9
ﬁle as reference. The ancestry subgroups were deﬁned based on the
lOOOG deﬁnition. For the 1000G dataset, there are total of 14

subethnicity groups. Following the lOOOG protocol, we grouped these
into four major categories: African (ASW, LWK, YRI), American
(CLM, MXL, PUR), Asian (CHB, CHS, JPT) and European (CEU,
FIN, GBR, IBS, TSI). The full names of each subrace can be viewed
in Supplementary Table S1. The 1000G American group is a complex
admixed population with ancestry from all three other continental
groups. All analyses on 1000G dataset were performed for each major
ancestry group separately. The other two datasets only contain subjects
from a single ancestry group and thus were not divided further by ances-
try groups. Finally, the coding region SNPs were categorized by their
functionality: synonymous or non-synonymous. Variations among ances-
try groups and genomic regions were tested using the Kruskal—Wallis test
(Kruskal and Wallis, 1987).

We also studied the effect of guanine—cytosine content (GC—content)
on the two ratios. The concentration of GC—content has been directly
linked to coding-sequence length (Oliver and Marin, 1996) and the pro-
ﬁciency of Illumina sequencing technology (Dohm et al., 2008). Because
GC—content is regionally related, we examined the GC—content within the
four genomic regions described previously. To extract each individual
exon and intron location, we used RefSeq’s transcript transfer format
(GTF) ﬁle. The exact exon start and end locations are given, and the
intron start and end were computed based on the end and start of the
corresponding exons. The nucleotide sequences were extracted for all
exons and introns based on the HG19 human genome reference. GC-
content was computed for each exon and intron. For intergenic regions,
we divided the intergenic regions into 1 million base pair windows and
computed their GC—content and ratios. For lncRNA, we computed the
GC—content and ratio for each individual lncRNA based on the Gencode
.v19 lncRNA release.

3 RESULTS

We ﬁrst compared the Ti/Tv ratios of the ﬁve major regional
categories. Even though the variations of Ti/Tv ratios were stat-
istically signiﬁcantly different due to high sample size
(P<0.0001) (Supplementary Table S2), there was not a visible
substantial variation of the Ti/Tv ratios among the four ancestry
groups (Fig. 1). For exonic regions, the African group had the
highest Ti/Tv ratio median of 2.84, and the Asian group had the
lowest median Ti/Tv ratio of 2.79. For intronic regions, all an-
cestry groups had similar median Ti/Tv ratios of around 2.2.
The median Ti/Tv ratio continued to drop to around 2.06 for
intergenic and lncRNA regions for all four ancestry groups. The
median Ti/Tv ratios for miRNA regions are between 2.59 and
2.95 among the four ancestry groups. Higher variations were
observed for Ti/Tv ratios in miRNA regions due to fewer
SNPs reside in the short miRNA regions. Based on these results,
the Ti/Tv ratio can be used to distinguish between exonic and
non-exonic regions, and the Ti/Tv ratio of lncRNA behaves simi-
larly to intergenic regions.

Next, we examined the het/nonref—hom ratios of the ﬁve major
regional categories (Fig. 2) and found there were no major dif-
ferences (Supplementary Table S2) between the het/nonref—hom
ratios among the ﬁve regions. However, the het/nonref-hom
ratio is strongly associated with continental ancestry. Among
the four ancestry groups, Africans had the highest median het/
nonref-hom ratio of around 2.0, and Asians had the lowest
median het/nonref—hom ratio at 1.4. The median het/nonref—
hom ratios for Americans and Europeans were around 1.7 and
1.6. From these results, clearly, the het/nonref—hom ratio is

dependent.

The next step after identifying SNPs from exome sequencing
data involves annotation of the SNPs to assess their potential
functionality. For the Ti/Tv ratio, there is a visible difference
between synonymous and non-synonymous SNPs and little vari-
ation among ancestry groups (Fig. 3). Synonymous SNPs had
a higher Ti/Tv ratio (median ratio around 3.1) compared with
non-synonymous SNPs (median ratio around 2.1) for all four
ancestry groups. For the het/nonref—hom ratio, there was no
difference between synonymous and non-synonymous SNPs
(Supplementary Table S2) observed. However, the strong vari-
ation between ancestry groups was present. Regardless of how
we divided the SNPs (by regions or by functionality) the het/
nonref-hom ratio patterns across the ancestry groups remained
the same.

Because regions with extreme GC—content are rare in the
human genome (Supplementary Figure S1), to balance the
denominator when computing ratios we deﬁned six unequal
GC-content bins: 0.0—0.3, 0.3—0.4, 0405, 0.5—0.6, 0.6—0.7 and
07—10 to give more GC-content range to regions with extreme
high or low GC—content values. The GC-content had a clear
non-linear effect on the Ti/Tv ratio (Fig. 4), with high and
low GC-content resulting in lower Ti/Tv ratios. A similar pat-
tern has been used to describe the effect of GC—content

on Illumina sequencing depth (Benjamini and Speed, 2012;
Guo et al., 2014). The regions with low GC—content (0—0.3)
and high GC—content (0.7—1) had relatively higher variation for
het/nonref-hom ratios than exons with moderate GC—content
(03—06) due to fewer SNPs observed in extreme GC—content
regions (Fig. 5). Again, the same ancestry variation described
previously for the het/nonref—hom ratio was observed. The dif-
ference of Ti/Tv ratios observed among regions can be poten-
tially explained by the differences of GC—content among these
regions. We computed GC-content of the ﬁve regions we deﬁned
and the results are as follow: miRNA: 0.51, exome: 0.49,
intronic: 0.42, lncRNA 0.40, intergenic: 0.38. The GC—content
is directly correlated with Ti/Tv ratio (Spearman’s correlation
coefﬁcient r = 0.9).

Using the exome sequencing data from the SBCS study and
whole-genome sequencing data from the colorectal cancer study,
we further validated our results. Because each of the two add-
itional studies only contained a single ancestry group, we could
not divide the SNPs further by ancestry groups. Overall, we
observed similar results for the two datasets compared to the
1000G dataset (Supplementary Figures S2 and S3). For the Ti/
Tv ratio, separated by region, the exome regions had the highest
value followed by intron regions. Intergenic regions and lncRNA
regions had similar values, lower than intron or exon regions.
Divided by functionality, synonymous SNPs had much higher
Ti/Tv ratios compared to non-synonymous SNPs (t-test: SBCS
P< 0.0001. Colorectal Cancer P< 0.0001). Stronger variations of
het/nonref-hom ratios among the regions and functionalities
were observed in the SBCS dataset. Due to the limitation of
sample size (N = 6) in the colorectal dataset, it is difﬁcult to
draw conclusions on the variation of the colorectal dataset for
het/nonref—hom ratio compared to the 1000G dataset. The
same conclusion can be reached regarding the GC—content
evaluation (Fig. 3). Extreme GC—content tends to produce
lower Ti/Tv ratios and relatively stable het/nonref—hom ratios
were observed for regions with GC—content between 0.3 and
0.7. Extreme GC—content produced a wider range in het/
nonref-hom ratio values.

Finally, we repeated our analyses of 1000G dataset by cate-
grizing the SNP data by subancestry group (Supplementary

Figures S4—S8). And the results were consistent with combined
ancestry group.

4 DISCUSSION

High-throughput sequencing technology allows researchers to
examine the human genome at the single nucleotide resolution
instead of just the subset of previously known SNPs available on
any genotyping array. One of the consequences of applying high-
throughput sequencing technology is the ability to detect a much
higher number of potential novel SNPs, which are generally un-
detectable by array technology. This advantage of high-through-
put sequencing technology also brings the need for highly
efﬁcient and accurate QC for the SNPs detected. The QC of
high-throughput sequencing data has been an important topic
in the ﬁeld of bioinformatics for the last few years. Within the
scope of QC for SNPs inferred from sequencing data, unlike
other QC parameters such as depth, genotype quality etc., the
Ti/Tv and het/nonref—hom ratios cannot be used directly to ﬁlter
individual SNPs but rather to measure the overall SNP quality
for a sequence. For example, from previous studies, we know
that SNPs in exome regions should have a Ti/Tv ratio of around
3. The general rule is that a higher Ti/Tv ratio usually indicates
better quality SNPs, as long as the ratio is not too high (>4). If
we observe a Ti/Tv ratio substantially lower than the expected
value (<3.0) for exome SNPs, we know that usually increasing
other QC ﬁlters such as depth and genotype quality score will
cause the Ti/Tv ratio to also increase.

From our study, we conclude that the Ti/Tv ratio is highly
dependent on the genome region and functionality. The exome
regions tend to have the highest Ti/Tv ratio for SNPs, followed
by intron regions. Intergenic regions and lncRNA regions have
lower and similar Ti/Tv ratios. Thus, when using Ti/Tv ratios as
a QC measurement, it is best to compute the Ti/Tv ratio by
region rather than as a whole. The majority of DNA high-
throughput sequencing studies focus on non-synonymous
rather than synonymous SNPs. We found that synonymous
SNPs have substantially higher Ti/Tv ratio than non-synonym-
ous SNPs. The Ti/Tv ratio of non-synonymous SNPs is rather
similar to the intergenic regions. The high Ti/Tv ratio of syn-
onymous SNPs compared to non-synonymous SNPs can be
explained through the probability of amino acid changes using
the amino acid table. Out of all possible changes within the
amino acid table, there are 33 synonymous transition and 36
synonymous transversions (random Ti/Tv ratio = 0.92) com-
pared with 63 non-synonymous transition and 156 non-
synonymous transversions (random Ti/Tv ratio = 0.40). Thus,
it is also useful to categorize exome SNPs by their functionality
before computing the Ti/Tv ratio. Futhermore, we found no
association between the Ti/Tv ratio and ancestry, thus high-
throughput sequencing studies on subjects of any ancestry
groups can use the reported Ti/Tv ratio thresholds in this
study as a QC guideline.

The het/nonref—hom ratio is not used as often as the Ti/Tv
ratio for QC because it has been suggested that the het/nonref—
hom ratio works best with whole-genome sequencing data, and
the price of whole-genome sequencing remains high (>$4000 per
sample) (Guo et al., 2013). Through our analyses, we found that
the het/nonref—hom ratio is not dependent on genomic regions,

thus it can be applied to exome regions alone and is also a rea-
sonable QC measure for exome sequencing data. The expected
value for the het/nonref—hom ratio in a whole-genome sequen-
cing SNP data has been mathematically proposed to be 2.0 (Guo
et al., 2013). However, our results show the het/nonref—hom ratio
is highly dependent on ancestry. Out of the four major contin-
ental ancestries we tested, only the African group showed a het/
nonref-hom ratio consistent with the expected value of 2.0. The
other three continental ancestry groups, American, Asian and
European, all had different het/nonref—hom ratios lower than
2.0. Since the Hardy—Weinberg equilibrium assumptions are
used to calculate the expected value of 2.0, perhaps the African
samples match the expected value because these assumptions are
more accurately achieved in that older population, while they
may be violated even subtly in the other three continental popu-
lations that have undergone several major bottlenecks through
global migrations. Whatever the cause, our data show that it is
important to evaluate the het/nonref—hom ratios separately by
ancestry group.

Last, we studied the effect of the GC—content on both ratios
and found that the het/nonref—hom ratio is not affected by GC-
content, and the Ti/Tv ratio is negatively associated with both
high and low extreme GC—content (0—30 and 70—100%). Thus,
when performing QC on a smaller region, it is beneﬁcial to com-
pute the GC—content of that region and adjust your Ti/Tv ratio
expectation based on the region’s GC-content.

Two additional datasets were used to validate the results we
found from the 1000G dataset. The majority of the results are in
agreement among the three datasets with some minor variation
among datasets. These variations could be caused by the differ-
ent sequencing technology used. The 1000G dataset was gener-
ated using a combination of low-pass whole-genome sequencing,
exome sequencing, target region sequencing and imputation. Of
the other two datasets, the SBCS study used exome sequencing,
and the colorectal cancer study used whole-genome sequencing,
and no imputation was performed. Also the variation could
result from sample size and phenotype differences. The 1000G
dataset contained signiﬁcantly more subjects and is a population
cohort, while the other two datasets contained breast cancer
and colorectal cancer patients at much smaller sample sizes.
Nonetheless, the two additional datasets provided supporting
evidence for the conclusions we have drawn based on the
1000G dataset analyses.

In conclusion, the Ti/Tv and het/nonref—hom ratios can both
be used as QC assessment of SNPs inferred from high-through-
put sequencing data, but care must be taken that the subject
ancestry and the function of the DNA sequenced (if not whole
genome) are taken into consideration when setting limits for the
reasonable values of these ratios. The ratio values provided in
this study can serve as general guidelines for future studies.

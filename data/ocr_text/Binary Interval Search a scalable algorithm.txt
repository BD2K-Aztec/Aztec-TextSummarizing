ABSTRACT

Motivation: The comparison of diverse genomic datasets is funda-
mental to understand genome biology. Researchers must explore
many large datasets of genome intervals (e.g. genes, sequence align-
ments) to place their experimental results in a broader context and to
make new discoveries. Relationships between genomic datasets are
typically measured by identifying intervals that intersect, that is, they
overlap and thus share a common genome interval. Given the contin-
ued advances in DNA sequencing technologies, efficient methods for
measuring statistically significant relationships between many sets of
genomic features are crucial for future discovery.

Results: We introduce the Binary Interval Search (BITS) algorithm, a
novel and scalable approach to interval set intersection. We demon-
strate that BITS outperforms existing methods at counting interval
intersections. Moreover, we show that BITS is intrinsically suited to
parallel computing architectures, such as graphics processing units by
illustrating its utility for efficient Monte Carlo simulations measuring the
significance of relationships between sets of genomic intervals.

1 INTRODUCTION

Searching for intersecting intervals in multiple sets of genomic
features is crucial to nearly all genomic analyses. For example,
interval intersection is used to compare ChIP enrichment be-
tween experiments and cell types, identify potential regulatory
targets and compare genetic variation among many individuals.
Interval intersection is the fundamental operation in a broader
class of “genome arithmetic’ techniques, and as such, it underlies
the functionality found in many genome analysis software pack-
ages (Giardine et al., 2005; Kent et al., 2002; Li et al., 2009;
Quinlan and Hall, 2011).

As high-throughput sequencing technologies have become
the de facto molecular tool for genome biology, there is an
acute need for efﬁcient approaches to interval intersection.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Microarray techniques for measuring gene expression and chro-
matin states have been largely supplanted by sequencing-based
techniques, and whole-exome and whole-genome experiments
are now routine. Consequently, most genomics laboratories
now conduct analyses including datasets with billions of
genome intervals. Experiments of this size require substantial
computation time per pairwise comparison. Moreover, typical
analyses require comparisons with many large sets of genomic
features (where set size refers to the number of intervals in the
set). Existing approaches scale poorly and are already reaching
their performance limits. We, therefore, argue the need for new
scalable algorithms to allow discovery to keep pace with the scale
and complexity of modern datasets.

In this manuscript, we introduce the Binary Interval Search
(BITS) algorithm as a novel and scalable solution to the funda-
mental problem of counting the number of intersections between
two sets of genomic intervals. BITS uses two binary searches
(one each for start and end coordinates) to identify intersecting
intervals. As such, our algorithm executes in @(NlogN) time,
where N is the number of intervals, which can be shown to be
optimal for the interval intersection counting problem by a
straightforward reduction to element uniqueness (known to be
@(NlogN) (Mirsa and Gries, 1982). In contrast, counting inter-
sections by enumeration is less efﬁcient, as enumerating intervals
requires time ®(M + N log N), where M is the number of inter-
sections that can be quadratic to the input size. We illustrate that
a sequential version of BITS outperforms existing approaches
and show that BITS is intrinsically suited to parallel architec-
tures. The parallel version performs the same amount of work
as the sequential version (i.e. there is no overhead), which means
the algorithm is work efﬁcient, and because each parallel
thread performs equivalent work, BITS has little thread diver-
gence. Although thread divergence degrades performance on any
architecture (ﬁnished threads must wait for overburdened
threads to complete), the impact is particularity acute for graph-
ics processing units (GPUs) where threads share a program
counter and any divergent instruction must be executed on
every thread.

1.1 The interval set intersection problem

We begin by reviewing some basic deﬁnitions. A genomic interval
is a continuous stretch of a genome with a chromosomal start
and end location (e.g. a gene), and a genomic interval set is a col-
lection of genomic intervals (e. g. all known genes). Two intervals

a and b intersect when (a.start f bend) and (a.end Z b.start).
The intersection of two interval sets A = {a1,a2, ...,aN} and
B 2 {b1, b2, ...,bM} is the set of interval pairs:

Z(A,B) = {(a,b)|a e A,b e B,

a.start f b.end/\ a.end Z b.start}

Intervals within a set can intersect, but self-intersections
are not included in Z (A, B). There are four natural
sub-problems for interval set intersection: (i) decision—does
there exist at least one interval in A that intersects an interval
in B?; (ii) counting—how many total intersections exist between
sets A and B?; (iii) per-interval counting—how many intervals in
B intersect each interval in A?; (iv) enumeration—what is the set
of each pairwise interval intersections between A an B? Although
BITS solves all four sub-problems, it is designed to efﬁciently
count the number of intersections between two sets, and as such,
it excels at the decision, counting and per-interval counting
problems.

1.2 Limits to parallelization

Interval intersection has many applications in genomics, and
several algorithms have been developed that, in general, are
either based on trees (Alekseyenko and Lee, 2007; Kent et al.,
2002) or linear sweeps of pre—sorted intervals (Richardson, 2006).

The UCSC Genome Browser introduced a widely used scheme
based on R-trees. This approach partitions intervals from one
dataset into hierarchical ‘bins’. Intervals from a second dataset
are then compared with matching bins (not the entire dataset)
to narrow the search for intersections to a focused portion of
the genome. Although this approach is used by the UCSC
Genome Browser, BEDTools (Quinlan and Hall, 2011) and
SAMTOOLS (Li et al., 2009), the algorithm is inefﬁcient for
counting intersections, as all intervals in each candidate bin
must be enumerated to count the intersections. As the number
of intersections is at most quadratic, any enumeration-based al-
gorithm is 0(N2).

Moreover, these existing approaches are poor candidates
for parallelization. Thread divergence can be a signiﬁcant
problem for hierarchical binning methods. If intervals are not
uniformly distributed (e.g. exome sequencing or RNA-seq),
then a small number of bins will contain many intervals, whereas
most other bins are empty. Consequently, threads searching full
bins will take substantially longer than threads searching empty
bins. In contrast, BITS counts intersections directly without enu-
merating intersecting intervals; therefore, the underlying interval
distribution does not impact the relative workload of each
thread.

Recent versions of BEDTools and BEDOPS (Neph et al.,
2012) conduct a linear ‘sweep’ through pre—sorted datasets
while maintaining an auxiliary data structure to track intersec-
tions as they are encountered. Although the complexity of such
sequential sweep algorithms is theoretically optimal, the amount
of parallelism that exists is limited, and some overhead is
required to guarantee correctness. Any linear sweep algorithm
must maintain the ‘sweep invariant’ (McKenney and McGuire,
2009), which states that all segment starts and ends, and inter-
sections behind the sweep must be known. A parallel sweep

algorithm must either partition the input space such that each
section can be swept in parallel without violating the invariant or
threads must communicate about intervals that span partitions.
In the ﬁrst case, parallelism is limited to the number of partitions
that can be created, and threads can diverge when the number of
intervals in each partition is unbalanced. In the second case, the
communication overhead between threads prevents work efﬁ-
ciency and can have signiﬁcant performance implications. In
BITS, the amount of parallelism depends only on the number
of intervals and not on the distribution of intervals within the
input space, and there is no communication between threads.

2 METHODS

A seemingly facile method for ﬁnding the intersection of A and B would
be to treat one set, A, as a ‘query’ set, and the other, B, as a ‘database’.
If all of the intervals in the database were sorted by their starting coord-
inates, it would seem that binary searches could be used for each query to
identify all intersecting database intervals.

However, this apparently straightforward searching algorithm is com-
plicated by a subtle, yet vexing detail. If the intervals in B are sorted by
their starting positions, then a binary search of B for the query interval
end position a,-.end a,-.end will return the interval bj e B, where 17,- is the
last interval in B that starts before interval a,- ends (e.g. interval e in
Fig. 1A). This would seem to imply that if 17,- does not intersect a,-, then
no intervals in B intersect a,-, and if 17,- does intersect a,-, then other inter-
secting intervals in B could be found by scanning the intervals starting
before 17,- in decreasing order, stopping at the ﬁrst interval that does not
intersect a,-. However, this technique is complicated by the possibility
of intervals that are wholly contained inside other intervals (e. g. interval
c in Fig. 1B).

An interval bj e B is ‘contained’ if there exists an interval bk 6 B where
bkstart 5 bj.start and bj.end 5 bk.end. Considering such intervals, if
the interval found in the previous binary search bj does not intersect
the query interval a,-, we cannot conclude that no interval in B intersects
a,- because there may exist an interval bj_x e B where bj_x.end 5 a,-.start.
Furthermore, if bj does intersect a,-, then the subsequent scan for other
intersecting intervals cannot stop at the ﬁrst interval that does not inter-
sect a,-; it is possible that some earlier containing interval intersects a,-.
Therefore, the scan is forced to continue until it reaches the beginning of
the list. As contained intervals are typical in genomic datasets, a naive
binary search solution is inviable.

2.1 Binary Interval Search algorithm

We now introduce our new Binary Interval Search (BITS) algo-
rithm for solving the interval set intersection problem. This algo-
rithm uses two binary searches to identify interval intersections while
avoiding the aforementioned complexities caused by contained
intervals. The key observation underlying BITS is that the size of the
intersection between two sets can be determined without enume-
rating each intersection. For each interval in the query set, two binary
searches are performed to determine the number of intervals in the
database that intersect the query interval. Each pair of searches is in-
dependent of all others, and thus all searches can be performed in
parallel.

Existing methods deﬁne the intersection set based on inclusion, that is,
the set of intervals in the interval database B that end after the query
interval a,- begins, and which begin before a,- ends. However, we have seen
that contained intervals make it difﬁcult to ﬁnd this set directly with a
single binary search.

Fig. 1. Comparing a naive binary search for interval intersection to the
BITS approach. (A) Binary searches of intervals sorted by start coordin-
ate will occasionally identify overlapping intervals. However, contained
intervals prevent knowing how far one must scan the database to identify
all intersections. (B) Contained intervals also cause single binary searches
to falsely conclude that no intersections exist for a given query interval.
(C) To overcome these limitations, BITS uses two binary searches of the
database intervals: one into a sorted list of end coordinates and the other
into a sorted list of start coordinates. Each search excludes database
intervals that cannot intersect the query, leaving solely the intervals that
must intersect the query

Our algorithm uses a different, but equivalent, deﬁnition of interval
intersection based on exclusion, that is, by identifying the set of intervals
in B that cannot intersect a,-, we can infer how many intervals must inter-
sect a,-. Formally, we deﬁne the set of intervals I (B, a,) e B that intersect
query interval a,- e A to be the intervals in B that are neither in the set of
intervals ending before (‘left of’, set 5 below) a,- begins nor in the set of
intervals starting after (‘right of’, set R below) a,- ends. That is:

£(B, ai) = {b E Blb.end< ai.start}
R(B, a,-) = {b E Blb.start>a,-.end}
713» at) = B\(£(Bs at) U 73(39 at»
Finding the intervals in I(a,-, B) for each a,- e A by taking the differ-

ence of B and the union of £(B, a,) and R(B, ai) is not efﬁcient. However,
we can quickly ﬁnd the size of £(B, a,) and the size R(B, a,) and then infer

the size of I(B, a,). With the size of I(B, a,), we can directly answer the
decision problem, the counting problem and the per-interval counting
problems. The size of I(B,a,-) also serves as the termination condition
for enumerating intersections that were missing in the naive binary search
solution.

c <— first — last /* = |B| — (last —l—  — first» */
return 0

 

The BITS algorithm is based on one fundamental function,
ICOUNT(BS,BE,a,-) = |1'(B,a,)| (Algorithm 1), which determines the
number of intervals in the database B that intersect query interval a,-.
As shown in Figure 1C, the database B is split into two integer
lists BS 2 [b1.start,b2.start, ...bM.start] and BE 2 [b1.end,b2.end, 
bM.end], which are each sorted numerically in ascending order. Next,
two binary searches are performed, last = BSEARCH(BE,a,-.start) and
first = BSEARCH(BS,a,-.end). As BE is a sorted list of each interval end
coordinate in B, the elements with indices less than or equal to last in BE
correspond to the set of intervals in B that end before a,- starts (i.e. to the
‘left’ of a,-). Similarly, the elements with indices greater than or equal to
first in BS correspond to the set of intervals in B that start after a,- ends
(i.e. to the ‘right’ of a,-). From these two values, we can directly infer
the size of the intersection set I(B,a,-) (i.e. the count of intersections in
B for a,-):

|B| —fiVSt = |R(B,ar)l
last = |£(B, ai)|
|B| — (last + (131 —first)) = 11w, am

Using the subroutine ICOUNT(BS, BE, a,-), all four interval set intersec-
tion problem variants can be solved. Pseudocode for the decision,
per-interval counting and enumeration sub-problems can be found in the
Supplementary Material.

2.1.1 The BITS solution to the counting problem As BITS
operates on arrays of generic intervals ((start,end)), and input ﬁles are
typically chromosomal intervals ((chrom, start, end)), the intervals in each
dataset are ﬁrst projected down to a 1D generic interval. This is a
straightforward process that adds an offset associated with the size of
each chromosome to the start and end of each interval. The resulting
interval arrays A and B are input to the COUNTER (Algorithm 2) that
sets the accumulator variable c to zero; then for each a,- e A, accumulates
c = c + ICOUNT(BS, BE, a,). The total count c is returned.

2.2 Time complexity analysis

The time complexity of BITS is O((|A| + |B|)longl), which can be
shown to be optimal by a straightforward reduction to element unique-
ness (known to be @(NlogN) (Mirsa and Gries, 1982). To compute
ICOUNT(BS, BE, a,-) for each a,- in A, the interval set B is ﬁrst split into
two sorted integer lists BS and BE, which requires O(|B| log|B|) time.
Next, each instance of ICOUNT(BS,BE,a,-) searches both BS and BE,
which consumes O(|A| log |B|) time. For the counting problems, combin-
ing the results of all ICOUNT(BS, BE, ai) instances into a ﬁnal result can be
accomplished in O(|A|) time.

2.3 Parallel BITS

Performing a single operation independently on many different inputs
is a classic parallelization scenario. When based on the sub-routine
ICOUNT(BS,BE, a) , which is independent of all ICOUNT(BS,BE,X) for
intervals x in the query set where a 75 x, counting interval intersections
is a pleasingly parallelizable problem that easily maps to a number of
parallel architectures.

NVIDIA’s CUDA is a single instruction multiple data (SIMD) archi-
tecture that provides a general interface to a large number of parallel
GPUs. The GPU is organized into multiple SIMD processing units,
and the processors within a unit operate in lock-step. The BITS algorithm
is especially well suited for this architecture for a number of reasons.
First, CUDA is optimized to handle large numbers of threads. By assign-
ing each thread, one instance of ICOUNT(BS,BE, a), the number of
threads will be proportional to the input size. CUDA threads also execute
in lock-step and any divergence between threads will cause reduced
thread utilization. Although there is some divergence in the depth of
each binary search performed by ICOUNT(BS,BE, a), it has an upper
bound of O(log |B|). Outside of this divergence, ICOUNT(BS,BE, a) is a

structure required for this algorithm are a sorted array, and thanks to
years of research in this area, current GPU sorting algorithms can sort
billions of integers within seconds (Merrill and Grimshaw, 2011; Satish
et al., 2009).

3 RESULTS

3.1 Comparing BITS to extant sequential approaches

We implemented a sequential version of the BITS algorithm
(‘BITS-SEQ’) as a stand-alone C++ utility. Here, we assess the
performance of this implementation relative to BEDTools
intersect and UCSC Genome Browser’s (‘UCSC’) (Kent
et al., 2002) bedIntersect utilities (see Supplementary
Material for details). We compare the performance of each tool
for counting the total number of observed intersections between
sets of intervals of varying sizes (Fig. 2). The comparisons pre-
sented are based on sequence alignments for the CEU individual
NA12878 by the 1000 Genomes Project (The 1000 Genomes
Project Consortium, 2010), as well as RefSeq exons. Owing to
the different data structures used by each algorithm, the relative
performance of each approach may depend on the genomic dis-
tribution of intervals within the sets. As discussed previously,
tree-based solutions that place intervals into hierarchical bins
may perform poorly when intervals are unevenly distributed
among the bins. We tested the impact of differing interval distri-
butions on algorithm performance by randomly sampling 1
and 10 million alignment intervals from both whole-genome
and exome-capture datasets for NA12878 (see Supplementary
Material). Each algorithm was evaluated considering three differ-
ent interval intersection scenarios. First, we tested intervals from
diﬂerent distributions by comparing the intersection between
exome-capture alignments and whole-genome alignments. As

each set has a large number of intervals and a different genomic
distribution, we expect a small (relative to the set size) number of
intersections. We also tested a uniform distribution by counting
intersections between Refseq exons and whole-genome sequen-
cing alignments. Here, each interval set is, for the most part,
evenly distributed throughout the genome; thus, we expect each
exon to intersect roughly the same number of sequencing inter-
vals, and a large number of sequencing intervals will not intersect
an exon. Finally, we assessed a biased intersection distribution
between exons and exome-capture alignments. By design, exome
sequencing experiments intentionally focus collected DNA se-
quences to the coding exons. Thus, the vast majority of sequence
intervals will align in exonic regions. In contrast to the previous
scenario, nearly every exon interval will have a large number of
sequence interval intersections, and nearly all sequencing intervals
will intersect an exon.

3.1.1 BITS excels at counting intersections In all three interval
distribution scenarios, the sequential version of BITS had super-
ior runtime performance for counting intersections. BITS was
between 11.2 and 27.9 times faster than BEDTools and between
1.2 and 5.2 times faster than UCSC (Fig. 2). This behaviour is
expected, whereas the BEDTools and UCSC tree-based algo-
rithms must enumerate intersections to derive the count, BITS
infers the intersection count by exclusion without enumeration.

3.1.2 BITS excels at large intersections and biased
distributions The relative performance gains of the BITS
approach are enhanced for large datasets (Fig. 2B). As tree-based
methods have a ﬁxed number of bins, and searches require a
linear scan of each associated bin, the number of intervals
searched grows linearly with respect to the input size. In the
worst-case where all intervals are in a single bin, a search
would scan the entire input set. In contrast, BITS uses binary
searches; hence, the number of operations is proportional to
log10g of the input size, regardless of the input distribution.
Similarly, exome-capture experiments yield biased distributions
of intervals among the UCSC bins. Consequently, most bins in
tree-based methods will contain no intervals, whereas a small
fraction contain many intervals. When the query intervals have
the same bias, the overhead of the UCSC algorithm is more oner-
ous, as a small number of bins are queried and each queried bin
contains many intersecting intervals that must be enumerated to
count overlaps. As the BITS algorithm is agnostic to the interval
distributions, it will outperform the UCSC algorithm (Fig. 2A
and B) for common genomic analyses, such as ChIP-seq and
RNA-seq, especially given the massive size of these datasets.

3.2 Applications for Monte Carlo simulations

Identifying statistically signiﬁcant relationships between sets of
genome intervals is fundamental to genomic research. However,
owing to our complex evolutionary history, different classes of
genomic features have distinct genomic distributions, and as
such, testing for signiﬁcance can be challenging. One widely
used, yet computationally intensive, alternative solution is the
use of Monte Carlo (MC) simulations that compare observed
interval relationships to an expectation based on randomization.
All aspects of the BITS algorithm are particularly well suited for
MC simulations measuring relationships between interval sets.

aTimings in italics were extrapolated owing to long run times.

As described, all intersection algorithms begin detecting intersec-
tions between two interval sets by setting up their underlying
data structures (e.g. trees or arrays). The BITS set-up process
involves mapping each interval from the 2D chromosomal inter-
val space (i.e. chromosome and start/end coordinates) to a 1D
integer interval space (i.e. start/end coordinates ranging from 1
to the total genome size). Once the intervals are mapped, arrays
are sorted by either start or end coordinates. In contrast, the
UCSC set-up places each interval into a hash table. As shown
in Figure 2, data structure set-up is a signiﬁcant portion of the
runtime for all approaches.

However, in the case of many MC simulation rounds, where
a uniformly distributed random interval set is generated and
placed into the associated data structure, the set-up step is
faster in BITS, whereas the set-up time remains constant in
each simulation round for UCSC. For BITS, the mapping step
is skipped in all but the ﬁrst round, and in each simulation
round, only an array of random starts must be generated. The
result is a 6x speed-up for MC rounds over the cost of the initial
intersection set-up. For UCSC, both the chromosome and the
interval start position must be generated and then placed into the
hash table with no change in execution time.

This speed-up in BITS is extended on parallel platforms, where
the independence of each intersection is combined with efﬁcient
parallel random number generation algorithms (Tzeng and Wei,
2008) and parallel sorting algorithms (Merrill and Grimshaw,
2011; Satish et al., 2009). MC simulations have obvious task
parallelism, as each round is independent. BITS running on
CUDA (‘BITS-CUDA’) goes a step further and exposes
ﬁne-grain parallelism in both the set-up step, with parallel
random number generation and parallel sorting, and the inter-
section step where hundreds of intersections execute in parallel.
The improvement is modest for a single intersection (only paral-
lel sorting can be applied to the set-up step) where BITS-CUDA
is 4x faster than sequential BITS and 40x faster than sequential
UCSC. However, as the number of MC rounds grows, perform-
ance improves dramatically. At 10 000 MC rounds and 1e7 inter-
vals, BITS-CUDA is 267x faster than sequential BITS and
3414x faster than sequential UCSC. An improvement of this
scale allows MC analyses for thousands of experiments (e.g.
25 281 pairwise comparisons in Section 3.3).

BITS

 

Project Consortium, 2007) for the GM12878, Hl-hESC and
K562 cell lines, including assays for 24 transcriptions factors
(often with replicates), 8 histone modiﬁcations, open chromatin
and DNA methylation. We also included diverse genome anno-
tations from the UCSC genome browser (e. g. repeats, genes and
conserved regions).

Using BITS-CUDA, we measured the log2 ratio of the
observed and expected number of intersections for each of the
25281 (i.e. 159* 159) pairwise dataset relationships using le4
MC simulations (Fig. 3). As expected, this analysis revealed
that (i) the genomic locations for the same functional element
are largely consistent across replicates and cell types; (ii) methy-
lated and semi-methylated regions are similar across cell types;
and (iii) most functional assays were anti-correlated with gen-
omic repeats (e.g. microsatellites) owing to sequence alignment
strategies that exclude repetitive genomic regions. Perhaps not
surprisingly, this unbiased screen also revealed intriguing pat-
terns. First, the strong enrichment among all transcription fac-
tors (TF) assays suggests that a subset of TF binding sites is
shared among all factors. This observation is consistent with
previous descriptions of ‘hot regions’ (Gerstein et al., 2010).
In addition, there is a signiﬁcant, speciﬁc and unexplained
enrichment among the Six5 TF and segmental duplications.

Pursuing the biology of these relationships is beyond the scope
of the current manuscript; however, we emphasize that the ability
to efﬁciently conduct such large-scale screens facilitates novel
insights into genome biology. This analysis presented a tremen-
dous computational burden made feasible by the facility with
which the BITS algorithm could be applied to GPU architec-
tures. Indeed, each iteration of our MC simulation was tested
for intersections among 4 billion intervals among the 25 000
datasets, yielding >44 trillion comparisons for the entire simula-
tion. Although this simulation took 9069 min on a single com-
puter with one GPU card, we estimate that it would take at least
112 traditional processors to conduct the same analysis using
standard approaches, such as the UCSC tools or BEDTools.

4 CONCLUSION

We have developed a novel algorithm for interval intersection
that is uniquely suited to scalable computing architectures, such
as GPUs. Our algorithm takes a new approach to counting inter-
sections: unlike existing methods that must enumerate intersec-
tions to derive a count, BITS uses two binary searches to directly
infer the count by excluding intervals that cannot intersect one
another.

We have demonstrated that a sequential implementation of
BITS outperforms existing tools and illustrated that BITS is
task efﬁcient and highly parallelizable. BITS is also memory ef-
ﬁcient: our MC simulation required 217 Mb of random access
memory and the sequential implementation consumed 412 Mb of
random access memory, versus 790 Mb for UCSC and 3588 Mb
for BEDTools. We show that a GPU implementation of BITS is,
therefore, a superior solution for MC analyses of statistical rela-
tionships between genome intervals sets.

Given the efﬁciency with which the BITS algorithm counts
intersections, it is also well suited to other genomic analyses,

including RNA-seq transcript quantiﬁcation, ChIP-seq peak
detection and searches for copy-number and structural variation.
Moreover, the functional and regulatory data produced by pro-
jects, such as ENCODE, have led to new approaches (Favorov
et al., 2012) for measuring relationships among genomic features.
We recognize the importance of scalable approaches for
detecting such relationships, and we anticipate that our new
algorithm will foster new genome mining tools for the genomics
community.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Despite a growing interest in a correlation between copy
number variations (CNVs) and flanking single nucleotide polymorph-
isms, few databases provide such information. In particular, most
information on CNV available so far was obtained in Caucasian and
Yoruba populations, and little is known about CNV in Asian popula-
tions. This article presents a database that provides CNV regions
tagged by single nucleotide polymorphisms in about 4700 Koreans,
which were detected under strict quality control, manually curated and
experimentally validated.

1 INTRODUCTION

To date, single-marker association analysis in genome-wide as-
sociation studies (GWAS) has identiﬁed a large number of single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are highly associated with
complex diseases, but only a small portion of genetic heritability
is explained by these variants. A copy number variation (CNV) is
a physical change of genomic segment ranging from a kilobase to
several megabases. CNV may inﬂuence disease susceptibility and
has been proposed to be one potential source of missing herit-
ability (Jarick et al., 2011). A recent study also found a strong
functional relevance of CNV with complex diseases (Gamazon
et al., 2011). However, the extent to which CNV impacts disease
susceptibility and underlies complex traits has yet to be fully
determined. The CNV association study conducted by the
Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) reported
that common CNVs typed on existing platforms are unlikely to
contribute to the genetic basis of common diseases ONellcome
Trust Case Control Consortium, 2010). However, only about
40% of the identified CNVs (3432 multi-class CNVs) were well

separated enough to be genotyped. In contrast, 60% of the
CNVs could not be tested for association (Supplementary Fig.
S1). Moreover, well-defined polymorphic CNVs tagged by SNPs
are more likely to affect multiple expression traits than fre-
quency-matched variants (Gamazon et al., 2011). CNVs encom-
passing single genes or a set of genes may be more likely to be the
causative variants of a given genetic disease than tagged SNPs.
Therefore, SNPs correlated with CNVs are a valuable resource
for GWAS.

Most CNV databases do not consider multi-copy number
classes (Gamazon et al., 2010; Iafrate et al., 2004; Shaikh
et al., 2009). The SCAN database is an exception in that it in-
cludes the latter, but it only contains data from Caucasian and
Yoruban populations, and Asian populations are completely
absent. Owing to the difference in CNVs between distinct
ethnic groups, providing polymorphic CNVs and allele fre-
quency of each genotype in Asian populations will help investi-
gate CNV association with diseases and ethnic differences.

Recently, we developed a database called Korean Genomic
Variant Database (KGVDB), which provides multi-class CNV
regions and well-tagged SNP information. The data were
obtained from 4694 individuals using two different genotyping
platforms and publicly available CNV data. The large dataset of
KGVDB will provide a rich public resource for the study of
CNV and SNP.

2 CONTENTS AND FEATURES

2.1 Resources

Data on CNV regions and breakpoints were constructed using
two types of resources: data from a large-scale Korean CNV
study including SNP information from GWAS (Cho et al.,
2009) and publicly available CNV data (Supplementary Table
S1). To define exact polymorphic CNV regions in the large-
scale Korean CNV study, we used two different genotyping plat-
forms (Fig. l):

o A total of 4694 Korean individuals that were genotyped on
both the NimbleGen HD2 3 x 720K aCGH assay with the
HapMap sample (NA10851) as a reference and the
Affymetrix genome-wide human SNP array 5.0
(Supplementary Fig. S2)

For CNV discovery, the Genome Alteration Detection
Analysis software was used to ascertain CNV regions from the
two platforms (Pique-Regi et al., 2008). To assign individuals to
copy number classes (CNV genotyping), all the detected CNV
regions were examined by the CNVtools software (Barnes et al.,
2008). Among these regions, only multi-copy number classes
were selected. Moreover, all the results of CNVtools were manu-
ally curated by visual inspection to discriminate false positive
CNV calls. Finally, 3601 multi-class CNVs and tagging SNPs
were deﬁned (see Supplementary Fig. S3).

Three public resources of CNVs and tagging SNPs were used
to build KGVDB (see Supplementary Fig. S4 and
Supplementary Table S1). Because CNV tagging SNPs of
SCAN database are based on WTCCC CNV results, CNVs
information of WTCCC study will help compare with our CNVs.

o A total of 20 Yoruba and 20 Caucasian individuals from the
WTCCC CNV study (Conrad et al., 2010)

o A total of 30 Asian individuals including 10 Koreans from
the Genomic Medicine Institute CNV study (Park et al.,
2010)

o 1000 genomes project deletion regions (Mills et al., 2011)

To ﬁnd well-tagging CNVs with SNP, we calculated the
squared Pearson’s r value between all CNVs (i.e. curated
polymorphic CNVs from large-scale Korean study and CNVs
from public online resources) and SNPs from the Affymetrix

5.0 array (SNP call rate >0.98) (Cho et al., 2009; see
Supplementary Fig. S4). We considered all SNPs within le
of the estimated 2 CNV breakpoints (i.e. start and end points).
KGVDB allows users to get all of the tagging SNP information
clicking on each CNV region (Supplementary Fig. S5 and
Supplementary Fig. S6). Moreover, frequencies of the HapMap
population and those of Korean population corresponding tag-
ging SNPs were also provided.

Even small differences of quality in the underlying CNV meas-
urements could lead to an artifactual shift in the copy number
distribution (Aldhous et al., 2010). Especially, it is important to
eliminate incorrect CNVs, which were affected by reference-
induced CNV calling bias. To provide copy number state of the
reference, KGVDB provides logz ratio value of the NA10851
using two platforms (NimbleGen 42M and 720K aCGH) with
48 Korean pooled samples as a reference as well as the depth-
of—coverage of the NA10851 from the whole-genome sequencing
study (Park et al., 2010). This information enables users to con-
sider copy number state of the reference sample at the correspond-
ing coordinate to a CNV region. KGVDB also allows users to get
information from GWAS catalog and Database of Genomic
Variants (Hindorff et al., 2009; Iafrate et al., 2004).

2.2 Web interface and example

KGVDB has been implemented using MySQL database with
Java Server Page. Users can access KGVDB in any web browser
with simple queries such as coordinate of genomic site and gene
name.

Example: In a previous study by Gamazon et al. (2011), over-
lap between trait-associated SNPs and its tagging CNVs of
WTCCC study has been observed. We compared the squared
Pearson’s r value of tagging SNP of WTCCC study with those
of our data (see Supplementary Table S2 and Supplementary
Fig. S3). Most squared Pearson’s r values of tagging SNPs
agree with ours. However, in the case of rsl2l91877 tagging
the CNVR2841.6 (chr6: 31384505-31397416), which is associated
with psoriasis and AIDS progression, the squared Pearson’s r
value of CEU/YRI is 0.90, whereas those of Koreans is 0.51
(Supplementary Table S2), suggesting that this discrepancy
may reﬂect ethnic differences.

3 CONCLUSION

We constructed a database called KGVDB, which provides poly-
morphic CNVs tagged with SNPs. The major features of KGVDB
that are different from others include the following: (i) poly-
morphic CNV regions identiﬁed under strict quality controls
and manual curation; (ii) CNV information from Korean popu-
lations to supplement currently biased ethnic information; (iii)
large dataset of CNVs tagged with SNPs from 4694 individuals
using two different genotyping platforms (SNP array and CGH
array); (iv) rich information on tagging SNPs, including frequen-
cies in HapMap populations; and (v) copy number states of the
reference sample using logz ratios from two kinds of CGH data
and the depth of coverage from whole-genome sequencing data.

In conclusion, KGVDB is a rich resource of the genomic vari-
ants, which will complement the lack of Asian CNV data.
In particular, correlation data like rsl2l91877 tagging the

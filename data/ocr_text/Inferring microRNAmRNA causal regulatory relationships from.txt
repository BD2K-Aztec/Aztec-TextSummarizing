ABSTRACT

Motivation: microRNAs (miRNAs) are known to play an essential role
in the post-transcriptional gene regulation in plants and animals.
Currently, several computational approaches have been developed
with a shared aim to elucidate miRNA—mRNA regulatory relationships.
Although these existing computational methods discover the statistical
relationships, such as correlations and associations between miRNAs
and mRNAs at data level, such statistical relationships are not neces-
sarily the real causal regulatory relationships that would ultimately pro-
vide useful insights into the causes of gene regulations. The standard
method for determining causal relationships is randomized controlled
perturbation experiments. In practice, however, such experiments are
expensive and time consuming. Our motivation for this study is to
discover the miRNA—mRNA causal regulatory relationships from
observational data.

Results: We present a causality discovery-based method to uncover
the causal regulatory relationship between miRNAs and mRNAs, using
expression profiles of miRNAs and mRNAs without taking into consid-
eration the previous target information. We apply this method to the
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) datasets and validate the
computational discoveries by a controlled biological experiment for
the miR-200 family. A significant portion of the regulatory relationships
discovered in data is consistent with those identified by experiments.
In addition, the top genes that are causally regulated by miRNAs are
highly relevant to the biological conditions of the datasets. The results
indicate that the causal discovery method effectively discovers miRNA
regulatory relationships in data. Although computational predictions
may not completely replace intervention experiments, the accurate
and reliable discoveries in data are cost effective for the design
of miRNA experiments and the understanding of miRNA—mRNA
regulatory relationships.

1 INTRODUCTION

microRNAs (miRNAs) are short (~22 nt) endogenous
non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression by promoting
mRNA degradation and repressing translation. They recognize
target mRNAs by base pairing to complementary sequences in
the 3’-untranslated region (3’-UTR) of the target mRNA
(Ambros, 2004; Bartel, 2004; Berezikov et al., 2006; Meister
and Tuschl, 2004). miRNAs have also been observed to target
genes through sites in the 5’-UTR and sometimes in the open
reading frames (Bartel, 2009). It has been demonstrated in a
body of literature that miRNAs regulate a wide range of biolo-
gical processes in proliferation (Chen et al., 2006; Zhao et al.,
2005), metabolism (Poy et al., 2004), differentiation (Esquela—
Kerscher and Slack, 2006), development (J in et al., 2004), apop-
tosis (Xu et al., 2007), cellular signalling (Cui et al., 2006) and
even cancer development and progression (Bartel, 2004; Kim and
Nam, 2006).

Since the advent of microarray data on gene expression pro-
grams, various statistical data mining methods have been devised
in recent years in an attempt to discover the miRNA—mRNA
regulatory relationships. This research into the regulatory rela-
tionships between miRNAs and mRNAs can be recognized in
two main streams. In the ﬁrst stream, researchers developed vari-
ous methods to identify a group of co-expressed miRNAs and
mRNAs in data. For instance, Huang et a]. (2007) applied
Bayesian network parameter learning, J oung et a]. (2007) pro-
posed a population-based probabilistic learning model and Tran
et a]. (2008) used a rule-based method. In the second stream,
attempts were made to predict the regulatory networks
of miRNAs and mRNAs for speciﬁc biological processes.
Some highlights in this direction include Joung and Fei (2009)
applying a probabilistic graphic model adopted from the author-
topic model in information retrieval, Liu et a]. (2009) using
Bayesian network learning and Liu et a]. (2010) proposing a
graphical model inspired by the correspondence latent Dirichlet
allocation.

These methods, although varied, all identify only the statistical
relationships in the data. These relationships are either correl-
ations or associations between the two types of variables,
miRNA and mRNA. However, correlations or associations are
not causality. For instance, the expression values of an miRNA

and an mRNA may be strongly correlated across samples, but
it is not sufﬁcient to conclude that the miRNA regulates
the mRNA. The strong correlation between the miRNA and
the mRNA may be a result of the mRNA regulating the
miRNA, or a third molecule regulating both the miRNA and
the mRNA.

In this article, our ultimate goal is to discover which miRNAs
causally regulate which mRNAs. A regulatory relationship
between an miRNA and an mRNA means that a change in
the expression level of the miRNA will result in a change in
the expression level of the mRNA. Associations or correlations
are not the right tools to test the causal hypothesis. Therefore,
we aim to discover the causal effects of an miRNA on an
mRNAs. We refer to this causal effect as miRNA causal regula-
tory relationship to emphasize the difference between causal
discovery and statistical discovery.

The gold standard method for tackling this problem is
randomized control experiments. For example, we can use gene
knockdown experiments to knockdown miRNAs one by one
while measuring changes (i.e. causal effects) in the expression
level of mRNAs. However, such experiments are time consum-
ing, expensive and not necessarily deﬁnitive. Fortunately, with
the foundation created by Pearl (2000), the recent advances in
causal discovery research have opened the door to discovering
causal relationships from observational data.

Instead of conducting controlled experiments, we can use
do-calculus (Pearl, 2000) to estimate the causal effects of a vari-
able on other variables based on observational data. The
do-calculus requires a causal structure of the variables to be
given as a DAG (directed acyclic graph); however, such a struc-
ture is often unknown in reality. To bridge the gap, Maathuis
et al. (2009, 2010) proposed a method to estimate causal effects
from observational data alone. The method is called intervention
calculus when the DAG is absent (IDA), and it includes two
main phases: (i) to learn a causal structure from observational
data and (ii) to apply do-calculus to infer causal effects.

Our method is based on IDA. Given the observational data of
variables, IDA can capture the causal effects of the variables on
one single response variable. We extend the application of IDA
and build our model for multiple response variables, and then
apply the model to discover the miRNA causal regulatory rela-
tionships. In our problem, miRNAs and mRNAs are nodes or
variables in the model, and observational data are the expression
proﬁles of the miRNAs and mRNAs. We can view genes as
subjects and miRNAs as analogous to ‘treatments’, which may
have causal effects on the ‘responses’ (i.e. expression levels) of the
genes. Our aim is to measure the causal effect of each miRNA on
mRNAs.

Applying this approach, we tackle two drawbacks of current
miRNA regulatory relationships research. First, the method
discovers causal relationships between miRNAs and mRNAs,
not just the statistical relationships. Second, we assume that
miRNAs and mRNAs interact with each other in a complex
system, for instance, an miRNA can causally regulate mRNAs
as well as other miRNAs. This assumption is more reasonable
than the commonly used approach that considers only the
bipartite of interactions between miRNAs and mRNAs. For
example, (Zisoulis et al., 2012) shows that let-7 can regulate
other non-coding RNAs including miRNAs.

In this work, we ﬁrst derive the solution to discover the causal
miRNA regulatory relationships based on the IDA approach.
Then we apply the method to the epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) datasets. We implement a controlled experi-
ment for the miR-200 family to validate the results. The outcome
shows that the causal miRNA regulatory relationships dis-
covered using our method largely overlap the ﬁndings from the
experiment, suggesting that the causal relationships between
miRNAs and mRNAs can be identiﬁed from expression proﬁles.

2 METHODS

2.1 Notations

Let G = (V, E) be a graph consisting a set of vertices V and a set of edges
E g V X V. In our context, V = {X 1, .. . , X 1,} is a set of random variables
representing the expression levels of miRNAs and mRNAs, and the edges
represent relationships between these variables.

In G, X]- is a parent of X,- if there is a directed edge X]- —> X ,-. We use
pa,(G) to represent the set of all parents of X ,-. X k is called a sibling of X ,-
if there is an undirected edge X,- — Xk. We denote the set of all siblings
of X ,- in G, sib,(G). When the graph G is clear from the context, we use pa,-
and sib, instead of pa,(G) and sib,(G).

A v- structure is an ordered triple of vertices, (X,, X], X k), such that in
G, there exist directed edges X ,- —> Xj and X]- <— Xk, and X,- and Xk are
not adjacent. X]- is then known as a collider in this v-structure.

Graph G is a DAG if G contains only directed edges and has no cycles.
The skeleton of a DAG G is the undirected graph obtained from G by
substituting undirected edges for directed edges. An equivalence class
of DAGs is the set of DAGs that have the same skeleton and the same
v-structures.

An equivalence class of DAGs can be uniquely described by a com-
pleted partially directed acyclic graph (CPDAG). A partially directed
acyclic graph (PDAG) is a graph where the edges are either directed or
undirected and one cannot trace a cycle by following the directions of the
directed edges and any directions of the undirected edges. A PDAG is
completed if (i) every directed edge exists also in every DAG belonging to
the equivalence class and (ii) for every undirected edge, X ,- — Xk, there
exists a DAG with X ,- <— Xk and a DAG with X , —> Xk in the equivalence
class.

2.2 Method overview

Figure 1 illustrates the method used in our work. Details of the major
steps, causal structure learning and causal inference are presented in
Sections 2.3 and 2.4, respectively. Section 2.5 summarizes our method
as an algorithm with the steps of implementing the method with expres-
sion data.

2.3 Causal structure learning

Learning causal structures from data plays a critical role in causality
discovery. A popular method used to construct the structure from data
is probabilistic graphical models. These graphical models are used to
analyse and visualize conditional independence relationships between
random variables (Neapolitan, 2004). The structure of conditional inde-
pendence among the random variables is usually presented as a DAG of
which vertices represent random variables and edges encode conditional
dependence of the enclosing vertices.

Learning a DAG from data is highly challenging and complex, as the
number of possible DAGs is super-exponential in the number of nodes
(Robinson, 1971). Nevertheless, a number of methods have been pro-
posed to learn DAGs from data. One approach is to restrict the search
space to trees, such as the maximum weight spanning trees (Chow and

Liu, 1968). Another approach, Greedy Equivalent Search (Chickering,
2002), works for a moderate number of nodes. Adding to these methods
are the highly computation intensive Bayesian approaches for DAGs
(Heckerman and Chickering, 1995).

An interesting alternative to those greedy or structurally restricted
approaches is the Inductive Causation (IC) algorithm proposed by
Verma and Pearl (1990). This algorithm is the base of causal structure
learning research, and the algorithm is outlined in three phases as follows:

Phase l—Find the undirected structure: For each pair of X ,-
and X], search for a set SXin such that (X,J_LXJ-|SX,XJ.). Add an
undirected edge between X ,- and X]- if no set SXin can be found.

Phase 2—Determine the v-structures: For each connected
triple X,- — X]- — X 1,, direct the edges and add a v-structure
X,- —> X]- <—Xk ifXj ¢ SXiXk, i.e. if and only if X,- and Xk are
dependent given Xj.

Phase 3—Direct the remaining edges: Follow different rules/
constraints to direct the remaining edges whenever possible,
avoiding the creation of new v-structures and cycles.

The IC algorithm, however, leaves the details of Phases 1 and 3
unspeciﬁed and opens the door to further research.

Spirtes and Glymour proposed the PC algorithm (Spirtes et al., 2000),
named after its inventors Peter Spirtes and Clark Glymour, to implement
in detail the IC algorithm. The PC algorithm starts from a complete
undirected graph and deletes recursively edges based on conditional

independence decisions. This yields an undirected graph that can then
be partially directed and further extended to a CPDAG.

With high-dimensional datasets, we need to select the most efﬁcient
tool to implement the conditional independence test in the PC algorithm.
Lauritzen (1996) proved that when the distribution of variables is multi-
variate normal, the partial correlation test can be used as a conditional
independence test as stated in the following theorem.

Theorem 1: (Lauritzen, 1996) Assume that the distribution P of
the random vector X = {X 1, ...,Xp} is multivariate normal. For
igéj,i,j e {1, ...,p},k g {1, ...,p} \ {i,j}. pull, denotes the par-
tial correlation between X ,- and X], given {X,; r e k}. Then,
pijjlk = 0 if and only if X ,- and Xj are conditionally independent,
given {X,; r e k}.

Recently, Kalisch and Buhlmann (2007) showed that in the high-
dimensional context, that is, the number of nodes p may be much
larger than the sample size n, the PC algorithm with partial correlation
test is uniformly consistent. This sheds light on the discovery of causal
structures for high-dimensional data, such as gene expression datasets.
In this article, we adapt the PC algorithm as a step of our algorithm in
discovering the CPDAG, which includes miRNAs and mRNAs as nodes
(see Fig. 1 and Step 2 of Section 2.5).

2.4 Causal inference

Our problem is to infer the causal effects (intervention or knockdown
effects) of each single miRNA on the regulations of every mRNA under
consideration, using only the observational data, the expression data of
miRNAs and mRNAs.

The causal effects can be computed using do—calculus (Pearl, 2000),
given a set of conditional dependencies from the expression data and a
corresponding DAG model. The intervention do(X, = x1.) is an operation
to force X,- to receive the value x;. The purpose is to observe how the
system reacts with this intervention, or in other words, how the distribu-
tion of a variable may change after the intervention. Pearl (2000)
formalized the deﬁnition of post-intervention distribution by the
pre-intervention distribution as shown in the following deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 1: Let X 2 {X1, X2, ...,Xp+1} be a set of variables.
The distribution generated by an intervention do(X,- = xg),

i e {1, .. . , p —I— l} on the set of variables is given by the truncated
factorization formula:
, . . p . . ,. = I,
Pm, ...,poldoQg = xi» = {(1)1175 (lepaj)  7E  (1)

where paj is a set of parent nodes of  and P(xj|paj) are the pre-
intervention conditional distributions.

To deal with high-dimensional datasets, we made some assumptions in
Theorem 1 and the PC algorithm in the causal structure learning phase.
The assumptions are that the distribution of the variables X is multivari-
ate normal, Markovian and faithful to the true (unknown) causal DAG.
With the same assumptions, we can now calculate the intervention effects
based on the discussions in Maathuis et al. (2009), which are formalized
in the following theorem.

Theorem 2: Let X1, ...,Xp,Xp+1 = Ybejointly Gaussian. The
causal eﬂect of X ,- on Y for i = l, . . . , p can be calculated as:

_ _ 0 Yepa,,
eﬂXi’ Y) _ ’B’IP‘” _ {Coeﬁicient ofX, in Y~ X,- +pa,- Y¢ pa,- ()

in which pa,- is the set of parent nodes of X,, and Y~ X,- + pa,- is the
shorthand for the linear regression of Y on X ,- and pa,.

Fig. 2. A CPDAG G with the DAGs G1, ..., G4 in its equivalence class
(Maathuis et al., 2009)

At this point, we have had the tools, the PC algorithm, to learn the
CPDAG and Theorem 2 to estimate the causal effects for each DAG in
the equivalence class CPDAG. For illustration, consider the CPDAG G
in Figure 2, where we are interested in ef(X1, Y). We can ﬁrst list all the
DAGs in the equivalence class, G1, ..., G4. The causal effect ef(X1, Y)
can then be calculated in each DAG by applying Theorem 2.

However, when the number of nodes in a CPDAG is large, the number
of DAGs grows quickly. As the essence of the calculation of ef(X,, Y) is
the sets of parent nodes of X ,-, Maathuis et al. (2009) suggest searching the
CPDAG directly for all the valid parental sets of X ,- rather than identify-
ing all the DAGs in the equivalence class for the parental sets. We restate
this suggestion by the following theorem.

Theorem 3: Let S g sib,(G). A set pa,(G) U S is a parental set
of X ,- if and only if directing all edges between X ,- and vertices in
S toward X,, and all edges between X ,- and vertices in sib,-(G) \ S
away from X,- will not create any new v-structures.

In Figure 2, pa1(G) = Q, sib1(G) 2 {X2, X4}. Therefore, the candidate
parental sets of X1 are Q, {X2}, {X4} and {X2, X4}. However, the set
{X 2, X 4} is not the parental set of X1, as directing edges between
{X 2, X4} and X1 toward X1 will create a new v-structure. Therefore, apply-
ing Theorem 2 to the three parental sets, we have the multiset that contains
all the causal effects of X1 on Y, E1 = {61|g,/31|X2,61|X4}. A multiset is a
set in which elements are allowed to appear more than once.

2.5 Algorithm

Now, we are able to present the algorithm for discovering miRNA causal
regulatory relationships in four steps as follows:

Step 1: Identify differentially expressed genes, i.e. those genes whose
expression values vary signiﬁcantly across the conditions (categories)
of the samples. First, we divide the dataset as per the categories (e.g.
normal and cancer) and identify the differentially expressed genes
across different categories. We assume that those genes with little or
zero change in expression between the categories play a minimum role
in the biological processes and are thus omitted. Let X1, .. . , Xm and
Y1, ..., Yn represent miRNAs and mRNAs, respectively, that are
identiﬁed to be differentially expressed. Combining the expression
proﬁles of the differentially expressed miRNAs and mRNAs, we
have a dataset for the (m + n) variables.

Step 2: Use the PC algorithm to estimate the CPDAG G of the
(m + n) variables and the conditional dependencies of the variables
We use partial correlation as a conditional independence test for the
PC algorithm, as the partial correlations are easy to implement in a
high-dimensional dataset. The validity of this test has been shown by
Theorem 1.

Step 3: Estimate the causal effects of each miRNA on each mRNA
Naturally, we can identify all possible DAGs in the CPDAG, and
then use Theorem 2 to estimate the causal effects with each DAG.
However, when the number of nodes in the CPDAG is large, as
described previously, we apply Theorem 3 to reduce the search
space of possible DAGs. The causal effects of each miRNA on an

mRNA can be achieved by applying Theorem 2 to each of the
parental sets of the miRNA.

Step 4: Output the miRNA causal effects. For each miRNA, the
outcome of Step 3 is an array of multisets, and each multiset contains
all causal effects of the miRNA on an mRNA (note that the causal
effects of an miRNA on a particular mRNA may have multiple
values, as we estimated the effects from its different parental sets).
With each of the multisets, in this step, we select the causal effect
value with the smallest absolute value, and output it as the causal
effect of the miRNA on the mRNA.

3 RESULTS

In this section, we present the results and analysis of applying
our algorithm to the NCI-60 dataset for EMT. The dataset
includes the miRNA expression proﬁles for the NCI-60 panel
of 60 cancer cell lines from Sokilde et al. (2011). They are avail-
able at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=
GSE26375. The mRNA expression proﬁles for NCI-60 were
downloaded from ArrayExpress http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayex
press, accession number E-GEOD-5720. Cell lines categorized
as epithelial (11 samples) and mesenchymal (36 samples) are
used for this work.

3.1 Implementation

In this section, we describe how the algorithm in Section 2.5 is
applied to the NCI-60 dataset.

We divide the samples in the dataset into two groups based on
their conditions, epithelia and mesenchymal. The differentially
expressed gene analysis is performed using the limma package
of Bioconductor (Smyth, 2005), and 1635 mRNA probes and
43 miRNA probes are identiﬁed to be differentially expressed
with p-value <0.05 (adjusted p-value). Detailed results are pro-
vided in the Supplementary Material.

The PC algorithm is then used to estimate the CPDAG G. The
input for the PC algorithm is a 47 x 1678 matrix of the 47 samples
of miRNA and mRNA expression values for the 1678 probes. The
PC algorithm uses partial correlation as the conditional independ-
ence test. The signiﬁcance level of this test, a, is the tuning
parameter for the PC algorithm. In this implementation, we use
the R-package called pcalg and set a = 0.01 (p-value < 0.01).

Then the causal effect ef(miRNA, mRNA) is calculated using
Theorem 3 for each pair of miRNA and mRNA. As stated in
Step 4 of the algorithm, we use the causal effect value whose
absolute value is the smallest of all in the obtained multiset as
the result for ef(miRNA, mRNA). For example, if ef(miRNA,
mRNA): {0.4, — 0.5, 0.4, 0.3}, then we choose ef(miRNA,
mRNA): 0.3 as the result. This choice assures a consistent result
because if the reported result of ef(miRNA, mRNA) is high, all the
estimations across different DAGs (parental sets) must be high.

To overcome the problem of small number of samples in bio-
logical data, we bootstrap the data 100 times and take the
median of the 100 estimates for each pair of (miRNA, mRNA)
as the ﬁnal results.

The ﬁnal result is displayed in a tabular form (as the ﬁnal table in
Fig. 1b). The value in each cell of the table is the causal effect that
an miRNA has on an mRNA. It is worth noting that the causal
effect of each individual miRNA on each individual mRNA in the
result is not necessarily a consequence of the direct interaction

between an miRNA and an mRNA. In fact, it indicates the total
regulatory effect that the miRNA has on the mRNA, and the
regulation pattern can be direct, indirect or both.

We can rank all the genes based on the absolute values of the
causal effects that a particular miRNA has on them. In this art-
icle, we rank the genes regulated by miR-200a and miR—200b,
respectively, and extract the top 20, 50 and 100 genes in each
case based on the causal effects that the miRNA has on them
for experimental validation, which will be discussed in the next
section. The computational results that show the causal effects
of miRNAs on mRNAs can be found in the Supplementary
Material.

3.2 Validation by experiments

The most effective way to validate the results is by biological
experiments. In this article, we design the follow-up controlled
experiment on the samples of MDA-MB-231.

We measure the gene expression level in the MDA-MB-231
samples transfected with the miR-200 family and in the
MDA-MB-231 samples without the miR-200 family (controls).
Speciﬁcally, we have one sample transfected with miR—200a,
two samples transfected with miR—200b and two control samples.
The reason for choosing the miR—200 family for experimentation
is that the miR-200 family has been conﬁrmed as a biomarker for
EMT (Gregory et al., 2008). The differentially expressed genes
from the controlled and transfected samples are then used to val-
idate the computational results. With the experiment, 345 and 533
genes are identiﬁed to be regulated by miR-200a and miR—200b,
respectively, with adjusted p-value <0.05 [the p-values are ob-
tained from limma (Smyth, 2005) with Benjamini and Hochberg
correction method]. The detailed experimental results are in the
Supplementary Material, and a summary of validation results is
given later in the text in term of the number of genes conﬁrmed by
the experiments and the consistency in the signs of regulations:

(1) A significant number of genes regulated by miR-200 family
being confirmed. There is signiﬁcant overlap between the
top genes regulated by miR-200 that are discovered by our
method and the differentially expressed genes identiﬁed
from the experiment. For miR—200a and miR—200b, we
extract respectively from the computational results the
top 20, 50 and 100 genes based on the causal effects that
the miRNA has on them, for validation. The numbers of
genes that have been conﬁrmed by the experiment are
shown in Table 1. If we consider the results in Table l
as precisions for top 20, 50 and 100, the corresponding

p-value is calculated based on the probability of the result that can occur by chance.

recalls are 10/345, 22/345 and 42/345 for miR-200a and
14/533, 32/533 and 53/533 for miR-200b. When we select
the top- k genes for validation, the recall rates will be im-
proved with the increase of k. In practice, depending on
the goal of an experiment, k can be adjusted to have a
good balance between the recall rates and precisions.

(2) Consistency in the signs of regulations. In the results dis-
covered by our method, a positive/negative causal effect
that an miRNA has on an mRNA means that increasing
the miRNA expression level will result in an increasing/
decreasing expression level of the mRNA. Therefore, the
signs of the causal effects, either positive or negative,
indicate up- or downregulations in the context of
miRNA—mRNA interactions. In the experiments, to iden-
tify the up-/downregulations of miR-200a or miR—200b on
an mRNA, we compare the expression level of the mRNA
between the control samples and the samples transfected
by miR-200a or miR—200b. The greater level of the mRNA
expression level in the transfected samples implies the
upregulation (positive causal effect) and vice versa.

We compare the results of the experiments and our
method regarding the signs of the regulations of
miR-200a and miR—200b on the top 20, 50 and 100
genes, respectively. With miR-200a, for the top 20 and
50 genes, respectively, the signs discovered using our
method are 100% consistent with (the same as) those iden-
tiﬁed by the experiments, and 95% of the regulations dis-
covered by our method on the top 100 genes have the same
signs as those discovered by the experiments. With
miR—200b, for the top 20, 50 and 100 genes, the consist-
ency of the signs are 100, 94 and 94%, respectively.

The signiﬁcant numbers of genes that have been conﬁrmed by
experiments together with the high level of consistency in the
signs of causal effects suggest that our method can be used as
a new tool to assist in the experimental design for discovering
miRNA causal regulatory relationships.

3.3 Functional validation of mRNAs for EMT

As the results are obtained based on the EMT datasets, we
extract the top 150 genes based on the total causal effects that
all the miRNAs have on them, and we validate the genes against
the literature knowledge of pathways and functional biomarkers
of EMT.

We use GeneGo Metacore from GeneGo Inc. to identify the
pathways previously discovered in the literature that involve
the genes in our top 150 list. The results in Table 2 show that
the top genes that receive the highest causal effects are highly
relevant to the regulation of EMT. For instance, pathways num-
ber 6, 7, 8 and 11 are direct pathways of the development of
EMT, and others are important pathways involved in the process
of EMT. An example of pathway number 1 can be found in the
Supplementary Material.

The pathway results suggest that the top genes causally regu-
lated by miRNAs are highly relevant to the biological condition
(EMT) of the datasets. Therefore, we can also use the method
in this article for identifying functional miRNA regulatory
modules for a speciﬁc biological condition. This can be done

by ranking all the miRNAs that regulate the group of genes,
e.g. the top 150 genes, and then setting thresholds for the values
of causal effects to extract the miRNA—mRNA regulatory
modules.

We also conduct enrichment analysis for the top 150 genes to
investigate the relevance between the gene functions and the bio-
logical condition of the dataset. We use Ingenuity Pathway
Analysis (IPA, Ingenuity Systems, www.ingenuity.com), a com-
mercial application that calculates the association between a par-
ticular gene set and known functions and pathways, for this
purpose. The top 150 genes are signiﬁcantly enriched for several
biological functions. The top ﬁve functions listed by IPA are
known to be critical for EMT. They are cellular movement,
cell-to-cell signalling and interaction, cellular assembly and or-
ganization, cellular growth and proliferation and cell morph-
ology. Especially, there are several genes in the sub-categories
of cellular movement, invasion and migration, which have been
identiﬁed as the functional biomarkers of EMT (Zeisberg and
Neilson, 2009). Table 3 shows the genes in the top 150 list that
are in the classes of invasion and migration, which are functional
biomarkers for EMT.

4 CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSIONS

miRNAs have been regarded as one of the most important regu-
lators. Identifying their functions and regulatory mechanism
is critical in understanding biological processes of organisms.
Both biology and computational biology have seen great efforts
made to elucidate miRNA functions. However, the precise regu-
latory relationships between miRNAs and mRNAs remain elu-
sive. The statistical relationships that most computational
methods can discover only reveal associations or correlations
but not causality.

In this article, we present an alternative approach for reveal-
ing the causal relationships between miRNAs and mRNAs.

Genes in invasion and migration, sub-categories of cellular movement, are func-
tional markers of EMT. The results are generated from IPA. The last column is the
range of p-values for all genes in the group.

This method is inspired by the recent advances in causality
discovery research on large-scale datasets, especially the IDA
method (Maathuis et al., 2009, 2010). Based on this method,
we derived the solution for miRNA causal regulatory relation-
ship discovery. Our method makes use of the expression proﬁles
of miRNAs and mRNAs and evaluates the causal effects of
miRNAs on mRNAs. Our assumption is that miRNAs and
mRNAs interact with each other in a complex system. This is
a more realistic assumption than those that consider the inter-
actions occur between miRNAs and mRNAs only.

One promising aspect of our approach is that the causal effects
we get are similar to those from a randomized controlled experi-
ment. Results from the follow-up experiments have indicated
that our method can be used to effectively identify a set of
genes causally regulated by miRNAs. Although the discovery
based on observational data alone may never replace the
actual intervention experiments, these results can serve as a
tool for the design of follow-up miRNA experiments.

In this article, we have applied our method to the EMT data-
sets. The results show that our method has effectively identiﬁed
the causal relationships between miRNAs and mRNAs. The
follow-up experiments conﬁrm the validity of the identiﬁed
causal relationships for the miR-200 family. The results for
other miRNAs remain open for further research and experi-
ments. In addition, the enrichment analysis from the extracted
results shows the consistency of the results of our method with
the literature regarding biological functions of EMT.

We expect that our method can be applied to different datasets
to discover the miRNA causal regulatory relationships and to
the complex regulatory networks, including miRNAs, transcrip-
tion factors and mRNAs. For extension purposes, the results of
this method can be further analysed and interpreted in various
ways. For instance, we can focus on the miRNA regulatory
networks, or discover the level of regulations that a group of

Inferring microRNA-mRNA causal regulatory relationships

 

miRNAs has on a particular gene, or compare the similarity
of two miRNAs based on the causal effects they have on a
group of genes.

Our approach complements existing prediction methods that
are based on sequence complementarity. Current understanding
of the nature of miRNA—mRNA interactions is still somewhat
limited. Predictions based on sequence complementarity and/or
structural stability of the putative duplex have a very high rate of
both false positives and false negatives. A major reason for this is
the role played by RNA folding as well as accessibility because of
protein binding. The more sophisticated prediction methods such
as mirSVR (Betel et al., 2010) incorporate training of the models
on experimental data derived from genome-wide mRNA expres-
sion changes after miRNA transfection. Our approach predicts
miRNA—mRNA interactions based on gene expression data.
Some of the interactions have already been experimentally vali-
dated, with reporter assays and the like, supporting the validity
of our approach. Some interactions from our study are novel and
can be good candidates for future investigation. Some of the
interactions and regulatory modules are likely to be applied to
other biological scenarios in which the component miRNAs and
mRNAs are expressed, whereas others, such as those involving
miR-200, will be restricted to epithelial cells and the EMT pro-
cess because the miRNA and/ or mRNA targets have cell-speciﬁc
expression. However, because our approach not only indicates
bi-component miRNA—mRNA interactions but also generates
multicomponent regulatory modules, the approach has the
power of suggesting important regulatory pathways that warrant
future study. Some of these are likely to be restricted to the EMT
process, but they are worthy of investigation because EMT has a
major role in development and in cancer progression.

Using our method (which is based on the IDA method), we can
theoretically infer the causal relationships between every two
variables in the dataset. However, to make it computationally
efﬁcient for a speciﬁc biological problem, in practice, we should
restrict the number of ‘cause’ variables and/or the number of
‘effect’ variables. For instance, in our method, we only focus on
the causal relationships between miRNAs (causes) and mRNAs
(effects). Other relationships, such as miRNA—miRNA, mRNA—
mRNA or mRNA—miRNA, although in theory can be inferred,
are beyond the scope of this article, and the complexity of the
algorithm would increase signiﬁcantly.

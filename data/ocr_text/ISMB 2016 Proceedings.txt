Editorial
ISMB 2016 Proceedings

This special issue of Bioinformatics serves as the proceedings of the
24th annual conference Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology
(ISMB), which took place in Orlando, Florida, July 8—12, 2016
(http://www.iscb.org/ismb2016). ISMB 2016, the official conference
of the International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB,
http://www.iscb.org/), was accompanied by 11 Special Interest
Group meetings of 1 or 2 days each, and two satellite meetings.
Since its inception, ISMB has been the largest international confer-
ence in computational biology and bioinformatics. It is the leading
forum in the field for presenting new research results, disseminating
methods and techniques and facilitating discussions among leading
researchers, practitioners and students in the field. The 42 papers in
this volume were selected from 188 original submissions divided
into 5 Themes and 11 associated Areas, collectively led by 10
Theme Chairs and 22 Area Chairs (Tables 1 and 2). For each area,
the Area Chairs selected an expert program committee for their sub-
discipline and oversaw the reviewing process for that area in coord-
ination with the corresponding Theme Chairs. By design, the Theme

and Area Chairs included a mix of experienced individuals re-
appointed from previous years and experts newly recruited to ensure
broad technical expertise and to promote inclusivity of various elem-
ents of the research community. In total, the review process involved
the 10 Theme Chairs, the 22 Area Chairs, 331 program committee
members and an additional 129 external reviewers recruited as sub-
reviewers by program committee members. Table 2 provides a sum-
mary of the areas, Area Chairs and a summary of the reviews by
area. The conference used a slightly streamlined two-tier review sys-
tem—a continuation and refinement of a process that begun with
ISMB/ECCB 2013 in an effort to better ensure thorough and fair re-
viewing. Under the revised process, each of the 188 submissions was
first reviewed by at least three expert referees, with a subset receiv-
ing between four and six reviews, as needed. Consensus on each
paper was reached through online discussion among reviewers, Area
Chairs and Theme Chairs. Among the 188 submissions, 42 were ac-
cepted for publication conditionally on revisions properly address-
ing the comments of the reviewers. All revised versions were

ISMB 2016 Proceedings

 

inspected by the corresponding Theme Chairs and Area Chairs,
sometimes relying on additional assessments provided by the ori-
ginal reviewers. All 42 submissions were judged to have properly ad-
dressed the concerns of the reviewers and were accepted for the
conference proceedings, resulting in an overall acceptance rate of
42/188=22.3%. We believe that this two-tier system, which is
more reflective of typical multiround journal review procedures,
provided a means of ensuring that only the highest quality original
work was accepted within the tight timing constraints imposed by
the conference scheduling. We thank all authors for submitting their
work. These proceedings would simply not be possible without the
scientific ingenuity of the contributors of all the papers. We recog-
nize that the process is not perfect, and some outstanding work
might have been rejected despite our best efforts. Nonetheless, we
are hopeful that all authors received helpful feedback on their work
and that most believe their submissions were judged fairly and dili-
gently. In total, the two-tier review process involved 687 individual

reviews. We are deeply grateful to the Theme Chairs and the Area
Chairs, the members of the program committee and the external
subreviewers for their outstanding efforts in conducting a thorough
review process in just 3 months. Their contribution is at the core of
the scientific quality of the conference. We also thank Steven Leard
for his continuing support with the review process; the team at
Oxford University Press for preparing this special proceedings vol-
ume; and all the other members of the ISMB Steering Committee for
their expert advice and supervision.

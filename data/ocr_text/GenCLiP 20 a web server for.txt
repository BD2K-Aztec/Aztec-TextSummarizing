ABSTRACT

Summary: Identifying biological functions and molecular networks in
a gene list and how the genes may relate to various topics is of
considerable value to biomedical researchers. Here, we present a
web-based text-mining server, GenCLiP 2.0, which can analyze
human genes with enriched keywords and molecular interactions.
Compared with other similar tools, GenCLiP 2.0 offers two unique
features: (i) analysis of gene functions with free terms (i.e. any terms
in the literature) generated by literature mining or provided by the user
and (ii) accurate identification and integration of comprehensive mo-
lecular interactions from Medline abstracts, to construct molecular
networks and subnetworks related to the free terms.

1 INTRODUCTION

Given a set of genes, for example, from high-throughput experi-
ments, it can be helpful to know which biological functions and
molecular networks may be involved, or whether genes from a
given list or all human genes are related to certain topics, such as
various biological and pathological processes. Some pre-deflned
annotation databases, such as Gene Ontology (GO), or pathway
databases, such as KEGG, or Protein—Protein interaction (PPI)
databases, such as HPRD (Keshava Prasad et al., 2009) and
IntAct (Aranda et al., 2010), can be used as a gold-standard
description. Some annotation tools that integrate these manually
curated databases, such as DAVID (Huang da et al., 2009) and
EGAN (Paquette and Tokuyasu 2010), provide convenient and
practical application. However, owing to structured vocabularies
and manual curations, pre-deﬁned annotations are inevitably
limited in scope, quantity and ﬂexibility.

TThe authors wish it to be known that, in their opinion, the ﬁrst two
authors should be regarded as Joint First Authors.

Some text-mining tools can compensate for these deﬁcien-
cies. Martini (Soldatos et al., 2010) and CoPub 5.0 (Fleuren
et al., 2011) adopted a keyword-based approach to annotate
gene function; however, the keywords were still limited in a
pre—deﬁned thesauri. iHOP (Hoffmann and Valencia, 2005)
and STRING (Franceschini et al., 2013) generate gene net-
works based on genes co-occurrence in the literature.
However, even though gene pairs co-occur in the same sen-
tences, only 30% of pairs have an actual interaction (Cohen
et al., 2008). FACTA+ (Tsuruoka et al., 2011) ﬁnds hidden
associations between concepts and extracts genes related to a
topic, but it does not search phase or select genes from an
input list. Previously, we developed stand-alone software called
GenCLiP (Huang et al., 2008) that annotated gene functions
with free terms and generated gene co-occurrence networks
related to free terms. However, GenCLiP had three distinct
disadvantages: (i) the free terms were limited to single
words, (ii) the gene network was constructed based on genes
co-mentioned in the same abstracts, often leading to high false
positives and (iii) the analysis period generally took 2 weeks,
and most of the time was spent on literature download. Thus,
we have developed GenCLiP 2.0, a web server that inherits the
advantages of GenCLiP, and extends it by incorporating ﬁve
new features: (i) good performance in gene recognition, with
F-measure rising from 0.72 to 0.828, (ii) expansion of free
terms to phrases, (iii) molecular interaction extraction accuracy
of nearly 90%, (iV) search genes related to free terms and (V)
complete analysis in minutes.

2 METHODS

For details about methods, please see Supplementary Data S1.

2.1 Retrieving gene-related literature

The human gene thesaurus was compiled from the HUGO Nomenclature
Committee database and the Entrez Gene. We used dictionary-based and
rule-based approaches to identify gene names in Medline abstracts.
Furthermore, we recognized genes in sentences and built indexes of
words and phrases with corresponding genes, sentences and abstracts,
to support the search of genes related to any topic.

2.2 Gene annotation with keywords

As in GenCLiP (Huang et al., 2008), terms (including a single word, GO
terms and phrases followed with acronyms) that appeared frequently in
certain gene-related literatures were considered as keywords for these
genes. A fuzzy cluster algorithm (Huang da et al., 2009) was used to
group statistically overrepresented keywords to annotate input genes. A
user can add or remove keywords manually. To explore gene—gene and
term—term relationships graphically, a heat map can be created after
average linkage hierarchical clustering analysis.

2.3 Construction of gene network

For de novo extraction of molecular interaction, a rule-based approach
that considered words surrounding gene names and interaction words,
and distance between two genes or between interaction word and gene,
etc., was used to search sentences. Gene pairs from four manually curated
databases [HPRD, BioGRID (Stark et al., 2006), CORUM (Ruepp et al.,
2008) and IntAct] that were co-mentioned in sentences were additionally
considered as molecular interactions. The interactive gene network was
implemented through a customized Cytoscape Web (Lopes et al., 2010).
Meanwhile, a subnetwork can be constructed based on the free terms
speciﬁed by a user. When the free terms appear in the sentence (or an
abstract containing the sentence) of a gene pair, the connection will be
created. Simultaneously, random simulation was performed to determine
whether a gene network was speciﬁc for the input genes.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Gene name recognition

Our gene recognition procedure achieved an F -measure of 82.8%
(recall: 83.8%, precision: 81.8%) on BioCreative II (GN) test set,
which compared favorably with other tested methods (Morgan
et al., 2008). Moreover, we evaluated our procedure on the test
set of iHOP (Hoffmann and Valencia, 2005). The F -measure was
0.86, which was better than iHOP. From whole Medline ab-
stracts, we identiﬁed 19764 genes that occurred in ~3 540 000
abstracts and 13 370 000 sentences.

3.2 Recognition of keyword and molecular interaction

We identiﬁed 16448 keywords for 19 691 of 19 764 genes, where
3395 keywords were phrases with an acronym and 2053 were GO
terms. The de novo approach recognized 10 545 genes forming
76 437 pairs of molecular interactions, where 62 806 pairs were
not collected by the four PPI databases. In our manually deﬁned
and other test sets, the precision of molecular interactions was
nearly 90%. Details and comparison with other tools is available
in Supplementary Data S1. After integrating the four databases,
molecular interactions increased to 94 058 pairs, which appeared
in ~2 440 000 sentences and 960 000 abstracts.

3.3 Application

GenCLiP 2.0 has three modules for text mining: ‘Gene Cluster
With Literature Proﬁles’, ‘Literature Mining Gene Networks’
and ‘Word Related Gene Search’. As an example, we took 65
upregulated and 53 downregulated genes (Sample 2 on the main
page) of keloid to compare with hypertrophic scar to illustrate
the application of our server. Unlike hypertrophic scars, keloids
are disﬁguring scars that extend beyond the original wound
borders and resist treatment.

In our analysis, enriched keywords were mostly related with cell
growth, extracellular matrix, epithelial mesenchymal transition
(EMT), cell migration, cell adhesion, mesenchymal stem cell and
wound healing. ‘Collagen’ was manually input as a search term,
and found that 10 upregulated genes (P = 7.366e-11) were closely
associated with collagen. These keywords are mostly concordant
with well-known characteristics of keloid. Interestingly, keratno-
cyte and keratinocyte differentiation were also annotated as key-
words, and associated genes were all downregulated genes except
for one (Supplementary Fig. S2A). This reminded us that we
should pay more attention to keratnocyte. Recent study has
also shown the important role of keloid keratinocytes in keloid
scarring, and it was also reported that there were a substantial
number of upregulated genes involved in EMT in keloid keratino-
cytes (Hahn et al., 2013). In the ‘Word Related Gene Search’
module, we obtained 28 of the 118 input genes that co-occurred
with ‘epithelial mesenchymal transition’ in sentences. We con-
ﬁrmed that 12 upregulated and 5 downregulated genes were
related to EMT. In our experience, in general, at least 50% of
the genes will be related to search terms. Resulting gene networks
(Supplementary Fig. S2B) showed that upregulated MMP2
played an important role in the network. Interestingly, THBS2,
CST3 and GLBl, as activators of MMP2, were upregulated,
whereas three inhibitors, IL1RN, S100A8 and S100A9, were
downregulated. Most of these genes had not been investigated
in keloid; however, keywords and the related gene search provided
strong evidence that they were closely associated with extracellular
matrix, EMT, cell migration and cell growth. Consequently, we
proposed that abnormal expression of these genes can cause
upregulation of MMP2 and may impact keloid progress.

4 CONCLUSIONS

GenCLiP 2.0 is a web-based tool that can analyze human genes
through three functions: (i) generation of enriched and clustered
keywords, which are generated based on occurrence frequencies
of free terms in gene-related literature or provided by a user, (ii)
construction of a gene-network using accurate molecular inter-
actions and generation of subnetworks based on user-deﬁned
query terms and (iii) querying of genes cooccurring with search
terms in a sentence or abstract. Our testing showed that
GenCLiP 2.0 is a practical tool for the analysis of high-through-
put experimental results. The databases will be updated every 6
months.

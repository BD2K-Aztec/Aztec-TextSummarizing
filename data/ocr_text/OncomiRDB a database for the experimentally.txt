ABSTRACT

Summary: MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small regulatory RNAs,
play important roles in cancer initiation, progression and therapy.
MiRNAs are found to regulate diverse cancer-related processes by
targeting a large set of oncogenic and tumor-suppressive genes. To
establish a high-confidence reference resource for studying the
miRNA-regulated target genes and cellular processes in cancer, we
manually curated 2259 entries of cancer-related miRNA regulations
with direct experimental evidence from ~9000 abstracts, covering
more than 300 miRNAs and 829 target genes across 25 cancer tis-
sues. A web-based portal named oncomiRDB, which provides both
graphical and text-based interfaces, was developed for easily brows-
ing and searching all the annotations. It should be a useful resource
for both the computational analysis and experimental study on miRNA
regulatory networks and functions in cancer.

1 INTRODUCTION

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of ~22-nt endogenous small
regulatory RNAs, which can repress the expressions and/or
translations of hundreds of target genes by binding to the
3’-UTRs of target gene mRNA transcripts (Bartel, 2004,
2009).Till now, there are more than 2500 human miRNAs col-
lected in the latest miRBase database release (Grifﬁths-J ones,
2004; Kozomara and Grifﬁths-Jones, 2011). More than half of
the protein-coding genes are potentially regulated by one or mul-
tiple miRNAs according to the genome-wide computational pre-
dictions and high-throughput experimental screens (Chi et al.,
2009; Krek et al., 2005; Lewis et al., 2005). Extensive evidence
shows that miRNAs play important roles in nearly all essential
cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, migration, differen-
tiation, apoptosis and senescence.

Cancer, which is one of the leading causes of death worldwide,
involves signiﬁcant changes of chromatin structures and molecu-
lar regulatory networks. As their impacts on mRNA stability
and translation efﬁciency are extensive, miRNAs are found to

regulate different hallmarks of cancer by targeting a large set of
oncogenic and tumor-suppressive genes. These miRNAs are usu-
ally called onco-miRNAs (oncomiRs) (Esquela-Kerscher and
Slack, 2006; Lujambio and Lowe, 2012).

To facilitate the study on miRNA functions and regulatory
networks in cancer, there is a great need to establish a reference
database for annotating the oncomiRs regulating different cellu-
lar processes and target genes in different types of cancers. There
are a few existing databases aiming at annotating the cancer-
related miRNAs, such as miRCancer Oﬁe et al., 2013),
PhenomiR (Ruepp et al., 2010), miR2Disease (Jiang et al.,
2009), HMDD (Lu et al., 2008) and somamiR (Bhattacharya
et al., 2013), but they mainly collect the differentially expressed
miRNAs or the miRNA-associated genetic mutations in cancer
without direct functional evidence (miR2Disease and HMDD
include some experimentally veriﬁed entries, but the number of
entries is relatively small).

According to the PubMed records as of March 2013, there are
~9000 publications studying the cancer-related miRNAs. This
literature provides extensive information for the oncomiR func-
tions and target genes. We manually reviewed the abstracts and
curated 2259 entries of experimentally veriﬁed oncomiRs, which
either regulate one or more cancer-related cellular processes or
directly target at least one gene in cancer-related processes. The
miRNA expression patterns, their upstream regulators and the
corresponding experimental conditions are also collected from
the abstracts. Then, we developed a Web-based portal
oncomiRDB for storing and displaying all the curated data
entries. With the graphical and text-based interfaces, users can
easily browse and search all the entries for the oncomiRs related
to different cancer types, different regulated cellular processes or
different target genes. OncomiRDB should be a valuable re-
source for both the computational analysis and the experimental
study of miRNA functions and regulatory networks in cancer.

2 DATABASE CONTENT AND STATISTICS

To annotate the experimentally veriﬁed oncomiRs, ﬁrstly we
retrieved the abstracts studying the miRNA regulations in
cancer from PubMed (about 9000 abstracts for the current data-
base release; the query details are provided in the Supplementary
Material). We carefully reviewed all the abstracts and curated the
detailed information of the oncomiRs with direct experimental
evidence: the miRNAs regulate at least one cancer-related cellu-
lar process conﬁrmed by perturbing their activities, such as over-
expression using miRNA mimics or repression using antagomirs

in cancer cell lines, and/or the miRNAs directly target at least
one gene in cancer-related processes validated by luciferase re-
porter assay (when the validation method was not described
clearly, we further checked it within the full text). In the database
content, besides the information of miRNA-regulated cellular
processes and target genes, the miRNA expression patterns,
the miRNA upstream regulators, the cancer types and the cor-
responding experimental conditions were also collected if they
provided in the abstracts. Because of the complexity of cancer
types, the detailed cancer types were grouped into 25 different
cancer tissues: for example, ‘non-small cell lung cancer’, ‘small
cell lung cancer’ and ‘lung adenocarcinoma’ were grouped into
‘lung’ tissue. The latest database release contains 2259 entries
covering more than 300 miRNAs and 829 target genes in 25
cancer tissues. To maintain the data quality, each entry was
double-checked by at least two different curators.

For the latest release of oncomiRDB, breast, liver, colorectum,
lung and stomach are the most annotated cancer tissues; miR-21,
let-7a, miR—34a and miR-145 are the most common oncomiRs
annotated across more than 15 cancer tissues. A few others are
only studied in speciﬁc cancer tissues, such as miR-122 in liver
cancer (speciﬁcally expressed in liver tissues) (Chang et al., 2004;
Jopling et al., 2005). The cancer tissues and their related
miRNAs form a complex network. A set of oncogenes such as
CCNDl, IGF 1R, CDK6, MET and BCL2 is strongly regulated
by multiple tumor-suppressive miRNAs. These oncogenes are
frequently overexpressed in cancer tissues, consistent with the
global reduction of miRNA expressions (Lu et al., 2005).
Several chromatin modiﬁers, such as EZH2 and BMIl, are
also extensively regulated by several miRNAs, which suggests
that miRNAs play important roles in regulating the chromatin
structure changes during the cancer initiation and progression.

3 USER INTERFACES

To facilitate the database browsing and searching, we built a
Web-based portal providing both graphical and text-based inter-
faces. The graphical interface for the ‘cancer tissue—miRNA’ net-
work is provided on the database main page, while the ‘miRNA—
target’ network can be generated according to any search result.
All the graphical interfaces are developed based on the
Cytoscape Web utility (Lopes et al., 2010).

For the text-based interface, users can specify one or multiple
query conditions in the left navigation column: (i) ‘MicroRNA’:
the users can input the exact miRNA name (such as miR-21) or
add ‘%’ for a fuzzy search (such as miR-200% for miR—200a,
miR-200b and miR-2000); (ii) ‘MiRNA_ID’: the users can select
any interested miRNA with an ofﬁcial symbol; (iii) ‘Tissue’: spe-
cify one of the 25 cancer tissues; (iV) ‘Tumor’: specify any inter-
ested cancer subtype; (V) ‘Target’: specify any interest target
gene; (Vi) ‘Function’: specify one of the six most annotated
cancer-related cellular functions. After submitting the query, all
the matched entries will be listed. Then, the users can either
generate the miRNA—target network or download the detailed
annotations for listed entries. A more detailed user guide can be
found in the Supplementary Material.

4 DISCUSSION

OncomiRDB is a unique resource for annotating the experimen-
tally veriﬁed cancer-related miRNAs with direct functional evi-
dence. By comparing with several existing miRNA target
databases, oncomiRDB can provide many new miRNA—target
annotations validated by luciferase assay, although it focuses on
collecting cancer-related miRNA targets (the comparison result
is presented in Supplementary Table S1, and the detailed list can
be downloaded from the database Web site). Except for the
direct targets, oncomiRB also collects the corresponding
miRNA cellular functions and experimental conditions from
the literature. The graphical interface, a unique feature of
oncomiRDB, can achieve better database browsing and search
result Visualization. In summary, oncomiRDB is a high-conﬁ-
dence reference resource for studying the miRNA-regulated
target genes and cellular processes in cancer.

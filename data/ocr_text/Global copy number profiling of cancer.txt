Abstract

Summary: In this article, we introduce a robust and efficient strategy for deriving global and allele—
specific copy number alternations (CNA) from cancer whole exome sequencing data based on Log R
ratios and B—allele frequencies. Applying the approach to the analysis of over 200 skin cancer samples,
we demonstrate its utility for discovering distinct CNA events and for deriving ancillary information

 

such as tumor purity.

1 Introduction

DNA copy number alternations (CNA) have been extensively
studied in cancer. Copy number amplifications and homozygous de—
letions from CNA play an important role in the development of can—
cer. Genome—wide CNA detection of large number of tumor samples
is a vital step to identify cancer driver events and to gain insights
into cancer progression and prevention. Next—generation sequencing
(NGS) technologies have quickly become the CNA analysis platform
of choice due to higher resolution and sensitivity compared to trad—
itional array—based approaches such as comparative genomic hybrid—
ization (CGH). However, NGS—specific CNA statistical and
computational methods are currently not well established and are
mostly based on the total copy number gains or losses as represented
by the log ratio of sequence coverage in a tumor—normal pair. These
relative measurements do not take into account tumor purity,
clonality, as well as other valuable information accrued by NGS

data. In this correspondence, we highlight a set of concepts and
analytic tools that enables the fast and accurate dissection of whole—
genome CNA profiles by integrating the totality of information
available from NGS data. Based on whole exome sequencing (WES)
data of 253 melanoma tumor—normal pairs, we demonstrate
that our approaches allow for a more accurate estimation of copy
number status and identification of otherwise undetectable CNA
patterns.

Well—developed array—based CNA analytical tools are primarily
based on the segmentation and smoothing of Log R Ratio (LRR) and
B-allele frequency (BAF) (Wang et 61]., 2007), which provide orthog—
onal evidence for copy number status. LRR corresponds to the differ—
ence in the hybridization signal in a particular genome region between
normal and tumor DNA, and BAF measures the relative contributions
of the maternal and paternal alleles to this signal. Most NGS—based

tools, however, rely solely on LRR due to the inherent challenges in as-
sessing BAF. First, the density of observed single nucleotide variants
(SNVs) is relatively sparse, especially in WES. Also, the accuracy of the
BAF measurement is dependent on the sequence coverage, which can
vary between gene regions and sequencing modalities. Finally, the BAF
is sensitive to sequencing and mapping errors. Therefore, BAF informa-
tion remains underutilized in NGS experiments, and BAF is often used
in an ad hoc manner—in an attempt to validate the results obtained
from LRR. In this paper, we propose a fast procedure that is based on
both LRR and BAF and that works seamlessly with existing NGS pipe—
lines. We show that the derived multivariate CNA profiles allow for an
in—depth characterization of the somatic structural variations in cancer
samples. A set of analysis scripts from vcf file preparation to the deriv—
ation of allele—specific copy numbers are provided in the pipeline pack—
age CLOSE (a toolkit for CNA/EH analysis with Equencing data)
and its companion R package CLOSE—R.

2 Methods and results

A conceptual overview of our strategy is illustrated in Figure 1. NGS
sequencing data is first segmented into LRR regions using existing
programs, and we only use the BAF of identified variant positions
that are heterozygous in the paired normal tissues in the subsequent
joint modelling steps. The average or median LRR and BAF values
are calculated for each segment. For convenience and as a mean to
reduce data sparsity, the segmental BAF values are further converted
into the LAF (lesser allele frequency) measures according the for—
mula as described in the Supplementary Methods. We can then
apply a joint likelihood model at the segmental level for integrating
information from both LRR and LAF data for deriving allele-
specific copy number (ASCN) estimates. ASCN is a 2 dimensional
representation of copy number data that encodes the status of the A
and B alleles (i.e. the maternal and paternal alleles) (LaFramboise
et 61]., 2005; Van Loo et 61]., 2010). To ensure reliable estimation, it
is important to exclude outlier and less informative (normal)

regions. We assign more weight to regions with LAF smaller than
0.25, because they are much less prone to sequencing related bias
and represent important anchor points for recognition of copy num-
ber alterations. We derive sample purity and ploidy based on the
traditional full likelihood model and through a position—based ap—
proach that explores distances from canonical coordinates (Li and
Li, 2014).

Importantly, we derived a generalized LRR-LAF mapping func-
tion (Equation 8 in the Supplementary Methods) that can be used
when the sample ploidy parameter is not given or cannot be esti—
mated with enough certainty. In this case, the ASCN estimates be—
come relative measures, instead of absolute ones. Relative ASCN
estimates are still sufficient in determining copy number status
(Chen et 61]., 2014). This function was used recursively in CLOSE
for calculating canonical coordinates or lines under different set—
tings. It provides a unified systematic method for determining copy
number status, as well as a basis for further exploring clonal mix-
tures with a tumor.

Both LRR and LAF measurements exhibit strong variability (Bao
et 61]., 2014; Carter et 61]., 2012) with baseline values that are often
shifted from null (0.5 for LAF) depending on sample purity. As a re—
bust alternative to the model— or likelihood— based method for copy
number detection, we propose to call absolute or relative ASCN based
on nonparametric Bayesian clustering with the Chinese Restaurant
Process (CRP). The cluster that is closest to the baseline coordinates
corresponds to normal regions, and other copy number alternation re—
gions can be inferred accordingly. The derived CNA profile (Fig. 1b)
greatly facilitates genome—wide data exploration by grouping samples
into different CNA—sets. Importantly, the use of ASCN allows the de—
tection of copy number neutral LOH (loss of heterozygosity) regions.
These regions do no change their total DNA copy numbers and have
been a blind spot for LRR—based tools. Therefore, CLOSE—R currently
implements three methods for copy number inference: (i) the proposed
CRP or clustering based method; (ii) the likelihood— or model—based
method; and, for comparison, (iii) the joint segmentation model of
LRR and LAF modified based on the R package falcon (Chen et 61].,
2014). Based on a group of randomly selected samples, we compared
the total and allele specific copy number estimates obtained from these
three methods (Supplementary Fig. 82) and found consistent results
across different samples. We also compared the global parameter esti—
mation implemented in CLOSE (based on the modified likelihood ap—
proach) with a similar package Sequenza (Favero et 61]., 2015); they
returned very close estimates for purity even at different ploidy levels
(Supplementary Table S1 and Supplementary Fig. S3).

A competitive advantage of the CRP approach is the straightfor-
ward ability to explore tumor cellularity and subclonal cancer architec—
ture using the allele specific copy numbers. As illustrated in Figure 1d,
the minor allele copy number (minCN) approximately follows a mix-
ture of one, two or three Gaussian distributions. The spacing between
the central point of the first cluster of minCN and that of the third, if
existent, corresponds to the concentration ratio of the tumor sample.
The peak in the middle, if existent, is useful for estimating aneuploidy
or subclonality. The deviation of the main mode (of the density plot in
Fig. 1d) of the minor allele copy number from one captures the system—
atic bias caused by sequencing and mapping errors. The Dirichlet
Process fit can be successfully applied to identify these peaks given a
purity measure is as low as 0.5. The abstracted features from the CNA
profile aid in conducting the integrative analysis of multiple cancer
samples. We performed three sets of hierarchical clustering of all
of 25 3 available melanoma samples, based on minCN, and both
minor and major allele copy numbers, respectively (Fig. 1e, and
Supplementary Fig. S4). The two—channel clustering shows major copy

number events across the genome, including losses in chromosomes 9
and 10, and gains of 1q, 7p, 7q and 8q (left panel, Supplementary Fig.
S4). A clustering plot based on majCN reveals a set of melanomas,
including YUMOKI, YURDE and YUWALI, with a distinct chromo—
some 7 gain (right panel, top, in Supplementary Fig. S4), and a tight
grouping of melanoma samples from the same patients. The combined
clustering does not reveal the chromosome 7 finding and fails to group
samples from the same patient (see YUCLAT and YUZEST). Because a
few samples in our dataset were also submitted to TCGA, we were
able to compare our results to the publicly available copy—number seg—
mentation results based on array data (Affymetrix SNP6), showing
considerable consistency between the results (Supplementary Fig. 85).

Taken together, this study describes a timely and lightweight so—
lution for cancer CNA detection that is scalable to large—scale
sequencing studies. A similar approach can be applied for accurate
CNA detection in high—depth single—cell sequencing, and the solution
is extensible to whole genome sequencing. A remaining challenge is
the joint identification of unknown parameters such as ploidy and
cellularity—in which parameters may not be identifiable without
imposing additional assumptions. Nevertheless, we hope that our
solution offers a path forward for deconvolving the complexities of
the cancer genome, and stimulates further interest in allele—specific
CNA profiling based on LRR and BAF.

3 Conclusions

We propose a lightweight approach for assessing WES—based global
DNA copy number abberations that (i) replicates copy number calls
from exisiting analysis methodologies; (ii) derives tumor ploidy and
cellularity; and (iii) provides information for cross—tumor integrative
analysis.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Understanding the details of protein—RNA interactions is
important to reveal the functions of both the RNAs and the proteins.
In these interactions, the secondary structures of the RNAs play an
important role. Because RNA secondary structures in protein—RNA
complexes are variable, considering the ensemble of RNA secondary
structures is a useful approach. In particular, recent studies have sup-
ported the idea that, in the analysis of RNA secondary structures, the
base-pairing probabilities (BPPs) of RNAs (i.e. the probabilities of
forming a base pair in the ensemble of RNA secondary structures)
provide richer and more robust information about the structures than
a single RNA secondary structure, for example, the minimum free
energy structure or a snapshot of structures in the Protein Data
Bank. However, there has been no investigation of the BPPs in
protein—RNA interactions.

Results: In this study, we analyzed BPPs of RNA molecules involved
in known protein—RNA complexes in the Protein Data Bank. Our ana-
lysis suggests that, in the tertiary structures, the BPPs (which are
computed using only sequence information) for unpaired nucleotides
with intermolecular hydrogen bonds (hbonds) to amino acids were
significantly lower than those for unpaired nucleotides without
hbonds. On the other hand, no difference was found between the
BPPs for paired nucleotides with and without intermolecular hbonds.
Those findings were commonly supported by three probabilistic
models, which provide the ensemble of RNA secondary structures,
including the McCaskill model based on Turner’s free energy of
secondary structures.

1 INTRODUCTION

Protein—RNA interactions play important roles in various aspects
of biological processes, such as splicing, translation and RNA
silencing. Recently, several experimental techniques have been
developed to investigate protein—RNA interactions (Licatalosi
et al., 2008; Ray et al., 2009). In addition, the increasing number
of determined 3D structures of protein—RNA complexes
deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (Berman et al., 2000)

has promoted many computational studies to understand the
detailed mechanisms underlying the protein—RNA interactions
(Allers and Shamoo, 2001; Bahadur et al., 2008; Ellis et al.,
2007; Gupta and Gribskov, 2011; Iwakiri et al., 2012; Kim
et al., 2006; Kondo and Westhof, 2011; Sonavane and
Chakrabarti, 2009). Most of these studies consistently showed
the importance of electrostatic interactions between the positively
charged amino acids of the proteins and the negatively charged
phosphate groups of the RNA. However, only a few studies have
considered the role of RNA secondary structures in the protein—
RNA interactions (Gupta and Gribskov, 2011; Iwakiri et al.,
2012), although many RNA binding proteins are known to rec-
ognize the speciﬁc secondary structures of their partner RNA
(Ray et al., 2009). In addition, the secondary structures are phylo-
genetically conserved and are closely related to the functions of
RNAs (Burge et al., 2012).

One difﬁculty for analyzing RNA secondary structures in
protein—RNA complexes in the PDB is that only snapshots of
the secondary structures are available but they are variable in
reality (Gopal et al., 2012). Moreover, the probability of forming
a speciﬁc RNA secondary structure, such as the minimum free
energy structure, often becomes extremely small (typically
<10‘10) (Hamada, 2013). These facts are known as the
ambiguity or uncertainty of RNA secondary structures. To tackle
this uncertainty, a probability distribution of secondary struc-
tures has been considered in many analyses of RNAs (Adachi
et al., 2011; Halvorsen et al., 2010). Speciﬁcally, base-pairing
probabilities (BPPs) that provide probabilities for each base
pair with respect to an ensemble of RNA secondary structures
are often used for RNA secondary structure analysis (see Section
2.4 for the detailed deﬁnition of BPPs). For example, the BPPs
played essential roles in the analysis of an RNA aptamer (Adachi
et al., 2011), in which an unstable stem in the RNA aptamer was
conﬁrmed by both computational analysis of BPPs and biochem-
ical experiments. This indicates the importance of considering the
ensemble in the analysis of RNAs. However, there is no study
that considers the ensemble of RNAs in the analysis of protein—
RNA interactions.

In this study, we systematically investigate BPPs of RNA mol-
ecules involved in known protein—RNA complexes (taken from
the PDB; see Section 2.1 for the detailed dataset). More specif-
ically, BPPs of both paired and unpaired nucleotides (Section
2.2) with and without intermolecular hydrogen bonds (hbonds)
to amino acids (see Section 2.3 for the detailed deﬁnition) are

Analysis of base-pairing probabilities

 

systematically analyzed (see Section 3). In the analysis, we
tried three probabilistic models of RNA secondary structure
(Section 2.4), including the McCaskill model based on Turner’s
energy model (Mathews et al., 1999), when computing BPPs, and
conﬁrmed that our results are consistently supported.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 Datasets

For a dataset of protein—RNA complexes, we used 91 complexes created
in a previous study (Iwakiri et al., 2012). In this dataset, modiﬁed
nucleotides are deleted and the complexes containing multiple RNA
chains are excluded because the calculation of the BPP is limited to
standard nucleotides and single-stranded RNAs. The resulting dataset
has 68 complexes comprising 2688 nucleotides.

The above dataset includes 27 tRNAs whose secondary structures are
structurally similar despite the low similarity between their primary
sequences. To avoid this population bias, we created another dataset in
which a representative tRNA—related complex (PDBID: 1ASY) was ran-
domly selected for our analysis. The resulting dataset has 42 complexes,
comprising 1098 nucleotides.

2.2 Identiﬁcation of base pairs involved in RNA
3D structures

To be consistent with the deﬁnition of a base pair that is used in the
calculation of the BPP, canonical Watson—Crick pairs (A—U and G—C)
and wobble pairs (G—U) are treated as base pairs. These base pairs are
extracted from each RNA tertiary structure using the RNAview program
(Yang et al., 2003). Nucleotides forming a base pair were categorized as
paired nucleotides, and the remaining nucleotides were categorized as
unpaired nucleotides. Note that our deﬁnitions of paired and unpaired
nucleotides are based on tertiary structures in the PDB.

2.3 Identiﬁcation of intermolecular hbonds in the
protein—RNA interface

In the protein—RNA complexes, amino acids and nucleotides are
identiﬁed as the interface residues if their closest atom—atom distances
are <5.0  Intermolecular hbonds between proteins and RNAs were
identiﬁed using HBPLUS programs with default settings (the donor—
acceptor distance is <3.9 A, the hydrogen—acceptor distance is <2.5 A,
angles of donor—hydrogen—acceptor (D—H—A) and donor—acceptor—
acceptor antecedents (D—A—AA) are >90°) (McDonald and Thornton,
1994). It should be noted that sugar and Hoogsteen edges and phosphate
groups are available to form an intermolecular hbond with amino acids
even if the nucleotides form base pairs using Watson—Crick edges
(i.e. they are paired nucleotides) (Leontis and Westhof, 2001).

2.4 BPPs for RNA sequences

Given an RNA sequence x, a BPP pi]- (i < j) is equal to the probability
that the ith and jth nucleotides of x, x,- and xj, form a base pair (in an
assumed ensemble of RNA secondary structures). This probability is
formally deﬁned by the marginal probability.

pt: 2 1(0i-=1)p(eix) (1)

668(x)

where p(0|x) is a probability distribution on the set 8(x) of possible sec-
ondary structures of the RNA sequence x, and the indicator I(0,-j = 1)
becomes 1 only when the secondary structure 0 includes the base pair
(Xi, Xj).

In Equation (1), the probability distribution p(0|x) is often given by the
Boltzmann distribution [when it is called the McCaskill model

(McCaskill, 1990)], which is based on experimentally determined
parameters:

 

p(0lx) = ﬁexptégim)

where E(0, x) is the free energy of the RNA secondary structure
0 computed by using Turner’s energy parameters (Mathews et al.,
1999), Z(x) is the normalizing constant (partition function), R is
the ideal gas constant [8.314 J /(K mol)] and T is temperature
(T = 37°C 2 310K was used in this study).

We also tried two machine-learning—based models as the distribution
p(0|x): the Boltzmann likelihood (BL) model (Andronescu et al., 2010)
and the CONTRAfold model 030 et al., 2006). In these models, internal
parameters are automatically learned from known RNA secondary struc-
tures; in other words, those models do not use experimentally determined
parameters. It should be emphasized that recent studies have suggested
that machine learning-based models achieve better performance than the
energy-based model with respect to the prediction of base pairs in RNA
secondary structures (Andronescu et al., 2010; Do et al., 2006; Hamada
et al., 2009).

The complete set of BPPs {py}15,-<j<|x|, called a BPP matrix (BPPM),
can be efﬁciently computed by the inside—outside algorithm. See, for
example, McCaskill (1990) for the details. We used the CentroidFold
software (Hamada et al., 2009) to compute the BPPM for each probabil-
istic model. (See Supplementary Section S1 for the detailed command line
options.)

Finally, a BPP (denoted by q,) for a speciﬁc single position i in the
RNA sequence x is deﬁned by

611' = Zsz‘ + ZPij (2)
j:j<i j:i< j
which gives the probability that the nucleotide at position i in x is part of

a base pair. In our study, we use the BPPs of Equation (2) for each
nucleotide in an RNA sequence.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In this study, each nucleotide was categorized into four types
based on the combination of intermolecular hbonds and base
pairs in the 3D structures: (i) paired nucleotides with intermo-
lecular hbonds; (ii) paired nucleotides without intermolecular
hbonds; (iii) unpaired nucleotides with intermolecular hbonds;
and (iv) unpaired nucleotides without intermolecular hbonds. In
Supplementary Table S1, we summarize the detailed numbers of
nucleotides in each category in the dataset.

The average BPPs for the unpaired nucleotides with forming
intermolecular hbonds were signiﬁcantly lower than those for the
nucleotides without hbonds (Fig. 1a). On the other hand, no
difference was found between the BPPs of paired nucleotides
with and without intermolecular hbonds (Fig. 1b). In the detailed
distributions of the BPPs for the four types of nucleotides
(Fig. 2), only the unpaired nucleotides with low BPPs (<0.1)
were frequently found when the nucleotides were involved in
intermolecular hbonds (Fig. 2a). In contrast, unpaired nucleo-
tides with relatively high BPPs (20.1) were rarely found when the
nucleotides were involved in the hbonds (Fig. 2a), whereas such
nucleotides were more frequently found when the nucleotides
were not involved in the hbonds (Fig. 2b). In addition, similar
distributions were observed under the other two probabilistic
models (BL and CONTRAfold) for calculating the BPPs
(Supplementary Figs S1 and S3). These differences in the

distributions of the BPPs could cause a signiﬁcant difference in
the average probabilities (Fig. 1a).

Among the unpaired nucleotides with lower BPPs, 43% nu-
cleotides formed intermolecular hbonds with proteins in contrast
to <20% nucleotides in the unpaired nucleotides with relatively

high BPPs (Fig. 3). Similar differences were obtained when the
other two models were used to calculate the BPPs
(Supplementary Figs S2 and S4). These results imply that un-
paired nucleotides with lower BPPs in the ensemble of possible
secondary structures of the RNA more frequently form

intermolecular hbonds with proteins than unpaired nucleotide
with higher BPPs. The importance of the unpaired nucleotides
for interacting with proteins is consistently shown in recent
studies (Gupta and Gribskov, 2011; Iwakiri et al., 2012). In add-
ition, our results suggest that investigating the ensemble of the
secondary structures of the RNA is also important in the pro-
tein—RNA interactions, especially for the unpaired nucleotides.

A previous study suggested that, when using the McCaskill
model, BPPs [Equation (1)] of two nucleotides that do not
form a base pair in the reference structure are often high, falling
in the range 0.9—1 [see Supplementary Fig. S13 in Hamada et al.
(2009)]. Interestingly, a similar tendency was not observed for
unpaired nucleotides with intermolecular hbonds, whereas it
was observed for unpaired nucleotides without hbonds (see
Fig. 2a and b), which also supports the idea that unpaired
nucleotides with hbonds have a strong tendency to become
unpaired in the ensemble of RNA secondary structures.

Our dataset used above included 27 complexes containing vari-
ous tRNAs. The secondary structures of these tRNAs are known
to be a similar Cloverleaf structure, even though their primary
sequences are not similar. To avoid the bias of the tRNA, a subset
containing 42 complexes including a representative tRNA
(PDBID: 1ASY) was also created (Supplementary Table S2).
This subset was then used to calculate the BPPs based on the
three different models (Supplementary Figs S5—S11). These results
also showed that the BPPs of the unpaired nucleotides were low
when the nucleotides were involved in intermolecular hbonds.

Finally, we investigated a discriminative power of the BPP for
predicting the RNA residues either forming intermolecular
hbond or not forming the bonds (Supplementary Fig. S12). As
anticipated from the previous results, moderate discriminative
power was observed for the case of unpaired nucleotides
(Supplementary Fig. S13), whereas no discriminative power
was seen for the case of paired nucleotides (Supplementary
Fig. S14). Note that there was no signiﬁcant difference of the

powers among probabilistic models for RNA secondary
structures.

In future work, we plan to incorporate these results into
protein—RNA computational docking (Huang and Zou, 2013)
or predicting the potential interface of protein—RNA complexes
(Lewis et al., 2011) because our study provides novel and useful
information about the nucleotides (of RNAs) that form intermo-
lecular hbonds with the proteins.

4 CONCLUSION

In this study, we analyzed BPPs of RNAs involved in known
protein—RNA interactions (complexes). Our ﬁndings are sum-
marized as follows: (i) Within unpaired nucleotides average/
distribution of BPPs with intermolecular nucleotides, hbond is
different from those without hbond (Figs 1 and 2a and 2b). This
difference is useful for discrimination between the unpaired
nucleotides with hbonds and those without hbonds
(Supplementary Fig. S13). (ii) Within paired nucleotides, aver-
age/distribution of BPPs with hbond is not different from those
without hbond (Figs 1 and 2c and 2d). Hence, BPPs are not
useful to discriminate the paired nucleotides with hbonds from
those without hbonds (Supplementary Fig. S14). To our know-
ledge, this is the ﬁrst study that considers the ensemble of RNA
secondary structures in the analysis of protein—RNA inter-
actions. The ﬁndings in this study would be useful when develop-
ing an algorithm for protein—RNA computational docking and
predicting the potential interface of protein—RNA complexes.

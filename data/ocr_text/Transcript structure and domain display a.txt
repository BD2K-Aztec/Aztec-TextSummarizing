Abstract

Summary: Transcript Structure and Domain Display (TSDD) is a publicly available, web—based pro—
gram that provides publication quality images of transcript structures and domains. TSDD is cap—
able of producing transcript structures from GFF/GFF3 and BED files. Alternatively, the GFF files of
several model organisms have been pre—loaded so that users only needs to enter the locus IDs of
the transcripts to be displayed. Visualization of transcripts provides many benefits to researchers,
ranging from evolutionary analysis of DNA—binding domains to predictive function modeling.
Availability and implementation: TSDD is freely available for non—commercial users at http://shen
lab.sols.unlv.edu/shenlab/software/TSD/transcript_display.html.

1 Introduction

Due to high demand for publication quality transcript visualization
software, there have been several software solutions available for re—
searchers. Each of these solutions has advantages and drawbacks.
For instance, GECA (Fawal et 61]., 2012), which can be used online
or downloaded to a server for ofﬂine usage, has a relatively quick
runtime, and has an appealing user interface. However, it is difficult
to use and lacks customizable features and custom motifs. GECA
also requires the DNA sequence, protein sequence and a GFF3 file
which could pose a problem for those who may not have this infor-
mation available. FeatureStack’s (Frech et 61]., 2012) advantages in—
clude relatively high—quality images and the capacity to display
custom domains. However, FeatureStack lacks an online version,
requiring users to download and install a program onto their server.
FancyGene (Rambaldi and Ciccarelli, 2009) is highly customizable,
allowing selection of feature colors, feature sizes and custom motifs.
However, it can only display a single gene at a time. GSDraw (Wang
et 61]., 2013) produces customizable, high—quality images with the

capability of custom motifs. In addition, GSDraw provides users
with a phylogenetic tree. However, GSDraw has a long run time, re—
quires both the genomic and CD5 sequences, and cannot utilize a
GFF3 file. GSDS 2.0 (Hu et 61]., 2015), is a fast, easy to use, web—
based program that requires only a GFF3 file and produces custom—
izable results that include custom motifs and a phylogenetic tree.
However, GSDS has some limitations. GSDS can only process a
maximum of 50 genes at a time, which may pose a problem when
studying large gene families. For example, the WRKY gene family
contains well over 100 genes in many species (Eulgem et 61]., 2000;
Zhang and Wang, 2005). Other limitations of GSDS include the in—
ability to select a font or font size. GSDS also lacks the capability to
vertically space genes so when the size of gene features is enlarged,
the genes overlap. Herein, we report an alternative and enhanced
transcript display software that is fast, easy to use, web—based and
resolves issues with other transcript visualization software. TSDD is
capable of providing researchers with publication quality images
that can be customized and downloaded.

2 Usage and implementation

Transcript Structure and Domain Display (TSDD) can be accessed
from our website at: http://shenlab.sols.unlv.edu/shenlab/software/
TSD/transcript_display.html. TSDD relies on GFF/GFF3 files to
draw the transcript structures and domains. GFF/GFF3 files were
used as a data source to produce the transcript structures since al—
most all annotated genomes use this file format. The GFF files and
protein sequences of 13 model organisms were preloaded into the
TSDD database. To generate transcript structures of one of these or—
ganisms, users only need to select the organism from the pull—down
menu and then enter the locus IDs of the genes they wish to display
into the text box. Alternatively, users can load a ‘.txt’ file of the
locus IDs from their PC. For other organisms, users can select cus—
tom GFF3 or BED file from the pull-down menu and then can either
paste the gene structure data into the textbox or load a file from
their PC with the extension ‘.gff’ or ‘.bed’, respectively. Users can
click the ‘Demo Data’ button to load example data of the selected
organism or data file so the format of the data can be viewed.

TSDD will then parse the data and generate the transcript struc—
tures (Fig. 1A). TSDD can display at least 300 transcripts in a single
run depending on the memory of users’ PC.

TSDD is highly customizable to meet the needs of users. They
can select from a variety of fonts and font sizes, and can also display
an arrow indicating the orientation of the transcript (Fig. 1B). The
vertical spacing between transcripts can also be adjusted, as well as
the color and height of the genomic features: UTR, CDS or Introns.
Users can also select the color and height of up to 20 custom do—
mains. If the user selects one of the pre—loaded organisms, they can
specify the pattern of the domains they wish to display. In addition,
they may choose to display either all of the domains that fit the pat—
tern, only the first or last, or ones within a specified distance from
the N— or C—terminus. Since some transcripts have long introns mak-
ing the transcript difficult to view, TSDD also has the option to
compress the introns by a specified percentage or even omit the in—
trons or UTRs for easier viewing (Fig. 1C). TSDD also has a preview
feature on the main input screen which allows users to preview any

changes to the default settings prior to generating the transcript
structures. This feature will save users time if a large number of tran-
scripts are being generated. TSDD also gives users the option to save
their current configuration to a text file. This will allow users to
quickly reload their data so that results can easily be replicated at a
future time. The generated transcript structures can be saved as one
of several file formats (PNG, PDF, JPG, GIF, BMP, TIFF), which
can be downloaded to users’ PC for viewing and editing. TSSD
proves easy to use, fast, and customizable, in addition to providing
features that none of the current alternatives provide.

3 Future direction

We plan on building a database of domains and their consensus se—
quences using popular protein domain databases, such as Pfam
(Finn et al., 2014), so that users do not need to populate the pattern
field manually. We also plan on having TSDD scan the entered loci
for any domains within our database. Users will then be able to se—
lect which of the identified domains to display. The list of pre—
loaded organisms will grow over time as users request them to be
added to our database. We will listen to the suggestions and feed—
back from the users so that we can continuously improve TSDD to
meet the growing needs of the scientific community.

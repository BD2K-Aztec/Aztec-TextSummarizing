Abstract

Motivation: In profiling the composition and structure of complex microbial communities via high
throughput amplicon sequencing, a very low proportion of community members are typically
sampled. As a result of this incomplete sampling, estimates of dissimilarity between communities
are often inflated, an issue we term pseudo B-diversity.

Results: We present a set of tools to identify and correct for the presence of pseudo B-diversity in
contrasts between microbial communities. The variably weighted Odum dissimilarity (Dwodum)
allows for down-weighting the influence of either abundant or rare taxa in calculating a measure of
similarity between two communities. We show that down-weighting the influence of rare taxa can
be used to minimize pseudo B-diversity arising from incomplete sampling. Down-weighting the
influence of abundant taxa can increase the sensitivity of hypothesis testing. OTUshuff is an associ-
ated test for identifying the presence of pseudo B-diversity in pairwise community contrasts.
Availability and implementation: A Perl script for calculating the Ddeum score from a taxon abun-
dance table and performing pairwise contrasts with OTUshuff can be obtained at http://www.ars.

1 Introduction

The size and diversity of microbial populations pose challenges to
characterizing and contrasting communities. For instance, sequence-
based analyses of bacterial populations in soil frequently suggest the
presence of more than 106—109 individuals distributed across thou-
sands of distinct taxa per gram of soil (Deng et al., 2012; Kuffner
et al., 2012). Although the advent of high-throughput sequencing
technologies has increased the depth at which we are able to survey
microbial community composition, in many cases sampling still de-
tects only a fraction of the diversity present at a given site. For in-
stance, working with rhizosphere soil samples from a grass host
plant species, Lagos et al. (2014) obtained 30 000—60 000 sequence
reads per sample, yet estimated that they were able to detect only

90% of the OTUs that could have been observed at greater sampling
depth. Taxa that are present at low abundance may nevertheless be
important to understanding community dynamics. For instance,
Shade et al. (2014) have demonstrated from analyses of time series
in several different environments that many taxa are only condition-
ally rare, and may be present at dramatically higher abundances at
other time points.

While there is debate over the relative benefits of increasing sam-
pling depth versus increasing the number of samples analyzed
(Kuczynski et al., 2010) it is becoming increasingly common to trade
sample depth for more extensive replication. For instance, in a
recent characterization of the Arabidopsis-associated microbiome,
researchers analyzed 1248 samples at 1000 sequence reads per

sample (Lundberg et al., 2012). These developments highlight the
need for analytical approaches that are specifically designed to ac-
count for effects attributable to shallow sampling. It should be noted
that incomplete sampling will be a more pressing issue for environ-
ments that harbor the most diverse microbial communities, such
as soil.

Beyond simply creating a census of which bacterial taxa are pre-
sent in a given environment, researchers frequently desire to com-
pare two or more species assemblages for differences in species
composition and structure. A large number of indices are available
for such purposes [summarized in (Magurran, 2004)], but many of
these were developed in systems for which it is possible to be nearly
comprehensive in detecting species that are present in a given loca-
tion (i.e. plant and animal communities). In contrast, the majority of
species are likely to go undetected in shallow sequence-based surveys
of complex microbial communities.

Indices for describing the resemblance between communities are
often based either on species composition (i.e. presence-absence
measures) or on community structure (i.e. taking into consideration
the relative abundance of species within each community). Both
index types are sensitive to incomplete sampling (Chao et al., 2005).

When dealing with complex microbial communities, the infla-
tion of dissimilarity due to incomplete sampling is a concern; differ-
ential detection of low abundance taxa may be simply due to
insufficient sampling, and not to true absence from the community
(Chao et al., 2005). Furthermore, rare sequence variants may not al-
ways reflect true taxon presence or abundance; rather, they may be
introduced through errors in DNA replication or sequencing
(Quince et al., 2011). Thus, the ability to adjust the inﬂuence of low
abundance taxa on a measure of community resemblance is
desirable.

Indices that give less weight to low abundance community mem-
bers exist within the current suite of community resemblance metrics
(Magurran, 2004). For instance, Beck et al. (2013) compared 14 dif-
ferent measures of B-diversity and concluded that measures with
high dependency on the distribution of abundant taxa were the least
sensitive to under-sampling (e.g. Morisita-Horn). However, differ-
ences among microbial communities, or microbial community re-
sponse to experimental manipulation, may lie in changes in taxon
abundance anywhere across the distribution from dominant to rare
community members. Thus, a measure of dissimilarity should
ideally be tunable in its sensitivity toward rare or dominant
members.

Among non-phylogenetic measures of community resemblance,
the only method that we are aware of that is tunable in sensitivity to
rare taxa is the Normalized Expected Species Shared method of
Grassle and Smith (1976). However, this method adjusts the influ-
ence of rare taxa by re-sampling an observed taxon abundance table
at varying depths. Thus, this method relies upon the very problem
we are trying to address (incomplete sampling), and leaves room for
improvement. A variably weighted version of the phylogenetic dis-
tance measure UniFrac has been proposed (Chen et al., 2012), and
will be discussed below. Recent parallel developments in the field of
community diversity assessment have come to similar conclusions
regarding the utility of calculating diversity indices across a range of
sensitivities toward low abundance community members (Leinster
and Cobbold, 2012).

A number of statistical tests are available to assess the signifi-
cance of differences in microbial community structure, including
UniFrac, Parsimony, AMOVA and HOMOVA. Schloss (2008) has
provided a comparison of these methods, and suggests that each car-
ries distinct benefits. However, the effects of incomplete sampling

have not been well explored for statistical tests that contrast micro-
bial community structure. Here, we present a new analytical method
to contrast two samples, which indicates the likelihood that the
observed samples were drawn from a common community. We illus-
trate the method using simulated data, as well as bacterial sequence
data (partial 16S rRNA gene fragments) derived from 51 soil sam-
ples, collected across a range of geographic locations, plant com-
munities and land uses.

2 Methods

2.1 The variably weighted Odum dissimilarity index

The particular characteristics of sequence-based profiling of micro-
bial communities demand an appropriate index of community re-
semblance. We use as our starting point the traditional Odum index
(Odum, 1950):

3
Z lAi — Bil

DOdum = 1:31— 
2m.- + B.)
i=1

where A and B are the samples being compared, and S is the total
number of observed taxa. When the original taxon counts have been
converted into proportions (as we will assume throughout), the Odum
index is mathematically equivalent (Somerfield, 2008) to the com-
monly used Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index (Bray and Curtis, 1957):

S
22 min(A,—, 13,-)
DEC: 1— —"=1 S (2)
Z<Ai+Bi)
i=1

The proper naming and origins of these formulas are a topic of
some debate (Somerfield, 2008; Yoshioka, 2008); however, we use
the terms Odum index (Eq. 1) and Bray-Curtis dissimilarity (Eq. 2)
to differentiate the two notations. Regardless of the notation, with
this metric, differences in the abundance of common or rare taxa are
given equal weighting. As a modification that allows adjustable in-
ﬂuence based on taxon rarity, we propose a variably weighted ver-
sion of the Odum index, which we call deum:

S A B
Z(—1A::B:l * (Az- + Bo“)

Ddeum = 1:1 

ZS: ((Ai + 30°C)

i=1

 

where A and B are the samples being compared, S is the total number
of observed taxa and or is a weighting parameter, such that a2 0.
Dwodum is bounded between 0 and 1, where a score of 0 would re-
ﬂect the contrast of a community to itself (all taxa shared, and at the
same relative abundances in both communities) and a score of 1
would reﬂect completely dissimilar communities (no taxa shared be-
tween communities). When 0!: 1, DWOdum is reduced to Equation
(1) above and Dwodum is equal to Dodum or DBC; when or < 1, the in-
ﬂuence of abundant taxa will be down-weighted; and when or> 1,
the influence of low abundance taxa will be down-weighted. Figure
1 depicts a simple simulation in order to illustrate the effect of the
weighting parameter on DWOdum scores.

In this example, we started with two samples having the follow-
ing taxon abundance distributions (Community A: [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5,
4, 3, 2, 1]; Community B: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]). In order to

simulate rarity, additional singleton taxa (A,: 0, B,-: 1 or A,-: 1, B,-: 0]
were added up to a total of 1000 taxa per sample. As expected, as oz
approaches 0 the DWOdum score shows increasing responsiveness to
rare taxa; whereas, as oz increases above 1, a reduced sensitivity to
rare taxa is evident (Fig. 1A). In order to simulate taxon dominance
(i.e. low community evenness), the abundance of Taxon1 [A1: 10,
B1: 1] was increased x-fold for both populations (i.e. for x: 100,
A1: 1000, B1: 100) with all other OTUs unchanged. In this case, sen-
sitivity toward dominant taxa decreased when oz < 1 and increased
when oz > 1 (Fig. 1B).

2.2 OTUshuff

We also introduce a new method, termed OTUshuff, which utilizes a
Monte Carlo simulation to test whether two samples are likely to
have been drawn from a common starting population (see schematic
in Fig. 2). From the observed abundances of operational taxonomic
units (OTUs), OTUshuff calculates the Dwodum score for a pair of
samples (Dwodmn_obsewed). Next, the two samples are combined to
create a single pool, which is re-divided into two sets via random
draws without replacement, using a weighted probability based on the
combined abundance distribution. For example, if the relative
abundance of OTU,- was 0% in Community A and 2% in Community
B, the probability of any sequence read being assigned to OTU,-
during drawing for either sample is 1 %. This process is repeated until
the two samples are repopulated with the number of reads
in the smaller of the two originally observed communities and
Dwodum is re-computed (DWOdum_random). This process is repeated

munity structures. Different colored lines or bars represent different microbial
community types. (A) Ten microbial community types were assumed to have
abundances that followed normal distributions about varying optima along a
hypothetical environmental gradient. Within each community type, there are
1000 taxa whose abundances follow a logarithmic distribution. (B) Sampling
various points along this hypothetical environmental gradient yields a range
of observed microbial community structures

as follows:

where 5 = 1/number of iterations, and n=the count of iterations in
which DWOdum_random < DWOdum_obsewed. DWOdum and OTUshuff can
be obtained from: http://www.ars.usda.gov/services/software/soft
ware.htm?modecode=30-12-10-00. OTUshuff.pl allows the user to
calculate DWOdum at defined values of oz and to conduct OTUshuff,
with results output in both tabular and lower-triangular matrix forms.
The program requires as input a taxon abundance table formatted as
a Mothur ‘shared’ file (http://www.mothur.org). Users can specify the
threshold for taxon delimitation (i.e. sequence similarity threshold for
binning sequences into operational taxonomic units, as defined by
Mothur), and the number of iterations to conduct. For datasets con-
taining more than two samples, OTUshuff will automatically conduct
each pairwise comparison for all samples in the dataset. Because not
all comparisons may be of biological interest, OTUshuff does not cor-
rect P-values for multiple comparisons (e.g. Bonferoni’s adjustment).
We leave multiple test correction to the user’s discretion.

2.3 Simulated data

We simulated samples varying in microbial community structures by
assuming a hypothetical environmental gradient, across which 10
microbial community types could be found, with the abundance of
each community type following a normal distribution about a
unique optimum (u=5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, 75, 85, or 95), but
with a common variance (6:20). Each community type consisted
of 1000 taxa (i.e. OTUs), with relative abundances following a loga-
rithmic distribution (®=0.9999). Thus, sampling any given loca-
tion along this hypothetical gradient (Fig. 3A, dotted black lines)
could yield up to 10 000 possible OTUs. Individual observations (i.e.

sequence reads) at a given location along the gradient were assigned to
taxa probabilistically, leading to differences in observed communities
among locations (Fig. 3B). With this approach, diversity and evenness
will be lower at the extremes, compared to the center of the gradient.
The phylogenetic distances required for DGUniFI-ac were modeled in a
manner similar to that of Schloss (2008). Brieﬂy, distances between
OTUs within a community were randomly generated from a two-di-
mensional circle (1': 0.1) and each community centroid was offset by
0.1 (e.g. community 1: 0; community 2: 0.1; community 3: 0.2; etc.).

From these defined communities, we simulated true B-diversity
(that is, measured distance or dissimilarity between two fully-sampled
communities). It should be noted that true B-diversity can only be
known in the context of simulated communities for which compos-
ition is determined a priori and for which the taxon abundance distri-
butions are defined. We selected 15 locations along the environmental
gradient (1—10, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100), and at each location allowed
the abundance of each OTU to vary randomly by: 0—100%. This
process was repeated five times to generate a set of replicate samples
at each location, and then the full simulation was repeated 100 times.
Complete sampling was assumed to occur at 109 individuals per sam-
ple, or the point where each OTU present along the hypothetical en-
vironmental gradient was detected at least once.

To simulate pseudo B-diversity (that is, the portion of a pairwise
distance or dissimilarity that is attributable purely to having an in-
complete census of the two communities in question), a set number
of observations could be drawn probabilistically to generate com-
munity surveys with incomplete sampling.

2.4 Observed data

Soils were collected from 11 different sites representing a wide range
of geographic locations, plant communities and land uses (Table 1)
within the United States. Within each site, a single soil sample
(0—7.5 cm depth) was collected from each plot (11 = 3—4) unless speci-
fied differently. For each of the three Alaska sites (AK.1, AK.2, AK.3),
plots were centered on a single white spruce tree with each tree
located a minimum of 1 km apart. The CA.1 site is a commercial po-
tato farm located in Tulelake, California and was sampled

immediately prior to harvest. The CO.1 site was part of cover crop
study located in the San Luis Valley, Colorado (Essah et al., 2012).
Plots were sampled at the end of a cover crop rotation (i.e. mowing
and incorporation). The remaining three Colorado sites (CO.2, CO.3,
CO.4) are all part of the Dryland Agroecosystems Project (Sherrod
et al., 2014) with each plot (11 = 4) consisting of a single soil sample
from a randomly selected plot under wheat management. The sites
MA.1 and MA.2 are golf courses located in Massachusetts, where
each plot consists of a fairway and rough sample from three different
holes per course. The NE site consists of a switchgrass cultivar trial at
the University of Nebraska’s Agricultural Research and Development
Center with each plot consisting of twelve switchgrass plants of the
same cultivar. From each plot (11: 3) rhizosphere soil (0 to 15cm)
was collected from a single plant.

2.5 DNA extraction and PCR amplification

DNA was extracted from 0.5 g subsamples of each soil collection
using the MoBio UltraClean-HTPTM soil DNA isolation kit
(Carlsbad, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s recommenda-
tions plus an additional purification step with AMPure beads
(Agencourt, MA, USA) to further remove humic acids and other
PCR inhibitors. Extracted DNA was quantified by spectrophotom-
etry and diluted to a final concentration of 10 ng ul'l. Amplification
of bacterial 16S rRNA gene fragments was performed as described
by Manter et al. (2010), using primers 27F and 388R to amplify
across the V1—V3 hypervariable regions of the gene. Primers were
modified to add a unique barcode (Hamady et al., 2008) to ampli-
cons from each of 51 distinct samples (Table 1). Unidirectional (Lib-
L) pyrosequencing was performed under contract with Duke
University’s IGSP Sequencing Core Facility using a 454 Life Sciences
GS FLX System with standard chemistry.

2.6 Sequence processing

All sequence read editing and processing was performed with Mothur
Ver. 1.32 (Schloss et al., 2009) using the default settings unless
otherwise noted. Brieﬂy, sequence reads were (i) trimmed (bdiff= 0,
pdiff = 0, qaverage = 25 , minlength = 1 00, maxambig = 0,
maxhomop = 10); (ii) aligned to the bacterial-subset SILVA alignment
available at the Mothur website (http://www.mothur.org); (iii) filtered
to remove vertical gaps; (iv) screened for chimeras with UCHIME
(Edgar et al., 2011); (v) classified using the RDP training set Vers. 9
(http://www.mothur.org) and the naive Baysian classifier (Wang et al.,
2007) embedded in Mothur, after which all sequences identified as
chloroplast or mitochondria were removed; (vi) sequences were
screened (optimize = minlength-end, criteria 2 95) and filtered
(vertical 2 T, trump=.) so that all sequences covered the same genetic
space; and (vii) all sequences were pre-clustered (diff=2) to remove
potential pyrosequencing noise and clustered (calc = onegap, cou-
tends = F, method 2 average) into operational taxonomic units or
OTUs (Huse et al., 2010). After processing, each site- or plot-specific
library was randomly split into subsamples of 1000 sequence reads in
order to standardize sampling effort for each sample, and to generate
replicate subsamples from within a given library for comparison.
Differences between replicate subsamples from the same dataset repre-
sent sensitivity to low sample coverage, and should be minimized. If a
method is truly suitable for severely under-sampled communities, a
comparative analysis should not detect a statistical difference between
subsamples from the same library.

Mothur Ver. 1.32. Generalized UniFrac scores (DGUniFrac) were cal-
culated using the R package GUniFrac (Chen et al., 2012) because
this score is not presently implemented in Mothur.

3.1 Simulated data

3.1.1 Comparing indices of community resemblance where true
B-diversity is known

When assessing true B-diversity with DWOdum, the most notable ef-
fect of adjusting the influence of low abundance taxa via the oz par-
ameter was the effect on estimates of B-diversity among very similar
communities. For example, as oz increased, especially when oz> 1,
the calculated scores exhibited greater variability, which increased
as sample similarity increased (Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig. S1). A
smaller, but still noticeable effect was that as oz increased, scores
tended to spread out. For example, at oz: 0, mean DWOdum scores
ranged from 0.394 to 0.890 for the 1 versus 1 and 1 versus 100 loca-
tion comparisons, respectively; whereas, at oz=4, scores ranged
from 0.267 to 1.000 (Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig. S1). DGUniFr,1C
shows a similar behavior to DWOdum with distance scores expanding
as oz increases; although variation remained small regardless of oz-
level (Supplementary Fig. 52).

Interestingly, some other existing indices (e.g. DManhattan,
Dsoergel and D®YC) were particularly sensitive to small changes in
community structure, leading to increased variability and higher es-
timates of B-diversity than expected. For example, all three of these
measures indicated that locations 1 versus 10 were more different
than locations 1 versus 20 (Supplementary Fig. S3C, E, F), while we
know from the mathematically defined species distributions that
communities become increasingly different with separation along
the hypothetical environmental gradient.

The variability inherent in an index of community resemblance
has a major influence on the ability to visually detect clustering and
differentiate among treatments. For instance, principal coordinates
ordination plots revealed a wide variation in the amount of overlap
between communities from our simulated environmental gradient
(Supplementary Figs 54—56). For instance, communities drawn be-
tween locations 1 and 20 were virtually indistinguishable when DMH
and D®YC were used, while Dcanberra and DGOWer provided better
separation among these communities (Supplementary Fig. S4).

Fig. 4. For simulated communities drawn from a hypothetical environmental
gradient, calculated dissimilarities (Dwodum) for the contrast of each location
versus location 1, with variations to the influence of low abundance taxa
achieved via the weighting parameter, oz. The lines connect adjacent means
and are not fitted curves. The error bars represent 1 SD, based on 5 instances
of perturbing the same original community abundance distribution. The con-
trast of location 1 versus location 1 represents dissimilarities among per-
turbed samples, and is not the contrast of a single community to itself

These differences among the indices become more easily interpret-
able within the context of a family of dissimilarity scores which vary
in a coherent way in sensitivity to low abundance community mem-
bers. For instance, contrasting principal coordinate plots derived from
DWOdum scores in which oz is varied between 0 and 3 reveals that the
true relationships among the locations, in this simulated dataset, are
best revealed by down-weighting the impact of dominant taxa
(Supplementary Fig. S5). The DGUniFI-ac scores reveal a similar insight,
providing better cluster separation among communities located prox-
imately on the simulated gradient when less weight is given to the
high abundance branches (Supplementary Fig. S6).

Variability naturally also has a strong effect on hypothesis test-
ing. For example, the closest location on the simulated gradient for
which community structure was found to be significantly different
(AMOVA, P < 0.05) from location 1 occurred at location 2, 4, 7, 8
and 10 for Dwodum with oz at 0, 0.5, 1, 2 and 3, respectively.

ces, ranging from high to low: Dearly”,m1 and DGOW6r >
DManhattan> DSoergel > DMH and D®YC. However, we reiterate that
there is no clear framework for evaluating contrasts among these
disparate indices, and that this promotes an arbitrary selection of
the index that happens to provide a clear pattern, often with no
understanding of why this might be the case.

3.1.2 Comparing indices of community resemblance where pseudo
B-diversity is present

Incomplete sampling of simulated communities was used to demon-
strate the effects of pseudo B-diversity on measures of community re-
semblance. For each location of interest along the simulated
environmental gradient, five independent subsamples were gener-
ated at various sampling depths. Pseudo B-diversity resulting from
incomplete sampling would be expected to inflate estimates of dis-
tance or dissimilarity, particularly where differences between com-
munities are derived from low abundance taxa (e.g. contrasts
between communities proximally located along the simulated envir-
onmental gradient). This is illustrated nicely by varying oz for the
DWOdum score: increasing oz gives more weight to dominant taxa and
reduces pseudo B-diversity associated with incomplete sample
(Fig. 5).

In contrast, some existing indices responded erratically to incom-
plete sampling. For instance, DGOWer and DManhattan, which are inﬂu-
enced by sampling effort (i.e. unbounded) and Dcanberra, which is
normalized by the total number of taxa, gave erroneously low esti-
mates of B-diversity when sampling was incomplete (Supplementary
Fig. S7; Table 2). The DGUniFI-ac score also responded less consistently
to incomplete sampling, compared to the DWOdum score. For instance,
at low sampling depth, DGUniFI-ac actually underestimated the distance
between very distinct communities (Supplementary Fig. S8C—F, loca-
tion 1 versus location 100). There was also a spike in DGUniFrac score
for our simulated communities (except at the lowest oz) when the
number of sequence reads obtained was equal to the number of pos-
sible taxa (Supplementary Fig. S8). As might be expected, accurate
DGUniFrac scores are only obtained once the majority of the OTUs (i.e.
branches) have been successfully sampled; in our simulation, this
occurs at ca. 104 individuals or the expected number of OTUs at each
location.

3.1.3 Combining true and pseudo B-diversity

The final simulation conducted included both true and pseudo B-
diversity by allowing each OTU to randomly vary by :0—100%
and sub-sampling to 1000 reads. As expected, estimates of

B-diversity increased due to incomplete sampling. Because incom-
plete sampling primarily results in the failure to detect low abun-
dance taxa, this inflation in estimates of B-diversity represents the
inﬂuence of low abundance community members that may be uni-
versally present, but are differentially detected by chance.
Accordingly, increasing oz to give more weight to dominant taxa
successfully corrects for this pseudo B-diversity (Fig. 6). Once oz 2 2,
there was no longer any significant effect of pseudo B-diversity (due
to incomplete sampling) on measures of within-location community
distance or dissimilarity; in other words, pseudo B-diversity was
removed by adjusting oz.

In an effort to determine the appropriate sampling depth
required to achieve accurate estimates of B-diversity, we calculated a
bias for each index of community resemblance (Table 2), where bias
is defined as the difference in score with incomplete sampling versus
the score at complete sampling. At 1000 reads per sample, a com-
mon sampling depth in many studies, the bias in calculated scores
differed dramatically depending upon the index chosen. For both
the DWOdum and DGUniFr,1C scores, increasing oz substantially reduced
bias. For example, the mean bias for Dwodum and DGUniFr,1C when
oz 2 4 was 0.025 and 0.051, respectively. In comparison, the bias for
DMH was 0.075 (Table 2).

3.2 Using Dwodum and OTUshuff with biological data

We also present real biological data derived from natural soil com-
munities to demonstrate the effects of DWOdum and OTUshuff on
observed dissimilarities between communities from different sites,
plots within a site and unique subsamples of sequence reads from
the same sample. Dissimilarity between subsamples from the same
sample indicates an inflated estimate of B-diversity due to incom-
plete sampling. Such pseudo B-diversity should be minimized in a
way that does not hinder the ability to detect biologically important
differences in plot- or site-level comparisons.

When low abundance taxa were more heavily weighted, sub-
samples of sequence reads drawn from a common pool displayed
substantial B-diversity (Fig. 7C, oz 3 1). However, reducing the influ-
ence of low-abundance taxa on the dissimilarity score reduced this
pseudo B-diversity dramatically (Fig. 7C, oz> 1). Importantly, this
down-weighting of low abundance taxa did not substantially impact
the scores for cross-site contrasts (Fig. 7A). Varying the inﬂuence of
low abundance taxa on the score index had a moderate impact on
contrasts between plots within a site; calculated dissimilarity be-
tween plots within a site decreased as low abundance taxa were
given less influence on the score. However, over 75% of pairwise
contrasts between communities observed in different plots at the
same site remained significant (OTUshuff, P < 0.05) even at oz=4
(Fig. 7B).

Fig. 6. Effect of varying the influence of low abundance community members
(via the ozweighting parameter) on a dissimilarity score (Dwodum), using simu-
lated communities. Contrasts are between communities drawn from the
same location on our hypothetical environmental gradient, but then per-
turbed to simulate true B-diversity. Pseudo B-diversity was introduced by
shallow sampling (1000 reads). Bars are the mean :1 SD for all replicate
comparisons (e.g. location 1 versus 1, 5 versus 5,10 versus 10, etc.)

The inﬂuence of low abundance taxa on site-specific estimates of
B-diversity (i.e. distance or dissimilarity among plots within sites)
varied by greatly by site (Fig. 8). For example, when oz 2 1 the range
of site-specific B-diversity was 0.678 (AK.2) to 0.852 (AK.1);
whereas, when oz=4 the range was 0.162 (MA.2) to 0.702 (CO.1).
In addition, the patterns observed when rare taxa were down-
weighted (oz 2 4) appear to be more consistent with known site attri-
butes, compared to when rare taxa influenced the score to a greater
degree (oz 2 1). For example, we would expect to observe the highest
B-diversity at the CO.1 site because a variety of different plant spe-
cies were sampled at this site. In contrast, all other sites tended to be
dominated by a single over-story plant species and might therefore
be expected to have lower B-diversity among plots. It is only when
the influence of rare taxa is down-weighted (Fig. 8B) that is expected
pattern becomes evident.

Regardless, it is clear from our simulated and real biological data
that pseudo B-diversity can drastically increase B-diversity estimates
particularly as samples become more similar (e.g. plot and/or sub-
sample comparisons). Ideally, one could increase sampling depth as
sample similarity increases; however, in lieu of this solution the
down-weighting of rare OTUs with Dwodum appears to be a viable
option to reduce the effects of pseudo B-diversity on estimates of
community resemblance. By comparison, DGUniFr,1C is less effective

at reducing pseudo B-diversity because of limitations to the range of
oz. Extending oz above 1 in an effort to reduce the potential effects of
pseudo B-diversity on DGUniFr,1C scores resulted in distances for all
comparisons (sites, plots within sites and subsamples) approaching
zero (Supplementary Fig. S9). In other words, site differences were
not preserved with DGUniFr,1C as oz was increased.

Existing indices varied widely in their ability to differentiate
soil bacterial communities from different sites and to avoid
pseudo B-diversity associated with incomplete sampling. For
instance, Dcanberra between subsamples drawn from a common
pool was low, but this index was also unable to detect appreciable
difference between sites (Supplementary Fig. 510). In contrast,
DSoergel between communities from different sites was high, but
this index was also prone to over-estimating B-diversity between
subsamples drawn from a common pool (Supplementary
Fig. S10).

4 Discussion

Ecologists have a well-developed set of techniques for comparing
the composition and structure of communities. However, exten-
sion of these approaches into new systems and the implementation
of new techniques for surveying community membership may re-
quire new approaches and on-going refinement of traditional
methods. In particular, the widespread adoption of DNA se-
quence-based methods of characterizing microbial communities in
complex environments such as soil has created unique analytical
challenges.

Comprehensive surveys of microbial inhabitants are often un-
feasible, and limited resources require balancing a trade-off between
depth of characterization and breadth of sampling. It has become
quite common for microbial ecologists to sample communities to a
very shallow depth, where the number of observations is lower than
the number of taxa that are present (Roesch et al., 2007; Eiler et al.,
2012; Lundberg et al., 2012); as a result, estimates of distance or
dissimilarity between samples tend to be very large, and may arise
from either true or pseudo B-diversity depending upon the true
underlying similarity (e.g. Fig. 7).

Currently, there are no statistical tools available to evaluate the
potential for pseudo B-diversity to inflate estimates of community
distance or dissimilarity. Our procedure for pairwise contrasts,
OTUshuff, is insensitive to pseudo B-diversity, correctly identifying
all subsamples drawn from the same community as not significantly
different. Therefore, OTUshuff is a useful tool to identify if scores
are likely to be associated with pseudo B-diversity and whether reli-
able estimates of B-diversity may require additional sampling, or an
alternative index. For instance, in lieu of additional sampling, we
show that DWOdum with ozZ 1 is a suitable approach to remove
pseudo B-diversity and provide more accurate estimates of commu-
nity dissimilarity (Table 2; Fig. 7).

When samples are drawn from genuinely different communities,
OTUshuff consistently shows significant differences. In these mean-
ingful contrasts, as we discuss above, varying the choice of commu-
nity resemblance index, or DWOdum oz level, may increase the
sensitivity to detect differences. Although a wide array of indices
and tests are available, each has its own inherent limitations
(Magurran, 2004; Schloss, 2008). While users could pick and choose
among existing indices, we have shown that these measures can be
sensitive to incomplete sampling, often in unpredictable ways. We
also suggest that it is preferable to be able to adjust weightings
within the context of a consistent index, rather than switching defin-
itions of community resemblance in order to achieve the desired

weightings. The tunable nature of the DWOdum and DGUniFr,1C scores
offers maximum selectivity and sensitivity. For example, DWOdum
and DGUniFr,1C were the only two scores that could consistently detect
a significant difference (AMOVA, P < 0.05) between location 1 and
2 in our simulated environmental gradient, and this was achieved by
increasing the influence of rare taxa (oz 2 0).

We have highlighted at several points that the variable weight-
ing of Dwodum mirrors the capabilities of the phylogenetic distance
measure DGUniFrac. However, there are substantial differences be-
tween these methods. Primarily, DGUniFrac is a phylogenetic dis-
tance, which requires the ability to place observed taxa onto a
phylogenetic tree so that branch lengths can be used in calculating
distances. However, there are applications for which it may not be
possible to determine a reliable phylogenetic tree, particularly
when using highly variable DNA sequences such as internal tran-
scribed spacer (ITS) data. The weighting parameter for DGUniFrac,
as originally described, was limited to oz 6 [0,1]. We report
DGUniFm1C scores at oz > 1 for purposes of comparison with DWOdum,
but with our biological data DGUniFr,1C became insensitive to be-
tween plot and between site B-diversity at these higher levels of oz
(Supplementary Fig. S9). Thus, Dwodum may be preferable for
more severe down-weighting of low abundance taxa. When com-
paring Dwodum and DGUniFrac scores, two patterns become appar-
ent (i) DGUniFr,1C variability is not affected as strongly as Dwodum
by oz level, and (ii) DGUniFrac is prone to large deviations in result-
ant scores depending upon the number of sequence reads employed
(e.g. Supplementary Fig. S8—5000 reads). We suggest that this is
due to the additional branch-length weighting in DGUniFrac, and de-
pending upon the sampling intensity and the user’s interests, such
weighting may not be desired.

In setting oz for contrasting observed microbial communities,
users should consider both the coverage of their sampling (i.e. the
proportion of the estimated total number of taxa present that
were actually observed) and the expected degree of similarity
among the communities that are being contrasted. Lower coverage
indicates that many low abundance taxa may have been differen-
tially detected simply due to incomplete sampling, and therefore
that the influence of low abundance taxa should be down-
weighted in calculating community dissimilarity. If the commun-
ities being contrasted are expected to be highly similar (for in-
stance, samples drawn from the same individual host, samples
collected under stringently controlled environmental conditions,
or samples collected at frequent intervals over a time series), than
the low abundance taxa may be critical to measuring community
resemblance, and their influence on the dissimilarity score may be
increased. As with any framework for simulating datasets, our ap-
proach to simulating microbial communities has limitations. For
instance, simulated communities found along our hypothetical en-
vironmental gradient followed a normal distribution in the decline
of abundance with distance from their optimum. This is a sim-
plifying assumption. We did not attempt to contrast communities
influenced simultaneously by more than one ecological gradient,
or differing in underlying population structures (e.g. abundance
distributions, evenness, or richness). As for any new metric, add-
itional testing under various simulation strategies is warranted to
better understand its controlling factors.

In conclusion, the new analytical tools introduced here will fa-
cilitate progress in understanding the forces that structure complex
microbial communities. Dwodum is a dissimilarity index for which
the inﬂuence of low abundance taxa is tunable. OTUshuff is a new
statistical test to determine whether two samples are drawn from
genuinely different communities.

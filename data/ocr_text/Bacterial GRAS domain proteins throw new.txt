ABSTRACT

Summary: Gibberellic acids (GAs) are key plant hormones, regulating
various aspects of growth and development, which have been at the
center of the ‘green revolution’. GRAS family proteins, the primary
players in GA signaling pathways, remain poorly understood. Using
sequence-profile searches, structural comparisons and phylogenetic
analysis, we establish that the GRAS family first emerged in bacteria
and belongs to the Rossmann fold methyltransferase superfamily. All
bacterial and a subset of plant GRAS proteins are likely to function as
small-molecule methylases. The remaining plant versions have lost
one or more AdoMet (SAM)—binding residues while preserving their
substrate-binding residues. We predict that GRAS proteins might
either modify or bind small molecules such as GAs or their derivatives.

1 INTRODUCTION

Gibberellic acids (GAS) are a large family of diterpene molecules
that are currently known to be synthesized by plants, fungi and
bacteria (Yamaguchi, 2008). In plants they are key hormones
that regulate various aspects of development such as seed ger-
mination, stem elongation, leaf expansion, ﬂower development
and asymmetric cell division in roots. The major plant players
implicated in GA response are GRAS family proteins, which
include diverse members such as GA insensitive (GAI)
(Koornneef et al., 1985; Peng et al., 1997), Repressor of GAl-3
(RGAl/DELLA) (Silverstone et al., 1997), Short-root (Benfey
et al., 1993), Scarecrow (SCR) (Di Laurenzio et al., 1996) and
Nodulation Signal Pathway l and 2 (NSPl and NSP2) (Kalo
et al., 2005; Smit et al., 2005). While the GRAS family has been
studied intensely for more than a decade as the so-called ‘green
revolution’ genes (Peng et al., 1999), there is little clarity about
their actual mode of action in GA pathways. Genetic and mo-
lecular studies have suggested that at least 23 members of the
GRAS family have functions related to GA signaling in
Arabidopsis (Lee et al., 2008). Of these, GAI and RGAl help
in establishing repressive chromatin as the default state at pro-
moters of genes that are regulated by GA (Peng et al., 1997;

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Silverstone et al., 1997). The presence of GA results in recruit-
ment of GAIl to the GA receptor, a protein of the 05/,8 hydrolase
superfamily, which in turn results in the GAIl being targeted for
proteasomal destruction via ubiquitination by a F-Box-Skp com-
plex (Murase et al., 2008). Thus, GA-sensitive genes are dere-
pressed in the presence of a GA signal. In contrast, several
GRAS members such as SCL3 appear to act as positive regula-
tors downstream of GA by removing the block imposed by the
negative regulators such as GAI and RGAl (Heo et al., 2011).
Consistent with their opposing roles in GA signaling, mutations
in certain members of this superfamily result in dwarfing of
plants, others result in overgrowth and on rare occasions differ-
ent alleles of the same gene cause either dwarfing or overgrowth
(Lee et al., 2008). Additionally, application of external GA is
able to rescue the effects of loss of function mutations in another
member of the GRAS family, SCR, in relation to asymmetric cell
division during root development to restore normal development
of endodermis, middle cortex and cortex cells. GRAS proteins
have been localized in the nucleus and are implicated in
transcription-related functions that are not clearly understood
in terms of mechanisms (Cui et al., 2011). In large part this
lack of understanding of the GRAS family functions stems
from a previously published sequence analysis study that errone-
ously reported a relationship between them and metazoan STAT
proteins (Richards et al., 2000). Other erroneous relationships
have also been reported for the GRAS family and include the
purported presence of a leucine zipper or a SH2 domain (Di
Laurenzio et al., 1996; Peng et al., 1999). These erroneous rela-
tionships have contributed to unsupported assumptions that they
must be conventional transcription factors. Indeed, there have
been several experimental studies that have built on this and
attempted to show DNA binding for certain GRAS proteins,
although this cannot be confirmed for other related proteins
(Hirsch et al., 2009). Thus, a uniﬁed mechanism for the ac-
tion of the GRAS proteins could considerably help in under-
standing their apparently opposite roles with respect to GA
signaling. Through sequence profile searches, structural compari-
sons and phylogenetic analysis, we establish that the GRAS
family belongs to the Rossmann fold methyltransferase super-
family that first emerged in bacteria. We further show that an-
cestral bacterial GRAS proteins are likely to function as active
small-molecule methylases. In contrast, the majority of plant
GRAS domains show disruptions of their AdoMet (SAM)—bind-
ing residues while preserving their substrate-binding residues,
suggesting that they might function as small-molecule-binding
domains.

2 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

2.1 GRAS proteins belong to the Rossmann fold
methyltransferase superfamin

To understand better the affinities of the GRAS family, we
first investigated the veracity of previous claims regarding their
sequence relationships. Using a PSI-BLAST search of the
non-redundant protein database (NR) (Altschul et al., 1997)
initiated with the Arabidopsis thaliana Scarecrow protein (SCR,
gi: 1497 987), we obtained a comprehensive collection of GRAS
family sequences. An examination of the multiple alignment of
these GRAS proteins revealed a globular region of 3854100
amino acids (referred to hereinafter as the GRAS domain)
with no other clear globular regions in the remainder of the
protein. Some versions had two tandem copies of the GRAS
domain (e.g. gi: 8778540 from A. thaliana), while others had
poorly structured N-terminal extensions with a few a-helical seg-
ments that have been termed the DELLA domain (Murase et al.,
2008). Secondary structure prediction using an alignment of the
globular GRAS domain revealed a regular succession of
oz-helices and ,B-strands reminiscent of the pattern observed in
three-layered 05/,8 sandwiches, such as the domains possessing
the Rossmann fold. This indicated that the GRAS family is un-
likely to possess a STAT-type DNA-binding domain or a SH2
domain as previously claimed. The STAT-type DNA-binding
domains adopt a cytochrome f-like ,8—sandwich fold, whereas
the SH2 domain adopts a ,B-barrel structure (Andreeva et al.,
2008), both of which are incompatible with the predicted second-
ary structure of the GRAS domain. It also ruled out the presence
of the previously proposed leucine zipper in the GRAS family.
We further performed proﬁle—proﬁle comparisons using a HMM
derived from the multiple alignment of the GRAS domain with
the HHpred program against a panel of HMMs derived using
PFAM models and PDB structures as search seeds (Soding et al.,
2005). These did not recover any statistically significant hits to
STAT-like DNA-binding domains, SH2 domains or leucine zip-
pers, strongly excluding the possibility of any relationship be-
tween GRAS and these domains.

Our sequence profile searches recovered homologous se-
quences from angiosperms, gymnosperms, lycopodiophytes
(club-mosses, i.e. Selaginella) and bryophytes (classical mosses,
i.e. Physcomitrella), but not any of the basal members of the
green-plant lineage, such as chlorophyte algae. Interestingly, out-
side of the land plant clade, the GRAS domain was also observed
in several bacteria, namely, representatives of deltaproteobac-
teria, firmicutes and cytophagaceae (e. g. gi:383452287 from del-
taproteobacterium Corallococcus coralloides recovered in
iteration 2 with (2:10—15). Detection of the bacterial versions
of the GRAS domain offered a new handle to understand its
affinities, especially given that the versions from plants are very
closely related, being part of a relatively recent lineage-specific
expansion. Accordingly, we searched the NR database with the
GRAS protein from the deltaproteobacterium Stigmatella aur-
cmtiaca (gi: 115 373 923) and restricted the search to bacteria in
order to avoid obscuring of the search by the over 2500 hits from
land plants. In this search, in addition to the bacterial GRAS
proteins, we also recovered significant hits to several Rossmann
fold methyltransferase domains (e.g. the small-molecule methy-
lase ubiG from Rhodobacter sphaeroides with e: 10—5) and the

pairwise alignment revealed a match to the GXGXG signa-
ture seen in the Rossmann fold of the methylases (Schubert
et al., 2003). This relationship between the GRAS domains
and the methyltransferases was further confirmed using pro-
file—proﬁle comparisons using the HHpred program initiated
with a HMM based on the alignment of the GRAS domain,
which recovered profiles based on the structures of several
small molecule methylases as the best hits (e.g. histamine N-
methyltransferase, PDB: 2aot, probability 99.7%; YecO, PDB:
1im8, probability 98%; rebeccamycin biosynthesis methyltrans-
ferase, PDB: 3bus, probability 97%). This strongly suggested
that the GRAS domain is indeed a version of the Rossmann
fold methylase domain.

We generated a multiple alignment that included bacterial and
plant GRAS domains along with several experimentally and
structurally characterized methyltransferase domains and refined
this alignment based on their three-dimensional structures
(Fig. 1A). This revealed that GRAS domain contains a core
typical of the Rossmann fold methylases with seven strands
forming a central sheet, with the last two strands (6 and 7)
forming a ,B-hairpin. The GRAS domain shares with several
small-molecule and protein arginine methylases an a-helical ex-
tension, N-terminal to strand-l of the Rossmann fold, which
forms a cap over the active site (Fig. 1B), and plays an important
role in contacting the substrate and shielding the active site from
the bulk solvent (Horton et al., 2005; Lim et al., 2001). The
GRAS domain also shows a well-developed a-helical insert be-
tween the strand-5 and the downstream helix of the core
Rossmann fold. This insert occupies a position similar to the
bi-helical insert observed in the histamine N—methyltransferase,
YecO (PDB: 1im8) and phosphoethanolamine methyltransferase
(PDB: 3ujc), and along with the N-terminal helical extension, is
likely to play a role in binding the substrate (Fig. 1B).
Examination of the multiple alignment showed that bacterial
GRAS domains contain a conserved glutamate at the end of
strand-2 (Fig. 1B) that in other methyltransferases is known to
form hydrogen bonds with the 2’- and 3’-hydroxyls of the ribose
moiety of the AdoMet (SAM) substrate (Horton et al., 2005;
Schubert et al., 2003). Similarly, they display a conserved glu-
tamate just at the beginning of helix-5 which corresponds to a
polar residue in several methyltransferases that interacts with the
adenine ring of SAM (Horton et al., 2005; Lim et al., 2001;
Schubert et al., 2003). The end of strand-4 in bacterial GRAS
domains is characterized by a polar residue, typically asparagine,
which in other methylases plays a catalytic role in the
methyl-transfer reaction (Horton et al., 2005; Schubert et al.,
2003). These features, in conjunction with the intact
SAM-binding loop at the C—terminus of strand-l, indicate that
the bacterial GRAS proteins are likely to function as active
SAM-dependent methylases. The GRAS proteins show a con-
served glutamate at the end of strand-5, which by analogy to
other methyltransferases is likely to correspond to the position
that contacts the substrate. Likewise, the GRAS proteins show
conserved charged residues both in the a-helical insert down-
stream of strand 5 and the N-terminal a-helical extension,
which, based on the precedence of other methylase domains,
are likely to be critical for substrate interaction. Importantly,
the residues specific for binding SAM have been partially
or entirely substituted in the majority of plant GRAS

domains barring certain representatives of the clade including

Selaginella (Fig. 1A). However
residues appear to be intact in majority of the plant proteins

(Fig. 1A). This observation suggests that, unlike the bacterial
versions, majority of plant versions are likely to lack methyl-
transferase activity but still bind a similar substrate as the bac-

terial versions.

D.Zhang et al.

 

versions are catalytically active methylases nested within a larger
radiation of active methyltransferases in bacteria. A phylogenetic
tree including bacterial, bryophyte, lycopodiophyte and angio-
sperm GRAS domains (Fig. 1C) revealed that the plant versions
are nested within the bacterial radiation, and of the currently
available bacterial sequences appear closest to versions from del-
taproteobacteria. As, excepting versions from the basal-most
plant-specific SCL14-like clade, majority of plant versions are
inactive, the bacterial versions are likely to represent the ances-
tral condition and to be precursors of the plant versions. The
plant versions can be divided into 13 distinct well-supported
clades (bootstrap values >80%) that contained at least one rep-
resentative from bryophytes, lycopodiophytes and angiosperms.
These lines of evidence suggest that there was a single transfer of
a GRAS domain from a bacterial source to the common ances-
tor of land plants (Fig. 1C). These 13 distinct clades include those
prototyped by the A. thaliana versions such as Scarecrow,
Shortroot, SCL3, GAI/RGA/DELLA and Hairy Meristem,
among others, suggesting that major functional diversification
of the GRAS family happened very early in land plant evolution.
These indicate that separate GRAS-dependent GA signaling
mechanisms, which are cognates of shoot elongation, root
growth and root cortex differentiation in angiosperms, were al-
ready established at the base of the extant land plant lineages.
Beyond this, much of the evolution of the GRAS family is char-
acterized by extensive lineage-specific expansions within each of
the 13 primary clades. In particular, the SCL14 clade has under-
gone extensive independent lineage-specific expansions in each of
the plant clades considered in our analysis.

2.3 Functional inference for the GRAS family based on
the methyltransferase domain

The proﬁle—proﬁle comparisons indicated that the GRAS
domain is closest to various N- and O-methylases of small mol-
ecules, such as those modifying histamine, rebeccamycin sugar
moiety, phosphoethanolamine, ubiquinone and trans-aconitate,
as opposed to known nucleic acid and protein methylases
(Aravind et al., 2011; Horton et al., 2005; Iyer et al., 2011).
This suggests that bacterial and a subset of plant GRAS proteins
could also be small-molecule methylases. Importantly, they share
with certain small-molecule methylases the presence of the ‘cap--
like’ structure formed by the N-terminal extension and the
a-helical inserts between strand-5 and strand-6. This is consistent
with the bacterial versions from Runella slithyformis being
encoded in predicted operons with genes coding for enzymes
that operate on small molecules (a small-molecule phosphotries-
terase and aminotransferase superfamily protein) (Fig. 1C). The
substitution in key SAM-interacting residues of the methyltrans-
ferase domain in majority of the plant versions suggests that
there was a functional shift after the transfer of the ancestral
GRAS gene from bacteria to plants. Nevertheless, conservation
of the predicted target substrate-binding site (as opposed to the
SAM-binding site) suggests that they might interact with similar
ligands.

As many plant members of the GRAS family have been re-
ported to function as nuclear proteins affecting transcriptional
responses, it is plausible that they bind particular covalent modi-
fications on chromatin proteins. However, this appears less likely

due to number of reasons. First, GRAS proteins do not display
any of the multidomain architectures typical of chromatin pro-
teins. Second, the majority of characterized members show a
strong association with GA signaling, and the genetic and mo-
lecular evidence shows that they function both as positive and
negative regulators in this signaling system. This dedicated cou-
pling with GA signaling is again not consistent with a general
role of binding a chromatin protein modification. Similarly, dif-
ferent functionally characterized plant GRAS proteins appear to
be associated with both repressive and active chromatin modifi-
cations; this is not entirely consistent with the prediction of simi-
lar ligand-binding properties across the family. Given that the
strong common denominator for the GRAS proteins is the link
with GA signaling, it is possible that they actually bind GAs
themselves or GA derivatives. GRAS proteins have not been
implicated as GA receptors and a known GA receptor is the
05/,8 hydrolase domain protein GIDl. However, the previous
erroneous reports on the affinities of the GRAS proteins have
resulted in them being labeled as transcription factors despite
the lack of any evidence from sequence analysis to support
such a contention. This appears to have biased their analysis
with most studies attempting to interpret all aspects of their
function in terms of them being transcription factors. Hence,
we suspect that the alternative hypothesis of them being binders
of GAs or GA-derivatives has not been seriously pursued. Given
that there are many GA molecules in plants, including multiple
bioactive forms, and methylated, oxidized and hydroxylated ones
which are supposed to be inactive or have negative effects on GA
signaling, it is possible that all the GA-binding factors have not
be exhausted. Thus, at least a subset of the GRAS proteins might
modify GAs or their derivatives by methylation or represent al-
ternate binders of these molecules. In particular, it would be of
interest to investigate if some of them might bind the methylated
inactive ester derivatives of GAs.

3 CONCLUSION

In this work, we falsify the previously published relationships
that were proposed for the GRAS domain and highlight the
presence of bacterial versions. We show that the GRAS
domain contains a version of the Rossmann fold methyltransfer-
ase, which is likely to bind or modify GA or derivative molecules.
The evolutionary history of the GRAS family parallels that of
the GIDl-like 05/,8 hydrolases, which also appear to have been
horizontally transferred from bacteria to plants close to the
origin of land plants. In a more general sense, these findings
are in line with our recent studies that suggest that several com-
ponents of eukaryotic regulatory systems have their ultimate ori-
gins in bacterial small-molecule metabolism systems which have
been repeatedly acquired by eukaryotes at different points in
their evolutionary history (Aravind et al., 2012). Importantly,
our finding provide a new way of looking at this group of
plant regulatory proteins that have been often described as
being at the heart of the ‘Green revolution’.

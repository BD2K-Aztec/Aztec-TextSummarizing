ABSTRACT

Motivation: Stochasticity is an indispensable aspect of biochemical
processes at the cellular level. Studies on how the noise enters and
propagates in biochemical systems provided us with non-trivial in-
sights into the origins of stochasticity, in total, however, they constitute
a patchwork of different theoretical analyses.

Results: Here we present a flexible and widely applicable noise de-
composition tool that allows us to calculate contributions of individual
reactions to the total variability of a system’s output. With the package
it is, therefore, possible to quantify how the noise enters and propa-
gates in biochemical systems. We also demonstrate and exemplify
using the JAK—STAT signalling pathway that the noise contributions
resulting from individual reactions can be inferred from data experi-
mental data along with Bayesian parameter inference. The method is
based on the linear noise approximation, which is assumed to provide
a reasonable representation of analyzed systems.

1 INTRODUCTION

The question which molecular species or parts of a network con-
tribute most of the variability of a system or are responsible for
most of the information loss has attracted much attention in
recent years. Numerous studies have analyzed noise in signalling
networks in detail and decomposed the noise into contributions
attributable to ﬂuctuations in messenger RNA and protein.
Current software implementations offer a broad range of sto-
chastic modeling methods to analyze stochastic properties of
biochemical dynamics (Andrews et al., 2010; Thomas et al.,
2012). These tools, however, focus only indirectly on origins
and propagation of stochasticity. To our knowledge, a software
package to provide decomposition of noise into individual
sources has been lacking. Recently, we developed (Komorowski
et al., 2013) a ﬂexible and simple method to analyze how the

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed

structure of biochemical networks gives rise to noise in its out-
puts. In principle, this allows us to efﬁciently calculate the
contribution each reaction makes to the variability in all concen-
trations for any network, which can be modelled within the linear
noise approximation (LNA) framework. Origins of variability
can he therefore assigned to individual reactions and arbitrarily
defined network components.

Moreover, if experimental data are available and a posterior of
model parameters can be generated, the contribution of individ-
ual reactions can be estimated from data along with the param-
eters. Later in the text we provide a general description of the
package. Details are presented in the Supplementary
Information, which includes theoretical foundations of the
method, user manual and examples. In a comprehensive analysis
of the JAK-STAT signalling pathway, we infer individual con-
tributions from experimental data published in Swameye et al.
(2003).

2 METHODS

The LNA was used to model stochastic chemical kinetics (van Kampen,
2007, Komorowski 2009). In the LNA the covariance 2, a matrix quan-
tifying the noise in every network component is represented in form of the
deterministic ordinary differential equations (ODEs) (see Supplementary
Material for details)

d2

E = A(t)2 + 2A(t)T + 0(1) (1)
Because (1) is linear in 2, and D decomposes into a sum across reactions,
2 likewise decomposes into a sum across reactions (Komorowski et al.,
2013)

2 = 2(1) +  + 20‘) (2)

where r denotes the number of reactions in the system. From a speciﬁ-
cation of the network, we calculate the response matrix A, which de-
scribes how the network state instantaneously responds to ﬂuctuations,
and the dissipation matrix D, which describes the contribution of count
noise. This enables us to identify the origins of cell-to-cell variability in
dynamical biochemical systems and pinpoint, if warranted, individual
reactions.

2.1 Implementation

The package is implemented as a set of Matlab functions. To be analyzed,
model needs to be deﬁned in terms of a stoichiometry matrix, a Matlab
function containing reaction rates and a vector of parameter values.

A function that generates this deﬁnition ﬁles from an Systems Biology
Markup Language (SBML) ﬁle is provided. The deﬁnition ﬁles are used
to generated a set of ODEs using the Matlab symbolic toolbox.
Equations are then solved using the Matlab ODE solver, and solutions
provide the variance decomposition. Functions to providing graphical
output are also implemented.

2.2 Applicability

The package assumes that the LNA is a reasonable approximation of
modelled systems. Generally, this is the case if the number of each of the
interacting reacting molecules is large and the system is monostable.
Detailed discussions on the validity of the LNA are presented in
Ramaswamy et al. (2012) and Wallace et al. (2012). Accounting for
this limitation, the tool allows us to take any modelled network and
efﬁciently calculate the contribution each reaction makes to the variabil-
ity in all concentrations, speciﬁcally (i) symbolically generate ODEs
describing the system and individual reaction contributions, (ii) numeric-
ally compute variance decomposition and visualize obtained results and
(iii) infer contributions of individual reactions from experimental data if
posterior distribution is provided. The ﬂow chart describing input—output
relationship of the package is presented in Figure 1.

2.3 Biological relevance

Using experimental data of Swameye et al. (2003), we inferred the sources
of variability in the JAK-STAT signalling pathway. First, we used the

Fig. 1. Input-output ﬂow chart of the StochDecomp package. The stoi-
chiometry matrix, reaction rates and initial parameter guesses, which
deﬁne the stochastic model, are translated by means of the symbolic
computations into the set of deterministic ODEs (see Supplementary
Material for details). Conversion from SBML is also implemented.
Stored ODEs are then used to numerically analyze the stochastic
model, particularly decompose the variability into contributions resulting
from each of the model reactions either in steady-state or out-of-steady-
state. Though not explicitly stated, the covariance matrix 2 and contri-
butions 2w depend on the parameter vector 0. Therefore, if experimental
data together with parameter posterior are available, individual contri-
butions can be inferred along with the parameters

Prediction Uncertainty Analysis (PUA) Matlab package Wanlier et al.,
2012) to generate posterior distribution of model parameters as described
in Vanlier et al. (2012). Second, the parameter posterior was translated by
our package into a posterior of noise contributions. The tool revealed the
following insight about variability in the nuclear concentration of STAT
complexes, which is a factor activating a downstream response: (i) in the
absence of extrinsic noise, the ﬂuctuations in the number of nuclear
complexes originate largely from trafﬁcking of the complexes into the
nucleus. (ii) In the presence of the extrinsic noise, understood as ﬂuctu-
ations in Epo concentration, the network acts as a low pass ﬁlter. The
extrinsic noise is major source of variability if the ﬂuctuations in Epo
concentration are slow. (iii) The overall variability of the nuclear concen-
tration of STAT complexes is relatively insensitive to parameters.
Contributions of certain reactions, however, are sensitive and change
by an order of magnitudes for the parameters within the posterior (see
Supplementary Material for details).

3 DISCUSSION

StochDecomp is a novel computationally efﬁcient and integra-
tive Matlab package for computational analysis of noise origin in
the stochastic models of biochemical reactions. The ability to
dissect noise propagation through biological systems does
enable to better understand the role of noise in function and
evolution, and will also help synthetic biologists to either harness
or dampen the effects of noise in molecular signalling and
response networks.

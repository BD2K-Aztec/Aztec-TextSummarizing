Abstract

Motivation: The sensitivity of de novo short linear motif (SLiM) prediction is limited by the number
of patterns (the motif space) being assessed for enrichment. QSLiMFinder uses specific query pro—
tein information to restrict the motif space and thereby increase the sensitivity and specificity of
predictions.

Results: QSLiMFinder was extensively benchmarked using known SLiM—containing proteins and
simulated protein interaction datasets of real human proteins. Exploiting prior knowledge of a
query protein likely to be involved in a SLiM—mediated interaction increased the proportion of true
positives correctly returned and reduced the proportion of datasets returning a false positive pre—
diction. The biggest improvement was seen if a short region of the query protein flanking the inter—
action site was known.

1 Introduction

All biological processes are underpinned by protein—protein inter—
actions (PPI). To understand the ‘interactome’, we must know how
PPI are regulated in time and space to produce biological functions
(Tuncbag et 61]., 2009). An emerging field of biology is the study of
the role in PPI networks of intrinsically disordered protein regions
(Babu et 61]., 2011; Tompa, 2011), which lack a stable (unbound)
three—dimensional structure. Of particular interest, short linear
motifs (SLiMs) mediate an important subset of the cell’s disordered
PPI via domain-motif interactions (Neduva and Russell, 2005 ;
Pancsa and Fuxreiter, 2012; Russell and Gibson, 2008). SLiMs are
typically 2—15 amino acids in length with fewer than six (and as few
as two) functionally specific residues (Davey et 61]., 2012a). SLiMs
are involved in an incredibly diverse range of biological processes,
including cell cycle, cell signalling, post—translational modification,

subcellular localization, gene expression, membrane binding, pro-
tein folding, cell adhesion and cell death, with over 200 annotated
classes (Dinkel et 61]., 2014). SLiMs usually bind with low affinity,
making them ideal for quick or transient responses, and are likely to
be particularly enriched in signalling pathways (Diella et 61]., 2008).
The small protein sequence signature of SLiMs, combined with
their low affinity PPI, makes experimental discovery difficult.
Considerable attention has therefore been given to computational
methods for SLiM prediction (Davey et 61]., 2010a; Edwards and
Palopoli, 2015). These same features confer evolutionary plasticity
0n SLiM—mediated PPI and enable high functional density, which is
frequently exploited by pathogens to hijack host cellular processes
(Davey et 61]., 2011). Convergent (i.e. independent) evolution is also
prevalent within species. Consequently, identifying over—represented
motifs by explicitly modelling convergent evolution is among the
most successful approaches for de novo prediction of SLiMs from

protein sequences and PPI data (Davey et 61]., 2006, 2010a, 2010c;
Edwards et 61]., 2007, 2012; Neduva and Russell, 2005, 2006). Of
these, SLiMFinder was the first to introduce a robust (if slightly con—
servative) statistical model for de novo SLiM prediction that ac—
counted for both the evolutionary relationships within the data (i.e.
shared motifs due to homology) and the size of the motif space being
search (i.e. the number of patterns being assessed for enrichment)
(Davey et 61]., 2010b; Edwards et 61]., 2007).

The SLiMChance statistical model gives very high specificity pre—
dictions on benchmarking data (Edwards et 61]., 2007), making it suit—
able for large—scale analyses (Edwards et 61]., 2012). However, the
specificity of SLiMChance is achieved at the expense of prediction
sensitivity because the number of patterns being assessed—the motif
space—is typically very large. Even without undefined positions, there
are 20L possible patterns for a SLiM of length L, which demands a
large multiple testing correction on enrichment statistics.

A second limitation of searching for over-representation in PPI
datasets derives from the nature of the interactome itself. The search
strategy makes the implicit assumption that any observed over—
representation is causally linked to the reason for assembling that
dataset, e.g. analysing proteins with a common interaction partner, as-
sumes over-representation due to an interaction between that partner
and the enriched motif. In reality, motifs can be enriched due to over—
lapping sets of shared PPI and/or proteome—wide motif enrichment
(Edwards et 61]., 2012). Analysing a whole interactome by correlating
motif presence/absence with PPI partners might offset this issue to
some extent. FIRE—pro, for example, uses mutual information and net—
work randomizations to identify SLiMs associated with PPI partners
or biological processes/functions (Lieber et 61]., 2010). However, these
approaches need to analyse full interactomes, making them computa—
tionally challenging and unable to fully correct for protein homology.
Similarly, interactome—wide analyses and using random assemblies of
proteins can identify recurring motifs (Edwards et 61]., 2012) but are
not applicable to individual datasets of proteins.

Here, we present QSLiMFinder (‘Query’ SLiMFinder), which has
been developed as an extension of SLiMFinder to explicitly harness
additional information from interaction data in order to improve SLiM
prediction sensitivity and specificity. QSLiMFinder is designed to iden—
tify SLiMs shared between a specific ‘query’ protein (or segment
thereof) and a group of proteins that interact with the same PPI part—
ner. QSLiMFinder builds the motif space of putative SLiMs from the
query and then searches for enrichment in the remaining proteins. This
reduces the motif space and enables the search to be focused on a spe—
cific region for which high quality/confidence PPI information is avail-
able. For example, such regions could be derived or predicted from
solved structures of interacting proteins (Mosca et 61]., 2014; Stein and
Aloy, 2010) or binary PPI experiments, such as yeast two—hybrid frag—
ment libraries (Waaijers et 61]., 2013). Although improving all the time,
it is questionable whether current PPI data are of sufficient quality and
coverage for efficient SLiM discovery (Edwards et 61]., 2012).
Therefore, we present a comprehensive benchmark of QSLiMFinder
on carefully controlled protein datasets of known SLiMs from ELM
(Dinkel et 61]., 2012) and simulated PPI datasets of real human proteins.
Results show that QSLiMFinder can predict SLiMs with higher
sensitivity than SLiMFinder where specific PPI data are available.

2 Algorithm

2.1 The SLiMChance algorithm
The SLiMChance statistical model has been described (Edwards
et 61]., 2007) and expanded (Davey et 61]., 2010b) in previous

publications but it is useful to highlight key features here before ex—
plaining the alterations made by the QSLiMFinder algorithm.
SLiMChance uses multiple rounds of the cumulative binomial func—
tion, f(k+;n;p), which calculates the probability of observing [a or
more successes from n independent trials (with replacement), each
of which has a probability of success, p (Equation 1). When [a is 1,
this simplifies to Equation 2.

f(/e+;n;p) = 1 — 2:: (31911 — p)”‘i (1)

f(1+;n;p) = 1 — (1 — p)" (2)

SLiMChance uses three cycles of the binomial function in which
the probability calculated becomes P for the next calculation
(Table 1). First, confounding evolutionary relationships are removed
by grouping proteins through BLAST homology into ‘unrelated pro—
tein clusters’ (UPC), such that no protein in one UPC has BLAST-de-
tectable homology (E < 1e—4) with a protein in another UPC. For
each SLiM, the probability of occurrence in each UPC (as deter—
mined by masked amino acid frequencies) is used to calculate the
probability of the observed UPC support. The final SLiMChance
probability correction for each motif produces the significance esti—
mate Sig, which is dependent on the motif search space, M. M is
determined by SLiMBuild parameter settings (Edwards et 61]., 2007),
namely the number of defined positions, L, and the maximum wild-
card spacer length between defined positions, W (Equation 3). As
such, it is calculated independently for each length, L.

M = 20L(W + 1)L—1 (3)

Although SLiMChance is a heuristic estimation of significance
(due to the underlying assumptions of independence) it performs
very well on both benchmarking data (Edwards et 61]., 2007) and
real interaction data (Edwards et 61]., 2012). It has been shown to be
a slightly conservative metric, which helps reduce false positives
(FPs) but could miss some real motifs as a consequence (Davey
et 61]., 2010b; Edwards et 61]., 2007, 2012). (For this reason, the de—
fault cut—off for SLiMFinder is 0.1 rather than 0.05.)

2.2 Query SLiMFinder motif space correction
QSLiMFinder aims to improve search sensitivity by using prior
knowledge concerning one of the motif occurrences to reduce the
motif search space, M (Table 1). Under this model, a specific
‘Query’ protein (or region thereof) is defined on the basis of external
data suggesting that it contains the SLiM of interest. For the ELM
LIG_PCNA, for example, PDB (Berman et 61]., 2000) structure
1U76, which features a 15 amino acid peptide of POLD3 interacting
with PCNA (Bruning and Shamoo, 2004), could be used to define a
query for the PCNA interactome. QSLiMFinder then empirically
identifies all motifs within the specified query/region, as constrained
by the SLiMBuild parameter settings, to determine M. The query is
then removed from the search dataset along with any proteins
within the same UPC (Supplementary Fig. S1).

QSLiMFinder therefore represents a trade—off as it sacrifices one
of the clusters of unrelated proteins (11) and an occurrence of the
motif ([3), which increases the (uncorrected) probability of seeing the
motif over—represented by chance. In other words, QSLiMFinder ob—
serves k—l occurrences in 11—1 proteins, as opposed to SLiMFinder
observing [a occurrences in 11 proteins. The increase in sensitivity due
to reducing the motif space potentially greatly outweighs the deficit
produced by removing the query occurrence. For example,

SLiMFinder analysis of the human PCNA interactome returned a
LIG_PCNA variant, Q.[IL].FF, which was found in 7/74 UPC with a
motif space searched (M) of 4 320 000 four—position motifs (L :4;
W22; M2204 x 33) (Edwards et al., 2012). If POLD3 were used
as a query, this would become 6/73 UPC containing the motif but
the motif space would be reduced to the 1029 different four—position
motifs in POLD3. If the 15 amino acid peptide of POLD3 was used,
M would be reduced further to only 44 motifs. This represents a re—
duction in motif space of 3—5 orders of magnitude and a correspond—
ing increase in the significance of over—represented motifs.

3 Methods

QSLiMFinder was thoroughly benchmarked on datasets of known
motifs and compared with the unmodified SLiMFinder algorithm.

3.1 Reduced ELM definitions inferred from known
instances

The ELM database release used in this study (downloaded June 12,
2012) contains over 150 classes of manually annotated eukaryotic
SLiMs (Dinkel et al., 2012). Because of the manual curation of the
motifs, many of the motif definitions incorporate sequence specificity
information that is not found in known occurrences of the motif. This
information is vital for accurate prediction of novel instances of these
ELMs but it presents an unwelcome challenge for de novo SLiM pre—
diction benchmarking, as it is impossible for computational tools to
achieve the same level of specificity given the lack of information in
the input data. In a similar vein, manual curation can include rare
variants that prediction methods cannot be expected to recognize.
LIG_PCNA, for example, is defined as ((Ax{0,3})|(Q))x["FH\X/Y]
[ILM][AP][AFHILVWYP][DHFM][FMY]xx where ((Ax{0,3})|(Q))
represents ‘glutamine or up to three N—terminal residues’, [AP] repre—
sents ‘anything but proline’ and x represents ‘any amino acid’ (Dinkel
et al., 2012). Each of the non—phenylalanine variants in the last two
defined positions, however, occurs in only one LIG_PCNA occurrence
in the database (Fig. 1). Complex motif definitions also make it chal-
lenging to identify whether a prediction method is returning the cor—
rect motif from a given dataset; the more degenerate a regular
expression is, the more likely it is to get a match using CompariMotif
(Edwards et al., 2008) or manual comparisons.

To counter these issues, ELM motifs were redefined purely on
the basis of the known occurrences for each motif using SLiMMaker
(http://rest.slimsuite.unsw.edu.au/slimmaker). Occurrences were
aligned and each position taken in sequence and assessed for a ‘spe—
cificity signal’ (Fig. 1):

1. Each individual amino acid variant must occur in at least 3
different occurrences.

2. At least 75% of occurrences must have an amino acid that meets
requirement 1, otherwise the position was marked as a wildcard.

3. The maximum number of amino acids for each position was 5.
If 6—)— different amino acids each occurred in 3—1— sequences, the
position was marked as a wildcard.

For example, position 3 of the LIG_PCNA motif is defined in
ELM as [AFHWY]. Taken together, the 18 LIG_PCNA instances in
ELM have the following amino acid composition: 1K, 4R, 5S and
8T. Amino acids R, S and T each comply with 3—1— occurrences while
K has fewer than three occurrences and is ignored. The summed fre—
quency of R—l—S—l—T equals (4—1—5—1—8)/18:17/18. This exceeds the
0.75 cut—off and therefore position 3 is redefined as [RST], which is
a less degenerate version of [AFHWY]. In contrast, position 5 is
defined as ["P] and has amino acids: 1A, 3D, 2E, 2L, 2M, 1N, 2S,
3T and 2Y. Although D and T have 3—1— occurrences, position 5 is
not defined as [DT] because their summed frequency is only (3+3)/
1826/18, which does not exceed the 0.75 threshold. Therefore,
position 5 is returned as a wildcard.

Leading and trailing wildcards were removed but end of se—
quence characters for N—terminal (A) and C—terminal ($) positions
were included. Original ELM instances that did not match the
revised motif were removed and remaining instances subject to an—
other round of SLiMMaker motif definition using the same method.
This process was iterated until all retained instances matched the
redefined motif. The final ‘reduced’ ELM data are hereon referred to
as reduced ELM (ELMred) definitions and instances (Supplementary
Table S1).

3.2 ELM benchmarking data

ELM has been used to benchmark several motif prediction algo—
rithms (Davey et al., 2006. 2009, 2010c, 2012b; Edwards et al.,
2007; Neduva et al., 2005). Previous studies have limited bench—
marking to ELMs with 3—1— unrelated (non—homologous) motif in—
stances. Despite this, some ELMs had too much degeneracy and/or
too few instances to be rediscovered, even by a perfect algorithm.
Including such datasets in a comparative benchmarking study is
pointless as all methods will fail. Therefore, an additional restriction
was applied, limiting analysis to ELMred definitions with a normal-
ized information content (Edwards et al., 2008) equal or greater
than 2.0, an equivalent of having at least two fixed positions. In
total, there were 1968 instances belonging to 156 ELM classes, rep—
resenting 1284 unique proteins. 125 classes (1182 instances) were
retained following ELMred redefinition. Of these, 55 had 3—1— unre—
lated motif—containing proteins and were selected for benchmarking,
forming the ELM benchmarking (ELMBench) dataset (Fig. 2). To
control for possible artefacts due to differences between query pro—
teins, each protein in a given dataset was taken in turn and used as
the query (Supplementary Fig. S2).

3.3 Simulated and random benchmarking data

A second benchmarking dataset of simulated and random bench—
marking data (SimBench) was designed to more accurately reflect
the real FP rates of de novo SLiM discovery by using random human
proteins rather than proteins with known ELM instances. These
data consisted of simulated PPI datasets in which a known propor-
tion of any dataset contained a specific ELM motif that interacts
with the hypothetical interaction partner of the proteins. This was

used as a query. Each query is masked at six levels of resolution: (i) Full-length protein; (ii) 300 amino acid window, centred on motif where possible; (iii) 100

human proteins selected at random (without replacement) to make the final simulated datasets of different total sizes (TP><1, x2, x5, x10 and x20). As with
ELMBench, the SimBench queries are masked at same six different levels of site resolution

achieved by first searching a human protein dataset of 23 961 se—
quences constructed as outlined in Edwards et al. (2012) using
downloads from December 6, 2012 (Supplementary data). Searches
were performed using SLiMProb 1.2 [formerly SLiMSearch 1.x
(Davey et al., 2010)] and restricted to disordered regions [IUPred
(Dosztanyi et al., 2005) 2 0.2] masked according to relative local
conservation (Davey et al., 2009; Edwards et al., 2007) as described
in Edwards et al. (2012). The 76 ELMred with a normalized infor-
mation content (Edwards et al., 2008) 23.0 were taken in turn to
generate 10 replicates of ‘true positive’ (TP) simulated datasets
(Fig. 2b). For each dataset, a different query protein was selected
(with replacement) from the positive human proteome search re—
sults, while the rest of the ‘signal’ proteins (either 5 or 10, including
the query) were selected from unrelated proteome hits. Any motif
without sufficient unrelated ‘signal’ proteins in the human proteome
was excluded. Datasets were completed with ‘noise’ proteins se—
lected at random from the proteome irrespective of whether the
motif was found in the protein or not. Five different signal—to—noise
ratios were used: 1:0 (‘signal’ only), 1:1, 1:4, 1:9 and 1:19. Each of
the simulated datasets was paired with a ‘true negative’ random
dataset with the same query protein but in which all other proteins
were selected randomly from the proteome. In total, the analysis of
each ELM comprised up to 100 pairs of simulated datasets, gener—
ated from 10 replicates of 2 different ‘signal’ protein counts and 5
signal—to—noise ratios.

3.4 SLiM prediction

SLiM prediction was performed using both SLiMFinder 4.6 and
QSLiMFinder 1.7 with default settings. Where disorder masking
was applied, residues with an IUPred score <0.2 were masked
(Dosztanyi et al., 2005 ), with a minimum (dis)ordered region size of

5 amino acids. Conservation masking used settings and alignments
from Edwards et al. (2012).

3.5 Assessment of SLiM prediction
SLiM predictions were rated as TP, FP or off—target matches
(OT). This was achieved by comparing the patterns to the ELMred
definitions using CompariMotif 3.8 (Edwards et al., 2008).
Any CompariMotif hits matching at least two positions with a
MatchIC 2 1.5 (approximately equivalent to one fixed and one 3—
fold degenerate position, or a pair of 2—fold degenerate positions)
and a normalized IC 2 0.5 (i.e. at least half the smallest motif
is matched) were classed as motif matches. Motif matches
were defined as TP if the ELM matched was the same as (or a
variant of) that used to construct the dataset. Remaining motif
matches were classed as OT if the pattern had been recognized
as a TP in a different dataset, or it matched an ELM with a more
stringent criteria of MatchIC 2 2.5 or NormIC 2 1.0 (e.g. the
smaller pattern being matched entirely at sites with fixed amino
acids or low degeneracy). The remaining patterns were classed
as FP.

Once each pattern had been rated, performance metrics were cal—
culated for relevant sets of data:

1. SN, the proportion of datasets returning a TP. (Positive datasets
only for SimBench.)

2. The proportion of datasets returning a FP (FPX). (Negative data—
sets only for SimBench.)

OT motifs were ignored for clarity. Calculating FPX with OT
reclassified as TP or FP did not qualitatively affect any of the results
presented (data not shown).

For ELMBench, the different numbers of queries for each ELM
was normalized by first calculating values for each ELM and then
taking the mean values across ELMs. SLiMFinder clusters motifs
with overlapping patterns and instances into ‘clouds’. All analysis in
this article used only the top—ranked motif in each cloud. Treating
each returned pattern independently did not qualitatively affect any
of the results presented (data not shown).

3.6 Flanking region analysis

To reﬂect different levels of prior knowledge, six different flanking
region strategies were applied to the ELM query sequences (Fig. 2)
to reduce the motif space (QSLiMFinder) or sequence search space
(SLiMFinder):

1. Full-length proteins (‘none’). This represents the lowest resolution
prior data where a speciﬁc PPI pair has been identiﬁed but the
interacting region is totally unknown.

2. 300 amino acid window, centred on the ELM instance
(‘win300’). Where the ELM instance was within 150 amino acid
of a protein end, the terminal 300 amino acid were used. This
represents slightly higher resolution data, e.g. where chimera
studies or yeast—two—hybrid fragment experiments have nar-
rowed the site of interaction down to a region of a protein.

3. 100 amino acid window, centred on the ELM instance
(‘win100’). The terminal 100 amino acid were used if ELM in—
stance was within 50 amino acid of a protein terminus.

4. 50 amino acid window, centred on the ELM instance (‘win50’).
The terminal 50 amino acid were used if ELM instance was
within 25 amino acid of a protein terminus.

5. Motif instance plus ﬁve ﬂanking amino acids in each direction
(‘ﬂank5’). This represents a typical SLiM ligand bound to its
binding domain where some of the ﬂanking residues are also im—
portant for speciﬁcity and binding even if they do not contribute
to the motif deﬁnition itself (Stein and Aloy, 2008).

6. The motif instance only (‘site’). This represents the highest quality
prior knowledge, where mutation experiments etc. have precisely
identiﬁed the key region.

3.7 Ambiguity in motif definition

SLiMBuild constructs ambiguous positions by combining different
fixed SLiM patterns according to an ‘equivalence file’ of permitted
ambiguities, provided that they extend dataset coverage (support)
versus the individual fixed patterns (Edwards et al., 2007). Because
QSLiMFinder builds the motif space from the query alone, it cannot
incorporate pattern variants found elsewhere in the data without
violating the SLiMChance model or inflating the motif space.
Therefore, unless otherwise specified, motif ambiguity was switched
off for both QSLiMFinder and SLiMFinder, even though the under—
lying ELMred definitions include ambiguity. Where ambiguity was
used, the following sets of equivalencies were used: [ILMVF],
[FYW], [FYH], [KRH], [DE], [ST].

4 Results

4.1 QSLiMFinder increases prediction sensitivity by
reducing motif search space

The main aim of QSLiMFinder is to increase the sensitivity of SLiM
discovery by using specific ‘query’ data to reduce the motif and
sequence search spaces. First, we investigated how well
QSLiMFinder returned known motifs from the ELMBench datasets
of known SLiM-containing proteins from the ELM database (Dinkel

Fig. 3. Comparison of QSLiMFinder (OSF, top rows) and SLiMFinder (SF, bottom rows) results for the ELMBench data after searching for true instances of an ELM
using a region containing the ELM plus five flanking residues at each side. For each dataset, indicated by its ELM name, the percentage of Queries returning the
TP motif at different significance cutoffs is shown. ELMred patterns below each ELM name were used to assess predictions for both QSLiMFinder and
SLiMFinder. Fill intensity represents the percentage of queries that return the TP motif according to the scale on the lower right. Disorder masking (IUPred 2 0.2)
was used for all analysis. ELMs for which neither method returned a TP prediction are not shown

et al., 2012). Because ELMs are manually defined and thus contain
specificity not necessarily found within the known instances them—
selves, ELMred definitions were used that should, in principle, be
possible to discover (normalized IC 2 2.0, 3—1— non—homologous
occurrences). Queries were restricted to the ELM instance plus five
ﬂanking residues on each side and proteins were masked to only
include regions predicted disorder (IUpred score 2 0.2 [Dosztanyi
et al., 2005]). Although ELMred definitions could include degenerate
positions, which could feature one of several different amino acids,
SLiM predictions were restricted to fixed position motifs only. Each
ELM—containing protein was selected in turn to be the query and the
percentage of datasets returning a match to the known ELM
(CompariMotif MatchIC 2 1.5, normalized IC 2 0.5 [Edwards
et al., 2008]) calculated for SLiMFinder and QSLiMFinder at differ-
ent SLiMChance significance levels.

SLiMFinder is known to be conservative (Davey et al., 2010b;
Edwards et al., 2007) and TP results with at least borderline signifi-
cance (P g 0.1) were returned for one or more queries for 28 of the
55 ELMred datasets (Fig. 3). As expected, QSLiMFinder demon-
strated greater SN and returned TPs at greater significance for 25 of
these ELMs, in addition to returning TPs (P g 0.1) for a further nine
ELMs. Given its reliance on the query data to generate the motif
space, it is not surprising that QSLiMFinder showed greater varia—
bility between queries in terms of whether the ELM was returned at
a given SLiMChance cut—off. SLiMFinder also demonstrated some
query—specific significance, which is likely to result from different
variants of ambiguous ELMred motifs in different queries.

ELMBench datasets are commonly used for SLiM prediction
benchmarking but are quite limited because (i) the number of ELMs
is restricted, and (ii) the realism of a dataset in which every protein
contains the SLiM is questionable for real world applications. We
therefore sought to generate a more extensive benchmarking data—
set, SimBench, which would more accurately reflect the nature of

real world protein datasets for SLiM prediction and neither rely on,
nor be unduly biased by, experimental data. For this, the 76 ELMred
patterns with a normalized information content 2 3.0 (equivalent of
3—1— fixed positions) were used to generate multiple datasets of real
human proteins with different numbers of proteins and a range of
signal—to—noise ratios, plus a matching number of control datasets of
randomly selected human proteins. Again, QSLiMFinder shows
greater SN than SLiMFinder, returning TP results for a greater pro—
portion of SimBench datasets (Fig. 4). As expected, the effect is most
pronounced when the query region is smallest, as this is when the
motif space is most dramatically reduced. For the sake of clarity
only those results obtained with the whole protein and the SLiM
region with and without flanking residues are displayed, but results
with windows of intermediate sizes lie in—between, as expected (data
not shown).

4.2 QSLiMFinder predictions maintain the high
specificity of SLiMFinder

The ability to successfully return known motifs is only one side of a
useful SLiM discovery tool. In real life, it is often not known
whether a SLiM is present in the data at all, and the statistics grant—
ing the ability to successfully avoid the return of FP predictions is
critical. (For this reason, we do not benchmark predictions based on
ranked scores, which are of limited use in real—world applications of
de novo SLiM prediction.) Consistent with previous analyses,
SLiMFinder is conservative and exhibits high specificity on
SimBench, with ~8% of random datasets returning a significant
motif at a relaxed significance threshold of P g 0.1 (Fig. 4).
Although QSLiMFinder does not have quite the same specificity
when the whole query protein is used, the improved SN is not
caused by over—prediction and the SLiMChance statistics are still
slightly conservative. Reducing the query region increases specificity

Proportion of deteeete returning FP (FPX)

Fig. 4. Comparison of (a) QSLiMFinder (QSF) and (b) SLiMFinder (SF) results on SimBench datasets after searching with fragments of the Query protein of
decreasing size. SN, the proportion of datasets returning a TP, is plotted against FPX, the proportion of datasets returning a FP, at different SLiMChance signifi-
cance cut-offs (0.1, 0.05, 0.01, 0.005, 0.001, 5e-04, 1 e-04). Searches were made with the whole protein (‘none’, circles), with a window of five residues flanking the
known ELM at each side (‘flank5', triangles) or with the region of the motif only (‘site', squares). For clarity, plots are truncated at the least significant cut-off for

which FPX = 0

as well as SN over SLiMFinder, giving a double benefit. This is to be
expected as the reduced motif space means that there are fewer pat—
terns that could be over—represented by chance. Although this should
be compensated by the reduced multiple testing correction, there are
clearly local sequence biases that result in certain patterns being
enriched by chance in real proteins (Edwards et al., 2012) and
reducing the chance of including these in the motif space is likely to

have added benefit.

4.3 Incorporating ambiguity in QSLiMFinder results in
over—prediction

Reducing the motif space to that of the query does not come without
cost. In addition to removing one of the TP instances, the ability to
incorporate ambiguity is compromised. SLiMBuild constructs
ambiguous positions by combining different fixed SLiM patterns
according to an ‘equivalence list’ of permitted ambiguities, provided
that they extend dataset coverage (support) versus the individual
fixed patterns. Because QSLiMFinder builds the motif space from
the query alone, it cannot incorporate pattern variants found else—
where in the data without violating the SLiMChance model.
Incorporating ambiguity in QSLiMFinder therefore results in over—
prediction and elevated FP rates, whilst SLiMFinder is less affected
(Fig. 5). However, ambiguity can be useful to providing a more
nuanced motif definition than fixed position motifs alone (Edwards
et al., 2007) and does give a marginal improvement in SN (Fig. 5a).
A possible workaround is to enable the return of ambiguous motifs
but exclude them as FPs unless a significant fixed position pattern is
returned in the same motif cloud (set of overlapping motifs
[Edwards et al., 2007]). This is provided as a new option
(cloudfix : T) in SLiMFinder and QSLiMFinder.

4.4 Sequence masking can further improve
QSLiMFinder sensitivity

It has been previously shown that general sequence masking can
improve the sensitivity and specificity of SLiMFinder by reducing

the sequence search space (Davey et al., 2009; Edwards et al.,
2007). Therefore, we sought to examine whether additional mask—
ing could further boost QSLiMFinder performance by comparing
different dataset masking strategies. SLiM prediction was executed
with both predicted disorder and relative local conservation mask—
ing (‘Bothmask’), disorder masking alone (‘Dismask’) or neither
(‘Nomask’). Masking was applied to the entire protein dataset
including the query.

In general, reducing the sequence space through sequence mask—
ing added to the query region benefits for QSLiMFinder SN (Fig. 6).
This is to be expected, as additional masking of the query will fur-
ther reduce the motif space, whilst overall masking of the dataset
will reduce the sequence space. The FP rate was also improved,
albeit by a smaller magnitude. The exception was for the site—spe—
cific query region masking, for which the Nomask strategy was
most successful (Fig. 6). This is because it is quite rare to return the
precise motif being sought and many TP matches incorporate an
additional ﬂanking or internal residue that is over—represented but
not part of the formal motif definition. This is particularly true
when fixed position variants of ambiguous motifs are being sought,
as in these analyses. Extremely stringent masking will eliminate the
possibility of such extended patterns being returned. For this reason,
unless the user is extremely confident about the precise location and
context of a SLiM, it is probably a good idea to include some ﬂank—
ing sequence. In real data, the utility of masking is not so clear—cut
as it cannot be guaranteed that the SLiM occurrences being sought
meet the masking criteria. However, where there is confidence that
the criteria are met, it can make a big difference. In other scenarios,
using QSLiMFinder with precise location data for the query can
reduce the need for additional sequence masking.

4.5 Prediction accuracy is highly dependent on the
signal—to—noise ratio of the data

Real protein datasets vary wildly in terms of the number of proteins
they contain (Edwards et al., 2012). In general, an unknown fraction

out disordered regions (‘Dismask', triangles) or (c) masking out both disordered and evolutionary conserved positions (‘Bothmask', circles). Results were
obtained with (a) the whole protein as the query, (b) with a window of five residues at each side of the known motif or (c) with the motif only. For clarity, plots are

truncated at the least significant cut-off for which FPX = 0

of these proteins will contain the SLiM being sought. The remaining
proteins are ‘noise’, which interact with the target protein via a dif—
ferent mechanism. The SimBench data were generated with two dif—
ferent TP counts (5 or 10 per dataset) and five different signal—to—
noise ratios to investigate the effects of data quality and quantity. As
expected, the composition of the dataset is highly relevant to deter—
mine the trade—off between sensitivity and specificity. Intuitively,
increasing the signal—to—noise ratio improves the sensitivity of pre—
diction for both SLiMFinder and QSLiMFinder (Fig. 7). At equal

signal—to—noise ratios, larger datasets also give a marked increase in
true motifs, indicating that the SLiMChance over—representation sta—
tistics become more sensitive as the number of occurrences increases,
which is not surprising given its foundation on the binomial distri-
bution. However, in line with previous results, increasing the dataset
size also increases the likelihood of a FP being returned (Edwards
et al., 2007, 2012). This is most likely due to the effects of small
local biases in amino acid composition being amplified as dataset
sizes increase.

5 Discussion

Query SLiMFinder (QSLiMFinder) is a modified version of
SLiMFinder that makes use of a specific query protein (or region
thereof) to reduce the motif search space. By reducing the corre—
sponding multiple testing correction, QSLiMFinder can increase the
sensitivity of de novo SLiM prediction (Fig. 4). By reducing the num-
ber of motifs that could be susceptible to sequence biases within the
data, QSLiMFinder also reduces the number of datasets returning
FP predictions (Fig. 4). Intuitively, the more precisely the query
sequence can be restricted to the site of the interaction, the smaller
the motif space is and the larger the benefit provided by
QSLiMFinder. Furthermore, the explicit use of a specific PPI pair
will make subsequent interpretation and validation easier.

Despite these benefits, there are scenarios in which SLiMFinder
remains the more appropriate choice, even when specific PPI data
are available. QSLiMFinder reduces the motif space by sacrificing
an occurrence of the motif. For small datasets, SLiMFinder is more
likely to cope with the limited number of motif occurrences that will
challenge the sensitivity of SLiMChance. Furthermore,
QSLiMFinder cannot handle ambiguity as well as SLiMFinder (Fig.
5). Because the benefits of QSLiMFinder are small when full-length
queries are used, it might be more appropriate to use SLiMFinder in
these cases unless the query protein is itself very short. Overall, the
results of our analysis point to different applications for SLiMFinder
and QSLiMFinder, with the latter best—suited to exploit specific
information about interaction sites.

In this article, we also introduce SLiMBench, a combination of
carefully formulated benchmarking datasets and a rule—based auto—
mated benchmarking tool for consistent, repeatable comparison of
de novo SLiM prediction methods. The design and scale of these
data have provided additional insights regarding dataset design with
respect to signal—to—noise. Prediction SN (TP rate) is primarily influ-
enced by the number of proteins in the dataset containing the motif,
whereas specificity (FP rate) is predominantly inﬂuenced by overall
dataset size (Fig. 7). Due to the stringency of the SLiMChance

statistics underpinning SLiMFinder and QSLiMFinder, both pro-
grams are more tolerant of increased noise than reduced signal, con—
sistent with previous results (Edwards et al., 2007, 2012).
Therefore, an interesting dilemma may arise when building a new
search dataset, between seeking a better signal—to—noise ratio to
enhance sensitivity and increasing dataset size for extended motif
coverage. Maximizing the signal—to—noise ratio of protein datasets
will hopefully maximize the accuracy of predictions but extra cau—
tion should be taken when removing unfavourable proteins and/or
masking sequences, lest motif instances are accidentally removed.
On the other hand, if high precision (i.e. a low FP rate) is critical,
bloating the dataset with uninteresting sequences should be avoided.
The next step will be to apply these principles to real PPI data.

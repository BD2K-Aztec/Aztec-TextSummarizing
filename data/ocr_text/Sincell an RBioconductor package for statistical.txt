Abstract

Summary: Cell differentiation processes are achieved through a continuum of hierarchical inter-
mediate cell states that might be captured by single-cell RNA seq. Existing computational
approaches for the assessment of cell-state hierarchies from single-cell data can be formalized
under a general framework composed of (i) a metric to assess cell-to-cell similarities (with or with-
out a dimensionality reduction step) and (ii) a graph-building algorithm (optionally making use of a
cell clustering step). The Since/l R package implements a methodological toolbox allowing flexible
workflows under such a framework. Furthermore, Since/l contributes new algorithms to provide
cell-state hierarchies with statistical support while accounting for stochastic factors in single-cell
RNA seq. Graphical representations and functional association tests are provided to interpret hier-
archies. The functionalities of Since/l are illustrated in a real case study, which demonstrates its
ability to discriminate noisy from stable cell-state hierarchies.

Availability and implementation: Since/l is an open-source R/Bioconductor package available at
http://bioconductor.org/packages/sincelI. A detailed manual and a vignette are provided with the

 

package.

1 Introduction

Unbiased profiling of individual cells through single-cell RNA-seq
allows assessing heterogeneity of transcriptional states within a cell
population (Wu et al., 2014). In the context of a cell population’s
differentiation or activation process, such transcriptional heterogen-
eity might reﬂect a continuum of intermediate cell states and lin-
eages resulting from dynamic regulatory programs. Such a
continuum might be captured through the assessment of cell-state
hierarchies, where each cell is placed in a relative ordering in the
transcriptional landscape. Additionally, statistical support should be
provided to discriminate reliable hierarchies from stochastic hetero-
geneity, arising from both technical and biological factors.

A number of algorithms have been used to assess cell-state hier-
archies from single-cell data (Amir et al., 2013; Bendall et al.,
2014; Buettner et al., 2015; Jaitin et al., 2014; Moignard et al.,
2015; Qiu et al., 2011; Trapnell et al., 2014). These approaches
can be formalized under a general framework (Supplementary
Table 51). Here we present Sincell, an R/Bioconductor package
where the various building blocks of that general workflow are ex-
tended and combined (Fig. 1). Notably, Sincell implements algo-
rithms to provide statistical support to the cell-state hierarchies
derived from single-cell RNA-seq. The package is complemented
with graphical representations and functional association tests to
help interpret the results.

2 Description

As input, Sincell requires an expression matrix with user-defined
normalized gene expression levels per single cell (Fig. 1). Variance
stabilization is recommended (e.g. through log transformation).
First, a cell-to-cell distance matrix is calculated using a metric of
choice. Sincell provides both linear and non-linear distances:
Euclidean, Mutual Information, L1 distance, Pearson and Spearman
correlation. Optionally, the distance matrix may be obtained from
the leading dimensions of a data reduction technique, performed to
keep the most informative parts of the data while excluding noise.
Both linear and non-linear algorithms are provided: Principal
Component Analysis, Independent Component Analysis, t-
Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding and non-metric
Multidimensional Scaling.

Second, a cell-state hierarchy is obtained by applying a graph-
building algorithm on the cell-to-cell distance matrix. Graph-build-
ing algorithms may consider cells both individually and in clusters
of highly similar cells. Sincell provides different clustering methods
(K-Mutual Nearest Neighbors, k-medoids, agglomerative clustering,
etc.) and graph-building algorithms (MST, SST and IMC;
Supplementary Text).

Stochastic technical and biological factors may drive cell-state
heterogeneity observed in single-cell RNA seq data. Additionally,
hierarchies derived from experiments with a low number of individ-
ual cells (e.g. 96 cells when using a Fluidigm C1TM Single-Cell Auto
Prep System) are more susceptible to noise artifacts than experi-
ments profiling thousands of individual cells (e.g. flow cytometry
data). Sincell implements two algorithms to discriminate reliable
hierarchies from noise-driven ones. The first strategy relies on a gene
resampling procedure. The second one is based on random cell sub-
stitution with in silico-generated cell replicates. These replicates are
built by perturbing observed gene expression levels with random

noise, following patterns of stochasticity observed in single-cell
RNA-seq (Supplementary Text). Either approach generates a popu-
lation of hierarchies whose similarities to the reference show the dis-
tribution of the hierarchy stability against changes in the data.

To help interpret hierarchies in functional terms, Sincell provides
graphical representations of cell-to-cell similarities in low-dimen-
sional space as well as different graph displays of hierarchies, color-
ing cells, e.g. by expression levels of a marker of choice.
Furthermore, Sincell implements an algorithm to determine the stat-
istical significance of the association of the hierarchy with the ex-
pression levels of a given gene set (Supplementary Text). Gene set
collections (e.g. Gene Ontology terms) can be systematically
evaluated.

3 Application

The Sincell R package includes a detailed vignette illustrating all
functionalities using real single-cell RNA-seq data. We use data
from (Trapnell et al., 2014) quantifying gene expression levels in dif-
ferentiating myoblast at 0, 24, 48 and 72 h. Here, we analyze each
time-point separately and evaluate the statistical evidence of cell-
state heterogeneity within them (Supplementary Fig. 1). Our results
show that early differentiation timepoints produce unstable hierar-
chies suggesting a low level of cell-state heterogeneity. However,
late differentiation timepoints produce statistically significant hier-
archies that reflect cell-state diversity along the differentiation pro-
cess (Supplementary Text).

4 Discussion

The landscape of computational approaches to assess cell-state hier-
archies from single-cell data is far from being fully explored. The di-
versity of biological studies and rapid evolution of single-cell
technologies require a comprehensive toolbox where users may eas-
ily tailor workflows and compare alternative methods and assump-
tions. Furthermore, cell-state hierarchies should be statistically
supported before being used as input in subsequent analyses. The
Sincell R package addresses these needs by providing a general ana-
lysis framework, new algorithms for statistical support as well as
tools for functional interpretation of cell-state hierarchies.

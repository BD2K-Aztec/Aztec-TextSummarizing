ABSTRACT

Motivation: Next-generation sequencing technology enables an
entirely new perspective for clinical research and will speed up
personalized medicine. In contrast to microarray-based approaches,
RNA-Seq analysis provides a much more comprehensive and
unbiased view of gene expression. Although the perspective
is clear and the long-term success of this new technology
obvious, bioinformatics resources making these data easily available
especially to the biomedical research community are still evolving.
Results: We have generated RNA-Seq Atlas, a web-based
repository of RNA-Seq gene expression profiles and query tools. The
website offers open and easy access to RNA-Seq gene expression
profiles and tools to both compare tissues and find genes with
specific expression patterns. To enlarge the scope of the RNA-
Seq Atlas, the data were linked to common functional and genetic
databases, in particular offering information on the respective gene,
signaling pathway analysis and evaluation of biological functions by
means of gene ontologies. Additionally, data were linked to several
microarray gene profiles, including BioGPS normal tissue profiles and
NCI60 cancer cell line expression data. Our data search interface
allows an integrative detailed comparison between our RNA-Seq
data and the microarray information. This is the first database
providing data mining tools and open access to large scale RNA-
Seq expression profiles. Its applications will be versatile, as it will be
beneficial in identifying tissue specific genes and expression profiles,
comparison of gene expression profiles among diverse tissues, but
also systems biology approaches linking tissue function to gene
expression changes.

1 INTRODUCTION

Over the next years, the availability of next-generation sequencing
(NGS) data will offer an entirely new perspective for clinical

research and help usher in personalized medicine. So far, several
databases offer storage or download of NGS data (Altshuler, 2010;
Shumway et al., 2010). However, to access the valuable information
of this promising new technique, the user has to manually download
the data and be familiar with their analysis to extract the valuable
information. This is currently not the case for most biomedical
researchers. We therefore created the RNA-Seq Atlas, a database and
user interface (UI) providing easy access to NGS data. Currently,
RNA-Seq Atlas holds gene expression proﬁles on eleven human,
healthy tissues and can be accessed over an intuitive web interface.
To further increase the utility of the RNA-Seq Atlas, the data were
linked to multiple microarray gene proﬁles representing normal and
pathological states. Furthermore, various query tools were designed
to offer a great variability of individual analysis.

2 DATABASE ORGANIZATION AND ACCESS

2.1 Data sources

The provided genome-wide expression compendium originates
from eleven healthy, human tissue samples pooled from multiple
donors spanning 32384 speciﬁc transcripts corresponding to
21 399 unique genes (Castle et al., 2010) (ENA ERP000257;
ArrayExpress E—MTAB-305). The tissues include adipose, colon,
heart, hypothalamus, kidney, liver, lung, ovary, skeletal muscle,
spleen and testes. Sequencing was performed on an Illumina GA—II
sequencer, generating an average of 50 million reads per tissue, with
sequence reads of 36 or 50 nt depending on tissue. The expression
level were estimated by mapping and counting reads to single gene
sequences derived from the UCSC genome browser, followed by
normalization to Reads Per Kilobase of exon model per Million
mapped reads values (MortazaVi et al., 2008).

Moreover, to enable an integrative comparison between RNA-
Seq and microarray expression proﬁles we integrated a panel of
84 microarrays from BioGPS (Su et al., 2004; Wu et al., 2009),
Normal Tissue Gene Expression Study (Ge et al., 2005) as well
as (Ross et al., 2000; Shankavaram et al., 2009) NCI60 into the
RNA-Seq Atlas. These gene expression proﬁles correspond to the
equivalent tissues included in the RNA-Seq Atlas and involve
>39 000 transcripts from pathological (i.e. cancer) and normal
tissues states. Detailed information about data processing and
integration can be found in the Supplementary Materials S1 and S2.

Further, the RNA-Seq Atlas was linked to commonly used and
established bioinformatics databases and knowledge repositories.
Enabling access to deeper transcriptional information was achieved

RNA-Seq Atlas

 

by linking the RNA-Seq Atlas data to the NCBI Nucleotide database
(Sayers et al., 2011). Also, information on corresponding gene
symbol, aliases, description, chromosomal location, Entrez ID as
well as EnsEMBL ID were assembled from the NCBI Entrez and
EnsEMBL databases (Sayers et al., 2011; Spudich et al., 2007).
Additional outgoing links to HGNC (Seal et al., 2011), HPRD
(Keshava Prasad et al., 2009), OMIM (McKusick, 2007), BioGPS
(Wu et al., 2009), Nextbio (Kupershmidt et al.) and GENT (Shin
et al., 2011) were supported. Finally, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of
Genes and Genomes (KEGG) (Aoki and Kanehisa, 2005) was
accessed to identify gene signaling as well as molecular pathway
afﬁliations; and data on cellular component, biological process and
molecular function were collected from the Gene Ontology database
(Ashburner et al., 2000). Finally, the RNA-Seq Atlas was cross-
linked to our liver-speciﬁc databases LoMA (Buchkremer et al.,
2010).

2.2 Data organization and web interface

RNA-Seq Atlas is implemented within a Drupal content
management system environment over a Linux-PostgreSQL—
Apache-PHP stack. The database organization is founded upon a
menu which allows access to the news, data, search and download
sections.

The news section keeps users up to date about recent changes and
current statistics, whereas the download section give the possibility
to download the RNA-Seq Atlas in tab separated text ﬁle format.
RNA-Seq atlas can be accessed through simple (data section) or
advanced (search section) query forms. The advanced query offers
four detailed options:

(1) Full text search.

(2) Comparison of speciﬁc tissues proﬁles; also allowing
for comparative analysis not only between normal tissue
information but also to NCI60 data and thus between normal
and tumor tissues.

(3) Explore common (and diverse) gene expression proﬁles
between tissues.

(4) Explore pathway proﬁle; e. g. selecting one or multiple KEGG
pathway resulting in a list of involved genes.

Finally, a ‘details’ link provides additional information including:
gene symbol, description, aliases, chromosomal location, Entrez
ID, Ensembl ID, Gene Ontology, KEGG pathway as well as the
expression proﬁle within the normal human tissues and cancer
cell lines.

2.3 Future directions

Future directions include an incorporation of more data from
healthy and cancer tissue to provide a richer source of comparative
transcriptomics and implementation of a Gene Set Enrichment
Analysis (GSEA) analysis engine within the RNA-Seq Atlas.

3 CONCLUSION

In this work, we present RNA-Seq Atlas, an easily accessible
database and UI, offering access to NGS gene expression proﬁles.
Furthermore, to enhance the bioinformatics integration, the data
is linked to a wide variety of commonly used and established
databases and knowledge repositories. To further enlarge the very
broad scope of RNA-Seq Atlas and to facilitate the analysis of
gene expression proﬁles of several pathological conditions, the data
were linked to cancer cell line expression proﬁles. Finally, the
implementation of a wide variety of querying tools allows the user
to start individual analysis, enabling for both bioinformaticians and
experimental researchers.

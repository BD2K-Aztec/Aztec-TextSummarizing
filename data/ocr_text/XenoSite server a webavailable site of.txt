Abstract

Summary: Cytochrome P450 enzymes (P450s) are metabolic enzymes that process the majority of
FDA—approved, small—molecule drugs. Understanding how these enzymes modify molecule struc—
ture is key to the development of safe, effective drugs. XenoSite server is an online implementation
of the XenoSite, a recently published computational model for P450 metabolism. XenoSite predicts
which atomic sites of a molecule—sites of metabolism (SOMs)—are modified by P450s. XenoSite
server accepts input in common chemical file formats including SDF and SMILES and provides
tools for visualizing the likelihood that each atomic site is a site of metabolism for a variety of
important P450s, as well as a flat file download of SOM predictions.

Availability and implementation: XenoSite server is available at http://swami.wustl.edu/xenosite.

1 Introduction

Cytochrome P450 enzymes (P450s) are a family of heme—thiolated
enzymes that catalyze a variety of oxidation reactions. They oxida—
tively metabolize the majority of FDA—approved, small—molecule
drugs (Nebert and Russell, 2002). P45 0s metabolize individual mol-
ecules at specific atoms: sites of metabolism (SOMs). The specific
SOMs associated with a molecule’s P45 0 metabolism are important
to know because they affect its bioavailability, efficacy and toxicity.
For example, acetominophen is metabolized by P45 0s at a specific
site into NAPQI, which is toxic to hepatocytes, which can acute liver
failure in some patients. Accurately predicting these SOMs enables
medicinal chemists to modify molecule to avoid toxic metabolites
and maximize bioavailability.

There are in vitro assays capable of determining a molecule’s
SOMs, but computational methods for predicting SOMs are
quicker, less expensive and frequently used in drug development. In
addition to commercial software packages for predicting SOMs,
there are at least two software packages produced by academic
groups, RS predictor and SMARTCyp (Rydberg et 61]., 2010;
Zaretzki et 61]., 2012). Recently, we reported a new method for pre—
dicting P450 SOMs, XenoSite, that is more accurate than other

approaches (Zaretzki et 61]., 2013). This article reports a public web
server that makes XenoSite available to predict the SOMs of user—
submitted molecules.

XenoSite is a machine—learning approach to modeling P45 0 me—
tabolism. Using a neural network, XenoSite models are trained on
the largest set of publicly available P45 0 metabolism data consisting
of over 680 compounds annotated with SOMs for the P450 iso—
zymes 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4, as well
as human liver microsomes (HLM), which combines the individual
P45 0 models to represent the expected metabolism of compounds
in vivo. In cross—validation experiments, XenoSite identifies experi-
mentally observed SOMs within the top two rank positions for sub—
strate sets of each P450 isozyme with a high level of accuracy:
87.1%, 85.7%, 83.4%, 88.7%, 86.7%, 89.0%, 88.5%, 83.5%,
87.6% and 89.4%, respectively, on these isozymes (Zaretzki et 61].,
2013 ).

predicting which atomic sites of a molecule are modified by P45 0s.
Key features of this web server are as follows:

1. The server computes XenoSite predictions for nine P45 0
isozymes including 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1
and 3A4, as well as HLMs.

2. As a standard for comparison, the server computes SMARTCyp
predictions for P45 0 metabolism Rydberg et al. (2010).

3. Predictions are visualized in shaded images of the input mol—
ecules (Fig. 1) and are available for download in a ﬂat ﬁle.

4. Prediction images are available using several scaling strategies to
aid interpretability and are also available for download in a
zipped archive.

5. Molecules uploaded to the server that are also part of the train—
ing set are displayed with known SOMs circled.

6. XenoSite models in the server will be updated as the training
dataset grows and modeling approaches improve.

Complete documentation and a comprehensive performance
comparison are available online.

2.1 Implementation

XenoSite server is implemented in python, using the Pyramid web
framework (http://www.pylonsproject.org/) as well as SciPy and NumPy
for numerical computations, MOPAC (Stewart, 1990) (http://openmo
pac.net) to compute quantum mechanical descriptions of potential
SOMs, OpenBabel (O’Boyle et 61]., 2011) (http://openbabel.org) to gen—
erate topological descriptions of molecules and compute useful measures
such as LogP and SMARTP450 (Rydberg et 61]., 2010) to estimate the
reactivity of potential SOMs. It also utilizes the OpenEye OEChem soft—
ware (http://eyesopen.com) to generate images of SOM predictions.

2.2 Inputs

XenoSite server allows the submission of molecular structures in
SMILES or SDF format, either via a file upload or by typing or past—
ing molecules in either format into the web site. SMILES and SDF
format are common chemical formats for which several publicly
available libraries exist.

2.3 Outputs
XenoSite provides prediction output in a tab—delimited table with
seven columns. The first column is the molecule title or a number cor—
responding to the order in which the molecules were input if titles are
not provided in the SDF or SMILES. The second column is the num—
ber of the atom in the input molecule. The third column contains nu—
merical labels that group atoms by common topology or are part of
the same reaction. The fourth column gives the probability of metab—
olism as predicted by XenoSite. The fifth column contains the atom
type. The sixth column is a Boolean value indicating whether the
atomic site is annotated as a known SOM from the literature sources
used in training the XenoSite predictive models. The final column is
the background probability of observing a site of metabolism given
the model, which can be used to interpret or rescale the prediction.
XenoSite also provides visual output for each molecule and each
P45 0 isozyme. Molecules’ SOMs are labeled by a color gradient (as
in Fig. 1), with the colors scaled according to the chosen scaling
mode. In the default mode ‘background’, blue corresponds to a zero
probability of metabolism, white corresponds to a probability equal
to the background probability of observing a SOM at random and
red corresponds to a probability of 1.0. Probability values can be
scaled to aid interpretation by using other user—selectable scaling

Fig. 1. XenoSite server’s HLM metabolism predictions on zotepine (center mol-
ecule). Zotepine metabolism by CYPs includes nitrogen dealkylation, carbon
hydroxylation and sulfur oxidation. In the figure, sites of metabolism are cor-
rectly identified by Xenosite. Zotepine is in the training set, so known SOMs are
circled. Each site of metabolism corresponds to specific metabolite molecules
(unshaded molecules). Predictions closely match the known sites

algorithms including unscaled, normalized or polynomial scaling.
Images of individual molecules with SOM predictions can be down—
loaded in PNG or PDF format. If a molecule is annotated with
known SOMs, these sites are circled.

3 Conclusion

In this article, we describe a publicly available, web—based tool for
predicting P45 0—mediated xenobiotic metabolism of user—submitted
molecules, based on the XenoSite Cytochrome P45 0 metabolism
prediction models (http://swami.wustl.edu/xenosite). XenoSite
server provides a simple interface for generating metabolism predic—
tions, as well as tools for visualizing and comparing potential SOMs
across a variety P45 0 isozymes.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Sequence-derived structural and physiochemical features
have been frequently used for analysing and predicting structural,
functional, expression and interaction profiles of proteins and pep-
tides. To facilitate extensive studies of proteins and peptides, we de-
veloped a freely available, open source python package called protein
in python (propy) for calculating the widely used structural and physi-
cochemical features of proteins and peptides from amino acid se-
quence. It computes five feature groups composed of 13 features,
including amino acid composition, dipeptide composition, tripeptide
composition, normalized Moreau—Broto autocorrelation, Moran auto-
correlation, Geary autocorrelation, sequence-order-coupling number,
quasi-sequence-order descriptors, composition, transition and distri-
bution of various structural and physicochemical properties and two
types of pseudo amino acid composition (PseAAC) descriptors. These
features could be generally regarded as different Chou’s PseAAC
modes. In addition, it can also easily compute the previous descriptors
based on user-defined properties, which are automatically available
from the AAindex database.

Availability: The python package, propy, is freely available via http://
code.google.com/p/protpy/downloads/list, and it runs on Linux and
MS-Windows.

1 INTRODUCTION

Sequence-derived structural and physicochemical features have
been widely used in the development of machine learning models
for predicting protein structural and functional classes (Chou,
2001, 2009), protein—protein interactions (Shen et al., 2007), pro-
tein—ligand interactions OK u et al., 2012), subcellular locations
and peptides of speciﬁc properties (Chou and Shen, 2008).
These features are highly useful for representing and distinguish-
ing proteins or peptides of different structural, functional and
interaction proﬁles. Currently, these structural and physicochem-
ical features of proteins and peptides were routinely used to char-
acterize target proteins in drug—target pairs and predict new
drug—target associations to identify potential drug targets (He
et al., 2010), following the spirit of chemogenomics.

Several programs for computing protein structural and physi-
cochemical features have been developed (Du et al., 2012;

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Holland et al., 2008; Li et al., 2006); however, they are not com-
prehensive and can only be limited to a certain kind of features.
Additionally, these are not freely and easily accessible.

We implemented a selection of sophisticated protein features
and provide them as a package for the free and open source
software environment python. The propy package aims at pro-
viding the user with comprehensive implementations of these
descriptors in a uniﬁed framework to allow easy and transparent
computation. To our knowledge, propy is the ﬁrst open source
package computing a large number of protein features based on
user-deﬁned structural and physicochemical properties. We rec-
ommend propy to analyse and represent the proteins or peptides
under investigation. Further, we hope that the package will be
helpful when exploring questions concerning the structures, func-
tions and interactions of proteins and peptides in the context of
systems biology.

2 PACKAGE DESCRIPTION

The propy package can compute a large number of structural
and physicochemical features from amino acid sequence. A list of
features for proteins and peptides covered by the current version
of propy is summarized in Table 1. These features can be divided
into ﬁve groups, each of which has been independently predicting
protein- and peptide-related problems by using machine-learning
methods. The ﬁrst group includes three features, amino acid
composition, dipeptide composition and tripeptide composition,
with three descriptors and 8420 descriptor values. The second
group consists of three different autocorrelation features: nor-
malized Moreau—Broto autocorrelation, Moran autocorrelation
and Geary autocorrelation. The autocorrelation features describe
the level of correlation between two protein or peptide sequences
in terms of their speciﬁc structural or physicochemical property.
Each of these features has eight descriptors and 240 descriptor
values. The third group contains three feature sets: composition,
transition and distribution with 21 descriptors and 147 descriptor
values. They represent the amino acid distribution pattern of a
speciﬁc structural or physicochemical property along a protein or
peptide sequence. Seven types of physicochemical properties
have been used for calculating these features (Supplementary
Material). The fourth group includes two sequence-order feature
sets, one is sequence-order-coupling number with two descriptors
and 60 descriptor values, and the other is quasi-sequence—order
with two descriptors and 100 descriptor values. These features
are derived from both Schneider—Wrede physicochemical dis-
tance matrix and Grantham chemical distance matrix. The ﬁfth
group contains two types of pseudo-amino acid compositions

aThe number depends on the choice of the number of properties of amino acid and the choice of the parameter values in algorithms.

(PseAAC): type I PseAAC with 50 descriptor values and type II
PseAAC (i.e. amphiphilic PseAAC) with 50 descriptor values.
Apart from these descriptors, it can also compute previous de-
scriptors based on user-deﬁned properties, which are easily ac-
cessible from the AAindex database (Kawashima and Kanehisa,
2000). In fact, the aforementioned features can be regarded as
different Chou’s PseAAC modes. For example, amino acid, di-
peptide, tripeptide or n-mer peptide (11:4, 5,...) compositions
are just different modes of Chou’s PseAAC. Moreover, the
higher-level features, such as GO (Gene Ontology) information,
F unD (Functional Domain) information and sequential evolu-
tion information, are also skilfully fused into the Chou’s
PseAAC descriptors to characterize different protein informa-
tion, which is widely used for solving various biological prob-
lems. An excellent review by Chou (2011) has pointed out their
relevancy.

The propy package contains several functions and modules
manipulating proteins and peptides. To obtain protein sequences
easily, propy provides a download module, by which the user
could easily get protein sequences from the Uniprot website by
providing Uniprot IDs or a ﬁle containing Uniprot IDs. A check
module is also provided to ensure that our input for subsequent
calculation is reliable. To facilitate the accessibility of the prop-
erty or distance matrix of amino acids, propy provides an
AAIndex module, which helps the user automatically download
the needed property from the AAindex database. There are two
means to compute these structural and physicochemical features
from protein or peptide sequences. One is to use the built-in
modules in the propy package. There exist ﬁve modules respond-
ing to the calculation of descriptors from ﬁve feature groups. The
instruction for each module is provided in the form of HTML in
propy. We could import related functions to compute these fea-
tures as needed. The other is to call the GetProDes class by
importing the PyPro module, which encapsulates commonly
used descriptor calculation methods. We could construct a
GetProDes object with a protein sequence input, and then call
corresponding methods to calculate these features. A user guide
for the use of propy is included in propy to guide how the user
uses it to calculate the needed features (Supplementary Material).

Additionally, the main advantage of propy is that the users them-
selves could specify some sets of amino acid properties in the
form of dictionary (a data structure in python). More conveni-
ently, the output from the AAIndex module could be directly
used as the user-deﬁned property to calculate the aforementioned
descriptors, greatly enlarging the applications to our calculated
features.

propy is written by the pure python language. We chose to use
python because it is open source, and there already exist pack-
ages to handle proteins [e.g. Biopython (Cock et al., 2009),
PyMol and Pythonscape]. It is convenient for propy to analyse
proteins and peptides processed by Biopython. Moreover, it only
needs the support of some built-in modules in python. This
greatly facilitates the transplantation and applications of the
propy package. The use of the dictionary data structure in
the propy output makes the users clearly understand the meaning
of each feature.

3 DISCUSSION

Sequence analysis of proteins and peptides has become more and
more important in various bioinformatics ﬁelds. Apart from
the prediction of structural and functional classes of proteins
or peptides, there exist a few stand-alone applications to calcu-
late protein/peptide descriptors, which are designed to work with
drug descriptors in the chemogenomics framework.

propy contains a selection of various Chou’s PseAAC descrip-
tors to analyse, classify and compare complex proteins and pep-
tides. They facilitate to exploit machine-learning techniques
to drive hypothesis from complex protein or peptide datasets.
The usefulness of the features covered by propy for computing
the structural and physicochemical features of proteins and pep-
tides has been validated by a number of published studies (Chou,
2009, 2011). The propy implementation of each of these algo-
rithms was extensively tested by using a number of test se-
quences. The computed descriptor values were compared with
the known values for these sequences to ensure that our compu-
tation is accurate.

propy is a powerful open source package for the extraction of
features of proteins and peptides. In our future work, we plan to

apply the integrated features on various biological research ques-
tions and extend the range of functions with new promising de-
scriptors for the coming versions of propy.

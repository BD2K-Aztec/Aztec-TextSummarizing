Abstract

Motivation: Cellular mRNA levels originate from the combined action of multiple regulatory proc—
esses, which can be recapitulated by the rates of pre—mRNA synthesis, pre—mRNA processing and
mRNA degradation. Recent experimental and computational advances set the basis to study these
intertwined levels of regulation. Nevertheless, software for the comprehensive quantification of
RNA dynamics is still lacking.

Results: INSPECT is an R package for the integrative analysis of RNA— and 4sU—seq data to study
the dynamics of transcriptional regulation. INSPECT provides gene—level quantification of these
rates, and a modeling framework to identify which of these regulatory processes are most likely to
explain the observed mRNA and pre—mRNA concentrations. Software performance is tested on a
synthetic dataset, instrumental to guide the choice of the modeling parameters and the experimen—
tal design.

Availability and implementation: INSPECT is submitted to Bioconductor and is currently available
as Supplementary Additional File S1.

1 Introduction

 

The study of eukaryotic cellular transcriptional responses following
external stimuli or during cell differentiation processes is typically
based on profiling of mRNA abundances over time. This allows dis—
criminating between early, intermediate and late responsive genes,
but leaves undisclosed the dynamic transcriptional regulatory proc-
esses determining the resulting observed RNA level. mRNAs are
synthesized within the nucleus thanks to a complex process that is
controlled by numerous factors, including chromatin accessibility,

transcription factors binding events and RNA Polymerase release
(Orphanides and Reinberg, 2002). The joint action of these regula—
tory processes determines the efficiency of transcription, which can
be recapitulated and measured as the RNA synthesis rate. Precursor
mRNA molecules (pre—mRNAs), originated through the synthesis
step, need to be processed in order to make a mature, functional
mRNA molecule. Maturation involves the excision of the introns
and the addition of a 5’—cap and a 3’ poly—adenine tail, modifications
that co—occur at the transcription site and impact transcript stability.

Once mature mRNA is produced, it is translocated within the cyto—
plasm where it can be either translated or bound by RNA—binding
proteins and targeted for degradation (Fu et al., 2014; Houseley and
Tollervey, 2009). Overall, synthesis, processing and degradation
rates determine the levels of mRNA within the cell, and the com-
bined modulation of these three elements determines changes in
mRNA abundance over time (Braun and Young, 2014; Raghavan
et al., 2002; Shalem et al., 2008).

Recently, an experimental technique based on a short pulse of a
labeled nucleotide (4—thiouridine, 4sU) and consequent incorporation
in the nascent RNA was developed, to measure the concentration of
nascent mRNA and for the genome—wide inference of gene—level syn—
thesis rates. During a short pulse (typically few minutes), cells medium
is complemented with 4sU, a naturally occurring modified uridine that
is incorporated within mRNA growing chains with minimal impact
on cell viability (Melvin et al., 1978). RNA chains having incorporated
the uridine variant (newly synthesized) can be isolated from the total
RNA population by biotinylation and purification with streptavidin—
coated magnetic beads, followed by sequencing (4sU—seq).
Consequently, various studies have elucidated the different roles that
RNA synthesis, processing and degradation can have in response to
various environmental conditions in yeasts and metazoans (Eser et al.,
2013; Miller et al., 2011; Rabani et al., 2011; Sun et al., 2013; Zeisel
et al., 2011), illustrating how various and complex can be the tran—
scriptional responses originated by the concerted action of these regu—
latory mechanisms.

Few analytical methods were proposed for the study of these
regulatory mechanisms. The DTA Bioconductor package was used
to determine synthesis and degradation rates in a number of works
(Eser et al., 2013; Miller et al., 2011; Sun et al., 2013). The main
limitations of this tool are (i) the lack of inference of processing
rates, (ii) the lack of computationally based normalization between
4sU and RNA—seq data, and more importantly (iii) the absence of a
modeling framework. A similar method was described for the infer—
ence of synthesis and degradation rates, lacking a corresponding
software implementation (Zeisel et al., 2011). In a first study,
Rabani et al. introduced a framework where rates are modeled to
improve the confidence in the determination of rates absolute val—
ues. Additionally, this modeling approach was used to discriminate
between constant and varying degradation processes (Rabani et al.,
2011). This method was extensively described in the publication but
no software implementation was released. At the moment of this
publication, the method described in Rabani et al. (2011) was ex—
tended to distinguish between constant and varying processing rates
and a software implementation was released (DRiLL) (Rabani et al.,
2014). The software currently available has major limitations in
terms of both documentation and implementation, and lacks func—
tionalities to test its performance and provide guidance on the most
suitable experimental design.

Given the limitations of these studies and their corresponding
tools, we developed INSPEcT (INference of Synthesis, Processing
and dEgradation rates in Time—course analysis), a computational
tool for the joint analysis of 4sU— and RNA—seq data providing r0—
bust synthesis, processing and degradation rates over time, based on
a system of differential equations describing mRNA production,
maturation and degradation processes. INSPEcT can determine the
probability of a given combination of rate(s) to regulate the gene ex—
pression during the time—course by modeling and comparing alterna-
tive scenarios of transcriptional regulation. Importantly, INSPEcT
allows testing the performance of the tool given a dataset and pre—
dicting how many additional replicates and/0r time points would be
needed to reach the desired performance.

2 Software implementation and overview

INSPEcT is a computational tool for the analysis of RNA— and 4sU—
seq time—course data, resulting in the inference of RNA synthesis,
processing and degradation rates over time, and allowing to statis—
tically assess their contribution in shaping the expression level of a
gene. INSPEcT is based on estimation of total mRNA levels and pre—
mRNA levels (from RNA—seq), synthesis rates and processing rates
(from 4sU—seq), and degradation rates from the combined analysis
of these two data types.

The INSPEcT R package is submitted to the Bioconductor pro—
ject and was developed in compliance with the most common
Bioconductor infrastructures. Specifically, classes inheriting from
the ExpressionSet class are used to represent high—throughput gene
expression data, and the TranscriptDb class (available for an exten—
sive set of organisms) is adopted as a reference for gene models.
Therefore, methods and functions available within this package can
be easily integrated with other Bioconductor packages for up— or
down—stream analysis steps. Parallel computation is used to minim-
ize the computational time for most demanding tasks, as in the case
of the modelRates INSPEcT method. As required in Bioconductor,
each individual method and function is accompanied by specific
documentation and working examples. Moreover, INSPEcT in-
cludes a vignette to interactively demonstrate the software key func—
tionalities and a typical workﬂow (also reported as Supplementary
Additional File S2). Methods, functions and classes available in the
INSPEcT package matching the discussed functionalities are in italic
throughout the text, and the main steps in the software workﬂow
are outlined here:

' Exonic and intronic RPKMs (Reads Per Kilobase per Million
mapped reads) for both RNA— and 4sU—seq datasets are deter—
mined for each gene (makeRPKMs function). Exonic and
intronic RNA-seq RPKMs allow quantifying total mRNA and
pre-mRNA, respectively.

° Normalized synthesis, processing and degradation rates are ob—
tained integrating RNA— and 4sU—seq data (mu/INSPECT).

° Total mRNA and pre—mRNA concentrations, and synthesis, pro—
cessing and degradation rates are modeled for each gene to assess
which of the rates (if any) is changing over time reconstructing
observed abundances of mRNAs (modelRates).

° Simulated data that recapitulate rate distributions, their variation
over time and their pair—wise correlations are created and used to
evaluate the performance of the method (makeSimModel,
makeSimDataset, rocCurz/e).

Figure 1 illustrates the overall INSPEcT design along with the
main input and output.

3 Mathematical model

INSPEcT is based on a set of differential equations describing the
process of production, maturation and degradation of pre-mRNA
and mature mRNAs. The system of differential equations models
the synthesis of new pre—mRNAs (P) by a process that occurs at rate
a(t) (synthesis). pre—mRNAs decay into mature mRNAs (M) expo—
nentially following a rate C(t) (processing). Mature mRNAs are ex—
ponentially degraded following rate [9(t) (degradation). Total
mRNAs levels are defined as the sum of pre—mRNA and mature
mRNA levels (T = P —l— M).

Fig. 1. Diagram illustrating the main steps of a typical INSPECT workflow.
INSPECT functions and methods that can be used for specific steps are indi-
cated in italic. Input RNA- and 4sU-seq sequencing data are both subjected to
alignment and exonic and intronic RPKMs are computed. These data are
passed to the newlNSPEchethod that determines total and pre-mRNA con-
centrations and normalized rates. On one hand these data can be used for the
creation of a simulated dataset; simulated RNA concentrations and rates are
subjected to modeling, leading to evaluation of modeling performance
through ROC analysis. On the other hand, real RNA concentrations and rates
are subjected to modeling thus providing for each gene the most likely tran-
scriptional regulatory mechanism. For example, as indicated in the figure the
expression of gene X over time is mostly under control of varying synthesis
(a) and degradation (b) rates

(2)

This model makes the assumptions that pre—mRNAs are not
degraded, and that translocation of mRNAs from nucleus (where
they originate) to cytoplasm (where they can be degraded) occur im—
mediately after maturation, or at a rate considerably faster than
b(t). These assumptions are typically considered acceptable and
have been previously referred to (Rabani et al., 2011). The model
also imposes no spatial segregation of mRNA into cellular compart-
ments. This phenomenon can have an impact on degradation of
some mRNAs, but the experimental information is typically difficult
to obtain (or not available).

3.1 Determination of normalized rates and
concentrations

After having quantified data from RNA—seq (R) and 4sU—seq
(labeled, L) libraries into intronic and exonic RPKMs (makeRPKMs
function), the newINSPEcT method is used to estimate synthesis,
processing and degradation rates by solving the system of differen-
tial equations (2) applied at every time point (t) to both the total and
labeled fractions. When applied to the labeled RNA fraction, the
system can be solved and integrated between t — tL and t, assuming
that no labeled molecules existed before the labeling pulse (tL).

INSPEcT by default assumes that no degradation occurs during the
short labeling time (typically 10min). Consequently, we have four
equations with three unknowns (at, bt, and ct):

PR. = at — CtPR.

TRt : at — bt(TRt — PRt)

(3)
PL. = ﬂ (1 — 
Ct
TLt : attL

For each gene, PRt is equal to its pre—mRNA level (intronic RNA-seq
RPKM), TRt is equal to the total mRNA level (exonic RNA—seq
RPKM), and PLt is equal to the pre—mRNA level as quantified in the
labeled fraction (intronic 4sU—seq RPKM). Finally, TLt is equal to
the total mRNA level as quantified in the labeled fraction (exonic
4sU—seq RPKM). PRt, TRt are estimated from the interpolation of
the PR(t) and TR(t) time—courses using cubic splines.

INSPEcT takes advantage of the over—determination of the sys—
tem to identify for each time point a normalization factor nt that is
used to scale labeled data (PLt,TLt). nt is determined minimizing the
difference between ct as estimated from (i) equations (3.1) and (3.3),
and (ii) equations (3.3) and (3.4) [see Supplementary Additional File
S3, equations (s1)—(s2)].

Subsequently, while synthesis rates are calculated solving equa—
tion (3.4), processing and degradation rates are determined by
newINSPEcT iteratively integrating equations (3.1) and (3.2),
assuming linear behavior of synthesis rate, pre—mRNA and total
mRNA between time—points.

This procedure of estimation of degradation and processing rates is
more robust compared with estimating derivatives of T and P dir-
ectly from the data [for details see Supplementary Additional File
S3, equations (s3)—(s7)].

In case of experiments based on longer 4sU pulses, the assump—
tion that no degradation of newly synthesized transcript occurs does
not hold anymore. To cope with this experimental design, the
newINSPEcT method provides an alternative set of equations that
take into account the degradation of transcripts during the pulse
[see Supplementary Additional File S3, equation (s8)].

3.2 Modeling of rates and concentrations

Once a prior estimate is obtained for synthesis, processing and deg—
radation rates over time for each gene, INSPEcT tests different models
of transcriptional regulation to identify the most likely combination
of rates explaining the observed changes in gene expression
(modelRates method). To this purpose, a parametric function is fit on
each rate over time, through minimization of residual sum of squares.
For example in the case of RNA synthesis, after having selected func—
tion f for the fit of a synthesis rate for a given gene, a set of parameters
pa is chosen after n random initializations as the one that better ex—
plains the data [see Supplementary Additional File S3, equation (s9)].

Fig.2. Schema illustrating the models to be compared for determining if a tran-
scriptional regulatory rate is variable or constant over time. mRNA synthesis
(a), degradation (b) and processing rates (c) are individually tested for being
variable or constant; models are named after rate(s) that are hypothesized to be
variable. For each rate, multiple nested models can be compared, indicated by
identical arrows. As an example, dashed arrows indicate the four models that
could be tested to determine the likelihood that the degradation rate (b) is vary-
ing over time, given the provided data (see text for details)

Both f and n can be user—defined in INSPEcT. By default, rates are fit
using both the sigmoid and the impulse model (Chechik and Koller,
2009) functions, and the one that better explains the data in terms of
goodness of fit, measured by 12 test is chosen, thus penalizing the im-
pulse model for the added complexity. For both functions, due to the
reduced number of the time—points typically available in a biological
time—course experiment, a strong priori to the random initialization of
parameters is given based on the data. Once the parametric function—
alization for synthesis, degradation and processing rates were ob—
tained, it is possible to test how those parametric functions were able
to recapitulate the experimental data they originated from after an
additional minimization step [see Supplementary Additional File S3,
equations (s10)—(s11)]. To identify the most likely mechanism of tran-
scriptional regulation, INSPEcT tests the possibility that each rate is
constant during the time course by building models that alternatively
set as constant one, two or all the three rates. Regarding the degrad—
ation rate for example, four pairs of models (dashed arrows in Fig. 2)
can be considered to test whether this rate is more likely to be con—
sidered variable or constant. All these pairs are nested models that can
be evaluated via log likelihood ratio test against the null hypothesis
that the degradation rate is constant. Only pairs of nested models
where at least one model is successfully evaluated by 12 test are con—
sidered, and resulting P—values are combined using Brown’s method
(Brown, 1975) The same procedure is thus applied for the evaluation
of synthesis rate (comparing nested models as indicated by the solid
arrows in Fig. 2) and processing rate (dotted arrows). Alternatively,
model selection through AIC (Akaike information criterion) is
supported.

4 Evaluation of performance through
simulated data

Simulated data were used to evaluate the performance of INSPEcT
in classifying each rate as constant or variable, and to estimate the
number of time points and replicates necessary to achieve a given
performance. Simulated data are generated on the basis of real data
(RNA concentrations and rates) and aim at: (i) reproducing the dis—
tributions of their absolute intensities, their variation over time, and
the correlations between these features; and (ii) obtaining a dataset
where the ground truth is known in terms of which genes are under
the control of varying or constant rates.

4.1 Generation of the simulated data
The generation of the simulated data involves the following steps
(see also Fig. 1 and Supplementary Additional File S3 for details):

i. Real rates quantiﬁcation (mu/INSPECT function): rates are
quantiﬁed on a real time—course dataset (including N time
points).

ii. Parametric functions of simulated rates (makeSimModel method):
distributions of rates, their variation over time, and their pairwise
correlations are evaluated. As a result, functions of the simulated
rates and their parameters are returned for the required number
of genes (G) (see an example for the synthesis rate in
Supplementary Fig. S6 in Supplementary Additional File S3).

iii. Recapitulating the variance of real data (makeSimModel
method): to sample the noise that will be added to the simulated
data, a time—course of synthesis, degradation and processing
rates is created for N time points, and pre—mRNA and total
mRNA levels are coherently generated for G genes. Rates and
concentrations are then used to derive simulated exonic and in—
tronic signals of labeled and total RNA datasets. The resulting
simulated datasets are intrinsically noise—free and indeed show a
reduced variance compared with the real data. The missing vari-
ance is determined and returned for each gene G and dataset
(see an example for the exonic signals from the labeled library
in Supplementary Fig. S7 in Supplementary Additional File S3).

iv. Generation of simulated data (makeSimDataset method): given
a required number of time—points and replicates, and the output
of the makeSimModel method, for each gene G simulated rates
and concentrations are calculated, white—noise is added (with
the given noise variance), and exonic and intronic signals are
coherently reconstructed and returned for both the total and the
labeled dataset.

The obtained simulated dataset, subjected to the modeling by the
modelRates method, is provided to the rocCurz/e method, which uses
a ROC—curve analysis to measure classification performance in terms
of sensitivity and specificity. False negatives (FN) represent cases
where the rate is identified as constant while it was simulated as vary—
ing. False positives (FP) represent cases where INSPEcT identified a
rate as varying while it was simulated as constant. On the contrary,
true positives (TP) and negatives (TN) are cases of correct classifica—
tion of varying and constant rates, respectively. Consequently, sensi—
tivity and specificity are computed using increasing thresholds for the
brown’s P—values, and the ability of correctly classifying a rate is
measured through the area under the curve (AUC) for each rate.

4.2 Evaluation of INSPECT Classification performance
with different experimental designs

To evaluate INSPEcT performance, we generated a pilot experiment
using mouse 3T9 cells transfected with the MchR construct so that
the expression of the Myc transcription factor can be induced beyond
endogenous levels. The transcriptional response was followed over
time (9 time points) by RNA—seq and 4sU—seq sequencing (10 min 4sU
pulse; the data are available within the INSPEcT package).
Normalized rates and concentrations are determined applying the
newINSPEcT method on the experimental data as illustrated earlier
and were used to generate synthetic datasets with different numbers
of replicates and time points that were subjected to ROC analysis. In
all tested cases the performance achieved for the synthesis rate was
higher in terms of AUC compared with degradation and processing
rates. This is expected, since only the synthesis rate is determined dir—
ectly from the labeled RNA fraction. When increasing the number of

time points from 9 to 12 and the number of replicates from 1 to 3, the
performance of the classification significantly improved: AUC
increased from 0.78 to 0.89 for the synthesis rate, from 0.65 to 0.83
for the degradation rate and from 0.61 to 0.77 for the processing rate
(Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S1 in Supplementary Additional File
S3). As expected, using a simulated dataset including only two repli-
cated time—courses provided intermediate performance, while increas-
ing from three to four replicated time—courses did not significantly
improve the results, thus not justifying the increase sequencing cost.
We concluded that, given the simulated data created on the basis of
the pilot experiment data, an experimental design comprising three
replicated time—courses of 12 time points each would provide the best
trade—off in terms of cost and performance.

5 Comparison with existing methods and tools

We compared INSPEcT theoretical and computational framework
with available tools and data from the following studies:

i. (Rabani et al., 2011); from here on data will be named
Rabani2011; no software provided;
ii. (Miller et al., 2011); data: Miller2011; software: DTA
iii. (Rabani et al., 2014); data: Rabani2014; software: DRiLL

5.1 Rabani2011 and DRILL

Compared with the method proposed in Rabani et al. (2011),
INSPEcT implements and significantly extends the set of equations
describing the dynamics of system, and the modeling and testing
framework. Very recently, a revised version of the method originally
proposed in Rabani et al. (2011) was published, extending the former
approach to quantify pre—mRNAs and model processing rates
(Rabani et al., 2014). Both Rabani2011 and Rabani2014 are based
on high-throughput measurements of the transcriptional response of

mouse dendritic cells exposed to lipopolysaccharide, for both total
and 4sU—labeled RNAs. Rabani2011 data were obtained through the
Nanostring nCounter platform, thus providing digital measurements
based on a limited number of probes for several hundreds genes.
Thanks to INSPEcT flexibility, we could analyze these data despite
the lack of probes covering introns, at the cost of an impaired quanti—
fication of pre—mRNA. Although we were not able to quantify pre—
mRNA processing rates, we could recapitulate the published results in
terms of degradation rates distribution and degradation dynamics of
genes that were considered variable over time (Supplementary Figs S2
and S3 in Supplementary Additional File S3).

For a more quantitative comparison, we reanalyzed Rabani2014
data, for which rates resulting from DRiLL analysis are available.
Data were provided in the form of pre—mRNA and mature mRNA
expression intensities of the labeled and the total fraction. We
derived intronic expression directly from their pre-mRNAs inten-
sities and exonic expression as the sum of the pre—mRNAs and ma—
ture mRNAs levels. Intronic and exonic expressions of both labeled
and total fractions were provided to the newINSPEcT method and
rates were obtained and further subjected to modeling. According to
Rabani et al. (2014) the correlation of DRiLL—derived rates with
their previous study (Rabani et al., 2011) was considered significant
(r=0.39 and 0.23 for degradation and processing rates, respect—
ively). Similarly, rates estimated with INSPEcT on Rabani2014
modeled rates are correlated at 0.33 and 0.24 for degradation and
processing, respectively. Importantly, after modeling these rates
with INSPEcT, the correlations increased to 0.56 and 0.28, respect—
ively. Synthesis rates are correlated at 0.65 and 0.69 pre— and post—
modeling. We consider these correlations to be modest and we eval—
uated the possibility that this variation is due to the different
normalization strategy adopted by INSPEcT and DRiLL. DRiLL
introduced a normalization method that tries to estimate the con—
tamination of total RNA in the labeled library. The authors esti—
mated this contamination to be around 30% in Rabani2014 data,
and they consequently adjusted the data for this factor. We adopted
the same method they described to estimate this contamination fac—
tor on Rabani2014 and on the data in the current study. We could
not confirm this level of contamination, which was estimated at
10% in their dataset and was absent in ours. When compensating
for this factor, the correlation between INSPEcT and DRiLL only
marginally increased to 0.75 and 0.36 for pre—model synthesis and
processing rates, respectively. Eventually, we decided to refrain
from implementing this correction, while ruling out that this might
represent a reason for the observed difference in the estimated rates.

Similarly to DRiLL, INSPEcT provides a computational routine
for the normalization of RNA— and 4sU—seq data, allowing an un—
biased estimation of the scaling factors at each time point. This was
previously achieved based on the yield of the 4sU—labeled mRNA re—
covered from the total RNA (Miller et al., 2011; Rabani et al.,
2011). However, this procedure depends on the 4sU availability
within the cell, which can be influenced by the rate of nucleotides
transportation and metabolism. Considering the fact that genes
involved in uridine transportation and metabolization are often
regulated over time—resolved transcriptional responses (see
Supplementary Figs S4 and S5 in Supplementary Additional File S3),
the scaling factors computed using the amount of 4sU recovered and
the one estimated computationally can be highly different and lead
to considerably different global results. Therefore, we propose to
rely on the computational scaling factor as a more robust alternative
for the analysis of 4sU—seq data.

Importantly, Rabani2014 dataset lacks replicates, which is far
from the optimal choice when using INSPEcT, especially for the

modeling framework. It is not clear to us how they managed the
lack of replicated experiments. In fact, Supplementary Figure S1 in
our manuscript displays the performance evaluation on the analysis
of our own experimental data in single replicate with sequencing
depth similar to the Rabani2014 dataset (86M versus 68M rRNA—
depleted, unaligned reads in their dataset, compared to our own).
We show there that the performance of the constant/varying classifi-
cation is quite low with data of this depth and lack of replicates
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Our ROC analysis suggests that their data—
set did not have enough replicates. For this reason, we decided to
avoid to compare the classification between the two methods.

Eventually, the ROC analysis based on the simulated data gener—
ated by INSPEcT, could have been conclusive on the relative perform-
ance of the two tools. Unfortunately, we were unable to use DRiLL
neither on their nor on our own data, having this software major limi-
tations in terms of both documentation and implementation.

5.2 DTA

DTA is an alternative method available for the joint analysis of
RNA— and 4sU—seq data (Miller et al., 2011). Compared with
INSPEcT, DTA is limited to the inference of RNA synthesis and deg—
radation rates in terms of variation between two conditions.
Moreover, it does not offer the possibility of determining pre-
mRNA levels and computing pre—mRNA processing rates.
Importantly, DTA lacks any modeling, which is central in INSPEcT,
and consequently is not able to infer which layer(s) of transcrip-
tional regulation (synthesis, degradation or processing in the case of
INSPEcT) are most likely to be responsible for the final mRNA level.
Regarding the normalization of RNA— and 4sU—seq data, an ex—
panded version of DTA was released (Eser et al., 2013; Sun et al.,
2012), proposing an experimental procedure to scale the data from
the two sequencing libraries, which is based on the adoption of in—
ternal standards quantified along with the sample, thus allowing the
estimation of absolute rate intensities. However, this procedure does
not eliminate the bias due to 4sU—metabolism discussed earlier.

In order to directly compare INSPEcT to DTA, we used our tool
to reanalyze the Miller2011 dataset. As previously discussed for
Rabani2011, the Miller2011 dataset does not include expression
intensities for introns and only synthesis and degradation rates can
be determined. Leveraging on INSPEcT flexibility, we were able to
reanalyze these data, and we obtained a correlation of 0.91 and 0.70
for pre—model synthesis and degradation rates, respectively.
Importantly, Miller2011 degradation rates are validated comparing
with experiments performed in response to drugs blocking transcrip—
tion, thus indirectly validating the rates obtained with INSPEcT.

5.3 Advantages of INSPECT compared with available
methods (DRILL and DTA)
Recapitulating, the INSPEcT advantages compared with DTA are:

° the ability of dealing with the intronic signal to determine pre-
mRNA levels and quantify mRNA processing rates

° the presence of a comprehensive modeling framework, based on
ODE modeling of RNA dynamics

° a computational normalization method to scale labeled and total
mRNA intensities that compensates for 4sU—metabolism bias

INSPEcT advantages compared with DTA and DRiLL are:

° the INSPEcT ability to generate simulated data and perform a
ROC analysis to evaluate the performance of the classiﬁcation
and guide on the experimental design

° the ﬂexibility of working with both exonic only and exonic plus
intronic signals

° the ability of dealing with long 4sU pulses, taking into account
degradation during the pulse (which is in our experience a rela-
tively common experimental choice among our collaborators)

° the possibility of ﬁtting either impulse or sigmoid functions on
the data to reduce overﬁtting

' the possibility of using Akaike information criterion (AIC) for
model selection

° the availability as open—source R package in the Bioconductor
project and of the extended documentation for both individual
methods and the overall workﬂow (see Supplementary
Additional File S4). This only applies with respect to DRiLL.

6 Conclusions

In conclusion, INSPEcT provides an R/Bioconductor compliant so—
lution for the study of dynamic transcriptional regulatory processes.
Based on RNA— and 4sU—seq time—course datasets, which can be
jointly analyzed thanks to a computational normalization routine,
INSPEcT determines mRNA synthesis, degradation and pre—mRNA
processing rates over time for each gene, genome—wide. The
INSPEcT modeling framework allows the identification of gene—
level transcriptional regulatory mechanisms, determining which
combination of constant or variable synthesis, degradation and pro—
cessing rates is most likely to be responsible for the observed mRNA
level over time. Importantly, given a dataset, INSPEcT allows testing
its performance in classifying rates as constant or varying, and in
predicting how many additional replicates and/0r time points would
be needed to reach the desired performance.

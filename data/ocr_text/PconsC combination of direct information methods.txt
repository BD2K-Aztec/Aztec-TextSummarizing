ABSTRACT

Summary: Recently, several new contact prediction methods have
been published. They use (i) large sets of multiple aligned sequences
and (ii) assume that correlations between columns in these alignments
can be the results of indirect interaction. These methods are clearly
superior to earlier methods when it comes to predicting contacts in
proteins. Here, we demonstrate that combining predictions from two
prediction methods, PSICOV and plmDCA, and two alignment meth-
ods, HHblits and jackhmmer at four different e-value cut-offs, provides
a relative improvement of 20% in comparison with the best single
method, exceeding 70% correct predictions for one contact prediction
per residue.

1 INTRODUCTION

Protein structure prediction ab initio is one of the longest stand-
ing challenges in structural biology. Initial methods for predic-
tion showed little success, when tested blindly, because of
insurmountable dimensionality of the unrestrained search
space. One approach to enhance the structure prediction of a
protein is to predict interacting residues for use as constraints
during the folding process. However, until recently, the accuracy
of contact predictors has been limited. This was overcome by
using a large number of sequences and applying a ‘global’
model describing direct and indirect interactions (Burger and
van Nimwegen, 2010; Giraud et al., 1999; Weigt et al., 2009).
It has been shown that this information is sufﬁcient for structure
predictions (Marks et al., 2011). Here, we examine whether it is
possible to combine alternative alignment and prediction meth-
ods to improve the contact predictions further.

2 METHODS

PconsC uses predictions from two methods of inferring direct informa-
tion: PSICOV (Jones et al., 2012) (inverse covariance matrix estimation)
and plmDCA (Ekeberg et al., 2013) (pseudolikelihood with Potts

models), using default settings and alignments from jackhmmer
(Johnson et al., 2010) against UniRef 100 and HHblits (Remmert et al.,
2012) against its bundled nr20 database. For the different alignment
methods, four different e-value cut-offs (10—40, 10—10, 10—4, 1) and ﬁve
iterations were used. Including alignments from PSI-BLAST or PfamA
and/or using only mutual information performed signiﬁcantly worse.
Other direct information methods—meCA (Morcos et al., 2011) and
EVC (Hopf et al., 2012)—perform on par with PSICOV, but because of
great similarity in approach to plmDCA, they were not included.

The evaluation was conducted on the 150 proteins used in the devel-
opment of PSICOV—‘test set’. To avoid bias, we used an independent set
(‘training set’) of 48 proteins (12 globular and 36 membrane ones) that are
not homologous to each other or to any member of the test sets (no hits
with e—value <0.1 with an jackhmmer search).

The training set contains only predicted contacts that appear within
the top L (length of protein)-ranked contacts in any of the 16 input
method-alignment combinations. For each of the combinations, the con-
tacts (training samples) in the training set were identical. The input to the
classiﬁer consisted only of the raw prediction scores from the selected
methods.

Both in training and benchmarking, a true contact was deﬁned as two
residues with at least one non-hydro gen atom not further than 5  away
from any of the atoms of the other residue. Two residues are deﬁned not
to be in contact, if all of their non-hydrogen atoms are at least 8 A apart
from the atoms of the other residue. Only residue pairs with sequence
separation of at least ﬁve amino acids space were considered.

Direct information-based contact prediction is inherently a classiﬁca-
tion problem, based on a noisy input. Moreover, predicted contact scores
in both input methods are not directly comparable between different
prediction targets. Therefore, we decided to ﬁt an ensemble classiﬁer—
random forest—to the training data.

Random forests are known to be highly accurate, even on noisy data-
sets, but they may be prone to overﬁtting. To avoid it, we trained a 100-
tree random forest with an early stopping condition, requiring at least 500
samples in newly created leaves. The number of trees in the forest and
minimum leaf size were chosen based on the 5-fold cross-validation on
the training set. PconsC optimization used the implementation of random
forests available in the Python sklearn package (Pedregosa et al., 2011).
Using alternative classiﬁers, such as support vector machines, provided
similar results.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

First, we analyzed the performance of the 16 (four different
e-values, two different alignment methods and two different pre-
diction methods) individual methods. The prediction perform-
ance of plmDCA is clearly superior to the other methods,
regardless of the alignment method and cut-off chosen. Both
methods used are equally suitable for contact prediction.

Note: True positive: distance < 5 A, False positive: distance > 8 A.

Generally, using more permissive e-value cut-off results in
greater prediction accuracy with jackhmmer, but for HHblits,
the greatest precision is achieved with a cut-off of 104.
Nevertheless, PconsC incorporates four thresholds to capture
evolutionary couplings in variably conserved areas of proteins.
PfamA alignments render in general slightly worse results than
the other alignment methods.

The combination of different e-value cut-offs does improve the
precision (positive predictive value) by a few percentage points,
see Table 1, whereas combining alignments from j ackhmmer and
HHblits provides an additional improvement, in particular at the
higher ranked predictions (Supplementary Material). Finally,
combining plmDCA and PSICOV into the PconsC method
shows a substantial improvement, both when using only one
set of alignments, see Table 1, or in particular when using all
eight alignments, red line in Figure 1.

4 CONCLUSION

In conclusion, the benchmark data show that PconsC, a random
forest approach, combining four j ackhmmer alignments and four
HHblits alignments at e-value cut-offs of 10““), 10‘“), 10‘4 and
1 each and both PSICOV and plmDCA, provides a relative im-
provement of >20% in prediction precision (~12 percentage
points in absolute terms). For PconsC, on average nearly three
quarters of the top L predictions seem to be correct. This result is
robust and holds also for other deﬁnitions of true and false con-
tacts (e.g. Ca/ ,6 distances, different distance cut-offs etc,
Supplementary Material). The question of feasibility of predicted
contacts for structure modeling is out of the scope of this article,
as is the discussion on potential other causes of strong evolution-
ary couplings, such as alternative conformers, multimeric con-
tacts and functional implications.

It has not escaped our notice that the progress in the ﬁeld of
evolution-based contact prediction has been absolutely remark-
able. We have moved from being able to predict a handful of
contacts per protein, with a relatively low precision (with Mutual

Abstract

Motivation: Drug repositioning, which aims to identify new indications for existing drugs, offers a
promising alternative to reduce the total time and cost of traditional drug development. Many com—
putational strategies for drug repositioning have been proposed, which are based on similarities
among drugs and diseases. Current studies typically use either only drug—related properties (e.g.
chemical structures) or only disease—related properties (e.g. phenotypes) to calculate drug or dis—
ease similarity, respectively, while not taking into account the influence of known drug—disease as—
sociation information on the similarity measures.

Results: In this article, based on the assumption that similar drugs are normally associated with
similar diseases and vice versa, we propose a novel computational method named MBiRW, which
utilizes some comprehensive similarity measures and Bi—Random walk (BiRW) algorithm to identify
potential novel indications for a given drug. By integrating drug or disease features information
with known drug—disease associations, the comprehensive similarity measures are firstly de—
veloped to calculate similarity for drugs and diseases. Then drug similarity network and disease
similarity network are constructed, and they are incorporated into a heterogeneous network with
known drug—disease interactions. Based on the drug—disease heterogeneous network, BiRW algo—
rithm is adopted to predict novel potential drug—disease associations. Computational experiment
results from various datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach has reliable prediction per—
formance and outperforms several recent computational drug repositioning approaches.
Moreover, case studies of five selected drugs further confirm the superior performance of our
method to discover potential indications for drugs practically.

1 Introduction

The last decades have witnessed impressive advances in genomics,
life sciences and technology. However, drug discovery process is still
time consuming, risky and tremendously expensive (Li et al., 2015).
Even with the continuously increasing investments of research and
development (R&D), the number of new drugs approved by the US
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been declining since the
late 1990s (Grabowski et al., 2004). In light of the challenge in trad-
itional drug discovery, identifying new indications for existing
drugs, also known as drug repositioning or drug repurposing, has at—
tracted increasing interests from both the pharmaceutical industry
and research community (Hurle et al., 2013). Drug repositioning
can speed up the process of drug development and reduce risk, as re—
positioning candidates have already passed all necessary tests com—
mon to de novo drug discovery and development. Therefore, drug
repositioning has consequently become a major strategy and played
a key role in drug discovery and development. In addition, several
successful repositioned drugs (e.g. Sildenafil, thalidomide, raloxi-
fene) have generated historically high revenues for their patent hold—
ers or companies (Ashburn et al., 2004).

The goal of drug repositioning is to find potential new uses for
existing drugs and apply the newly identified drugs to the treatment
of diseases other than the drug’s originally intended disease (Shim
and Liu, 2014). Recently, some computational methods have been
proposed to predict direct drug—disease associations for drug repos—
itioning. For example, Chiang and Butte (2009) developed a
network—based, guilt—by—association method, to predict potential
drug—disease associations. This methodology recommended the
novel use of a drug based on the assumption that if two diseases
share some similar treatment profiles, then the drugs used for only
one of the two diseases could also be used for the other. However,
the method is biased toward both older drugs with diverse uses and
diseases with diverse treatments. Gottlieb et al. (2011) conducted
multiple drug—drug and disease—disease similarity measures to con—
struct discriminate features, and implemented a classification algo—
rithm named PREDICT to predict novel drug indications. Wu et al.
(2013) constructed a weighted disease and drug heterogeneous net—
work based on known disease—gene and drug—target relationships,
and applied network clustering to identify drug candidates. Wang
et al. (2014) proposed a novel heterogeneous network model which
integrated drug repositioning and target prediction into one unified
computational framework. Based on the framework, an iterative al—
gorithm was developed to rank candidate drugs for each disease.
Martinez et al. (2015) developed a network—based prioritization
method named DrugNet, which simultaneously integrated informa-
tion about diseases, drugs and targets to perform drug—disease and
disease—drug prioritization. Chen et al. (2015) formulated drug—
disease association prediction problem as recommending preferable
diseases for drugs and adopted two existing recommendation meth-
ods, ProbS and HeatS, to infer drug—disease associations directly.
Most of these approaches usually perform drug—disease prediction
by exploiting drug similarity and disease similarity, while similarity
measures are often based on some important drug— or disease—related
properties. However, previous studies seldom utilized the known
drug—disease interaction information of dataset for defining similar-
ity measures, and yet can be exploited to improve similarity
measures.

In this study, we present a novel prediction method MBiRW,
which adopts effective mechanism to measure similarity for drugs
and diseases, respectively, and applies Bi—Random walk (BiRW) al-
gorithm to predict potential indications for existing drugs. In the

new similarity measures, similarity calculated based on drug— or dis—
ease—related properties is improved in two aspects. First, as previous
studies (Van Driel et al., 2006; Vanunu et al., 2010; Wang et al.,
2014) have found that weak similarity provides little information
for interaction inference, we adjust those weak similarities which
are not informative for drug—disease prediction by correlation ana—
lysis. Second, two drugs are considered to be more similar if they
have common indications, or there exist other drugs which have
common indications with them simultaneously. Drugs and diseases
are clustered based on their shared commons, and similarity for
drugs or diseases which belong to the same cluster is adjusted.
What’s more, as it has been demonstrated better performance than
other random—walk methods on disease gene prioritization, BiRW
algorithm (Xie et al., 2012) is adopted to predict potential associ—
ations between drugs and diseases in this study.

Furthermore, we compare and evaluate the performance of
MBiRW on various datasets by adopting common metrics.
Experimental results demonstrate that MBiRW has the superior cap—
ability to discover potential disease indications for drugs.

2 Materials and methods

In this section, the dataset used in this study is firstly presented.
Then, based on the assumption that similar drugs often indicate
similar diseases, a novel approach of integrating comprehensive
similarity measures with Bi-directional Random Walk(BiRW),
referred to MBiRW, is proposed to predict potential associations be—
tween drugs and diseases.

Generally speaking, the overall prediction procedure of MBiRW
consists of three steps described as follows. Based on the collected
dataset, comprehensive similarity measures are firstly implemented
to measure similarity for drugs and diseases. Then, a heterogeneous
network consisting of drug similarity network, disease similarity
network and drug—disease interactions, is constructed. Last, based
on the heterogeneous network, BiRW is implemented to rank candi-
date diseases for drugs.

2.1 Dataset

The gold standard dataset used in this study is obtained from the
Supplementary Material of paper Gottlieb et al. (2011), which col—
lected comprehensive associations between drugs and diseases from
multiple data sources. For this dataset, there are 1933 known drug—
disease associations involving 593 drugs registered in DrugBank
(Wishart et al., 2008) and 313 diseases listed in the Online
Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) (Hamosh et al., 2002).

2.2 Similarity measures

The similarity measures can be described brieﬂy as follows: first, cal—
culate drug similarity Simrp and disease similarity Simdp based on
some drug—related properties and disease—related properties, respect—
ively; second, analyze and evaluate the predictive power of various
similarity values calculated above, and adjust these similarity values
based on the analysis results to obtain new drug similarity Simrz and
disease similarity Simdl; last, cluster drugs and diseases based on the
known drug—disease associations, respectively, then according to clus—
tering results, Simrz and 51'de can be further improved to obtain com—
prehensive similarity measures Sim, for drugs and Simd for diseases.

2.2.1 Drug similarity measure
Based on the description above, the similarity between drugs can be
measured in three steps.

MBiRW

 

Step 1: Similarity measured based on drug-related properties. In this
study, drug similarity Sim,p is calculated based on their chemical
structures. SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry
Specification) is a line notation for describing chemical structures,
the Canonical SMILES (Weininger, 1988) of all drugs are down—
loaded from DrugBank, and the Chemical Development Kit
(Steinbeck et al., 2006) is used to calculate the similarity of two
drugs as the Tanimoto score (Tanimoto, 1957) of their 2D chemical
fingerprints. According to Sim,p , known drug—disease association in—
formation is incorporated to improve drugs similarities in the fol-
lowing steps.

Step 2: Analysis of similarity. According to the findings that weak
similarities provide little information for prediction in previous
researches, we analyze the correlation between similarity Sim,p of
two drugs and the existence of their common diseases, and trans—
form similarity Sim,p which is not informative for prediction into
some value close to zero.

The correlation analysis procedure can be described as follows:
(i) the range of value of Sim,p, which is [0,1], is divided into ten
equal subranges. For each subrange, the percentage of drug pairs
sharing common diseases is calculated. (ii) All values of Sim,p are
randomly permutated for drug pairs using Fisher-Yates shufﬂing
(Fisher and Yates, 1938) to form randomized drug similarities, and
the percentage is calculated in the same way as step one. Overall,
the average of 10 randomized results is used as a control for back—
ground signal. (iii) Based on the above results, a similarity threshold
LSim is determined. That is to say, values of drug pairs whose simi—
larity value is smaller than LSim has a small probability of sharing
common diseases and thus is not informative for prediction. For Si
m,p of the gold standard dataset, the drug similarity correlation ana-
lysis result is shown in Figure 3(A). In our work, we adjust Sim,p by
applying the logistic function which has been used by Vanunu et al.
(2010) to modify the phenotypic similarities between diseases asso—
ciated with genes.

The logistic function is defined as follows,

1

where x denotes the value of Sim,p value, c and d are the parameters
which can be tuned to control the adjustment of Sim,p. Those small
similarity values can be transformed into some values close to zero.
At the same time, those large similarity values will be enlarged by 10—
gistic function. By applying the above procedure, drug similarity Si
m,p is transformed to new similarity Simrz.

Step 3: Clustering drugs based on known drug—disease associations.
As mentioned above, drug similarity Simrz has been obtained by ad—
justing Sim,p according to the similarity analysis results. Next, based
on the assumption that two drugs are more similar if they share indi-
cations, or there exist other drugs which share indications with them
simultaneously. The known sharing information can be further uti-
lized to improve drug similarity Simrz as follows.

First, we construct a new weighted drug sharing network named
as SdrugNet based on the known drug—disease associations. In
SdrugNet, let SR : {r1,r2, . . . ,rm} denote the set of m drugs, and
edge weight denotes the number of common diseases shared by cor—
responding drug pair. After that, we cluster SdrugNet to identify po—
tential drug clusters, and improve Simrz between drugs that belong
to the same cluster. As a graph clustering method, ClusterONE
(Nepusz et al., 2012) can identify cohesive modules in weighted net—
works and has been used to detect meaningful modules for drug

repositioning (Wu et al., 2013; Yu et al., 2015). In view of its good
performance in generating overlapping clusters for weighted net—
works, ClusterONE is adopted to identify clusters in our research.

The cohesiveness of a cluster V is defined by ClusterONE as
follows:

W1 (V)

((V) Z (Wm(V) + Wbound<v> + P(V))

 

(2)

where Win(V) denotes the total weight of edges within a group of
vertices V, Wbound(V) represents the total weight of edges connect—
ing this group to the rest of graph, and P(V) is the penalty term. The
quality of each identified cluster can be evaluated by cohesiveness of
the cluster.

We suppose that drugs belonging to the same cluster tend to be—
have more similarly. Here, for drugs r,- and r,- locating in the same
cluster C, QC represents the cohesiveness of cluster C, the compre—
hensive drug similarity Sim, between r,- and r,- is defined as w >I< Simrz,
where parameter w is set as (1 —I— QC). Moreover, for comprehensive
similarity between two different drugs which is equal or greater than
1, we replace it with 0.99.

2.2.2 Disease similarity measure

Disease similarity Simdp based on disease phenotypes is calculated
using MimMiner (Van Driel et al., 2006), which measure disease
similarity by computing similarity between MeSH terms (Lipscomb,
2000) appearing in the medical description of diseases from the
OMIM database.

Next, diseases similarity Simdp is improved based on the adjusted
approaches used in drug similarity measure. The correlation be—
tween the similarity of two diseases and the existence of their com—
mon drugs is firstly analyzed by taking known association
information into account, and new disease similarity Simdz is ob—
tained by adjusting Simdp based on the correlation analysis. Then,
disease sharing network named as SdiseaseNet is constructed based
on known drug—disease associations. In SdiseaseNet, let SD : {d1,
d2, . . . , dn} represents the set with n diseases, and edge weight de—
notes the number of common drugs shared by corresponding disease
pair. Diseases are clustered by applying ClusterONE on
SdiseaseNet, and Simdz between diseases which locate in the same
cluster is enhanced to obtain comprehensive disease similarity Simd
in the same way as for drugs.

2.3 Construction of the heterogeneous network

Based on the aforementioned similarity measures for drugs and dis—
eases, drug similarity network and disease similarity network are
constructed. In drug similarity network, let R = {r1, r2, . . . , rm} de-
note the set of m drugs. The edge between drugs r,- and r,- is weighted
by comprehensive similarity Sim, between the two drugs. In disease
similarity network, let D : {d1, d2, . . . ,dn} denote the set of n dis—
eases. The edge between diseases d,- and d,- is weighted by compre—
hensive similarity Simd between the two diseases.

Besides, the drug—disease associations can be modeled as a bi—
partite graph G(V, E), where V(G) : {R,D}, E(G) Q R x D,
E(G) : {e,-,-, edge between drug r,- and disease d,}. If there exists a
known association between drug r,- and disease d], the weight of
edge between r,- and d,- is initially set to 1, otherwise, it is initially set
to 0.

Obviously, the drug—disease network can be considered as a het—
erogeneous network, which is constructed by connecting the drug
similarity network and disease similarity network via the bipartite

erogeneous network is illustrated in Figure 1.

2.4 Implementation BiRW algorithm for ranking
candidate diseases for each drug
The drug—disease prediction process is modeled as a random walk
on the drug similarity network and disease similarity network simul-
taneously. Considering the diverse topology and structure character—
istics of different networks, the optimal number of random walk
steps on the two networks may be different. Therefore, two param-
eters l, r are introduced as the numbers of maximal iterations in the
left and right random walks on these two networks. The iterative
random walk process is described as follows.

Left walk in the drug network:

left_RD, = or x MR >< RD,_1 + (1 — or) x A (3)
Right walk in the disease network:
rig/ot_RD, = or x RD,_1 >< MD + (1 — or) x A (4)

where MRmxm, Mann and AM” denote adjacency matrices of drug
similarity network, disease similarity network and drug—disease as—
sociation network, respectively, m and n represent the number of
drugs and diseases, respectively. left_RD, and rig/ot_RD, represent
the predicted drug—disease associations based on walking on drug
similarity network and disease similarity network, respectively. The
value of element left_RD,(i,j) and rig/ot_RD,(i,/') denotes the prob—
ability that drug r,- associates with disease d,. In the iteration process,
RD, is the averaged output from left walks and right walks in each
step. The larger the value of RD,(i, j), the greater the probability
that drug r,- associates with disease d,- is. The complete MBiRW algo—
rithm for inferring potential drug—disease associations is outlined as
in Figure 2.

3 Experiments and results

In this section, we firstly introduce several common metrics used to
measure the performance of various prediction methods. By apply—
ing these evaluation metrics, we performed a comprehensive com—
parison of MBiRW with the other three methods on the gold
standard dataset. Then, case studies are conducted to confirm the
ability of MBiRW to find potential indications for drugs. After that,

Fig.2 Description of algorithm MBiRW. It takes R, D, A, the decay factor or, left
walk steps land right walk steps r as the inputs, then performs drug—disease
association prediction by iteratively updating the values of matrix RD accord-
ing to matrix MR, MD, A. In algorithm MBiRW, matrix SimR and SimD are
normalized by Laplacian normalization. For SimR, a diagonal matrix D5;mR is
defined such that D5,“); (i, i) is the sum of row iof SimR. We set normalized
matrix MR as .SimR‘l/2 *D5,mR*SimR‘1/2, the elements of MR is defined as

MR(i,j)=SimR(i,j)/(/D5,mR(i, i) >o< D5,mR(j,j). The same normalization procedure
is applied to matrix SimD, and then constructs the normalization matrix MD

to test the generalization ability of MBiRW, systematic evaluation
experiments are further conducted with the other two different
datasets.

3.1 Evaluation metrics
To systematically evaluate the performance of different methods, we
conduct tenfold cross validation, de novo prediction and independ—
ent dataset test. In the tenfold cross validation, all known drug—
disease associations in gold standard dataset are randomly divided
into ten subsets with equal size. In each cross validation trial, one
subset is taken in turn as the test set, while the remaining nine sub-
sets constitute the training set. After performing prediction, each as-
sociation is given a predicted score. According to the final predicted
scores, each known association between drug i and disease j in the
test set is ranked relative to the candidate associations (all associ—
ations which have not been verified to associate with drug i experi—
mentally until now). For a specified rank threshold, TPR (true
positive rate) is the fraction of known associations that are correctly
predicted, FPR (false positive rate) is the fraction of unknown asso—
ciations that are predicted, Precision is the fraction of known associ—
ations that are ranked within the rank threshold, and Recall is
equivalent to TPR. By varying the rank threshold, we can calculate
various TPR (true positive rate), FPR (false positive rate), Precision
and Recall values. Then receiver operating curve (ROC) and preci—
sion—recall curve (PRC) can be drawn based on these measure values
to show the performance of the different prediction approaches.

Considering the fact that the predicted top—ranked results are
more important in practice, we also measure the performance of all
prediction methods in terms of the top—ranked results, i.e. the num—
bers of correctly retrieved true drug—disease associations based on
various top portions. Usually, it is regarded as more effective if the
method can rank more true associations in top portions.

Currently, there are many experimental and withdrawn drugs
which have no explicit indications in drug—related database, while

MBiRW

 

these drugs have the potential to indicate some diseases. In our
study, de novo prediction test is performed to evaluate the effective—
ness of the prediction methods when predicting potential diseases
for new drugs (which have no any known associated indications).

3.2 Comparison with other methods

MBiRW is compared with the other three network—based prediction
methods: NBI (Cheng et al., 2012), HGBI (Wang et al., 2013) and
DrugNet (Martinez et al., 2015 ). NBI conducts prediction based on
a two—step diffusion model on a bipartite graph. HGBI is introduced
based on the guilt—by—association principle and an intuitive interpret-
ation of information flow on the heterogeneous graph. Although
NBI and HGBI were originally developed for drug—target associ—
ation prediction, while the authors have mentioned that these pre—
diction methods can also be applied in prediction of drug—disease
network. In addition, for drug repositioning applications, they have
been used to perform drug—disease association prediction in Wang
et al. (2014). DrugNet is a network—based drug repositioning
method, which is able to perform both drug—disease and disease—
drug prioritization. In this paper, these methods are evaluated and
compared using the same datasets, by cross—validation, independent
test set and de novo drug—disease prediction analysis.

3.2.1 Drug and disease similarity analysis

Based on the procedure of analysis on similarity described in previ-
ous section, we firstly perform the correlation analysis on drug simi-
larity Sim,p by considering known drug—disease associations
information of the gold standard dataset, the result is depicted
in Figure 3(A). Then, we conduct the similar analysis on
disease similarity Simdp in the same way, and the result is depicted in
Figure 3(B).

As we can see from Figure 3, drug pairs with similarity values
smaller than 0.4 have an insignificant probability to indicate com—
mon diseases, and drug pairs which have similarity values larger
than 0.7 have a a significant probability to indicate common dis—
eases. Then for drug similarity values x E [0, 0.4], we set L(x) % 0,
L(0) : 0.0001 and L(0.4) < 0.01, which determines d as
log(9999), and c as —11 in logistic function (1) for drug similarity.
Regarding Figure 3(B), disease pairs which have similarity values
lower than 0.3 have an insignificant probability to share drugs, and
those which have similarity values higher than 0.6 have a significant
probability to share drugs. Then for disease similarity values
x E [0,03], we set L(x) % 0, L(0) : 0.0001 and L(0.3) < 0.01,
which determines d as log(9999), and c as —15 in logistic function
(1) for disease similarity. Finally, we performed similarity trans-
formation by using logistic functions determined above to obtain ad—
justed drug similarity and disease similarity, respectively.

3.2.2 Tenfold cross validation

The impact of parameters used in MBiRW on the prediction per—
formance is first investigated by conducting cross validation, and the
detailed performance measurement results with various parameter
settings are reported in Supplementary Table S1. It shows that par—
ameter or ranging from 0.1 to 0.7 has little effect on the prediction
performance, and MBiRW achieves better performance when setting
parameter 1 equal to r. In this study, we set the parameter or to 0.3,
and l, r to 2 for MBiRW. The parameter (or = 0.4) of HGBI is set to
be that used in (Wang et al., 2013). The evaluation results of all
methods in terms of ROC curves and top—ranked results of all the
drug—disease associations, are reported in Figure 4. It should be
pointed out that, in each cross validation trial, we analyze drug simi-
larity and disease similarity, and cluster drugs and diseases again,
without using the information about the test drug—disease associ—
ations. In terms of AUC (the area under of ROC curve), MBiRW
(AUC: 0.917) performs better than other methods.

Moreover, the number of correctly retrieved drug—disease associ—
ations is shown in Figure 4(B). For a specified top—ranked threshold,
a true drug—disease association is considered as correctly retrieved if
the predicted ranking of this association is higher than the specified
top—rank threshold. Obviously, when focusing on the top—one re—
sults, MBiRW significantly outperforms the other three methods.
For example, among the 1933 true drug—disease associations, 586 of
them are predicted at the top one based on MBiRW. The top—ranked
predictions are particularly important in practice, so MBiRW can be
more useful than other methods. We also report the experiment re—
sults in terms of the precision—recall curves depicted in
Supplementary Figure S1, and MBiRW also shows better perform—
ance than other methods in precision and recall analysis.

In general, the prediction results of MBiRW illustrates that the
adjusted drug and disease similarities by integrating some prior
interaction information can significantly enhance performance of
prediction.

3.2.3 De novo drug—disease prediction

To evaluate the capability of MBiRW in predicting potential indica-
tions for new drugs, we conduct the de novo drug—disease prediction
test. In de novo prediction test, for each queried drug i, all known
drug—disease associations with drug i are removed. The performance
of a prediction method is evaluated by the rank of the removed
drug—disease associations relative to candidate associations with
drug i. In the gold standard dataset, each drug has at least one
known associated disease, then we perform de novo prediction test
for all drugs. The other three methods compared with MBiRW can
also be applied to predict potential diseases for new drugs. The ex—
periment results in terms of ROC curves and top—ranked results are
reported in Figure 5.

As we can see from Figure 5, MBiRW achieves an AUC value of
0.842, which is better than that of other methods in the same
experimental scenario too. Meanwhile, when focusing on the top—
ranked prediction results, among the 1933 known drug—disease as—
sociations, MBiRW predict 209 of them at the top one. For PR
curves analysis results in Supplementary Figure S2, it shows that
MBiRW also exhibits the optimal predictions. Overall, all de novo
prediction results show that our method can achieve the superior
performance.

3.2.4 Independent test set

We also investigate the performance of the various methods for
drug—disease association prediction on the independent test set. In
order to create the independent test set, the published drug—disease
associations are derived from KEGG (Kanehisa et al., 2014) data—
base and literature (Martinez et al., 2015) firstly. Then an independ-
ent test set with 144 new drug—disease pairs for 115 drugs can be
obtained after removing those associations existing in the gold
standard dataset. The test of independent dataset is conducted to
measure the performance of all prediction methods, by predicting
new drug—disease associations in the independent dataset. The test
results are reported in Supplementary Figure S3 in terms of ROC
curves, top—ranked analysis and PR curves. From these results, we
can clearly see that MBiRW achieves the best AUC value of 0.831,
and 15 new associations are ranked at top one. In addition, MBiRW
also outperforms other methods in terms of PR curves, and achieves
the highest precision. All these results shows that MBiRW achieves
the best performance on independent test set, which is consistent
with the evaluation on the gold standard dataset.

3.3 Measuring the effects of the comprehensive
similarity measures
The computation of comprehensive similarity measures includes
three steps as described in Section 2.2. We compare four methods
(BiRW1, BiRW12, BiRW13 and MBiRW) by cross—validation exper—
eiments. In these methods, various similarity calculation steps are
considered in similarity measures. For BiRW1, step one is involved
in similarity measures, which means only the drug— or disease—
related property information is used to calculate similarity. For
BiRW12, both step one and step two were implemented in similarity
measures, which means similarity measured by step one is adjusted
by corresponding similarity analysis. For BiRW13, both step one
and step three are taken in measuring similarity, which means simi-
larity measured by step one is adjusted by taking known drug—dis—
ease associations into account. For MBiRW, all three steps are
involved in similarity measures.

The comparison results in terms of ROC curve and top—ranked
results by these methods are depicted in Supplementary Figure S4. It

retrieved at the top one. While the AUC values of BiRW12 and
BiRW13 are 0.896 and 0.897, respectively, which means that pre—
diction performance can be improved by integrating known associ—
ation information into similarity measures. MBiRW outperforms all
other methods in terms of AUC values, top—ranked results and PR
curves, which further demonstrate the effectiveness of the compre—
hensive similarity measures.

3.4 Case studies

After confirming the excellent performance of our method based on
cross validation, the capability of MBiRW in predicting novel drug—
disease associations is further examined here. To predict novel indi-
cations for drugs, all the known drug—disease interactions in the
gold standard are used as the training set, and the remaining drug—
disease pairs which are not known to be associated in our gold
standard dataset formed the set of candidate drug—disease associ—
ations. By applying the method of MBiRW, we can obtain the pre—
diction scores for all candidate drug—disease pairs. MBiRW can
predict the potential associations for all the drugs simultaneously.
For each drug, the candidate diseases are ranked based on the pre—
diction scores, and the top—10 predicted diseases as prediction results
are collected. The predictions for all drugs are listed in
Supplementary Table S2.

Here, we randomly choose several drugs and present their pre—
dictions to conduct case studies. The prediction results are con—
firmed based on some public databases, current clinical trails and
literatures. The public databases include KEGG (Kanehisa et al.,
2014), DrugBank and CTD (Davis et al., 2015 ). In these databases,
some new added drug—disease associations provide a foundation for
our validation. For each of the selected drugs, the top—5 potential
diseases and evidences for the associations with the specified drug
are listed in Supplementary Table S3. We find that some top—ranked
predictions have been confirmed by existing researches. For in-
stance, Levodopa is predicted to treat Alzheimer’s disease, which
has already been tested in clinical trail (ClinicalTrials\.gov, 2006a).
Doxorubicin, indicated for non—small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), is
predicted to treat small cell lung cancer (SCLC). This prediction is
confirmed by CTD. In addition, for Doxorubicin, the prediction to
treat prostate cancer has been tested in clinical trail (ClinicalTrials\.
gov, 2006b). Cabergoline, indicated for Hyperprolactinemia, is pre-
dicted to treat Migrane, and this prediction has been studied in lit—
erature (Erkulwater and Pillai, 1989). Amantadine, indicated for
Parkinson’s disease, is predicted to treat Alzheimer’s disease, and
this treatment has been studied in literature (Cavestro et al., 2006).
In addition, Memantine, an amantadine derivative, is an N—methyl—
D—aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist used in the treatment of
Alzheimer’s disease. These successful prediction instances further
confirm that MBiRW has the potential to predict novel disease indi—
cations for drugs.

3.5 Experiments on other datasets
Most existing studies always conduct performance evaluation ex—
periments based on one specified dataset, and the adaptability of al—
gorithms for different datasets is ignored. To make the prediction
results more convincing, experiments mentioned above are further
conducted on another two datasets.

First, one new dataset, named as DNdatasets, is obtained from
paper (Martinez et al., 2015 ), which contains 4516 diseases anno—
tated by Disease Ontology (DO) terms, 1490 drugs registered in

91% ‘09 1sn3nv uo sojoﬁuv s01 ‘BTUJOJTIBD aIo Amie/trqu 112 /§.IO'SIBU.IT10[p.IOJXO'SOTlBIHJOJUTOTQ/ﬁdllq 11101; pop1201umoq

MBiRW

 

DrugBank and 1008 known drug—disease associations which were
derived from DrugBank. Besides, another dataset named as
Cdatasets, is produced by combining DNdatasets and the gold
standard dataset used in this paper. Cdatasets include 663 drugs
registered in DrugBank, 409 diseases listed in OMIM database and
2352 known drug—disease associations.

In DNdatasets, drug similarity Sim,p is measured based on ana—
tomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) codes, and disease similarity Si
mdp is measured based on Disease Ontology (DO) terms. In
Cdatasets, drug similarity Sim,p is measured based on chemical
structures and disease similarity Simdp is measured based on pheno—
types using MimMiner. The performance of MBiRW on DNdatasets
and Cdatasets is evaluated in terms of tenfold cross validation and
de novo prediction, respectively.

3.5.1 Validation on DNdatasets

Firstly, we perform tenfold cross validation to validate the perform—
ance of our method on DNdatasets, the experiment results are de—
picted in Supplementary Figure S5. The parameters used in MBiRW
are the same as those in experiments for evluating the gold standard
dataset mentioned above. Here, the parameter settings may not be
optimal for DNdatasets, and can be tuned to achieve the best results.
According to the cross validation results, the performance of
MBiRW and DrugNet is better than other methods, and the AUC
value of MBiRW and DrugNet is 0.958 and 0.948, respectively.
Although MBiRW only has slight better performance compared
with DrugNet in terms of ROC curves and AUC values, while there
has significant superiority of MBiRW over other methods in terms
of top—ranked analysis and precision results.

Moreover, de novo prediction test is also conducted on
DNdatasets. In DNdatasets, there are 550 drugs which have at least
one known association, so we perform de novo prediction for these
550 drugs. The prediction results are shown in Supplementary Figure
S6. Compared with tenfold cross validation results above, the AUC val—
ues of all methods in de novo prediction results improve slightly. The
reason may be due to the fact that DNdatasets includes many drugs
which have only one known association. In tenfold cross validation, all
known associations are divided into ten parts, each part is taken in turn
as the test set, and the remaining nine parts are served as the training
set. So there exists more than one drug, which has only one related dis—
ease and is considered as drug without known associations. However,
in each de novo drug—disease prediction, only the known drug—disease
associations for the queried drug are removed. That is to say, the num—
ber of drugs which have no known disease indications in de novo pre—
diction may be less than that in tenfold cross validation.

3.5.2 Validation on Cdatasets

For Cdatasets, the tenfold cross validation experiments for drug—dis—
ease association prediction are implemented, and evaluation results
are shown in Supplementary Figure S7. It can be seen from the re—
sults, MBiRW obtains AUC value of 0.934 and higher precision,
outperforming all other methods significantly. As seen from top—
ranked results, among the 2352 known drug—disease associations,
887 associations can be predicted at the top one by MBiRW. In con-
trast, only 427, 148 and 84 known associations are predicted at top
one by HGBI, NBI and DrugNet, respectively.

Each drug has at least one known indication in Cdatasets, so we
perform de novo prediction for all drugs, and the results are depicted
in Supplementary Figure S8. Compared with tenfold cross valid—
ation, we can find both the AUC values and top—ranked results be—
come worse in de novo test. For instance, the AUC value obtained in

tenfold cross validation achieved 0.934, however, the AUC value
only achieved 0.842 in de novo prediction. The number of top—one
predicted associations become 241, which is significantly less than
that in tenfold cross validation.

The superior performance evaluation results on DNdatasets and
Cdatasets, further demonstrate MBiRW is reliable in predicting po-
tential drug—disease associations. According to the above experi—
ments, we conclude that the prediction performance can be
improved by integrating more useful information in similarity meas-
ures and adopting BiRW algorithm.

4 Conclusion

Drug repositioning is a promising alternative for the drug develop—
ment. In this work, we have presented a novel method named
MBiRW uncovering the potential associations between drugs and
diseases. The main contribution of our study is that we have devised
novel similarity measures for drugs and diseases by integrating
known drug—disease associations information effectively, and per—
formed drug repositioning based on BiRW algorithm. The procedure
of the similarity measures involve calculating drug and disease simi—
larities based on some prior biological features; conducting correl—
ation analysis on similarity values, and adjusting similarity by a
logistic function based on the analysis results; clustering drugs and
diseases based on the known drug—disease associations, and improv—
ing drug and disease similarity based on the identified clusters.
Based on the calculated comprehensive similarities, drug network
and disease network are constructed. Furthermore drug network is
connected with disease network via known drug—disease associ—
ations to construct a drug—disease heterogeneous network. Finally,
BiRW algorithm is adopted to prioritize candidate diseases for each
drug and the effectiveness is validated on the collected datasets. In
cross validation, all experimental results show that our method can
effectively improve prediction performance compared with other
approaches. Case studies about several drugs indicate that potential
drug—disease association predicted by MBiRW could be more useful
for biomedical research.

MBiRW is one powerful computational method that can predict

candidate diseases for different drugs simultaneously, and also can
predict novel disease indications for drugs without any known asso—
ciated diseases information effectively. We have validated its predic—
tion power in terms of cross validation and case studies. While the
results of our approach are promising, its limitations should be
acknowledged. First, MBiRW only uses the known drug—disease as—
sociation information to improve the similarity of drug pairs and
disease pairs. It should be noted that there exists more prior biolo-
gical relevant information which can be reasonably utilized to im—
prove similarity measures. Second, considering that there exists
substantial targets data related with drugs and diseases, so we plan
to construct comprehensive heterogenous network for drug repos—
itioning by taking target information into account.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Existing association methods for rare variants from
sequencing data have focused on aggregating variants in a gene or
a genetic region because of the fact that analysing individual rare
variants is underpowered. However, these existing rare variant detec-
tion methods are not able to identify which rare variants in a gene or a
genetic region of all variants are associated with the complex diseases
or traits. Once phenotypic associations of a gene or a genetic region
are identified, the natural next step in the association study with
sequencing data is to locate the susceptible rare variants within the
gene or the genetic region.

Results: In this article, we propose a power set-based statistical se-
lection procedure that is able to identify the locations of the potentially
susceptible rare variants within a disease-related gene or a genetic
region. The selection performance of the proposed selection proced-
ure was evaluated through simulation studies, where we demon-
strated the feasibility and superior power over several comparable
existing methods. In particular, the proposed method is able to
handle the mixed effects when both risk and protective variants are
present in a gene or a genetic region. The proposed selection proced-
ure was also applied to the sequence data on the ANGPTL gene family
from the Dallas Heart Study to identify potentially susceptible rare
variants within the trait-related genes.

1 INTRODUCTION

The fundamental problem with rare variants [with minor allele
frequency (MAF) < 1%] is their low frequency, i.e. the limited
number of observed carriers lowers the statistical power to detect
phenotypic association with any single rare variant. Thus, almost
all existing statistical methods to detect disease/trait—associated
rare variants follow the framework of aggregating and testing all
rare variants in a gene or a candidate genomic region thereby

boosting the association signal (Bhatia et al., 2010; Chen et al.,
2012; Cheung et al., 2012; Ionita-Laza et al., 2011; Lee et al.,
2012; Lin and Tang, 2011; Liu and Leal, 2008, 2010; Madsen and
Browning, 2009; Neale et al., 2011; Price et al., 2010; Wu et al.,
2011). The existing methods try to improve this basic idea of
aggregating signals in two aspects: ﬁrst, by more potent extrac-
tion of signals from individual rare variants; and second, by
better aggregation signals extracted from multiple rare variants
in a gene or a genetic region of interest. Improvements of the ﬁrst
kind include upweighing variants as they become rarer (Madsen
and Browning, 2009) along with ﬂexibility of the threshold for a
rare variant (Price et al., 2010) and accommodation of both risk
and protective variants in a genetic region of interest (Ionita-
Laza et al., 2011). Methods for more powerfully aggregating
statistical signals include kernel-based adaptive clustering,
which assigns weights to multi- rather than single-site genotypes
(Liu and Leal, 2010), and the Co, test statistic, which contrasts the
observed versus expected variance of binomially distributed allele
counts (Neale et al., 2011), and regression-based models that
extract and aggregate signals (Lee et al., 2012; Lin and Tang,
2011; Wu et al., 2011).

However, these existing rare variant detection methods are not
able to identify which rare variants in a gene or a genetic region
out of all variants are associated with the complex diseases or
traits. Once phenotypic associations of a gene or a genetic region
are identiﬁed, the natural next step in the association study with
sequencing data is to locate the susceptible rare variants within
the gene or the genetic region. There have been a few testing
procedures based on the subset selection of rare variants such
as the variable thresholding (VT) (Price et al., 2010) and
RARECOVER (Rcover) (Bhatia et al., 2010) methods.
However, VT is not designed to select potentially causal variants
within a gene or a genetic region. Rcover collapses multiple rare
variants within a gene or a genetic region using the combined
multivariate and collapsing test (CMC) proposed by Liu and
Leal (2008). It has low power to identify causal variants when
both risk and protective variants are present within a gene or a
genetic region. Moreover, Rcover applies the Pearson’s x2 stat-
istic in the testing procedure, which may not be optimal for rare
variants and is limited to case-control designs only. Recently,
Bayesian hierarchical models have been proposed to estimate
the effects of rare variants under a regression framework
(Capanu and Begg, 2011; Yi et al., 2011), where Bayesian cred-
ible regions for regression coefﬁcients were provided to assess the

association of each individual rare variant. However, credible
regions for variants with low frequencies are too wide, indicating
the uncertainty for estimation. In addition, estimation results in
Bayesian analysis often rely on settings of unknown hyper-par-
ameters, and intensive computing is required all the time.

Zhou et al. (2010) considered the problem of locating suscep-
tible variants as a statistical variable selection problem, and at-
tempted to select both common and rare variants associated with
a disease outcome using a penalized regression model, where
regression coefﬁcients were regularised to select variants with
relatively high impacts on the outcome. In penalised regression
models, the total number of non-zero coefﬁcients is tuned by a
regularization parameter, so the choice of an optimal regulariza-
tion parameter is a crucial part of the ll-norm regularization
procedure. However, Zhou et al. (2010) did not try to select an
optimal regularization parameter, as common methods such as
cross-validation and resampling might not be applicable to rare
variants because of extreme sparsity. Alternatively, the authors
ranked the potentially disease-related variants with their impact
on the outcome. Thus, the method is essentially unable to sep-
arate potentially causal variants from non-causal variants within
a gene or a genetic region.

In this article, we propose a statistical selection procedure
based on the linear combinations of the power set of a set of
rare variants in a gene or a genetic region that is able to identify
the locations of the potentially susceptible rare variants within a
disease-related gene or genetic region. A stage I association test
ﬁrst identiﬁes the phenotypic association of a gene or a genetic
region using existing methods that aggregate multiple rare vari-
ants. The proposed method then selects the subset out of the
power set of all the rare variants that has the highest impact
on the outcome (either quantitative or qualitative).

The selection performance of the proposed method was eval-
uated through simulation studies, where different effect sizes,
sample sizes, and proportions of risk variants, protective variants
and non-causal variants were considered. We also applied the
proposed method to the sequence data of the ANGPTL gene
family from the Dallas Heart Study (DHS). Several studies
have worked on the DHS data and have already identiﬁed
some genes that are related to the traits (Cheung et al., 2012;
Liu and Leal, 2010, 2012; Price et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2011; Yi
et al., 2011). For example, associations between the ANGPTL4
gene and both triglyceride and very low density lipoprotein in
European American population have been suggested by several
studies (Liu and Leal, 2010, 2012). However, most of the existing
rare variant association tests have not tried to locate potentially
susceptible rare variants within the ANGPTL4 gene. Our pro-
posed selection procedure was able to select several potentially
causal rare variants within the ANGPTL4 gene that are asso-
ciated with triglyceride and very low density lipoprotein.

2 METHODS

Assume we observe the number of mutations over 1) rare variants in a
gene or a genetic region from a sequence data of n individuals. We denote
the dataset of the ith individual as (y,, x,, 11,-), i = 1, . . . , n, where
xi=(x,-1, . . . , x,-I,)T is the 1) dimensional counting vector with
xij 6 {0,1,2}, j=1,...,p and ui=(u,-1,...,u,-m)T is the m dimensional
covariate vector such as age and gender. The phenotypic outcome y,-

can be either quantitative or binary for case-control status, where y,- = 1
for cases and y,- = 0 for controls.

To generate K = 21’ — 1 subsets of the power set of the p rare variants
without the empty set, we introduce K weighting vectors for the p variants
denoted as 5k =(Sk1, . . . , Skpf, k= 1, . . . , K. We then code 0 as the exclu-
sion of a rare variant and 1 as the inclusion of a rare variant in
the weighting vector. For example, when p = 4, we have a total of 15
subsets in the power set without the empty set such as {xil}, {xiz}, {xig},
{x14}, {xi-1, x12}, {xi-1, xi3}r . ., {9612, x13, x14}, {x11,x12,x1-3,x1-4}. The corres-
ponding weighting vectors are then 51 = (1, 0, 0, 0)T, $2 = (0, 1, 0, 0)T,
s3 =(0,0,1,0)T,154=(0,0,0,1)T,é;5 =(1, 1, 0, of, 56 =(1,0, 1, 0)T,...,
$14=(0, 1, 1, 1)T, $15 =(1, 1, 1, 1)T, respectively. As we exclude the
empty set from the subsets of the power set, the K weighting vectors all
have at least one ‘1’ out of the p indicators.

We then deﬁne the new feature of the subset k for the ith individual as

p

_ *

Zik_E Skjwjxg,
j=1

where
* _ 1 — xij if variant j is potentially protective;
xij — { xij otherwise.
for k= 1, . . . , K. The new feature zik can be Viewed as a weighted linear

combination of the subset k, where variants included in the subset k are
combined. It is known that the association test on the weighted sum of
multiple rare variants could be underpowered if both risk and protective
variants are present in a gene or a genetic region (Pan, 2009). Han and
Pan (2010) proposed a data-adaptive procedure to take into account this
problem. In their procedure, potentially protective variants are ﬁrst iden-
tiﬁed Via marginal association tests. That is, each variant is tested one at a
time. If the regression coefﬁcients from the marginal association tests are
negative and the P-Value of the regression coefﬁcients <01, where or = 0.1,
was recommended by Han and Pan (2010) based on their simulation
experiments, then the variants are considered potentially protective. We
adopted this data-adaptive procedure to identify potentially protective
variants  We then ﬂip the coding of xij in the new feature 2,7C if variant
j is potentially protective. In addition to a binary weighting Skj e {0, 1},
we allow each variant to have a different weight col->0. For instance,
Madsen and Browning (2009) proposed to weight variants inversely pro-
portional to the SD of estimated allele frequencies, so that rarer variants
are up-weighted. Price et al. (2010) used the thresholds of the allele fre-
quencies. Recently, Lin and Tang (2011) showed that the estimated re-
gression coefﬁcient of an individual variant is an optimal weight with
relatively large sample.

Because each feature consists of a different combination of multiple
rare variants from the p rare variants in a gene or a genetic region, our
goal here is to ﬁnd the most putcome-related feature 21.]; among the K new
features. Ideally, the subset k contains only causal variants, i.e. $13. = 1 for
causal variants and 519:0 for non-causal variants. To select the most
outcome-related feature 21.]; among the K new features, we ﬁrst adjust the
quantitative or binary phenotype outcomes y, for the covariates u, by
ﬁtting a linear regression or a logistic regression, respectively. Let us
denote the ith residual from the ﬁtted regression by 37,-. We then individu-
ally test each feature 2,7, for association with the residual )7,- and choose
the one that has the maximum test statistic, i.e.

k = arg max T07, 27,),
15k5K
where )7 =()71, . . . ,fzn)T, 2k =(21k, . . . , znk)T, and T(a, b) is a test statistic
for association between a and b.

Several association test statistics such as a marginal test, a score stat-
istic (Lin and Tang, 2011) and a z-score (Price et al., 2010) can be applied
for T (-, -) to measure the strength of association between )7 and 2],. Here
we simply use a sample correlation between )7 and Z], to ﬁnd the most

outcome-related feature for computational speed-up. The feature having
the highest correlation with the outcome equivalently has the maximum
test statistic for testing a slope of linear regression of the outcome on the
feature.

One limitation of the proposed method is computational intensity for a
gene or a genetic region with a large number of rare variants. For ex-
ample, we need to compute and compare K > 106 number of test statistics
when P = 20. In the algorithm we developed, which we implemented in a
statistical software R combined with Fortran codes, it took only 1.38 s to
get the maximum statistic for both quantitative and binary outcomes with
P = 17 (K> 105) and 500 subjects, ~12s with P = 20 (K>106), and ~3.5
min with P = 24 (K > 107). When the analysis is limited to a handful of
genes, i.e. for disease-related genes that have already been detected by a
stage I association test, the proposed method is computationally feasible
to locate susceptible rare variants within the genes or the genetic regions.
For genes with extremely large number of rare variants, one potential
solution is to cut the gene or the genetic region with a large number of
variants into smaller segments ﬁrst, then apply a stage I association test
on those segments and perform the proposed power set-based selection
method to the signiﬁcant segments only to select potentially causal rare
variants. This way, the computational burden can be much reduced.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Simulation studies

We conducted simulation studies to evaluate the selection per-
formance of the proposed method for both quantitative and
case-control binary traits. We ﬁrst generated MAF of P variants
from the Wright’s distribution (Ionita-Laza et al., 2011; Madsen
and Browning, 2009)

ﬁg) Zcqa—1(1 _ q)6/3—1612(1—q),

where 8:0.001 and c is a normalizing constant. We focused
on rare variants with 0.001 5 q 5 0.01. Given the MAFs of
the P variants, genotype data (xil, . . . , xl-p) were generated
under Hardy—Weinberg equilibrium. The sample size was set at
n = 1000, 2000 and 5000. We considered equal numbers of cases
and controls in a case-control setting.

Similar to Wu et al. (2011) and Lee et al. (2012), we set the
regression coefﬁcients ,6], j= 1, . . . , p for p variants to have dif-
ferent values to separate causal (risk or protective) and non-
causal variants where

Vllog 10MAFjI,
  

if variant j is risk;
if variant j is protective;
0, if variant j is noncausal.

This setting assumes rarer variants to have larger effects, and
y>0 controls the effect sizes of causal variants. We set a se-
quence of y from 0.2 to 0.7 increased by 0.1. The average
effect sizes of the risk variants are ~avg(|,BJ-|)=0.5 for y=0.2
and avg(|,BJ-|)= 1.75 for y=0.7. Accordingly, the average odds
ratios of the risk variants with case-control outcomes are around
1.65 and 5.75, respectively.

We simulated the quantitative outcome of the ith individual
from the following regression model

)1, = 0.5ui1+ 0.5113 + ,31Xi1+ ,323612 + “‘ + 18ple + 6’

where covariate uil follows a Bernoulli distribution with a prob-
ability 0.5 and covariate Lil-2 follows a standard normal

distribution. An error term a was simulated from a standard
normal distribution. For case-control outcomes, we ﬁrst simu-
lated quantitative outcomes with twice of the required sample
size, and then set cases (11,-: 1) to be the top 25% of the quan-
titative outcomes and controls (11,-: 0) to be the bottom 25% of
the outcomes.

The total number of variants p within a gene was ﬁxed as 15,
each of which could be a risk (R), protective (P) or non-causal
(N) variant. We considered three variant-mix scenarios: (i)
5R/0P/10N, (ii) 3R/2P/10N and (iii) 5R/5P/5N. All simulation
results were summarized based on 1000 simulation replicates.
For each simulation replicate, we ﬁrst applied the SKAT associ-
ation test WVu et al., 2011) to assess the signiﬁcance of a gene. If
the association of a gene was identiﬁed (i.e. the P-Value of SKAT
is <0.05), we then applied the proposed selection procedure to
locate potentially causal variants within the gene. We considered
three versions of the proposed method: the power set-based se-
lection procedure that ignores the mixed risk and protective vari-
ants (Pset), the data-adaptive power set-based procedure that
adopts Han and Pan’s method to identify potentially protective
variants (aPset) and the weighted data-adaptive power set-based
procedure that gives different weights to different variants
(iset), where we used the weight proposed by Madsen and
Browning (2009). For comparison purposes, we also applied
Rcover (Bhatia et al., 2010) where the x2 test statistic was
replaced by a sample correlation with residuals, as the original
Rcover is limited to case-control outcomes and also cannot
handle with covariates.

In the ﬁrst simulation study, the averaged selection propor-
tions (ASP) of risk, protective and non-causal rare variants were
computed for Rcover, Pset, aPset and iset procedures with
three variant-mix scenarios, different effect sizes and different
sample sizes. In each simulation, the selection proportion of
risk variants is deﬁned as the number of selected risk variants
divided by the total number of true risk variants. The selection
proportions of protective and non-causal variants are deﬁned
similarly. ASP is then deﬁned as the averaged selection propor-
tion over 1000 simulations for each type of variants. The larger
the ASP of causal (risk and protective) variants and the smaller
the ASP of non-causal variants, the better the selection
performance.

Figure 1 shows the ASPs for causal and non-causal variants of
the three variant-mix scenarios when sample sizes 11 = 1000, 2000
and 5000, the trait is quantitative and the effect size is relatively
small, i.e. avg(|,BJ-|) =0.5. The power of SKAT for a group of 15
variants is included in each ﬁgure on the top right. We can see
that the power of SKAT increases as the number of causal (risk
and protective) variants, or the sample size increases. The ASPs
of the four selection procedures are similar when all causal vari-
ants are risk (A, D and G). However, when causal variants are
either risk or protective, difference among the ASPs of the four
selection procedures were noticeable. Speciﬁcally, Rcover and
Pset have low ASPs when the number of protective variants is
high (C, F and J). They selected <50% causal variants even when
the sample size is large because Rcover and Pset are not able to
identify causal variants correctly in the presence of both risk and
protective variants in a gene or a genetic region.

In contrast, aPset and iset selected most true causal variants
together with a few non-causal variants when both risk and

Fig. 1. Averaged selection proportions of risk (R), protective (P) and
non-causal (N) rare variants for RARECOVER (Rcover), power-set-
based (Pset), data-adaptive Pset (aPset) and weighted data-adaptive
Pset (iset) procedures when the outcome is quantitative and the
effect size is avg(|,8j|)=0.5. The sample size is n =1000 for A—C,
n = 2000 for D—F, and n = 5000 for G—J. There are 5R/0P/10N variants
in A, D and G, 3R/2P/10N in B, E and H, and 5R/5P/5N in C,F and J

protective variants are present. We noticed that ASPs of different
types of variants for aPset and iset were hardly affected by the
proportions of causal and non-causal rare variants. For example,
the ASPs of the non-causal variants of aPset are <25% when
n= 2000 and <15% when n= 5000 in all variant-mix scenarios
while those of iset are lowered by 3—5%. Because aPset and
iset use the data-adaptive procedure (Han and Pan, 2010) for
the initial screening of potentially protective variants, they may
not perform well for small sample sizes and effect sizes, as the
data-adaptive procedure is basically based on individual tests.
Supplementary Figures S1 and S2 in the Supplementary
Materials show ASP results when the effect sizes are
avg(|,BJ-|) = 0.75, and 1.0, respectively. In these settings, when
sample size and effect size are large, the ASPs of protective vari-
ants are almost the same as those of risk variants for both aPset
and iset and the ASPs of the non-causal variants are lowered
by ~3%. This might be because of the better performance of the
data-adaptive procedure for the initial screening of potentially
protective variants with individual tests when sample size and
effect size are large. Similar patterns for case-control binary out-
comes for the three effect size settings were observed in
Supplementary Figures S3—S5 in the Supplementary Materials.
We also considered an additional simulation study where there
is a big gene with 50 variants consisting of 10 risk, 5 protective
and 35 non-causal variants. All other settings such as the sample
sizes and the effect sizes remain the same as in the ﬁrst simulation
study. We ﬁrst applied the SKAT stage I association test for the
entire gene with 50 variants. Once a signiﬁcant association signal
is detected, we divided the gene into ﬁve segments so that each

segment has 10 variants. We then reapplied the SKAT associ-
ation test for each segment, and further applied Rcover, Pset,
aPset and iset for the segments with SKAT P-Values <0.05.
For segments that were not detected by the SKAT method, we
did not apply the selection procedure and considered variants
within the segments non-causal. Average selection proportions
of risk, protective and non-causal variants were summarized in
Supplementary Figures S6 and S7 in the Supplementary
Materials for quantitative outcomes and binary outcomes, re-
spectively. Similar to what we observed in the smaller gene set-
ting, the proposed aPset and iset have the best selection
performance in all simulation settings.

In the second simulation study, we computed the selection
power of each selection procedure, where the selection power is
deﬁned as the proportion that a procedure selects exactly all of
the causal variants among 1000 simulations. The probability of
randomly selecting only all of causal variants is
1/(215 — 1) w 0.3 x 10‘4 in each simulation replicate when the
exact number of the causal variants is unknown. Figure 2 dis-
plays the selection power of the four procedures as the effect size
avg(|,BJ-|) increases from 0.5 to 1.75 when the traits are case-
control binary outcomes. Two variant-mix scenarios: (i) 5R/0P/
10N and (ii) 3R/2P/10N were considered along with different
sample sizes (71 = 1000, 2000 and 5000). The corresponding selec-
tion power for quantitative outcomes is summarized in
Supplementary Figure S8 in the Supplementary Materials.

As expected, the power of both Rcover and Pset does not
increase at all as the effect size increases when both risk and
protective variants are present in a gene or a genetic region
(D—F). In fact, they never identiﬁed exactly all of the causal
variants in the variant-mix scenario (ii) 3R/2P/10N. When all
causal variants are risk variants, Rcover and Pset have slightly
higher power than aPset, as aPset could misidentify potentially
protective variants (A—C). In all scenarios, iset has the highest
selection power as expected, as the weight (Madsen and
Browning, 2009) was proposed for case-control outcomes to
boost association signals. For quantitative outcomes, the selec-
tion powers of aPset and iset are hardly different. Thus, the
development of a different optimal weight for quantitative out-
comes may improve the selection power of the proposed selection
procedure for quantitative traits.

3.2 Analysis of the DHA

We applied the proposed power set-based selection procedure to
the DHS data (Romeo et al., 2007, 2009). Coding regions of four
genes ANGTPL3, ANGTPL4, ANGTPL5 and ANGTPL6 were
sequenced to detect the association with nine energy metabolism
traits, namely triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL),
very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), high-density lipoprotein,
cholesterol, glucose, body mass index, systolic (SysBP) and dia-
stolic blood pressure. A total of 348 nucleotide sites of sequence
variations were discovered in these four genes, where the major-
ity of them are rare (MAF <5%). We focused on the European
American population to identify trait-related genes, and then to
identify potentially susceptible rare variants within the trait-
related genes.

We analysed the nine traits in two ways, either as the original
quantitative traits or as the binary case-control outcomes, where

(iset) procedures are displayed as the effect size avg(|,8j|) increases
when the outcome is binary (case-control status). There are 5 Risk/0
Protective/ 10 Non-causal variants in A—C, and 3 Risk/2 Protective/ 10
Non-causal variants in D—F. The sample size is n = 1000 for A and D,
n = 2000 for B and E, and n = 5000 for C and F

the case and control groups are deﬁned as the samples in the top
25th percentile and in the bottom 25th percentile, respectively.
Gender and logarithm transformed age were included in the
model as covariates. We also limited the analysis to the non-
synonymous rare variants with MAF g 3% (Liu and Leal,
2010, 2012). For the stage I association test to identify trait-
related genes, we applied VT (Price et al., 2010) and SKAT
WVu et al., 2011) methods for the four genes. We then applied
the proposed power set-based selection procedure on the identi-
ﬁed genes and the associated traits to locate potentially suscep-
tible rare variants within these genes.

Because for each of the quantitative or binary case-control
outcome we applied VT and SKAT to four genes to detect as-
sociation signals, a Bonferroni—adjusted signiﬁcance level
at = 0.05/8 = 0.0063 was used to claim any signiﬁcant association
signals. Two traits, TG and VLDL, are associated with the gene
ANGPTL4 at the multiple comparison adjusted signiﬁcance
level (Table 1). This association analysis result is consistent
with the result in a recent application of the DHS data (Liu
and Leal, 2012) where CMC, weighted sum statistic test
(Madsen and Browning, 2009) and VT were applied but only
to the quantitative traits. We then applied the four selection pro-
cedures (Rcover, Pset, aPset and iset) to identify potentially
causal variants within the gene ANGPTL4. Fewer number of
variants of the gene ANGPTL4 were included in the analysis
with the binary case-control outcome than the quantitative out-
come. This is because we included variants with at least one
mutation in both analyses. As fewer samples were included in
the binary case-control analysis, there were more variants with
no mutations in the binary case-control analysis.

The lists of the selected rare variants in the gene ANGPTL4
for the binary case-control outcomes are summarized in Table 2.
The lists of the selected rare variants in the gene ANGPTL4
for the quantitative outcomes are included in Supplementary
Table S1 in the Supplementary Materials. As the selection

result of Pset is exactly the same as that of Rcover in all analyses,
we omitted Pset in Table 2 and Supplementary Table S1. This is
because most of the rare variants in the gene ANGPTL4 are
singletons, thus summing p variants as in the proposed selection
procedure is not much different from collapsing p variants as in
Rcover. However, aPset and iset show quite different selection
results compared with Rcover. In the analyses of binary out-
comes, aPset selected three rare variants for TG and four rare
variants for VLDL whereas Rcover selected most of the variants
in the gene ANGPTL4. Consistent with the simulation results,
iset selected the same or fewer number of rare variants than
aPset did.

All four selection procedures selected the variant X1313_E40K
in the gene ANGPTL4 for the traits TG and VLDL. The variant
X1313_E40K has the largest difference in the number of muta-
tions observed between cases and controls for both traits. This
variant could be a candidate causal variant for future validation
study. aPset also selected the variants X6113_E190Q and
X8020_P251T for both traits and the variant X8262_S302fs for
the trait VLDL. For the three variants selected, there is only one
mutation in cases and no mutation in controls. Further investi-
gation is necessary for these variant. We also noticed that for the
variant X83 64_R336C, although there are two mutations in con-
trols and no mutations in cases for the binary trait TG (and three
mutations in controls and no mutations in cases for the binary
trait VLDL), it was not selected by either aPset or iset. This
may be because this variant was not identiﬁed as a potentially
protective variant by the data-adaptive procedure (Han and Pan,
2010) in the screening step. The variant X1313_E40K was iden-
tiﬁed as a potentially protective variant in the screening step and
its genotype coding was then ﬂipped. We observed the similar
results for the quantitative traits. Another pattern we noticed is,
Rcover selected all variants with more mutations in controls
(potentially protective variants) but did not select any variants
with more mutations in cases (potentially risk variants), which
may be owing to the strong effect of the potentially protective
variant X1313_E40K and the fact that Rcover does not handle
mixed effects.

Additionally, we also applied the proposed selection procedure
to the Hispanic population of the DHS sequencing data. Cheung
et al. (2012) have identiﬁed an association of the gene
ANGPTL5 with the SysBP in the Hispanic group although the

association P-Value is not extremely small. Our repeated analysis
using SKAT stage I association test has a P-Values of 0.0367 and
0.0370 for the quantitative and binary SysBP traits, respectively.
We then applied the four selection procedures to the gene
ANGPTL5 to separate potentially causal variants from non-
causal variants within the gene. The selection result is shown in
Supplementary Table S2 in the Supplementary Materials. It is
noticeable that in the analysis of binary SysBP trait, the pro-
posed selection procedures identiﬁed both risk and potentially
protective variants S93N, L98P and T268M, whereas Rcover
only identiﬁed two potentially protective variants L98P and
T268M. Moreover, Rcover selected two completely different
lists of variants for the quantitative and binary SysBP traits,
whereas aPset and iset performed consistent selections in
both analyses with the quantitative and binary traits.

4 DISCUSSION

In this article, we proposed a power set-based selection proced-
ure to identify the locations of susceptible rare variants asso-
ciated with complex diseases with sequencing data. The
proposed selection procedure not only aggregates multiple rare
variants to boost association signals, but also locates potentially
causal and noncausal variants within a disease-related gene or a
genetic region. Using the idea of the power set of all rare variants
in a gene or a genetic region, the most outcome-related subset of
rare variants among the power set is identiﬁed. Our simulation
studies suggested that the proposed power set-based selection

procedures (aPset and iset) are able to locate potentially
causal variants relatively accurately when both risk and protect-
ive variants are present in a gene or a genetic region. In the
analysis of the DHS sequencing data, the best subset of variants
selected by the proposed method are promising and could be
potential trait-related variants for future validation.

Selecting susceptible rare variants is statistically challenging
because of sparsity. To improve the selection performance of
the proposed power set-based selection procedure, there are
three potential extensions. First, we used the data-adaptive pro-
cedure (Han and Pan, 2010) to screen potentially protective vari-
ants. However, the procedure may not perform well when sample
size and effect size are small, as the procedure is based on a
marginal association test. We noticed in the simulation studies
that ASPs for both risk and protective variants could be im-
proved by a maximum of 10% (data not shown) if we knew
which variants are protective. Therefore, it is essential to develop
an improved procedure to identify potentially protective vari-
ants. Second, we used allele frequency weights (Madsen and
Browning, 2009) for iset and observed a similar performance
of iset and aPset in quantitative analysis. One possible explan-
ation is that this weight is designed for binary case-control
outcomes. Another possible explanation is that the weight is as-
signed on the individual variant level while the selection is on the
feature level. Thus, the variant-level weights may not inﬂuence
much on selecting the most outcome-related feature. The devel-
opment of optimal weights for each feature rather than each
variant may improve the selection performance of the proposed
method. Third, we combined variants within a subset using a
weighted linear combination. A recent publication by Chen
et al. (2012) has suggested that an exponential combination
might be more powerful than a linear combination to detect
rare variant associations when the number of causal variants
within a gene or a genetic region is small. In addition to the
improvement in the detection power, the exponential combin-
ation procedure (Chen et al., 2012) combines both risk and pro-
tective variants without the need of initial screening of protective
variants, as it is not affected by the directions of variants.
However, the numerical values of the exponential combinations
depend on the number of variants when the test statistics of
individual variants are exponentially combined, i.e. the more
the variants that are combined, the larger statistic it has. Thus,
the proposed power set idea cannot be directly applied to the
exponential combinations. Some modiﬁcation of the exponential
combination may be preceded to extend the proposed power set
method. To improve in these three areas are our future work.

Our proposed selection procedure can be easily applied to
different types of phenotypic outcomes. We limited an outcome
to be either quantitative or binary in this article. However, be-
cause our procedure is based on an association with regression
residuals, it is readily extended to other types of outcomes by
simply applying the generalized regression model.

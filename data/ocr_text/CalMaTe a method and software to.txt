ABSTRACT

Summary: CalMaTe calibrates preprocessed allele-specific copy
number estimates (ASCNs) from DNA microarrays by controlling
for single-nucleotide polymorphism-specific allelic crosstalk. The
resulting ASCNs are on average more accurate, which increases
the power of segmentation methods for detecting changes between
copy number states in tumor studies including copy neutral loss
of heterozygosity. CalMaTe applies to any ASCNs regardless of
preprocessing method and microarray technology, e.g. Affymetrix
and Illumina.

Availability: The method is available on CRAN (http://cran.r-project.
org/) in the open-source R package calmate, which also includes an
add-on to the Aroma Project framework (http://www.aroma-project.
org/).

1 INTRODUCTION

Several analytical pipelines for identifying total copy number (TCN)
events from DNA microarrays are available. However, certain types
of genomic alterations cannot be detected from TCNs, e.g. copy
neutral LOH events. The identiﬁcation of such events can be key to
our biological understanding of cancer development and our ability
to set up a personalized treatment plan (Albertson et al., 2003).
Genotyping microarrays (Affymetrix Inc., 2007; Peiffer et al.,
2006) quantify not only TCNs but also allele—speciﬁc copy numbers
(ASCNs), which are necessary to identify CN states such as copy
neutral loss of heterozygosity LOH. ASCNs are the CN estimates of
each allele variant (here A and B) at a particular (bi—allelic) single—
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). For the purpose of displaying
ASCNs along the genome and also for detecting CN changes,
ASCNs are often represented by their TCNs and B—allele fractions
(BAFs) (Bengtsson et al., 2010). For instance, for diploid SNPs in a

normal region, the expected TCN is 2 and expected BAFs are 0 (AA),
1 / 2 (AB) or 1 (BB). In a region of copy neutral LOH, the expected
TCN is 2 and the expected BAFs are 0 or 1. For a single—copy gain,
expected TCN is 3 and expected BAFs are 0, 1/3, 2/3 and 1. In
Figure 1, observed TCNs and BAFs are displayed along the genome
for a normal region, a gain and a region of copy neutral LOH.
Based on these type of data, segmentation methods (Chen et al.,
2011; Olshen et al., 2011; Staaf et al., 2008; Van Loo et al., 2010)
identify regions of constant CN state. Their performances depend
greatly on the signal—to—noise ratios (SNRs) of TCN and BAF
(Bengtsson et al., 2010), which in turn depend on the preprocessing
method used, e.g. dChip (Lin et al., 2004), CNS (Affymetrix Inc.,
2007), CRMAv2 (Bengtsson et al., 2009), ACNE (Ortiz—Estevez
et al., 2010) and ‘Illumina’ (Peiffer et al., 2006). Some of these

methods perform better than others. It would be favorable to borrow
strength between them, but in practice it is impossible because
the preprocessing methods are developed speciﬁcally for a given
SNP platform or chip generation. In addition, methods may also
be proprietary, making it infeasible for researchers to improve
upon them. A more sustainable solution for improving SNRs is to
instead develop normalization methods that operate on the ASCN
output of the aforementioned methods. For matched tumor—normal
SNP microarray experiments, Bengtsson et al. (2010) provide
the platform—independent TumorBoost method, which signiﬁcantly
improves the BAFs of the tumor. Here, we propose CalMaTe (for
Calibration Matrix T), which to our knowledge is the only ASCN
processing pipeline that is open source, cross—platform and that does
not require matched normals.

2 METHOD AND RESULTS

CalMaTe is a platform—independent multi—array method that controls for
SNP—speciﬁc systematic variation by modeling the crosstalk between alleles
in bi—allelic SNPs as explained next. Non—polymorphic loci (on recent SNP
array platforms) are normalized by a robust average across samples.

CalMaTe SNP model. The main assumption of CalMaTe is that cross—
hybridization between alleles is linear and possibly different between SNPs
but preserved across samples. Consider a SNP j = 1, ...,J , and let be the

2x1 matrix with column vectors (CAl‘j, CBl‘j)T of the unobserved true ASCNs
across all samples i=1,...,I. The corresponding observed ASCNs Hj can
then be modeled as

HjZWij-I—Sj, (1)
where Wj is an unknown 2X2 crosstalk matrix shared by all samples, and

ej is a 2x1 error matrix. This model and its estimation are outlined below
and explained in more detail in the Supplementary Materials.

Estimating the crosstalk. Wj can be estimated from a set of normal samples
(‘R’) for which the ASCNs (genotypes) are known, e.g.

C _ 2 1  0 1

11R— 0 1  2 1
where (2,0)T, (1,1)T and (0,2)T correspond to genotypes AA, AB and BB.
The set of possible states in HjiR is discrete and small, which is why

it is possible to estimate Wj. There is no such constraint on , which
is key when analyzing non—homogeneous samples such as tumors. Given
genotypes HER and observed HjaR, an estimate Wj is obtained by robustly
solving Equation (1) for Wj. CalMaTe calls the genotypes from HLR using
a naive genotyping algorithm. To minimize the impact of batch effects
(Scharpf et al., 2011), the reference samples are ideally in the same batch
as the other samples. If normal samples are unavailable, all samples can be
used as a reference. As long as the majority of the reference samples are
normal at any given SNP (not necessarily the same samples for all SNPs),
the robustness of the estimator warrants a good Wj estimate. We recommend
to use 6 or more reference samples (see also Supplementary Materials).

Calibration of ASCNs. Given an estimate Wj, the calibrated ASCNs, Hf,
are obtained from Equation (1) as the back—transformation H]? = TjHj, where
Tj =VAVj_1 is the 2X2 calibration matrix.

Results. CalMaTe was applied to the TCGA—ovarian cancer dataset
((alias?)). The DNA was hybridized to Affymetrix GenomeWideSNP_6
arrays and ASCNs were estimated using CRMAV2. In Figure 1, such
ASCNs are shown as TCNs and BAFs before and after CalMaTe. CalMaTe
improves the SNRs, as conﬁrmed by extensive ROC analysis (Fig. 2
and Supplementary Materials), which makes it easier for segmentation
methods to distinguish between different CN states. Similar improvements
are achieved for ASCNs from dChip as well as ASCNs originating from
Illumina, as shown in the Supplementary Materials.

3 CONCLUSIONS

CalMaTe normalizes ASCNs from any technology and
preprocessing method, and without requiring matched normals.
The normalized ASCNs are on average more accurate, resulting in
greater SNRs along the genome This enhances the power to detect
alterations such as LOH using segmentation methods. The method
is readily available in an open—source open—access R package,
which provides a low—level API for incorporating CalMaTe in
third—party solutions, as well as a high—level API for the Aroma
Project framework (http://www.aroma—project.org/) making it
possible to analyze an unlimited number of arrays.

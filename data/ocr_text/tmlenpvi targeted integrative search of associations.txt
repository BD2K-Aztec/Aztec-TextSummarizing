strong association between DNA copy number and gene expression accounting for DNA methyla-
tion in breast cancers.

1 Introduction

Looking for genes whose DNA copy number is ‘associated with’
their expression level in a cancer study can help pinpoint candidates
implied in the disease and enhance our understanding of its molecu-
lar bases. Genomic covariates may play an important role in the bio-
logical process and should therefore be taken into account. For
instance, DNA methylation is known to regulate gene expression.
To quantify the association between DNA copy number and expres-
sion, accounting for such relevant genomic covariates, Chambaz
et al. (2012) have crafted a new parameter and built a method to
infer it upon the targeted minimum loss-based inference principle
(TMLE). Coined by van der Laan and Rubin (2006), TMLE has
been applied in a variety of contexts (van der Laan and Rose, 201 1).
In this note, we describe the implementation of this method and its
genome-wide, integrative application.

Considering associations between DNA copy numbers and
expression levels in genes is not new (Andrews et al., 2010;
Louhimo and Hautaniemi, 2011; Pollack et al., 2002; Sun et al.,
2011; van Wieringen and van de Wiel, 2008). In contrast to these
earlier contributions, ours does explicitly exploit that DNA copy

number measurements feature both a reference level and a con-
tinuum of other levels, instead of discretizing them or considering
them as purely continuous. Moreover, we naturally handle multi-
dimensional, continuous covariates without discretization. We do
not need to assume that they are normally distributed, nor
that their true effect on DNA copy number and gene expression is
linear.

Methods

2.1 Presentation

We first define the statistical parameter that we wish to target. Let 0
= (W, X, Y) be a generic observation, where W, X and Y are respect-
ively the covariates (e.g. DNA methylation), DNA copy number and ex-
pression of a gene of interest in a randomly picked biological sample.
Let x0 be a reference value for X, corresponding to the normal state of 2
DNA copies. We assume that the probability to observe X = x0 is
bounded away from 0 and 1. We assume without loss of generality that
x0 = 0. In the absence of additional solid knowledge regarding the law
of O, we decide to focus on the following nonparametric variable

importance measure ‘I’. It is a mapping from M, the set of all laws com-
patible with the definition of O, to R given by

‘P(P) = arggrrléin EP{ (Y — EP(Y|X = 0, W) — ﬁX)2}.

Its counterpart neglecting W is a different mapping from M to R
given by

. 2 EP{XY}
.7-"(P) — argﬁergin Ep{(Y ﬁX) }— EP{X2}.
The parameter ‘I’ is pathwise differentiable in the sense that, for
every P E M, there exists a function V‘I’p of 0 such that for any
bounded s : OI—>s(O) and all |a| < ||s||;01, if we characterize P8 6 M
by setting dPg/dP = 1 + as then ‘I’(P8) = ‘I’(P) + eEp {V‘PP(O)
5(0)} + 0(a). Likewise, .7: is pathwise differentiable and associated
with v.73. In semiparametrics, VT and V]: are known as the effi-
cient influence curves of ‘I’ and .73. Both are known in closed-form.
The expression of VT involves finite- and infinite-dimensional
features of P, including (9p(X, W) = Ep(Y|X, W), gp(W) =
P(X = 0|W), MW) = Ep(X|W,X 7e 0) and 012, = EP{X2}.

2.2 TMLE Algorithm

Say that we observe n independent random variables 01,  ,On
drawn from P. They yield the estimator f” = 1 X,-Y,-/1 X,-2
of .7: Regarding the estimation of ‘I’(P), it consists in

1. initially estimating P with P2 and setting k = 0;

2. iteratively (a) constructing a one-dimensional model {Pﬁ(e) : |a|
< ||s||;01}M by setting dP5(s)/d1>g = 1 + as with s = va5, (b)

computing the corresponding maximum likelihood estimator 85,
and (c) deﬁning P5“ = P5095) and updating k <— k + 1 unless a
stopping criterion is met;

3. ﬁnally forming, by substitution, the TMLE estimator 1),, = ‘I’(P§)
where K is the last value of k.

Mild assumptions on P guarantee that 11—12:; V‘Ilpg (0,) z 0.
This is the pivotal property upon which the statistical study of 1),,
relies.

2.3 Inference

Under additional assumptions on P and on P5, (fmipn) satisfies a
central limit theorem (see Chambaz et al., 2012). Furthermore, it is
possible to estimate the corresponding asymptotic covariance ma-
trix, hence the asymptotic variances of 1),, and of (1% —  This
paves the way to the testing of “I’(P) = 0’ and of “I’(P) = .7-"(P)’
against some alternatives.

3 Implementation

Computing ‘I’(Pﬁ) by Monte-Carlo requires simulating a large num-
ber of couples (X, W) under PS and evaluating (9P)g at the simulated
values. A naive approach would rely on calls to all g1); , up; , (9P; for
l = 1, . . . ,k. This would be computationally expensive due to nest-
edness. Instead, we construct a law Hg with gm}; 2 gpﬁ, VH1: = V135,
0%,, = 012,: and such that, under US, X 6 {x1, ...n,xm}, where m is
uselr-supplied (defaults to 30), x1,  ,xm are empirical quantiles
of X, and W 6 {W1,  ,Wn}. The support of (X, W) consists of n
x m points known beforehand. Storing iteratively the vectors
campy-3., (VP5<VV,->>,S. and matrix (012w), Win-3mg. is suffi-
cient. Thus, we reduce the time complexity while keeping the space
complexity in O(n X m) instead of O(n2). Finally, computing ‘I’(Pﬁ)

requires simulating under H5 and retrieving the values of (9p): from
the stored matrix.

The series of updates is interrupted if the total variation distance
dTV(P§,P5+1), MP5) — \P(Pf,+1)|, or (Z; vaﬁ(o,—)| is small.
Sensible data-dependent renormalizations and default values quan-
tifying what ‘small’ means are given for each criterion in
tmle . npvi .

Running library (tmle .npvi) ; example (tmle .npvi) ;
in R demonstrates the use of tmle .npvi. The simulation relies on
synthetic data generated by perturbing real observations (Chambaz
et al., 2012).

4 An application to TCGA data

As an illustration, we study a breast cancer data set from The
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Network (2012). We downloaded
DNA methylation (W), DNA copy number (X) and expression (Y)
of 11 314 genes for n = 463 patients from https://tcga-data.nci.nih.
gov/docs/publications/brca_2012. The dimension of W is the num-
ber of CpG loci in the gene’s promoter region, which can vary from
one gene to another. Conveniently, our implementation handles
multi-dimensional covariates.

Figure 1 presents the (—log10) p-values of the bilateral tests of
“I’(P) = .7-"(P)’ for the 10 246 genes without missing data against
their genomic position. A pattern emerges of regions featuring very
small P-values, among which chromosomes 1q, 8, 16q. The pattern
is not correlated to the marginal distribution of X, represented in the
background. We also compute the partial correlation of X and Y
given W for each gene (not shown). No pattern emerges. This sug-
gests that the approach we propose may be useful to identify novel
regions worthy of interest.

For this data set, the typical run time of the method for a single
gene with the default options of the package is 10 seconds on a
standard laptop. The total run time for analyzing all 10 246 genes
was 42 CPU hours. Obviously, this analysis can be parallelized very
easily, as each gene is treated independently of all the other ones.

5 Conclusion

We have described the implementation of the method introduced by
Chambaz et al. (2012). We have also demonstrated its genome-wide
application to the integrative search of new regions with strong asso-
ciation between DNA copy number and gene expression accounting
for DNA methylation in breast cancers. The interest of the param-
eter ‘1’ goes beyond the specific genomic context of this note, as it is
designed to quantify the effect of any continuous exposure X with a
reference value x0 on any continuous outcome Y accounting for pos-
sibly multi-dimensional, relevant covariates W.

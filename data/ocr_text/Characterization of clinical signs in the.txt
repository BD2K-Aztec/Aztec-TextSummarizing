Abstract

Motivation: Many diseases are related by shared associated molecules and pathways, exhibiting
comorbidities and common phenotypes, an indication of the continuous nature of the human
pathological landscape. Although it is continuous, this landscape is always partitioned into discrete
diseases when studied at the molecular level. Clinical signs are also important phenotypic descrip—
tors that can reveal the molecular mechanisms that underlie pathological states, but have seldom
been the subject of systemic research. Here, we quantify the modular nature of the clinical signs

associated with genetic diseases in the human interactome.

Results: We found that clinical signs are reflected as modules at the molecular network level, to at
least to the same extent as diseases. They can thus serve as a valid complementary partition of the
human pathological landscape, with implications for etiology research, diagnosis and treatment.

1 Introduction

Disease—associated phenotypes, also known as clinical signs, are
commonly used in clinical practice to describe pathological mani—
festations. These signs help in the differential diagnosis and treat—
ment of a patient, enabling identification of a particular disease.
Diseases can thus be regarded as a special and important type of
pathological phenotype.

Most work on the molecular basis of pathologies has focused
on diseases or syndromes, instead of clinical signs. This is the
case, e.g. in the determination of the genetic variations associated
with a given disease (Civelek and Lusis, 2014). Some exceptions
include the analysis of quantitative traits (Plomin et 61]., 2009)
(such as height, body mass index, erythrocyte count) or certain
common clinical manifestations (alopecia, hearing loss, cardiac
arrhythmias).

Diseases are the basic pathological units in the systemic
approaches to human pathologies from a network perspective
(Furlong, 2013; Piro, 2012). Nevertheless, clinical signs can also be
valid, useful descriptors of the human pathological landscape, cur—
rently neglected by its traditional partitioning into distinct diseases.
If that is the case, partitioning the human pathological landscape

into clinical signs should result in a clear link between the molecular
and physiological levels.

Clinical signs are thought to be reﬂected at the molecular net—
work level, possibly to an even greater extent than diseases. There
are numerous examples of diseases or groups of diseases with similar
phenotypes caused by functionally related genes (Oti and Brunner,
2007). Previous studies observed a correlation between disease simi—
larity as measured by common phenotypes/clinical signs and their
similarity due to common molecular mechanisms (such as shared
genes, protein interactions, etc.) (van Driel et 61]., 2006; Zhou et 61].,
2014). In a recent study, Menche et al. (2015) provided evidence for
the disease module hypothesis, demonstrating that genes associated
with different diseases appear as distinct modules in the still incom—
plete human interactome. While most of the diseases studied ap—
peared as separate modules, some overlap.

Here, we quantify the extent to which clinical signs, not diseases,
are reﬂected in the human interactome. Due to the lack of data on
the genetic basis of most clinical signs, we built a dataset of gene—
clinical sign relationships through the genetic diseases they are
linked to. As most genetic diseases are monogenic, it is reasonable to

assume that these genes are pleiotropic and make an important con-
tribution to the clinical sign observed. We found that clinical signs
are modular. This dataset also allowed us to establish relationships
between distinct clinical signs and to compare these relationships
with those obtained from shared genes. We find significant overlap
in neighborhoods between clinical signs and between signs and com—
plex diseases.

2 Methods

2.1 Mapping clinical signs on the interactome

We compiled clinical signs and their disease associations from the
Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) (Kohler et 61]., 2014). Clinical
sign—gene associations were inferred from the phenotype—disease re—
lationships defined in HPO, as well as the disease—gene linkages
available at OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man)
(McKusick, 2007) and Orphanet (Orphadata: Free access data from
Orphanet © INSERM 1997. Available on http://www.orphadata.
org). In this way, a gene was linked with a phenotype if it is associ—
ated with at least one disease with the observed phenotype. Gene—
phenotype associations were further transferred to the parent terms
of a given phenotype in the HPO hierarchy.

We studied only those phenotypes under the ‘Phenotypic abnor—
mality’ category with at least 25 associated genes in our dataset.
This threshold was established in a previous study of diseases
(Menche et 61]., 2015) to account for observable modules in the cur—
rent incomplete interactome. We further filtered out redundant
phenotypes. Two phenotypes were considered identical if they were
associated with exactly the same set of genes. A total of 1474 clinical
signs (belonging to ‘Phenotypic abnormality’ in HPO) were associ—
ated with at least 25 genes. These correspond to 1433 distinct signs
(non—redundant gene sets), which we analyzed.

Genes associated with clinical signs were mapped to the corres—
ponding proteins in the human interactome obtained from the
supplementary data of Menche et al. (2015). This interactome inte—
grates several types of relationships, including literature (88 349),
protein—protein physical interactions (28 653), protein complexes
(31 276), regulatory interactions (1335), enzyme—coupled inter—
actions (5325), kinase—substrate pairs (6066) and signaling inter-
actions (32 706).

2.2 Measuring localization

In the interactome, each clinical sign is represented as a subnetwork.
We used two measures to quantify the modular nature of each sub—
network, as defined for the analysis of diseases (Menche et 61].,
2015»

° Module size (Si), calculated as the size of the largest connected
component.

° Inner distance (di): for each node in the subnetwork, we calcu—
lated the shortest distance to another subnetwork node to obtain
a distance distribution P(d). We then calculated di as the mean
value of P(d).

For both measures, we calculated their statistical significance fol-
lowing the mathematical formalism described for the analysis of dis—
eases (Menche et 61]., 2015). Briefly, Si and di values were compared
with those obtained in a null model. Null models were based on ran—
dom assignments of ni proteins in the interactome to a clinical sign
of size ni (genes). Statistical significance with random expectation
was calculated using 10, 000 randomizations.

For module sizes (Si), z—score statistics was used to assess
significance:

Si _ <Sirand>

0(Srand) 

z — score =
where (Si’“"d> and 0(Sir‘md) correspond to the mean value and
standard deviation of the random expectation Pmmf (Si).

For inner distances (di), we calculated the P value with the
Mann—Whitney U test, comparing P(d) with the random distribu—
tion Praml 

Significance thresholds (Si z—scoreZ 1.6 and di p—val< 0.05)
were established as in Menche et al. (2015 ).

2.3 Measuring relationships
We calculated the network—based separation Sab of two clinical
signs a and b as defined in Menche et al. (2015):

(dad) + (dbl)

Sab = (dab) — 2

(2)
where (dad) and (dbb) are the mean shortest distances within a and b
clinical signs, respectively, and (dab) is the mean shortest distance
between a and b.

We assessed the significance of all pairs, comparing Sab to the
network separation obtained for a null model (by random assign-
ment of proteins to two subnetworks). We performed 1000 random—
izations and calculated the z—score. A significance threshold z—score
<—1.65 was established for overlapping pairs (56119 < 0), as in
Menche et al. (2015).

To quantify the relationships between clinical signs and complex
diseases, we obtained gene associations to complex diseases from
the DisGeNet (Pinero et 61]., 2015 ). The network—based separation
Sab of a clinical sign a and a disease b was then calculated as above
(Eq. 2).

3 Results

3.1 Clinical signs localization

We analyzed clinical signs as defined in the HPO, which provides a
thorough ontology of clinical signs as well as their association to
genetic diseases as defined in curated databases (such as OMIM and
Orphanet). These curated data allowed us to establish gene associ—
ations to 1433 distinct signs that represent non—redundant gene sets.

To assess whether clinical signs (HPO phenotypes) are modular
in the human interactome, we measured the size (Si) of the largest
connected component formed by their associated genes in the inter—
actome. We also measured the inner distance (di), defined as the
mean distance to the closest phenotype protein.

Based on expected deviation of size (Si) and inner distance (di)
from random, we found a total of 1154 significantly modular clin-
ical signs (Si z—score 21.6 and di p—val < 0.05 ). Most signs
(80.53%) are therefore modular according to both measures.
Considering only one measure, 1169 signs were significant accord—
ing to size (Si z—score 2 1.6) and 1356 according to distance (di
p—val < 0.05 ), with module size thus being the most stringent criter-
ion. Detailed results for all phenotypes analyzed are found in
Supplementary Table 81.

As an example, Figure 1 shows the genes associated with the
‘café-au lait spot’ phenotype (HPOz0000957) and their interactome
context. This is a highly modular phenotype according to our meas—
ures (Si z—score:32.16, di p—val : 2.09e—35). This module in—
cludes many genes related to signaling pathways and cancer, as well

Clinical signs in the human interactome

Fig. 1. Example of a modular clinical sign: café-au-lait spots. Genes associated with diseases that report this sign are mapped in the human interactome. The
module consists of 61 protein products (large dark circles), with a largest connected component (Si) of 44 proteins, and inner distance (di) of 1.20. Intermediate
nodes that link otherwise isolated protein products (those with inner shortest path length > 1) are shown as small light circles.

as other known complexes such as BUB1, 1B and 3 (involved in the
mitotic checkpoint), the FAN complex (a nuclear pore complex
related to Fanconi anemia) and succinate dehydrogenase (not con-
nected with the rest). An enrichment analysis of this gene set reports
‘nucleus’, ‘DNA repair’ and various signaling pathways as the key-
words enriched in the set (not shown). Café—au-lait spots are in
many cases due to abnormal melanocyte proliferation and differenti-
ation. Consequently, the modular nature of CSs can be used, e.g. to
extend the set of genes associated to them (as previously done for
diseases) so as to obtain more information on their molecular basis.

Only 60 clinical signs (4.19%) are not modular according to any
measure. This might be due network incompleteness in the specific
regions that affect these clinical signs, or to the fact that some of
these signs are not clearly reﬂected at the molecular level.

3.2 Clinical signs relationships

We explored the degree of overlap between clinical signs in the inter-
actome by calculating the network-based separation (Sab) of two
clinical signs, a and b, and their statistical significance. A pair of
clinical signs overlap if Sab < 0.

Due to the way we constructed the clinical sign—gene associ-
ations, we anticipated a large degree of overlap between signs. For
example, all HPO phenotypes associated with a disease will share
genes (those associated with the disease). Due to the HPO hierarchy,
a parent phenotype will also contain all the genes associated with its

children phenotypes; building relationships among HPO phenotypes
based on shared genes will thus report all those linkages. More inter-
esting are the potential relationships between clinical signs defined
only by network neighborhoods. We therefore focused on the rela-
tionships between the most specific modular clinical signs in our set
(comprising 510 HPO phenotypes), among which there are no
parent—child relationships in HPO.

A total of 22,162 pairs (17.11%) showed significant overlap
(z-score <-1.65 and Sab <0) (see Supplementary Table 82), while
the remaining overlapping pairs (11 946, 9.22%) were not statistic-
ally significant. Most pairs (73 850, 57.01%) are significantly non-
overlapping or non-overlapping but not significant (21 582,
16.66%).

Supplementary Table 2 lists the pairs of clinical signs related in
the interactome (significant overlap). The table is sorted by the
z-score of the Sab parameter and the number of shared genes, to pin-
point the most interesting cases of clinical signs that do not share
associated genes but are close in the interactome. This is the case of
the relationship between ‘wormian bones’ (small extra bones in the
cranium, HP:0002645) and ‘abnormality of intracranial pressure’
(HP:0012640), supported by eight interactions and with no shared
genes. These two symptoms are not related in the HPO hierarchy;
whereas ‘wormian bones’ belongs to the ‘abnormality of skeletal
system’ branch, ‘abnormality of intracranial pressure’ is classified
within ‘abnormality of the nervous system’.

3.3 Clinical signs—complex disease relationships

To identify network—based relationships between clinical signs and
complex diseases, we first obtained diseases and their associated
genes from DisGeNet (Pinero et al., 2015), an integrated resource
that compiles information from several public databases and the lit—
erature. Supplementary Table S3 lists the relationships between dis—
eases and clinical signs extracted from the interactome. Again, the
most interesting cases are those relationships supported by inter—
actions that share very few genes or no genes at all. An example is
‘celiac disease’ (umlszC0007570), which is linked to a number of
symptoms such as those involving lung problems. A literature and
web search showed that such relationships were indeed reported in
specific cases (Tarlo et al., 1981). According to our data, celiac dis—
ease is also related to the ‘vasculitis’ clinical sign (inflammation of
blood vessels, HP:0002633). This relationship was also reported for
specific cases (Caproni et al., 2012; Holdstock and Oleesky, 1970;
Meyers et al., 1981); Figure 2 shows the set of genes associated with
both features and their interactions. Celiac disease and vasculitis
have two genes in common (Fig. 2, purple) and three interactions
(wide lines). The Wiskott—Aldrich syndrome (WAS) protein is
involved in transduction of membrane receptor signals to the actin
cytoskeleton, and the inducible T—cell costimulator (ICOS) is a cell
receptor involved in enhancing T—cell responses to antigens. Both
are related to vasculitis, and interact respectively with the ETS1
transcription factor (involved in cell proliferation, death and cancer)
and the ICOSLG (ICOS ligand, a signaling molecule that enhances
T—cell activity). The third interaction is between CD80 (another
membrane receptor involved in T—cell proliferation), associated with
celiac disease and CTLA4 (also a membrane receptor involved in
T-cell inhibition), which is associated with both celiac disease and
vasculitis. These interactions, together with the other shared gene
(HLA-DPB1, a member of the MHC-II complex involved in antigen
presentation), can provide a molecular explanation for the relation-
ship between celiac disease and vasculitis, reported in particular
cases, and possibly a way to target this disease symptom in certain
patients.

4 Discussion

Here, we analyzed the organization of clinical signs associated with
genetic diseases in the human interactome, and found that the clin—
ical manifestations of these diseases form modules in the interac—
tome. The size (Si) and compactness (di) of the modules differ due to
the current coverage of the known interactome and to the nature of

the clinical signs, but in most cases (80.5 3%) Si and di deviate from
random expectation with the most stringent criteria.

We applied the same mathematical formalism developed to esti—
mate the modular nature of a set of complex diseases and groups of
diseases (Menche et al., 2015 ). In their study, Menche et al. analyzed
diseases and their relationships, and showed that diseases that over—
lap in the interactome have more similar clinical signs that those
that do not. We found that some clinical sign modules overlap with
disease modules, and that some of these overlaps are statistically
significant.

Our results show that not only genes associated with complex
diseases are modular in the interactome, as demonstrated previ—
ously, but also genes associated with clinical signs. This offers new
alternatives to the study of pathological states of common diseases
and their association to genetic determinants, especially for the de—
velopment of personalized medicine, as it will allow better under—
standing of a given disease manifestation in a given patient (with a
specific set of signs and symptoms) and its relationship with the gen-
etic variations found.

As the human pathological landscape is partitioned into distinct
clinical signs as well as into diseases, both can serve as targets for
the study of pathological states using molecular network concepts.
For diseases with no existing or immediately foreseeable treatments,
one could devise ways of targeting some clinical signs by looking at
their associated genes and network modules. As the human patho—
logical landscape is a continuum, it can and should be explored be—
yond traditional disease definitions and classifications.

In conclusion, our results show that clinical signs associated with
genetic diseases appear as modules in the interactome, and some
show significant overlap. As such, they can be used to identify mo—
lecular mechanisms that could explain the manifestations of more
complex diseases. To quote Oti et al. ‘ . . . we have traditionally split
the human phenome into discrete entities called diseases, instead of
searching for common pathogenetic mechanisms that link diseases
together [ . . . ] However, there is more to the human phenome than a
list of diseases’. Partitioning the human pathological landscape into
other (molecularly supported) entities could help to approach diag—
nosis and treatment of disease states from a new perspective.

In July 2013, more than 100 bioinformatics researchers, devel-
opers and users of Open Source Software gathered in Berlin,
Germany, to attend the 14th Annual Bioinformatics Open
Source Conference (BOSC, http://www.open—bio.org/wiki/
BOSC_2013, Harris et al., 2013). Since its inception in 2000,
BOSC has provided bioinformatics developers with a forum
for communicating the results of their latest efforts to the
wider research community, and a focused environment for de-
velopers and users to interact and share ideas about standards,
software development practices and practical techniques for sol-
ving bioinformatics problems. BOSC includes a 2 day ‘CodeF est’
preceding the formal conference, which provides a venue for
developers to meet in person to work on or plan joint projects
(Moller et al., 2013).

The session topics at BOSC 2013 included Cloud and Parallel
Computing, Visualization, Software Interoperability, Genome-
scale Data Management, a session for updates on ongoing
Open Source projects and two new sessions: Open Science and
Reproducible Research and Translational Bioinformatics, recog-
nizing the growing use of computational biology in medical ap-
plications. Slides from all of the presentations are available on
the BOSC Web site, along with some of the posters and video
recordings for selected talks, including the keynotes and panel
discussion.

Open Science is a movement dedicated to making all aspects of
scientiﬁc knowledge production freely available for reuse and
extension, including scientiﬁc data, methods and analyses. In
response to the increasing traction that this movement has
gained, BOSC 2013 featured a new session devoted explicitly
to Open Science. One of the objectives of Open Science is the
wider issue of making published research reproducible. Aside
from openness in software licensing, this also includes openness
of data and unhindered access to scientiﬁc papers themselves
(Open Access). When researchers can freely access publications
and the source code and data that support them, it becomes
possible for them to recreate the steps that the authors went

through to reach their conclusions and to then go beyond
them. In this way, Open Science not only stands to provide the
value of validating published results by recreating them but also
to accelerate the pace of scientiﬁc discovery, by enabling re-
searchers to more effectively build on the results of previous
work, rather than having to reinvent tools and reassemble
datasets.

Each day of BOSC traditionally starts off with a keynote
talk by a person of inﬂuence in Open Source bioinformatics.
BOSC 2013’s ﬁrst keynote speaker was Cameron Neylon,
the Advocacy Director for the Public Library of Science, who
is a prominent advocate for open science. Neylon discussed the
cultural issues that are hindering open science, and spoke about
the potential of openness in scientiﬁc collaborations for generat-
ing impact. Our second keynote speaker was Sean Eddy, a group
leader at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s J anelia Farm,
who is perhaps best known as the author of the HMMER soft-
ware suite (Eddy, 2011). He discussed how his own experience
and practices show that dedicating effort to thorough engin-
eering in tool development—which is often shunned as uninter-
esting and unpublishable—can be a key to creating a lasting
impact.

To stimulate discussion on controversial or
multifaceted topics, BOSC includes a panel, in which panelists
representing a range of viewpoints, answer questions from the
audience. This year’s panel was on Strategies for Funding and
Maintaining Open Source Software. To secure continued
funding for a software project, researchers must be able to
demonstrate its impact. The panelists explored ways to
quantify usage of one’s software as a measure of impact.
They agreed that traditional publications, and tracking their
citations, still play an important role in publicizing and demon-
strating the use of one’s software, but they are not the only
metric.

With the increasing reliance of more and more ﬁelds of biol-
ogy on computational tools to manage and analyze their data,
BOSC seems assured to stay relevant to life science, and thus to
life scientists.

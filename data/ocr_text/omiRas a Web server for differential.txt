ABSTRACT

Summary: Small RNA deep sequencing is widely used to characterize
non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) differentially expressed between two con-
ditions, e.g. healthy and diseased individuals and to reveal insights into
molecular mechanisms underlying condition-specific phenotypic
traits. The ncRNAome is composed of a multitude of RNAs, such as
transfer RNA, small nucleolar RNA and microRNA (miRNA), to name
few. Here we present omiRas, a Web server for the annotation, com-
parison and visualization of interaction networks of ncRNAs derived
from next-generation sequencing experiments of two different condi-
tions. The Web tool allows the user to submit raw sequencing data
and results are presented as: (i) static annotation results including
length distribution, mapping statistics, alignments and quantification
tables for each library as well as lists of differentially expressed
ncRNAs between conditions and (ii) an interactive network visualiza-
tion of user-selected miRNAs and their target genes based on the
combination of several miRNA—mRNA interaction databases.
Availability and Implementation: The omiRas Web server is imple-
mented in Python, PostgreSQL, R and can be accessed at: http://
tools.genxpro.net/omiras/.

1 INTRODUCTION

Non-coding ribonucleic acids (ncRNAs) are functional mol-
ecules that do not code for a protein, but play important roles
in normal development, physiology and disease (Stefani and
Slack, 2008). The ncRNAome is grouped into RNAs of different
functions. Among them, microRNAs (miRNAs), which have
gained attention due to their implication in the development of
diseases like cancer or cardiovascular problems (Lu et al., 2008).
MiRNAs can repress gene expression through translational re-
pression or messenger RNA (mRNA) deadenylation and decay.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) offers unbiased insights into
the small non-coding transcriptome by small RNA-Sequencing
(sRNA-Seq). Several Web services, like DARIO (F asold et al.,
2011), wapRNA (Zhao et al., 2011) or ncPRO-seq (Chen et al.,
2012) have been developed for the annotation and quantiﬁcation
of known and novel ncRNAs in a single sRNA-Seq library.
miRAnalyzer (Hackenberg et al., 2009) and CPSS (Zhang
et al., 2012) allows quantiﬁcation of known ncRNAs, detection
and quantiﬁcation of novel miRNAs as well as differential ex-
pression with functional analysis. Whereas CPSS is focused on
experiments without replicates, the new version of miRAnalyzer
can handle replicates, but does not allow functional analysis. The
sRNA workbench (Stocks et al., 2012) offers a collection of in-
dependent tools for initial processing and ﬁltering of sRNA-Seq
data as well as annotation and prediction of novel miRNAs and
functional analysis. FiRePat (Mohorianu et al., 2012) allows for
the construction of heatmaps and correlation networks from
multiple samples of sRNA/mRNA datasets. Most tools, except
wapRNA and the sRNA toolkit, require local pre-processing of
raw sequencing data. None of the tools is speciﬁcally designed to
detect differential expression between two conditions for various
ncRNA classes. Apart from F irePat, no other tool allows for the
construction of miRNA—mRNA interaction networks.

Therefore, we developed omiRas—a Web service for the ana-
lysis of ncRNA datasets derived from Illumina sRNA-Seq ex-
periments. Starting with raw sequencing data, omiRas offers an
efﬁcient way to analyze differential expression of ncRNAs be-
tween two groups and to assign functions to differentially ex-
pressed miRNAs. MiRNA—mRNA interaction databases allow
the user to construct networks of interesting miRNAs and
mRNAs to identify miRNAs with implications in the develop-
ment of differential gene signatures.

2 APPROACH

2.1 Data submission

Sequencing data are submitted in four steps to the omiRas plat-
form: ﬁrst, give project and condition names, second, the species
selection (Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Solanum lycopersicum or
Arabidopsis thaliana). Third, upload of all raw FASTQ or
FASTA ﬁles (compressed or uncompressed) and validity check.

The ﬁle size for each library is limited to 2GB. In the last step,
information about the sequencing adapter has to be provided.
Additionally, the user can select whether novel miRNA predic-
tion should be performed.

2.2 Workﬂow

The omiRas analysis pipeline is implemented in Python 2.7
(a detailed description of the workﬂow is provided in
Supplementary Fig. S1 and Supplementary Methods). omiRas
processes up to ﬁve projects in parallel; for each project, ﬁve
CPUs are used for the computation. The workﬂow starts with
adapter removal by a local alignment of the adapter sequence to
the 3’-end of the reads accounting for sequencing errors.
Subsequently, Q2 basecalls are removed, reads summarized to
UniTags and their quantity in each library determined.
Singletons are removed from the dataset and the remaining
tags are mapped to the genome under consideration with
bowtie (Langmead et al., 2009) allowing at most two mis-
matches. The mapping coordinates are overlapped with various
models of coding and non-coding RNAs. Tags mapping to
exonic regions of protein coding genes are excluded from further
analysis. Next, ncRNAs are quantiﬁed in each library. For tags
mapping to multiple genomic loci, the number of reads corres-
ponding to the tag is normalized with the number of mapping
loci. Tags overlapping introns or intergenic regions are used for
the prediction of miRNAs not present in miRBase (Kozomara

and Grifﬁths-Jones, 2011) with miRDeep (Friedléinder et al.,
2008) and RNAfold (Gruber et al., 2008). Finally, quantiﬁcation
and annotation results are summarized for each library (Fig. 1a).
The DESeq package (Anders and Huber, 2010) is used to nor-
malize the data and to independently calculate differential ex-
pression between the two conditions for each class of ncRNAs.
The interface allows the user to Visualize results as heatmaps and
correlation plots (Pearson product-moment correlation coefﬁ-
cient). An interaction network of one or more differentially ex-
pressed miRNA(s) and the potential targets can be created
(Fig. 1b). Targets are determined by the combination of seven
target prediction tools (for details, see Supplementary Methods).
For an application of omiRas, see Supplementary Application.

2.3 Webserver implementation

The platform is implemented in Python 2.7 using the Web frame-
work Django 1.4.5. The system is hosted on a Cherokee Web
server 1.2.101. Job queuing is carried out by the asynchronous
task queue Celery 3.0.19 that uses the distributed message pas-
sing system RabbitMQ 3.0.4. Dynamical plots are generated
with the graphics utility canvasXpress (http://canvasxpress.org/).

ABSTRACT

Summary: MulRF is a platform-independent software package for
phylogenetic analysis using multi-copy gene trees. It seeks the spe-
cies tree that minimizes the Robinson—Foulds (RF) distance to the
input trees using a generalization of the RF distance to multi-Iabeled
trees. The underlying generic tree distance measure and fast running
time make MulRF useful for inferring phylogenies from large collec-
tions of gene trees, in which multiple evolutionary processes as well as
phylogenetic error may contribute to gene tree discord. MulRF imple-
ments several features for customizing the species tree search and
assessing the results, and it provides a user-friendly graphical user
interface (GUI) with tree visualization. The species tree search is im-
plemented in C++ and the GUI in Java Swing.

Availability: MulRF’s executable as well as sample datasets and
manual are available at http://genome.cs.iastate.edu/CBL/MulRF/,

1 INTRODUCTION

Resolving phylogenetic trees from large genomic datasets re-
mains a challenge for evolutionary biologists. One major prob-
lem is to reconcile the often conﬂicting phylogenetic signals from
different genes. Although some of these conﬂicts can be ex-
plained by stochastic or systematic error, biological processes
such as incomplete lineage sorting, gene duplication and loss
and lateral transfer also contribute to gene tree discord
(Maddison, 1997). An effective phylogenetic method must ad-
dress the multiple sources of discord among gene trees while
remaining computationally tractable for large genomic datasets.

Non-probabilistic methods like those implemented in
GeneTree (Page, 1998), iGTP (Chaudhary et al., 2010),
PhyloNet OK u et al., 2011) and SPRSupertree 07Vhidden et al.,
2014), and probabilistic methods like those implemented in
BEST (Liu and Pearl, 2007), BUCKy (Ané et al., 2007),
*BEAST (Heled and Drummond, 2010), STEM (Kubatko
et al., 2009), MP—EST (Liu et al., 2010) and PHYLDOG
(Boussau et al., 2012) can infer species trees while accounting

for incongruence among genes. Although these methods differ
widely in their details, with the exception of BUCKy, their rec-
onciliation models are based on a single biological cause of dis-
cordance among gene trees (e. g. deep coalescence). Also, some of
these methods, like SPRSupertree and BUCKy, are designed
only for singly labeled input trees.

Chaudhary et al. (2013) introduced an alternative approach
for building unrooted species trees from collections of unrooted,
multi-copy gene trees (i.e. trees with multiple leaves having the
same label). This approach is based on the MulRF distance, a
generalization of the Robinson—Foulds (RF) distance (Robinson
and F oulds, 1981). The MulRF distance between a species tree
and an input gene tree is obtained by ﬁrst extending the species
tree by adding additional copies of a leaf label in the star tree
topology (Fig. 1). The RF distance is then calculated between the
multi-copy gene tree and the extended species tree. The MulRF
distance between a species tree and an input gene tree can be
computed in time linear in the number of leaves of the multi-
copy gene tree (Chaudhary et al., 2013). A MulRF supertree is a
species tree that minimizes the sum of the MulRF distances to
the input gene trees. The MulRF cost function is not explicitly
linked to any biological process, and its input gene trees are not
limited to orthologous gene sequences.

Computing MulRF supertrees is NP—hard (Chaudhary et al.,
2012), but there is an efﬁcient hill-climbing heuristic for estimat-
ing them based on the unrooted subtree prune and regraft (SPR)
local search (Chaudhary et al., 2013). Here we describe MulRF
version 1.2, a software package that incorporates this heuristic,
along with several features to improve the species tree search and
assess the results. These features include the ability to: (i) weight
the input gene trees, (ii) constrain the species tree topology in the
tree search, (iii) automate multiple heuristic searches and (iv)
evaluate the score of alternate species tree topologies. The soft-
ware package also provides a graphical user interface with tree
visualization to facilitate the evaluation of the results.

2 PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

The input for species tree search is a single ﬁle containing the
collection of input gene trees, and the output is the best species
tree found in the search. All the input and the output trees are in
the Newick format. MulRF begins its tree-search heuristic from
an initial species tree, which can either be supplied by the user or
built using a step-wise leaf-adding algorithm. MulRF allows
users to weight each input gene tree with a real number from 0
to 1. During species tree search, the MulRF distance from each

gene tree to the candidate species tree is multiplied by the gene
tree weight, and the species tree is inferred based on the sum of
the weighted MulRF distances from all gene trees. Users also can
impose topological constraints on the inferred species trees. The
MulRF heuristic is a randomized algorithm, and the tree search
may get caught in a local minima. To explore the tree space more
thoroughly, we recommend executing the tree-search heuristic
multiple times on the same dataset. MulRF enables the user to
automate this by running multiple replicates of the heuristic,
each of which uses a different random seed.

The MulRF software package also enables users to determine
the total weighted or un-weighted MulRF distance between a
given species tree and a collection of gene trees, along with the
MulRF distance of each gene tree. This allows users to compare
alternate species tree topologies and identify the gene trees that
most affect the resolution of a species tree. MulRF has an intui-
tive user interface. All available options are divided into four
menu items: File, Analysis, Options and Help. The File menu
allows opening and closing input gene tree and scoring ﬁles.
The Analysis menu allows users to build and score species
trees. The Options menu allows customizing the tree search.
The Help menu provides descriptions of various menu items.
MulRF visualizes the input gene trees and the inferred species
tree using ATV (Zmasek and Eddy, 2001).

3 PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

MulRF has been extensively tested in two studies using gene tree
simulations that included duplication and loss (Chaudhary et al.,
2014), and duplication, loss and lateral transfer (Chaudhary et al.,
2013). Both studies demonstrated that MulRF can easily run on
datasets with hundreds of taxa and a thousand gene trees, and it
often provides more accurate phylogenetic estimates than iGTP,
SPRSupertree and PHYLDOG (Chaudhary et al., 2013, 2014).
We executed MulRF on a set of 6966 gene trees from 36
mammalian species that were inferred using PhyML (Guindon
et al., 2010) by Boussau et al. (2012). Boussau et al. (2012) used
PHYLDOG to estimate a phylogeny from these gene sequences.
PHYLDOG and MulRF produced credible estimates of the
phylogeny that were identical except for the placement of
Chiroptera within Laurasiatheria (Boussau et al., 2012, Fig. 5;
Supplementary Fig. S1). PHYLDOG placed Chiroptera as sister
to a clade containing Carnivora and Perissodactyla (Boussau
et al. 2012, Fig. 5), a position supported by Nery et al. (2012).
In contrast, MulRF placed Chiroptera as sister to a clade
containing Carnivora, Perissodactyla and Cetartiodactyla
(Supplementary Fig. S1), a position supported by McCormack
et al. (2012). While the PHYLDOG analysis used 3000 proces-
sors running in parallel for 10 days to estimate the gene trees and

species tree from the mammalian sequences, MulRF took only 1
h 47 min on Intel Core 2 Duo 3.16 GHz PC with 4 GB RAM to
reconstruct the mammalian tree from the gene trees.

4 CONCLUSION

MulRF is a software package for phylogenetic inference using
multi-copy gene trees based on a generalization of the RF dis-
tance. In experiments on biological or simulated datasets,
MulRF has performed well compared with both probabilistic
and non-probabilistic supertree approaches. MulRF’s speed
and performance on a variety of datasets suggests that the pro-
gram is well suited for species tree reconstruction from large
genomic datasets.

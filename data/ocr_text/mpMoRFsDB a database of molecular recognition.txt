ABSTRACT

Summary: Molecular recognition features (MoRFs) are small, intrinsic-
ally disordered regions in proteins that undergo a disorder-to—order
transition on binding to their partners. MoRFs are involved in pro-
tein—protein interactions and may function as the initial step in molecu-
lar recognition. The aim of this work was to collect, organize and store
all membrane proteins that contain MoRFs. Membrane proteins con-
stitute ~30% of fully sequenced proteomes and are responsible for a
wide variety of cellular functions. MoRFs were classified according to
their secondary structure, after interacting with their partners. We iden-
tified MoRFs in transmembrane and peripheral membrane proteins.
The position of transmembrane protein MoRFs was determined in
relation to a protein’s topology. All information was stored in a publicly
available mySQL database with a user-friendly web interface. A Jmol
applet is integrated for visualization of the structures. mpMoRFsDB
provides valuable information related to disorder-based protein—
protein interactions in membrane proteins.

1 INTRODUCTION

Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) possess no rigid three-di-
mensional structure under physiological conditions, yet they are
functionally active (Uversky, 2011). IDPs are separated in fully
disordered proteins and partially disordered proteins (Oldﬁeld
et al., 2005a). Partially disordered proteins contain intrinsically
disordered regions (IDRs). IDRs are found in both prokaryotes
and eukaryotes. In all, 20—30% of prokaryotic proteins (Dunker
et al., 2000) and more than half of eukaryotic proteins contain
IDRs (Oldﬁeld et al., 2005a). Vast abundance and functional im-
portance characterize these proteins. For a deeper understanding of
IDPs and IDRs, several databases have been developed: DisProt
(V ucetic et al., 2005), (Sickmeier et al., 2007), MobiDB (Di
Domenico et al., 2012), IDEAL (Fukuchi et al., 2012), ComSin
(Lobanov et al., 2010) and D(2)P(2) (Oates et al., 2013) provide
information about experimentally determined or theoretically pre-
dicted IDPs and IDRs. Moreover, a variety of predictors have been
developed for the prediction of IDRs from protein sequence (He
at al., 2009).

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Special cases of IDRs are molecular recognition features
(MoRFs) or molecular recognition elements (Mohan et al., 2006).
MoRFs are small regions (between 10 and 70 residues) in proteins
that undergo a disorder-to-order transition on binding to their part-
ners (Tompa, 2002; Uversky et al., 2000; Wright and Dyson, 1999).
Proteins containing MoRFs play an important role in molecular
recognition. When they are bound to their partners, MoRFs can
take various shapes according to their secondary structure. They
can form alpha-helices (or-MoRFs), beta-strands (,B-MoRFs),
irregular structures (i-MoRFs) or a combination of the previous
elements (complex-MoRFs). A number of predictors are available
for the prediction of MoRFs from protein sequences (Cheng et al.,
2007; Disfani et al., 2012; Dosztanyi et al., 2009; Mooney et al., 2012;
Oldﬁeld et al., 2005b).

Membrane proteins constitute 30% of fully sequenced proteomes
and are responsible for a wide variety of crucial cellular functions,
such as binding and signaling (Krogh et al., 2001). Membrane pro-
teins are separated in transmembrane proteins, peripheral mem-
brane proteins and lipid-anchored proteins. Transmembrane
proteins are divided into single-spanning and multi-spanning pro-
teins, according to the number of transmembrane segments. An
important number of MoRFs can be found in membrane proteins
(Mohan et al., 2006) and especially in transmembrane proteins
(Kotta-Loizou et al., 2013). IDRs are included in both alpha-helical
and beta-barrel transmembrane proteins (Xue et al., 2009) and
occur mostly on the cytoplasmic side of human plasma transmem-
brane proteins (Minezaki et al., 2007; Stavropoulos et al., 2012).

mpMoRFsDB is the ﬁrst publicly available database that
collects and provides information about MoRFs found in
membrane proteins.

2 METHODS

An initial dataset was constructed from the Protein Data Bank (PDB)
(Berman et al., 2000), following the methodology proposed by Mohan
et a1. (2006). We retrieved protein complexes containing at least two entities,
with one chain varying from 10 to 70 residues and a second one having a
length >100 residues (until May 2013). We further removed proteins where
the MoRF’s sequence contained errors or not valid amino acid residues,
ending up with 2458 PDB entries mapping to 785 unique Uniprot Accession
numbers (Uniprot_Consortium, 2012). Membrane proteins were selected
using Uniprot’s annotation. Moreover, we used the secondary structure as-
signment and the accessible surface area values inferred by DSSP (Kabsch
and Sander, 1983) to categorize MoRFs and to evaluate whether a MoRF
can interact with its possible partner, respectively. The position of trans-
membrane protein MoRFs in relation to a protein’s topology was deter-
mined. Transmembrane protein topology was determined based on
experimentally derived data from ExTopoDB (Tsaousis et al., 2010) and
Uniprot.

The process is automated so that new MoRFs can be collected from
membrane proteins, as novel structures are deposited in PDB. Finally, we
organized all data in a publicly available mySQL database, with a user-
friendly web interface based on HTML, CSS, PHP and Javascript.
Protein information can be accessed through three different ﬁle formats
(Fasta, Text and XML), apart from the classic web View. Moreover, the
entire database can be downloaded locally for further analysis.

3 RESULTS

The database includes 173 membrane proteins containing 244
MoRFs. Membrane proteins are divided in 102 transmembrane
proteins (70 single-spanning and 32 multi-spanning) and 71 periph-
eral membrane proteins. MoRFs were classiﬁed in categories ac-
cording to their secondary structure when bound to their partners,
with 33.47% categorized as oz-MoRFs, 3.83% as ,B-MoRFs,
60.48% as i-MoRFs and 2.22% as complex-MoRFs.

In the main page of mpMoRFsDB, a user may ﬁnd links to the
following tools: Browse, Search, Blast Search and Download.
Through the Browse page, the user has the ability to browse all
the entries. Moreover, there is an option for browsing by membrane
protein type (transmembrane or peripheral) or by the secondary
structure of MoRFs (oz-MoRFs, ,B-MoRFs, i-MoRFs and com-
plex-MoRFs). Through Search, the user may submit advanced
queries, whereas through Blast Search, we provide an interface for
running Blast searches against the database. Each entry contains
information about the respective membrane protein and related
MoRFs. A Jmol (Hanson, 2010) applet is integrated for Visualiza-
tion of the structures, and cross-references to many publicly avail-
able databases are included, providing information for protein
domains, molecular interactions and diseases. In the case of trans-
membrane proteins, we determined whether the MoRFs are pos-
itioned in the cytoplasmic or the extracellular space. We observed
that the majority of MoRFs in transmembrane proteins are found in
the cytoplasmic side.

4 DISCUSSION

A database containing MoRFs in membrane proteins was con-
structed. Data were collected with automated Perl scripts and ver-
iﬁed manually. The whole process can easily be repeated, and we
intend to update the database every 6 months. The proteins in our
database are highly connected nodes in protein interaction net-
works (52% of mpMoRFsDB’s entries have more than ﬁve inter-
actions in molecular interaction databases) and are essential to cell
survival (J eong et al., 2001). mpMoRFsDB provides an up-to-date
dataset, which can be used for the design and evaluation of meth-
ods predicting MoRFs in membrane proteins. The database will
contribute to the emerging ‘protein non-folding problem’ (Dill and
MacCallum, 2012) and provide insights in disorder-based inter-
actions in membrane proteins.

Abstract

Motivation: PAR—CLIP, a CLIP—seq protocol, derives a transcriptome wide set of binding sites for
RNA—binding proteins. Even though the protocol uses stringent washing to remove experimental
noise, some of it remains. A recent study measured three sets of non—specific RNA backgrounds
which are present in several PAR—CLIP datasets. However, a tool to identify the presence of com—
mon background in PAR—CLIP datasets is not yet available.

Results: We used the measured sets of non—specific RNA backgrounds to build a common back—
ground set. Each element from the common background set has a score that reflects its presence in
several PAR—CLIP datasets. We present a tool that uses this score to identify the amount of common
backgrounds present in a PAR—CLIP dataset, and we provide the user the option to use or remove it.
We used the proposed strategy in 30 PAR—CLIP datasets from nine proteins. It is possible to identify
the presence of common backgrounds in a dataset and identify differences in datasets for the same
protein. This method is the first step in the process of completely removing such backgrounds.
Availability: The tool was implemented in python. The common background set and the supple—
mentary data are available at https://github.com/phrh/BackCLIP.

1 Introduction

 

RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) have important roles in RNA regula—
tion. The first step to understand RBPs’ specific functions is to iden—
tify the RNA targets for each RBP. The introduction of protocols
combining CLIP (UV crosslinking and immunoprecipitation) and
high-throughput sequencing (commonly known as CLIP—seq proto—
cols) have made it possible to obtain sets of binding sites for RBPs at
a transcriptome—wide scale (Licatalosi et 61]., 2008). However, each
CLIP—seq protocol introduces distinct modifications to reduce the
presence of background (non—crosslinked RNA).

PAR-CLIP, a frequently used CLIP—seq protocol, uses photo acti—
vatable nucleosides to label the transcripts in addition to an enhanced

crosslinking (Hafner et 61]., 2010). These modifications induce specific
nucleotides transitions that facilitate the recognition of the cross—
linked sites. The presence of a common background in PAR-CLIP
datasets has been noted (Sievers et 61]., 2012). This non-specific RNA
background must be taken into account when processing PAR-CLIP
data because it can interfere with the distinction of the specific charac-
teristics recognized by the RBPs, and therefore the identification and
understanding of binding targets and protein function.

A recent study (Friedersdorf and Keene, 2014) experimentally
measured three background sets and demonstrated that background
RNA is common in several PAR—CLIP datasets. This background
RNA mainly originates from false binding sites. It is worth noting

that PAR-CLIP induced transitions were also present in several sites
from the measured background sets, thus it is difficult to distinguish
background RNA.

Although computational tools exist specifically for CLIP—seq data
(Reyes-Herrera and Ficarra, 2014), only a few proposals address the
background issue (Comoglio et al., 2015; Uren et al., 2012; Wang et
al., 2014). These computational tools use mathematical models to dis—
tinguish binding sites from the RNA background based on character—
istics such as read counts or the number of induced transitions, but
these characteristics are measured from whole datasets (both back—
ground and binding sites). Friedersdorf and Keene (2014) present an
alternative strategy for background correction, it consists on removing
sites from the PAR—CLIP dataset that overlap by one or more nucleo—
tides with the sites present in one of three known background RNA
sets. However, a limitation of this strategy is that it may remove sites
that incidentally overlap with the background.

The datasets of non—specific RNA background constitute a valu—
able reference resource for the quantification of the amount of back—
ground present in a PAR—CLIP dataset. Here, we build on this
resource to develop a computational tool, BackCLIP, to identify the
presence of common background RNA in PAR—CLIP datasets.

2 Materials and Methods

2.1 Common background

We used the three background RNA sets (45, 35 and 20 kDa) ob—
tained in (Friedersdorf and Keene, 2014) to build an initial back—
ground set, as illustrated in Figure 1(a). Each site in the initial
background set was assigned a score, 5, equal to the number of the
background sets that contained the specific site.

Then we used several PAR—CLIP datasets to refine the scores and
build a common background set as illustrated in Figure 1(b). First,
we found common sites between the initial background set and a
PAR—CLIP dataset by using Pybedtools (Dale et al., 2011). Then, we
increased the scores of the sites present in both sets and updated the
common background set. The score is directly associated with the
number of datasets that contain a site present in the common back—
ground set.

We used data publicly available to build and test the common back—
ground. These datasets have several similarities in experimental

conditions. All data are from human cell lines (the majority from HEK-
293); 4—SU is the photoactivatable ribonucleoside used to derive most
of the datasets. We used a random partition to select the datasets used
to build the common background and the datasets used for testing. We
reviewed several considerations to build a common background that is
representative of several PAR—CLIP datasets and an unbiased test set.

We used the aforementioned approach and built the common
background set using 19 PAR—CLIP datasets from seven RBP. This
common background was used to quantify the background RNA in
30 PAR—CLIP datasets from nine proteins (details in Supplementary
Data). Two common background sets were identified: (i) the com—
mon background set used to test this proposal (built on 19 PAR-
CLIP datasets from seven RBP), and (ii) a common background set
built on all the used PAR—CLIP datasets (built on 49 PAR-CLIP
datasets from 16 RBP).

2.2 Measure background presence

We propose to use the common background set to quantify the
amount of background RNA present in any PAR—CLIP dataset, as
illustrated in Figure 1(c). This method suggests a threshold for the
scores, which is the 99 percentile learned from the common back-
ground scores (discarding sites with a score equal to 1). To find the
intersection between a dataset and the common background, we ob—
tained the proportion of sites with a score higher than the threshold in
the intersection compared with the number of sites in the intersection.
Then we examined two indicators (i) the aforementioned proportion
and (ii) the number of sites in the intersection set compared with the
number of sites in the PAR—CLIP dataset. We use these two param—
eters as a quantitative measure of the background presence. The first
indicator shows the amount of common background in the intersec—
tion. The second indicator provides the number of intersection sites in
the evaluated dataset. If the first indicator is >5 0% and the second in-
dicator is >25 % then, the presence of background in the dataset must
be considered. The user is then alerted and asked whether the sites
with a score higher than the threshold can be removed.

Using Tophat (Trapnell et al., 2009) and Bowtie (Langmead et
al., 2009), the examined raw PAR—CLIP datasets were aligned to
hg19 to obtain clusters of overlapping sequences. We excluded reads
of <20 nt and clusters with less than five reads, and used the clusters
to measure the background RNA presence.

3 Results Acknowledgements

As an example, we selected Quaking  protein from the nine We are grateful to Ana Maria Ortega Villa (Virginia Tech.) for her statistical

RBPs (30 PAR—CLIP datasets, details in the Supplementary assessment-

Information), and four of its PAR—CLIP datasets. These were se—

lected because the proteins motif is known, and these four datasets

are from the same study (Hafner et al., 2010). However, there are Funding

marked differences.

Figure 2 shows the distributions for the 5 scores in the intersec—
tion dataset (boxplot and histogram). We observed significant differ-
ences in the two indicators among the four QKI datasets. For the
first two datasets, the number of sites in the intersection is <20% of
the corresponding number of dataset clusters, whereas for the last
two datasets the number was higher than 30%. Moreover, for the
last two datasets, 50% or more of the sites in the intersection had a
score over the threshold (proportion CI).

The information in Table 1 indicates that the percentage of
motifs in the intersection compared with the original dataset is low.
The two smaller datasets have a greater proportion of sites in the
intersection with the background, compared with the number of
clusters. This shows that the amount of common background RNA
is different in each dataset even for the same protein. It is also evi—
dent that the percentage for the QKI motif (AYUAAY) is higher in
the clusters than in the intersection with the background confirming
that the background dataset has non—specific sites. However, the
motif relative count (motifs in intersection/motifs in dataset) is
higher than 5% in the last two datasets because the motif count in
the original dataset is small, and any motif in the intersection makes
a difference. Table 1 shows the number of sites and corresponding
sites with motifs identified as the background using only the data
(column fourth and fifth) (Friedersdorf and Keene, 2014), and the
number of sites and corresponding sites with motifs identified as the
background using BackCLIP (last two columns). Our proposal iden—
tifies noisy sites without losing true positive sites.

In conclusion, BackCLIP is a useful tool to identify the amount
of common background in any PAR—CLIP dataset.

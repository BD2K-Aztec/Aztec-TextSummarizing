ABSTRACT

Summary: RefProtDom provides a set of divergent query domains,
originally selected from Pfam, and full-length proteins containing
their homologous domains, with diverse architectures, for evaluating
pair-wise and iterative sequence similarity searches. Pfam homology
and domain boundary annotations in the target library were
supplemented using local and semi-global searches, PSI-BLAST
searches, and SCOP and CATH classifications.

Availability: RefProtDom is available from http://faculty.virginia.edu/

1 INTRODUCTION

Evaluation and improvement of protein sequence similarity
searches, using algorithms such as BLAST or Smith-Waterman
(SSEARCH) and more sophisticated searches such as PSI-BLAST
or HMMER (Altschul et al., 1997; Durbin, 1998; Smith and
Waterman, 1981), require query sequences and reference sets curated
to accurately reﬂect homology relationships. Because structural
similarity is preserved well beyond sequence similarity (Gibrat et al.,
1996), protein structures are often the gold standard for annotating
homology relationships. Although both structure-based homology
annotations and manually annotated protein sequence relationships
can very accurately record homology relationships, they do not
reﬂect common practice in protein similarity searching, which is to
characterize unknown proteins by searching large, comprehensive
protein sets such as RefSeq (Pruitt et al., 2007) and UniProt
(Consortium, 2009).

To better characterize similarity searching strategies, in particular,
PSI—BLAST performance, against comprehensive protein databases,
we identiﬁed a set of diverse protein domains from Pfam (Finn et al.,
2010) V. 21 to use as queries against a set of real proteins containing
these domains. Our query domain families are taxonomically broad
(to provide ‘harder’ homology detection cases), and have long
models (to better simulate full-length protein searches). Although we
cannot be certain that all homologs have been found, we believe that
statistically signiﬁcant pair-wise alignments are annotated correctly.

2 DATABASE ASSEMBLY

Evaluation datasets: from 681 initial Pfam (V. 21) families that met criteria
for: (i) domain length (>200 residues); (ii) taxonomic diversity (present in
two of bacteria, archaea and eukarya); (iii) family size (>100 instances); and
(iv) available structure, we selected 344 query Pfam families after merging
families that belonged to the same clan (Gonzalez and Pearson, 2010). In this
initial set, 81 families belonged to distinct clans, while 263 families did
not have an associated clan. This set was reduced to 320 non-homologous
domains using information from Pfam (V. 23) (by Pfam V. 24, these domains
belonged to 112 distinct clans with 168 families not in clans, for 280 non-
homologous domains).

The target library was built from 234505 full-length UniProt proteins
(excluding Viral sequences) containing Pfam V. 21 homologs to the original
320 Pfam families together with 1627 other domain families. Two query
sets were constructed and the members of these sets evaluated further: (i) a
challenging query subset (50 hard) with the lowest family coverage with
BLAST; and (ii) a randomly sampled representative query set (50 sampled
with replacement).

Annotation extensions: when the original Pfam V. 21 annotations were
used to characterize searches with our hard and sampled queries against the
target library, thousands of alignments to very similar UniProt sequences
(e.g. E() < 10—80, with >95% identity) were annotated as partial homologs
or non-homologs. To correct these conservative annotations, we compared
the bare domain query sequences to the target library using SSEARCH
and GLSEARCH (a program that produces an alignment that is global in
the query sequence but possibly local in the target or library sequence).
We identiﬁed all the signiﬁcantly similar sequence regions (E() <0.001)
with SSEARCH that were either shorter or unannotated in Pfam V. 21 and
calculated the boundaries using GLSEARCH. We extended annotations on
2106 partial domains and added 24 604 domain homology annotations based
on SSEARCH alignments, 13 574 of which were included in Pfam V. 24.
RefProtDom describes relationships and alignment boundaries between
query domains and the target library homologs according to Pfam V. 21,
Pfam V. 24 and the SSEARCH/GLSEARCH alignment boundaries.

Although SSEARCH/GLSEARCH searches against the target library
dramatically reduced the number of apparent false positives with
very low E()-Values, additional searches with PSI-BLAST using the
queries sometimes found ‘unrelated’ UniProt sequences with signiﬁcant
(E() < 10—40) scores. We analyzed all signiﬁcant (E() < 10—4) ‘non-
homologous’ alignments found in the ﬁrst three iterations of PSI-BLAST
for the 100 queries (94 distinct families). Non-homologous alignments to
regions with no annotated Pfam domains were used as queries in reciprocal
PSI-BLAST searches for three iterations. Reciprocal searches that recovered
at least 25% of a domain family were annotated as homologous, yielding
375 additional homology annotations across 33/94 families. Structures of
signiﬁcant ‘non-homologs’ that mapped to unrelated Pfam families were
examined in SCOP and CATH; if they shared the same SCOP fold or CATH
topology they were annotated as homologs. For example, Pfam annotates a

PF00346 domain for residues 295—537 on the Q82MJO_SALTY sequence.
RefProtDom also annotates PF00374 in the same region (390—535) because
both domains share the same SCOP fold and superfamily classiﬁcations
(e.18.1). This structural annotation is also reported by SCOOP (Bateman
and Finn, 2007). We found structural evidence to add 37 additional clans;
Pfam V. 24 matches 14 of those 37 structural clans. These additional clans
would reduce the number of non-homologous domains in our query set from
94 to 90, but the families were not combined, the cryptic homology was
simply annotated. Structure classiﬁcations yielded 2124 additional homology
annotations across 16/94 queries.

3 SUMMARY

Iterative similarity searches are usually performed against full-
length proteins with complex domain architectures. Evaluating
similarity-searching methods against benchmarking sets with
incomplete or missing annotations can introduce dramatic statistical
inaccuracies. RefProtDom’s greatest strength is its use of a
taxonomically diverse set of full-length, multi—domain, proteins in
the target library. Searches against RefProtDom resemble searches
against SwissProt, UniProt or RefSeq (though these databases are
much larger). Moreover, the query sequences are evolutionarily
independent; based on structural comparisons, 90 query domains are
non—homologous. Thus, RefProtDom can simulate searches against
comprehensive sequence databases while evaluating success on
challenging homologies.

Pfam is a powerful resource for identifying homology
relationships and domain boundaries, but strategies that use a single
hidden Markov model (HMM) to identify every homolog will be
challenged by distant sequences at the detection horizon for the
model. For many families, Pfam has addressed this problem by
grouping families into clans. But, sometimes homologs are missed;
sequences that share strong similarity across the length of a domain
to an annotated homolog are surely homologous, even if they do not
produce a signiﬁcant score against the HMM model.

The RefProtDom query and target libraries seek to reduce the
number of un-annotated homologies with statistically signiﬁcant
similarities, and to more accurately estimate homologous domain
boundaries. Although our curation may have missed some
homologs, we are conﬁdent in the homologies we annotate.
Homology is annotated for domains that share signiﬁcant pair-wise
similarity, show signiﬁcant family coverage after three PSI-BLAST
iterations, or when they share structures. Domain boundaries
were reVised based on signiﬁcant local or global similarity. By
combining single domain queries with full—length, multi—domain
proteins, RefProtDom can highlight alignment errors and evaluate
improvements in alignment accuracy.

Accurate boundary annotation has been largely overlooked in pair—
wise sequence comparison, because incorrect alignment boundaries
rarely detract from the identiﬁcation of homologous proteins. Pfam’s
annotations are now generated with HMMER3, which only performs
local alignments (Finn et al., 2010). Therefore, one might expect
that future Pfam annotations may have an even harder time at
identifying complete domains, and thus, should continue to beneﬁt
from the extension curation provided by RefProtDom. Nonetheless,
HMMER3 compensates with increased sensitiVity as a result of
better statistics. In fact, 59% of the domain extensions and 55% of

the missed homologs added to Pfam V. 21 using our protocol were
incorporated in Pfam V. 24. Thus, Pfam V. 24, using HMMER3,
has independently addressed many of the missing annotations,
validating our approach. However, we believe that the problems
inherent in using a single model for diverse protein family searches
will always miss homologs and domain boundaries that can be found
with individual domains across the family’s phylogenetic tree. We
plan to continue to update the homology relationships and boundary
assignments in RefProtDom.

For iterative sequence comparison methods, alignment accuracy
is crucial; inaccurate alignments can cause non-homologous
domains to be included in the proﬁles and decrease their speciﬁcity
in subsequent iterations. Using RefProtDom’s annotations, we
identiﬁed a previously unrecognized alignment overextension error
in PSI—BLAST responsible for the corruption of its PSSMs and
its poor speciﬁcity (Gonzalez and Pearson, 2010). Additional
evaluations with RefProtDom revealed that while JACKHMMER
(HMMER3’s iterative implementation) is susceptible to the
same error, it overextends more slowly and, thus, shows better
performance than unmodiﬁed PSI—BLAST (M.W.G. and W.R.P.,
manuscript in preparation).

Domains are the basic units of protein function and evolution;
thus, improved homology detection requires improved domain
alignment accuracy. Large-scale automatic annotation of gene
function is limited by local alignments’ incomplete motif matches
and fuzzy domain boundaries (Kann et al., 2007). Establishing
homology is central to a wide array of bioinformatics methodologies;
improved domain alignments can improve 3D protein structural
predictions that use homology modeling, and also clarify how
protein domain networks interact to generate disease phenotypes.
RefProtDom provides a comprehensive set of full-length UniProt
proteins that can be used to evaluate domain alignment accuracy.

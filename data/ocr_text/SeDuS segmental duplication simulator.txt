Abstract

Summary: SeDuS is the first flexible and user—friendly forward—in—time simulator of patterns of
molecular evolution within segmental duplications undergoing interlocus gene conversion and
crossover. SeDuS introduces known features of interlocus gene conversion such as biased
directionality and dependence on local sequence identity. Additionally, it includes aspects such
as different selective pressures acting upon copy number and flexible crossover distributions.
A graphical user interface allows fast fine—tuning of relevant parameters and straightforward real—

time analysis of the evolution of duplicates.

Availability and implementation: SeDuS is implemented in C++ and can be run via command line
or through a graphical user interface developed using Qt C++. Source code and binary executables
for Linux, OS X and Windows are freely available at \MNw.biologiaevolutiva.org/sedus/. A tutorial
with a detailed description of implementation, parameters and output files is available online.

1 Introduction

The evolution of duplicated regions of the genome has attracted the
attention of evolutionary biologists since Susumu Ohno (1970)
proposed that they are a fundamental source of novel genes and
functions. Duplicated regions are a pervasive characteristic of
eukaryotic genomes and can span up to hundreds of kilobases
encompassing several genes. Such is the case of segmental duplica—
tions (>1 kb, >90% similarity), which are known to originate copy
number variation and chromosomal rearrangements and to underlie
the susceptibility to many diseases (Iskow et 61]., 2012).

Duplicated regions have a distinctive feature that crucially affects
their evolution: they exchange genetic information through a type of
gene conversion referred to as ectopic, non—allelic or interlocus gene con—
version (IGC) (Ohta, 1982), which differs from usual allelic gene con—
version in that it happens between paralog genomic regions. IGC is a
major driver of the concerted evolution of duplicates, which complicates
the application of conventional population—genetic interpretations, such
as the molecular clock, to these regions (Teshima and Innan, 2004).

Simulating duplicated sequences under the coalescent has
provided important insights into their neutral molecular evolution
(Thornton, 2007). However, because of computing—time limitations
(Yang et 61]., 2014), coalescent simulators can only explore a
restricted range of parameters, particularly regarding recom-
bination. Moreover, they preclude simulating IGC rate dependence
on sequence similarity.

Here, we present a forward—in—time simulator of the molecular
evolution of segmental duplications designed to explore their pat—
terns of concerted evolution under a wide range of parameters. We
have named this software SeDuS (segmental duplication simulator).
SeDuS is an improved and extended version of the in—house scripts
used in previous work from our group (Hartasanchez et 61]., 2014).
On top of command—line execution, SeDuS comes with an independ—
ent, user—friendly graphical user interface (GUI) allowing control
over the most important parameters and direct visualization of
simulation results. Thus, SeDuS has not only research applicability
but can also be a great tool for educators.

To our knowledge, SeDuS is the first user—friendly, forward—
in-time population genetics simulator specifically aimed at
addressing the evolution of segmental duplications while giving full
consideration to IGC. Our algorithm has a modular architecture
allowing the user to easily modify specific functions or to incorpor—
ate new features. SeDuS is under constant development and updates
will be presented accordingly.

2 Design and implementation

The core of SeDuS is built on the C—l——l— code published in
Hartasanchez et al. (2014). Here, we briefly describe the underlying
structure of the software and then expand on its novel biology-
oriented additions and technical improvements.

SeDuS is a forward—in—time simulator of a Wright-Fisher diploid
population evolving under neutrality. Each individual is represented
by a single pair of homologous chromosomes, and each chromo—
some is initially composed of two blocks (original and single-copy)
of equal length L. During a burn—in phase, each chromosome under—
goes mutation and crossover. At a given point in time, a duplication
event takes place in which the original block on a randomly chosen
chromosome is copied to the right of the single—copy block, either on
the same chromosome or on its homologous chromosome (Fig. 1a).
The duplication is conditioned to fixation following a neutral or se—
lective trajectory. The original and duplicated blocks exchange in—
formation via IGC, which occurs at rate C in all chromosomes
carrying the duplication (Fig. 1b). For further details on the struc—
ture of SeDuS, please refer to the SeDuS tutorial.

SeDuS includes a series of new features regarding distinct aspects
of IGC. Even though IGC between duplicates has been known for a
long time, the molecular mechanisms underlying IGC remain rela-
tively obscure (Hastings, 2010) and largely unexplored via simula-
tions. One major reason for the latter is that some of the
characteristics of IGC violate the basic assumptions of the coalescent
model (Thornton, 2007). For instance, the rate of IGC depends on
local sequence similarity, with research indicating that for an IGC
event to occur, a tract of 100% identity between duplicates, called a
minimal efficient processing segment (MEPS) must be present near
the IGC initiation site (Shen and Huang, 1986). This phenomenon
makes the probability of an IGC event between two particular se—
quences dependent on their level of divergence, which makes it im-
possible to separate, as the coalescent does, the processes of
mutation and genealogy building. In contrast, SeDuS easily

simulates MEPS. Additionally, SeDuS incorporates biased direction—
ality in IGC by establishing different probabilities for the duplicated
block to act as donor or acceptor of IGC events. Moreover, IGC can
occur between paralogs in the same chromosome or in homologous
chromosomes with user—defined probabilities.

Another novelty is that SeDuS can simulate both neutral and
non—neutral fixation—conditioned trajectories of the duplication. For
example, fast fixation events, characteristic of the presence of a du—
plication being positively selected (or slightly deleterious), can be
simulated in SeDuS by forcing the duplication to reach fixation in a
given number of generations through a linear trajectory (Teshima
and Innan, 2012).

Previous work has showed that crossover hotspots overlapping
duplicated regions might generate important deviations from neutral
expectations (Hartasanchez et al., 2014), highlighting the import-
ance of incorporating specific recombination landscapes when simu—
lating concerted evolution between duplicates. SeDuS allows meiotic
crossover to occur at rate R at user—defined regions that might in-
clude several hotspots of any specified intensity (up to five regions in
the GUI and an unlimited number in the command—line version).
Regions can overlap, allowing the user to easily simulate, for in-
stance, a crossover hotspot over a background crossover rate.

In terms of technical improvements, SeDuS has efficient memory
management, a structure that enables parallelization of simulation
runs and shorter execution times. On a typical desktop computer,
the simulation of a population of size N = 1000 with a duplicated
region of 10 kb evolving under concerted evolution for 10 000 gener—
ations takes N2 s if executed via command line.

Another major feature of SeDuS is its GUI (implemented in Qt
C—l——l—), which provides real—time feedback and allows the visualiza—
tion of variation measures, such as the average number of pairwise
differences within each block. The GUI is user—friendly and can be
used for quick explorations of the molecular evolution of segmental
duplications with both research and educational purposes.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Non-targeted metabolomics technologies often yield data
in which abundance for any given metabolite is observed and quanti-
fied for some samples and reported as missing for other samples.
Apparent missingness can be due to true absence of the metabolite
in the sample or presence at a level below detectability. Mixture-model
analysis can formally account for metabolite ‘missingness’ due to ab-
sence or undetectability, but software for this type of analysis in the
high-throughput setting is limited. The R package metabomxtr has
been developed to facilitate mixture-model analysis of non-targeted
metabolomics data in which only a portion of samples have quantiﬁ-
able abundance for certain metabolites.

Availability and implementation: metabomxtr is available through
Bioconductor. It is released under the GPL—2 license.

1 INTRODUCTION

High-throughput metabolomics proﬁling has surged in popular-
ity with non-targeted technologies in particular offering oppor-
tunity for discovery of new metabolite associations with
phenotypes or outcomes. A challenge to analyzing non-targeted
output is the frequent occurrence of missing data (Hrydziuszko
and Viant, 2012). These data are not ‘missing’ in the sense that
they were not collected; rather, metabolites may be detected and
their abundance quantiﬁed in some samples and not others.
Typically conducted using nuclear magnetic resonance, liquid
chromatography-mass spectrometry or gas chromatography-
mass spectrometry (Issaq et al., 2009; M000 and Vervoort,
2007), non-targeted assays typically have unknown lower detec-
tion thresholds. Thus, when a given metabolite is not detected, it

is unknown whether that metabolite was indeed absent or merely
undetectable.

Several approaches for handling missingness have been
described in metabolomics literature, including complete case ana-
lysis, imputation and adaptations of classic dimension reduction
tools to allow for missing data. For metabolite-by—metabolite ana-
lyses, imputation is common, with methods including minimum,
median and nearest neighbor imputation (Hrydziuszko and Viant,
2012). Partial least squares discriminant analysis and principal
components analysis with missing data adaptations have been
used, although these methods identify regression-based linear
combinations of multiple correlated metabolites associated with
a phenotype or outcome, and, in general, results are less translat-
able for understanding individual metabolite contributions
(Andersson and Bro, 1998; Walczak and Massart, 2001).

An underused approach for metabolite-by—metabolite analysis
is the Bernoulli/lognormal mixture model proposed by Moulton
and Halsey (1995). This method simultaneously estimates par-
ameters modeling the probability of non-missing response and
the mean of observed values. Imputation is not required, and
instead ‘missingness’ is explicitly modeled as either true absence
or presence below detectability, consistent with non-targeted
metabolomics technology. We used mixture models to analyze
GC-MS metabolomics data (Scholtens et al., 2014), but, to our
knowledge, there is no available software to easily perform these
analyses that folds into existing high-throughput data analysis
pipelines.

Noting the elegance of the mixture-model approach and the
continued issue of missing data in metabolomics research, we
present metabomxtr, an R package that automates mixture-
model analysis. The core functions accept R objects typically
handled in Bioconductor—type analyses or basic data frames,
thus providing a ﬂexible tool to complement existing user pipe-
lines and preferences for data preprocessing.

2 MAIN FEATURES

(generally following log transformation), the contribution of the
ith observation to the likelihood is:

{(1 —p.-)+p.-<I>[(T — u.)/a]}“—“:){pi - expi—(y — ui)2/202]/~/%0}8‘

where p,- represents the probability of metabolite detection in the
ith sample, T is the threshold of detectability and (Si is an indica-
tor equal to 1 if the metabolite is detected and 0 otherwise. A
logistic model is speciﬁed for p,, log(p,-/(1—p,-))=x,~’,6, where x,-
and ,6 are the covariate and parameter vectors, respectively.
A linear model is speciﬁed for the mean of the observed response,
u,, with ui= 2505, where z,- and at are the covariate and parameter
vectors, respectively.

2.2 Function descriptions

metabomxtr has two main functions: mxtrmod and
mxtrmodLRT. mxtrmod executes mixture models, taking as
inputs response variable names, a model formula and a data
object (a matrix of values with NA to indicate missingness or
an ExpressionSet R object). It returns optimized parameter esti-
mates and the corresponding negative log likelihood value.
Parameter vectors oz and ,6 are estimated using maximum likeli-
hood using the optimx package. By default, T is set to the min-
imum observed metabolite abundance. Use of mxtrmod on the
example dataset metabdata follows:

> data(metabdata)

> metabnames<—colnames(metabdata)[11:20]
>fullModel<—~PHENO|PHENO+FCg+age_ogtt_mc+

+ parityl2+ga_ogtt_wks_mc+storageTimesYears_mc
>fullModRes<—mxtrmod(metabnames,mxtrModel=fullModel,

+ data=metabdata)
>redModel<—~l|FCg+age_ogtt_mc+parityl2+ga_ogtt_wks_mc+

+ storageTimesYears_mc
> redModRes<-mxtrmod (metabnames , mxtrModel=redModel ,
+ data=metabdata,fullModel=fullModel)

To evaluate the signiﬁcance of speciﬁc covariates,
mxtrmodLRT implements nested model likelihood ratio X2
tests. Required arguments include mxtrmod output for full and
reduced models and, if desired, method of multiple comparisons
adjustment. mxtrmodLRT outputs a data frame of negative log
likelihoods, x2 statistics, degrees of freedom and P-values for
each metabolite.

2.3 Comparison with imputation

To illustrate mixture models, we re-analyzed a subset of GC-MS
data on 115 fasting serum samples from pregnant women
involved in the population-based Hyperglycemia and Adverse
Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) Study, contained in the example
data (Scholtens et al., 2014). A total of 49 non-targeted metab-
olites with at least ﬁve missing values were analyzed using mix-
ture modeling as well as minimum imputation and ﬁve nearest
neighbors. The predictor of interest was high (>90th percentile)
versus low (<10th percentile) fasting plasma glucose (FPG).
Samples for this pilot study were selected such that 67 had
high FPG and 48 had low FPG. For minimum and nearest

neighbor imputation, FPG groups were compared after imput-
ation using linear models adjusted for study ﬁeld center, parity,
maternal and gestational age and sample storage time. The con-
tinuous portion of the mixture model also included these covari-
ates, whereas the discrete portion included only FPG. F PG was
removed for reduced models in mixture-model analysis. Nominal
P<0.01 were considered statistically signiﬁcant.

Of 49 metabolites analyzed, there was complete agreement (all
signiﬁcant or non-signiﬁcant) among methods on 39 of them. Of
the remaining 10 (Supplementary Fig. and Supplementary
Table), mixture models detected signiﬁcant effects for 7, nearest
neighbor 4 and minimum 4. Of the seven mixture-model identi-
ﬁcations, three were also detected by nearest neighbor, two also
by minimum imputation and two were unique identiﬁcations.
The mixture-model results were discussed from a biological per-
spective by Scholtens et al. (2014) and include leucine and pyru-
vic acid. One signiﬁcant metabolite ﬁnding was unique to nearest
neighbor imputation, but the result is questionable because the
median of the imputed values exceeded the observed median,
inconsistent with the notion of low abundance. For the two sig-
niﬁcant effects unique to minimum imputation, mixture-model
P-values approached signiﬁcance (0.018, 0.011), suggesting ap-
proximate agreement between the two methods.

3 DISCUSSION

The R package metabomxtr facilitates mixture-model analysis of
non-targeted metabolomics data. Re-analysis of the HAPO pilot
metabolomics data indicates that mixture-model analysis detects
metabolites identiﬁed by other common imputation approaches
and additionally identiﬁes associations that would otherwise be
missed. Rigorous testing of mixture models on a wider scale is
warranted. In summary, metabomxtr provides metabolomics re-
searchers a previously unavailable tool for handling non-targeted
metabolomics missingness.

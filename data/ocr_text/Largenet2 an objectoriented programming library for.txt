The investigation of dynamical processes on networks has
become a highly active research ﬁeld, which addresses questions
from a wide range of disciplines (Barrat et al., 2008; Newman,
2010). One of the fundamental tools of ‘network science’ (B6rner
et al., 2007) is computer simulation. Prominent examples include
the study of the propagation of communicable diseases in net-
works of social contacts (e.g. Kuperman and Abramson, 2001),
the emergence of consensus in networks of interacting agents
(Castellano, 2005; Sood and Redner, 2005) or the evolution of
cooperation among selﬁsh individuals (Santos and Pacheco,
2005; Nowak, 2006).

During the past decade in particular, adaptive networks have
received a lot of attention. In this class of network models, the
network structure itself changes dynamically in response to the
dynamics of its constituents (Gross and Blasius, 2008; Gross and
Sayama, 2009). This creates a feedback loop between the dy-
namics on the network and the dynamics of the network itself,
leading to emergent complex behaviour. For instance,
adaptive-network models have been studied for social networks
(Skyrms and Pemantle, 2000), opinion formation (Durrett et al.,
2012; Nardini et al., 2008; Vazquez et al., 2008), epidemic spread-
ing (Gross et al., 2006; Shaw and Schwartz, 2008) and collective
motion (Couzin et al., 2011; Huepe et al., 2011).

Dynamical processes in adaptive networks are typically speci-
ﬁed in terms of a set of rules that locally transform a part of the
network, e.g. update a node’s state according to its neighbour-
hood or modify the local connectivity of a node (Gorochowski
et al., 2012; Zschaler, 2012). An example of such rules for an
epidemiological model is shown in Figure 1. The transformation
rules can be directly implemented in computer simulations. For
stochastic models, they are typically applied asynchronously

using Monte Carlo techniques such as Gillespie’s algorithm
(Gillespie, 1976).

To apply the transformation rules efﬁciently in simulations,
the network subgraphs involved in a speciﬁc rule must be access-
ible at random, i.e. they must be located directly without resort-
ing to an extensive search in the network. For instance, for the
infection rule in Figure 1 (top), efﬁcient access to the links con-
necting S- and I-nodes in the network must be provided. Thus,
appropriate data structures representing the network are
required, which provide random access to the network nodes,
links and similar subgraphs; store properties such as node and
link states and allow for fast changes of the network topology.

Standard data structures used to represent networks (or
graphs) in computer science are tailored towards the efﬁcient
implementation of certain algorithms, as for instance graph tra-
versal, search or ﬁnding shortest paths (Mehlhorn and Naher,
1999; Sedgewick, 2002; Siek et al., 2002). In most cases, these
algorithms work on static networks with a ﬁxed topology, and
efﬁcient access to node and link states is usually not of major
concern. Such data structures are therefore not suitable for the
simulation of large adaptive networks, whose structure changes
dynamically and depending on the node and link states.

The largenetZ library has been developed speciﬁcally for the
efﬁcient simulation of dynamic and adaptive networks. It pro-
vides data structures for networks with discrete node and link
states (represented as integer numbers), allowing for fast random
access to nodes and links in any given state, and efﬁcient ma-
nipulation of these states and the network topology. Nodes, links
and, if required, larger subgraphs are stored in a custom-made,
index-based container, which can hold items in different cate-
gories (states). It ensures that items in the same category are
stored in contingent memory and provides both index-based
and category-based access so that selecting a random item in a
given category can be achieved in constant time.

The network structure is modelled directly in memory using
nodes and links as the basic entities in a double adjacency set
representation, in which each node keeps a set of pointers to its
incoming and outgoing links. Addition and removal of links is
thus achieved in logarithmic time so that efﬁcient simulation is
not limited to networks of ﬁxed size. In effect, simulating large
adaptive networks with largenetZ is typically of linear complex-
ity, i.e. the required simulation time scales linearly with the
number of edges in the network for most applications.

The library is not primarily concerned with simulation algo-
rithms, although also providing a basic stochastic simulation
framework implementing Gillespie’s algorithm (Gillespie, 1976)

Fig. 1. Diagrammatic representation of the transformation rules for an
epidemiological model (Gross et al., 2006). (a) a susceptible node (S) is
infected through its link to an infectious neighbour (I) with probability p
per S-I—link and unit time; (b) an infectious node (I) recovers with prob-
ability r; (c) a susceptible node (S) breaks its connection to an infectious
neighbour (I) and rewires to another randomly selected susceptible node
(dashed) with probability w. This last rule makes the network adaptive
because it changes the topology depending on the node states

and one of its variants (Allen and Dytham, 2009). However, the
provided data structures could be used in existing frameworks
focusing on particular simulation algorithms for network dy-
namics, such as the NetEvo package (Gorochowski et al., 2010).

Largenet2 also provides a partial interface to the Boost Graph
Library (Siek et al., 2002) so that many of the latter’s generic
graph algorithms can be used. For implementation details, ex-
amples and source code documentation, please refer to the
website.

The largenet2 library and its predecessor largenet have been
used for the simulations of large adaptive networks in (Bohme
and Gross, 2011; Demirel et al., 2011; Zschaler et al., 2010,
2012). To implement more complex transformation rules than
depicted in Figure 1, the library can be and has been extended
to also track larger network subgraphs involved in such rules,
such as node triplets (e. g. Couzin et al., 2011; Huepe et al., 2011).

The open source library largenet2 is under ongoing develop-
ment. It is set up as a community effort, and contributions are
welcome at http://github.com/biond/largenet2.

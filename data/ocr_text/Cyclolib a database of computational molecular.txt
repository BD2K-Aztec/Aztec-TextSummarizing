Abstract

Motivation: Cyclodextrins (CDs) are amongst the most versatile/multi—functional molecules used in
molecular research and chemical applications. They are natural cyclic oligosaccharides typically
employed to encapsulate hydrophobic groups in their central cavity. This allows solubilizing, pro—
tecting or reducing the toxicity of a large variety of different molecules including drugs, dyes and
surfactant agents. In spite of their great potential, atomic level information of these molecules,
which is key for their function, is really scarce. Computational Molecular Dynamics (MD) simula—
tions have the potential to efficiently fill this gap, providing structural—dynamic information at
atomic level in time scales ranging from ps to us.

Results: Cyclo—Iib is a database with a publicly accessible web—interface containing structural and
dynamic analysis obtained from computational MD simulation trajectories (250 ns long) of native
and modified CDs in explicit water molecules. Cyclo—Iib currently includes 70 CDs typically em—
ployed for fundamental and industrial research. Tools for comparative analysis between different
CDs, as well as to restrict the analysis to specific time—segments within the trajectories are also
available. Cyclo—Iib provides atomic resolution information aimed to complement experimental re—
sults performed with the same molecules.

Availability and Implementation: The data base is freely available under http://cyclo—Iib.mduse.com/.

1 Introduction

OXFORD

 

Cyclodextrins (CDs) are cyclic oligosaccharides formed by 6 (0t—
CD), 7 (B—CD) or 8 (y—CD) glucopyranoside groups (GPUs) that play
a relevant role in different fields such as pharmacy, medicine, chem—
istry, materials design, food or agricultural science (Ain et 61].,
2015). By taking advantage of the different accessibility and

reactivity of the primary and secondary hydroxyl groups of the na—
tive (0t, [3, y—)CDs, specifically designed chemical modifications
allow their selective functionalization in order to affect their physi-
cochemical and pharmaceutical properties (solubility, surface prop—
erties, complexation efficiency, control release, aggregation). New

and interesting perspectives for their use have emerged in recent
years by the development of novel CD derivatives (Otero—Espinar
et al., 2014). Despite the increasing number of patents and articles
based on CDs, only a tiny fraction of that literature contains atomic
level structural/dynamic information and even less includes results
from computational simulations. The development and optimization
of applications using CDs has been traditionally based on trial and
error essays supported by wet—lab experiments. While the pharma-
ceutical industry has successfully incorporated computational mo—
lecular modeling tools into the drug—design process, other chemical
sectors where CDs are involved (textile, food, cosmetics, cleaning,
painting, agriculture, etc.) have not extensively used this type of
computational tools. It is worth noting that the chemical processes
involved in all these industries, including the pharmaceutical, are
similar.

In contrast to what is commonly assumed, it is known that CDs
are not rigid (Dodziuk, 2002). Their flexibility is key in the way they
interact to the surrounding molecules. Unlike other computational
simulation methods, MD allows studying molecules in motion as
well as to include the explicit interaction with the solvent and with
other solutes, making the results more reliable.

Here, we present a web—based database with structural and dy—
namic analysis results obtained from computational MD simulation
trajectories of native and modified CDs in explicit water molecules.
Tools to easily compare the behaviour of different CDs obtained
from the corresponding MD trajectories are included in Cyclo—lib.
Due to their interesting physicochemical properties, there is a grow—
ing interest by the research community in using CDs for a number of
applications based on their ability to encapsulate hydrophobic
groups or to form nanoaggregates (Ryzhakov et al., 2016). The lack
of information about these molecules at atomic scale seriously limits
the capacity of researches to rationally modify their structure and
also to predict their behaviour at different levels. Cyclo—lib provides
not only the most probable structures and a detailed analysis of a
large number of CDs in aqueous solution but also the parameter files
required to perform more complex simulation studies including
docking, aggregation or adsorption to interfaces. So, we do expect
that the new insight provided by this database will significantly con-
tribute to the ongoing efforts worldwide to design novel CD deriva—
tives as well as to widen the range of applications based on these
molecules (Fig. 1).

2 Methods

The simulations of all CDs contained in the database were carried
out with GROMACS 4.6 package (Hess et al., 2008). The topolo—
gies were generated using the 53a6 version of the GROMOS force
field (Oostenbrink et al., 2004). Each system was solvated using the
SPC water model, partially optimized, thermalized and equilibrated,
followed by unrestrained simulations for 250 ns (time step=2 fs).
The simulation parameters and protocol were the same employed in
a recent work for the simulations in aqueous solution (Mixcoha
et al., 2014). RMSD, H—bond, number of water molecules in differ-
ent spheres around CDs, rotation angles of the GPUs and cluster
analysis were carried out using GROMACS tools or locally written
code. All data are stored in a database, using the structured query
language (SQL) to ensure portability. The website is created with
HTML5 and PHP for the server side operations and Javascript for
the client side to represent CDs and graphics. Cyclo—lib uses Jmol
(an open—source Java viewer for chemical structures in 3D. http://
www.jmol.org) to show the molecular structures of CDs.

3 Discussion

Cyclo—lib freely provides detailed analysis of long MD simulation
trajectories for a set of over 70 modified CDs. The CDs are identi—
fied by their GPU chemical composition. All features, including
structures, plots, movies and even trajectories and simulation par—
ameter files are available. Among the basic functionalities, three—
dimensional visualization of the CDs and their constitutive GPUs, a
chemical description, and a search engine of structures are included.
More advanced functionalities allow comparative analyses of differ-
ent properties of molecules averaged over different time periods that
can be easily selected by the user. The properties that can be ana—
lyzed include: the number of both intramolecular hydrogen bonds
both and those between the molecule and the solvent, the mean
square deviation with respect to the initial structure, the number of
water molecules in spheres centered in the CD cavity with radii of
0.5 and 1.0 nm, the radius of gyration of the molecule, the radius of
the cavity, accessible to the solvent surface areas and the angle be—
tween each GPU and the symmetry axis of the CD. A dynamic ana-
lysis is also shown for each CD, representing these properties as a
function of time along the different trajectories, a description of the
simulation conditions and a selection of the representative structures
obtained from cluster analysis based on quadratic mean deviations.

Presently, all the simulations are based on one of the most widely
used force fields (GROMOS56a6). There are plans to include mod—
els based on other force fields. Further simulations with modified
CDs will be added to the database in the future and the inclusion of
other molecules such as cyclic peptides or calixarenes are not dis—
carded. Our aim is to build up a large database of MD simulations
of modified CDs that can be used to provide structural/dynamic in—
formation at atomic resolution aimed to complement experimental
results performed with the same molecules in the wet—lab as well as
to contribute in the design of new CDs derivatives.

Abstract

Motivation: Capabilities in the field of metabolomics have grown tremendously in recent years.
Many existing resources contain the chemical properties and classifications of commonly identi—
fied metabolites. However, the annotation of small molecules (both endogenous and synthetic) to
meaningful biological pathways and concepts still lags behind the analytical capabilities and the
chemistry—based annotations. Furthermore, no tools are available to visually explore relationships
and networks among functionally related groups of metabolites (biomedical concepts). Such a tool
would provide the ability to establish testable hypotheses regarding links among metabolic path—
ways, cellular processes, phenotypes and diseases.

Results: Here we present ConceptMetab, an interactive web—based tool for mapping and exploring
the relationships among 16 069 biologically defined metabolite sets developed from Gene
Ontology, KEGG and Medical Subject Headings, using both KEGG and PubChem compound identi—
fiers, and based on statistical tests for association. We demonstrate the utility of ConceptMetab
with multiple scenarios, showing it can be used to identify known and potentially novel relation—
ships among metabolic pathways, cellular processes, phenotypes and diseases, and provides an
intuitive interface for linking compounds to their molecular functions and higher level biological
effects.

1 Introduction

In recent years, metabolomics has emerged as a new quantitative
technique with the ability to characterize large numbers of small
molecules in a wide variety of biological samples. Advances in liquid
chromatography—mass spectrometry (LC—MS), gas chromatog—
raphy—mass spectrometry (GC—MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance
spectroscopy (NMR), allow rapid and quantitative measurement of

several hundreds of metabolites (Jonsson et 61]., 2004; Wishart,
2011). Untargeted LC—MS based methods have potential to push
the number of detected metabolites to several thousands, however
securing the identities of the individual features remains challenging
and time consuming (Baker, 2011). As experimental detection meth—
ods continue to improve, metabolomics has the potential to provide
increasingly informative readouts of metabolic changes in complex

diseases (Sreekumar et 61]., 2009; Urayama et 61]., 2010; Wang et 61].,
2011; Wisloff et 61]., 2005; Yap et 61]., 2010). In contrast to genes
and proteins, metabolites have been described as providing direct
signatures of biochemical activity and are therefore easier to correl—
ate with phenotype (Patti et 61]., 2012).

Following these technological advances, a number of pathway
databases and tools linking metabolites to biochemical reactions, en—
zymes, proteins and genes were developed (reviewed in (Sas et 61].,
2015)). Among these, there are several tools for metabolite set en—
richment testing, including MSEA (Xia and Wishart, 2010),
MetaboAnalyst 2.0 (Xia et 61]., 2012) and MBRole (Chagoyen and
Pazos, 2011). These programs follow the paradigm of gene set en—
richment tools, which test for biological functions or pathways (e.g.
Gene Ontology (GO) (Harris et 61]., 2004) or KEGG Pathways
(Kanehisa et 61]., 2012)) that have significant gene overlap with an
experimentally derived set of genes (Khatri et 61]., 2012).

Biological interpretation of metabolites has unique challenges
compared to genes, including a relatively small number of measur-
able metabolites, low coverage of those by annotation databases,
and the presence of ubiquitous metabolites (e.g. co—factors). To im—
prove the annotation of small molecules to their biological contexts,
we developed Metab2Mesh (Sartor et 61]., 2012), which contains 4
646 000 significant associations (P < 0.0001) between 99 871 com—
pounds and 20 683 biomedical terms. Metab2MeSH uses PubChem
and Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms to identify statistically
significant co—occurrences of metabolites and MeSH terms in pub—
lished manuscripts, thus annotating metabolites to biomedical con—
cepts via the literature.

An additional challenge to working with metabolites is the lack
of convenient, standardized identifiers. While IUPAC nomenclature
provides a systematic method of naming organic compounds and
chemists use the CAS Registry Number, biologists prefer more fa-
miliar names that often ignore counter—ions. Consequently, biolo—
gical databases often contain such names or use their own
identifiers. To address these challenges, careful assembly of metabol—
ite sets with synonyms and cross—references is needed.

Due to these challenges, metabolite enrichment testing has not
been as widely used as for genes. Enrichment testing among pre-
defined biologically relevant metabolite sets can help us better
understand and overcome the above challenges, and improve enrich-
ment testing with experimental data. The careful assembly, charac—
terization and exploration of metabolite sets could facilitate the
discovery of relationships among metabolic reactions, diseases and
other biological phenomena in terms of the metabolites involved.
Indeed, several tools for exploring similar relationships based on
gene sets exist (Araki et 61]., 2012; Perez—Llamas and Lopez-Bigas,
2011; Rhodes et 61]., 2007; Sartor et 61]., 2010) and have been funda—
mental in generating novel hypotheses and identifying unexpected
associations. However, no comparable tool based on small metabol—
ites yet exists.

We have developed ConceptMetab to explore the relationships
among metabolite—based biomedical concepts and generate novel
hypotheses. Metabolites were annotated to biomedical concepts
using KEGG (Kanehisa et 61]., 2012), the three branches of GO and
Medical Subject headings from the National Library of Medicine
(MeSH) (Coletti and Bleich, 2001). Statistically significant associ—
ations were identified among all pairs of metabolite sets (concepts),
and maintained with additional supporting information. The
ConceptMetab website enables searching, browsing, filtering and
data exporting capabilities, as well as complementary visualizations
(network graphs and heatmaps). We demonstrate the utility of
ConceptMetab with example workflows, and by illustrating

important relationships identified with metabolites that were not
identified with genes. In summary, ConceptMetab assists in under—
standing links between metabolites, metabolic pathways and biolo—
gical phenomena, phenotypes, environmental exposures and
diseases.

2 Methods

2.1 Mapping small molecules to annotations

Small molecules were annotated to 74 KEGG human metabolic
pathways based on the XML pathway representations from the
Summer 2011 freeze of KEGG. Metabolites were annotated to GO
terms in two stages. First, KEGG Pathways were used to map me—
tabolites to genes through chemical reactions. Second, the
Bioconductor package org.Hs.eg.db (R version 3.1.1) was used to
map genes to GO terms, providing a complete mapping from metab—
olites to GO. GO terms are partitioned by their three branches:
Biological Process (BP), Cellular Component (CC) and Molecular
Function (MF). Enzyme metabolite sets were created by combining
all metabolites involved in a reaction with the same enzyme. The
metabolite—to—gene mappings from KEGG were used again, and the
org.Hs.eg.db package was used to map genes to enzymes.

Small molecules were annotated to MeSH terms by their co—oc—
currences in biomedical literature (PubMed database, updated to
version 14 on May 19, 2014) using Metab2MeSH (Sartor et 61].,
2012). Brieﬂy, Metab2MeSH considers a PubChem compound to be
associated with a MeSH term if the number of co—occurring annota-
tions to PubMed articles is significant according to a two—sided
Fisher’s exact test. We selected the most relevant top—level MeSH
categories for use in ConceptMetab (Fig. 1). Because some MeSH
terms occur in more than one top—level category, we assigned
membership according to the following priority: (i) Diseases,
(ii) Phenomena and Process, (iii) Psychiatry and Psychology,
(iv) Anatomy, (v) Organisms and (vi) Technology, Industry,
Agriculture. In all cases, we retain only those concepts associated
with 25 compounds. Figure 1 gives a diagrammatic overview of the

compound-to-concept mappings.

The resulting mappings linking compounds to biological con—
cepts are stored in a MySQL database. The same relational database
is also used to store all testing results, as described in Section 2.3
below.

2.2 Compound dictionary

To compare MeSH terms (based on PubChem IDs) to the other con—
cept types (based on KEGG IDs), we used the dictionary previously
developed for Metab2MeSH (Sartor et al., 2012). In Metab2MeSH,
KEGG IDs are linked to PubChem substance IDs (SIDs) via the
KEGG REST API (http://www.kegg.jp/kegg/rest/). The SIDs are
linked to PubChem compound IDs (CIDs) via PubChem (Wang
et al., 2009).

We observed some PubChem compounds having the same name,
or differing only by capitalization, that had different CIDs.
Therefore, all PubChem compound names were transformed to
lower—case, and assigned a new internal ID to each instance where
the lower—case names match. Next, any existing CID to KEGG ID
links were propagated to all newly equivalent CIDs from the previ—
ous step. About 5500 uninformative compounds that had purely nu—
meric or alpha-numeric names in PubChem and were not connected
to a KEGG ID were removed. In all, ConceptMetab has 97 104
unique compounds, 68 556 with 21 annotation. Among these, 15
231 have both a KEGG ID and a PubChem CID, 1629 have only a
KEGG ID, and 80 244 have only a PubChem ID.

2.3 Metabolite set enrichment testing

We tested for associated metabolite sets using a modified one—sided
Fisher’s exact test (FET) which tests whether the number of com—
pounds in both concepts exceeds that expected by chance relative to
the background set of compounds. Given two concepts, the back—
ground set of compounds was the intersection of the sets of com—
pounds in all concepts in the two concept types (e.g. all compounds
annotated in both GO and MeSH diseases if testing a GO term ver—
sus a disease). We modified FET by subtracting one from the inter-
section of the two concepts, as has previously been done (Huang da
et al., 2009; Sartor et al., 2010). This modification results in a more
conservative test for small concepts, which are more likely be af-
fected by chance co—occurrences, while having minimal effect on
large concepts. After computing p—values and odds ratios for all
pairs of concepts, we applied the False Discovery Rate (FDR) mul-
tiple testing correction of Benjamini and Hochberg and stored all re—
sults in the database.

2.4 Visualizing relationships among concepts

The main benefits of ConceptMetab are its interactivity, various
workﬂows and visualizations (Supplementary Fig. S1). The web
interface was built using Grails and Javascript, which communicate
with the MySQL database. Users can either browse or query a com—
pound or concept (disease, biological process, etc.) and choose
among the matches to obtain an overview of results. In the case of
a concept, users can obtain the significantly overlapping concepts,
filter the results, and either output tabular results or visualize the re—
sulting relationships as network graphs or a heatmap created via
hierarchical clustering. In the case of a compound, users can retrieve
all concepts to which it is annotated and further analyze those
concepts.

The Cytoscape Web Javascript API is used to display the two
interactive network graphs: the star network and the complete net—
work. In both cases, nodes represent concepts; their size and color
represent the number of compounds and the concept type,

respectively. Graph edges represent significant enrichment at user—
defined levels between concepts (default FDR <0.05 and odds ratio
>0). The star network displays only edges connected to the selected
concept (Supplementary Fig. S1E) while the complete network
shows relationships among all of the concepts enriched relative to
the selected concept (Supplementary Fig. 81F). Clicking a node gives
concept information, and clicking an edge gives FET results and lists
the compounds intersecting the two concepts connected by that
edge.

The interactive heatmap, created using the gplots R package, il—
lustrates which compounds are responsible for the enrichment of
each concept, and the similarity among those concepts relative to
the selected concept (Supplementary Fig. 81G). Rows and columns
are hierarchically clustered using the Euclidean distance metric and
average—linkage criterion. Heatmaps displayed on the website are
interactive, and the underlying, unclustered data is available for
download.

For visual clarity, networks may not exceed 200 concepts
(nodes). For heatmaps, if the concept of interest has more than 2000
compounds, up to 200 concepts can be selected. When the concept
of interest has between 1000 and 2000 compounds, up to 500 con—
cepts can be selected. Users may filter concepts by P—value, q—value,
or odds ratio, or may select individual concepts for the network or
heatmap in the table view.

2.5 Viewing metabolite sets as networks in Metscape
When viewing the list of metabolites in a concept, users have the op—
tion to visualize the KEGG compounds in the MetScape plug—in of
Cytoscape (Karnovsky et al., 2012) using the automatic web—start
feature. Metscape will construct a network of metabolites and meta—
bolic reactions that allows users to explore the interactions between
metabolites, enzymes and genes as determined by metabolic
pathways.

3 Results

3.1 Overview of the ConceptMetab database
ConceptMetab annotates 68 556 compounds to 16 069 biomedical
concepts including diseases, metabolic pathways, cellular processes
and components, phenotypes, environmental exposures and organ—
isms. Concepts originate from 11 concept types: KEGG Pathways,
GO, Enzymes (defined by the metabolites involved in their associ—
ated chemical reactions) and six of the top level MeSH categories
(https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/). Figure 1 shows how compounds
were mapped to each of the concepts for the different annotation
sources. The number of concepts in a concept type ranges from 74
(KEGG Pathways) to 4089 (MeSH Diseases). Concept sizes vary
widely across concept types (Supplementary Fig. S2), with the mean
number of compounds in a concept ranging from 11 (Enzymes) to
404 (MeSH Phenomena and Processes; Table 1). The broad range of
concept sizes is reﬂective of the widely differing number of com-
pounds required for very specific chemical tasks compared to much
broader biological phenomena.

Compounds were annotated to radically different numbers of
concepts, ranging from 1 to 1611. A few compounds were anno—
tated to a large number of concepts while the majority occurred in
fewer than eight (Supplementary Fig. S3). The compounds anno—
tated to the most concepts were: arachidonate, ATP, AMP, cyclic
AMP, GTP, water, cyclic GMP, nitric oxide, glutathione and linole-
ate (Supplementary Table S1). The distributions for the 3 GO
branches were the least skewed among the concept types, with

A dictionary mapping between KEGG and PubChem IDs makes
concepts from KEGG Pathways, GO terms and Enzymes compar—
able to MeSH terms. Upon testing the statistical significance of over—
lap among all 129 098 346 possible pairs of concepts, a total of 10
334 760 pairs (8%) were statistically significant (FDR < 0.05), pro-
viding a rich network of interactions to explore.

3.2 ConceptMetab workflow
The ConceptMetab website (http://conceptmetab.med.umich.edu)
allows users to explore biomedical concepts and their relationships
to one another in a variety of ways. As specific examples, it can be
used to (i) examine the links between an enzyme such as ‘17—beta—
estradiol 17—dehydrogenase’ and diseases (70 MeSH Diseases are
significant with q—value<0.05) via their common metabolites;
(ii) query a disease or phenotype such as ‘confusion’ to identify rela—
tionships with processes or other diseases, and the small molecules
on which those relationships are based; or (iii) explore the biological
annotations of a specific compound of interest, and relationships
among them. Users can choose a concept type and then browse the
list of concepts in that type, or concepts may be searched directly
(Supplementary Fig. 81A and B). Users may also search for a par—
ticular compound of interest. Supplementary Table S2 shows how
ConceptMetab’s features differ from other metabolite analysis tools.
Upon selecting a concept, a summary page provides: (i) a list of
the compounds in the concept, (ii) filtering options, (iii) a link to the
originating database, (iv) the percent of significant terms in each
concept type and (v) links to visualizations including a star network,
a complete network, a heatmap and a table view (Supplementary
Fig. 81C). The table provides the metabolite enrichment testing re—
sults, including P—values, FDR values, odds ratios and numbers of
overlapping compounds (Supplementary Fig. 81D). Users may ad—
just the P—value or FDR cutoff, and also use a cutoff on the odds
ratio. Users can link to the list of compounds annotated to both the
queried term and any of the enriched terms, and then link to
PubChem or KEGG for more information on a compound. Users
can also visualize the compounds in metabolic networks using a
one—click link to the MetScape Cytoscape plugin (Karnovsky et al.,
2012), where there is information about metabolic reactions, en—
zymes, genes and pathways. The star network shows which concepts
have significant overlap with the concept of interest given the

selected cutoffs (Supplementary Fig. 81E). The complete network
adds significant interactions among all of the associated concepts in
the star network (Supplementary Fig. S1F).

The heatmap illustrates the relationships between compounds in
the queried metabolite set and the enriched concepts to which they
belong. This allows users to find groups of compounds that are
closely related functionally, and to determine which compounds
were responsible for the enrichment of particular concepts
(Supplementary Fig. S1G).

3.3 Significant relationships among metabolite
annotation sources

Of the greater than 10 million (8%) significant concept pairs, 4.1
million (39%) were within the same concept type while 6.3 million
(61%) were between concept types. Overall, 18% of the tests within
a concept type and 6% of tests between two concept types were sig—
nificant. At the concept type level, KEGG ID—based concept types
(Enzyme, GO and KEGG Pathway) have a greater percentage of sig—
nificant associations with other KEGG—based concepts compared to
PubChem—based concepts, and the same is true for PubChem—based
concepts (Fig. 2). This is likely because only a subset of the com—
pounds could be mapped between KEGG and PubChem. Certain
concept types, most notably MeSH Psychology and Psychiatry, have
a large degree of overlap in compounds among their concepts
(lighter squares along the diagonal in Fig. 2). Others such as
Enzymes, KEGG Pathways and MeSH Organisms, have more
unique non—overlapping metabolite sets. Although the percentages
are smaller, we found the most interesting associations to be be—
tween KEGG ID—based annotation concepts and MeSH—based con—
cepts, as these often link molecular level reactions or cellular
processes (KEGG—based) to macro—scale biological phenomena, such
as diseases, anatomy, diet, environmental exposure, or other

phenotypes (MeSH—based). In any user workﬂow, one can easily fil-
ter to any such subset of results of interest.

3.4 Comparing biological associations based on
metabolites to those based on genes

Although our development of an interactive tool for exploring rela-
tionships among biological metabolite—sets is novel, similar tools for
gene—based concepts are relatively well—established. We therefore
wanted to assess how well metabolites can predict relationships be—
tween various biological phenomena and diseases compared to
genes. ConceptMetab annotates 68 5 5 6 compounds to 16 069 biolo—
gical concepts, and includes concepts based on molecular evidence
(GO, KEGG and Enzymes) and biomedical literature (MeSH); a
similar database based on genes (ConceptGen (Sartor et al., 2010))
annotates 36 393 genes to 21 086 biological concepts, includes
many of the same concept types, and uses the same approach for
determining significant association between pairs of concepts.

We compared associations identified between MeSH Disease
and MeSH Phenomena 8C Processes. We based our comparison on
two MeSH—based concepts (as opposed to MeSH Disease versus
GO) because both metabolites and genes are assigned to MeSH
terms using the same approach, resulting in a fair comparison of me-
tabolites versus genes. ConceptMetab and ConceptGen tested the
association of all such pairs of concepts, identifying 857 378 and
5147 to be significant (FDR < 0.05), respectively. The main reason
for the drastically higher number of significant metabolite—based as—
sociations is that the majority of MeSH terms did not have 25 genes
assigned to them, which was a requirement for the test. Overall, 10
515 concept pairs had at least two elements in common and were
tested for association based on both metabolites and genes. Among
these, 3853 pairs were significant in both approaches, 757 uniquely
significant based on genes, and 851 uniquely significant based on
metabolites, indicating a high level of agreement when sufficient
data exists for both metabolites and genes. However, overall these
results point to a strong advantage to using metabolite—based associ—
ations, as these result in a > 100—fold increase in the ability to detect
associations owing to there being more compounds than genes, and
having more compounds annotated to biological functions.

Interestingly, the top 10 types of MeSH Phenomena 8C Processes
terms that are associated with the most diseases in ConceptMetab
are in the Organic Chemistry Phenomena, Chemical Processes, Cell
Physiological Processes, Metabolism, Biophysical Phenomena and
Biochemical Phenomena branches of the MeSH tree. On the other
hand, the top 10 types of MeSH Phenomena 8C Processes terms
uniquely significant based on genes are in the Genetic Variation,
Phenotype, Gene Frequency, Inheritance Patterns and Genotype
branches of the MeSH tree. We found that the terms uniquely en—
riched in ConceptMetab tended to be more biologically meaningful
than those based on genes, for example ‘cell cycle, drug resistance,
DNA damage, and platelet aggregation’ as opposed to ‘phenotype,
genetic markers, gene frequency, linkage disequilibrium, and
genotype’. This illustrates the important (and until now unexplored)
contribution that metabolites make to understanding of the relation—
ships among biological concepts.

Doing a similar analysis for MeSH Disease terms, among those
uniquely enriched in ConceptMetab we found Nervous and
Digestive System Neoplasms, Neurodegenerative Diseases,
Neoplastic Processes, Pancreatic and Liver Diseases, Endocrine
Gland Neoplasms and Metabolic Diseases within the top 20 types of
diseases. In contrast, we find Graft versus Host Disease, Bronchial
and Joint Diseases, Connective Tissue and Joint Diseases, RNA

Virus Infections and Vascular Diseases uniquely enriched based on
genes. Indeed, there are diseases and biological concepts where me—
tabolites play a more important role than genes, and vice versa.

3.5 Using ConceptMetab to understand the molecular
and anatomical risks and effects of a disease
Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease of the arteries and is
characterized by an accumulation of lipids within the artery wall,
which can lead to reduced blood ﬂow and infarction. Consequently,
atherosclerosis is more than an inflammatory disease; it is also a
leading cause of heart attack and stroke (Ross, 1993).

Atherosclerosis is a MeSH Disease concept in ConceptMetab with
755 compounds. It is significantly associated with 203 GO terms, 425
MeSH Phenomena and Processes concepts, 488 MeSH Anatomy con—
cepts, and others at the FDR < 0.05 level. In particular, MeSH
Anatomy concepts such as ‘Endothelium’, ‘Macrophages’,
‘Monocytes’, ‘T—lymphocytes’, ‘Blood platelets’ and various specific
arteries are significantly associated with atherosclerosis. MeSH
Phenomena and Processes that are significantly associated with ath—
erosclerosis include ‘Vasoconstriction’, ‘Platelet adhesiveness’ and
‘Platelet aggregation’.

These terms are expected because atherosclerosis is localized to
the inner walls (endothelium) of arteries, wherein monocyte—derived
macrophages and subtypes of T—lymphocytes mediate the inflamma-
tory response. The inflammatory response in turn increases adhe—
siveness of the endothelium, especially with respect to blood
platelets, resulting in platelet aggregation. Ultimately, the increased
adhesion and aggregation within the artery contributes to vasocon—
striction (Ross, 1999).

ConceptMetab also finds a number of GO terms associated with
atherosclerosis. Fatty acid catabolism, metabolism and biosynthesis
are enriched, along with ‘Smooth muscle contraction’, ‘Foam cell
differentiation’ and ‘Prostanoid metabolic process’. The inflamma—
tory response is partly mediated by prostanoids, and foam cell for—
mation, in conjunction with smooth muscle migration, contributes
to the growth of the fatty atherosclerotic lesion.

As noted above, atherosclerosis is an inﬂammatory disease that is
the leading cause of heart attack and stroke. ConceptMetab finds
MeSH Disease concepts such as ‘Inﬂammation’, ‘Myocardial infarc-
tion’ and ‘Stroke’ to be highly associated with atherosclerosis, thus
predicting comorbidities. Risk factors such as ‘Hypercholesterolemia’
and ‘Atherosclerotic plaque’ are also found. Overall, ConceptMetab
correctly associates numerous risk factors, molecular mechanisms,
anatomical features and observed downstream effects with athero—
sclerosis, providing a comprehensive overview of related biological
concepts and the metabolites that explain these relationships.

3.6 Using ConceptMetab to investigate the diseases
associated with an aberrant biological process

The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a well—studied cellular re—
sponse that occurs under stress and is tightly coupled with endoplas—
mic reticulum stress. The UPR can be either pro—survival or pro—
apoptotic, depending on specific cellular conditions, and leads to the
induction of a specific battery of genes while repressing a wealth of
genes transcribed under normal growth conditions to allow the cell
to regain control. In ConceptMetab, ‘Unfolded Protein Response’ is
represented as a MeSH Phenomena and Processes concept, with 189
compounds, and with 36 significantly enriched GO terms and 255
MeSH Diseases at the FDR < 0.05 level and restricting to terms
with odds ratio >8.

In the table view, many well—known relationships are readily
identified at the cellular level at the top of the list, including
‘Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress’, ‘Cell Death’ and ‘Autophagy’,
‘Gene Silencing’, heat—shock response, protein folding and transport,
and oxidative phosphorylation. Creating a heatmap of the signifi-
cantly associated diseases, we saw they fall into four main groups
(Fig. 3). Continuing to the interactive heatmap, we saw that the first
group corresponded to anemias, deficiencies, toxic poisonings, and
a few neurologic diseases that all have in common glutathione, glu-
tamine and several related derivatives. The second group involved
blood, bone and heart—related diseases which mainly had calcium-
related compounds in common, and the third group consisted
mainly of diabetes and nutritional diseases and were related by sev—
eral sugar compounds, and insulin/velosulin. Finally, the last group
of diseases contained many neoplasms having drugs in common,
including borozimib, which is known to induce ER stress

and lead to apoptosis. Several specific protein—folding related dis—
eases in these groups were Lipoatrophic Diabetes Mellitus, ‘Insulin
Resistance’, ‘Fatty Liver’, ‘Neurodegenerative Diseases’, fibrotic dis—
eases (Lenna and Trojanowska, 2012), cadmium poisoning
(Gardarin et al., 2010) and lymphomas. We also identified less
known relationships with the UPR that are supported by the litera—
ture nonetheless. For example, Sturge—Weber syndrome, a rare
neurological and skin disease, was identified as significant (q—value
: 1.3 x 10"), and clicking on the number of overlapping com—
pounds shows this relationship includes galactose, hexose and glu—
cose. Recently it was observed that oxidative stress (the UPR is
closely linked to OS and is activated upon OS exposure), may play
an important role in the pathogenicity of Sturge—Weber syndrome
(Kadam et al., 2012).

3.7 Using ConceptMetab to explore relationships
between metabolic pathways and diseases

To explore relationships between metabolic pathways and diseases,
we took the significant KEGG Pathway—MeSH Disease concept pairs
and imported the data into Cytoscape. Figure 4 shows the resulting
network. Not surprisingly, there are several network hubs (dia—
monds) representing a relatively small number of pathways con—
nected to a large number of diseases (squares). Some of the pathway

Unfolded Protein Response. Each row represents a MeSH disease and each
column is a compound. The UPR is associated with four main groups of dis-
eases, defined by the types of overlapping compounds. From here, users
may click to proceed to an interactive heatmap view

hubs, such as amino acid metabolism, are connected to many well—
documented metabolic diseases, e.g. ‘Inborn Errors of Amino Acid
Metabolism’ and ‘Ornithine Cabamoyltransferase Deficiency
Disease’. Other expected connections include steroid metabolism
and hormone dependent neoplasms (e.g. breast and prostate cancer),
retinol metabolism and anemia and many others. Interestingly, the
central highly interconnected network component includes amino
acid (alanine, aspartate arginine, proline, glutamine/glutamate, gly—
cine, serine and threonine, branched chain amino acids), fatty acid
and energy metabolism (glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation) path—
ways that share many of the same disease connections. Given the
central role of these pathways as part of primary metabolism, it is
not surprising that their dysregulation has implications for a variety
of diseases ranging from brain injuries to cancers to metabolic dis—
eases. Since our pathway — disease network is based on biochemical
pathways and literature—derived metabolite concepts, we expect it to
be biased towards diseases that are linked to metabolic dysregula—
tions that have been sufficiently described in publications.

3.8 Using ConceptMetab to explore the biological roles
of a metabolite

One of the challenges in analyzing metabolomics data is connecting
the experimentally observed changes to the associated phenotypes.
The usual analysis workﬂow involves mapping metabolites to
known metabolic pathways (Lanza et al., 2010). This helps establish
connections between metabolites and a relatively small portion of
genes encoding metabolic enzymes, but often neglects broader biolo—
gical context. Pathway databases have relatively low representation
of experimentally detected metabolites, which further limits their
utility. ConceptMetab provides an alternative way to explore biolo—
gical connections of metabolites. To demonstrate the compound
analysis capabilities of ConceptMetab, we selected gamma—hydroxy—
butyrate (GHB, 4—hydroxybutanoate), a compound notoriously
known as a date rape drug (Bendinskas et al., 2011) and a club drug
(Gahlinger, 2004). GHB also has well—documented medicinal uses
(Mamelak et al., 1986), is found naturally at low concentrations in
the mammalian brain (Vayer et al., 1987), and accumulates in pa—
tients with succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) defi—
ciency (Pearl et al., 2003).

ConceptMetab shows that GHB is part of 106 concepts that
span seven MeSH headings, including Anatomy and Diseases.
Predictably, GHB was linked to Central Nervous System (CNS),
Alcoholism and Brain Ischemia. Each of these concepts contains
hundreds of compounds. We proceeded to select these three con—
cepts and built a complete network (Fig. 5). ConceptMetab provides
an easy way to explore the overlap between the concepts displayed
in the Complete Network view. Clicking on the edge connecting the
concept nodes displays the list of compounds shared between them.
The Alcoholism — Brain Ischemia edge and the CNS — Brain
Ischemia edge both list taurine, a compound which, like GHB, has
neuro—protective properties (Shuaib, 2003). Interestingly, taurine is
being tested as a potential treatment in patients with the SSADH de—
ficiency (Pearl et al., 2014). Inspection of the CNS — Alcoholism
edge includes baclofen, which is a specific agonist of GABA-B recep-
tors used for alcoholism treatment (Addolorato et al., 2000) but is
also known to help with GHB withdrawal (LeTourneau et al.,
2008). Thus, ConceptMetab helps find known as well as unexpected
useful chemical links between biological concepts.

4 Discussion

As the ultimate readout of metabolic state, metabolomics has the po—
tential to transform our understanding of mechanisms underlying
disease and further enhance knowledge generation through integra-
tion with other omics data. As experimental metabolomics matures
and the number of measurable metabolites approaches the estimated
number of endogenous metabolites, metabolomics together with
transcriptomics, proteomics and epigenomics will provide a compre—
hensive understanding of a biological system as a whole. While
gene—based technologies, analysis methods and annotation have well
established standards and an abundance of relevant bioinformatics
software, the parallel requirements for high throughput metabolo—
mics still lag far behind. As a step towards bridging this gap, we
have developed a tool that annotates both endogenous and synthetic
small compounds to various types of biological concepts, and that
provides interactive exploration of the relationships among these
concepts. With the novel MeSH—based annotation source, we have
increased the number of annotated metabolites by ~25—fold and

Fig. 5. ConceptMetab complete network. Network nodes represent concepts.
By clicking on an edge user can obtain the information about compounds
that are in common between concepts

shown that many relevant relationships not identified by genes are
identified via metabolites.

The ability to visualize relationships not only between pairs of
metabolite sets but also the network structure among many can help
bridge the gaps from molecular level to phenotype level to popula—
tion level biomedical concepts. No other program allows testing for
significant enrichment among predefined metabolite sets. The few
programs that currently offer enrichment testing of experimental
metabolite sets only annotate a small minority of compounds. The
next step will be to expand upon ConceptMetab to offer such ana—
lysis with greatly expanded annotation.

In ConceptMetab, both KEGG and PubChem IDs were used to
maximize annotation, giving us the benefits of both traditional an—
notation sources such as KEGG and GO, and our MeSH term anno—
tations. We chose KEGG because it is well—established, consistent
and cross—referenced with PubChem. We recognize that other data—
bases such as BioCyc (Caspi et al., 2014), Recon2 (Thiele et al.,
2013), Reactome (Croft et al., 2014) and SMPDB (Jewison et al.,
2014) may provide a complimentary view of metabolic pathways.
Overall, ConceptMetab provides a rich resource documenting rela—
tionships among different types of metabolite—based concepts, which
will aid in understanding the complex and interrelated biological
roles of metabolites.

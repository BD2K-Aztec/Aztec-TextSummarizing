ABSTRACT

Motivation: Network inference approaches are widely used to shed
light on regulatory interplay between molecular players such as genes
and proteins. Biochemical processes underlying networks of interest
(e.g. gene regulatory or protein signalling networks) are generally non-
linear. In many settings, knowledge is available concerning relevant
chemical kinetics. However, existing network inference methods for
continuous, steady-state data are typically rooted in statistical formu-
lations, which do not exploit chemical kinetics to guide inference.
Results: Herein, we present an approach to network inference for
steady-state data that is rooted in non-linear descriptions of biochem-
ical mechanism. We use equilibrium analysis of chemical kinetics to
obtain functional forms that are in turn used to infer networks using
steady-state data. The approach we propose is directly applicable to
conventional steady-state gene expression or proteomic data and
does not require knowledge of either network topology or any kinetic
parameters. We illustrate the approach in the context of protein phos-
phorylation networks, using data simulated from a recent mechanistic
model and proteomic data from cancer cell lines. In the former, the
true network is known and used for assessment, whereas in the latter,
results are compared against known biochemistry. We find that the
proposed methodology is more effective at estimating network top-
ology than methods based on linear models.

1 INTRODUCTION

Networks of molecular components play a prominent role in
molecular and systems biology. A graph G=(V(G), E(G)) can
be used to describe a biological network, with vertex set V(G)
identified with molecular components (e.g. genes or proteins)
and edge set E(G) with regulatory interplay between the compo-
nents. Edges in a biological network are often associated with the
causal notion that intervention on a parent node influences its
child node(s). Data-driven characterization of the graph struc-
ture E(G) (often referred to as the topology) is known as network

inference and has emerged as an important problem class in
bioinformatics and systems biology. Network inference can aid
in efficient generation of biological hypotheses from high-
throughput data. Further, network inference can aid in exploring
molecular interplay that is associated with speciﬁc phenotypes,
such as disease states.

From a statistical perspective, network inference entails
reverse-engineering a graph G using biochemical data D and,
where available, prior knowledge regarding aspects of the top-
ology. Over the last decade, many methods for network inference
have been proposed (see e.g. Lee and Tzou, 2009; Markowetz
and Spang, 2007). To date, most methods for network inference
have been rooted in discrete or linear formulations (Bender et al.,
2010; Hill, 2012; Morrissey et al., 2010; Opgen-Rhein and
Strimmer, 2007; Sachs et al., 2005). As discussed in Oates and
Mukherjee (2012a), a wide range of existing approaches can be
viewed as variants of the statistical linear model (‘linear’ refers to
linearity in parameters, so that nonlinear basis functions may be
used within a ‘linear’ framework). Moreover, a number of
approaches based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs;
Bansal et al., 2007; Nam et al., 2007) are ultimately reducible
to linear statistical models, as described in Oates et a]. (2012).

However, the biochemical processes underlying biological net-
works are often highly non-linear. When the data-generating
process is non-linear, use of linear models may produce inefﬁ-
cient or inconsistent estimation, attributing causal status to arti-
facts resulting from model misspecification (Heagerty and
Kurland, 2001; Lv and Liu, 2010). Indeed, such bias can prevent
recovery of the correct network even in favourable asymptotic
limits of large sample size and low noise (Oates and Mukherjee,
2012a). On the other hand, in many settings, non-linear dynam-
ical models of relevant biochemical processes are available. For
example, gene regulation may be modelled using Michaelis—
Menten functionals (Cantone et al., 2009), and metabolism
may be modelled using mass action chemical kinetics (Lee
et al., 2008). Here, we describe an approach by which kinetic
models can be used to inform network inference from
steady-state data. As we show below, such information can be
valuable in guiding exploration of network topologies.

Kinetic formulations have been widely studied in the systems
biology literature, and recently, there has been much interest in
statistical inference for such systems (e.g. Chen et al., 2009; Xu
et al., 2010). Our work is in a similar vein but focuses on network

inference per se and on the steady-state rather than time-course
setting. Although biochemical assays have become cheaper, it
remains the case that experimental designs must often negotiate
a trade off between more conditions (e.g. perturbations, biolo-
gical samples and technical replicates) and temporal resolution.
Methodologies, which can exploit knowledge concerning rele-
vant dynamical systems in the steady-state setting, are therefore
potentially valuable.

In brief, we proceed as follows. We consider a class of
non-linear biochemical dynamical systems that are relevant to
the biological process of interest (we focus on protein signalling,
discussed in detail later). Steady-state analysis leads to a class of
functional relationships between parent and child. These func-
tional relationships are used to formulate a statistical model for
network inference from steady-state data. In this way, network
inference is rooted in functional relationships derived from
non-linear kinetics. Importantly, we do not assume detailed
knowledge of the dynamical system, but only the broad class
to which dynamics and associated equilibria may belong.
Indeed, the approach we describe does not require any kinetic
parameters to be known a priori nor knowledge of the network
topology and is in that sense directly comparable with conven-
tional network inference methods. Its potential advantage stems
from then rich yet constrained nature of the class of functional
relationships that are considered. As recently discussed in Peters
et al. (2011), non-linear functional forms can aid in identiﬁcation
of underlying causal relationships.

We develop these ideas in the context of protein signalling
mediated by phosphorylation. Enzyme kinetics have been exten-
sively studied, and dynamical formulations are widely available
in the literature (see e. g. Leskovac, 2003). For some proteins and
pathways, regulation has been studied in considerable causal and
mechanistic detail. Indeed, there exist detailed computational
models for canonical protein signalling pathways, which have
been validated against experimental data (e.g. Schoeberl et al.,
2002; Xu et al., 2010). Further, proteomic technologies now
allow multivariate, data-driven study of phosphorylation, facil-
itating biological validation of network inference methodologies.
We take advantage of these factors to examine the performance
of our approach using both simulated and real data.

In the phosphorylation setting, Goldbeter—Koshland kinetics
(Goldbeter and Koshland, 1981) form the functional class that
underlies our network inference approach. Goldbeter—Koshland
kinetics are well known to be capable of highly non-linear be-
haviour including exquisite sensitivity. It has been experimentally
demonstrated that this so—called ultrasensitivity is biologically
relevant to signalling network dynamics, facilitating abrupt
and precise decision making (e.g Kim and Ferrell, 2007). We
carry out statistical inference in a Bayesian framework, using
reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) to
explore the joint model and parameter space. This yields pos-
terior probability scores for edges in the network that are
analogous to scores obtained in existing statistical network infer-
ence approaches for steady-state data (Ellis and Wong, 2008;
Mukherjee and Speed, 2008).

The remainder of this article is organized as follows. In
Section 2, our approach is laid out, followed by an exposition
of the associated computational statistics. In Section 3, we pre-
sent results on data simulated from a recently developed

dynamical model of the mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) signalling that has been validated against experimental
data (Xu et al., 2010). We then show results on real proteomic
data from breast cancer cell lines. Finally, Section 4 closes with a
discussion of practical implications and opportunities for net-
work inference based on functional models, along with asso-
ciated technical challenges.

2 METHODS

We begin in Section 2.1 by describing our approach in general
terms. Section 2.2 then introduces relevant concepts in the application
area of protein phosphorylation. In particular, we describe a class of
non-linear equations derived from Goldbeter—Koshland kinetics. Next,
in Section 2.3, this model class is embedded into a Bayesian statistical
framework for observations obtained at equilibrium. Inference over
model space is facilitated by reversible-jump MCMC, with Section 2.4
dedicated to a presentation of our sampling scheme and a discussion of
key implementational details.

2.1 General formulation

We consider a state vector X = (X 1, . . . , X 1,) containing concentrations of
1) proteins. Equilibrium analysis of phosphorylation dynamics, as
described below, leads to a system of p equations X i = f,(X, U,; 0,)
where i indexes proteins, U,- are external input variables and 0,- unknown
parameters. The component function f,- depends on a subset Jr,- of the state
variables, such that we may write X i = f,(X,,,, U,; 0,), where X”, indicates
selection of components of the vector X whose indices are members of the
set 71,-. Variables jet,- are the parents of node i in graph G; the parent sets
:1,- specify the (unknown) topology of interest since (j,i)eE(G)<=>jEJT,-. Our
inference scheme seeks to infer the 715s from steady-state data. Since the
dynamical system is not usually known in detail a priori, we consider the
practically applicable casein which the f,’s are known only to belong to a
certain class .7: (derived from Goldbeter—Koshland kinetics, as described
below) with parent sets 71,- and all parameters 0,- remaining unknown.

2.2 Protein phosphorylation

We consider proteins i e V: {1, ..., p}, each of which has an unpho-
sphorylated form  and a phosphorylated form X ,- (ie V). Phosphory-
lated proteins are referred to as phosphoproteins. The chemical reaction
that gives product X ,- from substrate  is known as phosphorylation and
is catalysed by kinases X E (E e 5,). We consider the case in which the
kinases themselves are phosphoproteins (if phosphorylation is not driven
by a kinase in V, we set 5,- = 0). The ability of a kinase E e 5, to catalyse
phosphorylation of X ,- may be tempered by inhibitors X1 (I 6 LE C V;
the double subscript indicates that inhibition is speciﬁc to both substrate
and kinase). Thus the parents at,- of X ,- comprise both the kinases and their
inhibitors: 71,- = 5,- U {1}, E} E65,. Because of speciﬁcity of phosphorylation
reactions, we assume that the underlying network G is sparse, such that
the number of parents 71,- for variate X ,- is low. An example is shown, using
a standard graphical representation, in Figure la. In what follows we use
XE), X i to denote the concentrations of proteins XE), X,- respectively;
U, =  + X,- is then the total concentration of protein i, which is
taken to be approximately invariant over the timescale of phosphoryl-
ation dynamics.

For network inference, model selection will take place over parent
sets 71,-. Accordingly, we require functional equations for any such
subset (Fig. lb). We use ODEs of the Michaelis—Menten type to provide
a suitable class of analytic approximations for phosphorylation dynamics
(Kholodenko, 2006; Steijaert et al., 2010). The rate of phosphorylation
X? —> X,- due to kinase X]- is given by VXJ-X?/(X? + K), which explicitly
acknowledges variation of kinase concentration X]- and permits

Equilibrium analysis of the foregoing kinetic model yields functional
relationships between nodes that we use to inform analysis of steady-state
data. The seminal example of Goldbeter and Koshland (1981) considered
phosphorylation by a single enzyme (X E) and dephosphorylation by a
single phosphatase (X p), which at equilibrium satisfy the balance
equation

whose solution X, = f,((X E, X p), X?; 0,) is capable of expressing a range
of biologically relevant non-linearities. In this work, we extend the class
of molecular regulatory mechanisms by entertaining multiple kinases
along with multiple kinase inhibitors. For simplicity, we assert that all
kinases act independently and that all kinase inhibition occurs competi-
tively. In particular we do not consider complex interactions between
these regulators, such as cooperativity. Competitive inhibition requires
that substrate (X?) and inhibitor (X1) compete for the same binding site
on the enzyme (X E):

XEX, : XE : XEX? —> XE + X, (2)

When multiple inhibitors (1, II) are present, they are assumed to act ex-
clusively, competing for the same binding site on the enzyme:

XEXI’ : XE : XEXI’ (3)

ponds to rescaling of the Michaelis—Menten parameter

where the sum runs over inhibitors I of the kinase E. (The interested
reader is referred to Leskovac (2003) for further details.) Phosphatase
speciﬁcity is currently poorly characterized compared with kinase speci-
ﬁcity, so our analysis does not attempt to cover this level of regulation. In
particular dephosphorylation is assumed to occur at a rate VOX, propor-
tional to the amount of phosphoprotein. Collecting together our model-
ling assumptions and solving the resulting balance equation produces a
functional model class .7-', with member functions f, e .7: given by

Here, the parameter vector 0, contains the maximum rates (V) and
Michaelis—Menten constants (K) speciﬁc to phosphorylation of species
i (dependence of V, K on i is notationally suppressed for clarity).

When 5, = 0 we instead deﬁne f, = 11,, equal to the average phosphopro-
tein concentration.

2.3 Statistical formulation

The Goldbeter—Koshland model (5) gives a general form for the func-
tional relationship between nodes at steady-state. Inference proceeds
based on a Bayesian formulation of this model (Fig. 1c). Consider inde-
pendent observations of protein expression obtained at equilibrium with
respect to phosphorylation dynamics. To ﬁx a characteristic scale, all data
are scale normalized prior to inference, such that each species has unit
mean. For a given protein i, a model M, for phosphorylation describes
putative kinases 5, and associated inhibitors I,,E (E e 5,) for protein
i (note that M, contains more information than the subset 71,, namely
the speciﬁc mechanistic roles played by each variable in 71,). Then, con-
ditional on M, and parameters 0, we have the following statistical model

108(1)?) = 1080909” Ui; 0i» + 8i (6)

where 8, ~ N(0, 01.2). Here, the error term 8, absorbs contributions from
observation error and model misspeciﬁcation, with the logarithm of both
predictor and response taken to improve the normality assumption.

In the Bayesian setting, prior probability distributions are required for
parameters 0, and models M,. For the parameters 0, = (V, K, a), which
we have augmented with o (as with the other parameters, we drop the
subscript i on o for clarity), physical considerations require that V], K], o
> 0. Following Xu et a]. (2010), we postulate that all biological processes
must occur on an observable timescale, motivating, in the shape, scale
parametrization, the gamma priors V~ I‘(2,1/2), K ~ I‘(2, 1/2), each of
unit mean and variance 1/2. The noise parameter a is inverse-gamma
distributed a priori as 0~I"1(6,l), with prior mean 1/5 and variance
1 / 100 chosen to correspond to the magnitude of measurement noise in
current proteomic technologies (Hennessey et al., 2010).

When expert opinion is available, rich subjective model priors may be
elicited (see e.g. for graphical models, Mukherjee and Speed, 2008), but
for this work we employed an objective prior, depending on a (possibly
empty) prior model . Prior speciﬁcation should account for the dis-
tinct roles of kinases and inhibitors; a mathematical formulation is
described in the Supplementary Information.

2.4 Reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo

Inference over networks was carried out using Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC). For linear and discrete models, marginal likelihoods
are typically available in closed form. Then, sampling needs only to ex-
plore the model space (see e.g. Ellis and Wong, 2008; Madigan et al.,
1995; Mukherjee and Speed, 2008). However, in the present, non-linear
setting parameters cannot be integrated out analytically, motivating the

need to sample over the joint space of models and parameters. Further-
more, the dimension of the model is not ﬁxed, as the number of param-
eters dim(0M) depends on the model M; dim(0M) = dim( VM)+
dim(KM) + 1 where the former quantities are functions of the numbers
of kinases and inhibitors according to M. We therefore employ
reversible-jump MCMC (RJMCMC) (Green, 1995) for inference. Fol-
lowing Green and Hastie (2009), we enumerate all possible models as
{ll/{(1‘)}keK and deﬁne the across-model state space

5 = U ({k} x 9,), k = X ({E} x 1,1,4“) (7)
keiC Eeé’mk)

where parameters 01W) for model 114(k) belong to Ok and X denotes the
Cartesian product. The reversible-jump sampler constructs an ergodic
Markov chain on S which has, as its stationary distribution, the posterior
probability distribution p(S|D), S e 8. In particular the marginal p(k|D)
over the model index k e [C corresponds exactly to the posterior model
probabilities p(M(k)|D). Construction of an efﬁcient RJMCMC sampler
requires an intuition for the across-model state space. We adopt a delib-
erately transparent Metropolis-within-Gibbs approach (Roberts and
Rosenthal, 2006), updating one coordinate of S at a time using a
Metropolis—Hastings accept/reject probability of the form
01(5, S!) = min(1, A(S, S/)p(D|S/)/p(DIS)). A number of distinct proposal
mechanisms were employed to ensure ergodicity and provide rapid
mixing. Precise details of the proposals used, along with their associated
ratios A(s, SI) may be found in the Supplementary Information. For ap-
plications, 30000 iterations of the Gibbs sampler were performed, with
5000 discarded as burn-in. Convergence was assessed using repeated runs
from dispersed initial conditions.

3 RESULTS

In this section, we empirically assess our methodology and com-
pare its performance against network inference based on the linear
model. In Section 3.1, we show results using a recently published
dynamical model of the MAPK signalling pathway due to Xu
et a]. (2010), where the underlying network is known exactly. In
Section 3.2, we apply our approach to a real proteomic dataset. In
both cases, for fair comparison between different methods, no
informative model priors were used (i.e. we set Vi,  = 0).

Averaged Receiver Operating Characteristic Curves

3.1 Simulation study

Data were generated from a computational model of the MAPK
signaling pathway due to Xu et al. (2010), speciﬁed by a system
of 25 non-linear ODEs (Fig. 2a). The simulation gives covariates
that are highly correlated at equilibrium, as would be expected in
practice, while providing a known network G for evaluation pur-
poses. Further details regarding the computational model are
described in the Supplementary Information. We introduced in-
dependent Gaussian measurement noise, additive on the log
scale, of magnitude 0 = 0.2, similar to error incurred by current
proteomic technologies (Hennessey et al., 2010).

We benchmarked our approach against the linear-additive-
Gaussian formulation log(X,) ~ N(1,00 + DMﬂM, 021) with
design matrix DM = [...log(X,)...]J-E,,M and intercept ,00; the
logarithm of a vector is taken component wise. All variables
were mean-variance standardized prior to inference. We consider
two standard approaches to inference for the linear model,
namely (i) the LASSO with penalty parameter set according to
cross validation (‘Lin. Lasso’) and (ii) a conjugate Bayesian for-
mulation [‘Lin. Bayes’; Hill (2012)], based on the g—prior
0,, ~ N(0, n02(D§WDM)_1), with a ﬂat prior over the intercept
p(,00)ocl and reference prior over the noise p(o)oC l/o. For the
Bayesian approach, we took a model prior p(M) to be uniform
over in-degree d = dim(ﬁM) with the restriction d g 3. Model
averaging was then used to obtain posterior inclusion probabil-
ities. For each of the linear approaches (i) and (ii) we also con-
sidered adjusted variants (‘Lin. Lasso Adj.’ and ‘Lin. Bayes
Adj.’) where log-phospho-ratios log(X,/U,) constitute the re-
sponse; this can be motivated as a simple ﬁrst order correction
for variation in total protein levels.

For each phosphorylated or active species i in the computa-
tional model, we sought to infer the parents 71,. For a fair com-
parison with the linear approaches, which do not ascribe
functional roles to variables, we did not distinguish between kin-
ases and inhibitors during assessment. The resulting receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curves are shown in Figure 2b.

Overall performance was quantiﬁed using area under the ROC
curve (AUR), aggregated over all ie V. Results are shown over 10
datasets D for each of various combinations of sample size n and
noise level a (Fig. 2c). In all regimes, our approach outperformed
linear approaches; the latter did not perform well even in this low
dimensional example. We note also that even in the least challen-
ging regime (n = 24, a = 0), none of the approaches were able to
perfectly recover the entire network G. The adjusted regressions,
which model the log-phospho-ratio as the response, did not out-
perform the standard linear regressions.

3.2 Cancer proteomic data

Data were obtained using reverse-phase protein arrays [RPPA;
Hennessey et al. (2010)] applied to a panel of breast cancer cell
lines (Neve et al., 2006). Data D comprised equilibrium observa-
tions for p=38 phosphorylated proteins, in addition to their
unphosphoryated counterparts (Fig. 3a). Cell lines belong to
two biologically distinct subtypes known as basal (77:22) and
luminal (n :21), with each member cell line comprising one
sample. The true data-generating network is not known for bio-
logical samples, but for certain nodes, the relevant kinase—
substrate relationships have been described in considerable
mechanistic detail in the literature. To minimize the risk of com-
paring results of inference against an incorrect literature model,
we focused attention on selected nodes in the data for each of
whom the key kinase is well established. For example, the protein
S6 is known to be phosphorylated via the kinase activity of p70
S6 Kinase (p70S6K); both proteins are included in our assay.
Treating S6 as the target (i.e. the network child), we scored
each of the remaining 37 proteins as a candidate regulator
(i.e. for inclusion in the parent set 7156) using each method.
Figure 3b displays the result of inference for the parents of S6
(S6 is phosphorylated on amino acid residues Serine 235236;
results for basal subtype shown and measurements of S6 phos-
phorylation on residues Serine 240 244 were excluded since this
correlates closely with phosphorylation on Serine 235236).
Despite the known well-established regulatory role for p70S6K,
it is striking that only our approach ranks p70S6K highly. The
LASSO approaches ascribe no weight to the correct kinase in
this case. To gain more insight into the assignment of weights by
the competing methodologies, we constructed scatter plots com-
paring weight distributions (Fig. 3c). It is immediately clear that
the weight assignments vary markedly between basal and luminal
subtypes. In addition, it is noticeable that there is little agreement
between the apparently similar linear formulations. We extended
this investigation to several other key signalling players whose
regulation is well understood (Table 1). Overall, we ﬁnd that the
proposed approach outperforms the linear methods.

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

In this work, we investigated integration of biochemical mech-
anisms into network inference for steady-state data. We focused
on protein phosphorylation, a key biochemical process where
the availability of relatively sophisticated simulation models,
extent of existing mechanistic insight and availability of relevant
proteomic data combine to facilitate assessment of network
inference approaches. Our results, on simulated and real data,

The proposed method was compared with linear approaches using reverse-phase
protein array data for nodes whose regulation has been extensively studied in the
literature. Each method ranked potential regulators among candidate proteins; here,
we display the rank assigned to the known kinase, using each of the ﬁve methods.
For example, Figure 3b shows such an analysis for the target node (i.e. network
child) S6, where G.K. Kinetics ranked the known kinase p7OS6K lst out of a total
of 36 candidates. High rank indicates that the known kinase is correctly highlighted
in the analysis; the highest-ranked result is highlighted in bold for each target node.
Here, we show the rank assigned to the known kinase for each of the target nodes
Akt, p7OS6k, S6 and p53. (‘NA’ indicates that the known kinase received zero
weight. Alternative phospho-forms of the target were excluded as candidates for
Akt and S6, so that there were 36 candidates rather than 37. Here, we present results
obtained using data from cell lines of basal subtype; luminal results are shown in
Supplementary Information.)

regulation in real data. In addition to superior performance, a
chemical formulation ascribes mechanistic roles to variables and
may increase interpretability. In complementary work, Oates and
Mukherjee (2012b) consider the use of nonlinear chemical kin-
etics for network inference using time-course data, reporting that
a chemical formulation outperformed a number of mechanism-
free approaches, including non-parametric models.

Estimation of dynamical parameters in the presence of struc-
tural uncertainty remains an open area and an important topic
for future work. Here, although we sampled both networks and
parameters jointly, we focused exclusively on network inference.
It remains unclear how to report kinetic parameter estimates in
the presence of structural uncertainty. One approach would be to
ﬁrst ﬁx a network and subsequently estimate the associated dy-
namics. However, this has the disadvantage of relying on a ‘point
estimate’ of the network and therefore being sensitive to network
misspeciﬁcation. This is especially relevant in the small sample
setting where typically no one model will capture substantial
posterior mass. Alternatively, one could estimate the total
effect of an interaction by averaging over all models. This relates
to ideas in causal inference for graphical models (Pearl, 2009) but
has the disadvantage that the resulting ‘total effect’ may lack a
natural chemical interpretation.

It is important to note that the chemical formulations con-
sidered here are not fully identiﬁable with respect to parameters.
Indeed, the maximal reaction rates VE are identiﬁable only up to
an unknown normalizing constant V0, whereas the Michaelis—
Menten parameters K E are known to be only weakly identiﬁable
(Calderhead and Girolami, 2011). Nevertheless, the model struc-
ture M itself remains identiﬁable in this setting (Supplementary
Information). Our empirical results on simulated and real data
provide examples where structural inference, using the formula-
tion we propose, is possible under realistic conditions. However,
factors including model mis-speciﬁcation and missing variables

(see e.g. Oates and Mukherjee, 2012a) may limit structural
identiﬁability in general. Indeed, we found that all approaches
performed poorly on luminal cell lines in our real proteomic
data example (Supplementary Information). Therefore, results
of structural inference should be interpreted with caution and
treated as hypotheses to be tested experimentally.

We did not consider an explicit observation model. Because of
the nonlinear nature of the Goldbeter—Koshland formulation,
formal uncertainty propagation would be highly nontrivial for
our model. Assuming log-normal observation error and neglect-
ing predictor uncertainty, we arrived at the statistical model in
Equation (6). In this sense, our formulation may be regarded as
an approximation to inference under an explicit log-normal ob-
servation model. An interesting avenue for further research
would be to make explicit the observation process.

Network inference is naturally facilitated by interventional
experiments; however, adequate modelling of the effects of inter-
vention is important to ameliorate statistical confounding (Eaton
and Murphy, 2007; Pearl, 2009). Within a chemical kinetic
framework, such factors may be naturally accounted for; for
instance, a ‘perfect’ intervention simply corresponds to removal
of the targeted species from the chemical model.

Network inference based on non-linear models is computa-
tionally challenging. We considered low-to-moderate dimen-
sional settings ([7: 12, 38), for which RJMCMC proved to be
effective. The computations in this article are parallelizable, and
it may therefore be possible to extend this work to
the high-dimensional setting. In general, non-linear approaches
are clearly more burdensome than their linear counterparts,
where highly efﬁcient approaches, including those based
on LASSO and related penalized likelihood schemes, allow
rapid estimation even in high dimensions. We therefore view
the methods presented here as complementary to variable selec-
tion based on linear models, allowing more reﬁned exploration in
settings where some insight into underlying dynamics is
available.

We investigated integration of biochemical mechanisms into
network inference. Although the Goldbeter—Koshland formulae
are invalid at the single-cell level, which is intrinsically stochastic,
our results suggest that these deterministic non-linear equations
represent a better approximation than the corresponding linear
equations. In particular a chemical kinetic formulation is able to
account, in a principled way, for variation in total protein levels
between samples. Consequently, inferred edges cannot be inter-
preted as indicators of direct biochemical interaction; rather an
edge corresponds to the prediction that intervention on the
parent will result in a change in expression of the child, possibly
indirectly via unobserved variables. In our real data example, we
therefore allowed for candidate species, which are not themselves
kinases, such as S6 and p53.

For simplicity, we did not consider post-translational modi-
ﬁcations such as ubiquitinylation, nor spatial effects such as
translocation, nor did we explicitly distinguish between phos-
phorylation on different residues. The methodology that we pre-
sented may be generalized to other molecular mechanisms. In
particular alternative mechanisms of enzyme interaction such
as non-competitive, uncompetitive, hyperbolic and parabolic in-
hibition could be readily integrated into our framework.

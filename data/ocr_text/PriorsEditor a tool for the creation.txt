ABSTRACT

Summary: Computational methods designed to discover
transcription factor binding sites in DNA sequences often have a
tendency to make a lot of false predictions. One way to improve
accuracy in motif discovery is to rely on positional priors to focus
the search to parts of a sequence that are considered more likely to
contain functional binding sites. We present here a program called
PriorsEditor that can be used to create such positional priors tracks
based on a combination of several features, including phylogenetic
conservation, nucleosome occupancy, histone modifications,
physical properties of the DNA helix and many more.

Availability: PriorsEditor is available as a web start application and
downloadable archive from http://tare.medisin.ntnu.no/priorseditor
(requires Java 1.6). The web site also provides tutorials, screenshots
and example protocol scripts.

1 INTRODUCTION

Computational discovery of transcription factor binding sites in
DNA sequences is a challenging problem that has attracted a lot
of research in the bioinformatics community. So far more than a
hundred methods have been proposed to target this problem (S andve
and Drablps, 2006) and the number of publications on the topic is
steadily increasing.

There are two general approaches for discovering potential
transcription factor binding sites with computational tools. One is
to examine regulatory regions associated with a group of genes that
are believed to be regulated by the same factors and search for
patterns that occur in all or most of these sequences. This approach,
often referred to as de novo motif discovery, can be used when we
have no prior expectations as to what the binding motifs might look
like. One concern with this approach, however, is that it might be
necessary to consider rather long sequence regions to ensure that the
target sites are indeed covered. Since binding motifs for transcription
factors are usually short and often allow for some degeneracy, the
resulting signal—to—noise ratio can be quite low, making it difﬁcult to
properly discriminate motifs from background. Another problematic
issue is that DNA sequences inherently contain a lot of repeating
patterns, such as tandem repeats and transposable elements, which

can draw focus away from the target binding motifs when searching
for similarities between sequences.

The other general motif discovery approach, called motif
scanning, searches for sequence matches to previously deﬁned
models of binding motifs, for instance in the form of position weight
matrices (PWMs; Stormo, 2000). The main drawback with motif
scanning is that it tends to result in an overwhelming number of false
positive predictions. According to the ‘futility theorem’ put forward
by Wasserman and Sandelin (2004), a genome—wide scan with a
typical PWM could incur in the order of 1000 false hits per functional
binding site, which would make such an approach practically
infeasible for accurate determination of binding sites. The problem
here lies not so much in the predicted binding patterns themselves,
since many of these would readily be bound by transcription factors
in vitro. In vivo, however, most such binding sites would be non—
functional, perhaps because the chromatin conformation around the
sites precludes access to the DNA (Segal et al., 2006) or because the
target factors require the cooperative binding of additional factors
nearby to properly exert their regulatory function (Ravasi et al.,
2010).

One way to improve accuracy in motif discovery is to try
to narrow down the sequence search space as much as possible
beforehand, for instance, by masking out portions of the sequences
that resemble known repeats or considering only sequence regions
that are conserved between related species (Duret and Bucher,
1997). Kolbe et al. (2004) introduced a measure they called
‘Regulatory Potential’ which combines phylogenetic conservation
with distinctive hexamer frequency proﬁles to identify possible
regulatory regions. This measure calculates a score for each position
along the sequence, and regions receiving higher scores are deemed
more likely to have a regulatory role. Regulatory Potential can
be considered as an example of a ‘positional prior’ since each
position is associated with an a priori probability of possessing
some speciﬁc property. Positional priors can be used as an aid
in motif discovery by assigning high prior values to regions that
we consider more likely to contain functional binding sites and
then focus the search on these regions. Besides conservation and
oligonucleotide frequencies, other features that can be relevant for
assigning prior values include: localized physical properties of the
DNA double helix, distance from transcription start site or other
binding sites, ChIP—chip and ChIP—seq data, and potentially tissue—
speciﬁc epigenetic factors such as the presence of nucleosomes
and associated histone modiﬁcations. Many of the aforementioned
features have previously been applied and shown to improve the
performance of motif discovery by themselves (see e.g. Bellora

Fig. 1. The top left panel in this screenshot shows examples of some of the features that can be used as a basis to create positional priors. These features are
visualized as data tracks in the main panel for a selected set of sequences. The bottom—most track contains predicted matches to TRANSFAC and JASPAR

motifs in regions with non—zero RegulatoryPotential7X scores.

et al., 2007; Segal et al., 2006; Whitington et al., 2009), and it
has also been demonstrated that further gain can be achieved by
integrating information about multiple features (see e. g. Ernst et al.,
2010; L'ahdesm'aki et al., 2008).

We present here a program called PriorsEditor, which allows users
to easily construct positional priors tracks by combining various
types of information and utilize these priors to potentially improve
the motif discovery process (Fig. l).

2 SOFTWARE DESCRIPTION

The ﬁrst step in constructing a priors track with PriorsEditor is to
specify the genomic coordinates for a set of sequences one wishes
to analyze. Next, data for various features can be imported to
annotate these genomic segments. PriorsEditor supports three types
of feature data. The ﬁrst type, numeric data, associates a numeric
value with each position in the sequence and can be used to represent
features such as phylogenetic conservation scores, DNA melting
temperatures and nucleosome—positioning preferences. Numeric
data tracks are also used to hold the ﬁnal positional priors. The
second feature type, region data, can be used to refer to continuous

stretches of the DNA sequence that share some unifying properties
which distinguish them from the surrounding sequence. Different
regions are allowed to overlap, and regions can also be assigned
values for various attributes, including type designations, score
values and strand orientations. Features best represented as regions
include genes, exons, repeat regions, CpG—islands and transcription
factor binding sites. The last feature type, DNA sequence data,
represents the DNA sequence itself in single—letter code. DNA
sequence data can be passed on to motif discovery programs for
further analysis, and it can also be used to estimate various physical
properties of the DNA double helix, such as GC content, bendability
and duplex—free energy. Additional feature data can be obtained from
web servers such as the UCSC Genome Browser (Rhead et al., 2010)
or be loaded from local ﬁles.

Once the data for the desired features have been loaded, the data
tracks can be manipulated, compared and combined to create a
priors track using a selection of available operations. These include
operations to extend regions by a number of bases upstream and/or
downstream, merge overlapping regions or regions within close
proximity, ﬁlter out regions, normalize data tracks, smooth numeric
data with sliding window functions, interpolate sparsely sampled

data, weight numeric data tracks by a constant value or position—
wise by another track, combine several numeric tracks into one
using either the sum or the minimum or maximum value of all
the tracks at each position and several more. It is also possible to
specify conditions for the operations so that they are only applied
to positions or regions that satisfy the condition. For example, to
design a priors track that will focus the search toward conserved
regions within close proximity of other binding sites, one could
start off with a phylogenetic conservation track, then load a track
containing previously veriﬁed binding sites from the ORegAnno
database (Grifﬁth et al., 2008), extend these sites by a number of
bases on either side and lower the prior values outside these extended
sites.

After a priors track has been constructed, there are several ways
to make use of this new data. The most straightforward way is to
provide it as input to a motif discovery program that supports such
additional information, for instance, PRIORITY (Narlikar et al.,
2006) or MEME version 4.2+ (Bailey et al., 2010). Unfortunately,
not many motif discovery programs are able to incorporate priors
directly, so an alternative is to mask sequence regions that have low
priors by replacing the original base letters with Xs or Ns since
most motif discovery tools will simply ignore positions containing
unknown bases when searching for motifs. Apart from being used
to narrow down the sequence search space, priors information can
also be applied to post—process results after motif discovery has been
carried out, for instance, by ﬁltering out predicted binding sites that
lie in areas with low priors or adjusting the prediction scores of these
sites based on the priors they overlap.

Positional priors tracks and masked sequences can be exported
for use with external tools, but it is also possible to perform motif
discovery from within PriorsEditor itself by using operations to
launch locally installed programs. To facilitate motif scanning,
PWM collections from TRANSFAC Public (Matys et al., 2006) and
JASPAR (Portales—Casamar et al., 2010) have been included, and
users can also import their own PWMs or deﬁne new collections
based on subsets of the available PWMs.

Constructing priors tracks and performing motif discovery
analyses can be tedious, especially when it involves many datasets
and requires several steps to complete. If a user discovers a good
combination of features to use for priors, it may be desirable
to repeat the same procedure to analyze other sequence sets as
well. PriorsEditor allows such repetitive tasks to be automatized
through the use of protocol scripts. Protocol scripts describe a list
of operations to be performed along with any speciﬁc parameter
settings that apply for these operations. They can be programmed
manually in a simple command language or be constructed using a
‘macro recording’ function which logs all operations the user carries
out while in recording mode. With protocol scripts these same series
of operations can be automatically applied to new sequence sets

simply by the click of a button. These scripts can also be set up so
that users can provide values for certain settings during the course
of an execution, enabling users to select for instance a different
background model or PWM threshold value to use in the new
analysis.

By providing a protocol script describing the operations to be
performed along with a ﬁle specifying the target sequences, it is
possible to run PriorsEditor from a command—line interface instead
of starting up the normal graphical interface. This allows the
construction and use of positional priors to be incorporated into
a batch—processing pipeline.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Empirical models for the prediction of how changes in
sequence alter protein—protein binding kinetics and thermodynamics
can garner insights into many aspects of molecular biology. However,
such models require empirical training data and proper validation
before they can be widely applied. Previous databases contained
few stabilizing mutations and no discussion of their inherent biases
or how this impacts model construction or validation.

Results: We present SKEMPI, a database of 3047 binding free energy
changes upon mutation assembled from the scientific literature, for
protein—protein heterodimeric complexes with experimentally deter-
mined structures. This represents over four times more data than pre-
viously collected. Changes in 713 association and dissociation rates
and 127 enthalpies and entropies were also recorded. The existence
of biases towards specific mutations, residues, interfaces, proteins
and protein families is discussed in the context of how the data can
be used to construct predictive models. Finally, a cross-validation
scheme is presented which is capable of estimating the efficacy of
derived models on future data in which these biases are not present.
Availability: The database is available online at http://life.bsc.es/pid/

1 INTRODUCTION

Ascertaining how the alteration of protein sequence inﬂuences
the thermodynamics and kinetics of binding is of fundamental
importance to many disparate areas of biomedical research.
Among others, its application is central to antibody engineering
(Kuroda et al., 2012), interaction design (Fleishman et al., 2011;
Kortemme and Baker, 2004; Mandell and Kortemme, 2009),
locating binding hotspots (Bogan and Thorn, 1998; Grosdidier
and Fernandez-Recio, 2008; Grosdidier and Fernandez-Recio,
2012; Guerois et al., 2002; Kortemme and Baker, 2002;
Moreira et al., 2007; Tuncbag et al., 2009; Xia et al., 2010),
determining the energetics of speciﬁc moiety contacts (for in-
stance, Anderson et al., 1990), uncovering binding mechanisms
ONeikl and von Deuster, 2009), characterizing transitions states
(for instance, Harel et al., 2007), determining the diversity of
affinities and specificities of extant proteins (Empie and

Laskowski, 1982) as well as ascertaining the functional conse-
quences of potentially pathological mutations (for instance,
Tischkowitz et al., 2008). Should it become possible to estimate
how single or multiple mutations inﬂuence the kinetics and
thermodynamics of protein binding on a much greater scale,
many further investigations would materialize. For instance,
determining the consequences of polymorphisms and mutations
from initiatives such as the 1000 genomes project (Altshuler
et al., 2010), the Cancer Genome Project (http://www.sanger
.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/) or the Cancer Genome Atlas (http://
cancergenome.nih.gov/) promises to yield significant insights
into the mechanisms of disease on a systemic level. Yet, the
amount of data being produced is staggering. Applied to genetic
data obtained in a clinical setting, such methods could find use in
personalized medicine. Used to characterize sequence-function
landscapes, these methods could test theoretical models regard-
ing the relationship between mutational robustness and evolva-
bility (Draghi et al., 2010). Applied to orthologs and paralogs,
this would indicate how affinities and specificities vary across
phylogenetic trees, giving insights in how organisms have
adapted to their niches at the interaction network level.
Furthermore, a more widespread application of de novo interface
design could be used to rewire interaction networks.

Incisive and large-scale experimental studies have illuminated
many aspects of protein binding (Ashkenazi et al., 1990; Bass
et al., 1991; Farady et al., 2007; Keeble et al., 2008; Kelley et al.,
1995; Lu et al., 1997, 2001; Reichmann et al., 2005, 2007;
Schreiber and Fersht, 1995), whereby the binding of mutants is
typically characterized using surface plasmon resonance, isother-
mal titration calorimetry or spectroscopic techniques. However,
these approaches are resource intensive, which prohibits their use
in the high-throughput characterization of sequence-function
landscapes in many systems. Recourse can be made in combina-
torial methods that circumvent the need for direct physical meas-
urement (Ernst et al., 2010; Fowler et al., 2010; Pal et al., 2005;
Weiss et al., 2000; Whitehead et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2011).
However, these methods can suffer from challenges arising
from library generation, display, selection and sequencing
(Araya and Fowler, 2011). Currently, it is unlikely that any of
these methods alone will be able to keep up with the abundance
of data generated by modern genomics initiatives. In light of this
and ever increasing computational resources, computational
models are an attractive option where structural data are avail-
able. Methods such as MM-PBSA and MM-GBSA can be used
to derive free energies from structural ensembles generated using
Monte Carlo sampling or molecular dynamics simulation.

Structural Kinetic and Energetic database of Mutant Protein Interactions

 

However, errors can arise from force ﬁeld approximations and
insufﬁcient conformational sampling, and the production of
trajectories can be costly (Hou et al., 2011). Promisingly, it is
possible to produce empirically parameterized functions for the
physical modelling or statistical inference of AAG (Benedix
et al., 2009; Guerois et al., 2002; Kamisetty et al., 2011; Tong
et al., 2004) or even AAH, AAS, Akon and Akoff. Such empirical
functions have the potential to be highly efﬁcient and, where the
role of conformational ﬂexibility is limited, highly accurate.
These methods are limited by the availability of training data;
with greater data, ﬁner inferences can be made and a broader
range of phenomena investigated (Fleishman and Baker, 2012).
However, special care must be taken to avoid subtle ways of
overﬁtting or deriving overly optimistic estimates of the general-
isation error.

In this article, we present SKEMPI: Structural database of
Kinetics and Energetics of Mutant Protein Interactions.
SKEMPI is a large, manually curated database of experimentally
measured changes in binding free energy, entropy, enthalpy and
rate constants, upon mutation. The data may be used to inves-
tigate the structural principles governing the inﬂuence of muta-
tions upon binding, for the evaluation of theoretical or
experimental techniques, as well as for the training of empirical
functions. As the kinetic and thermodynamic changes reported in
the literature are not systematic and reﬂect the interests of the
experimentalists who determine them, the data have speciﬁc
biases towards certain residues, types of mutation, spatial loca-
tions, binding sites, proteins and protein families. These biases
are reviewed and discussed in the context of how they can be
accounted for in the construction and evaluation of empirical
models. Speciﬁcally, a cross-validation framework is presented
within which empirically trained models of arbitrary complexity
can be evaluated, such that the resultant cross-validation error is
not lowered by these biases and can thus be used to give an
indication of how well the model is likely to perform when
applied to mutations that are not necessarily of the same type
as those overrepresented in the training set.

2 METHODS

The kinetic and thermodynamic data on mutational effects in protein—
protein interactions were collected directly from the literature. Some of
the data were found via the Alanine Scanning Energetics database
(ASEdb) (Thorn and Bogan, 2001) and PINT (Kumar and Gromiha,
2006) databases, as well as during the literature search for a previously
published binding free energy benchmark (Kastritis et al., 2011). Where
possible, Kd, AH, AS, AG, kon and koff values, which are not explicitly
reported, were generated via the relationships AG: AH — TAS,
AG: RT ln Kd and Kd Zkoff/kon = l/Ka. All dissociation constants, as-
sociation rates and dissociation rates were reported in units of M,
M_1s_1 and s_1, respectively. Enthalpies and entropies were either re-
ported as, or converted to, kcalmol‘1 and cal mol_1K_1. No mutations
involving insertions, deletions or residues containing post-translational
modiﬁcation were included, nor were mutations in which the afﬁnity of
the mutant was beyond the detection threshold of the experimental
method were used. Where numerical values were not explicitly included
in the relevant publication, values were obtained directly from the au-
thors, extracted from a ﬁgure or taken from the ASEdb. These cases are
noted in the database. The classiﬁcation of amino acid positions as sur-
face, interior, rim, core or support is as described in Levy (2010). Where

multiple structures were available, the highest resolution structures were
selected. Where structures of mutant forms were available, the reverse
mutation back to the wild type was also included in the database.

To determine which proteins are homologs, we used the GAP4 pro-
gram (Bonﬁeld et al., 1995). Proteins were deﬁned as homologs if they
have a similarity score of greater than 50 and at least 30% sequence
identity. Two proteins were deemed to bind to the same site on a
shared binding partner or homologous binding partners when at least
70% of the interface residues on the binding partner, for the interaction
with the fewest such residues, was shared by the second interaction.
Interface residues were deﬁned as those with a non-hydrogen atom
within 10A of a non-hydrogen atom on the binding partner.

3 RESULTS

In total, 3047 AAG measurements of 2792 unique mutations or
sets of mutations were found for 158 structures of 85 protein—
protein complexes. For comparison, the available databases
ASEdb (Thorn and Bogan, 2001) and PINT (Kumar and
Gromiha, 2006), respectively, contain 620 and 699 binding afﬁn-
ity data cross-referenced to dimer structures in the protein data-
bank, covering 26 and 32 systems, respectively. The AAG values
collected range from —l2.4 to 12.4 kcalmol_1. These extreme
values correspond to the conversion between the wild-type
Pl-Lys BPTI/trypsin complex, which has femtomolar afﬁnity,
and the micromolar Pl-Gly variant, both of which have crystal
structures available (Helland et al., 1999). Kinetic rate constants
were available for the wild-type and mutant forms of 713 muta-
tions, covering a range of Alog10(k0n) of —3.6 to 2.4 and
Alog10(k0ff) of —8.5 to 6.8, with kon and koff units of M_ls_1
and 3‘1, respectively. Furthermore, changes in entropies and
enthalpies were available for 127 mutations, with AAH ranging
from —7.5 to l7.6kcalmol_1 and AAS from —3l.5 to
33.2calmol_1K_1. In total, the database contains 2317 single
mutants, 364 double mutants, 103 triple mutants and 263
values corresponding to between 4 and 27 mutations, with
many examples of additive and non-additive effects. The data
come from many studies, including site-directed experiments,
systematic mutation scans, homolog scanning mutagenesis, cog-
nate/non-cognate pairs and interface engineering studies. The
majority of the data were measured using surface plasmon res-
onance, isothermal titration calorimetry and spectroscopic meth-
ods such as stopped-ﬂow ﬂuorescence. Some of the data were
reported as inhibition constants, and thus enzyme mutants that
reduce catalytic turnover could result in the overestimation of
binding strength, such as may be the case for the tissue factor/
FAB K165A/K166A mutant (Huang et al., 1998). This is, how-
ever, not common in the dataset. In agreement with a previous
work (Kastritis et al., 2011), the reported standard errors in Kd
for the wild-type and mutant afﬁnities are typically up to around
50%, corresponding to around 0.25 kcalmol_1, while binding
energies for interactions that appear more than once tend to
vary by around 0.5 kcalmol_1, with differences rarely exceeding
1.5 kcalmol_1. These ﬁgures, therefore, give a more accurate pic-
ture of the experimental uncertainties in the data.

Many different types of mutations are present, including mu-
tations that destroy intramolecular disulﬁde bridges, mutations
corresponding to structural changes (such as mutations to and
from proline) and mutations accompanied by the recruitment
and burial of ions to compensate for charges introduced at the

interface. Due to the large number of mutations derived from
alanine scanning experiments, around a third of the data corres-
pond to mutations to alanine. When these are removed, and
amino acids are classiﬁed as hydrophobic (A, V, I, L, M, F, Y
and W), polar (S, T, N and Q), positive (R, K and H), negative
(D and E) or other (C, G and P), 36% of the mutations are
within the same category, 13% are from hydrophobic amino
acids to polar or charged, 11% are from polar to hydrophobic
or charged, 5% correspond to a charge swap, 16% to a mutation
from a charged residue to a polar or hydrophobic and the re-
maining correspond to mutations to or from the ‘other’ category.

A summary of the database is shown in Table l. The complete
database is available at the website http://life.bsc.es/pid/muta—
tion_database/. The crystal structures were checked for unknown
and modiﬁed residues, most of which were away from the bind-
ing site (4CPA, 2BTF, 2FTL, lDAN, lSlQ) although a modiﬁed
residue does covalently attach the subunits of the ubiquitin/
UCH-L3 complex (lXD3). The complexes were also checked
for co-factors at the binding interface, by searching for chemical
species with at least one atom within 4A of both binding part-
ners. These included sulphate ions, mostly for the BTPI/trypsin
complexes (2FTL, 3BTQ, 3BTT, 3BTE, 3BTM, 3BTD, 3BTH,
3BT F, 3BTW, 3BT G, 2JEL), metal ions (lDVF, 203B, 4CPA,
lM8Q, 2JOT), sugars (lDAN, lNMB), GDP or heme groups
buried within one of the monomers (lGRN, 2B10, 2PCC)
or agents associated with the buffer or protein precipitation/
puriﬁcation (203B, lTMG, 3BN9, 2WPT, 3NPS). None of
these species was found intercalated between the subunits of
the complex.

4 DISCUSSION

One of the motivating forces behind assembling this dataset is
that a major obstacle to gaining a deep understanding of the
binding process and to efﬁciently engineering protein interfaces
is the lack of structural and afﬁnity data (Wodak, 2012). Such
afﬁnity data can be used to train appropriate AAG models,
ideally with some form of overﬁtting avoidance bias, complexity
commensurate to the number of training examples and account-
ing for the biases in the training set. A number of AAG functions
have been developed previously (Benedix et al., 2009; Guerois
et al., 2002; Kamisetty et al., 2011; Tong et al., 2004), although
with very few stabilizing mutations present in the data used for
parameterization. Furthermore, a large proportion of the data
have come from alanine scanning experiments. As such, models
have been trained to estimate the inﬂuence of clashes or the re-
moval of stabilising contacts. The most common goal of interface
engineering, however, is afﬁnity optimization. The data pre-
sented here include 303 mutations that stabilize the interaction
by at least 0.5 kcalmol_1, and up to 12.4 kcalmol_1. This is, in
part, due to a number of crystal structures that have been solved
for lower afﬁnity mutant complexes (notably BPTI/trypsin
(Helland et al.,l999; Pasternak et al., 2001), SGB/OMTKY3
(Bateman et al., 2000, 2001), Colicin E9/IM9 (Keeble et al.,
2008), barnase/barstar (Vaughan et al., 1999), hemagglutinin/
IgGl (Fleury et al., 1998), subtilisin BNP’/CI2 (Radisky et al.,
2005), Radisky et al., 2004), cytochrome C/peroxidase (Kang
and Crane, 2005), HEW lysozyme/antibody (Fields et al.,
1996), ,B-lactamase/BLIP (Reichmann et al., 2005), cyclophilin

A/HIV—l capsid (Howard et al., 2003) and Efb-C/C3d (Haspel
et al., 2008) which can be used to train the strengthening reverse
mutation back to the wild type. Other sources of strengthening
mutations include homolog scanning experiments (Kotzsch et al.,
2008; Li et al., 1997), mutations that were initially discovered via
phage display (Lang et al., 2000), mutations found via compu-
tational interface redesign (Reynolds et al., 2008; Selzer et al.,
2000; Kiel et al., 2004) and from systematic scans (Krowarsch
et al., 1999; Lu et al., 2001).

The AAG models that have been developed to date combine a
small number of weighted terms in linear combination, with few
adjustable parameters. However, binding involves many different
physical phenomena, and many of these have numerous different
models available, rendering the a priori selection of terms difﬁ-
cult. In principle, terms could be selected based upon their pre-
dictive value, either using a feature selection algorithm or by
manual trial and error. However, as related criteria are used to
evaluate ﬁnal models and the predictive value of terms or com-
binations of terms, both strategies run the risk of overestimating
the accuracy of the ﬁnal model, even if the number of selected
terms is restricted by Akaike or Bayesian information criteria.
Such concerns can be alleviated by reserving a subset of the data
speciﬁcally for model validation or by performing cross-
validation as an outer loop to the whole model construction
process. As a further precaution, the model should not then be
revised in light of the performance on the reserved data or the
outer cross-validation performance. As long as this is done, then
either of these strategies could be used not just for the evaluation
of linear models with feature selection (such as Moal and Bates,
2012) but also for more complex machine learning models (such
as Moal et al., 2011). Indeed, we suggest that it is best to use both
strategies. Final models can be evaluated on separate test sets not
included in the presented benchmark, such as the enrichment
ratios derived from indirect measurement of binding afﬁnities
(Ernst et al., 2010; Weiss et al., 2000) (with the hGH/hGpr
interaction removed from the training data when applicable).
Additionally, the cross-validation scheme outlined below can
be used.

There are a number of biases present in the benchmark, and
the way in which such data are used can bias models towards
speciﬁc residues, residue types, mutations, proteins, protein
families and interfaces. Furthermore, attempts to estimate the
generalization error using re—sampling (for instance, bootstrap-
ping or cross-validation) will have similar biases unless
accounted for. Table 1 shows an uneven distribution of muta-
tions in speciﬁc spatial locations in and away from the interface.
Non-interface residues are classiﬁed as either surface or interior,
and interface residues as rim (partially buried upon binding),
core (mostly exposed prior to binding and fully buried in com-
plex) and support (mostly buried prior to binding and fully
buried in complex) (Levy, 2010). While the number of interfacial
residues in the support, rim and core of interfaces is roughly
equal, the database contains twice as many mutations in the
rim as in the support region, and twice as many again in the
core. The data are also heavily biased towards alanine mutants,
which account for around a third of the whole dataset. In model
training, one could attempt to account for this using stratiﬁed
sampling or, better, weighting training mutations against the
more frequently occurring category. Another bias is towards

Reported for each system is the number of AAG values (#muts), the number of entries with kinetic rate constants (#kin), the number of entries with enthalpy and entropy
changes (#ther), the number of relevant PDB structures (#PDBs), the proportion of mutations at the interior (INT), surface (SUR), core (COR), support (SUP) and rim
(RIM), as well as the proportion of alanine mutations (Ala).

the speciﬁc residues or complexes in the dataset. Thus, instead of
using leave-one-out cross-validation, leave-residue—out or better
still leave-complex-out cross-validation should be used to esti-
mate the efﬁcacy of the model when applied to residues or pro-
teins other than those in the database. However, even doing this
neglects biases towards certain protein families or interfaces. This
can sometimes be desirable; the large number of antibody/anti-
gen complexes would be favourable for those looking to apply
models to antibody afﬁnity optimization. We may wish to esti-
mate the performance of a model speciﬁcally on this class of
mutations and leave-complex-out cross-validation would sufﬁce.
However, to avoid overestimating the general predictive power
of a model on any future unspeciﬁed protein complex, this must
be accounted for in the validation process, for instance by remov-
ing entire classes of complexes together when performing
cross-validation. However, in order to do this, one must carefully
specify how classes are deﬁned, as we have attempted to do
below. Care should be made not to aggregate complexes that
need not be put together, as this will reduce the number of
cases in the cross-validation training sets, and can lead to over-
estimation of the generalisation error.

When deﬁning classes to be simultaneously held out during
cross-validation, we wanted to hold out pairs of interactions
where at least one protein in each pair was using the same, or
a homologous, binding site. We did not wish to simultaneously
hold out interactions at sites distal to each other, such as the
factor VIIa/tissue factor site, where binding is antipodal to the
inhibitor binding site. Furthermore, we wanted to capture
common binding modes that may not be reﬂected by sequence
homology. In serine protease inhibitor interactions, which are
highly represented in the benchmark, inhibition is achieved by
a loop that adopts a canonical conformation. The convergent
evolution of this local loop structure in unrelated protein families
of different global structure and sequence prevents some com-
plexes involving this loop from being classiﬁed together using
structural or sequence alignment. However, the change in bind-
ing energy of mutations within this loop is often independent of
the inhibitor family, as shown by interscaffolding additivity
cycles (Krowarsch et al., 1999; Qasim et al., 1997). In light of
this, we propose a scheme based on the grouping together of
interactions based on cross-reactive and homologous binding
sites. Supplementary Figure S1 shows the homologies and

interactions between the proteins in the database. For all pairs of
proteins with a shared binding partner or homologous binding
partners, we checked whether the interactions took place at the
same binding site (see Section 2). Figure 1 shows pairs of proteins
that bind to the same binding site on a third protein (red), or that
bind to the same binding site on two homologous proteins (blue).
For more than half of the proteins, binding is to a unique site.
For many of the rest, the site is shared in one or two other
interactions (for instance, the binding site on the ,8—lactamase
inhibitory protein BLIP is shared by both TEM-l and SHV-l
,8—lactamase), and thus these interactions should be simultan-
eously held out during cross-validation. The remainder fall into
three groups. The ﬁrst is the protease inhibitors, including the
inhibitory antibodies E2 and S4, which share protease binding
sites. The second is the antigens, which bind to the same region
of their respective antibodies. The third group is the proteases,
which share a common binding site on the inhibitors. Thus, all
protease-inhibitor interactions should also be simultaneously
held out, as should all the antibody—antigen interactions. For
the membrane-type serine protease, the active site is shared by
both protease inhibitors and the S4 and E2 inhibitory antibodies.
Thus, interactions involving this protein should be either ignored

during evaluation or both classes of interaction should be held
out. The classes, as well as all the complexes which should be
omitted, are outlined in the SKEMPI database. This scheme
allows the evaluation of the generalization error with the min-
imal amount of grouping required to account for, to the authors’
knowledge, all biases arising from overrepresentation of speciﬁc
types of mutation in the SKEMPI database.

5 CONCLUSION

Presented here is SKEMPI, a large database of experimental
binding free energy changes upon mutation, alongside the ﬁrst
large collection of Akon, Akoff, AAH and AAS values. These
data will allow the evaluation of hypotheses regarding the rela-
tionship between sequence, structure and binding properties, as
well as the evaluation of techniques and the parameterization of
empirical functions, which can then be applied to large-scale
investigations. While previous benchmarks contained up to 699
structurally cross-referenced AAG values, and very few stabiliz-
ing mutations, SKEMPI contains 3047 entries including many
that are energetically favourable. Thus, this will allow the train-
ing of models that span the whole range of afﬁnities, from greatly

Fig. 1. The proteins which bind to share, or homologous, binding sites. Those connected in red share a binding site on the same protein, while those
connected in blue share a binding site on homologous proteins. For instance, the colicin E9 and E2 immunity protein both bind colicin E9 Dnase at the
same binding site, and are connected in red. The TGF-,B type-II receptor binds to TGF-,B3, whose binding site is homologous to the BMPR IA receptor
binding site on BMP2. Thus, the TGF-,B type-II receptor and the BMPR IA receptor are connected in blue. Pink nodes correspond to proteases, orange
nodes correspond to protease inhibitors, the green correspond to the antigens, and cyan to the remaining proteins. Proteins with no shared or

stabilizing to highly destabilizing. The applicability of empirical
energy functions to the investigation of mutations in proteins
outside of the training set depends upon two things. First, the
magnitude of energy difference between wild-type and mutant,
and second, the generalization error of the model. A model may,
for instance, be able to detect mutations that strongly enhance
binding, or destroy the interaction, while not being sufﬁciently
accurate to detect subtle changes in ligand speciﬁcity. However,
in order to accurately estimate the generalization error, the
model must be validated in such a way that accounts for the
biases in the training data; biases that reﬂect the interests of
the experimentalists who have measured the data. We have inves-
tigated these biases in the SKEMPI database, towards protein
families, proteins, binding sites, interfaces, positions within the
interface, speciﬁc residues and alanine mutations. Using these
data, we present a leave-complex-out cross-validation scheme
that has been adjusted so as to simultaneously hold out inter-
actions at the same, or homologous, binding sites. This scheme
prevents binding-site—speciﬁc information in the training sets
from leaking into the validation sets, allowing the estimation
of generalization error, and thus the magnitude of the energy
gaps amenable to large-scale investigation.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Although the 1000 Genomes haplotypes are the most
commonly used reference panel for imputation, medical sequencing
projects are generating large alternate sets of sequenced samples.
lmputation in African Americans using 3384 haplotypes from the
Exome Sequencing Project, compared with 2184 haplotypes from
1000 Genomes Project, increased effective sample size by
8.3—11.4% for coding variants with minor allele frequency <1%.
No loss of imputation quality was observed using a panel built from
phenotypic extremes. We recommend using haplotypes from Exome
Sequencing Project alone or concatenation of the two panels over

1 INTRODUCTION

Genotype imputation is a common practice for both genotyping
(De Bakker et al., 2008; Li et al., 2009; Marchini and Howie,
2010) and sequencing studies (F ridley et al., 2010; Li et al., 2011).
Increasingly large reference panels available in the public domain
[e.g. those from the 1000 Genomes Project (The 1000 Genomes
Project Consortium, 2010, 2012) and UKlOK project (Futema
et al., 2012)] together with improved statistical methods (Howie

lmputation of coding variants in African Americans

 

et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2013) have enhanced imputation quality,
especially for rare variants with minor allele frequency (MAF)
<5 %. These improvements have resulted in both discovery and
reﬁned mapping of association with complex traits (Auer et al.,
2012; Holm et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2012). However, few stu-
dies have examined the use of large study-speciﬁc reference
panels, particularly the use of exome sequencing-derived panels
in admixed populations. Here, we present a new resource for
imputation in African Americans, built from 1692 African
Americans sequenced by the Exome Sequencing Project (ESP)
(Tennessen et al., 2012). We assessed the use of the ESP data as
an imputation reference panel and compared the results with
those obtained using the 1000 Genomes Project Phasel
(lOOOG; version 3, March 2012 release) (The 1000 Genomes
Project Consortium, 2012) data. Additionally, we evaluated the
potential consequences of using a reference panel built from sam-
ples selected on the basis of phenotypic extremes or disease status
instead of a population-based random sample. Lastly, we com-
pared multiple approaches to combine the ESP and lOOOG
panels for the imputation of rare coding variants.

2 METHODS
2.1 Exome Sequencing Project

2.1.1 ESP and African American Participants The complete ESP
dataset (Fu et al., 2012) consists of whole exome data for 6823 individ-
uals. Samples were sequenced at the University of Washington
(SeattleGO) and the Broad Institute (BroadGO). Among the 6823 indi-
viduals, 1692 participants were African Americans with genome-wide
association data available for analysis. The 1692 African Americans
ESP samples include 845 from the Women’s Health Initiative OVHI)
study (The Women’s Health Initiative Study Group, 1998) as part of
the WHI Sequencing Project WVHISP), and a total of 847 including
Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC; Muntaner et al., 1998)
(N 2282), Jackson Heart Study (JHS; Taylor et al., 2005) (N 2366),
Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA; Bild et al., 2002)
(N: 146) and Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults
(CARDLA; Friedman et al., 1988) (N :53) as part of HeartGO. Most
WHISP and HeartGO participants were selected on the basis of primary
phenotypes for ESP, which included extremes of body mass index, blood
pressure, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), cholesterol, early onset myocar-
dial infarction (MI) cases and controls, ischemic stroke with either early
onset or positive family history. Approximately 15% of samples were
selected because of having non-missing data for a selected set of core
phenotypes, but were not ascertained based on trait values.

2.2 Exome Sequencing

Exome sequencing was performed at the University of Washington
(SeattleGO) and the Broad Institute (BroadGO). Initial quality control
(QC) on all samples involved sample quantiﬁcation (PicoGreen), con-
ﬁrmation of high-molecular weight DNA, ﬁngerprint genotyping and
sex determination. Samples were failed if total mass, concentration,
integrity of DNA or quality of preliminary genotyping data was too
low or sex typing was discordant. Following QC, 2ug of extracted
genomic DNA was subjected to shotgun library preparation and exome
capture as previously described (Tennessen et al., 2012).

2.2.1 Genotype Calling For read mapping and variant analysis, sam-
ples were aligned to a human reference (hg19) using Burrows—Wheeler
Aligner (Li and Durbin, 2009). Variant detection and genotyping were
performed on both exomes and ﬂanking 50 bp of intronic sequence.

Typical mean coverage of the target was 60—80x. Variant data for each
sample were formatted (variant call format) as ‘raw’ calls for all samples.
Filters considered the total read depth, the number of individuals with
coverage at the site, the fraction of variant reads in each heterozygote, the
ratio of forward and reverse strand reads carrying reference and variant
alleles and the average position of variant alleles along a read. Variant
calling was performed across all 6515 samples at the University of
Michigan (UMich). Only single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that
passed the UMich support vector machine quality ﬁlter were retained for
analysis. Details were previously described (Fu et al., 2012).

2.2.2 Reference Panel Construction A reference panel of 2163 indi-
viduals (including the 1692 African Americans used in this study and 471
European Americans) was constructed. All of the 2163 individuals have
both Genome-wide association study (GWAS; Affymetrix 6.0) genotypes
and whole exome sequencing data. When combining the two sources of
data, a total of 375 024 bi-allelic autosomal SNPs with minor allele count
24 (in the 2163 reference panel subjects) did not overlap with the 702 205
GWAS SNPs. There were 10130 SNPs that overlapped between ESP
and the 702205 GWAS markers. SNPs with concordance <95% were
removed (65 SNPs). For overlapping SNPs that passed this concordance
ﬁlter, GWAS genotype was retained for consistency with the target indi-
viduals. A total of 1077164 autosomal SNPs were included in the ref-
erence panel. These 1 077164 markers were phased across all 2163
samples using BEAGLE v3.3.1 (Browning and Yu, 2009).

2.2.3 ESP ‘Extreme’ and ‘Normal’ Panel Construction The 1692
ESP African Americans were selected based on the following phenotypic
traits: (i) LDL (N 2254: 131 with high LDL and 123 with low LDL),
(ii) blood pressure (N: 247: 132 with high blood pressure and 115 with
low blood pressure), (iii) body mass index (BMI, N: 609: 429 with high
BMI and 180 with normal to low BMI), (iv) early onset MI (EOMI,
N 2324: 39 EOMI cases and 285 EOMI controls), (v) stroke (N :40,
all cases) and (vi) random samples (N 2218). We constructed one ESP
‘Extreme’ panel and one ESP ‘Normal’ panel each with 853 individuals.
The ESP ‘Extreme’ panel included (i) 254 individuals with high/low LDL
(131 with high LDL and 123 with low LDL), (ii) 247 individuals with
high/low blood pressure (132 with high blood pressure and 115 with low
blood pressure), (iii) 40 stroke cases, (iv) 39 EOMI cases and (v) 273
individuals with high BMI. The ESP ‘Normal’ panel consists of 80%
individuals with ‘non—extreme’ phenotypes and 20% with extreme pheno-
types so as to better represent a population sample. Individuals with ‘non—
extreme’ phenotypes (N: 683) are from random sample, EOMI controls
and low BMI group. Individuals with extreme phenotypes (N: 170) are
from high (N: 85) and low LDL (N: 85) group.

2.2.4 The 1000 Genomes Project (IOOOG) The 1000 Genomes
Phasel data were downloaded from http://www.sph.umich.edu/csg/yli/
mach/download/ 1000G.2012—03-14.html. Details regarding the gener-
ation of the data can be found in the Phase 1 article (The 1000
Genomes Project Consortium, 2012).

2.3 Target African Americans

2.3.1 GWAS Data All of the 1661 target African Americans in this
study were genotyped using the Affymetrix 6.0 genotyping platform as
part of the WHI SNP Health Association Resource study. Before phasing
and imputation, we removed Affymetrix 6.0 SNPs with genotype call
rates <90%, or Hardy—Weinberg exact test Wigginton et al., 2005)
P<10_6 or MAF <1%. QC details were described previously (Auer
et al., 2012; Reiner et al., 2011).

2.3 .2 M etabochip data All of the 1661 target African Americans in
this study were also genotyped using the Metabochip Woight et al., 2012)
in an attempt to generalize genetic effects across racial groups by the

WHI Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology
(PAGE) study. Standard QC was performed, including removal of mar-
kers with genotype call rate <95% or Hardy—Weinberg P <10_6, as well
as exclusion of individuals who showed excess heterozygosity, were part
of an apparent ﬁrst-degree relative pair, or were ancestry outliers as
determined by Eigensoft @rice et al., 2006). Details can be found in
the PAGE Metabochip article (Buyske et al., 2012).

Genotypes at the Metabochip SNPs were not used for imputation but
rather used for assessment of imputation quality. In total 5035 markers,
which were on Metabochip, in 1000G and in ESP, but not on Affymetrix
6.0, were used for imputation quality assessment.

2.3.3 Overlap with ESP African Americans African Americans
present in ESP were not included as target. In other words, individuals
in the reference ESP and the target were mutually exclusive. In addition,
we removed any target with PLINK (Purcell et al., 2007) estimated iden-
tity-by-descent (IBD) 20.2 with any reference individual such that our
ﬁnal target set did not contain any apparent ﬁrst-degree relative with the
reference ESP.

2.3.4 lmputation using [M P U T E2 In the main text, unless otherwise
speciﬁed, we present results using minimac for imputation. Supplementary
Figure S5 and Supplementary Table S7 showed that our recommendation
of ESP alone or concatenation of ESP with 1000G (ESP_U_1000G) over
1000G still held when IMPUTE2 was used for imputation. We note that in
the main text, our recommendation against IMPUTE2’s two panel mode
(option 3: ESP + 1000G) was confounded by software/method choice:
ESP alone or ESP_U_1000G using minimac performed better than
IMPUTE2’s ESP + 1000G, but when using IMPUTE2 for all, ESP
alone or ESP_U_1000G performed similarly as ESP + 1000G.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Comparison of imputation quality between ESP-based
and 1000G-based imputation

We ﬁrst performed imputation, using either ESP or lOOOG as
reference, into 1661 African Americans in the WHI study (the
‘target’ sample) who were genotyped by both the Affymetrix 6.0
(Auer et al., 2012) and the Illumina Metabochip array (Buyske
et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2012). We used MaCH (Li et al., 2010), a
hidden Markov model that leverages linkage disequilibrium in-
formation among samples of unrelated individuals, to pre-phase
the 1661 WHI African Americans at the Affymetrix 6.0 markers.
The ESP reference panel was built from 1692 African Americans
with genotypes from both the Affymetrix 6.0 platform and whole
exome sequencing. These genotypes were merged and phased
using BEAGLE (Browning and Yu, 2009). lmputation into the
1661 target WHI African Americans was performed with mini-
mac (Howie et al., 2012) (similar results were obtained with
IMPUTE2; see Methods) using their Affymetrix 6.0 genotypes
only; genotypes from the Metabochip genotyping were saved for
evaluation. Following the literature (Browning and Yu, 2009; Li
et al., 2010), we used dosage r2 [squared Pearson correlation
between imputed dosages (ranging continuously from O to 2)
and experimental genotypes (coded as O, l or 2)], which directly
determines effective sample size for subsequent association
analysis (Pritchard and Przeworski, 2001), to gauge imputation
quality. We also use qu, the estimated dosage r2 generated
by minimac, as the post-imputation QC metric. We observed
8.3—11.4% increases in average dosage r2 for variants with
MAF < 1% using the ESP reference panel compared with the

lOOOG reference panel (paired Wilcoxon P< 1.3 x 10‘4 —
4.1 x 10‘16). Such increases were observed without applying
any post-imputation QC, that is, when every imputed variant
was retained. Similarly increased dosage r2 was observed across
a broad range of post-imputation QC stringency (removing
0—90% of variants; Fig. l and Supplementary Fig. S1 and
Supplementary Table S1). As imputation is routinely performed
in 10 000—100 000 individuals (Auer et al., 2012; Cho et al., 2012;
Dastani et al., 2012; Holm et al., 2011; Teslovich et al., 2010),
such an increase would correspond to increasing the sample size
for association testing by 1000—10 000 samples.

Because the ESP panel is larger and consists entirely of African
Americans, we conducted more comparisons by assessing the
performance of 10 random subsets from ESP of the same size
as lOOOG (both for the full lOOOG panel [Number of haplotypes
(H): 1092 x 2; reference panels termed ESP.1092 and
1000G.1092] and the most relevant panel [AF R+ EUR,
H = 625 x 2; reference panels termed ESP.625 and 1000G.625]).
The difference in effective sample size derived from the ESP and
lOOOG reference panels, although smaller, remains (Fig. 2 and
Supplementary Table S2). For example, when comparing
ESP.1092 with 1000G.1092 and retaining all imputed variants
in the analysis (no post-imputation QC), we observed an average
dosage r2 increase of 11.3, 4.6 and 6.1% for variants with MAF
<0.2%, 0.2—0.5% and O.5—l%, respectively. The corresponding
dosage r2 increases for a comparison of ESP.625 with 1000G.625
were 13.9%, 1.0 and 3.1%, respectively. The superior perform-
ance of ESP over lOOOG was likely driven by two primary
factors. First, genotypes for rare variants from ESP were derived
from high coverage sequencing, whereas those from lOOOG were
in part from low coverage sequencing (lOOOG data we used here
are the integrated panel constructed from low coverage whole
genome sequencing, deep exome sequencing and SNP array gen-
otyping). Second, ESP African Americans (~50% also from
WHI, detailed in Materials and Methods) were better matched
to the ‘target’ WHI African Americans for ancestry than were
the samples in the lOOOG panel, which were pooled from several
populations of European, African and African American ancestry.

As expected, better quality imputation using the ESP panel
produces a larger number of well-imputed rare coding variants
than using the lOOOG panel (qu >O.6 for MAF <0.5%; detailed
in Table 1). For example, the number of well-imputed variants
was 2.28, 2.83, and 1.54 times greater than that from lOOOG for
MAF <0.2, 0.2—0.5 and O.5—l%, respectively (Table 1). The
boost in imputation quality as well as in the number of well-
imputed markers is expected to enhance power for testing asso-
ciation with phenotypic traits. For example, out of the eight
novel blood trait associated variants reported in Auer et al.
(Auer et al., 2012), two are not in lOOOG but ESP only
(Supplementary Table S3).

3.2 Impact of imputation reference panel constructed from
subjects selected based on extreme phenotypes

Many subjects sequenced in ESP were selected on the basis of
phenotypic extremes or disease status (detailed in Materials and
Methods), an approach that has been shown to increase power
for association testing of the speciﬁc phenotype (Barnett et al.,
2013; Guey et al., 2011; Kryukov et al., 2009). To our know-
ledge, the consequences of such a design for developing an
imputation reference panel have not been previously evaluated.
To this end, we constructed two ESP-derived reference panels:
‘ESP.extreme’ and ‘ESP.normal’ each of size H2853 x 2. The
former included 254 African Americans from LDL cholesterol
extremes, 247 from blood pressure extremes, 4O stroke cases, 39
early onset MI (EOMI) cases and 273 with extremely high BMI.
The latter included 85 samples with high LDL, 85 with low LDL
and 683 from the ‘middle’ of the phenotype distributions. We
observed no loss of imputation quality using the ‘Extreme’ panel.
(Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table S4).

3.3 Alternative options to use or combine ESP and 1000G
reference panels

Although our results suggested that the ESP panel led to sub-
stantially improved imputation accuracy of rare coding variants

r2 (squared Pearson correlation between imputed dosages and experirnen—

compared with the lOOOG panel, the combination of the two
panels could potentially result in even better performance than
either one individually. We considered the following four op-
tions. The default option, Option 0, was to select a single panel
a priori based on reference panel size, marker density and ances-
try match. In this case, Option 0 would be the ESP reference
panel alone, as it contains more haplotypes (3384 over 2184 in
1000G), greater marker density in exons and a better ancestry
match with the target African Americans. Option 1 was to ﬁrst
impute using each panel separately, and then for each marker to
select the one with higher qu. Option 2 was to impute using a
concatenated panel of the two (ESP_U_1000G). Option 3 was to
impute using IMPUTE2, which allows two separate reference
panels (ESP + 1000G).

The best option among the four was the concatenation of
the two panels (Option 2) with ESP alone (Option 0), a close
second best. For example, the average dosage r2 increased by
1.8%, 2.3% and 1.5%, respectively, for markers with MAF
<0.2, 0.2—0.5 and O.5—l% using Option 2 over Option 0
(Supplementary Fig. S2 and Supplementary Table S5). We
observed no noticeable gains using Option 1 compared with

were removed based on elevated qu threshold (QC). The y-axis is the
mean dosage r2 (squared Pearson correlation between imputed dosages
and experimental genotypes)

Option 0 with differences in dosage r2 in the range of 0.02—1.5%
(Supplementary Fig. S3 and Supplementary Table S6). Therefore,
we would not recommend using Option 1, the qu—based selection,
because higher qu does not guarantee better imputation quality.
In fact a low quality reference panel could lead to poorly estimated
qu values. Finally, IMPUTE2’s ability to combine two reference
panels (Option 3), led to decreased imputation quality compared
with Option 0. For example, dosage r2 decreased by an average of
7.3, 4.3 and 3.9% for markers with MAF 0.2, 0.2—0.5 and 0.5—1%
(Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. S4 and Supplementary Table S7).
Although less accurate, the convenience provided by IMPUTE2’s
approach warrants closer consideration. Decreases in quality
could be due to software implementation because we used mini-
mac for options 0—2 and IMPUTE2 for option 3. But importantly,
our recommendation of concatenation of the two or ESP alone
over 1000G alone or post-imputation qu—based selection holds
when IMPUTE2 was used for all four options (see ‘Imputation
using IMPUTE2’ in Materials and Methods, Supplementary Fig.
S5 and Supplementary Table S8).

4 DISCUSSION

We note that ESP is heavily enriched for extremes from several
phenotypes rather than a single phenotype. Thus, it is unclear
whether these results generalize to a design where sequenced sub-
jects are selected based on extremes for a single phenotype. We
did not attempt to select one phenotype for evaluation, as doing
so would reduce our reference size to below 300, which we view
as of little value for the imputation of rare variants. We expect
such ‘Extreme’ panels to make little difference for imputation
overall and may affect imputation in the speciﬁc trait associated
regions when the causal variant(s) exert large effect(s).
Although we recommend the concatenation of ESP and
1000G, we observed only modest gains in imputation quality
by combining the two. Previous studies suggest that these
gains may depend in part on the ethnic make-up of the study
subjects (Browning and Yu, 2009) and whether 1000G data add

substantial haplotype diversity. These gains should be weighed
against the logistical challenges of combining data from multiple
sources to avoid batch effects (6. g. mismatched strands, incon-
sistent marker naming schemes or systematic differences in geno-
type calling, QC or phasing).

In summary, we found that the ESP African American refer-
ence panel outperformed the 1000G reference panel for the im-
putation of rare coding variants in African Americans, both in
terms of imputation quality, the number of imputable markers
and consequently power for trait association testing. The ﬁnding
was robust to adjustment of reference size and matching on eth-
nicity. We did not observe loss of imputation quality because of
the ESP design for enriched sequencing of subjects selected for
phenotypic extremes. Regarding the optimal way to combine
the two panels, our evaluations suggested that ESP alone or
concatenation of the ESP and 1000G reference panels was
superior to either post-imputation selection based on qu or
IMPUTE2’s implementation of two separate reference panels.
We focused here on imputation of coding variants from ESP.
However, we believe that the conclusions drawn here apply to
rare variants across the genome as recently reported by several
whole-genome sequencing-based studies (Fuchsberger et al.,
2012; Sanna, 2012) in individuals of European ancestry. These
studies and our present work strongly suggest that population
matched samples, even in diverse populations such as African
Americans, can clearly outperform 1000G imputation perform-
ance. Therefore, we recommend investigators routinely consider
sequencing for the design (Kang et al., 2013) and analysis of the
study samples.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Drug repositioning is the discovery of new indications for
compounds that have already been approved and used in a clinical
setting. Recently, some computational approaches have been sug-
gested to unveil new opportunities in a systematic fashion, by taking
into consideration gene expression signatures or chemical features for
instance. We present here a novel method based on knowledge inte-
gration using semantic technologies, to capture the functional role of
approved chemical compounds.

Results: In order to computationally generate repositioning hypotheses,
we used the Web Ontology Language to formally define the semantics of
over 20000 terms with axioms to correctly denote various modes of
action (MoA). Based on an integration of public data, we have automat-
ically assigned over a thousand of approved drugs into these MoA cate-
gories. The resulting new resource is called the Functional Therapeutic
Chemical Classification System and was further evaluated against the
content of the traditional Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification
System. We illustrate how the new classification can be used to generate
drug repurposing hypotheses, using Alzheimers disease as a use-case.

1 MOTIVATION

Drug repurposing is the use of known active compounds for new
therapeutic indications (Sanseau and Koehler, 2011). When ad-
ministered in a living organism, a compound can indeed play
various roles and affect different biological processes [called
mode of action (MoA)]; accurately identifying these different
functions helps to predict the potential side-effects a drug
could have and can also lead to interesting repurposing oppor-
tunities (Medina-Franco et al., 2008). For instance, ‘sildenaﬁl’
was initially developed to relieve angina pectoris symptoms and
has been repurposed towards erectile dysfunction during the clin-
ical trials (Ashburn and Thor, 2004) when a new function of the
target enzyme was discovered. Approved compounds are attract-
ive because they have been extensively studied and have by def-
inition already successfully passed clinical trials, where most
drugs fail because of safety or efﬁcacy issues. There is increasing
number of approaches to predict repurposing opportunities

using computational methods [see Dudley et a]. (2011) or
Andronis et a]. (2011) for recent reviews]. Most methods operate
on the proﬁles of physicochemical descriptors derived from mo-
lecular structures (Haupt and Schroeder, 2011). Other methods
characterize the drugs on more abstract levels, such as the gene
expression signature (Iorio et al., 2010) or via the reported side-
effects (Campillos et al., 2008). These approaches have in
common to look for similarities within existing drugs and for-
ward similar compounds as repurposing hypotheses.

A feature of particular interest to describe drugs is the MoA.
According to Wikipedia, the MoA describes ‘a functional or
anatomical change, at the cellular level, resulting from the expos-
ure of a living organism to a substance’. For instance terms such
as ‘transcriptional regulation agent’ or ‘anticoagulant’ deﬁne
MoAs and characterize the roles of a certain type of drugs.
The MoA abstracts over the relations between molecular func-
tions, protein targets and drug activities; it is the central concept
linking a chemical structure to a set of biological activities.
Intuitively, the indication of a drug logically depends on its
MoA. Despite its widespread use in drug discovery, the MoA
has not been used yet as a descriptor for repurposing analyses.
One reason for this might be the challenge of formally deﬁning
MoAs. Indeed, MoAs are terms or categories, it is not possible to
represent them straightforwardly with values and numbers like
one can do for a 3D molecular structure or for a gene-expression
proﬁle. Nonetheless, the meaning of a concept can be formalized
with controlled vocabularies and ontologies (Gruber, 1995); ori-
ginating from description logics, such frameworks help to for-
malize the semantics of symbols and strings of characters with
explicit axioms. In an ontology or knowledge base, ‘concepts’
(interchangeable with ‘category’, ‘term’ and ‘class’ in this article)
are organized and linked following the logical type of relation
they have among them. In the Gene Ontology (GO), for example
(Ashburner et al., 2000), biological processes and molecular func-
tions terms are manually curated and their meaning speciﬁed by
the relation types linking two GO terms. MoA deﬁnitions are
present in other classiﬁcations such as the Medical Subject
Headings (Nelson et al., 2004) or the Chemical Entities of
Biological Interest (Hastings et al., 2013) for example. The
Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classiﬁcation System (ATC)
ONHO, 2000) also describes to some extent the action of drugs at
the anatomical level. All these resources are valuable for the
community as a source of carefully and manually curated infor-
mation. Moreover, the categories described in these classiﬁcation
systems are sometimes used to annotate drugs. For instance, the
compound ‘sildenaﬁl’ has been manually annotated as ‘vasodila-
tor agent’ (CHEBIz35620 or MeSH:D27.505.954.411.918). The

The functional therapeutic chemical classification system

 

classiﬁcations mentioned previously are not specially designed
for drug repurposing; they purposefully report only the well-
known and major MoAs of chemical compounds. The pharma-
cological spectrum of each drug is not necessarily well covered,
yet it would be the best way to predict new indications.

In our context, an ideal knowledge base would feature the
known MoAs of a drug as well as some predicted ones to be
tested in experiments. The MoA categories should derive and
scale over primary molecular evidences exposed in biomedical
databases, in an automated way. To address the lack of system-
atic MoA annotations, we have implemented the Functional
Therapeutic Chemical Classiﬁcation System (FTC), presented
here in this article. The FTC is automatically built by leveraging
the content of various biomedical databases using description
logics and automated reasoning. Over 20 000 new MoA cate-
gories are deﬁned in the resource and further populated with
approved drugs using the Web Ontology Language (OWL) in
combination with a reasoner. The population step takes in ac-
count the type of pharmacological action, the molecular targets
of the drugs and their involvement into biological processes.
Drugs can exhibit several MoAs, and the same MoA can be
reached through different mechanisms. Most of the drugs are
present in multiple FTC categories, reﬂecting the various roles
a compound can play inside a biological system which can serve
as starting point for repurposing. The resource was evaluated
against the ATC, traditional classiﬁcation scheme introduced
before. We present as well some preliminary analyses over the
data, by looking at the relation between the MoA and the indi-
cation of a compound using semantic similarity. Finally, we
illustrate also how the FTC can be used as a pharmacological
toolbox to analyze drug repurposing for Alzheimers disease.

2 RESULTS

The knowledge base behind the FTC is built by integrating infor-
mation coming from various sources. The G0 terms serve as tem-
plate to create the FTC categories describing the MoAs; DrugBank
(Knox et al., 2011) provides the known links between drugs and
their protein targets and Uniprot (The Uniprot Consortium, 2013)
maps targets to their respective GO annotations (Dimmer et al.,
2012). Drugs are further assigned into MoA categories according to
the OWL constructs and axioms deﬁned in the FTC. A reasoner, a
program capable of understanding such axioms, performed this
task (see Section 5 for details). The process to build the FTC is
summarized in Figure l alongside an example. The core step is the
generation of axiomatic representations of MoAs by decomposing
GO types into positive and negative regulations of biomolecular
functions and processes. With the help of reasoning techniques, we
can further derive and assign MoA across the knowledge base to
given drugs. It requires a few seconds (four processing cores, 4-GB
RAM) to classify the knowledge base [ELK reasoner, (Kazakov
et al., 2011)]. Other OWL reasoners (e.g. Hermit, Pellet, etc.) dis-
qualiﬁed mainly due to long processing time (data not shown).
The FTC forms a taxonomic structure as illustrated on
Figure 2, which arises when the reasoner classiﬁes the knowledge
base. In general, categories may have multiple parents and mul-
tiple children (see https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/ftc for inter-
active use). In total there are 1280 FDA-approved DrugBank
compounds (chemical and biotherapeutics) associated with

1264 human protein targets, where each drug is acting on at
least one human protein target. The FTC introduces 23 353
new categories describing the mode and mechanism of action
of therapeutic compounds. Of these categories, 4289 belong to
the biological processes in GO and 19 064 to the molecular func-
tions. A summary of the metrics behind the latest build is avail-
able online at https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/ftc/evaluation/. Out
of all FTC categories, 1432 categories (>6%) directly contain at
least one approved drug. This number increases up to 2532
(>ll%) when direct and indirect drugs are considered. FTC
categories not containing drugs (e.g. FTC_A0001771 - Anti-im-
munological synapse formation agent) represent MoAs for which
no approved compounds has qualiﬁed yet or that have not been
identiﬁed as such in the FTC.

2.1 Evaluation

The content of the FTC has been evaluated against the drug
categorization of the ATC, which has been produced by
manual curation and serves as a gold standard. A priori, both
resources serve different purposes and as a consequence, the
evaluation has to take this into consideration (Section 3.2).
The full methodology behind the evaluation is described in the
Section 6 of the Supplementary Material.

Brieﬂy, for 68 categories from the FTC, we can manually
identify a set of semantically equivalent categories in the ATC.
We call these equivalent categories the ‘evaluation points’ (see
Supplementary Material Section 6.1 for details). All drugs from
each evaluation point were then assessed to determine the quality
of the FTC against our gold standard, i.e. the ATC. For ex-
ample, the FTC category ‘Anti-hydrogen:potassium—exchanging
ATPase activity agent’ (FTC_A0008900) has been manually
asserted as equivalent to the ATC category ‘proton pump inhibi-
tors’ (A02BC). A summary of this evaluation point is further-
more available online at https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chemb1/ftc/
evaluation/FTC_A0008900.

For 1280 DrugBank compounds in the FTC, 1134 are also
present in the ATC, therefore only those were considered. The
‘evaluation points’ cover a total of 471 DrugBank compounds
or around 41% of common drugs to both classiﬁcations. Out of
these, 275 compounds are true positives, i.e. they match both, the
FTC and ATC categories for a given evaluation point. The
‘proton pump inhibitor’ evaluation point is such a case where
all the drugs (omeprazole, esomeprazole, pantoprazole, lansopra—
zole, rabeprazole) are present both in the FTC category and in the
corresponding ATC category. The total number of compounds
from an ATC category but where we could not identify a corres-
ponding FTC category is 35 (false negatives). Finally, 280 com-
pounds are present in a FTC class but not in any corresponding
ATC category (false positives). Overall we derive a recall of 89%;
this percentage indicates that the automatic build of the FTC
covers a good portion of the content already present in the
ATC. The precision of 50% shows that the FTC contains for a
given MoA many more drugs than the equivalent ATC categories.
This result was expected and comes from the original idea behind
the FTC: Representing in a systematic fashion the implicit and
explicit MoAs of drugs, in particular the ones not already indexed
by current classiﬁcation scheme.

Fig. 1. The diagram gives an overview of the integrated resources. (A) The name of FTC categories representing MoAs are directly derived from the GO
terms representing the molecular functions and biological processes. A preﬁx ‘anti’ or ‘pro’ is appended to the original GO term, as well as the word
‘agent’ as sufﬁx (e. g. the GO term ‘blood coagulation’ serves as a template to create the ‘anti-blood coagulation agent’ and ‘Pro-blood coagulation agent’
categories). (B) Each of the new FTC class has a logical equivalent deﬁnition assigned to it (axiom), representing the necessary and sufﬁcient conditions
for a drug to be classiﬁed in the corresponding MoA class. (C) The content of various databases is incorporated and linked using the FTC speciﬁc logical
properties. (D) Finally a reasoner classiﬁes the knowledge base and assigns drugs to MoA classes based on whether or not a deﬁnition can be satisﬁed.
For example, the drug ‘ximelagatran’ will be assigned as member of the category ‘anti—blood coagulation agent’ because of the logical links ‘ximelagatran
negatively-perturbs prothrombin’ and ‘prothrombin involved-in positive regulation of blood coagulation’. The taxonomic structure of the FTC appears

also in the reasoning step, from the entailment of the equivalent deﬁnitions

2.2 Exploration

The FTC was designed to assist drug repositioning analyses by
explicitly representing the polypharmacology of approved drugs.

In this section, we exemplify how the resource can be used to
perform different types of analysis.

2.2.1 Polypharmacology spectrum The more information on a
drugs molecular targets and their physiological roles, the more
opportunities exist to re—orient a drug into doing something new.
The therapeutic agents described in the FTC can have several
MoAs, i.e. may be acting on different biomolecular functions or
processes, which demonstrates the intrinsic polypharmacology of
the approved compounds. Figure 3 illustrates the polypharma—
cology spectrum by showing the distribution of number of MoAs
per compound. When only direct categories are considered, com-
pounds belong on average to 13.5 MoA categories. This number
increases to 61.2 when parent categories are taken into consid-
eration (super classes). Not all the MoAs are relevant to a dis-
ease, some FTC categories are particularly abstract (e.g. ‘Anti-
biological process agent’) yet they represent discrete categories to
which the drug belongs with an explicit and clear meaning. These
discrete MoAs are a good starting point to understand what a
compound can do when administered in a human system.
Compound’s polypharmacology is well represented in the FTC,
as shown by the numerous MoAs each approved drug can
exhibit.

We decided to further look at a well-known repositioning ex-
ample, in order to see whether the FTC was suitable to identify
the new uses of an old drug. We picked the ‘thalidomide’ for this
exercise (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/ftc/agent/DB01041). The
molecule was ﬁrst indicated to treat morning sickness in preg-
nant women, but has been quickly abandoned after its develop-
mental toxicity has been discovered in newborns. The accepted
molecular mechanism behind the side effect is an impairment of
the angiogenic process responsible for the development of mem-
bers, affecting in particular the limbs (Therapontos et al., 2009).
We found that the ‘thalidomide’ was accurately classiﬁed as

Fig. 3. Distribution of the direct (blue) and indirect (red) number of MoAs per drug. Means are indicated with a solid line. On average each compound
has 13.5 MoAs when only direct classes are considered. The number rises to 61.2 when indirect MoAs are included. Indirect MoAs are the ancestor
classes in the taxonomy as shown in Figure 2. The distribution range is wider when indirect MoAs are considered (range = 299; min = 7; max: 306)
versus direct MoAs only (range = 79; min = 3; max = 82). These results emphasize the fact that some drugs are well characterized in databases and could
be used for a variety of speciﬁc biological tasks. Finally, some compounds have been assigned to a small number of FTC categories; in such cases little is
known or reported about their pharmacology and repurposing opportunities might be limited

‘anti-cell migration involved in sprouting angiogenesis agent’ in
the FTC, capturing the known toxicity of the drug. Furthermore,
the ‘thalidomide’ is currently investigated for a multitude of new
usages, in particular for anti-cancer and immunomodulatory
activities among others (Teo et al., 2005). These new indications
are well represented in the FTC too, for example by the cate-
gories ‘anti-vascular endothelial growth factor production agent’
or ‘anti-cell division agent’ for antineoplastic activities, or by the
classes ‘anti-cytokine secretion agent’ and ‘anti-I-kappaB kinase/
NF-kappaB cascade agent’ for its effect on the immune system.
These observations demonstrate that the FTC can successfully
capture the molecular reasons behind the repositioning of an old
compound. Moreover, the classiﬁcation can also provide valu-
able insight regarding potential toxicity too.

2.2.2 Drugs with similar MoAs have similar indications The list
of MoAs attributed to a drug can be exploited as a descriptor for
the therapeutic agent: the tree structure of the FTC can be used
to derive some similarity metrics over the MoAs. The underlying
heuristic is to assume that the closer two entities are in the tax-
onomy, the more similar they are. We used a straightforward
approach derived from the J accard index (see Supplementary
Material Section 7) in order to compare approved drugs based
on the similarity of their MoAs. For instance, the similarity

between two compounds present in the same FTC category is
1 (maximum). The similarity between an ‘anti-blood coagulant’
and ‘pro-blood coagulant’ is 0.29, reﬂecting the fact that such
compounds are dissimilar with regards to the outcome of their
biological effect. As the MoA is intuitively expected to be the
central concept leading to the indication of the drug, we expected
that on average, drugs with similar MoAs would be indicated
towards similar therapeutic areas.

The heat map presented in Figure 4 shows a pair-wise com-
parison of all the drugs of the FTC based on their relative MoA
similarity. The compounds are further grouped by therapeutic
indications as deﬁned by the ATC. The heat map reveals some
square patches around the central diagonal; the overall similarity
appears higher when compounds from the same ATC group are
considered. A signiﬁcance analysis (see Supplementart Material
Section 8) revealed that the average MoA similarity of com-
pounds belonging to the same ATC category is signiﬁcantly
higher than when compounds belonging to different categories
are compared. Indeed, for each category, the P—value was inferior
to 0.05 based on 20 000 random permutations over the similarity
values. This result supports the idea that drugs with similar
MoAs have similar indications. Note that the mean of the simi-
larity values was considered for the statistical analysis; some out-
liers are also present in the map, which can be interpreted as

considered. The reader can refer to Supplementary Figure SlA for a two ATC level granularity. The similarity descriptor ranges from 0 (not similar—
white) to 1 (identical—black). Some compounds belong to multiple ATC categories (‘multiple’) and some others do not have an ATC code

to all other indications

repositioning hypotheses. These outliers have indeed similar
MoAs, yet they belong to totally different therapeutic areas
and are used for different purposes according to the ATC. We
are currently further analyzing such cases in a systematic fashion.
Hypotheses have to be manually examined and interpreted, as
ATC categories are only covering some of the legal usage of the
drugs. We expect to ﬁnd off-label indications in the predictions
for instance, as well as false positives.

Supplementary Figure S3 present similar association behavior
when two levels of the ATC are considered (no statistical signiﬁ-
cance performed). Supplementary Figure S4 re—uses the same
data as Figure 4 (one ATC level) but with a clustering function
apply to it (hierarchical clustering-manhattan distance) in order
to reveal functional clusters of drugs. Finally, Supplementary
Figure S5 shows the distribution when compounds are sorted
based on their identiﬁers; no patterns are identiﬁable in this
case. Taken together, these results emphasize that the MoAs as
deﬁned in the FTC are indeed on average associated with the
therapeutic indication of a drug. This result supports the validity
of the resource and its potential to computationally address in-
dication discovery.

2.3 Drug repurposing hypotheses for Alzheimer’s disease

In this section, we provide examples how actual drug-repurpos-
ing hypotheses can be derived from the FTC. The approach
presented here makes use of the FTC categories as analogs to
compartments of a toolbox helping to ﬁnd drugs to treat
Alzheimer’s disease. Five FTC categories containing drugs are
directly related to the biological processes of the neurodegenera—
tive condition: ‘anti-amyloid precursor protein-biosynthetic-pro-
cess agent’ (FTC_A0042983), ‘anti-Tau protein kinase—activity
agent’ (FTC_A0050321), ‘anti-Tau protein binding agent’
(FTC_A0048156), ‘anti-beta amyloid binding agent’
(FTC_A0001540) and ﬁnally ‘pro-beta amyloid binding agent’
(FTC_P0001540). We have then considered the drugs present
inside each of these classes as potential candidates. Figure 5
shows these drugs, which have been further manually grouped
based on the overall similarity of their actions (numbers on
Figure 5). The subgroups l, 2 and 3 are inhibitors of the cholin-
ergic system and some of them, such as ‘galantamine’
(DB00674), are already investigated to treat Alzheimer’s disease
and other related dementias. This class of agent is in line with the
cholinergic hypothesis (Francis et al., 1999), stating that

Fig. 5. FTC categories describe some of the modes of action that could
impact Alzheimer’s disease (letters on ﬁgure). The categories have been
manually picked on the basis that they could directly affect the dementia.
Drugs classiﬁed in these FTC categories further manually grouped based
on their MoAs similarities (numbers on ﬁgure)

Alzheimer’s disease could be caused by dysfunctions in the pro-
cessing of the acetylcholine. The subgroup 4 is exclusively com-
posed of barbiturates (central nervous system depressants). The
presence of this pharmacological class of compounds as an
Alzheimer’s disease treatment is more surprising, as very little
literature reports on it. Further investigations reveal that the
neuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha-7, a common
off-target of barbiturates, binds beta-amyloids with high afﬁnity
(\Nang et al., 2000). As beta-amyloids are themselves strongly
involved in the pathology, barbiturates could affect the state of
the condition, similarly to cholinergic inhibitors (\Nang et al.,
2000). The group B contains four compounds; ‘nicotine’ and
‘varenicline’ have been further grouped together because of simi-
lar pharmacology (group 5). ‘Nicotine’ has been shown to im-
prove some of the symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease (Jones et al.,
1992), it is therefore expected to ﬁnd this molecule in the predic-
tions. ‘Varenicline’ possesses a pharmacology related to that of
‘nicotine’, which would explain the presence of the drug in this
category. The two remaining drugs of group F are, respectively,
‘pralidoxime’ and ‘dipivefrin’; little information is available re-
garding their potential action against the condition, yet these
compounds seem linked to the cholinergic hypothesis and
could be considered for experimental testing. The groups C
and D contain, respectively, one molecule each. These com-
pounds have been classiﬁed as agents perturbing some of the
physiological function of the Tau protein, key actor in
Alzheimer’s disease (Grundke—Iqbal et al., 1986). ‘Vorinostat’
(group C) is currently indicated for the treatment of cutaneous
manifestations in patients with T-cell lymphoma, yet a study has
shown in vivo (mouse model) the potential of the drug and other
histone deacetylase inhibitors in regards to memory deﬁcit
(Kilgore et al., 2010). The presence of the ‘lithium’ (group D)
was conﬁrmed by a recent study demonstrating a long-term

protective effect for the ion in regards to Alzheimer’s disease
(Young, 2011). The last group E contains ‘ezetimibe’ and
‘hesperetin’. These two compounds are primarily used as choles-
terol lowering agents (statins). As cholesterol metabolism in the
brain appears to be related to dementia, statins are believed to
prevent or improve the symptoms of the patients. Although early
studies (W olozin, 2004) have failed to clearly show a beneﬁcial
effect, the investigation is still open. From the examples brieﬂy
presented above, reported and conﬁrmed by the literature, the
FTC appears to be suitable to identify real repurposing hypoth-
eses tailored to a disease. Correctly identifying MoAs of interest
helps to retrieve the compounds which might impact the treat-
ment of a condition.

3 DISCUSSION

The FTC is a novel classiﬁcation for approved drugs, which
can be used as a starting point to generate drug repurposing
hypotheses. This classiﬁcation leverages the information pre-
sent in various databases and ontologies, similarly to the
Open PHACTS initiative (\Nilliams et al., 2012) and to
the work done by Hoehndorf et al. (2012). The FTC
mostly differentiates itself from these projects by providing a
whole set of new categories on the top of the integrated
information, dedicated to tackle a very speciﬁc problem:
drug repositioning.

3.1 Biological assumptions

An asset of the FTC is its ability to handle efﬁciently categorical
data: classes and relationships are accurately deﬁned, in order to
classify compounds based on the semantics of their relations. The
properties linking drugs to their respective protein targets (‘posi-
tive’ and ‘negative perturbations’) are, however, simplistic. At the
time being, no consideration is given regarding the binding
strength between the drug and the proteins, yet it is a key
factor to derive potent and speciﬁc activities in the human
body. This is also the case for other types of numerical data,
such as the dosage; the FTC can predict a role for a drug, yet
it cannot provide any information about the concentration or the
administration route necessary to obtain the potential effects.
The current relations between targets and their involvement in
biological processes are also not a fully accurate representation
of the biological phenomenon. In a cell, speciﬁc domains of the
protein could mediate different functions. Only one of such ac-
tivity types can sometimes be inhibited by a drug (Kruger et al.,
2012), yet we are assuming in the FTC that as long as a drug
affects a protein, it can therefore alter all its known functions.
These limitations come from the semantics behind the axioms
structuring the classiﬁcation themselves based on the informa-
tion available from the databases. Despite entailing not entirely
accurately the biochemical reality, the axioms help to generate a
larger number of hypotheses, the primary goal of the FTC. The
dosage issue is partially addressed by the ‘regulator pattern’ (see
Section 3.1 of Supplementary Material): it should be easier to
experimentally adjust the concentration of the compounds clas-
siﬁed as ‘pro-’ or ‘anti-’ biological process agents in order to
modulate a physiological effect. The predictions generated by
the FTC depend on the resolution of the curated information

released by the original data providers. Erroneous or missing
information will lead to misclassiﬁcation by the reasoner. Some
expected outcomes are also missing from the predictions; ‘silde-
naﬁl’ for instance was expected to be classiﬁed as ‘pro-penile
erection agent’ (FTC_A0043084), yet the lack of appropriate
GO annotation prevents it. After discussion with the GOA cur-
ation team, a manual annotation can only be asserted based on
published experimental results. No document was found to
support the involvement of the cGMP—speciﬁc 3’,5’-cyclic
phosphodiesterase (sildenaﬁl’s main target) in the ‘negative regu-
lation of penile erection’ (GO:0060407), therefore no annotation
can be made. Further work could be done in this direction, by
trying to automatically infer more annotations or by using the
electronically generated ones, in order to generate broader yet
potentially less plausible repurposing hypotheses.

3.2 Interpreting the evaluation

Out of the evaluation, the high recall value (89%) supports the
idea behind the automated build of the FTC: the data from
different repositories funded and curated in parallel, can be
integrated to automatically create a new resource. This new
classiﬁcation (FTC) contains most of the known information
present in an external gold standard (ATC) and relies on de-
scription logics to leverage the native information. In the con-
text of this work, we have compared the content of the FTC
against the ATC, knowing that these two taxonomies have
diverging goals. During the evaluation, equivalences have
been manually asserted between classes, which are assumed to
have fairly similar meaning and containing similar sets of com-
pounds. These manual assertions are however a weakness, as
they are themselves not evaluated (free parameter). The pres-
ence or absence of a link was determined only by one curator
and any mistake can inﬂuence consequently the recall and pre-
cision values. The precision of 50% tells that the FTC tends to
over-assigns compounds to MoA categories. The low precision
value is acceptable in our case, as one of the underlying mo-
tivation of the FTC is to broadly represent polypharmacology,
specially the one not present in gold standards such as the
ATC, referencing only legal usage. In this regards, the evalu-
ation should be considered more as a safety control rather than
a formal assessment of a predictive method. The false positives
derived from the evaluation can also be considered as drug
repurposing hypotheses: these drugs can indeed be interpreted
as suitable for the ATC category, yet not indexed as such.
However, these predictions should be interpreted with caution,
as it is currently impossible to distinguish a false positive from
a reproﬁling opportunity. These considerations do not interfere
with the repurposing predictions generated based on semantic
similarities or discrete categories as presented in the Section 2.2.
Finally, note that the ATC/FTC equivalences are open and
editable online, any modiﬁcation will be automatically incorpo-
rated in the next release of the resource. It is also possible to
evaluate the FTC against a different taxonomy, like the
Medical Subject Headings for example, which can be subject
to future work.

4 CONCLUSION

The FTC is public resource, which should assist drug repurpos-
ing initiatives or enhance computational studies that judge drugs
according to their ‘mode of action’. The resource attributes bio-
molecular functions and processes to drugs, the same way as GO
types have been assigned to gene products. The construction of
FTC relies on axiomatic representations of MoA as the core
means to attribute and derive the MoA for approved drugs.
We shown the validity of the approach by comparing the content
of the FTC to a well-established gold standard, the ATC. We
further illustrate the tight relationship between the MoA and the
indication of a drug and demonstrate using Alzheimer’s disease
as an example how the resource helps to formulate drug repos-
itioning hypotheses. The work leverages the semantics of distinct
databases, working in parallel on different thematics. The plat-
form will be further used to generate predictions in a systematic
fashion, which can then be experimentally tested in the labora-
tory for validation.

5 AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION

The code behind the creation of the resource is entirely open and
available at https://github.com/loopasam/ftc. The web applica-
tion and the FTC are built using the Brain library (Croset et al.,
2013) and can be ﬁnd at https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/ftc. The
documentation can be accessed at https://github.com/loopasam/
ftc/wiki. The full description of the methodology used to gener-
ate the classiﬁcation is available as Supplementary Material.

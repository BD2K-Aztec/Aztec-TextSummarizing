Abstract

Summary: ICMA, a software framework to create 3D finite element models of the left ventricle
from cardiac ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, has been made available as an
open-source code. The framework is hardware vendor independent and uses speckle tracking
(endocardial border detection) on ultrasound (MRI) imaging data in the form of DICOM. Standard
American Heart Association segment-based strain analysis can be performed using a browser-
based interface. The speckle tracking, border detection and model fitting methods are implemented
in C++ using open-source tools. They are wrapped as web services and orchestrated via a JBOSS-

based application server.

Availability and implementation: The source code for ICMA is freely available under MPL 1.1 or
GPL 2.0 or LGPL 2.1 license at https://github.com/ABI-Software-Laboratory/ICMA and a standalone

virtual machine at http://goo.gl/M4IJKH for download.

1 Introduction

Cardiac echocardiography is a widely used modality to assess wall
motion due to its non-invasiveness and comparatively lower setup
costs. Most ultrasound vendors provide proprietary software to ana-
lyze the echocardiogram, for instance, GE’s EchoPac and Phillips’s
QLAB. The software enables cardiologists to determine clinically
relevant parameters such as ejection-fraction, regional wall strain
etc. However, these software components are expensive, tied to the
vendor hardware and not open-source.

Clinical reports generated by the software vary across vendors
for the same patient data and therefore there is a lack of standard-
ization across the vendors. This makes it difficult to perform multi-
site, population-based studies where data are collected from
hardware developed by a multitude of vendors.

We developed a model guided speckle tracking method that
tracks left ventricular wall motion in cardiac ultrasound images.
The motion data are then used to fit a finite element model (FEM)
to reconstruct the ventricular geometry. Motion information from
one or more ultrasound views can be combined to improve the re-
constructed geometry. These modules are independent of each other
and wall motion data gathered from other modalities like MRI can
also be used. Diagnostic parameters such as regional strain, ejection-
fraction, etc. are determined from the model that represents the ven-
tricular geometry.

Using a browser-based graphical user interface, with a workﬂow
similar to existing software, the user can guide the geometry recon-
struction process by choosing the images to be used, providing land-
marks at the beginning and end R-wave frames (the framework

automatically tracks them over the cardiac cycle) for each of these
images and verifying the tracked motion. Administrative tasks such
as adding and removing subjects, removing models created by users,
etc. are also invoked through browser-based GUIs.

The framework provides complete regional strain analysis
metrics as offered by commercially available packages. There are no
restrictions/limitations on using these available features.

2 Implementation details

The framework consists of loosely coupled software modules. A
schematic of module integration is shown in Figure 1. DICOM data
are stored in PACS that exposes WADO; currently DCM4CHEE
(www.dcm4che.org) with a MySQL database (www.mysql.com) is
used. DICOM data are preprocessed using ffmpeg (www.ffmpeg.
org) to generate web optimized movies and images. These files along
with metadata from the DICOM header are stored in a MySQL
database (model repository).

To perform quantitative analysis of the imaging data, the user
has to reconstruct the ventricular geometry by selecting images of
interest. For each of the selected images, view plane information
(short axis, apical long axis, four chamber, etc.), cardiac cycle of
interest and geometric landmarks that aid in tracking the wall mo-
tion should be provided. A browser-based user interface provides
various controls to select PACS data, to perform geometry recon-
struction and to render them. The user interface is developed using
HTML and JavaScript (dojotoolkit.org, jquery.com). The 3D mesh
is rendered using zinc-browser plugin (www.cmiss.org/cmgui/zinc)
and must be installed on the user’s computer.

Compute intensive processes are hosted on the server and the
user interface interacts with the server via servlets. A J2EE-based
web application orchestrates the model generation and rendering
pipeline. It has developed on JBOSS AS 7.1.1 webserver (jbossas.
jboss.orgl). The models are stored in the model repository along
with the study metadata, movies and images.

The speckle tracking module implements the speckle tracking
method discussed in (Leitman et al., 2004) along with an adaptive
left ventricular model (Young et al., 2000) to robustly follow the
wall motion in noisy images and to speed up the process by restrict-
ing the tracking process to regions of interest. Image processing was
done using ITK 4.2 toolkit (itk.org). DICOM processing was aided
by gdcm (sourceforge.net/projects/gdcm/).

The model fitting module is based on the framework proposed
by Young et al. (1994). Mesh representation and manipulation was
done using OpenCMISS-Zinc library (opencmiss.org/zinc), fit opti-
mization was performed using gmm library (home.gna.org/getfem/).
Alglib (www.alglib.net) was used to determine the radial basis-based
displacement field and smoothing of wall motion.

Each of these modules are wrapped as a web service and hosted
on a JBOSS AS 7.1.1 instance. Note that all these modules have
been developed on readily available open-source tools.

We compared the quantitative metrics produced by this frame-
work with some of the widely used proprietary software using
Bland—Altman analysis and the repeatability coefficient (RPC) for
the framework was 5.3, with the intraobserver RPC being 4.5. The
best performing proprietary software had an RPC of 3.0 (see
Supplementary information for details).

Unlike proprietary software, the framework is open-source and
the wall motion tracking methods can be readily accessed, analyzed
and modified. Also, different methods for performing wall motion
tracking can be easily plugged into the framework.

The ventricular geometry is available as a finite element mesh
and this enables

1. Easy development of metrics.
Coupling of the imaging data to computer simulations
(Sermesant et al., 2012).

3. Integrating a multitude of clinical data to deliver patient speciﬁc
care (Gladding et al., 2013).

A key feature of ICMA is that the user interface is browser based
and allows data to be accessed across a network.

With advances in medical device technologies a variety of port-
able imaging devices are being developed. Semantic cohesiveness of
assessment metrics becomes critical for successful and large scale de-
ployment of such devices. Our primary motivation to release ICMA
as an open-source technology is with the hope that it would be
adopted by the community to

Develop new modules to integrate portable devices.
Develop new modules to use the FEM models.
Improve upon the existing modules.

Incorporate other visualization/analysis systems.

Provide a reference standard for metrics.

Further, to the best of our knowledge we are not aware of any
open-source or freely available cardiac-ultrasound strain analysis
software.

In USA, annual imaging costs alone exceed $100 billion
(Iglehart, 2006) and cardiovascular imaging accounts for 29% of all
medical imaging (Levin et al., 2005). About one-third of all annual
medical imaging costs worldwide can be attributed to

cardiovascular imaging (Picano, 2005). This may be partly attrib-
uted to proprietary software products and their designed incompati-
bility with other software and hardware vendors. We believe that an
open-source community-led effort to develop software for such
applications can reduce these costs and ICMA presents a model im-
plementation that can be improved upon.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Payao is a community-based, collaborative web service
platform for gene-regulatory and biochemical pathway model
curation. The system combines Web 2.0 technologies and online
model visualization functions to enable a collaborative community
to annotate and curate biological models. Payao reads the models
in Systems Biology Markup Language format, displays them with
CellDesigner, a process diagram editor, which complies with the
Systems Biology Graphical Notation, and provides an interface for
model enrichment (adding tags and comments to the models) for
the access-controlled community members.

Availability and implementation: Freely available for model curation
service at http://www.payaologue.org. Web site implemented in
Seaser Framework 2.0 with SZFIex2, MySQL 5.0 and Tomcat 5.5,
with all major browsers supported.

1 INTRODUCTION

Creating an extensive model of gene—regulatory and biochemical
networks with the latest data is a painstaking task. Curation
is essential to creating an accurate model. Yet as science and
technology advances rapidly, once curated models soon become
out—of—date and need to be revised constantly. Many pathways and
networks are now available online Via pathway databases, such as
Reactome, BioModels.net, Panther Pathways and many pathway
editors are available (Bauer—Mehren et al., 2009). What is needed is a
framework to facilitate tracking and update mechanism for modelers
and researchers in the community to contribute to the collaborative
model building and curation process.

WikiPathways (Pico et al., 2008) is an effort for such a
collaborative platform in the Wiki style. While the Wiki system has
its strength in collaborative editing and version tracking, it does not
provide access control or explicit community tagging mechanisms.
In a community—driven model enrichment environment, it is
effective to differentiate privileges to special interest group (SIG)
members for curation activities—commenting on existing tags,
adding tags to models, annotating individual component inside a
model and validating the annotations. In View of the complexity of
biological pathways and the expertise of biologists in different areas,

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

a community platform for biology requires an exquisite balance
of federated resource sharing and quality control of information
by a SIG of experts in the particular pathway or process. An
access control privilege system allows the community to share
and disseminate the knowledge, while enabling a dedicated SIG
to maintain high—quality, curated information.

To provide such a curation framework, we have developed a
system called ‘Payao’. The system is named after a ﬁsh aggregating
device, an artiﬁcial ﬂoating raft where ﬁsh congregate and popular
in Okinawa/Philippine area. Payao aims to become a biological
knowledge aggregating system, which enable a community to work
on the same models simultaneously, insert tags as pop—up balloon to
the parts of the model, exchange comments, record the discussions
and eventually update the models accurately and concurrently.

The current workﬂow for pathway curation has two phases
working in a cyclical manner, as shown in Figure l: pathway editing
using biological pathway editors (CellDesigner) and community—
driven pathway enrichment and knowledge sharing. Payao serves
for enrichment phase of the curation. Payao is a web—based
platform, providing an interface for adding tags and comments to
the components (such as Species, Reactions and speciﬁed area) of
the model, as well as community management functionality. The
information on the users and tag data is stored in a relational database
(RDBMS) on the server. Payao adopts community standards,
accepting Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML; Hucka
et al., 2003) format models and displays them in Systems Biology
Graphical Notation (Le Novere et al., 2009) compliant CellDesigner
(Funahashi et al., 2008) graphical notation. Curation data on Payao
can be easily reintegrated into the original model Via CellDesigner.

2 PLATFORM

Payao consists of the server application, client user interface
and database. The server application has been implemented in
Java on Seaser Framework 2.0 with S2Flex2. Tomcat 5.5 was
used as the servlet container to build the web application. The
client user interface has been implemented in ActionScript on
Flex framework 2.0.1, which allows us to build a Rich Internet
Application to Visualize SBML models. The server communicates
with the client Via the Action Message Format (AMF3) protocol
on S2Flex2, which enables us to translate between Java Objects
in Seaser and Action Script Object in Flex. The server can
handle CellDesigner models including SBML models and the Visual
information using CellDesigner API ver.4.0. It parses SBML ﬁles
sent from client to create CellDesigner models, and provides the
information as CellDesigner Plugin classes. The client application
receives the model information and draws the model. MySQL 5.0 is
used to store information on user, model and tags/comments in the
database.

3 FEATURES

As Payao accepts pathway models stored in SBML format and uses
CellDesigner APIs for Visualization, the most suitable SBML editor
for Payao is CellDesigner. In SBML format, models can capture
details of biochemical process descriptions, not only protein—protein
interactions. Adopting SBML format enables the models to be easily
used as the base of computational data analysis or simulation of
dynamic behaviors. The Payao platform enriches the model curation
process by providing a host of features for user management, tagging
and model updates [detailed are available for reference in (Payao
User guide, 2009)].

3.1 Community management

Forming a community is an important step for curation. Different
expertise groups can contribute variety of information to the model.
As web—based Payao can be accessible from all physical locations, it
enables experts across the world to communicate in a collaborative
curation effort.

Community is formed around a pathway model. It is the model
owner who sets access control over the registered model. In the
Payao system, access controls can be set by specifying the privileges
to individuals as well as to user categories, such as guest, login user
and model user (who are invited to access the model by the model
owner). This enables a user to stage the curation process, initiate the
curation within a small group (e. g. SIG) and then switch the access
control of the model for public Viewing.

3.2 Model management

The model owner registers and manages the SBML model. Upon
registration, the model owner speciﬁes the basic model information
including, thumbnail image, references and copyright. The owner
sets the access privilege to the user in three levels (browsing,
adding tags, adding comments) by user categories or by individual
users. The registered models can be sorted by Register Date and by
Popularity. Popularity is measured by the activity level (number of
tags and comments) and ranked in the list. All the registered models
are listed with the thumbnails in the top screen in the right panel
(Fig. 2). Registered models are stored in the database.

3.3 Community tagging and commenting

The tagging on the Visually represented pathways is a characteristic
of Payao, which makes the curators easy to grasp the nature of
the pathway while discussing on the speciﬁc component of the
pathways. Like Google Maps, tags are displayed in a bubble form
attached to the items (Species, Reactions or any speciﬁed area), and
click to expand and display the content of the information in the
tag. Tags can speciﬁcally be keywords, links, PubMed IDs as well
as free text, as shown in Figure 3. A TagSet groups a set of tags and
can be color coded for ease of Viewing. User—deﬁned TagSets also
allow access control features (browsing, editing and editing tags)
to be set by a user, in the same way as for model access privilege
settings. Thus, a user can set permissions to a ‘My Tagset’, which
hides comments and tags from the community members. Inside the
tag, comments can be added in the free text format. While tags
anchor the points for annotation in the model, comments function
serves as the discussion space.

3.4 Model update: tag data export and import

Data in the tags can be exported from the Payao system, evaluated
outside the system and integrated into the Payao system or to
the SBML model ﬁle. All the information, including the model
ﬁle (CellDesigner format), Tags/Comments and model image
(png/jpg/pdf format) in a ZIP ﬁle format are exported in a batch.
Information stored in Tags is exported as a table in .csv format, which
can be edited and imported back to the system. The tag information
can also be imported into the base CellDesigner—format model as
‘notes’ using a CellDesigner plugin (import notes) and stored in
SBML ‘notes’ annotation. Once the base model has been updated
using CellDesigner, the model owner can reregister the model onto
Payao for further curation.

4 FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

Payao will facilitate the evolution of CellDesigner from a simple
tag—based pathway curation tool to a more versatile, comprehensive
platform. The next version of CellDesigner will adopt support
for Minimum Information Required in the Annotation of Models
(MIRIAMs; Le Novere et al., 2005) standard for annotation and

allow MIRIAM annotations to be viewed on Payao. Modules to
support import of different pathway exchange formats (BioPax),
visual mapping of experimental data on pathway components in
Payao, would be developed in future versions. Future enhancements
also include integration of Payao with biological text mining
techniques to facilitate literature—driven knowledge enrichment of
existing pathway models. Tracking model updates using an RSS
(Really Simple Syndication) feed will assist curators as well as
public viewers. Statistics for measuring contribution of individuals
to the model curation process as well as community interest
(measured by count of tags and comments on a model) would be
integrated into Payao in future releases. In the long run, we envisage
this system to be a platform for aggregation, dissemination and
community exchange for biological pathway models.

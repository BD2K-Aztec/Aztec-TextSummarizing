Abstract

Motivation: Mechanistic models based on ordinary differential equations provide powerful and ac-
curate means to describe the dynamics of molecular machinery which orchestrates gene regula-
tion. When combined with appropriate statistical techniques, mechanistic models can be calibrated
using experimental data and, in many cases, also the model structure can be inferred from time—
course measurements. However, existing mechanistic models are limited in the sense that they
rely on the assumption of static network structure and cannot be applied when transient phenom-
ena affect, or rewire, the network structure. In the context of gene regulatory network inference,
network rewiring results from the net impact of possible unobserved transient phenomena such as
changes in signaling pathway activities or epigenome, which are generally difficult, but important,
to account for.

Results: We introduce a novel method that can be used to infer dynamically evolving regulatory
networks from time—course data. Our method is based on the notion that all mechanistic ordinary
differential equation models can be coupled with a latent process that approximates the network
structure rewiring process. We illustrate the performance of the method using simulated data and,
further, we apply the method to study the regulatory interactions during T helper 17 (Th17) cell dif-
ferentiation using time—course RNA sequencing data. The computational experiments with the real
data show that our method is capable of capturing the experimentally verified rewiring effects of
the core Th17 regulatory network. We predict Th17 lineage specific subnetvvorks that are activated
sequentially and control the differentiation process in an overlapping manner.

1 Introduction

 

During the past years, several computational approaches have been
proposed to infer the structure and dynamics of gene regulatory net-
works from either steady-state or time—course measurements
(Marbach et al., 2012). The approaches range from statistical and
information theoretic methods to mechanistic models. Mechanistic
models are capable of describing the actual molecular dynamics
originating from reaction kinetics and the underlying network struc-
ture can also be accurately estimated by combining these models
with appropriate statistical techniques (see e.g. Intosalmi et al.,

2015; Schulz et al., 2009; Xu et al., 2010). Typically, a mechanistic
model consists of a set of interacting molecular components and a
formal description for the possible mechanisms affecting the time-
evolution of the components. While the mechanistically motivated
network inference works well for static network topologies, the
standard approach cannot be applied if the molecular mechanisms
depend on transient cellular processes, and in particular, if the net-
work structure is dynamically rewired. A good example of such
transient processes are epigenetic modifications that typically are
not observed in detail but can have a major effect on regulatory

interactions, for instance, during cellular differentiation. In the pres-
ence of such transient processes, the structure of network becomes
time-dependent and, consequently, the network inference becomes
notably more challenging.

The importance of dynamically evolving regulatory mechanisms
has been recognized in many recent experimental studies and also
computational techniques have been developed to analyze and
understand measurements that are possibly affected by transient
mechanisms (see e.g. Yosef et al., 2013). The existing computational
approaches that address this problem primarily focus on state-space
models, such as non-stationary dynamic Bayesian networks
(Dondelinger et al., 2013; Grzegorczyk and Husmeier, 2011;
Robinson and Hartemink, 2010) and probabilistic Boolean net-
works and their variants (Shmulevich et al., 2002). To our best
knowledge, general approaches that would complement mechanistic
models so that they could be used to study and detect dynamically
evolving regulatory networks do not exist. The inevitable strength of
mechanistic models is that they are capable of describing the under-
lying molecular mechanisms in detail, and when combined with stat-
istical modeling, they can take the analysis of time—course data well
beyond the state-space models. In other words, by means of mechan-
istic models it is possible to describe and analyze the actual processes
behind the data and not only find patterns, correlations, or other
dependencies in time-series. Given these strengths of mechanistic
modeling, it is obvious that a high practical value can be obtained
by extending this model class to account also for dynamically evolv-
ing molecular networks.

In this study, we develop a novel mechanistic analysis method
that can be used to detect and analyze latent processes which affect
the molecular mechanisms by rewiring the underlying network
structure. The method that we introduce is called the latent effect
mechanistic (LEM) model and it is based on the notion that all
mechanistic ordinary differential equation (ODE) models can be
coupled with a latent process that approximates the net impact of
transient mechanisms affecting the structure of molecular network.
We embed the LEM model into a well-defined statistical framework
that allows us to infer possible latent effects simultaneously with the
model structure and rate parameters. In addition to the theoretical
derivation of the LEM model, we also outline numerical techniques
that are required to carry out the analysis. We exemplify the per-
formance of our method using simulated data and conclude that we
can rigorously recover the underlying model using our inference al-
gorithms. Further, we apply our method to study the regulatory
interactions during T helper 17 (Th17) cell differentiation using
time—course RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data and conclude that
our analysis results are in agreement with the previously observed
results regarding the time-dependency of the regulatory network
that steers Th17 lineage specification.

2 Approach

To illustrate our modeling idea, let us consider a gene and some
transcription factor A that activates the gene. Let us also assume
that, prior to stimulation, the gene’s locus is covered with epigenetic
marks that prevent the transcription factor A binding the promoter
(Fig. 1, left panel) and the gene remains inactive. Upon stimulation,
epigenetic marks are removed by unknown enzymatic signals
(Fig. 1, middle panel) and eventually the promoter region becomes
clear from the repressive marks and the transcription factor can
bind the promoter (Fig. 1, right panel). As a result of binding, the
gene is activated and a gene product B is produced (Fig. 1, right

panel). In mathematical terms this unobserved activation process
corresponds to moving from the ‘no interaction’ network structure
(Fig. 1, left panel) to ‘interaction activated’ network structure (Fig.
1, right panel). Because molecular reactions steering the epigenetic
signaling are stochastic in nature, the change from the initial state to
the active state does not occur synchronously in a cell culture. In
other words, the fraction of cells in the active state increases grad-
ually after stimulation while the fraction of cells in the inactive state
decreases. Even though we may neither know nor be able to measure
the molecular events that participate in the removal of the repressive
epigenetic marks, we can construct an ODE model that describes the
net impact of these events at the population level. In this toy ex-
ample, the model can be, for instance, the ODE system

d
% = —0xu(t)x1 (1)
d
% = 0.u(t)x1 (2)

where x1 and x2 denote the relative fractions of cells in the inactive
and active states, u(t) is an input signal representing stimulus, and 0,,
is a free conversion rate parameter. In this study, we call the solution
of this model a latent process. Figure 2(a) illustrates the possible dy-
namics of the above latent process with different conversion rates
and Figure 2(b) shows an example of a latent process that consists
of three sequential states (latent processes with multiple sequential
phases will be discussed more in Section 3.5).

In general, if we have some understanding about the mechanisms
that influence the production and degradation of the transcription
factor A and the gene product B, we can build a mechanistic model

that would rigorously describe their dynamics. For instance, we can
construct a model in the form of an ODE system

dlAl _
7 _ —61[AI (3)
% = 160 + 161 [Al — 52lBl’ (4)

where we have assumed that A and B degrade at rates 61 and 62, re-
spectively, B is produced at the basal rate kg, and A activates B at
the rate [al. This simple model corresponds to the mechanisms illus-
trated in the right panel in Figure 1. If the assumptions of the mech-
anisms incorporated into the model are reasonably realistic, the
parameters of the model can be inferred from time—course popula-
tion average data on A and B by means of statistical techniques.
However, if the interaction between A and B is affected (i.e. rewired)
by transient silencing of the gene, parameter and model inference re-
sults may become seriously biased or wrong.

The LEM model for the above example system can be con-
structed by considering the standard ODE model (Eqs 3 and 4) and
coupling it with the two-state latent process described by Eqs 1 and
2. In this example, the latent state x1 represents the early state with
inactive gene (silencing on) and the state x2 the late state in which
the repressive marks are removed. The LEM model is constructed by
coupling the ODE system with the latent process. This results in the
time—variant ODE system

where z1,z2 E {0, 1}. The binary parameters zl, z; parameterize the
network structure and indicate whether the interaction between A
and B is active in the latent states x1 and x; or not. Effectively this
results in four alternative models that are listed in the Table 1. By
means of quantitative model comparison, we can select the most
likely configuration for z1 and zz and detect if transient mechanisms
are present. Further, the model selection and parameter inference
provide information about the possible dynamics of latent processes
which, in the context of our example, means that we can infer the
rate at which the cells leave the inactive state and enter active state.
Naturally, if model selection indicates that most likely z1 = 1 and
zz = 1, it is obvious that the LEM model reduces to the standard
ODE model.

In the above example, the latent process can naturally be coupled
with all mechanisms included into the model, that is, the basal in-
duction, degradation, and interaction between A and B. In this case,
the model selection should be carried out by considering 24X2 2 28
alternative model structures compared to 24 model structures in the
standard ODE model. For example, stimulus dependent degradation
could be detected along with transient interaction between A and B.

3 Methods

3.1 Formal definition of the LEM model

As illustrated above, the first component of our model is a standard
mechanistic ODE model. The standard model can be constructed
using the law of mass action, Michaelis—Menten or Hill kinetics, or
any other similar approach. Without any loss of generality, we as-
sume that the resulting model can be expressed in the form

d i ii
d—D; = 0y), 
i=1

where i: 1,...,N, fiI-(y,0y) :IRN >< IR” —> IR, f,- is the number of
functions f,-,- affecting the component y,- (and we denote
] =]1 + . . . +]N), and y(t,0y) : [0, T] x IR” —> RN. In addition, we
need to design a latent process x(t, 0x) : [0,T] >< Rm —> RM which
represents M possible underlying latent states. The latent process
can be constructed by means of heuristically motivated ODE model-
ing, as presented for the toy model above, or by defining a well-
motivated parametric form for the process (as we do in Section 3.5).
Regardless how the latent process is constructed, it is important that
its functional form is ﬂexible enough so that it is possible to infer la-
tent dynamics from the data.

Given a standard ODE model and a latent process, the LEM
model is constructed by coupling them. Formally, we can write

d  Ii
71 = Zap, ey>w<t,x,z,-1, . . . m). (8)
i=1
where
M
szxk(ta 036)
w(t, x, m, . . . ,zM) = k=1 , (9)

M
Z xk (t) 0x)
[2:1

is a weight function depending on the latent state and
zik E {0, 1}, k = 1, . . . ,M. The binary parameters zik determine if fil-
is effective in the latent state xk or not (the values 1 and 0, respect-
ively). It is convenient to store these binary parameters into a ] X M
matrix Z so that {Z}ik = zik. Note that in the standard ODE ap-
proach the network structure is defined by a ] X 1 vector. The LEM
modeling approach allows the network structure to be rewired and
the consecutive rewiring steps (and thus the dynamically evolving
network structure) is defined by a binary] X M matrix Z. Now

y(t70y7x(t70x)az) ERN 

is the solution of the ODE system that is coupled with the latent pro-
cess and we define the model output to be

¢(t,6.,6.,z) e RK (11)

which can consist of some subset K S N of the state variables y.

In this study, we aim to infer the parameters 0), and 0x as well as
the most likely configuration of the matrix Z from time—course
data. In order to do this in a rigorous manner, we need to formulate
the problem in statistical terms.

3.2 Statistical framework to infer the model parameters
and the network structure Z

It is important to combine mathematical modeling with time—course
data using well-motivated, data type specific statistical models.
Statistical modeling makes it possible to weight the data in an

objective way and propagate the uncertainty in the measurements
through the models in a proper manner. In the following, we present
a general statistical framework for the LEM model. By means of this
framework it is possible to combine the LEM model with any data
type or combination data types including, for instance, read count
sequencing data and qPCR measurements. The only requirement is
that we are capable of making some assumptions about the distribu-
tion of the chosen data type(s).

Let Dkl be a measurement of the lath component of the output (I)
at time t; and let us denote (pk, = 4403;). A statistical model can be
constructed by assuming that the observation DH is distributed ac-
cording to some distribution g which depends on the model output
(pk, and the parameters of the distribution 1%. In other words,

Dkl N 8(Dk1|¢k1, 9d)- (12)

In the context of our ODE model, (pk, is fully determined by the
parameters 0),, 0x and Z, and consequently, we can write
g(Dkl|(/)kl, 0,1) = g(Dkl|0y, 0x,Z, 0d). Further, by introducing the no-
tation 0 = {03” 0x, 0d}, the distribution can be expressed in the form
g(Dkl|0, Z). Now, if we have time—course data on the state variables
and we can assume that the measurements are independent given (I),
we can define the likelihood function

K L
n(DI6,Z) = Hﬂgwizlaz) <13)
k=1 [:1
whereD = {Dkbk = 1,...,K;l= 1,...,L}.

A Bayesian statistical model can be obtained by combining the
likelihood function with a prior distribution on the parameters, 7t(0,
Z) (for details about Bayesian methodology, see e.g. Robert, 2007).
In our model formulation, the different configurations of the binary
matrix Z define a discrete set of network structures and it is conveni-
ent to write the prior distribution in the form 7t(l9, Z) = 7t(0|Z)7t(Z),
where 7t(Z) is the prior distribution over network structures. By
applying Bayes’ theorem, we obtain the parameter posterior

distribution
imp), Z) = W, (14)

where
7r(D|Z) = Jn(D|0,Z)n(0|Z)d0 (15)

is the marginal likelihood of the model specified by Z. When the
marginal likelihoods 7t(D|Z) of different configurations for matrix Z
are available, model ranking can easily be done by means of the pos-
terior distribution

7r(ZID) O< 7t(DIZWZ), (16)
or equivalently,
logn(Z|D) = log7I(D|Z) + log7t(Z) + C, (17)

where C is a constant.

3.3 Estimating logarithmic posterior probabilities for
alternative models

Several different techniques exist to estimate the marginal likelihood
(for a review, see e.g. Friel and Wyse, 2012). In this study, we ap-
proximate the marginal likelihood by means of Laplace method and
some further simplifications that are discussed in detail, for instance,
by Ripley (1996) (pages 63-64). This approximation allows us to

write the estimator for the logarithmic posterior probabilities of the
alternative models (Eq. 17) in the form

log7t(Z|D) = log7t(D|0, Z) — %10g(n) + log7t(Z) + C, (18)

where 7t(D|0,Z) is the maximum likelihood, kg is the number of
parameters, and n is the number of observations. For model ranking
purposes, we can simply neglect the constant C and compare unnor-
malized logarithmic posterior probabilities. Further, if the prior dis-
tribution over alternative configurations of binary matrix Z is
uniform, Eq. 18 reduces to a form that corresponds to the Bayesian
information criterion (Schwarz, 1978).

3.4 Forward-backward-stepwise selection to speed up
model ranking

If we consider a LEM model that consists of ] mechanisms and M la-
tent states, we have altogether ZJXM alternative models (i.e. the num-
ber of different configurations of binary matrix Z). Typically, the
numbers of mechanisms and latent states are such that the estima-
tion of marginal likelihood for all alternative configurations is out
of reach. Therefore, we suggest to speed up the model ranking task
by means of forward-backward-stepwise selection. This leads essen-
tially to an algorithm that can be implemented through the follow-
ing four steps:

1. Set free elements in Z to zero and estimate logn(Z|D) for this
model.

2. Generate]><M matrices Z*251252, c1 = 1,...,], cz = 1,...,M by
ﬂipping elements in Z, that is,

{Z}/—k + 1(mod2)  = C1, [8 = 62

2*,61,62 ' =
{ }’k l {2}). mischieecz

and estimate logn(Z|D) for the corresponding models.

3. Update Z to correspond the model that produces the highest
posterior probability, that is, the highest logn(Z

4. Stop if the best ranked model does not indicate improvement in
the model ﬁt compared to the previous logn(Z|D) values.

5. Otherwise go back to Step 2.

3.5 LEM model for the core regulatory network driving
Th17 cell specification

T helper 17 (Th17) cells play a crucial role in the adaptive immune
system (Korn et al., 2009) and they have been noted to have import-
ant functions in various autoimmune diseases (Weaver et al., 2013).
Recent experimental and computational studies have shed light to
the regulatory mechanisms that steer the differentiation from a naive
CD4+ helper T cell to a specialized Th17 cell (see e.g. Ciofani et al.,
2012; Intosalmi et al., 2015; Yosef et al., 2013). Yosef et al. (2013)
also report notable rewiring of the Th17 cell specific regulatory net-
work during early phase of the lineage specification and, conse-
quently, this provides us with a good application to test how LEM
model analysis performs in practice.

Figure 4(a) illustrates the core Th17 regulatory network that was
experimentally derived by Ciofani et al. (2012). The core network
consists of five transcription factors, the retinoic acid receptor-
related orphan receptor gamma t (RORC), signal transducer and ac-
tivator of transcription 3 (STAT3), basic leucine zipper transcription
factor (BATF), transcription factor Maf (MAF) and interferon regu-
latory factor 4 (IRF4), and contains only links that have been experi-
mentally validated. For instance, RORC knock-out experiments
show that RORC does not participate in any of the feedback

mechanisms regulating STAT3 and, consequently such interactions
are excluded from the network.

To convert the network structure into a quantitative dynamic
model, we denote the time-dependent expression levels of the genes
by y,(t),i = 1,. . . ,N (here, N =5) and assume that the genes can
have activating and inhibiting interactions, and, in addition, we
allow basal activation and degradation. Each of these mechanisms
can be associated with a corresponding rate equation and, as a re-
sult, we obtain an ODE system specified by

 N i N N in
27’ =ki+2kiw+ Z kfiiyiyk-Zkihym-ki‘w’ <19)
i=1 7' k = 1 i=1
7' < k

b .
where 12,, lei-f, [cf/i,

pendent activation, synergistic activation, inhibition and degrad-

ki-Ir-‘h and k? are unknown basal activation, inde-

ation rate constants, respectively. The rate constants are defined to
be strictly positive and setting a specific rate constant to zero re-
moves that mechanisms (and parameter) from the model. We use
the experimentally validated network (Fig. 4(a)) as a basis for our
inference and include all experimentally validated interactions to the
mechanistic model. To construct the LEM model, the system in Eq.
19 is combined with an appropriate latent process.

The latent process for Th17 LEM model is constructed based on
the findings reported by Yosef et al. (2013). They suggest that there
are three sequential wiring states during the early phase of Th17 cell
differentiation. From the mechanistic modeling perspective it is ob-
vious that transitions between the states must occur gradually and
two different wiring states can affect the observations simultan-
eously during the transitions. To describe a continuum of realistic
transitions occurring between the sequential rewiring states, we de-
fine the latent process

x30) = 1 1 (22)

— 1 + exp(22(t — 12))’

where 21, 22, 11 and 12 are the parameters of the process. Because
the rewiring occurs in sequential states, we also introduce the re-
striction 11 < 12. Figure 2(b) illustrates dynamics of this latent
process.

To analyze the core Th17 regulatory network using the LEM
model, we make use of the time—course RNA-seq data provided by
Ciofani et al. (2012). To obtain these data, Ciofani et al. (2012)
purified naive CD4+ cells from lymph nodes and spleen of wild-type
mice, cultured the cells in Th17 conditions, and harvested a propor-
tion of cells at the time-points 0, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 16, 24 and 48 h for
RNA-seq processing (see the original article for details). We use the
fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads
(FPKM) values of each gene to inform the LEM model and by
assuming independent normally distributed noise, we can write the
likelihood function (confer Eq. 13) in the form

5 8

n(DI0,Z) = H HMDHMJE, (a + M02), (23)

k=1 [:1

where we use same notation as in Section 3.2, Nu, 02) is the nor-
mal probability density function with mean u and variance 02, and or

and [f parameterize the likelihood function. To construct this statis-
tical model, we have assumed that the noise in the data depends on
the signal strength according to the parameter [3 and, in addition,
there is some basal level of variance that is determined by or. The ori-
ginal data consists of one measurement at each time point except at
time 6 h there are three replicates. We treat the measurements at 6 h
as a single measurement which is taken to be the mean of three repli-
cates. The initial state for each model is fixed according to the meas-
urement at time t = 0 h.

The prior distribution over the alternative configurations of the
matrix Z can be constructed in numerous ways and, in this study,
we use the truncated geometric distribution. More specifically, we
define h(Z) to denote the number of nonzero elements in the matrix
Z and set

n<z> = 1302(2) = K) =  <24)
Zion — p)”
K=0

where K = 0,. . . ,]M, and p = 0.3. Intuitively, we set the prior over
the number of nonzero elements in the matrix Z and, with the
chosen parameterization, the impact of this prior distribution is ra-
ther weak. However, the prior distribution is introduced to prevent
the forward-backward-stepwise selection algorithm proceeding in
the cases in which the parametric dimension of the model remains
the same and the model fit is improved in negligibly small fractions
due to overly complex network structure.

3.6 Computational implementation

The LEM model, the estimation of unnormalized logarithmic pos-
terior model probabilities, and the forward-backward-stepwise se-
lection algorithm are implemented in Matlab (The MathWorks Inc.,
Natick, MA, USA). The ODE systems are solved numerically using
the CVODES solver from the SUNDIALS package (Hindmarsh
et al., 2005). Maximum likelihood estimates for parameters are ob-
tained using multi-start local optimization strategy in a similar man-
ner as outlined by Raue et al. (2013, 2015). In brief, we solve
sensitivity equations in parallel with the ODE system, compute the
gradient of the likelihood function accordingly, and use this infor-
mation to carry out efficient local optimization. For each model, we
sample random initial parameter values using Latin hypercube sam-
pling and carry out the local optimization using lsqnonlin optimiza-
tion routine in Matlab. If the optimization routine happens to
operate in a parameter range that results in ODE responses that can-
not be solved by using the default settings of the CVODES solver,
the likelihood values at such points are mapped to a very small
value.

4 Results

4.1 Testing the method using simulated data

Before applying the LEM model to real data, we test the method
and the related numerical procedures using simulated data. To simu-
late data, we construct a four gene network that is assumed to con-
tain all mechanistically possible interactions (Fig. 3(a)). Further, we
assume that the interactions are affected by sequentially occurring
latent states in a similar manner as in our Th17 cell differentiation
application. The three different wirings of the network are shown in
Figure 3(b) and these wirings affect the observed dynamics in an
overlapping manner (see the latent process in Figure 3(c)). In other
words, we assume that the whole cell population does not switch
the wiring synchronously but the cells move gradually form one

wiring state to another. To construct a quantitative model based on
the interactions shown in Figure 3(a), we assume the same structure
for rate equations as in Section 3.5 for the Th17 cell specific core
network and build the full ODE model according to the Eq. 19.
Here, we assume that two genes (i.e. the genes A and B in Fig. 3(a))
have basal transcription mechanisms and the mRNA levels of all
genes are allowed to degrade at independent rates. Further, these
mechanisms are assumed to be present in all wiring states, that is,
the corresponding rows in the matrix Z are fixed to contain only
ones (see Table 2). To construct the LEM model for this system, we
couple the full ODE model with the latent process defined by Eqs.
20—22. The parameters that we use to simulate data are given in
parentheses after the inferred values in Table 2 and the resulting re-
sponse consisting of the latent process and the solution of the ODE
model is shown in Figure 3(c) (dashed lines). Figure 3(c) also shows
the actual data points that are simulated by adding normal ﬂuctu-
ations to the deterministic response according to the statistical
model (Eq. 23). In this example inference, the rate parameters are
assumed to lay in the range [10‘3 , 10] and we use 100 random initial
parameter values in the multi-start local optimization. Otherwise
the inference for the simulated data is implemented using the same
specifications that are used for the real data.

In the statistical model, the parameters or and [3 have the values, 0.0001 and

The inference results for the simulated data are summarized in
Figure 3 and Table 2. We conclude that the forward-backward-
stepwise selection algorithm converges successfully to the correct
configuration of matrix Z and the inferred parameter values are
very close to the values that are used to simulate the data (see
Table 2). Note that our approximative marginal likelihood compu-
tation together with prior for network structure imply appropriate
Occam’s razor and prevent inferring too complex models. Further,
the model response, that is solved using the inferred parameters of
the best model, is in a good agreement with the response that was
used to generate the data (confer the solid versus dashed lines in
Fig. 3(c)). All in all, the inference and model selection perform well
in this test case and we can proceed to analyze real data.

4.2 LEM model captures rewiring effects of regulatory
interactions during early Th17 lineage specification

We initiate the analysis of real data by visually inspecting the time—
course FPKM values. Our first observation is that the initial expres-
sion level of RORC is very low and, as a consequence, we deduce
that the basal expression of the RORC gene is on a rather weak
level. To incorporate this prior information into the LEM model
analysis, we remove the basal RORC expression from the mechanis-
tic model but allow basal transcription for other genes. The initial
expression levels for the ODE models are taken directly from the ex-
perimental data. Further, we allow the mRNA levels of all genes to
degrade during the experiment.

We run the LEM model inference for the Th17 RNA-seq data
using the specifications given in Sections 3.5 and 3.6. In our analysis,
the rate parameters are constrained to the range [10_3, 100] and we
use 300 random initial parameter values in the multi-start local
optimization (the analysis is also repeated using 600 random initial
parameter values to assure ourselves that the forward-backward-
stepwise selection algorithm is not affected by suboptimal

optimization performance). The inference results for the Th17 RNA-
seq data are summarized in Figure 4 and Table 3. Intriguingly, the
LEM model inference supports many interactions that were experi-
mentally validated using combinations of different measurement tech-
niques and experimental conditions in Ciofani et al. (2012) (for
instance, knock-out experiments). The inferred LEM model structure
is illustrated in Figure 4(b) and parameter values are given in Table 3.
Our LEM model inference does not only provide important infor-
mation about the regulatory interactions between the genes but can
also be used to generate predictions on the sequentially activated sub-
networks (Fig. 4(b)) as well as the time evolution of the latent states
that determine the impact of the subnetworks (Fig. 4(c)). The pre-
dicted latent process in Figure 4(c) shows that the first phase of differ-
entiation seems to be rather fast, the second state occurs
approximately within the time window form 4 to 13 h, and, eventu-
ally, after 20h, the gene expression levels settle to the stable pattern
in a long-lasting third state. This temporal behavior is in line with
three transcriptional phases reported by Yosef et al. (2013), that is,
early induction (up to 4 h), intermediate onset of phenotype and amp-
lification (4—20 h), and late stabilization (20—72 h). The predicted la-
tent process (Fig. 4(c)) suggests that these three phases occur in an
overlapping manner which seems very natural from the biological
point of view. Further, the maximum likelihood fit of the selected
model is in a good agreement with the time—course data (Fig. 4(c)).
The regulatory mechanisms that we predict to occur in three
waves (Fig. 4(b), (c) and Table 3) have also clear interpretations. In
the first phase, T cell activation and cytokine driven mechanisms are

induced and they prepare cells for lineage commitment (Phase 1 in
Fig. 4(b) and (c)). In the second phase, RORC is induced and the
differentiation signals are amplified, for instance, through MAF and
IRF4 activation (Phase 2 in Fig. 4(b) and (c)). In the third phase,
the lineage commitment is maintained through RORC activation
by BATF and STAT3 activation by IRF4 (Phase 3 in Fig. 4(b) and (c)).

A significant feature in the sequentially occurring subnetworks is
that STAT3 has a clear regulatory role during the first two phases.
Given the central role of STATs in T helper cell lineage commitment
in general (see e.g. Vahedi et al., 2012), we find this behavior
natural. As a matter of fact, STAT3 is directly activated by the
inducing cytokines that initiate the Th17 cell differentiation process
(Korn et al., 2009) and, besides this important role as an early acti-
vator, STAT3 also plays an important role in mechanisms that amp-
lify and stabilize the differentiation response (see e.g. Zhou et al.,
2007).

To assess the uncertainty in the estimated parameter values of
the inferred model, we carry out parameter identifiability analysis
by using the profile likelihood method. The parameter profile likeli-
hood for jth parameter can be defined by writing

which essentially is the maximized log-likelihood that is evaluated
as a function of a fixed value p for the ith parameter (Kreutz et al.,
2013). The profile likelihood can be used to determine confidence
intervals for estimated parameter values given a fixed confidence
level (for details, see Kreutz et al., 2013; Meeker and Escobar,
1995). A flat parameter profile likelihood results in an infinite confi-
dence interval and, thus, indicates structural non-identifiability
(Kreutz et al., 2013). On the other hand, a confidence interval that
is constrained at one end and extends infinitely to another direction
indicates practical non-identifiability (Kreutz et al., 2013). Figure 5
shows the parameter profile likelihoods for the parameters of the
inferred Th17 LEM model. Most of the parameters are identifiable
but the basal transcription and degradation of STAT3 as well as two
STAT3 activating interactions (independent activation mechanisms
by BATF and IRF4) turn out to be practically non-identifiable.
However, this non-identifiability can presumably be avoided
through a simple reparameterization, for instance, with respect to
the degradation rate of STAT3 (for details about reparameteriza-
tion, see e.g. Raue et al., 2013).

All in all, running the LEM model inference for the Th17 RNA-
seq data confirms that the developed methodology provides a very
powerful formalism to analyze regulatory interactions in the pres-
ence of unknown latent processes that effectively correspond to dy-
namical rewiring of the regulatory network structure. The strengths
of our approach are further emphasized when the above results are
compared with the results that are obtained by running the forward-
backward-stepwise selection algorithm for the static Th17 network
(Fig. 6 and Table 4). The analysis with the static network supports
only three experimentally validated interactions and, further, the
model fitting against the time—course data is poor (Fig. 6).

5 Discussion and conclusions

In this study, we introduce a general methodology that enables us to
analyze and predict dynamically evolving regulatory networks using
mechanistic modeling. In the past years, statistical and computa-
tional approaches have been developed to infer dynamically evolv-
ing regulatory networks (see e.g. Dondelinger et al., 2013; Wang

et al., 2014) and, in the context of mechanistic models, methods to
infer input signals simultaneously with system parameters have been
developed (see e.g. Schelker et al., 2012). To our best knowledge,
general mechanistic modeling approaches to infer dynamically
evolving networks do not exist and, consequently, the methodology
that we present in this study is novel.

A central strength of the LEM model inference is that it can eas-
ily be applied to any dataset that is accompanied with some know-
ledge about the mechanistic interactions between the molecular
components. In this sense, the methodology, that we present in this
study, provides us with an out-of—the-box method that can be used
to obtain quantitative predictions about dynamically evolving regu-
latory mechanisms. Further, when applied as a first step analysis
method, the LEM model inference also serves as an excellent start-
ing point for further model refinement and, for instance, for the con-
struction of detailed mathematical or biophysical models. The LEM
model inference is beneficial especially if the molecular system of
interest contains several components and the exhaustive construc-
tion of detailed alternative models for mechanisms driving the dy-
namically evolving network structure is out of reach.

The construction of the LEM model is transparent and the LEM
extension can be applied to virtually any standard (stationary) ODE
model. Even though the modeling approach is fully general, an obvi-
ous challenge in its practical application is the related model ranking
problem over a large set of alternative models (i.e. over different net-
work structures for each latent state). In general, for the case of
standard stationary ODE models, the total number of network
structures is 2]. In the case of the LEM model, the total number of
network structures increases to ZJXM. An exhaustive search over all
possible model configurations can be carried out only for simple toy
systems but this limitation holds both the standard and the LEM
models. In this study, we explore the model space using the forward-
backward-stepwise selection. In practice, the forward-backward-
stepwise selection results in a heuristic search algorithm which
performs well in most cases but, on the other hand, there is no theor-
etical guarantee that the global optimum is always found. The pos-
sible sub-optimality of the search algorithm may be hard to detect,
especially if large networks are considered, and this naturally limits
the practical scalability of the LEM model inference and, as a matter
of fact, constrains also the scalability of the search over standard
ODE model structures. However, the practical scalability can be im-
proved, for instance, by means of probabilistic search algorithms
that explore the model space more efficiently. Thus, there is still
room for further development of the search algorithms that can be
used to calibrate the LEM model but these extensions are out of
scope of this study and we leave them for future studies.

The analysis that we carry out for T helper 17 cell differentiation
combines two major experimental studies that provide information
about the regulatory interactions steering the Th17 lineage commit-
ment. More precisely, we use the experimentally validated static
core network provided by Ciofani et al. (2012) and combine it with
the dynamic view on the regulatory interactions (Yosef et al., 2013)
using our novel methodology. We are the first ones to study the dy-
namically evolving Th17 regulatory network by means of mechanis-
tic modeling and our results are in line with the current
understanding about the detailed biochemical mechanisms. While
our methodology is here tested using the five-gene core Th17 net-
work, the proposed model can also easily be extended and used to
predict novel core genes or regulatory interactions for further ex-
perimental validation.

In summary, the latent effect mechanistic (LEM) model, which
we introduce in this study, provides us with a ﬂexible yet rigorous
means to detect and analyze transient phenomena that affect the
wiring of molecular networks. In addition to introducing this novel
model class, we present a general statistical framework that can be
used to infer the model structure as well as the model parameters.

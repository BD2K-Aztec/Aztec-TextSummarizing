Abstract

Motivation: Analyzing genome wide association data in the context of biological pathways helps us
understand how genetic variation influences phenotype and increases power to find associations.
However, the utility of pathway-based analysis tools is hampered by undercuration and reliance on a
distribution of signal across all of the genes in a pathway. Methods that combine genome wide asso-
ciation results with genetic networks to infer the key phenotype-modulating subnetworks combat the-
se issues, but have primarily been limited to network definitions with yes/no labels for gene-gene in-
teractions. A recent method (EW_deWAS) incorporates a biological network with weighted edge
probability by requiring a secondary phenotype-specific expression dataset. In this paper, we com-
bine an algorithm for weighted-edge module searching and a probabilistic interaction network in order
to develop a method, STAMS, for recovering modules of genes with strong associations to the phe-
notype and probable biologic coherence. Our method builds on EW_deWAS but does not require a
secondary expression dataset and performs better in six test cases.

Results: We show that our algorithm improves over EW_deWAS and standard gene-based analy-
sis by measuring precision and recall of each method on separately identiﬁed associations. In the
Wellcome Trust Rheumatoid Arthritis study, STAMS-identified modules were more enriched for sepa-
rately identified associations than EW_deWAS (STAMS p-value 3.0x10-4; EW_deWAS- p-
value=0.8). We demonstrate that the area under the Precision-Recall curve is 5.9 times higher with
STAMS than EW_deWAS run on the Wellcome Trust Type 1 Diabetes data.

1 Introduction

Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) are chronically under-
powered because they interrogate millions of positions in the genome. In
order to overcome the multiple testing burden, such analyses require
either very large cohorts or a reduced number of tests performed. One
way to reduce the number of tests is to aggregate the genetic information
from the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) level to the gene level,
reducing the number of tests from ~1,000,000 to ~20,000. However, in
cases when it is too expensive or impossible to collect a large sample
(e. g. a very rare phenotype), aggregation to the gene level may not be
enough. Our group (Daneshjou et al., 2014) and others (Compared in
(F ehringer et al., 2012)) have shown that aggregating GWAS to the
pathway level is useful for analyzing underpowered GWAS and ﬁnding
associations between groups of genes and a phenotype. These pathway
methods provide insights into biological function.

The pathway approach has two major shortcomings. First, our present
curation of genes into pathways covers only a small fraction of the genes
that we measure. Second, most of the curated pathways are not designed
to analyze GWAS. For instance, a metabolism pathway may contain
mostly genes with no SNPs (due to stabilizing selection) but also one or
two genes with signiﬁcant variation. All of the genes are important to the
metabolism, and so are considered part of the “pathway,” but only a
couple have GWAS signal. In cases like this, traditional pathway analy-
sis cannot identify the entire pathway as signiﬁcantly associated, because
the noise dilutes the few genes with signal.

“Dense module searching”, originally proposed for expression studies
in 2002 (Ideker et al., 2002), has become a popular analysis method for
analyzing genome-wide measurements. By overlaying gene-based p-
values on a graph of known biological interactions and identifying clus-
ters of connected genes that have an enrichment of signal, dense module
searching isolates clusters of concentrated signal within biologically
related genes. These clusters range in size from two genes to complete
pathway-level associations without requiring predeﬁned pathway lists.
Like traditional pathway analysis techniques, dense module searching
leverages known biological relationships to aggregate measured infor-
mation. Unlike traditional pathway analysis techniques, such as GSEA
(Subramanian et al., 2005; K. Wang et al., 2007), or G0 enrichment
(Ashbumer et al., 2000; Beissbarth and Speed, 2004), dense module
searching identiﬁes clusters of biologically related genes that have the
most enrichment for signal without requiring distribution of signal across
all of the genes in a predeﬁned list.

Several researchers have published improvements to Ideker’s original
algorithm. Nacu et a1 (Nacu et al., 2007) proposed a different search
technique, and made improvements to module scoring including control
for multiple testing. Chuang et a1 (Chuang et al., 2007) presented DMS,
a method that uses a greedy search within a local neighborhood and
incorporates three different kinds of signiﬁcance testing to output mod-
ules. They demonstrate that signiﬁcant modules in breast cancer gene
expression data are better predictors of metastasis than individual mark-
ers. Based on DMS, Jia et a1 (Jia et al., 2010; 2012) built deWAS, the
ﬁrst GWAS-speciﬁc R-based tool that allows users to easily incorporate
dense module searching into their GWAS analysis workﬂow. deWAS
uses a greedy search heuristic that iteratively adds nearby genes to a
module if the p-value of the considered gene improves the aggregate
score by an appreciable amount (r) and is described ﬁirther in sections
2.1.4 and 2.1.5. However, all of these methods are limited to searching
on a network with yes/no edge labels, and therefore prone to error due to
false negative or false positive edges.

Recently published Edge-Weighted_deWAS (EW_deWAS) (Q.
Wang et al., 2015) allows users to input a co-expression matrix in order
to weight edges in the input network before module searching. This is
the ﬁrst time that edge weights have been incorporated into dense mod-
ule searching and allows the user to include information about a) the
strength of evidence that two genes interact and/or b) the strength of the
interaction itself. Wang et. a1. demonstrate that the addition of edge
weight information is valuable by comparing EW_deWAS perfor-
mance on the GAIN schizophrenia GWAS to both standard deWAS
(Jia et al., 2010), and GiGa (Breitling et al., 2004). Although phenotype-
speciﬁc co-expression measurements may not be practical in every
study, and many types of biological relationships are missed in co-
expression analysis of eukaryotes, the expansion of the algorithm to
incorporate edge weights improved performance of their algorithm, and
creates an opportunity for exploring different kinds of gene-gene interac-
tion weighting schemes.

The STRING database (Franceschini et al., 2012) aggregates gene-
gene and protein-protein interactions into a network, with edges scored
for their conﬁdence. STRING combines information from co-expression
analysis, databases such as MIPS (Pagel et al., 2005), high throughput
experiments such as Chromatin Irnmunoprecipitation, phylogenetic co-
occurrence, conservation of the genetic neighborhood (in prokaryotes),
and literature co-occurrence. Associations are assigned a conﬁdence
score based on benchmarking groups of associations against KEGG
(Kanehisa and Goto, 1999) pathways and generally correspond to the
probability of ﬁnding the linked proteins within the same KEGG path.
Although many other networks are available, STRING is notable be-
cause it consolidates many important interaction networks, has edge
conﬁdence scores based on a probabilistic framework, is very popular
with more than 3,000 citations, and is easily usable with R.

In this paper, we present a method, STAMS, which incorporates gen-
eral edge weights such as those provided by STRING, the search tool
from EW_deWAS, and a new signiﬁcance ranking method. STAMS
allows users to use the edge-weighted searching of EW_deWAS with-
out needing co-expression data. The resulting modules have high conﬁ-
dence biological relatedness and strong associations with phenotype. By
leveraging the biological relationships in STRING, STAMS identiﬁes
modules that are more highly replicated in independent studies than
standard analysis with a gene-based p-value or EW_deWAS with a
phenotype-speciﬁc co-expression dataset.

2 Methods
2.1 STAMS

As shown in Figure 1, STAMS uses two kinds of input data: an interac-
tion network with edge conﬁdence scores, and gene-based p-values from
a GWAS or other genome-wide experiment. These two data sources are
integrated into a single graph with both node and edge weights. STAMS
searches for high scoring modules using a greedy search, and then ranks
the modules using a score normalization procedure.

2.1.1 STAMS: Underlying STRING network data

STAMS uses the human STRING database, version 9.1, and the
STRINGdb R-plugin (F ranceschini et al., 2012) as the underlying net-
work. For each run of STAMS, we choose one of the eight edge types
published by STRING. The conﬁdence scores from each of the eight
types are on the interval [0-1000], and generally correlate with the prob-
ability of ﬁnding two genes with that edge type within the same KEGG
pathway. The shape of the distribution varies widely by edge type.

Fig. 1. The workﬂow overview of STAMS. STAMS overlays GWAS gene-based p-
values on a graph of gene-gene interaction conﬁdence scores from the STRING database.
In the resulting graph, circular nodes represent genes with size proportional to l -(p-value)
of the gene’s individual association with the phenotype. Graph edges are edges from the
STRING database. weighted with conﬁdence scores calculated by STRING. Using a
search based on EW_deWAS, STAMS identiﬁes modules of genes that have high

biological coherence and an enrichment of‘GWAS signal.

(1) Neighborhood (31,550 edges): A conﬁdence level based on how
often the two genes are repeatedly in close neighborhood in
prokaryotic genomes. The median conﬁdence is 169; mean
conﬁdence is 181.

(2) Fusion (1,070 edges): A conﬁdence level based on the
number of times that the genes fuse in different spe-
cies. Median conﬁdence is 6; mean conﬁdence is 77.5.

(3) Co-ocurrence: (11,654 edges): A conﬁdence level based on the
number of times the two proteins co-occur in different spe-
cies. Median conﬁdence is 152; mean conﬁdence is 159.

(4) Coexpression (534,720 edges): A conﬁdence level based on
how much the genes are co-expressed across species. Median
conﬁdence is 185; mean conﬁdence is 231.

(5) Experimental (197,709 edges): A conﬁdence level based on pro-
tein interaction data from protein-protein interaction data-
bases, e. g. MIPS. Median conﬁdence is 266; mean conﬁdence
is 349.

(6) Database (126,374 edges): A conﬁdence level based on protein
interaction groups from curated databases, e.g. Reactome
(Croft et al., 2010). Median conﬁdence is 899; mean conﬁ-
dence is 867.

(7) Textmining (text) (1,150,456 edges): A conﬁdence level based
on protein interaction groups extracted from abstracts and
open source full texts of scientiﬁc literature. Median conﬁ-
dence is 201; mean conﬁdence is 244.

(8) Combined Score (CS) (1,684,531 edges): These scores are com-
bined. as if thev are independent data sources:

Conﬁdence(e] = 1000 * (1— [[1:1[1 —c(e,)/1000))

where ci(e) is the conﬁdence level of the edge according to data type i.
Median conﬁdence is 229; mean conﬁdence is 31.9.

2.1.2 STAMS speciﬁc: Edge weights

We transform the conﬁdence levels from STRING into edge weights for
the graph. To easily utilize the EwideWAS search function, we de-
ﬁned edgeweight(e)= (p'](conﬁdence(e) / 1000) where (pl is the inverse
CDF (quantile function) of the normal distribution, resulting in an ap—
proximately standard normal distribution of edge weights.

2.1.3 STAMS specific: Node weights

We transform the gene—level p-values into node weights. In order to
make direct comparisons to EW_deWAS, and to directly apply the
search function from EWideWAS, we deﬁned. nodeweight as node-
weight(v) = (p'](1-p) where p denotes the gene-based p-value of the node
v.

2.1.4 STAMS: Scoring

With the node weights and edge weights as described above, the search-
ing and scoring functions from EW_deWAS were used without altera-
tion. Brieﬂy, the module score is deﬁned by:

2665 edgeweight[e) ZVEV nodeweight[v)

 

 

S 2 it + (1 — x1)
\/No.ofE \/No.ofV

where E and V represent the edges and nodes of the module, and 20 is a
parameter between 0 and 1 that balances edge-weight and GWAS sig-
nals. We used the default permutation-based approach from

EW_de WAS for choosing 2..

2.1.5 STAMS: Searching

We used. the greedy searching function from EWideWAS without

alteration. Brieﬂy:

(1) Assign a seed module M and calculate the module score S(M)
of‘M. Initially, the seed. module is a single gene.

(2) Examine all of the ﬁrst-order neighbors of M, and identify the
neighbor node Nm,1X that generals the maximum increment of
the module score.

(3) Add Nmax to the current module M if the score increment is
greater than S(M) x r, where r is a parameter that decides the
magnitude of the increment. We used r = 0.1.

(4) Repeat steps 1-3 until no more neighbors can be added.

2.1.6 STAMS specific: Normalization of module score

For each module, we calculate a background distribution of 100,000
randomly generated modules by pennuting the node weights. Lambda
and the edge weights remain the same as the observed module. We cal-
culate the mean u and standard. deviation 0' 0f the 100,000 scores. For a
candidate module with score S(M), the normalized score is
SN(M)=(S(M)-u)/o. Modules are ranked by SN. An empirical p-value is
calculated as the fraction of permuted. scores that meet or exceed the
observed score.

2.2 Validation of STAMS

We validated STAMS on six GWAS from the Wellcome Trust Case
Control Consortium ONTCCC) (Burton et al., 2007), and the GAIN
schizophrenia data set.

2.2.1 Calculating gene-level GWAS p-values

SNP p-values for six of the WTCCC GWAS data sets were calculated by
using PLINK (Purcell et al., 2007) to count alleles and then calculating
p-values with built in chi-squared test from R. For the GAIN schizophre-
nia data, SNP p-values from European Americans were downloaded
from dbGAP. Gene-based p-values for all seven data sets were calculat-
ed with VEGAS (Liu et al., 2010) using default settings. VEGAS p-
values are simulation-based, so in cases where VEGAS reported p=0, we
substituted p=1/(number of simulations) which may overestimate some
p-values. The p-values from VEGAS were approximately uniform on the
interval (0,1].

2.2.2 Replication in subsequent studies using knowngenes list

To demonstrate that STAMS identiﬁes genes that have true biological
associations with the phenotype, we tested whether the identiﬁed mod-
ules were enriched for genes with independently identiﬁed associations.
For each phenotype, we downloaded all of the reported phenotype-
speciﬁc gene associations in the genome. gov GWAS catalog, except
those found in the discovery datasets, into a list, denoted as knowngenes.
The catalog contains hits with p-value < 1.0 x 10'5 in the initial + replica-
tion population from English language publications of new GWAS data
measuring at least 100,000 SNPs. Fisher’s exact test was used to meas-
ure enrichment of the genes in the top 1% of STAMS-identiﬁed modules
for genes on the knowngenes list. We calculated Precision (true positives
+ number of STAMS-identiﬁed genes) and Recall (true positives + num-
ber of knowngenes) of STAMS alongside a standard VEGAS + Bonfer-
roni and VEGAS + FDR analyses with corrected p-value $0.05.

2.2.3 Comparison of STAMS and EW_deWAS on six WTCCC
datasets and the GAIN schizophrenia data set

In order to demonstrate the performance improvements in STAMS over
EW_deWAS, we used both methods to analyze seven datasets. We
performed standard EW_deWAS of (Q. Wang et al., 2015), software
version 3.0, dated 10/4/2014) with phenotype-speciﬁc expression da-
tasets for type 1 diabetes (T1D), bipolar disorder (BD), rheumatoid ar-
thritis (RA), coronary artery disease (CAD), type 2 diabetes (T2D),
hypertension (HT), and the GAIN schizophrenia data (SCZ). See Sup-
plemental Methods.

2.2.4 Precision and Recall of STAMS and EW_deWAS in re-
duced datasets

To demonstrate the performance of STAMS with under-powered da-
tasets, we created datasets using the full control samples and varied the
percentage of case patients by randomly selecting 20-100% of the cases
each time in 20% increments (non-progressively). We compared the
Precision/Recall curves of STAMS performed on these lower-powered
datasets to the curve generated by using the ﬁill data set. The gold stand-
ard in this analysis was the list of genes that met genome-wide signiﬁ-
cance in the ﬁill dataset.

2.3 Application of STAMS to autism fGWAS

We analyzed an autism GWAS with STAMS. The cohort consisted of
654 probands from the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE) and
1,593 unselected controls from the iControl data set, both genotyped on
the Illumina HumanHap550v3. (The data selection criteria are described
ﬁirther in (Geschwind et al., 2001)). The data (AGRE/iControl) were
restricted to 1,945 individuals of western European decent based on
results from multidimensional scaling conducted using PLINK. SNPs
with Minor Allele Frequency GVIAF) < 0.01, Hardy-Weinberg Equilibri-
um (HWE) p-values < 0.001, genotype missingness > 0.02, and differen-
tial missingness between cases and controls > 0.01 were excluded. After
these quality control measures, 511,483 SNPs remained. We imputed
with HapMAP3 R2 Build 36 and MACHvl, resulting in a total of 1.38M
SNPs.

For each SNP, we did a logistic regression with the genotype and the
top four principal components as covariates. We constructed gene-level
annotations that included expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) pre-
viously identiﬁed in the parietal cortex (GSE35978) and the cerebellum
(GSE35978) as well as coding variants (nonsense, frameshift, and mis-
sense) within the gene. The p-values for each SNP from its regression
were ﬁltered based on their ﬁlﬂCthIl—CQTLS, nonsense, missense, and
frameshift SNPs were included and all other SNPs were dropped from
the model. For each gene, the test statistic Y was calculated as:

L
Y= 2,11%pr

where L is number of SNPs that are annotated to the gene. To control for
Linkage Disequilibrium, we permuted the phenotype labels in order to
generate an empirical null distribution for the test statistic. Empirical
gene-level p-values were then obtained by calculating the proportion of
test statistics from the null distribution that met or exceeded the test
statistic from the associated set of results. These p-values were the input
to the STAMS algorithm.

3 Results

Figure 2 demonstrates that STAMS identiﬁes modules with better en-
richment for knowngenes than EW_deWAS. We analyzed six Well-
come Trust datasets and the GAIN schizophrenia dataset with STAMS
and EW_deWAS. Figure 2 compares the negative log of the p-value
for Fisher’s exact tests of modules for enrichment with independently
identiﬁed knowngenes for the six phenotypes with signal. Neither
STAMS nor EW_deWAS identiﬁed modules with enrichment for
knowngenes in the HT dataset. Since Wang et. a1. (Q. Wang et al., 2015)
suggest using the top 1% of modules returned by EW_deWAS for
ﬁirther study, we compared the top 1% of modules returned by each
method. In all six phenotypes with signal, the Textmining edge set with
STAMS gave the best enrichment, followed by the Combined Score
edge set with STAMS. The other six edge modalities in STRING did not
perform as well, and are compared in Figure 5. We also ran
EW_deWAS using the PINA interaction network on the schizophrenia
data as described in Wang et. al., and the results were substantially con-
sistent with the EW_deWAS + STRING results presented here.

Figure 3 plots precision and recall of STAMS with the Textmining
edge set against knowngenes alongside EW_deWAS, a standard gene-
based test (VEGAS) with Bonferroni correction, and VEGAS with an
FDR correction. STAMS and EW_deWAS parameters (number of
considered modules) were set such that their precision roughly matches

ules; EW_deWAS is plotted with 25 top modules. STAMS with
Textmining edges has universally better performance than
EW_deWAS, and in two phenotypes has better performance than
standard gene-based analyses. We present the Precision/Recall for a
corrected p-value of 0.05 because it is a commonly used cutoff in the
literature. See Supplemental Figure 2 for the ﬁill Precision/Recall curves.

In BD with 75 modules, STAMS identiﬁed 12 knowngenes that were
not individually signiﬁcant. These genes include two small clusters of
STRING-connected genes (GLT8D1, SPCSl, NDUFABl; ITIH3,
ITIHl, HNRNPC, NEK4, CACNAlC, PBRMl). The remaining genes
were not connected to other knowngenes. In T2D, STAMS identiﬁed 11
knowngenes that were not individually signiﬁcant. Nine of them were
connected to each other in STRING (ZFAND6, ZBED3, IGF2BP2,
HHEX, FTO, TSPAN8, CSKN2B, CDKALl, HNFlB).

Fig. 4. Precision-Recall curves of STAMS performance across varying numbers of
modules and sample sizes. We used the list of genes identiﬁed by VEGAS with a Bon-
ferroni correction in the full dataset as a gold standard and calculated precision-recall
curves for our ability to recover these genes with a reduced sample size by varying the
number of top modules considered. We randomly selected subpopulations of patients to
include and show that performance of STAMS with Combined Score edges decreases
when fewer patients are included. We also ran EW_deWAS with expression data for
edge weights, and show its performance. (A) shows results for Rheumatoid Arthritis 01A)
and 03) shows results for Type 1 Diabetes (T1D).

Figure 4 demonstrates that STAMS with Textmining edges recovers
more of the genome-wide signiﬁcant genes in the original dataset than
EW_deWAS, even when using only 20% of the patient’s data. It also
shows that STAMS performance is maintained in a reduced sample size.
Performance of STAMS on T1D is better than on RA due to the strong
edge weights between genes in the HLA region, many of which have
known T1D associations.

Figure 5 shows the variability in performance of STAMS across six
WTCCC disorders and different types of edge sets from STRING. The
Experimental, Database, Textmining, and Combined Score edge sets are
heavily enriched for knowngenes while the Fusion edges, which are
based on the number of times that two genes fuse across species, are not.
Many edge types perform well on T1D, while none perform well for
Hypertension.

Figure 6 shows a top-scoring module from the AGRE autism fGWAS.
The module includes an individually non-signiﬁcant gene, CTTNBP2
(gene-based p-value=0.2) with known rare-variant autism associations.
The other genes in this module are part of the STRIPAK complex.
CTTNBP2 and STRIPAK interact to regulate dendritic spinogenesis.
This module was chosen for discussion because it is the best scoring
module (rank = 91) that contains a gene from the high conﬁdence rare-
variant associations in (DeRubeis et al 2014). Its empirical p-value based
on 1 million node-label permutations is 0.001905.

Normalization improves module selection

The normalization ﬁinction described in Methods 2.1.6 improves module
detection. As shown in Supplemental Figure 1, the STAMS normaliza-
tion function identiﬁes modules that are more enriched for knowngenes
than either the EW_deWAS normalization ﬁinction, or ranking the
output modules by the raw scores.

width corresponds to Combined Score edge conﬁdence, but are all very high conﬁdence
(z-scores range from 1.43 to 3.09). The module contains CTTNBP2; rare loss of ﬁmction
mutations in CTTNBP2 have been associated with autism. The other genes in the module
are members of the STRIPAK complex. CTTNBP2 interacts with STRIPAK to regulate

dendritic spinogensis, a proposed mechanism for autism.

4 Discussion

In this paper, we show that using the multimodal edge weights from
the STRING database improves the performance of EW_deWAS
while eliminating the need for a secondary phenotype-speciﬁc expres-
sion dataset. We demonstrate this improved performance in several
ways. We compare STAMS performance to EW_deWAS on two gold
standards: genes that were identiﬁed in independent studies

(knowngenes) and genes that were individually signiﬁcant in the full
dataset. We show that STAMS demonstrates high precision and recall on
knowngenes and recovers more of the disease genes even with only 20%
of the patients as input data.

The results from all GWAS analysis techniques are dataset dependent.
We presented results on seven datasets in order to demonstrate the range
of STAMS performance across varying levels of signal. In all datasets
(excluding low-signal Hypertension), STAMS performs better than
EW_deWAS. In two out of ﬁve WTCCC GWAS, STAMS has nota-
bly better performance than a gene-based test with a Bonferroni correc-
tion. For T1D, the recall of STAMS is better than the recall of VEGAS
with a Bonferroni correction, but lower than recall of VEGAS with an
FDR correction. In Bipolar Disorder and Type 2 Diabetes, STAMS has
dramatically better precision and recall than either gene-based test. In
RA and Coronary Artery Disease, the performance of STAMS and the
gene-based tests are comparable.

In BD and T2D, where STAMS identiﬁed genes that standard analysis
techniques missed, the genes were found clustered together. The im-
provement of recall by STAMS shows that the addition of interaction
data identiﬁes genes that would otherwise be missed in an underpowered
study, even though they are true associations. The improvement of preci-
sion demonstrates that the genes that belong to clusters of biologically
related high-scoring genes are more likely to be validated in independent
studies than genes that have individual genome-wide signiﬁcance in a
single study.

When we examine STAMS and EW_deWAS precision and recall
on the genes that were individually genome-wide signiﬁcant in the ﬁill
dataset, we predictably see that both methods fail to recover some of the
individually signiﬁcant hits. Both methods rely on strong gene-gene
interactions to identify modules, so neither method detects genes that
have strong individual signal but no neighbors with good p-values,
which are detectable by single-gene based tests. However, STAMS
maintains nearly ﬁill levels of precision and recall even with fewer pa-
tients included. As the p-values for genes (based on patient data) become
less signiﬁcant, the edge weights from STRING remain constant, stabi-
lizing STAMS performance in the reduced power datasets. In Type 1
Diabetes, the strong edge weights between members of the HLA region
allows STAMS to perform well on only 20% of the patient data. Perfor-
mance of STAMS on the reduced-power datasets from Rheumatoid
Arthritis shows nearly full precision and recall using 60% (n=1116 cas-
es) or more of the patient data. These data indicate the utility of STAMS
to rescue important gene associations that would otherwise be missed
due to lack of power. Finding ways to increase power without requiring
larger sample sizes is mandatory in some cases. For instance, in some
rare drug events and populations, researchers have collected every
known example, and are still underpowered to ﬁnd associations. By
demonstrating that STAMS has high precision and recall of signiﬁcant
genes even as less and less input data are used, we have demonstrated its
utility for identifying candidate genes in a small GWAS.

When comparing the performance of STAMS using different types of
edges, we ﬁnd that edges created from Textmining give the best perfor-
mance on the knowngenes in four out of the six WTCCC phenotypes.
However, STAMS on the Combined Score edges outperforms the
Textmining edges on Precision/Recall of individually signiﬁcant genes
(Combined Score shown in Figure 4, Textmining data not shown). We
suspect that this is due to the greater number of edges in the Combined
Score set than the Textmining set, which allows more genes to be identi-
ﬁed. Unlike the knowngenes validation list, the individually signiﬁcant
genes may or may not be replicated in other studies. Many of the edge
modalities (Fusion, Co-expression, Co-occurance, Neighborhood) had

poor performance across phenotypes. We were not surprised to learn that
these edges, based on prokaryotic features or cross-species features, were
less useﬁil than the edge-sets created from eukaryotic protein-protein
interaction databases (Experimental, Database). We tried combining
some of the top-performing edge modalities into new edge scores, but
the results were not better than Textmining alone. We recommend that
researchers use the Textmining and/or Combined Score edge modalities.

Notably, the STAMS performance correlates with number of edges
included in a modality. As shown in Figure 5, the best performing edge
modalities are the ones that contain the most edges. In Supplemental
Figure 4, we illustrate STAMS performance as edges are randomly
dropped or added to the input graph. Although performance drops as
edges are removed, STAMS performance is not as sensitive to the added
edges, indicating that it is robust to false-positive gene-gene links.

The utility of the Textmining based edges to ﬁnd replicable results
demonstrates the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) for
curating biomedical knowledge. The edges currently in STRING are
based on two genes or proteins co-occurring in PubMed abstracts or
open- source articles. As NLP techniques improve to include sentence
parsing and modeling of more complicated gene-gene relationships, this
edge set will get less noisy and identifying modules based on it will
improve.

We should acknowledge that the publications mined could include
those about the GWAS that we used for validation or candidate gene
studies based on the initial WTCCC results. These papers may have
listed the GWAS hits or candidate genes listed in the abstract, thus creat-
ing links between the hits in the STRING database. With those links, the
modules containing the GWAS hits are easier to ﬁnd. However, given
the large corpus of PubMed abstracts, and the normalization calculations
in STRING, we suspect that the contamination by publications about our
validation set is very small.

We improved on the signiﬁcance testing and module-ranking algo-
rithm of EW_deWAS by considering permutations of node weights
over a ﬁxed network topology. With randomly selected network topolo-
gy and connectivity used in permutations as EW_deWAS does, the
background scores are almost certame underestimated since they may
not have connecting edges at all. By keeping the edges ﬁxed, we focus
on whether the weights of the nodes in the module are signiﬁcant. Alt-
hough we ranked the modules differently, we agree with the authors of
EW_deWAS that selecting the top 1% of modules for ﬁirther investi-
gation, although seemingly arbitrary, works well in practice. This was
demonstrated by our validation against independently associated GWAS
hits. However, because there are several ways to measure signiﬁcance
for dense modules, we do not rely heavily on the calculated p-value.
With only summary statistics rather than genotype data, the p-values
calculated in neither STAMS nor EW_deWAS measure how associat-
ed the module is with the phenotype. Instead, the current implementa-
tions measure how densely clustered the high-scoring genes are in the
network. In order to get a more complete picture of signiﬁcance, one
would have to permute the case/control labels on the GWAS data and
redo the searching under those permutations to create a null distribution.
We suggest that users use the p-value to rank modules and identify can-
didate modules for follow up study through permutation of case/control
labels, or orthogonal biological methods.

In our application to autism, we show that analyzing a common-
variant GWAS with STAMS identiﬁes a module with a known rare-
variant association, demonstrating the power of STAMS to converge on
true biological associations. Rare loss of ﬁinction mutations in
CTTNBP2, also known as CORTBP2, have been associated with autism

(Cheung et al., 2001; Sanders et al., 2015) but have not been reported in
common-variant autism GWAS to date. The module also has overlap-
ping genes with other gene groups presented in the autism literature. Six
of the genes overlap with neocortical development coexpression modules
from Parikshak et. a1. (PPP2R5C, PPP2CB are M4; CTTNBP2 is M2;
TCP1 and CCT6A are in M14; PPP2R2C is in M16) (Parikshak et al.,
2013). Additionally, PP2R1A was also classiﬁed by Hormozdiari et. a1.
and as being part of two modules which are enriched for de novo mRNA
mutations in autistic probands, Epilepsy and “M3: Extended autism
spectrum disorder and intellectual disability” (Hormozdiari et al., 2010).
None of the genes in the module overlap with the copy number variation
modules identiﬁed by the NETBAG method of Gilman et. a1. (Gilman et
al., 2011).

Many of the edges in the identiﬁed autism module come from the
STRIPAK complex described by Goudreault et a1 (Goudreault et al.,
2008). They used an iterative afﬁnity puriﬁcation/mass spectrometry
approach to characterize the diversity of protein phosphotase 2A 03P2A)
complexes. The protein products of PPP2R1A, PPP2R1B, STRN,
PPP2R5C, PPP2CB, PPP2R2C, CCT6A, and TCP1 are all components
of the STRIPAK assembly. STRIPAK interacts with CTTNBP2, which
targets the assembly to dendritic spines and where it regulates dendritic
spinogenesis. Since CTTNBP2’s association with autism may be ex-
plained by problems in the regulation of dendritic spinogenesis (Chen et
al., 2012), it follows that mutations in members of the STRIPAK com-
plex, which is also part of this process, may be associated with autism
through the same mechanism. STAMS reveals meaningﬁil association of
the STRIPAK complex and this possible mechanism for autism by ana-
lyzing the GWAS data within its biological context.

STAMS is limited by the underlying search mechanisms presented in
EW_deWAS. Notably, the search is entirely greedy, which means that
genes with small contributions to the score have no chance of being
added to a module, even if they provide a link to a higher-scoring gene.
Several other dense module-searching methods exist which incorporate
non-greedy searching (Nacu et al., 2007; Ideker et al., 2002; Q. Wang et
al., 2015) and the expansion of a non-greedy search method to include
edge weighting would likely outperform STAMS in some cases.

STAMS, like other gene-based methods, is also limited by including
only SNPs that are mapped to genes. In our application to autism, we
incorporated SNPs that are known eQTLs for genes into the gene-based
score, but there are still many measured SNPs for which data are ig-
nored. Expanding gene deﬁnitions to include more intragenic SNPs may
help. However, some individual SNPs and genes will remain undiscov-
erable by STAMS, so we recommend running STAMS as a complement
to SNP-based and gene-based analysis techniques.

Our validation method, which uses genes from independent GWAS
that have SNP that meets a cutoff of p-value < 1.0 x 10'5 in the initial +
replication population is more relaxed than most genome-wide SNP
signiﬁcance criteria. While 1.0 x 10'5 is a reasonable cutoff for a gene-
based test, the results might change with a stricter validation list based
on a p-value < 1.0 x 10'8 cutoff, which is more typical of a SNP study.

There may be ways to improve these edge sets by making them more
phenotype or tissue speciﬁc. For instance, augmenting the base STRING
edge set with extra edges from phenotype-speciﬁc co-expression data, or
up-weighting edges in STRING that have phenotype- or tissue-speciﬁc
expression may increase performance. With the evaluation framework
that we present in this paper, one could determine whether this kind of
added information is useﬁil.

Understanding GWAS hits in the context of their biological interac-
tions gives insight into mechanism of action. However, most dense mod-

ule searching approaches rely on yes/no edge classiﬁcation, which cre-
ates errors due to arbitrary cutoffs for edge scores. As shown by compar-
ison to their older binary edge algorithm, the inclusion of edge weights
into the search algorithm of EW_deWAS eliminates these errors and
makes the algorithm more robust. We have shown that using the
STRING conﬁdence scores, along with appropriate changes to score
normalization, improves the performance of deWAS even further. We
provide an R-package, STAMS, that integrates the STRINGdb package,
the EW_deWAS search ﬁinction, and the STAMS-speciﬁc score
normalization and allows users to easily perform this analysis on their
gene-based p-values with the edge types of their choosing. We are also
happy to share our reusable validation and evaluation suite. This suite
represents the ﬁrst systematic way to evaluate and compare dense mod-
ule searching methods and parameter choices across a range of GWAS.

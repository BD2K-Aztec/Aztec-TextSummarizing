ABSTRACT

Motivation: Many studies have investigated the relationship between
structural properties and dynamic behaviors in biological networks. In
particular, feedback loop (FBL) and feedforward loop (FFL) structures
have received a great deal of attention. One interesting and common
property of FBL and FFL structures is their coherency of coupling.
However, the role of coherent FFLs in relation to network robustness
is not fully known, whereas that of coherent FBLs has been well
established.

Results: To establish that coherent FFLs are abundant in biological
networks, we examined gene regulatory and signaling networks and
found that FFLs are ubiquitous, and are in a coherently coupled form.
This result was also observed in the species-based signaling networks
that are integrated from KEGG database. By using a random Boolean
network model, we demonstrated that these coherent FFLs can
improve network robustness against update-rule perturbations. In par-
ticular, we found that coherent FFLs increase robustness because
these structures induce downstream nodes to be robust against
update-rule perturbations. Therefore, coherent FFLs can be con-
sidered as a design principle of human signaling networks that
improve network robustness against update-rule perturbations.

1 INTRODUCTION

Cellular dynamics are largely controlled by various topological
motifs included in large-scale biological networks, which are rep-
resented by a huge number of interactions among biological
components, such as genes, proteins, miRNAs and other small
molecules (Klein et al., 2012). One of these topological motifs is a
feedback loop (FBL) structure, and its effects on dynamics have
been widely investigated. For example, it was shown that more
robust networks tend to have larger numbers of positive FBLs
and smaller numbers of negative FBLs (Kwon and Cho, 2008b),
and the number of FBLs involving a node is positively correlated
with the functional importance of the node (Kwon et al., 2007).
It was also shown that two diseases are more likely to be comor-
bid if the genes associated with each disease are connected with
FBLs of a relatively short length in a human signaling network

(Le and Kwon, 2011a). These observations were validated as a
design principle of biological networks through extensive simu-
lations based on computational models. In addition, the role of
FBLs was also investigated in some speciﬁc biological processes.
For example, interlinked fast and slow positive FBLs drive reli-
able cell decisions (Brandman et al., 2005), interlinked positive
and negative FBLs sustain the robustness of biological oscilla-
tion (Tsai et al., 2008) and FBLs play important role in modulat-
ing p53 pathway in individual cells (Harris and Levine, 2005;
Lahav et al., 2004). Another well-known motif is the feedforward
loop (FFL) structure that has also been investigated for its effects
on network dynamics. For example, speciﬁc FFLs are needed for
robust carbohydrate uptake in Escherichia coli (Kremling et al.,
2008), as well as for adaptation to variations in the critical mor-
phogen level where cell fate is switched (Rodrigo and Elena,
2011). In addition, a simple FFL motif composed of three
genes was capable of processing external signals robustly
(Macia et al., 2009), and the degree to which an FFL consisting
of three positive transcriptional regulators was sensitive to pri-
mary level perturbation was related to the robustness (Hayot and
Jayaprakash, 2005).

One interesting structural property common to FBLs and
FFLs is coherent coupling. When a pair of FBLs or FFLs of
the same sign is coupled, this is called a coherent coupling (see
Fig. 1 for an illustrative example). Some previous studies have
shown that an individual coherent structure can play an import-
ant role in the dynamic behavior of biological networks. For
example, Mangan et al. (2003) showed that a coherent FFL
serves as a sign-sensitive delay element in transcription networks,
and Kalir et al. (2005) showed that a coherent FFL prolongs
ﬂagella expression in Escherichia coli. On the other hand, Kim
et al. (2008) showed that a coupled positive FBL enhances signal
ampliﬁcation and bi-stable characteristics, whereas a coupled
negative FBL realize enhanced homeostasis. In particular, we
note a previous study that showed that coherently coupled
FBLs can be a design principle in a human signaling network,
as they make the network more robust (Kwon and Cho, 2008a).
This result led us to question about whether the coherent FFL is
also an important design principle for robustness-related dy-
namics, like the coherent FBLs in biological networks. Thus,
in this study, we investigate the relationship between robust-
ness-related dynamics and the coherent FFL structure through
extensive simulations. A biological network such as a gene regu-
latory or signaling network can be represented by computational
models. Among them, the Boolean network model (Glass and
Kauffman, 1973; Kauffman, 1993) can be used to analyze the

structures. When a pair of FBLs or FFLs of the same (different) sign is

complex dynamics of biological networks because it provides the
most simpliﬁed representation for the network state (Bornholdt,
2005; Kauffman et al., 2003, 2004; Kwon and Cho, 2008b; Le
and Kwon, 2011a; Shmulevich et al., 2005). Thus, we used the
Boolean network model for the dynamics analysis.

Before examining how the dynamics are related to the coher-
ent FFLs, we ﬁrst showed that FFLs are ubiquitously found in
gene regulatory and signaling networks and further, that they are
more likely to form a coherent structure than randomly expected.
In addition, we examined a large set of signaling networks of
1008 species integrated from the KEGG pathway database
(Kanehisa and Goto, 2000) and showed that there is a larger
number of coherent FFLs than randomly expected in each of
1001 species. In other words, coherent FFLs are frequently
observed motifs in biological networks. To unravel the role of
these coherent FFLs, we examined the robustness against
initial-state or update-rule perturbations through the Boolean
network model. To this end, two groups of random networks
were generated and classiﬁed according to the degree of coher-
ency of the FFLs. Through extensive simulations, we observed
that the networks with relatively high coherency of FFLs are
more robust against update-rule perturbations than those with
relatively low coherency of FFLs, whereas there is little differ-
ence between them in terms of robustness against initial-state
perturbations. In addition, we found that coherent FFLs can
make downstream nodes robust against update-rule perturb-
ations, and this induces the difference in robustness against
update-rule perturbations. In summary, coherent FFLs seem to
be a design principle to efﬁciently sustain robust behavior against
update-rule perturbations in biological networks.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Biological networks dataset

To investigate the distributions of coherent FFLs, we used four relatively
small-scale gene regulatory networks and two large-scale signaling net-
works. In addition, we used the species-based signaling pathways in the
KEGG database.

Gene regulatory networks: We collected four gene regulatory networks
based on the literature: (i) Arabidopsis morphogenesis regulatory net-
work (AMRN) with 10 nodes and 22 links (Mendoza et al., 1999); (ii)
a yeast cell cycle network (YCCN) with 11 nodes and 34 links (Li et al.,
2004); (iii) a mammalian cell cycle network (MCCN) with 10 nodes and
34 links (Faure et al., 2006); and (iv) Arabidopsis ﬂoral organ fate deter-
mination gene network (AFDN) with 15 nodes and 37 links
(Espinosa-Soto et al., 2004). All of these networks were shown to be
robust against some external or internal perturbations. For instance,
AMRN was shown to robustly control the process of ﬂower development
(Mendoza et al., 1999). In addition, it was shown that AFDN has a robust
developmental module (Espinosa—Soto et al., 2004), and YCCN is ro-
bustly designed against mutations (Li et al., 2004).

Signaling networks: Two large-scale signaling networks were collected
based on the literature: (i) a human signaling network (HSN) including
1539 nodes and 4754 interactions (Cui et al., 2009) and (ii) a canonical
signaling network (CSN) including 818 nodes and 1801 links (Kwon and
Cho, 2008a). To analyze a large set of signaling networks, we collected
signaling pathways from the KEGG (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000), con-
taining pathways of 1574 species. After extracting only the activation and
inhibition interactions from the pathways and integrating them for each
species, we ultimately found 1008 species containing at least one FFL of
length 2 (see Supplementary Table S1).

2.2 A random Boolean network model

A Boolean network is represented by a directed graph G( V, A), where Vis
a set of Boolean variables, and A is a set of ordered pairs of the Boolean
variables called directed links. Each v,- e V has a value of 1 (‘on’) or 0
(‘off’), which represents the possible states of the corresponding elements.
For example, the values 1 and 0 represent the ‘turn—on’ and ‘turn-off’
statuses, respectively. A directed link (v,, v], t) represents a positive (acti-
vating) or negative (inhibiting) relationship from v,- to vj- by setting I to 1
or —1, respectively. The value of each variable v,- at time t+ 1 is deter-
mined by the values of k,- other variables vi, , viz, ..., Viki with a link to v,- at
time t by the Boolean update function f, : {0, 1}ki —> {0, 1}. All the vari-
ables are synchronously updated. Hence, the update rule can be written as
v,(t + 1) = f,~(v,1 (t), vi, (t), ..., viki(t)) where we randomly select either a
logical conjunction or disjunction in f,- with a uniform probability distri-
bution. For example, if a Boolean variable v has a positive relationship
with v1, a negative relationship with 122, and a positive relationship with
123, then the conjunction and disjunction update rules are
v(t + 1) = v1(t) /\ 172 (t) /\ V3(t) and v(t + 1) = v1(t) V 172(t) V V3(t),
respectively. In the case of a conjunction, the value of v at time t+1 is
1 only if the values of v1, v2 and v3 at time t are 1, 0 and 1, respectively.
Meanwhile, in the case of a disjunction, the value of v at time t+ 1 is 1 if
at least one of the states of the clauses, v1(t), 172(t) and v3(t) is 1. In
previous studies, biological networks such as signaling and gene regula-
tory networks were successfully described with Boolean network models
using only conjunction or disjunction update-rules (Albert, 2004; Faure
et al., 2006; Huang and Ingber, 2000; Kwon and Cho, 2007).

Many studies have been performed to elucidate the dynamic behaviors
of biological networks. These dynamic behaviors include noise propaga-
tion and signaling sensitivity (Hornung and Barkai, 2008), robustness and
fragility (Kwon and Cho, 2008b) and cross-talk (Siso-Nadal et al., 2009).
In this study, we focus on converging dynamics. In particular, we address
robustness against perturbations in terms of Boolean dynamics. Given a
Boolean network G(V, A) with V: {V1, v2, . . . , vN}, a state of G is deﬁned
as a vector of values v1 through vN. A state trajectory starts from an initial
state and eventually converges to either a ﬁxed-point or limit-cycle at-
tractor. These attractors can represent diverse biological network behav-
iors such as multi—stability, homeostasis and oscillation (Bhalla et al.,
2002; Ferrell and Machleder, 1998; Pomerening et al., 2003). Based on
the deﬁnition of the attractor, we can introduce the notion of robustness
in terms of converging dynamics. If a network sustains the converged

attractor against a perturbation, it is called robust against the perturb-
ation. This concept has been widely used (Ciliberti et al., 2007; Huang
et al., 2005; Kitano, 2004a, b; Li et al., 2004). Here, we considered two
types of perturbations: an initial-state perturbation and an updating-rule
perturbation. Given a Boolean network G(V, A), a set of update-rules
F: {fl,f2, . . . ,fN} and an initial state s: [121(0), 122(0),. . . , vN(0)] at t: 0,
an initial-state perturbation subject to a node vie V represents a situation
in which s is mutated to s’= [121(0), . . . , 1-v,(0), . . . , vN(0)], i.e. the corres-
ponding initial value is switched to 17,-(0) [the negation of v,(0)]. An
initial-state perturbation represents the abnormal (or malfunctioning)
status of a protein or gene caused by a mutation. On the other hand,
an update-rule perturbation subject to a node 12,-EV involves a mutation
where F is changed to F = {fl, . . . ,f,-,’, . . . ,fN}, where f,’ is the disjunction
rule if f,- is the conjunction rule and vice versa. The update-rule perturb-
ation may represent a change of a relationship between nodes. For a set
of considered initial states S, we now deﬁne the robustness of a node v,-
against the initial-state perturbation and the update-rule perturbation,
denoted by ys(v,-) and y,(v,-), respectively, as follows:

2 I(Ol(S, G, F) = ot(s’, G, F))
565
IS I

 

l/S(Vi) =

and

Z I(Ol(S, G, P) = Ol(S, G, F’))
yr(Vi) : seS  ,

 

where a(s, G, P) represents the attractor to which s will converge in a
Boolean network G speciﬁed by the set of update-rules F, and I(c0nditi0n)
denotes an indicator function that returns 1 if the condition is true and 0
otherwise. In other words, ys(v,-) and y,(v,-) represent the probability with
which a network sustains the converging attractor against the initial-state
and update-rule perturbations, respectively. In addition, a node v whose
ys(v) or y,(v) is <1 is called a nonrobust node against the initial-state or
the update-rule perturbation. Furthermore, the robustness of a network
G against the initial-state perturbation and the update-rule perturbation,
denoted by ys(G) and y,(G), respectively, are deﬁned as follows:

2 r30) 2 n0)

SGZVEV and erveV
r() M r() M

 

 

In other words, the robustness of a network is computed by averaging the
robustness of all nodes in the network.

To perform extensive simulations over a number of random Boolean
networks, we used two random network generation models: a Barabasi—
Albert model (BA; Barabasi and Albert, 1999), and a variant model (ER)
of an Erdés—Rényi model (Erdos and Rényi, 1959). These models have
been widely used to discover design principles of biological networks
(Kwon et al., 2007; Kwon and Cho, 2008a, b; Le and Kwon, 2011a, b)
[refer to our previous study (Le and Kwon, 2011b) for pseudo-codes to
calculate ys(v), yr(v), ys(G), y,(G) and to generate random networks based
on BA and ER models].

2.3 Feedforward loops

A feedforward loop is an important motif in network dynamics (Dongsan
et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2009; Zecca and Struhl, 2010). Given a network
G(V, A), a sequence of nodes w; —> w, —> ...—> wL_1 —> wL is a simple
path of length L(31), if there exist links from w,_1 to w,- [i.e. (w,_1, w,)eA
Vi: 1, 2,. .., L], with wﬂé wk forj, ke{0, 1,. . . , L}. The sign ofa simple
path is determined by the parity of the number of negative links involved.
If the parity number is even or zero, the path is positive, otherwise, it is
negative. When there are two or more simple paths from a source node
(12,) and a target node (vj) without any common intermediate node be-
tween those paths except v, and v], the set of the simple paths is called an
FFL starting from v,- and ending at v]. Furthermore, an FFL is coherent if

all simple paths involved have the same sign, otherwise, it is incoherent. In
this work, we only consider FFLs of length two (i.e. the paths connecting
a source and a target node have length less than or equal to two). We also
deﬁne NuFFL of G( V, E) as the number of FFLs found in the network. In
other words, it represents the number of pairs of (veG, weG) such that
there exists an FFL from v to w. Similarly, NuCoFFL and NuInCoFFL of
G( V, E) represent the number of coherent and incoherent FFLs found in
the network, respectively. In addition, NuCoFFL(v) and NuInCoFFL(v)
for a node veV denote the number of coherent and incoherent FFLs
involving the node v, respectively.

Let us consider an FFL consisting of M ( Z 2) different paths connect-
ing a source (vi) and a target node (vj) of lengths L1, L2, . . ., and LM.
Assuming that a path is speciﬁed as being negative or positive independ-
ently and uniformly at random, the probability with which the FFL
is coherent or incoherent is 2/2M or (2M—2)/2M, respectively. Then,
the randomly expected ratio of coherent FFLs in a network with
N FFLs consisting of M1, M2, . . . , M N paths can be deﬁned as

3 RESULTS

3.1 Ubiquitousness of FFLs and their coherency in real
biological networks

We ﬁrst examined how frequently FFLs are found in the real
biological networks. To this end, we compared NuFFLs of the
real biological networks with those of random networks gener-
ated by shufﬂing the direction and the sign of every interaction
from the real biological networks. More speciﬁcally, for a given
real biological network represented by G{ V, A ), a shufﬂed
random network was obtained by replacing each interaction
(v,-, v], t)€A with one of (v,-, v], t), (v,-, v], —‘E), (vj, v,-, t)
and (vj, v,, —‘E) uniformly at random. In this way, we generated
1000 shufﬂed random networks for each of the four
gene-regulatory (AMRN, YCCN, MCCN and AFDN) and
two signaling networks (HSN and CSN). Figure 2 shows
that NuFFLs of HSN and AMRN are signiﬁcantly larger than
those of the shufﬂed random networks (using one-sample t—test,
all P—values< 10‘7). Similar results were also observed for other
signaling (CSN) and gene-regulatory (YCCN, MCCN and
AFDN) networks (see Supplementary Fig. S1). This indicates
that FFLs are ubiquitous in real biological networks. Second,
we examined how predominantly FFLs are coherently organized.
To this end, we compared the ratio of NuCoFFL to NuFFL
in two real biological networks, HSN and AMRN, with that
in the shufﬂed random networks (Fig. 3). The ratio of both
HSN and AMRN is signiﬁcantly greater than that of the shufﬂed
networks (using one-sample t-test, all P—values < 10‘196). In add-
ition, the ratio of NuCoFFL to NuFFL in the real biological
networks is larger than the randomly expected ratio of coherent
FFLs (see Materials and Methods for the deﬁnition of the
randomly expected ratio of coherent FFLs). Similar results
are observed for other signaling (CSN) and gene-regulatory
networks (YCCN, MCCN and AFDN) (see Supplementary
Fig. S2).

We further investigated degree of coherency of FFLs in 1008
species-based signaling networks integrated from the KEGG sig-
naling pathway database (see Materials and Methods section).
For each signaling network, we calculated the ratio of NuCoFFL
to NuFFL and the randomly expected ratio of coherent FFLs
(Fig. 4). Intriguingly, the ratio of NuCoFFL to NuFFL is greater

signiﬁcantly larger than that of the shufﬂed networks. (The average
and standard deviation of NuFFL are 4485.29 and 76.4, respectively.)
(b) Results of AMRN. NuFFL of AMRN (15) is signiﬁcantly larger
than that of the shufﬂed networks. (The average and standard deviation
of NuFFL are 9.85 and 2.56, respectively.) In each subﬁgure, 1000
shufﬂed networks were generated

than the randomly expected ratio in 1001 cases of signaling net-
works (see Supplementary Table S1). Similar results were
observed for individual pathways. For example, there were 100
pathways of Homo sapiens having at least one FFL of length 2,
and the ratio of NuCoFFL to NuFFL was greater than the ran-
domly expected ratio in all the pathways (see Supplementary
Table S2). Figure 5 shows the case of the Type II diabetes
mellitus pathway in Homo sapiens, where a total of 116
different FFLs are found, and all of them are coherent.
Therefore, coherent FFLs are more frequently found in real bio-
logical networks than randomly expected, and this raises the
question of why coherent FFLs are so abundant in real
biological networks.

3.2 Effect of an individual coherent FFL on robustness

Before investigating the effect of multiple coherent FFLs on net-
work robustness, we examine the effect of an individual coherent
FFL. Thus, we investigate the robustness against the initial-state
and the update-rule perturbations in the Boolean networks con-
sisting of only a single three-node FFL (Fig. 6). There can be

were generated

eight different networks that are classiﬁed into two groups of
networks containing only a single coherent (Fig. 6a) or incoher-
ent FFL (Fig. 6b), respectively. Then, the following two lemmas
with respect to yS(G) and y,(G), respectively, can be proved. In
both lemmas, all possible initial states are considered for robust-
ness computation, and v5, vM and vT denote a source, a mediate
and a target node in Figure 6, respectively. In addition, F: {fS,
fM, fT} represents the set of update rules for v5, vM and VT,
respectively.

LEMMA 1. Given a Boolean network G{ V: {vS, vM, VT}, A)
consisting of a three-node FFL as shown in Figure 6, yS(G) is 2/3
for both coherent and incoherent FFL cases. In particular, v5 is
the unique nonrobust node.

(PROOF) Let us consider an arbitrary initial state s 2 {125(0), vM(0),
v7(0)}€{0,1}3. For convenience, v(s, t) represents the value of a
node v at time t when the network is initialized with a state s.

signaling networks integrated from KEGG and the randomly expected
ratio of coherent FFLs. A point represents a result of a signaling network
of one species, and the values of the y-axis and x-axis represent the ratio
of NuCoFFL to NuFFL observed in the signaling networks and the ran-
domly expected ratio of coherent FFLs, respectively. The former is larger
than the latter in 1001 cases out of 1008 species

(i) When v5 is perturbed, the perturbed initial state s’ is set to
{l—vS(0), vM(0), v7(0)}. Then, vS(s, t)7év5(s’, t) for IZO and
thus ys(v5) = 0.

(ii) When vM is perturbed, s’ is set to {125(0), l—vM(0), v7(0)}.
Then, vS(s, t) = vS(s’, t) for t20 and thus
VM(S’, 1)=fM(vs(S’, 0))=fM(VS(Sa 0))=VM(S: 1)- That is,
vM(s, t)=vM(s’, t) for t: 1. Similarly, v7(s’, 2) =f7(vS(s’,
l), vM(s’, 1)) =f7(v5(s, l), vM(s, 1)): v7(s, 2). That is, v7(s,
t): v7(s’, t) for t: 2. Therefore, ys(vM)= 1.

(iii) When vT is perturbed, s’ is set to {v5(0), vM(0), 1—v7(0)}. It
is trivial that vS(s, t) = vS(s’, t) and vM(s, t): vM(s’, t) for
tZO. Then, v7(s’, l)=f7(vS(s’, 0), vM(s’, 0)) =f7(v5(s, 0),
vM(s, 0))=v7(s, 1). Thus, v7(s, t)=v7(s’, t) for tZl and
then yS(vT) = 1.

Note that (i), (ii), and (iii) hold for all types of networks shown in
Figure 6. Therefore, yS(G) is 2/3 and, in particular, v5 is the
unique nonrobust node.

LEMMA 2. Given a Boolean network G{ V: {vS, vM, VT}, A)
consisting of a three-node FFL as shown in Figure 6, y,{ G ) is 1
for coherent FFL cases whereas it is 2/3 for incoherent FFL
cases. In particular, T is the unique nonrobust node for incoher-
ent FFL cases.

(PROOF) For convenience, v(F, t) represents the value of node v
at time t when the network is given with the set of update-rules F.

(i) When v5 or vM is perturbed, the perturbed update rule F’
is set to {fS’, fM,, fT} or {fS, fM’, fT}, respectively. We note
that f5 =fS’ and f M = f M’ since f5 and f M are constant and
identity functions, respectively. Therefore, y,(vS) = 1 and
Vr(vM) : 

(ii) When vT is perturbed, the perturbed update rule F is set to
V5: fM: fT,}- Then: V707: I) =fT,(VS(fSa t— 1): VM(fMa
t—1))=A®B where A is vS(fS, t—l) or l—vS(fS, t—l), C)
is the conjunction or disjunction function, and B is vM(fM,

t—l) or l—vM(fM, t—l), respectively, for all tzl. Then, it is
true that A23 for coherent FFL cases but A753 for
incoherent cases. In addition, we note that the outputs
of the conjunction and the disjunction functions are
same when the two inputs (A and B) are equivalent
whereas they are different otherwise. Therefore,
y,(vT)=1 for coherent FFL case whereas y,(vT)=0 for
incoherent FFL case.

From (i) and (ii), y,(G) is 1 for coherent FFL cases whereas 2/3
for incoherent FFL cases. In particular, vT is the unique nonro-
bust node for incoherent FFL cases.

These lemmas say that the robustness against the initial-state
perturbation is 2/3 in all networks. In other words, there is no
difference between the networks composed of a single coherent
or incoherent FFL with respect to yS(G). On the other hand, the
robustness against the update-rule perturbation was 1 for
the networks of a single coherent FFL, whereas it was 2/3 for
the networks of a single incoherent FFL. Therefore, coherency of
FFLs improved robustness against update-rule perturbations,
but not against the initial-state perturbations. Moreover, it was
found that the source node denoted by S in Figure 6 was always
a unique nonrobust node subject to initial-state perturbation in
both the single coherent and incoherent FFL networks [i.e.
ys(vS) =0 and ys(vM) = ys(vT) = 1 in all networks]. On the other
hand, the target node denoted by T was a nonrobust node sub-
ject to update-rule perturbation in only the networks composed
of a single incoherent FFL [i.e. y,(vS) = y,(vM) = 1 and
y,(vT) = 0], whereas there was no nonrobust node in the networks
of coherent FFLs [i.e. y,(vS) = y,(vM) = y,(vT) = 1]. This interest-
ing result can be similarly observed in the case of four-node
FFLs (see Supplementary Fig. S3). More speciﬁcally, a network
G consisting of only a single four-node FFL shows yS(G) = 3/4,
since the source node (S) is always not robust. On the other
hand, for the target node (T), y,(vT) = 1 for every coherent
FFL network (Supplementary Fig. S3a), but y,(vT) :0 for
every incoherent FFL network (Supplementary Fig. S3b).
From this result, we can infer that the network robustness
against the perturbation subject to the upstream area is not con-
trolled by the coherency of FFLs. However, the coherent FFLs
can better sustain network robustness against the update-rule
perturbation subject to the downstream area.

3.3 Effect of multiple coherent FFLs on robustness in
random Boolean networks

Inspired by the observation of the effect of a simple motif com-
posed of a single coherent FFL on network robustness, we
hypothesized that multiple coherent FFLs in a network play
an important role in sustaining robustness, in particular against
the update rule perturbation. To conﬁrm the hypothesis, we per-
formed extensive simulations over many random Boolean net-
works. To this end, we generated two sets of 10000 random
Boolean networks with 30 nodes and 75 links (i.e. WI 2 30 and
|A| :75) using the ER and BA models, respectively
(see Materials and Methods), and |S| is set to 100. Then, they
were classiﬁed into two groups of networks according to the
difference between the ratio of NuCoFFL to NuFFL (oz) and
the randomly expected ratio of coherent FFLs (,8), ‘a> ,8’ and

three-node FFL. (a) Four different networks consisting of a single coher-
ent FFL. (b) Four different networks consisting of a single incoherent
FFL. In the ﬁgure, S, M and T represent a source, a mediate and a target
node, respectively. With respect to the initial-state perturbation, ys(G) is
2/3 for every network G in both (a) and (b). On the other hand, with
respect to the update-rule perturbation, y,(G) is 1 for every network G in
(a), whereas y,(G) is 2/3 for every network G in (b)

‘a<,8’ groups. We compared the average yS(G) and y,(G) be-
tween those two groups (Table 1). As shown in the table, the
robustness against the update-rule perturbation of ‘a> ,8’ is sig-
niﬁcantly larger than that of ‘a< ,8’ (using two-sample t-test, P-
value<0.01), whereas the difference between the two groups
with respect to robustness against initial-state perturbations is
not obvious (using two-sample t-test, P-value>0.1). Similar re-
sults were observed for the random Boolean networks with dif-
ferent size and density (see Supplementary Table S3). Therefore,
more abundant coherent FFLs than randomly expected help a
network to sustain robustness against update-rule perturbations,
whereas they do not affect the robustness against the initial-state
perturbations. This result is consistent with the observation in
Section 3.2 about the simple network consisting of a single FFL.

In addition, we proved that a single coherent FFL better sustains
robustness against update-rule perturbations subject to a target
node than a single incoherent FFL, and this causes a robustness
difference between the single coherent and incoherent FFLs.
Therefore, we additionally investigated whether the robustness
difference between ‘a> ,8’ and ‘a< ,8’ network groups, as shown
in Table 1, can be explained with the same reasoning. To
this end, we classiﬁed every source or target node (v)
included in the 10000 random Boolean networks into ‘Groupl’
if NuCoFFL(v)>NuInCOFFL(v) and into ‘Group2’ if
NuCoFFL(v)<NuInC0FFL(v). Next, we compare average ys(v)
and y,(v) between the two groups. As shown in Table 2, there
was no difference between the two node groups of the source
nodes with respect to average ys(v) and y,(v). For the target
nodes, whereas there was no difference between the two node
groups with respect to average ys(v), the average y,(v) of Group]
is signiﬁcantly greater than that of Group2 (using two-sample t-
test, all P—values<10_48). Similar results were observed for the
random networks with different size and density (See
Supplementary Table S4). This result indicates that the coherent
FFLs make a network more robust against the update-rule per-
turbation subject to target nodes.

4 CONCLUSIONS

In a recent study, Kwon and Cho (2008a) showed that FBLs
have a tendency to be coherently coupled in human signaling
networks, and these coherently coupled FBLs seem to be a
design principle, as they enhance network robustness against
initial-state perturbation. In this study, we extended this previous
ﬁnding to the coherent FFL structure. We ﬁrst observed that
FFL is a ubiquitously found motif in human signaling networks,
and it is likely to be coherently organized. Therefore, we inves-
tigated whether such a coherent FFL is correlated with
robustness-related behavior of a network through simulations
with random Boolean network models. We found that a single
coherent FFL makes a network more robust against update-rule
perturbation than a single incoherent FFL, whereas there is little

difference between these two types of FFLs with respect to
initial-state perturbation. Interestingly, this difference is caused
by difference in the robustness against update-rule perturbations
that are subject to the target node of the FFLs. This phenom-
enon and reasoning held consistently for networks containing
multiple FFLs. In summary, coherent FFLs can be a design
principle of the human signaling networks in that they improve
network robustness against update-rule perturbations.

The ﬁndings in this article can help deepen understanding with
regard to the dynamical role of coherent FFLs. For example, the
structure of multiple coherent FFLs can be considered as a kind
of redundancy engineering for biological robustness as observed
in alternative regular pathways that aid competition and survival
in changing environment (Pasek et al., 2006; Zhu et al., 2012). In
addition, the role of coherent FFLs found in this article is differ-
entiated from those of incoherent FFLs exposed in the previous
studies such as the fold-change detection in gene regulation
(Goentoro et al., 2009), the stable biochemical adaption
(Ma et al., 2009), the precise gene expression programming
(Osella et al., 2011). Therefore, many other dynamics compari-
son between coherent and incoherent FFLs will be a good future
study.

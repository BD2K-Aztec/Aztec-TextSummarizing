ABSTRACT

Summary: Anuran tissues, and especially skin, are a rich source of
bioactive peptides and their precursors. We here present a manually
curated database of antimicrobial and other defense peptides with
a total of 2571 entries, most of them in the precursor form with
demarcated signal peptide (SP), acidic proregion(s) and bioactive
moiety(s) corresponding to 1923 non-identical bioactive sequences.
Search functions on the corresponding web server facilitate the
extraction of six distinct SP classes. The more conserved of these
can be used for searching cDNA and UniProtKB databases for
potential bioactive peptides, for creating PROSITE search patterns,
and for phylogenetic analysis.

Availability: DADP is accessible at http://split4.pmfst.hr/dadp/
Contact: juretic@pmfst.hr

Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at
Bioinformatics online.

1 INTRODUCTION

With the growing problem of pathogens developing resistance to
conventional antibiotics, there is a great interest in antimicrobial
peptides (AMPs) as substitute therapeutics (Hancock and Sahl,
2006). There are several existing databases on many types of AMPs:
APD (Wang et al., 2009), CAMP (Thomas et al., 2010), PhytAMP
(Hammami et al., 2009), Defensins Knowledgebase (Seebah et al.,
2007), AMSDb (Tossi and Sandri, 2002), BACTIBASE (Hammami
et al., 2007), AMPer (Fjell et al. 2007) and YADAMP (Piotto et al.
2012). However, these databases tend to focus on the antimicrobial
sequences, and the immature precursors from which the active AMPs
are cleaved are not always present. DADP is a versatile database for
anuran defense peptides that retains all this important information.
Some anuran species contain >100 AMPs in their tissues, and
especially their skin, as well as other bioactive peptides (Li et al.,
2007, Yang et al., 2012), but many are endangered, while whole
genomes have been decoded for only 2 out of almost 6000 species
(Roelants et al., 2007; Calboli et al. 2011).

2 DATA COLLECTION

The following query was used in UniProtKB (http://www.
uniprot.orgl, preiler et al., 2011) release 2012_02 (February 22,
2012): (keyword: “Amphibian defense peptide [KW-0878]” 0R

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

keyword: “Antimicrobial [KW-0929]” 0R keyword: “Antibiotic
[KW-0044] ”) AND taxonomy: “Amphibia [8292] ” and 2492 results
were obtained. All sequences denoted as fragments were omitted.
For any region that was not annotated in UniProtKB, the sequence
was manually curated and divided into speciﬁc regions (signal,
acidic and bioactive) based on homology with annotated protein
precursors coupled with SignalP prediction (Bendtsen et al., 2004).
Several protein sequences not in accord with cited literature were
omitted.

The ﬁnal version of the database contains 1766 full precursor
sequences and 805 bioactive peptides with unknown precursor,
encompassing a total of 167 anuran species from 12 families
(Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). Biogeography data were
collected using The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species
(www.iucnredlist.org) and Amphibian Species of the World 5.5,
American Museum of Natural History (http://research.amnh.org/vz/
herpetology/amphibia/index.php).

Classiﬁcation by biological function includes over 70 different
activities, with AMPs being in the majority (Supplementary Table
S3). Missing activities ﬁeld denotes unknown function. Phylogenetic
analysis and classiﬁcation in six classes, based on signal peptide (SP)
similarity (Supplementary Fig. S1), was constructed using MEGA
software version 5 (Tamura et al., 2007). Activity and cytotoxicity
data were extracted from published papers where the minimal
inhibitory concentration (MIC, ,aM) based on microdilution assays
was reported for Escherichia coli and/or Staphylococcus aureus.
HC50 refers to peptide concentration, also micromolar, required for
50% haemolysis of red blood cells. MIC data are available for 921
peptide sequences.

3 IMPLEMENTATION

DADP is hosted on a 64 bit Linux server using Apache
(http://www.apache.org/) and PHP (http://www.php.net/). All entries
are stored in a MySQL (http://www.mysql.com/) database. The
application was written in PHP, using the j Query J avaScript Library
(http://jquery.com/) with the DataTables (http://datatables.net/)
plug—in for the tables’ implementation, and CSS for web design.

4 WEB INTERFACE

The DADP web interface offers browsing capability for all peptide
entries, for SPs and for SP classes in particular. An advanced
search option is available for more speciﬁc user requests. Each
DADP ID entry contains detailed information about peptide names
and sequences, tripartite structure, species, SP class, biogeography,

5 DISCUSSION

Bioactive peptides from amphibian species with function, often
related to host defense, are a fast growing group in the UniProtKB
database and this attempt to collect and order them all can mostly
serve to emphasize the incompleteness of our knowledge. For
instance, out of 167 species from the DADP, only 28 can be found
among 2200 threatened and near threatened anuran species from
the IUCN Red List. The DADP focuses on precursors and their
conserved SPs and has allowed the individuation of six distinct SP
classes (see Supplementary Material and Supplementary Tables S4
and S5). Consensus sequences for the different SP classes are a good
foundation for searching protein or DNA databases that might carry
precursors with novel AMP sequences, where a direct homology
search based on the active region only is unsuccessful (J uretié et al.,
2011; Tessera et al. , 2012). The most numerous class of SPs (present
in 85% of precursors) has twin lysines at positions 5 and 6, and is
denoted as Class-1 in DADP. It is found in Neobatrachia families
Ranidae, Hylidae, Hyperoliidae and Rhacophoridae. SP classes 1—6
are associated not only with AMPs but also with mature bioactive
peptides having other functions.

Precursor structure is informative about origin, function and
evolution of mature peptides collected in the DADP, but there are
numerous peptides present only as the mature bioactive sequence,
where the precursor structure is not reported. The activity data,
shown as MIC and HC50 values, are available for over 900
sequences. These should, however, be considered critically as
both are quite sensitive to assay conditions, which vary from
lab to lab [e.g. medium, salt concentrations and the size of
initial inoculum, which should be at least 105 cfu/ml for MIC
(Resende et al., 2008) and at most 1% erythrocytes for HC50
determinations, limits often either not observed or not deﬁned in
published papers].

The conservation of SPs in different suborders and families
of anurans, whose relatedness follows continental tectonics and
corresponding changes in biogeography, is quite impressive
(Supplementary Fig. S1 and the DADP web server). This is
one of those rare examples when maintenance of the export
SPs, which are dispensed with after secretion, is evolutionarily
more conserved than the mature exported polypeptide structure.
It may be beneﬁcial for the host to have accelerated co-evolution
of the mature defense peptide sequences, to keep up with the
constantly shifting microbial biota, allowing to maintain the host-
pathogen balance (Peschel and Sahl, 2006). The number of identical
SPs associated with different mature peptides found in different
species can be quite large (e.g. 164 identical Class-1 SP sequences
encompassing 36 species and associated with 141 different mature
peptides).

It is also possible to ﬁnd identical mature peptides associated
with SPs that are different in several positions. An example is
the antimicrobial granulosusin—D2 and palustrin—2ISa, respectively,
belonging to different species (Amolops granulosus from China and
Rana ishikawae from Japan). Another is the bradykinin sequence
RPPGFSPFR, which is associated with different SP sequences in 15
different species. These bioactive skin peptides from frogs and toads
may be effective repellents against macroscopic predators such as

ﬁsh (Chen et al., 2011) and snakes. These two cases are possible
examples of convergent evolution of the active region to provide
for similar functions.

The DADP can greatly facilitate using the HMIVIER tool (Finn
et al., 2011) to search UniProtKB for amphibian AMPs. In this case
the sequence length limitations of the tool require the combined use
of the signal sequence and acidic propiece as the query.

The DADP can be regularly updated using both keywords and
similarity search.

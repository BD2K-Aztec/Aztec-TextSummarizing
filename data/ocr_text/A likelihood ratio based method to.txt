ABSTRACT

Motivation: Next generation sequencing (NGS) technology
considerably changed the way we screen for pathogenic mutations in
rare Mendelian disorders. However, the identification of the disease-
causing mutation amongst thousands of variants of partly unknown
relevance is still challenging and efficient techniques that reduce
the genomic search space play a decisive role. Often segregation-
or linkage analysis are used to prioritize candidates, however,
these approaches require correct information about the degree of
relationship among the sequenced samples. For quality assurance
an automated control of pedigree structures and sample assignment
is therefore highly desirable in order to detect label mix-ups that might
otherwise corrupt downstream analysis.

Results: We developed an algorithm based on likelihood ratios that
discriminates between different classes of relationship for an arbitrary
number of genotyped samples. By identifying the most likely class
we are able to reconstruct entire pedigrees iteratively, even for highly
consanguineous families. We tested our approach on exome data
of different sequencing studies and achieved high precision for all
pedigree predictions. By analyzing the precision for varying degrees
of relatedness or inbreeding we could show that a prediction is robust
down to magnitudes of a few hundred loci.

Availability: A java standalone application that computes the
relationships between multiple samples as well as a Rscript that
visualizes the pedigree information is available for download as well
as a web service at www.gene-talk.de.

1 INTRODUCTION

In recent years high-throughput sequencing approaches have been
successfully applied to identify thousands of novel pathogenic
mutations in genetic disorders. However, due to the high variability
of the human genome, there are several hundred variants of
unclear signiﬁcance in each individual and the analysis of such

 

*to whom correspondence should be addressed

high dimensional data is still challenging. In order to reduce
the search space, related individuals are usually sequenced for
ﬁltering purposes or linkage analysis, when studying unknown
disorders. Even in routine diagnostics sequencing of additional
family members is common practice, whenever the disorder
is highly heterogeneous and de novo mutations are the most
promising candidates (Veltman and Brunner, 2012).

However, these approaches rely on correct pedigree information and
thus there is a great need for robust and easily manageable methods
for checking the relationship between samples. So far it is common
practice to infer relatedness with different kinds of genetic markers
and a comprehensive overview of the existing methods is given by
Blouin (2003) and Pemberton (2008).

Most of the approaches that are based on likelihood ratios, LR,
test different pre-deﬁned relationship models and have already been
thoroughly discussed by others (Brenner (1997), Marshall et al.
(1998), Aoki et al. (2001)). In our work we study the effectiveness of
pedigree predictions when also rare markers are used, that become
only accessible by direct sequencing.

In general the accuracy of the prediction increases with the
information content of the available markers. Microsatellites are
very variable in length and are thus highly informative. With 20 to
30 unlinked microsatellites it is usually possible to achieve accurate
predictions about the relationship between samples. In contrast,
SNVs are mostly biallelic and in exomes their mean heterozygosity
is only around 0.3. On the other hand, large numbers of SNVs are
detected in high-throughput sequencing projects and we will study
in this work how the accuracy of pedigree predictions scales with
the number of such markers.

All models that have been developed for the prediction
of relationships also have to account for genotyping errors.
Microsatellites are more difﬁcult to genotype than SNVs
(Pompanon et al., 2005). Additionally, the intrinsically higher rates
of mutations can introduce biases in analyses that rely on identity by
state, IBS (Hardy et al. , 2003). Due to these technical challenges the
evaluation of microsatellite data requires a high human expertise to
avoid false parentage exclusions as discussed in Dakin and Avise

(2004) and it is also more difﬁcult to automate these methods
computationally.

In most approaches that are used to predict relationships, marker
sets are deﬁned prior to screening the samples. In order to maximize
the probability that a marker is informative, SNPs or SSRs with
a high heterozygosity are therefore usually chosen. However,
certainly bi—allelic markers with a high population frequency may
also be IBS by pure chance.

With whole exomes and other types of reference-guided
resequencing data, there is no need for choosing marker loci a
priori, as variant calls are plentiful. Instead we can simply consider
all positions where the genotype of at least one of the samples differs
from the reference sequence. The potential of such rare SNVs for
pedigree prediction has not been studied so far.

Most existing methods that work with genome data rely on
haplotype reconstruction and can certainly achieve high precision
(He et al., 2013). Unfortunately, for exome data and other
enrichment based NGS data sets, the derivation of long haplotypes
is often not possible.

We analyzed systematically likelihood-based approaches to
reconstruct entire pedigrees that also take into account rare markers
and we found that especially rare variants are well suited for
assessing second-order relations. By this means we achieve high
precision in pedigree predictions and present a tool that can easily be
integrated in existing analysis pipelines to ensure quality and avoid
sample mix-ups.

2 APPROACH

We developed a method to reconstruct and Visualize complex
pedigree structures for any given number of individuals that is based
on likelihood ratios of different models of relationship types for any
combination of two samples (dyad). For any possible dyad we test
the following models of kinship:

0 unrelated

1 technical/biological replicates (or identical twins)

2 full siblings
3

4

parent-child

second-order relationship

The different degrees of relationship reﬂect the expected values

for the proportion of the genome that is shared between two
individuals. This can also be expressed by the coefﬁcient of
relationship which deﬁnes the probability that an allele at an
arbitrary locus in the genome originates from the same common
ancestor ((Wright, 1922)). For instance, we would expect that a
parent and a child as well as siblings share 50% of their genetic
material and thus the same coefﬁcient of relationships. In second
order relationships as e.g. in a grandparent-grandchild, or uncle-
nephew dyad only 25% of the alleles are identical by descent,
IBD, in an outbred population. On the contrary, in highly inbred
populations and consanguineous marriages the expected coefﬁcients
of relationship of 0.5 and 0.25 may deviate upwards substantially.
In the following we will also use the coefﬁcient of relationship
to discriminate between different degrees of kinship and refer to
parent-child and ﬁll siblings as ﬁrst-order relationship and classify

half—siblings, grandparent—grandchild and aunt/uncle-nephew/niece
as second-order relationships. Additionally we are deﬁning the
model technical/biological replicates to identify samples that have
a relationship coefﬁcient close to 1, which is either the case if the
same sample has been processed twice or if two samples are from
identical twins. For each possible dyad all these models are tested
and compared to a null hypothesis that assumes the individuals are
unrelated, which is explained in more detail in the next section.
The computation of the probabilities of all hypotheses requires
knowledge about the expected allele frequencies in a population.
In this work, if an allele was observed at least once in the 1000
genomes project (Altshuler et al. (2010), The 1000 Genomes Project
Consortium (2012)) we use the respective frequency. The most
likely relatedness class is then identiﬁed by the largest likelihood
ratio among all hypotheses for one dyad.We provide a tool for our
algorithm that works on genotype data presented in VCF format
((Danecek et al., 2011)) and that generates an intermediate output
that we refer to as extended ped format: for each individual the most
likely relationships to the remaining individuals are recorded. In
addition to mother and father, also children and sibling relationships
are listed (see Supplemental Methods). An R Script takes the
predicted classes of relationship as input and visualizes the result
in a pedigree graph. We tested our method on family exome
data from the 1000 genomes project (referred to as lKG data in
the following), as well as on in—house data. For the systematic
analysis of performance at different degrees of inbreeding as well as
increasing degrees of error rates we also simulated samples based on
sequencing data from real individuals. The java application, as well
as the Visualizing R script, is integrated in GeneTalk ((Kamphans
et al., 2013)), and also available as a standalone application at
www.gene-talk.de/vcf2ped. We analyzed the performance of our
approach for a decreasing number of exomic and genomic markers.
For exomic markers that are mostly unlinked we achieved high
accuracy for all relationships (ﬁrst and second order) with a
minimum of 10,000 markers. The same accuracy can be achieved
with a comparable number of genomic markers when randomly
distributed over the genome (data not shown).

3 MATERIALS AND METHODS

Data processing and simulation of technical replicates

The implementation was tested on publicly available data of the IKG
project as well as on data that had been sequenced in-house over the past
years with the approval of the ethical Board of the Charité. All in-house
samples were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 and the resulting reads
were mapped to the th9 reference genome using BWA-MEM (Li, 2013).
Multi-sample variant calling was performed on 39 families with different
population backgrounds, downloaded from the ftp server of the IKG project,
as well as on in-house families, including three families which show a
high degree of consanguinity within the pedigree, with GATK (Mckenna
et al., 2010) (version 2.7-2) using standard Best Practices recommendations
(DePristo et al., 2011). To guarantee a fair comparison between all analysed
sequencing samples we restricted all variant calls to the pilot 3 consensus
exonic target region deﬁned by the IKG project. We deﬁned a minimum
coverage of 5 reads per base in a homozygous state and a minimum of 5
reads per allele for heterozygous variants.

All individuals of the I KG project are subdivided into single families
of 2, 3 or 4 family members, which are connected Via different degrees of
relationship (siblings, one parent - one child, trio: two parents - one child,

quartet: two parents - two children and second-order). in—house families can
be grouped in trios, quartets and families ranging over three generations (see
Figure 1), including second-order relationships. Additionally we simulated
technical replicates of one individual of the 1KG project (NA06986) by
randomly reducing the coverage of the original alignment yielding a mean
per-base coverage of 313, 140, 120, 80, 50 and 30 reads.

Likelihood ratio analysis

Likelihood analysis is used to evaluate the goodness of ﬁt of a hypothesis
H,- relative to another hypothesis H j,i 75 j, (e.g. the null-hypothesis
H0), depending on the same underlying data D. The likelihood ratio can
be expressed as follows:

Pr(D|I-I,-)

LR(H,-,H,-|D) = W
.7

For every two individuals (m1 and am) we consider ﬁve different
hypotheses Hui E I = {0, 1, 2, 3,4}:

H 0: Sample 111 and 3:2 are unrelated

H1: Sample 111 and 3:2 are technical/biological replicates
H 2: Sample 111 and 3:2 are full siblings

H3: Sample 111 is a parent of sample m2

H4: Sample 111 and 3:2 have a second-order relationship

As already introduced and extended in previous works (including Thomas
et al. (2002), Aoki et al. (2001), Marshall et al. (1998) and Brenner
(1997)) we estimate the probability of the combination of two genotypes
of two individuals with the additional use of population data (Table 1, see
supplemental material for a detailed derivation of the formulas). In this
study we calculated allele frequencies per position from 2535 unrelated
individuals which were recently updated by the KG project ((Altshuler
et al., 2010)). The likelihood ratios for the combinations of genotypes
(gt E {am am}, amm E {A, C, G, T}) for all variable positions, In E K,
can be combined for unlinked marker loci. Due to the small probabilities it
is computationally more efﬁcient to work with logarithms of the likelihood
ratlos:

K K kEK

z? 2,0910 (9 x1( > good )I 2)

For some relatedness classes, the probability of having one genotype
in one sample and another genotype in a second sample would be zero,
assuming perfect data quality and no de novo mutations. With these

Table 1. Likelihood ratios for all subject-query genotype combinations gt for
different hypotheses. The frequencies, fn refer to the allele frequency of
allele an and are pre-calculated using data from the 1KG project and we
assume Zn fn = 1. Combinations of genotypes that do not occur for certain
relationships (’Mendelian error’) could still be observed due to e.g. erroneous
genotyping (e = 0.001).

prerequisites it is, for instance, not possible that a parent has genotype a1 (11
while the child has genotype a2 (12 at the same position. This could yield
inﬁnitely large likelihood ratios. In this case we use an additional parameter
e = 0.001, accounting for sequencing errors and de novo mutations.

Infering relatedness classes from log likelihood ratios

For each dyad we computed the LRs for all variable positions and hypotheses
H ,- Versus the null hypothesis (not related). As the number of variable
positions might differ between dyads we used the mean LR per position
for a better comparison (Fig. 2). The Violin plots Visualize the distributions
of the LRs for different hypothesis comparisons for unrelated dyads. LR
tests for most of the related individuals (circles) yield positive values and the
correct hypothesis maximizes the likelihood ratio, mam{LR(H,-, H 0 ) },-20
For large sample sizes the likelhood ratio test statistics approximate a X2
distribution and may also be used for a probabilistic interpretation (Wilks’s
theorem).

In families of more than two members and even highly complex sub-
structures, such as shown in Fig. 1, the whole pedigree is reconstructed from
the predicted relationships of dyads.

All relationship hypothesis are not directed. This means, when a the
parent-child relationship is detected in a dyad we don’t know who is the
father and who is the son. However, the directionality can be clariﬁed by the
relationsships of additional family members. The sex of each individual is
determined by the ratio of heterozygous variants versus all variants on the X
chromosome and is also used in the pedigree reconstruction.

Fig. 2. Comparison of the mean likelihood ratio LR per position for
different relationships between pairs of individuals (dyads). The likelihood
for all relationship models H ,- versus the null hypothesis (not related) were
computed for all dyads from the 1000 genomes project and additional family

distribution (gray Violin plots) whereas dyads with a relationship are
illustrated as circles. The true relationship is color-coded and maximazes the
LR for the correct hypothesis. Exemplarin this is shown for a dyad of each

rate (orange asterix).

to families with different substructures (Fig. 2). The comparison of
likelihood ratios of most models show a segmentation of the dyads
corresponding to their kinship coefﬁcients. For instance, in Fig. 2
we see for the comparison H 3, H 0 technical replicates (H 1) with a
kinship coefﬁcient close to 1 at the right end, dyads of siblings (H 2)
or parent-child (H3) in the middle and second-order relationships
(H4) at the left side. Dyads that are not related are Visualized as a
gray background distribution (Violin plots). An interesting exception
is LR(H 3, H 2), where two models with the same expected kinship
coefﬁcient (0.5) are compared. This likelihood ratio is well suited
for discriminating between parent-child and sibling relationships.
Since the probability that a parent and a child share the same
allele is the same as in siblings (50%), it is hard to distinguish
between these two relationship states and lead to a low variance in
likelihood ratios, as seen in the likelihood ratios for LR(H 3, H 2)
in Fig. 2. A similar kinship coefﬁcient is also the reason why the
LR values for parent-child and full siblings are nearly on the same
level for the comparisons LR(H3, H0) and LR(H2, H0). This

leads to the overall rule: the discriminatory power to distinguish
between different hypotheses gets lower if the underlying assumed
relationship types become more similar.

Especially with increasing error rates the identiﬁcation of identical
twins/technical replicates becomes more difﬁcult as the expected
kinship coefﬁcient of 1 drops. Although all simulated replicates
form a distinct cluster in the comparison of LR(H1, H0) in Fig.
2, there are three dyads (*) that yield a LR < 0. These
false classiﬁcations can be avoided if the error rate 6 is adjusted
appropriately.

Number of Markers (log)

Fig. 3. The precision of the prediction of all relationships decreases with
the number of available markers and their heterozygosity. The number
of markers was either randomly reduced or restricted to a subset of
highly informative markers. The positive predictive values for parent-child
as well as for full sibling relationships start to drop when using less
than N 500 markers. At a comparable number of markers, second-order
relationships are more difﬁcult to distinguish from unrelated controls. The
mean heterozygosity of biallelic variants in an exome is 0.3 and represents
the information content of a marker. A higher precision can be achieved
when choosing markers with a heterozygosity above this average (unﬁlled
shapes).

We analyzed the effect of the number of variants on the precision
of the classiﬁcation process by reducing the amount of markers.

Besides restricting to smaller randomly chosen subsets we also
studied the performance for subsets of loci with high heterozygosity.
Such subsets are more similar to the markers used in SNP-arrays and
allow a comparison with existing tools. Heterozygosity is deﬁned as
h = 1 — Zn f3 and relates to the information content of a marker.
The average heterozygosity of a SNV in our exome data was 0.3. In
contrast most existing tools use polymorphic sites with considerably
larger h. The positive predictive value (precision) of parent-child
and full sibling comparisons starts to drop when using less than
500 randomly selected markers (Fig. 3). The correct assignment
of second-order relationships requires substantially more markers
for a comparable precision. However, the performance for the
second-order classiﬁcations is good for whole exome sequencing
data comprising several thousands of variants. Only a reduction to
fewer loci, as encountered in gene panels, will lead to an excess of
false positive predictions and therefore to lower precision values.
Especially the number of unrelated dyads that are erroneously
classiﬁed as second-order increases.

We hypothesized that increasing the heterozygosity of these small
marker sets might improve the precision. When choosing only
loci with a heterozygosity above average, the precision for all
relationship models increased (unﬁlled shapes in Fig. 3). This
is in good agreement with the results from other studies that
achieved a high precision for predictions that were based on markers
with high information content (Epstein et al., 2000). The most
polymorphic site accessible Via exome sequencing is the human
leukocyte antigen (HLA) cluster on chromosome 6 with more than
7300 different alleles known up to date (Robinson, et al., 2016).
Recently, bioinformatics tools became available that allow HLA
typing from exome data and can be used additionally to rule out
relatedness in questionable dyads (Szolek, et al., 2014). However,
a general comparison between the predictive power of multiple
iallelic markers such as most SNVs and a single polymorphic
marker such as the HLA shows that the discriminatory power is
limited: Assuming equal likelihoods for all alleles, the information
content, I C' = — Zn fnloglo fn, of 13 unlinked biallelic markers
(71. = 2) would be comparable to the IC of the HLA locus (71. =
7300).

The contributions of the different genotype combinations to the
log-likelihood ratios also depend on the heterozygosity. For instance
in LR(H3, Hg), for common variants the major contribution will
come from the genotype combinations a1 a2 ~ a1 a2 and mm ~
agag. If H0 is the true hypothesis the later, a1a1 ~ agag, will push
LR(H3, H0) below zero (Fig. S1d). However, for smaller f1, the
choice of 6 will inﬂuence this result (Fig. S1a). On the other hand,
if H3 is true then the ratio 1 / 2 f1 (Table 1 for a1a1 ~ alag) will
shift LR(H3, H0) to positive values. The contribution of mm ~
a1 a2 to LR(H3, H0) is positive for frequencies f1 < 0.5 and thus
in favor of H3. This combination will more likely occur for small
values of f1 and an disproportionate high occurence of this term will
indicate relatedness.

Interestingly, we found most misclassiﬁed second-order relationships

within the same sub-populations, after randomly reducing the
number of variants. That also emphasizes the importance of using
rare low-frequency variants, that are speciﬁc within families rather
than using polymorphisms that are more suitable to discriminate
between sub-populations.

Directionality of parent-child relationships

The directionality of a parent-child connection can be solved by
considering additional relationships if more family members are
available ((Thomas and Hill, 2000)). Fig. 4a) exempliﬁes a case
where both, mother and father, are present in the available family
tree (referred to as trio). The clear assignment of mother - child
and father - child can be resolved by the additional information
that both parents are not related. In another example, (Fig. 4b)),
the directionality between parent and child can be resolved by the
additional knowledge, that two of the three available samples in a
pedigree (III and 112) have a sibling relationship. A more detailed
description for the pedigree reconstruction, that is based on this rule
set, can be found in the supplemental material and is also encoded
in our tool.

From a theoretical point of View, we wondered whether it is possible
to infer the directionality of a parent—child relationship, if only
a dyad is given (Fig. 4 c)). There is one scenario in which the
directionality can be resolved by data of the dyad itself. If both

parents have a different ethnic background the offspring will show
two sets of population speciﬁc SNPs (Fig. 4 d). Furthermore the
heterozygosity of the offspring will be higher than of each of the
parents, which is illustrated in Fig. 4 e), where we simulated an
offspring of two 1KG individuals from distinguishable populations
(CHS and YRI). The frequency for many polymorphisms differs
depending on the population background. In an offspring from two
different ethnic backgrounds there will be a movement towards the
joint mean, similar to an increasing entropy in thermodynamics
when two isolated systems are mixed (Fig. 4 f).

Fig. 4. The parent-child directionality can be resolved with at least three
available samples, either due to the knowledge that both parents are unrelated
(a) or with additional information about siblings (b). If just two sequenced
samples are available in the analysis, the directionality can not be resolved
(c). Panel d) shows an illustrated example of two different populations (#1

offspring of two members of these distinguishable groups would share half
of the population speciﬁc variants of the mother and half of the father. A
simulated offspring of two individuals with different ethnic backgrounds,
YRI (orange) and CH8 (green), has an increased proportion of heterozygous
variants (e) and the mean minor allele frequency (MAF) is located between
the MAF of the parents (f).

Fig. 5. Classiﬁcation of relationships in highly consanguineous families. In
addition to real offspring from related parents, we also simulated offspring
for 1KG dyads with different degrees of relatedness. Individual inbreeding
coefﬁcients were calculated for all offspring and log likelihood ratios for
all parent-child pairs. For offspring with a higher inbreeding coefﬁcient log
likelihood ratios of parent-child versus siblings approach decrease. However,
for exome data a correct classiﬁcation of all parent-child pairs is still
possible.

Inﬂuence of inbred structures within complex families

In highly consanguineous families the prediction of the exact
relationships becomes more difﬁcult as there is a stronger deviation
from the null model that is based on the allele frequencies of an
outbred population.

In addition to exomes from highly consanguineous families,
we investigated the inﬂuence of inbred structures by simulating
offspring from related 1KG dyads. For each related pair, we
randomly chose one allele from each of both assumed parents to
create a new genotype at each autosomal position. We used the
individual inbreeding coefﬁcients, f, for each offspring, to quantify
the extent of consanguinity.

The inbreeding coefﬁccient is deﬁned as the ratio of the genome
that is IBD (Wright, 1922) and was computed as described by (Gazal
et al., 2014). As expected, the simulated offspring with closely
related parents show higher individual inbreeding coefﬁcients.
These higher inbreeding factors correlate with lower likelihood
ratios between relationship models of the same order, such as
parent-child versus siblings (Fig. 5).

When using entire exome data sets a correct classiﬁcation was still
possible for all tested cases, even for families with a high degree of
consanguinity.

5 DISCUSSION

In this work we analyzed the performance of reconstructing
family structures with genotype data that become available in
NGS sequencing studies, including rare variants. We were able to
derive pedigrees with high precision for publicly available samples
of families, as well as for in—house data, even for as little as
a few hundred markers. Our method is based on comparisons
between likelihood ratios for different kinship classes and - as
expected - the closer the coefﬁcients of relationship were between
two models, the more difﬁcult it became to differentiate between
them. The most challenging discrimination is between unrelated
individuals in a highly inbred population and samples that are
related by second-order relationship. So far highly polymorphic
marker loci such as microsatellites have been used in paternity
testing and to detect distant relationships. However, ancestry can
also effectively be identiﬁed with the use of rare and family speciﬁc
single nucleotide variants. We observed the biggest variance in
likelihood ratios for all dyads for the comparison of the hypothesis
H 3, H 0 (parent-child ~ unrelated). One drawback of our approach
is that different quality levels of the data are not considered. We
simulated technical replicates with a high error rate by decreasing
the coverage per base in the alignments and studied the inﬂuence on
the classiﬁcation process. Some replicates with a large difference
in coverage and quality were misclassiﬁed as full siblings instead
of technical replicates, as Visualized in Fig. 2 (Violet dots for
LR(H1, H 2)). With decreasing coverage, the error rates - especially
for heterozygous calls - increase. However, the site-speciﬁc error
probabilities that are reported by standard genotype callers are
usually vastly underestimated for rare variants. Allegedly small
error rates pose a problem especially in the identiﬁcation of
replicates. Another approach to estimate genotyping errors on
exome variant lists, that also considers allele frequencies from
population studies, reported a mean genotyping error rate of
e=0.001 as more accurate for most current exomes (Heinrich et al.,
2013).This error rate also yielded the best performance in our tests
and is therefore suggested as a default setting. The consequences
of an unsuitable choice of this parameter on the likelihood ratios is
discussed in more detail in the supporting information.

In summary we have shown that genotype data from NGS studies
can also be used to deduce pedigree information with high precision.
Our approach doesnt require any additional generation of data and
will thus be easy to integrate into existing analysis pipelines. This
will help to identify sample mix-ups at an early stage and improve
the overall quality in the diagnostic procedure.

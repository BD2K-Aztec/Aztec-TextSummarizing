ABSTRACT

Summary: While many experimentally characterized phosphorylation
sites exist for certain organisms, such as human, rat and mouse, few
sites are known for other organisms, hampering related research ef-
forts. We have developed a software pipeline called DAPPLE that
automates the process of using known phosphorylation sites from
other organisms to identify putative sites in an organism of interest.
Availability: DAPPLE is available as a web server at http://saphire.

1 INTRODUCTION

Protein phosphorylation is the most widespread cellular signaling
mechanism in eukaryotes (Johnson and Hunter, 2005).
Knowledge of an organism’s phosphorylation sites facilitates
the study of its cellular signaling pathways, which in turn has
many applications in basic and translational research. Although
online databases contain many phosphorylation sites for human,
rat, and mouse, little data are available for other species. Using
the cow as a test species, we previously proposed a protocol for
making predictions in species with few known sites (Jalal et al.,
2009). Taking advantage of sequence homology between human
and bovine proteins, this protocol involved manually using
known human phosphorylation sites as BLAST queries to iden-
tify bovine sites. If a query and its best match in the bovine
proteome had few or no sequence differences, the match was
considered a putative bovine site.

While useful, several aspects of this protocol could be im-
proved. First, its manual nature makes it time-consuming, and
also limits the amount of known phosphorylation data that can
be used. Second, it uses only known phosphorylation sites from
human. It is possible, for instance, that a given bovine site might
be homologous to a known rat site, but not to any known human
site, and by using only known phosphorylation sites from
human, this bovine site would be missed. This problem would
be even more pronounced for species that are distantly related to
human, such as plants. Third, the method used in Jalal et al.

(2009) to identify non-orthologous proteins (comparing their an-
notations) has several drawbacks, including its subjective nature,
the difficulty of automating these comparisons and the fact that
annotations are often inaccurate or incomplete.

DAPPLE is a software pipeline that addresses these concerns,
ultimately allowing the user to easily, quickly and accurately
identify potential phosphorylation sites in an organism of
interest.

2 DESCRIPTION OF DAPPLE

A complete description of the operation of DAPPLE, including a
detailed ﬂow chart, is available as Supplementary Material.
Below, we brieﬂy describe the input to, and output from,
DAPPLE.

DAPPLE’s input files are (i) the proteome of the target organ-
ism; (ii) a database of known phosphorylation sites; and (iii) the
proteomes of the organisms represented in that database. All
proteomes must be in FASTA format. Item (iii) is optional,
but is necessary for DAPPLE to output information for the
‘RBH?’ column of the output table (see below). The phosphor-
ylation site database can be obtained from a number of sources;
a partial list is included in the DAPPLE documentation. This
study uses phosphorylation sites from PhosphoSitePlus (Hom-
beck et al., 2012) (www.phosphosite.org/downloads/Phosphory
lation_site_dataset.gz). The majority of sites in PhosphoSitePlus
are represented by 15-mer peptides, with the phosphorylated resi-
due in the middle. However, some sites are too close to the N— or
C—terminus of the full protein to have seven residues on either
side, and are thus represented by a shorter peptide. To allow
them to attain statistically signiﬁcant BLAST hits, for these
sites DAPPLE uses as a query the first or last 15 residues of
the full protein sequence. As such, all queries used in DAPPLE
are 15 residues in length. Additionally, entries with identical se-
quences (from different organisms) are removed.

The remaining phosphorylation site sequences are used as
queries to b1 as tp, with the target organism’s proteome as the
database. Unlike in J alal et al. (2009), queries are not limited to
those from human. Information about the best match (as ex-
plained in the Supplementary Materials, weaker matches may
optionally be used) is saved or computed, and ultimately pre-
sented in the DAPPLE output table (described below).

Because of the short length of the query sequences, the full
protein corresponding to the best match may not be orthologous

to the full protein corresponding to the query. In Jalal et al.
(2009), this problem was addressed by manually comparing the
annotations of the two proteins. However, this approach suffers
from the drawbacks described previously; thus, DAPPLE uses
the well-established reciprocal BLAST hits (RBH) method to
ascertain orthology (Overbeek et al., 1999). For a known site
X from organism A with match Y in target organism B, let X’
be the full protein corresponding to X, and analogously for Y’.
DAPPLE declares X’ and Y’ as orthologues if and only if Y’ is
the best match when X’ is used as a query and the proteome of
organism B is used as the database, and X’ is the best match when
Y’ is used as a query sequence and the proteome of organism A is
used as the database. In this case, ‘the best match’ is deﬁned as
any protein that has the smallest E—value. Soft masking of the
query sequences is used when searching full protein sequences as
suggested by Moreno-Hagelsieb and Latimer (2008).

DAPPLE outputs a table in which each row represents the
result of a BLAST search using, as a query, one of the known
sites in the phosphorylation site database. The table is in a tab-
delimited plain text format that can easily be manipulated or
imported into a spreadsheet program. This table contains
many columns designed to help the user decide on the accuracy
and usefulness of a given match; the following list describes most
of these (for the full list, see the Supplementary Materials).

0 Query accession, query description, query organism, query
sequence, query site—the accession number, description, or-
ganism, amino acid sequence and phosphorylated residue
(e.g. Y482) of X’, respectively.

0 Hit site, hit accession, hit description, hit sequence—the
same as above, except for Y’ rather than X’.

0 Sequence differences—the number of differences between all
of X (not just the portion that matched in the BLAST local
alignment) and Y.

0 Hit protein E—value—the E—value of the match between X’
and Y’ when X’ is used as the query and B is used as the
database.

0 RBH?—‘yes’ or ‘no’, depending on whether X’ and Y’ are
RBH.

3 RESULTS

To test DAPPLE, phosphorylation sites in the cow (Bos taurus)
were identiﬁed, as was done by Jalal et al. (2009). The ﬁles
described below were used as input to DAPPLE. The
PhosphoSitePlus database was downloaded, and contained
214 185 unique phosphorylation sites. The proteomes corres-
ponding to the target organism (cow) and the organisms repre-
sented in the PhosphoSitePlus database were downloaded from
UniProtKB.

Table 1 compares the results given by J alal et al. with those
produced by DAPPLE. Note that both the methodology and
input data used are not identical, so DAPPLE’s output is not
expected to be exactly the same. Nevertheless, the percentages of
known phosphorylation sites that had a given number of se-
quence differences with their best bovine BLAST match were
similar between the two approaches. For DAPPLE, the

Note: The ﬁrst column indicates the number of sequence differences between a
known site from PhosphoSitePlus and its best bovine match. The second column
indicates the percentage of known sites with the indicated number of sequence
differences in J alal et al. (2009). The ‘no homology’ row indicates known sites for
which there was either no match in the bovine proteome, or the annotation of the
match differed from that of the query. The third column represents output from
DAPPLE, with the ‘no homology’ row indicating that either the phosphorylation
site had no match in the bovine proteome, or that ‘RBH?’ = ‘no’ (see Section 2).
The fourth column is similar to the third, except instead of a site falling under the
‘No homology’ row if ‘RBH?’ = ‘no’, it does so if the hit protein E-value (see
Section 2) is >10‘5. The E-value method represents a less stringent method of
ascertaining homology (though not necessarily orthology).

percentage of peptides under the ‘no homology’ category differed
depending on the criterion for declaring two proteins as ortho-
logues (see Table 1 caption), with the RBH method being less
sensitive but more speciﬁc than the E-value method. Note that
the sites reported by DAPPLE are only predictions; further, the
functional signiﬁcance of a homologous site may differ in the
target organism, especially when the target is a distantly related
species.

Both the gain in efﬁciency using DAPPLE, and the value of
using RBH as opposed to comparing annotations, are illustrated
with examples in the Supplementary Materials.

4 CONCLUSION

DAPPLE improves on an already-successful method for predict-
ing phosphorylation sites for non-typical model species. Our lab
has used its output to help design peptide arrays containing tar-
gets of protein kinases (Houseman et al., 2002) for studying
honeybee, pig and chicken (our manuscripts in preparation),
and it should be applicable to many other organisms, as well
as other research problems related to protein phosphorylation.
Finally, DAPPLE is not limited to phosphorylation; it could
easily be applied to other post-translational modiﬁcations or to
any problem that involves ﬁnding homologous motifs.

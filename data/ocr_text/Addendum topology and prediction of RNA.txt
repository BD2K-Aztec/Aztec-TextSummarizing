It has come to our attention that several concepts and results
underlying the gfold software presented in our article ‘Topology
and prediction of RNA pseudoknots’ (Reidys et al., 2011) are also
present in earlier work by Bon et al. (2008); Orland and Zee (2002);
Pillsbury et al. (2005b); Vernizzi et al. (2005) and (Pillsbury et al.,
2005a). Here, we brieﬂy examine these works in relation to the
results of our paper.

The classiﬁcation and expansion of pseudoknotted RNA
structures in terms of the topological genus of an associated fatgraph
or double line graph were ﬁrst proposed by Orland and Zee (2002)
and Bon et al. (2008), although fatgraphs were applied to RNA
secondary structures already by Penner and Waterman (1993) and
Penner (2004). The enumerative results initiated by Orland and Zee
(2002) are based on matrix models, while our generating functions
are derived Via representation theory (Zagier, 1995). Enumeration
results on RNA structures according to genus were already obtained
by Vernizzi et al. (2005), again using the formal framework of
the matrix model. Genus as well as other topological invariants of
fatgraphs were introduced and studied as descriptors of proteins in
Penner et al. (2010).

Pillsbury et al. (2005a) report recursion relations of time
complexity 0(N6) to generate RNA structures of genus one in the
context of an RNA folding algorithm that is substantially different
from our algorithm gf 0 1d. Aside from not incorporating loop-
based energy models, gf 0 1d is not restricted to genus one RNA
structures. The four basic irreducible shadows of genus one in
Theorem 2.3 of our paper appeared ﬁrst in Ben et al. (2008);
Pillsbury et al. (2005b). The shadows of Reidys et al. (2011) are
derived from (i) the notion of irreducibility formulated by Kleitman
(1970) and (ii) the work on pseudoknot shapes by Jin and Reidys
(2009); Reidys and Wang (2010). Irreducibility is equivalent to the
concept of primitiVity introduced by Bon et al. (2008), inspired by
the work of Dyson (1949).

The equation to compute the genus of a fatgraph is classical going
back to Euler (1752) and was ﬁrst applied in the context representing
RNA structures by Orland and Zee (2002) and Bon et al. (2008).

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

AdditiVity of genus under topological sums is elementary (Massey,
1967) and for reducible and nested RNA structures ﬁrst discussed
by Bon et al. (2008). Our Equations (2.1), (2.2) and (2.4) are thus
textbook knowledge. Lemma 2.1 is also well known and was used
e.g. by Penner and Waterman (1993) and Bon et al. (2008).

Abstract

Motivation: The HHsearch algorithm, implementing a hidden Markov model (HMM)—HMM align—
ment method, has shown excellent alignment performance in the so—called twilight zone (target—
template sequence identity with ~20%). However, an optimal alignment by HHsearch may contain
small to large errors, leading to poor structure prediction if these errors are located in important
structural elements.

Results: HHalign—Kbest server runs a full pipeline, from the generation of suboptimal HMM—HMM
alignments to the evaluation of the best structural models. In the HHsearch framework, it imple—
ments a novel algorithm capable of generating k—best HMM—HMM suboptimal alignments rather
than only the optimal one. For large proteins, a directed acyclic graph—based implementation re—
duces drastically the memory usage. Improved alignments were systematically generated among
the top k suboptimal alignments. To recognize them, corresponding structural models were sys—
tematically generated and evaluated with Qmean score. The method was benchmarked over 420
targets from the SCOP30 database. In the range of HHsearch probability of 20—99%, average quality
of the models (TM—score) raised by 4.1—16.3% and 8.0—21.0% considering the top 1 and top 10 best
models, respectively.

1 Introduction

 

Automated protein structure prediction has been Widely used for
biological research in recent years. HHsearch is among the fastest
and most accurate tool for remote homology detection and target—
template alignment by using a hidden Markov model (HMM) pair—
wise alignment method (Hildebrand et 61]., 2009; Séding, 2005).
Despite its high performance, an optimal alignment often contains

small to large errors, especially in the position and length of gaps.
Usually, structural biologists correct these errors manually using
back and forth examination of the alignments and of the resulting
structural models. This task becomes particularly tedious When
target—template sequence identities are low and hampers the devel—
opment of fully automated pipelines able to generate accurate struc—
tural models.

HHalign-Kbest

In this work, we present a tool integrating suboptimal technique
within the Viterbi algorithm of HHsearch program to generate sub—
optimal alignments. This interest of suboptimal exploration has pre—
viously been shown for the prediction of membrane protein
topology (Brown and Golod, 2010) and in sequence—HMM pairwise
alignments (Becker et 61]., 2007). We first studied 26 targets from the
CASP10 TBM dataset (template—based modeling) (Huang et 61].,
2014) to test the algorithms. The SCOP30 database (sequence iden—
tity in the range of 5—30%, Fox et 61]., 2014) was then used as a
benchmark to define the conditions in which the strongest increase
in model accuracy could be expected from the use of the HHalign—
Kbest server.

2 Methods

Our k—best Viterbi algorithms were implemented in the latest pack—
age HHsuite 2.0.16, in which four files were modified: hhhit.C im-
plementing the algorithms and hhhit.h, hhalign.C and hhdecl.h in
which the parameters and configurations were adjusted.

To set up the method, two sets of target domains were chosen
out of the 99 real targets in the CASP10 TBM category. Set A con—
tains target domains containing segment(s) that HHpredA did not
predict well but some other tools did (13 targets). As a control, set B
contains 13 target domains randomly selected from the set for which
HHpredA performed very well (65 targets) (Supplementary Method
S1). The SCOP30 benchmark set was generated using the SCOP30
database (Fox et 61]., 2014) (sequence identity in the range 5—30%),
we randomly selected 70 non—redundant superfamily pairs in six
ranges of HHsearch probabilities ((0,20%); [20%,90%);
[90%,95%); [95%,99%); [99%,100%); [100%]) (Supplementary
Method S2, the results for the range (0, 20%) only discussed in the
Supplementary Materials).

3 Results

The Viterbi algorithm (for pair HMMs) of HHsearch is a hybrid be—
tween standard Viterbi and pairwise alignment algorithms and
uses a dynamical programming matrix of three dimensions: target
HMM length (noted as m), template HMM length (n) and the num-
ber of pair—state types (N :5) (deing, 2005). To obtain k—best
paths, a natural extension is to add another dimension of length [a
to this three—dimensional matrix. This fourth dimension stores an
ordered top—k scores and can be calculated by an N—way merge sort
efficiently. This matrix—based k—best Viterbi algorithm has both a
theoretical space complexity and time complexity of O(N“‘/e“'m“‘n).
Since the memory usage limits the application of the matrix-
based method, we developed the directed acyclic graph—based algo—
rithm. Based on the same principle, dynamical allocation of memory
is used, which gives an opportunity to prune useless paths and
nodes. This method requires dramatically less memory while taking
only slightly longer time (Supplementary Results S1 and S2).
CASP10 sets were used to evaluate whether suboptimal alignments
could correct misaligned segment(s) in set A targets without degrading
the accuracy of nearly perfect alignments of set B. We compared
(sub)optimal alignments to a reference structural alignment calculated
from the superimposition between the template and query PDB struc—
tures using TM—align (Zhang and Skolnick, 2005). Qloc score was
used to report the accuracy of an alignment [from 0 to 1 indicating
from wrong to correct, see Supplementary Method S4 (Sadreyev and
Grishin, 2003)]. Figure 1A shows an example of suboptimal align—
ments for a target CASP10 set A (see Section 2), where the suboptimal

Fig. 1. (A) Example of suboptimal alignments obtained for CASP10 target
T0651D1 over the template 2bjd_A. The positions of two strands were cor-
rectly predicted in suboptimal alignments N.398 and N.485 but not in the opti-
mal Viterbi alignment. TM-align provides a gold standard to which these
alignments can be compared. (B) Average percentage increase of TM-score
for a domain modelled on template of the same superfamily as referenced by
SCOP30. Five categories were defined according to the HHsearch probability
containing 70 non-redundant cases each. Results are reported for the first
model (top 1 in purple), the best among the first 10 models (top 10 in ma-
genta) and the best among all suboptimal models (‘top_all’ in red)

N.398 (Qloc:0.860) corrected the second beta sheet (red), while
N.485 (Qloc: 0.835) corrected the first one (blue) perfectly in com-
parison with the Viterbi optimal alignment (Qloc : 0.722) (see details
in Supplementary Fig. S6). Using a procedure combining Modeller
(Eswar et 61]., 2006) to generate models for each suboptimal alignment
and Qmean Zscore to evaluate model quality (Benkert et 61]., 2011),
the suboptimal alignments in Figure 1A could be discriminated
(Supplementary Fig. S6C). N.398 and N.485 led to better models with
TM—score (average TM—score of 20 models for each (sub)optimal align-
ment) 0.646 and 0.652, respectively, in comparison to Viterbi align-
ment TM—score 0.585 (Supplementary Fig. 87B). No loss of accuracy
was observed for set B (Supplementary Fig. S5).

To benchmark HHalign—Kbest, 70 pairs of models/templates ex—
tracted from SCOP30 database were randomly selected in every six
ranges of HHsearch probabilities (see Section 2). Pairs could be a
posteriori divided into hard and easy cases depending on the TM—
score of the Viterbi model, below or above 50%, respectively
(Zhang and Skolnick, 2004). TM—scores were improved by 4.1—
6.5% (top 1) and 8.0—12.7% (top 10) for HHsearch probabilities in
the range 90—99%. The improvements increased up to 16.3% (top
1) and 21.0% (top 10) for the range 20—90%. Above 99%, there
were almost no hard cases, and HHalign—Kbest could still make
minor improvements although it is not in the scope of use of the
method (Fig. 1B, Supplementary Fig. 128, Table 3). More details
about scores, results analysis and server usage are provided in
Supplementary Figures 85—811 and Supplementary Discussion. As a
general algorithm, HHalign-Kbest may be integrated in alternative
frameworks for model generation such as M4T to consider multiple
templates (Fernandez—Fuentes et 61]., 2007) and with alternative
evaluation scores to better recognize the best models from the
‘top_all’ k—best suboptimal alignments (k = 500).

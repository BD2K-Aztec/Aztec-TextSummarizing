ABSTRACT

Motivation: In the field of glycomics research, several different tech-
niques are used for structure elucidation. Although multiple techniques
are often used to increase confidence in structure assignments, most
glycomics databases allow storing of only a single type of experimental
data. In addition, the methods used to prepare a sample for analysis is
seldom recorded making it harder to reproduce the analytical data and
results.

Results: We have extended the freely available EUROCarbDB frame-
work to allow the submission of experimental data and the reporting of
several orthogonal experimental datasets. The features aim to increase
the understandability and reproducibility of the reported data.
Availability and implementation: The installation with the glycan
standards is available at http://glycomics.ccrc.uga.edu/eurocarbl.
The source code of the project is available at https://code.google.
com/p/ucdb/.

Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at
Bioinformatics online.

1 INTRODUCTION

In the past two and a half decades, several databases for storing
glycan structures and associated meta information (e.g. biological
source, species and publications) have been developed (Campbell
et al., 2014). Among them, the CarbBank database was the ﬁrst
large publicly available database of glycan structures (Doubet and
Albersheim, 1992; Doubet et al., 1989). Although no experimental
data were stored in this database, the experimental techniques
used for the identiﬁcation of glycan structures were recorded.
After the funding for CarbBank was discontinued, several
independent new databases were created, often by importing
most or all of the CarbBank data and sometimes adding experi-
mental data. F or example, GLYCOSCIENCES.de (Liitteke et al.,
2006) and the Bacterial Carbohydrate Structure Database
(Egorova and Toukach, 2014) contain nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) data that have been extracted from the litera-
ture for different glycan structures. The Consortium for
Functional Glycomics (CF G) created its own set of databases

(Raman et al., 2006) to store the data generated by the consor-
tium, including mass spectrometry (MS) proﬁling data and glycan
array data, revealing the binding of glycans to various biomol—
ecules. Following a similar goal, GlycoBase [developed by the
NIBRT group (Campbell et al., 2008)] stores the high-perfor-
mance liquid chromatography (HPLC) data generated by that
group. All of these specialized databases have been implemented
for use by a speciﬁc research group or consortium and do not
allow submission of diverse types of experimental data by
outsiders.

In 2005 under the direction of Claus-Wilhelm von der Lieth,
the EUROCarbDB (von der Lieth et al., 2011) project was
started. The aim of the project was the establishment of a pub-
licly available database framework for the creation of a network
of homogeneous databases, allowing research groups worldwide
to upload annotated glycan structures and data obtained by MS,
NMR and HPLC experiments. The basic idea was to enable
each research group to create and populate their own database
while facilitating the sharing and exchange of information
among databases. The long-term goal was that by providing a
free and easy-to-use framework, the heterogeneous landscape of
glycan databases developed before 2005 could be systematically
replaced by a set of homogeneous databases that contains ex-
perimental data with annotated glycan structures. By the end of
the project in 2010, the source code of the database prototype
that had been installed at the European Bioinformatics Institute
(EBI) was released. This code has been subsequently used as the
basis for several database projects, including the UniCarb—DB
project (Hayes et al., 2011) and the UniCarbKB (Campbell
et al., 2011) databases. Although storing experimental data
along with the glycan structures, biological annotation, and
their literature references was a fundamental goal of the
EUROCarbDB project, approaches to storing techniques for
sample preparation and methods of experimental analysis had
not been developed.

Here we describe the application of different experimental
techniques to establish the structures of several glycan standards
provided by the CF G (Fig. 1) and the setup of a EUROCarbDB
node providing public access to the produced data. We also
introduce a novel way to represent the experimental data and
meta data within a EuroCarbDB node. In the original implemen-
tation of EUROCarbDB, each unique structure was linked with
a set of experiments. However, the information required to de-
termine whether the separate experiments in a set were

Fig. 1. Three N—glycan and eight O-glycan compounds have been
provided by the CFG as analytical standards. Each is displayed using
the CFG cartoon representation together with the name used to identify
each structure

performed using exactly the same sample or performed using
different samples that happened to contain the same structure
was unavailable. This critical information is required to evaluate
the experimental data and assess the reliability of the resulting
structural annotation. Conﬁdence in a structural annotation is
greater when it is based on the application of varied orthogonal
methods to the same sample rather than on the analysis of sev-
eral similar samples, which may contain different contaminants.

2 METHODS

In all, 100 ug of each glycan standard was prepared for MS analysis.
O-linked glycan standards were released from their threonine linker
by reductive beta elimination, neutralized and passed over a strong
cation-exchange resin, as previously described (Orlando et al., 2009).
The O-glycans were permethylated (Ciucanu and Kerek, 1984), and
dissolved (0.1 ug/uL) in either lmM sodium hydroxide or lmM lithium
hydroxide, in 50% aqueous methanol, before direct infusion into a linear
ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with an Orbitrap FT detector
(LTQ Orbitrap XL, Thermo-Fisher) by nanospray ionization (NSI) at
0.4 uL/min flow rate. A full mass spectrum was continuously recorded by
the instrument for 20sec, and glycan peaks were then manually selected
for fragmentation using 35% collision-induced dissociation (CID). Each
resulting MS / MS spectra was also continuously detected and recorded for
20 sec and MS3 fragmentation was performed when necessary using the
same time and fragmentation energy. All scans for each measurement
were averaged into a single RAW ﬁle and converted to szML using
MSConvert (Chambers et al., 2012) and imported to GlycoWorkbench to
facilitate structural annotation of fragmentation pathways and thereby
conﬁrm structural assignments.

full MS scan was recorded in FT mode, and all peaks 3-fold above noise
level were fragmented in the ion trap by CID with 35% collision energy.
Collected spectra were converted from RAW to szML format using
MSConvert and imported to GlycoWorkbench (Damerell et al., 2012)

was divided into aliquots and analyzed by NMR without further

oligoglycosyl alditols, and again after permethylation and selection of
ions formed by complexation with Li+ and Na+

 

to facilitate structural annotation fragmentation pathways and thereby
conﬁrm structural assignments.

For NMR, the samples were deuterium exchanged by dissolution in
D20 (99.9% D, Aldrich) and lyophilization. The deuterium-exchanged
N— and O-glycans were each dissolved in D20 (80 uL, 99.96% D,
Cambridge Isotope Laboratories), and a small volume of 1% acetone
(5 uL for N—glycans and 2 uL for O—glycans) was added as an internal
standard before transferring the samples to a 3 mm Shigemi NMR tube.
1-D proton, total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY), nuclear
overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) and rotating frame nuclear
overhauser effect spectroscopy (ROESY) NMR spectra were recorded
with water presaturation. All NMR data, including gradient enhanced
Correlation spectroscopy (COSY) and Heteronuclear single-quantum
correlation spectroscopy (HSQC) spectra, were acquired at a sample tem-
perature of 25°C using a Varian Inova-600 MHz spectrometer. The
number of transients was 32 for 1-D proton and 2-D TOCSY and
NOESY experiments, 16 for gCOSY and 256 for gHSQC. Mixing time
was 80 ms for TOCSY, 300 ms for NOESY and 200 ms for ROESY.
Chemical shifts were measured relative to internal acetone
(6H = 2.218 ppm, 6C = 33.00 ppm) Wishart et al., 1995).

3 RESULTS

In this paper, we introduce a novel way to represent the experi-
mental data within a EUROCarbDB database. The modiﬁed
database allows the data obtained by different analytical meth-
ods using a single sample to be combined into an experiment,
thereby increasing conﬁdence in structural annotations inferred
by combining the orthogonal data. These modiﬁcations increase
the efﬁcacy of EUROCarbDB for scientists using diverse tech-
niques to assign glycan structures.

The design of the experiments described in the Section 2
is shown in Figures 2 and 3. Each experiment consists of a
series of laboratory tasks, indicated by boxes in the diagram.
These tasks are deﬁned as protocols, which are recorded in the
database by storing the protocol name, a short description and a
reference to a Web page in the Glycoscience Protocol
Online Database (http://jcggdb.jp/GlycoPOD/) or in our wiki
(http ://glycomics .ccrc.uga.edu/GlycomicsWiki/Main_Page).

Fig. 4. The design of an experiment is a multistep process. It starts by
deﬁning protocols, which are general but detailed descriptions of labora-
tory tasks, including lists of any parameters that may vary. Protocol vari-
ants are then instantiated in the context of an experiment template, which
speciﬁes a linear or branched sequence of protocol variants. In the Figure,
arrows leading from protocol variants to protocols represent instantiation.
These steps involve the explicit speciﬁcation of protocol parameter values.
An experiment template thus deﬁned can then be instantiated as an actual
experiment (arrows from experiment to experiment template represent in-
stantiation). Each experiment encapsulates all of the MS, HPLC and/or
NMR data acquired during a discrete analysis of a speciﬁc sample along
with the metadata describing how these data were obtained

 

 

 

 

 

 

These Web pages contain step-by-step descriptions of the experi-
mental procedures, including the necessary materials and instru-
mentation. In addition to the Web page references for each
protocol, a list of protocol parameters can be stored to capture
variations of each standard procedure described in the Web
pages. For example, the incubation time, temperature or pH of
a chemical reaction may vary from one experiment to another.
These speciﬁc protocol parameter values, together with the
complete but more general description in the Web pages, fully

describe the experimental methods used to obtain each dataset.
The availability of this detailed information increases
the analyst’s capacity to understand, evaluate and reproduce
the experimental results.

To minimize the work necessary to create an experiment and
upload experimental data, we created several template mechan-
isms for the creation of an experiment (Fig. 4). First, the user
creates a protocol by providing its name, description, Web page
and a list of parameters with their units of measurement (more de-
tails can be found in part I of the Supplementary Material).
Speciﬁc values for these parameters are assigned later. The
example shown as scheme in Figure 3 and as screenshot in
Figure 5 ‘N—Glycan Mass Spectrometer Analysis’ includes four
protocols.

In the second step, the user creates speciﬁc implementations of
these protocols called protocol variants, which encapsulate explicit
values for each parameter (for more details see the
Supplementary Material part II). In Figure 2, ‘Mass spectrom-
eter analysis Na+ ’ and ‘Mass spectrometer analysis Li+ ’ are
two protocol variants of the protocol ‘Mass spectrometer analysis’
specifying Li + and Na + , respectively, as values for the protocol
parameter adduct. The advantage of these templates is that
creating a new variation of a protocol does not require the
user to reenter all the information. Rather, a protocol variant
is created as a speciﬁc instance of the more general protocol
and distinguished by explicit protocol parameters values.
The instantiated protocol variants are placed in a user-deﬁned
sequence called an experimental template, which fully describes
a speciﬁc series of tasks used to prepare and analyze a sample.
Each actual use of the experiment template to analyze a speciﬁc
sample is documented by instantiating a new experiment.
The data produced by an experiment are thus associated with
the metadata speciﬁed by the above procedure, facilitating the
upload and archival of the annotated data. Each new experiment
is created with a few button clicks, which retrieve and integrate
all the relevant information about the experiment and its
protocols, including protocol parameter values. Then, it is easy
to associate the speciﬁc dataset or datasets that were generated

of an experiment a similar summary is available. Each summary includes
the name of the protocol (e.g. Aliquoting), its description, a link to the
Web page describing the protocol and a list of variable parameters, each
documented with a name, description, unit of measurements and value

by the experiment with a well-deﬁned sequence of parameterized
protocols.

The concept of an experiment allows users to upload different
kinds of evidence (experimental data) used to assign a structure
to the analyzed glycan. Different types of evidence for glycan
samples include quantiﬁcation data, MS data, HPLC data and
NMR data.

Figure 5 shows a screenshot of the Web interface after
uploading the experimental data generated by analysis of the
N—glycan CF G 121 standard. The experiment itself (diagrammed
in Figure 3) consists of tasks displayed as a hierarchical tree in the
lower part of the image. These include the protocols used to
prepare and analyze the sample together with the experimental
data and the annotation data, which can be retrieved by the user.
Expanding this tree representation provides an increasingly
detailed view of the results of executing each protocol, ultimately
showing the dataset produced by the ﬁnal analytical protocol
(e. g. a ﬁle containing mass spectral data) and the annotation ﬁle
for that data. Figure 6 shows an example protocol with its name,
the description, the link to the Web page and the parameters with
their values.

4 DISCUSSION

The EUROCarbDB database framework is an extremely useful
resource for scientists seeking to create their own database to
store analytical Glycomics data. We have extended the original
EUROCarbDB code to collect and associate the different types
of analytical data obtained by analyzing single samples, adding
conﬁdence to the structural annotations deduced from that data.
The enhanced code simpliﬁes the generation, storage and
retrieval of complete descriptions of the experiment process,
facilitating the interpretation and reproduction of the experi-
ment. We have installed a EUROCarbDB node with these
enhancements on our server and populated this node with
carefully annotated experimental data generated using several
standard glycans provided by the CFG. This database and its
contents are freely available at http://glycomics.ccrc.uga.edu/
eurocarb/. In addition, we encourage users to download this
easy-to-use database so they can organize and archive their

own glycomics datasets and associate them with metadata
describing the procedures they use to generate that data.
The EUROCarbDB source code is available at https://code.
google.com/p/ucdb/.

The fundamental utility of the tools described here lies in
their capacity to dramatically increase the public availability of
well-documented glycoanalytic data. Use of these tools will allow
researchers around the globe to download and examine experi-
mental datasets and structural annotations created by other
scientists, rigorously evaluate those datasets and faithfully repro-
duce the experimental protocols that were originally used to
generate them. To the best of our knowledge, no other publicly
available database offers this kind of representation and this level
of detail. To make this representation more informative, we also
link each protocol to a Web page (GlycoPOD or our wiki) where
the creator of the protocol can provide a more detailed descrip-
tion of the experimental methods used. These wiki pages can be
accessed via a hyperlink in the details section of the experimental
tree (Fig. 6).

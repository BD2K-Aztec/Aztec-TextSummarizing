ABSTRACT

Summary: Picante is a software package that provides a
comprehensive set of tools for analyzing the phylogenetic and
trait diversity of ecological communities. The package calculates
phylogenetic diversity metrics, performs trait comparative analyses,
manipulates phenotypic and phylogenetic data, and performs tests
for phylogenetic signal in trait distributions, community structure and
species interactions.

Availability: Picante is a package for the R statistical language
and environment written in R and C, released under a GPL v2
open-source license, and freely available on the web (http://picante
.r-forge.r-project.org) and from CRAN (http://cran.r-project.org).

1 INTRODUCTION

Incorporating phylogenetic information into ecology is enlightening
because it allows ecological questions to be addressed in an
evolutionary context, leading to a deeper understanding of
the processes that give rise to patterns of biological diversity
(Webb et al., 2002). Ecophylogenetic research also has numerous
applications such as designating conservation priorities, predicting
species invasiveness and estimating the effects of biodiversity on
ecosystem functioning (Cavender—Bares et al., 2009).

In this rapidly expanding ﬁeld, two barriers have prevented
ecologists from incorporating phylogenetic information into their
own work. First, many ecophylogenetic methods are not available
in open-source software packages, preventing end-users from
modifying methods to suit their own purposes. Second, the available
tools are implemented in multiple software packages, each with
unique learning curves and data formatting requirements. Here, we
describe a software package designed to overcome these limitations
by implementing the most commonly used ecophylogenetics tools in
a single open-source software package for the R statistical language
and environment (R Development Core Team, 2009).

2 DESCRIPTION

2.1 Data manipulation and visualization

Picante uses the extensive data manipulation and data import/export
functions included in R. Picante includes functions for reading and
writing ecological data in formats used by other software packages
including Phylocom (Webb et al., 2008b), allowing these tools to
be integrated into data analysis workﬂows in the R environment.
By using the basic R plotting functions along with speciﬁcally
designed functions in picante and other R packages (e. g. ape: Paradis
et al. , 2004), phylogenetic patterns of trait evolution and community
structure can easily be visualized.

2.2 Phylogenetic diversity and community structure

With the growing availability of phylogenies for entire ecological
communities, there has been a rapid increase in the development
and application of methods to quantify phylogenetic diversity.
Picante contains functions for calculating the most commonly
used measures of phylogenetic a-diversity (evolutionary relatedness
within ecological communities) including Faith’s phylogenetic
diversity (PD, the sum of all branch lengths separating taxa in a
community; Faith 1992), the taxonomic distinctness index (Vane-
Wright et al. , 1991), the mean pairwise phylogenetic distance (MPD)
and mean nearest taxon distance (MNTD) within a community
(Webb et al., 2008b), the phylogenetic species diversity metrics
of Helmus et al. (2007b) [phylogenetic species richness (PSR),
evenness (PSE), variance (PSV), and clustering (PSC)], quadratic
entropy (Rao, 1982), and species co-occurrence and phylogenetic
relatedness regressions (Slingsby and Verboom, 2006). Picante
also calculates widely used measures of phylogenetic ,B-diversity
(evolutionary relatedness between communities), including the
phylogenetic S¢renson index (Bryant et al., 2008), the UniFrac
distance metric (Lozupone and Knight, 2005), and MPD and
MNTD between communities (Webb et al. , 2008b). The availability
of this suite of tools in a single package makes it easy to
conduct comparative analyses of phylogenetic diversity on the same
community dataset, which is important since different diversity
metrics are sensitive to different aspects of the structure of ecological
communities (Cadotte et al., 2010).

Measures of phylogenetic oz— and ,B-diversity can be compared to
null expectations of community assembly and evolution to estimate

community structure (i.e. whether communities are composed
of closely related species or distantly related species). Picante
performs numerous permutation procedures not available in other
software packages including generating random communities by
drawing taxa from a species pool, rearrangements of the community
matrix preserving sample species richnesses and species occurrence
frequencies and randomizations of phylogenies. When used with
the various phylogenetic diversity metrics, these permutations
test different null hypotheses of community structure and allow
comparisons of phylogenetic diversity among communities that vary
in species richness (Kembel, 2009).

2.3 Environmental correlates of phylogenetic
community structure

Picante implements several methods to test for environmental
drivers of phylogenetic community structure. First, picante
calculates sample-based rarefaction curves of PSR (Helmus et al.,
2007b), allowing statistically valid comparisions of phylogenetic
diversity among communities that differ in sampling intensity, size,
area, etc. (Gotelli and Colwell, 2001). Second, picante performs
species-environmental regressions (Helmus et al., 2007a) to test if
closely related species respond to environmental variation in the
same way and to separate determinants of phylogenetic community
structure. Third, phylogenetic ,B-diversity metrics can be used
by methods in other R packages (e.g. vegan: Oksanen et al.,
2009) to perform multivariate analyses of community-environment
relationships including Mantel tests, phylogenetic clustering of
communities and phylo-ordinations (Webb et al., 2008a).

2.4 Phylogenetic signal in species traits and
interactions

Phylogenetic signal is the tendency for taxa that share a common
ancestor to resemble each other in how they look, behave and with
whom they interact. Phylogenetic signal in the niches and traits
of species violates the assumption that data points are statistically
independent; techniques such as phylogenetically independent
contrasts are available to overcome this non-independence (Paradis
et al., 2004). However, methods to quantify the amount of
phylogenetic signal in phenotypic traits are not widely available.

Picante performs two kinds of statistical analyses of phylogenetic
signal. The ﬁrst is the calculation of the K statistic (Blomberg
et al., 2003), a Brownian motion-based metric of the strength
of phylogenetic signal. Statistical signiﬁcance of K is estimated
by permuting trait values across the tips of a phylogenetic tree.
The second implemented analysis is a phylogenetic regression of
interaction strengths between species (e.g. plants and pollinators:
Ives and Godfray, 2006) using an Ornstein—Uhlenbeck evolutionary
model. Data on species traits can be included in the phylogenetic
regression to estimate the relative contribution of traits versus
phylogeny in explaining species interactions.

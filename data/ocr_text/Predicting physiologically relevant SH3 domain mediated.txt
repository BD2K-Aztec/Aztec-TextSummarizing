Abstract

Motivation: Many intracellular signaling processes are mediated by interactions involving peptide
recognition modules such as SH3 domains. These domains bind to small, linear protein sequence
motifs which can be identified using high—throughput experimental screens such as phage display.
Binding motif patterns can then be used to computationally predict protein interactions mediated
by these domains. While many protein—protein interaction prediction methods exist, most do not
work with peptide recognition module mediated interactions or do not consider many of the known
constraints governing physiologically relevant interactions between two proteins.

Results: A novel method for predicting physiologically relevant SH3 domain—peptide mediated
protein—protein interactions in S. cerevisae using phage display data is presented. Like some previ—
ous similar methods, this method uses position weight matrix models of protein linear motif prefer—
ence for individual SH3 domains to scan the proteome for potential hits and then filters these hits
using a range of evidence sources related to sequence—based and cellular constraints on protein
interactions. The novelty of this approach is the large number of evidence sources used and the
method of combination of sequence based and protein pair based evidence sources. By combining
different peptide and protein features using multiple Bayesian models we are able to predict high
confidence interactions with an overall accuracy of 0.97.

1 Introduction

Protein—protein interactions (PPIs) are physical associations between
protein pairs in a specific biological context. Their knowledge provides
important insights into the functioning of a cell. Previously, experimen-
tal detection of PPIs was limited to labor intensive techniques such as
co-immunoprecipitation or affinity chromatography (Skrabanek et al.,
2008). Though the detected PPIs are largely accurate, these techniques
are difficult to apply to whole proteome analysis. This led to the devel—
opment of various high—throughput PPI detection protocols such as
mass—spectrometry combined with affinity—purification, yeast two—

hybrid and next—generation sequencing to detect PPIs at whole genome
level (Braun et 61]., 2013; Davy et 61]., 2001; Ito et 61]., 2001; McCraith
et al., 2000; Rain et al., 2001; Uetz et al., 2000; Yu et al., 2011).
However, genome—scale methods are also highly resource intensive and
single projects and techniques do not cover all known protein inter-
actions. Further, they only cover interactions in one organism at a
time. Computational approaches designed to predict reliable and novel
PPIs based on experimental interaction datasets have the advantages
that they are inexpensive to apply to genomes, including those that are

infeasible to tackle experimentally and this motivates their further de—
velopment (Skrabanek et al., 2008).

Multiple kinds of protein—protein interactions exist. We focus on
interactions involving peptide recognition modules (PRMs), in particu—
lar Src homology three (SH3), which are important in many cellular
signaling processes. These domains bind to small, linear sequence
motifs (peptides) within proteins (Pawson and Nash, 2003). SH3 do—
mains are approximately 60 amino acids long with five beta strands
organized into two perpendicular beta sheets interrupted by a 3—10
helix (Pawson and Gish, 1992). They often bind to proline-rich regions
and multiple classes have been recognized based on their binding
motifs. Class I SH3 domains bind to [R/K]xxPxxP and class II bind to
PxxPx[R/K] motifs (Mayer, 2001). They can also bind to proline—free
regions containing arginine or lysine (Tong et al., 2002). SH3 domains
are involved in many regulatory or signaling processes, including

endocytosis (Tonikian et al., 2009), actin cytoskeleton regulation
(Pawson and Schlessingert, 1993) and tyrosine kinase pathways
(Schlessinger, 1994). Experimental methods such as phage display
(Tong et al., 2002; Tonikian et al., 2008, 2009) and peptide microarray
(Hu et al., 2004; MacBeath and Schreiber, 2000; Stiffler et al., 2007)
have been used to identify the peptides binding to PRMs.

The computational problem under focus in this work is to use the
SH3 domain binding peptides identified from phage display experi-
ments to predict SH3 domain mediated PPIs in S. cerevisiae. A straight—
forward approach is to construct position weight matrices (PWMs)
from phage peptides and scan the whole proteome for potential bind—
ing sites in target proteins using some threshold score (Obenauer et al.,
2003). The problem with this simple approach is the lack of contextual
information, for example, the predicted binding site might not be ac—
cessible or it might lie within a structured part of protein (e.g. domain).

Predicting SH3 domain-peptide interactions

1867

 

Tonikian et al. (2009) addressed this problem by combining in vitro
(phage display, peptide array screening) and in vivo (yeast two—hybrid)
data to predict SH3 domain mediated PPIs in yeast. Verifying inter-
actions using multiple experimental techniques improves the PPI confi-
dence but it is both time and resource consuming. Lam et al. (2010)
combined comparative and structural genomic features with PWMs to
reduce the number of false binding sites. But they did not consider that
PPIs are inﬂuenced by many cellular constraints including that interact—
ing proteins must be in close proximity and should be part of same pro—
cess. Peptide—only features are not sufficient for predicting high
confidence physiologically relevant PRM mediated PPIs with binding
site resolution. Jansen et al. (2003), Rhodes et al. (2005), Li et al.
(2008), Zhang et al. (2012) and others considered multiple types of cel—
lular constraints and combined different evidence sources for PPI pre—
diction, but their approaches are designed for full length proteins and
cannot be used to predict PRM mediated PPIs, including identification
of binding sites. More recently, Chen et al. (2015) combined limited
number of peptide and protein features for predicting PRM mediated
PPIs in humans. Their protein features are based on one of the earlier
the works in the field of ensemble PPI prediction (Iansen et 61]., 2003).
Since then many advances have been made in improving the perform-
ance of individual features in PPI prediction (Reimand et 61]., 2012).
Also, their method is not compatible with high-throughput binding
peptide data, such as from phage display. Here, we make use of a larger
set of evidence sources to predict SH3—mediated PPIs and their binding
sites than has been collected previously and combine peptide level and
protein level features in a single predictor.

2 Approach

PRM mediated PPIs do not occur in isolation in the cell. They are inﬂu-
enced by different sequence—based and cellular constraints. For ex—
ample, SH3 domains can only bind surface accessible regions,
interacting proteins must be present in same cellular compartment, and
proteins in the same biological process with correlated gene expression
profiles are more likely to interact compared to randomly selected pro—
tein pairs. Thus, diverse types of information can be used to help pre—
dict physiologically relevant protein interactions. In our method,
PWMs constructed using peptides from phage display experiments are
used to scan the yeast proteome for potential targets. Peptide features:
disorder, surface accessibility, peptide conservation and structural con—
tact are combined using na'ive Bayesian integration to score the PWM
targets. Another nai've Bayesian model is used to combine protein fea—
tures: cellular location, biological process, molecular function, gene ex—
pression and sequence signature to score the same targets. Scores from
both peptide and protein classifiers are then combined using Bayes the—
orem to predict physiologically relevant SH3 domain mediated PPIs in
yeast. Figure 1 shows the work ﬂow of our PRM mediated PPI predic-
tion pipeline.

3 Methods

3.1 Position weight matrix and proteome scanning

Position weight matrices (PWMs) are statistical models for represent—
ing sequence motifs. They are real valued m X n matrices, where m is
the number of amino acids and n is the motif length. They are con—
structed using peptides from phage display experiments and then used
to scan a protein sequences to find motif matches above a certain P—
value threshold (Pizzi et 61]., 2011; Wu et 61]., 2000). Also, significant
positions within the PWMs are identified and used in scoring peptide

features: disordered region, surface accessibility and peptide conserva—
tion (see supplementary material for details).

3.2 Peptide features

3.2.1 Disordered region

PRMs bind to small peptide stretches containing a specific motif.
Specifically interactions between proteins having SH3 domains and
their targets are often mediated by proline rich peptide sequences
containing PXXP, [WK]xxPxxP, PxxPx[IUK] motifs. Proline dis-
rupts the secondary structure of a protein by inhibiting the forma-
tion of helices and sheets (Morgan and Rubenstein, 2013). Also,
small linear motifs tend to accumulate in disordered regions of pro—
tein (Beltrao and Serrano, 2005; Davey et 61]., 2010; Linding et 61].,
2003). Beltrao and Serrano showed that the binding sites of SH3 do—
mains in S. cerevisiae often lie within the disordered regions of a
protein (Beltrao and Serrano, 2005). DISOPRED, a neural network
based tool, is used to estimate the probability of the protein region
being disordered.

where p,- is the disorder score of the ith significant amino acid (either
one for disordered or zero for ordered) and N is the number of sig—
nificant amino acids in the binding site.

3.2.2 Surface accessibility

Sequences present on a protein’s surface are more accessible to bind—
ing by SH3 domains than those that are buried inside a protein
structure. The degree of solvent—accessible surface area of amino
acid residues in a sequence indicates its level of exposure and is
measured in terms of relative solvent accessibility (RSA) (Adamczak
et 61]., 2004; Lam et 61]., 2010). We use SABLE (Adamczak et 61].,
2004) to predict RSA values for target sequences. It uses a neural
network based nonlinear regression model for continuous approxi—
mation of RSA values. Amino acid residues with RSA value 2 25%
are considered to be exposed and available for binding (Adamczak
et al., 2004).

where p,- is the surface accessibility score of ith significant amino acid
and N is the number of significant amino acids in the binding site.

3.2.3 Peptide conservation

Biologically relevant peptides binding to yeast SH3 domains are
more likely to be conserved in other yeast species (Beltrao and
Serrano, 2005; Davey et 61]., 2010). For measuring the conservation,
orthologs of S. cerevisiae protein sequences in C. glabrata, D. hanse-
nii, K. lactis, Y. lipolytica, C. albicans, N. crassa and S. pombe (an
optimal set as selected by (Beltrao and Serrano, 2005)) are identified
using INPARANOID (Remm et 61]., 2001). The orthologous se—
quences are then aligned with MAFFT (Katoh et 61]., 2002) and the
unweighted sum—of—pairs method from AL2CO (Pei and Grishin,
2001) is used to estimate the conservation score of each position in
the multiple sequence alignment (Lam et 61]., 2010).

where p,- is the conservation score of the ith significant amino acid
and N is the number of significant amino acids in the binding site.

3.2.4 Structural contact

Known 3—D structures of SH3 domains complexed with peptides can
be used to assess the binding potential of a query SH3 domain and
peptide by reducing residue—residue contacts in 3—D structures to a
binary 2—D contact matrix (Chen et 61]., 2008; Hui and Bader, 2010).
Six yeast SH3—peptide co—complex PDB structures (1N5Z, lSSH,
1ZUK, 2KYM, 2RQW, 2VKN) are used as base models. The Contact
Map Analysis (CMA) tool from the SPACE software suite (Sobolev
et 61]., 2005) is used to reduce the 3—D structures to 2—D contact maps
with residue level contact area for all base models. Query domain and
peptide sequences are aligned with all base models using the
Needleman—Wunsch algorithm and BLOSUM 62 substitution matrix
to calculate the contact distance between aligned residues.

where 6,,- is the normalized contact area of the ith aligned domain
and peptide residues of the jth base model. Alignment gaps in contact
residues will negatively impact the average contact area as only the
aligned residues are used for scoring (a gap at a position associated
with a large residue contact area will reduce the SC score more than
a gap associated with a smaller residue contact area). N is the num—
ber of aligned contact residues.

3.3 Protein features

3.3.1 Cellular location, biological process, molecular function
Physical PPIs require proteins to be in close proximity to each other i.e.
they should co—localize in the same cellular compartment. Also, inter-
acting proteins are more likely to be part of same biological process or
have the same function. The Gene Ontology (GO) contains a hierarchy
of controlled terms describing cellular location, biological process and
molecular function of proteins (The Gene Ontology Consortium,
2000). The functional relationship between two proteins can be quanti—
fied using GO. Semantic similarity can be used to quantify relationships
between different GO terms in an ontology. The higher the semantic
similarity score between GO terms annotated to two proteins, more
likely that they will interact with each other (Jain and Bader, 2010).
Topological Clustering Semantic Similarity (TCSS) (Jain and Bader,
2010) is an accurate semantic similarity measure for PPI prediction. It
normalizes the GO hierarchy before computing semantic similarity, ac—
cording to cutoffs defined in the original TCSS paper.

CC : TCSS(a, b, ontology : C, cutoff : 2.4) (5)
BP : TCSS(a, b, ontology : P, cutoff : 3.5) (6)
MF : TCSS(a, b, ontology : F, cutoff : 3.3) (7)

where a and b are the query proteins and C, P, F are the cellular
component, biological process and molecular function ontologies.

3.3.2 Gene expression

Gene expression as a measure for assessing the confidence and biolo—
gical relevance of high—throughput PPIs is based on the notion that
the cell is optimized to co—express genes if they function together

and if they function together, they are more likely to physically
interact than by chance (Bhardwaj and Lu, 2005; Ge et 61]., 2001;
Grigoriev, 2001; Jansen et 61]., 2002). Most PPI prediction methods
that make use of gene expression profile (GEP) correlation with PPIs
to predict novel interactions (Li et 61]., 2008; Rhodes et 61]., 2005 )
rely on observations from a single expression dataset which can lead
to many false positives and true negatives, as not all genes are ex—
pressed under a particular set of experimental conditions. Using
multiple GEPs clearly improves the performance of a predictor as
shown in Supplementary Figure 81. Correlation coefficients from 86
gene expression profiles from GeneMANIA (Warde—Farley et 61].,
2010) for a given pair of genes are combined using Fisher’s z trans—
formation (Faller, 1981; Jain and Bader, 2010)

where N is the number of profiles and r,- is the Pearson correlation of
the ith profile.

3.3.3 Sequence signature

Sequence signature based PPI prediction methods are based on the
notion that protein domains are correlated with specific functions.
For instance, it has been shown that functionally related proteins
have similar domain composition or they belong to the same ‘do—
main club’ (Jin et 61]., 2009). Information content of co—occurring
InterPro (preiler et 61]., 2001) signatures extracted from sequences
of an experimentally verified set of 22 707 PPIs from DIP (Salwinski
et 61]., 2004) is used to score novel interactions, as described by
Sprinzak and Margalit (2001).

where pi,- is the probability of seeing motifi on one protein and motif
j on other protein in the experimentally verified PPI set, 1),- is the
probability of seeing motif 1' and p,- is the probability of seeing motif
j in the same set.

3.4 Bayesian integration

The objective of a Bayesian PPI prediction model is to estimate the
probability that a given protein pair interacts, conditioned on the
biological evidence in support of that interaction. A na'ive Bayesian
model simplifies this problem by assuming independence between
different types of biological evidence. While modeling the PRM
mediated PPI prediction problem a set of observations are made on
domain—peptides while others are made on full—length proteins.
Assuming that peptide and protein features are independent of
each other, two separate na'ive Bayes models Mpep for peptide fea—
tures and Mpro for protein features are built to independently as—
sess the class probability Y. The posterior probabilities P(Y|Mpep)
and P(Y|Mpro) are combined using Bayes’ theorem (Mitchell, 1997)
(see supplementary material for details).

4 Results
4.1 Model training

The goal is to construct a generalized model which can predict high
confidence, in vivo yeast SH3 domain—peptide physical interactions.

Predicting SH3 domain-peptide interactions

1869

 

To achieve this, both peptide and protein classifiers are trained on
their respective positive and negative datasets. The peptide classifier
is trained on a high confidence set of 628 SH3 domain—peptide inter—
actions in yeast from the MINT database (P1) and an equal number
of randomly selected negative interactions (N1). The protein classi—
fier is trained on a high confidence set of 5215 pairwise yeast PPIs
from the iRefIndex database (P2) and an equal number of randomly
selected negative interactions (N2) (see supplementary material for
details).

4.2 Feature selection
Figure 2 shows the discriminatory power of individual features for
peptide and protein classifiers. Disordered region (DR) and surface
accessibility (SA) perform much better in separating positives from
negatives as compared to structural contact (SC) and peptide conser—
vation (PC). Prediction efficacy of PC is least among the peptide fea—
tures. This is due to the difficulty distinguishing positive and
negative interactions because both of these sets have high conserva—
tion scores caused by the high similarity of protein sequences (and
peptides they contain) in general across different yeast species
(Supplementary Fig. S2). Biological process (BP), cellular component
(CC) and sequence signature (SS) outperform molecular function
(MF) and gene expression (EX) in the protein feature set. Proteins
could have the same molecular function but still belong to different
processes and this could be one of the reasons behind molecular
function feature’s weak performance. Gene expression data alone is
not as powerful as others in discriminating positives from negatives
(Kim et 61]., 2014), which may be due to its moderate correlation
with protein expression (i.e. gene expression may not imply that a
functioning protein will be available for interaction) (Vogel and
Marcotte, 2012).

Highly correlated features can negatively affect the performance of
a naive Bayesian classifier. Maximal information coefficient (MIC) is
used to quantify the correlation between different features. DR and SA
in the peptide feature set and CC and BP in the protein feature set are
correlated with MICs of 0.72 and 0.5 respectively. The effect of correl—
ation on classifier performance is measured by comparing different
models without one of the correlated features. Further, to identify the
feature subset which maximizes the performance of both classifiers, all
possible combinations of features are compared using different

Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) and accuracy (ACC). Peptide
and protein classifiers with all features outperformed other models on
at least one of statistical measure (see supplementary material for
details).

4.3 Model evaluation

Blind validation protocols are used to assess the predictive power of
peptide Mpep and protein Mpro na'ive Bayesian classifiers. The major-
ity of interactions in the P1 dataset are from two peptide array ex—
periments (Landgraf et 61]., 2004; Tonikian et 61]., 2009). This could
lead to an experimental bias therefore, for blind testing, the peptide
classifier is trained using interactions only from peptide array ex—
periments and tested using interactions from all other experiments
(no overlap between training and test datasets). Similarly, to make
an unbiased assessment, the protein classifier was trained using P2
dataset but tested using the 2304 interactions (with no missing infor-
mation) from the core subset of Database of Interacting Proteins
(DIP) (Salwinski et 61]., 2004) that do not overlap the P2 training set
and are based on different filtering criteria compared to the MINT—
inspired score used to select the iRefIndex P2 training set. The DIP
core database includes PPIs derived from both small—scale and large—
scale experiments that have been scored by quality of experimental
methods, occurrence of interaction between paralogs (PVM), prob—
able domain—domain interactions between protein pairs (DPV), and
comparison with expression profiles (EPR) (Salwinski et 61]., 2004).
In a real world prediction scenario, both classifiers are expected to
encounter cases with missing information. Therefore, the perform-
ance of both classifiers is also tested using an unfiltered blind set.
The results are summarized in Table 1. The AUROC for peptide cla—
sifier is 0.92 and ACC lies within the range [0.86, 0.87]. The protein
classifier has an AUROC within the range [0.92, 0.94] and ACC is
between [0.80, 0.83].

The efficacy of the combined peptide and protein model was
tested on the manually curated SH3 domain mediated PPI set from
Tonikian et al. (2009). Tonikian and co—workers curated inter—
actions supported by multiple experiments through an exhaustive
literature search. Not all interactions (especially those identified
using two hybrid and overlay assays) in this set are mapped to the

2009). Therefore, these sequences are scanned using the three P1
training set PWMs to identify binding sites and significant amino
acid positions within those sites. Peptide and protein classifiers are
trained on P1 and N1 (no overlap with curated set) and P2 and N2
datasets, respectively. A randomized negative test set is created in
the same way as N1. Results from different statistical measures are
summarized in Figure 3. The combined classifier outperforms both
the peptide and protein classifiers on the curated set.

4.4 SH3 domain mediated PPI predictions

30 PWMs representing multiple binding specificities of 25 SH3 do—
mains in yeast are constructed using phage display data from
Tonikian et al. (2009) as described in Section 3.1 (Supplementary
Tables S1 and S2). These PWMs are then used to predict SH3 do—
main—peptide interactions using the combined classifier. 534 unique
PPIs (1481 binding sites) are predicted as positives for the stringent
P—value PWM threshold of 1e—05 with no missing features
(Supplementary Table S3). Approximately 55% (295 PPIs, 1139
binding sites) of these interactions are known at the PPI level
(iRefIndex and MINT) and at least 172 (464 binding sites) out of
295 PPIs are known SH3 domain mediated interactions at the pep—
tide level (with Z 60% overlapping binding site). For example, the
FUSlp SH3 domain is known to bind the STE5 p protein (verified by
two—hybrid assay and phage display) via an R(S/T)(S/T)SL motif,

supported by two separate studies (Kim et al., 2008; Nelson et al.,
2004). This interaction is part of the predicted set. 143 (203 binding
sites) out of 239 (342 binding sites) novel interactions are of high
confidence with the combined classifier scores 2 0.9. Biological
pathway enrichment (KEGG (Kanehisa, 2002) and Reactome (Croft
et al., 2014)) of the interactors reveal that a number of over—repre—
sented processes or pathways are associated with known SH3 do—
main biology such as endocytosis (Tonikian et al., 2009; Xin et al.,
2013), MAPK signaling (Lyons et al., 1996) and Rho GTPase signal—
ing (Bishop and Hall, 2000) (Supplementary Table S4). For ex—
ample, some interacting partners of the MYO3 SH3 domain are
found to be enriched in PI3K/AKT signaling. AKT is known to regu-
late actin organization and cell motility during endocytosis
(Enomoto et al., 2005; Koral et al., 2014). MYO3 is also implicated
in actin organization for the internalization step in endocytosis
(Toret and Drubin, 2006) (Supplementary Table S5). These ex—
amples support our results and suggest that our predicted inter—
actions are biologically relevant.

5 Conclusion

We developed a novel method for predicting physiologically relevant
PPIs in yeast. This method combines diverse binding site (peptide)
features, including presence in a disordered region of the protein,
surface accessibility, conservation across different yeast species, and
structural contact with the SH3 domain, as well as protein features
such as cellular proximity, shared biological process, similar mo-
lecular function, correlated gene expression and sequence signature.
Two separate Bayesian models are used to combine peptide and pro—
tein features. Their respective posterior probabilities are further
combined using Bayes rule for predicting high confidence inter-
actions. The combination of peptide and protein models achieved a
higher accuracy of 0.97 compared to individual models on a curated
benchmark dataset from Tonikian et al. (2009). Disordered region
and surface accessibility data from the peptide feature set and biolo—
gical process, cellular location and sequence signature information
from the protein feature set are able to separate positive from nega—
tive interactions significantly better than other features. The method
presented is generic and modular in nature. Given binding peptide
and feature data, we expect it can be used to predict other PRM
mediated PPIs in yeast and other organisms. Additional features
such as network topology, protein expression and text mining
derived protein relationships can be added to our framework.
Future development includes testing this method on other PRMs in
different organisms, especially human.

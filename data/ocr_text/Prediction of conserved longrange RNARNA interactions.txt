ABSTRACT

Motivation: Long-range RNA-RNA interactions (LRIs) play an
important role in viral replication, however, only a few of these
interactions are known and only for a small number of viral species.
Up to now, it has been impossible to screen a full viral genome for
LRIs experimentally or in silico. Most known LRIs are cross-reacting
structures (pseudoknots) undetectable by most bioinformatical tools.
Results: We present LRIscan, a tool for the LRI prediction in full
viral genomes based on a multiple genome alignment. We confirmed
14 out of 16 experimentally known and evolutionary conserved LRIs
in genome alignments of HCV, Tombusviruses, Flaviviruses and
HIV-1. We provide several promising new interactions, which include
compensatory mutations and are highly conserved in all considered
viral sequences. Furthermore, we provide reactivity plots highlighting
the hot spots of predicted LRIs.

1 INTRODUCTION

Long-range RNA-RNA interactions (LRIs) have been marginally
reported in various positive strand RNA Viruses like Tombusvirus
(8 in CIRV and TBSV), Hepacivirus (5 in HCV), Coronavirus
(1 in TGEV), Flavivirus (3 in DENV and WNV), Luteovirus (2
in BYDV), Apthovirus (2 in FMDV), PestiVirus (1 in CSFV)
and Human immunodeﬁciency Virus (5 in HIV-1) (Huthoff and
Berkhout, 2001; Abbink and Berkhout, 2003; Andersen et al.,
2004; Ooms et al., 2007; Beerens and Kjems, 2010). According to
their deﬁnition, a long-range interaction spans distances between
a few hundred and several thousands of nucleotides (>26 kb in
TGEV). LRIs are often located in loop regions or internal bulges
of local RNA structures (known as cis-acting regulatory elements)
and therefore build pseudoknot-like structures. Various programs
have been developed for general RNA-RNA interaction prediction,
which can be classiﬁed into ﬁve groups (Kato et al. , 2010; Seemann
et al., 2011): The ﬁrst group neglects intra—molecular base-pairs,

 

*to whom correspondence should be addressed

based on the hybrids minimum free energy (MFE). Members of this
group are RNAduplex and RNAplex (Lorenz et al., 2011; Tafer
and Hofacker, 2008) or RNAhybrid (Rehmsmeier et al., 2004).
The second category includes RNAcofold (Bemhart et al., 2006)
and PairFold (Andronescu et al., 2005). These tools concatenate
two interacting RNA sequences and calculate the MFE of the joint
RNA sequences. The third group considers intra—molecular and
inter-molecular RNA-RNA interactions in separated steps, however
only one binding site is predicted. Members of this group are
Int aRNA (Busch et al., 2008) or RNAup (Mﬁckstein et al., 2006).
The fourth group considers more complex RNA-RNA interactions
and allows also more than one binding site. This group includes
tools like RactIP (Kato et al., 2010), inteRNA (Alkan et al.,
2006) or inRNAs (Salari et al., 2010). The ﬁnal group contains e. g.
PETcofold (Seemann et al., 2011), RNAaliduplex (Lorenz
et al., 2011), IRBIS (Pervouchine, 2014), ripalign (Li et al.,
2011) and simul fold (Meyer and Miklos, 2007). These tools
consider not only a pair of single sequences, like the tools mentioned
above, they use multiple sequence alignments as input. With this
comparative method, it is possible to reduce the false-positive rate
by incorporating evolutionary conserved information. All of these
programs have different properties, unsuitable for Viral genomes.
For example, RNAaliduplex is unable to predict pseudoknots
and neglects intra—molecular RNA foldings. PET co f o l d considers
both, intra— and inter-molecular interactions as well as pseudo-
knots, but returns per default only a single secondary structure,
which makes the detection of multiple functional binding sites
impossible. ripalign’s running time makes the program not
applicable to Viral sequences and IRBIS is only applicable for
predictions of RNA interactions related to RNA splice sites. Up
to now, we are aware of a single program that is designed
for LRI prediction, called CovaRNA (Bindewald and Shapiro,
2013). This tool detects long-range nucleotide covariation from
multiple sequence alignments of eukaryotic genomes using an
index-based algorithm to ﬁnd clusters of covarying base-pairs. The
extended function CovStat determines the statistical signiﬁcance
of observed covariation cluster. CovaRNA has very strict ﬁlter
criteria and is therefore very conservative in predicting LRIs. For
short genomes, such as Viral genomes, this leads to almost no
predicted interactions.

Here, we present LRI s can for detecting long-range RNA-RNA
interactions in complete Viral genome alignments without prior
knowledge. Sparse alignment interaction dotplots in combination

with RNAalifold (Bernhart at 611., 2008) secondary structure
foldings based on minimum free energy calculations are used to
predict possible LRIs. We add several ﬁlter steps and scoring
functions to reduce false positive candidates. We conﬁrm 14 out
of 16 experimentally known and evolutionary conserved LRIs
in HCV, Tombusviruses, Flaviviruses and HIV—1. We predict
several promising new interactions, being highly conserved in all
considered viral sequences with multiple compensatory mutations
and highly conserved in all considered viral sequences.

2 METHODS

With LRI scan we propose for the ﬁrst time a method for conserved
genome-wide long-range RNA-RNA interaction (LRI) prediction in viral
genomes based on a multiple sequence alignment. LRIscan is based on
the C-library of the ViennaRNA Package 2 . 0 (Lorenz at (11., 2011).
The pipeline consists of four basic steps (see workﬂow Fig. 1):

(1) Calculate alignment coverage and complexity.

(2) Find LRI seeds with a sparse dotplot method.

(3) Filter LRI candidates based on MFE; calculate z—score/p—value and
compensatory score.

(4) Extend seed interaction.

The input of LRI scan is a nucleotide alignment A of length n with m
sequences. By A1; we denote the ’i—th column of the alignment. Entry (If
is the k—th row of column 0. We deﬁne the alignment coverage for each
column 141,; as percentage of nucleotides over all sequences m, without

gaps. We introduce the pairing matrix 11 with entries 11,5 : 1 if at
least 15 percent (default t : 0.95 for more than 100 sequences, otherwise
default 1; : 0.80) of the corresponding sequences can form a base—pair

(diam?) e {AU,UA,UG,GU,GC,CG}, otherwise Hg- : 0.

2.1 Alignment cleaning, coverage, complexity

To improve the alignment quality for the nucleotide folding, rarely occurring
IUPAC nucleotide ambiguities are replaced by the most occurring valid
nucleotides of the same alignment column.

We introduce the coverage matrix (D with entries (13,3- : 1 if the coverage
of columns A, and Aj is greater than the minimum coverage deﬁned by the
user (default 0.5), otherwise (Dij : 0.

Let 6 be the compression function replacing stretches of identical
nucleotides by a single nucleotide, e.g. 6(AAGUUUCC) : AGUC.

The complexity for each alignment column A,- is stored by the complexity
matrix C computed as

m k
Ci : i Z |5((:;...t+sl)j (1)
m k:]_ ia'i...i+S—li
where s is the minimum seed interaction length (default: 5 bp). With
the complexity score we avoid calculations of regions with gaps or low
complexity, such as poly—AfU stretches.
A minimum coverage and complexity threshold can be deﬁned by the user
(default: coverage : 0.5, complexity : 0.5), with a direct effect on run
time.

2.2 LRI seed detection

To ﬁnd LRIs we use a dotplot calculation combined with several base-pairing
criteria computed by RNAalifold (Bemhart et (11., 2008). To efﬁciently
identify interacting seed regions, we initialize the dotplot seed matrix S with
Sm- : 0. Each entry SM with minimum distance to between column '21 and
j (default to : 100 nt) is calculated, following the recursion:

Sijj : (Si_1,j+1 +Hij)-@ij, 0 < i < n—w,i+w <j< n (2)

3,337 will be considered as seed candidate, if (i) Si+1jj11 : 0 and
3,537 2 .3, (ii) the minimum free energy of the seed alignment, calculated
by RNAalifold, is smaller as the maximum MFE deﬁned by the user
(default — 10 kcal ﬁnal), and (iii) the mean sequence complexity of the seed
is greater than the user deﬁned threshold (see red dots in Fig. 1B).

To speed up the seed ﬁnding, which needs quadratic time 0(9'12), multiple
CPU’s can be used. Each CPU calculates a row of 100 nt (see Fig. 1B)
overlapping by the minimum seed length 8. To save memory, we store only
the last valid entry for each seed in a hash.

2.3 LRI seed scoring

For each LRI, we calculate the MFE with RNAalifold. Sequences
including only gaps are neglected. Based on the MFE we calculate a z-score
to determine the reliability of each LRI, compared to a randomly sampled
alignment. The z- score, can be calculated for each predicted LRI as

where X is the MFE of the corresponding interaction, ,u the mean MFE
and a the corresponding standard deviation of the z-times randomly swap-
shufﬂed alignments.

For each consensus base-pair b(A,-, Aj) of a given seed (of length |b|),
we determine the compensatory score 7' to ﬁnd LRIs with a high amount
of compensatory mutations coincident with a high amount of compatible
base-pairs. We consider 1 nt changes (e.g. AU to GU), which preserve a base-
pairing, as well as 2 nt changes (e.g. AU to GC) as compensatory mutations.

For each consensus base-pair, u is the number of different base-pair types
(u g 6) and h is the number of compatible base-pairs (h g m). We
normalize by the maximum number of different base-pairs over all consensus
base-pairs (|b|) for all sequences k included in the LRI (k g m).

2.4 LRI seed extension

For each LRI seed, we attempt to extend the alignment by 10 bp at the 5’ and
3’ end. For the extended alignment, the MFE is calculated by RNAal i fold,
with a hard constraint to build given seed base-pairs and a soft constraint
which forces an inter-molecular interaction of the surrounding base-pairs.
For the extended alignment a separate z-score and p-Value calculation is
possible (default off). These scores are independent from seed scores.

2.5 Output results

All resulting LRIs are presented in a tab-separated ﬁle and additionally as
HTML table, linking all corresponding ﬁgures to allow the user to browse
through the output.

The interacting alignment positions are calculated back to the original
position of each Virus isolate to easily assess the interactions.

2.6 CovaRNA

To compare LRIscan to CovaRNA we converted all alignments to the
UCSC MAF format and used CovaRNA with a minimum number of two
input sequences, reading out of the MAP input ﬁle (—s 2).

2.7 Dataset

For HCV, we downloaded 950 genomes from NCBI and the
HCV database1 (V. 2008 (Kuiken et al., 2005)). Sequences
which occur in both data sets were considered only once. For

 

1 http://hcv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/NEWALIGN/
align.htm1

Tombusvirus and Flavivirus, we downloaded all genomes listed as
complete genomes at NCBI-Genome, resulting in 13 sequences for
Tombusvirus and six sequences for Flavivirus (mosquito/vertebrate
Flaviviruses).

For the 950 HCV sequences, an alignment was generated with
MAFFT ——auto, V.6.8 (Katoh et al. , 2002) and a phylogenetic tree
was built with Geneious, V.6.1 (Kearse et al., 2012) Neighbor-
Joining method Tamura—Nei (Tamura and Nei, 1993). Based on
this tree and the annotations from NCBI and the HCV database
the dataset was reduced to two of the longest genomes from each
subtype if available, resulting in 106 sequences from 65 subtypes.

For Tombusvirus (13 sequences), Flavivirus (6 sequences) and
the reduced HCV set (106 sequences), we generated MAFFT
——maxiterate lOOO ——localpair alignments as input for
LRIscan.

For HIV we downloaded the hand curated compendium alignment
from the HIV sequence database2 choosing all subtypes of
the HIV-1 alignment of 2014, resulting in an alignment of 200
sequences.

All input alignments can be found at the supplemental page3.

2.8 Sensitivity and speciﬁcity

To calculate the sensitivity and speciﬁcity of LRI s can we
performed di-nucleotide shufﬂing of each sample alignment with
mult ipe rm (Anandam et al. , 2009) and hid true positive LRIs. We
deﬁned all experimentally detected LRIs as true positives, as well as
the top LRIs of the original alignment. We applied LRI s can with
the same parameters as with the original alignments.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

To validate our tool, we chose the four positive strand RNA
Viruses with known LRIs: Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), Flavivirus,
Tombusvirus and Human immunodeﬁciency Virus (HIV). The
best studied Viruses, with highest number of known LRIs, are
HCV and Tombusviruses. In HCV, ﬁve LRIs are experimentally
veriﬁed (Fig. 2B) and another twelve LRIs have been predicted
semi-manually in Fricke et al. (2015). Currently, eight LRIs in
Tombusvirus (Fig. 5B), three LRIs in Flaviviruses (Fig. 4B) and
two LRIs in HIV-1 (Fig. 6B) have been experimentally veriﬁed.
As input for LRI scan we used alignments of 106 HCV genomes,
13 Tombusvirus genomes, 6 Flavivirus genomes and 200 HIV-1
genomes.

3.1 HCV

To determine the LRIs of the HCV alignment, we used LRI s can
with default parameters. Due to general assembly problems of the
5 ’/3’ UTR of Viral sequences, the HCV alignment consists of only
19 complete sequences. Therefore, we set the minimum number
of involved sequences to 17% (18 sequences), resulting in 311
predicted LRIs (74 LRIs with p < 0.05).

We plotted all detected LRIs of HCV, passing the p-Value
threshold, to the corresponding genome alignment position

The plot was created with Circos (Krzywinski er a1. , 2009). (B) Experimentally veriﬁed LRIs, which can be predicted by LRI s can, named SLIIId—5BSL3.2
(Romero—Lopez and Berzal—Herranz, 2012, 2009), 5BSL2—5BSL3.2 (Romero—Lopez at all, 2014; Tuplin at 651., 2012), 5BSL3.2—3’SLII (Friebe at all, 2005)
and 5’UTR—core (Beguiristain et a1. , 2005; Honda 63‘ $1., 1999). (C) Highly interesting new LRIs predicted by LRI s can. In a former study, we suggested that
LRI 21? could be a seed interaction for a HCV genome circularization (Fricke at all, 2015). A complete list including all predicted LRIs can be found at the
supplemental page. Colors are used to indicate conserved base—pairs: from red (no variation of a base—pair within the alignment) to purple (all six base—pair
types are found); from dark (all sequences contain this base—pair) to light colors (1 or 2 sequences are unable to form this base—pair). Compensatory mutations

are marked by a circle around the variable base(s).

(Fig. 2A) to detect regions with a high number of interactions.
Interestingly, we detected some highly reactive regions in the 5’
UTR and 3’ UTR, but also high reactivity sites in the CDS of the
core and NSSB protein coding region. The UTRs and the core
region show the highest amount of possible LRIs, in agreement
with the known highly structured regions for all HCV subtypes
(Fricke 61‘ 611., 2015). Consistent with regions of high reactivity
(superior interacting regions), it has been shown that the 5’ UTR
includes three LRIs (Filbin and Kieft, 2011; Romero—Lepez and
Berzal—Herranz, 2012, 2009; Beguiristain e: (11., 2005; Honda e: (11.,
1999).

For HCV, ﬁve LRIs have been experimentally veriﬁed: SLII—
SLIV (Filbin and Kieft, 2011), SLIIId—5BSL3.2 (Romero—Lopez
and Berzal-Herranz, 2012, 2009), 5BSL2-5BSL3.2 (Romero-
Lopez 63 611., 2014; Tuplin e; 611., 2012), 5BSL3.2—3’SLII (Friebe
er al., 2005) and 5’UTR—core (Beguiristain at £11., 2005; Honda
61‘ £11., 1999). We identiﬁed three known LRIs within the ﬁrst
58 hits ranked by p-value (Fig. 2B). We missed SLII-SLIV
because of the unfavourable seed MFE of only —7 kcal/mol (default
threshold —10kcal/mol). The LRI SLIIId—5BSL3.2 did not pass our
conservative p-value threshold, but is part of the LRI s can output
(LRI 2d). Increasing the MFE or p—value threshold would increase

the amount of LRIs dramatically, very likely resulting in a high false
positive rate (Fig. 3).

We present three highly interesting new LRIs based on p—value,
compensatory score and location in the HCV genome (Fig. 2C).

The LRI g of Fig. 2 (LRI 2g) is one of the best ranked LRI with a
very long seed interaction of 8 nt and three compensatory base—pairs,
whereof one base—pair consists of three different types of base—pairs
changed in both sites. This LRI is conserved in 89/106 isolates and
spans a distance of 754 nt between 5’ UTR and the coding region
of the core protein. An experimental veriﬁcation of the interactions
would be highly recommended.

LR12f is also highly conserved in all isolates and spans a distance
of 9440 nt, connecting the 5’UTR with the NSSB coding regions
(corresponding to LRI 4 in Fricke er al. (2015)). We identiﬁed also
the possible genome circularization 26) between 5’SLII and 3’DLS
(see Fricke er a1. (2015)).

3.2 Flavivirus

For Flavivirus genomes we used LRIscan with default values.
We predicted 113/157 LRIs with a p—value smaller 0.05. Although
Flaviviruses and Hepacivirus are both assigned to the family
Flaviviridae, the LRI distribution is very different. In Flaviviruses,
we found some clearly separated peaks with an accumulation of

Fig. 3. Plot of predicted LRIs in the HCV alignment using different MFE
thresholds. The default threshold is —10kcal/mol resulting in 311 LRIs.
With increasing MFE threshold, the number of predicted LRI increases
dramatically and therewith the false positive rate. Thus, we decided to
choose a conservative MFE threshold. black — cumulative sum of LRIs per
MFE threshold. gray — sum of LRIs per MFE threshold

LRIs, located at the 3’ end of gene M and in the center of the NS3
and N55 gene (Fig. 4A). Different from the HCV alignment, we
did not ﬁnd an accumulation of LRIs in the 5’ UTR and 3’ UTR.
This effect could be explained by different sequence conservations

of the UTRs. In HCV the pairwise identity of the UTRs is >
95 %, whereas the UTR pairwise identity of the Flaviviruses is
< 50 %. The Flavivirus alignment consists of only six sequences,
including only the mosquito/vertebrate Flaviviruses. In Flavivirus
three experimentally veriﬁed LRIs are known: 5’-3’-UAR, DAR
and 5’—3’—CS (Khromykh er al., 2001; Zhang er al., 2008; Alvarez
er LIL, 2005; Corver 61611., 2003; You 61‘ £11., 2001; Friebe and Harris,
2010). All known interactions are in close proximity and can build
a genome circularization, essential for the viral replication. The
strongest interaction (CS), was ranked at fourth position (Fig. 4B).
It was not possible to identify the 5’-3’-UAR and DAR, because the
seed region does not appear to be conserved in the highly variable
5’ UTR.

However, we found several new promising LRIs (Fig. 4C) in the
considered Flaviviruses. All depicted interactions are ranked among

(up to four types of base—pairs) and being conserved in all sequences.

3.3 Tombusvirus

For the genomes of the Tombusviridae we used LRIscan with
default parameters. We found 529 LRIs (213 LRIs with p < 0.05).
Most of the LRls in Tombusvirus are located in the p92 region (Fig.
5A). This is in line with the already known interactions, where four
out of eight known LRIs start in the p92 region (Cimino et (11.,
2011; Wu 61‘ 611., 2009; Lin and White, 2004). But also the intergenic
regions between p41/p22 and the 3’ end of the p92 coding regions
show high reactivity (Fig. 5A). These areas harbor the known

UL—DL (Wu 616.11., 2009), sg2—SLB (Fabian and White, 2004), ASl—RSl (Lin and White, 2004), AS2—RSZ (Lin and White, 2004). (C) Highly interesting new

interacting regions of the AS 1/RSl, DE/CE, sgl/SLB, ASZ/RS2,
sg2/SLB (Wu e! 611., 2009; Lin and White, 2004; Fabian and White,
2004). In contrast, the p41 region contains only a few predicted
LRIs. This is due to the very variable sequence of this gene, which
encodes the coat protein of the Tombusviruses.

In addition to the mentioned ﬁve, three more LRIs are known
from experimental data for Tombusviruses: SL3—SLB (Fabian and
White, 2004, 2006; Nicholson and White, 2008), PRTE—DRTE
(Cimino er 611., 2011), UL—DL (Wu er 611., 2009). We detected six
of the eight known LRIs (Fig. 5B). AS2—RS2 was ranked very low
due to a very short seed of 5 bp, a low p-value and a poly-G stretch.
The missing SL3-SLB and DE-CE have been only described for
one species and are also manually not discoverable in other species.
Both interactions are located in variable regions with low conserved
RNA sequences. Here, we present three novel LRIs (Fig. 5C). The
LRI 5g with strong compensatory mutations in 6 of 6 base—pairs
and up to four types is conserved in all sequences. The LRIs 5k
and 51' are conserved in all sequences and have a very high rank,
as well as compensatory base—pairs with up to three types of base—
pairs mutated at both interaction sites. The introduced LRIs are
interesting candidates for further wet lab studies.

3.4 HIV

For the HIV alignment, LRIscan was used with default
parameters. Only 20% of HIV genomes (40 sequences) contained
a complete 5’ and 3’ UTR, therefore we decreased the minimum

involved sequences to 20%. With these settings we identiﬁed 314
LRIs (115 LRIs withp < 0.05).

In HIV, ﬁve LRIs are known termed R—GAG, LDI, U5—AUG,
TAR—TAR and GAG—U3R (Huthoff and Berkhout, 2001; Abbink
and Berkhout, 2003; Andersen 61‘ 611., 2004; Ooms e! 611., 2007;
Beerens and Kjems, 2010). We identiﬁed three of the known
interactions: U5—AUG, TAR—TAR and LDI, (Fig. 6B). Due to
the conservative MFE threshold it was not possible to detect the
conserved R—GAG interaction. For the GAG—U3R interactions no
conserved seed interaction exists.

We also suggest three novel LRIs (Fig. 6C). These LRIs are
conserved in all 200 sequences and have several compensatory
mutations. LRI 661 is ranked at position one and has compensatory
mutations in 7 out of 9 base—pairs with up to 3 different base—pair

types.

3.5 Comparison to CovaRNA

We compare LRI s can to CovaRNA, designed for large eukaryotic
genomes. CovaRNA outputs no reliable results for the small
viral genomes. For the HCV and for the Tombusvirus alignment,
CovaRNA found only one covariation cluster consisting of only
two base—pairs. This cluster covers no known LRI. No cluster could
be identiﬁed for the HIV alignment. The output of the Flavivirus
alignment includes ﬁve covariation clusters. All clusters contain
only two base—pairs and cover none of the known LRIs.

HIV 200 80.0 16 0.81 0.69
Mean | 0.83 0.64

3.6 Sensitivity and speciﬁcity

An accurate sensitivity/speciﬁcity calculation is difﬁcult due to the
limited number of experimentally veriﬁed LRls. We reach a mean
sensitivity of 0.83. Most of the non—detected true positive LRIs
are speciﬁc and experimentally veriﬁed only for single isolates.
We investigated their conservation throughout the individuals of
the alignment manually, resulting in isolate—speciﬁc LRIs. The
sensitivity is independent on the sequence number and alignment
identity (see Tab. 1). The mean speciﬁcity of 0.64 depicts a rather
high number of false positives. A more stringent p—value would
remove a large fraction of false positives, however, results also in
a loss of true positive LRIs, see Fig. 2, 4—6. In practice, known LRIs
have very small p-values (high ranks) and/or high compensatory
scores and/or can be extended in length. The user selects the LRIs

based on all metrics and on the regions of interests. A minimal p—
value threshold including almost all experimental veriﬁed LRls can
be found at 0.05.

4 CONCLUSIONS

The identiﬁcation of long—range RNA—RNA interactions is experi—
mentally and bioinformatically a challenging task. The huge amount
of theoretically possible interactions makes it impossible to verify
all possible interactions by wet lab experiments. LRIscan offers
the opportunity to predict possible LRIs under certain criteria and
reduces dramatically the number of candidates for wet lab studies.
As shown in part A of Fig. 2—6, also well studied viruses provide a
huge list of highly ranked LRIs, which could be involved in viral
translation and transcription mechanisms. Further wet lab studies,
which verify the functionality of these interactions, could improve
our understanding of the viral replication.

Abstract

Summary: PhenomeScape is a Cytoscape app which provides easy access to the PhenomeExpress
algorithm to interpret gene expression data. PhenomeExpress integrates protein interaction networks
with known phenotype to gene associations to find active sub-networks enriched in differentially ex-
pressed genes. It also incorporates cross-species phenotypes and associations to include results
from animal models of disease. With expression data imported into PhenomeScape, the user can
quickly generate and visualise interactive sub-networks. PhenomeScape thus enables researchers to
use prior knowledge of a disease to identify differentially regulated sub-networks and to generate an

overview of altered biologically processes specific to that disease.

1 Introduction

The interpretation of gene expression data to gain insights into molec-
ular mechanisms of disease after differentially expression analysis is
challenging. Looking at groups of genes using enrichment or network
based methods adds power to the analysis and aids interpretation. Gene
set enrichment approaches are limited to predeﬁned sets of genes and
ignore the known interaction information. Finding de novo sub-
networks/pathways from a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and
the expression data itself is an alternative approach employed by many
tools (Ideker et a1. 2002). For many diseases, there are genes, which are
known through human Mendelian disease and animal models, where
perturbation gives rise to observed phenotypes present in the disease
under study. Projects such as the International Knockout Mouse Consor-
tium are adding much new information as they systematically identify
gene to phenotype associations (Bradley et a1. 2012). This prior
knowledge is valuable, since when combined with the gene expression
data it indicates which genes and pathways/regions of the interactome
are of importance in the disease.

We recently described an algorithm named PhenomeExpress for anal-
ysis of disease related expression data that makes use of known cross-
species phenotype to gene associations to generate sub-networks of
differentially expressed genes that are linked to the observed phenotypes
(Soul et a1. 2015). We here present PhenomeScape, a Cytoscape applica-
tion allowing a user to quickly run the described PhenomeExpress algo-
rithm on gene expression data within the Cytoscape GUI environment
(Shannon et a1. 2003).

2 Methods

2.1 Network sources

UberPheno network ontology was used to produce a phenotype-
phenotype similarity network using Resnik semantic similarity, with a
cut-off of 3 to keep strong interactions between phenotypes (Kohler et a1.
2013). Gene to cross-species phenotype associations were downloaded
ﬁom UberPheno. Example high conﬁdence mouse and human networks
from HumanConsensusPathDB and StringDB are provided for conven-
ience and can be loaded though the app menu (Kamburov et a1. 2009;

using Biomart (Smedley et a1. 2015).

(A) Example input data, 03). Pipeline for differentially regulated sub-network identiﬁca-
tion. (C) Example output of sub-network derived from the input PPI. Protein nodes are
coloured by fold change (red increase, green decrease). Direct interactions between
chosen phenotypes that describe the disease understudy to their associated genes are
indicated in blue.

For input PhenomeScape requires a PPI network, either input using
standard Cytoscape import methods or a provided one (Fig 1A). Ana-
lysed expression data with gene symbols, fold change and p-Values are
imported into Cytoscape and matched with the network by the Gene
Symbol. No thresholding by fold change or p-Value is required as signif-
icance is determined at a sub-network level by calculation of empirical
p-Values through random sampling of the background network. Network
parameters are set to sensible defaults, but can be altered to increase the
size and number of the resulting sub-networks for further exploration of
the data. The min sub-network size prevents creation of very small sub-
networks while the sub-network size parameter is a constant introduced
in the PhenomeExpress algorithm that inﬂuences the maximum size of
the sub-networks. The p-Value threshold allows ﬁltering of the sub-
networks by their statistical signiﬁcance. Finally, phenotypes describing
the disease under study are selected from a table with a ﬁlter function.

2.3 Sub-network identiﬁcation

The PhenomeExpress algorithm has previously been described in detail.
Brieﬂy, the input PPI is linked to a provided phenotype-phenotype net-
work via phenotype-gene associations (Fig 1B). The expression data and
the chosen phenotypes are used with a diffusion approach to calculate
activity scores of proteins in the PPI. Subsequently, highly scoring
groups of interacting proteins are identiﬁed as sub-networks.

2.4 PhenomeScape Output

PhenomeScape creates all identiﬁed sub-networks for visualisation,
coloured to indicate fold change for rapid identiﬁcation of the most
differentially expressed genes (Fig 1C). Direct associations between the
chosen phenotypes and the genes are shown allowing the user to View
which genes have evidence of being previously linked to the disease
phenotypes. The results panel shows the empirical p-Value of the sub-
networks and to the top enriched GOTerm to give an indication of the
function of the de novo sub-networks.

3 Use Case

Previously analysed gene expression data comparing human damaged
and intact osteoarthritic knee cartilage was downloaded ﬁom ArrayEx-
press (E-MTAB-4304). This data was analysed as previously described
to produce a table of all expressed genes and their corresponding fold
changes and p-Values (Dunn et a1. 2016). The default human network
derived ﬁom HumanConsensusPathDB was loaded from the Phe-
nomeScape app menu. Using the standard table import tools the expres-
sion data spreadsheet was loaded and added to the network in Cytoscape
by using the gene symbol as a key. The resulting human network has
nodes labelled with expression data where the gene is expressed. Pheno-
types relevant to the disease osteoarthritis were selected using the text
box to ﬁlter the phenotype selection table. Increased and decreased sus-
ceptibility to arthritis, joint stifﬁress and knee osteoarthritis phenotypes
were chosen based on review of the available phenotype terms.

Using default network parameters, PhenomeScape identiﬁed 21 statisti-
cally signiﬁcantly sub-networks including a sub-network the top GO
term enrichment of organisation of the extracellular matrix, shown in
Figure 1C. This is consistent with the known perturbation of the extracel-
lular matrix during osteoarthritis. Four phenotype to associated gene
links are shown in this sub-network, several genes of which are strongly
differentially expressed demonstrating the utility of incorporating the
prior disease knowledge.

4 Conclusion

PhenomeScape allows users to rapidly explore analysed gene expression
data. Compared to existing tools such as ReactomeFIViz, PhenomeScape
is unique in allowing integration of the prior phenotypic knowledge of
disease genes into the expression analysis. No coding experience is
needed to run PhenomeScape making it suitable for bench scientists who
have gene expression data available. The resulting sub-networks pro-
duced in Cytoscape allow the user to extend the analysis with additional
apps for regulatory analysis. PhenomeScape provides new insights in
active processes revealed by expression data in the context of the prior
knowledge of the disease phenotypes.

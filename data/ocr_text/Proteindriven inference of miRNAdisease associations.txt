ABSTRACT

Motivation: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a highly abundant class of non-
coding RNA genes involved in cellular regulation and thus also diseases.
Despite miRNAs being important disease factors, miRNA—disease as-
sociations remain low in number and of variable reliability. Furthermore,
existing databases and prediction methods do not explicitly facilitate
forming hypotheses about the possible molecular causes of the asso-
ciation, thereby making the path to experimental follow-up longer.
Results: Here we present miRPD in which miRNA—Protein—Disease as-
sociations are explicitly inferred. Besides linking miRNAs to diseases, it
directly suggests the underlying proteins involved, which can be used to
form hypotheses that can be experimentally tested. The inference of
miRNAs and diseases is made by coupling known and predicted
miRNA—protein associations with protein—disease associations text
mined from the literature. We present scoring schemes that allow us
to rank miRNA—disease associations inferred from both curated and
predicted miRNA targets by reliability and thereby to create high- and
medium-confidence sets of associations. Analyzing these, we find stat-
istically significant enrichment for proteins involved in pathways related
to cancer and type I diabetes mellitus, suggesting either a literature bias
or a genuine biological trend. We show by example how the associ-
ations can be used to extract proteins for disease hypothesis.

1 INTRODUCTION

Since the initial discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs) 20 years
ago, (Lee et al., 1993; Wightman et al., 1993), the number of
known miRNAs has grown to thousands of currently annotated
miRNAs from a wide variety of species [e.g. the inventory of
miRBase (Kozomara and Grifﬁths-Jones, 2011)]. MicroRNAs
are increasingly being recognized as key regulatory players
(Friedman et al., 2009; Lim et al., 2005), and dysregulation of
them is hence an obvious source of aberrant cell behavior. Not
surprisingly, miRNAs have been associated with a large number
of diseases (Esteller, 2011; Mendell and Olson, 2012) including
schizophrenia (Feng et al., 2009), cardiovascular diseases (Small
and Olson, 2011) and cancer (He et al., 2005; Vosa et al., 2011).

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

MicroRNAs function by base pairing with 3’-UTRs of mes-
senger RNAs (mRNAs), triggering their translational repression
or degradation (Ambros, 2004; Bartel, 2004, 2009; Meister and
Tuschl, 2004). The targeting depends on either complete se-
quence complementarity for inducing transcript degradation or
partial sequence complementarity for translational repression. In
addition to the base pairing between the miRNA and the
mRNA, targeting also depends on the local sequence context
of the target site and on a number of proteins participants
(Grimson et al., 2007). Owing to this complexity, miRNA
target prediction remains a signiﬁcant computational challenge,
although advances in recent years have considerably improved
the reliability with which miRNAzszNA interactions (from
now on referred to as miRNA—protein associations) can be pre-
dicted (Betel et al., 2010; Garcia et al., 2011; Kertesz et al., 2007;
Krek et al., 2005). Moreover, experimental validation of miRNA
target predictions is difﬁcult and the number of functionally
veriﬁed targets sites remains low (Kuhn et al., 2008).

Because of their potential for wide-spread involvement in dis-
eases, a number of resources have emerged containing experi-
mentally veriﬁed miRNA—disease associations obtained via text
mining (Dweep et al., 2011; Jiang et al., 2009; Lu et al., 2008;
Ruepp et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2010). However, the majority of
miRNA—disease associations has presumably not been dis-
covered yet and thus cannot be mined from the literature. In
concordance with this, de novo prediction of miRNA—disease
associations is receiving increasing attention (Chen and Zhang,
2013; Chen et al., 2012; Jiang et al., 2010; Rossi et al., 2011; Xiao
et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2013).

To our knowledge, none of the existing methods for predicting
miRNA—disease associations provide any biological hypothesis
underpinning the predictions. Therefore, we here present an ap-
proach in which miRNAs are linked to diseases via proteins,
thereby directly providing biological hypotheses. Speciﬁcally,
we infer miRNA—disease associations by network analysis of
known or predicted miRNA—protein associations and text-
mined protein—disease associations. To account for the variable
reliability of both types of associations, we provide a scoring
scheme that allows for ranking of the inferences by conﬁdence.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 miRNA—protein associations

We use miRNA—protein associations from three sources: a set of text
mining-based miRNA-target associations from Croft et a]. (2012) and

Protein-driven inference of miRNA-disease associations

 

predictions from two state-of—the-art miRNA-target methods, namely,
MiRanda version 5 (Betel et al., 2010) and TargetScan version 6.2
(Garcia 61 al., 2011). To enable comparison and integration of these
sources, we mapped all miRNAs to minase identiﬁers and all targets
to Ensembl protein identiﬁers (ENSPs) using the STRING aliases ﬁle
(Franceschini et al., 2013). Each association between a miRNA (M)
and a protein (P) has a quality measure assigned to it, referred to as
T (M, P). In case of the manually curated Croft dataset, we used as
score the number of Medline abstracts supporting the association. For
MiRanda and TargetScan, we used the mirSVR and Context+ scores,
respectively. In the small proportion of cases where MiRanda or
TargetScan predicts multiple target sites for the same miRNA within a
single mRNA, we sum their scores. Table 1 summarizes the miRNA—
protein association datasets.

2.2 Protein—disease associations

To obtain protein—disease associations to be used for prediction of
miRNA—disease associations, we downloaded the complete dataset
from the DISEASES database (http://diseases.jensenlab.org; S.P.F.,
A.P.C. og L.J.J., manuscript in preparation). To identify proteins and
diseases mentioned in Medline abstracts, this resource makes use of the
efﬁcient tagger described in Paﬁlis et al. (2013) to identify names of
human proteins from the STRING database (Franceschini et al., 2013)
and disease names from the Disease Ontology (Schriml et al., 2012). The
protein—disease associations were automatically mined from Medline ab-
stracts and have quality scores assigned to them. The scores are computed
using a slightly modiﬁed version of the co-occurrence—based text-mining
scores in STRING v9.1 (Franceschini et al., 2013), which for complete-
ness is outlined as follows.

The scoring scheme takes into account co-occurrences within an ab-
stract and within individual sentences of the abstract and combines them
in a weighting scheme. First, a weighted count (C(P, D)) is calculated for
each pair of a protein P and a disease D over 11 abstracts:

C(P, D) = Z wa6ak(P, D) + w,3,k(P, D)
k=l

where w = 3 and w, = 0.2 are the weights for co-occurrence within the
same abstract and the same sentence, respectively. The delta functions
6ak(P, D) and 6,k(P, D) are 1, if P and D are co-mentioned in abstract k or
a sentence therein. Based on the weighted counts, the co-occurrence score
[S(P, D)] is deﬁned as follows:

C o o “a

where C(P, o) is the sum over diseases paired with protein P, C(o, D) is
the sum over all proteins paired with disease D and the normalizing factor
C(o, o) is the sum over all pairs of proteins and diseases. The weighting
factor at = 0.6.

Because these scores will change both with the growth of Medline and
disease terms in the Disease Ontology, we convert them into the more
robust and easier to interpret Z—scores (Z(P, D)) relative to a background
distribution. To this end, we assume that the empirically observed score

distribution is a mixture of lower-scoring random background and the
higher-scoring true signal. We model the background distribution as a
Gaussian and estimate its mean as the mode of the mixture distribution.
Because we have empirically observed that the 40th percentile in this case
coincides with the mode, we estimate the variance based on the distance
between the 20th and 40th percentiles.

Finally, we ﬁltered out associations involving 1992 broad disease
concepts from the Disease Ontology to obtain a set of 234 834 scored
protein—disease associations among 14 871 proteins and 2586 diseases.

In addition to the protein—disease associations derived from text
mining, we have used two other sources of protein—disease associations.
One is derived from Uniprot, the other from The Genetics Home
Reference (GHR). Both datasets have been mapped to Disease
Ontology terms and ﬁltered for the same generic disease terms as the
text mining-derived protein—disease associations. The protein—disease as-
sociations from Uniprot and GHR are unscored and are hence given a
score of 1 such as to be used with our scoring schemes. The Uniprot-
based dataset consists of 1632 proteins and 161 diseases in 3469 associ-
ations. The GHR dataset consists of 950 proteins and 468 diseases in
2509 associations.

2.3 Inference of miRNA—disease associations

To infer miRNA—disease associations and rank them by conﬁdence, we
need a scoring scheme that combines the miRNA—protein association
scores, T (M , P), and protein—disease association scores, Z(P, D).

Let (M, P) denote the association between miRNA M and protein P,
and let PM denote the set of proteins associated with M.
Correspondingly, let (P, D) denote the association between protein P
and disease D, and let PD denote the set of all proteins associated to
disease D. We can then deﬁne a score between miRNA M and disease
D as follows:

U(M, D) = Z T(M, P*) Z(P*, D)
P* EPMﬂPD

where T (M , P*) and Z(P*, D) are the already described miRNA—protein
and protein—disease association scores, respectively.

As an alternative scoring function, we used only the best scoring pro-
tein connection between a miRNA and a disease instead of the sum over
all connections:

_ >l< >l<
V(M, D) _ 13* 3%ng T(M, P ) Z(P ,D)

For each of the two scoring functions and for each of the three sets of
miRNA—protein associations (Table 1), we produced a list of inferred
miRNA—disease associations ranked by score. The scoring schemes use
the product of the two subscores in order not to affect the rank of the
ﬁnal scored miRNA—disease associations due to differences in scale
among the subscores. These six ranked lists can be downloaded from
http://mirpd.jensenlab.org.

2.4 Prediction performance evaluation

To benchmark our method for predicting miRNA—disease associations,
we used the manually curated gold standard set of direct associations
between miRNAs and diseases from Jiang et a]. (2010). To allow for
direct comparison with the datasets described earlier in the text, we
mapped the miRNAs and diseases to minase and Disease Ontology
identiﬁers, respectively. After mapping, the set consisted of 236 associ-
ations among 92 miRNAs and 48 diseases.

For each of the six ranked lists of inferred miRNA—disease associ-
ations, we ﬁrst disregarded all associations that involved an miRNA or
a disease not at all present in the gold standard. Next we ranked the
remaining inferred associations in decreasing order by their scores,
U(M, D) and V(M, D), respectively. To measure the agreement with the

gold standard, we calculated the cumulative number of gold standard
associations identiﬁed as function of rank.

To show that the method is better than random selection of miRNA—
disease pairs, we as background use equiprobable sampling of all possible
pairs that can be made from the miRNAs and diseases in the gold stand-
ard. In Figure 1 this corresponds to a straight line with a slope of
236/(92 - 48).

2.5 Pathway enrichment analysis

To analyze if the proteins that mediate miRNA—disease associations are
predominantly involved in certain biological pathways, we started from
the three sets of medium-conﬁdence miRNA—protein—disease associ-
ations described in Section 3. Because some of the multiple proteins
that together support a certain miRNA—disease association may contrib-
ute little, we focused the analysis on the set of proteins that gives the
highest single contribution to at least one miRNA—disease association.
This resulted in 93 922 and 376 unique proteins for the Croft-, MiRanda-
and TargeScan-based datasets, respectively. For use in the statistical
analysis, we further compiled a list of the 14871 proteins involved in
protein—disease associations according to the text mining of Medline ab-
stracts described earlier in the text. On these lists we used the DAVID
tool (Huang et al., 2009a, b) to identify statistically signiﬁcantly enriched
KEGG pathways (Kanehisa et al., 2012) for each of the three lists of
proteins connecting miRNAs and diseases relative to the background set.
We also used DAVID to identify enriched Gene Ontology terms, which
gave results consistent with the pathway analysis (data not shown).
Owing to the sparsity of the protein—disease associations derived from
Uniprot and GHR, only few (<28) of the benchmark miRNA—disease
associations are of miRNAs or diseases that are present in the input data,
hindering reliable prediction performance evaluation.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Resource of miRNA—protein—disease associations

We have combined three sets of curated and predicted miRNA—
protein association approaches with text-mined protein—disease
associations and scored the resulting miRNA—disease associ-
ations using the two scoring schemes described in Section 2
[U(M , D) and V(M, D)]. To make the data easily available for
use by other researchers, we have set up a web resource (http://
mirpd.jensenlab.org) that enables users to search, e.g. for a cer-
tain miRNA.

3.2 Assessment of inferred associations

To assess the quality of the associations in the resource, we com-
pare the miRNAs—protein—disease associations to the small gold
standard set of miRNA—disease associations from Chen and
Zhang (2013). Because the latter set presumably is only a tiny
fraction of the actual miRNA—disease associations, it is impos-
sible to estimate the number of false positives and hence the
positive predictive value. However, because it is possible to esti-
mate the number of true positives, we can plot this as function of
the total number of positive predictions and compare it with the
expectation from a random background model (Fig. 1a).
Figure 1a shows that irrespective of the source of miRNA—
protein associations, the inferred miRNA—protein—disease asso-
ciations capture more of the miRNA—disease associations from
the gold standard than expected at random. Unsurprisingly, the
reliability of the inferred associations depends on the quality of
the miRNA—protein associations. The most reliable inferred

in the benchmark dataset is presented here, resulting in fewer data points
than in the full prediction sets

associations are obtained when using the manually curated set
of miRNA—protein associations (Croft et al., 2012); however,
this also results in considerably fewer associations than when
making use of predicted miRNA—protein associations. We also
see that MiRanda predictions result in a slightly better ranking

than that of TargetScan predictions. Using the alternative scor-
ing scheme V(M, D) gave comparable but worse results (data not
shown).

An alternative way to plot the data is to instead plot the fold
enrichment of correct miRNA—disease associations over the
expectation from a random background model (Fig. 1b). The
major advantage of using fold enrichment is that it can be ac-
curately estimated using even an incomplete gold standard set.

Consistent with Figure 1a, the highest fold enrichment of up to
10 is seen for the top-ranked inferences based on the manually
curated miRNA—protein associations from Croft et al. (2012).
Inferences based on MiRanda and TargetScan both give up to
6-fold enrichment, with the fold enrichment for the MiRanda-
based inferences dropping off slower than for the TargetScan-
based ones.

For convenience, we deﬁne high-conﬁdence and medium-con-
ﬁdence subsets of the miRNA—protein—disease associations
inferred from the Croft-, MiRanda- and TargetScan-based
miRNA—protein associations. From inspection of Figure 1b,
we decided to use the score cutoffs corresponding to 5-fold
and 3.5-fold enrichment to deﬁne the high-conﬁdence and
medium-conﬁdence sets, respectively. In total the medium-conﬁ-
dence sets contain 14599 miRNA—protein—disease associations
among 1169 miRNAs, 1570 proteins and 738 disease terms.
These ﬁltered as well as the complete unﬁltered lists of inferred
miRNA—protein—disease associations are available for download
at http://mirpd.jensenlab.org.

3.3 Functional categorization of intermediate proteins

To characterize the functions, proteins that mediate the inference
of miRNA—disease associations, we focused on the proteins
within the three sets of medium-conﬁdence associations that
most strongly connect the miRNAs and diseases (see Section 2
for details). For each of these, we identiﬁed statistically signiﬁ-
cantly pathways from the KEGG database (Kanehisa et al.,
2012), which are listed in Table 2. The lists are dominated by
pathways for various forms of cancer as well as signal-transduc-
tion pathways known to play important roles in cancer such as
ErbB and p53 signaling.

Besides cancer-related pathways, the analyses of both the
MiRanda— and TargetScan-based miRNA—protein—disease asso-
ciations show an enrichment for proteins involved in Type I dia-
betes mellitus as well as viral myocarditis. Existing literature
already suggests a role for miRNAs in both of these diseases
(Poy et al., 2004; Xu et al., 2012); however, our method expands
on this by directly suggesting which proteins may mediate a cer-
tain miRNA—disease association.

3.4 Case study: miRNA-181 and diabetes mellitus

The pathway analysis revealed a statistically signiﬁcant enrich-
ment for proteins involved in the type I diabetes mellitus path-
way. To demonstrate the ability of our miRNA—protein—disease
associations to pinpoint potentially causal proteins, we examined
the links between miRNAs and diabetes in more detail.

For the medium-conﬁdence miRNA—disease associations
based on the TargetScan miRNA—protein associations, 64
miRNAs are associated with diabetes mellitus. Of these, the
four members of the miR-l8l family (miR-l8la, miR-l8lb,

miR-18lc and miR-181d) stand out, ranking ﬁfth to eight most
diabetes-related miRNAs in that prediction set. MicroRNA-181
is known from the literature to be associated with diabetes (Li
et al., 2011).

The protein that most strongly connects miR-181 to diabetes
mellitus is glutamate decarboxylase 2, which is one of the eight
proteins also found on the type I diabetes mellitus pathway
(Table 2). Another protein that stands out is sirtuin-l, which
ranks 9th, 9th, 7th and 8th for miR-181a, miR-181b, miR-1810
and miR-181d, respectively. It is a nicotinamide adenine di-
nucleotide-dependent deacetylase that acts as a positive regulator
of insulin signaling (Liang et al., 2009). Moreover, it has been
shown that downregulation of miR-181a upregulates sirtuin-l
and increases insulin sensitivity in hepatic cells (Zhou et al.,
2012).

This illustrates that using the protein-driven miRNA—disease
associations not only reveals potentially new miRNAs involved
in diseases but also provides candidate proteins as molecular
hypotheses underpinning the associations, which can be tested,
e.g. through knockdown of the mRNA or mutagenesis of the
miRNA target region.

4 DISCUSSION

Whereas the awareness of miRNA—disease associations is grow-
ing, existing methods for identifying such associations falls in
two broad categories: (i) text mining and curation of direct as-
sociations from literature and (ii) machine learning-based predic-
tion methods. Generally, these approaches do not consider or
attempt to identify the proteins that presumably mediate most of
the interactions between miRNAs and diseases. Consequently,
these studies contain relative few pointers for how further experi-
mental analysis of speciﬁc cases (predictions) can be carried out.
We meet this challenge by developing a method, miRPD, which
explicitly includes the protein link between miRNA and disease.
Even though this protein-driven approach overall result in fewer
miRNAs and diseases than previously published studies, having
the protein as an explicit part of the output readily allows the
researcher to take up more far more explicit actions toward
design of experiments.

We have showed that our approach, which explicitly combines
miRNA—protein and protein—disease associations, results in
miRNA—disease associations of much better quality than that
of a random background. This was observed consistently for
three sets of miRNA—protein associations: a hand-curated set
of miRNA targets and the two popular target predictions meth-
ods MiRanda and TargetScan. In all three cases, we were able to
obtain a high-conﬁdence set of miRNA—protein—disease associ-
ations for which the rankings held a 5-fold enrichment over
random. We similarly deﬁned three medium-conﬁdence sets
with 3.5-fold enrichment.

Our resource (http://mirpd.jensenlab.org) provides a search
interface for the three medium-conﬁdence sets of 14 599
miRNA—protein—disease associations, connecting 1169
miRNAs to 738 diseases through 1570 proteins, that is automat-
ically updated whenever new protein—disease associations
become available, and features hyperlink for the protein entries
to http//:diseases.jensenlab.org. This was exempliﬁed by a case
study of the involvement of miR-181 and diabetes mellitus,

The DAVID tool (Huang et al., 2009a, b) was used to identify statistically signiﬁ-
cantly enriched KEGG pathways (Kanehisa et al., 2012) for each of the three
medium-conﬁdence sets of miRNA—protein—disease associations. The P-values
listed have been corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini—Hochberg pro-
cedure, and all pathways with a corrected P—value of lE-3 or better are shown.

which revealed glutamate decarboxylase 2 and sirtuin-l as likely
causal molecular links between the miRNA and the disease.

Analyzing the proteins that most strongly connect miRNAs to
diseases, we found a strong enrichment for cancer-related KEGG
pathways. This can be due to (i) study bias in the miRNA ﬁeld,
or (ii) miRNAs actually being more involved in cancer than in
other diseases. The latter is consistent with cancer being a disease
of cellular regulation.

To our knowledge, we here provide the ﬁrst resource of
miRNA—disease associations, which explicitly lists proteins that
are likely to mediate the association. The perspectives for further
development of the method include taking into account expres-
sion data, combining target prediction methods into a single
scoring scheme and including, e.g. other types of data such as
co-expression and CliP-Seq.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Assessing the false positive rate of function prediction
methods is difficult, as it is hard to establish that a protein does
not have a certain function. To determine to what extent proteins
with similar sequences have a common function, we focused
on photosynthesis-related proteins. A protein that comes from a
non-photosynthetic organism is, undoubtedly, not involved in
photosynthesis.

Results: We show that function diverges very rapidly: 70% of the
close homologs of photosynthetic proteins come from non-
photosynthetic organisms. Therefore, high sequence similarity,
in most cases, is not tantamount to similar function. However,
we found that many functionally similar proteins often share short
sequence elements, which may correspond to a functional site and
could reveal functional similarities more accurately than sequence
similarity.

Conclusions: These results shed light on the way biological function
is conserved in evolution and may help improve large-scale analysis
of protein function.

1 INTRODUCTION

Homology is believed to allow large-scale functional annotation.
Since the 19th century, similarity between biological entities is
deﬁned as homology, in case that they evolved from a common
ancestor, and as analogy, in case that they share a common
function (Owen and Cooper, 1843). Later deﬁnitions made
these terms mutually exclusive by deﬁning analogy as conver-
gence from two different ancestors (Fitch, 2000). Historically,
these terms were introduced by naturalists and were based on
anatomy and morphology. On the molecular level, however, they
are used more loosely (Fitch, 2000), and homology is often used
interchangeably with sequence similarity and is commonly
believed to reﬂect similar function (Harrington et al., 2007).
Thus, although the vast majority of known proteins were never
experimentally characterized, or even observed as RNA tran-
scripts (Boeckmann et al., 2003; Consortium, 2009), many of
them have functional annotations that are based on sequence
similarity to experimentally annotated proteins. These predicted

functions are often used to perform functional comparisons be-
tween genomes and to analyse metagenomic data (Harrington
et al., 2007). One such analysis reported that by using BLAST,
they were able to assign a function reliably to ~70% of the gene
products in new genomes (Harrington et al., 2007). Despite
the wide use of this approach, the performance of homology-
based methods for function prediction was rarely assessed
systematically.

Assessment of function prediction is sometimes considered ‘not
possible’. Assumptions regarding the relationship between se-
quence homology and functional analogy are difﬁcult to assess.
Many, if not most, of the proteins are multi-functional (Freitas
et al., 2009), making existing annotations partial. Therefore,
when a predicted function does not correspond to an experimen-
tally veriﬁed function of a protein, it is hard to determine
whether it is a false prediction or a true prediction of a
yet-unobserved function of that protein. Several collaborations
and community-wide efforts have attempted to establish stand-
ards for assessment of computational annotation of protein func-
tion (Blaschke et al., 2005; Friedberg et al., 2006). The genome
annotation assessment project (Reese et al., 2000), an early
attempt at quality assessment of genome-wide annotation,
concluded that “function predictions are the most difﬁcult anno-
tations to produce and to evaluate’ and that owing to the incom-
pleteness of existing annotation, ‘a consistent and correct
assessment of function predictions. . . was not possible’. CASP,
which was originally designed to assess structure prediction
methods, has widened its scope to assess also the function pre-
dictions (Lopez et al., 2007; Soro and Tramontano, 2005). The
assessors concluded, however, that except for the identiﬁcation
of ligand-binding residues, which is in essence structural, they
could not ﬁnd a procedure that allows quantitative assessment
of performance (Lopez et al., 2007). AFP/CAFA, another
community-wide effort to establish a framework for assessing
function prediction, was held ﬁve times since 2005 (Friedberg
et al., 2006; Rodrigues et al., 2007). The organizers based their
experiments on proteins whose functions were experimentally
determined but not yet published. Assessment is based on mea-
suring the distance between predicted and experimental annota-
tions on the Gene Ontology (GO) graph. The benchmark sets
that were established using this approach are small and do not
allow for statistically signiﬁcant assessment. The lack of clear
deﬁnition of function is also a major drawback in assessing func-
tion prediction.

Studies that have assessed sequence similarity as a means
for determining functional similarity gave contradicting results.
Some concluded that sequence identity <80% (Rost, 2002)

or, by other accounts, 60% (Tian and Skolnick, 2003) do not
allow for reliable functional inference. Similarly, several studies
have warned against blindly trusting homology as a proxy for
functional identity (Gerlt and Babbitt, 2000). Studies that
explored the potential for errors in genomic scale computational
annotations (Bork and Koonin, 1998; Brenner, 1999; Devos and
Valencia, 2001; Schnoes et al., 2009; Tatusov et al., 2003) re-
ported error rates of between 5% and >60%.

Motifs and patterns identify similarity that is not based on hom-
ology. Another widely used tool for function assignment is se-
quence motifs, domains and patterns using tools such as Prosite
(Sigrist et al., 2002), Interpro (Mulder and preiler, 2002), Pfam
(Sonnhammer et al., 1997), MEX (Kunik et al., 2007) or MEME
(Bailey et al., 2009). These tools typically provide a statistical
measure for the signiﬁcance of the speciﬁc motif, similar to
BLAST’s E-Value. For instance, MEME’s E-Value, which is
based on log likelihood ratio, width, sites, the background
letter frequencies and the size of the training set, is an estimate
of the expected number of motifs with the given log likelihood
ratio (or higher), and with the same width and site count, that
one would ﬁnd in a similarly sized set of random sequences.
Typically, these tools do not search for homology. Rather,
they assume that common sequence motifs, which may reveal
very distant homology or may be convergent analogy, constitute
functional determinants, biologically important residues, binding
sites or active sites in the protein (Aitken, 1999; Kunik et al.,
2007; Sigrist et al., 2002; Wade, 2002). The precision and recall of
Pfam as a means for function prediction was assessed in one
study together with that of PSI-BLAST (Wass and Sternberg,
2008) as a benchmark for a GO-based function prediction
method. Several other studies analysed the relationship between
sequence similarity, domain conservation and function predic-
tion (Heger et al., 2005; Portugaly et al., 2006; Schug et al.,
2002). Some of them concluded that tools such as ProDom
could reach accuracy of 87% in their functional assignments
(Schug et al., 2002).

Function prediction of ORFans is particularly difficult. Many,
possibly most, known protein sequences come from metage-
nomic projects that produce sequences of unidentiﬁed species,
and include substantial numbers of ORFans, novel protein
families and remote homologs to known proteins (Ellrott et al.,
2010). It has been suggested that metagenomic data can shed new
light on many biological processes, including photosynthesis (PS)
(Yutin and Beja, 2005), as many marine organisms are believed
to be photosynthetic (Cuvelier et al., 2010), and their divergence
from known terrestrial photosynthetic organisms may be large.
Indeed, metagenomic data have led to the identiﬁcation of novel
proteins that provide insights into PS (Yutin and Beja, 2005).
Identifying novel families of photosynthetic proteins that are not
obvious homologs of known PS proteins is a non-trivial task.
However, when it comes to ORFans, the lack of homologs pre-
cludes the use of homology-based methods altogether.

PS provides a way to assess function prediction. We focus our
analysis on PS-related functions not only for the importance of
identifying novel photosynthetic proteins but also because they
provide a way to assess functional assignments. An assignment
of photosynthetic annotation to a protein that comes from an
organism that is not photosynthetic is, without doubt, an error.
Thus, it is possible to unequivocally identify false assignments

and assess the possibility of ﬁnding novel photosynthetic families
and remote homologs to known PS-related proteins. We used
GO to compile a list of functions that are unique to PS (i.e. GO
terms that describe functions, which are essential to PS but are
also part of other biological processes, were not included in the
analysis, see Section 2). We also created a non-redundant set of
proteins that were experimentally veriﬁed to be involved in PS.
Finally, we identiﬁed all Pfam domains that are related to PS.
These lists of proteins, GO terms and Pfam domains allowed
us to assess function assignments by Pfam, BLAST and
PSI-BLAST. In addition, using MEME, we generated a list of
short motifs (6—9 characters) for the experimentally veriﬁed PS
proteins and used these motifs to predict the functions of new
proteins. We thus explore conservation of function by assessing
the performance of widely used methods that rely on completely
different biological rationales.

2 METHODS
2.1 Materials

2.1.] UniPrOIKB UniProtKB is composed of SWISS-PROT and
TrEMBL. The TrEMBL (Boeckmann et al., 2003) database contains
most known protein sequences. Unlike SWISS-PROT (Boeckmann
et al., 2003), it also contains fragments of proteins and proteins translated
computationally from metagenomic data (Consortium, 2009).

2.1.2 Parsing UniProtKB We parsed all entries in UniProtKB and
searched the DR section for Pfam domains. Parsing was done in Python.

2.1.3 PS at G0 From all GO ontologies, we extracted all child
terms of PS and their child terms, recursively. From this list, we removed
terms that are also children of terms that do not belong to the list. That is,
terms that descend from PS but also from other functions that are not PS
or its descendants, were removed. The remaining terms were deﬁned as
unique to PS. We found 184 991 proteins with these terms. Many of these
proteins have PS-relevant annotation in more than one of the ontologies
(Hill et al., 2008). We excluded from the analysis all annotations that were
based on predictions. The evidence codes we used are therefore: EXP,
IDA, IPI, IMP, IGI, IEP, TAS and NAS. We were left with 1425 pro-
teins. Supplementary Table S1 lists these proteins. The G0 numbers that
were used are listed in Supplementary Table S2. The distribution of the
different codes we found is presented in Supplementary Table S11.

2.2 Redundancy reduction

We removed redundancy from the set of experimentally annotated photo-
synthetic proteins and from the predicted sequences using CD-HIT (Yang
et al., 2010), which clusters all proteins by similarity over length param-
eters (at least 50% similarity on 90% of protein’s length in our case).
From each such cluster, we retained a single representative. In the case of
the set of experimentally annotated photosynthetic proteins, this resulted
in 1256 unique proteins.

The CD-HIT redundancy reduction was done with the following
command:

cd-hit -i <1425 fasta sequences> -o <output ﬁle> -aL 0.9 -c 0.5 -n 3 -T 0

Using different cut-offs for similarity (e. g. aL 0.75 —c 0.8) did not change
the overall trends (data not shown).

Relationship between conservation of function and conservation of sequence

 

2.3 Pfam motifs

We searched for all the UniProtKB sequences that contain a Pfam
domain. We identiﬁed 267 599 proteins from UniProtKB that are anno-
tated as photosynthetic by Pfam. As our assessment is based on deter-
mining whether the organism itself is photosynthetic, we considered
only proteins from a known organism, not environmental samples
or metagenomic sequences. The identiﬁcation was based on 84 Pfam
families, which were annotated as PS families by Pfam and were manually
checked. The families are listed in Supplementary Table S5.

Pfam-GO motifs were extracted from InterPro (Lopez et al., 2007).
The families are listed in Supplementary Table S4.

2.4 Creating short PS motifs
Using MEME (Bailey et al., 2009; Bailey et al., 2006),

(1) we extracted 400 signiﬁcant 6—9 characters sequence motifs for the
set MEME6..9. After ﬁltering (see Section 2.5), we were left with
390 motifs.

(2) we extracted 300 signiﬁcant 7—9 characters sequence motifs for the
set MEME7..9. After ﬁltering (see section 2.5), we were left with
293 motifs.

These two sets of motifs were used to test how longer and shorter motifs
fair in predicting function.

2.5 Motif elimination

To avoid statistical biases, we did not use any motif that had more than

three repetitions of the same amino acid. e.g. ‘HHHHHH[HQ][PR]’ is

unacceptable, whereas ‘HHHTHH[HQ][PR]’ is valid. Furthermore, in

speciﬁc motifs, which had parentheses with the problematic extra re-

peated amino acid, we decided to modify the expression in the parenth-

eses and keep the motif, as can be seen in Supplementary Table S10.
The MEME search was done with the following commands:

meme <1256 fasta sequences> -protein -mod zoops -nmotifs 100 -minsites
2 -maxsites 300 -minw 6 -maxw 6 -maxsize 650000

meme <1256 fasta sequences> -protein -mod zoops -nmotifs 100 -minsites
2 -maxsites 300 -minw 7 -maxw 7 -maxsize 650000

meme <1256 fasta sequences> -protein -mod zoops -nmotifs 100 -minsites
2 -maxsites 300 -minw 8 -maxw 8 -maxsize 650000

meme <1256 fasta sequences> -protein -mod zoops -nmotifs 100 -minsites
2 -maxsites 300 -minw 9 -maxw 9 -maxsize 650000

The resulting motifs sets are listed in Supplementary Tables S6, S7, S8
and S9. Note that long motifs may have a highly signiﬁcant E-Value and
yet be of very little use, as they are not likely to be found in other proteins
that are not a close homolog to the one from which the motif was derived.

2.6 Predictions based on MEME

The sequence motifs created by MEME were used to retrieve all the
proteins that contain any of them.

2.7 HSSP

HSSP score between proteins was calculated based on the HSSP curve
(Schneider et al., 1997). A protein was predicted to be photosynthetic if
it had an HSSP score of 210 with one of the experimentally annotated
PS proteins in the initial set of experimentally annotated proteins.

2.8 Assessing motifs

To assess the precision of the predictions, we checked whether a predicted
PS protein comes from a species that belongs to taxonomy ranks that

perform PS. The taxonomy ranks are listed in Supplementary Table S3.
This was done to get the most optimistic assessment of the prediction. All
other proteins with traceable source (e.g. proteins from vertebrates) were
marked as false positives. Precision, which measures what fraction of the
proteins that are predicted to be PS related are, indeed, PS related, is deﬁned
as:

[P
119 +fp (1)
where tp is the number of true positive predictions, namely the number of
proteins predicted to be photosynthetic that originated from a photosyn-
thetic organisms, and fp is the number of proteins predicted as photosyn-
thetic that originated from a non-photosynthetic organism. Precision is
typically complemented by another measure, recall, deﬁned as:

[P
tp + fn

where fn is the number of false negative predictions.

Recall assesses how well the method identiﬁes the desired instances in
the dataset. It is impossible to get an exact assessment of the recall in this
case, as there is no benchmark set that includes all proteins that are
involved in PS. As a proxy for recall, we recorded the number of hits,
namely the number of proteins predicted by each method to be PS
related. Combined with the precision, this measure provides an assess-
ment of the performance of a prediction method.

 

precision =

recall 2

2.9 Assessing sequence similarity as a prediction method

We performed BLAST and PSI-BLAST searches against the UniProtKB
using our initial dataset of 1256 experimentally annotated PS proteins as
queries. From the initial dataset, we looked for all BLAST results with
0 g E-Value g 1. PSI-BLAST parameters were as follows: Database
used—UniProtKB; Number of iterations—3; PSI-BLAST Threshold
for next iteration—0.001. In the end of the third iteration, we used all
proteins with E-Value 0 5 E—Value 5 1 as our dataset.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Photosynthetic-related proteins

Of 15082 690 entries in UniProtKB, we extracted 184991 with
PS-related GO annotations. Of these, only 1425 proteins have
GO evidence codes that are based on experiments. Clustering
these proteins with CD-HIT (Yang et al., 2010) yielded 1256
sequence-unique experimentally annotated proteins. We used
these proteins to identify new putative photosynthetic proteins
based on sequence similarity, using BLAST and PSI-BLAST. It
has been shown that using HSSP (Schneider et al., 1997) to re-
score homology based also on the length of the alignment and
not only on the sequence similarity can improve homology-based
predictions (Rost, 2002). Therefore, we also assessed the per-
formance of HSSP scores. We also extracted short sequence
motifs from the initial set of sequence unique experimentally
annotated proteins and used them to annotate other proteins
as putatively PS related. In addition, we found in Pfam all the
domains that are marked in Pfam as related to functions that are
exclusively photosynthetic and used these domains to identify
other proteins that are putatively PS related. Finally, we used
the InterPro mapping of Pfam to GO terms (Lopez et al., 2007),
which is a manual assignment of Pfam domains to speciﬁc func-
tions in a similar manner to predict function of new proteins.

3.2 Short sequence motifs

Four hundred short sequence motifs were extracted by MEME
from our non-redundant dataset of 1256 experimentally anno-
tated PS proteins. The motifs are listed in Supplementary
Tables S6, S7, S8 and S9. After ﬁltering (see Section 2), we
were left with 390 motifs that were used in two separated sets:
MEME6..9, comprising all the motifs, and MEME7..9 (293
motifs), comprising only the longer motifs of length 7, 8 or 9.

3.3 Assessing precision for all methods

Figure 1 shows the precision and the number of hits for all the
approaches. A functional assignment was deﬁned as false if the
query protein comes from a genus that is not known to include
any photosynthetic species (see Section 2). Thus, the real preci-
sion is probably lower, as this assessment disregards false func-
tion assignments for proteins within photosynthetic genera.
Proteins in photosynthetic organisms constitute close to 15%
of UniProtKB proteins, and therefore random assignment of
function is expected to have precision of around 0.15. All meth-
ods have precision that is substantially higher than random.
BLAST, PSI-BLAST and Pfam are within a similar range
(between 0.27 for PSI-BLAST and Pfam and 0.29 for BLAST).
The two sets of MEME yield different results: MEME6..9
reaches precision of 0.3, similar to the other methods, whereas
functional assignments that are based on the longer motifs of
MEME7..9 reach substantially more accurate precision of 0.43.

400000

The variability in the number of hits was greater than that of the
precision, with PSI-BLAST (against UniProtKB, see Section 2)
identifying almost 10 hits for every hit of Pfam and >30 hits for
every hit of MEME. Interestingly, the manually curated domains
of Pfam-GO yielded exceptional precision of 0.74; however,
the hits were meager. The reported results are after redundancy
reduction with CD—HIT (Yang et al., 2010) (see Section 2).
These results are, by and large, consistent with the known
trade-off between precision and recall, by which more accurate
methods have lower discovery rates. The extreme case is that of
the manually curated set of Pfam-GO. It is clear that these care-
fully selected domains are very tightly associated with PS.
However, these domains can hardly identify any new proteins.
We found that Virtually all the proteins that are identiﬁed by
Pfam-GO could be identiﬁed by BLAST or PSI-BLAST (data
not shown). To assess how well each of these approaches iden-
tiﬁes novel families, we checked the overlap between the
non-redundant set of Pfam and all the other redundant sets,
and the non-redundant set of MEME 6..9 and all the other re-
dundant sets. The reason we performed the comparison this way
is that we wish to determine how many of the unique sequences
identiﬁed by Pfam and MEME, respectively, overlap with any
protein identiﬁed by the other methods. HSSP, by deﬁnition, is
contained within BLAST results; hence, its potential advantage
is only in identifying better hits within BLAST hits, and not
in identifying novel families. Similarly, BLAST hits are almost
contained within PSI—BLAST hits (depending on PSI—BLAST

Fig. 2. Overlap between the novel proteins identiﬁed by each method.
Although HSSP, BLAST and PSI-BLAST overlap very signiﬁcantly by
deﬁnition, to assess the unique protein families identiﬁed by MEME and
Pfam, we compared the non-redundant (nr) set of hits for each of them to
the full set of the other methods. The numbers in parentheses next to the
circles are the number of hits for each method. The numbers inside the
circles (with percentage in parentheses) are the numbers of proteins that
were not identiﬁed by other methods. For example, the non-redundant
set of proteins identiﬁed by Pfam as photosynthetic included 33 183 pro-
teins. In all, 24 644 of these proteins, or 74% of them, were not identiﬁed
by BLAST or PSI-BLAST. The overlap between the unique hits of
MEME and Pfam was very low (only 392 proteins)

parameters). Figure 2 shows the results of this comparison. In all,
74% and 46% of the unique sequences identiﬁed by Pfam and
MEME, respectively, are not detected by any of the other
methods.

A possible way to further improve the precision of sequence
motifs or domains is by trusting only proteins in which multiple
motifs occur. Using MEME6..9 and MEME7..9, we found 805
different combinations of short motifs that occur in 5652 pro-
teins, and 460 different combinations of short motifs that occur
in 3922 proteins, respectively. Using Pfam and Pfam-GO, we
found 22 different combinations of Pfam domains that occur
in 403 proteins, and nine different combinations of Pfam do-
mains that occur in 164 proteins, respectively.

As shown in Figure 3, this increased the precision of
MEME6..9 and MEME7..9 to 0.55 and 0.6, respectively, and
the precision of Pfam to 0.45. Clearly, this comes on the account
of the number of hits. The manual set of domains identiﬁed by
Pfam-GO reaches precision of 0.98, but the number of hits drops
to 164 proteins—an order of magnitude below the size of the
initial set of experimentally annotated proteins, which suggests
that in this setting Pfam-GO is unable to ﬁnd novel PS—related
proteins. The number of hits for Pfam was also low (403). This is
not surprising, given that Pfam motifs, by design, tend to be
much longer than MEME motifs.

3.4 Smaller E-value does not always imply more similar
function

Several studies have searched for a level of sequence similarity

that can assure identical function (Rost, 2002). To test whether

closer homologs are less functionally divergent, we checked the

precision and number of hits for different ranges of E-Values. As
shown in Figure 4, the effect of increasing E-Value on precision is
hardly noticeable for most E-Values. There is a signiﬁcant in-
crease in precision only for very small E-Values. Thus, at least
for PS proteins, it seems that more signiﬁcant E-Values may not
increase precision in most cases. The precision of the un-binned
sets (Fig. l) is slightly lower than the precision of the binned
data. This effect is due to the redundancy in the un-binned
sets. A protein may be homologous to several proteins from
our initial set and thus appear in several bins, each time different
E-Values. This is more likely to happen to a real photosynthetic
protein (i.e. a PS protein is more likely than a non-PS protein
to be similar to several PS proteins). When we group all the
BLAST results together without binning different E-Values.
This protein will appear only once. When we bin them according
to their E-Value, it may appear in several different bins.
Therefore, redundancy reduction of hits for the binned sets,
which was done for each bin separately, has a slightly higher
chance of retaining positive examples than redundancy reduction
for the entire set.

3.5 Errors in short motifs-based functional annotation
of PS proteins

Reviewing the false positive predictions, namely proteins that
were wrongly identiﬁed as PS related, revealed some common
errors. Although some proteins, such as Q27472_CAEEL
(found by PSI-BLAST) from Caenorhabditis elegans or
QOPWTl_DIACI (found by Pfam) from Asian citrus psyllid
(an insect), come from organisms that are undoubtedly not
photosynthetic, other cases are more subtle. Some of these an-
notations can be explained by similarity of functions: proteins,
which are involved in the electron transport chain, ATP trans-
formers or ubiquinon related functions, which are part of the PS
process, may be homologous to proteins in similar processes in
non-photosynthetic organisms and thus might be mistakenly
associated with PS. Some proteins may have an ancestral
source among PS organisms. Although they evolved to different
functions, the motif may have remained intact. A4IE64_LEIIN
is an example for a protein that includes several strongly predict-
ive PS-related motifs, but belongs to Leishmania infantum (a
non-photosynthetic eukaryote). Previous studies have shown
that trypanosomatid parasites, including Leishmania, possessed
a plastid at some point in their evolutionary history, and that
their extant genomes contain ‘plant—like’ genes encoding homo-
logs of proteins found in either chloroplasts or in the cytosol of
plants and algae (Hannaert et al., 2003; Weber and Fischer,
2007). Another source of false positive is marine Viruses.
Q6H943_9CAUD is one of many proteins that were predicted
by Pfam to be PS2 complex proteins but come from Viral gen-
omes. A recent study (Sharon et al., 2009) revealed the presence
of PS proteins in marine Viruses. Obviously, false positive may
arise also from short motifs that randomly occur in some
sequences.

Fig. 3. Performance of multiple domains and multiple short motifs. Trusting only the functional assignments that are based on at least two motifs (or
domains) of MEME (or Pfam) in each protein resulted in better overall precision at the cost of fewer hits. The manually curated domains of Pfam-GO
reach striking precision of 0.98; however, they hardly discovered any proteins, and MEME7..9 reached precision of 0.6 with 3922 hits. The yellow and

red bars represent the results for the manually curated motifs in Pfam-GO

homology and remote homology based on sequence similarity.
Although there are more direct ways to assess homology (e.g.
through phylogentic analysis), these methods gained their popu-
larity, among other reasons, because of the implicit assumption
that they are quick to identify functionally related sequences.
Our results, however, show that these expectations may not be
correct, particularly when it comes to the annotation of metage-
nomic data. Despite the sophistication of Pfam, its precision is
not better than that of the universally applicable PSI-BLAST,
BLAST or automatically detected short motifs, and it ﬁnds much
less proteins than BALST or PSI-BLAST. However, most of the
protein families Pfam identiﬁes could not be detected by the
other methods. BLAST itself provides at least 70% false func-
tional assignments, which improves only for extremely high
E-Vlaues (Fig. 4). Our results indicate that using the manually
curated motifs of Pfam-GO leads to the most reliable predictions
of function. However, the extremely low number of hits indicates
that this approach hardly ﬁnds novel proteins and identiﬁes
mostly the proteins that were used to extract the motifs. Short
motifs identiﬁed by MEME, which may be poor indicators of
homology can reﬂect function more accurately than homology-

based methods. However, this comes at the cost of lower number
of hits. As shown in Figure 2, our results reﬂect the complemen-
tarity of the different approaches: BLAST, Pfam and short
motifs identify novel proteins that could not be detected by the
other methods. Of the true positives of MEME7..9, 20% are not
discovered by any other method. Of the PFAM true positives,
76% are not discovered by any other method. It is possible to
improve precision on the account of recall for short motifs by
requiring more than one motif in each protein. It is possible to
achieve similar improvement by increasing BLAST E-Value.
Thus, at least when it comes to the ability to discover new PS
proteins in metagenomic data, the combination of short
motif-based approaches with homology-based ones seems a pro-
mising path.

It is not clear whether sharing a common sequence motif (or a
combination thereof) is more likely to be the result of remote
homology or the result of convergence. This question has far-
reaching implications for the understanding of the evolution of
function. Addressing it may require the development of new
tools for the analysis of function and a thorough review of the
phylogeny of each sequence. We can speculate that some

Fig. 4. Precision and number of hits for different BLAST E—Values. To assess to what extent more signiﬁcant sequence similarities imply greater
functional similarity, we checked the precision and recall (after redundancy reduction) of different intervals of BLAST E-Values, using all 1256 experi-

mentally annotated PS-related proteins in our set as queries

functions are more likely than others to be predictable-based
sequence motifs. For example, in the GO classiﬁcations, molecu-
lar function may be more predicable from motifs than biological
processes. However, for each function this should be assessed
separately.

4 CONCLUSIONS

Photosynthetic proteins provide an opportunity to assess the
false positive rate of function prediction methods. At least for
photosynthetic proteins, false positive rate of methods that
are based on overall sequence similarity is ~70%. Short
motifs-based approaches have false positive rate of 57%, but
this improved precision comes with lower discovery rate.
Beyond the evolutionary insights that may be drawn from
these ﬁndings, they indicate that combining these approaches
will improve large-scale function prediction

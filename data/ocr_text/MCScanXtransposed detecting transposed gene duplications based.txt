ABSTRACT

Summary: Gene duplication occurs via different modes such as seg-
mental and single-gene duplications. Transposed gene duplication, a
specific form of single-gene duplication, ‘copies’ a gene from an an-
cestral chromosomal location to a novel location. MCScanX is a toolkit
for detection and evolutionary analysis of gene colinearity. We have
developed MCScanX-transposed, a software package to detect trans-
posed gene duplications that occurred within different epochs, based
on execution of MCScanX within and between related genomes.
MCScanX-transposed can be also used for integrative analysis of
gene duplication modes for a genome and to annotate a gene family
of interest with gene duplication modes.

1 INTRODUCTION

Gene duplication is a primary mechanism for increasing genetic
complexity and diversity (Ohno, 1970). It has long been known
that gene duplication occurs via different modes (Freeling, 2009).
Large-scale gene duplications including whole-genome duplica-
tion ON GD) and segmental duplication have occurred in differ-
ent eukaryotic lineages such as fungi, plants and vertebrates
(Coghlan et al., 2005; Paterson et al., 2010). Single-gene duplica-
tions, also widespread in eukaryotic genomes, by mechanisms
include local (tandem or proximal) duplication, which creates
two nearby duplicated genes Wang et al., 2012b), and trans-
posed duplication, which ‘copies’ a gene from an ancestral loca-
tion to a novel (transposed) location via either DNA or
RNA-based mechanisms (Cusack and Wolfe, 2007). Different
modes of gene duplication may contribute differentially to the
evolution of speciﬁc lineages (Coghlan et al., 2005).

The retention of duplicated genes following different modes of
gene duplication is biased (Freeling, 2009). For example, in
Arabidopsis thaliana, following WGDs, genes related to tran-
scription factors, protein kinases and ribosomal proteins were
preferentially retained; local duplicates are enriched for genes
that encode membrane proteins and function in abiotic and

biotic stress; gene families such as F-box, MADS-box, NBS-
LRR and defensins are more likely to have transposed than
others (Freeling, 2009). Moreover, different modes of gene du-
plication often show distinct evolutionary consequences (De
Smet and Van de Peer, 2012; Wang et al., 2012b). In rodents,
transposed duplications show higher degrees of asymmetric se-
quence divergence than local duplications (Cusack and Wolfe,
2007). In A.thalicma, duplicated genes retained from single-gene
duplications, especially transposed duplication, are more likely to
show rewiring of gene networks than those retained from WGDs
(Arabidopsis Interactome Mapping Consortium, 2011; Wang
et al., 2012b).

To study the evolutionary dynamics of duplicated genes, it is
helpful to investigate gene duplication modes. Duplicated genes
originating from WGD, and segmental duplication can be ob-
tained by using software for detection of gene colinearity (hom-
ologous genes are in corresponding chromosomal regions and
conserved orders). However, to our knowledge, automated
tools for detecting transposed gene duplications are not
available.

Transposed duplications in a genome, and the epochs during
which they occurred, can be inferred based on colinearity con-
servation within and between related genomes Moodhouse
et al., 2011). MCScan is an algorithm to scan genomes to identify
colinear homologs and duplicated chromosomal regions (Tang
et al., 2008). M CSccmX is a toolkit for colinearity detection based
on an adjusted MCScan (i.e. M CScanX) algorithm and evolu-
tionary analyses of identiﬁed colinearity Wang et al., 2012a).
Here, we present MCScanX-transposed, a software package
based on execution of MCScanX within and between related
genomes, for detecting transposed gene duplications, which
occurred within different epochs, as well as integrative analysis
of gene duplication modes.

2 DESCRIPTION
2.1 Overview of the MCScanX-transposed package

The M CSccmX -transpased package is comprised of one core pro-
gram named MCScanX-transposed.pl, for detecting transposed
gene duplications that occurred within different epochs and
other modes of gene duplication including segmental, tandem
and proximal duplications, and five downstream analysis pro-
grams, for further analysis of identified gene duplications.

The M CSccmX -transpased package needs to be executed using
command lines, on Mac OS or Linux computers, where Xcode

or the Java SE Development Kit and ‘libpng’ should be pre-in-
stalled, respectively. The user is advised to read the ‘readme.txt’
ﬁle that provides detailed instructions on input ﬁle formats and
command line options.

2.2 Input of MCScanX-transposed.pl

Before the execution of M CScanX-transposea’.pl, ‘.gff’ and
‘.blast’ ﬁles, containing the chromosomal positions and homolo-
gous relationships (generated by BLASTP), respectively, for all
genes in a target genome, and at least one outgroup (i.e. related
genome that shows gene colinearity with the target genome),
should be available. Two types of BLASTP ﬁles are needed:
(i) an intra-species BLASTP ﬁle for the target genome and
(ii) inter-species BLASTP ﬁles between the target genome and
each of the outgroup genomes. We suggest that BLASTP retain
no more than ﬁve homologs for each query gene (Tang et al.,
2008; Wang et al., 2011) to reduce redundant duplication
relationships while allowing the identiﬁcation of fast-evolving
duplicated genes.

2.3 Algorithm for detecting transposed gene duplications

Transposed duplications ‘copy’ genes from ancestral loci (paren-
tal duplicates) to novel loci (transposed duplicates). Technically,
with ancestral and novel loci in the genome identiﬁed, a trans-
posed duplication can be discerned if a pair of dispersed (i.e.
distant and non-colinear) duplicated genes consists of an ances-
tral and a novel locus. The M CScanX -transposea’ algorithm
adopts a procedure for identifying transposed duplications
based on processing BLASTP output, which has been previously
shown to work well in A. thaliana and rice genomes (W ang et al.,
2011., 2013).

The intra-species BLASTP ﬁle of the target genome is deemed
the whole set of potential gene duplications. The M CScanX -
transposea’ algorithm ﬁrst executes the MCScanX algorithm
based on this intra-species BLASTP ﬁle, to generate colinear
gene pairs. These colinear gene pairs are regarded as segmental
duplications. The M CScanX -transp0sea’ algorithm then detects
tandem and proximal duplications, according to the following
criteria: tandem duplications are paralogs consecutive to each
other, and proximal duplications are paralogs near each other
but separated by a few non-paralogous genes (conﬁgurable) on
the chromosomes. The remaining dispersed gene duplications,
i.e. the BLASTP hits after segmental, tandem and proximal du-
plications are removed, are searched for transposed duplications.
Ancestral loci in the target genome are the inter-species colinear
genes generated by executing M CScanX on the inter-species
BLASTP ﬁles between the target and outgroup genomes. If a
dispersed gene duplication consists of an ancestral locus and a
novel locus, this duplication is deemed a transposed duplication.
For a transposed duplicate, there may be multiple ancestral loci
within an epoch. In this case, the transposed duplicate and its
ancestral locus with the highest sequence identity are deemed a
transposed duplication.

Based on sequential exclusion of the closest outgroup, the
M CScanX -transposea’ algorithm generates transposed duplica-
tions that occurred after different speciation events. The trans-
posed duplications that occurred within different epochs (i.e.
between different speciation events) are derived by set

subtraction of the transposed duplications that occurred after
different speciation events.

2.4 Execution of MCScanX-transposed.pl

To execute M CScanX -transp0sed.pl, the target and outgroup
genomes should be speciﬁed via the ‘-t’ and ‘-c’ options of the
command line. To detect transposed duplications that occurred
within a user-speciﬁed number (‘—x’ option) of epochs that are
marked by different speciation events, multiple outgroups must
be entered in the order of divergence from the target genome
(most recent ﬁrst).

On the successful execution of M CScanX - transposedpl, differ-
ent modes of gene duplication including segmental, tandem,
proximal and transposed duplications are output as separate
‘.pairs’ ﬁles, with each line containing one gene duplication. In
transposed duplications, the ﬁrst duplicated gene is the trans-
posed locus. If transposed duplications are classiﬁed into differ-
ent epochs, the transposed duplications belonging to each epoch
are also output as a separate ﬁle.

2.5 Downstream analysis programs

Five downstream analysis programs are available in the
M CScanX-transposed package. The program aa’a’_ka_ks.pl can
annotate gene duplication modes with non-synonymous (Ka)
and synonymous (Ks) substitution rates based on the Nei and
Gojobori method (1986). The program detect_a’ap_m0a’es_f0r_
a _gene.pl provides single-gene query from the M CScanX-trans—
posedpl output. The program detect_a’ap_m0a’es_f0r_a_family.pl
provides query for a gene family from the MCScanX-transpo-
sedpl output, which can be further visualized via a phylogenetic
tree in which duplicated gene pairs of different modes are
connected by curves of different colors, by the program
annotate_tree_with_a’ap_m0des, or a phylogenetic tree linked to
a chromosome ideogram in which each pair of transposed and
parental duplicates is demonstrated by a curve of unique color,
by the program annotate_tree_with_tra_a’ap.

3 USAGE EXAMPLE

To illustrate the usefulness of M CScanX -transp0sed, we applied
it to the genome of Arabidopsis thaliana, using ﬁve other eudicot
genomes as possible outgroups including Arabia’opsis lyrata,
Brassica rapa, Carica papaya, Populas trichocarpa and Vitis
vim'fera. The genome annotations were downloaded from
Phytozome (http://www.phytozome.net). For genes with mul-
tiple transcripts, the longest transcript was used. The phylogen-
etic relationships of the six genomes is shown in Figure 1A.
BLASTP was executed within A.thaliana and between
A.thaliana and each outgroup. For each gene, top ﬁve non-self
BLASTP hits with E—value<e_10 were retained. Detailed com-
mands for the usage example is described on the software
website.

First, we executed M CScanX -transp0sea’.pl for A.thaliana, spe-
cifying AJyrata, B.rapa, C.papaya, P.trichocarpa and V.vim'fera
as the outgroups and three epochs to be identiﬁed (‘—x 3’).
MCScanX-transposed.pl identiﬁed 4299 WGD/segmental, 2130
tandem, 784 proximal and 3766 transposed duplications, respect-
ively. Further, M CScanX -transp0sea’.pl identiﬁed 904 A.thaliana

divergence, 1114 that occurred between A.thaliana—A.lyrata and

Brassica and Arabia’opsis—Carica divergence. Comparison of the
Ks (a proxy of time since duplication) distributions of the trans-
posed duplications that occurred within these respective epochs
(Fig. 1B) is consistent with the phylogeny of the four genomes.

These identiﬁed gene duplication modes can be further used to
study the evolution of a gene family of interest. Here, we show an
analysis of 105 A. thaliana MADS-box genes (Parenicova et al.,
2003). The program detect_a’up_moa’es_for_a_family.pl identiﬁed
14 WGD/segmental, 6 tandem, 10 proximal and 31 transposed
duplications. Based on a ‘Newick’ format tree of the MADS-box
family, the program annotate_tree_with_a’up_moa’es visualized
the phylogenetic tree and annotated it with different duplication
modes (Supplementary Fig. S1), and the program annotate_
tree_with_tra_a’up visualized the phylogenetic tree and demon-
strated the gene transpositions between genomic locations
within different epochs for the MADS-box family
(Supplementary Figs S2—S4).

4 CONCLUSIONS

M CScanX -transposea’ is a software package able to detect trans-
posed gene duplications that occurred within different epochs,
also useful for integrative analysis of gene duplication modes.
M CScanX -transposea’ can be used to study gene duplication
mechanisms on both genome-wide and gene family levels.

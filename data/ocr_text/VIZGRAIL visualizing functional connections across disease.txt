ABSTRACT

Motivation: As disease loci are rapidly discovered, an emerging
challenge is to identify common pathways and biological functionality
across loci. Such pathways might point to potential disease
mechanisms. One strategy is to look for functionally related or
interacting genes across genetic loci. Previously, we defined a
statistical strategy, Gene Relationships Across Implicated Loci
(GRAIL), to identify whether pair-wise gene relationships defined
using PubMed text similarity are enriched across loci. Here, we
have implemented VIZ-GRAIL, a software tool to display those
relationships and to depict the underlying biological patterns.
Results: Our tool can seamlessly interact with the GRAIL web
site to obtain the results of analyses and create easy to read
visual displays. To most clearly display results, VIZ-GRAIL arranges
genes and genetic loci to minimize intersecting pair-wise gene
connections. VIZ-GRAIL can be easily applied to other types of
functional connections, beyond those from GRAIL. This method
should help investigators appreciate the presence of potentially
important common functions across loci.

1 INTRODUCTION

As genome—wide association studies rapidly identify genetic loci
for a broad range of phenotypes, investigators are critically focused
on identifying key pathways and biological processes suggested by
genetic ﬁndings (Iossifov et al., 2008; Lage et al., 2007; Perez—
Iratxeta et al., 2007; Rossin et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2007). We have
separately described a computational strategy, Gene Relationships
Across Implicated Loci (or GRAIL), that uses statistical text—mining
strategy to rapidly identify genes across multiple loci that are similar
to each other, and to then assess if that degree of similarity is more
than might be expected by chance (Raychaudhuri et al., 2009a). The
approach depends on pairs of related genes using 525 000 PubMed
article abstracts identiﬁed using word similarity metrics. GRAIL has
now been applied to prioritize SNPs for replication or to demonstrate
common function among genes near associated SNPs across a wide
range of phenotypes including height (Lango Allen et al., 2010),
rheumatoid arthritis (Raychaudhuri et al., 2009b), Crohn’s disease

(Franke et al., 2010) and cancer (Beroukhim et al., 2010). While
the GRAIL statistical approach calculates the statistical signiﬁcance
of the number and strength of functional similarity across loci, it
does not concisely illustrate functional similarities in an intuitive
fashion that reveals the underlying biology. Our goal was to produce
a Visualization that allowed users to see more clearly the underlying
genes and biological functionality driving the GRAIL statistical
scores.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

In order to make the GRAIL algorithm accessible online, we
have implemented it at http://www.broadinstitute.org/mpg/grail/
grail.php. The online interface is implemented with a PHP script.
Users enter genetic loci, typically as a list of SNPs or coordinates
of genomic segments, and select a gene similarity metric. Those
inputs are then passed onto backend software implemented in Perl
and MATLAB®, operating on an LSF cluster farm, and the user is
emailed when the job is completed with links to the online results
page. Gene similarity metrics can be based on word vector similarity
of PubMed text of abstracts referencing genes (Raychaudhuri, 2006),
of gene expression vector similarity in a gene expression database
(Su et al., 2004) or similarity in gene ontology terms (Ashburner
et al., 2000). The infrastructure is ﬂexible and can allow for deﬁning
alternative similarity metrics in the future.

In order to effectively display results, we implemented the VIZ—
GRAIL software in Perl that interacts with the GRAIL online site to
download the results of user—deﬁned analyses jobs, and to construct
high—quality display graphics of interactions between genes across
phenotypically associated loci. The different loci are arranged in
a circle, similar to Circos genome plots (Krzywinski et al., 2009).
Genetic loci are arranged around an outer circle, while genes within
them are grouped together in an inner circle. Lines are drawn
between functionally similar genes that are within different loci. The
VIZ—GRAIL program determines the thickness of lines between two
genes to be proportional to the relative similarity of the two genes,
and inversely proportional to the number of genes within the loci
that the genes are derived from, in order to account for the possibility
of spurious connections (see Supplementary Material).

Critical to displaying connections between loci clearly is the
particular arrangement of the loci and genes around the circle. Often
lines connect speciﬁc subsets of loci together. If those subsets are
not carefully arranged around the circle, then many intersecting
connections obscure biologic intuition. Therefore, as a key part
of our software we have implemented an optimization procedure
that minimizes the total burden of intersecting connections in

the ﬁgure (see Supplementary Material). Brieﬂy, we deﬁne an
objective function that calculates the total burden of intersections,
weighing intersections between thicker connections more heavily.
Then we iteratively chose random loci with at least one gene
with an intersecting connection, and then we try manipulating the
arrangement by either (i) moving the locus to each of the different
positions in the circle, (ii) swapping the locus with every other locus
in the circle or (iii) inverting different segments of the circle starting
from that locus and ending at other positions. At each iteration,
we chose the manipulation that most reduces the total number of
intersecting connections and update the arrangement iteratively.
Once the loci have been arranged, then genes within each of the
loci are permuted to reduce the number of total intersections.

3 EXAMPLES

We present examples of VIZ—GRAIL runs in Figure 1. The ﬁles used
to create this ﬁgures are provided in the Supplementary Material.
Figure 1A and B presents an illustrative example. In this case, there
is a single optimal solution without any intersecting connections. In
Figure 1A, the regions and genes are plotted without arranging to
minimize intersections—the display looks jumbled and it is difﬁcult
to see any clear patterns. VIZ—GRAIL is able to ﬁnd the optimal
arrangement in 184 iterations run on a personal laptop in <1 h (Fig.
1B); the connections between genes and loci are much more clear.
As a realistic example, we plot the literature—based similarity across
34 known rheumatoid arthritis (RA) risk loci, implicating a total of
132 genes (Raychaudhuri, 2010). After using VIZ—GRAIL to arrange
genes and loci to minimize intersections, related genes are clearly
seen, for example the genes involved in the 1L2 pathway (1L2, IL2RA
and IL2RB), as well as the CD28—CTLA4 pathway.

ABSTRACT

Summary: uMeltSM is a flexible web-based tool for predicting
DNA melting curves and denaturation profiles of PCR products.
The user defines an amplicon sequence and chooses a set of
thermodynamic and experimental parameters that include nearest
neighbor stacking energies, loop entropy effects, cation (monovalent
and Mg++) concentrations and a temperature range. Using an
accelerated partition function algorithm along with chosen parameter
values, uMelt interactively calculates and visualizes the mean helicity
and the dissociation probability at each sequence position at
temperatures within the temperature range. Predicted curves display
the mean helicity as a function of temperature or as derivative
plots. Predicted profiles display stability as a function of sequence
position either as 50% helicity temperatures or as the helicity
probability at specific temperatures. The loss of helicity associated
with increasing temperature may be viewed dynamically to visualize
domain formation within the molecule. Results from fluorescent
high-resolution melting experiments match the number of predicted
melting domains and their relative temperatures. However, the
absolute melting temperatures vary with the selected thermodynamic
parameters and current libraries do not account for the rapid
melting rates and helix stabilizing dyes used in fluorescent melting
experiments. uMelt provides a convenient platform for simulation and
design of high-resolution melting assays.

1 INTRODUCTION

DNA melting analysis with ﬂuorescent dyes is a new method to
conveniently scan for genetic variation without sequencing (Erali
and Wittwer, 2010; Montgomery et al., 2010). The ability to predict
the shape and position of melting curves is essential for assay design
and optimization. uMelt builds on existing models of DNA melting
using nearest neighbor thermodynamics and recursive calculations
using statistical mechanics (Blake et al., 1999; Crothers, 1968;

Gotoh, 1983; Markham and Zuker, 2005; Poland, 1974; Steger,
1994; Tostesen, 2003; Zimm, 1960) to predict ﬂuorescent melting
analysis of PCR products in a rich web application.

2 METHODS

Temperature-dependent stability factors for each base tetrad are used to
calculate probabilities of helicity for each position at each temperature.
Averaging over the entire sequence gives the predicted helicity at each
temperature. Stability factors of the 10 possible nearest neighbor tetrads
are calculated using Equation (1).

e—(AH—TAS)

Stb'l't f t =— 1
any acor RT ()

Enthalpy (AH) and entropy (AS) parameters are taken from one of several
thermodynamic libraries, T is the absolute temperature and R is Boltzmann’s
constant. The entropy parameters are modiﬁed for monovalent cation (Blake
and Delcourt, 1998) and Mg++ (Nakano et al., 1999; von Ahsen et al., 2001)
concentrations.

Tetrad stability factors are used in the two-phase recursive calculation
of vectors whose entries contain partition functions that relate relative
probabilities of helicity versus random coiling along segments of the
molecule of increasing lengths. The algorithm, described in Tostesen et al.
(2003), accelerates both the exact 0(N3) and approximate 0(N2) method
described previously (Yeramian et al., 1990) by one order (0) in the oligo
length, N. In uMelt, the resulting exact 0(N2) algorithm is implemented.
Loop entropy requires modiﬁcation of associated relative probabilities by a
factor with power law dependence in loop length (Blossey and Carlon, 2003;
SantaLucia, 1998; Sugimoto et al., 1995). As in Poland (1974), by using these
formulas, the probability that the base pair is helical at any temperature can
be calculated without explicit reference to the 2N microstate weights for the
molecule, a computationally intractable task. Finally, the overall helicity at a
given temperature is calculated as the average helicity probability of all base
pairs. This total helicity across the temperature range predicts the melting
curve.

Sequences are deﬁned in a text box that allows quick editing and
modiﬁcation to compare different sequences (supplementary Fig. 1a). The
user also selects a published thermodynamic library of nearest neighbor
parameters (Blake and Delcourt, 1998; Breslauer et al., 1986; Huguet
et al., 2010; SantaLucia, 1998; Sugimoto et al., 1995) monovalent salt
and magnesium concentrations, loop parameters, the temperature range and
the temperature resolution. Computed values are Visualized in four charts
with the ability to hover on points to see individual values. Data can be
downloaded as a text ﬁle containing all data for the melting curve, derivative
curve and melting proﬁles.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

uMelt provides a rapid web application to predict melting curves
of PCR products. Fluorescent DNA melting curves after real-time
PCR were introduced in 1997 (Ririe et al., 1997) as an alternative
to gel electrophoresis to assess product purity. Although a one-to-
one correspondence between the number of peaks and the number of
products is often assumed, this is clearly not true for many sequences
where local guanosine-cytosire (GC) content differences produce
multiple melting domains.

Melting curves are displayed as predicted helicity versus
temperature (Supplementary Fig. 1A, top left). Derivative plots are
calculated by taking the negative derivative of helicity with respect
to temperature (Supplementary Fig. 1B, top left). Helicity across
physical sequence position (the ‘melting proﬁle’) is plotted as the
temperature where 50% helicity is attained (Supplementary Figure
1B, bottom right). Alternatively, the probability of helicity at a
given temperature (‘dynamic proﬁle’) can be displayed across the
sequence position at various temperatures (Supplementary Fig. 1A,
bottom right).

Prediction of polymer domain melting is more computationally
intensive than simple two-state oligomer melting. Prior methods
have focused on correlation to absorbance measurements (Blake
et al., 1999; Markham and Zuker, 2005; Steger, 1994; Tostesen
et al., 2005) instead of the more convenient and clinical useful
ﬂuorescence measurements (Erali and Wittwer, 2010; Montgomery
et al., 2010). uMelt also provides adjustment for Mg++ ions and
displays dynamic melting proﬁles to Visualize melting according
to sequence position, options not provided by other resources
(Supplementary Table 1). Dissociation probabilities at each position
are calculated and displayed Visually to simulate physical melting of
the helix. Loop formation and fraying sequence ends can be observed
throughout the temperature range. Calculation time depends on
sequence length (Supplementary Fig. 2).

In Supplementary Figure 3, an experimental melting curve is
compared with predicted curves using different thermodynamic sets.
The three domains of the melting curve and the spacing between
domains are accurately reﬂected in the predictions. However,
the predicted curves are located variably above and below the
experimental melting curve depending on the thermodynamic
parameters used. The best match is obtained with the uniﬁed
parameter set (SantaLucia, 1998). The ﬂuorescence measurements
typical of high—resolution melting introduce some new variables,
including helix stabilization from the ﬂuorescent dye and high-
melting rates, both of which may increase apparent melting
temperatures. Furthermore, the assumed linearity between helicity
and ﬂuorescence is unproven. As previously noted (Hill et al.,
2010), lower melting domains appear attenuated compared with
predictions, possibly the result of a lower ﬂuorescent yield with
AT base pairs. If ﬂuorescence varies linearly with GC content,
intensity corrections could be easily incorporated. Even with current
limitations, uMelt provides a convenient tool for design and
optimization of high—resolution melting experiments by predicting
PCR product melting curves.

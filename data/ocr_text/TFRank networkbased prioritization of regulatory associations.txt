ABSTRACT

Motivation: Uncovering mechanisms underlying gene expression
control is crucial to understand complex cellular responses. Studies
in gene regulation often aim to identify regulatory players involved
in a biological process of interest, either transcription factors
coregulating a set of target genes or genes eventually controlled
by a set of regulators. These are frequently prioritized with respect
to a context-specific relevance score. Current approaches rely on
relevance measures accounting exclusively for direct transcription
factor—target interactions, namely overrepresentation of binding sites
or target ratios. Gene regulation has, however, intricate behavior
with overlapping, indirect effect that should not be neglected. In
addition, the rapid accumulation of regulatory data already enables
the prediction of large-scale networks suitable for higher level
exploration by methods based on graph theory. A paradigm shift
is thus emerging, where isolated and constrained analyses will likely
be replaced by whole-network, systemic-aware strategies.

Results: We present TFRank, a graph-based framework to prioritize
regulatory players involved in transcriptional responses within the
regulatory network of an organism, whereby every regulatory path
containing genes of interest is explored and incorporated into the
analysis. TFRank selected important regulators of yeast adaptation
to stress induced by quinine and acetic acid, which were missed by
a direct effect approach. Notably, they reportedly confer resistance
toward the chemicals. In a preliminary study in human, TFRank
unveiled regulators involved in breast tumor growth and metastasis
when applied to genes whose expression signatures correlated with
short interval to metastasis.

1 INTRODUCTION

Transcription is the ﬁrst step in the ﬂow of biological information
from genome to proteome and its tight regulation serves as a crucial

checkpoint in most biological processes. Transcriptional control
often results from the concerted action of diverse transcription
factors (TFs), acting alone or as interacting partners, regulating or
being targeted, and participating in complex feedback loops (Lemon
and Tijian, 2000; Teixeira et al., 2010). Genome-wide studies have
been unveiling intricate regulatory networks with increasing layers
of complexity as the hierarchy is ampliﬁed, empowered by the
rapid accumulation of regulatory data in public repositories. Namely,
YEASTRACT (Abdulrehman et al., 2011) contains TF—target links
for Saccharomyces cerevisiae, while JASPAR (Sandelin et al.,
2004) and TRAN SFAC (Wingender, 1996) collect binding sites and
position-speciﬁc scoring matrices for diverse eukaryotes including
human. These data provide information on the topology of the
regulatory network, which is static and thus not sufﬁcient per se to
determine whether a given association is relevant or not in a speciﬁc
biological context. In fact, binding of a given TF to the promoter
region of its target(s) is rather an intermittent event triggered by
biochemical stimuli and ultimately leading to changes in expression.
Insight on the mechanisms underlying the stimulus—response effect
can only be achieved through an integrated study of control and
behavior, where three challenges often arise: (i) identiﬁcation of
regulators of genes involved in a similar, related biological process;
(ii) identiﬁcation of genes coregulated by a group of TFs of interest;
and (iii) prioritization of regulators, target genes or regulatory
interactions with respect to a measure of relevance expressing their
contribution within the regulatory network under study.

Diverse strategies have been proposed to address the ﬁrst
challenge. A popular one is to rank TFs based on the ratio of
genes targeted in the dataset under analysis. This score can be
normalized by the relative number of targets in the genome to avoid
excessive bias toward TFs controlling very large regulons (Teixeira
et al., 2006). Alternatively, methods may rely on a statistical
framework to discover enriched target binding sites by calculating
their overrepresentation in the test sequences against a background
model estimated from a collection of (randomly) selected sequences
(Hestand et al., 2008; Marstrand et al., 2008; Veerla et al., 2010),
eventually considering cross-species conservation (Hestand et al.,
2008; Veerla et al., 2010). A drawback of such procedure is that
results are highly susceptible to the choice of the background
model and variations on the statistical parameters. Other strategies
have overcome this limitation by computing the genome-wide
overrepresentation of binding sites (Chang et al. , 2006; H0 Sui et al. ,

2005; Roider et al., 2009), improved through comparative analysis
with orthologous sequences based on phylogenetic footprinting.
Regulatory associations have also been uncovered from expression
data alone (Pournara and Wernisch, 2007; Reverter et al., 2010) by
searching for correlation of expression proﬁles under the assumption
that TFs tend to express coherently with their targets. However,
this is often not the case. In addition, these techniques tend to
ignore physical binding and thus generate a larger number of false
positives (Balleza et al., 2009; Margolin and Califano, 2007). The
issue was recently mitigated by incorporating binding, expression
data and three types of control: regulation, activation and inhibition
(Essaghir et al., 2010). Most methods for the second challenge are
experimental, relying on ChIP—chip and DNA microarray assays
to ﬁnd putative targets. Computationally, the problem has been
addressed by computing the genome-wide enrichment of binding
sites (Chang et al., 2006), or the correlation between the expression
of each gene with the composite expression of sets of genes
pertaining identical binding sites (Kim and Kim, 2006).

All revised approaches include some form of prioritization
based on a relevance score and most are able to test large-
scale data. Nonetheless, they restrict to direct neighbors in the
network, disregarding overlapping control and systemic effects
of utter importance in gene regulation, where cascade responses
proliferate. This systemic perspective was supported in recent work
by Booth et al. (2010), suggesting that evolution might lead to the
introduction of new layers of control between TFs and their targets.
Embedding this knowledge into the relevance score would likely
increase informativeness and accuracy in determining key regulatory
players, particularly when coupled with the ability to direct the
search toward wider-purposed or more speciﬁc regulators (Martinez—
Antonio, 2003; Vallet—Gely et al., 2007). Another characteristic of
the methods reviewed herein is that they are mostly sequence driven
and thus not tailored for the study of higher level hypothesis on gene
regulation. Notably, their ability to predict TF—target afﬁnities can
be exploited in a ﬁrst step to derive regulations and build large-scale
regulatory networks for methods based on graph theory, known to
deliver effective and efﬁcient network analysis. Notably, network
motif mining has been successfully applied to the identiﬁcation of
regulatory modules (Bar-Joseph et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2008).
This technique aims to partition the network in coherent groups and
is thus more appropriate for ﬁnding subgroups of activity rather than
studying the composite effect generating a particular response.

In this article, we present TFRank, a method to prioritize
regulatory players, involved in a process of interest, considering
all known regulatory paths of a given organism. The most common
use case is to rank the TFs controlling a set of genes responsive
under speciﬁc conditions, according to a score calculated as follows.
Each gene in the network is given an initial weight indicative of its
presence (or absence) in (from) the gene set. Expression values or
any alternative measure of importance may be used. A personalized
ranking strategy is then applied to propagate the weights through
the network graph in the target—> TF direction. For the prioritization
of targets of a set of regulators, the diffusion is performed in
the TF—>target direction instead. TFRank is independent from
network construction and may be applied to any organism with
available TF—target interactions. TFRank provides: (i) full topology
analysis including alternative regulatory paths with intermediate
layers of control; (ii) ability to regulate preference for more global or
local players; (iii) integrated stimulus—response analysis of (static)

binding and (dynamic) response; (iV) potential incorporation of
interaction conﬁdence scores; and (V) normalization to mitigate bias
toward TFs with a large number of targets or genes acted upon
by a large number of regulators. We evaluate the contribution of
each TFRank parameter to the ranking on real data. We test the
effectiveness of TFRank to unravel regulators potentially involved
in the transcriptional control of biological processes in yeast and
human. For yeast, we examine the TFs output by TFRank for two sets
of genes upregulated in response to stress induced by the antimalarial
drug quinine and the food preservative acetic acid. For human, we
present a preliminary study of the TFRank-suggested regulators of
genes whose expression signature has been previously associated
with short interval to metastasis in breast cancer.

2 METHODS

This section introduces TFRank, a framework to: (i) prioritize TFs of a set
of genes responsive under particular conditions; and (ii) rank the genes
controlled by a group of regulators involved in a biological process of
interest (Fig. 1). Application of the method to one setting or the other is
straightforward and depends exclusively on the representation devised for the
regulatory network, whether using reverse directed regulatory interactions
from target genes to regulators (ﬁrst problem) or the original regulations
from TFs to their targets (second problem). Our description focuses mainly
on the solution for the ﬁrst problem, more frequently addressed. Answering
the reverse question should also become clear from the following exposition.
We ﬁrst outline the deﬁnitions and formulate the problem. Next, we introduce
TFRank’s personalized ranking strategy based on the heat kernel. Finally, we
describe the contribution of each parameter.

2.1 TFRank prioritization framework

A regulatory network is deﬁned as a directed graph G=(V,E), where V
denotes the set of vertices, comprising regulators and target genes, and E is
the set of edges representing regulatory associations between elements in V.
Let A and D denote the adjacency and diagonal matrices of G, respectively,
where Am, 2 w(u, v) expresses the weight of the edge between a source vertex
u and an end vertex v and Du“ =d(u) is the outdegree of vertex u (or the
sum of weights of the outgoing edges). Note that, for the ﬁrst problem,
the direction of each regulatory interaction is reversed, meaning that edge
sources correspond to target genes and end vertices represent regulators.
This is equivalent to using the transpose of the original regulatory network
graph. Given a set T g V of target genes, the ﬁrst problem aims at deﬁning
a relevance score and thus obtaining a ranking on R g V, where R is the set
of TFs regulating directly or indirectly the target genes in T.

Personalized PageRank (Erin and Page, 1998) is a widely known solution
for the above formulation, related to local clustering on graphs (Andersen
and Lang, 2006; Chung, 2007). Personalized PageRank involves a preference
vector p0, which can be regarded as the probabilistic distribution of the genes
in T, and a jumping constant or denoting the probability of returning back
to initial nodes. For an input p0, the ranking p0, is given by the following
equation and equivalent recurrence, respectively,

pa=aZ<1—a)kpo<D—1A)k <1)
k=0
pa=apo+<1—a)paD—1A. (2)

This is also equivalent to the lazy deﬁnition of PageRank, using matrix
M: % (I+D_1A) instead of D‘lA, up to a change in or.

TFRank uses the heat kernel rank, which was shown recently to perform
better (Chung, 2007) than PageRank. The heat kernel is a fundamental
solution for the heat equation describing the diffusion of heat and related
temperature variation through a bounded region over time. In physics, the

Fig. 1. Diagram of the TFRank framework for prioritizing TF—target interactions. TFRank uses the whole regulatory network and a preference vector accepting
two kinds of input: a list of genes, containing for example genes whose expression was signiﬁcantly altered in a given condition; or a list of genes together
with their expression levels or any measure of importance. Based on the input, each gene is initialized with a given score as follows: in the ﬁrst case, the score
can be either 1 or 0 depending on whether the gene is in the input list or not; in the second case, the score is set as the absolute value of the given measure.
These scores, expressed in the form of a preference vector, are then propagated through the network to compute a TFRank relevance score for every regulatory
player, involving two additional properties: regulation weights and diffusion coefﬁcient. Regulation weights can be used to express a degree of conﬁdence
or intensity on each regulatory interaction, taking into consideration the nature of the underlying experiments. The diffusion coefﬁcient allows to control the
extent of intermediate regulatory layers considered. Finally, genes are ranked based on the computed TFRank scores. Normalization can be applied to balance
the ﬁnal scores and avoid bias toward regulators targeting many genes or genes acted upon by many TFs. In this ﬁgure, nodes are generally represented in
light green (standard node or target) or red (regulator). Dark green is used to denote a gene present in the input list. The bottom ﬁgure highlights a ranking
obtained with TFRank using YEASTRACT regulations (Abdulrehman et al., 2011). The intensity of the red nodes indicates the relevance of the corresponding
TF upon prioritization: the darker the color, the more relevant the regulator. Prefuse (Heer et al., 2005) was used to generate the bottom network from custom
code.

where t is the thermal conductivity or heat diffusion coefﬁcient and W:

(the heat kernel), deﬁned in Equation (4), where p0 is again a preference
vector.

Analogously, in graph theory, W denotes the transition probability matrix of
a typical random walk on G deﬁned as W=D_1A. In this case, W holds

sum of weights of the outgoing edges of it. Other matrices can be used, such
as the Laplacian D —A or its normalized form I —D_ %AD_% . Let us deﬁne
L :1 — W. The heat kernel rank in Equation (4) is then rewritten as

The discrete version of the heat kernel, ﬁrst introduced in Chung and Yau
(1999), is a symmetric version of eT‘L. Several approximations have been
proposed for the heat kernel rank, namely an additive version by taking a
ﬁnite sum [of Equation (4)], or a sum of two inﬁnite products as given by
Euler (Chung and Yau, 1999). We rely on the discrete approximation of Yang
et al. (2007) to compute the vector of ranking scores pt as in Equation (6)

1,21,, (1+ Wit) , (6)

where N is the number of iterations, and t, p0 and L are as previously deﬁned.
For an error threshold 8, N can be determined such that Equation (7) holds,

po(e—tL_(I+gL)N)

for any p0 whose entries sum one. Solving Equation (7) is difﬁcult, thus Yang
et al. (2007) use a heuristic motivated by the following. When L :1 — W,

for small values of N, being sufﬁcient to consider N :10.

2.2 Customizing TFRank: parameter contribution

TFRank is a ﬂexible integrative prioritization framework allowing for some
degree of customization. In particular, parameters may be tuned by experts
to guide the method’s search according to the problem under study (Fig. 1).
We describe the effect of each parameter to the output below.

2.2.] Diﬁfusion coeﬁ‘icient The heat diffusion coefﬁcient parameter, t,
plays an important role in the heat kernel as it controls the diffusion rate.
A large value causes heat to diffuse rapidly, giving preference to regulators
located farther away in the network. Conversely, a small value promotes a
slow diffusion, thus favoring nearby TFs.

2.2.2 Preference vector Biological context is introduced by the preference
vector, p0, which deﬁnes the initial scores for vertices. Distinct initialization
schemes can be used, aiming at differentiating the set of target genes of
interest from the remaining genes in the network by attributing them a larger
score and therefore greater importance. In general,

poT (u) if u E T,

pom) : { 0 otherwise. (10)

Common practice is to assume that p0 follows a uniform distribution over
the set of target genes T, with p0T(u)=1/|T|, or an equal scoring setting
with p0T(u)=1. Alternatively, genes in T may yield distinct initial scores
based on experimental measurements such as expression levels, or based
on a correlation with a particular outcome. Input scores may also follow a
degree-based distribution with poT (u) =d(u)/ ZzeTth).

2.2.3 Regulation weights Regulation weights, or edge weights in the
network graph, can be used to deﬁne the extent of contribution of each
TF—target interaction to the diffusion. Typically, there is little information
available in this regard, but we believe that incorporating measures of
conﬁdence or intensity on these associations is likely to improve the
ranking accuracy. The weight w(u,v) of every edge (u,v) can be set as
the binding afﬁnity between the TF and the binding site in the promoter
region of the target gene, derived by ChIP-chip assays or computational TF—
target prediction methods. Note that when using normalized weights, the
entries of matrix W in Section 2.1 acquire the form w(u, v)/ ZOMEE w(u, z).
Speciﬁcally for yeast using YEASTRACT, w(u, v) can be deﬁned as

w(u9 v):w+ 2 WT X8T(u9v)3 
te{D,I,U}

where predeﬁned constants M), w; and wU denote the weights attributed to
regulations pertaining direct (D), indirect (I) and undeﬁned (U) evidence,
respectively. Binary function 6T(u,v) evaluates to 1 when edge (u,v) yields
evidence of type ‘L’, or to 0 otherwise, where 16 {D,I, U}. When all edges
are equally relevant, w, = 0 and Equation (11) is then w(u, v) = w.

2.2.4 Score normalization In order to attenuate the bias toward genes with
a large number of regulatory associations, the ﬁnal ranking can be reﬁned
by degree normalizing the scores: rt(u) =pt(u)/n(u). The normalization
factor, n(u), can be chosen to be the outdegree, indegree or the sum of
both out and in degrees of vertex a. When applied to the original network
graph, these will mitigate the effect of TFs regulating many genes, genes
regulated by many TFs or both, respectively. Weight may be used instead of
degree and logarithmic normalizations can also be considered. We note that
normalization penalizes only TF ﬁrst-level regulations.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In this section, we evaluate the ability of TFRank to provide
informative rankings of TFs underlying response to stress in yeast
or controlling gene markers of complex diseases in human. We also
assess the contribution of each parameter to the output.

3.1 Case studies in yeast

We retrieved yeast regulatory data from YEASTRACT
(Abdulrehman et al., 2011), yielding 184 regulators and over
48 000 documented TF—target interactions. TFs were mapped
to their encoding genes and all TF—encoding and target genes
identiﬁers were mapped to the same Saccharomyces genome
database (SGD) nomenclature set. The regulatory graph was
built by adding an edge per TF—target association from the node
representing the TF—encoding gene to the node representing the
target gene. Edges were then reversed and their weights calculated

using Equation (11). We processed datasets containing genes
upregulated in response to two chemical stresses: the ﬁrst imposed
by the antimalarial drug quinine (dos Santos et al., 2009); and
the second induced upon exposure to the food preservative acetic
acid (Mira et al., 2010b). Both were submitted to TFRank analysis
using identical input parameters. The diffusion coefﬁcient t was set
to 0.25 to promote a moderate number of layers of transcriptional
control. A larger value (closer to 1) would cause TFRank to rapidly
reach the TFs at the top of the regulatory network, those exhibiting
a considerable amount of known target genes, eventually masking
proximal regulators more speciﬁcally related to the biological
process under study and thus likely to be more relevant to the
regulation of the responsive genes. No score normalization was
applied, as the selected diffusion coefﬁcient was already expected
to attenuate the bias toward TFs with a large number of targets. We
decided not to differentiate edge weights and score all regulatory
associations equally, irrespective of the underlying experimental
evidence. Although the opposite could theoretically generate more
reliable results, diminishing the importance of less well-studied
interactions could reduce the network to associations supported by
TF—promoter binding experiments. More importantly, this would
certainly bias the analysis toward prior knowledge by setting
aside the least studied TFs and targets. The transcript levels of the
TFs or the target genes were not considered relevant in neither
of the case studies. This is reasonable, as the activity of a TF
is not exclusively based on its transcript levels, and it may also
depend on the occurrence of post-translational modiﬁcations or on
the alteration of its subcellular localization. In fact, experimental
evidences gathered so far show that there is a weak correlation
between the ratio of induction level of a particular gene in response
to a given stress and its contribution for maximal yeast tolerance to
such stress. This was reportedly the case for acetic acid, where the
genes exerting the strongest protection against the chemical were
those less transcriptionally activated (~2-fold) (Mira et al., 2010b).
Results are summarized in Tables 1 and 3 and Figures 2 and 3,
while complete rankings are provided in Supplementary Tables S1
and S2. We analyze them throughout the text.

mediators of yeast transcriptional response to quinine (Table 1).
This list signiﬁcantly differs from the top six ranking sorted by the
percentage of documented regulatory associations targeting the set
of quinine-induced genes (Table 2). It is noteworthy that some TFs
highlighted by TFRank exert documented control over a relatively
low number of responsive genes. For example, Mal33, ranked
in third, is described as a documented regulator of 2.5% of the
activated genes (Table 1). However, these TFs regulate other TFs
with large percentages of documented targets among the quinine-
induced genes, suggesting that indirect control may also present
an important contribution (Fig. 2). The group of top six TFs
obtained with TFRank sets aside the top six TFs ranked by the
percentage of documented targets, each of them being predicted
to control the expression of >35% of genes in the dataset (Tables 1
and 2). In particular, Msn2, Sok2, an4 and Yapl are known to be
involved in the regulation of yeast response to several environmental
stresses and consequently exert control over a large number of genes.
In this context, their classiﬁcation at the top of the ranking by
percentage based on the YEASTRACT network likely reﬂects a
generic, rather than more speciﬁc, regulatory role played by these
TFs in the yeast transcriptional response to quinine stress. Notably,
the single elimination of MSNZ, SOKZ, RPN4 or YAPI genes from
the yeast cell was found not to increase the susceptibility of yeast

TFs are involved in yeast adaptation to carbon sources alternative
to glucose. Adrl and Cat8 participate in the regulation of genes
required for the metabolism of non-fermentable carbon sources
(Haurie et al., 2001; Young et al., 2003), whereas Gisl controls the
reprogramming of carbon metabolism during transition to stationary
phase (Zhang et al., 2009) and genes involved in the adaptation to
nutrient limitation (Pedruzzi et al., 2000). In turn, Hap4, Mal33 and
Gal4 control the transcript levels of genes required for respiration
(Schiiller, 2003), and maltose (Feuermann et al. , 1995) and galactose
(Bhat and Murthy, 2001) catabolism, respectively. Quinine has
been shown to competitively inhibit glucose uptake in yeast cells
presumably leading to a state of intracellular glucose limitation,
even if glucose is present in the growth medium at saturating
concentrations (dos Santos et al., 2009).

3.1.2 Yeast response to acetic acid-induced stress TFRank and
the method ranking by target percentage of induced genes agreed
in the ﬁrst two TFs for the acetic acid set, Haa1 and Sfpl (Tables 3
and 2, respectively). Haalp has been identiﬁed as the main regulator
of the yeast transcriptional response to this stress (Mira et al.,
2010b). The participation of Sfp1 was examined but no detectable
effect on cell protection against acetic acid could be attributed
to SFPI expression (Mira et al., 2010a). TFRank further ranked
Msn4, Nrgl and Fkh2 on top (Table 3). These four TFs target a
low percentage of acetic acid-induced genes and therefore appear
lower in the list ranked by such criterium (Table 2). Less importance
was given by TFRank to Ste12, Msn2, Yapl and Aft1 regulators,
each of them predicted to control the expression of >45% of the
acetic acid-responsive genes (Supplementary Table S2 and Table 2,
respectively). Microarray experiments revealed upregulation of
MSN4, FKHZ and NRGI in response to acetic acid stress (Mira et al.,
2010b). This is surprising, as the expression was not embedded and
thus did not contribute to the TFRank analysis. It suggests that,
in some cases, the list of genes could, by itself, hold sufﬁcient
information to uncover key TFs. MSN4, FKHZ and NRGI genes
were also found to confer protection against acetic acid, although at
distinct levels (Mira et al. , 2010b). Their upregulation in response to
acetic acid stress was shown to be dependent on Haalp (Mira et al.,
2010b) (Fig. 3). This tight regulatory scheme seems to be conﬁrmed
by the ranking and is an interesting example of the perspective
through which TFRank interprets a transcriptional response: as the
result of whole-network control rather than isolated action of TFs.
Indirect regulation becomes evident in this study, where the top-
ranked TFs exert control over other major regulators (Fig. 3). Sfp1
was also highlighted by TFRank and appears to be linked to the
remaining players as a target of Fkh2 (Fig. 3). Nevertheless, the
elimination of SFPI was not found to increase yeast susceptibility
to acetic acid stress (Mira et al., 2010a).

3.2 Evaluation of parameter contribution

We assessed the contribution of each TFRank parameter as follows.

distal and proximal TFs, respectively, and two distinct edge weight
and seed score schemes. We determined the positions of the 46
TFs with outdegree above the 75th percentile and observed that
these (farthest) TFs tended to rank higher when a larger coefﬁcient
was used, as expected. We also observed that TFs with reduced
outdegree (proximal) ranked higher with the lower t, while TFs
controlling large regulons (distal) were favored by the larger t
value. For the edge weights, we relied on two different schemes
expected to beneﬁt indirect and direct evidence, and two distinct
diffusion coefﬁcients and two seed score settings. We assessed the
ranks of the 16 TFs for which >90% of its TF—target interactions
yielded indirect evidence. These explicitly ranked higher with the
scheme favoring indirect evidence, conﬁrming our hypothesis. For
the preference vector, we compared the rankings obtained using
expression values versus equal initial scores, with high and low t and
two distinct edge weight schemes. We veriﬁed the ranks achieved
by the 7 and 8 TFs whose encoding genes were upregulated in the
quinine and acetic acid sets, respectively. In the quinine set, the
group reportedly ranked higher with t: 0.75 when using expression
relative to equal scores, but it ranked equivalently with t = 0.25 using
both preference vector settings. The group contained TFs which
were also the most proximal and were thus favored by the lower t
independently of the initial scoring. In the acetic acid set, most of the
eight TFs yielded lower upregulation levels than the remaining genes
and therefore could not compete with TFs targeting many genes in
the set. We performed an additional test in which we artiﬁcially
boosted the initial scores of the TFs. These undoubtedly ranked
on top, supporting the effect described in Section 2. Finally, for
normalization we analyzed the rankings obtained using the regular
against normalized score, with two distinct edge weight and two
seed score settings. We observed the ranks of the 26 and 13 TFs
yielding no targets in the quinine and acetic acid sets, respectively.
They achieved higher ranks when sorted based on the normalized
score, showing that TFs controlling more genes were effectively
penalized.

3.3 Preliminary study in human

For human, we collected J ASPAR position-speciﬁc scoring matrices
(PSSMs) and UCSC Human Genome (hg19) sequences made
available by Zambelli et al. (2009). Each matrix identiﬁer (UniProt)
was mapped to its encoding gene (NCBI Entrez) using the ofﬁcial
UniProt ID conversion service completed with manual search on
databases. RefSeq sequence accession numbers (NCBI GRCh37,
February 2009) were converted to Entrez using a ﬁle from the NCBI
repository. Matrices and sequences with unmapped identiﬁers were
ﬁltered. Sequences were further processed to select the stretches
200 bp upstream and 0bp downstream the transcription start site.
We used the PoSSuM software (Beckstette et al., 2006) to match the
PSSMs against the sequences and ﬁltered results below a P-value
cutoff of 1x 10‘4. Edge weights wuv, for edge (u,v)eE (Section
2), were computed from the raw matching scores output by PoS SuM
by rescaling the original score interval of each PSSM to [0,1].
To avoid multiple matches, we selected only the match of highest
score for every PSSM—sequence pair. This procedure yielded a
network containing 50 386 unique TF—target interactions between
18 088 genes, from which 65 acted as TFs. Finally, we selected
two gene sets concerning the study of time to distant metastasis in
primary breast cancer (van’t Veer et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2005).

DT: documented targets (% of targets in gene set); PT: potential targets (% of indirect
targets of TFs which are targets); DTN: 0c. targets in network. We indicate the number
of VV and WA genes in the TFRank and PASTAA TF-target sets. For each TF, we
include the rank attributed by the competing method (PR-PASTAA; TR-TFRank). The
upper part shows the top six ranked TFs for the 44 VV genes (40 in T FRank, 44 in
PASTAA). The lower part shows the top six ranked TFs for the 64 WA genes (53 in
TFRank, 61 in PASTAA).

These contained 70 and 76 genes, respectively, whose expression
signature was considered predictive of short interval to distant
metastasis in lymph node-negative patients. Gene identiﬁers were
ﬁrst mapped to ofﬁcial HGNC symbols (using a HGNC ﬁle or
the GeneAnnot service at GeneCards for Affymetrix chip U133A
probe set identiﬁers, respectively) and then converted to Entrez.
Duplicates were removed, resulting in 44 and 64 unique genes,
respectively. TFRank was applied to the human network with t:
0.25, N = 100 and no normalization, similarly to the studies in yeast.
We took as initial preference vector values: the absolute correlation
between the expression signature of each gene and the prognostic
category in the case of the van’t Veer et al. (2002) set, or the
absolute standard Cox coefﬁcient in the case of the Wang et al.
(2005) set.

3.3.1 Regulation of <5 year-to-metastases biomarkers in human
Although the gene sets overlapped minimally (one gene), the top six
lists output by TFRank shared two TFs, SP1 and CREB1 (Table 4).
SP1 was ﬁrst in both studies. SP1 is known to activate multiple
genes involved in tumor cell growth and metastasis (Zhou et al.,
2011). EWSR1—FLIl, a fusion protein linked primarily to bone
tumor (Ewing’s sarcoma), was second for the van’t Veer et al.
(2002) set. Interestingly, a subset of the gene markers from this
set has been reported as an indicator of primary breast cancer to
osteolytic bone metastasis (Kang et al., 2003). MZF1, ranked in
third, is an important transcriptional regulator in hematopoietic
development. Unregulated MZF1 expression has been presented
as oncogenic and its overexpression seems to induce metastasis
through AXL gene expression (Mudduluru et al., 2010). FOXLl,
fourth, is a mesenchymal TF with a key role in gastric and colorectal
carcinogenesis (Perreault et al., 2005). Notably, it has been found
overexpressed in low-grade ﬁbromyxoid sarcoma (Moller et al.,
2011), a condition affecting bone, muscular and hematopoietic

tissue. CREB 1, ﬁfth, has been associated to cancer development and
poor prognosis. Recently, Son et al. (2010) have reported CREB1
to be overexpressed in advanced breast cancer cells and to inﬂuence
the expression of several genes involved in metastasis to bone.
IRF1, sixth in the list, mediates interferon as well as other cytokine
activity, and it has been appointed as a tumor growth inhibitor
(Kim et al., 2004). In the Wang et al. (2005) dataset, ELK1 ranked
second. This factor participates in the chemokine signaling pathway,
whose disruption has been implicated in tumor proliferation. ELK1
expression has been found to increase in breast cancer tissue relative
to normal cells and to correlate with poor prognosis (Potter et al.,
2011). NFATC2, third, is a nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)
that integrates the NFAT complex, an inducer of gene transcription
during the immune response. NFATC2 is believed to act as a tumor
suppressor, but NFAT factors have also been shown to promote
breast cancer cell invasive migration by activating COX—2 (Mancini
and Toker, 2009). The fourth TF was CREB 1, ranked in ﬁfth in the
van’t Veer et al. (2002) set. Upregulation of TFAP2A, ranked in
ﬁfth, has been associated with favorable prognosis in breast cancer
which conﬂicts with its role in the positive regulation of the ERBB2
oncogene. Notably, low expression of TFAP2A may cause the loss
of tumor suppressor KISS1 and thus increase the risk of metastasis
(Mitchell et al., 2006). FEV, sixth, is the second ETS oncogene in
the list for the Wang et al. (2005) set.

ELK1 and FEV share approximately half of each other targets,
including POLQ, whose upregulation presumably correlates with
poor prognosis in early breast cancer (Higgins et al., 2010).

3.3.2 TFRank versus PASTAA TFRank results were compared
with those obtained by PASTAA (Roider et al., 2009) for the
same input. PASTAA was selected due to its ability to also
consider weighted TF—target links and gene relevance scores. It
was previously compared with alternative methods, including PAP
(Chang et al., 2006) and an approach based on z-score statistics
similar to oPOSSUM (Ho Sui et al., 2005). In such study, PASTAA
and the z-score both yielded superior results, except for one dataset
in which only PASTAA seemed to outperform the competing
techniques (Roider et al., 2009). In our study, TFRank and PASTAA
agreed in placing CREB1 among the top six TFs for the van’t Veer
et al. (2002) set (Table 4). Aside from the TFAP2A and CREB1
factors, and E2F1 whose low expression strongly determines low
risk of breast cancer metastasis (Vuaroqueaux et al., 2007), the
relation of the remaining TFs in the PASTAA list with breast cancer
(and metastasis) was less evident in the literature, where NFKB1,
NHLH1 and TAL1—TCF3 were primarily involved in ovary and
colorectal (Andersen et al., 2010), brain (De Smaele et al., 2008)
and thyroid (Jacques et al. , 2009) cancer, respectively. For the Wang
et al. (2005) set, both methods ranked SP1 and ELK1 in the top 6
TFs. Other TFs promoted by PASTAA included: SRF and YY1,
involved in breast cancer cell migration (Lieberthal et al., 2009;
Medjkane et al. , 2009) ; ELK4 related to prostate cancer (Makkonen
et al. , 2008); and JUN -FOS, implicated in tumor differentiation and
progression (Hein et al., 2009). Overall, TFRank seemed to unravel
TFs more speciﬁcally related to breast cancer and its metastastatic
forms. Particularly considering the van’t Veer et al. (2002) data,
TFRank highlighted a number of TFs presumably involved in
breast cancer metastasis to bone, in accordance with the hypothesis
that the 70-gene signature predicted bone as an occurrence site

(Kang et al. , 2003). TFRank also recovered PASTAA key TFs better
than vice versa (Table 4).

4 CONCLUSION

We presented TFRank, a graph-based framework to identify relevant
regulators mediating speciﬁc transcriptional responses through
whole-network analysis of gene activity. TFRank successfully
highlighted regulators potentially involved in the yeast response to
quinine— and acetic acid-induced stresses. In a preliminary study
in human, TFRank revealed TFs presumably controlling genes
related to metastasis in breast cancer. We observed that by assuming
a systemic rather than isolated TF action perspective, TFRank
captured valuable information about the regulatory mechanisms
that would not have been unveiled otherwise. We showed that
this strategy provides adequate parameters to effectively control
the level of regulatory speciﬁcity for the problem under study,
ﬁne tune TF—target association scores and incorporate expression
levels or alternative measures of relevance into the input gene list.
TFRank relies on an additive model to compute the relevance score,
which requires additional care when mixing positive and negative
input values. A potential workaround is to analyze genes in two
distinct groups or to use absolute values. The presented case studies
supported TFRank as a promising tool to unveil important TFs,
despite the real set of regulations active in the process under study
remained undisclosed (all known TF—target interactions were used).
Such knowledge could be extracted from experimental ChIP—chip
data and used to derive a more accurate network. Envisioned future
work includes the integration of TFRank with an algorithm for
capturing coherent transcriptional trends across multiple conditions.

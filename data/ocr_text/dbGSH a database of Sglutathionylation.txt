ABSTRACT

Summary: S-glutathionylation, the reversible protein posttranslational
modification (PTM) that generates a mixed disulfide bond between
glutathione and cysteine residue, critically regulates protein activity,
stability and redox regulation. Due to its importance in regulating oxi-
dative/nitrosative stress and balance in cellular response, a number of
methods have been rapidly developed to study S-glutathionylation,
thus expanding the dataset of experimentally determined glutathiony-
lation sites. However, there is currently no database dedicated to the
integration of all experimentally verified S-glutathionylation sites along
with their characteristics or structural or functional information. Thus,
the dbGSH database has been created to integrate all available data-
sets and to provide the relevant structural analysis. As of January 31,
2014, dbGSH has manually collected >2200 experimentally verified
S-glutathionylated peptides from 169 research articles using a text-
mining approach. To solve the problem of heterogeneity of the data
collected from different sources, the sequence identity of the reported
S-glutathionylated peptides is mapped to UniProtKB protein entries.
To delineate the structural correlations and consensus motifs of these
S-glutathionylation sites, the dbGSH database also provides structural
and functional analyses, including the motifs of substrate sites, solvent
accessibility, protein secondary and tertiary structures, protein do-
mains and gene ontology.

Availability and implementation: dbGSH is now freely accessible at
http://csb.cse.yzu.edu.tw/dbGSH/. The database content is regularly
updated with new data collected by the continuous survey of research
articles.

1 INTRODUCTION

S—glutathionylation is a redox-dependent posttranslational
modiﬁcation (PTM) that involves the covalent attachment of
glutathione (GSH) to the thiol group of cysteine residues,
and regulates based on the physiological GSH level and the
GSH/GSSG ratio through spontaneous or enzymatic reaction
(Dalle-Donne et al., 2007, 2009;Gallogly and Mieyal,2007;
Ghezzi, 2013; Pastore and Piemonte, 2012). In addition to reg-
ulating redox signaling, S—glutathionylation also serves to modu-
late cancer migration, cell death and survival, energy metabolism
and glycolysis, as well as protein folding and degradation in

several species, ranging from bacteria to human (Pastore and
Piemonte, 2012). The various targets of S—glutathionylation
also participate in pathogenesis of many diseases, such as
neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic disorders and cancers
(Dalle-Donne et al., 2008; Mieyal and Chock, 2012). Due to
the importance of S—glutathionylation in clinical biological
processes, numerous methods have been developed, directed to-
ward mass spectrometry-based S—glutathionomics using various
biological systems to investigate and identify S—glutathionylated
targets and sites (Chiang et al., 2012; Lind et al., 2002; Newman
et al., 2007). As the number of experimentally identiﬁed
S—glutathionylated peptides grows, a structured database is de-
sirable for the further investigation of the biological functions of
S—glutathionylated proteins and the substrate speciﬁcities of
S—glutathionylation sites. Although a number of databases
have been developed for PTMs, such as dbPTM (Lee et al.,
2006; Lu et al., 2013; Su et al., 2014), PhosphoSitePlus
(Hornbeck et al., 2012), RegPhos (Lee et al., 201 la), dbOGAP
Wang et al., 2011) and dbSNO (Lee et al., 2012), limited re-
sources have been dedicated to S—glutathionylated proteins and
their corresponding substrate sites (Sun et al., 2012, 2013). Thus,
a new database (dbGSH) containing the experimentally veriﬁed
S—glutathionylated peptides from research articles is proposed to
facilitate the functional analysis of S—glutathionylated proteins
and to assist with the structural investigation of substrate sites.

2 METHODS

Supplementary Figure Sl shows the exhaustive system ﬂow of the con-
struction of dbGSH, containing the experimentally veriﬁed data for
S—glutathionylated proteins and S—glutathionylation sites. The database
entries are extracted manually from research articles through a literature
survey. All ﬁelds in the PubMed database are ﬁrst searched using the
keywords ‘glutathio(ny)lation’ or ‘glutathio(ny)lated’, followed by the
downloading of full-text versions of these research articles. A text-
mining system is developed to survey the full-text literature that poten-
tially describes the site-speciﬁc identiﬁcation of S—glutathionylation sites
for the various proteomic identiﬁcation experiments (Chiang et al., 2012;
Hamnell—Pamment et al., 2005). Approximately 1073 original and review
articles associated with protein S—glutathionylation are retrieved from
PubMed. Next, the full-length articles are manually reviewed to ensure
precise extraction of the S—glutathionylated peptides and the modiﬁed
cysteines. To determine the exact locations of S—glutathionylated cysteines
within a full-length protein sequence, the experimentally veriﬁed
S—glutathionylated peptides are then mapped to UniProtKB
(Consortium, 2013) protein entries based on the database identiﬁer
(ID) or sequence similarity. The S—glutathionylated peptides that do
not align exactly to a protein sequence are discarded. Finally, each
mapped S—glutathionylation site is attributed to the corresponding

dbGSH: a database of S-glutathionylation

 

literature (PubMed ID) reference. In addition, a small number of protein
S—glutathionylation sites in UniProtKB are integrated into dbGSH with
the corresponding literature references. As of January 31, 2014, a total of
169 S—glutathionylation-associated articles covering 16 organisms have
been retrieved from PubMed. In the dbGSH database, there are 2257
S—glutathionylated cysteines from 1314 S—glutathionylated proteins.
Supplementary Table S1 shows the statistics for the S—glutathionylation
data for each organism.

For a given protein, the biological function can be obtained from
the annotation in UniProtKB. To provide more effective informa-
tion about protein functional and structural annotations relevant to
S—glutathionylated cysteines, a variety of biological databases, such as
InterPro (Hunter et al., 2011), Gene Ontology (GO), Protein Data
Bank (PDB) (Rose et al., 2011) and KEGG Pathway (Kanehisa et al.,
2012), are integrated. The information regarding the molecular function,
cellular components and biological process for S—glutathionylated pro-
teins can be accessed by a cross-linking to the corresponding entry from
GO via a UniProtKB accession number. In addition, the InterPro
BioMart, which is a web service that provides the ability to build
custom queries on the InterPro database, is used to extract the
information about protein domains and functional sites for the
S—glutathionylated proteins in dbGSH. Additionally, the molecular inter-
action and signaling network of S—glutathionylated proteins can be
accessed by a cross-link that refers to the corresponding entries from
KEGG pathway.

To study the structural characteristics of S—glutathionylation sites
within the protein tertiary structure, all the experimentally identiﬁed
S—glutathionylation sites are mapped to the corresponding positions in
the protein entries in PDB. The solvent accessibility and secondary struc-
ture around the substrate sites are also investigated. However, due to the
limited information on protein structures in PDB, only 1% of the GSH
sites have corresponding tertiary structures. With reference to a previous
study investigating the structural characteristics of PTMs (Chang et al.,
2009; Huang et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2011b; Shien et al., 2009; Su and Lee,
2013; Wong et al., 2007) in proteins without known tertiary structures,
two effective tools, RVP-net (Ahmad et al., 2003) and PSIPRED
(McGufﬁn et al., 2000), are used to predict the solvent accessibility and
secondary structure, respectively.

3 UTILITY

To facilitate the use of the dbGSH resource, a web interface has
been developed for users to browse and efﬁciently search for
their S—glutathionylation proteins of interest. Supplementary
Figure S2 shows the content of a typical dbGSH query, including
basic information, graphical visualization of S—glutathionylation
sites, table of S—glutathionylation sites with the associated litera-
ture and visualization of tertiary structures by the J mol program.
According to the GO annotations, the distributions of the
biological processes, molecular functions and cellular compo-
nents of S—glutathionylated proteins are presented in
Supplementary Table S2. The investigation of protein domains
shows that the most abundant domain in S—glutathionylated pro-
teins is the RNA recognition motif (Supplementary Table S3),
and ~70% of the reported S—glutathionylation sites are located
within functional domains (Supplementary Table S4).
Additionally, Supplementary Table S5 presents the distribution
of KEGG pathways for S—glutathionylated proteins.

Figure lshows that the S—glutathionylation sites (upper panel)
have a higher preference for containing negatively charged
residues (D and E) than non-glutathionylation sites (lower
panel) do. To investigate the substrate speciﬁcity of the

S—glutathionylation sites, MDDLogo (Lee et al., 20110),
a maximal dependence decomposition (MDD) analysis that
clusters the aligned signal sequences into subgroups containing
statistically signiﬁcant motifs, was performed to identify the
substrate motifs for the S—glutathionylation data in humans,
with a sufﬁcient dataset. Supplementary Table S6 shows that
a total of nine substrate motifs were identiﬁed from 1735
S—glutathionylation sites with a 2l-mer window length: six
groups contain a conserved motif of negatively charged
amino acids (D and E) and three groups contain a conserved
motif of positively charged amino acids (K, R and H) surround-
ing the S—glutathionylation sites. The substrate sites of
S—glutathionylation might favor the cysteines ﬂanked by acidic
and basic amino acids, suggesting that the acid/basic environ-
ment in a close three-dimensional proximity may contribute to
the speciﬁcity of reactive cysteine toward S—glutathionylation.

4 CONCLUSIONS

The dbGSH database is the ﬁrst public resource to allow efﬁcient
access to experimentally validated S—glutathionylation sites and
comprehensive bioinformatics analyses, including functional
annotations, structural characteristics and substrate motifs for
S—glutathionylation sites. The database not only provides a
benchmark dataset for the development of computational pre-
diction tools and their comparison but also supplies the potential
glutathionylated targets for veriﬁcation and other biological
applications.

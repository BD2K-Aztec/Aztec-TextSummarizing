ABSTRACT

Motivation: High-throughput screens (HTS) by RNAi or small
molecules are among the most promising tools in functional
genomics. They enable researchers to observe detailed reactions to
experimental perturbations on a genome-wide scale. While there is
a core set of computational approaches used in many publications
to analyze these data, a specialized software combining them and
making them easily accessible has so far been missing.

Results: Here we describe HTSana/yzeR, a flexible software to
build integrated analysis pipelines for HTS data that contains over-
representation analysis, gene set enrichment analysis, comparative
gene set analysis and rich sub-network identification. HTSana/yzeR
interfaces with commonly used pre-processing packages for HTS
data and presents its results as HTML pages and network plots.
Availability: Our software is written in the R language and freely
available via the Bioconductor project at http://www.bioconductor
.org.

1 INTRODUCTION

In recent years several technological advances have pushed gene
perturbation screens to the forefront of functional genomics.
Combining high—throughput screening (HTS) techniques with rich
phenotypes enables researchers to observe detailed reactions to
experimental perturbations on a genome-wide scale. This makes
HTS one of the most promising tools in functional genomics.

Although the phenotypes in HTS data mostly correspond to single
genes, it becomes more and more important to analyze them in
the context of cellular pathways and networks to understand how
genes work together. Network analysis of HTS data depends on
the dimensionality of the phenotypic readout (Markowetz, 2010).
While specialized analysis approaches exist for high—dimensional
phenotyping (e.g. Frohlich et al., 2008), analysis approaches for
low-dimensional screens have so far been spread out over diverse
softwares and online tools like DAVID (Huang et al., 2009) or gene
set enrichment analysis (GSEA; Subramanian et al., 2005).

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.
IThe authors wish it to be known that, in their opinion, the ﬁrst two authors
should be regarded as joint First Authors.

Here we provide a software to build integrated analysis pipelines
for HTS data that contain gene set and network analysis approaches
commonly used in many papers (as reviewed by Markowetz, 2010).
HTSana/yzeR is implemented by S4 classes in R (R Development
Core Team, 2009) and freely available Via the Bioconductor project
(Gentleman et al., 2004). The example pipeline provided by
HTSana/yzeR interfaces directly with existing HTS pre-processing
packages like cellHTS2 (Boutros et al., 2006) or RNAither (Rieber
et al., 2009). Additionally, our software will be fully integrated in
a web-interface for the analysis of HTS data (Pelz et al., 2010) and
thus be easily accessible to non-programmers.

2 AN INTEGRATED ANALYSIS PIPELINE FOR
HIGH-THROUGHPUT SCREENING DATA

HTSana/yzeR takes as input HTS data that has already undergone
pre-processing and quality control (e. g. by using cellHTS2). It then
functionally annotates the hits by gene set enrichment and network
analysis approaches (see Fig. 1 for an overview).

Gene set analysis: HTSana/yzeR implements two approaches:
(i) hypergeometric tests for surprising overlap between hits and gene
sets, and (ii) gene set enrichment analysis to measure if a gene set
shows a concordant trend to stronger phenotypes. HTSana/yzeR
uses gene sets from MSigDB (Subramanian et al., 2005), Gene
Ontology (Ashburner et al., 2000), KEGG (Kanehisa et al., 2006)
and others. The accompanying Vignette explains how user-deﬁned
gene sets can easily be included. Results are Visualized as an
enrichment map (Merico et al., 2010).

Network analysis: In a complementary approach strong hits are
mapped to a network and enriched subnetworks are identiﬁed.
Networks can come from different sources, especially protein
interaction networks are often used. In HTSana/yzeR we use
networks deﬁned in the BioGRID database (Stark et al., 2006), but
other user-deﬁned networks can easily be included in the analysis.
To identify rich subnetworks, we use the BioNet package (Beisser
et al., 2010), which in its heuristic version is fast and produces
close-to-optimal results.

Comparing phenotypes: A goal we expect to become more and
more important in the future is to compare phenotypes for the
same genes in different cellular conditions. HTSana/yzeR supports
comparative analyses for gene sets and networks. Differentially
enriched gene sets are computed by comparing GSEA enrichment
scores or alternatively by a Wilcoxon test statistic. Subnetworks rich

Fig. 1. HTSana/yzeR takes as input HTS data that has already been pre-processed, normalized and quality checked, e. g. by cellHTS2. HTSana/yzeR then
combines the HTS data with gene sets and networks from freely available sources and performs three types of analysis: (i) hypergeometric tests for overlap
between hits and gene sets; (ii) gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) for concordant trends of a gene set in one phenotype; (iii) differential GSEA to identify
gene sets with opposite trends in two phenotypes; and (iv) identiﬁcation of subnetworks enriched for hits. The results are provided to the user as ﬁgures and

HTML tables linked to external databases for annotation.

for more than one phenotype can be found with BioNet (Beisser
et al., 2010).

3 CORE CLASSES AND METHODS

The two core S4 classes in HTSana/yzeR are ‘GSCA’ (Gene Set
Collection Analysis) and ‘NWA’ (NetWork Analysis). S4 methods
for both classes cover the following functions:

Preprocessing: The S4 methods ‘preprocess’ reformat the input
data, e. g. by removing duplicated genes and converting annotations
to Entrez identiﬁers. This step makes the objects of class ‘GSCA’
and ‘NWA’ ready for the following analyses.

Analyses: The S4 methods ‘analyze’ are provided for gene set and
network analyses. Each method depends on several input parameters
which can be deﬁned by the user. HTSana/yzeR also implements
a standard analysis option using default parameters that we have
found to work well in many applications.

Visualization: GSEA random walks, enrichment maps and
rich subnetworks can be Viewed by S4 methods ‘ViewGSEA’,
‘ViewEnrichMap’ and ‘ViewSubNet’, respectively.

Reporting: The analyses results of class ‘GSCA’ and ‘NWA’ can be
reported seperately or together to HTML ﬁles using the S4 methods
‘report’ and ‘reportAll’ , respectively. The output format was inspired
by cellHTS2 and contains network ﬁgures as well as tables linked
to external databases.

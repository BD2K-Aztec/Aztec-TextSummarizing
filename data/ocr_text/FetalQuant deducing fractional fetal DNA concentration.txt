ABSTRACT

Motivation: The fractional fetal DNA concentration is one of the critical
parameters for non-invasive prenatal diagnosis based on the analysis
of DNA in maternal plasma. Massively parallel sequencing (MP8) of
DNA in maternal plasma has been demonstrated to be a powerful tool
for the non-invasive prenatal diagnosis of fetal chromosomal aneuploi-
dies. With the rapid advance of MP8 technologies, the sequencing
cost per base is dramatically reducing, especially when using targeted
MPS. Even though several approaches have been developed for
deducing the fractional fetal DNA concentration, none of them can
be used to deduce the fractional fetal DNA concentration directly
from the sequencing data without prior genotype information.
Result: In this study, we implement a statistical mixture model, named
Feta/Quant, which utilizes the maximum likelihood to estimate the frac-
tional fetal DNA concentration directly from targeted MP8 of DNA in
maternal plasma. This method allows the improved deduction of the
fractional fetal DNA concentration, obviating the need of genotype
information without loss of accuracy. Furthermore, by using Bayes’
rule, this method can distinguish the informative single-nucleotide
polymorphism loci where the mother is homozygous and the fetus is
heterozygous. We believe that Feta/Quant can help expand the spec-
trum of diagnostic applications using MP8 on DNA in maternal
plasma.

1 INTRODUCTION

The discovery of circulating cell-free fetal DNA in maternal
plasma in 1997 has opened up new possibilities for non-invasive
diagnosis (Lo et al., 1997). To date, a wide variety of non-
invasive diagnostic applications have been developed, including
fetal RhD blood group genotyping (Finning et al., 2008; Lo
et al., 1998), fetal sex determination for sex-linked disorders

(Costa et al., 2002), chromosomal aneuploidy detection
(Canick et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2011; Chiu et al., 2008, 2011;
Chu et al., 2009; Fan et al., 2008, 2010; Palomaki et al., 2011,
2012; Peters et al., 2011) and detection of monogenic diseases
(Lun et al., 2008; Tsui et al., 2011). In a number of these appli-
cations, the accurate deduction of the fractional concentration of
fetal DNA is critical for the diagnostic algorithms (Lo et al.,
2007; Lun et al., 2008; Sparks et al., 2012; Tsui et al., 2011).
For example, for the prenatal diagnosis of autosomal recessive
diseases, the relative concentrations of the mutant and wild-type
sequences in maternal plasma are used to infer if a maternal
mutation is passed onto the fetus (Lam et al., 2012; Lun et al.,
2008) because the maternal allele inherited by the fetus would be
present in a slightly higher concentration. In this diagnostic ap-
proach, the fetal DNA concentration is an essential parameter
for determining if an apparent allelic imbalance in maternal
plasma is statistically signiﬁcant.

There are several existing approaches for inferring the frac-
tional fetal DNA concentration in a maternal plasma sample.
For instance, the ratio of the concentrations of sequences located
on chromosome Y and an autosome was used for estimating the
fractional fetal DNA concentration in pregnancies carrying male
fetuses (Lo et al., 1998; Lun et al., 2008). However, these
approaches are not applicable for pregnancies with female
fetuses. An alternative approach would be the analysis of
fetal-speciﬁc alleles in maternal plasma. In this approach, the
fractional fetal DNA concentration is calculated by determining
the ratio of DNA fragments carrying the fetal-speciﬁc alleles and
the alleles shared between the mother and the fetus (Chu et al.,
2010; Lo et al., 2010). In previous studies, the genotype informa-
tion of the fetus and the mother was used for identifying the
fetal-speciﬁc alleles (Chu et al., 2010; Lo et al., 2010).
However, in actual clinical scenarios during non-invasive pre-
natal diagnosis, the fetal genotypes would not be available he-
forehand. Alternatively, the comparison between the maternal
and paternal genotypes can be used for identifying obligately
heterozygous polymorphisms in the fetus for this purpose.
However, paternal DNA may not be available for analysis and
the approach would add cost and additional steps to the analysis.
As an alternative, fetal-speciﬁc epigenetic changes, such as
methylated RASSFI A and unmethylated SERPINBZ sequences,
can be used as fetal markers irrespective of genotype information

(Chan et al., 2006; Chim et al., 2005). However, the analytical
process used for quantifying these epigenetic markers involves
either bisulﬁte conversion or digestion with methylation—sensitive
restriction enzymes, and thus might potentially affect the preci-
sion of these methods.

Massively parallel sequencing (MPS) of plasma DNA frag-
ments can produce millions of short reads that can be aligned
to the reference genome. The fractional fetal DNA concentration
(also referred as the fetal DNA proportion or fetal DNA frac-
tion) can be determined by quantifying fetal-speciﬁc alleles and
alleles shared between the fetus and the mother (shared alleles) in
the maternal plasma based on their genotype information (Liao
et al., 2011; Lo et al., 2010). This kind of analysis is thought to be
a gold standard for fetal DNA fraction estimation. In previous
studies (Liao et al., 2011; Lo et al., 2010), prior knowledge of at
least the maternal genotype was obtained through additional
laboratory analyses. In clinical practice, it would be ideal to
have new methods to determine fetal DNA fraction directly
from the sequencing data that provide the diagnostic information
without additional laboratory steps.

The emergence of targeted MPS technology makes it possible
to obtain the sequencing data with high sequencing depth cover-
age in a cost-effective manner. It permits efﬁcient and unbiased
detection of fetal-speciﬁc alleles at genomic regions of interest as
well as fetal DNA proportion inference in maternal plasma when
using maternal and fetal genotypes (Liao et al., 2011). In this
study, we present a new approach, named FetalQuant, using a
statistical binomial mixture model to deduce the fractional fetal
DNA concentration directly from targeted MPS data. In this
method, the allelic counts are inferred from aligned plasma
DNA reads at each single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
sites annotated in the dbSNP 130 (UCSC Hg18). FetalQuant is
implemented in C++ which is available for non-commercial
users. The major advantage of this approach over existing meth-
ods is that it can directly determine the fractional fetal DNA
concentration by sequencing the DNA in maternal without
using any fetal or paternal genotype information.

2 METHODS

2.1 Maternal—fetal genotype combinations

To investigate how allelic counts can be used to infer the fractional fetal
DNA concentration directly, we deﬁne four categories of maternal—fetal
genotype combinations (Fig. 1) for the SNP loci in the maternal plasma
of singleton pregnancies. Those four combinations can be represented as
AAAA, AAAB, ABAA and ABAB where the main symbols represent the
maternal genotypes while the subscripts represent the fetal genotypes. A
and B refer, respectively, to the most prevalent allele and the second most
prevalent allele at a SNP locus. Hence, AA indicates homozygosity and
AB indicates heterozygosity. From the sequencing data, the measurement
at each SNP locus i comprises the allele A occurrences (a,) and the allele B
occurrences (b,). In theory, the fractional fetal DNA concentration (1‘) can
be deduced directly from the B allele fraction at each of the SNP loci for
the categories such as AAAB and ABAA (Fig. 1). The B allele fraction
would be expected to vary between 0 and 0.5 in maternal plasma depend-
ing on the fractional fetal DNA concentration of that sample. The B
allele fraction would be expected to be 0 for the category AAAA SNP
loci and 0.5 for the category ABAB SNP loci. However, the deviations
from the expected B allele fractions may occur due to sequencing errors
and stochastic variations. Thus, there is a need to develop a statistical

Fig. 1. The possible maternal—fetal genotype combinations. There are
four categories of maternal—fetal genotype combinations in maternal
plasma. Hom and Het represent the homozygous and heterozygous geno-
types, respectively. The possible maternal—fetal genotype combinations in
the maternal plasma are listed in SNP category deﬁnition column. For
example, Category 2 (AAAB) represents the mixture genotypes of homo-
zygous (mother) and heterozygous (fetus). In allelic counts column, the
most prevalent allele (A) and the second most prevalent allele (B) are
deﬁned at each SNP locus for each category. The small case ‘a’ and ‘b’
represent allele A counts and allele B counts in the maternal plasma,
respectively. In B allelic measurement column, the B allele fraction can
be calculated by b/(a + b). The fractional fetal DNA concentration f can
be inferred accurately by estimating the means of the B allele fraction (last
two columns). *Maternal—fetal genotype combinations

model that considers not only the allelic counts on multiple SNP loci but
also the distribution of different maternal—fetal genotype combinations
for those loci in order to have accurate fractional fetal DNA concentra-
tion deduction by minimizing those deviations. We have therefore de-
veloped a systematic analytical workﬂow for the fractional fetal DNA
concentration estimation based on the binomial mixture model with the
sequencing data generated by targeted MPS (Fig. 2).

2.2 Binomial mixture model and likelihood deﬁnition

Since there are four categories of maternal—fetal genotype combinations
in maternal plasma, we have thus proposed a four-component binomial
mixture model (Goya et al., 2010; Roth et al., 2012; Shah et al., 2009) to
ﬁt the observed allelic counts at each SNP locus where the fractional
fetal DNA concentration can be determined through the maximum like-
lihood estimate. In this model, we assume a matemal—fetal genotype
combination G,- = k, k e {AAAA, AAAB, ABAA, ABAB} in maternal
plasma at each SNP locus i to be a multinomial random variable. We
then let X ,- =  represent the allelic counts of the A allele ((1,) and the B
allele (b,) at the NP locus i, and N,- = a,- + b,- is the observed read depth.
We assume that the allelic counts at each SNP locus i follow a binomial
distribution that is conditional on G,- = k, X ,- ~ Binom(b,- | ,uk, N,):

X.- ~ (11:?)MZ‘U — um. (I)
Where  =  and Mk 6 {MAAAAa MAAAB, MABAA, MABAB} iS an ex-
pected mean of the B allele fraction in maternal plasma for each Gi.

Theoretically, if we assume the fractional fetal DNA concentration is f,
the expected B allele fractions for the different maternal—fetal genotype
combinations ,uAAAA, ,uAAABMABAB and ,uABAA are expected to ﬂuctuate
around 0, f/2, 0.5 and 0.5-f/2, respectively (Fig. 1). The ﬂuctuations are
affected by the probabilities of sequencing errors and alignment errors as
well as stochastic variations. The fractional fetal DNA concentration can
be determined by the observed allelic counts at each SNP locus i for the
maternal—fetal genotype combinations AAAB and ABAA.

Subsequently, in order to deduce the fractional fetal DNA concentra-
tion based on the observed allelic counts, we built a mixture model to
explain the observed allelic counts in a probabilistic way. For a given
SNP locus position i, the distribution of the allelic counts X ,-, p(X,-), is
derived from a linear combination of the conditional binomial

Fig. 2. The analytic workﬂow for fractional fetal DNA concentration
deduction. The ﬁrst step of the workﬂow is to extract DNA from the
maternal plasma. The extracted DNA fragments from the genomic re-
gions of interest are enriched through a hybridization system followed by
DNA sequencing library preparation and sequencing. After sequencing,
the sequenced reads are aligned to a reference genome. The pileup results
of the alignment for the covered regions are generated by using
SAMTOOLS (right panel). The nucleotide and the corresponding
number of B alleles are underscored. The allelic counts a and b, as well
as B allele fraction, can be calculated from the pileup results. For ex-
ample, for SNP [C/G] site, the A allele (C) has three counts and the B
allele (G) has two counts. Hence, the B allele fraction is 0.4 (2/5).
FetalQuant utilizes allelic counts to compute the maximum log-likelihood
based on the binomial mixture model. The fractional fetal DNA concen-
tration can be determined by the corresponding ﬁvalue illustrated by the
vertical dash line in the bottom curve plot

Thus, the complete data log-likelihood can be deﬁned as

where T is the total number of SNP loci used for estimating the fractional
fetal DNA concentration. In addition, the log-likelihood can be further
modelled by considering the sequencing errors and alignment errors for
all SNP loci (Goya et al., 2010). Thus, the accuracy of the model can be
further improved by taking into account the alignment errors and sequen-
cing errors using the equation:

10gp(X1;T|u,n) o<

where r}. is the probabilities of alignment errors and q; is the probabilities
of sequencing errors for the jth aligned base at the SNP locus i. In this
study, FetalQuant integrated the sequencing errors inferred from sequen-
cing quality scores. Furthermore, using the Bayes’ rule, the posterior
probabilities over matemal—fetal genotype combinations at each SNP
locus i, yk = Pr(Gk|a,-, Ni, nk, ,uk), can be calculated by:

2.3 Fractional fetal DNA concentration deduction using
binomial mixture model

Next, we deduce the fractional fetal DNA concentration by ﬁtting the
mixture model. We impose both grid search and conventional conjugate
updating rules to implement the expectation and maximization (EM)
algorithm, i.e. to ﬁnd optimal parameters corresponding to the maximum
likelihood. In order to start the iteration of EM, which alternates between
computing the expectation of the log-likelihood evaluated using current
estimated parameters and computing parameters maximizing the ex-
pected log-likelihood, different parameters need to be initialized ﬁrst.
To achieve this, we assume that nk, k e {AAAA,AAAB,ABAA,ABAB},
is distributed according to a Dirichlet distribution: mC ~ beta(7rk | 8k). mC
is initialized by SIC/Z]. 61-, where 6;, is set by a weighting vector {7,1,1, 1}
according to the a priori frequency of different maternal—fetal genotype
combinations in maternal plasma. The a priori frequencies can be esti-
mated from the genotyping results of different individuals of dataset 1 in
Section 3.1 using the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0
(see Supplementary Fig. S1 in File 1). We initialize ,uk according to a beta
distribution which is a conjugate prior distribution of binomial likeli-
hood, ,uk ~ betamklak, ,Bk) where ,uk is initialized by ,Bk/Otk + ,8k.
Because the median fractional fetal DNA concentration in maternal
plasma is close to 10% (Lun et al., 2008), ,uk is expected to ﬂuctuate
around {0, 0.05, 0.45, 0.5} for most of the samples. Therefore, we initial-
ize oak and ,8], as {10 000, 9500, 5500, 5000} and {1, 500, 4500, 5000},
respectively.

The EM algorithm iterates between the expectation step (E-step) where
the log-likelihood is calculated by equation (4) and the maximization
steps (M-step) where the model parameters ,uk and mC are re—estirnated
by the following updating rules. In each iteration, we evaluate the
log-likelihood to determine whether the log-likelihood has reached a max-
imum. In M-step, It], is renewed by the standard conjugate updating rule
(Goya et al., 2010):

2.; 116.- = k) + 6k
2,- 2.11m- =1) + 6.-
where I(G,- = k) is an indicator function to signify the possibility that the
matemal—fetal genotype combination k is assigned to G,- at SNP locus i.

[L], are updated by the following equation for the maternal—fetal genotype
combinations AAAA and ABAB:

21:10);- x I(G,- = k) + 13,.) — 1
ZiT:1(NiX 1(Gi = k) +05;C + 13k) _ 2'

 

ITI‘CWUC) = (6)

 

MHCWUC) = (7)

Whereas for maternal—fetal genotype combinations AAAB and ABAA,
their ,uk parameters are mainly determined by the fractional fetal DNA
concentration (1‘) in plasma, where 0 5 f 5 1. The grid-search strategy
covering the whole spectrum of fractional fetal DNA concentrations is
applied to update these two maternal—fetal genotype combinations with
the following two equations:

unWAAAB) = g (8)

MWABAA) = WWABAB) — g . (9)

According to previous large-scale studies (Chiu et al., 2011; Palomaki
et al., 2011), the fractional fetal DNA concentration is unlikely to be
greater than 0.5 in maternal plasma. Hence, we compute the fractional
fetal DNA concentration iteratively from 0 to 0.5, progressing with 0.001
increment per iteration until the log-likelihood achieves the maxirna (see
Supplementary Fig. S2). Thus, based on our proposed model above, the
fractional fetal DNA concentration f in maternal plasma can be deter-
mined once grid search has attained the maximum log-likelihood.

3 RESULTS
3.1 FetalQuant evaluation by synthetic datasets

To elucidate the robustness and reliability of FetalQuant, we ﬁrst
tested the algorithm using two computationally simulated data-
sets. The synthetic datasets were composed of a set of SNP loci
with the allelic counts for two alleles (the most prevalent allele
and the second most prevalent allele) on each SNP locus and
were simulated with the following criteria:

(1) Assuming there was no sequencing error and the allelic
count distributions followed the binomial distribution.

(2) For both datasets, the fractional fetal DNA concentrations
(f) were predeﬁned from 8 to 36% with 1% increment for
each simulated sample. This has generated a total of 29
samples for each simulated dataset. The number of the
total SNP loci used was 20 000 for all simulated samples.

(3) The predeﬁned sequencing depth of each SNP locus in the
shallow-depth dataset was sampled randomly from the
SNP locus in the empirical Dataset 1 (see Section 3.2.1)
in order to mimic the empirical dataset as closely as pos-
sible. For the high-depth dataset, the predeﬁned sequen-
cing depth of each SNP site was set to 200 in order to
demonstrate clearly the effects of sequencing depth on
FetalQuant’s performance.

(4) The a priori frequencies of the maternal-fetal genotype
combinations were set at 0.7, 0.1, 0.1 and 0.1 for AAAA,
AAAB, ABAA and ABAB, respectively.

Following the above criteria, considering only binomial vari-
ance, we generated one synthetic shallow-depth dataset that was
similar to the empirical Dataset 1 in terms of sequencing depth
(75.2-fold) and the fractional fetal DNA concentrations that
ranged from 8 to 36%. We also generated another high-depth
dataset (200-fold). After the synthetic datasets were generated,
FetalQuant was evaluated using these two datasets based on the
consistency between the predeﬁned and the FetalQuant deduced
fractional fetal DNA concentration. Under the assumptions
above, if FetalQuant performs well, the deduced fractional fetal
DNA concentrations should be very close to the actual prede-
ﬁned fractional fetal DNA concentrations. The results showed
that most of the data points lined up closely around the diagonal
line indicating the consistency between the estimated and the
predeﬁned fractional fetal DNA concentrations (Fig. 3A). Such
consistency was further illustrated by the mean degree of devi-
ation of the predeﬁned fractional fetal DNA concentration of
only 2% (ranged from 0.3 to 5.0%). Furthermore, when the
simulated sequencing depth was increased to 200-fold, the accur-
acy of FetalQuant was improved. The mean degree of deviation
dropped to 0.3% (ranged from 0.0 to 1.8%) (Fig. 3B). This com-
putational simulation analysis thus further demonstrated that
FetalQuant could accurately deduce the fractional fetal DNA
concentrations at achievable targeted sequencing depths.

3.2 FetalQuant evaluation by experimental datasets

and the expected values from the gold standard. The ﬁrst experi-
mental dataset (Dataset 1) included maternal plasma samples
from 14 pregnancies which were reported in a previous publica-
tion (Liao et al., 2012). Among these samples, seven were from
pregnancies involving euploid fetuses and seven were from preg-
nancies with trisomic fetuses (see Supplementary Table S1).
These 14 samples were sequenced using the Genome Analyzer
IIx (Illumina) with or without target enrichment (referred as tar-
geted samples and non-targeted samples, respectively). In the
ﬁrst dataset, the SureSelect customized Kit (Agilent), was used
to perform solution phase target enrichment as previously
described (Liao et al., 2012). The probes covered a total region
of ~5.5 Mb on chromosomes 7 (945kb), 11 (389kb), 13
(1.1 Mb), 18 (1.2 Mb), 21 (1.3 Mb) and X (181kb). The targeted
regions covered a total of ~27 000 SNPs in the dbSNP130 data-
base among which ~4000 SNPs were represented on the
Affymetrix SNP array 6.0. The second experimental dataset
(Dataset 2) involved 12 maternal plasma samples which were
reported in an earlier study (Liao et al., 2011). Maternal
plasma samples were collected from four pregnant women in
each of the three trimesters (i.e. four samples per trimester)
and were sequenced using the Genome Analyzer IIx (Illumina)
with or without target enrichment. In the second dataset, the
SureSelect Human X Chromosome Kit (Agilent) covered 85%
of the exons on human chromosome X (~3 Mb exonic regions).
The targeted regions covered a total of ~12 500 SNPs in the
dbSNP130 database among which ~1000 SNPs were represented
on the Affymetrix SNP array 6.0.

After the sequencing, all the sequenced reads were aligned to
the human reference genome Hg18 using SOAP2 (Li et al., 2009)
allowing at most two mismatches. Hg18 was used here because
the capture probes were designed according to reference genome
Hg18. For the ﬁrst dataset, we obtained a median of ~6 million
aligned reads for each of the targeted and non-targeted samples.
On average, 72.0% (on target rate) of the sequenced reads were
aligned to the targeted regions. 99.8% of the targeted regions
were covered by at least one sequenced read. The median sequen-
cing depth of the targeted regions was 75.2-fold (ranged from
63.9 to 95.8) (see Supplementary Table S1). For the second

dataset (Dataset 2), the median sequencing depth was 98.6-fold
(ranged from 49.9- to 118.9-fold). The detailed sample and
sequencing information has been described in a previous report
(Liao et al., 2011).

The base pileup ﬁles were generated by SAMtools (Li et al.,
2009), which were fed into the FetalQuant programme to esti-
mate the fractional fetal DNA concentration based on the max-
imum likelihood. For all of these cases, maternal genomic DNA
was extracted from the buffy coat and fetal genomic DNA was
extracted from the chorionic Villi samples or placental tissues.
Maternal and fetal genotypes were examined by the
Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 (Affymetrix) as previously
described (Liao et al., 2011).

3.2.2 Evaluation The expected fractional fetal DNA concen-
tration can be calculated based upon the non-targeted sequen-
cing data and the genotype information from both the mother
and fetus according to the following equation:

219

f (p + q) x 100, (10)
where p is the count of DNA molecules carrying the fetal-speciﬁc
allele, and q is the count of DNA molecules carrying the allele
shared by both the fetus and the mother (Liao et al., 2011; Lo
et al., 2010). We refer this method as th-Seq(n0ntarget), where
‘th’ represents the requirement of genotype information and
‘Seq(n0ntarget)’ stands for sequencing without target enrich-
ment. Informative SNP loci that were homozygous in the
mother and heterozygous in the fetus were identiﬁed. The
number of reads carrying the fetal-speciﬁc and the shared alleles
were determined at each of these SNP loci for the calculation of
the actual fractional fetal DNA concentration. The fractional
fetal DNA concentration calculated by th-Seq(n0ntarget) was
used as the gold standard in this study. Similarly, the
th-Seq( target) can be determined following the above proced-
ures but with the sequencing data after target enrichment. We
ﬁrst investigated whether the targeted sequencing would alter the
fractional fetal DNA concentration in a plasma DNA sample
and in turn affect the accuracy of FetalQuant. We then used
FetalQuant to calculate the fractional fetal DNA concentration
and made comparisons among these three methods:
th-Seq(n0ntarget), th-Seq( target) and FetalQuant, in order
to evaluate the performance of FetalQuant.

The fractional fetal DNA concentrations of the non-targeted
plasma samples, th-Seq(n0ntarget), ranged from 9.1 to 19.5%
for Dataset 1 and 10.4 to 34.3% for Dataset 2. The results gen-
erated using th-Seq( target) ranged from 7.6 to 19.5% for
Dataset 1 and 10.0 to 35.4% for Dataset 2 (see Supplementary
Tables S1 and S2). Furthermore, the results showed that most of
the points lined up around the diagonal line suggesting that the
th-Seq( target) results were very close to those of the
th-Seq(n0ntarget) (Fig. 4A) and the median degree of deviation
is 6.7% (ranged from 0.6 to 22.3%). These results were consistent
with a previous report (Liao et al., 2011), which showed that
targeted MPS permitted efﬁcient and unbiased detection of
fetal alleles at genomic regions of interest. Thus, it is feasible
to use FetalQuant for the accurate estimation of fractional fetal
DNA concentration. Next, we investigated if the fractional fetal
DNA concentrations deduced by FetalQuant were consistent

fractional fetal DNA concentrations between Giy—Seq(iarget) and
th—eq(n0ntarget); 03) Comparison of the deduced fractional fetal
DNA concentration between FetalQuant and th—Seq(n0ntarget). The
data points lying inside the black circle correspond to the relatively shal-
low sequencing depth (Supplementary Table S2)

with the gold standard, th-seq(n0ntarget). The fractional fetal
DNA concentrations deduced by FetalQuant ranged from 9.6 to
19.3% for Dataset 1 and from 10.3 to 30.2% for Dataset 2. Also,
the concentrations deduced by FetalQuant were very close to the
concentrations calculated by using the th-Seq (nontarget) ap-
proach without systematic bias (Fig. 4B) and the median of
degree of deviation is 5.6% (ranged from 0.6 to 22.0%) which
is comparable to th-Seq (target). This result was demonstrated
by the fact that most of the data points in Figure 4B lined up
close to the diagonal line except for four data points deviating
from the diagonal line due to the shallow sequencing depth
(Fig. 4B, circled data points on right panel under the curve
and Supplementary Table S2). Supplementary Tables S1 and
S2 further summarize the deduced fractional fetal DNA concen-
trations and the sample information for these two datasets. In
addition, the informative SNP sites, where the mother is homo-
zygous and the fetus is heterozygous, can be distinguished with
probabilistic conﬁdences according to equation (5). The accuracy
of informative SNP prediction is on average 97.0% (ranged from
91.5 to 100%) (see Supplementary Tables S3 and S4).

3.3 The number of SNP loci and the sequencing
depth required for accurate fractional fetal DNA
concentration deduction by FetalQuant

Next, we investigated the factors that would affect the accuracy
of the fractional fetal DNA concentrations deduction by
FetalQuant. Our study showed that the number of SNP loci
used in the model ﬁtting and the sequencing depth are two im-
portant factors. First, the more SNP loci we used, the more ac-
curate the fractional fetal DNA concentration deduction would
be. However, using more SNP loci would require one to sequence
more targeted genomic regions and accordingly would increase
the sequencing cost. Therefore, it is important to know the min-
imum number of SNP loci needed for accurate fractional fetal
DNA concentration deduction. Second, the detectability of the
minor allele at each SNP locus is crucial for deducing the mater-
nal—fetal genotype combination at that position and in turn
would affect the accuracy of fractional fetal DNA concentration
deduction. If the sequencing depth is not deep enough, the
fetal-speciﬁc allele would not be detected by the sequencing

reaction. For example, only 40% the SNP sites can be covered
once by fetal-speciﬁc allele at 10-fold sequencing depth assuming
10% fetal DNA in plasma, which would result in a false classi-
ﬁcation of an AAAB genotype combination as an AAAA geno-
type combination for 60% of SNP sites.

To investigate the required number of SNP loci for accurate
fractional fetal DNA concentration deduction, we performed a
simulation analysis as described in Section 3.1 at a given frac-
tional fetal DNA concentration and sequencing depth. We ﬁxed
the fractional fetal DNA concentration to be 5%, which was a
reasonable lower boundary of the fractional fetal DNA concen-
tration for addressing this question because 95% of the maternal
plasma samples had a fractional fetal DNA concentration larger
than 5% (Chiu et al., 2011; Palomaki et al., 2011). We also used
200 as the predeﬁned sequencing depth because we could detect
the fetal-speciﬁc allele at least once with 99% conﬁdence at this
sequencing depth, assuming that the allelic account distributions
followed the binomial distribution. Then, we generated the data-
sets with different numbers of SNP loci (from 20 to 8000 at the
ﬁxed sequencing depth 200-fold), according to the assumption in
Section 3.1. We next calculated the fractional fetal DNA concen-
trations using FetalQuant on each dataset. Then we calculated
the degree of deviation (e%) using equation (11) to investigate
the relationship between the accuracy of the fractional fetal
DNA concentration deduction and the number of SNP loci
involved.

The simulation results showed that with increased number of
informative SNP loci, e% decreased. We also found that that e%
would be less than 5% when the number of SNP loci was larger
than 1000 (Fig. 5A).

To further investigate how the sequencing depth affected the
deduction accuracy, we ﬁxed the fractional fetal DNA concen-
tration at 5% and the number of SNP loci at 1000. We then
generated the simulated data at different sequencing depths

e% = x 100. (11)

ferent number of informative SNP loci used in model ﬁtting (the frac-

deviation (e%) at the different levels of sequencing depth used in model
ﬁtting (the fractional fetal DNA concentration was ﬁxed at 5% and the
number of SNP loci was ﬁxed at 1000 during this simulation)

(from 20- to 1000-fold) with a similar approach described
above. As shown in Figure 5B, with the increase of the sequen-
cing depth, e% decreased. We observed that e% was less than
5% when the sequencing depth reached 230-fold. Hence, the
deduction accuracy largely depends on the availability of sequen-
cing counts (i.e. the number of SNP loci times the sequencing
depth).

Current targeted MPS technology can readily achieve the
above criteria and therefore there is no practical limitation for
the FetalQuant algorithm when it is applied to deduce the frac-
tional fetal DNA concentration even for the comparatively lower
fractional fetal DNA concentrations (i.e. 5%). For instance,
HiSeq 2000 (Illumina) can generate, on average, 100 million
36-bp reads per lane, which is equivalent to ~700-fold coverage
at each SNP locus after performing target enrichment for gen-
omic regions of interest of up to 5 Mb. The latter regions would
contain around 5000 SNPs on average assuming there is 1 SNP
per kilobase in the human genome WVang et al., 2008).

4 DISCUSSION

We have described a statistical approach based on a binomial
mixture model to infer the fractional fetal DNA concentration
from targeted sequencing data of DNA in maternal plasma,
called FetalQuant, which is implemented in C++ language. We
currently only provide the executables running on x86_64 GNU/
Linux platform. It will take 171s to analyze 20197SNPs with
72.8-fold coverage on an Intel Xeon 2.80 GHz CPU.

We demonstrated that this probabilistic approach can achieve
accurate fetal DNA fraction estimation without prior knowledge
of fetal and parental genotype information. In addition, we inte-
grated the sequencing errors and the alignment errors into our
model using a probabilistic weighting technique similar to the
small nucleotide variation (SNV) detection model previously
described (Goya et al., 2010), which eliminated the need of em-
ploying arbitrary thresholds on base and mapping qualities. This
will further improve the fractional fetal DNA concentration de-
duction accuracy when higher quality sequencing reads can be
obtained due to continual advances in sequencing technologies
and bioinformatics alignment software.

The major challenge in this study is to infer the parameters of
this mixture model. Previous methods for classifying genomic
genotypes, e.g. SNVMix (Goya et al., 2010), are not suitable
for the maternal plasma scenario because of the overwhelming
maternal background DNA in maternal plasma. The SNVMix
model was designed to classify three components (AA, AB and
BB) with means of 0, 0.5 and 1, respectively. In contrast, at the
fetal DNA concentration of 10% in maternal plasma, the means
of the four components in our scenario (Fig. 1) would be 0,
0.025, 0.475 and 0.5, respectively. To differentiate these four
close values, we use a grid search strategy to exhaust the critical
parameters during EM steps that nearly cover the whole realistic
spectrum of fractional fetal DNA concentrations (0—50%) in
maternal plasma samples. Hence, FetalQuant is resistant to fall-
ing within local optimization as conventional EM algorithms. In
summary, FetaQuant serves as a potentially useful tool for im-
proving the accuracy of the non-invasive prenatal diagnostic
methods that require an accurate deduction of the fraction
fetal DNA concentration.

4.1 Dependence on the sequencing depth and the number
of SNP loci in the regions of interest

The sequencing depth and the number of informative SNP loci
used in the model ﬁtting are two major factors that affect the
accuracy of the FetalQuant algorithm. In general, the larger the
number of informative SNP loci that is used, the less sequencing
depth one would require achieving the same level of estimation
accuracy. In our targeted MPS experiments, FetalQuant could
accurately deduce the fractional fetal DNA concentrations for
most of the samples with the number of SNP loci covered in
different regions of the chromosomes (~27 000 SNPs in
Dataset 1 and ~12 500 SNPs in Dataset 2).

However, our data showed that there were four cases deviating
from the diagonal line (Fig. 4B, top-right within black circle),
indicating comparatively lower deduction accuracies for those
samples. We reasoned that it might be largely due to the rela-
tively shallow sequencing depth (~50-fold). In contrast, the de-
viations from the diagonal line of the remaining samples were
relatively small that coincided with the relatively high sequencing
depth (~100-fold). Further study based on the simulated data
showed that 1000 SNP loci and 200-fold sequencing coverage
would be necessities for accurately deducing the fractional fetal
DNA concentration at 5% level with degree of deviation less
than 5%. Furthermore, the computational simulation also sug-
gests that there is still room for improving the deduction accur-
acy by increasing the sequencing depth for our empirical
datasets.

4.2 Costs and potential applications of FetalQuant

This approach could be adopted for the MPS-based non-invasive
prenatal diagnosis, e.g. fetal aneuploidy detection. As a
proof-of-principle study, the target enrichment in this study
was performed in a non-multiplexed manner, in which one cap-
ture library could be used for only one sample. Recently, target
capture systems with multiplexing capability have become avail-
able from three major commercial suppliers, in which one cap-
ture library could accommodate multiple indexed samples.
Considering the rapidly dropping cost in target enrichment and
sequencing, we expect that the cost of this approach would go
down to below US $100 per sample.

4.3 Limitations

One potential limitation of FetalQuant is that it assumes the
SNPs are randomly distributed across the whole genome. In
reality, there are some distributional bias of SNPs, for example,
the neighboring-nucleotide patterns of transitions were domi-
nated by the hyper-mutability effects of CpG dinucleotides and
transitions are four times more frequent than transversions
among the substitution mutations (Zhao and Boerwinkle,
2002). In addition, FetalQuant assumes that sequencing errors
are random. However, sequencing errors have some preference
and it is especially true for low-quality bases and those near the
3’-end of reads. AC and GT miscalls during base calling are
signiﬁcantly over-represented (Li et al., 2009). Currently, align-
ment errors are not fully taken into account in the model because
SOAP2 does not provide the alignment uncertainties in a prob-
abilistic manner (Li et al., 2009). Furthermore, the allelic count

bias introduced during the sequencing alignment (Degner et al.,
2009) or allele-speciﬁc copy number variation might affect the
fractional fetal DNA concentration deduction. However, as the
number of SNP loci (~12 500) used for estimating fetal DNA
fraction is large and disperse, the speciﬁc bias caused by certain
SNP(s) may contribute little to the current model. In the future,
the FetalQuant model can be further improved by taking into
count the alignment bias, the SNP substitution patterns, as well
as copy number variation on SNP loci.

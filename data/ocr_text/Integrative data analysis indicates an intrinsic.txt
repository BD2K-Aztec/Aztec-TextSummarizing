ABSTRACT

Motivation: Argonaute-interacting WG/GW proteins are characterized
by the presence of repeated sequence motifs containing glycine (G)
and tryptophan (W). The motifs seem to be remarkably adaptive to
amino acid substitutions and their sequences show non-contiguity.
Our previous approach to the detection of GW domains, based on
scoring their gross amino acid composition, allowed annotation of
several novel proteins involved in gene silencing. The accumulation
of new experimental data and more advanced applications revealed
some deficiency of the algorithm in prediction selectivity. Additionally,
W-motifs, though critical in gene regulation, have not yet been anno-
tated in any available online resources.

Results: We present an improved set of computational tools allowing
efficient management and annotation of W-based motifs involved in
gene silencing. The new prediction algorithms provide novel function-
alities by annotation of the W-containing domains at the local
sequence motif level rather than by overall compositional properties.
This approach represents a significant improvement over the previous
method in terms of prediction sensitivity and selectivity. Application of
the algorithm allowed annotation of a comprehensive list of putative
Argonaute-interacting proteins across eukaryotes. An in-depth char-
acterization of the domains’ properties indicates its intrinsic disordered
character. In addition, we created a knowledge-based portal (whub)
that provides access to tools and information on RNAi-related trypto-
phan-containing motifs.

1 INTRODUCTION

Despite the fact that different classes of small RNAs are gener-
ated by largely different biogenesis pathways, in order to
function they associate with Argonaute proteins (AGOs) and
form the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) (Kuhn and
Joshua-Tor, 2013). The ‘guide strand’ of the sRNA duplex
directs the AGOs to speciﬁc targets on the DNA (transcriptional
gene silencing) or RNA (post-transcription gene silencing)
through base complementarity. On the target molecule, the

AGO proteins interact with GW proteins, which are character-
ized by the presence of repeated sequence motifs containing two
amino acids: glycine (G) and tryptophan (W). These motifs me-
diate direct interaction with various AGO protein family mem-
bers throughout the eukaryotic kingdom (Bednenko et al., 2009;
Ding et al., 2005; Eulalio et al., 2009b; He at al., 2009; Jakymiw
et al., 2005; Karlowski et al., 2010. Partridge et al., 2007; Till
et al., 2007). Most recently, it has been shown that some Viruses
contain polypeptides that mimic host-encoded proteins with
WG/GW motifs and act as bait for the Argonaute to hack
into the host’s essential effector of RNA silencing (Aqu et al.,
2013; Azevedo et al., 2010; de Ronde et al., 2014; Giner et al.,
2010; Szabo et al., 2012).

Over the years, our View of GW proteins has evolved from
them being a static platform for clustering of AGO proteins to
functional domains composed of short tryptophan-containing
modules that coordinate Vital steps in gene silencing (Azevedo
et al., 2011). The extremely divergent sequence, variable lengths
(ranging from 22 to up to 650 aa) and number of composing
dipeptide WG/GW repeats (from 1 to up to 40) make the WG/
GW domain difficult to identify using in silico methods
(Karlowski et al., 2010). Therefore, our previous approach
(Karlowski et al., 2010; Zielezinski and Karlowski, 2011) was
based on scoring gross compositional amino acid properties of
the sequence rather than plain linear similarity. However, the
more advanced and detailed applications revealed some defi-
ciency of the algorithm in prediction selectivity. Additionally,
the initial method did not include identification of the recently
described, new types of W-based motifs (referred to here as W-
motifs) which are involved in interactions with the CCR4—NOT
complex and mRNA translational repression and deadenylation
processes (Chekulaeva et al., 2011).

Deficiency of a comprehensive resource for functional GW/
GW proteins in any of the central protein [e.g. UniProt (The
UniProt Consortium, 2014), RefSeq (Pruitt et al., 2012)] and/
or specialized domain databases [e.g. Pfam (Finn et al., 2014),
InterPro (Hunter et al., 2012)] as well as quickly accumulating
knowledge about the properties of the W-based AGO/CCR4—
NOT interacting proteins inspired us to develop new computa-
tional tools to facilitate efficient management and annotation of
W-motifs. The novel prediction approach addresses all the faults
of the previous method and provides novel functionalities by
annotation of the tryptophan-containing domains involved in
gene silencing at the local sequence motif level, rather than by
searching for large regions of multiple WG/GW motifs. We
developed Whub—a knowledge-based portal that provides

An intrinsic disordered domain character of Argonaute-binding motifs

 

access to all available information on RNAi-related W-contain-
ing motifs—in order to address the need for a centralized source
of information about this structurally and functionally unusual
group of proteins.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Calculation of the position-speciﬁc scoring matrix for
single W-containing motifs.

The source sequence dataset consists of a manually selected col-
lection of WG/GW protein domains that have already been
described as interacting with AGO/CCR4—NOT protein com-
plexes. From the initial set all non-overlapping subsequences
were extracted that contained a single W residue ﬂanked by
non-tryptophan amino acids. The ungapped multiple sequence
alignment was performed to represent a proﬁle of the selected
motifs, in which tryptophan was assumed to be a midpoint (pos-
ition 0) and the ﬂanking non-W residues spread through pos-
itions in both directions (N- and C—termini). As the subsequences
differ in their lengths, the weights of the W-ﬁanking residues
decrease. The observed frequencies (Pobs) of all non-tryptophan
residues were obtained from counts of amino acids within each
column of the proﬁle following the formula:

Pobsia = Nia/N

where i stands for each of the positions in the motif sequence; a
stands for each of the amino acids present in given position i; Nia
is the number of occurrences of amino acid a at given position i;
N is the number of motif sequences. The observed frequencies
were compared with the corresponding expected frequencies
(Pexp) obtained from background W-motif sequences in
UniProt and were used to calculate the log-odds according to
the following formula: Dia = 2 X10g2(PObS/Pexp). The method
that was used for annotation of the W-containing motifs proced-
ure is presented in Supplementary Figure S1.

2.2 Search for potential AGO-binding domains

Eukaryotic proteins retrieved from the UniProt database were
scanned for potential AGO-binding sites using the position-spe-
ciﬁc scoring matrix (PSSM) built on published, experimentally
veriﬁed W—motifs. P—Values were calculated separately for
W-motifs and assembled domains, and score values were used
to perform distribution-ﬁtting analysis using the EasyFit pro-
gram (Mathwave Technologies). The proteins were clustered
into families using the cd-hit program (Li and Godzik, 2006).

2.3 Benchmarking WG/GW identiﬁcation methods

The prediction methods (PSI-BLAST, HMMER, Agos,
Wsearch) were trained on a set of 200 orthologous AGO-binding
protein sequences and 1000 series of randomly selected sequences
from yeast, Arabidopsis and human proteomes. The prediction
was evaluated by the 10-fold cross-validation approach. The
whole dataset was randomly partitioned into 10 groups of
approximately equal size. The methods were trained on nine
groups and tested on the remaining set to ensure that the training
process was completely independent of the test data. Each of the
groups was used for benchmark calculation. The predicted

quality results were evaluated by sensitivity (SN), speciﬁcity
(SP) and precision (PPV) using the following formulas:
SN = TP/(TP + FN), SP = TN/(TN + FP), PPV = TP/
(T P + FP), where TP, FN, FP and TN represent the numbers
of true positive, false negative, false positive and true negative
residues in the prediction, respectively.

2.4 Random forest-based classification of AGO-binding
W-motifs

The AGO-binding activity was formulated as a binary classiﬁcat-
ion problem: AGO-binding W-motifs are labeled as 1 and non-
binding ones as 0. The sliding window technique was used to
encode the amino acid residues ﬁanking tryptophan. Each
amino acid in the W neighborhood proﬁle is characterized by
several descriptors including the hydrophobic index (Kyte and
Doolittle, 1982), ﬂexibility parameters (Vihinen et al., 1994),
hydrophobicity (Hopp and Woods, 1981), relative accessible
surface area (Chothia, 1976), amino acid weights and volumes.
In addition, the distance (as the number of amino acids) from the
central tryptophan to the closest W residue from N- and
C—termini is used. The parameters selected to determine whether
the W residue belongs to the AGO-binding class include its
neighboring amino acid context and distances to the nearest
W. Various window sizes were tested (Supplementary Table
S1) and a value of 21 was selected for further applications. The
Random Forest algorithm (Breiman, 2001) was implemented by
the Scikit-learn machine learning python library (Pedregosa
et al., 2011).

3 RESULTS

3.1 Wsearch: the position-based prediction method for
functional W-motifs annotation

The new algorithm (Wsearch) determines the probability that
any given amino acid will be found in a particular position of
an AGO-binding site based on an analysis of experimentally
veriﬁed motifs from plants, animals and other eukaryotes.
Wsearch allows for annotation of single W-containing motifs
and identiﬁcation of their boundaries as well as statistical quali-
ﬁcation of predicted sequences.

The prediction procedure incorporates the concept of the
PSSM, where each amino acid is scored based on its frequency
in a given location within the motif. The rationale behind this
approach comes from the experimental observation that trypto-
phan is critical for the domain function and its amino acid
context modulates the strength of interaction. It has also been
reported that not all WG/GW repeats located in the functional
domain contribute equally to the interaction (Chekulaeva et al.,
2011; Eulalio et al., 2009a; Takimoto et al., 2009; Yao et al.,
2011), and that the substitution of residues adjacent to the re-
peats affects AGO binding (Pfaff et al., 2013; Till et al., 2007).
Therefore, W is located in the midpoint of the calculated scoring
table and the likelihoods of all other amino acids are spread in
both directions. As a consequence of the variable W-motif
sequence length (from 4 up to 95 amino acids), the residues
located at more distant positions from the central tryptophan
have a weaker impact on the motifs’ scores than residues from

closer surroundings (see “Materials and Methods’). This way the
output of the prediction procedure includes the smallest func-
tional units of the whole domain, which allows more detailed
comparative analyses and should be better suited for subsequent
experimental applications. Because the properties of the W-
based, AGO-binding domains are still not well deﬁned, during
the prediction procedure we employ a minimum of assumptions
strategy: all W-containing motifs in an analyzed sequence are
treated as seeds for motif prediction. The annotation process
runs in both directions from the tryptophan residue, calculating
a cumulative score using values from the PSSM matrix. The
analysis stops when the score reaches a maximum, which guar-
antees identiﬁcation of the best-scoring motif.

3.1.1 Benchmarking 0f AGO-binding identification methods For
the new method evaluation, we compared the quality of Wsearch
predictions with a previous version of the algorithm (Agos) as
well as two of the most popular domain identiﬁcation
approaches—PSI-BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997) and
HMMER3 (Finn et al., 2011). The quality of the predictions
was assessed on a domain and amino acid level.

3.1.2 Performance at the domain level All methods were trained
and tested on a set of 200 orthologous AGO-binding proteins
and 1000 series of 2000 randomly selected sequences from yeast,
Arabidopsis and human proteomes. The results of a 10-fold
cross-validation test (see ‘Materials and Methods’) show that
Wsearch achieved best performance in identifying the highest
number of AGO-binding proteins (96.9%) with the highest pre-
cision (99.5%). The Agos tool achieved the second best score
with 90.9% sensitivity and 95.8% precision, while the sequence
alignment-based tools reached values below 60%.

3.1.3 Performance at the amino acid level Recently, Pfaff et al.
(2013) published results on the characterization of 20aa-long
tryptophan-containing peptides from the human N-terminal
part of the TNRC6B protein (162-996 aa) showing variable af-
ﬁnity for binding AGOs (Pfaff et al., 2013). Figure 1 shows a
schematic representation of the computational identiﬁcation of
Ago-binding motifs by Agos and Wsearch along with the results
published by Pfaff et al.

Application of the Agos method resulted in the identiﬁcation
of a single continuous sequence region 616—903 covering 60% of
amino acids (with 79% precision) deﬁned by the peptide-
screening experiment as AGO binding. In contrast, all nine
AGO-interacting regions overlap with the Wsearch prediction
results, including region 467—501 that does not contain the ca-
nonical WG/GW repeat. In total, the Wsearch method predicted
80% of the amino acids involved in AGO binding with 88%
precision. Moreover, the new algorithm detected two additional
fragments in this region which were not predicted by the
laboratory approach but exhibited potential for binding AGO
proteins. The quality of these predictions (P = 1.61E-05
and P = 5.78E-04) suggests that they could possibly interact
with AGOs; however, the interaction may not be AGO2
speciﬁc. Several W-motifs present in the N-terminal part
of the TNRC6B protein that have not been classiﬁed as AGO-
interacting additionally conﬁrmed high selectivity of the new
motif prediction approach even though the whole N-terminus
(162—996) was used to train the algorithm.

along with the results of computational annotation of AGO-binding
motifs using Agos and Wsearch. The results of the peptide-screening
experiment by Pfaff et al. (2013) are shown in the form of tiles of rec-
tangles where the AGO-binding activity is indicated as black-ﬁlled
squares

Additionally, we tested the performance of Agos and Wsearch
on a set of 79 short peptides (20 aa) as designed by Pfaff et al.
(2013) and analyzed by peptide array probing using the recom-
binant Ago2 protein (Supplementary Table S2). The Agos algo-
rithm was unable to detect any of the AGO-binding motifs
because the amino-acid composition signal coming from such
short motifs was too weak to discriminate AGO-binding sites
from background sequences. Wsearch correctly classiﬁed 60%
of the AGO-binding peptides with 80% precision.

Compositionally similar reiterated W-motifs from the
C—terminal region of the GW182 protein and its human homolog
TNRC6A were reported by Lian et al. (2009) as being respon-
sible for interaction with AGO2 proteins. In our predictions
these sequences did not exhibit AGO-binding properties. This
was conﬁrmed by several other reports (Chekulaeva et al.,
2011; Eulalio et al., 2009a; Fabian et al., 2011; Lazzaretti
et al., 2009; Takimoto et al., 2009; Zipprich et al., 2009).

3.2 New properties of the Ago-binding domain

A careful bioinformatic examination of all the described, experi-
mentally veriﬁed AGO-interacting motifs provides new insights
into the domain’s properties.

The difference in the level of sequence conservation between
plant and animal W-domains is one of the most striking features
of AGO-binding motifs (Supplementary Figure S2). The se-
quences of plant domains are very variable and seem to be
shaped by intense evolutionary activity. The results of all-
Versus-all pairwise alignments of W-containing domains in
plants among the orthologs of NRPEl and SPT5 proteins indi-
cate a mean sequence identity of 21% and 29%, respectively
(Supplementary Table S3). The other parts of the proteins
show 55% and 46% identity, respectively. This suggests that
AGO-interacting domains in plants evolve faster than other
parts of the protein and diverge to a point where alignment-
based similarity cannot be precisely determined even between
closely related orthologs. In animals, however, AGO-binding
domains seem to be more conserved and their sequences in
GW182 or Prion proteins (PrP) retain high identity throughout
the mammalian lineage (87—91%; Supplementary Table S3).
Nevertheless, both plant and animal AGO-binding domains
display no sequence conservation outside of the core tryptophan
pattern, between proteins from different families (e.g.
AGO-binding domains between NRPEl and SPT5 or between
the GW182 and PrP).

An intrinsic disordered domain character of Argonaute-binding motifs

 

As was previously reported (Karlowski et al., 2010), computer
simulations of domain-swapping experiments between plant and
animal AGO-binding proteins from different unrelated families
revealed their evolutionary conservation of the amino acid
composition. The tryptophan sequence surroundings in the
AGO-interacting W-motifs of plants and animals show a
biased but common (P = 0.21) amino-acid composition that de-
viates signiﬁcantly (P< 0.001) from nonfunctional W-motifs and
indicates a strong positive tendency towards small, polar and
non-hydrophobic amino acids (G, N, D, E, S). The same ten-
dency was observed based on position-speciﬁc amino acid pref-
erence analysis (Fig. 2; Supplementary Figure S3).

In general, it seems that in different AGO-binding proteins
from plants and animals the tryptophan residues are embedded
in hyper-variable low complexity sequences that fall into locally
disordered regions with low overall hydropathy and high net
charge.

An analysis of distance distribution between 6799 tryptophan
residues from experimentally veriﬁed plant and animal AGO-
binding domains indicates that in tandemly repeated motifs,
tryptophans are in most cases separated by 8—13 amino acid
residues (Fig. 3a). This means that each W in the functional
motif is symmetrically surrounded by 4—7 amino acids on each
side.

Recently, Schirle and MacRae (2012) resolved the structure of
a complex of human AGO2 with two molecules of tryptophan
bound to the site pockets of the PIWI domain (Schirle and
MacRae, 2012). A distance of about 24A between the two tryp-
tophan-binding sites, measured along the surface of the AGO2
molecule (Schirle and MacRae, 2012), corresponds to the span of
8—14 residues. Additionally, using biochemical and nuclear mag-
netic resonance (NMR) experiments, Pfaff et al. (2013) reported
that two tryptophans from the TNRC6B protein are separated
by a spacer with a minimal length of 10 aa. A similar mode of
molecular recognition was also observed for the interaction of
GW182 proteins with the CNOT9 protein (Chen et al., 2014;
Mathys et al., 2014). Our comparative analysis of all functional
AGO-interacting motifs complies well with the experimental re-
sults and additionally suggests that the distance between trypto-
phan residues in AGO-interacting domains is not restricted to
the human GW182 protein but is globally conserved throughout
eukaryotes.

In several hundred of the analyzed W-motifs the distance
separating the closest, neighboring W residues spanned 8—14
amino acids, reaching in extreme cases 100 residues. The graph-
ical presentation of positive and negative selection based on the
PSSM scores that operate on each position relative to the W
residue is shown in Figure 3b. Although the sum of positive
log-odds decreases rapidly by one half at positions outside
the:l:6 range, the amino acids at motif positions of —7, —8 and
—10 as well as +7, +8 and +9 still show clear signatures
of positive selection. In contrast, further positions from the
W midpoint show a lack of any positive, detectable amino acid
preference. This result conﬁrms the functional size of the
AGO-binding motif that does not seem to exceed the :l:10
amino acid boundary. Within this range, the positions of the
strongest negative selection include locations :l:1 and —2, within
the closest proximity to the tryptophan residue. Such distribution
of the conservative positions may imply a non-symmetric

eukaryotic AGO-binding domains, the sequence of the most
ideal, preferred single AGO-binding sequence is ngnnnns

been found in any of the known proteins.

Based on structural analyses determined by NMR (Zahn et al.,
2000) and X-ray (Knaus et al., 2001), human PrP AGO-binding
W-motifs are embedded within the unstructured N-terminal
region. Furthermore, secondary structure predictions of the
GW182 protein family suggest that the AGO-binding domain
is unstructured and does not represent an independent folding
unit (Eulalio et al., 2009a). These studies, along with the results
of the sequence properties as described above, suggest that
the AGO-interaction motifs of eukaryotic proteins constitute
a family of Intrinsically Disordered Domains (IDD) that

exist as ensembles of rapidly interconverting conformations. The
AGO-binding IDD domain can be characterized by the
following distinct features: (i) AGO-binding motifs, which like
many other disordered regions evolve faster than their structur-
ally ordered regions, thus resulting in sequence divergence where
positional similarity cannot be precisely determined; (ii) the
biased amino acid composition of AGO-binding motifs is
consistent with the low overall hydrophobicity and high net
charge characteristic of IDDs. This is manifested by the
exclusion of order-promoting amino acids with the exception
of tryptophan (Y, F, I, V, L) rather than a positive preference
for others (Figs. 2 and 3b); e.g. the AGO-binding sites are
characterized by a very low content of cysteine residues (C),
which is known to have a signiﬁcant contribution to protein
conformation stability Via the disulﬁde bond formation or by
being involved in the coordination of different prosthetic
groups; (iii) the W-motif regions, just as many IDDs (Tompa,
2003), show excessive length polymorphism due to variation in
the number and size of repeats (Fig. 3b). It was proposed that
IDD domains evolve by repeat expansion (Tompa, 2003). In a
similar way, AGO-binding domains fall into a continuum of
repeat units where the exact number of W-motifs differs between
highly related proteins, i.e. NRPEl orthologs in various plants
species or paralogs of human GW182 proteins.

The comparative analysis presented here suggests that AGO-
binding domains, though signiﬁcantly variable in sequence and
length, are composed of repeated sequence motifs that span from
10 to 20 amino acids, placing the W residue at the center of the
hydrophilic and charged surface. This may indicate that W-
based, AGO-binding domains are constrained within a narrow
subset of possible sequences, which most likely are the result of
the biophysical restraints of AGO-interactions that have yet to
be elucidated.

3.3 Identiﬁcation of novel AGO-binding proteins

We applied Wsearch to computationally screen novel AGO-
binding sites across eukaryotic proteomes. Table 1 shows a rank-
ing list of the top-scoring protein families (Pg 1e—05) with
corresponding information about the taxonomic span and
number of members (the full data are available as
Supplementary Table S5).

Several top-scoring predictions overlap with previous results
and in some cases correspond to well known and already char-
acterized AGO-interacting proteins (e.g. SPT5, NRPEl and
GW182). Among the several novel AGO-interacting proteins,
DEAD-box RNA helicases and heterogeneous nuclear ribonu-
cleoproteins (hnRNPs) draw special attention. The well-
conserved helicase domain of the DEAD-box proteins of fungi
(76), animals (18), plants (21) and protists (5) is adjacent or
ﬂanked by highly variable tryptophan-containing repeat se-
quences (data not shown). These proteins were reported to
localize to P-bodies in yeast (Beckham et al., 2008), were found
in human RISC complexes and, in addition to other functions,
are implicated in translation initiation, translation repression and
RNAi (Chen et al., 2014; Mathys et al., 2014; Parsyan et al.,
2011). All identiﬁed hnRNP proteins are characterized by the
presence of one or two well-conserved RNA-Recognition Motifs
(RRM) and a highly divergent C-terminal region that is rich

in tryptophan-containing peptides (Supplementary Figure S4).
The top-ranking candidates, identiﬁed in Nematoda and
Arthropoda, are already implicated in gene silencing: the A1
protein from C. elegans has been reported to bind the conserved
loop of pri-miR-18a through RRM domains (Michlewski et al.,
2008), and two other proteins (Hrb98DE and Hrb87F) from
the fruit ﬂy co-precipitate with the CCR4—NOT complex
(Temme et al., 2010).

The other predicted AGO-interacting proteins listed in Table 1
are represented by peptides of narrow phylogenetic distribution
and are mainly located in unrelated sequence families; e. g. the
IF-2 Translation Initiation Factor with 70 tryptophan motifs can
be found only in two species from the genus Cryptococcus:
C. gatti and C. neoformans. Another case of such non-conserved
sequences includes two RNA-binding proteins from Paramecium
tetraarelia: Nowalp and Nowa2p, which were previously sug-
gested to bind AGO (Nowacki et al., 2005).

3.4 Whub—a knowledge-based portal for silencing-related
tryptophan-motifs

W-motifs, though shown to be critical in post-transcriptional
gene regulation, have not yet been annotated in any available
online resources. Moreover, it is unlikely that a researcher will
ﬁnd a complete list of currently known AGO-binding proteins
across central databases and/or protein specialized resources.
In addition, going through the literature to gain a general View
of functional W-containing motifs is impractical, especially for
newcomers, as each expert research group often focuses on a
single species-speciﬁc protein. One of the outcomes of our
study on the properties of AGO-interacting proteins is an exten-
sive, high-quality collection of all publicly available literature and
sequence data. Therefore, for present and future applications we
created an integrated web portal (Vthb; http://www.comgen.pl/
whub) to facilitate efﬁcient management of information about
proteins containing W-motifs involved in gene silencing.
Whub offers integrated and user-friendly access to current
information about experimentally veriﬁed AGO-interacting
proteins.

The portal offers three ways to access the data: the protein
portlet, the bibliography browser and the prediction tools. The
main protein entry section provides a Visual map of tryptophan
locations in the context of a protein’s functional regions. This
part of the portal allows to browse experimentally mapped,
minimal W-rich regions that are sufﬁcient for interaction with
different AGO/CCR4—NOT proteins as well as a list of experi-
mentally evaluated mutations. The information contained in the
experimental results panel is graphically referenced to a
full-length amino acid sequence. The foundation for the portal
comes from information extracted by literature mining. The
whole collection of papers describing AGO/CCR4—NOT
interacting proteins is assembled in a graphical browser that
allows to search for and sort the entries. The publication section
is deeply integrated with other parts of the portal and creates a
unique way of exploring the content through bibliographical
data.

All of the information contained in the database section of the
Whub portal represents the most up-to-date foundation for
the W-motif annotation tool (W search). The predictions

are shown in the form of interactive tables, charts and graphs.
For large-scale, high-throughput sequence analysis applications,
a stand-alone version of the prediction tool is provided
which additionally allows for calculation of custom PSSM
proﬁles.

The tool repertoire for AGO-binding site annotation is
supplemented with a machine learning (Random Forest; RF)
implementation of the prediction algorithm. In this approach
each amino acid residue is characterized by a number of descrip-
tors, including properties of amino acids and distances to the
nearest tryptophan residue (for details see ‘Material and
Methods’). The RF-based classiﬁer achieves 95.17% sensitivity,
99.94% speciﬁcity and 99.68% precision. All evaluation test re-
sults are provided in Supplementary Table S1.

3.4.1 Computationally-aided domain design Recently, several
research groups studied the detailed properties of the AGO-
and CCR4-NOT-binding domains by biochemical mutagenesis
assays. Szabé et al. (2012) transformed the nonfunctional part

of the SPFMV P1 protein into a functional silencing suppressor
with AGO-binding capacity by introducing two additional
WG/GW motifs. In another study, Filipowicz’s group showed
that insertion of at least four tryptophan residues into the
unstructured region of the non-RNAi-related yeast protein
Sic1p21 was sufﬁcient to induce mRNA repression by recruiting
the CCR4—NOT complex (Chekulaeva et al., 2011).

To model the substitution and insertion effects of various
amino acids within the framework of presented properties of
AGO/CCR4—NOT-binding motifs, we created an interactive
tool that allows dynamic modiﬁcation of any W-motif with a
single residue resolution providing real-time, color-encoded
prediction of binding quality (Fig. 4).

This puzzle-like interface represents a framework for simula-
tion of mutagenesis experiments and hypothesis testing. As a case
example, Figure 4 shows a simulation of Szabo’s experiment
(Szabé et al., 2012)—rendering the functional AGO-binding
domain from the nonfunctional SPFMV Pl ortholog. The
amino acid sequences are presented as a string of blocks of

4 DISCUSSION

The most important aspect of today’s digital biology is access to
data. The increasing amount of information requires new tools
and approaches that will allow for fast and accurate information
retrieval and data mining. Very often the data are spread across
many databases and publications. This is evident especially in the
case of new and developing subjects of scientiﬁc research that
have not yet been completely deﬁned and have not been enclosed
by mature tools and resources. Research on WG/GW proteins
represents one example of such research enterprises—the
proteins are investigated on local bases in which scientists

concentrate on single proteins from particular organisms.
However, the available accumulated knowledge would allow
for a more global and synthetic View of this very interesting
group of proteins.

The Whub portal is a user-oriented and comprehensive
approach for collecting all available knowledge on the biology
of AGO/CCR4-NOT-interacting W-motifs. We have created an
efﬁcient and attractive interface that facilities exploration of
up-to-date information, the discovery of new relationships be-
tween data records and drawing biologically relevant conclusions
concerning highly speciﬁc W-containing motifs.

The implementation of new computational tools involving a
position-based approach instead of the composition-based pre-
diction method resulted in the annotation of new groups of pro-
teins that may interact with Argonautes. These include, among
others, RRM-containing hnRNP proteins and DEAD-box heli-
cases. Many promising predictions are already the subject of
experimental veriﬁcation. Our methods use the modern inf orma-
tion technologies of machine learning and move the AGO-
protein identiﬁcation process to a new level, i.e. where the user
receives a clear functional classiﬁcation of a tested sequence
instead of a set of score numbers that is difﬁcult to interpret.
The annotation results show that the presented computational
approach can distinguish AGO-binding sites from other func-
tional W-containing motifs (e.g. CCR4—NOT) despite the high
amino-acid composition similarity between these two types of
sequences (Supplementary Table S4). This supports the ﬁnding
by Chekulaeva et al. (2011) about the distinct functions of these
two W-based domains. Unfortunately, the limited number of
available CCR4—NOT-binding motifs did not allow to build pre-
diction models for this group of sequences. Nevertheless, we have
already implemented all of the functionality into the Whub
portal, but the quality of the predictions may vary. As soon as
new data are available, they will be incorporated into the predic-
tion procedure.

An in-depth analysis of the properties of experimentally ver-
iﬁed and novel predicted proteins allowed for classiﬁcation of the
W-based domains into the IDD class. A fast evolution rate,
biased amino acid composition, single amino-acid repetitions
(Lobanov et al., 2014) and excessive length polymorphism con-
form well to the characteristics of IDDs. This expands know-
ledge on this new and intensively investigated group of functional
domains. On the other hand, it may help in further research on
AGO/CCR4—NOT-interaction domains including computational
and experimental approaches.

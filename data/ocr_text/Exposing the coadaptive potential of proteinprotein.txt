ABSTRACT

Motivation: In nature, protein—protein interactions are constantly
evolving under various selective pressures. Nonetheless, it
is expected that crucial interactions are maintained through
compensatory mutations between interacting proteins. Thus, many
studies have used evolutionary sequence data to extract such
occurrences of correlated mutation. However, this research is
confounded by other evolutionary pressures that contribute to
sequence covariance, such as common ancestry.

Results: Here, we focus exclusively on the compensatory mutations
deriving from physical protein interactions, by performing large-scale
computational mutagenesis experiments for >260 protein—protein
interfaces. We investigate the potential for co-adaptability present in
protein pairs that are always found together in nature (obligate) and
those that are occasionally in complex (transient). By modeling each
complex both in bound and unbound forms, we find that naturally
transient complexes possess greater relative capacity for correlated
mutation than obligate complexes, even when differences in interface
size are taken into account.

1 INTRODUCTION

Regions that are important for the function and structure of
proteins tend to be highly conserved. Thus, many methods have
been developed to measure functional and structural constraints in
proteins. Identifying correlated mutations (CMs) is one of the most
direct measures for revealing the evolutionary constraints that have
shaped protein structures and their interaction speciﬁcity (Deeds
et al., 2007). The idea is simple: for mutations to survive purifying
selection after one protein has mutated, the ﬁtness of its partner
proteins must be rescued through compensatory mutations. Thus,
a pair of positions is considered to have a CM if the amino acid
identities at the position in the ﬁrst protein are correlated with
the amino acid identities in the partner protein (Thomas et al.,
2009). Several computational approaches have been developed to

predict coevolved residues (Fariselli et al., 2001; Pazos et al.,
1997). CM pairs have been observed both at the intra—molecular
(Shackelford and Karplus, 2007; Thomas et al., 2009) and inter—
molecular (Thomas et al., 2009; Weigt et al., 2009) levels. However,
the CM signal is often too weak to be detected, as it is masked by the
large number of non—coevolving residues (Dunn et al., 2008). Thus,
the study of CM in proteins is often based on some assumption
regarding the mechanisms that have led to the CM, such as the
rate of mutations, evolutionary time scale, distances between the
residues and more (Capra and Singh, 2008), which has often led to
a case—by—case understanding (J othi et al., 2006).

To overcome the low signal of CM, some studies focused
on very large superfamilies, such as G—protein coupled receptors
(Oliveira et al., 2002) or hemoglobin (Pazos et al., 1997). However,
Halperin et al. (2006) concluded that current methodologies for
detecting CM are not suitable for large—scale inter—molecular contact
prediction. One explanation for this poor performance is that it
is difﬁcult to separate the effects of physical interactions within
protein complexes (co—adaptation) from other forces that can also
create global patterns of co—evolution (Chi et al., 2008; Hakes et al.,
2007; Kann et al., 2009; Pazos and Valencia, 2008). Nonetheless,
some recent research does improve these results through various
normalization and ﬁltration schemes (Dunn et al., 2008; Kundrotas
and Alexov, 2006; Lee and Kim, 2009; Yeang and Haussler, 2007).
In addition, by analyzing lattice model proteins it was found that
CM patterns are often consistent with the requirement for thermal
stability (Berezovsky et al., 2007).

On the other hand, the rapid growth in the number of available 3D
protein complexes provides a unique opportunity to extract statistical
trends for the interfaces of protein complexes (Ansari and Helms,
2005; Ofran and Rest, 2003; Ponstingl et al., 2000). Such statistics
have been used, e. g. for improving predictive docking (Madaoui and
Guerois, 2008; Smith and Sternberg, 2002). In the work of (Mintseris
and Weng, 2005), it was shown that protein interfaces are indeed
under selection that can be traced by a CM approach. In that study,
a large set of heteromeric complexes was carefully compiled and
manually partitioned into transient and obligate interactions. The
authors found that the interfaces of transient complexes have very
little signal of CM, whereas obligate complexes show strong trends
of compensatory mutations.

In this study, our goal was to leverage the power of large
structural datasets and recent advances in efﬁcient modeling of
protein structures to focus exclusively on the co—adaptation resulting

from physical interaction. Thus, we set out to investigate from
so—called ‘ﬁrst principles’ the degree to which the energetic stability
of a natural protein—protein complex underlies the phenomenon of
the co—adaptability of its interface. Furthermore, our method enables
us to focus on those pairs that demonstrate strong potential for
co—adaptivity beyond a naive consideration of all pairs within spatial
proximity. On the other hand, since our analysis is performed using a
ﬁxed—backbone procedure and enumeration of pair—wise adaptivity
(Section 2), we do not expect to see many pairs of co—adapting
residues that are distant in the native structure.

We provide an unbiased view of a dataset of >200 protein
complexes consisting of both obligate and transient heterodimeric
complexes. In brief, we adopt a structural and physical energy—based
model, for which the lowest energy amino acid sequences (and their
side chain rotamers) occur with higher probability. In the past, this
model has been successfully employed to detect both the top 100
sequence predictions for protein design (Fromer and Yanover, 2009;
Fromer et al., 2010) and also the probability of assigning particular
amino acids at any residue (Fromer and Shifman, 2009). This
approach bypasses the need for evolutionary sequence alignments
(Kuipers et al., 2009); instead, the detailed 3D structure for each
complex is used to predict the Boltzmann distribution—weighted pair—
wise amino acid probabilities without sequence alignment—based
estimation of CM. As a measure of CM, we utilize the well—known
mutual information (MI) score (Dunn et al., 2008; Halperin et al.,
2006), which quantiﬁes to what degree the amino acid identities at a
speciﬁc residue increase our knowledge regarding the amino acids
at another residue in the partner protein. We measured the MI for all
pairs of positions in all protein—protein interfaces, and we ﬁnd that
naturally transient complexes possess greater relative capacity for
CM than naturally obligate complexes when modeled identically. In
addition, we analyzed a set of >50 homodimeric complexes and ﬁnd
that, despite having interface sizes similar to the obligate complexes,
they exhibit a large co—adaptive potential similar to that measured
for transient complexes.

2 METHODS
2.1 Datasets

Starting from the 327 non—redundant transient and obligate heterodimers in
the manually curated set of (Mintseris et al., 2007), we removed all obsolete
and retracted PDB entries. Considering only cases for which the dimers
had exactly two protein chains, we calculated the interface of the complex
to be those positions for which some atom is within 4A of an atom in
the other monomer. We removed from our analysis those complexes with
>100 residues on both sides of the interface, yielding 210 heterodimers in
total: 136 transient and 74 obligate complexes. Homodimers were retrieved
from the collection of 76 non—redundant homodimers (Ponstingl et al.,
2000). Applying the same ﬁltration steps as above, we obtained a set of
53 homodimers. The list of all 263 dimeric complexes and the protein
chains analyzed can be found at: http://www.protonet.cs.huji.ac.i1/obligate_
transient/complexes.txt.

2.2 Atomic modeling and calculation of probabilities

Each complex was modeled in one of two forms, either as (i) the native
structure of the dimeric complex or as (ii) two unbound monomers. To
obtain the unbound monomers, we simply separated the two sides of the
dimer so that they would not interact, but implicitly assumed that there
are no conformational changes that occur upon dissociation; this artiﬁcial
assumption was critical in providing an unbiased comparison between
the obligate and transient complexes since the obligate complexes cannot
naturally exist as unbound proteins. We then used these two states to compose
the modeling scenarios of interest. The ‘one—state’ (obligate—like) scenario
consisted of a single state of the dimer (Fig. 1b), whereas the ‘two—state’
(transient—like) scenario consisted of two uniformly weighted states: the
native dimer and the unbound monomers (Fig. 1a). Note that a uniform
weighting was chosen to model all complexes under the same hypothetical
two—state condition. For each structure, pair—wise energy calculations were
performed using the widely used Rosetta package for protein design
(Kuhlman and Baker, 2000), with a backbone—dependent rotamer library
(Dunbrack and Karplus, 1993). The interface positions were allowed to
mutate to all amino acids except cysteine, while all other positions in
the proteins were held ﬁxed to their native amino acid identities and

conformations, though the interactions of these ﬁxed residues were also
included in these calculations. This simplistic approach was adopted in order
to accommodate the unbiased modeling of all sizes of complexes (ranging
from 12 to 100 interfacial residues). For each design scenario (one— or
two—state), a corresponding probabilistic graphical model was constructed
(Fig. 1c), where nodes correspond to interface residues and the edges between
them consist of the Rosetta interactions between residues that assume
particular rotameric states. We employed the belief propagation algorithm
in order to calculate all pair—wise amino acid—amino acid probabilities for
each pair of interface positions in the two structures. The algorithm was run
until convergence, with a limit of 106 messages passed before termination.
When modeling the homodimeric complexes, we ‘linked’ each pair of
corresponding positions in the two monomers so that their amino acids would
necessarily be chosen consistently. See (Fromer and Yanover, 2009; Fromer
et 01., 2010) for full details on this algorithm for modeling proteins with
multiple structural states and the benchmarking of its success.

2.3 MI score

As formulated in Mintseris et 01. (2007), the MI for a pair of protein positions
is the information—theoretic relative entropy between the predicted pair—wise
distribution of amino acids and the product of their marginal probabilities.
That is, for position i in monomer A and position j in monomer B, their MI is:

20002000
P(AiaBj)
MI: P(A-,B-)log —
 ’ ’ 2100.9100?»

1 I

where P(A,-, Bj) denotes the probability of amino acids A,- and Bj at those
positions. The MI is bounded from below by 0, and the larger the value, the
more the two positions show inter—dependence in their amino acid choices.
For the belief propagation algorithm runs described above, we used a
stochastic noise level (temperature) of 0.51, which we have previously found
to yield reasonable results (Fromer et 01., 2010). As control simulations,
we used a very high temperature of 1.85, in order to obtain a per—complex
estimation of the background level of noisy MI values. For each complex,
we required that a signiﬁcant MI value be within the 3% highest values
of the control MI distribution for that complex modeled in the two—state
scenario. Pairs of positions with signiﬁcant MI values were those designated
as having a CM between them. Note that other temperatures and percentage
cutoffs yielded results quite similar to those shown here. The number of CM
predicted for each complex in each scenario can be found at http://www
.protonet.cs.huji.ac.il/obligate_transient/CM_ratios.txt.

2.4 Evolutionary proﬁles

Evolutionary proﬁles were extracted from the HSSP (homology—derived
secondary structure of proteins) database, as described previously
(Fromer et 01., 2010) and plotted using the WebLogo application
(weblogo.berkeley.edu).

3 RESULTS

For each particular protein—protein complex, we modeled it in two
alternative scenarios. In the two—state scenario (Fig. 1a), the two
proteins can either be in their native dimeric complex or as unbound
monomers, where these two states are weighted uniformly. In the
one—state scenario (Fig. 1b), the two proteins are only allowed to
exist in a single state as a bound dimer. The motivation behind
these alternative scenarios is to model ‘obligate—like’ behavior as
one—state, where the two proteins are always in complex; on the
other hand, ‘transient—like’ behavior requires that the proteins be
physically stable both in complex and as isolated monomers. Our
goal was to analyze the consequences of modeling each complex in

both the one— and two—state scenarios and compare these analyses
between the obligate and transient complexes.

To model the interface of a particular pair of proteins in
either scenario, the structures of all states are simulated using
a probabilistic graphical model. In the model (Fig. 1c), nodes
correspond to interface residues and the edges between them consist
of pseudo—physical atomic interaction energies. We employ the
belief propagation algorithm to calculate all pair—wise amino acid—
amino probabilities (Fromer and Yanover, 2008; Fromer et 01.,
2010), from which we determine if each particular pair exhibits
CM (Fig. 1d) by calculating the MI score, where higher MI values
correspond to larger degrees of correlated variability between the
positions (for full details, see Section 2).

As was previously observed by us (Fromer and Yanover, 2009;
Fromer et 01., 2010) and others (Mandell and Kortemme, 2009),
there are many cases for which standard, off—the—shelf all—purpose
protein design calculations fail. Indeed, we found here that the
design procedure often over—predicts certain amino acids, such as
serine (S), threonine (T) and glycine (G). Nevertheless, the unbiased
simulation of over 200 protein complexes comprising >150 000
designed inter—molecular pairs of positions allowed us to overcome
this shortcoming, obtaining an abundance of high level information
that is both consistent and statistically signiﬁcant.

In our analysis, we studied a total of 210 non—redundant
heterodimeric complexes: 136 naturally transient complexes and 74
naturally obligate complexes. For each such complex, the interface
positions were deﬁned as those in contact with positions in the
opposing protein. For illustration, we consider PDB code 1KZY
as an example of a transient complex (Fig. 2). 1KZY is the naturally
transient heteromer of tumor suppressor p53 complexed with the
tandem BRCT region of p53—binding protein 1 (5 3BP1) (J 00 61611.,
2002). The 3D structure is composed of two p53 chains and two
53BP1 chains. We modeled the interface between one of each of
these protein chains (1KZY, chains A and C). This complex is of
special interest as residues of the p53 DNA—binding surface are often
mutated in cancer cells. Past analysis of experimental mutations has
contributed to the estimation of the conservation levels and features
of the interface (J 00 et 01., 2002).

Figure 2 shows the evolutionary proﬁle (HSSP) for each of the
positions in 1KZY, as well as the designed proﬁles in the one—
and two—state scenarios. The number of CM increases from the
modeling of the two—state scenario to the one—state scenario (from
6 to 10). Speciﬁcally, we observe that CM pairs found in the two—
state scenario are almost always present in the one—state scenario
as well, albeit with higher MI values (gray arrows). And, there are
new CM not observed in the two—state scenario, which appear only
in the one—state scenario (blue arrows). In addition, several general
trends for the interface residues can be drawn from this example and
others: (i) sequences predicted by computational ﬁxed—backbone
design are only moderately similar to natural sequences, with
sequence identity remaining at ~30% (Kuhlman and Baker, 2000);
(ii) furthermore, the evolutionary proﬁle is often signiﬁcantly less
diverse than the mutational proﬁles derived from the computational
design approach, with only a few of the designed interface positions
remaining highly conserved; (iii) an interface that is naturally rich
in charged residues often retains its charged nature, although the
positions at which speciﬁc amino acids appear are not always
conserved; (iv) the number of glycine and serine, and to a lesser
extent threonine, tends to increase relative to the HSSP proﬁle

Fig. 2. Case study examples of CMs in the protein—protein interface
of the p53—53BP1 complex. The total number of residues modeled and
the relevant PDB identiﬁers are as indicated. The evolutionary positional
sequence proﬁles (HSSP), as well as the predicted proﬁles for the two— and
one—state scenarios, are shown. Representative examples of the predicted
inter—molecular CM are demonstrated, where CM present in both the two—
and one—state scenarios are depicted in gray, and those unique to the one—state
scenario are depicted in blue. In this example, there are six CM pairs in the
two—state scenario and 10 CM pairs in the one—state scenario.

(see examples, Supplementary Fig. Sl). Note that similar trends,
albeit with different intensities, were found in many of the 210
complexes studied here, irrespective of the number of interface
residues that were included in the design procedure.

As was similarly observed in Mintseris and Weng (2003), we
ﬁnd that the size of the interface in obligate dimers is signiﬁcantly
greater than in transient dimers (Fig. 3a). As illustrated (Fig. 2),
we modeled the interface of each such complex in both the two—
and one—state scenarios and counted the number of signiﬁcant CM
predicted in each scenario (Fig. 3b). To determine which CMs are
signiﬁcant for each complex, we considered only those with MI
values in the high end of the distribution for a control simulation
(see Section 2). Not surprisingly, due to the larger number of pairs
of positions available to be potentially correlated in the naturally
obligate complexes (Fig. 3b, bottom), they exhibit larger absolute
numbers of CM than transient complexes (top). Also, for each
category of natural complex, it was expected that there would be
signiﬁcant increases in the number of CM between the two— and
one—state models of the same complex (Fig. 3b, rightward shift of
gray bars to black bars). However, as we will see below, the degree
of this shift is signiﬁcantly different for the naturally transient and
naturally obligate complexes.

Since not all possible pairs of positions across a particular
interface are likely to have physically induced CM between them
(e.g. distant residues), we accounted for this by considering, for
each complex, only the number of pairs falling within the maximal
distance for which any signiﬁcant CM was observed (Fig. 3c).

We denoted the size of this smaller set of pairs as the ‘effective
interface size’. Still, these effective interface sizes show the same
trend of larger interfaces for the obligate complexes than for the
transient complexes. Next, we used these effective interface sizes
to normalize the absolute numbers of CM predicted for each
complex. When analyzing these normalized CM rates, the statistical
differences between the transient and obligate complexes were
eliminated (Fig. 3d). That is, when considering a protein in either
of the two— (gray) or one—state (black) scenarios, the distinction
between the naturally transient (top) and naturally obligate (bottom)
complexes was insigniﬁcant (unpaired t—test, P=0.26 and 0.50,
for the two—state and one—state models, respectively). One of the
main results from Mintseris and colleagues (Mintseris and Weng,
2005) is that obligate interfaces exhibit much higher degrees of
CM than transient interfaces. Here, we also ﬁnd there to be a
large gap between the (normalized) number of CM for transient
complexes modeled in the two—state scenario (Fig. 3d, top, gray
bars) and for obligate complexes modeled in the one—state scenario
(Fig. 3d, bottom, black bars). This difference, between obligate
and transient complexes modeled in their natural scenarios (i.e.
obligate complex in one—state model, and transient complex in two—
state model), is extremely signiﬁcant (P < 10—30). Expectedly, this
trend is even stronger when comparing absolute numbers of CM
(Fig. 3b).

Overall, we conclude that our modeling of the two— and one—state
scenarios for both transient and obligate complexes is quite similar
(Fig. 3d) and thus unbiased. Nevertheless, when we calculated
the ratio of CM in the one—state scenario to the CM in the two—
state scenario, individually for each complex, and compared the
transient and obligate datasets (Fig. 4a), we found the transient
complexes to have signiﬁcantly greater increases in CM (P = 0.004).
From this result, we postulate that the interfaces of naturally
transient complexes have a substantial but untapped potential for
compensatory mutations and adaptability. This capacity could be
activated if the partner proteins were permitted to be ‘unnaturally’
highly optimized for their dimeric interaction, to the exclusion of
their monomeric forms (and possibly other interactions).

To test whether this observation is indeed a property of the
interface, or the byproduct of a genuine difference in the stability
and adaptability of the proteins as a whole, we performed the same
calculations for pairs of positions on the same side of each interface
(intra—molecular CM, Fig. 4b). For the intra—molecular CM, we
found only a much lesser degree of difference in this ratio for
the transient and obligate complexes (P 20.054). On the one hand,
this may be expected since the interface positions were speciﬁcally
chosen as those capable of inter—molecular interaction; nonetheless,
since these ratios are normalized by the number of CM in the two—
state scenarios (also expected to be lower for intra—molecular pairs),
this phenomenon cannot easily be explained away.

Next, we considered a set of 53 non—redundant homodimeric
proteins and subjected them to the same simulations, of either two—
or one—state scenarios. Note that we constructed these protein design
calculations such that each position in each monomer would choose
only the same amino acid as the corresponding position in the
second monomer, thus properly simulating a homodimeric protein.
Table 1 shows a summary of the results for all three categories
of complexes. We see that the homodimers have interface sizes
signiﬁcantly larger than those of the transient complexes, but rather
similar to the naturally obligate complexes. The same is true for

the absolute numbers of CM when modeled in either the two- or
one-state scenarios, where the homodimers resemble the obligate
heterodimers. Nevertheless, when considering the ratios between
CM in the one-state scenario to the CM in the two-state scenario,
the homodimers are different from the obligate complexes and
far more similar to the transient ones. Thus, both the transient
heterodimers and the homodimers have a similarly large capacity for
co-adaptibility of their interfaces, which is intrinsically lacking in the
structures of the obligate heterodimers. Of interest, the surprisingly
strong CM potential in homodimers could be explained simply by the
structural identity of the two monomers, as was previously argued
regarding the self-afﬁnity of protein structures (Pereira—Leal et 01.,
2007).

Co-adaptive potential of protein complexes

 

4 DISCUSSION

The main ﬁnding of this article is that the interaction interface of
obligate protein—protein heterodimers has signiﬁcantly less potential
for co—optimization across the complex than that of transient
heterodimers (and homodimers). We hypothesize that this may
derive from the fact that evolutionary processes have selected for
transient interfaces with structures that have consistently maintained
their ability to adapt as new partners are added to their binding
repertoire (and existing partners are removed). Indeed, the energetic
consideration of protein interfaces in determining their speciﬁcity
(Carbonell et 01., 2009; Fromer and Shifman, 2009; Fromer and
Yanover, 2009) has provided insight into the participation of these
proteins in rich interactions with multiple partners and in networks
in general (Tyagi et 01., 2009).

We propose that the ‘unused’ potential for compensatory
mutations observed in transient interfaces does not derive solely
from the fact that these two proteins are not always found together
(Tyagi et 01., 2009). If this were the case, then we would expect
that modeling a transient complex in the one—state scenario would
not yield a larger relative increase in CM than when performing
the same procedure for obligate complexes (Fig. 4a). Thus, we
hypothesize that the increased concerted capacity for adaptation
present in transient dimers is an intrinsic requirement of the
structures of such interfaces—e.g. so that they possess the means
to dynamically adapt to new interactions. This greater potential for
pair—wise adaptability across transient interfaces is also consistent
with previous research, where it was found that transient complexes
have greater optimization for electrostatic stability (charge pairing)
across the interface (Brock et 01., 2007).

Moreover, we have shown that the properties of the interfaces of
obligate and transient complexes do not extend to the entire proteins.
We found that other properties of the complexes, such as intra—
molecular CM modeling (Fig. 4b), the absolute size of the protein
dimers, and the number of additional chains present in the solved 3D
structures are not correlated with the properties of the ‘coadaptive
potential’. Previously, in a study on protein complexes resulting
from duplication events in yeast, CM signals could not be detected
(Hakes et 01., 2007). On the other hand, we argue that by using
a protein set that covers >260 complexes (including homodimers)
from a broad range of environmental and phylogenetic contexts, we
recover a statistically robust signal of potential biophysical CM for
protein interfaces (Table 1).

Here, we also performed a study of protein homodimers (obligate
and transient). While the global interface properties (size) resemble
the obligate set, the CM properties resemble that of protein
complexes that are transient in nature. The evolution of a homodimer
is often associated with a large and extended interface, mainly for
the purpose of geometric complementarity (Lukatsky et 01., 2007).
Therefore, we ﬁnd it interesting that the co—adaptive potential is
still strong enough for multiple mutations to occur (experimentally
or by computational design) without forfeiting energetic stability
(Table 1).

In summary, we note that several high—level principles have
been proposed for the evolution of structurally functional protein
complexes: those that are obligate or transient (this study), having
multiple partners (Fromer and Shifman, 2009; Fromer and Yanover,
2009; Humphris and Kortemme, 2007) and maintaining partners
from a similar superfamin or fold (Lukatsky et 01., 2007). It is an

intriguing possibility that the ‘transient—like’ nature of homodimers
and their predicted adaptability to mutations may also underlie the
evolution of heterodimers that share the same fold (Pereira—Leal
et 01., 2007).

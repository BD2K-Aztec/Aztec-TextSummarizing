ABSTRACT

Summary: G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) comprise the
largest family of integral membrane proteins. They are the most
important class of drug targets. While there exist crystal structures
for only a very few GPCR sequences, numerous experiments have
been performed on GPCRs to identify the critical residues and
motifs. GPCRRD database is designed to systematically collect all
experimental restraints (including residue orientation, contact and
distance maps) available from the literature and primary GPCR
resources using an automated text mining algorithm combined with
manual validation, with the purpose of assisting GPCR 3D structure
modeling and function annotation. The current dataset contains
thousands of spatial restraints from mutagenesis, disulfide mapping
distances, electron cryo-microscopy and Fourier-transform infrared
spectroscopy experiments.

1 INTRODUCTION

G-protein—coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family of
membrane proteins and mediate most cellular responses to hormones
and neurotransmitters, as well as being responsible for Vision,
olfaction and taste (Rosenbaum et al., 2009). Many diseases involve
the malfunction of these receptors, making them important drug
targets. While knowledge of a protein’s structure furnishes important
information for understanding its function and drug design (Skolnick
et al., 2000), the experimental determination of the 3D structure
of GPCR membrane proteins has proved to be very difﬁcult. Only
four GPCR structures from human have been solved so far: B2-
adrenergic (Rosenbaum et al., 2007), A2A adenosine (J aakola et al.,
2008), CXCR4 and Dopamine D3 (to be released). Fortunately,
computer-based methods for predicting the 3D structure of a protein
from its amino acid sequence have been increasingly successful
as demonstrated by the recent CASP experiments (Moult et al.,
2009). The structure models for all 907 registered GPCRs in the
human genome were recently generated using a threading-assembly
reﬁnement method (TASSER; Zhang et al., 2006). About 820
GPCRs are anticipated to have correct topology and transmembrane

helix arrangement. Nevertheless, great cautions are needed when
utilizing the homology-based models for detail structural and
functional annotations since helix kinks and extracellular loops
are often different in different receptors. Modeling the subtle
distinctions, which is essential for ligand docking and screening,
remains a major challenge as highlighted by the recent blind GPCR
Dock experiment (Michino et al., 2009).

While there exist crystal structures for only a very few GPCR
sequences, numerous experiments have been performed on GPCRs
to identify the critical residues and motifs. The information can be of
important use to the structure and function modeling of the GPCR
molecules. For example, the coherent activation and inactivation
of residues in mutagenesis experiments usually indicate that the
residues are spatially neighbors because they are binding to the
common ligands (Becker et al., 2003; Du et al., 1997; Shacham
et al., 2004; Shi and J aVitch, 2002). The orientation of mutated
functional residues is usually towards inside of the seven-helix
bundle (Schushan et al., 2010). Thus, speciﬁc contacts or distance
maps and residue orientations can be derived from the experimental
data which can be used as restraints to guide the protein structure
modeling simulations (Roy et al., 2010; Sali and Blundell, 1993;
Zhang et al., 2003); this is especially helpful for the modeling of
the structurally variant regions that cannot be directly transferred
by homology inference (Paiva et al., 2006). GPCRRD is designed
to systematically collect all available restraints derived from the
experimental data scattered in the literature and GPCR-related
databases using an automated text mining algorithm combined
with manual validation, with the purpose of assisting GPCR 3D
structure modeling and function annotation. The GPCRRD database
is freely accessible. The database is updated automatically once
every 2 weeks.

2 METHODS

GPCRRD consists of three steps of primary data collection, restraints
derivation and data validation. A detailed description of the procedures is
provided in the Supplementary Material. Here, we outline the major steps.

Experimental data are extracted from literature and other online databases
using an automated procedure. Documents are ﬁrst retrieved from the
Medline database using the PubMed query system (Schuler, et al., 1996).
Medline abstracts are used when full texts are not available. Pattern matching
with regular expressions was used to identify point mutation data (see
Equation 81). We then combined these data with those from the primary
sources (GPCRDB; Horn et al., 2003, UniProt; Yip et al., 2008, EMBL;
Kanz et al., 2005, TinyGRAP; Beukers et al., 1999) and the redundant entries
were removed.

Three different ﬁlters were applied to validate the experimental
information. First, we applied a sequence ﬁlter to check whether the wild-
type amino acids in the extracted point mutations are found at the indicated
positions in the corresponding sequences. Secondly, we used a function
ﬁlter to ﬁnd the function related mutation. When the residue number of
the mutation and the function-related words, such as ability, mediate, select,
agonist, antagonist or binding, etc. occur in the same sentence and there is no
‘not’, we consider this mutation as functional mutation. Finally, we manually
validated those data that do not belong to the two categories. Electron
microscopy, neutron diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy
(FTIR), disulﬁde bridge and X-ray data are collected and validated from
the literature and from the original sources.

Three types of restraints are derived: residue orientation, side-chain
contacts and distance map. To derive the residue orientation restraints, we
ﬁrst predict the transmembrane helices using TMHMM 2.0 (Krogh et al.,
2001). Based on the assumption that the orientation of mutated functional
residues is towards inside of the seven-helix bundle (Schushan et al., 2010;
Shacham et al., 2004), the orientation restraint of mutation data can be
obtained as showed in Supplementary Figures S2 and S3. If we deﬁne a
plane OaObOc, which is perpendicular to the transmembrane helix TM},
and passing through the a-carbon atom of a query residue, we can have three
points 0a, 0;, and 0c, which are the intersections of plane 0a 0;, 0c and three
axis of the neighboring transmembrane helices. These three points provide
graphical representation of the lower and upper limits of the orientation
restraint. The restraints of FTIR data can be generated in the same way.

For the disulﬁde bridge, we generated distance restraints according
to geometry of disulﬁde bond. The 2D electron density maps of
electron microscopy and neutron diffraction can be converted into 2D
position restraints in the membrane surface plane. To generate residue
contact restraints, we mainly consider the pair-wise mutagenesis and the
agonist/antagonist binding data since the side-chains of residues binding to
small common ligand are usually in a contact distance (Becker et al., 2003;
Du et al., 1997; Shi and J avitch, 2002). Most of these data collections require
manual checking and reading of the primary literatures.

3 RESULTS

The GPCRRD currently contains 10 electron microscopy, 2 neutron
diffraction, 5588 functional site-directed mutagenesis, 16 FTIR, 38
disulﬁde bridge and 15 X-ray data. The Search page allows users
to specify GPCRs of interest. A basic query system is available to
search GPCRRD entries using SWISS-PROT identiﬁers or protein
names. Another way to access the data is to browse lists of all the
data in the database. An illustration plot, which is generated with the
Graph Visualization Software-Graphviz, is used to represent and
combine GPCR sequence and experimental data information. For
each GPCR, a pointer is available to access remote information.
This is done automatically by reading the SWISS-PROT entries and
querying other remote resources. For each entry, cross-links to the
original articles and other resources e. g. GPCRDB; Horn et al., 2003
and GPCR-OKB; KhelashVili et al., 2010 are provided.

4 CONCLUSION

The main purpose of GPCRRD is to automatically retrieve and
update experimental information for GPCR 3D structure modeling
and function annotation. Although several GPCR databases have
been developed, useful information for GPCR 3D modeling

cannot be directly obtained from these sources. For example,
GPCRDB has general sequence and family data of GPCRs and
TinyGRAP collects mutations but both do not provide the residue-
level structural information. GPCRRD is to our knowledge the
ﬁrst structure-oriented database that systematically collects GPCR
spatial restraints from primary experimental resources assisted by
manual curation. The use of the GPCRRD to guide I—TASSER
(Roy et al., 2010) for high-resolution GPCR structure and function
modeling is under progress.

Abstract

Summary: Ability to generate large RNA-Seq datasets created a demand for both de novo and ref-
erence-based transcriptome assemblers. However, while many transcriptome assemblers are now
available, there is still no unified quality assessment tool for RNA-Seq assemblies. We present
rnaQUAST—a tool for evaluating RNA-Seq assembly quality and benchmarking transcriptome as-
semblers using reference genome and gene database. rnaQUAST calculates various metrics that
demonstrate completeness and correctness levels of the assembled transcripts, and outputs them

in a user-friendly report.

Availability and Implementation: rnaQUAST is implemented in Python and is freely available at

Introduction

Next-generation sequencing technologies have raised a challenging
problems of de novo genome and transcriptome assembly from short
reads. As a result, multiple assembly tools were developed in the last
decade. Even though most papers describing novel assembly
approaches provide benchmarking of various tools, no unified meth-
ods for assessing assembly quality were developed until recently.
While multiple tools for both reference-based and reference-free
genome assembly evaluation were developed (Clark et al., 2013;
Gurevich et al., 2013; Hunt et al., 2013; Salzberg et al., 2011) and
later used in various genomic studies (Coil et al., 2014; Howison
et al., 2013; Magoc et al., 2013; Zimin et al., 2013), no tool have
set a standard for assessing quality of transcriptome assemblies.
Although several studies provided evaluation methods (Li et al.,
2014; O’Neil and Emrich, 2013; Simao et al., 2015) or performed
independent benchmarks of RNA-Seq assemblers (Martin and

Wang, 2011; Mundry et al., 2012; Steijger et al., 2013), in papers
describing novel transcriptome assembly software the resulting tran-
scripts were evaluated using different in-house methods (Grabherr
et al., 2011; Peng et al., 2013; Robertson et al., 2010; Xie et al.,
2014), therefore making it difficult to compare the results across
various publications.

We present rnaQUAST—a quality assessment tool for tran-
scriptome assemblies, which utilizes reference genome and gene
database. rnaQUAST takes assembled transcripts as an input and
maps them to the reference genome using either BLAT (Kent,
2002) or GMAP (Wu and Watanabe, 2005). By comparing the re-
sulting alignments with the gene database, rnaQUAST calculates
various statistics and generates a summary report. Below we de-
scribe methods implemented in rnaQUAST, present an example of
summary report and compare rnaQUAST with DETONATE soft-
ware (Li et al., 2014).

2 Methods

2.1 rnaQUAST pipeline

To evaluate quality of the assembled transcripts, rnaQUAST takes a
reference genome in FASTA format and optionally its gene database
in GFF/GTF format. A user can provide either a FASTA file with
transcripts, which will be aligned to the given reference genome
using GMAP (Wu and Watanabe, 2005) or BLAT (Kent, 2002) (can
be selected by the user), or alternatively align transcripts to the refer-
ence genome using software of his choice (e.g. Splign (Kapustin
et al., 2008)) and provide alignments in PSL format. The alignments
are analyzed to calculate simple metrics and then are matched
against the isoforms from the gene database in order to obtain statis-
tics that represent completeness and correctness levels of the assem-
bly. In addition, rnaQUAST is capable of estimating gene database
coverage by raw reads using STAR (Dobin et al., 2013) or TopHat2
(Kim et al., 2013). For de novo quality assessment when reference
genome and gene database are unavailable, the transcripts are ana-
lyzed using BUSCO (Simao et al., 2015) and GeneMarkS-T (Tang
et al., 2015 ). To compare several transcriptome assemblies,
rnaQUAST is capable of taking multiple FASTA (or PSL) files as an
input.

2.2 Metrics and alignment analysis

rnaQUAST calculates various metrics without using alignment in-
formation, e.g. length distribution and N50 of the assembled tran-
scripts. Additionally, rnaQUAST computes the following statistics
for the gene database: the total number of genes and isoforms, iso-
form and exon length distribution, average number of exons per
gene, etc.

To analyze transcripts’ alignments, rnaQUAST firstly filters out
short partial alignments (shorter than a user-defined threshold, de-
fault value is 50 bp). Such short alignments are typically caused by
genomic repeats and thus are ignored. Afterwards, rnaQUAST se-
lects the best-scored spliced alignment for each transcript. If a
transcript has more than one alignment with the highest score, it is
reported as multiply aligned. Otherwise, it is considered to be
uniquely aligned. If the best-scored alignment is discordant (e.g. the
transcript has partial alignments that are either mapped to different
strands or to different chromosomes) the transcript is classified
as misassembled (see the Supplementary Material for the details).
Transcripts without misassemblies are analyzed to calculate such
metrics as average transcript alignment fraction and mismatch rate.

For the simplicity of explanation, transcript is further referred to
as a sequence generated by the assembler and isoform denotes a se-
quence from the gene database. rnaQUAST matches best-scored
alignments of non-misassembled transcripts to the isoforms’ coord-
inates and analyzes them to estimate how well the isoforms are cov-
ered by the assembly. rnaQUAST computes such metrics as database
coverage (the total number of covered bases of all isoforms divided
by the total length of all isoforms) and the number of 50%/95%-
assembled isoforms. An isoform is considered to be x%-assembled if
it has at least x% covered by a single transcript. Vice versa, to evalu-
ate how well the assembled transcripts are covered by the isoforms,
rnaQUAST estimates the number of unannotated transcripts (that
align to the genome, but do not match to any isoform) and the num-
ber of 5 0%/95 %-matched transcripts (that have corresponding frac-
tion mapped to an isoform). Indeed, the thresholds described above
(50% and 95%) can be varied by the user. Complete list of metrics
reported by rnaQUAST is described in the user manual, available at
http://bioinf.spbau.ru/en/rnaquast.

3 Results

In this section we demonstrate assembly quality metrics calculated
by rnaQUAST and compare them with scores computed by REF-
EVAL and RSEM-EVAL from DETONATE software package ver-
sion 1.10 (Li et al., 2014). To perform the comparison we assembled
M. musculus RNA-Seq paired-end library using the following tran-
scriptome assemblers: Trans-ABySS 1.5.3 (Robertson et al., 2010),
IDBA-tran 1.1.1 (Peng et al., 2013), SOAPdenovo-Trans 1.03
(Xie et al., 2014) and Trinity 2.1.1 (Grabherr et al., 2011). IDBA-
tran and Trinity were run with the default parameters
(k = 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 for IDBA-tran and k =25 for Trinity). As for
Trans-ABySS and SOAPdenovo-Trans, we ran both tools using vari-
ous k-mer lengths and selected the best assemblies for the compari-
son. We used the number of 95 %-assembled isoforms, number of
misassemblies and database coverage reported by rnaQUAST as the
main criteria for selecting optimal assemblies. We also included con-
tigs produced by SPAdes 3.6.1 genome assembler (Bankevich et al.,
2012; Nurk et al., 2013), which was run in single-cell mode (due to
uneven coverage of RNA-Seq data) with the default k-mer lengths
(la 2 21, 33, 55). Although SPAdes was not designed as a transcrip-
tome assembler, it turned out to show decent results on RNA-Seq
data.

We included the most important metrics from the reports
produced by rnaQUAST and DETONATE and presented them in
Table 1. rnaQUAST was launched with the default parameters;
REF-EVAL and RSEM-EVAL were run as recommended in the user
manual (http://deweylab.biostat.wisc.edu/detonate/vignette.html).
Command lines that were used to run all tools are provided in the
Supplementary Material.

Although there is no direct connection between rnaQUAST met-
rics and scores reported by the DETONATE software (see Li et al.
(2014) for the details), Table 1 shows that they mostly have a good
correlation. To ease the comparison with DETONATE, we also
added the number of 99%-assembled isoforms, since REF-EVAL
uses the 99% threshold for calculating contig scores.

Table 1 demonstrates that Trans-ABySS assembly has the largest
number of 50%-assembled isoforms and the highest database per
nucleotide coverage, and at the same the highest contig recall value.
On the other hand, Trans-ABySS has the largest fraction of un-
aligned (10%) and unannotated (25%) transcripts, which correlates
with the lowest contig precision reported by REF-EVAL. IDBA-tran
assembly, conversely, has the highest fraction of 5 0%/95 %-matched
transcripts (76% and 82% respectively), but the lowest database
coverage, which correlates with the highest contig and nucleotide
precision, and rather low contig, nucleotide and k-mer recall values.
SOAPdenovo-Trans generates an accurate assembly in terms of
number of misassemblies, mismatch rate and nucleotide precision,
but its assembly appears to be rather fragmented (almost 77% of
transcripts are shorter than 500 bp, the smallest number of 50%/
95%/99%-assembled isoforms). Similarly, Trans-ABySS assembly
also contains a lot of short sequences—about 83% of assembled
transcripts are shorter than 500 bp.

Trinity and, surprisingly, SPAdes have relatively high database
coverage and recall metrics, and the same time assemble the largest
number of 95 %/99%-assembled isoforms. However, both tools
generate rather high number of misassembled contigs with SPAdes
having approximately twice more misassemblies than Trinity.
Elevated number of misassembled contigs in SPAdes assembly can
be explained by the fact that SPAdes is a genome assembler and has
no specific algorithm for detecting transcripts in the de Bruijn graph
during assembly.

M. musculus gene database (Waterston et al., 2002) contains 38924 genes
(22572 protein-coding) and 94545 isoforms (47394 protein-coding). In each
row the best values are indicated with bold italic. For the transcript metrics
(rows 3—9) we highlighted the best relative values i.e. divided by the total
number of transcripts in the corresponding assembly.

While Trinity fairly has the best RSEM-EVAL score, high k-mer
recall and k-mer compression score, IDBA-tran is the outsider ac-
cording to these metrics, which may be explained by the small abso-
lute number of transcripts matching to the isoforms and thus, lack
of genomic k-mers in the assembly. At the same time, both Trans-
ABySS and SOAPdenovo-Trans also have decent k-mer recall, k-mer
compression and RSEM-EVAL scores, but produce rather frag-
mented assemblies comparing to Trinity and SPAdes. Since se-
quence continuity is an important characteristic for the de novo
transcript reconstruction, such metrics as k-mer recall, KC score and
RSEM-EVAL score (which strongly correlates with k-mer scores (Li
et al., 2014)) do not provide the whole picture of the evaluated
assemblies.

Even though rnaQUAST metrics do not have a perfect correl-
ation with all DETONATE scores, it is important that both tools
provide similar assembly ranking. While DETONATE provides
quantitative assessment of the assembled transcripts by calculating
different scores, rnaQUAST computes large variety of metrics leav-
ing the decision for the user, which may prioritize metrics depending
on the goals of his particular project. More statistics calculated by
DETONATE and rnaQUAST on various RNA-Seq datasets

(including strand-specific), as well as examples of plots generated by
rnaQUAST are provided in the Supplementary Material.

ABSTRACT

Non-covalent residue—residue contacts drive the folding of proteins
and stabilize them. They may be local—Le. involve residues that are
close in sequence, or non-local. It has been suggested that, in most
proteins, local contacts drive protein folding by providing crucial con-
straints of the conformational space, thus allowing proteins to fold. We
compared residues that are involved in local contacts to residues that
are involved in non-local contacts and found that, in most proteins,
residues in non-local contacts are significantly more conserved evo-
lutionarily than residues in local contacts. Moreover, non-local con-
tacts are more structurally conserved: a contact between positions
that are distant in sequence is more likely to exist in many structural
homologues compared with a contact between positions that are
close in sequence. These results provide new insights into the mech-
anisms of protein folding and may allow for better prediction of critical
intra-chain contacts.

1 INTRODUCTION

The importance of local versus non-local contacts is debated: The
folding of a peptide chain into a biologically active 3D structure
is driven primarily by the non-covalent interactions between
atoms from different amino acids (Creighton, 1990; Dill et al.,
2008). Not all the non-covalent interactions in a protein are
equally consequential for folding and stabilization of the struc-
ture. Identifying the interactions that drive folding and distin-
guishing them from non-critical interactions is a key to
understanding protein folding. A common distinction that is
often mentioned in this context is between local interactions,
namely those that occur between residues that are adjacent in
sequence, and non-local ones. The relative importance of local
versus non-local interactions for protein folding and stability is
bitterly debated for >35 years. Experimental and theoretical ana-
lyses of their respective importance give conﬂicting results
(Ionescu and Matthews, 1999). An earlier study that was based
on computer simulation of models of proteins on a two dimen-
sional lattice concluded that non-local interactions are critical for

folding (Taketomi et al., 1975). Around the same time, however,
other studies relied on theoretical and experimental results to
propose that folding is determined primarily by local interactions
(Anfinsen and Scheraga, 1975). This view was later supported by
several studies that suggested that local interactions dominate
folding (Harrison and Durbin, 1985; Karplus and Weaver,
1976; Rooman et al., 1992; Wright et al., 1988). Other studies
used statistical mechanical models to suggest that the importance
of non-covalent interactions is deﬁned more by their physical
nature (e.g. hydrophobic versus electrostatic) than by the se-
quence separation of the participating residues (Dill, 1990;
Kaya and Chan, 2003). Notwithstanding, numerous studies
have continued to argue that the sequence separation is a rele-
vant feature for distinguishing between more and less important
interactions. With the growth of protein structure databases and
the advent of computational methods, more sophisticated ana-
lyses were applied to larger datasets. One computational analysis
determined that the contribution of local interactions to the sta-
bility of the native state is small (Govindarajan and Goldstein,
1995), while another study concluded that foldability of a
sequence is determined primarily by local interactions (Unger
and Moult, 1996). In several large scale analyses, the notion of
interaction was replaced by that of a contact, namely analysing
all pairs of residues that are close enough in space to allow for an
interaction between them.

Plaxco, Simons and Baker (Plaxco et al., 1998) linked the
distribution of local and non-local contacts to folding rate.
They used the relative contact order (CO), which is the average
sequence distance between all pairs of contacting residues in a
chain. Higher CO indicates more non-local contacts, while lower
CO indicates that more of the contacts are local. They analysed
the C0 of few dozen single domain proteins and concluded that
proteins with lower CO fold more rapidly than ones with higher
CO (Ivankov et al., 2003; Plaxco et al., 1998). A common inter-
pretation of these results is that the ratio of local to non-local
contacts in a protein determines the kinetics of folding. A recent
analysis suggested that local and non-local contacts have signifi-
cantly different effect on the folding rate (Zou and Ozkan, 2011).

Most of the above studies are based on an attempt to directly
assess the contributions of different interactions to folding based
on various energetic models, and in some cases on incidental
experimental analysis of a small set of proteins. The different
results may be ascribed, at least to some extent, to the difference
in the models and techniques used in the assessment. Here, we
propose to use the wealth of sequence and structure data to
tackle this question in a different way. Rather than attempting

to explicitly assess the energetic contribution of each type of
intermolecular interaction to the folding and stability of the
chain, we propose to indirectly assess their importance through
their evolutionary and structural conservation. We assume that
positions that form contacts that are more critical for folding and
stability of the proteins are likely to be more conserved. This
approach enables large scale analysis of all known structures
and does not require theoretical models and approximations
that may or may not faithfully represent the physical reality of
protein folding. We checked whether there are signiﬁcant differ-
ences in evolutionary conservation between local and non-local
contacts in the native structure of proteins. We found that in the
vast majority of proteins with known 3D structure, non-local
contacts are more conserved than local ones. Furthermore, the
average conservation of residues that are involved in non-local
interactions is signiﬁcantly higher than that of proteins involved
in local interactions. Analysis of the structural similarity between
homologous structures allowed us to assess the structure conser-
vation of individual residues. This was done by checking how
often the position of the residue is structurally aligned in struc-
tural homologues. Using a proper background, we were able to
show that residues that are involved in non-local contacts are
more likely to be structurally conserved compared with residues
that are involved in local contacts. Furthermore, the non-local
contacts themselves are more conserved than their local counter-
parts. These differences indicate that residues that are involved in
non-local contacts are less tolerant to substitutions and structural
changes than residues that are involved in local contacts.
Together, they offer a new perspective in the discussion about
the importance of local and non-local contacts to protein folding
and stability.

2 METHODS

Construction of datasets: The analysis was based on a non-redundant
set of PDB (Berman et al., 2000). The PDBselect-25% list (Griep and
Hobohm, 2010) was downloaded from http://bioinfo.tg.fh—giessen.de/
pdbselect/ (April 2009 version). This list contained 4423 different single
protein chains, each sharing no more than 25% sequence identity with
any of the other sequences. Only the X—ray structures were further used
for our analysis. The ﬁnal list contained 2983 chains.

Sequence alignment: For the analysis of evolutionary conservation,
we used the HSSP database (Dodge et al., 1998). HSSP ﬁles were
downloaded from the HSSP database (ftp://ftp.emb1—heidelberg.de/pub/
databases/protein_extras/hssp) (Schneider and Sander, 1996), and a list
containing 1912 PDB entries of all HSSP alignments with minimal length
of 100 amino acids and minimal size of 50 sequences was generated.
Within these alignments, the average pairwise sequence identity was
37% (:l:13%). We will refer to this list as PDB-Listl. This list was used
to construct single-chain sequence alignments based on their full HSSP
alignments. The HSSP alignments may contain more than one peptide
chain for each PDB entry, since it includes all the chains in the entry.
Thus, the size and length of the new single-chain alignments were
re-evaluated. The ﬁnal set of the HSSP-based alignments contained
1396 different alignments of single-chain proteins. The length distribution
of these alignments (using the length of the ‘master’ in each alignment) is
shown in Supplementary Figure S1. Within these alignments, the average
pairwise sequence identity was 42% (:l:12%).

Structure alignment: DALI database (Holm and Sander, 1998)
was taken from http://ekhidna.biocenter.helsinki.ﬁ/dali/downloads/
downloadhtml (updated for 5.11.09). Proteins from the corresponding

PDBselect-90% list that was used to build this version of DALI were
identiﬁed. The DALI-based structure alignments were generated for all
PDB entries included in PDB-Listl, by excluding from the original DALI
alignment structures corresponding to PDB entries not included in the
PDBselect-90% list. This ﬁltering restricted the level of redundancy in our
DALI-based structure alignments. Since structural data is scarcer than
sequence data, we did not require here that each alignment will contain
50 structures, but >85 % of these alignments contained >20 structures.

The ﬁnal set of DALI-based alignments contained only 1776 different
alignments owing to missing PDB structures or missing DALI informa-
tion. Note that these 1776 are not necessarily the same as the ones in the
HSSP-based set. For control purposes, additional alignment programs
like Mammoth (Ortiz et al., 2002) and CE (Shindyalov and Bourne,
1998) were used for a subset of the alignments.

Generation of local and non-local contact sets: All PDB entries that
were used to construct the sequence alignment and structure alignment
were analysed to determine the spatial distance and the sequence separ-
ation of all pairs of residues. For the sequence alignments, residues that
corresponded to positions that had >10% gaps in the HSSP sequence
alignments were not included in any of the contact sets. Two residues
were deﬁned to be in contact if the spatial distance between their respect-
ive Cg atoms (or CO, in the case of glycine) was 56A. Contacting residues
with sequence separation of 5—10 residues were deﬁned as local.
Contacting residues with sequence separation 220 residues were deﬁned
as non-local. Other contacts were not included in any set. To conﬁrm the
robustness of the results to the choice of sequence separation cut-offs, we
also constructed datasets where the local contacts were deﬁned as se-
quence separation of 4—8, 6—10 or 2—10 and non-local were deﬁned as
215. We also varied the contact cut-off from 6A to 6.5 A and 7A. In all
cases results remained highly signiﬁcant (see Supplemantary Material).
We removed alignments in which there were no contacts (either local or
non-local) for any of the sequence separation of distance cut-offs. Thus,
for example, Table 1 contains data about 1355 alignments.

Equal accessibility sets: Since the core of the protein is, on average,
more conserved than its surface (Bustamante et al., 2000; Choi et al.,
2006; Conant and Stadler, 2009; Franzosa and Xia, 2009; Goldman
et al., 1998; Overington et al., 1992), we generated local and non-local
contact sets with equal accessibility distributions, to avoid any biased due
to such effect. This was done both with absolute accessibility (in terms of
A2) and for relative accessibility (% of theoretical maximal accessibility).
First, we obtained the solvent accessibility value of each residue in the
dataset [for the DALI-based dataset, these values were calculated using
the DSSP program (Kabsch and Sander, 1983), and for the HSSP-based
dataset, they were taken from the HSSP ﬁles]. Then, the accessible surface
area was binned in intervals of lOAZ. E.g. all residues with solvent
accessible area that is <10 A2 were assigned an index accessibility of 1,

Non-local contacts more conserved than local ones

 

residues with accessibility that was 210 A2 and <20 A2 were assigned an
index accessibility of 2, and so forth. Then, all contacts were grouped
according to the pair of indices that describe the accessibility of the resi-
dues that form them. That is, all contacts that are formed between a
residue with accessible surface of 30—40 A2 and a residue with accessible
surface of 60—70 A2, belong to the same group. Finally, a set of local
contacts and a set of non-local contacts were equally sampled from all
groups by selecting N contacts from each such accessibility-deﬁned
group, with N deﬁned as:

Ni : min(Nlocal’ Niton—local) 
where i designates a speciﬁc accessibility group and Mom] and Nimwlowl
designate the number of local and non-local contacts in bin i, respectively.
Thus, we generated two sets of contacts with equal accessibility distribu-
tion. We also created as set of Equal accessibility—Equal neighbours
in which in each bin, contacts have both the same accessibility and the
same number of neighbours.

Calculation of sequence conservation scores: We used two evolutionary
conservation scores: (i) The Shannon-entropy score, E, and (ii) The con-
servation weight, CW (Sander and Schneider, 1991). The entropy E is
deﬁned as:

20
E0) = — 2pc) Iogzopoc) (2)
x21

where i is a given position in the HSSP multiple sequence alignment
(MSA), x is an amino acid type and p(x) is the frequency of that
amino acid at position i. This score can range from 0 for fully conserved
position to l for maximally variable ones.

The conservation weight CW is deﬁned as:

Npairs
Z szsim(Rik, Rn)
. k,l

2 Wk!
k, z

where iis a given position in the MSA, the sum runs over all the possible
pairs of sequences in the MSA, k and l (k 75 l). sim(R,-k,R,-,) is the similarity
between the residues located in the ith position in sequence k and l. The
similarity values are the normalized values of PAM250 matrix (Dayhoff
et al., 1978). wk, is the weight of a sequence pair which is deﬁned here as
the fraction of amino acid mismatches over the alignment length L:

1 L
W = 1 — Z Z 6(Rik, Rt) (4)

Where 6(Rik’ R”) = { 0 otherwise

This score ranges between 0 for residues that are not conserved and
1 for fully conserved residues.

For each protein in the dataset, we calculated the average of each
of the conservation scores (E and CW) for residues that are involved in
local contacts. Then we calculated these averages also for residues
that are involved in non-local contacts. One residue can be involved in
more than one contact, hence we reconsidered a residue for every add-
itional contact it has with another residue. Note that by this scheme,
a residue could be included both in the average for local interaction
and in the average for non-local interactions. Average conservation
was calculated separately for local contacts and for non-local contacts
for each protein.

Structure conservation scores: Structure conservation was evaluated
using two scores. The ﬁrst, faligned, deﬁned for a given pair of interacting
residues as:

Naligned

5
Ntotal ( )

faligned =

where Nahgned is the number of structures in the DALI structure align-
ment in which both residues are structurally aligned (i.e. there is no gap in
the corresponding position), and Ntotal is the number of all structures
in the DALI structure alignment for the protein under discussion.
The second score, foontacts, is deﬁned as:

Ncontacts 

fcontacts =
Ntotal

where Ncontacts is the number of structures in the DALI alignment in
which these two residues are in contact (i.e. their Cﬁ—Cﬁ are 56 A apart).

For each protein in the dataset, the average faligned and fcomacts values
were calculated separately for local and non-local contacts, and these
average values were compared. We deﬁned the Non-local Preference
measure (NLPaligned) as the percentage of proteins in a dataset in which
the average fahgned for non-local contacts is greater than for local contacts,
and in a similar way we deﬁned the NLPcontactS measure, which is the
percentage of proteins in a dataset in which the average fcomacts for
non-local contacts is greater than for local contacts.

Control set for structural conservation: Structural conservation of a pair
of residues can be the result of the conservation of an interaction between
them, but it can also be the result of the conservation of a structural
neighbourhood independent of their interaction. To distinguish between
these two possibilities, we deﬁned a set of pseudo-contacts that included
all pairs of residues whose spatial distance is 10—12A. The width of the
range was chosen to be 2 A similar to the range of real contacts, which are
in distance between 4A and 6A. Arguably, residues that are 10—12A
apart are not in any type of direct physical interaction, and this distance
has no particular signiﬁcance. Thus, this set can be used as a control for
real contacts. We will refer to this set as SMHZ. The number of local and
non-local pairs that were sampled from the control SMHZ set was equal to
the number of those used in the respective contact set of the same struc-
ture, and these samples were used to calculate both fcontacts scores for the
control set. It is important to note that the averaged scores calculated for
the local versus non-local sets or for contacts versus Squ are compar-
able owing to the fact that they were derived from the same sequence or
structure alignment and, thus, they share the same evolutionary back-
ground. Such comparison ﬁlters out the evolutionary noise and, there-
fore, its results are more reliable.

Comparing pseudo-contacts and real contacts: To compare pseudo-con-
tacts and real contacts for local and non-local contacts, we deﬁned the
following measures:

Aaligned = 

aligned _ N LP Zli'gned 

Where NLPflligned is the percentage of proteins in a dataset in which
the average faligned is greater for non-local contacts than for local contacts,
and NLPZZgned is the same measure for pseudo-contacts. Thus, if in most
proteins, non-local contacts are more structurally conserved than local
contacts, but this preference exists also in pseudo-contacts, then Aaligned
will be close to 0. Similarly, if in most proteins, local contacts are more
structurally conserved than non-local contacts, but this preference exists
also in pseudo-contacts, then Aaligned will also be close to 0. If, however,
in one of the groups (either local or non-local), there is a large discrep-
ancy between the structural conservation of real contacts and pseudo-
contacts, Aaﬁgned will be largely positive (if non-local contacts are more
conserved) or largely negative (if local contacts are more conserved).
Similarly, in order to assess the conservation of the actual contacts, we

between amino acids that are 5—10 residues apart. Non-local
contacts were deﬁned between amino acids that are 20 and
more residues apart. This range was selected to avoid most inter-
actions that occur within secondary structure elements. All data
presented in the main text are based on these deﬁnitions. The
supplementary material contains data for other cut-off values
that we have tried. Although the strength of the signal we
observed may slightly vary for different cut-off values, the
trend was robust to the choice of cut-off for all measures.

Figure 1 shows the mean entropy of residues plotted against
the sequence separation of the contacts in which they are
involved. The mean entropies of contacts at very low sequence
separation are much higher than the rest of the graph. The trend
remains not only when comparing local and non-local contacts
but also when comparing different non-local contacts. For
instance, looking at contacting residues that are between 20
and 40 positions apart, virtually all of them have a mean entropy
that is >0.39. However, 93% of the contacting residues that are
>40 positions apart have mean entropies that are <0.39.
Supplementary Figure S2 presents a similar plot for CW.

We also investigated the balance of local and non-local con-
servation within each protein. Table 1 compares the number (and
percentage) of proteins in which residues involved in local con-
tacts were, on average, more or less conversed than non-local
ones. For both metrics of evolutionary conservation (E and
CW), in a signiﬁcant majority of proteins, residues in non-local
contacts are more conserved than those involved in local ones.
These results have very signiﬁcant P—values (paired sign-test)
demonstrating the clear preference of conservation of residues

Fig. 1. Mean entropy versus sequence separation: The mean entropy
(y-axis) of all the residues that are in contact (Cﬁ distance of <6 A) for
a given sequence separation (x axis). The graph is based on 1238642
contacts. Dots represent mean entropy of all the contacts with the
same sequence separation. The smoothed line is based on a running
window of length 9. Note that the decrease in entropy continues through-
out the range of sequence separations: the entropy for sequence separ-
ation >20 is lower than for sequence separation <20, and the entropy for
sequence separation >40 is lower than sequence separation <40. The
analysis included all the consecutive distances from 1 to 84, for which
we have >1500 data points

involved in non-local contacts compared with residues involved
in local contacts. Supplementary Figure S3 presents histograms
of the difference between local and non-local values for Entropy
and CW, showing, again, higher conservation of non-local
contacts. Supplementary Table S3b shows that this is true for
different structural classes and is independent of secondary struc-
ture composition. We found no signiﬁcant differences between
the residue—residue preferences in local contacts and in non-local
contacts (see Supplementary Fig. S4).

Next, we wanted to check whether the contacts themselves,
rather than the residues involved in the contacts, are more
conserved in non-local versus local contacts. falign measures the
percentage of structures in the alignment in which the two con-
tacting residues are structurally aligned (i.e. there is no gap in the
structural alignment in either of these positions). fcontacts reﬂects
the fraction of structures in a structural alignment in which the
considered contact itself exists (i.e. the two corresponding resi-
dues in the aligned structures are in contact with each other).
We found that non-local contacts are more structurally con-
served than local contacts (P-value of 10‘36 and 10‘20 for fahgn
and fcomacts, respectively, Supplementary Figs S5 and S6).
However, since errors in structural alignments may build up as
sequence separation grows, it is not simple to compare the struc-
tural conservation of local contacts with that of non-local con-
tacts. Moreover, conservation of a contact may be the result
of the conservation of a structural neighbourhood independent
of their interaction. To control for these possible biases, we
used Aaﬁgned and Acomact (see Section 2), which measure to
what extent real non-local contacts are more conserved than
real local contacts, and compares this difference to the respective
difference between pseudo-contacts. If local contacts are indeed
more conserved, these measures should be negative. If there is no
difference, they should be close to 0, and if non-local contacts
are more conserved, it should be positive. Table 2 shows, for
different deﬁnitions of local and non-local contacts, that Aaligned
and Ammot have large positive value indicating that non-local
contacts are more structurally conserved (using the baseline of
pseudo-contacts) than local contacts. These results are based on
the Dali alignments; similar results were obtained for Mammoth
and CE alignments (data not shown).

Another way of looking at the data can be seen in Figure 2
where the fcontacts parameter of local (Fig. 2A) and non-local

Aah-gned and Acomact assess the tendency of contacts to exist in different structurally
similar proteins (see Section 2). If local contacts are always more conserved than
non-local contacts then both Aaligned and Aconmt should be equal to (— 100). If there
is no difference between local and non-local, then they should be 0. As seen in the
table, non-local contacts are more conserved regardless of the choice of cut-off for
local and non-local contacts.

Fig. 2. Structural conservation of real versus pseudo-contacts. Each blue dot represents one protein chain. On the X axis is the average structural
conservation score of real contacts (fcontacts) and on the Y axis is the average structural conservation score of pseudo-contacts (SMHZ). If there is no
structural conservation of real contacts, proteins should fall on or around the red line, which represents equal structural conservation of real and
pseudo-contacts. Structural conservation of contacts should result in more dots below the line (i.e. proteins in which real contacts are more conserved
than pseudo-contacts). The values were calculated for local (A) and non-local (B) pairwise interactions for all the 1774 DALI-based structure alignments.

The difference between real and pseudo-contacts was extremely signiﬁcant for non-local contacts (P—values< 1.0 X 10—

(Fig. 2B) pairwise interactions in SHHZ is plotted against the re-
spective parameter in the contacts set using the Dali set. For local
contacts, the structural conservation of real contacts is virtually
the same as that of pseudo-contacts. However, for non-local con-
tacts, real contacts are more conserved than pseudo-contacts in
almost all structures (P-value < 1.0 X 10‘275 paired sign test).
These results indicate that for local contacts, spatial distance be-
tween the residues tends to be maintained, possibly reﬂecting the
conservation of structural neighbourhood and not necessarily the
importance of the speciﬁc contact itself. In a striking contrast,
distances between residues that are far apart in the sequence do
not tend to be conserved unless there are in real contact.

4 DISCUSSION

Conceivably, the higher conservation of non-local contacts com-
pared with local ones may simply be the result of other, already
known, characteristics of protein structure. For example, it is
well established that buried residues tend to be more conserved
than exposed ones (Bustamante et al., 2000; Choi et al., 2006;
Conant and Stadler, 2009; Franzosa and Xia, 2009; Goldman
et al., 1998; Overington et al., 1992). Possibly, non-local contacts
may involve more buried residues, while local contacts may
occur more frequently between residues that are accessible to
solvent. If true, this may be reﬂected in the average conservation
of each of these groups of contacts.

However, when we calculated the correlation between the ac-
cessible surface area of the residues involved in contacts and their
entropy, we found a rather weak correlation coefﬁcient of 0.34. In
a more direct analysis, we created equal accessibility sets (see
Section 2) such that the local and non-local interactions set have
the same distributions of solvent accessibilities. In this compari-
son, the difference remained highly signiﬁcant, though smaller in
magnitude (P-values < 1.7 X 10‘5 for entropy, see Supplementary

275 paired sign test)

Table SlB). Using relative accessibility gave similar results
(Supplementary Table S 1C).

Another possible source for the difference may be the number
of spatial neighbours of each residue. Residues involved in
non-local contacts may be involved, on average, in more contacts
than other residues, and such ‘hubs’ may also be more conserved
than other residues. To control for this possible effect, we created
an Equal accessibility—Equal neighbours set (see Section 2).
Again, non-local contacts were signiﬁcantly more conserved
even when we controlled for number of spatial neighbours
(see Supplementary Table S2). We also checked whether the
differences we observed between local and non-local contacts
may stem from using multi-domain proteins, from using
the DALI structural alignment algorithm or from bias toward a
speciﬁc structural class of proteins. Although in some cases smal-
ler number of alignments reduced the statistical signiﬁcance, the
trend of greater structural conservation of non-local contacts re-
mained clear in all cases (see Supplementary Tables Sl—S3).

As an illustration we bring the example of non-ﬂuorescent
ﬂavoprotein (PDB lnfp). Figure 3 highlights in red residues
that participate in contacts that are highly structurally conserved
(i.e. high fcomacts) in this protein. The average fcontacts of all local
contact (i.e. between residues that are 5—12 positions apart) was
0.11, which is less than a half of the average for non-local con-
tacts (between residues that were >20 positions apart), which was
0.25. As can be clearly seen in Figure 3, most of the highly
conserved contacts are between residues that are distant in se-
quence (in this case, >20 residues apart), while only a few may be
considered local (<12 residues apart). It seems that the non-local
contacts stabilize interactions between helices and within sheets.
In both categories, some of the residues are buried and others are
exposed.

Thus, using a non-redundant version of all proteins with known
3D structure, we showed that non-local contacts are, on average,

Fig. 3. Residues in structurally highly conserved local and non-local contacts. We identiﬁed the residues that participate in the contacts with the highest
fcontacts in the non-ﬂuorescent ﬂavoprotein (PDB lnfp). These residues form the most structurally conserved contacts in the protein. On the right-hand
side we highlighted in red residues in local contacts and on the left-hand side residues in non-local contacts

more conserved both evolutionarily and structurally. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time that such differences have
been observed and statistically assessed. The difference between
these two classes of contacts can stem from a variety of structural
or evolutionary factors. One possible explanation may be that the
contribution of non-local contacts to the folding or to the stabil-
ization of the native structure is greater than that of local contacts.
This claim is consistent with the predictions made based on poly-
mer statistics that a longer polymer chain is less likely to have
contacts between its ends than shorter chains (Doi and
Edwards, 1988). Therefore, in order to ensure the existence of a
non-local contact, there might be a higher need to conserve the
residues providing such a contact. This hypothesis is supported by
several recent experimental observations that found that
non-local native interactions are being formed in very early
stages of the folding process (Felitsky et al., 2008; Orevi et al.,
2009). They are also consistent with the conjecture that formation
of such interactions in the early stages of folding reduce the con-
ﬁgurational entropy of the chain and consequently accelerates
folding. If true, these results may be useful in devising structure
prediction tools and in protein engineering.

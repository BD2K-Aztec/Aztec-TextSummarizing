Abstract

Summary: ChlA-PET is rapidly emerging as an important experimental approach to detect chroma-
tin long-range interactions at high resolution. Here, we present Model based Interaction Calling
from ChlA-PET data (MICC), an easy-to-use R package to detect chromatin interactions from ChlA-
PET sequencing data. By applying a Bayesian mixture model to systematically remove random li-
gation and random collision noise, MICC could identify chromatin interactions with a significantly

 

higher sensitivity than existing methods at the same false discovery rate.

1 Introduction

High-throughput sequencing technologies aiming to detect chroma-
tin interactions are rapidly developing these years. Among them,
ChIA-PET (Fullwood et al., 2009) can genome-widely detect chro-
matin interactions that are associated with the protein of interest. It
is suitable for studying physical interactions between regulatory
elements, such as enhancer—promoter interactions. However, ChIA-
PET experiment suffers from high levels of noises caused by chroma-
tin random collision events and random ligation in solution.
Therefore, it needs effective computational methods to process raw
ChIA-PET data.

Up to now, there are few tools in hand to deal with ChIA-PET
data. ChIA-PET tool (Li et al., 2010) is the first one freely available
to the public, which combines P-values from hyper-geometric test
and an arbitrary and strict threshold for no less than 3 Paired-end
tags (PETS) to identify chromatin interactions. However, this strat-
egy does not consider random collision noise, and the cut-off for
PET-count may result in losing some relatively weaker but non-
random interactions. Recently, another method called ChiaSig
(Paulsen et al., 2015 ) tries to take chromatin random collision events
into account. The authors showed an improvement than ChIA-PET
tool by comparing with 5C data. However, ChiaSig is much too

conservative, thus suffers from high false negative rate. Here we pre-
sent MICC, an easy-to-use R package to process ChIA-PET data. It
aims to detect chromatin interactions at a high sensitivity while con-
trolling false discovery rate (FDR) at a reasonable level. The input of
MICC is raw PET clusters derived from ChIA-PET data. The final
output of MICC includes: (i) a list of posterior probabilities that de-
scribe the PET clusters as true interaction clusters and (ii) the corres-
ponding FDR. MICC can always detect significantly more
interactions than ChIA-PET tool and ChiaSig at the same FDR on
different datasets. The interactions detected by MICC are also more
consistent between biological replicates.

2 Methods

Detailed description of MICC method could be found in supplemen-
tary methods. Here we brieﬂy describe the principles. We first used
self-ligation PETs to call protein binding peaks and set them as an-
chor regions. Then inter-ligation PETs linking anchor regions were
grouped as PET clusters. For the sake of simplicity, from here on,
the phrase PET mentioned later is only referred to inter-ligation
PET. To infer a PET cluster (A, B), where A and B are two anchor
regions linked by at least one PET, to be a True interaction PET

cluster (TiPC), a Random collision PET cluster (RcPC) or a Random
ligation PET cluster (RlPC), we used three types of features: (i)
PET-count CAB between anchor regions A and B, (ii) total PET-count
CA (63) in anchor region A (B) and (iii) genomic distance dAB be-
tween anchor regions A and B (61,43 2 +00 if A and B are in different
chromosomes). If (A, B) is an RlPC, CAB is modeled to follow a
hyper-geometric distribution (Li et al., 2010). If (A, B) is a TiPC or
RcPC, we modeled it as a discrete Pareto distribution, i.e. Zeta dis-
tribution (Jessen and Winter, 1935) since CAB follows power-law
when CAB is sufficiently large (6,4323) (Supplementary Fig. S1). The
parameters of the Zeta distributions depend on d AB (Supplementary
Fig. 52) and we set it as a quadratic fractional function. It is noticed
that log(cAcB) is significantly larger for reproducible PET 3+ clus-
ters between replicates than that of those non-reproducible ones
(Supplementary Fig. S3). Thus we used CA and 63 as features to esti-
mate the prior probability of an RcPC. The feature 61,43 is then used
to describe the prior probability for observing an RlPC to filter out
random ligation noise (Supplementary Fig. S4). The full model con-
sists of three components, each of which is the conditional probabil-
ity distribution of PET-count for TiPC, RcPC and RlPC,
respectively. The prior probability and parameters for each compo-
nent can be described by total PET-count in anchor regions and the
genomic distance between two anchors.

3 Application examples and comparison
with previous methods

We applied MICC on K562 P012 ChIA-PET data (Li et al., 2012).
First, we checked the performance to recover interactions detected
in higher-depth sequencing libraries from lower-depth sequencing
libraries between MICC and ChIA-PET tool (ChiaSig was not
included in this comparison as it detected much less interactions).
The lower-depth data were selected by randomly sampling 50%
PETs from each replicate for 100 times. For each higher-depth data,
interactions identified by both MICC and ChIA-PET tool were
defined as the total interaction set. As is shown in Figure 1A and
Supplementary Figure SS, top-ranked predictions by ChIA-PET tool
and MICC recovered similar amount of high-confidence inter-
actions, but MICC detected more true positives from weaker signals.
This suggests that MICC can give a more consistent performance be-
tween lower-depth and higher-depth sequencing libraries.

Next, the reproducibility between biological replicates was com-
pared among MICC, ChIA-PET tool and ChiaSig. We evaluated re-
producibility by overlapping top-ranked interactions from two

replicates for these methods. Inter-chromosomal PET clusters were
removed at first since ChiaSig could not deal with them. Again,
MICC shows the best performance, while reproducibility between
two replicates decreases very quickly for ChiaSig (Fig. 1B). These
observations suggest that MICC can remove ChIA-PET noises in a
more consistent way, thus improve the reproducibility between bio-
logical replicates.

Lastly, we made a further comparison between ChiaSig and
MICC by overlapping with 5 C results, since ChiaSig paper (Paulsen
et al., 2015) showed that the method gives more precise results than
ChIA-PET tool by comparing with 5 C data (Amartya et al., 2012).
Here PET clusters were derived from the original ChiaSig paper,
which mixed two replicates of KS 62 P012 ChIA-PET data. For both
methods, we used FDR 0.05 to call significant interactions. Among
267 MICC significant interactions that overlap with 5 C anchors at
both ends, 53 can be validated by SC significant interactions. For
ChiaSig, there is only 9 interactions can be validated by SC while
the number of ChiaSig significant interactions that overlap with 5 C
anchor regions at both ends is 41. The fraction of 5C validated inter-
actions is very similar between the two methods (P-value = 0.834),
but MICC can call significantly more interactions
(P-value =2.82e — 10) (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, we checked the sig-
nificance of MICC called PET 2-clusters (PET clusters with one or
two PETs) that overlap with 5C significant interactions. There are
24 MICC called significant interactions with PET-count less than 3
that can be validated by 5 C data. This number is significantly higher
than that of the randomly sampled PET 2-clusters (P-value = 0.002,
Supplementary Fig. S6). It suggests that many of MICC detected
weaker interactions are likely true interactions.

Comparisons on MCF7 ER ChIA-PET data (Fullwood et al.,
2009) also showed MICC gave the best performance.
(Supplementary Fig. S7, SS).

4 Discussion

We proposed a new method, MICC, to call significant chromatin
interactions from ChIA-PET data. Compared with ChIA-PET tool,
MICC recovered a significantly greater fraction of interactions de-
tected in higher-depth sequencing library using a much lower-depth
sequencing library. It also gives a more consistent ranking for the
PET clusters, thus can improve the reproducibility between experi-
mental replicates. By comparing with 5C data, we showed that
MICC can detect significantly more validated interactions than
ChiaSig. Besides, the interactions with low PET-count detected by

MICC have a significant fraction of overlapping with 5C data, sug-
gesting MICC is feasible to search for weak interactions. These fea-
tures make MICC superior over other existing tools especially when
processing ChIA-PET data with less sequencing depth.

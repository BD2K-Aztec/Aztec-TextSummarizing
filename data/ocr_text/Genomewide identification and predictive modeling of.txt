ABSTRACT

Motivation: Pre-mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation are essential
steps for 3/-end maturation and subsequent stability and degradation
of mRNAs. This process is highly controlled by cis-regulatory elements
surrounding the cleavage/polyadenylation sites (polyA sites), which
are frequently constrained by sequence content and position. More
than 50% of human transcripts have multiple functional polyA sites,
and the specific use of alternative polyA sites (APA) results in isoforms
with variable 3/-untranslated regions, thus potentially affecting gene
regulation. Elucidating the regulatory mechanisms underlying differen-
tial polyA preferences in multiple cell types has been hindered both by
the lack of suitable data on the precise location of cleavage sites, as
well as of appropriate tests for determining APAs with significant dif-
ferences across multiple libraries.

Results: We applied a tailored paired-end RNA-seq protocol to spe-
cifically probe the position of polyA sites in three human adult tissue
types. We specified a linear-effects regression model to identify
tissue-specific biases indicating regulated APA; the significance of
differences between tissue types was assessed by an appropriately
designed permutation test. This combination allowed to identify highly
specific subsets of APA events in the individual tissue types. Predictive
models successfully classified constitutive polyA sites from a biologic-
ally relevant background (auROC=99.6%), as well as tissue-specific
regulated sets from each other. We found that the main cis-regulatory
elements described for polyadenylation are a strong, and highly in-
formative, hallmark for constitutive sites only. Tissue-specific regu-
lated sites were found to contain other regulatory motifs, with the
canonical polyadenylation signal being nearly absent at brain-specific
polyA sites. Together, our results contribute to the understanding of
the diversity of post-transcriptional gene regulation.

1 INTRODUCTION

Almost all eukaryotic mRNAs undergo a post-transcriptional
processing step called polyadenylation, in which they acquire a
polyA tail at their 3’-end. After transcription, the 3’-most seg-
ment of the newly made RNA is cleaved off at speciﬁc sites

(polyA sites) by a set of RNA regulatory proteins, which is fol-
lowed by the synthesis of the polyA tail by the addition of ad-
enine (A) residues in a non-templated fashion (Andreassi and
Riccio, 2009). Around 90 protein factors regulate this process,
with CPSF (cleavage and polyadenylation speciﬁcity factor),
CstF (cleavage simulator factor), CFI (cleavage factor I), CFII
(cleavage factor II), PAP (polyA polymerase) and PABII (polyA
binding protein) playing a crucial role (Beaudoing et al., 2000; Ji
and Tian, 2009; Shi et al., 2009; Tian et al., 2005).

PolyA sites are essential for 3’-end maturation, stability and
degradation of mRNAs. Furthermore, polyadenylation deﬁnes
the extent of the 3’-untranslated region (3’-UTR) of mRNAs,
which spans from the stop codon up to the polyA tail and con-
tains many post-transcriptional regulatory sequence elements
such as microRNA (miRNA) target sites. In addition, alternative
polyadenylation (APA) events arise from the presence of more
than one particular functional cleavage/polyadenylation (polyA)
site. The speciﬁc use of different polyadenylation sites can play a
direct role in gene regulation. For instance, eliminating large
parts of a 3’-UTR by using the more proximal polyA site enables
a transcript to escape from miRNA regulation of its longer iso-
form. In proliferating cells, proximal polyA sites are therefore
favored over distal ones, resulting in the production of mRNAs
with shorter 3’-UTR and fewer miRNA-binding motifs (Ji and
Tian, 2009; Sandberg et al., 2008). APA can inﬂuence mRNA
nuclear export, cytoplasmic localization and non-miRNA—
mediated changes in mRNA stability and translational efﬁciency
(Majoros and Ohler, 2007; Mayr and Bartel, 2009; Moore, 2005).

As such, it is important to identify not just alternative but
speciﬁcally regulated alternative events, such as tissue-speciﬁc
APA. Based on earlier analysis of expressed sequence tags
(ESTs), over 50% of the human and more than 30% of mouse
genes were observed to have multiple polyadenylation sites,
which results in mRNA isoforms different in their 3’-UTR
and/or coding sequences (Tian et al., 2005). Initial studies on
ESTs and tiling microarrays also indicated a bias in the regula-
tion of polyA sites in certain human tissues (David et al., 2006;
Tian et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2005a).

The introduction of high-throughput sequencing technology
has vastly expanded the opportunities to explore APA. Recent
deep sequencing of mRNA populations from multiple tissue
types has shown that 86% of human genes exhibit variants due
to APA sites Wang et al., 2008). In addition, several protocols
relevant for studying polyadenylation have been developed.

Modelling of tissue-specific alternative polyadenylation

 

These protocols are designed to capture the 3’-end of mRNAs
using speciﬁc primers, then sequence these fragments using
second- and third-generation sequencing technologies (Jan
et al., 2010; Mangone et al., 2010; Ozsolak et al., 2010; Shepard
et al., 2011). However, with one exception (Derti et al., 2012),
these approaches have been applied on small samples or non-
mammalian genomes, leaving human normal tissues unexplored.

A thorough analysis of the polyadenylation process in adult
tissue types, showing differential gene expression, would help us
understand tissue-speciﬁc APA regulation. Although genome-
wide APA proﬁling enables us to discover genes with multiple
polyA isoforms at a genome-wide scale, it introduces major chal-
lenges. Without adequate methodology to specify the signiﬁcance
of APA biases in different tissues, we may confuse the mere
presence of multiple APA with their speciﬁc up- or downregula—
tion across conditions. A clean deﬁnition of truly speciﬁc sets is
necessary to investigate which features allow for successful dis-
crimination via computational models, and to suggest candidate
regulatory features for future studies.

In this article, we address several of these challenges by using
data from a new RNA-seq protocol applied to sequence the
3’-UTR end of mRNAs from different adult normal tissue
types. Using a linear model, we distinguish between constitutive,
alternative and alternatively regulated polyadenylation sites. Our
linear regression model takes into account different library
depth, expression of each gene in each tissue, as well as inter-
actions between tissues and genes. As is still the case with many
deep sequencing datasets, we do not have multiple replicates at
our disposition that can be used to identify signiﬁcantly differing
APAs across tissues. Instead, signiﬁcance of differences between
samples from different tissue types is assessed by an appropri-
ately designed permutation test. We then use the ﬂanking se-
quence region around polyA sites to build predictive models
both for the discrimination of constitutive polyA sites from gen-
omic background, as well as to distinguish between regulated
APA sets from different tissues.

2 RESULTS

2.1 A paired-end sequencing strategy for identifying
polyadenylation sites

To precisely map polyA sites at genome-wide scale, we made use
of several new libraries generated by a tailored sequencing ap-
proach, PA-seq. This protocol yields paired-end tags, with one
tag located directly at the cleavage site, and its pair mapping to a
more upstream location, typically in the 3’-UTR of the same
transcript, Figure 1 (see Section 5).

We used PA-seq to monitor the differential usage of polyade-
nylation sites in three different human adult tissue types: brain,
liver and kidney. Each tissue was sequenced at varying depth. We
obtained 2.8 million raw paired reads from liver, 8 million from
kidney and 3.5 million from brain. Of those paired reads, ~85%
mapped to the human genome (hgl9). Non-redundant read
pairs, i.e. those that showed differences in at least one of the
paired end tags, were grouped for each unique 3’ position, denot-
ing a polyA site. These sites were ﬁltered to exclude 3’ locations
that mapped to genomic regions with high A content, to exclude
possible contaminations by internal priming. PA—seq reads were

Fig. 1. Summary of PA-Seq Protocol: Total mRNA is randomly frag-
mented and reversed transcribed with a modiﬁed oligo(dT) primer, which
synthesizes with the polyA tail. CDNA fragments are then captured and
sequenced using multiplexed paired-end sequencing on Illumina

then clustered into clusters (PAS clusters) analogous to an algo-
rithm previously developed for the analysis of capped 5’ mRNA
tags (Ni et al., 2010). We used the total sum of the non-redun-
dant read pairs of all of the 3’ tags in each PAS cluster as a
measure of the PAS usage, and considered PAS clusters covering
narrow genomic regions and with ﬁve or more reads for all fur-
ther analyses (see Section 5). Table 1 summarizes the data for all
libraries.

To differentiate between PAS clusters that are constitutively
used versus those with more than one polyA site, we grouped all
overlapping PASs of the same transcript from the three tissue
types together. Each PAS cluster was referred to by the mode of
its median (see Section 5). If the gene has one PAS cluster, we
refer to it as a constitutive gene; if it has more than one PAS
cluster, we refer to it as an alternatively polyadenylated gene.
Overall, we identiﬁed PAS clusters for 11454 genes: around
7278 are constitutive and 4176 are alternative polyadenylated.
From genes that are expressed in the three tissue types, 2171
are constitutive genes and 1965 are alternative polyadenylated
genes. Alternative—polyadenylated genes had 5357 different
PAS clusters; this is the set included in our analysis.

2.2 Characterization of tissue-speciﬁc regulated
polyadenylation sites

Previous research on APA has shown that most of human genes
have multiple polyadenylation sites, with many of them being
tissue-speciﬁc. Testing the statistical signiﬁcance of differential
preferences for APA usage for a gene between tissues has been
previously investigated by applying Fisher’s exact tests, chi-
square tests or linear trend test (Beaudoing and Gautheret,
2001; Fu et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2005a). Applied on a gene
with multiple PAS, measured across multiple conditions, Fisher’s
test will detect a signiﬁcant difference of the pattern from the null
assumption, but further tests are needed to pinpoint exactly
which PAS, in which tissue, deviates from constitutive expres-
sion. A popular approach for identifying speciﬁc events across
multiple tissues/sites has therefore been introduced based on

Shannon entropy (Schug et al., 2005). Entropy values close to (a)

zero represent events speciﬁc to a single tissue; values increase as
the relative usage spreads more across tissue types, or when the
relative contribution of the tissue to the overall usage decreases.
However, entropy does not directly reﬂect signiﬁcance, as sam-
ples with vastly different levels of evidence (e.g. read coverage)
may lead to similar entropy values.

To avoid these shortcomings, we speciﬁed a linear effects re-
gression model for the read counts of each PAS cluster in each
tissue type, motivated by previous applications to detect signiﬁ-
cant changes in gene expression (Marioni et al., 2008) and alter-
native splicing patterns (Blekhman et al., 2010). We controlled
for ﬁxed effects including different tissue depth, expression of
each gene in each tissue, as well as any interaction between tis-
sues and genes. The resulting residual for a given PAS cluster in a
given tissue reﬂects evidence that this PAS cluster is speciﬁc, and
highly used, in the tissue.

We then needed to quantify whether for a given PAS cluster,
an observed difference in read counts in a speciﬁc tissue is sig-
niﬁcant, i.e. more pronounced than what would be expected
owing to random variation. Given that the libraries were
sequenced without experimental replicates, we applied permuta-
tion tests on the read counts of PASs for each gene in our
libraries, to determine a tissue-speciﬁcity threshold (see
Section 5). With three libraries at our disposal, we separated
tissue-speciﬁc PAS clusters into two groups: clusters that are
highly used in one individual tissue (individual), and clusters
that are highly used in two tissue types simultaneously (overlap-
ping). Figure 2a shows the test statistics for assessing the over-
lapping tissue-speciﬁcity applied to both original and permuted
data.

By applying our linear model on alternative-polyadenylated
genes, our strict selection led to 234 tissue-speciﬁc individual
PAS clusters, and 214 tissue-speciﬁc clusters overlapping in
two tissue types [at P<0.01; false-discovery rate (FDR)<0.25]
(Fig. 2b). To study the biased usage of APA in different tissues,
we calculated a variability index (VI) between each pair of tis-
sues. A low VI between two tissues indicates strong concordance
in their usage of PAS clusters (see Section 5). Conﬁrming expect-
ations, liver and kidney showed the highest correlation, while
brain and kidney were the lowest.

To illustrate the difference of our model compared with pre-
vious approaches, we calculated the Shannon entropy for the
subset of PAS clusters that showed signiﬁcant tissue speciﬁcity

tissue-speciﬁc PAS clusters found in each tissue: total individual sites: 234
(90 + 68 + 76), total overlap sites: 214 (31 + 100 + 83)

for both the individual and overlap PAS, Figure 3a. While the
Shannon entropy is less than one for about 480 PAS clusters, our
model identiﬁed only half of these as signiﬁcantly tissue speciﬁc,
with few additional PASs that had higher entropy. This is mainly
because Shannon entropy does not take the abundance of evi-
dence into account. For example, in Figure 3b, while the residual
for the most proximal PAS site of the gene HDLBP (on negative
strand) in brain indicates its outlier character, it is based on 17
tags (< 10% of the total) and thus not large enough to be sig-
niﬁcantly brain speciﬁc. Additional data would be needed to
conﬁrm the speciﬁc trend. In turn, our model characterized spe-
ciﬁc PAS clusters that would have been characterized as non-
speciﬁc due to higher entropy values. As an example, Figure 3c
shows two PAS clusters for the gene BDHl (on negative strand).
The distal cluster is used in the three tissue types, while the prox-
imal is used in kidney and brain only. Using the linear model, the
distal cluster was detected as signiﬁcant in liver, given that the
other cluster, the proximal one, shows higher usage in the other
two tissues (more than 2-folds).

2.3 Modeling constitutive polyadenylation sites

Because the PAPs responsible for synthesizing the polyA tail lack
substrate speciﬁcity, it necessitates the presence of speciﬁc signals
in the sequences around polyA sites that control mRNA poly-
adenylation (reviewed by Tian and Graber, 2012). One of the
known main cis—regulatory elements is a conserved hexamer with
consensus AWUAAA, located 10—35nt upstream of the polyA

Fig. 3. (a) Histogram of Shannon entropy Q-values for all PAS clusters (range from 0 to 9). Red bars represent entropy values for individual-signiﬁcant
PAS detected by our model, blue bars represent overlap-signiﬁcant PAS. Individual sites cluster at 0—2 entropy, and overlap sites cluster at the upper end
of the range. (b) Example showing that Shannon entropy does not take the abundance of the evidence into account for calling sites signiﬁcant. The usage
(count) of each PAS cluster is marked in each tissue, followed by the entropy values then the test statistics resulted from our linear model. Tissue
speciﬁcity is determined by low entropy values but high test statistics above a certain threshold. The proximal site in brain (17 tags; < 10% of total) is
classiﬁed as speciﬁc (entropy = 0.46). However, this relatively low tag number compared with the overall expression of the gene and the total library
depth is not enough to call this site brain-speciﬁc. Entropy values for this proximal site in liver and kidney represent pseudo-counts (not shown in ﬁgure).
(c) Example of a speciﬁc PAS cluster detected by our linear model and not by Shannon entropy (BDH1 gene on negative strand). The distal site (65 tags)
is the only PAS site for this gene used in liver. Given the relatively low expression level of the gene and the liver-low library depth compared with brain
and kidney, this site is classiﬁed as signiﬁcant (test statistic of our model is marked by red circle). Shannon entropy values do not reﬂect this relative usage

site, referred to as polyadenylation signal (Beaudoing et al.,
2000). The sequence composition at the cleavage site itself is
not well characterized, but a dinucleotide preference CA was
found in vitro (Chen et al., 1995). The sequence around polyA
sites are usually G/U-rich with a remarkable downstream elem-
ent (DSE), located within 30 nt downstream of the cleavage site.
Upstream of polyA sites are upstream elements (USE) that are
usually also U—rich, while some G—rich sequences have been re-
ported as well. These elements are largely located in the region
(+100,—100) nt around polyA sites (Tian and Graber, 2012).
Most early attempts for the computational prediction of
polyA sites considered only samples containing the canonical
PAS signal. Position weight matrices (PWM) for DSE and
USE along with the PAS signal were used as input features for
hidden Markov model (HMM) or support vector machines
(SVM) (Hajarnavis et al., 2004; Legendre and Gautheret, 2003;
Liu et al., 2003; Salamov and Solovyev, 1997; Tabaska and
Zhang, 1999). After the characterization of 15 putative regula-
tory elements surrounding PAS signals (Hu et al., 2005), pos-
ition-speciﬁc scoring matrices for the identiﬁed motifs and
structural patterns of mRNA, have been later used as input fea-
tures (Ahmed et al., 2009; Akhtar et al., 2010; Chang et al., 2011;
Cheng et al., 2006; Shao et al., 2009). Most recently, the appli-
cation of artiﬁcial neural network and random forests techniques
have been proposed (Kalkatawi et al., 2012). These models were
largely trained on low-abundance pooled EST data from varying
human tissues; none of them examined tissues independently.
While the use of curated quality controlled data from collections
such as PolyA_DB (Zhang et al., 2005b) made it possible to
design models with high accuracy, studies typically restricted
their dataset to only include transcripts with PAS signals and
results were sometimes hard to interpret owing to negative
data not matched to the problem faced by the RNA processing
machinery (such as using random genomic locations).

Modeling constitutive and/or APA sites speciﬁcally has so far
rarely been investigated. The exact motifs responsible for APA
are frequently still unknown, especially when it comes to tissue-
regulated APA. Calculating PWM scores as features of classi-
ﬁers, as in the case of constitutive sites with known motifs, will
likely not reﬂect all of the regulatory elements. It is thus more
applicable to use a sparse sequence-based classiﬁer that uses a
broad deﬁnition of the feature space. String kernels transform
the input sequences into a higher-dimensional feature space, ef-
fectively looking for similarities among substrings, and have been
proven to be successful in the prediction of alternative splicing
and transcription start sites (Sonnenburg et al., 2006, 2007).
Here, we build an SVM, using all of the information available
in the sequences ﬂanking the polyA sites, by applying two string
kernels, the spectrum kernel (Leslie et al., 2002) and the weighted
degree kernel with shifts (WD) (Shogun toolbox; version 2.0.0)
(Ratsch et al., 2005). While the spectrum kernel highlights the
global similarities between sequences as it counts the number of
occurrences of similar motifs, the WD kernel counts the number
of matching substrings of similar lengths at the same position but
allowed to be shifted within a speciﬁed window size around that
position.

To investigate whether local sequence features around polyA
sites are sufﬁcient to explain polyadenylation, we ﬁrst examined
whether PAS clusters for constitutive genes could be classiﬁed
from non-polyA sites. We focused on (—100,+100) nt around
polyA sites, given that the known constitutive elements are
located in this region, and that it has additionally been shown
to exhibit a biased nucleotide composition (Legendre and
Gautheret, 2003; Tian et al., 2005). As the polyadenylation ma-
chinery scans transcribed sequences for cleavage locations, it is
not appropriate to use random genomic locations as negative set.
Within transcripts, the highly distinct higher order nucleotide
composition in coding sequences renders them inappropriate.

Instead, we built a biologically motivated and challenging nega-
tive dataset: for each PAS, we randomly selected 10 positions in
the 3’-UTR sequence between the transcript stop codon and the
PAS, but not including the last 100 nucleotides. We retrieved the
ﬂanking (—100,+100) regions around these positions to create
our negative dataset. In total, we extracted 2171 positive ex-
amples, and 21 710 negative examples.

Because we needed to set multiple hyper-parameters for the
SVM and kernels, like order, shift and the classiﬁcation penalty,
we randomly split our dataset into 20% for model selection and
80% for (independent) training and testing (see Section 5). We
applied 5-fold cross validation. The classiﬁer performance using
the two string kernels is shown in Figure 4a and b. Calculation of
the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
(auROC) showed that the WD kernel substantially outper-
formed the baseline spectrum kernel (auROC: 99.6, 93.5%).

We applied WD on varying window sizes around PAS clusters
and found that the high performance largely resulted from fea-
tures in the ﬂanking region of (—40,+40). Our model parameters
indicate that most of these motifs are less than 8-mers long, and
shifted within l2nt, which coincides with the ﬁndings of (Zhang
et al., 2005a). This suggests that motifs around constitutive
polyA sites are highly conserved in both sequence and location,
and that the WD kernel is powerful enough to capture this phe-
nomenon with near perfect accuracy. To illustrate the PAS se-
quence landscape, we created sequence logos for the ﬂanking
regions, which visually showed that the conserved motifs were
found in the region (—30,+30) nt, WebLogo (Crooks et al.,
2004), Figure 4c. The polyadenylation signal and DSE were
clearly observed, and the cleavage site itself exhibited a strong
BA dinucleotide bias (B=C, G or T), in agreement with the
previously reported CA dinucleotide.

2.4 Prediction of tissue-speciﬁc polyadenylation sites

The presence of conserved motifs for constitutive polyA sites
suggests the presence of other motifs that instruct the cell to
start the polyadenylation process around APA sites in a

all individual-tissue—regulated and the two-tissue—overlap PAS
clusters and classiﬁed them against the positive constitutive data-
set (Fig. 5a). The moderate but highly encouraging performance
of the classiﬁer on the individual-regulated and the overlap-regu-
lated datasets (auROC: 74.5 and 66.5%, respectively) support
this hypothesis. We then classiﬁed each of the individual tissue-
speciﬁc PAS clusters against constitutive PASs (Fig. 5b). Brain-
individual PAS clusters were highly distinguishable from consti-
tutive PASs (auROC = 81.5%), while kidney-individual and
liver-individual regulated PASs were classiﬁed at lower but rea-
sonable levels (auROC = 72, 63.5%, respectively). An inspection
of the sequence logos of each group explained this performance
(Fig. 6). We found an A-rich sequence just downstream of brain-
individual regulated PAS clusters that is not present in the con-
stitutive subset and other tissue-speciﬁc sets. Moreover, while the
canonical PAS signal is still found in liver-individual clusters,
making them harder to be classiﬁed from constitutive clusters,
it is completely absent in brain-individual regulated clusters.

Finally, we trained models to compare each of the individual-
regulated clusters in one tissue against all regulated clusters in the
other two tissue types (both individual and overlap, Fig. 5c). In
agreement with the motifs found at brain-speciﬁc individual PAS
clusters, classiﬁcation of brain-speciﬁc individual regulated PASs
showed the best performance (auROC = 71%).

3 DISCUSSION

APA is a regulatory process with major impact on the down-
stream post-transcriptional fate of affected transcripts, yet it has
been fairly sparsely investigated. Recently, several studies have
analyzed data resulting from new high-throughput sequencing
protocols, and some studies reported on differential preferences
for APA usage in some genes from one tissue to another
(Shepard et al., 2011). However, without a suitable methodology
to specify the signiﬁcance of these events, we may confuse alter-
native with speciﬁcally regulated polyadenylation.

Using a high-throughput sequencing method particularly de-
signed to probe the mRNA 3’-end, PA-Seq, we were able to
accurately identify polyA sites with high resolution. PA-Seq
data from brain, liver and kidney were collected and constitutive
genes were separated from those having more than one APA
isoform. Given the large variability of tag counts across genes
and coverage across libraries, simple tag number thresholds or
ratios, or information theoretic metrics such as Shannon en-
tropy, are not a well-suited methodology for deep sequencing
data. They drastically inﬂate the number of putative alternative
sites, and cannot separate spurious events with little sequence
evidence from truly signiﬁcant ones.

We therefore designed a suitable statistical framework to iden-
tify tissue-speciﬁc events such as APA sites across multiple deep
sequencing libraries. Using a ﬁxed-effects linear model and per-
mutation tests, we were able to assign signiﬁcance levels to APA
usage and identify tissue-speciﬁc regulated events. Our stringent
test left us with a highly speciﬁc and suitable dataset to investi-
gate the regulation of alternative APA, but led to limited sample
sizes. For example, the GFER mRNA showed two polyA sites
with the distal site being used in brain only, similar to the ﬁnd-
ings in (Shepard et al., 2011). However, given its relatively low

read coverage, it did not meet our stringent speciﬁcity threshold.
Replicate datasets will enable the use of other statistical tests,
which will likely detect a larger subset as signiﬁcantly different,
and may thus help to identify additional regulatory elements that
are not covered in our examples.

This study is the ﬁrst of its kind to analyze multiple APA sites
for a transcript and across more than two conditions. We sepa-
rated constitutive genes from genes with multiple APA sites, and
examined each group separately. Our analysis demonstrated that
the main cis—regulatory elements described to be responsible for
polyadenylation, are a strong—and in fact a highly inform-
ative—hallmark for constitutive sites only. Studies have shown
that 20—30% of human genes do not have the canonical PAS
signal and suggested that polyadenylation regulation is directed
by non-canonical sequences (Tian et al., 2005; Zarudnaya et al.,
2003). Moreover, regulation by non-canonical sequences is more
frequent in genes with APA (Nunes et al., 2010; Tian et al.,
2005).

In speciﬁcally regulated subsets, in particular brain APA sites,
we were able to deﬁne a highly enriched motif
(AAAAAAAAAA) starting just downstream of the PAS cluster
(Fig. 6a; application of MEME to the brain-speciﬁc subset con-
ﬁrmed its signiﬁcance, resulting in an E-value of l.8e-057). The
canonical polyA signal was not observed in brain-speciﬁc clus-
ters, and was found at lower conservation in liver and kidney.
This agrees with an observation reported in (Nunes et al., 2010),
where a polyA site did not possess the canonical polyA signal
instead contained an A-rich element in its vicinity. An analysis of
a different recent polyA deep sequencing dataset also showed a
roughly 2-fold enrichment of the A-rich motif at brain sites,
compared with liver and kidney, despite being generated by a
different protocol and processed by a different pipeline (Derti
et al., 2012). Given that the motif is speciﬁcally observed in
only one tissue within multiple datasets, it is unlikely to be an
experimental artifact resulting from internal priming, but we cau-
tiously point out that it may reﬂect a property of brain mRNAs
unrelated to polyadenylation.

Our methodology can be applied to data from additional
libraries, such as the data generated from applying a high-
throughput sequencing protocol on ﬁve mammals (Derti et al.,
2012). This will allow for the deﬁnition of speciﬁc subsets and aid
in the identiﬁcation of further candidates of regulatory sequence
features. Combined with knowledge of regulatory factors

4 CONCLUSION

In summary, we have combined high-quality genome-wide data
with appropriate downstream analyses and computational mod-
eling. We have described a successful strategy to identify subsets
of signiﬁcant condition-speciﬁc polyA events, built sequence-
based models to discriminate between them, and identiﬁed new
candidates for post-transcriptional regulatory features.

5 METHODS

5.1 Paired-end sequencing and read mapping

A new deep sequencing protocol, PA-seq, was used to identify polyade-
nylation sites at genome-wide scale. Brieﬂy, total mRNA is randomly
fragmented and reversed transcribed with a modiﬁed oligo(dT) primer

that base pairs with the polyadenylation tail. The modiﬁed oilgo(dT)
primer has a dU in the fourth location in the 3’ -end to be later digested
by USER digestive enzyme. After that, the double-stranded CDNA frag-
ments are captured by streptavidin-coupled magnetic beads, and
sequenced using multiplexed paired end sequencing on Illumina
(Fig. 1). Adult human normal kidney and liver samples were obtained
from BioChain (Cat. # R1234142-50 and R1234149-50), and brain sam-
ples were obtained from Clontech (Cat. # 636102). Detailed description
of the PA-seq protocol is available on the website.

Before mapping, we ﬁltered out low-quality reads and tags that did not
contain the adapter sequence ‘TTT’. The Burrows-Wheeler Alignment
Tool (Li and Durbin, 2009) was used to align the paired end reads inde-
pendently to the human genome (hgl9), allowing two mismatches and no
gaps. After that, we only considered 5’ and 3’ read pairs that mapped in
the same orientation within 250 000 nt on the same chromosome.

To investigate the genomic regions that our reads came from, we
annotated the 5’ aligned reads to their genomic regions using an in-
house script (Ni et al., 2010). We did not use 3’ reads for annotation
because they might fall beyond the end of annotated transcripts, indicat-
ing novel polyA sites. Locations were classiﬁed into six possible cate-
gories: annotated 3’ -UTR, < = 1000 nt downstream of 3’ -UTR, coding
region, 5’ -UTR, intron and intergenic region. Non-coding genes were
ignored, as well as 5’ reads that mapped to 5’ -UTR, intergenic regions,
introns or upstream of 3’ -UTR, as the average insert distance between 5’
and 3’ paired end reads amounted to 180—380bp.

After alignment, non-redundant mapped read pairs that had the same
paired end tags were grouped for each unique 3’ position, denoting a
polyA site. For each polyA site, the count of the non-redundant 5’
pairs were used to indicate the relative usage of this site. We then ﬁltered
out 3’ tags that had exactly one 5’ paired read (count: 1). Finally, 3’
locations that mapped genomic regions with high A-content were ﬁltered
out (13 consecutive As in the 25 nt downstream of the mapped 3’ pos-
ition), to exclude possible contamination by internal priming.

5.2 PolyA sites cluster identiﬁcation

To cluster our reads, we used an algorithm previously developed for the
analysis of capped 5’ mRNA tags (Ni et al., 2010). Only clusters with tag
numbers greater than or equal ﬁve were considered. We then selected
Narrow Peak clusters (NP), which span <25nt, with more than half of
the reads falling within :I:2 nt of the mode. A minority of ~15% showed a
broader distribution of tags and was not considered further. The relative
usage (count of the non-redundant 5’ pairs) of all of the 3’ tags in each
PAS cluster was summed up and further used as a measure of the PAS
usage, PAScount.

5.3 Identifying constitutive and alternative PAS sets

To determine constitutive set, we ﬁrst grouped all PAS clusters of the
same gene from the three tissue types together if their regions overlapped
and their modes were within :I:10 nt from the median. To get the median,
we ordered clusters according to their start position, and referred to the
PAS by the mode of the median cluster. If the PAS appeared in two tissue
types only, we used the mode of the second start position. Finally, if the
gene had one PAS cluster we called it constitutive; otherwise, it was
considered alternative.

5.4 Linear model to identify tissue-speciﬁc PAS

To determine tissue-speciﬁc contributions to PAS utilization, we imple-
mented a linear ﬁxed-effects model. Let Néw denote the PAScount for
PAS cluster p for gene g in tissue 1. Then

10g(N;,p):M+Tl+Gg+(Tl*Gg)_I—8;,p 

where p. is a general intercept term, T t is a tissue-speciﬁc effect, Gg is a
gene-speciﬁc effect, T , >I< Gg is a tissue by gene interaction term and 82,17 is
the residual. There was no need to incorporate random effect terms as we
did not have variable replicates. Because we controlled for different tissue
depth, expression of each gene in each tissue, as well as any interaction
between tissues and genes, a correlation of the residual for a particular
PAS cluster with tissue suggests differences in PAS usages between tis-
sues. To quantify the differential usage of a PAS between tissues, we
computed the differences in the residuals 8:51,. We accounted for the
lack of usage of a PAS cluster in a certain tissue by adding pseudo-
counts. We applied this model on genes that are expressed in the three
tissue types, and ﬁtted the model using Maximum Likelihood approach

as implemented in nlme R library (Pinheiro et al., 2011).

5.5 Permutation test to determine P—value

Our dataset was composed of three tissue libraries, each with the same set
of genes, but different PAS counts. To preserve library depth and gene
expression levels in each tissue, we ﬁrst calculated the contribution per-
centage of each PAS cluster on the gene level [of Equation (1)]. Then, we
used these percentages in our permutations, but noted the total expres-
sion level of each gene in each library. Our null hypothesis assumes that
PAS clusters are non-tissue—speciﬁc regulated. To model this assumption
in our permutation test, in each round, we permuted tissue labels for each
PAS cluster; then, for each gene, the percentages of the permuted PAS
were used to represent a multinomial distribution, from which we drew a
random sample, scaled by the total gene expression value in each tissue.
As the minimal evidence for each cluster was set to ﬁve reads, missing
values, i.e. PAS clusters not detected in some of the tissues, were repre-
sented by a random number between 1 and 4.

5.6 Identifying individual and overlapping PASS

To identify tissue-speciﬁc PASs that are highly used in one individual
tissue, we used the difference between the highest and the median residual
values for each PAS as test statistic. For each PAS, we computed the test
statistic {131.11, where m = 5357 different PAS. For each of the observed
differences in our data, we obtained a P—value based on an empirical null
distribution from 1000 permutations. P—values were corrected for mul-
tiple hypothesis testing using the Storey FDR calculation (Storey and
Tibshirani, 2003). We used a liberal FDR of 0.25, to allow for the dis-
covery of signiﬁcant events given the relatively small number of samples
being analyzed. The tissue-speciﬁcity threshold was set to 2.376 (in log
space, corresponding to P<0.01, FDR< 0.25); all PASs showing a dif-
ference > 2.376 were considered signiﬁcant.

To characterize PAS clusters that are highly used in two tissue types
simultaneously (overlapping), we computed the test statistics to be the
difference between the mean of the highest two residual values and the
lowest value. PASs with residual difference between tissues > 2.782 were
considered signiﬁcant to the two tissues with the highest values (corres-
ponding to FDR< 0.25, P< 0.011).

5.7 Calculation of VI

To explore differences in APA usage among tissues, we calculated a VI
that compares the number of individual regulated PAS to overlap PAS.
The V1 is deﬁned as follows:

VIx,y = (Ix + Iy)/0x,y 

where VIX,y is the VI between tissue x and tissue )2, Ix and Iy are the
number of individually regulated tissue-speciﬁc PAS clusters in tissue x
and tissue y, respectively, and 0x,y is the number of overlapping regu-
lated tissue-speciﬁc PAS clusters in tissues x and )2 simultaneously. A low
value of VI between a pair of tissues indicates a high degree of correlation
in APA regulation, whereas a high value of VI indicates a weak

correlation. The calculated indices for each pair are VILiverKl-dney: 1,44,

5.8 Calculation of Shannon entropy

We assessed tissue-speciﬁc APA in the three tissue types by calculating
Shannon entropy on the count of each PAS cluster identiﬁed in each
tissue, according to (Schug et al., 2005). We only considered genes that
were expressed in the three tissue types, i.e. that had at least one PAS
cluster annotated for each tissue. We determined the relative expression
of each PAS cluster of a gene as follows:

Winn = (Ninp 'I' D/(N; ‘I‘ xgm) (3)

where NE}, =the PAScount for PAS p for gene g in tissue t, N; is the
summation of PAScount for all PASs of gene g in tissue t and ng, is the
number of different PAS clusters for gene g. Next, we computed the
probability of observing a PAS cluster in each tissue by

m I p) = w;,,./ Z w;,,, (4)

Calculation of entropy values followed (Schug et al., 2005). Entropy
values close to zero represent the group of PAS clusters that are speciﬁc
to a single tissue, and increase when the PAS cluster is more broadly used
in different tissue types, or when the relative contribution of the tissue to
the overall usage of the PAS decreases (Schug et al., 2005).

5.9 Dataset for constitutive classiﬁcation against
background

Our dataset is best described as a set of sequences, each is composed of an
array of characters A, C, G, T. The length of each sequence is 201 char-
acters. For the positive training data, the element at position 101 repre-
sents the polyA site (median of the PAS cluster). We chose a ﬂanking
region of 100 nt upstream and downstream of the mode of the PAS clus-
ter because previous studies have shown that most of the main features of
polyA sites are located in this region (Cheng et al., 2006). We refer to the
101th position as 0, upstream sequences as (—100,—1), and downstream
sequences as (+1,+100). We restricted our dataset to include PAS clusters
for genes that are expressed in the three tissue types.

To choose a biologically motived background/negative dataset, for
each true PAS mode in our PAS cluster positive dataset, we randomly
selected 10 positions downstream of the stop codon, but did not include
the 100 nt just upstream of the mode of the PAS. If the gene does not
have an annotated stop codon, we select positions from the last 500 nt but
not including the last 100 nt upstream of the mode of the PAS. We then
retrieved the sequence of the 100 nt upstream and downstream of these
selected sites to compose our negative dataset.

5.10 String kernels and SVM

Kernel functions measure the similarity between different data points in
the feature space. For our purposes, the similarity is between two seg-
ments of DNA sequences with the same length. As noted earlier, the main
ciS-regulatory elements responsible for polyadenylation are located in the
ﬂanking region (—40,+40) nt from polyA sites, while further downstream
and/or upstream (—100,+100) of the polyA site lie some other G/U-rich
segments of sequences, with varying length, location and exact sequence
compositions. The spectrum kernel considers the global similarities be-
tween two given sequences, by counting the number of occurrences of k-
mer motifs (referred to as ‘order’ in Section 5.12) over the entire sequence.
The Weight degree kernel with shifts focuses on local similarities between
the given sequences by counting the number of matching k-mers at the
same positions, within a window around the matching position (referred
to as ‘shift’). We applied both string kernels on the region (—100,+100).

Note: Model selection was performed on 20% of the data that was kept independ-
ent, and applying cross validation.

5.11 Handling unbalanced data

Our negative dataset has 10 times more examples than the positive set.
This unbalanced dataset could be challenging for classiﬁers; because the
data is unbalanced, the cost of misclassiﬁcation is also unbalanced; thus,
a false negative is more costly than a false positive (Ben-Hur et al., 2008).
Therefore, we assigned relative misclassiﬁcation penalty, C, for each set
according to its number of examples; for positive training data, C is 10
times larger than that of the negative training data (Provost, 2000).

5.12 Model selection

To settle on the combination of parameters, which represent our model’s
ability to accurately distinguish the surrounding sequence of polyA sites
from other genomic loci, we applied model selection. The four parameters
to be optimized are (i) misclassiﬁcation penalty or the SVM (C), (ii)
length of the substrings compared (order), (iii) positional shifts/window
around polyA site for WD kernel and (iv) length of the ﬂanking region
around the PAS. We tried different values for each of these parameters,
while ﬁxing the rest. To avoid over-ﬁtting, ﬁrst, we randomly split our
data; 20% for model selection and 80% for training and testing. These
two sets were kept independent of each other. In the model selection
phase, we applied 2-fold cross validation, and selected parameters that
gave the highest auROC. The optimal values for each parameter is shown
in Table 2. We then used the selected parameters in the training and test
phase by applying 5-fold cross validation. Evaluation curves were drawn
using ROCR package (Sing et al., 2005).

5.13 SVM on tissue-speciﬁc regulated PAS clusters

In this experiment, our positive examples were the set of individual and
overlap tissue-speciﬁc sites, and negative examples were constitutive sites,
expressed in the three tissue types and with exactly one PAS cluster. As
the WD kernel clearly outperformed the spectrum kernel on the recogni-
tion of constitutive sites, we only used the WD kernel for the rest of our
analyses.

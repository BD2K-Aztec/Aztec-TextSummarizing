ABSTRACT

Motivation: Peptides play important roles in signalling, regulation and
immunity within an organism. Many have successfully been used as
therapeutic products often mimicking naturally occurring peptides.
Here we present PeptideLocator for the automated prediction of func-
tional peptides in a protein sequence.

Results: We have trained a machine learning algorithm to predict bio-
active peptides within protein sequences. PeptideLocator performs
well on training data achieving an area under the curve of 0.92 when
tested in 5-fold cross-validation on a set of 2202 redundancy reduced
peptide containing protein sequences. It has predictive power when
applied to antimicrobial peptides, cytokines, growth factors, peptide
hormones, toxins, venoms and other peptides. It can be applied to
refine the choice of experimental investigations in functional studies of
proteins.

1 INTRODUCTION

Peptides, which are often generated by cleavage from precursor
proteins, are important molecules found in all organisms and
play a role in a wide range of biological processes. It is this
universal distribution, along with the diversity of functions that
they undertake, that make peptides interesting as putative thera-
peutic agents, for example, as antimicrobials (F jell et al., 2012;
Hancock and Sahl, 2006) or analgesics (Diochot et al., 2012).
Peptides can function as hormones and immunomodulating
agents, through interactions with cytokines, receptors and
other signalling proteins (Moller et al., 2008), and have attracted
signiﬁcant interest with recent appreciation of their ability to act
as inhibitors or antagonists of protein—protein interaction net-
works (Boonen et al., 2009). Other diverse functions include
quorum sensing in the regulation of gut bacteria populations
(Swift et al., 2000); inhibition or activation of enzymes

(e. g. ACE inhibitors), membrane-bound protein channels, trans-
porters and receptors by toxin or venom peptides (Lewis et al.,
2003) and the disruption of cell membranes to facilitate the de-
struction of microbial cells by antimicrobial peptides.

While most bioactive peptides have been deﬁned with a view
to being therapeutic, not all are so, including, for example, toxins
produced by one organism that may limit the growth of another
organism, or peptides found to inhibit an enzyme in an in vitro
assay. The definition of ‘bioactive’ used here is a general catch-all
term for peptides having biological effects, and is representative
of the concept that there may be some commonalities shared
among diverse bioactive peptides derived from larger precursor
proteins.

Several health beneﬁts have been associated with bioactive
peptides, particularly those derived from food sources such as
plants and bovine milk (Clare and Swaisgood, 2000). They have
been shown to be functionally active, from simple dipeptides in
ACE inhibition (Norris et al., 2012), to larger milk peptides im-
portant in immunogenicity and nutrition in early development
(Newburg and Walker, 2007). Speciﬁc health-promoting proper-
ties of food peptides include antithrombotic, antimicrobial, min-
eral binding, opiod, immune and cytomodulatory and blood
pressure reduction, with many peptides exhibiting more than
one function (Hartmann and Meisel, 2007). Functional additives
in food are an increasingly interesting area of development given
the potential to deliver improvements in diet, health and resist-
ance to infection. Peptides offer a naturally derivable source of
such functional foods, and as a result, there has been consider-
able interest in the identiﬁcation of bioactive peptides in food
products, particularly milk (Clare and Swaisgood, 2000). Several
peptides have already been commercialized as nutraceuticals
(Korhonen and Pihlanto, 2006), demonstrating the need for
more methods for the detection and characterization of novel
bioactive peptides in this area (Khaldi, 2012).

Many databases have been created cataloguing instances of
bioactive peptides. These include PepBank (Shtatland et al.,
2007), PeptideDB (Liu et al., 2008), BIOPEP (Dziuba et al.,
1999) and the antimicrobial peptide databases, APD2 WVang
et al., 2009) and CAMP (Thomas et al., 2010). The peptide ac-
tivity classes found in PeptideDB and BIOPEP include anti-
microbial peptides, cytokines and growth factors, peptide
hormones and toxin/venom peptides, whereas APD2 and
CAMP are limited to antimicrobial peptides such as antiviral,

Bioactive peptide prediction

 

antifungal, antibacterial and antiparasitic peptides. Such data-
bases have facilitated the bioinformatic analysis of peptides, pro-
moting the creation of tools to aid in the identiﬁcation of
bioactive peptides.

The identiﬁcation of bioactive peptides within protein se-
quences is the ﬁrst step in the development of a therapeutic
product. In food-based protein precursors, bioactive peptides
can be isolated by bacterial fermentation, or through the use of
gastrointestinal or alternative proteolytic enzymes (Korhonen
and Pihlanto, 2006; Vijayakumar et al., 2012). In silica strategies
used to detect novel bioactive peptides include the examination
of sequence and structure homology as well as the emerging
approaches of peptidomics (Sasaki et al., 2010). Homology-
based prediction of bioactivity has successfully identiﬁed many
instances of antimicrobial peptides (Lynn et al., 2004). Other
bioinformatic methods have been used to predict peptide modu-
lators of human platelet function (Edwards et al., 2007). As in
many applications of bioinformatics, tools for the prediction of
bioactivity have used propensity scales, which capture informa-
tion about the statistical preferences of different amino acids to
be bioactive peptides or not (Torrent et al., 2011). Other predic-
tion tools have been based on Support Vector Machines (Lata
et al., 2010; Thomas et al., 2010), hidden Markov models (Fjell
et al., 2007) or sequence alignments and feature selection WVang
et al., 2011). Most tools focus on a particular class of bioactive
peptide prediction, for example, antimicrobial peptides; however,
PeptideRanker (Mooney et al., 2012), which has been developed
recently, is a general bioactive peptide predictor. These tools
predict the bioactivity of stand-alone peptide sequences but
they are not optimized for the discovery of bioactive peptides
within larger parent protein sequences, ignoring the protein con-
text of the bioactive peptide, which may provide additional
information.

Here, we have combined many classes of bioactive peptides
that are functionally distinct, but nevertheless have shared prop-
erties. Using the precursor protein sequences of these peptides,
retrieved from PeptideDB, we have trained bidirectional recur-
sive neural networks (BRNN), which take as input the protein
sequence and a number of predicted structural features of the
protein, and predict bioactive peptides within the protein se-
quence. As far as we are aware, only one other method exists
for the identiﬁcation of potential bioactive peptide regions within
a protein sequence, and this method is specialized for the predic-
tion of antimicrobial peptides (Torrent et al., 2012). We have
tested the performance of PeptideRanker on an independent
test set of antimicrobial peptides from APD2 and followed up
with an analysis of 661 food proteins from the BIOPEP
database.

2 METHODS

2.1 Training and test datasets

Proteins with bioactive peptides of length less than or equal to 50 residues
were retrieved from PeptideDB (Liu et al., 2008). From 6145 peptide
precursor protein sequences, we generated two internally redundancy-
reduced sets: PeptideDB.90, which was redundancy reduced to <90%
sequence similarity, leaving 4505 sequences, and PeptideDB.30, which
was redundancy reduced to <30% sequence similarity, leaving 2202 pro-
tein sequences. Supplementary Figure S1 shows the length of the

bioactive peptides plotted against the length of the precursor proteins
in both of these datasets.

To generate the PeptideLocator training dataset, we split the
PeptideDB.30 dataset into ﬁve equally sized test sets. The training set
for each test set was created by running a BLAST search (Altschul et al.,
1997) (e-value <0.001) of each sequence in the PeptideDB.90 dataset
against that test set. If a hit was found, then that sequence was removed.
This resulted in ﬁve 90% internal redundancy-reduced training sets with
no BLAST hit with an e-value <0.001 to any sequence in the correspond-
ing test set. In summary, no sequence in a test set had >30% sequence
similarity to any other sequence in that or any other test set and no
sequence was used in training a model of the network that has a
BLAST hit with an e—value <0.001 to a sequence used for testing that
model.

Each residue of every sequence in the datasets was labelled as either a
bioactive peptide residue or non-bioactive peptide residue (Table 1).
Secondary structure, solvent accessibility, structural motifs and disorder
were predicted for the full protein sequence using Porter (Pollastri and
McLysaght, 2005), PaleAle (Pollastri et al., 2007), Porter+ (Mooney
et al., 2006) and IUPred (Dosztanyi et al., 2005), respectively. Each resi-
due was labelled with the predicted probability of being in each of 3
classes in the case of secondary structure, 4 classes for solvent accessibil-
ity, 14 classes for structural motifs and a single label representing the
predicted probability of the residue being disordered. We included solvent
accessibility, secondary structure and structural motifs as they provide
information on the potential structure of the peptide. We included pre-
dicted disorder, as this may provide information not only on the peptide’s
structural state, but also the context of the peptide that may facilitate
biological release by proteolytic cleavage or biological activity as a
self-contained signalling motif unconstrained by adjacent ordered
regions.

The sequences were then split into domain/non—domain sections using
SMART (Letunic et al., 2009). The input to the BRNN for each domain/
non-domain protein section was the length of the section, the bioactive/
non-bioactive labels per residue, the three predicted structural features
(secondary structure, solvent accessibility and structural motifs), the pre-
dicted disorder per residue and a single extra input representing if the
section was, or was not, predicted to be a domain by SMART.

2.2 Independent test datasets

To create an independent test set, we retrieved any peptide from the
APD2 Wang et al., 2009), which had information on the original protein
sequence from which it was derived. We then searched Swiss-Prot (The
UniProt Consortium, 2012) for the protein sequence. If the protein se-
quence was not longer than the peptide sequence, it was discarded. This
resulted in 132 unique protein sequences. We redundancy reduced this set
to <30% sequence similarity to any sequences in PeptideDB.90. This left
us with 15 protein sequences. Table 1 shows the number of residues per
class (bioactive/non—bioactive).

2.3 Predictive algorithms and implementation

We use a BRNN to learn the mapping between inputs I and outputs 0
(protein sequence to bioactive peptide residue). BRNN have been used
successfully for the prediction of secondary structure (Pollastri and
McLysaght, 2005), solvent accessibility (Pollastri et al., 2007) and struc-
tural motifs (Mooney et al., 2006) among other things and have the ad-
vantage over standard feed-forward neural networks that they can
automatically ﬁnd the optimal context on which to base a prediction,
i.e. the number of residues that are informative to determine a property.
Because of their recursive nature, BRNN also have a relatively low
number of free parameters compared with other neural networks with
similar input size. See Baldi et al. (1999) for a detailed explanation of the
BRNN model and Figure 1, which illustrates the topology.
These networks take the form:

0,- = M0)  hf), hf”)
hjin 2 Na) (ij, hjipl)
hf?) = M3)  hjﬂ)

j=1,...,N

where ij (respectively Oj) is the input (respectively output) of the network
in position j, and hf) and 12113 ) are forward and backward chains of hidden
vectors with kg” = hgﬂl = 0. We parametrize the output update, forward
update and backward update functions (respectively NW), AN) and

AN”) using three two-layered feed-forward neural networks.

Encoding sequence and structural information Input 1',- associated
with the j-th residue contains primary sequence information and pre-
dicted structural information:

where, assuming that e units are devoted to sequence, and t to structural
information:

 a)
and
m_ m m
5- 49.19%)

 

 

 

We use e = 26: beside the 20 standard amino acids, B (aspartic acid or
asparagine), U (selenocysteine), X (unknown), Z (glutamic acid or gluta-
mine) and (gap) are considered, while the 26th input encodes the length of
the sequence. The frequency of gaps in a column provides information
about the conservation of a site, and has proven helpful in preliminary
tests. We use t = 23 for representing structural information. The ﬁrst three
structural input units contain the predicted three-class secondary structure
representing the predicted probability of the j-th residue belonging to helix,
strand or coil. The next four input units contain the predicted probability
of the j-th residue belonging to one of four solvent accessibility classes. The
following 14 input units contain the predicted probability of the j-th residue
belonging to one of 14 structural motifs classes, and the ﬁnal two inputs are
the predicted probability of the residue occurring in a disordered region or
a predicted domain. Hence, the total number of inputs for a given residue is
e + t = 49. The output is the predicted probability of the j-th residue
belonging to a bioactive peptide.

Training, Ensembling Training is conducted by 5-fold cross-valida-
tion, i.e. ﬁve sets of training are performed in which a different ﬁfth of the
overall set is reserved for testing. Before being split into the ﬁve test sets,
the test dataset was sorted by PeptideDB ID. We then picked instance
1 for test set 1, instance 2 for test set 2, etc., in an interleaved or stratiﬁed
manner. As the PeptideDB IDs tend to be clustered by peptide function,
this ensures that all types of peptide function are distributed similarly
across and present in each of the test sets.

The training set is used to learn the free parameters of the network by
gradient descent. Five models are trained independently for each of the 5-
folds, i.e. 25 models in total. Differences among models in each fold are
introduced by varying the architectural parameters of the network. 250
passes through the entire training set (epochs) of training are performed
for each model, and the learning rate (which controls how fast the algo-
rithm converges) is halved every time we do not observe a reduction of
the error for >50 epochs.

By the end of training, 22 of the 25 models of the network have errors of
<5%. We can therefore assume that the networks are converging to ﬁnd
good local optima. To test the ﬁnal predictor, we ensemble the ﬁve models
in each of the 5-folds by averaging their results on their respective test sets,
and then combining these ﬁve results to get the overall 5-fold cross-valida-
tion result. To build the ﬁnal predictor and when testing on an entirely
independent set from the one used during training, we ensemble-combine
(average) the results across all 25 models in one step.

2.4 Evaluating performance

To evaluate the performance of PeptideLocator, we measure the true-
positive rate (TPR) and false-positive rate (FPR) as we increase the

Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve where TPR is plotted against FPR,
which are calculated as follows:

TPR — TP

where

0 True positives: the number of residues predicted in a class that are

0 False positives: the number of residues predicted in a class that are
not observed in that class.

0 True negatives: the number of residues predicted not to be in a class
that are not observed in that class.

0 False negatives: the number of residues predicted not to be in a class
that are observed in that class.

The area under the curve (AUC), which is equivalent to the probability
that the classiﬁer will rank a randomly chosen positive instance higher
than a randomly chosen negative instance (Fawcett, 2006) is also shown.
The AUC is a number between 0 and 1 where 0.5 indicates a random
model and 1 is perfect. R is used to plot the curves and calculate the AUC
(R Development Core Team, 2008). Speciﬁcity (Spec), sensitivity (Sen),
Matthews Correlation Coefﬁcient (MCC) and the accuracy (Q) at a 0.5
threshold are measured as follows:

Q: 100TP+TN+FP+FN

MCC measures the correlation coefﬁcient between the observed and
predicted classiﬁcations. A value of 1 represents a perfect prediction, 0 a
random prediction and —1 an inverse prediction and is a good indicator
of the overall performance of the predictive methods for both bioactive
peptide and non-bioactive peptide residues.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

For every residue, PeptideLocator predicts the probability
between 0 and 1 of that residue being part of a bioactive peptide.
The closer the probability is to 1, the more conﬁdent
PeptideLocator is that the residue is part of a bioactive peptide.
The results in 5-fold cross-validation for the test dataset,
PeptideDB.30, are shown in Table 2 and in Supplementary
Figure S2A as a ROC curve with thresholds from 0 to 1, i.e.
the cut-off above which a residue is considered to be predicted as
a bioactive peptide residue. Speciﬁcity, sensitivity and the accu-
racy (Q) are well over 80%, with an AUC of 92% and MCC of
0.71 showing a strong correlation between predicted and the
observed classiﬁcations.

We chose secondary structure, solvent accessibility, structural
motifs and disorder as additional inputs into the network as we
considered these factors may contribute to the identiﬁcation of a
bioactive peptide within a protein sequence. We trained the net-
works leaving out each of these in turn and found that the results

were similar in all cases (Q 85.1—85.8%, AUC 0.91—0.92) except
for when solvent accessibility was excluded (Q 80%, AUC 0.87).
This would seem to suggest that solvent accessibility contributes
most to the accuracy of the BRNN, however a model of the
network trained only including solvent accessibility resulted in
a Q of 83.7%, and an AUC of 0.90, compared to a Q of 85.8 and
an AUC of 0.92 when all four features are included. Given this
contribution to performance, we chose to retain all four features
in the predictor. Unfortunately, there is no easy way to reverse
engineer how the model decides on a prediction because it com-
presses the input sequence into many hidden states/features for
each residue, which do not correspond directly to any known
property of the protein.

Although the APD2.30 dataset is very small (15 sequences),
and is restricted to antimicrobial peptides only, we can see from
Table 2 that PeptideLocator is able to predict which class (bioac-
tive/non-bioactive) residues fall into with an accuracy of over
82%. Ninety percent of the bioactive peptide residues are pre-
dicted correctly. However, the FPR of 30.36% (i.e. the percen-
tage of non-bioactive peptide residues incorrectly predicted as
bioactive) is high. This could be corrected for example by
increasing the threshold to 0.8 which would decrease the FPR
to ~20% without reducing the TPR (see ROC curve
Supplementary Fig. S2B). For this reason we have chosen a
threshold of 0.8 for the food protein examples which we present
below. Improved larger databases of bioactive peptides linked to
precursor proteins will permit more accurate evaluation of the
performance of the method we have presented, in addition to
providing larger training sets for future methods development.

3.1 Peptide activity classes

To assess the ability of PeptideLocator to predict bioactive pep-
tides in other classes (not only antimicrobial peptides as in
APD2.30), we split the PeptideDB.30 results into six peptide
activity subsets: antifreeze, antimicrobial, cytokines and growth
factor, peptide hormones, toxins and venom, and unique/other.
The number of residues per class are shown in Table 3 and the
results are shown as ROC curves (Fig. 2). The classes for which
PeptideLocator is most accurate are antifreeze, antimicrobial and
toxins and venom, which all have AUCs Z 95%. PeptideLocator
performs worst on the cytokines and growth factor peptide activ-
ity subset, however an AUC of 86% is still high.

3.2 Predicted bioactive peptides in food proteins

To illustrate the functionality of PeptideLocator, the sequences
of all proteins stored in BIOPEP were retrieved from UniProt
(The UniProt Consortium, 2012). This amounted to 661 unique

proteins, primarily from food, which were redundancy reduced
with respect to the training set so that any protein with a BLAST
alignment with >30% sequence similarity to any protein in the
training set was removed, leaving 615 protein sequences
(Supplementary Fig. S3). The sequences were submitted to
PeptideLocator and the results were searched for proteins with
peptide regions with y residues over a threshold x. We selected
the 25 proteins which had at least 16 consecutive residues pre-
dicted over a threshold of 0.8 for further analysis (Supplementary
Table S1). None of these predicted peptide regions are found in
our training set.

Twelve of the proteins are <40 residues in length. For most of
these, the whole protein (or protein fragment) is labelled as
bioactive (using a threshold of 0.8), and in all cases, at least
80% of the residues are predicted over the 0.8 threshold. A
number of these predicted peptides are alpha-amylase inhibitors

from Rye (Secale cereale); alpha-amylase inhibitors are being
investigated as food additives to aid in weight loss (Barrett and
Udani, 2011). The sheep lactoferrin fragment (33 residue N-term-
inal peptide without signal peptide) has been shown to be an
inhibitor of platelet aggregation (Qian et al., 1995). The wheat
allergen peptide (ALCC_WHEAT) associated with Bakers
asthma (Amano et al., 1998) and wheat gluten, important in
coeliac disease, were also identiﬁed.

We found that for the medium length proteins (40—100 resi-
dues), the predicted peptide was either at the N- or C-terminus,
with the exception of TIM13_ORYSJ; three of the proteins
(DF39_PEA, Q9FUP3_PHACN and NOl4_PEA) had signal
peptides, which were not predicted as bioactive. For example,
PeptideLocator correctly predicted the Pisum sativum (Garden
pea) bioactive peptide from Defensin-like protein 39 and has not
predicted the signal peptide as bioactive (residues 1—28, Fig. 3).

validated peptide in only two places, an extra N—terminal lysine and an asparagine (N) instead of an aspartic acid (D) at position 36 in the predicted

peptide; Dark grey bars: PeptideLocator prediction

The experimentally validated peptide from Defensin-l (UniProt:
P81929) can be found in the CAMP database (Thomas et al.,
2010) and differs from our peptide sequence only at the N-term-
inal lysine and an asparagine (N) instead of an aspartic acid (D)
at position 36 in the predicted peptide. It has been shown to have
anti-fungal activity on contact with a number of plant pathogen
fungi (Almeida et al., 2000). Another example is the Kunitz
trypsin inhibitor protein (Q9FUP3_PHACN) from Phaseolus
coccineus (Scarlet runner bean). Although not annotated as
such by UniProt, there is a signal peptide predicted by SignalP
(Petersen et al., 2011) at the start of this protein sequence, which
is not predicted as bioactive by PeptideLocator. The predicted
peptide (residues 28—73) aligns with a peptide in the CAMP
database with 54% sequence identity; this peptide is found in a
Capsicum annuum secreted protein (UniProt: Q43413) and has
been experimentally validated to have anti-fungal activity against
Fusarium oxysporum (Thomas et al., 2010).

Three of the longer proteins (>100 residues) are of particular
interest (Q43673_VICFA, CVCA_PEA and GLCAP_SOYBN).
Supplementary Figure S4 shows a strongly predicted bioactive
peptide region between residues 333 and 348 in Legumin
(Q43673_VICFA), a Vicia faba (Broad bean) 11S seed storage
protein. Convicilin (CVCA_PEA) from Pisum sativum (Garden
pea) is a 7S seed storage protein. Supplementary Figure S5 shows
a strongly predicted region of bioactivity between residues 74 and
90 and another shorter peptide region between residues 58—63.
These proteins have also been investigated for potential ACE
inhibitory activity Wermeirssen et al., 2004). A potential bioac-
tive peptide of Glycine max (Soybean) Beta-conglycinin 7S seed
storage protein (GLCAP_SOYBN) is predicted to be in the pro-
peptide region of the protein sequence (residues 23—62). This
protein has been shown to be a major food allergen (Krishnan
et al., 2009).

The appropriate test of these predictive methods is a large-
scale experimental screen that uses the prediction method devel-
oped here, ideally contrasted with a randomly selected set of
peptides, which ignores these predictions. Carrying out a large
experiment would allow a quantiﬁcation of whether the predic-
tive power of the method is supported in the laboratory as well as
in silico.

4 CONCLUSION

PeptideLocator can accurately identify peptide regions in protein
sequences according to the likelihood that they are bioactive. We
have demonstrated the use of PeptideLocator as part of a tar-
geted identiﬁcation pipeline for food peptides with beneﬁcial

properties, for example, antimicrobial peptides. It can be used
in conjunction with other tools and data, for example, food
hydrolysates that provide information on the proteolyic cleavage
of proteins. By combining cleavage patterns with the bioactivity
prediction from PeptideLocator, it is possible to identify bioa-
vailable peptides from common food, or other, proteins.
Similarly, peptides predicted by PeptideLocator for a given pre-
cursor protein can act as a guide for the selection of speciﬁc
enzymes that will result in their release. The utility of such an
approach is demonstrated in our initial analysis of the BIOPEP
dataset, showing the ability of PeptideLocator to identify pep-
tides from a set of food proteins. There is a growing need for the
identiﬁcation of novel bioactive peptides in proteins and this web
server is a useful addition to the repertoire of tools for investigat-
ing bioactivity.

PeptideLocator is available as part of our web server for bioac-
tive peptide discovery and annotation. The web server implemen-
tation of the algorithm requires as input a UniProt accession
number, which the server uses to retrieve the sequence from
UniProt (The UniProt Consortium, 2012). A graphical represen-
tation of the score per residue at a given sequence position is
included in the results page, along with IUPred disorder predic-
tion scores. The server builds an alignment of the orthologues of
the protein sequence to provide the relative local conservation
(RLC) score (Davey et al., 2009) as an additional plot in the
output for metazoan sequences. The PeptideLocator score is
unaffected by the presence of the RLC score for the protein;
however, this is instructive in the interpretation of results.
Similarly, interpretation of the likely biological context of the
peptide is aided by the inclusion of disorder predictions from
IUPred (Dosztanyi et al., 2005).

PeptideLocator is designed to allow fast and reliable annota-
tion of protein sequences and is freely available for academic
users at http://bioware.ucd.ie/. A packaged version of the
PeptideLocator code is available by contacting the authors
directly or through the Bioware Users Group (details on the
PeptideLocator web page). A web service version of the software
has been registered on biocatalogue.org (Bhagat et al., 2010)
together with examples of how to run PeptideLocator program-
matically by submitting jobs in an automated fashion.

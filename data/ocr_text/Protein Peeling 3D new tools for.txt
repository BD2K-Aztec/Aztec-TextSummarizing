ABSTRACT

Summary: We present an improved version of our Protein Peeling
web server dedicated to the analysis of protein structure architecture
through the identification of protein units produced by an iterative
splitting algorithm. New features include identification of structural
domains, detection of unstructured terminal elements and evaluation
of the stability of protein unit structures.

1 INTRODUCTION

Analyzing the architecture and organization of protein structures is
essential for understanding protein ﬂexibility, folding, functions and
interactions. We previously proposed an innovative representation
of protein architecture that gives a detailed description of protein
structure anatomy. Proteins are split into sets of compact subregions,
called protein units (PUs). A PU corresponds to one sequence
fragment characterized by a high number of intra—PU contacts and
a low number of inter—PU contacts. Contact probabilities between
residues are computed as distances between Coz atoms using a
logistic function. Using this contact probability matrix and an
optimization procedure based on Matthews’s correlation coefﬁcient
(MCC) between submatrices, the algorithm deﬁnes optimal cutting
points that separate the region examined into two or three PUs. This
methodology is called Protein Peeling (PP) (Gelly et al., 2006a).
The process is iterated until the compactness of the PUs reaches a
given limit. An index assesses the compactness quality and relative
independence of each PU.

PUs bridge the representation and description gap between
secondary structures and structural domains. PP is a useful tool
for better understanding and analyzing the organization of protein
structures. The PP 2 web server (Gelly et al., 2006b) has been
developed to accommodate advanced parameters. Here, we present
a new version of our PP web server that offers substantial
improvements and new features: recognition of unstructured
N— or C—terminal segments, a novel scoring function for PU
characterization and identiﬁcation of structural domains.

2 METHODS

2.1 Unstructured extremity recognition

Unstructured N— or C—terminal segments can be problematic for protein
analysis or molecular simulation. Using PP, this type of segment was
observed in half of the protein structures found in Protein Data Bank (Faure
et al., 2009). We thus included a new assignment method in the web server.
A PU is considered unstructured if it is isolated at the ﬁrst cutting event and
never thereafter.

2.2 Energy calculation

PUs show a wide range of shapes and many differences in the type or density
of internal contacts. These characteristics are related to internal energy. To
evaluate stability and contact energy, we implemented the DOPE statistical
potential (Shen and Sali, 2006) to compute the pseudo—energy of PUs. This
value gives an approximation of the internal energy of PUs and insight on
the structural signiﬁcance of observed PUs.

2.3 Structural domain identiﬁcation

One major potential for the PP web server was the possibility to use the
PP method to identify protein domains. We, therefore, developed a new
algorithm called domain reconstruction (DR). The identiﬁcation process
includes two steps: (i) PUs are isolated using the basic PP top—down induction
approach and (ii) PUs obtained at the ﬁnal level of PP are assembled
using the DR algorithm with a bottom—up strategy, similar to hierarchical
agglomerative clustering, as follows.

Starting from the ﬁnal PU set, the algorithm combines each, unique PU
to another PU at each recursive step. Thus, PUs are gradually merged at
each step, forming many possible domain delineations. The best merging
events are chosen among all the possible events according to the contact ratio
(CR) criterion, derived from the Protein Domain Parser method (Alexandrov
and Shindyalov, 2003). This criterion is based on contact probability matrix
computed in PP and helps estimate the quality of merging events.

The CR criterion measured for PUs i and j is

_ cam/Se)“ x SO)“

007') X 507)
where cp(i, j) is contact probability between PU,- and PUj, 5(1) and S(j) are
the length of PU,- and PUj. Finally, C(ij) and S (ij) are, respectively, the contact
probability and the size of the whole domain formed by merging PU,- and
PUj. The at value is 0.43 as in the PDP method. High CR values indicate a
high number of contacts between PU,- and PUj; consequently, theses PUs are
good candidates for merging them into one domain. During the process, a
second measure, the average contact probability density (CPD), also used in
other method (Holm and Sander, 1994), is computed to estimate the quality
of newly formed domains.

The assembly routine is reiterated and the number of domains gradually
decreases until all PUs are merged into a unique domain corresponding to
the whole protein.

After producing different levels of potential domain delineation, a post—
processing step is launched to examine and choose the best domain

delineations. First, domain partitions at each level are sorted according to the
mean CPD of domain delineation. Second, starting from the highest level,
i.e. the full protein, each level is examined and accepted or not, according to a
criterion that combines both the minimum CPD measured between domains
and the maximum CR measured among all domains. Domains with a size of
less than 30 are discarded.

The criterion combining CR and CPD and the domain size threshold were
optimized in a leave—one—out experiment on a published benchmark dataset
of protein domains (Jones et al., 1998). This experiment led to 82% of similar
domain delineations, based on the same performance measurement method
as Jones et al. (1998).

It has been demonstrated that human expert and automatic methods often
show discrepancies in the number and minimal size of domains, presence
or absence of fragments within domains and domain boundaries (Day
et al., 2003; Veretnik and Shindyalov, 2007). Results of different human
expert may even disagree, leading to unclear and sometimes ambiguous
principles of domain partitioning. To overcome the difﬁculties raised by
these studies, our DR algorithm can propose alternative domain partitions.
Thus, different levels of partitioning and consequently different sizes and
complexities of the resulting domains are produced by the DR algorithm.
This results in broader and more ﬂexible deﬁnition of structural domains
(see Fig. 1). Considering alternative domain delineations increases the
rate of agreement on Jones et al. (1998) benchmark dataset to 95% for
an average of ﬁve alternative propositions and to 98% for 15 alternative
propositions.

3 SERVER

Given the 3D coordinates of a protein, the server is able to
identify PUs, domain delineations, and, if they exist, unstructured
extremities. The server also provides some analysis on isolated PUs.

3.1 Input

PP 3D only accepts protein structure in PDB ﬁle format (Berman
et al., 2000). The ﬁle is checked (to verify consistency of the format),
cleaned (alternative positions are removed and non—standard
residues are renamed) and renumbered. In multi—protein chain ﬁles,
only the ﬁrst chain is treated. Various parameters can be adjusted,
such as parameters that direct cutting, those used for calculating the
contact probability map and that only regular secondary structures
should be taken into account.

3.2 Output and graphics

Many graphics and raw output ﬁles are available through the web
server at the end of process. The graphical results include the contact
probability map, different representations of protein structures in
which PUs or domains can be easily identiﬁed by color, and
representations of primary structure, in which PUs and domains are
colored and clearly delimited.

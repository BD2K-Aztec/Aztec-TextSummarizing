ABSTRACT

Motivation: The number of bacterial genomes being sequenced is
increasing very rapidly and hence, it is crucial to have procedures
for rapid and reliable annotation of their functional elements such
as promoter regions, which control the expression of each gene or
each transcription unit of the genome. The present work addresses
this requirement and presents a generic method applicable across
organisms.

Results: Relative stability of the DNA double helical sequences
has been used to discriminate promoter regions from non-
promoter regions. Based on the difference in stability between
neighboring regions, an algorithm has been implemented to predict
promoter regions on a large scale over 913 microbial genome
sequences. The average free energy values for the promoter regions
as well as their downstream regions are found to differ, depending
on their GC content. Threshold values to identify promoter regions
have been derived using sequences flanking a subset of translation
start sites from all microbial genomes and then used to predict
promoters over the complete genome sequences. An average recall
value of 72% (which indicates the percentage of protein and RNA
coding genes with predicted promoter regions assigned to them)
and precision of 56% is achieved over the 913 microbial genome
dataset.

Availability: The binary executable for ‘PromPredict’ algorithm
(implemented in PERL and supported on Linux and MS Windows)
and the predicted promoter data for all 913 microbial genomes are

1 INTRODUCTION

Understanding the mechanism that regulates gene expression and
identifying the key regulatory elements that aid gene expression is a
major challenge in molecular biology. Recent advances in the high—
throughput genome sequencing has led to an exponential growth
in the number of completely sequenced microbial genomes and
hence it is essential to have fast, efﬁcient and reliable computational
methods to identify, annotate and tabulate the coding regions
and non—coding functional elements such as transcription factor
binding sites (TFBSs), promoter and enhancer regions in these
microbial genomes. The identiﬁcation of the location and function of

promoter regions is very challenging because the promoter regions
in genomic sequences very often do not adhere to speciﬁc sequence
patterns or motifs and are difﬁcult to determine experimentally.
Several motif ﬁnding algorithms have been developed based on
various motif models and their performance has been assessed
(Das and Dai, 2007). Whole—genome expression proﬁles have also
led to characterization of bacterial and archaeal transcriptomes
(Passalacqua et al., 2009; Wurtzel et al., 2010). These data can
be used to validate the various promoter and DNA binding site
prediction algorithms developed based on sequence motifs (Carlson
et al., 2007; Chakravarty et al., 2007; Gordon et al., 2003, 2006;
Jacques et al., 2006; Mann et al., 2007; Reese, 2001; Solovyev
and Shahmuradov, 2003; Studholme and Dixon, 2003) as well as
those using structure—based properties of DNA (Abeel et al., 2008b;
Dekhtyar et al., 2008; Du et al., 2008; Gan et al., 2009; Kanhere
and Bansal, 2005b; Rawal et al., 2006; Wang and Benham, 2006;
Yadav et al., 2008). Most of the methods for the identiﬁcation of
promoter regions are either speciﬁc to a particular genome or only
aim to compare the properties of promoter sequences with other
regions in a general manner. These protocols have not been applied
over the entire set of microbial genomes, nor have the predictions
been validated on a genomic scale. In particular, most methods are
unable to identify promoters for RNA genes.

In our algorithm, we have made use of the earlier reported
observation that promoter regions in genome sequences have several
sequence—dependent structural properties such as low stability, high
curvature and less bendability, as compared with the ﬂanking
genomic sequence (Kanhere and Bansal, 2005b). Among these,
lower stability which is calculated as the sum of the free energy
of constituent dinucleotide steps is found to be the most ubiquitous
physicochemical property of promoter regions (Abeel et al., 2008a;
Holloway et al., 2007; Kanhere and Bansal, 2005b). A scoring
function was deﬁned and an algorithm ‘PromPredict’ was developed
to predict promoter regions, which used threshold values speciﬁc to
some select organisms namely Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis
and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Kanhere and Bansal, 2005a;
Rangannan and Bansal, 2007). Here, we brieﬂy summarize the
modiﬁcations and improvements made on prediction methodology
of ‘PromPredict’, in order to generalize it for predicting promoter
regions in all microbial genomes and possibly even eukaryotic
genomes.

genomes/Bacteria/) in March 2009 (only full—length chromosome sequences
were considered). All together, the 913 microbial genome dataset consists
of 26 71 868 genes that code for proteins. Out of these, gene translation start
sites (TLSs) that are 500 nt apart, and constitute 5% (5 31 285) of the total
dataset, have been combined to create the training dataset. In all, 1001 nt
long genomic sequences (spanning —500 to +500 nt with respect each to
TLS) have been extracted from the respective genomes for calculating the
threshold values from the TLS—based training dataset.

2.2 Threshold calculation

The genomic sequences of 1001 nt length, for the TLS—based training dataset,
were retrieved and grouped based on their GC content. The average free
energy (AFE) or stability proﬁle was computed for each group (Fig. 1). E, the
AFE over —80 to +20 region and REaV, the AFE over the downstream region
from +100 to +500 with respect to TLS, are found to discriminate promoter
regions from coding regions and were hence used to derive the threshold
values E and D (where, D=E —REav) (Rangannan and Bansal, 2009). It
may be worth mentioning that the AFE value for E and REav for the genomic
fragments from TLS—based training dataset with GC content 30—60%, have
AFE values (Fig. 2) very similar to those derived earlier from a smaller TSS—
based dataset (i.e. experimentally identiﬁed transcription start sites) from
E.coli, B.subtilis and M.tuberculosis (Rangannan and Bansal, 2009). Hence,
threshold values have been calculated for genomic DNA sequences with GC
content varying over a much larger range (shown in Fig. 2 and hereafter
referred to as TSS—TLS—based cutoff values) and applied for annotation of
promoter regions in all bacterial genome sequences.

2.3 Scoring function

The stability of double—stranded DNA can be expressed in terms of the free
energy of constituent dinucleotides. The AFE of a long continuous stretch
of DNA was calculated as described in Kanhere and Bansal (2005a). The
energy values corresponding to the 10 unique dinucleotide sequences are
taken from the uniﬁed parameters obtained from melting studies on 108
oligonucleotides (Allawi and SantaLucia, 1997; SantaLucia, 1998).

The scoring function deﬁned below has been used to calculate the relative
stability (DE) between neighboring regions of 100 nt length with respect to
every nucleotide position n. The average energy was assigned to the center

DNA with varying GC content. Of total, 1001nt long genomic sequences
spanning 500 nt on either side of 457, 282 and 40 TSSs of protein coding
genes in E. coli, B.subtilis and M. tuberculosis (dataset from Rangannan and
Bansal, 2009) and also 500 nt on either side of TLSs of protein coding genes
from 913 microbial genomes were categorized based on their %GC content
(dataset as in Fig. 1). The AFE value ‘E’, over the —80 to +20 nt region
for the promoter sequences with varying GC composition is shown (as solid
lines with ﬁlled square and circle markers) for both datasets. ‘REaV’, the AFE
values calculated over the +100 to +500 nt regions downstream of the TSSs
and TLSs are also plotted (as dashed lines with hallow square and circle
markers, respectively). The TSS—TLS—based threshold values assigned to the
parameters E and D (the difference between E and REaV) for identifying
promoter regions within genomic DNA with varying %GC content (details
given in Section 2) are tabulated below the plots.

Thus E 1(,,+50) and E2(,,+50) represent the free energy averages for 100 nt
fragments starting from nucleotides ‘n’ and ‘n+150’, respectively. DE is
the difference between E 1 and E2. A stretch of DNA sequence is assigned
as a promoter only if its AFE (E 1) and the difference in free energy (DE)
as compared with its neighboring downstream region are greater than the
chosen cutoff values (E and D) for the corresponding %GC range, as deﬁned
in the TSS—TLS—based cutoff values table (shown in Fig. 2).

2.4 Method for classiﬁcation of reliability level of
predictions

The average DE value (which is the difference in AFE between neighboring
100 nt long regions) for each predicted promoter region is denoted as
PP_DEave. Since no correlation was observed for PP_DEave based on %GC
(Supplementary Fig. 81A), in the current study we have chosen this as
an unbiased parameter to deﬁne the reliability level for each prediction
within whole genome. The average DE values for all predicted regions in
a particular genome have also been calculated and denoted as WPP_DE,,1ve
(u). For each predicted promoter region, its PP_DEave has been compared
with WPP_DE,,ve to assign a reliability level following the criteria described
below (which has been illustrated clearly in Supplementary Fig. SlB, for

Low, medium, high, very high and highest are the ﬁve prediction reliability
levels classiﬁed for the predicted promoter regions.

2.5 Evaluating parameters

Recall, Precision and their harmonic mean (F —score) are the parameters used
to evaluate the promoter prediction results over the 913 microbial genomes
and they are deﬁned as follows:

No. of genes with an identiﬁed TP

 

Recall:
Total number of genes
. . TP
Pre01s1on = —
TP + FP
2 x Precision >< Recall
F —score = —

Precision+Recall

where, true positive (TP) is total number of TP predictions and FP is total
number of false positive predictions. The 500 nt sequence upstream of
gene translation start site (TLS) is generally considered as the proximal
promoter region, where multiple TFBSs are located to trigger the initiation
of gene expression (Solovyev and Shahmuradov, 2003). Hence, we assigned
a predicted promoter region to be a TP, if it lies within the 500 nt upstream
region of a gene (with respect to the TLS). If a predicted promoter region lies
within the coding region of a gene which is in the same transcribing strand
(i.e. gene and the prediction both have same transcription direction) then it is
considered as false positive (FP). The predictions which do not satisfy these
criteria are ignored.

3 IMPLEMENTATION AND AVAILABILITY

‘PromPredict’, an algorithm for promoter prediction based on DNA
relative stability has been implemented in PERL. Based on the
observation and analysis of predicted promoter regions in 913
microbial genomes, a database termed as ‘PromBase’ is developed
using MySQL and Apache with all major browsers supported. The
web interface is managed by a collection of HTML, PERL cgi
scripts. The binary executable for ‘PromPredict’ algorithm and
the predicted promoter data for all 913 microbial genomes are
available at http://nucleix.mbu.iisc.emet.in/prombase/. Apart from
the promoter prediction data being displayed (both graphically
as genome browser and in tabular form), PromBase provides
information about several other sequence and structural features for
all 913 bacterial genomes analyzed here.

4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
4.1 Sequence preference in the Vicinity of T88 and TLS

Analysis of percentage occurrence of a tetranucleotide in promoter
region (—150 to +50 w.r.t. TSS) as compared with its downstream
region (+200 to +400 w.r.t. TSS) from E.c0li, B.subtilis and
M. tuberculosis genomes has shown that AT—rich tetramers are
predominant in E.c0li and B.subtilis but not in high GC
containing M. tuberculosis (Supplementary Fig. S2). However, even

in E. c0li and B.subtilis, several AT—containing tetramers, other than
TATA, showed higher percentage occurrence in promoter region.
Nucleotide base composition analysis and %GC distribution at
different regions w.r.t. TLS for all 913 microbial genomes can be
viewed at PromBase (http://nucleix.mbu.iisc.ernet.in/prombase), a
database displaying various features of promoter regions, in all 913
microbial genomes.

4.2 Correlation between %GC and the average free
energy

The GC base composition of bacteria varies extensively between
species (16.6—74.9%). Such a wide range of variation has been
attributed to mutational bias (Cox and Yanofsky, 1967; Sueoka,
1962) and also correlated with environmental inﬂuences on the
system (Chen and Zhang, 2003; Foerstner et al., 2005) but its effect
on transcriptional efﬁciency has not been explored. A large number
of genomes (~16%) have GC content within each of the ranges
35—40% and 65—70% for which very little transcription data are
available. In addition, regions of a given genome have GC content
differing signiﬁcantly from the whole— genome GC composition. For
the present study, we have combined the data from all 913 bacterial
genomes to derive cutoff values and hence a wide variation is
seen in GC content of the 1001 nt long sequences, extracted with
respect to the training set of TLS data. The AFE plots for the 1001
nt long sequences (constituting the TLS—based training dataset),
pooled according to their %GC content, are shown in Figure 1. It is
interesting to note the shift in the entire free energy proﬁle based on
%GC content and the pronounced low stability peak in the vicinity
of TLS in all cases.

Variations are seen for %GC and AFE at different regions
spanning TLS (—400 to —200, —150 to +50, —80 to +20 and
-I-200 to +400 regions with respect to TLS) within the sequences
that belong to the same %GC category (Supplementary Table S1).
However, the absolute values of both E and REaV become larger,
as the GC content increases, indicating their higher stability. This
is surprising since it indicates that even in the core and proximal
promoter regions the AT content decreases almost proportionately.
The difference between E and REE1V reduces slightly for extreme
%GC categories, due to the overall AT richness of even the ﬂanking
sequences in very low GC containing genomes and small numbers
of AT bases in the core promoter as well as in the downstream coding
region in the genomes with very high GC content. With an increase
in %GC of the 1001 nt long sequence, the difference in AFE values
between upstream intergenic region (—400 to —200 w.r.t. TLS) and
downstream coding region (+200 to +400 w.r.t TLS) also reduces
linearly. Sequences with low %GC show a broad less stable region
upstream of TLS while the sequences with high %GC show a narrow
low stability peak with both upstream and downstream regions being
almost equally GC rich. This is due to greater occurrence of AT—rich
UP elements (speciﬁcally containing oligo A—tracts) in the promoter
regions of the genomes with low %GC, as seen in Supplementary
Figure S2 for B.subtilis (with 43.5% GC) as well as in promoter
regions of other genomes such as E.c0li (with 50.8% GC). On
the other hand, highly GC—rich genomes lack A—tracts and other
AT—rich tetranucleotides in the vicinity of TSS/T LS (as shown in
Supplementary Fig. S2 for M.tubercul0sis which has 65.6% GC
content) and have smaller variation of tetranucleotide frequencies

in their non—coding regions (Bohlin et al., 2008; Davenport and
Tummler, 2010).

The absence of A—tracts in upstream regions has led to suggestions
that the genomes with high %GC may use different mechanisms
to those mediated by the A—tracts for DNA packing in bacterial
nucleoids (Tolstorukov et al., 2005). The narrow low stability peak at
TLS in Figure 1 for the fragments with high %GC also suggests that
due to the paucity of AT bases in these genomic regions, the few that
are present tend to be localized in close proximity of TSS to facilitate
duplex opening and even upstream TFBSs in these genomes may
be biased toward GC—rich motifs. Hence, the promoter prediction
programs, such as NNPP (Reese, 2001) which are trained on AT—
rich sequence motifs, fail to predict promoter regions in GC—rich
M.tubercul0sis genome (Supplementary Table S2).

4.3 Reﬁnement of threshold value for TLS-based
analysis

In our earlier analysis, we have shown that the promoter regions
from E.c0li, B.subtilis and M.tubercul0sis (with whole—genome
GC content of 50.8, 43.5 and 65.6%, respectively) are in general
less stable than the ﬂanking regions, but their AFE values vary
depending on the GC composition of the genome (Rangannan and
Bansal, 2007). Based on this observation, free energy threshold
values were derived based on the %GC content of an individual
genome to predict promoter regions over whole genome sequences
of the above—mentioned three bacterial systems and found to be
moderately sensitive in identifying promoter regions in the vicinity
of experimentally validated TSSs (Rangannan and Bansal, 2007).
We then enhanced the ‘PromPredict’ algorithm so that it identiﬁes
potential promoter regions based on relative stability of DNA
sequences by applying the threshold values derived by considering
the GC content of genomic regions in the near vicinity of TSSs
(referred to as TSS based cutoff values). Whole— genome annotation
using the TSS—based thresholds resulted in %recall of 59% and
49% for E.c0li and B.subtilis genomes, respectively (Rangannan
and Bansal, 2009). For the GC—rich M. tuberculosis whole—genome
annotation 45% recall was achieved. The free energy threshold
values used to discriminate promoter sequences from coding
sequences were obtained from an analysis of 1001 nt long sequences
(spanning —500 to +500 nt region with respect to the experimentally
identiﬁed TSSs) from the above—mentioned three systems and
encompass the %GC range from ~ 30% to 60% (Rangannan and
Bansal, 2009). When these TSS based threshold values were applied
to carryout whole— genome annotation of promoter regions over 913
microbial genomes, for the genomes with high GC composition
(>65%), the number of predictions with respect to all gene TLSs
were considerably less as compared with genomes with lower GC
content. Consequently, for the genomes with high GC content, the
%recall for promoter prediction was very low in several cases, while
the %precision was low in case of genomes with low GC content
(Supplementary Fig. S3). Hence, it was necessary to rationalize the
cutoff values for the genomic fragments with GC content >60% as
well as <35%. However, experimentally validated TSS information
is not available for genomes with these extreme values of GC
content while annotated TLS data are readily available. Since the
relative distance between the experimentally determined TSS and
corresponding TLS of closest regulated gene in the operons of E. c0li
and B.subtilis shows a maximum at about 20 nt (median distance of

—62 and —39 nt, respectively as shown in Supplementary Fig. S4),
the TSS and TLS in prokaryotic genomes seem to be in close
proximity. Hence, we have re—designed the method for derivation
of threshold values using the available TLS—based training data, in
order to rationalize the predictions of promoter regions in genomes
with very low and very high GC content.

The calculated stability proﬁle for the fragments with varying
%GC content from TLS—based training dataset (shown in Fig. 1)
have features similar to those seen in case of promoter sequences
retrieved with respect to the experimentally validated TSSs from
E.c0li, B.subtilis and M. tuberculosis (TSS dataset) (Rangannan and
Bansal, 2009). Figure 1 also shows the AFE values for E and REaV,
calculated over —80 to +20 region and +100 to +500 region (with
respect to TLS), respectively. Figure 2 illustrates the variation in E
and REE1V values based on %GC for both TSS dataset from E. coli,
B.subtilis and M.tubercul0sis and TLS—based training data. From
Figure 2, it is interesting to see that the values for both E and REaV
from the promoter sequences retrieved with respect to the known
TSSs for above—mentioned three organisms and those retrieved with
respect to the TLS—based training dataset nearly merge, over most of
the GC range for which TSS data are available. The reﬁned threshold
values using the TSS and TLS—based training dataset (given at
bottom of Fig. 2 and termed as TSS—TLS—based thresholds) have
now been assigned to predict promoter regions over the complete
genomic sequences of all 913 prokaryotic genomes, with %GC
content varying between 20% and 80%.

4.4 Promoter prediction analysis

4.4.] Evaluation of prediction results Analysis of prediction
results for 913 microbial genomes on applying TSS—TLS—based
cutoff values (Fig. 3) gives an average 71.7% (0:8.3) recall
value with the %precision being 55.8% (0:60) and F —score of
62.2 (0:4.2). When compared to the results from TSS based
cutoff values (data shown in Supplementary Fig. S3), overall
%recall has improved considerably without signiﬁcantly affecting
the %precision. Interestingly, 70% (a: 15.6) recall has also been
achieved for RNA genes from 901 microbial genomes (12 out
of 913 microbial genomes do not have annotation for RNA
genes). The F —score, which is the harmonic mean of recall and
precision, is higher by ~3% and almost constant irrespective of
the %GC of the genome. The %recall and %precision obtained for
different clades of microbial genomes are shown in Supplementary
Figure S5 as box whisker plots. Signiﬁcantly lower % recall is
seen for Thermotogae phylum (seven genomes with median value
= 48.8) while Bacteriodetes (16 genomes) have highest average
recall (median value = 81.3). Actinobacteria and Spirochaetes phyla
(consisting of 59 genomes with high %GC and 23 genomes with
very low %GC, respectively) have slightly lower precision (median
value ~49) as compared to others. But overall there is only a small
spread in average precision and F —score values among the various
phyla. Though we have considered 500 nt region upstream of gene
TLS to assign TP, it is worth mentioning that majority (~70%) of
our TP predictions are within 150 nt upstream of TLS in all 913
microbial genomes (Supplementary Fig. S6). Comparison of the
%recall versus %precision plots for annotation of promoter regions
in 913 microbial genomes, using TSS based and TSS—TLS—based
cutoff values, indicate that overall the current method of predicting
promoter regions using the TSS—TLS—based cutoff values works

better than the TSS based cutoff values, irrespective of the size of
the genome and its GC content (Supplementary Fig. S7).

The characteristic features of TP and FF predictions were analyzed
in detail in relation to their reliability level, GC content of
the predictions, length of the predictions and for the occurrence
of the universal prokaryotic promoter consensus sequence (refer
Supplementary Figs S8—S11). In general, a higher percentage
of FF promoter signals belong to low reliability category (see
Supplementary Fig. S8 and Section 4.4.2 for details), contain higher
%GC (Supplementary Fig. S9) and are shorter (Supplementary
Fig. S10) as compared with the TP predictions. Also a smaller
number of FF predictions contain the consensus promoter sequence
motifs as compared with TP predictions (Supplementary Fig. S11).
These characteristic features of FP predictions indicate that they
probably correspond to short stretches comprising of AT—rich codons
within the coding region, or weak signals indicative of internal
promoters or antisense RNA promoters (Mendoza—Vargas et al.,
2009). Thus, the DNA stability—based promoter prediction method
can be ﬁne tuned as per user requirement of high precision/reliability
or identiﬁcation of a weak promoter.

Analysis of 1977 TFBSs for E. c0li from Regulon DB (version 6.4,
Last updated on 10th August 2009) (Gama—Castro et al., 2008)
reveals that most of them are AT rich and a majority (~88%) lie
within 300 nt region upstream of the translation start site, of the
ﬁrst transcribed gene in the downstream transcription unit (refer
Supplementary Fig. S 12). About 47% of experimentally determined
TFBSs in E.c0li (42.3% activator sites, 51.2% repressor sites and
52.1% dual regulator sites) are found to overlap with predicted
promoter regions identiﬁed by our method. All of these overlap with
TP predictions and a steady increase is seen in percentage occurrence
of TFBS in predictions from low to high reliability classes.

In our earlier analysis, we have already shown that promoter
prediction by applying the TSS—based cutoff values to E.c0li
genome sequence outperforms the other methods of promoter
prediction based on DNA sequence and structural properties
(Rangannan and Bansal, 2009). We have now compared the
whole—genome annotation of promoter regions in E.c0li, B.subtilis
and M.tubercul0sis using the TSS—TLS—based cutoff values, with
results from sequence—based promoter prediction programs PPP

(http://bioinformatics.biol.rug.nl/websoftware/ppp/ppp_start.php)
and NNPP (Reese, 2001) (refer Supplementary Table S2). Though
the sequence—based methods (especially NNPP) are able to
identify promoter regions for a higher number of genes in case of
E.c0li and B.subtilis, they also identify a larger member of false
positives (which is reﬂected in the lower precision values for these
genomes, as shown in Supplementary Table S2). They also predict
a much smaller number of promoters for the GC—rich genome of
M. tuberculosis, when compared with our method and hence both
have very low recall values for this genome.

A similar anti—correlation is observed between the %GC of the
genome and the percentage of protein coding genes containing
the full consensus promoter sequence (with —35 and —10 motifs
along with the spacer region; refer Supplementary Fig. S13). A
mean recall value of 22.6% is obtained over all 913 genomes.
Interestingly, even if the genes with —10 motif alone are included,
then %recall only improves to 42.3%. These results indicate that
in general the consensus sequence derived for 070 promoters
rarely occurs in upstream regions of genes in GC—rich genomes,
and hence it may be difﬁcult to identify promoters using these
motifs, while our method based on DNA relative stability is
sensitive to a promoter signal irrespective of the genome GC
content (refer for example, to %recall values for genomes belonging
to Actinobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria and
Dein0c0ccus/Thermus, all clades with GC—rich genomes, in
Supplementary Figs S14 and S5A). However, as reported earlier
(Sinoquet et al., 2008) promoter regions in the AT—rich ﬁrmicute
clade show the highest presence of these motifs (~72%) and this
observation is in agreement with our analysis which gives ~74%
mean recall value for this clade.

4.4.2 Classiﬁcation of predictions based on their reliability level
Every predicted promoter region has been classiﬁed by us under
the category of low, medium, high, very high or highest prediction
reliability (refer Section 2). The %recall versus %precision plot
for different reliability classes, along with the mean and SD
values for each case is shown in Figure 4. The prediction classes
with very high and highest reliability (shown in violet and blue
color, respectively) together constitute only a small proportion

Fig. 4. Recall versus precision plots for all predicted promoter regions in
913 microbial genomes, after their classiﬁcation into ﬁve groups, based on
their reliability level (as described in Section 2). When calculating %recall,
if a particular gene has more than one TP with different reliability level, then
only TP with highest prediction reliability is considered. The color code used
to discriminate the predictions under different reliability level is given in top
right corner of the ﬁgure. The tables at bottom give the statistics of these
parameters for each prediction class.

(~15% of total predictions) and hence make a modest contribution
to the TP gene count, as reﬂected in their %recall values of 12.1 and
6.8%, respectively. However, their precision values are very high
(an average of 70 and 81%, respectively), since these predictions
are most often identiﬁed as TP and very rarely occur within the
coding regions (Supplementary Fig. S8). The predictions with low
reliability level (red dots in Fig. 4) are also small in number (~12%
of total predictions) but these are often identiﬁed as FF and very
rarely as TP (Supplementary Fig. S8). Hence both %recall and
%precision values for the low reliability prediction class are small,
as seen in Figure 4. The predictions classiﬁed under medium and
high level have moderate recall and precision.

Thus, the predictions falling in the four reliability categories,
varying from highest to medium, follow a trend from high
precision/low—recall toward low—precision/high—recall, but the
lowest reliability group is an exception. As mentioned above, the
predicted promoter regions categorized as least reliable are quite
small in number and are also very weak in terms of strength,
being only marginally less stable than the ﬂanking regions (as
deﬁned in Section 2). Hence, the probability of their being good
candidate promoters or alternate promoters is expected to be quite
low. Excluding these weak potential promoter regions from the
analysis brings down the average recall value for all 913 genomes to
67% (a = 8%) but improves the average precision to 57% (a = 6%)
as compared with the overall values of 71.7 and 55.8%, respectively
(shown in Fig. 3). This indicates that the method adopted to classify
the predicted region under different reliability levels works very
well. Using this reliability level classiﬁcation scheme, users can
give high priority to the predictions with high reliability level, when

Fig. 5. Analysis of predicted promoters within CODING and various
intergenic regions of microbial genomes. (A) Predicted promoter distribution
in different regions. For this analysis, we have considered all the genes
irrespective of their transcription direction to count the predicted promoter
occurrence within CODING region and hence the %prediction within
CODING is higher than the predictions assigned as false positive (refer
Section 2 for false positive deﬁnition). (B) Predicted promoter region average
length distribution in different regions. (C) Distribution of RPP_DEave, the
average DE values for all predicted promoters within different genomic
regions of microbial genomes. Since similar distribution is observed for
predictions in reverse strand, prediction distribution in forward strand alone
is shown. The color code used and the mean values for the respective
distribution, along with SD values, are also indicated.

organism.

4.4.3 Promoter prediction analysis in diﬂerent regions of genome
The distribution of all predicted promoter regions within tandem
(TAN), divergent (DIV) and convergent (CON) intergenic regions
as well as within CODING regions (those labeled as CDS in the
features table of GenBank ﬁles) was examined in all 913 microbial
genomes and is shown in Figure 5. A salient feature of microbial
genomes is dense packing of genetic elements. On an average,
86.4% (0 :53) of DNA is transcribed as protein or RNA in these
genomes and the number of overlapping genes is also very high
in prokaryotes (Palleja et al., 2008, 2009). Hence, the percentage
occurrence of any sequence or structural motif within the CODING
region is also high. Here, the predicted promoter distribution within
CODING region is considered irrespective of their transcription
direction and hence the %prediction within CODING in Figure 5 is
higher than the predictions assigned as false positive. Overall, about
40% of predictions occur in the intergenic regions, which in general
constitute <15% of the prokaryotic genome. The percentage of
predictions occurring within TAN intergenic regions is high (24.3%)
compared with the other intergenic regions (as seen in Fig. 5A),
which correlates with the larger number of TAN IR in microbial
genomes (Molina and van Nimwegen, 2008).

The predicted promoter region length distribution in different
regions of microbial genome is shown in Figure 5B while Figure 5C
shows the distribution of RPP_DEave, which is the average DE

value for all predicted promoters within different genomic regions
(TAN, DIV, CON IR and CODING regions) of microbial genomes.
It is worth noting that the predicted promoter regions that occur in
CODING region are short in length and exhibit low RPP_DEave
value as compared with the predictions in intergenic regions, which
indicates that predictions within CODING regions are in general
weak signals. In some cases, these may correspond to internal
promoters (Rangannan and Bansal, 2009).

The predicted promoter regions that overlap with divergent (DIV)
intergenic region constitute about 10% of total predictions are longer
and possess higher value for RPP_DEave than the others. This may
be due to the long and AT—rich nature of the DIV intergenic region,
which is essential to embed multiple upstream regulatory signals for
two genes (Rogozin et al., 2002).

About 5% of the predictions overlap with CON intergenic regions.
It has been reported that the rho—independent intrinsic termination
signal motif is a GC—rich dyad symmetry element, followed by
an oligo(T) sequence (d’Aubenton Carafa et al., 1990; Gusarov
and Nudler, 1999). Hence, the CON intergenic region shows a
low stability peak ﬂanked by high stability region, giving a false
positive signal (Rangannan and Bansal, 2009). The predictions
within CON region are overall shorter and weaker as compared with
the predictions within other intergenic regions (Fig. 5B and C) but a
similar trend was observed for the percentage prediction distribution
at different reliability levels in all intergenic regions (Supplementary
Fig. S15A, B and C). However, as mentioned earlier (in Section
4.4.1) the predictions in the CODING region occur more frequently
in the lower reliability level categories (Supplementary Fig. S15D).

5 CONCLUSION

AFE of DNA sequence is a well—deﬁned property that can be used to
distinguish promoter regions in a DNA sequence. The AFE proﬁles
for promoter sequences show a less stable region upstream of the
TLSs (which are generally in close proximity of the TSSs) when
compared with the ﬂanking genomic sequences. The AFE values
in the near vicinity of TSS/T LS as well as in the ﬂanking regions
vary depending on the GC composition of the whole region, but
the relative stability is maintained. These features have been used
to derive threshold values for identifying promoter regions over
whole—genome sequences. Promoter prediction using TSS—TLS—
based cutoff values yields high %recall (an average of 72%), without
signiﬁcantly affecting the precision (average of 55 .8%) when applied
to annotation of 913 microbial genomes. The comparison of recall
and precision parameters obtained when ‘PromPredict’ is applied
to E.c0li, B.subtilis and M.tuberculosis with those obtained using
other sequence—based methods (NNPP and PPP) indicate that overall
our method performs better. The algorithm thus appears to be
robust and applicable to all prokaryotic genomes regardless of
their base composition. The ‘PromPredict’ algorithm and TSS—TLS—
based cutoff values can also be applied to other organisms and
preliminary studies to predict promoter regions in plants as well as
other eukaryotes show very promising results. Further this method
can be combined with sequence motif—based methods and used
along with structural properties such as curvature and bendability to
improve the identiﬁcation of promoter regions in genomes.

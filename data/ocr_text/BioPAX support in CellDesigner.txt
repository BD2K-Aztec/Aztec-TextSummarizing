ABSTRACT

Motivation: BioPAX is a standard language for representing and
exchanging models of biological processes at the molecular and
cellular levels. It is widely used by different pathway databases and
genomics data analysis software. Currently, the primary source of
BioPAX data is direct exports from the curated pathway databases.
It is still uncommon for wet-lab biologists to share and exchange
pathway knowledge using BioPAX. Instead, pathways are usually
represented as informal diagrams in the literature. In order to
encourage formal representation of pathways, we describe a
software package that allows users to create pathway diagrams
using CellDesigner, a user-friendly graphical pathway-editing tool and
save the pathway data in BioPAX Level 3 format.

Availability: The plug-in is freely available and can be downloaded
at ftp://ftp.pantherdb.org/CellDesigner/plugins/BioPAX/

1 INTRODUCTION

Recent efforts to standardize pathway data have greatly facilitated
the interpretation, exchange and integration of pathway knowledge
in a rigorous and unambiguous way. The efforts have led to the
creation of several widely accepted complementary community
standards—Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) (Hucka
et al., 2003), Biological Pathway Exchange (BioPAX) (Demir
et al., 2010) and Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN)
(Le Novere et al., 2009). Both SBML and BioPAX are machine—
readable formats for representing cellular processes. The former is
concentrated on mathematical modeling, while the latter is focused
on qualitative pathway knowledge. SBGN is a standard for graphical
representation of pathways and can be used for Visualizing both
SBML and BioPAX models. BioPAX Level 3 covers a large
spectrum of qualitative information in the literature including
metabolic and signaling pathways as well as molecular and genetic
interactions. As a result, BioPAX is currently supported by >40
different pathway database resources (http://www.pathguide.0rg/),
including MetaCyc (Caspi et al. , 2010), PANTHER (Mi et al. , 2010),

PID (Schaefer et al., 2009) and Reactome (Croft et al., 2011). Most
of these resources generate BioPAX-compliant exchange ﬁles from
the pathway data that are curated by highly trained curators using
specialized curation software. It is still rare for wet-lab biologists
to create and exchange pathway data using such standards. This
creates a bottleneck for pathway knowledge accumulation as the
database groups can only curate a fraction of the enormous amount
of knowledge that is being generated. Extending the usage of formal
machine-readable models, such as BioPAX, to the wider biological
community would signiﬁcantly alleviate this problem and help
pathway databases to cope up with the load (Mi and Thomas, 2011).
Furthermore, wet-lab biologists are the end-users of the pathway
databases, and thus the enrichment of pathway database content will
ultimately beneﬁt their research. The major obstacle so far is the lack
of software tools that can allow biologists to easily transcribe the
pathway knowledge to BioPAX format.

Cytoscape BioPAX plug-in allows users to load and graphically
render BioPAX ﬁles for Visualization. It has been used by a number
of software to import or export BioPAX ﬁles. The plug-in does
not support BioPAX Level 3 yet. CellDesigner (Funahashi et al.,
2008) is a graphical, intuitive pathway-editing software, which
uses controlled graphical notations for Visual representation of the
pathway and supports both SBML and SBGN standard (Hucka et al. ,
2003; Le Novere et al., 2009). It is used in the research community
for generating pathway diagrams with controlled graphical notations
for both wet-lab and systems biologists. Both CellDesigner and
BioPAX describes pathway in terms of biochemical reaction and
process, which is equivalent to SBGN Process Description (SBGN-
PD) standard (Le Novere et al., 2009). The data structures in
CellDesigner and BioPAX are similar but not identical, and we have
developed a mapping between the two. Here, we describe a software
package that allows users to draw or open a pathway diagram in
CellDesigner, and save the data accurately in BioPAX format. Thus,
the software provides the connection between SBML, SBGN—PD
and BioPAX.

2 MAPPING CELLDESIGNER TO BIOPAX LEVEL 3

In this work, the mapping is done between CellDesigner 4.1
and BioPAX Level 3, and refer to them as CellDesigner and
BioPAX, respectively, throughout the rest of the article. Since
CellDesigner supports SBML, our mapping is greatly facilitated by
the existing SBML to BioPAX mappings developed by other groups
(Ruebenacker et al., 2009). The detailed mapping is described in

the Supplementary Data 1 and Table Sl. Here we will only discuss
brieﬂy our general approach of the mapping and our solutions to
some of the issues that we encountered during the mapping. For the
convenience of describing the mapping, all the CellDesigner terms
are in italic, and the BioPAX terms are in italic and underline.

The mapping described here is designed to support the current
development to export CellDesigner symbols to BioPAX ontology
classes. One of our long-term goals is to import BioPAX pathways
to CellDesigner. Although the general principle of the mapping is
to ensure accurate translation of CellDesigner symbols to BioPAX
ontology terms, we are also mindful about the accuracy of the reverse
mapping.

The three main categories of symbols in CellDeigner, Model,
State node symbol (also known as species) and Arcs can be
mapped to Pathway, PhysicialEntity and Interaction in BioPAX,
respectively. The symbols in each category in CellDesigner are
mapped to the corresponding BioPAX subclasses in the following
three approaches. First, a CellDesigner symbol has an exact (or one-
to-one) match to a corresponding BioPAX subclass. Although each
system uses different names, their underlying context and concept
may be identical, e.g. Heteromultimer and State Transition in
CellDeisgner versus Complex and BiochemicalReaction in BioPAX,
respectively. Therefore, a one-to-one mapping can be created.
Second, multiple CellDesigner symbols are mapped to a single
BioPAX subclass, e.g. Ion channel and Generic protein symbols
in CellDesigner are both mapped to Protein in BioPAX. Although
there is loss of data in this case, most of the information can still be
captured through the names (for entities) and the reactions involved
(for transitions arcs). Third, the CellDesigner symbols cannot be
mapped to any corresponding BioPAX subclasses, and therefore
they have to be mapped to the parent class term. For example,
Inhibition and Physical Stimulation in CellDesigner are mapped to
Control in BioPAX, with values such as Inhibition or Activation
associated to ControlType. Loss of data could be an issue in this type
of mapping. In many cases, we tried to ﬁnd ways within BioPAX
to capture the information to minimize the information loss. The
current implementation in the mapping has minimum loss of data
going from CellDesigner to BioPAX. However, we do realize that
the reverse map from BioPAX to CellDesigner is still ambiguous.
The developers of this project are both involved in CellDesigner
and BioPAX development. We are aware of the issues and are
actively working toward a solution to resolve this problem (see
Supplementary Data 1 for more detailed discussions on each case).

3 IMPLEMENTATION

The preliminary work has been implemented in CellDesigner 4.1
release in 2010. Due to the different release cycles of CellDesigner,
BioPAX and our mapping updates, we have decided to implement
the BioPAX translator as a CellDesigner plug-in, so that timely
updates can be released. The existing implementation will be
Obsoleted in the next CellDesigner release.

CellDesigner includes an extensible plug-in system that
allows third-party software to register as plug-ins for additional
functionality. The interface allows any plug-in to retrieve
information such as model, compartments, components and
relationships between components as well as the relationships
between the components and the compartments.

The BioPAX plug—in ﬁrst reads the CellDesigner components
Via the Java plug-in API. It then maps them to the corresponding
BioPAX Level 3 objects deﬁned in the Paxtools, a Java library that
can be used to create BioPAX objects and output the corresponding
model in the OWL/RDF—XML format. The mapping between
CellDesigner and BioPAX is not always one-to-one and the
translator employs some rules and heuristics to resolve ambiguous
mappings. See Supplementary Data 1 for details.

Importantly, the translator also adds cross-references to facilitate
mapping to the external data sources. The translator uses web
services provided by the Ontology Lookup Service to search for
terms such as cellular component (GO database) (Gene Ontology
Consortium, 2010), protein modiﬁcation (PSI-MI) (Kerrien et al.,
2007) and small molecule description (ChEBI) (Degtyarenko et al.,
2008).

The BioPAX ﬁles produced by the plug-in are valid and error-free
(Supplementary Data 1). The plug-in supports CellDesigner 4.1 and
the recently released 4.2. It is freely available and can be downloaded
at: ftp://ftp.pantherdb.org/CellDesigner/plugins/BioPAX/.

See Supplement Data 2 and Figure S3 for details about installation
and use of the tool.

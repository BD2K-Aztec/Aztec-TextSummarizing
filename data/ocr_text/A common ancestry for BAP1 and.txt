ABSTRACT

Summary: To reveal how the polycomb repressive—deubiquitinase
(PR—DUB) complex controls substrate selection specificity, we
undertook a detailed computational sequence analysis of its
components: additional sex combs like 1 (ASXL1) and BRCA1-
associated protein 1 (BAP1) proteins. This led to the discovery of
two previously unrecognized domains in ASXL1: a forkhead (winged-
helix) DNA-binding domain and a deubiquitinase adaptor domain
shared with two regulators of ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase
37 (Uch37), namely adhesion regulating molecule 1 (ADRM1) and
nuclear factor related to kappaB (NFRKB). Our analysis demonstrates
a common ancestry for BAP1 and Uch37 regulators in PR—DUB,
|N080 chromatin remodelling and proteosome complexes.

1 INTRODUCTION

BRCAl—associated protein 1 (BAP1) and ubiquitin carboxyl—
terminal hydrolase 37 (Uch37) (also known as UCHL5) are two
deubiquitinating proteases (DUBs) from the same peptidase family
that share a high degree of sequence similarity not only in their
catalytic ubiquitin carboxy—terminal hydrolase (UCH) domain but
also in an additional conserved carboxy—terminal region, previously
called the Uch37—like domain (ULD) (Misaghi et al., 2009; Yao
et al., 2006).

The controlled removal of ubiquitin or ubiquitin—like proteins
by DUBs is required in diverse cellular processes. The catalytic
domains of DUBs often require adapter domains to control the
speciﬁcity of substrate selection and thus to avoid cleavage of
inappropriate substrates (Komander et al., 2009).

The human PR—DUB complex contains BAP1 and additional sex
combs like 1 (ASXLl). The PR—DUB complex represses polycomb
group target genes by removing monoubiquitin from histone H2A
in nucleosomes. Recently, it was found that the ASXLl N—terminal
region (residues 2—365) is essential for its interaction with BAP1,
although the domains responsible for this interaction have been
determined in neither ASXLl nor BAP1 protein sequences (Bott
et al., 2011; Scheuermann et al., 2010).

The PR—DUB complex has increasingly attracted medical interest
as somatic mutations in ASXLl frequently occur in different

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

myelodysplastic syndromes (Bejar et al., 2011; Boultwood et al.,
2010; Carbuccia et al., 2009; Gelsi—Boyer et al., 2009; Hellstrdm—
Lindberg, 2010). ASXLl mutations have been also associated
with glioblastoma, ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma, cervical and
colon cancer (Bell et al., 2011; McLendon et al., 2008; Scotto et al.,
2008; Williams et al., 2010).

De novo nonsense mutations in human ASXLl have also been
recently associated with Bohring—Opitz syndrome (also known as
Oberklaid—Danks or C—like syndromes), characterized by severe
intellectual disability, distinctive facial features and multiple
congenital malformations (Hoischen et al., 2011).

Human ASXLl belongs to a family of three vertebrate paralogues
(Fisher et al., 2003, 2006; Katoh and Katoh, 2003, 2004) and it
is orthologous to Drosophila Asx (additional sex combs), whose
product is required for long—term repression of HOX genes during
development and whose mutants enhance homeotic phenotypes of
both polycomb and trithorax mutations (Breen and Duncan, 1986;
Milne et al., 1999; Sinclair et al., 1992). Mouse ASXLl is required
for normal hematopoiesis and its knockout results in simultaneous
anterior and posterior transformations of the axial skeleton (Fisher
et al., 2010a, b).

In addition, several lines of evidence suggest that ASXLl has a
genuine transcription factor role by regulating retinoic acid receptors
and peroxisome proliferator—activated receptors (Cho et al., 2006;
Lee et al., 2010; Park et al., 2011). ASX proteins have been
previously reported to contain two evolutionarily conserved regions
in metazoa, from ﬂy to humans: a region termed the ASX homology
(ASXH) domain and a C—terminal plant homeo domain (PHD) zinc
ﬁnger (Fisher et al., 2003, 2006).

However, with the exception of its C—terminal PHD domain,
signiﬁcant sequence similarity was not detected with any other
known protein domain. In order to trace its evolutionary history and
to identify functional domains, we embarked on a computational
protein sequence analysis of the ASX protein family.

2 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

2.1 Computational protein sequence analysis.
The DEUBiquitinase ADaptor domain

Our iterative proﬁle—based database searches identiﬁed previously
unreported homologues of ASXLl in fungi and land plants.
Animal ASX HMMer3 (Finn et al., 2011) proﬁle searches
(based on Supplementary Figure 81 multiple sequence alignment
corresponding to the ASXH conserved region) revealed ASX
homologues in fungi, identifying the Aspergillus fumigatus
(UniProtzQ4WDB 3_ASPFU) sequence with an E —Value (HMMer3—
best ﬁrst domain) of 3.5 X 10—4.

Fig. 1. Domain architecture of DEUBAD domain—containing proteins and their known and predicted interactions with BAP1 and Uch37 DUBs.

Experimentally determined interactions are shown with brown arrows corresponding to: A) An ASXLI N—terminal region (amino acids 2 to 365) interacts with
full length BAPI (Scheuermann 61611., 2010; Bott at 611., 2011); B) The thnl3/ADRM l ULD—interacting region was localised to its second domain (amino
acids 278—391), here termed its DEUBAD domain (Hamazaki et 611., 2006; Yao et 611., 2006; Qiu et 611., 2006; Chen et 611., 2010); and C) The Uch37 ULD—
interacting region of NFRKB was localised to its ﬁrst 465 residues (Yao e1 611., 2008). Summary of the experimental evidences supporting each interaction:
Scheuermann e1 611., 2010: Reconstituted complex in humans and Afﬁnity Capture—Westem for D. melanogaster orthologs (ASX and Calypso). Bott e1 611.,
2011: Coimmunoprecipitation. Hamazaki etal., 2006: Afﬁnity Capture—Westem and reconstituted complexes. Yao e1611., 2006: Yeast two—hybrid conﬁrmed by

Effect) interactions. Yao e1 611., 2008: Anti tag coimmunoprecipitation and reconstituted complexes. Purple arrows indicate predicted interactions between

DEUBAD domains and C—terminal ULDs in BAPI and Uch37 DUBs.

These approaches, however, failed to identify potential ASX
orthologues in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans or
in yeasts (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces
pombe). A proﬁle derived from animal and fungal ASX sequences
identiﬁed the Arabidopsis 1116111611161 subfamily IV of GATA zinc
ﬁngers (Manﬁeld 61611., 2007): GATA27 (Tair:At5g47140, UniProt:
Q5PP38) and GATA26 (TairzAt4g17570, UniProt: Q8W4H1) with
E—values of 1.6 X 10—4 and 2.3 X 10—4, respectively.

Consistent with the conservation of the Polycomb H2A
ubiquitination machinery in plants (Bratzel at 611., 2010; Sanchez—
Pulido at 611., 2008), the ﬁnding of ASX and BAP1 homologues
in Arabidopsis suggests that the histone H2A deubiquitination
machinery (PR—DUB complex) could also be conserved between
plants and animals.

During a search for more remote evolutionary relationships,
we were surprised to ﬁnd statistically signiﬁcant similarities
with ASXLl for two further human proteins. HMMer3 proﬁle
searches using the ASX family proﬁle (corresponding to
Supplementary Figure S1 multiple sequence alignment marked with

the red bar) revealed the arthropod Pediculus humanus (UniProt:
EOVM25_PEDHC) sequence (which is a known orthologue of
the human NFRKB protein) with an E —value of 0.0073. The
ASX/NFRKB proﬁle (based on Supplementary Figure S1 multiple
sequence alignment marked with the red and yellow bars) localized
the Trichoplax adhaerens (UniProt: B3S476_TRIAD) sequence (a
known orthologue of the human ADRMl protein) with an E —value
of 0.0067. In addition, proﬁle—versus—proﬁle comparisons (using
HHpred) (Soding at 611., 2005) conﬁrm the previously described
evidences of sequence similarity among these families: the proﬁle
of the ASX family identiﬁed the NFRKB and ADRMl families
with E —values of 2 X 10—7 and 5 X 10—6, respectively. Statistically
signiﬁcant E —values of sequence similarity connected these human
ASXL1,2,3, NFRKB and ADRMl proteins and reciprocal searches
produced convergent results; no further human homologues were
identiﬁed.

NFRKB is a subunit of the INO80 chromatin—remodeling complex
(Conaway and Conaway, 2009; Papamichos—Chronakis 61611., 2011;
Yao at 611., 2008). The region of NFRKB that we observe to

Common ancestry for BAP1 and Uch37 regulators

 

be homologous to ASXL1 is located within a region previously
described as binding the C—terminal Uch37 ULD (Fig. 1). The second
human protein homologous to ASXL1 is ADRMl, whose tertiary
structure shows it to consist of a bundle of eight alpha—helices (Chen
et 611., 2010). ADRMl is a proteasome subunit that serves as a
receptor for both ubiquitin and Uch37 (Chen et 611., 2010; Hamazaki
et 611., 2006; Qiu et 611., 2006; Yao et 611., 2006). Again, this ADRMl
region is known to bind the C—terminal Uch37 ULD and hence
was initially called the Uch37—binding domain (Yao et 611., 2006).
However, owing to its afﬁnity for a speciﬁc portion (the ULD of
Uch37) and its presence as a DEUBiquitinase ADaptor (DEUBAD)
domain in other proteins, we term these DEUBAD domains. The
presence of the DEUBAD domain in ASXL1 and its presence within
a region known to interact with BAP1 (Scheuermann et 611., 2010)
strongly implicates the ASXL1 DEUBAD domain in binding to the
C—terminal BAP1 ULD (Fig. 1).

2.2 Identifying a putative DNA-BINDING domain

Although these observations help to explain how the ASXL1
DEUBAD domain regulates BAP1 deubiquitinase activity within
PR—DUB, they fail to explain the proposed transcription factor
function of ASXL1 (Cho et 611., 2006; Lee et 611., 2010; Park
et 611., 2011). To do this, we turned to the region N—terminal of the
ASXL1 DEUBAD domain whose sequence is well conserved among
diverse metazoa from vertebrates to cnidarians such as Nematostella
vectensis, although not in Drosophila melanogaster (Supplementary
Fig. S2).

Using the HHpred server (Soding et 611., 2005), the proﬁle
generated for the conserved ASXL1 N—terminal region matched
the forkhead domain of FOXOl protein (PDB—IDz3coa) (Brent
et 611., 2008) with a signiﬁcant E—value of 0.028 (estimated error
rate <8%). Moreover, in support of the ﬁrst match, the next
ﬁve most statistically signiﬁcant matches are members of the
forkhead superfamily of transcription factors (AFX, PDB—ID:1e17,
E —value = 0.089; FOXKla, PDB—IDz2c6y, E —value = 0.16; FOXO4,
PDB—ID:3l2c, E—value = 0.35 and; NF3G, PDB—ID: 1vtn, E —value =
0.68) (Boura et 611., 2010; Clark et 611., 1993; Tsai et 611., 2006). The
consistency of secondary structure predictions and corroboration
by proﬁle—to—proﬁle comparison (HHpred) methods, taken together
provide strong evidence that animal ASX proteins contain a forkhead
domain located at their N—termini.

By inspecting previously characterized forkhead domain
structures in interaction with DNA (Brent et 611., 2008; Boura et 611.,
2010; Clark et 611., 1993; Stroud et 611., 2006; Tsai et 611., 2006), we
identiﬁed two types of positions whose conservation would be in
agreement with a DNA—binding role for the ASXL1 forkhead domain
(Supplementary Fig. S2): (i) residues that have been implicated in
non—speciﬁc DNA binding (DNA backbone contacts) are indicated
by blue triangles above the alignment and (ii) indicated with
black triangles and boxes are two residues located in alpha—helix 3
(Asn51 and His61; human ASXL1) which correspond to Asn165 and
His169 of HNF3G (Clark et 611., 1993) that are predicted to confer
DNA—binding sequence speciﬁcity (major groove DNA contacts).

In agreement with a DNA—binding role for the ASXL1 forkhead
domain, candidate ASX orthologues from plants contain, rather than
a forkhead domain, a different, GATA zinc ﬁnger DNA—binding
domain at their N—termini (Supplementary Fig. S2) (subfamily IV

of Arabidopsis thaliana GATA zinc ﬁngers; GATA26 and GATA27)
(Manﬁeld et 611., 2007).

The human ASXL1 protein, therefore, likely binds DNA through
its N—terminal forkhead domain thereby conferring DNA sequence
speciﬁcity to the PR—DUB complex activity of histone H2A
deubiquitination. In a similar manner, a forkhead domain that has
recently been identiﬁed in the trithorax protein ASH2L appears to
link sequence—speciﬁc DNA binding to histone H3K4 methylation
(Chen et 611., 2011; Sarvan et 611., 2011).

Although we were ﬁnalizing this article, a bioinformatic analysis
of ASXL1 was published (Aravind and Iyer, 2012), mainly
focused on the identiﬁcation of the N—terminal winged helix—turn—
helix/forkhead domain. Our article is consistent with this report, but
further extends the ASX family analysis by showing the structural
and functional predictions for the DEUBAD domain.

3 CONCLUSION

In summary, the computational identiﬁcation of the DEUBAD
and forkhead domains in the human ASXL1 protein should now
greatly assist in experimentally delineating its critical function in
regulating the histone code under non—pathological and pathological
conditions.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Recent advances in technology have dramatically
increased the availability of protein—protein interaction (PPI) data and
stimulated the development of many methods for improving the sys-
tems level understanding the cell. However, those efforts have been
significantly hindered by the high level of noise, sparseness and highly
skewed degree distribution of PPI networks. Here, we present a novel
algorithm to reduce the noise present in PPI networks. The key idea of
our algorithm is that two proteins sharing some higher-order topo-
logical similarities, measured by a novel random walk-based proced-
ure, are likely interacting with each other and may belong to the same
protein complex.

Results: Applying our algorithm to a yeast PPI network, we found that
the edges in the reconstructed network have higher biological rele-
vance than in the original network, assessed by multiple types of in-
formation, including gene ontology, gene expression, essentiality,
conservation between species and known protein complexes.
Comparison with existing methods shows that the network recon-
structed by our method has the highest quality. Using two independ-
ent graph clustering algorithms, we found that the reconstructed
network has resulted in significantly improved prediction accuracy of
protein complexes. Furthermore, our method is applicable to PPI net-
works obtained with different experimental systems, such as affinity
purification, yeast two-hybrid (Y 2H) and protein-fragment complemen-
tation assay (PCA), and evidence shows that the predicted edges are
likely bona fide physical interactions. Finally, an application to a human
PPI network increased the coverage of the network by at least 100%.

1 INTRODUCTION

Recent advances in high-throughput techniques, such as yeast
two-hybrid (Y2H) and tandem affinity puriﬁcation, have enabled
the production of a large amount of protein—protein interaction
(PPI) data (Gavin et al., 2006; Krogan et al., 2006; Tarassov et
al., 2008; Yu et al., 2008). These PPI data can be modelled by
networks, where nodes in networks represent proteins and edges
between the nodes represent physical interactions between pro-
teins. These networks, together with other high-throughput

functional genomics data, are offering unprecedented opportu-
nities for both biological and computational scientists to under-
stand the cell at a systems level (Przulj, 2011). For example,
global analysis of PPI networks has revealed important connec-
tions between topology and function (Han et al., 2004; Jeong
et al., 2001; Yu et al., 2007). PPI networks have also been used
for predicting gene functions, functional pathways or protein
complexes, with both supervised and unsupervised methods
(Asthana et al., 2004; Bader and Hogue, 2002; Chua et al.,
2006; Friedel et al., 2009; King et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2008;
Sharan et al., 2007; Ulitsky and Shamir, 2009; Wang et al.,
2007a; Wang et al., 2010). Furthermore, much effort has been
devoted recently towards incorporating PPI networks to obtain a
better mechanistic understanding of complex diseases and to im-
prove the diagnosis and treatment of diseases (Chuang et al.,
2007; Hannum et al., 2009; Hidalgo et al., 2009; Ideker and
Sharan, 2008; Kim et al., 2011).

However, the growing size and complexity of PPI networks
poses multiple challenges to biologists. First, PPI networks often
have a high false-positive rate and an even higher false-negative
rate (Huang et al., 2007). Second, PPI networks are typically
sparse, partially because of the high false-negative rate, which
places a hurdle for algorithms that rely on neighbour informa-
tion, for example, in gene function prediction (Chua et al., 2006;
Sharan et al., 2007). Third, PPI networks are known to have
skewed degree distribution, meaning that they have more than
expected quantity of hub genes. Such hub nodes can often reduce
the performance of existing graph theoretic algorithms (e.g. for
predicting protein complexes) that were often designed for net-
works with relatively uniform degree distributions.

In this article, we present a novel method to improve the qual-
ity of a given PPI network by computationally predicting some
new interactions and removing spurious edges. It is worth noting
that our idea is purely based on the topology of the network,
with no additional biological information involved. This ensures
that our algorithm can be easily combined with other algorithms
that have already been developed for predicting protein com-
plexes or performing PPI-based studies. There are also several
studies that attempt to combine additional biological informa-
tion, such as gene ontology and gene expression, with PPI net-
work for protein complex prediction (Asthana et al., 2004;
Ulitsky and Shamir, 2009; Wang et al., 2010). It should be
straightforward to use our method in these approaches, by repla-
cing the PPI network with our reconstructed PPI network.

To assess the performance of our algorithm, we tested it on
three yeast PPI networks obtained with different experimental
systems, and we examined the biological relevance of the results

using multiple information sources, including gene ontology an-
notations, gene expression data, protein complexes, list of essen-
tial genes, conservation between species and a large collection of
known physical interactions in the BioGRID database. Results
show that the predicted PPIs have much higher functional rele-
vance than the removed ones, and they are likely bona ﬁde phys-
ical interactions. Comparison with several existing methods
shows that the network reconstructed by our method has the
highest overall quality. Furthermore, applying two independent
graph clustering algorithms, we found that the reconstructed
network has resulted in signiﬁcantly improved prediction accur-
acy of protein complexes. Finally, an application to a human PPI
network shows encouraging results.

2 METHODS

2.1 Rationale and related works

In recent years, many computational methods have been developed to
predict missing links from networks (Fouss et al., 2007; Li and Horvath,
2007; Ruan and Zhang, 2006; Radicchi et al., 2004; Tong et al., 2006),
and reviewed in (L11 and Zhou, 2011), some of which have been success-
fully applied to PPI networks. These methods basically fall into two
categories: common neighbour based and distance based. The ﬁrst type
of methods is based on a simple yet effective idea—two nodes sharing
many common neighbours are likely in the same module (Li and
Horvath, 2007; Ruan and Zhang, 2006; Radicchi et al., 2004; Wang
et al., 2007a). These methods may have limited value on PPI networks
that are usually sparse. To circumvent this problem, Fang et al. (2011)
generalized the idea to consider neighbours of greater path lengths and
showed that the so-called ‘global geometric afﬁnity’ (GGA) measurement
can help predict new PPI.

The second type of methods measures the ‘distance’ between pairs of
nodes in the network taking into consideration all alternative paths;
popular examples include two algorithms based on random walks,
namely, Euclidean commute time (ECT) (Fouss et al., 2007) and
random walk with restart (RWR) (Tong et al., 2006). ECT measures
the expected number of steps needed for a random walker to travel be-
tween two nodes as the distance between them, whereas RWR computes
the probability for a random walker starting from node i to reach another
node j. Performance of this type of methods may be signiﬁcantly affected
by hub nodes that are connected to many nodes in the network. Another
method falling into this category is because of Kuchaiev et al. (2009),
where they attempted to embed a PPI network into a low dimensional
geometric space using multiple dimensional scaling (MDS), and assign
edges to pairs of nodes that have short distances in the embedded space.
While good performance was observed, this method may not work very
well in general as it may not always be easy to ﬁnd an accurate geometric
embedding for a given PPI network.

In this work, we propose a novel method that can be considered as a
generalization of the simple common neighbour-based method, combin-
ing ideas from the distance-based method. We hypothesize that two
nodes having similar ‘distances’ (in the view of a random walker) to all
other nodes in the network can potentially interact with each other. This
idea is more general than the aforementioned two types of methods be-
cause it can not only predict links that are covered by the aforementioned
two types of methods but can also predict links between nodes that are
themselves far away from each other (for a random walker) and do not
share any common neighbours. The basic idea of our method consists of
three steps and is illustrated in Figure 1. First, a topological proﬁle, which
measures the ‘distances’ between a target node and all other nodes in the
network, is calculated for each node. Second, similarities of topological
proﬁles are calculated between every pair of nodes. In the ﬁnal step, edges

are created to connect nodes that are topologically similar. The frame-
work is general, and each step can have multiple designing choices. Here,
we propose a novel random walk procedure for computing topological
proﬁles, which can handle hub nodes better than the existing random
walk-based methods. We use simple ideas for the other two steps, leaving
room for future improvements.

2.2 Random walk with resistance

Let G(V, E) be an undirected graph representing a PPI network, with V
the set of nodes and E the set of edges (for convenience, a self-loop is also
added for each node). For v e V, let N(v) = {u e V|{v, u} e E} be the set
of neighbours of v and d(v) = lN(v)l the degree of v.

The simple random walk for one node on a graph G is a walk on G
where the next node is chosen uniformly at random from the set of
neighbours of the current node. Formally, when the random walker is
at node i, the probability for her to move in the next step to the neighbour
j is Pi]- = l /d(i) for {i, j} e E and 0 otherwise. Assume that a random walk
is initiated at a node v. Let  be the probability for the random walker
sitting at node i at a discrete time point k. Then, at time point k + l, the
probability for the random walker taking the path from node i to node j
can be calculated as

v,ij _ v,l U9

k+l) _ (k) 

and the probability for the random walker to reach node j at time point
k + 1 can be calculated as

as” = Z 92;”. <2>
I

It is important to note that, under some mild conditions, with this
simple random walk, the probability to reach node j, qw, converges to
the same value regardless of the starting point v (Lovasz, 1993).
Therefore, the stationary probability distribution obtained from the
simple random walk cannot be used directly to measure distance between
nodes. To provide a measurement of the distance between two nodes in a
network, several modiﬁcations have been proposed. For example, ECT
measures the expected number of hops needed to travel between two
nodes in the simple random walk (Fouss et al., 2007), whereas RWR
attempts to bias the random walk to stay close to the starting node by
teleporting the random walker to the starting node with a certain prob-
ability (Tong et al., 2006).

Here, we describe a random walk algorithm, named random walk with
resistance (R WS), based on two key ideas: (i) we bias the random walker
towards staying close to the starting point by adding a small amount of

resistance on each edge of the network, and (ii) we introduce a condition
to discourage the random walker from roaming into new territories via
hub nodes, by adding additional resistance for a random walker to over-
come when meeting a new node that she has never visited before. The
algorithm can be best described as a modiﬁcation to the simple random
walk algorithm. Basically, we replace Equation (1) by

max(0, qgkgPU — 6), if qgkj). > 0;
k+1) : ’ ’

my" max(0,  — e), if  = 0 max,(q(vl,‘3P,j) Z ,8; (3)
0, otherwise.

The probability of reaching node j at time point k + l is then calcu-
lated by adding up the probabilities to enter j from all paths, and
re-normalized so that the probability vector sums to l:

1293‘” = Zfl’fi’V 2 ft” (4)
i it

As in Equation (3), the algorithm ﬁrst checks whether a destination
node, j, is new to the random walker. If not, that is,  > 0, the random
walker will visit the node with probability Pi,- — e. The probability will
be set to 0 if it is <0. Combined with the normalization step, the purpose
of introducing the e parameter is similar to the teleporting idea in RWR
that biases the random walker to stay close to the starting node, so that
the stationary probability vectors for different starting nodes are not
always converged to the same values.

If the node j is new to the random walker, then an additional param-
eter, ,8, is introduced to discourage the random walker from visiting the
new node, unless there is at least one path for v to enter j with sufﬁciently
large probability. The main motivation for this step is to reduce the
impact of hub nodes in the random walk process. Imagining that without
the ,8 parameter, a random walker reaching a hub node will be able to
travel, with the same probability, to all other nodes that are connected
with the hub nodes, which may or may not be functionally related to the
starting node. In contrast, with our algorithm, given the same scenario,
the random walker would selectively prefer the nodes that are not only
connected to the hub nodes but are also connected with the starting node
via some alternative paths not involving the hub nodes. (See
Supplementary Fig. S1 for a toy example).

In our experiment, 6 is set to |V|/ |E|2 and ,8 is set to l / |E|. This choice
is based on an analysis of the minimum and average value of fv, i,- on each
edge. Empirically, we have found that these two values perform well on
multiple, both biological and non-biological, networks. Variations of
these two values within a constant multiple do not signiﬁcantly change
the results.

The aforementioned procedure is applied iteratively for each starting
node. A random walker is considered to have reached its stationary dis-
tribution when the change of its probability to arrive at any node is less
than a small cut-off value. In our experiment, all nodes converged in 5—20
iterations, which only took a few minutes on a personal computer.

2.3 Calculating topological similarity

After applying the aforementioned random walk procedure to the
network, we have a |V| X |V| probability matrix, denoted as
111 = (10,, j)|V|X|V|, where 10L,- represents the probability for a random
walker started at node i to reach node j at convergence.

To magnify the difference between probability vectors from different
nodes, we ﬁrst obtain the median vector H from all the vectors, where the
j-th element of H is deﬁned as Hj=median (IA-:1qu j). This median prob-
ability vector is similar to the stationary probability vector for the simple
random walk. We then calculate the WI X |V| offset matrix 8, where
Oyzlllij—Hj.

Finally, we calculate the Pearson correlation coefﬁcient between each
pair of rows or columns of the offset matrix as a measurement of topo-
logical similarity, C,-,-, between nodes. Empirically, we have found that

using columns of the offset matrix as topological proﬁles, that is, letting
CijzpCC(®1~|V|,j, ®1~|V|,J‘), works slightly better than rows. Informally
speaking, a row vector represents the information passed from a node
to all nodes in the network, whereas a column vector represents the in-
formation that a node receives from the network; therefore, the latter is a
more accurate way of describing the position of the node in the network.

2.4 Reconstructing PPI network

Finally, a network is reconstructed from the topological similarity matrix
by connecting pairs of nodes whose similarity is above a certain thresh-
old. Although more sophisticated methods are possible (e.g. Ruan, 2009),
in this article, we choose to implement a simple strategy for easy evalu-
ation and fair comparison to other methods: we simply pick a cut-off
value so that the number of edges can be kept the same as in the original
network. We will show that this simple strategy worked well. In Section 4,
we discuss some future plans in improving cut-off selection, which should
further improve the quality of the reconstructed network, and particu-
larly, reduce the false-negative rate of PPI networks.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

For evaluation, we applied our algorithm to three yeast PPI
networks obtained from different technologies: tandem-afﬁnity
puriﬁcation (Krogan et al., 2006), Y2H (Yu et al., 2008) and
protein-fragment complementation assay (Tarassov et al.,
2008). In Sections 3.1—3.3, we discuss results on the Krogan
dataset, which is the largest, and in Sections 3.4 and 3.5, we
present some comparative analysis of the three datasets. In
Section 3.6, we present an application to a human PPI network.

3.1 Reconstructed PPI network has better functional
relevance

We performed a random walk on the Krogan PPI network,
which covers 2708 genes with 7123 edges, and derived a modiﬁed
PPI network by choosing 7123 potential connections with the
highest similarities (see Section 2). Within the modiﬁed network,
2870 (40%) edges are new (and the same number of edges in the
original network has been removed). To evaluate the functional
relevance of the newly predicted edges, we resort to several types
of sources, including gene ontology, gene expression, essentiality,
known protein complexes and conservation of interactions in
other species. To facilitate discussion, we call the group of
edges present in the original network ‘before’ group, and that
in the modiﬁed network ‘after’ group. Furthermore, ‘new’ edges
designate the edges that are in ‘after’ but not ‘before’ group,
‘removed’ edges are ‘before’ but not ‘after’. Finally, those present
in both ‘before’ and ‘after’ are called ‘conﬁrmed’. We also gen-
erated random networks with a randomly rewiring procedure
that preserves the degree of each node (Ruan and Zhang, 2008).

As interacting proteins are likely involved in similar biological
processes, they are expected to have similar functional annota-
tions in gene ontology and similar gene expression patterns
across diverse conditions. Therefore, we measure the functional
relevance between any pair of genes that are connected by an
edge using the semantic similarity between the GO terms anno-
tated with the proteins, using a popular method (Wang et al.,
2007b; Yu et al., 2010). Results shown are based on the ‘molecu-
lar function’ branch of Gene Ontology. Using ‘biological pro-
cess’ yielded similar values, and ‘cellular localization’ resulted in

slightly lower but consistent values (Supplementary Fig. S2).
We also measured the Pearson correlation coefﬁcient between
the gene expression proﬁles of every pair of genes, using the
yeast stress response microarray data (Gasch et al., 2000). We
used the average similarity of the pairs of nodes connected by an
edge in a certain group to represent the functional relevance of
that edge group. As shown in Figure 2a, the after group has a
higher functional relevance than the before group based on both
GO and gene expression. Moreover, the conﬁrmed group has the
highest functional similarity compared with the other groups,
and the removed group is far lower than the new group. The
standard error of these average measurements are all <10_5;
therefore, these differences are highly signiﬁcant. Further inves-
tigation showed that the GO-based similarity is >0.95 for 36%
and 32% of the edges in the conﬁrmed and new groups, respect-
ively. In contrast, only 7% of removed edges have a GO-based
similarity >0.95 (Fig. 2b).

Next, we used essential genes to compare different edge
groups. The list of essential genes in yeast is retrieved from the
Saccharomyces Genome Database (Dwight et al., 2004). As two
interacting proteins may belong to the same protein complex,
they tend to have the same essentiality. In other words, if one
is (not) essential, the other is also expected to be (not) essential.
As shown in Figure 2a, the percentage of the removed edges that
share the same essentiality is actually lower than that of the
randomly generated edges, which suggests that the removed
edges are probably connecting genes in different complexes

(also see Section 3.2). In contrast, the measurement for the
new edges is close to that of the conﬁrmed PPIs.

We also looked at the conservation of the edges in other spe-
cies. We downloaded conserved PPIs between yeast and four
species including Caenorhabditis elegans, ﬁy, mouse and human
from InteroLogFinder (http://www.interologﬁnder.org/) (Wiles
et al., 2010). As shown in Figure 2c, a considerable fraction of
conﬁrmed edges are conserved in at least two other species.
Although a small fraction of the removed edges are conserved
in one or two species, they are rarely conserved in more than two
species. In comparison, the new edges tend to be more conserved
than the removed edges, although not as much as the conﬁrmed
ones. The conservation analysis also suggests that the predicted
edges are bona ﬁde physical interactions rather than functional
links (see also Section 3.5).

Finally, it has been shown that genes with high connectivity in
the PPI network tend to be more essential, but it is also known
that connectivity and essentiality (percentage of genes that are
essential) are only weakly correlated (Jeong et al., 2001). For
example, Figure 1d shows that although the essentiality of
genes is generally increasing for genes with low to intermediate
degrees, the essentiality of genes with the highest degrees is rela-
tively lower than expected by their degrees. Besides several pos-
sible explanations, it may be that some of the proteins with the
highest degrees may be ‘sticky’ in the sense that they may seem to
interact with many proteins under the experimental protocol, but
these interactions do not exist in reality because the protein is

poorly expressed or not co-expressed with the proteins they can
potentially interact with. It can be seen that in the reconstructed
network, essentiality and degree have a much better correlation
(Fig. 2d).

In summary, using multiple independent sources of evidence,
we have shown that the new edges have clearly higher functional
relevance than the removed ones. These results suggest that our
algorithm can indeed reduce the noise in PPI network and im-
prove the network quality.

3.2 Reconstructed PPI network improves accuracy of
protein complex prediction

We investigated whether the improved PPI network can also
improve the prediction accuracy of protein complexes. We
applied two network clustering algorithms to the original and
modiﬁed PPI networks, and compared the predicted complexes
with the MIPS known protein complexes (Mewes et al., 2006),
which included 767 proteins in 170 known complexes after inter-
secting with the PPI network. Markov Clustering Algorithm
(MCL) is a well-known graph clustering algorithm and has
been shown to outperform other protein complex prediction al-
gorithms in two independent evaluation studies (Brohee and van
Helden, 2006; Vlasblom and Wodak, 2009). Hcht is a commu-
nity discovery algorithm developed by one of the co-authors,
based on the optimization of a so—called modularity function
(Ruan and Zhang, 2008). For MCL, we set the inﬂation param-
eter to 1.8 as suggested by others (Brohee and van Helden, 2006).
Hcht does not require any user-tuned parameters. To measure
the accuracy of the prediction, we used the Fowlkes—Mallows
index for comparing clustering (Fowlkes and Mallows, 1983;
Meila, 2005). Formally, let A be the list of gene pairs that fall
into the same complex in the set of predicted complexes and B
that in the set of known complexes, the prediction accuracy is
measured by |A (1 Bl /,/|A| x |B|, where |A| denotes the cardin-
ality of the set A. As shown in Figure 3a, the prediction accuracy
is signiﬁcantly improved for both MCL and Hcht, demonstrat-
ing that the improvement is general. Moreover, as the MIPS
database of known protein complexes only covers <30% of
the proteins in the PPI network, we measured the average pair-
wise functional similarity using gene ontology semantic similarity
and co-expression (see Section 3.1) between every pair of nodes
that are predicted to be in the same complex. Again, it is shown
that the results are improved signiﬁcantly in the modiﬁed net-
work for both MCL and Hcht (Fig. 3a).

To further investigate why the reconstructed network can
result in better prediction accuracy of protein complexes, we dir-
ectly compared different edge groups for the fraction of edges
that are connecting genes in the same known complex
(in-complex) versus those that are in different known complexes
(between-complex). Indeed, as shown in Figure 3b, the new edges
have much higher in-complex probability and lower between-
complex probability compared with the removed edges, whereas
the conﬁrmed edges have the highest in-complex probability and
lowest between-complex probability. Therefore, it is likely that
the reconstructed PPI network can be combined with any exist-
ing protein complex prediction algorithm and improves its ac-
curacy. Figure 4 shows the changes to the PPI network relevant
for two known protein complexes. The prediction for the Arp2/ 3

predictions. Each prediction is then evaluated by its similarity (F—M
index, see main text) to MIPS known complexes, by the average gene
ontology similarity between pairs of nodes in the same complex, or by
average gene co-expression correlation between pairs of nodes in the same
complex. In (b), different edge groups are evaluated for the fraction of
edges connecting edges in the same or different MIPS known protein
complexes

complex is improved in the after network, because connectivity is
increased within the complex, and many between-complex edges
are removed. Interestingly, for the anaphase—promoting complex
(APC) complex, our algorithm not only removed several external
edges and added many in-complex edges but also predicted inter-
actions between a non-member protein, MND2 and the complex
members. It turns out that MND2 is indeed a member of the
APC complex (Hall et al., 2003).

3.3 Comparisons with previous methods

We compared our algorithm with four existing methods, namely,
ECT (Fouss et al., 2007), RWR (Tong et al., 2006), MDS
(Kuchaiev et al., 2009) and GGA (Fang et al., 2011). The ECT
and RWR methods are well known in data mining and network
analysis communities, whereas the MDS and GGA methods
were recently proposed to improve the quality of PPI networks
(see Section 2.1). As all four algorithms calculate some
topology-based similarity scores for pairs of nodes, and then
use different (ad hoc) approaches to determine cut-offs, for a
fair comparison, here, we simply took the top 7123 pairs of
genes having the highest scores as the predicted PPIs. Table l

shows the change to the network introduced by each method. We
then compared the functional relevance of the reconstructed PPI
networks. As shown in Figure 5, the PPI network reconstructed
by our method has the highest GO similarity, highest fraction of
in-complex edges and lowest fraction of between-complex edges.
In fact, our algorithm is the only method that shows consistent
improvement over the original network using all four criteria.
For example, RWR improved GO similarity scores and the frac-
tion of in-complex edges, but at the same time reduced the
co-expression scores and increased between-complex edges.
GGA resulted in lower co-expression scores. The network recon-
structed by ECT has slightly higher co-expression than the net-
work reconstructed by our method, but its GO similarity score is
much lower than the original network, and it has a decreased
fraction of in-complex edges and an increased fraction of
between-complex edges. MDS resulted in degraded functional
relevance scores according to all measurements except
between-complex edges.

3.4 Applicability to other types of PPI networks

We also applied our method to two other datasets, obtained by
Yu et al. (2008) and Tarassov et al. (2008), using Y2H and
protein-fragment complementation assay (PCA), respectively.

complex. The subnetworks contain interactions among known members
(dark) of MIPS protein complexes and their direct neighbours (light) in
the original Krogan PPI network (left) or the reconstructed network with
our method (right)

Table 1. Changes to network statistics by different algorithms

Although the afﬁnity puriﬁcation (AP) technique used in
Krogan et al. (2006) is designed to capture co-complex member-
ships, Y2H and PCA directly detect binary interactions and were
shown to have higher false-negative rate but lower false-positive
rate than AP (Yu et al., 2008; Tarassov et al., 2008).

The original Yu and Tarassov networks cover 1278 and 1124
genes with 1641 and 2513 edges, respectively, excluding
self-interacting edges. With our method, we were able to replace
(predict and remove) 706 (43.0%) and 1203 (47.9%) of the edges
for the two networks, respectively. As shown in Figure 6, the
evaluation results based on Gene Ontology for these two datasets
and the evaluation results based on co-expression for the Yu data
set are consistent with those for the Krogan dataset, conﬁrming
the general applicability of our method to PPI networks regard-
less of the experimental systems used to infer them. On the other
hand, the differences between the predicted and removed edges
are smaller in Yu/Tarassov data than in Krogan data. In fact, for
the Tarassov data, the removed edges have slightly better
co-expression than the predicted ones; nevertheless, both are
lower than the conﬁrmed edges and signiﬁcantly higher than
the randomly predicted ones. These deviations from the
Krogan dataset likely reﬂect the lower false-positive rate of the
Y2H and PCA data compared with AP data (Tarassov et al.,
2008, Yu et al., 2008). As our results consistently showed that the
removed edges have much higher functional relevance than
random predictions, chances are that many of the removed
edges are not really false positives—they just tend to contain
more false-positive edges than the conﬁrmed group of edges.
To reiterate, we chose to keep the original number of edges in
the predicted networks to facilitate an unbiased comparison of
different approaches, as otherwise changing parameters may sig-
niﬁcantly alter and bias the evaluation outcomes. In practice,
because of the high false-negative rate in PPI networks, especially
for Y2H and PCA based networks, one would prefer to choose a
lower similarity threshold to make more predictions and remove
fewer edges than we have done here. As mentioned in Section 2
and later in Section 4, we are aware of and are developing better
ways to select cut-offs to improve the coverage of PPI networks,
which will be presented elsewhere.

Similarly, as in Krogan data, the predicted edges in Yu/
Tarassov data have higher co-essentiality than the removed
edges, suggesting that the predicted ones are more likely to be
in-complex than the removed ones. On the other hand, although
the conﬁrmed edges in Krogan data have high co-essentiality,
those in the Yu/Tarassov data have much lower co-essentiality,
indicating that a large portion of between-complex edges in
these two datasets are preserved by our algorithm. As shown
in Yu et al. (2008), Y2H and PCA usually detect more

3.5 Predicted edges are bona fide physical interactions

Finally, it is interesting to ask whether the edges predicted by our
algorithm are bona ﬁde physical interactions or simply

functional interactions. To answer this question, we validated
the edges predicted by our algorithm on the three yeast datasets
using the physical interactions present in the BioGRID database
(Stark et al., 2011). It is known that different PPI assay tech-
niques have different characteristics and produce complemen-
tary, largely disjoint, results (Tarassov et al., 2008; Yu et al.,
2008). We, therefore, classiﬁed the PPIs in BioGRID into four
categories according to the experimental systems: AP, Y2H),
PCA and other. Note that each PPI in BioGRID may have
been captured by multiple experiments and, therefore, appear
in multiple categories. The three datasets we used, Krogan, Yu
and Tarassov, were generated by the ﬁrst three systems, respect-
ively, and are all present in the BioGRID database. To ensure
fair comparison, before evaluating results for a particular dataset
(e.g. Krogan), BioGRID entries from the corresponding publi-
cation were removed (as otherwise the validation rate for the
conﬁrmed or removed group for the Krogan dataset would be
100%).

Table 2 shows the number and fraction of edges in different
groups validated by BioGRID, using all physical interactions
(column ‘All’) or using edges detected by speciﬁc experimental
systems (columns ‘AP’, ‘Y2H’, ‘PCA’ and ‘other’). When all
physical interactions are considered, for all three datasets, the
conﬁrmed edges always have the highest validation rate com-
pared with the other edge groups. The validation rates for pre-
dicted/removed edges are lower than that of the conﬁrmed ones
but signiﬁcantly higher than the random ones (<l% in all
cases). For Krogan data, the predicted edges have a much
higher validation rate than the removed ones, whereas for
Tarassov and Yu data, the validation rates for the predicted
edges are similar as or lower than that for the removed ones.
These results suggest that the predicted edges in all three data-
sets are likely bona ﬁde physical interactions, and reconﬁrm
that the removed ones are not necessarily false-positive results,
especially for Y2H and PCA-based data, which are known to
have lower false-positive rate than AP (Tarassov et al., 2008;
Yu et al., 2008). Therefore, it may be preferred to have a lower
cut-off to increase the coverage of PPI networks, as discussed in
Section 3.4. Overall, Krogan data has the highest percentage of
validated predictions (36.0% or 1033/2870), compared with Yu
and Tarassov data, which have 9.2% (65/706) and 11.2% (135/
1203) predicted edges validated by BioGRID, respectively (but
see later in the text). As the BioGRID PPI data may still have a
high false-negative rate, the real validation rate is likely
underestimated.

We also validated our results using the BioGRID PPIs within
each speciﬁc category. Interestingly, it seems that the different
characteristics in different experimental systems are carried over
to the predicted edges. For example, the predicted edges for
Krogan data are mostly validated by the AP-based interactions
in BioGRID. Moreover, although Y2H only covers 12.6% of
edges in BioGRID, it accounts for 53.9% (35/ 65) of the validated
predictions in Yu data. Similarly, PCA only contributes 7.1% of
the edges in BioGRID, but accounts for 17.0% (23/135) of the
validated predictions in Tarassov data. Therefore, the relatively
low validation rate for the Yu and Tarassov data can be partially
explained by the insufﬁcient presence of Y2H and PCA data in
the BioGRID database.

Figure 7 shows the validation results. Similar as for the yeast
data set, the reconstructed network has improved scores using
both criteria. Although the conﬁrmed edges have the highest
similarities scores, the predicted ones have better scores than
the removed ones, and both are signiﬁcantly better than
random predictions.

On the other hand, because of the high replacement rate
(65.9%), and the non-trivial functional and gene co-expression
similarity scores, we suspect that most of the removed edges are
probably true interactions. Therefore, we further investigated the
distribution of the topological similarity scores for the PPIs in the
original network, which clearly follow a bimodal distribution
(Supplementary Fig. S3). Therefore, we used topological similar-
ity score < 0.2 to select 4309 edges to be treated as high-conﬁdence
false-positive edges (top removed), and topological similarity
score > 0.9 to select 3802 edges as high-conﬁdence false-negative
edges (top new) and evaluated them using gene ontology and gene
co-expression. As shown in Figure 7, the high-conﬁdence false-
positive edges have close-to-random gene co-expression (0.01),

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Gene Ontology Expression

functional relevance scores based on gene ontology, gene expression. See
main text for deﬁnitions of top new and top removed

and low GO-based similarity. In contrast, the average
GO-based similarity score for the high-conﬁdence false-negative
edges are almost as high as the conﬁrmed edges, and they have
high co-expression. These results indicate that the topological
similarity scores can be used to prioritize edges for further valid-
ation. In fact, as shown in Figure 8, with as many as 35 000
(50 000) predicted edges, the average gene co-expression (GO simi-
larity) of interacting genes are as good as that in the original PPI
network, indicating that we can increase the coverage of the
HPRD human PPI network by at least 100%.

In this article, we have presented a novel network topology-based
algorithm to improve the quality of PPI networks, which in turn

can improve the prediction accuracy of protein complexes. The
key idea of our algorithm is that two proteins sharing some
high-order topological similarities, which are measured by a
novel random walk-based procedure, are likely interacting with
each other and may belong to the same protein complex. Overall,
the reconstructed yeast PPI network have much higher biological
relevance than the original network, and better quality than
those reconstructed by several existing algorithms, assessed by
multiple types of information, including gene ontology, gene ex-
pression, essentiality and conservation between species. The re-
constructed network has also resulted in signiﬁcantly improved
protein complex prediction accuracy using two different algo-
rithms. Furthermore, our method is applicable to PPI networks
obtained with different experimental systems, such as Y2H, af-
ﬁnity puriﬁcation based and protein-fragment complementation
assay, and evidence shows that the predicted edges are likely
bona ﬁde physical interactions. Finally, an application to a
human PPI network increased the coverage of the network by
at least 100%.

Our method may be improved in several directions. For ex-
ample, to derive a network from the topology-based similarity
matrix, we have used a simple cut-off-based strategy to maintain
the number of edges in the original network. We made this
choice to facilitate a fair evaluation of different network

reconstruction/clustering algorithms. In fact, we have found
that many edges with similarity slightly below the cut-off also
have higher biological relevance than those removed, as shown in
the human data. This is also biologically understandable—the
original PPI network has a higher false-negative rate than
false-positive rate (Huang et al., 2007; Kuchaiev et al., 2009).
In future work, it may be worthwhile to develop methods that
can guide the selection of a more appropriate cut-off that would
allow more functionally relevant edges being included without
introducing too many false-positive edges. One possible way is to
examine the distribution of the similarity scores of the original
edges and non-edges and determine what edge weights might
represent a good separation.

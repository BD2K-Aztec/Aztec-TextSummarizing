ABSTRACT

Motivation: Methods for automatic nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) structure determination need to face a high level of
ambiguity encountered in NMR spectra recorded by solid-state
NMR and by solution NMR of partially unfolded proteins, leading
to time-consuming calculations. The software package Ambiguous
Restraints for Iterative Assignment (ARIA) allows for straightforward
parallelization of the calculation, as the conformers can be generated
in parallel on many nodes.

Results: Due to its architecture, the adaptation of ARIA to grid
computing can be easily achieved by using the middleware glite and
JDL (Job Description Language) scripts. This adaptation makes it
possible to address highly ambiguous datasets, because of the much
larger conformational sampling that can be generated by use of the
grid computational power.

Availability: The version 2.3.1 of ARIA implemented on the grid is
freely available from the ARIA web site: aria.pasteur.fr/downloads.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) is one of the major
techniques for biomolecular structure determination (Wuthrich,
1986), with decisive advantages for particular cases. NMR structure
determination makes it necessary to assign the contacts (NOEs
for liquid state NMR, other dipolar couplings for ssNMR), a step
that is performed during the structure calculation in an iterative
protocol within Ambiguous Restraints for Iterative Assignments
(ARIA) (Nilges et al., 1997). In each iteration, the contacts are
assigned based on structures from the previous iteration, and the data
points most inconsistent with the conformations are removed with
a simple statistical analysis (Guntert, 2004; Rieping et al., 2006).
Protein conformations are then calculated with distance restraints,
which are based on the current set of assignments but usually retain
a large level of ambiguity. Convergence of the structures improve
from iteration to iteration, and the calculation is terminated when a
converged set of conformations is obtained with good restraints ﬁt.

The efﬁciency and even the feasibility of the automatic NOE
assignment depends on the spectral resolution, i.e. on the level
of ambiguity in the NMR spectra. NMR started recently to tackle
problems where high levels of ambiguity are encountered, as the
study of membrane or ﬁbrillar proteins with solid—state NMR

(ssNMR), and the study of partially unfolded proteins with solution
NMR. The analysis of these structural landscapes is essential to
understand important biological phenomena (B 60kmann and Meier,
2010; Korzhnev et al., 2010; Leroy et al., 2010; Montserret et al.,
2010).

The iterative ARIA cycle is based on three major steps: (i) input
preparation for the generation of conformations; (ii) generation
of conformations by a simulated annealing procedure using the
software CNS (Brunger et al., 1998); and (iii) analysis of the
obtained conformations to generate a new set of NOE assignments
and restraints. ARIA is straightforwardly parallelized by distributing
the step (ii) over a few or many CPU units.

A signiﬁcant increase in the number of calculated protein
conformations improves the statistics on the NMR conformations
and can help to overcome the ambiguity bottleneck. Grid computing
is an attractive option for the parallel computing of conformations,
because of the large number of computing elements, and since it
brings parallel computing even to laboratories that lack the in—house
infrastructure.

We have adapted ARIA to grid computing in the frame
of GRISBI (Grid Support to Bioinformatics: www.grisbio.fr)
(Blanchet et al., 2006a, b), which is a transverse project of the
French Bioinformatics network RENABI (REseau NAtional des
plateformes BIoinformatiques: http://www.renabi.fr/).

In order to use the grid, the user needs to obtain a digital
certiﬁcate from a trusted Certiﬁcation Authority, to register on a
Virtual organization (V0) and to have an account on a user interface
(UI) computer. A proxy certiﬁcate, valid by default for 24 h, has to
be created to authenticate the user in subsequent secure interactions.
The UI performs the steps (i) and (iii) of the ARIA iteration, and
dispatches tasks related to step (ii) on a Workload Management
System (WMS) that submit each task to an appropriate computing
element (CE). The job submission and management on the grid
computing elements is performed through the middleware glite,
developed by the EGEE project (www.eu—egee.org).

The glite commands, glite—wms—j ob—submit, glite—wms—job—status,
glite—wms—job—output and glite—wms—job—cancel, are used in the
ARIA grid implementation. The j ob submission is done through a Job
Description Language (J DL) ﬁle generated by ARIA. The command
glite—wms—job—submit submits a job to the WMS, by uploading the
CNS input ﬁles to transfer them to the most appropriate computing
element (Fig. 1).

After a successful submission, ARIA uses the glite—wms—job—
status command to query the WMS about the state of each job

every 2min. If the job state is ‘done’, the glite—wms—job—output
command allows to download an archive of the CNS outputs from
the computing element to the UI. Once all jobs are correctly ﬁnished,
ARIA performs the step (iii) on the UI in order to prepare the updated
restraints for the next iteration.

A grid is not as reactive and safe as a cluster, and delays
in computing element response can slow down the conformer
generation. To avoid these delays, two jobs are submitted for each
CNS calculation, the output of the faster job being conserved and
the other job being canceled. Several python procedures have been
implemented in ARIA to handle errors during the computing element
calculation, during the job submission. The processed errors are
as follows: (i) submission or network failure, (ii) job abortion by
WMS, (iii) unsuccessful job output download. In these cases, ARIA
resubmits automatically the job with an output message. The input
and output ﬁles of the conformation generation are uploaded and
downloaded through the Sandbox, that is a space storage on the
WMS restrained to 10MB.

Three python classes of ARIA have undergone most of the changes
to adapt ARIA to the grid: (i) class Job for managing the CNS
jobs, (ii) class cns for preparing the CNS input ﬁles, (iii) class
jobmanagerpanel for connecting to the graphical user interface. The
running mode of ARIA is deﬁned in the panel jobmanager of the
graphical interface or in the element jobmanager of the project
xml ﬁle. ARIA can run on a single computer (LOCAL mode),
on a cluster of processors related by a fast local area network
and sharing the same data and storage information (CLUSTER
mode) or on a grid (GRID mode). The panel jobmanager contains
also the management job commands. The state_command and the
output_command attributes have to be ﬁlled only if ARIA is run in
GRID mode.

The state and the id of each job submitted to the grid are traced
in ﬁles .run located in the ARIA run directory. ‘Not run’ means that

the job is not launched yet or aborted. The two submitted jobIDs are
given if they are running. ‘Cleared’ means that the fastest job ended
successfully and was retrieved on the U1.

The future perspective is the adaptation of ARIA to cloud
computing, where external customers buy on demand CPU,
storage, computing power from a supplier. This approach increases
the reliability and the ﬂexibility, and is certainly the future of
intensive computation for parallel calculations with no or little
communication. In the framework of the cloud computing approach,
ARIA faces the challenge of the encapsulation into a Virtual machine,
due to the large number of libraries and software packages involved
[CCPN: Fogh et al. (2002); Vranken et al. (2005), CNS: (Brunger
et al., 1998), TkInter].

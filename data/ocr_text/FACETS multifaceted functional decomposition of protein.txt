ABSTRACT

Motivation: The availability of large-scale curated protein interaction
datasets has given rise to the opportunity to investigate higher level
organization and modularity within the protein—protein interaction (PPI)
network using graph theoretic analysis. Despite the recent progress,
systems level analysis of high-throughput PPIs remains a daunting
task because of the amount of data they present. In this article,
we propose a novel PPI network decomposition algorithm called
FACETS in order to make sense of the deluge of interaction data
using Gene Ontology (GO) annotations. FACETS finds not just a
single functional decomposition of the PPI network, but a
multi-faceted atlas of functional decompositions that portray alterna-
tive perspectives of the functional landscape of the underlying PPI
network. Each facet in the atlas represents a distinct interpretation
of how the network can be functionally decomposed and organized.
Our algorithm maximizes interpretative value of the atlas by optimizing
inter-facet orthogonality and intra-facet cluster modularity.

Results: We tested our algorithm on the global networks from lntAct,
and compared it with gold standard datasets from MIPS and KEGG.
We demonstrated the performance of FACETS. We also performed a
case study that illustrates the utility of our approach.

1 INTRODUCTION

The massive amount of biological interaction datasets presents
the opportunity to study higher order organization and modu-
larity of interaction networks. High-throughput interaction
experiments, however, introduce new challenges to visualization
and analysis of biological interaction data. A common thread
that runs through high throughput generated data is information
overload, i.e. the explosion of data that makes intuitive and
meaningful functional analysis difﬁcult, even overwhelming. In
case of protein—protein interaction (PPI) data, decomposing the
network into functional modules is often the key step to under-
standing the overall picture of the functional relationships that

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

underlie the data. Consequently, graph clustering methods that
decompose PPI networks into their functional constituents are
increasingly pertinent (Lavallee-Adam et al., 2009).

In general, graph clustering algorithms discover regions of
dense connectivity that represent protein complexes or function-
ally coherent processes (Bader and Hogue, 2003; Krogan et al.,
2006; Seah et al., 2012). Unfortunately, these methods output
only a single optimal functional decomposition of the PPI network.
Consequently, a PPI network can only be decomposed and
viewed from a single perspective, whereas in reality there are
often multiple different perspectives (decompositions) associated
with the functional organization of the underlying network, all of
which are distinct and equally valid. We refer to each of these
decompositions as a facet because they visualize the organization
of a PPI network from a unique view, providing a distinct inter-
pretation of the organization of the underlying network. For
example, consider the toy transcriptional regulatory network de-
picted in Figure l. A typical decomposition, based on an existing
graph clustering technique (e.g. mcode in Bader and Hogue,
2003), identiﬁes dense regions of the network, which correspond
to the decomposition of protein complexes as shown in Facet 1.
However, this network can also be viewed from other different
perspectives. For instance, it can be organized by the types of
signaling pathways involved in it (Facet 2). Notice that the de-
composition from this perspective is markedly different from the
complex-based decomposition. Furthermore, different proteins
in the network may undergo various modifications such as
acetylation, phosphorylation and ubiquitination. Hence, yet an-
other way to decompose the network is by their modification
effects as depicted in Facet 3. Clearly, in larger real-world net-
works the possibility of uncovering multiple, distinct functional
decompositions are real.

At first glance, it may seem that we can tune the clustering
parameters of existing graph clustering techniques in order to
generate multiple facets or decompositions. Unfortunately, such
tuning only generates an exponential number of slightly perturbed
decompositions with incremental differences (see Supplementary
Material). In other words, such strategy does not generate func-
tionally unique decompositions. In contrast, it is imperative to
ensure that the decompositions or facets are distinctive, i.e. they
are maximally different from each other. This is because every
facet should provide a fresh and informative perspective to the
organization of the network, rather than providing just incremen-
tal differences with respect to other facets.

Fig. 1. Illustration of multi—faceted PPI network decomposition

Our contribution. We propose a novel algorithm called
FACETS that discovers an atlas of functionally unique decom-
positions from a PPI network, portraying alternative views of the
functional landscape of the network (detailed in Section 2). Each
decomposition or facet represents a distinct interpretation of
how the network can be functionally decomposed and organized.
Since a key objective is to obtain n unique facets that are inform-
ative and orthogonal (We use the term orthogonal to describe the
idea of distinctive clusters, rather than its precise mathematical
meaning), our algorithm maximizes interpretative value of the
atlas by optimizing intra-facet cluster modularity and inter-facet
orthogonality. Intra-facet cluster modularity captures the aim of
decomposing a PPI network G based on a particular functional
and/or structural view. For instance, based on complexes and
localized structures, G can be decomposed into protein com-
plexes. If we consider regulatory processes as a functional con-
cept, then G can be decomposed into signaling and regulation
pathways, an entirely different decomposition. Inter-facet orthog-
onality, on the other hand, demands that each of the n facets are
structurally distinctive and functionally apart from each other.
We propose a novel objective function that models these intu-
itions and FACETS exploit it to discover a set of distinct
facets. Speciﬁcally, we exploit both the PPI graph structure
and the rich functional information provided by Gene
Ontology (GO) annotations to guide facets construction.

In Section 3 we evaluate the performance of FACETS on real
world PPI datasets. We also compare FACETS-generated de-
compositions against several gold standard datasets. We demon-
strate its superiority over tested graph clustering methods. We
illustrate the robustness of FACETS against noise. Finally, we
conduct a case study to illustrate how multi-faceted decompos-
itions identiﬁed multiple organization maps of the human autop-
hagy system (Behrends et al., 2010).

Related work. Multi-view clustering is a poorly studied prob-
lem in the data mining community (Qi and Davidson, 2009).
Still, there are several works that have focused on multi-view
clusterings in image and text mining domain (Niu and Dy,
2010). One approach projects data into an alternative subspace
(Cui et al., 2007). Another approach generates alternative clus-
tering through the use of must-link and cannot-link constraints
(W agstaff and Cardie, 2000). In meta-clustering (Caruana et al.,
2006), a large number of clusters are generated and clusters
which are truly different are selected. All of the aforementioned
approaches, however, assume data points in the vector space that
allow the notion of metric distances in a Euclidean geometry. On
the other hand, our problem demands a multi-view clustering
methodology on attributed graphs, which requires a graph clus-
tering paradigm on both structure and annotation. To the best of

our knowledge, multi-view clustering paradigm has not been
applied in clustering biological networks to identify pertinent
functional modules from multiple perspectives.

Ensemble clustering methods generate an ensemble of near-
optimal decompositions (Agarwal and Kempe, 2008; Massen
and Doye, 2005; Navlakha and Kingsford, 2010). These methods
have been used to increase the quality and conﬁdence of the
decomposition and understand network dynamics. The near-
optimal decompositions generated, however, have no notion of
the orthogonality that this work is seeking. Instead, ensemble
clusterings create a large number of perturbed solutions,
making them unsuitable as an atlas of functionally distinct de-
compositions. For instance, in (Navlakha and Kingsford, 2010),
a small network of 32 nodes generated at least 82 permutations
of clusterings.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

In this section, we formally introduce the multi—faceted functional decom-
position problem. We begin by deﬁning some terminology that we shall
be using in the sequel. We use the network in Figure l as running example
in this article.

2.1 Terminology

An undirected network G = (V, E) contains a set of vertices V, represent-
ing biological entities like proteins or genes, a set of edges E, representing
interactions between the entities. A functional module C,- = (Vf,,E£.) is a
subnetwork of G such that  C V and  is the set of edges induced by
Vi. from G. A facet (decomposition or view) of G, denoted by F, is a set of
functional modules {C1, ..., Cm} representing a speciﬁc functional con-
cept. Functional modules within a facet F are allowed to overlap. In the
sequel, we use the terms facet, view and decomposition interchangeably.
A functional atlas (or atlas for brevity) of G, denoted by A, is a set of
facets {F1, F2, .. . , Fn} that represents distinctive functional landscapes of
G. Figure 1 depicts an atlas of three facets, with each facet decomposing
the network into three functional modules.

In order to support the idea of functionally orthogonal views, we util-
ize GO annotations associated with proteins. Given a G0 directed acyclic
graph (DAG) D = (VGO,EGO), the ordered set A = (A1, A2, ..., Ad) is
a topological sort of D, where A,- represents a single GO term. Each
vertex v e V is associated with a d—dimensional function association
vector A, e {0,1}d, such that A, = (Al, A3, ...,A;), A; 6 {0,1}, where
A; = 1 if and only if the term A,- e D or its descendants are associated
with protein v, and All 2 0 if otherwise. Note that A, is an indicator
vector that indicates GO terms that are associated with v.

A facet candidate bundle B, 2 {G1, G2, ..., Gm} is a set of connected
subnetworks of G such that for every Gk e B,-, there is a shared GO term
A,- within every v e Vk. A,- represents the common function of the can-
didate subnetwork. A facet candidate bundle B, represents the superset of
facet F,- and it contains a large permutation of subnetworks that satisfy a
particular functional concept. Typically, |F,-| << |B,-|. A function bundle
a),- = {A1,A2,  Am} is the set of shared GO annotations of B,-, i.e.
a),- = UerBi AGk. To illustrate these concepts, consider the PPI network
in Figure 1. Suppose that B1 is a facet candidate bundle with
(1)1 = {A1, A2}, where A1 represents the Swr1 complex GO term and
A2 the Histone term. In the subgraph with Swr1 complex label in Facet
1, every node in that subgraph is annotated with Swr1 complex term.
Thus, the subgraph is a valid member of B1. Any subgraph made up of
Histone-labeled nodes is also a valid member of B1. If B2 represents the
facet candidate bundle with (02 = {A3}, where A3 represents cellular
component, then the Swr1 complex-labeled subgraph is also a valid
member of B2 (Swrl complex is a cellular component).

Furthermore, every subgraph in Facet 1 whose nodes are labeled is a
valid member of B2, but not neccessarily a valid member of B1. One
can see that B,- contains a set of subgraphs that shares speciﬁc functional
concepts depending on the functional terms in (0,. We deﬁne the function
f: P(Vg0) —> A given by f ((0,) = F,- to make explicit the association be-
tween a functional bundle and its corresponding facet.

A function bundle partition S2 = {w1,w2, ...,wn} is the set of function
bundles that form a partition of all GO terms VGO, i.e. Uwieg = VGO. In
the next section, we shall impose further constraints on facet candidate
bundles and function bundles such that the shared GO terms of the
subnetworks within each facet candidate bundle shares high functional
commonality and the terms shares in one facet are distinct from the terms
in another facet.

2.2 Problem formulation

The goal of multi—faceted functional decomposition problem is to identify
an atlas of n distinct facets of G that maximizes inter-facet orthogonality
and intra-facet cluster modularity. Each facet depicts a higher-order
organization of modules of G. Recall that inter-facet functional orthog-
onality demands that each of the n facets is based on an orthogonal
functional concept—facets that are distinctive and functionally apart
from each other. Hence, we propose two criteria that model the
intra—facet functional modularity and inter-facet orthogonality of an
atlas solution. Next, we propose an objective function that models and
scores an atlas of G.

2.2.] Intra-facet cluster modularity Intra-facet cluster modularity
enables us to seek clusters that are both structurally and functionally
modular. Given (0,, S2 and G, w—restricted decomposition procedure
(denoted by gm) computes a decomposition of G into F,- such that F,-
satisﬁes the following criteria:

Criterion I . Every module CJ- 6 F,- should be functionally bounded by
(0,. Let DC}. 2 {A1, A2, . . . , Am} be the set of shared terms in Cj, i.e. for
every v 6 WC, v must be annotated with every A,- e DCj. Then, the func-
tional boundedness of module CJ- by a),- is given by r (C1, (0,) 2 DC}. ﬂ (0,. A
cluster CJ- is bounded by a),- if r(Cj, (0,) 75 0. An (oi-restricted decompos-
ition of a facet draws from a restricted search space of subnetworks in G
whose vertice shares at least a term within (0,. Intuitively, this means that
for any subnetwork to be considered as a module, it must ﬁrst be sharing
a term in (0,. Even if a subnetwork is dense, it must yield to sparser
subnetwork candidates if it is not enriched with terms within (0,. In the
example of Figure 1, if col is terms of protein complexes, then any sub-
graphs enriched with complex terms is in the search space for Facet I .
In contrast, the modules of Facet 2, enriched with signaling terms, would
be invalid candidates for Facet I decomposition. This restricted search
space is modeled by facet bundle B,, where any valid candidate facet
cluster Q of facet F,- must belong to B,.

Criterion 2. A facet F,- decomposes G by maximizing a clustering ob-
jective function 0(Fi) while satisfying the above criterion. These criteria
are determined by the speciﬁc graph clustering algorithm that is adapted
for creating a facet; for generality we let this be the objective function
0(Fi) that has to be maximized by the graph clustering algorithm. For
instance, every module C]- e F,- has to be structurally dense and/or func-
tionally coherent (i.e. every node in module shares a common function),
the coverage of F,- has to be high, and the amount of overlap between
modules should be low. For example, modules of Facet 2 maximize 0(F2)
while satisfying the (o2 bound, despite not forming dense modules. This
is because all dense modules formed are enriched with complex terms,
violating the (o2 bound.

2.2.2 Inter-facet orthogonality Since we want every facet in the
atlas to be functionally and structurally distinct, modules within a facet,
as whole, should be structurally and functionally distinct from modules

within another facet. We discuss two independent distance measure be-
tween facets: functional orthogonality and structural orthogonality.

Functional orthogonality is indirectly controllable by the function bun-
dles attached to facets, which determines the types of allowable modules
through the aforementioned restriction. By increasing inter-bundle func-
tional orthogonality, we increase the functional distinctiveness of each
facet. To impose functional orthogonality, we introduce the following
constraint: for every w,,wj e S2,a),- ﬂ wj = 0 and Uwieg = VGO. This re-
quires that S2 actually partitions the terms of the GO DAG. The func-
tional distance measure between A,- and A], denoted by d(A,-, Aj),
measures the functional dissimilarity between the terms. In this article,
d(A,-, Aj) is simply computed as the length of the shortest path between
the terms: df(A,-, Aj) = minxreR|p(Ar, Ai)| + lp(Ar, Aj)|, where R is the
set of common ancestors of term A,- and A J- and |p(i,j)| is the length of the
shortest path from node A,- to AJ- in D. The candidate function specificity
s(A,-,C,,) is deﬁned as s(A,-,C,,) 2%. s(A,-,C,,) measures the
speciﬁcity of a shared GO term, which we will later use to weigh the
contribution of the term. For instance, a cluster Q of 5 nodes that
share the biological process GO term in a network of 1000 bio—
logical process annotated nodes has a low speciﬁcity value of 0.005
with respect to the term.

Likewise, we deﬁne structural orthogonality. The structural distance
measure between two clusters Cu and CV is deﬁned as d,(C,,, CV) =
l— |E’é ﬂEVC| /|{(v,-,vj)|v,- 6 V5 (1 VVC, vj 6 V5 U VVC,(v,-,vj) 6 BE UEVC}|.
The distance is 0 if Cu and CV shares all edges and 1 if Cu and CV shares
no edges.

Following that, we deﬁne t(S2, A) as the linear combination of inter-
facet functional and structural orthogonality, as follows:

d A~,A,
z<s2.A>=y : { z : s<A.,c.>s<A.-,c.>ff,»wl}
w,,wjeS2, AJEDCj, AZEDCi, I p” PI

+(1 _ 7/) Z Z 5(Aus  S(AV9 CV) ds(Cus CV)

AueDCu,C,,eF, AveDCv,C,eFj
F,eA FJ-eA,i;éj

The parameter y weighs the contribution of d, against df, and is set to
attain balanced contribution from both terms. Note that t(S2, A) quanti-
ﬁes the pairwise orthogonality between two function bundles. The higher
the score, the greater the orthogonality.

2.3 Problem definition

The multi-faceted functional decomposition of G is deﬁned as the
problem of simultaneously constructing the atlas of decompositions
A={F1,...,F,,}, and the function partition S2={a)1,...,wn}, such
that the following objective function is maximized:

max M(S2,A)+(1 —A)|A|‘1 Z 0(F,)

AaQ FieA

subject to C, e Bi‘v’CS e F,-,1 g i g n

The right half of the terms captures the cost function of decomposing
G into A; the left half, decomposing D into S2. The parameter 2 controls
the weightage between the two terms. Observe that one has to optimize
these criteria simultaneously over the space of A and S2. Otherwise, one
may end up with a poor objective score. For instance, if t(S2, A) is high
(meaning highly orthogonal partitioning), but S2 is improperly partitioned
such that one ends up with a), that allow only poor decompositions, then
the 0(Fi) score would be very low. Due to the interdependence of the
criteria, optimizing the aforementioned function is computationally
expensive.

2.4 FACETS algorithm

Generally, the problem of ﬁnding clusters that maximizes typical cluster-
ing objective functions that relate to graph density is known to be
NP-hard (Jagota, 1995). Hence, the FACETS algorithm is a heuristic
implementation that attempts to ﬁnd a local maximum of the objective
function. Our heuristics is a step-wise iterative approach that incremen-
tally optimizes S2 and A, one at a time (Fig. 2). Intuitively, given an
attributed PPI network (e.g. Fig. 2a), S2 is incrementally updated by
using each facet in A as functional centroids, and then using the centroids
to partition D. A is updated through w-restricted decomposition using the
updated S2. The FACETS algorithm consists of two phases: the initial-
ization phase (Fig. 2b), and the iteration phase (Fig. 2c—d) (see
Supplementary Material). We describe each of them in turn.

Initialization. This phase creates an initial set of decompositions for the
second phase. We perform graph clustering on G to obtain an initial set of
modules. To this end, the FUSE (Seah et al., 2012) algorithm, summar-
ized in Supplementary Material, is utilized. Each module of this set is then
randomly associated with a facet, randomly distributing the modules over
an initial set of facets. Following that, we construct candidates subnet-
works, which use subnetworks of G that satisfy (oi-restricted decompos-
ition constraint. To generate candidates exhaustively is prohibitively
expensive. Instead, candidates for a facet F,- are generated as follows:
for every GO term A e (0,, we obtain the induced subnetwork in G
whose nodes are annotated with A or its descendants. The subnetwork
is then decomposed into connected components, each forming a candi-
date subnetwork Gj. Let AJC = A be the term associated with this candi-
date. Candidates formed this way can vary greatly in resolution of the
annotation that its nodes share (for example, AJC = biological pro—
cess), and can be highly overlapping.

Iteration. This phase—the actual optimization phase—is performed in
rounds. Let i denote the i—th iteration of the algorithm. At each round, the
algorithm updates A and S2 in two sequential steps. To evaluate algorithm
convergence, we introduce functional reassignment—the number of terms
in A that is reassigned to a different function bundle after Step 1 of i—th
iteration. This score measures the rate of change of S2, indicating how

close the algorithm is to convergence. Observe that when S2 is ﬁxed, the
algorithm reaches a steady state. The algorithm reaches convergence and
terminates when the functional reassignment at i—th iteration drops below
convergence threshold 6, a user-deﬁned parameter.

Step I. Update S2. In this step, we assume that A is a constant and
update S2 to increase t(S2, A). For each F,- e A, the enriched functional
terms of the modules in F,- serve as centroids for partitioning D into
orthogonal concepts; these enriched terms as whole form the centroid
of (0,, which is associated with F,-. We then reassign every candidate
subnetwork to its nearest centroid to form a partition S2. The convergence
properties of such centroid-based partitioning approaches (e.g. K—means)
has been well studied (Bottou and Bengio, 1994). For every
GJ- e B,, l 5 i 5 n, we determine its closest centroid by considering Gj’s
average functional and structural distance to functional modules within
a facet. The facet that is closest to GJ- is indicated by:

r 1 ifﬁ Z “Arc, Ci)¢(Cist)

CiEF

¢(Ci, C1) = 7/ + (1 — 7/)ds(Ci9 C1)

 

_ 0 otherwise

Following that, GJ- is reassigned to nearest facet candidate bundle Bk
(superset of Fk) and S2 is updated based on where every AJC e VGO is
assigned to. Each function bundle a),- 6 S2 represents functional terms that
are most closely associated with F,-, and the decomposition of F,- in the
following step will be bounded by the updated (0,. Function partitioning
depends on the atlas of decompositions because not every partition of the
GO DAG is capable of forming a modular decomposition of functional
modules.

Step 2. Update A. In this step, we update A to maximize the objective
function while ﬁxing S2. To support (oi-restricted decomposition of F,,
we propose an algorithm that employs proﬁt maximization model
(discussed below) and runs in iterations. At each iteration, we score can-
didate subnetworks based on a proﬁt maximization model and greedily
selects the best scoring candidate as member in F,-. An iteration runs
for every F,- e A before moving to the next iteration. Every candidate
considered for F,- must satisfy the (oi-restricted decomposition constraint,
i.e. the candidate subnetwork must be enriched with terms in (0,. In other
words, GJ- e B,.

We now describe the proﬁt maximization model for scoring a candi-
date GJ- e B,. Every v e V is assigned an information budget. A candidate
GJ- extracts, from each v e VJG, some information revenue from the budget
pool. The revenue extracted is correlated to the edge density of the sub-
network, with modular candidates giving high revenue. Each time a can-
didate is selected, revenue is removed from the budget pool and a cost is
incurred. A penalty cost is incurred for a candidate that is structurally
similar to selected clusters in other facets F ,v 75 F,-. This penalty is modeled
by cost(GJ-) = ZOeFmﬂgi dS(GJ-, C’), which utilizes the structural distance
measure d, described earlier. At each iteration, the candidate that con-
tributes the highest information proﬁt (revenue minus cost) is selected.
To summarize, a clustering in F,- that yields high overall revenue have
subgraphs with high facet modularity o(F,-), whereas a clustering with
low overall cost yields high inter-facet orthogonality t(S2,A). Given a
ﬁxed S2, the set of facets A with maximum overall proﬁt maximizes
the objective function. The algorithm above approximates this through
greedy heuristic.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Experiment settings

The FACETS algorithm is implemented in Scala (Odersky et al.,
2004). We now present the experiments conducted to study the

Table 1. Datasets used

 

 

performance of FACETS and report some of the results here. All
experiments were executed on a 1.66 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo
T5450 machine with 3GB memory. We primarily used the
global human PPI network from IntAct (Kerrien et al., 2007),
as well as the yeast, fruit ﬂy, and human autophagy networks
from IntAct (Table 1). In all experiments, we set the convergence
threshold 6 = 5. The weight y is set to 0.091 to balance the con-
tribution of structure and function (equal order of magnitude).
We utilize only the cellular process sub-domain of the GO
so that the facets are created not merely based on different GO
domains, but on more subtle functional differences.

3.1.] Evaluation criteria To measure the similarity/dissimilar-
ity between facets or decompositions, we employed the Jaccard
index (JI) (Ben-Hur et al., 2002) evaluation measure, which
is widely used to compare clusterings based on counting the
agreement or disagreement of co-clustered pairs of proteins.
The reader may refer to Supplementary Material for deﬁnitions
of the measure.

3.2 Experiment results

3.2.] Quantitative assessment Table 2 shows the quantitative
comparison between facets. We measure the inter-facet decom-
position similarity using the J I score. The low clustering similar-
ity scores between facets show that they are decomposed
distinctively. This reﬂects signiﬁcant organizational differences
between modules of signaling pathways and modules of protein
complexes. We measured the coverage of a facet and the extent of

metabolic networks from KEGG, each representing a single func-
tional module. (iii) KEGG—signaling—We use 23 human
signal transduction pathways from KEGG to represent decom-
position into signaling pathways. The gold standard decompos-
itions were chosen such that each represents a distinct functional
organization of the human network. As such, we consider each
gold standard dataset as a facet of the human network, and the
set of these three datasets as the gold standard atlas of the human
network. We then compared these datasets against the atlas
of facets obtained through our algorithm and determine if
there is a distinctive one-to—one mapping between our facet
and a gold standard facet. We set n: 6 and repeated the tests
ﬁfteen times under different starting conditions to account
for variability in facets output. We also compare the similarity
scores against graph clustering methods, namely Markov cluster-
ing (MCL) (Krogan et al., 2006), mcode (Bader and Hogue,
2003), nemo (Rivera et al., 2010) and fuse (Seah et al., 2012).
These methods create a single decomposition of the human net-
work. We removed clusters with fewer than three proteins. We
also compare against GO term enrichment (enrich) (Boyle et al.,
2004), which does not utilize structural information. Following
that, we measure the clustering similarities between the gold
standard datasets and the decompositions obtained. Figure 3
shows the clustering similarities between modules in gold stand-
ard datasets and modules in facets as well as tested graph clus-
tering methods. The JI was used to measure the agreement

between pairs of decompositions. We normalize the scores so
that the highest JI score obtained, within each gold standard
dataset, is adjusted to 1.

We consider the facet best associated with a gold standard
decomposition by comparing their relative scores. The gold
standard datasets were uniquely mapped to a distinct facet:
KEGG—metabolic is most similar to Facet 3,
KEGG—signaling is most similar to Facet 2 and MIPS is
most similar to Facet I. This unique mapping demonstrates
that from a clustering perspective, the facets have signiﬁcant
functional orthogonality such that they are uniquely associated
with different functional organization maps. Facet 6 has poor
similarity to the gold datasets, indicating a set of clusters that
could be functionally distinct from these datasets.

In contrast, the tested graph clustering methods share
common similarity patterns. Clusters are largely from a single
dominant perspective—those of protein complexes (MIPS). We
argue that objective functions based on dense connectivity tend
to favor protein complex structures over other decompositions
like metabolic pathways. GO term enrichment, on the other
hand, generates output with little similarity to all gold standard
datasets, indicating that annotations alone are unable to specif-
ically identify important functional modules within a large PPI
network. This is supported by the fact that functional analysis of
large networks often involve graph clustering prior to term en-
richment (Krogan et al., 2006).

3.2.3 Robustness To study the robustness of FACETS, we
tested the effect of annotation perturbations and edge deletions
of the input network on FACETS output. Random edge deletion
(edge noise) simulates the effect of removing false positive inter-
actions in high-throughput interaction datasets, whereas annota-
tion perturbation (node noise) simulates errors in curated
annotations. Figure 4(a—c) shows the effect of edge and node
noise on FACETS, varying from 0 to 100% noise. The ﬁgure
shows clustering similarities (J I similarity) between the best scor-
ing facets and gold standard datasets under increasing noise per-
turbations. We repeated each test ﬁfteen times with different
randomization seed. We observed that FACETS output quality
drops gradually under increasing edge and node noise condi-
tions. This demonstrates that the algorithm is robust to small
noise perturbations. In case of edge noise, we noted that the
quality of output only drops rapidly past the 0.5 noise ratio.
This is desirable given that false-positive rates in yeast
two-hybrid and TAP experiments range between 0.35 to 0.7
(Hart et al., 2006). MIPS clusters, which consist of densely inter-
connected clusters, are most robust to edge noise effects. The
effect of node noise is comparatively greater, but quality degrad-
ation remains gradual.

3.2.4 Eﬂect of initial starting point Given that FACETS
belong to the class of hill-climbing methods, the algorithm
output is dependent on the initial starting point. To this end, we
study the effects of multiple random initial starting points. We
compared the variability in clustering output due to starting point
versus variability due to noise effects to give a sense of the mag-
nitude of variability. We set a single facet output as the reference
output, and compared its J I similarity with outputs from different
starting points and increasing noise effects. The boxplot Figure
5(a and b) shows the effect of initial starting point versus noise on

facets. At 0 noise rate, the variability in II similarity is due to
initial starting point. Given the fact that high-throughput datasets
are inherently noisy (as mentioned above), the variability due to
starting point is less signiﬁcant. In addition, Figure 4(a—c) shows
the effect of starting points with respect to gold standard datasets
when one observes the similarity at 0 noise rate.

3.2.5 Convergence Figure 6(a and b) shows the functional
reassignments after the i-th iteration. We conducted the tests
on varying types of datasets with n=6. We also vary the
number of facets per atlas (n=2—6) on the global human net-
work. All tests converge in <9 rounds, demonstrating FACETS’
ability to converge quickly to a solution. Larger datasets such as
the human network requires more iterations to complete. The
number of iterations required also tends to increase with the
number of facets n.

3.2.6 Case study: human autophagy system To illustrate the
utility of multi-faceted decomposition, we analyze the functional
organization human autophagy system. The functional map of
this system was manually constructed in (Behrends et al., 2010).
We generated the facets of the human autophagy network
(n=6), and a subset of the results is shown in Figure 7. The
automatically generated facets show the pertinent roles of vesicle
transport and lipid membrane metabolism in autophagy, which
is consistent with the manually constructed map. Additionally,
the network can also be clustered from the perspective of cell
cycle and apoptosis regulation modules, which is not depicted in
the manual map. This demonstrates the possibility of having
multiple perspectives that organize a network.

4 CONCLUSION

In this article, we propose FACETS, a data-driven and generic al-
gorithm for generating multi-faceted functional decompositions

of a PPI network, providing multiple perspectives of the func-
tional organization landscape of the network. Our experimental
validation with real-world PPI networks demonstrates effective-
ness of FACETS in generating functionally distinctive facets. As
future work, we intend to extend FACETS to evaluate both
annotated and unannotated regions of the PPI network.

ABSTRACT

The International Society for Computational Biology, ISCB, organizes
the largest event in the field of computational biology and bioinfor-
matics, namely the annual international conference on Intelligent
Systems for Molecular Biology, the ISMB. This year at ISMB 2012 in
Long Beach, ISCB celebrated the 20th anniversary of its flagship
meeting. ISCB is a young, lean and efficient society that aspires to
make a signiﬁcant impact with only limited resources. Many con-
straints make the choice of venues for ISMB a tough challenge.
Here, we describe those challenges and invite the contribution of
ideas for solutions.

ISMB evolved. The largest scholarly meeting event in computa-
tional biology is the annual conference of the International
Society for Computational Biology, the ISCB, namely the inter-
national conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology
(ISMB). The ISMB meeting series began in 1993 in Bethesda
(Maryland, USA) and aimed to connect computational experts
to address challenges in molecular biology. That ﬁrst meeting
was so successful that it spawned a series of annual conferences
with increasing participation. The 8th ISMB (in 2000 at UCSD
in San Diego) was the ﬁrst ISMB that brought together over
1000 participants. Due to its increased size, it was also the last
ISMB that could be held at a university. The 12th ISMB [and the
ﬁrst joint meeting with the European Conference on
Computational Biology (ECCB) in Glasgow, 2004] attracted
over 2000 attendees. At that point, the concept of a single
track with only about 50 talks was no longer sustainable, and
ISMB went parallel, beginning with a double track. The 14th
ISMB in Fortaleza, Brazil was the last time that most of the
organization was shouldered signiﬁcantly by local scientists.
Beginning with the 15th ISMB (and the 2nd ISMB/ECCB) in
Vienna in 2007, ISCB took full responsibility for the

organization. It has been a great challenge for ISCB to move
from the position of what was essentially an ‘adVisory observer’
to that of completely managing the event over the course of six
meetings (2007—2012). Taking the leading role in the organiza-
tion of the conference provides ISCB with many possibilities to
simplify and to evolve a ‘signature style’. As a result, the organ-
ization of each new ISMB has increasingly moved toward an
orchestration of tasks carried out autonomously, each of which
follows some speciﬁc template and is driven by track chairs.
Conference organization is guided by a Steering Committee
(SC) composed of the meeting and track chairs, staff and key
contractors. The committee holds biweekly telephone confer-
ences during which organizational issues are discussed and deci-
sions taken.

ISMB involves the participation of over 2000 scientists; it runs
on a total budget exceeding 1.5 million dollars; and it was pre-
sented for the 20th time this year in Long Beach, CA. Those who
contemplate these three numbers may assume that the ‘new’ or-
ganizational structure is an evident necessity. This might seem so,
but the realization of this structure was by no means
straightforward.

Today: massively parallel, big event. Today ISMB is an event
of impressive proportions. This leads to immense challenges in
every respect. Other conferences/societies meet many of those
challenges, but no other society with limited resources similar
to those of ISCB successfully takes on such a particular combin-
ation of tasks. Meetings of comparable complexity and size typ-
ically operate on a budget that is signiﬁcantly more comfortable.
In other words, they spend much more money and involve seV-
eral times the staff.

At the ISMB in Long Beach (July 15—17, 2012), we realized a
total of approximately 1600 participants. As is now customary
for ISMB, a number of smaller special interest groups (SIGs) and
satellite meetings were organized prior to the main ISMB con-
ference. Some of these are, in their own right, the most important
annual meetings for particular research areas. The 6 keynote
addresses were followed (morning) or preceded (afternoon) by
a 2-h session of 4 talks within each of 9 parallel events/tracks, for

a collective total of over 200 talks presented during the 3-day
main meeting. Care is taken to maximize the slots for presenta-
tions without reducing the open spaces that allow participants to
meet. Guiding criteria are: starting at 9 am. and ending at 5:30
p.m.; reserving a 2-h break for lunch; and providing open blocks
of time for meeting with colleagues. In particular, maintaining
the open blocks of time is particularly difﬁcult given that ISMB
is the major event in the ﬁeld, not only due to the number of
participants, talks and the impact on the ﬁeld, but also through
the participation from the most visible representatives of the
ﬁeld: a signiﬁcant fraction of the top groups are present at
each ISMB. This means that the venue is densely packed with
an immense amount of creative potential, which also means that
many want to piggyback additional special events upon the main
regular schedule. Put differently, it is difﬁcult to ‘protect’ any free
time—but also essential. Indeed, a schedule that makes space for
meeting informally with colleagues has become a signature of
ISMB.

How well do room sizes fit? The structure of ISMB implies
several important constraints for the choice of a venue: we cur-
rently require that the venue have one room that comfortably
seats over 1500 participants, and there should be at least four
other rooms that can seat a considerable fraction for the
multi-track sessions. The speciﬁcation of ‘considerable fraction’
remains tricky, and the larger and more numerous the rooms, the
more expensive the venue rental. The challenge is to strike just
the right balance between rental costs and optimal space, and to
do so when the ﬁnal attendance is still very much an unknown.

ISMB/ECCB 2004 in Glasgow remains by many measures the
most successful meeting in the history of ISMB and ECCB, and
the positive collaboration that now exists between these two
groups started with that one conference. In addition to being
our ﬁrst joint event, it was also our ﬁrst time presenting two
parallel papers tracks (as a combination of long and short
papers), plus tracks for demos and SIG meeting reports.
Needless to say, we were experimenting with expansion options,
but we underestimated the attendance that our ﬁrst joint meeting
would draw, and had not anticipated just how popular any given
talk within a multi-track conference could be. Due to the require-
ments imposed by the number of parallel sessions, there is no
practical way to change rooms at the last minute if a particular
talk or session is in such high demand that it exceeds the capacity
of its reserved space. We learned the hard way that if the size of a
session room is too small for even one talk in that session, too
many attendees will become frustrated. Glasgow paved the way
for working together successfully and thinking boldly outside the
box. It also continues to serve as a reminder that we must be
careful when reviewing space limitations in otherwise ideal
venues.

Choosing venues with rooms for many parallel sessions that
can each accommodate over 350 delegates not only increases the
venue rental cost, but it also means that ISMB is restricted to the
very few conference centers that have such facilities. These con-
ference centers are typically able to accommodate considerably
larger meetings of over 20 000 delegates—a very different league!
We needed to ﬁnd a way in between the Scylla of ‘big single track
conferences’ and the Charybdis of ‘car exhibitions’.

The ISMB venues visited since we have gone massively parallel
were all ideal in many respects. In order to ﬁnd these ideal venues

in Vienna, Toronto, Boston, Stockholm and Long Beach, ISCB
had to discard many others. Typically, ISCB receives quotes
from six to eight venues/cities, and visits two or three of these
sites based on ﬁnancial viability. Quotes collected by the ISCB
conferences director, Steven Leard, for meeting venues in
London, New York and Paris, for example, were signiﬁcantly
beyond the ﬁnancial reach of the Society. Simply ﬁnding a suit-
able venue for ISMB is increasing in effort, and it was with this
in mind that the decision was taken to experiment with returning
intermittently to ideal conference venues. Repetition of sites has
the additional advantage that, as a repeat customer, it should
allow the negotiation of better prices for rental and services, and
that it allows ISCB to develop a relationship with the local ser-
vice providers. The ﬁrst repetition, Vienna (2007 and 2011) was
only partially successful in that the price had increased between
the two events beyond expectation. This might exclude Vienna
from future ‘returns’. The second return will be Boston (2010 and
2014) that will hopefully become the ﬁrst ‘safe’ site to which
ISCB can return at least once every 4 to 8 years.

The main requirements are: one room with over 1500 seats
that can be ﬁlled by the participants without too much acoustic
disruption (a seemingly simple constraint that is not satisﬁed by
all venues visited), a number of additional rooms seating between
250 and 500 participants, and another handful with 50—150 seats.
Seating should be able to be emptied and ﬁlled in less than 5 min
during the brief break between all talks that is synchronized for
all tracks. Further, the 500—1000 posters should be placed such
that the probability of being visited is high; and exhibitors should
have enough space that is in a central location passed regularly
by each delegate. The degree to which we achieve this is directly
proportional to the success of attracting exhibitors who are cru-
cial for the success of the meeting.

These current speciﬁcations still restrict the number of venues
that can host an ISMB. All venues visited since 2007 could have
hosted ISMBs with more than three times as many participants.
The additional costs for hosting more participants at a venue are
typically small. Put differently, the larger ISMB, the lower the
per-participant cost which could translate to lower registration
fees and a more secure future for ISCB.

Optimizing attendance. Eighty percent of ISCB’s members
work in North America and Western Europe. Not surprisingly,
analysis of participation statistics show that European members
are much more likely to attend meetings in Europe, and North
Americans are much more likely to attend those in North
America. The venue should therefore be as easy as possible to
reach for as many participants as possible. This is supported by
the observation that the number of North Americans attending
meetings in Europe, and Europeans attending meetings in North
America, has increased since ISCB has been held in venues that
are most easily reached from both sides of the Atlantic.
Obviously, this excludes many world regions with large and
active computational biology communities. An attempt to ad-
dress this issue was the initiation of a series of ISCB-x meetings
(ISCB-Africa, ISCB-Asia, ISCB-Latin America) that provide an
ISCB meeting in regions not typically visited by ISMB.

ISCB and ECCB agreed to co-host their meetings in the years
when ISMB is in Europe. We attempt to maximize attendance by
choosing venues as close as possible to major airline hubs that
serve as international entry ports. Identiﬁcation of a suitable

place for ISMB also involves additional dimensions such as ease
of obtaining visas for travel. As a point in case, for citizens from
many countries, it is easier to enter Canada than to enter the
USA. Nevertheless, holding ISMB in Canada means that mem-
bers who work in the USA with passports from countries that
require visa renewal upon re-entry are unable to attend without
the risk of a delayed or denied return after the conference.

Soft criteria: optimize success. Beyond the criteria mentioned
above, there are many other important issues to consider when
choosing ISMB venues. Essentially, all of those revolve around
the degree to which a venue furthers the contentment of at-
tendees and the extent to which it satisﬁes those involved in
organizing the meeting.

An important issue is the accessibility of the venue from the
airports/train stations as well as from the core of most frequented
hotels [in particular from the headquarter hotel (HQ hotel)].
Conversely, for the choice of the HQ hotel, it is important how
close this is to general sites of interest for delegates. Attractive
locations also leave a positive memory and increase the odds of
returning to other ISMBs (over 70% of all participants do
return).

The environment of the venue and/or the city must be able to
easily accommodate approximately 2000 participants. Many
conferences are organized in a hotel and all participants stay in
that hotel. This allows for the organizers to negotiate better con-
ditions in exchange for reserving a large block of rooms. Not so
for ISMB: almost half of the ISMB participants need accommo-
dations that are more affordable than can be negotiated with
hotels that feature conference facilities. Reserving a large block
of rooms comes with a substantial risk of ISCB having to pay for
any rooms that have not been used. Therefore, the block that
ISCB reserves with local hotels is relatively small in relation to
the amount of conference space required for the meeting. This
conservatively low number of contracted rooms results in some
cities/hotels showing less interest in our conference due to the
low rooms-to-space ratio.

Given the venue size that ISMB now needs, planning 1 year
ahead, as was done in the past, is insufﬁcient. Indeed, for the
Vienna 2007 meeting, site visits were conducted almost 2 years in
advance. It was, however, only at the point when the ISCB
Board approved the return to successful venues that contracts
were prepared well in advance: ISCB now has signed contracts
for the Berlin 2013 and Boston 2014 meetings, and we have al-
ready been working on identifying sites for the meetings in 2015
and 2016.

The search for suitable venues for 2015—2016 has been com-
plicated by economic challenges. Venues are becoming more ex-
pensive while funding for science continues to stagnate. Given
this, it is difﬁcult to counter the increased costs by raising regis-
tration fees (fee were last increased in 2007).

The attractiveness of the venue—city combination contributes
importantly to the perception of each ISMB’s success. The most
important soft criteria for any ISMB is that the meeting should
optimally support the scientiﬁc success, should formidably trig-
ger the dialogue and exchange between scientists, and should
contribute favorably to the growth and interests of ISCB mem-
bers. Put most simply: the happier the participants, the stronger
the conference becomes for the community as a whole. ISMB

venues must be positively memorable, must be efﬁcient and prac-
tical, and their surroundings must be pleasant.

A major challenge for all venues we have visited to date has
been the availability of sufﬁcient internet bandwidth. Despite the
fact that a convincing team handling IT is one selection criterion,
and that ISCB provides detailed requirements for IT infrastruc-
ture to the selected conference centers, every venue since 2007 has
realized within the ﬁrst hours of the main meeting that the inter-
net demands of ISMB are substantially higher than they typically
encounter, even as compared with what they considered to be
their most high-demand high-tech past conference clients.
Computational biology is a trendsetter in Internet, data and
computer needs. Even in 2011, very few large venues were fully
up to this challenge.

How to proceed? All venues chosen since 2007 navigated on
favorable winds through the optimization problem sketched
above. The ﬁve venues in Vienna, Toronto, Stockholm, Boston
and Long Beach stood out against twice as many others that
were not chosen. Each of those ﬁve had its own tradeoffs with
respect to the needs of ISMB.

Each of those venues also could have hosted many more par-
ticipants. Instead of being full, the meetings of 2007—2011 had
ample additional spaces we could have ﬁlled. But more import-
antly, the proceeds from that span of years provided ISCB with
just enough revenue to run at or slightly below our break-even
point. To dream in the most extreme way: had 5000 scholars
attended each ISMB since 2007, the Society could now double
its staff, triple its activities to beneﬁt members and still be ﬁnan-
cially secure for 50 years. Alternatively, the registration fee for all
participants could have been halved without losing revenue.

Most scientists generally prefer small workshops to large con-
ferences because small meetings increase the odds of meeting new
colleagues in relaxed environments. The main ISMB meeting
(excluding satellite meetings) has now been condensed to 3
days; it is preceded by 2 days of SIG meetings, the Student
Council symposium and tutorials. At ISMB/ECCB 2011 in
Vienna, we had 14 such pre-conference meetings. It has been
proposed that the SIG meetings could be scaled up to have
10x14 such meetings spread over a longer period. However,
ISCB simply does not have the human resources to do this. In
fact, ISCB now handles one immensely complex ISMB and six
other meetings with almost the same staff it had before it got
intensively involved with the organization of any meeting other
than ISMB.

Nevertheless, ISCB recognizes the needs of its members that
would beneﬁt from more specialized meetings. Diversiﬁcation
has been one answer to the challenges: ISCB now is managing
a total of seven different meeting series that lead to six meetings
each year: ISMB (bi-annual), ISMB/ECCB (bi-annual), ISCB-
Latin America (bi-annual: 2010, 2012, 2014), ISCB-Africa-
ASBCB (bi-annual, 2011, 2013), ISCB-Asia (annual: 2011,
2012), Rocky (annual, since 2003), CSHALS (annual, since
2008) and GLBIO (annual, since 2011). Other meetings are cur-
rently in the concept or evaluation stage and will likely follow as
early as next year.

The new meetings and other activities contribute importantly
to the growth and impact of the Society, to its scientiﬁc success,
and ultimately to the growth in membership. Financially, the six
non-ISMB meetings organized by ISCB collectively provide 25%

of the total proceeds of ISMB. As it stands, ISCB’s members
continue to beneﬁt from a successful, thriving ISMB.

We, the ISCB Executive Committee and ISCB Conferences
Committee Chairs, are writing this contribution to raise aware-
ness and with the motivation of increasing the base of those who
understand that your presence at ISMB is one important way in
which you can support your profession through participation in

the primary activities of your professional Society. ISCB mem-
bers thrive at ISMB and beneﬁt from its longevity and continu-
ation. ISCB also needs new meetings, new activities, new
adventures that satisfy our community’s thirst for information,
for education and for connecting with one another. For all of
that, ISCB needs your presence, your support and your passion!
We welcome your ideas and suggestions for how to proceed.

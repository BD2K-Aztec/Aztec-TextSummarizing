ABSTRACT

Summary: We present a tool for control-free copy number alteration
(CNA) detection using deep-sequencing data, particularly useful for
cancer studies. The tool deals with two frequent problems in the
analysis of cancer deep-sequencing data: absence of control sample
and possible polyploidy of cancer cells. FREEC (control-FREE Copy
number caller) automatically normalizes and segments copy number
profiles (CNPs) and calls CNAs. If ploidy is known, FREEC assigns
absolute copy number to each predicted CNA. To normalize raw
CNPs, the user can provide a control dataset if available; otherwise
GC content is used. We demonstrate that for Illumina single-end,
mate-pair or paired-end sequencing, GC-contentr normalization
provides smooth profiles that can be further segmented and analyzed
in order to predict CNAs.

1 INTRODUCTION

In many studies that apply deep sequencing to cancer genomes, one
has to calculate copy number proﬁles (CNPs) and predict regions
of gain and loss. There exist two frequent obstacles in the analysis
of cancer genomes: absence of an appropriate control sample for
normal tissue and possible polyploidy. Most current tools do not
take these points into account (Supplementary Table 1). For various
reasons, sequencing of an appropriate control sample is not always
possible. There is therefore a need for a bioinformatics tool able to
automatically detect copy number alterations (CNAs) without use of
a control dataset. Several programs have been published that allow
automatic calculation and analysis of CNPs (Chiang et al., 2009; Xie
and Tammi, 2009). However, both CNV—seq (Xie and Tammi, 2009)
and SegSeq (Chiang et al., 2009) need datasets for the given tumor
and its paired normal DNA. Moreover, both programs predict CNAs
without providing information about how many copies were lost or
gained. An interesting approach for predicting copy number variants
was suggested by Yoon et al. (2009), where GC content is used to
normalize data. However, to estimate the ‘normal’ copy number,

they rely on the assumption that there are similar percentages of
ampliﬁed and deleted regions, which is not true in general for cancer
cells. Moreover, their tool was designed to analyze normal human
genomes and is unable to take into account possible polyploidy.

Here, we propose an algorithm to call CNAs with or without a
control sample. The algorithm is implemented in the C++ program
FREEC (control—FREE Copy number caller). FREEC uses a sliding
window approach to calculate read count (RC) in non—overlapping
windows (raw CNP). Then, if a control sample is available, the
program normalizes raw CNP using the control proﬁle. Otherwise,
the program calculates GC content in the same set of windows and
performs normalization by GC content. Since this removes a major
source of variability in raw CNPs (Chiang et al., 2009; Yoon et al.,
2009), the resulting normalized proﬁle becomes sufﬁciently smooth
to apply segmentation. This is followed by the analysis of predicted
regions of gains and losses in order to assign copy numbers to these
regions.

2 METHODS

The algorithm includes several steps. First, it calculates the raw CNP
by counting reads in non—overlapping windows. If not provided by the
user, window size can be automatically selected using depth of coverage
information to optimize accuracy of CNA prediction. The second step is
proﬁle normalization. If a control is not provided by the user, we compute
the GC—content proﬁle. The normalization procedure of RC by GC content
(or by control RC) is described below. The third step is segmentation of
the normalized CNP. To do this, we implemented a LASSO—based algorithm
suggested by Harchaoui and Le’vy—Leduc (2008). Segmentation provided
by this algorithm is robust against outliers, which makes it suitable for
segmentation of deep—sequencing CNPs. The last step involves analysis of
segmented proﬁles. This includes identiﬁcation of regions of genomic gains
and losses and prediction of copy number changes in these regions.

To normalize a raw CNP, we ﬁt the observed RC by the GC content
(or the control RC if it is available). We base our ﬁtted model on several
assumptions: (i) the sample main ploidy P is provided, (ii) the observed RC
in P—copy regions (i.e. regions with copy number equal to P) can be modeled
as a polynomial of GC content (or of control RC), (iii) the observed RC in
a region with altered copy number is linearly proportional to the RC in
P—copy regions and (iv) the interval of measured GC contents (respectively
control RCs when a control dataset is available) in the main ploidy regions
must include the interval of all measured GC contents (respectively control
RC). The polynomial’s degree is a user—deﬁned parameter with a default
value of three. We provide an initial estimate of the polynomial’s parameters
and then optimize these parameters by iteratively selecting data points
related to P—copy regions and making a least—square ﬁt on these points only
(See Supplementary Methods for more details). The resulting polynomial

is then used to normalize the CNP (Fig. 1). The user has an option to
include mappability information into the normalization procedure (See
Supplementary Methods).

3 RESULTS

We applied the method to predict CNAs in mate—pair datasets for the
melanoma cell line COLD—829 and matched normal cell line COLO—
829BL (Pleasance et al., 2010), a paired—end dataset for the small—
cell lung cancer cell line NCI—H2l7l (Campbell et al., 2008) and a
single—end dataset for the breast cancer cell line HCC1143 (Chiang
et al., 2009). All four samples were sequenced using the Illumina
Genome Analyzer platform. The number of reads in samples varied
from 14 to 20 million (Supplementary Table 2).

The polynomial ﬁt by GC content explained well the observed
RC (Fig. lA—D). Using CNPs normalized by GC content, we
identiﬁed regions of gain and loss in the four samples (Fig. lE—H,
Supplementary Fig. 1—4). We also assessed true positive and false
positive rate for a normal diploid sample NA18507 (Alkan et al.,
2009; Bentley et al., 2008; Supplemenary Table 3).

We compared FREEC with three other existing tools: CNV—seq,
SegSeq and RDXplorer (Supplementary Tables 1 and 4). As well
as providing other additional functionalities, FREEC understands
more input formats than any other tool. It can be used to analyze
data produced for any organism and for polyploid genomes. Being
implemented in C++, FREEC shows excellent performance and
operating system portability.

4 CONCLUSION

We have presented a tool for automatic detection of CNAs and
calculation of CNA frequency. FREEC provides more functionalities

than existing tools; in particular, it can deal with the situation
when no control experiment is available and when the genome
is polyploid, frequent problems in cancer studies. The main steps
are (i) normalization of the CNP using GC content (or control
CNP if available), (ii) segmentation of normalized proﬁles and
(iii) assignment of copy number changes to losses and gains. The
program is fast, accurate and freely available.

ABSTRACT

Summary: We present our protein-protein interaction (PPI) network
visualization system RobinViz (reliability-oriented bioinformatic
networks visualization). Clustering the PP| network based on
gene ontology (GO) annotations or biclustered gene expression
data, providing a clustered visualization model based on a
central/peripheral duality, computing layouts with algorithms
specialized for interaction reliabilities represented as weights,
completely automated data acquisition, processing are notable
features of the system.

Availability: RobinViz is a free, open-source software protected
under GPL. It is written in C++ and Python, and consists of almost
30000 lines of code, excluding the employed libraries. Source code,
user manual and other Supplementary Material are available for
download at http://code.google.com/p/robinviz/.

1 INTRODUCTION

An observation applicable to most PPI networks is that they
contain proteins and interactions in large quantities. From an
information Visualization perspective, it is not desirable to present
the drawing of a large graph at a single shot for readability
purposes. A classical technique employed commonly in the graph
drawing ﬁeld is clustered Visualizations. In PPI settings, simply
applying this technique out of a blackbox without incorporating
suitable biological semantics is usually not enough. We construct a
Visualization model that applies the clustered Visualization technique
on the PPI networks domain by incorporating biological data in
the form of GO annotations and gene expression analysis results.
The core of the model consists of the central/peripheral duality
to represent the clustered Visualization. Central View contains an
abstract graph representing a clustering of the PPI network based
on GO annotations or biclustering analysis of gene expression data.
Each central cluster has its own peripheral window for a detailed
View and analysis of intracluster interactions. Within this model,
both the created abstract graphs and the PPI network itself are
weighted. Edge weights in the PPI network represent the reliability
of the interactions, whereas those in the created abstract graphs
represent the abundance of reliable cross—talks between clusters. An
additional feature of RobinViz is its incorporation of these weights

in the layout algorithms of all the involved graphs. Finally, the
incorporation of biclustering of gene expression data within the
PPI Visualization model of RobinViz may prove to be of value in
its own for biclustering analysis. Although several systems (Iragne
et al., 2005; Shannon et al., 2003; Smoot et al., 2011; Vlasblom
et al., 2006) incorporate the mentioned biological concepts in
their PPI network Visualizations in various ways, the suggested
Visualization model is more general and intuitive. Moreover, the
reliability orientation of the layout algorithms designed speciﬁcally
for this purpose is not reﬂected in most of the suggested systems;
see Supplementary Material for a detailed comparison of RobinViz
with other related systems.

2 SYSTEM OVERVIEW

RobinViz is designed with a non—programmer user in mind.
Therefore, no data formatting or data processing is necessary from
the user’s perspective. The only interaction is with a user—friendly
wizard and all the data acquisition, ﬁltering and processing are
done automatically according to user’s selections provided in a
sequence of dialogue boxes. With respect to the actual data usage,
the current version of RobinViz implements real—time data retrieval
from ﬁve major online databases: Biogrid (Stark et al., 2006) for
the input PPI network construction, Hitpredict (Patil et al., 2010)
for the assignment of interaction reliability values, GO tree (Carbon
et al., 2009) for determining partitioning categories when the co—
ontology concept is in use, GO annotations (Ashburner et al.,
2000) for the actual network partitioning according to category—gene
associations and GEO (Barrett and Edgar, 2006) for determining the
expression matrix to apply biclustering on when co—expression is
in use. Furthermore, RobinViz enables online automatic updates to
extract the most recent versions of these databases. To construct
the underlying PPI network to be Visualized, user can select
multiple experiments from multiple organisms in the appropriate
dialogue box. Since various data sources with possibly different
naming conventions are employed, we construct an SQLite database
which allows the system to do conversions between multiple
naming conventions. Appropriate repositories are downloaded from
the BioGrid database and the protein names are uniﬁed. The
data from all the interactions are merged and an underlying PPI
network is constructed. The network is further amended with
interaction reliability values by collecting the reliabilities from the
HitPredict database, normalizing them and associating each with the
corresponding interaction.

In order to integrate biological veriﬁcation data in Visualization,
we provide a two—level Visualization model: central view graph
and peripheral view graphs; see Figure 1. Both types of graphs

are weighted. Each central node is a collection of proteins from
the underlying PPI network. An edge between a pair of central
nodes corresponds to the union of interactions between the proteins
included in them. Associated with each central node, there is a
peripheral view graph containing all of its proteins and the edges
connecting them in the underlying network. If c0-0nt0l0gy is used
as the veriﬁcation concept of choice, each user—selected category
from the provided GO tree becomes a central node. Next a set
of GO annotation resources are selected by the user to assign the
proteins associated with that node. The marked annotations are
merged and ﬁltered according to the set of categories. The user may
also choose c0-expressi0n as the veriﬁcation concept. In this case,
one of the three popular biclustering algorithms from literature, CC,
BIMAX and REAL implemented within the system are presented
as alternatives. Once the algorithm and its speciﬁc parameters are
decided, the biclusters are computed accordingly. The set of proteins
corresponding to the genes found in each bicluster constitutes a
central node. Edges and the peripheral views are then computed as
described previously. With regards to the weights, if the co—ontology
concept is in use the weight of a central node is determined by the
PPI hit ratio, a combined measure of the size of the corresponding
PPI subnetwork in the peripheral view and of the density of the
high reliability interactions in it. With the co—expression concept,
user is provided with additional options including H—value and
functional enrichment values—common measures of biclustering
correlation. The weight of an edge between two central nodes is the
weighted sum of the reliability values of interactions between the
proteins included in them. Finally, the interaction reliability value
itself is the weight assigned to a peripheral graph edge. With such a
visualization model, each edge in the central graph provides clues of
potential false positives of the underlying PPI network as far as the
provided veriﬁcation concept and the corresponding central nodes
are concerned. Analogously, each disconnected pair of proteins in a
peripheral view provides information regarding the false negatives.
We note that the veriﬁcation process may also be viewed from

the opposite direction, giving rise to a bidirectional veriﬁcation
model; see Supplementary Material for further details. With regards
to the layout computations, we note that drawing constraints of
weighted graphs are not the same as those of unweighted graphs. In
drawings of weighted graphs, the neighborhood of a heavy—weight
node should not be too cluttered, heavy—weight edges should not
be too long and the crossings between heavy—weight edges should
be avoided. We provide weighted extensions of the popular graph
drawing algorithms in use, including the Spring Embedder, the
Sugiyama Style Layered Drawing and various circular—track based
methods, each extension aiming to satisfy the mentioned constraints.
A node coloring mechanism is embedded in the system to provide
further clues on GO categories. Each node in a peripheral view
is drawn as a colored pie. Each color represents a high—level GO
category that the protein corresponding to the node is associated
with. The pie chart of a central node is colored according to the
colors of the nodes in the corresponding PPI subnetwork thus
giving a clue regarding the high—level GO categories inside the
corresponding peripheral view. Further details regarding a node can
be obtained by right clicking on the node. Enrichment analysis
results including Bonferroni corrected P-values and enrichment
ratios based on high—level GO functional categories are available.
A second option available to nodes from both views is the online
information. To investigate the interactions of a speciﬁc protein in
more detail, user can display l—hop or 2—hop neighborhood of a
speciﬁc protein from a peripheral view. We note that in this case
not only the interactions residing in the peripheral view graph
but also all the interactions from the underlying PPI network
are visualized. In the co—expression mode, heatmap and parallel
coordinate visualizations are also generated for a detailed analysis
of the bicluster corresponding to a central node. Further aids include
search panel, selection focus, animation aids, session save/load
capabilities, and preconﬁgured parameter settings.

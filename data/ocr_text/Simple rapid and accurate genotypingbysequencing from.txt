ABSTRACT

Summary: Whole-genome sequencing has revolutionized the study of
genetics. Genotyping-by—sequencing is now a viable method of
genotyping, yet the bioinformatics involved can be daunting if not
prohibitive for some laboratories. Here we present ArrayMaker, a
user-friendly tool that extracts accurate single nucleotide polymorph-
ism genotypes at pre-defined loci from whole-genome alignments and
presents them in a standard genotyping format compatible with asso-
ciation analysis software and datasets genotyped on commercial array
platforms. Using this tool, geneticists with only basic computing ability
can genotype samples at any desired list of markers, facilitating
genome-wide association analysis, fine mapping, candidate variant
assessment, data sharing and compatibility of data sourced from
multiple technologies.

operating systems.

1 INTRODUCTION

The rapid evolution of whole-genome sequencing WVGS) tech-
nologies and decline in sequencing costs in recent years has seen
an increase in utilization of WGS in genetic experiments. Wide
ranging research questions can be asked of such datasets, but for
identifying genes underlying phenotypes of interest, genome
wide association analysis (GWAS) remains a crucial first step
in localizing candidate regions for sequence investigation.
Commercially available single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
arrays have been dedicated to this task, genotyping samples at
carefully selected informative markers. From WGS data, geno-
typing-by-sequencing (GBS) enables us to create array-type data,
yet a simple tool to extract SNP genotypes at informative sites
into array format is currently lacking. In light of this, we de-
veloped ArrayMaker tool to extract SNP genotypes from mam-
malian WGS alignments at pre-deflned loci with the resultant
output in a GWAS-ready format.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Producing array-type ﬁles at known informative markers en-
ables GWAS to be carried out on WGS datasets. It also offers an
interface for compatibility between WGS data and samples that
have been genotyped on commercial SNP array platforms.
ArrayMaker can also genotype samples at bespoke lists of
SNP markers, facilitating f1ne mapping and providing a means
of assaying candidate loci across multiple samples without
the need for extensive post-alignment steps. The sequencing
platform and alignment protocols used do not preclude compati-
bility of SNP genotypes called from various datasets, enabling a
platform-independent common language amongst samples
sourced from diverse studies.

2 METHODS

ArrayMaker operates on alignments in binary alignment/map (BAM)
format, and utilizes SAMtools (Li et al., 2009) to create a pileup of
sequence information at each locus in a user-deﬁned list. The
SAMtools SNP calling algorithm was recently shown to have favorable
accuracy when compared with other popular callers (Cheng et al., 2014).
The resultant variant call format ﬁle is converted into PLINK (Purcell
et al., 2007) transposed PED (tped) format, with genotypes possible in the
top or forward calling orientation. Genotypes can be extracted for a
single sample or many samples simultaneously. ArrayMaker can be
applied to alignments from any species for which a reference genome
exists.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Genotyping rate

ArrayMaker performance was tested on equine and canine
Illumina HiSquOOO datasets (Table l). Genotyping rate (GR)
was inﬂuenced by depth of sequence coverage (X) and experi-
ment-speciﬁc run conditions. The highest GR of 98.32% was
obtained from a sample sequenced to 14X. A 7X sample
showed a GR of 90.2%, while a sample from a previous run
on the same machine demonstrated 79.6% GR despite greater
than 12X. These results demonstrate the impact of sequence
quality on genotyping potential.

3.2 Concordance with commercial genotyping arrays

To perform high-throughput validation of ArrayMaker SNP
calls, genotypes from Illumina SNP arrays for the same samples
that were sequenced were used as the ‘truth-dataset’ (Table 1).
Mean concordance ranged between 98.48 and 99.46%.

ArrayMaker has four genotyping options: high or low strin-
gency calling, with genotypes checked or not checked against
expected alleles. Low stringency includes reads not mapped in
a proper pair. High stringency applies an extended base align-
ment quality calculation, downgrades mapping quality for
excessive mismatches and excludes loci signiﬁcantly affected by
strand bias. Failure of a checked ArrayMaker genotype to
concord with expected alleles after allowing for strandedness
(mismatch error, ‘Mis.’ Table l) downgrades a call to missing
status. The greatest concordance rate was observed when low
stringency was applied and genotypes were checked against ex-
pected alleles (Table l).

The predominant GBS error type was undercalls of heterozy-
gotes (false negatives; true genotype is polymorphic yet the call is
homozygous reference or ‘missing’) (Table 1). Low stringency
genotyping resulted in a lower proportion of heterozygote under-
calls and an increase in apparently false heterozygotes (false posi-
tives; true genotype is homozygous reference yet the call is
polymorphic) compared to high stringency. Of the increased
number of calls made using low stringency parameters, 86.3%
of these were concordant with the Illumina array call.

To further manipulate calling stringency, users can modify the
minimum and maximum sequence coverage required at a locus
to call a SNP. Decreasing the minimum coverage decreases the
false negative rate while increasing the false-positive rate through
undersampling of alleles. Increasing the minimum coverage
ameliorates this undersampling and thus improves the false posi-
tive rate, but also increases the false-negative rate (data not
shown). These results demonstrate how the choice of stringency
and genotype checking should be selected according to what type
of error structure is preferable, given the nature of the
experiment.

3.3 Run time and resources used

Number of samples and depth of sequence coverage had a
greater inﬂuence on run time than did total makers assayed
(Supplementary Fig. 51). Eight minutes (min) and less than
120 MB of RAM from a single processor core at 3.07GHz
was required to genotype two samples at 6.5X at 5000 markers,
compared to 28.5 min for the same number of markers and
samples at 16X, or 56.5 min for 12 samples at 65X.

4 CONCLUSION

ArrayMaker provides a straightforward method of quickly ex-
tracting accurate SNP genotypes from BAM ﬁles at any
combination of SNP loci. The tool can replicate existing and
obsolete SNP array datasets, create GWAS-ready ﬁles from
bespoke marker lists, and rapidly genotype candidate SNP loci
in new samples without the need for complicated post-alignment
bioinformatics. It requires minimal computing time and
resources and is user-friendly, written in Perl to run on a
Linux platform with simple command-line operation. Only an
alignment, a reference genome sequence, a list of SNP markers
and SAMtools are required. Additional steps such as formatting
the marker list, including the conversion of legacy array datasets
into current reference genome coordinates or the ascertainment
of dataset-polymorphic SNPs for ﬁne mapping or candidate
variant analysis, may be required prior to the application of
ArrayMaker using alternate tools such as LiftOver or
SAMtools, respectively. Following its use, ArrayMaker data
can be readily interrogated with PLINK (Purcell et al., 2007)
for the determination of population allele frequencies, GWAS
and other useful analyses.

Simple, rapid and accurate genotyping-by-sequencing

 

Given the shift towards WGS in genetic research projects,
GBS is increasing in popularity and there are many existing
tools that return accurate genotypes from whole-genome
sequence data. However, calling and ﬁltering variants can be a
daunting computational task for those inexperienced in
bioinformatics. ArrayMaker simpliﬁes the task of extracting
SNP genotypes at prescribed loci by packaging a popular calling
algorithm with a light resource footprint into a user-friendly tool
that emits genotypes in a human-readable, GWAS-ready format.

Abstract

Summary: The MSAViewer is a quick and easy visualization and analysis JavaScript component
for Multiple Sequence Alignment data of any size. Core features include interactive navigation
through the alignment, application of popular color schemes, sorting, selecting and filtering. The
MSAViewer is ‘web ready’: written entirely in JavaScript, compatible with modern web browsers
and does not require any specialized software. The MSAViewer is part of the BioJS collection of

components.

Availability and Implementation: The MSAViewer is released as open source software under the
Boost Software License 1.0. Documentation, source code and the viewer are available at http://

msa.biojs.netl.

Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

1 Introduction

Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) is a fundamental procedure to
capture similarities between sequences of nucleotides (DNA/RNA) or
of amino acids (protein). Biologically meaningful MSAs highlight and
capture sites with significant evolutionary conservation. MSAs are es—
sential to predict aspects of protein structure (e.g. secondary structure
(Rost, 2001) or protein disorder (Schlessinger et 61]., 2011)) and func—
tion [e.g. binding sites (Ofran et 61]., 2007) or localization (Goldberg
et 61]., 2014)]. MSAs can be used to understand genomic rearrange—
ments (Darling et 61]., 2004), to derive sequence homology (Altschul
et 61]., 1990) and to identify evolutionary rates (Pupko et 61]., 2002).
MSAs are widely used to display complex annotations relating
to structure and function, and to transfer those annotations to se—
quences that lack annotations (Waterhouse et 61]., 2009). Many tools
are available to view and analyze MSAs, including standalone

applications (Larsson, 2014; Waterhouse et 61]., 2009) and web app—
lets (Waterhouse et 61]., 2009). With the recent widespread adoption
of JavaScript as the leading programming language for interactive
web applications, new MSA viewing tools compatible with modern
web browsers have been developed and made available (Martin,
2014). BioJS is one particular collection of JavaScript components
with growing applications in biology (Corpas et 61]., 2014); it is
interoperable with many other data visualization tools.

Here, we describe the BioJS MSAViewer. It is readily loaded into
web pages to visualize and analyze MSA datasets of arbitrary sizes.
MSAViewer implements most features commonly available in other
popular MSA viewing software, including scrolling, selecting, high-
lighting, cross-referencing with protein feature annotations and
phylogenetic trees (a detailed comparison of features is in
Supplementary Table S1).

Fig. 1. A simplified view of the MSAViewer for the sequence alignment of protein VP24 within seven viruses of Filoviridae family. (A) Sequence logo (Schneider
and Stephens, 1990) representation with conservation patterns at each position in the MSA. (B) Bar chart showing amino acid conservation per position. (C) Main
MSA panel with residues in the alignment colored according to the Percentage Identity coloring scheme (Waterhouse et al., 2009). Percentage sequence identities

relative to consensus (consensus sequence not shown) are listed for each sequence. Filled red rectangles indicate sequence annotations provided by the user
[here: secondary structure predictions of PredictProtein (Yachdav et al., 2014)]. Red frames (indicated by two black arrows) are clusters of residues of ebolavirus
VP24 responsible for binding to karyopherin alpha nuclear transporters to suppress antiviral defense mechanism in human (Xu et al., 2014). (D) A compact over-
view MSA showing a bird's eye view of the full alignment. Yellow rectangles are two highlighted clusters in the main MSA panel. Despite the overall sequence
homology, the highlighted regions in ebolavirus (EBOV) proteins binding karyoprotein differ from those in Llovu cuevavirus (LLOV) and Lake Victoria marburgvi-
rus (MARV). MARV is known to not suppress host's antiviral defense mechanism (Xu et al., 2014). Though no experimental information on binding of LLOV VP24
to karyoproteins is available to date, the comparison of its sequence and structural features suggests a mechanism that is more similar to EBOV than to MARV

2 Visualization

The MSAViewer loads MSA data in FASTA (Pearson, 2000) or
CLUSTAL (Larkin et al., 2007) formats from a user’s local com—
puter or a web server. It then draws two main Canvas panels—the
main panel and the overview MSA panel (Fig. 1). The choice to use
Canvas over other rendering technologies is discussed in
Supplementary Material Section S1.

Navigation through the alignment is enabled through various
controls. First, users can scroll or use the ‘jump to a column’ menu
item to navigate to a certain column number. Second, users can pan
within the main panel to scroll through the alignment; this has pro—
ven to be a useful feature for large alignments. Finally, a second pan-
el—the overview panel (drawn under the main panel)—provides a
‘bird’s eye view’ perspective over the entire alignment and can also
be used for navigation.

The alignment is sortable by unique identifiers, sequence labels
and sequences. The percentage of gaps and the sequence identity to
the consensus sequence, which is calculated from most frequent
bases at each position in the alignment, can also be used for sorting.
Users can select sequences, columns, or arbitrary regions for ana-
lysis, and hide them from the main panel based on their selection,
conservation to the consensus sequence or the percentage of gaps.
An alignment can also be searched for motifs using a regular expres—
sion (e.g. K(K|R)RK for a nuclear localization signal), which are
highlighted with a red frame if matched. Sequence position annota—
tions, such as binding sites, are provided by a user and displayed as
filled rectangles below the corresponding sequence in the alignment.
Users can switch between 15 predefined color schemes. The
MSAViewer exports alignments and annotations as ASCII files, and
the visual representation as a publication—quality figure.

3 Summary

MSAViewer is a lightweight viewer for MSAs of arbitrary size. Being
JavaScript—based, it can be used on any modern web browser without
installing any specialized software or add—ons. As part of BioJS, the

MSAviewer can interoperate with a growing set of biological data
viewers. The phylogenetic tree and the sequence logo viewers are al—
ready integrated in the current release. Integration with new MSA
visualization techniques, e.g. sequence bundles (Kultys et al., 2014) is
planned. The MSAViewer has already been found useful and became
part of Galaxy (Giardine et al., 2005) https://cpt.tamu.edu/clustalw—
msa—and—visualisations and JalView (Waterhouse et al., 2009) http://
www.jalview.org/help/html/features/biojsmsa.html.

ABSTRACT

Summary: The human complement system is increasingly perceived
as an intricate protein network of effectors, inhibitors and regulators
that drives critical processes in health and disease and extensively
communicates with associated physiological pathways ranging from
immunity and inflammation to homeostasis and development.
A steady stream of experimental data reveals new fascinating connec-
tions at a rapid pace; although opening unique opportunities for
research discoveries, the comprehensiveness and large diversity of
experimental methods, nomenclatures and publication sources ren-
ders it highly challenging to keep up with the essential findings. With
the Complement Map Database (CMAP), we have created a novel and
easily accessible research tool to assist the complement community
and scientists from related disciplines in exploring the complement
network and discovering new connections.

1 INTRODUCTION

The complement system is an intricate protein network compris-
ing more than 50 plasma and membrane-bound proteins that
interact in a cascade manner (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Activation of the system can be achieved by three major initi-
ation pathways (classical, alternative and lectin) and culminate in
the generation of biologically active molecules that play import-
ant roles in many physiological and pathological processes
(Ricklin et al., 2010). Apart from its direct role in the mainten-
ance of body homeostasis, clearance of pathogens, and induction
of inﬂammation, the complement system also cross-talks with
and modulates the functions of other biological systems, such
as the coagulation cascade or toll-like receptor (TLR)-induced
signaling pathways (Ricklin et al., 2010).

The proper operation of such an intricate system relies on tight
control of complement activation by regulatory proteins.
Although excessive complement activation can lead to severe
damage to the host tissue with consequent induction of inﬂam-
matory and autoimmune diseases (Ricklin and Lambris, 2013),
lack of complement activation, as observed in complement

deﬁciency states, are also correlated with pathologies, such as
hereditary angioedema, systemic lupus erythematosus, kidney
diseases, recurrent infections and others (Reis et al., 2006;
Skattum et al., 2011).

The extensive numbers of reported molecular interactions that
build the base of the complement cascade, as well as the increas-
ing connections observed between proteins from the complement
and other biological systems, render it progressively challenging
to keep up with current information, even for researchers in the
ﬁeld. To offer a comprehensive view of the entire complement-
related network and facilitate systems research, we constructed
the Complement Map Database (CMAP, Supplementary Fig.
S2), a unique repository focused on documented molecular inter-
actions described within the complement cascade and between
complement and other biological systems.

2 DATA MODEL

Data in CMAP are organized into three levels: entities, relations
and pathways. Entities are deﬁned as proteins, small molecules
and complexes (protein—protein, protein-small molecule).
Relations are interactions between entities such as complex as-
sociations, covalent modiﬁcations, substrate conversion (cata-
lytic) and activation and inhibition processes. Pathways in
CMAP are composed of a main map (Supplementary Fig. S1),
which is presented as a network model, and several focus maps
that visualize networks involved in cross-talk, immune evasion or
disease states (Table l and Supplementary Figs S3—S6). Each
connection between complement components and their ligands
shown in the fully searchable maps is hyperlinked and contains
information about the publication sources (e.g. link to PubMed)
and the analytical methods used for describing the interaction
(Supplementary Table S1). Information contained in CMAP is
entirely based on published experimental data and is fully revised
by experts in the ﬁeld. Additionally, links to external databases
(e. g. NCBI, UniProt, Geo, HGNC and others) provided for each
component further ensure rapid and focused gathering of infor-
mation for a particular connection. The web interface, which was
inspired by popular online search and cartography services,
allows users to quickly pan, zoom and search the map.
Further, speciﬁc CMAP interactions can be exported in XML
and J SON format. CMAP is based on established technologies
to ensure high compatibility: data are stored in a MySQL data-
base, and the user interface is written in PHP and J avaScript (see
Supplementary Methods for additional technical details).

3 APPLICATION
3.1 Case study: CSa

CMAP can be used to learn biological functions of complement
components, assist in experimental design and provide informa-
tion that supports experimental observations. The potent pro-
inﬁammatory mediator C5a may serve as an important real-life
example of CMAP’s usability. By searching for the keyword
‘C5a’, users get a table containing all the direct interactions be-
tween C5a and other proteins, such as the anaphylatoxin recep-
tors C5aR and C5L2 (Fig. 1A and B). The same table also
reveals that C5a is a fragment of complement component C5
and gets generated not only by the endogenous C5 convertases
(e.g. C3bBb3b) but also by coagulation factors and the microbial
proteins gingipain—l and streptococcal peptidase. Another sec-
tion of the information panel indicates that C5a is involved in
the modulation of the coagulation system and TLR-induced

responses, in microbial immune evasion (Staphylococcus
aureus), and in cancer and tumor development (Fig. 1C). Users
can ﬁnd additional information on C5a-mediated functions and
interactions by exploring the cross-talk maps and clicking on the
references symbol next to individual functions or interaction
links (Fig. 1C). Finally, buttons on each connection arrow
reveal the experimental methods and publications on which the
observations are founded. With the help of CMAP, researchers
can learn the role of complement proteins in different processes
quickly, intuitively and comprehensively.

4 CONCLUSION

CMAP is a novel and easily accessible research tool to assist the
complement community and scientists from related disciplines in
exploring the complement network and discovering new connec-
tions. In contrast to many other pathway maps, CMAP is tai-
lored to the complement system and its cross-talk with
endogenous pathways and exogenous modulators, logically orga-
nized according to the hierarchy of the cascade, and entirely
based on experimental interaction data that have been reported
in scientiﬁc journals and reviewed by expert scientists before
addition to the database. The user-friendly interface allows
easy accessibility and exploration of the site. Although offering
a highly comprehensive and well-founded overview in its current
form, we expect CMAP to improve even further with the help of
and input from the complement community, thereby truly put-
ting complement on the map for many research disciplines.

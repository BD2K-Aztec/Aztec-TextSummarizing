Abstract

Motivation: Transposable elements (TEs) can be found in virtually all eukaryotic genomes and
have the potential to produce evolutionary novelty. Despite the broad taxonomic distribution of
TEs, the evolutionary history of these sequences is largely unknown for many taxa due to a lack of
genomic resources and identification methods. Given that most TE annotation methods are de-
signed to work on genome assemblies, we sought to develop a method to provide a fine-grained
classification of TEs from DNA sequence reads. Here, we present a toolkit for the efficient annota-
tion of TE families from low-coverage whole-genome shotgun (WGS) data, enabling the rapid iden-
tification of TEs in a large number of taxa. We compared our software, Transposome, with other
approaches for annotating repeats from WGS data, and we show that it offers significant improve-
ments in run time and produces more precise estimates of genomic repeat abundance.
Transposome may also be used as a general toolkit for working with Next Generation Sequencing
(NGS) data, and for constructing custom genome analysis pipelines.

Availability and implementation: The source code for Transposome is freely available (http://sesta
ton.github.io/Transposome), implemented in Perl and is supported on Linux.

1 Introduction

 

Genomic repeat annotation is a challenging task, in part because
there are dozens of tools available and not all have not been ana-
lyzed in terms of performance or accuracy (Leret, 2010). Current
approaches for identifying transposable elements (TEs) involve using
structural and similarity-based approaches with a genome assembly
(Ellinghaus et al., 2008; Steinbiss et al., 2009; Xu and Wang, 2007),
mathematical or k-mer based methods from genome assemblies or
random sequence reads (Bao and Eddy, 2002; Kurtz et al., 2008),
signature-based methods with annotated TEs (Wheeler et al., 2013),
and cluster-based approaches from unassembled sequence reads

(Novak et al., 2010, 2013). Without question, the most accurate
method for identifying TEs would be through a combination of the
above methods (Bergman and Quesneville 2007; Leret, 2010; Saha
et al., 2008). One caveat with the aforementioned approaches is that
most require a reference genome (i.e. assembled genome) as input. It
is not, however, practical to generate a reference genome for every
species of interest given that genome sequencing costs remain pro-
hibitively high for non-model species, and genome assembly algo-
rithms are not able to easily resolve large and complex genomes
(Alkan et al., 2011), such as those of many plant species. Therefore,
the ideal solution to improving repeat annotation from understudied

species would be to leverage high-throughput DNA sequencing tech-
nologies, enabling phylogenetic descriptions of TE properties in
many species simultaneously.

Here we present Transposome, a toolkit that is able to accurately
estimate the genomic abundance of TE families from very low cover-
age whole-genome shotgun (WGS) data, enabling the rapid detec-
tion of changes in genome composition across many species.
Transposome borrows much of its design from RepeatExplorer
(Novak et al., 2013), a recently published tool for detecting repeats
from WGS data. RepeatExplorer provides an easy-to-use web inter-
face for users; however, we found this tool to be computationally in-
efficient and the design is not modular, which makes analyses of
multiple species and designing custom pipelines impractical.
Transposome builds on the basic approach of RepeatExplorer,
which is finding similarity in the genome through a graph-based
analysis of similarity between WGS reads. We extend this approach
in Transposome to provide a more fine-scale level of annotation of
genomic repeats, and we provide direct estimates of genomic repeat
abundance in biological terms.

We demonstrate the utility of Transposome by analyzing a set of
WGS reads from the well-studied maize (Zea mays L.) genome, and
we compare our results to published estimates of genome compos-
ition for this species. Our findings indicate that Tranposome is both
more accurate at quantifying genomic repeats, and more efficient
than other approaches (Supplementary Table S1).

2 Methods

The approach we implemented consists of two steps. First, we
developed a highly parallel all versus all sequence comparison
procedure to find shared similarity within the genome. This step
makes use of mgblast (Pertea et al., 2003), a modified version of
megablast that is memory efficient. Second, we use a graph-based
clustering method that is able to handle very large datasets
(Blondel et al., 2008) efficiently and makes use of edge weight
information (which corresponds to similar sequence pairs in this ap-
plication). This algorithm is very fast, graphs grow like O(n), but
one caveat is that it over-refines clusters leading to a separation of
defined groups (Fortunato, 2010). We modified this algorithm by
using paired-end sequence information to find union in the graph
constructed during the clustering processes, and this allows us to cir-
cumvent the issue of over-refinement of clusters by using biological
information.

Every sequence clustered by Transposome represents a repetitive
element within the genome, and these sequences are compared to a
reference library of repeat sequences using blastn from the BLAST+
package (Camacho et al., 2009), along with singleton sequences that
are not clustered. Perhaps the most useful feature of Transposome is
that results are translated directly into estimates of genomic compos-
ition of each repeat type, and the full taxonomic lineage of each re-
peat type is listed to the family level.

The novelty of Transposome is that it offers a programmatic
interface, via a Perl API, for manipulating FASTA or FASTQ data,
finding similarity in a read set and annotating genomic repeats.
Thus, users can construct custom analysis pipelines, or repeat parts
of the analysis with varied parameters without unnecessarily repeat-
ing an entire pipeline of operations. In addition, Transposome can
be used for the general task of manipulating NGS data and BLAST
reports. Examples of usage and scripts are provided on the
Transposome API Wiki page (https://github.com/sestaton/
Transposome/wiki/API-Tutorial) and the separate transposome-
scripts repository (https://github.com/sestaton/transposome-scripts).

3 Results

How effectively are we sampling the genomic diversity of repetitive
elements? To address this question, we sampled sequence data from
maize at varying levels of genome coverage and performed an ana-
lysis with Transposome using default parameters on each read set
(see Supplementary Information). As we know what fraction of the
maize genome is comprised of TEs, we were also able to assess the
total fraction of diversity being sampled at varying levels of genome
coverage (i.e. the total percent of the genome). The maize genome is
>85 % TEs (Schnable et al., 2009), with approximately 70% of the
genome being composed of just 20 TE families (Baucom et al.,
2009). With just 100,000 randomly sampled paired-end sequences
(see Supplementary Information), Transposome was able to cor-
rectly identify 17 of the top 20 families, with the top 11 families
being correctly identified as in Baucom et al. (2009), albeit with
minor reordering (Supplementary Fig. S1). We note that
Transposome also generates estimates of genomic repeat abundance
faster than other annotation procedures (Supplementary Table S1).

How many sequence reads are required to capture the majority
of the TEs by genome coverage? It is clear that Transposome is able
to accurately predict the abundance of TEs and the number of TE
families by rank that account for that genome abundance
(Supplementary Fig. 52). This result indicates that it is not necessary
to have high genome coverage sequence data (i.e. >1%) in order to
predict the genomic abundance of TE families, though increasing
coverage will yield more accurate estimates of TE diversity and fam-
ily-level abundance (Supplementary Figs 2 and 3).

4 Conclusions

Transposome is a toolkit for rapidly determining the genomic abun-
dance of repeats from low coverage WGS data, requiring less than
1% genome coverage to obtain reliable estimates of TE family abun-
dance in just a few minutes. We have further demonstrated that a
small increase in genome coverage (e.g. 3—5%) allows Transposome
to produce even more accurate estimates of family-level genomic
abundance and TE diversity in the genome.

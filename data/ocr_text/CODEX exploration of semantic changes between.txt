ABSTRACT

Summary: Life science ontologies substantially change over time
to meet the requirements of their users and to include the newest
domain knowledge. Thus, an important task is to know what has been
modified between two versions of an ontology (diff). This diff should
contain all performed changes as compact and understandable as
possible. We present CODEX @mplex Qntology Diff Qplorer), a tool
that allows determining semantic changes between two versions of
an ontology, which users can interactively analyze in multiple ways.
Availability and implementation: CODEX is available under
http: //www. izbi .de/codex and is supported by all major
browsers. It is implemented in Java based on Google Web Toolkit
technology. Additionally, users can access a web service interface to
use the diff functionality in their applications and analyses.

1 INTRODUCTION

Recently ontologies have become very popular in the life sciences.
They consist of a harmonized vocabulary of terms (concepts)
describing and structuring a domain of interest. Their main
application is the consistent and uniform description (annotation)
of biological entities such as genes and proteins enabling analyses
such as term enrichment or gene expression data studies. The
most used ontology in bioinformatics is the Gene Ontology
(GO) (Harris et al., 2004) consisting of subontologies for molecular
functions, biological processes and cellular components. A huge
number of life science ontologies are managed within the Open
Biomedical Ontologies Foundry (OBO) (Smith et al., 2007), which
has established the common OBO format as representation language.

The content of ontologies is not static. Due to new knowledge
(e. g. from experimental results) or design errors made in earlier
versions, they underlie continuous changes to enhance their quality.
The OnEX tool (Hartung et al., 2009) already allows studying
the evolution of life science ontologies over the recent years, e. g.
one may notice that the Biological Processes of GO doubled in
their size to ~21000 concepts between 2006 and 2011. However,
OnEX considers rather simple changes (e. g. concept additions and
deletions) such that there is still an increasing need to ﬁgure out
what has exactly been changed between the two versions of an
ontology (diff). The complexity and size of life science ontologies

requires that a diff should be as compact and human—understandable
as possible. Semantic changes such as concept merges, additions of
entire subgraphs or moves of concepts should be reported instead
of long lists of rather basic changes as generated by tools such as
obodiﬁ‘ of OBO—Edit (Day—Richter et al., 2007). A semantic diff
can be valuable for both ontology users and developers, e.g. if a user
likes to perform a term enrichment analysis based on a new ontology
version, she may be interested in revised concepts compared with the
previously used version, or a developer likes to know which changes
were performed in the last year to plan future modiﬁcations. Current
ontology browsers such as AmiGO or Ontology Lookup Service are
limited to the latest available version and do not offer diff facilities.
We therefore present CODEX, a web tool to ad hoc compute a
semantically rich diff between two ontology versions.

2 OVERVIEW OF CODEX

CODEX consists of a web front—end, a web service interface and a repository
for diff calculations at the back—end. The main diff algorithm used by
CODEX is described in Hartung et al. (2010). Particularly, it ﬁrst performs
a match between the input versions to determine equal or slightly changed
ontology elements. It then generates a basic diff which is based on simple
changes: add, del and map of concepts, relationships and attributes. Taking
this basic diff as input, an iterative application of rules generates more
and more semantic changes (e.g. merge, split, substitute, move, addLeaf,
addSubGraph, toObsolete, ...) as long as a compaction is possible. Thus, the
ﬁnal diff result represents the most compact diff between the input versions.
For a full list and description of supported changes, we refer to Hartung
et al. (2010) or the help pages of CODEX. We will now describe the web
front—end and web service of CODEX in more detail and then show some
application results from determining diffs for selected ontology versions.

2.1 Web front-end

The web front—end contains two main sections as displayed in Figure 1. The
input section offers different possibilities to specify the input versions for
a diff computation. CODEX supports ontologies formatted in OBO as well
as OWL. First, users can directly put the ontology contents into appropriate
text areas (A1). Second, one can simply provide the URLs of the ontology
versions to process (A2). Third, there is the possibility to upload ontology
ﬁles stored on the local machine of a user (A3). Finally, ontology versions
already available in OnEX can be selected as input (A4). Currently, OnEX
provides access to ~850 versions of 16 ontologies. For each variant, a submit
button is used to start the diff computation after the input has been speciﬁed.
Example buttons allow for running predeﬁned examples.

After the online diff computation, users can enter the result analysis
section to explore the resulting diff in more detail. For a ﬁrst overview,
one can study the Overall Statistics (B1) of the ontology versions and their
diff. Version statistics such as number of concepts and relationships, the

Fig. 1. Web front—end of CODEX. The input section (A) offers different input possibilities: (A1) copy/paste ontology contents, (A2) specify web URLs, (A3)
upload of ontology ﬁles or (A4) use versions of OnEX. In the result analysis section (B), users can analyze the diff result in multiple ways: (B1) Overall
Statistics, (B2) Change Explorer, (B3) Change Navigator, (B4) Change Impact and (B5) Download/Export.

diff sizes as well as growth rates are presented in a table. Furthermore, the
content of the diff can be analyzed via pie charts (with different selection
options) such that users can recognize the occurred changes and their
frequencies.

The Change Explorer (B2) utilizes tag clouds to present the most frequent
changes or elements that have been inﬂuenced by a change. If users click on
the displayed terms, they can explore the corresponding changes in a tree—
like manner. The root nodes show the change type and its frequency. For
each change one can drill down into its details, i.e. one can inspect the basic
changes that belong to a complex change, e.g. all concept and relationship
additions involved in a subgraph addition. A similar functionality is offered
by the Change Navigator (B3) where one can ﬂexibly drill through the
compact diff starting at the most compact changes.

The Change Impact Analysis (B4) offers the possibility to ﬁnd out which
concepts of a given set of accession numbers of interest were inﬂuenced
by a change or not. Again tag clouds and tree—based navigation simplify
the exploration of changes. Finally, Download/Export (B5) can be used to
copy/paste results of the diff for further processing. On the one hand, it is
possible to access the overall diff statistics, e.g. for generating summaries
or charts. On the other hand, all determined changes are presented in text
format and can thus be reused in further application and analysis scenarios.

2.2 Web Service

In addition to the web front—end application, programmers are able to
access the diff functionality via a web service interface available at
http://dbserv2.informatik.uni—leipzig.de:4478/contodiff_ws?WSDL. Using
the provided WSDL description, they can generate corresponding client
classes that enable web service interaction. Particularly, the service accepts
OBO, OWL or OnEX ontology versions as input and generates the compact
as well as the basic diff as output.

3 APPLICATION

We apply CODEX to determine and analyze the difference between
selected ontology versions. First, we compute the diff between the
July and November 2010 version of the Sequence Ontology (Eilbeck
et al., 2005) [see example in (A1)]. There is an increase of about
2% and the resulting diff contains 260 changes whereby semantic
changes such as toObsolete (81) and move (54) dominate [see tag
cloud in (B2)]. This shows that a lot of knowledge has been revised.

In contrast, eight subgraphs have been inserted; the largest one
(SO:0001659—promoter_element) contained 11 concepts.

As a second example, we determine the diff between the January
and December 2010 version of GO Molecular Functions [see
example in (A4)]. This time the ontology grew by ~3% and the
diff encompasses 3300 changes. The changes are dominated by
attribute value changes (2423) especially changes of deﬁnitions.
Other frequent semantic changes are moves of concepts (188) and
leaf additions (169). However, there was a huge amount of revisions
including merges (60) as well as obsolete changes (20). The largest
of the 33 added subgraphs with 29 new concepts is GO:0000988
(protein binding transcription factor activity).

4 CONCLUSION

The presented CODEX application allows to compare different
ontology versions and determines a compact diff based on semantic
changes. Thus, users can ﬂexibly determine semantic diffs and use
this knowledge for understanding the ontology evolution or to adapt
dependent data. The application can be accessed via an interactive
web front—end or a web service interface.

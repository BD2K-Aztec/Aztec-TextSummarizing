ABSTRACT

Motivation: Cancer development is a complex and heterogeneous
process. It is estimated that 5—10% of human genes probably contrib-
ute to oncogenesis, whereas current experimentally validated cancer
genes only cover 1% of the human genome. Thus hundreds of cancer
genes may still remain to be identified. To search for new genes that
play roles in carcinogenesis and facilitate cancer research, we de-
veloped a systematic workflow to use information saved in a previ-
ously established tumor-associated gene (TAG) database.

Results: By exploiting the information of conserved protein domains
from the TAG, we identified 183 potential new TAGs. As a
proof-of—concept, one predicted oncogene, fyn-related kinase (FRK),
which shows an aberrant digital expression pattern in liver cancer
cells, was selected for further investigation. Using 68 paired hepato-
cellular carcinoma samples, we found that FRK was up-regulated in
52% of cases (P< 0.001). Tumorigenic assays performed in Hep3B
and HepG2 cell lines revealed a significant correlation between the
level of FRK expression and invasiveness, suggesting that FRK is a
positive regulator of invasiveness in liver cancer cells.

Conclusion: These findings implied that FRK is a multitalented signal
transduction molecule that produces diverse biological responses in
different cell types in various microenvironments. In addition, our data
demonstrated the accuracy of computational prediction and sug-
gested that other predicted TAGs can be potential targets for future
cancer research.

1 INTRODUCTION

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the ﬁfth most common
cancer worldwide (Caldwell and Park, 2009) and shows high
prevalence in Asia and Africa (Bosch et al., 2004). According
to the annual report from the Bureau of Health Promotion,

Department of Health, Taiwan (http://www.bhp.doh.gov.tw/
bhpnet/portal/Default.aspx), HCC is the second most common
cancer in the Taiwanese population but is the leading cause of
cancer-related death in Taiwanese males. Although recent studies
have revealed many genetic and epigenetic changes that lead to
the aberrant activation of several signaling cascades, including
epidermal growth factor receptor and Ras/extracellular signal-
regulated kinase (Llovet and Bruix, 2008), the pathogenesis of
HCC is heterogeneous among patients (Cha and Dematteo,
2005), so the molecular mechanisms of hepatocarcinogenesis
remain largely unclear.

Cancer development is a complex and heterogeneous process
and it may be brought about by multiple causes, including chem-
ical and physical mutation, viral or bacterial infection and her-
editary mutations (Carrillo-Infante et al., 2007; Fasano and
Muggia, 2009; Kuper et al., 2002). Furthermore, cancer is con-
sidered to be a genetic disease and develops, at least in part,
because of DNA damage (Vogelstein and Kinzler, 2004).
Generally speaking, genes involved in tumorigenesis are divided
into two basic categories based on their actions: oncogenes and
tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) (Bowden et al., 1994). While
oncogenes encode proteins that control cell proliferation and/
or apoptosis (Croce, 2008), a TSG is a protein that protects a
cell from entering the course of carcinogenesis (Sherr, 2004). It
has been suggested that 5—10% of human genes probably con-
tribute to oncogenesis (Strausberg et al., 2003), whereas current
experimentally validated cancer genes only cover 1% of the
human genome (Futreal et al., 2004), suggesting that hundreds
of cancer genes still remain to be identiﬁed.

A structural element is the signature of a protein that speciﬁes
the unique function of that protein. Typically, structural elements
like domains or motifs provide clues to the functions of otherwise
uncharacterized proteins and are often used to search for novel
members of a protein family (Hawkins and Kihara, 2007). Many
new proteins belonging to various families have been identiﬁed
through in silico approaches in humans and other species
(Masignani et al., 2004; Schutte et al., 2002). For example,
based on the well-known ﬁve major cysteine-rich domains,
Chen et a]. (2004) found a novel gel-forming mucin (MUC19/
Mucl9) in glandular tissues using a hidden Markov model-
based genome-wide search approach. Another example is the
identiﬁcation of new claudin family members with a
PSI-BLAST-based approach Wu et al., 2006). These studies

Oncogenic potential of fyn-related kinase in hepatocellular carcinoma

 

demonstrate that computer-assisted approaches are efﬁcient and
ﬂexible for identifying novel members of domain-sharing protein
families.

We hypothesized that genes involved in tumorigenesis, espe-
cially functionally distinct groups of genes like oncogenes and
TSGs, code for global protein families; thus the members within
a group may share common domains that are signatures of their
unique pathophysiological function. If so, the well-characterized
tumor-associated protein domains can be used to search for
novel proteins that may be involved in tumorigenesis. To test
this hypothesis, we ﬁrst established a tumor-associated gene
(TAG) database (http://www.binfo.ncku.edu.tw/TAG/) to pro-
vide information about commonly shared functional domains
in well-characterized oncogenes and TSGs (Chan et al., 2007).
Using TAG genes as a training set followed by computer-assisted
searching in the human genome, we identiﬁed 183 candidates
with the potential to be involved in tumorigenesis. For a
proof-of—concept study, one candidate, Fyn-related kinase
(FRK), was chosen and its oncogenic potential for invasiveness
in HCC was validated.

2 MATERIAL AND METHODS

2.1 Architecture of tumor-associated gene database

All genes collected in the TAG database were identiﬁed through a
text-mining approach. The comprehensive search used ‘oncogene’,
‘tumor suppressor gene’ and ‘humans’ as keywords and searched in the
ﬁelds of ‘Abstract’ and ‘Title’ from 1970 to 2010 in the PubMed database
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/). A semi-automatic information
retrieval engine was designed using Perl Script Language. The system
collected speciﬁc information from various internet resources and
stored it in the TAG database. In general, gene-related information
was collected from Entrez Gene (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/qu-
ery.fcgi?db=gene), Gene Ontology (http://www.geneontology.org/) and
GeneCards (http://www.genecards.org/), whereas protein-related infor-
mation was collected from SwiSSProt (http://www.expasy.org/Sprot/),
InterPro (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/) and Blocks (http://blockS.
mcrc.org/).

The TAG was constructed using MySQL on the RedHat Linux (V7.3)
operating system. The database consists of ﬁve tables: gene content, gene
ontology, disease, protein domain and TAG domain weight-matrix. Each
table summarizes attributes for a speciﬁc entity related to the TAGS. The
original TAG database was established in 2007 (Chan et al., 2007) and
was updated in 2010 to include newly published genes involved in cancer
development. Currently, the TAG database contains information on 246
oncogenes, 265 TSGS and 151 genes related to tumorigenesis.

2.2 Construction of weight-matrix table of TAG domains

To deﬁne the weight of a TAG domain, 246 oncogenes and 265 TSGS
from the current TAG database were used as the training set in the fol-
lowing analysis. The 2D term frequency formula was adapted from the
term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf—idf) and used to construct
the weight-matrix table of TAG domains. The tf—idf weight is often used
in information retrieval and text mining (Salton and Buckley, 1988). This
weight is a statistical measure used to evaluate how important a word is
to a document in a collection. The importance increases proportionally to
the number of times a word appears in the document (i.e. If) but is offset
by the frequency of the word in the document (i.e. df). The original term
frequency in a given document gives a measurement of the importance of
the term within the particular document.

I’lLJ'
Zk "16,1

In this case, niJ- is the number of occurrences of a speciﬁed term iin the
document d], and the denominator is the sum of the total number of oc-
currences of all terms in the document  In our case, the ‘term’ represents
each TAG domain and the ‘document’ is either an oncogene or TSG
group. To evaluate whether a TAG domain contributing to the
domain-containin g protein functions as oncogene or TSG, we ﬁrst counted
the number of appearances of all TAG domains in the oncogene and TSG
groups and listed them in a table. Then we used the frequencies of a given
TAG domain within the group (i.e. oncogene) and across groups (i.e.
oncogene and TSG) to represent the importance and speciﬁcity of each
TAG domain, respectively. The mathematical 2D term frequency formula
used to calculate the weight of a TAG domain was as follows:

1ft}:

 

"is "is
Ij

J
2 7%; Z ":31

 

Wis =

where WU- represents the weight for a domain in the ith row and jth
column in the table, and niJ- is the number of occurrences of a speciﬁed
domain 1' in the group j. While k is from 1 to I], and I]- StandS for the
number of different domains in the group j, l is from 1 to J, and J stands
for the number of different groups. Under current settings in the weight-
matrix table, there are only oncogene and TSG groups, so J equals 2. The
denominator on the left is the sum of the total number of all domains in a
group j. The denominator on the right is the sum of the total number of a
speciﬁed domain 1' in all groups. The weight increases when the appear-
ance of a given domain in the speciﬁed group is high and across multiple
groups is low; therefore the weight tends to enhance the relative import-
ance of a domain in one group versus the other. A weight-matrix table
was generated based on the domain information from all TAGS, and each
TAG domain has an oncogene weight and a TSG weight (Supplementary
Table S1). The oncogenic potential of any protein is the score summed
from all domains present in the given protein.

2.3 Computational identification of new TAGS

We analyzed the domain information, constructed a weight-matrix table
and determined the cutoff values for deﬁning ‘oncogene’ and ‘TSG’ using
the training set data. The workﬂow for new TAG prediction (Fig. 1) is based
on the human full-length cDNA (FLC) sequences retrieved from the NCBI
GenBank database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/). All FLC se-
quences were then translated by the transeq tool (http://emboss.source—
forge.net/appS/cvs/transeq.html). The deduced amino-acid sequences
were used to screen for the presence of TAG domains using InterProScan
(http://www.ebi.ac.uk/InterProScan/). Following the procedure used to
assign scores for proteins in the training sets, every individual amino-acid
sequence had two scores, one each for the oncogene and TSG group.
Individual sequences that had a score that passed the cutoff value for an
oncogene or TSG were considered to be TAG candidates. The overall
workﬂow for computational TAG identiﬁcation is given in Figure 1.

To understand the properties and physiological signiﬁcance of the
predicted new TAGS, genes that were considered to be new TAGS were
further analyzed for gene ontology using the MetaCore software suite
(GeneGo, St Joseph, MI, USA). Signiﬁcance probability was calculated
using the hypergeometrical distribution based on gene ontology terms.

2.4 Specimens and cell lines

A total of 68 paired HCC samples (tumor and matched non-tumor) as well
as four HCC cell lines (Hep3B, HepG2, PLC/PRF/S and Huh7) were used
to study the role of a candidate TAG in liver tumor development. All of the
tissue samples were freshly frozen at —80°C until further analysis.
The detailed information of both HCC patients and cell lines was given
previously (Chen et al., 2012).

2.5 Detection of endogenous FRK

Multiple tissue cDNA panels (BioChain, Hayward, CA, USA) and liver
cancer cell lines were used to detect the endogenous mRNA expression
pattern of FRK using the primers FRK-F: 5’ -GTCCCAGC
TCCATTTGATTT-3’ and FRK-R: 5’-TTTTCACTGCTACTGGAG
TGGT-3’. In addition, total protein prepared from cultured cells and
paired HCC samples was subjected to western blot analysis.

2.6 Transient overexpression of FRK and RNA
interference

FRK-overexpressing and pcDNA3.1+ plasmids were from Origene
(Rockville, MD, USA) and Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA), respect-
ively. The lentiviral Short hairpin RNA (ShRNA) clones that targeted
the Luc or FRK genes were from the National RNAi Core Facility of
Academia Sinica, Taiwan. The experiments on overexpression and
knockdown of FRK in HepG2 and Hep3B cells were performed with a
procedure Similar to that described previously (Chen et al., 2012).
OverexpreSSion and knockdown of FRK protein were conﬁrmed by west-
ern blotting. All knockdown and transient overexpression experiments
were performed in triplicate and at least three times independently.

2.7 Cell proliferation assay

The Hep3B and HepG2 cells were transfected with FRK construct and
pcDNA3.1+, respectively, in 60-mm diSheS. Six hours after transfection,
trypsinized cells were suspended in culture medium and ~5 X 103 cells
were seeded in 96-well plates (each group had four wells). Cell prolifer-
ation was assessed using a colorimetric assay (CellTiter 96® AQueouS One
Solution cell proliferation assay; Promega, Madison, WI, USA) at vari-
ous time points. The color intensity was measured at 490nm using a
96-well plate reader (Labsystems, Multiskan EX, Helsinki, Finland).
The corrected absorbance (after subtracting control blanks) was used
to determine the proliferative response. All experiments were repeated
independently at least three times.

2.8 Cell invasion assay

The invasion assay was performed using transwells with an 8-um pore
Size polycarbonate membrane ﬁlter (Millipore, Temecula, CA, USA)

coated with a uniform layer of 15.15 ug/cm2 Matrigel basement mem-
brane matrix. Before carrying out this experiment, the Matrigel was
reconstituted by adding 4011.1 culture medium with 0.1% fetal bovine
serum (FBS) and incubated at 37°C for 1h. Roughly 1.5 x 105 trypsinized
cells were suspended in 100 Ml culture medium with 0.1% FBS and added
into the upper chamber of the transwell. Culture medium with 10% FBS
(700 11.1) was added to the lower chamber. After incubation for 20 h, the
non-invading cells and the upper Side of the membrane were removed
with a cotton swab. The cells on the lower surface of the membrane were
ﬁxed in methanol for 15min and stained with 0.2% crystal violet for
30 min. The invading cells were counted by dividing the membrane area
into ﬁve ﬁelds and visualizing the ﬁelds at 200x magniﬁcation. The
examinations were in triplicates and the experiments were repeated at
least three times independently.

2.9 Colony formation assay

In the colony formation assay, cells were suspended in 0.3% agar with
complete culture medium and plated at a density of 2 X 104 cells per
60-mm diSh pre-coated with 0.5% agar. Medium (0.5 ml) was added
every 3 days and incubated at 37°C. After 4 weeks, the colonies were
stained with 0.2% crystal violet (Fisher Scientiﬁc, Pittsburgh, PA, USA)
for >1 h. Colonies >100 pm in diameter were scored under a microscope
at 40X magniﬁcation. The examinations were in triplicate plates and a
total of 16 ﬁelds were counted for each plate. The experiments were re-
peated at least three times.

2.10 Statistical analysis

All data are presented as mean:l: standard error. The means of groups
were compared with the paired t-test using GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad
Software, Inc. CA, USA). The receiver—operator characteristic (ROC)
curve was analyzed using SPSS for Windows version 17.0. For all ana-
lyses, P<0.05 was considered statistically Signiﬁcant. *P<0.05;
**P<0.01; ***P< 0.001.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Deﬁning cutoff scores for oncogenes and TSGS

The TAG database contained 366 domains (Supplementary
Table S1). Among these, 49 were present in both the oncogene
and TSG groups, thus having a weight for each group. The re-
maining 317 domains were uniquely in either the oncogene or the
TSG group. Each TAG gene in the training set had an oncogene
and a TSG score; these were calculated as the sum of the onco-
gene weights and TSG weights of the domains in that gene. After
multiplying by 100, the oncogene and TSG scores of genes in the
TAG database ranged from 0.1 to 18.08 (average, 3.71) and from
0.05 to 3.21 (average, 0.86), respectively.

The accuracy of the prediction model was assessed by plotting
the ROC curve and measuring the area under the curve
(AUROC). The AUROC for ‘oncogene’ was 0.85 and for ‘TSG’
was 0.80, indicating that both were excellent predictive models
(Supplementary Fig. S1). To deﬁne the cutoff value for further
analysis, we used the cutoff points from ROC analysis to minimize
the false-positive rate (i.e. maximize speciﬁcity; 100%). The score
for the ‘oncogene’ group signature was 9.09 and for ‘TSG’ it was
2.31. We found that 34 oncogenes and 12 TSGs in the original
training set passed these cutoff values, representing 17 and 7%
sensitivity in prediction using training set data. These results in-
dicate that the deﬁned cutoff values are stringent and should be
able to predict genes with unique domain signatures.

3.2 Identification of new TAGS by computational
prediction

A total of 90 157 FLC sequences were downloaded and analyzed
by the procedure illustrated in Figure 1. We found 33 959 tran-
scripts containing TAG domains with domain numbers ranging
from 1 to 11 (Supplementary Table S2). This included 8958 unique
gene symbols and 498 transcripts currently without symbols. The
results of TAG domain analysis of FLC were ﬁltered by the TAG
training set to identify novel TAGS. Using the cutoff values for the
‘unique domain signature’ determined by the training set, 354 and
269 transcripts representing 119 and 125 unique gene symbols
were predicted to be TAGS in the oncogene and TSG groups,
respectively (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). After removing
the current TAGS from the predicted gene list, we ﬁnally obtained
183 new TAGS that included 78 oncogenes and 105 TSGs.

To reveal the molecular properties of these TAGS, we applied
pathway and gene ontology analysis using the MetaCore soft-
ware package. Among the 78 new TAG oncogenes, most were
functionally involved in protein kinase activity (71 objects,
P—value 1.047E-105, Supplementary Fig. S2A) and ~60% of
these proteins were speciﬁcally implicated in protein tyrosine
kinase (PTK) activity (P-value 2.444E-82). Thus, these predicted
oncogenes are involved in many tumorigenic pathways incl-
uding calcium signaling and mitogenic signaling (Fig. 2A).
Furthermore, 19 out of 26 signiﬁcantly associated diseases
(P-value <l .0E-10) were either tumors/carcinomas or neoplasms,

indicating that dysfunction of these genes indeed was associated
with cancer formation (71 objects, P—value 1.047E-105,
Supplementary Fig. S2B) and clustered on ovarian, breast and
lung cancers (Disease networks, Fig. 2B). On the other hand, the
properties of predicted TSGs were diverse, except that many ex-
hibited binding ability (84 objects, P—value 9.323E-07,
Supplementary Fig. S2C) and were involved in responses to sti-
muli (73 objects, P—value 3.257E-10). The most signiﬁcant pro-
cess according to the GeneGo Map categories for TSG was
vascular development-angiogenesis (Fig. 2C), and dysfunction
of these predicted new TSGs is known to contribute to many
diseases like arteriosclerosis (21 objects, P—value 3.532E-09,
Supplementary Fig. S2D), and may lead to the development of
cancers from various tissues including prostate, lung and colon
(Fig. 2D). In summary, these data strongly support roles of the
predicted TAGS in tumorigenesis.

As proof-of—principle, the next step was to seek further experi-
mental validation of the predicted TAGS. The likely functions
and expression patterns of predicted TAGS were evaluated using
information retrieved from the OMIM, GeneCard and PubMed
databases. Because liver cancer is one of the most common
malignancies in Taiwan and we have been working on identifying
new biomarkers for HCC (Chen et al., 2012), we selected one
predicted oncogene, FRK, which functions as a non-receptor
tyrosine kinase and shows an aberrant digital expression pattern
in liver cancer cells (GeneCard; http://www.genecards.org/), for
further investigation.

3.3 Increased expression of endogenous FRK in
liver cancer cells

To determine whether FRK dysfunction is involved in liver
cancer progression, we ﬁrst assessed FRK expression using com-
mercially available cDNA panels prepared from both normal
and tumor cells of liver, lung and colon. The results from
RT-PCR showed that FRK was expressed in liver tumor and
normal lung tissues (Fig. 3A). Next, we assessed FRK expression
in four HCC cell lines. Using RT-PCR and western blot ana-
lyses, we found that both FRK mRNA and protein (Fig. 3B)
were highly expressed in these lines. Further assessment of FRK
expression in liver cancer cells was carried out in 68 paired HCC
samples. Western blotting showed an average 16-fold increase in
FRK expression (ranging from 1.03- to 4.14-fold) in 52% (35/68)
of the tumor samples (P<0.001, Fig. 3C and Supplementary
Table S5). Taken together, endogenous FRK expression
showed up-regulation in HCC cells and this implied a functional
role of FRK in hepatocarcinogenesis.

3.4 Higher levels of FRK expression in HCC patients
without viral infection

The correlations between FRK-expression levels and various
clinical features were analyzed. The levels were similar in males
and females (P:0.l95; Supplementary Fig. S3A) and were not
associated with cirrhosis status (P:0.34l; Supplementary Fig.
S3B). Furthermore, FRK expression was independent of tumor
size (P = 0.469; Supplementary Fig. S3C), tumor type (P = 0.218;
Supplementary Fig. S3D) and stage of clinical pathology
(P:0.l; Supplementary Fig. S3E). Nevertheless, a signiﬁcant
association between FRK expression and status of viral infection
was found. Compared with patients without HBV or HCV in-
fection, patients with HBV infection tended to express lower
amounts of FRK (P<0.05; Supplementary Fig. S3F).
Although the difference did not reach statistical signiﬁcance, a
similar trend was observed for FRK expression in patients with
HCV infection (P: 0.063; Supplementary Fig. S3F).
Collectively, these data suggested that endogenous FRK expres-
sion plays a predominant role in non-virus-infected HCC.

3.5 FRK expression promotes Hep3B but not HepG2
cell growth and transformation

To investigate the role of FRK in the carcinogenesis of HCC,
several tumorigenic assays were carried out in
FRK-overexpressing and -knockdown liver cancer cells. In tran-
sient overexpression experiments, the transfection efﬁciency of
the recombinant FRK construct was 50—60% in Hep3B and
20—30% in HepG2 cells (Supplementary Fig. S4), and the expres-
sion of recombinant FRK was conﬁrmed by western blotting in
both cell lines (Fig. 4A). In addition, endogenous expression of
FRK was knocked down by infection with lentivirus containing
FRK-speciﬁc shRNA. Western blot analysis showed that the
level of FRK expression dropped to 67% in Hep3B and 80%
in HepG2 cells (Fig. 4B).

We used a cell proliferation assay to study the effect of FRK
on growth in FRK-overexpressing and -knockdown cells. Results
from the MTS assay revealed that FRK overexpression
promoted the proliferation of Hep3B cells (Fig. 4C; P<0.05).

Furthermore, although the difference in growth rate did not reach
the cutoff for signiﬁcance, FRK knockdown tended to reduce
proliferation in Hep3B compared with Sh_luc control cells (Fig.
4C). Interestingly, FRK overexpression had no effect on prolifer-
ation but showed a noteworthy growth reduction (P<0.05) in
FRK-knockdown HepG2 cells (Fig. 4D). Furthermore, trans-
formation was tested in FRK-overexpressing Hep3B and
HepG2 cells with the soft agar assay, which showed that enforced
FRK expression promoted colony formation (P< 0.01) and
increased the colony size (P< 0.0001) in Hep3B_FRK cells com-
pared with the control cells (Fig. 4E). In contrast, no differences
were found between FRK-overexpressing and vector-control
HepG2 cells in either the number or size of colonies formed
(Fig. 4F). Results from the transformation assay were in agree-
ment with those of the proliferation assay and further conﬁrmed
that overexpression of FRK promoted cell growth in Hep3B but
not HepG2 cells. All together, the ﬁndings indicated that FRK
has oncogenic potential to regulate cell proliferation and trans-
formation but the effect may vary in different cellular back-
grounds or environments.

3.6 FRK expression enhances invasive ability in Hep3B
and HepG2 cells

To determine whether FRK is involved in cell invasion,
Matrigel-coated transwells were used to evaluate the invasiveness
of FRK-overexpressing and FRK-knockdown cells. The results
demonstrated that overexpressing FRK in Hep3B cells increased

the number of invading cells (P<0.0001, Fig. 5A). In contrast,
FRK knockdown strongly repressed the invasiveness of Hep3B
cells (P<0.0001, Fig. 5B). Furthermore, HepG2_FRK showed
increased and HepG2_sh_FRK cells showed reduced numbers of
invasive cells compared with controls (P<0.0001 for both;
Fig. 5C and D). Taken together, these data showed that altered
expression of FRK correlated well with invasiveness in both
HCC cell lines, thus strongly supporting the involvement of
FRK in the regulation of cell invasion.

4 DISCUSSION

Protein kinase is an enzyme that modiﬁes other proteins by phos-
phorylation of tyrosine or serine/threonine amino-acid residues.
This usually results in a functional change of the target protein.
PTKS, which can be classiﬁed into receptor and non-receptor
types, are a large and diverse multigene family involved in the
regulation of a range of cellular processes, including prolifer-
ation, migration, differentiation, death and cell-to-cell communi-
cation in multicellular organisms (Hunter, 2009). In humans,
perturbation of PTK signaling by mutations and other genetic
alterations results in deregulated kinase activity and leads to the
development of many diseases (Robertson et al., 2000) and ma-
lignant transformation (Blume-Jensen and Hunter, 2001).
Although the products of oncogenes can be classiﬁed into six
broad groups (transcription factors, chromatin remodelers,
growth factors, growth factor receptors, signal transducers and
apoptosis regulators; Croce, 2008), >70% of the known onco-
genes and proto-oncogenes involved in cancers code for PTKS
(Yim et al., 2009b). Thus it was not surprising that the compu-
tational search using known oncogenes as the training set
showed that >50% of the predicted TAG oncogenes belonged
to this speciﬁc family. And the consequences of dysfunction of
these PTKS no doubt would be tumor formation. On the other
hand, a tumor suppressor is a protein that either has a dampen-
ing or repressive effect on the regulation of the cell cycle or
promotes apoptosis, and sometimes both, so it protects a cell
from entering the path to carcinogenesis (Sherr, 2004). The func-
tions of tumor-suppressor proteins fall into many categories
including proteins that are responsible for DNA damage
(Markowitz, 2000) and involved in cell adhesion (Hirohashi
and Kanai, 2003). In agreement with these principles, we found
that the properties of the predicted TSGs were mainly binding
ability and involvement in the processes of responses to stimuli.
As the most signiﬁcant process involving these predicted TSGs
was vascular development-angiogenesis, and angiogenesis is
considered to be an important step toward metastasis, these
data suggested that the newly predicted TSGs may participate
in the control of tumor metastasis.

FRK (also known as RAK) is a 54-kDa PTK that belongs to
the Src non-receptor tyrosine kinase family (Lee et al., 1994) and
shares about 50% amino-acid identity with Fyn, Src and Lyn
(Cance et al., 1994; Lee et al., 1994; Meyer et al., 2003). Because
FRK has different structural features that comprise a putative
bipartite nuclear localization signal in the SH2 domain (Cance
et al., 1994; Chandrasekharan et al., 2002) and is uniquely
localized in the nucleus (Cance et al., 1994; Pendergast, 1996;
Yim et al., 2009a), FRK is known to have a different set of
substrates from other Src family members. FRK is expressed

predominantly in epithelial tissues such as kidney, liver and lung
(Cance et al., 1994). Previous studies showed that overexpression
of FRK suppresses growth through an association with pr
during the G1 and S phases (Craven et al., 1995; Meyer et al.,
2003). Another study demonstrated that ectopic expression of
FRK in breast cancer cell lines suppresses cell growth, invasion
and colony formation in vitro and tumor growth in viva (Yim
et al., 2009b). These ﬁndings demonstrated that FRK expression
stabilizes PTEN protein and activates FRK-pr—induced
growth inhibition (Craven et al., 1995; Yim et al., 2009a).
Nevertheless, one study has reported that the t(6;l2)(q2l;pl3)
translocation fuses ETV6 and FRK together and the fusion pro-
tein contributed directly to leukemogenesis in a patient with
acute myelogenous leukemia (Hosoya et al., 2005). In addition,
insertionally mutagenized and overexpressed frk is frequently
found in myeloblastosis-associated virus (MAV)-2-induced lung
sarcomas in chickens (Pajer et al., 2009). Furthermore, miR-330,
a known regulator of FRK expression, is down-regulated in
HCC and has been proposed to participate in hepatocarcinogen-
esis (Varnholt et al., 2008). These studies along with our ﬁnding
that FRK was overexpressed in 52% of HCC samples, strongly
suggested the oncogenic potential of FRK. All together, these
ﬁndings indicated that FRK is involved in tumor progression but
the effect may be tissue— or cell-type speciﬁc.

Our clinical investigation demonstrated that FRK is involved
in liver cancer carcinogenesis. Follow-up tumorigenic assays
showed that FRK promoted growth and transformation in
Hep3B but not in HepG2 cells. Both Hep3B and HepG2 are
commonly used HCC cell lines, however, previous studies
demonstrated that they have different properties. For example,
Hep3B cells have lost two TSGs, the Rb and p53 genes, but
HepG2 retains intact expression of these genes; thus Hep3B is
more malignant than HepG2 (Puisieux et al., 1993). As earlier
studies have demonstrated that the FRK suppression of cell
proliferation is associated with the presence of Rb (Craven
et al., 1995; Meyer et al., 2003), this explains the discrepancy
of cell proliferation/transformation assays between Hep3B and
HepG2 with FRK overexpression. Because studies showed that
FRK inhibits PTEN destabilization and inactivates pr-induced
growth inhibition, these data suggest that FRK is a negative
regulator of cell proliferation, at least in breast and liver
cancer cells.

Interestingly, we found that the expression levels of FRK were
signiﬁcantly correlated with invasiveness in both Hep3B and
HepG2 cells despite their different genetic backgrounds.
Previous studies showed that FRK activates the Ras-related
protein 1 (RAPl) pathway and induces neurite outgrowth in
PC12 cells, probably through a mechanism involving physical
association with the Src homology 2 domain-containing adaptor
protein B (SHB), increased SHB phosphorylation and FAK
expression and increased binding of the CRKII-C3G complex
(Anneren et al., 2000, 2003). RAPl was shown to promote vas-
cular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (V EGFR2) activation
and angiogenesis via integrin a(v),83 in endothelial cells
(Lakshmikanthan et al., 2011), and activation of RAPl increases
prostate cancer cell migration and metastasis (Bailey et al., 2009).
We propose that FRK—SHB—RAPl pathway may be involved in
the increased invasiveness of HCC cells. Alternatively, a recent
study reported that FRK reduces migration and invasion in

human glioma cells by regulating JNK/c—Jun signaling (Zhou
et al., 2012). As the standard tumorigenic assays performed in
this study were just for proof-of—principle, these data were not
sufﬁcient to demonstrate the mechanism underlying the
FRK-mediated oncogenic effect. Further experiments as well
as animal models will be required to fully illustrate the function
of FRK in cancers. Yet, these results indicate that FRK is a
versatile signal transduction molecule that induces diverse biolo-
gical responses in different cell types under various conditions
and tissue-speciﬁc microenvironments.

In conclusion, although there are a few databases with collec-
tions showing information on cancer-related genes, most of them
are restricted to certain types of cancers or genes (e. g. the breast
cancer database, http://www.itb.cnr.it/breastcancer/index.html
or the IARC TP53 database, http://www-p53.iarc.fr/) and none
provide predictive function in the way the TAG database does.
This feature of TAG distinguishes it from other current online/
commercially available bioinformatics tools. As the oncogenic
potential of FRK was suggested by computational analysis, con-
ﬁrmation of the FRK effect on liver cancer provided strong sup-
port for the idea that predicted TAGS are highly likely to be
involved in tumorigenesis. Finally, our analysis revealed that
183 candidates had the potential to trigger tumor development
at various stages and/or in various tissues, and we believe the
outcome of this study will beneﬁt cancer research. Although this
list of genes contributes signiﬁcantly to our current knowledge of
TAGS, the roles and speciﬁcity of these predicted TAGS in
tumorigenesis require further experimental validation.

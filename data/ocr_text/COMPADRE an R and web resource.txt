ABSTRACT

Summary: The analysis of biological networks has become essential
to study functional genomic data. Compadre is a tool to estimate
pathway/gene sets activity indexes using sub-matrix decompositions
for biological networks analyses. The Compadre pipeline also includes
one of the direct uses of activity indexes to detect altered gene sets.
For this, the gene expression sub-matrix of a gene set is decomposed
into components, which are used to test differences between groups
of samples. This procedure is performed with and without differentially
expressed genes to decrease false calls. During this process,
Compadre also performs an over-representation test. Compadre
already implements four decomposition methods [principal compo-
nent analysis (PCA), Isomaps, independent component analysis
(ICA) and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)], six statistical
tests (t- and f—test, SAM, Kruskal—Wallis, Welch and Brown—
Forsythe), several gene sets (KEGG, BioCarta, Reactome, GO and
MsigDB) and can be easily expanded. Our simulation results shown
in Supplementary Information suggest that Compadre detects more
pathways than over-representation tools like David, Babelomics and
Webgestalt and less false positives than PLAGE. The output is com-
posed of results from decomposition and over-representation ana-
lyses providing a more complete biological picture. Examples
provided in Supplementary Information show the utility, versatility
and simplicity of Compadre for analyses of biological networks.

1. INTRODUCTION

The analysis of biological networks has become essential to study
functional genomic data. For this, the pathway activity index,
initially proposed to identify altered pathways (Tomfohr et al.,
2005), is a method that has been successfully applied recently.
For example, it has also been used to detect pathways related to
circadian rhythm (Ovacik et al., 2010), to predict cancer

classiﬁcation (Su et al., 2009) and survival (Chen et al., 2010)
and to identify chemical features of drug toxicity (Antczak
et al., 2010). Nevertheless, there is no current software that facili-
tates pathway activity estimations. One of the wide uses of the
activity indexes is the detection of altered gene sets
(Emmert-Streib and Glazko, 2011). For this, other methods that
depend on a list or rank of interesting or differential expressed
genes (DEG) such as GSEA, David, Babelomics and Webgestalt
(Medina et al., 2010; Sherman et al., 2007; Subramanian et al.,
2005; Zhang et al., 2005) attempt to identify those gene sets that
are statistically over-represented or under-represented in such list.
Because of the list dependency, these tools may limit the number
of associations found and could miss other subtle relations
(Allison et al., 2006; Emmert-Streib and Glazko, 2011;
Subramanian et al., 2005). Therefore, approaches that consider
all genes in a pathway should be theoretically more powerful
(Jiang and Gentleman, 2007), and such analysis can be comple-
mentary because small, but coordinated, changes of several genes
in a pathway would be also biologically interesting. PLAGE
(Tomfohr et al., 2005) is one of the approaches that consider all
genes in a gene set using dimensionality reduction applying sin-
gular value decomposition (SVD) to detect differential expressed
pathways (J iang and Gentleman, 2007). However, there is no tool
currently available to perform this type of analyses.

Since the transformation performed by SVD can be seen as
decomposition by principal component analysis (PCA), we
hypothesized that other linear and non-linear decompositions
that have also been used to analyse gene expression may also
detect coordinated differential expressed gene sets, for example,
independent component analysis (ICA) (Frigyesi et al., 2006),
non-linear Isomaps (Dawson et al., 2005) and non-negative
matrix factorization (NMF) (Schachtner et al., 2008).
Nevertheless, such decompositions may be biased by DEG.
For example, PCA designates components by the magnitude of
the explained variance; consequently, top components may re-
ﬂect the variance of few DEG instead of coordinated alterations
of several genes. Results shown in Supplementary Material dem-
onstrate that some gene sets that would be called signiﬁcant by
PLAGE and that contain non-significant numbers of DEG are
no longer significant after its removal, suggesting that those sig-
nificant gene set calls were false positives. Moreover, we observed
that several gene sets can be detected as altered even when DEG
have been removed from the analysis. Therefore, we developed

expressed genes REmoved), an R package for bioinformatics-
minded users, that implements gene set decomposition to gener-
ate activity indexes. In addition, we implemented a web applica-
tion for biologists to detect differential expressed gene sets.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

The main features of our implementation are as follows: (i) Four
decomposition methods (PCA, ICA, Isomap and NMF); (ii)
Five statistical tests (f-test, SAM, Kruskal—Wallis, Welch and
Brown—Forsythe) to estimate DEG (Chen et al., 2005) and sig-
nificant gene sets; (iii) Several ready to use gene sets (KEGG,
Biocarta, GO, Reactome and those from MSigDB); (iv) Users
may provide its own decomposition R function for (i), P—values
or R function for (ii), or gene sets for (iii); and (v) Results are
delivered before and after removing DEG, including the activity
indexes data set, easy to interpret gene set statistics and summar-
izing heatmap plots. Two uses of Compadre were developed, a
web interface and an R package. The web uses the R package,
and the results are stored in a file server at least one month,
whose link is sent via e-mail when the process has finished.
The Compadre algorithm involves three procedures (Fig. l).
The first procedure is ran for each gene set decomposing the
corresponding gene expression sub-matrix into components rep-
resenting activity indexes, generating an activity-based data set,
which is used to test the difference between groups of samples. In
the second procedure, DEG are detected and removed from the
input data set and processed as in the first procedure. In the third
procedure, the detected DEG are used to perform an over-
representation test. By performing these three procedures,
Compadre is allowed to recognize whether a gene set may be
altered because it contains: (i) a significant number of DEG
(third procedure, Evidence: Strong), (ii) several subtle altered

3 CONCLUSION

We provide an R package and web tool to estimate gene sets
activity indexes and to detect altered gene sets. The simplicity of
use allows easy incorporation to bioinformatics pipelines. Real
data examples shown in supplementary examples for breast
cancer, circadian rhythm and class prediction illustrate the
versatility and usability of Compadre. Supplementary simulation
results suggest that Compadre detects more pathways than
over-representation tools like David, Babelomics and
Webgestalt and less false positives than PLAGE. Results also
imply that our novel analysis before and after DEG removal is
critical to decrease gene sets false positives. In terms of true and
false positives, PCA was the best; thus, it is recommended for a
first approach. If results are scarce, ICA, NMF or Isomaps may
be useful. We conclude that Compadre is a valuable tool to
estimate activity indexes and to detect differentially expressed
pathways from functional genomics data.

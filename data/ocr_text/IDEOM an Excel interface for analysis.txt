ABSTRACT

Summary: The application of emerging metabolomics technologies
to the comprehensive investigation of cellular biochemistry has been
limited by bottlenecks in data processing, particularly noise filtering
and metabolite identification. IDEOM provides a user-friendly data
processing application that automates filtering and identification of
metabolite peaks, paying particular attention to common sources of
noise and false identifications generated by liquid chromatography—
mass spectrometry (LC—MS) platforms. Building on advanced
processing tools such as szatch and XCMS, it allows users to run
a comprehensive pipeline for data analysis and visualization from a
graphical user interface within Microsoft Excel, a familiar program for
most biological scientists.

Availability and implementation: IDEOM is provided free of charge
at http://mzmatch.sourceforge.net/ideom.html, as a macro-enabled
spreadsheet (.xlsb). Implementation requires Microsoft Excel (2007
or later). R is also required for full functionality.

1 INTRODUCTION

Metabolomics aims to measure all small molecules (metabolites)
in a biological system. However, challenges associated with data
analysis, in particular the accurate identiﬁcation of metabolites
(Moco et al., 2007; Neumann and BOCker, 2010) have restricted
progress.

Recent advances in high resolution mass spectrometry (MS)
provide accurate mass detection that signiﬁcantly improves
metabolite identiﬁcation from liquid chromatography—MS (LC—MS)
(Breitling et al., 2006; Moco et al., 2007) although limitations still
abound (Kind and Fiehn, 2010; Neumann and BOCker, 2010), and
noise or artifact peaks are often incorrectly identiﬁed as metabolites
(Scheltema et al., 2009).

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Applications are freely available for detection, quantiﬁcation and
alignment of signals in LC—MS data (Blekherman et al., 2011),
and numerous multivariate statistical methods have been proposed
to extract signiﬁcant features from these high—dimensional datasets
(Madsen et al., 2010). However, many of the most powerful tools
are implemented in statistical software, and while the graphical user
interface (GUI) in MZmine (Pluskal et al., 2010) simpliﬁes data
pre—processing, recent advances in noise ﬁltering and identiﬁcation
algorithms (Brown et al., 2011; Scheltema et al., 2011) are difﬁcult
to use without special training.

IDEOM is a Microsoft Excel template with a collection of VBA
macros that enable automated data processing of high resolution LC—
MS data from untargeted metabolomics studies, with a particular
focus on removal of noise [which accounts for ~80% of peaks
in typical LC—MS metabolomics datasets (Jankevics et al., 2012)],
metabolite identiﬁcation and data visualization. Its GUI allows users
to exploit the power of data—processing methods such as szatch
(Scheltema et al., 2011) and XCMS (Smith et al., 2006) from
within Excel, and enables rapid and simple conversion of raw
or pre—processed LC—MS data into a ﬁltered, interpretable list of
putative metabolites, with associated conﬁdence levels and sample
intensities.

2 METHODS

Opening the IDEOM template in Excel provides a spreadsheet on which to
specify the parameters for data processing (default values are provided). All
IDEOM macros for data processing are then activated by buttons or in—cell
hyperlinks, and pop—up dialog boxes are used to specify important parameters
for individual processing steps.

Raw LC—MS data ﬁles (.szML) are processed by IDEOM using
the freely available XCMS (Smith et al., 2006) and mzmatch.R tools
(http://mzmatch.sourceforge.net/index.php) (Scheltema et al., 2011), by
automatic generation and execution of scripts in the R environment
(www.r—project.org) (R, 2008) using readily adjustable parameters. Raw
peaks are extracted by XCMS, and szatch applies peak matching, noise
ﬁltering, gap—ﬁlling and annotation of related peaks. Pre—processed peak lists
from szatch or MZmine can be directly imported into IDEOM as text
or csv ﬁles. During data import, any number of samples can be assigned
to (up to 30) study groups (e.g. blanks, controls and QCs) to improve
data ﬁltering, analysis and visualization. Sample consistency, according

to average peak height and internal standards (optional), is automatically
checked and normalization can be applied.

Noise ﬁltering within IDEOM removes common sources of noise in high
resolution LC—MS data: chromatographic peak shoulders, irreproducible
peaks, background or contaminant signals, and fourier transform (FT)
and electrospray ionisation (ESI) artifacts including isotopes, adducts and
fragments (based on Brown et al., 2011 and Scheltema et al., 2011), as
described in the documentation (Supplementary Material).

Metabolite identiﬁcation is achieved by matching the accurate mass and
retention time of observed peaks to metabolites in the included database,
which incorporates all likely metabolites from a wide range of biological
databases, and can be updated by users for speciﬁc applications. Retention
times for authentic standards, and a retention time prediction model,
are included for ZIC—HILIC chromatography data (Creek et al., 2011);
however, as retention times are instrument speciﬁc, users are encouraged
to upload standard retention times from their own platform with the macro
provided. Subsequent to initial metabolite identiﬁcation, a data—dependent
polynomial mass recalibration step can be applied to correct for mass—
dependent calibration errors. The ﬁnal lists of identiﬁed, and rejected, peaks
are annotated with conﬁdence scores regarding the identiﬁcation of each
metabolite, based on retention times, organism—speciﬁc (or user—deﬁned)
databases and annotation as possible ‘related peaks’ (Scheltema et al., 2009).
Univariate statistics (mean, relative intensity, SD, t—test and Fisher ratio) are
calculated in Excel. Multivariate statistics are obtained by calls to the R
environment.

3 RESULTS

The automated pre—processing steps in IDEOM drastically reduce
the need for manual curation of LC—MS data by applying ﬁlters
to remove hundreds of false—identiﬁcations (Creek et al., 2011).
The example tutorial dataset (Supplementary Material) demonstrates
putative identiﬁcation of 1314 metabolites and rejection of 1942
false—identiﬁcations from serum samples. The putatively identiﬁed
metabolites are displayed in an interactive table that includes
metabolite information, sample intensities, comparative statistics,
LC—MS data, and links to websites and graphs (Fig. 1). Putative
identiﬁcations can be rapidly scrutinized by double—click access
to LC—MS metadata, or adjusted by selecting alternative isomers
from dropdown lists. Data visualization is enhanced by Excel’s
conditional formatting, ﬁltering and sorting, allowing users to view

Additional IDEOM tools include: merging dual—polarity data,
chemical formula determination for unidentiﬁed masses, stable
isotope tracking and targeted analysis. Full documentation, tutorials,
source code and the IDEOM template are freely available at

IDEOM provides a user—friendly interface for analysis of complex
metabolomics datasets without the need for specialist bioinformatics
skills, allowing for the rapid production of meaningful, interactive
results for biological interpretation of untargeted metabolomics data
sets.

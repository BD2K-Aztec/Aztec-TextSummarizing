ABSTRACT

Summary: SimiCon is a web server designed for an automated
identification of equivalent protein—ligand atomic contacts in different
conformational models of a complex. The contacts are computed
with internal coordinate mechanics (ICM) software with respect to
molecular symmetry and the results are shown in the browser as
text, tables and interactive 3D graphics. The web server can be
executed remotely without a browser to allow users to automate
multiple calculations.

1 INTRODUCTION

Docking and Virtual ligand screening with crystal structures or
homology models play important roles in the understanding of
receptor—ligand interactions, with numerous applications in drug
discovery. A critical requirement for any useful application of
docking algorithms is their ability to ﬁnd accurate poses of the ligand
and its contacts with the receptor atoms.

The validation of the geometry of a complex or ‘pose-prediction’
is based on the ability to reproduce the binding mode of a ligand
observed in the cognate reference X-ray or NMR structure. The
precision of the models is usually checked with the root mean
squared deviation (RMSD), a popular measure that accounts for the
distances of the ligand atoms of the model from the ligand atoms in
the reference structure. To provide an example, in small molecule
docking context, a heavy-atom RMSD 52A with respect to the
reference pose is widely accepted as good (Cole et al., 2005).

RMSD, however, has shortcomings that can lead to misclass-
iﬁcation of both correct and incorrect poses (Cole et al., 2005;
Kroemer et al., 2004). For instance, although a low RMSD value
is indicative of a strong similarity, it does not show how well the
critical interactions are conserved. In this regard, literature contains
numerous examples where hydrogen bond interaction patterns differ
between reference and model, despite having low RMSD values
(Kroemer et al., 2004). Conversely, a high RMSD might come
from differences in a ﬂexible region of the ligand (not important
for the overall binding mode), or from a nearly correct pose of a

symmetric molecule (Abagyan and Marsden 2003; Kroemer et al.,
2004). Another major ﬂaw of the RMSD is that it requires receptor
superposition, which is rather ambiguous when models represent
distinct experimental or modeled conformations of the receptor.

As an alternative to the RMSD, interaction-based measures reﬂect
more adequately important aspects of the molecular recognition by
measuring conserved key protein—ligand contacts. In small molecule
context, attempts of standardization of contact-based measures
have been made before (Abagyan and Totrov 1997; Cole et al.,
2005; Deng et al., 2004; Hawkins et al., 2008; Kroemer et al.,
2004; Marcou and Rognan, 2007); however, some technical caveats
hampered their wide acceptance. For instance, one problematic
issue is the assignation of the atomic equivalence between atoms
of the two complexes. Thus, while Cox/QB contact-based metrics are
widely employed for evaluation of protein—protein docking model
quality in CAPRI assessment (J anin et al., 2003), establishing atom
equivalence for chemical compounds, on which the equivalence
does not follow the amino acid sequence, is non-trivial. For small
molecules, equivalence can be established using a speciﬁc set of
rules for unique enumeration of atoms in the chemical structure, such
as in IUPAC, unique SMILES and chirality rules of Cahn—Ingold—
Prelog (Sidney et al., 1966). Such rules are implemented in some
chemical packages, but often they are not in 3D molecular modeling
software. Most importantly, the presence of any symmetry elements
in a compound also adds complexity to the equivalence problem, as
the same exact contact can be made by any of the symmetry-related
atoms.

To our knowledge, there is no universal solution to overcome
the contact-based measure caveats. Some researchers try looking
for atomic equivalence manually; others end up transforming the
formats to their favorite package-speciﬁc topologies, aiming at
generating consensus naming. According to our experience, even
the ‘package-speciﬁc-naming’ solution may lead to different naming
schemes if the atom names were dissimilar before the conversion,
or if the ligands come from SMILES representations. To avoid these
difﬁculties in assigning equivalent interactions, docking assessments
(Michino et al., 2009) required modelers to submit data in a rigid
protein data bank (PDB) template format with deﬁned names and
sequential positions of atoms. Unfortunately, analysis of models
delivered in even such rigid formats has not been fully automated
and requires manual processing to take into account symmetry both
in the receptor side chains and in many cases in the small molecule
ligands.

Here, we present a solution to this issue based on a web server
where the atomic equivalence and symmetry of the receptor and the

ligand are taken into account. The method can be applied not only for
protein—ligand docking pose ranking, but also for the assessment of
any protein—chemical complex such as, but not limited to, co-factor
or drug positioning in multi-chain proteins and community-wide
structure assessments of modeled complexes.

2 METHODS AND IMPLEMENTATION

SimiCon web interface was written in Perl using the common
gateway interface (CGI) module. The core calculation of the
intersection of interatomic heavy-atom contacts is performed with
internal coordinate mechanics (ICM) 3.7 molecular modeling and
docking software (Abagyan and Totrov, 1994), which has unique
enumeration rules accurately implemented and tested in previous
applications. An automated ICM script uses the following steps to
calculate equivalent contacts (EC) in reference and target models:
(i) all receptor—ligand atomic contacts are identiﬁed for the reference
model using selected cutoff distance, typically 4 A; (ii) for the set
of contact atoms in the reference model, equivalent atoms in the
target model are identiﬁed. If any atom of ligand has a symmetric
atom (e.g. in phenyl group), all possible equivalence schemes are
calculated. For symmetric side chains in receptor (i.e. Arg, Phe, Tyr,
Val, Leu, Asp and Glu) equivalent atoms are enumerated only within
a side chain to avoid large combinatorics; (iii) atomic contacts of the
target model, equivalent with contacts in the reference are calculated;
and (iv) lists of EC, as well as all contacts in reference model (RC)
and target contacts (TC) model are calculated. These lists can be used
to calculate some general metrics, such as the coverage = E CﬂQC and
the accuracy = EC/T C (J anin et al., 2003). Results can be obtained
through a web browser, or remotely by the execution of a script
using Perl LWP library (see Help page at web site).

2.1 Input data

The user can upload PDB coordinate ﬁles or retrieve the structure
using PDB code (Berman et al., 2000). The server is optimized for
parsing proteins as receptors and chemicals as ligands (labeled as
HETATMs in PDB). The recommended standard cutoff distance for
the atgmic contacts is 4 A, but the user can choose a range from 2
to 12 .

2.2 Results and visualization

For most PDB complexes the calculation takes 2 s and is presented
in plain HTML text, tables and 3D interactive molecular objects.
The 3D interactive objects can be visualized online by using the
activeICM/active X plugin (Raush et al., 2009) or be downloaded
as a single ﬁle to be browsed with all its attached objects locally
with the ICM browser. Both activeICM and ICM browser are freely
available to the public. The interatomic contacts for the reference, the
target and the intersection can be downloaded as a comma separated
value (.csv) ﬁle, compatible and supported by almost all spreadsheets
and database management systems.

Apart from a standalone calculation, we envision that some
users may wish to use the command line to execute the CGI with
multiple targets. For that purpose, we provide an example Perl script
implemented using the LWP library that will avoid the necessity for
‘screen scraping’ of HTML. Full instructions are provided on the
Help page at web site.

The server also contains four pre-computed examples, showing
different scenarios where SimiCom can be applied: (i) Heme
contacts with chains A and B of human cytocrom P450 2D6
(PDB:2f9q); (ii) best overall in silico model of the Adenosine A2A
receptor submitted to a recent community-wide G protein-coupled
receptor (GPCR) assessment (PDB:3eml); iii) ATP contacts with
chains A and B of Human Pyridoxal Kinase (PDB:2yxu); and
(iv) staurosporine contacts with epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) Kinase domain in complex with AFNN941 protein kinase
in wild-type and mutated forms (PDBs:2itw, 2itu).

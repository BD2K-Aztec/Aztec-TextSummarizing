Abstract

Motivation: Accurate cross-sample peak alignment and reliable intensity normalization is a critical
step for robust quantitative analysis in untargetted metabolomics since tandem mass spectrometry
(MS/MS) is rarely used for compound identification. Therefore shortcomings in the data processing
steps can easily introduce false positives due to misalignments and erroneous normalization ad-
justments in large sample studies.

Results: In this work, we developed a software package MetTailor featuring two novel data preprocess-
ing steps to remedy drawbacks in the existing processing tools. First, we propose a novel dynamic
block summarization (DBS) method for correcting misalignments from peak alignment algorithms,
which alleviates missing data problem due to misalignments. For the purpose of verifying correct re-
alignments, we propose to use the cross-sample consistency in isotopic intensity ratios as a quality
metric. Second, we developed a flexible intensity normalization procedure that adjusts normalizing fac-
tors against the temporal variations in total ion chromatogram (TIC) along the chromatographic reten-
tion time (RT). We first evaluated the DBS algorithm using a curated metabolomics dataset, illustrating
that the algorithm identifies misaligned peaks and correctly realigns them with good sensitivity. We
next demonstrated the DBS algorithm and the RT-based normalization procedure in a large-scale data-
set featuring >100 sera samples in primary Dengue infection study. Although the initial alignment was
successful for the majority of peaks, the DBS algorithm still corrected ~7000 misaligned peaks in this
data and many recovered peaks showed consistent isotopic patterns with the peaks they were re-
aligned to. In addition, the RT-based normalization algorithm efficiently removed visible local variations
in TIC along the RT, without sacrificing the sensitivity of detecting differentially expressed metabolites.

1 Introduction

Mass spectrometry (MS) coupled with gas or liquid chromatography
(GC-MS or LC-MS) is already the technology of choice in the
metabolomics literature (Dettmer et al., 2007; Griffiths and Wang,
2009). In the experiment, hundreds to thousands of compounds
elute through the chromatography column at varying rates, resulting
in separation of compounds across the retention time (RT). The
compounds are then ionized and analysed by the MS, in which the
mass to charge ratio (m/z) and the intensity of ions are determined.
In the untargeted setting, compound identification is typically
achieved by searching the mono isotopic mass of each peak against a
large-scale database of compounds by exact mass values, such as the
HMDB (Wishart et al., 2007, 2009), MassBank (Horai et al., 2010)
and Metlin (Smith et al., 2005), to name a few. Quantitative data
analysis is then performed using the corresponding peak intensity or
integrated peak area in each sample.

Despite conceptual similarity, extraction of peak features with
precise compound identification has proved to be a challenging task
in untargeted metabolomics. In particular, the lack of the identifica-
tion step via global-scale MS/MS fragmentation makes cross-sample
matching of peak feature data, so called alignment, as the most
crucial data extraction step. This is because multiple compounds of
a similar or identical mass with slightly different chemical structure
(isomers) and different elemental composition, can co-elute and they
are simultaneously analysed, creating mixed signals. Without the
MS/MS evidence, the intensity signals for such molecules will be
aligned together, being treated as the same compound. On the other
hand, when thousands of features are processed across a large num-
ber of samples, it is also possible that the same compound can be
misaligned across the samples and subsequently treated as different
compounds in the statistical analysis stage. Hence accurate data
extraction and robust preprocessing steps are prerequisite for suc-
cessful untargeted metabolomics analysis.

The general workﬂow for MS data preprocessing consists of sev-
eral steps. First, peak picking algorithms are applied to identify the
ion chromatograms with robust isotopic patterns and each of them
is reported as a peak feature with three-dimensional coordinates (m/
z value, retention time and peak areas/intensities, often aggregated
over isotopes and adducts into a major peak feature). Next, the peak
alignment step removes the variations in both RT and m/z axes for
the same compounds across the samples, aligning the extracted
peaks to the same m/z and RT grid to a single identifier. The aligned
peak intensity data are then further processed by a normalization
procedure prior to statistical analysis, to remove the systematic bias
introduced during sample preparation and the variation in the ion-
ization efficiency and instrumental analysis. Common choices for
normalizing metabolomics MS data include total intensity sum (TIS)
(Manna et al., 2013), internal standard calibration (ISC) (Cui et al.,
2013), or a statistical model that combines standards and T15
(Sysi-Aho et al., 2007).

Although the existing open source software packages such as
MZmine (Pluskal et al., 2010) and XCMS (Smith et al., 2006) per-
form peak picking and alignment, there is room for further improve-
ment (Smith et al., 2013). In our observations, for example, even the
most sophisticated multi-sample alignment algorithms have been
prone to misalignment error at the individual compound level, espe-
cially for less abundant compounds or multiply charged compounds.
Misalignment tends to happen when (i) signal detection algorithms
fail to separate co-eluting compounds, (ii) peak picking algorithms
identify incorrect major isotopic peaks or (iii) minor temporal vari-
ation outlasts the alignment step by a few seconds of RT or a few

decimals in the m/z beyond the tolerance level specified in those
algorithms.

Besides the misalignment issue, the existing methods for data
normalization also have limitations. For example, the internal stand-
ard measurements can be inaccurate in some samples, or mixed with
co-eluting compounds. The TIS method may ﬂuctuate due to poor
chromatographic separation or the influence of a few dominantly
abundant compounds, and it can also be inapplicable when the de-
tected compounds are genuinely heterogeneous between comparison
groups. Most importantly, the procedures mentioned above are cor-
rections by a single constant, which adjusts all intensity values for
global bias only and does not account for temporal or local vari-
ations along the RT axis across different samples (Rudnick et al.,
2014)

To address these two key limitations in the current data process-
ing pipeline, we developed a software package MetTailor, which im-
plements two post-extraction processing steps including a method
for block-wise quantitative summary and a novel RT-based local
normalization procedure.

2 Approach

2.1 Dynamic block summary algorithm

To address misalignment events in large sample datasets, we de-
veloped an algorithm called dynamic block summary (DBS) that
takes de-isotoped and pre-aligned peak intensity data reported from
data extraction software packages and dynamically reduces local
misalignment errors in the chromatographic space (m/z and RT
grids). The DBS algorithm creates rectangular blocks with m/z and
RT grid coordinates that are small enough to capture a single com-
pound in the majority or all of the samples, and then acquires quan-
titative summary for each block by the peak apex or the largest
integrated peak area for downstream analysis in each sample. The
resulting quantitative data corrects a certain degree of alignment
errors when merging a large number of samples, yielding fewer miss-
ing data in the data table reported by blocks.

Figure 1 illustrates how the DBS algorithm works. The data
shown are the raw peak intensity data from Agilent 6520 Q-TOF in-
strument, prior to any signal extraction in the Dengue dataset (see
Section 4). In each example, XCMS reported at least two consecu-
tive rows across the samples for the same compound. The point
where the horizontal line and the first vertical line crosses indicates
the alignment coordinate for a particular row in the XCMS table
(the two other vertical lines are expected m/z coordinates for their
isotopes). In all panels, alignment was successful in the first three
samples at the fixed m/z—RT coordinate (i.e. thus reported in the
same row in the original table), while it failed in the fourth sample
despite having a very similar m/z—RT coordinate (horizontal or verti-
cal shift in the alignment point). Since the DBS algorithm places rect-
angular blocks, it is able to bring the fourth sample back into the
correct alignment and to summarize the maximal intensity data in-
side the box across all the samples. As a result, this process merges
the two rows representing the same compound in different samples
into a single row.

2.2 Isotopic pattern validation

The local realignment achieved by the DBS algorithm does not al-
ways merge the intensity data of the same compound. We thus pro-
pose to use the isotopic patterns, represented by the intensity ratios
between the mono isotopic peak to the next two isotopic peaks, and
the charge state as the quality metric of alignments. In other words,

Fig. 1. Raw O—TOF data prior to preprocessing by XCMS. Each circle is a unique peak extracted from the corresponding szL file, whose intensity is indicated by
the heat color (white: low intensity; red: high intensity). The green boxes are the blocks placed by the DBS algorithm. The case of failed alignment is presented in
the fourth sample in each row, where the corresponding intensity data in the misaligned sample appeared in a separate row for that sample in the table reported
by XCMS. The three panels show the different misalignment scenarios, but the DBS corrects the misalignment error in each case

if the DBS algorithm correctly realigns a peak in a sample to a differ-
ent m/z—RT coordinate, then its isotopic pattern and charge state
should be consistent with the peaks from other samples that had
been well aligned to the same coordinate. To do this, we provide a
program as a part of MetTailor distribution to identify peak clusters
around fixed m/z—RT coordinates from the raw MS data and extract
their isotopic patterns and the charge states.

2.3 Retention time-based local normalization
We also propose a novel normalization procedure that does not ad-
just all intensity values by a constant normalization factor. When a
large number of samples are processed through a GC-MS/LC-MS
platform, there are numerous temporal factors that can affect inten-
sity measurements over the chromatographic time and subsequent
steps such as the ionization efficiency in electro-spray ionization
(ESI)-MS platforms. To address this, we developed a RT(5)-based
normalization method, in which the normalizing factor is acquired
by the weighted sum of peak area values in the RT neighborhood (of
size 5) of each compound at a specific RT.

The algorithm is capable of automatically determining the opti-
mal window size 5 (see Section 3 for details). In the RT regions

where few compounds are found, the algorithm recognizes the scar-
city of data and borrows the information from other RT regions
with a sufficient amount of data. By design this procedure can adap-
tively remove temporal variations in the intensity data, and it be-
comes equivalent to the T15 normalization in the absence of such
local variations. It is also advantageous in that it prevents a few in-
tense compounds from dominating the normalizing factor across all
ions within each sample.

3 Methods

The starting material for MetTailor is the aligned data reported by
the software packages such as MZmine and XCMS. We denote
the intensity data as Y = {yi} = {yitm}, where the subscripts
t: (1,  ,T), m: (1,  ,M) and/'2 (1,  ,n) are the indexes
for aligned retention times, mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) and samples,
respectively. Hence yjtm is interpreted as the intensity of a peak at
the aligned grid of RT rt and m/z xm in sample 7'. T and M are the
number of unique RT and m/z values appearing in the aligned data
respectively. We also define the block center as the middle of the
m/z—RT grid coordinates.

3.1 Dynamic block summary

Step A Block Initialization: Given the aligned data, the DBS algo-
rithm starts by initializing blocks, where each block is uniformly
sized covering mo in m/z and r0 seconds in the chromatographic
space (default values m0 = 1.2 and r0 = 6 seconds). For each block,
the algorithm goes through a series of decision criteria to determine
whether the current block definition is optimal or not. To explain
the criteria, we have to define the optimality of peak alignment first:
we consider the original processing software has aligned a peak well
if, under the reported alignment, the peak intensity is above a min-
imal intensity threshold I 4 (default 2000) in at least p% of the sam-
ples (default p = 80). We say that a peak intensity is missing in a
sample if its intensity is below I 4 or unreported. After initialization
of blocks, each initial block may contain no well-aligned peak, one
such peak, or multiple peaks, and the iterative block updates have
customized steps for block position adjustment or segmentation in
each of the three cases.

Step Bl Iterative Updates: One well-aligned peak. If the initial
block already contains a single well-aligned peak and the block cen-
ter is located on the m/z-RT grid of the peak, then the DBS termin-
ates the block update for the current block and moves onto the
block summary step (Step C). If not, it repositions the block so that
the block center is at the grid of the well-aligned peak and the algo-
rithm returns to Step A to restart the checklist (whether the modified
block still contains only one well-aligned peak).

Step B2 Iterative Updates: No well-aligned peak. If the initial
block contained no well-aligned peak meeting the criteria, then the
DBS identifies a ‘lead’ peak, defined as the peak with the smallest
number of missing data across the samples. If there are more than
one such lead peaks, then the mean m/z-RT coordinate is defined as
the lead peak. If the current block center coincides with this lead
peak, the DBS terminates the block update and moves on to the
block summary step. If not, it updates the grids of the block so that
its center is placed on the lead peak, and returns to Step A to restart
the checklist.

Step B3 Iterative Updates: Multiple well-aligned peaks. If the ini-
tial block contains two or more well-aligned peaks of different m/z
and RT grids, then the DBS removes the current block definition,
creates one block for each of the peaks, keeping the block size the
same in both m/z and RT axes, and then returns to Step A (recording
that this duplication move was made). If the DBS returns to this
same point of multiple peaks situation (D peaks), with a record of
duplication move, then it breaks the current block into D segments.
Each segment retains the same m/z range as the parent block, but
the RT range will now be defined by setting break points at the mid
points in the RT axis between the D well-aligned peaks. After block
segmentation, the algorithm returns to Step A. These updates are
iterated until there are no more blocks containing multiple well-
aligned peaks.

Step C Summary of intensities and removal of replicated peaks.
Once the DBS moves onto this stage for each block, then it summar-
izes the intensity value for the block by the largest intensity value,
which corresponds to either the apex of an elution profile or the
integrated peak area, depending on the initial data processing
scheme. Finally, the DBS goes through the list of summarized blocks
and removes duplicated blocks.

3.2 Isotopic pattern validation

As a means to extract and compare charge states and isotopic pat-
terns of realignments, we also implemented a program to first ex-
tract the MS1 raw peaks from the m/z-RT coordinates in the aligned

data. The peak extraction is performed for m/z neighborhood with
default parameters of —2 amu to +4 amu on the m/z axis and
—20 to +40 5 in the RT axis. It then routinely determines the charge
states of the candidate compound and extracts the isotopic peak in-
tensity pattern in the form of ratio between the mono isotopic peak
and the subsequent two isotopic peaks. For each aligned peak, the
program reports the mean and standard deviation of the isotopic
ratios across the samples. For a newly recovered peak, we consider
the peak is well recovered if its isotopic ratio falls within a reason-
able range of the distribution of the ratios in the samples with good
initial alignments (e.g. 95% percentile).

3.3 RT(5) normalization

Following the DBS algorithm, MetTailor offers a data normalization
step, where the user can choose either the TIS normalization or a
novel method called RT(5), or opts to skip the normalization step.

TIS normalization: For the TIS normalization, we first compute
the TIS for sample 7'

Ti 2 Zyist
5,!

and transform the data by
yjtm —> yjtm/Tj-

Following this step, we rescale the entire dataset so that the total
normalized intensity across all compounds and samples is equal to
the total sum of pre-normalization intensities. This step ensures that
the normalized intensity values are on a comparable scale with the
raw intensity values.

RT(5) normalization: In this new normalization procedure, we
transform the data as follows. At the block indexed by (t, m), we
first compute the sample-specific local weighted intensity sum

Win 2 23751586,- (rt — 7's)
s!

for all j, where g5i(-) is the Gaussian kernel function with standard
deviation 5,-. We transform the data by

yjtm —> yitm/ Win

for all peaks (with m/z value xm). Here the ‘size’ of the weighting
function 5,- can be provided by the user, or determined by our auto-
mated algorithm (see below). Following this correction, we rescale
the data in a similar way as the TIS normalization, but at a specific
RT grid. In other words, we rescale the data at each RT grid so that
the total intensity sum is the same between the raw data and the ad-
justed data at the specific RT. This step ensures that the order of ab-
solute abundance levels is roughly retained across the compounds
after normalization. Note that the window size 5 should not be too
small since the scaling factor will be dominated by the intensity of
the compound itself, especially in highly abundant compounds. On
the other hand, larger 5 will draw this algorithm closer to the TIS
normalization.

Automated selection of {5,}. We search for the optimal 5,- for
each sample as follows. We first transform the data by

n

J’itm —’ Yitm/Ti * ("T12 Te),

so that the data is scaled to have the same TIS across all the samples.
We then place a sliding window with size 1 min and slide the

window by 30 5 each time, recording the intensity sum in each sam-
ple at each position of the sliding window. For sample 7', we look for
the sample with the most distinct total ion chromatogram (TIC) pro-
file, say k, for which we compute the intensity sum differences
across all the windows and find the longest streak of consecutive
windows with an identical sign (positive or negative). We iterate the
same search for each sample to determine the optimal window size,
and then set 5,- as a quarter of the window size, based on the fact
that four times the standard deviation 5 of a Gaussian kernel will
cover 95 % of such a window size.

3.4 Model-based significance analysis

For the differential expression analysis of block-summarized and
normalized data, we used the hierarchical Bayesian model proposed
by Wei and Li (2007), implemented in the mapDIA software (see
Supplementary Information). mapDIA was initially developed for
quantitative proteomics data analysis obtained from data independ-
ent acquisition MS (DIA-MS), but the differential expression
analysis component is directly applicable to any intensity data. In
the model, two possible probability models of intensity data are pro-
posed for each compound, namely differential expression (DE)
model and non-DE model, respectively, and the posterior probabil-
ity of DE is calculated. The posterior probability scores are used to
select the differentially expressed compounds and is used to compute
the false discovery rates (FDR) (Newton et al., 2004).

4 Results

4.1 Datasets

We used two published datasets to evaluate the performance of
MetTailor in this work. The first is the metabolomics dataset of 24
samples with extracted feature map (featureXML files) and curated
alignment from Lange et al. (2008). We will call this dataset M2
data following the reference in the original paper. To replicate the
steps in the paper, we also made the XCMS read the featureXML
files skipping its peak detection step, and perform alignment and re-
tention time correction with the same parameters as reported in the
paper. For MetTailor, we used all default parameters other than set-
ting the minimal intensity 0 to avoid removal of any data points.
Then we benchmarked all DBS-recovered peaks to the curated peak
alignment for verification.

The second dataset is from a recently published metabolomics
study for Dengue virus infection (Cui et al., 2013) (Dengue data
hereafter). The goal of this study was to identify differentially ex-
pressed metabolites in the serum samples of Dengue patients at dif-
ferent phase of infection and recovery. In the study, blood samples
were taken from 49 control subjects and 27 subjects diagnosed with
acute Dengue fever (DF) but not life threatening Dengue haemor-
rhagic fever/Dengue shock syndrome, where samples were collected
from the patients multiple times at early febrile (rising fever),
defervescence (abating fever) and convulscant (recovery) stages.
This comprises 115 MS runs in total. The samples were analysed
using Agilent 6520 Q-TOF mass spectrometer coupled with ultra-
high pressure LC.

We processed the data using XCMS (Smith et al., 2006) to per-
form peak detection and alignment, and applied MetTailor to the
output data. In the XCMS processing, the default options were used
(see Supplementary Information). For MetTailor processing of this
data, we set default parameters. For quality assessment of realigned
peaks, charge states and isotopic peaks intensity patterns were ex-
tracted from the raw data using the m/z-RT coordinates reported by

MetTailor. RT(5) normalization was performed with the automatic-
ally optimized window size 5. For the statistical significance analysis
using mapDIA, we set the score thresholds associated with 5%
FDR.

4.2 DBS algorithm

4.2.1 The DBS algorithm recovers misalignments with high
sensitivity and specificity

The M2 data contains on average 16 122 features in the 24 samples
and the authors have curated 2630 gold standard peaks by consen-
sus peak groups with annotations from the CAMERA package
(Kuhl et al., 2012). As reported in the reference paper, the initial
alignment by XCMS had recall rate 98% and precision 78%.
However, MetTailor discovered a small proportion of misalignment
events (21 misalignments within 8 unique m/z-RT coordinate,
Supplementary Table S1) and 19 recoveries of these 21 were consist-
ent with the curated alignment. Hence, through MetTailor, we veri-
fied that XCMS achieved the initial alignment really well for the
majority of the gold standard peaks and a small number of mis-
aligned cases were re-aligned. We note that, however, the curated
peaks comprise merely ~16% of the entire peak list and these high
quality peaks with consistent annotation are expected to be aligned
well, and therefore our evaluation based on this dataset is quite
limited.

In the Dengue data, the table initially reported by XCMS con-
tained 7920 aligned peaks appearing in at least one of the 115 MS
runs. Similar to the M2 data, many peaks were localized to highly
consistent m/z and RT coordinates across the samples, if not per-
fectly aligned across the samples. In the reported table, misaligned
peaks appeared as different peaks, and if the intensity levels are
compared between groups of samples (DF stages), then the samples
with misalignments will be considered as missing data, affecting the
statistical analysis. The DBS algorithm alleviated this burden consid-
erably by merging these misaligned peaks into single blocks, while
decreasing the frequency of missing data at the same time.
Specifically, the DBS algorithm reduced the number of aligned peaks
from 7920 to 6915. In this process, the algorithm corrected total of
6989 misalignments, accounting for 2.2% of 315 454 non-missing
data points in the final data. To verify that the realignments by the
DBS algorithm are likely recoveries into the correct line of the table,
we compared the isotopic patterns of the recovered peaks to those of
samples with good initial alignment. We could extract clear isotopic
patterns from 2380 recovered peaks at 285 unique m/z-RT coordin-
ate, and the isotopic ratios between the first and second isotopic
peaks fell in 95% of the ratio distributions from the previously well
aligned peaks in 1938/2380 of the cases (81.4%) (see
Supplementary Table S2 for summary at 285 m/z-RT coordinates).
Combined with the similarity of m/z-RT cooridnates, this reﬂects
high quality realignments by the DBS algorithm across the dataset.

4.2.2 Misalignments arise from a few major sources

The fact that merely 2.2% of the peaks were corrected confirms that
the initial data extraction and alignment was of a high quality in this
data. To gain insights for the source of misalignments, we plotted
the distances to the misaligned peaks on both m/z and RT axis from
the m/z-RT coordinate to which the majority of the samples are
aligned (Fig. 2). 4601/6989 misaligned peaks showed m/z shift of
0.4—0.6 amu and 681/6989 misaligned peaks showed a m/z shift by
0.27—0.4. This suggests that these compounds are likely doubly
or triply charged and the misalignment was caused by incorrect
grouping of the isotopic peaks. This occurred frequently in the data

ate to which the majority of the samples aligned in Dengue data. The dashed I”: o — o -

lines were drawn at :1/2 and :1/3, which indicates that misaligned peaks
are likely from doubly or triply charged compounds

when multiple co-eluting compounds in the vicinity of m/z-RT re-
gions, since the elution profiles of the isotopic peaks overlap.
Misalignment also happened when minor temporal variations out-
last the alignment step by a few seconds of RT or a few decimals in
the m/z beyond the tolerance level specified in those algorithms.

4.2.3 Block-wise recovery reduces missing data in RT regions with
active chromatographic elution

To better understand the benefit of the DBS algorithm, we further
investigated where in the chromatographic space (RT and m/z) and
in what abundance range the DBS algorithm recovered misalign-
ments. Figure 3 shows the number of recovered misalignment events
across 115 samples in the Dengue data, in terms of the chromato-
graphic time (RT) and the abundance range. Figure 3A shows that
the frequency of re-alignments by the DBS algorithm is correlated
with the cross-sample TICs (dashed line), which was computed as
the sum of TICs across the RTs. At the same time, Figure 3B shows
that misalignments occurred mostly for low to medium intensity
peaks. Taken together, this suggests that the misalignment occurs
more frequently for low abundance compounds in active RT regions
with elution of multiple compounds. This also indicates that the
alignment procedure built in XCMS is primarily driven by the most
intense peaks in local RT regions.

4.3 Normalization

Next we tested three different normalization methods, including the
internal standard calibration, TIS normalization and RT(5) normal-
ization. Note that the first two normalization methods uses a single
constant as the normalizing factor for each sample, while the RT(5)
adjusts the normalizing factor locally at each RT grid in each sam-
ple. The first two methods are also different from each other in the
sense that the first uses a known compound injected before sample
preparation for LC-MS whereas the TIS is calculated from the ex-
tracted intensity data.

Before we compared the normalization methods, we first exam-
ined the raw data and discovered that there was no visible vari-
ation in terms of the TIC profiles across the samples, indicating
that there was no constant systematic variation in the chromatog-
raphy across a large number of MS runs [mean correlation 0.971
and 95% confidence interval (0.925 ,0.994)]. However, a closer
examination revealed temporal variations in TIC across many sam-
ples. Figure 4A shows the TIC plots in the raw intensity data, with

Dengue data (115 runs) across the RT (A) and the abundance range (B). The
dashed line is the cross-sample local sums of TICs in sliding windows of RT
(after scaling to the misalignment frequency plot)

a pair of samples highlighted in purple and orange colors. It is easy
to see that the sample in pink had much higher intensities between
600 and 800 5, while the pattern dissipated after 800 5. Even
though these two samples were from different patients, the overall
total intensity differences were very specific to certain RT periods
and this pattern was consistently observed across many pairs of
samples.

4.3.1 Internal standard calibration and TIS normalization

The acetic acid standard (9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl-glycine)
showed little variation across the samples in the Dengue data
(Supplementary Fig. S1). The internal standard appeared in the mid-
dle of the RT range (408 s) and their intensities were not dominant
(the standards accounted for 0.3% of the TIS). Meanwhile, the TIS
values were also calculated for normalization. Interestingly, the TIS
values were not correlated with the intensity values of the internal
standard (Pearson correlation 0.11; Supplementary Fig. S1). As a re-
sult, the normalized data were substantially different between the
two methods (Fig. 4B, C) and this also led to unique sets of com-
pound selected in the DE analysis (see next section).

4.3.2 RT(5) normalization removes temporal variation along

the RT axis

For the RT normalization, 5 values chosen by the automated
search varied in the range of 2—4 min, which is around 10% of the
total RT. Figure 4A suggests that there is a strong evidence of tem-
poral variation in the raw data between 400 and 800 s. The two
single constant-based normalization (TIS and ISC) reduced this
temporal variation at the expense of amplifying the variation in
the 800—1000 second period across the samples. By contrast, the
proposed RT(5) normalization have substantially reduced such
variations localized to specific RT periods (Fig. 4D). In the RT re-
gions with few detected peaks, stable normalizing factors could
not be calculated and were possibly dominated by the compound
itself due to the lack of a sufficient number of background. In these
regions, our procedure borrowed information from the median
pattern of local intensity sums from other RT regions and normal-
ized the data against those values.

4.3.3 RT(5) normalization does not lead to loss of

statistical power

Although we demonstrated that the normalization procedure
removed local chromatographic variations in the visual sense, it is
important to verify that this correction neither removes real biolo-
gical variations nor introduces false positives. To evaluate the possi-
bility of such consequences, we first performed DE analysis between
controls and patients in the febrile stage with normalization options.
For the DE analysis, we set the significance score threshold to con-
trol the Bayesian FDR at 5%. We also considered the peaks or
blocks that can be assigned at least one compound identifier as-
signed through the online HMDB search (tolerance : 10 ppm, singly
doubly or triply charged, [M+H], [M+2H] and [M+3H], no
other adducts, peptides excluded).

The three normalization methods reported 476 DE compounds
(significant in at least one method) and 62% were shared by all
methods. Each method reported a handful of unique compounds
nonetheless. In RT(5) normalized data, which we deem to be the
optimal normalization method in this data, led to a selection of
unique DE compounds which were more spatially randomly dis-
tributed across the RT. Moreover, when compounds show DE
in both TIS and ISC normalized data, a majority of them are also
DE in RT(5) normalized data. On the other hand, many of the
compounds significant in the TIS and RT-normalized data were
found to be non-significant in the ISC normalized data.
Supplementary Figures S2 and S3 show the distribution of signifi-
cant compounds in the data with each normalization method and
the differences between the three outputs respectively. The latter
figure verifies that the RT normalization did not lead to potential
loss of statistical power compared to the other two normalization
methods.

5 Discussion and conclusion

In this work, we developed a software package MetTailor, featur-
ing a novel block summary method called DBS algorithm and an
adaptive normalization method to remove temporal variations

across a large number of untargeted MS experiments. These add-
itional data processing steps were introduced as a complementary
tool for quality assurance of the data reported by the extrac-
tion tools such as MZmine and XCMS. With inexpensive compu-
tational effort, these steps can address missing data problem
and remove local variations that vary across retention time in a
long series of MS experiments. We also provide implementations
to extract the charge state and isotopic profiles from the raw data
at specific m/z-RT coordinates so that the users can evaluate the
quality of post-alignment peak summary tables as a validation
step.

5.1 Utility of the DBS algorithm

Although the number of re-alignment events was relatively modest
in our demonstration with both datasets, the DBS algorithm is com-
putationally inexpensive and a few minutes of runtime can provide
an important quality check for the initial alignment data, with add-
itional recovery of thousands of misaligned peaks across the sam-
ples. We expect that the DBS algorithm will be equally useful for
datasets generated with older generation mass spectrometers (e.g.
linear quadrupole ion trap MS, old generation Q-TOF) and the next
generation ones (e.g. Quadrupole-Orbitrap, QqTOF), since the
alignment accuracy has more to do with temporal variations in the
elution rate of individual compounds across the samples, rather than
the mass accuracy and resolution of MS. A complementary tool
such as MetTailor will therefore be of great importance from the
data quality control perspective.

However, we remark that the DBS algorithm is inherently lim-
ited by the fact that its working material is the preprocessed data,
which is a significantly compressed form of information for each
peak feature as centroiding, deisotoping, and compression of ad-
ducts is applied during the first-round processing. With the increas-
ing computation power, a more advanced alignment algorithm with
a local alignment procedure matching individual peak features can
be developed, directly utilizing various raw peak features such as
isotopic distributions and adduct information without a severe data
compression step.

5.2 Missing data imputation

Another important point of discussion is on the use of machine
learning methods to impute missing data (Gromski et al., 2014).
One may argue that the DBS procedure can be replaced by using
other imputation procedures such as k-nearest neighbor or random
forest imputation (Stekhoven and Buhlmann, 2012; Troyanskaya
et al., 2001). To put the utility of the two approaches in perspective,
it is important to recognize the difference in the source of missing
data addressed by each method. The DBS algorithm is addressing
the problem of misalignment or variation in the elution profiles of
the same analytes across different GC-MS/LC-MS experiments.
Since this approach addresses the missing data problem incurred
during the data tabulation process, it only deals with the source of
missing data that can be corrected within the limit of detection of
mass spectrometers.

By contrast, the aforementioned methods perform imputation by
inference, which do not differentiate between different sources of
missing data and primarily aim to fill in the missing values based on
the pattern matching with other compounds. In practice, this group
of methods should be used carefully in highly variable systems as
GC-MS/LC-MS, as a last resort after all available remedies to cor-
rect the errors in the data extraction stage have been exhausted. This
is because the algorithms depend heavily on the availability of in-
formative neighbor compounds in the same dataset. Moreover, al-
though these methods are widely used at present, they were
evaluated primarily on gene expression microarrays that quantify
predetermined molecular targets. Hence whether the same proced-
ures will be applicable and equally efficient on MS-based metabolo-
mics datasets, plagued by the ambiguity of isomers in small
molecules, remains to be evaluated.

5.3 Data normalization

Finally, we have also proposed a novel normalization algorithm that
removes temporally systematic variations frequently observed in the
GC-MS and LC-MS pipeline. Retention time is clearly one of the
most important anchors of experimental variations in the GC-MS
and LC-MS platforms (Rudnick et al., 2014), which is often ignored
in conventional computational normalization strategies. It is also
important to note that some of the distribution equalizing methods
such as IQR-based normalization or quantile normalization can
introduce over-adjustments, since these procedures are applicable
only when a certain assumptions are met. For example, the proced-
ure based on mean centering and standard deviation scaling requires
that the overall log-intensity distribution be normally distributed.
The quantile normalization is not applicable when missing data
are prevalent and can be risky when there are only a handful of
metabolites (e.g. a few hundreds) since the procedure can easily
over-correct intensities of very high or very low abundance com-
pounds due to the granularity of percentile points.

5.4 Conclusion

Overall, our contribution in this work is to provide an open source
software package implementing two data processing steps, as a com-
plimentary tool to remedy some gaps unaddressed by the popular
data extraction tools in the context of large sample experiments.
There are a number of experimental factors that are unique to MS
platforms and the two proposed methods are different from the exist-
ing alternatives that had been developed for other -omics platforms
such as gene expression microarrays. We provide these tools in a

popular R programming environment, and will continue to adapt the
tools for constantly evolving instrumentation in the future.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Studies of the biochemical functions and activities of un-
cultivated microorganisms in the environment require analysis of DNA
sequences for phylogenetic characterization and for the development
of sequence-based assays for the detection of microorganisms. The
numbers of sequences for genes that are indicators of environmentally
important functions such as nitrogen (N2) fixation have been rapidly
growing over the past few decades. Obtaining these sequences from
the National Center for Biotechnology Information’s GenBank data-
base is problematic because of annotation errors, nomenclature vari-
ation and paralogues; moreover, GenBank’s structure and tools are
not conducive to searching solely by function. For some genes, such
as the nifH gene commonly used to assess community potential for N2
fixation, manual collection and curation are becoming intractable be-
cause of the large number of sequences in GenBank and the large
number of highly similar paralogues. If analysis is to keep pace with
sequence discovery, an automated retrieval and curation system is
necessary.

Results: ARBitrator uses a two-step process composed of a broad
collection of potential homologues followed by screening with a best
hit strategy to conserved domains. 34 420 nifH sequences were iden-
tified in GenBank as of November 20, 2012. The false-positive rate is
~0.033%. ARBitrator rapidly updates a public nifH sequence data-
base, and we show that it can be adapted for other genes.

1 INTRODUCTION

Microorganisms catalyze a variety of biogeochemical transform-
ations, such as nitrogen (N2) ﬁxation, that are critical for eco-
system function. Because many microorganisms in the
environment have not been cultivated, studies of such functions
depend on ampliﬁcation and sequencing of genes that encode
proteins involved in the functions of interest (Ueda et al., 1995;

Zehr et al., 1995, 2003). This approach facilitates detection and
phylogenetic characterization of uncultivated microorganisms.
Dinitrogen (N2) is the most abundant gas in the atmosphere,
but is not bioavailable unless it is reduced to ammonia by N2
ﬁxation. Biological N2 ﬁxation can require the protein products
of up to 20 m'f genes. The nifH, m'fD and nsz gene products are
the structural components of the conventional molybdenum
(Mo)-containing nitrogenase enzyme (Igarashi, 2003). The prod-
ucts of other m'f genes are involved in roles such as regulation
and biosynthesis (Rubio and Ludden, 2008). In environmental
studies, nifH, which encodes the iron (Fe) protein of molybde-
num (Mo), vanadium (V) and iron (Fe) nitrogenases, is the most
commonly used nitrogenase gene for the investigation of micro-
organisms with the potential to ﬁx N2, as it is the most highly
conserved in sequence (Young, 1992). This gene can be used to
examine the diversity of N2-ﬁxing microorganisms in the envir-
onment, provides insight into the evolution and ecology of N2
ﬁxation and can indicate the potential for N2 ﬁxation in micro-
bial communities (Lovell et al., 2001; Zehr and Capone, 1996).
The application of degenerate nifH PCR primers (Zehr and
McReynolds, 1989) enabled the discovery of novel nifH se-
quences in the environment. This approach fueled studies of
N2 ﬁxation across a broad range of habitats, including woody
dicotyledenous plants (Simonet et al., 1991), rice roots (Ueda
et al., 1995), termite guts (Ohkuma et al., 1996), stromatolites
(Steppe et al., 1996), central ocean gyres (Zehr et al., 1998) and
salt marshes (Lovell et al., 2001). The size of phylogenetic trees
based on all available nucleotide and amino acid sequences ex-
panded from 19 sequences in 1994 (Chien and Zinder, 1994) to
~100 sequences in 1997 (Zehr et al., 1997) and to ~1500 se-
quences in 2003 (Zehr et al., 2003). Four (or ﬁve, depending
on author) major phylogenetic clusters have been described
(Chien and Zinder, 1994; Gaby and Buckley, 2011; Raymond
et al., 2004; Zehr et al., 2003). Only three of these phylogenetic-
ally related clusters contain true nitrogenase-encoding m'f genes.
Cluster 1 nifH primarily comprises ‘conventional’ nifH, which
encodes the Fe protein of Mo nitrogenase (Igarashi, 2003), as
well as van genes that encode the Fe protein of V nitrogenase
(note that vanadium nitrogenase genes cluster differently based
on m'fD or nsz genes; Raymond et al., 2004). Organisms that
contain Cluster 1 nifH genes include cyanobacteria and alpha-,
beta— and gamma-proteobacteria. Cluster II nifH genes encode
the Fe protein of ‘alternative’ nitrogenases that contain iron but
do not contain M0 or V (Joerger et al., 1989; Lehman and

Roberts, 1991). Cluster III is dominated by genes encoding Fe
proteins of nitrogenases primarily of anaerobes, including meth-
anogens and sulfate reducers; these nitrogenases likely contain
Mo. Clusters IV and V (sometimes grouped as Cluster IV) con-
tain nifH paralogues whose functions include photopigment bio-
synthesis (Young, 2005) and non-Nz-ﬁxation electron transport
(Raymond et al., 2004). It has also been suggested that the func-
tion of Cluster IV nifH paralogues found in non-Nz-ﬁxing
Archaea is the biosynthesis of cofactor F430, essential to the
production of methane (Boyd et al., 2011; Staples et al., 2007).
The gene name nﬂH, for ‘me-like’, has been proposed for these
nifH paralogues (Staples et al., 2007).

As sequences are accumulating rapidly in gene sequence data-
bases, ongoing efforts to retrieve and analyze new nifH records
are necessary to elucidate relationships between phylogenetic
categories and identify phylotypes in different ecosystems.
These efforts can be frustrated by the sheer number and
growth rate of nifH gene sequences deposited into the National
Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank data-
base (Benson, 2004). For example, in February 2009, Gaby and
Buckley identiﬁed nifH sequences from the non-redundant nu-
cleotide collection database (nr/nt) at GenBank for a global
census of nitrogenase diversity (Gaby and Buckley, 2011) and
records were manually curated to form a database of ~17 000
sequences. We estimate that in the intervening time between the
download and publication of the related article in 2011, at least
10000 nifH sequences were added to the database. We estimate
that as of January 2012 there were >32 000 nifH sequences in
that database, with a growth rate of >300 sequences per month.
Retrieval involving human intervention now requires a signiﬁ-
cant investment of manpower that will increase over time; an
automated retrieval pipeline is needed to allow analysis to keep
pace with data collection. However, automating retrieval of all
sequences of any speciﬁc gene from GenBank is difﬁcult.
Moreover, the most common query idioms for searching
GenBank are variants of BLAST (Altschul et al., 1990), which
search for sequence similarity rather than function. Approaches
based on BLAST alone are likely to be overly sensitive, as hits to
nifH homologues with functions other than N2 ﬁxation are not
easily distinguished from genuine nifH hits. Text searches that
analyze sequence annotation can be misled by misannotation
(Tripp et al., 2011) or misspellings in the annotation ﬁelds; a
text search for ‘nifh’ in the nr protein database found only
6173 sequences, of which we believe 527 are not actually nifH.
The Fungene database (http://fungene.cme.msu.edu) provides a
repository of collections of functional genes from GenBank, clas-
siﬁed by hidden Markov models (Eddy, 1998; Krogh et al.,
1994); however, updates from GenBank are infrequent and the
hidden Markov model approach is prone to false calls. An alter-
native me database available to the public, maintained at
Cornell (Gaby and Buckley, 2011, 2014), requires the manual
retrieval and curation of GenBank nifH sequences.

To resolve these issues, a software pipeline was developed,
called ARBitrator, that requires little human intervention and
retrieves up-to-date nifH sequence collections within a few
hours. The software is adaptable to collecting sequences for
genes other than nifH, and is especially helpful for discriminating
genes of interest from their paralogues, as it incorporates an
auto-curation feature based on best Reversed PSI-BLAST hits

to GenBank’s Conserved Domain Database. ARBitrator’s
output is formatted for input into other programs, such as the
ARB phylogenetic software environment (Ludwig et al., 2004).
Supplementary Appendix A provides a procedure for incremen-
tally updating an existing nifH ARB database using the output of
ARBitrator, thus facilitating maintenance of a comprehensive
updated gene database.

2 SYSTEM AND METHODS

2.1 Design criteria

To retrieve sequences for a single gene (in this case the nifH gene)
from a large public database, and to facilitate maintenance of a
sequence database for that gene, a pipeline needs to meet speciﬁc
design criteria. Based on experience with maintaining a public
database of nifH sequences (http://pmc.ucsc.edu/~wwwzehr/
research/database/), the following requirements were identiﬁed:

(1) The pipeline should be easy to invoke and should require
no manual setup or runtime intervention. In particular, the
pipeline should use the public online GenBank database
and services provided by NCBI, rather than using a local
copy of the database that would need to be downloaded
and updated before pipeline execution.

(2) The data should not require manual curation. Given the
current size of the GenBank database and the rate at
which new nifH sequences are submitted, any step invol-
ving even trivial manual inspection of individual records
would introduce excessive delays and possible errors.

(3) The pipeline should have acceptable error rates.
Automated classiﬁcation systems have inherent error
rates that must be controlled to within acceptable toler-
ances. In the case of nifH classiﬁcation, sequences with
strong similarity to nifH but different function might be
accepted on the basis of homology (false positives).
Similarly, sequences with nifH function that have strong
similarity to non-nifH genes might be rejected (false nega-
tives). Both kinds of error must be minimized.

(4) Sequence identiﬁcation should not rely on annotations in
the database. Although annotations are useful as quality-
control checks (e. g. for determining false-positive/—negative
rates), classiﬁcation should be based only on sequence con-
tent. A solution based on annotations could be no better
than the false-annotation rate, which is unknown but may
be too high for reliable classiﬁcation. Moreover, any such
solution would complicate the software by requiring nat-
ural language processing.

(5) The output of the pipeline should contain all metadata
associated with the identiﬁed sequences, presented in a
standard format. The pipeline’s results should be easy to
analyze. We have traditionally used ARB (Ludwig et al.,
2004) to build phylogenetic trees of nifH sequences; there-
fore, the pipeline must produce output in EMBL format
(Kanz, 2004), which ARB is able to read. All annotation
information and metadata should be included in the
EMBL records.

Fig. 1. ARBitrator ﬂowchart. In the sensitivity phase, representative nifH
sequences are BLASTed against the GenBank database at NCBI. In the
speciﬁcity phase, candidate sequences retrieved by the sensitivity phase
are BLASTed against a database of conserved domains. In the formatting
phase, accepted sequences are output as EMBL records. After
ARBitrator executes, the protocol described in Supplementary
Appendix A is used to add new records to an existing ARB database

(6) The pipeline should be adaptable to the retrieval of genes
other than nifH. To this end, code should be open source
under standard licenses, and adaptation should not require
a high level of programming expertise or technical support.

2.2 Algorithm

ARBitrator evaluates candidate sequences on two criteria, which
we designate ‘quality’ and ‘superiority’. Quality measures a can-
didate sequence’s similarity to the most similar member of a
repre—sentative set of 15 nifH sequences; superiority measures
the degree to which a candidate is more similar to nifH than to
genes coding for other known proteins. ARBitrator ﬁrst executes
a sensitivity phase in which it collects candidates based on quality
(Fig. 1). Initial investigations showed that this phase is effective
at ﬁnding nifH sequences; however, many non-nifH (false posi-
tive) sequences are also collected. In the subsequent speciﬁcity
phase, false-positive candidates are eliminated based on super-
iority. In a ﬁnal formatting phase, nucleotide sequences and
annotations are retrieved for each accepted sequence, and an
output ﬁle is generated in EMBL format.

2.3 Implementation

In the sensitivity phase, a set of nifH protein sequences is
BLASTed against the nr database at GenBank using the blastp
(protein query, protein subject) program. Given the large
number of known nifH sequences (>15 000 at the inception of
this project), a ‘representative set’ was selected consisting of 15
sequences that are evenly distributed throughout the nifH phylo-
genetic tree (Fig. 2). By only BLASTing these representative se-
quences, rather than all known sequences, time spent in this
phase of the algorithm is reduced by three orders of magnitude.
For all candidate sequences (hits) retrieved, we deﬁne ‘quality’ as
the negative loglo of the E—value of the hit. If a subject is hit by

multiple queries from the representative set, then quality is
deﬁned as the negative loglo of the smallest E—value across all
hits. The sensitivity phase accepts sequences with quality :2 (i.e.
all E—values are 30.01). The output of this phase is a collection of
GIs (GenInfo Identiﬁers).

To support the speciﬁcity phase, a database of conserved do-
mains was constructed based on the total set of GenBank
Conserved Domains in the Subfamily Hierarchy for cd01983,
Fer4_Nifh. Candidate GIs that meet the sensitivity criteria are
Reversed PSI-BLASTed against this database. The Reversed
PSI-BLAST (Reversed Position-Speciﬁc Iterated BLAST) algo-
rithm uses position-speciﬁc scoring (Marchler-Bauer et al., 2001,
2011), and is thus appropriate for conserved domain analysis, as
differences within a conserved domain are penalized more heav-
ily than differences in non-conserved regions. The three best-
scoring hits for each candidate are analyzed. Any hits to the
cd02117 (NifH_like) conserved domain are discarded as unin-
formative; candidate sequences are accepted if the best remaining
hit is to the cd02040 (NifH) conserved domain, and the E—value
of this hit is at least 10x smaller than the E—value of the next best
hit. We deﬁne a sequence’s superiority as loglo (E-value of best
non-cd02040 hit) —log10 (E-value of cd02040 hit). Thus, candi-
dates are accepted if their superiority is :1. The output of the
sensitivity phase is a subset of the protein GIs generated by the
sensitivity phase, representing sequences that ARBitrator classi-
ﬁes as m'fH. For analysis requiring only protein GIs, the pipeline
may optionally be terminated at this point.

The formatting phase retrieves the nucleotide coding sequence
and annotations associated with each protein GI, and builds a
record in EMBL format (Kulikova et al., 2007). The GenBank
protein record for each GI is retrieved from NCBI via the
eUtils utility (http://www.ncbi.nhn.nih.gov/books/NBK25497/
pdf/chapter2.pdf). This record is scanned for the ‘coded_by’ sub-
ﬁeld of the ‘CDS’ (coding sequence) ﬁeld to extract the identiﬁer
of a nucleotide sequence—typically a complete genome—along
with coordinates for the start and end of the protein sequence. A
second eUtils query retrieves the nucleotide record, from which
the nifH nucleotide sequence is extracted. The public-domain
ReadSeq utility (http://iubio.bio.indiana.edu/soft/molbio/read-
seq/java/) converts this record to EMBL format. Lastly, for com-
patibility with ARB’s input ﬁltering, multi-line literal quote ﬁeld

values in the EMBL record are concatenated into single mono-
lithic lines.

After execution of the pipeline, new records can be incorpo-
rated into an existing ARB database using a protocol described
in Supplementary Appendix A. Brieﬂy, new records are imported
into ARB using a custom import ﬁlter. All protein sequences are
then exported and aligned to the NifH/Fer protein family using
a hidden Markov model. The aligned sequences are then im-
ported into ARB. Nucleotide sequences are backaligned to the
protein alignment using the ARB backalign tool. The nucleotide
and amino acid sequences can then be used for phylogenetic
analysis and probe design.

2.4 Tuning

The software’s classiﬁcation algorithm is ﬁne-tuned by three par-
ameters: the representative set of veriﬁed nifH sequences used as
the BLAST queries of the sensitivity phase, and the threshold
values for quality and superiority. The representative set was
chosen to broadly represent the known clades in the nifH phylo-
genetic tree. Members of the set are shown in Figure 2.

To determine threshold values for quality and superiority,
positive and negative training sets were created. The positive
training set contains the 15 513 nifH sequences in a manually
curated nifH database (http://pmc.ucsc.edu/~wwwzehr/re—
search/database/) as of September 1, 2010. The negative training
set contains 766 sequences that are believed not to be nifH but
that are moderately similar to nifH. Optimal quality and super-
iority thresholds were computed by exhaustive search of quality—
superiority space. When quality threshold = 2 and superiority
threshold = 1, miscalls are minimized in both training sets.
These thresholds were veriﬁed by N-fold cross-validation.

2.5 Error rates

To determine false-positive and false-negative rates, ARBitrator
was executed immediately after the November 2012 run reported
herein, with the quality threshold relaxed to zero and the super-
iority threshold relaxed to —10. This generated a sample set con-
sisting of sequences that were accepted by ARBitrator as nifH, as
well as sequences that were rejected by a small margin. Sequences
were aligned to a Pfam-curated multiple alignment of the NifH/
fer family (Fer4_NifH; PF00142) using the HMMalign module
of the HMMer software package (Finn et al., 2011). Sequences
that were too short for reliable alignment were omitted from the
error-rate computation. To classify ‘accept’ sequences, a neigh-
bor-joining phylogenetic tree (Saitou and Nei, 1987) was con-
structed using sequences that had amino acid residues in the
region most widely PCR ampliﬁed by nifH primers (Zehr eta].
2003), as the majority of the sequences submitted to GenBank
are from PCR ampliﬁcation. Sequences with short branches
within Clusters I through III were classiﬁed as nifH; sequences
with short branches within Cluster IV (which contains nifH
homologues and non-functional genes) could not be classiﬁed
with conﬁdence, and were omitted from the error-rate computa-
tion; sequences with long branches within Cluster IV were clas-
siﬁed as not nifH. ARBitrator’s false-positive rate was computed
as the number of ‘accept’ sequences classiﬁed phylogenetically as
not nifH, divided by the total number of ‘accept’ sequences that
could be aligned. A false-positive rate for sequences reported as

nifH by Fungene was computed by the same method. To classify
‘reject’ sequences, any sequence that aligned poorly with the
NifH/fer family model was classiﬁed as not nifH. Those that
aligned well but did not have amino acid residues in the region
most widely ampliﬁed by nifH primers were omitted from the
error-rate computation, as their phylogenetic analysis would not
be reliable. A neighbor-joining tree was constructed using the
remaining ‘rejects’ (i.e. those whose alignments permitted phylo-
genetic analysis), and the nifH representative set sequences.
Classiﬁcation was performed as described above, except that
sequences with short branches to Cluster IV were conserva-
tively classiﬁed as nifH to determine an upper bound for the
false-positive rate.

To assess the reliability of annotations among nifH and similar
sequences, annotated gene function was retrieved for all ‘accept’
and ‘reject’ sequences. Records whose annotated function was
nifH or synonymous to nifH (‘dinitrogenase reductase’,
‘nitrogenase Fe protein’ and 138 others) were classiﬁed as anno-
tated as nifH. Phylogeny-based misannotation rates were com-
puted using the approach described to determine error rates.
Sequences whose annotation contradicted phylogenetic classiﬁ-
cation were blasted against the GenBank nr database to assess
the likelihood of misannotation.

2.6 Extension beyond nifH

To test ARBitrator’s effectiveness on genes other than nifH, the
pipeline was conﬁgured to retrieve sequences of the m'fD gene
(that encodes the alpha subunit of the Mo, V and Fe nitrogenase
proteins). The representative sequence set consisted of the m'fD
sequences of the organisms that contributed to the nifH repre-
sentative set, as well as three sequences of vnfD (the vanadium-
using form of m'fD). A positive training set was built by running
the pipeline with the m'fD representative and the quality/super-
iority settings used for nifH, and hand-selecting 73 sequences
from the results; 43 additional sequences were added from six
published studies (Dedysh, 2004; Fani et al., 2000; Henson et al.,
2004; Holmes, 2004; Parker et al., 2002; Rodriguez-Echeverria,
2010). A negative training set was built by selecting 82 sequences
of ﬁve genes that are known to have high similarity to nisz m'fE,
nifH, m'fK, m'fN and protochlorophyllide reductase. Optimal
quality and superiority thresholds were computed by exhaustive
search of quality—superiority space, and the pipeline was exe-
cuted with quality = 8.1 and superiority = 0.1. As with the
nifH conﬁguration, the thresholds were then relaxed to generate
a sample set for computation of true- and false-negative rates.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Sequences Retrieved on November 20, 2012

On November 20, 2012, ARBitrator returned 34 420 nifH se-
quences from GenBank, of which 1757 were new to GenBank
since the previous ARBitrator run on July 11, 2012. The list of
protein sequence GIs may be downloaded from http://pmc.ucsc.

etic tree of representatives of the 34 420 sequences.

relationship with superiority = 1.3 + .45 x quality, and a coefﬁ-

ARBitrator cluster around the point (quality = 63, superior-
ity = 28). Intriguingly, there is a cluster of rejected sequences
around the point (quality = 2, superiority = —5); these are pre-
dominantly annotated as septum—site determining proteins or

3.2 Error rates

Of 34 420 sequences in the sample set that are called nifH by
ARBitrator (upper-right quadrant in Fig. 4), 2208 are too
short for phylogenetic analysis and are omitted from the error-
rate computation. 30 051 cluster with short branches with
Clusters I, II and III, and are conﬁrmed as nifH. 2151 sequences
that cluster with short branches within Cluster IV cannot be
conﬁdently classiﬁed as nifH or not-nifH, and are omitted
from the computation. Ten sequences associate via long branches
with Cluster IV and are classiﬁed as not nifH. Thus, the phylo-
genetically derived false-positive rate is 10/(10 + 30051) =
0.033%. Of the 32 227 sequences in the sample that are rejected
by ARBitrator (upper-left, lower-left and lower-right quadrants
in Fig. 4), 2067 are too short for phylogenetic analysis and are
omitted from the error-rate computation. 28 846 align poorly
with the NifH/fer family and are conﬁrmed as not nifH. 1134
cluster with long branches within Cluster IV, and are also con-
ﬁrmed as not nifH. Eight associate via short branches with
Cluster IV and are omitted from the error-rate computation.
Thus, the phylogenetic analysis detected no false-negative
errors. See Supplementary Figure S1 for phylogenetic trees of
accepted and rejected sequences.

104 sequences that ARBitrator accepts are annotated as not
nifH; 87 of these are conﬁrmed by phylogeny as nifH (i.e. phyl-
ogeny conﬁrms ARBitrator’s call), 10 are classiﬁed by phylogeny
as not nifH and 10 cannot be phylogenetically classiﬁed. A total
of 88 sequences in the sample set that ARBitrator rejects are
annotated as nifH; 82 of these are classiﬁed by phylogeny as
not nifH (i.e. phylogeny conﬁrms ARBitrator’s call), 8 are

classiﬁed by phylogeny as nifH and 8 cannot be phylogenetically
classiﬁed.

3.3 Comparison to other nifH databases

The sequences were compared with the 31970 sequences in the
Fungene database as of November 20, 2012. ARBitrator and
Fungene had 29 836 sequences in common. ARBitrator collected
4584 sequences that Fungene rejected, and Fungene collected
2134 sequences that ARBitrator rejected; of these, ARBitrator
rejected 1744 because of quality and 390 because of superiority.
For the sequences reported by both ARBitrator and Fungene,
the phylogenetically derived false-positive rate is 0.033%, the
same as the overall ARBitrator false-positive rate. For the
2134 sequences that only Fungene reports as nifH, 1964 did
not align with the NifH/fer family and are classiﬁed as not
nifH. Thus, the false-positive rate for these sequences is :1964/
2134 = 92%. The overall Fungene false-positive rate is 6.2%.

The second update of the Cornell nifH database reported in
Gaby and Buckley (2014)—based on a May 2012 snapshot of
GenBank—contained 32 854 nt records, 28 742 of which have
corresponding protein records speciﬁed by a ‘db_xref’ ﬁeld,
thus permitting comparison with ARBitrator. ARBitrator re-
jected 479 of these records (1.7%): 440 because of low quality,
and 39 because of low superiority.

3.4 niﬂ) results

The m'fD conﬁguration of the pipeline returned 2747 sequences,
of which 2726 are annotated as m'fD, for a false-positive rate
of 0.76% conditioned on annotation accuracy. The sample set
contained 8715 rejected sequences, of which 76 are annotated as
m'fD, for an annotation-conditioned false-negative rate of 0.87%.
For the 2972 m'fD sequences reported by Fungene for which
unambiguous annotations could be retrieved, the annotation-
conditioned false-positive rate is 48%.

4 DISCUSSION

nifH gene diversity studies, and all single-gene diversity studies,
are hampered by the difﬁculty of collecting all sequences asso-
ciated with the gene of interest. NCBI’s GenBank, the database
where newly discovered sequences are deposited, provides no ser-
vice for selecting all records that are annotated as representing a
speciﬁed gene. A direct text search of the database would be
of dubious value because of misannotations. GenBank’s main
query idiom is the BLAST search, which selects based on
sequence similarity regardless of function. Consequently, a se-
quence collection pipeline that simply BLASTs a representative
set of query genes will accept paralogues with the wrong function.
The challenge of supporting diversity studies is exacerbated by the
rapid growth of GenBank: the collection of nifH, and presumably
other genes, appears to have been growing exponentially for the
past several years. Thus, there exists an opportunity to facilitate
diversity studies by increasing the efﬁciency of sequence retrieval.

4.1 Necessity for both quality and superiority criteria

As Figure 4 shows, sequences obtained and accepted as nifH by
ARBitrator (above and to the right of the purple crosshairs)

cluster around the point (quality = 63, superiority = 28). When
the quality and superiority criteria are relaxed (to the left of
and/or below the crosshairs), a second cluster appears around
quality = 0.1, superiority = —5; sequences in this second cluster
are predominantly annotated as M inD (membrane ATPase
of the MinC-MinD-MinE system) or CobB (cobyrinic acid
a,c—diamide synthase, involved in the biosynthesis of vitamin
B12). There is an approximately linear relationship between
quality and superiority (superiority = 1.3 + .45 quality), with
r2 = 0.91. This relationship is not strong enough to allow
either quality or superiority alone to be used as a selection cri-
terion. For example, without the quality criterion, all sequences
to the right of the vertical crosshair would be accepted, including
many sequences from the M inD/cobyrinic acid peak. Similarly,
without the superiority criterion, all sequences below the hori-
zontal crosshair would be accepted.

4.2 Error rates

ARBitrator’s low error rates (0.033% false positives, no detect-
able false negatives) can be understood in light of the underlying
similarities between the ARBitrator algorithm and the error-rate
analysis. In both approaches, candidate sequences are aligned
against known nifH sequences. With ARBitrator, the candidate
sequences are the contents of the GenBank protein database, and
the known nifH sequences are the 15 representative sequences;
during the sensitivity phase, the BLAST step aligns each query
(known nifH representative) against each database member (can-
didate). Candidates are provisionally accepted if they align well
enough with the representatives, with the speciﬁcity phase pro-
viding necessary additional accuracy to the measurement of
alignment quality. In the error-rate analysis, the candidate se-
quences are the members of the ARBitrator sample set, which
are aligned against the known nifH members of the Fer4_NifH
Pfam family. The alignment algorithms in the two appro-
aches are not identical in all implementation details, but in
both cases sequences are accepted if and only if they are similar
to known nifH sequences, with similarity measured by alignment
score.

When a sequence’s annotation contradicts gene its ARBitrator
classiﬁcation (i.e. ARBitrator accepts a sequence that is not
annotated as nifH, or rejects a sequence that is annotated as
nifH), phylogenetic analysis supports the ARBitrator call in
90% of cases. In all, 104 sequences are classiﬁed by
ARBitrator as nifH but annotated as not nifH. When these
were BLASTed against the nr database, and the top 20 non-
self hits for each query were inspected, 48 queries hit exclusively
to nifH subjects or to non-nifH subjects from the same study as
the query. We propose that these subject sequences, which come
from two studies that submitted multiple sequences to GenBank,
were systematically misannotated by the researchers and should
have been annotated as nifH. Similarly, ARBitrator rejects
88 sequences that are annotated as nifH. When these were
blasted against the nr database and the top 20 hits of each
query were inspected, it was found that 54 of the queries hit
exclusively to non-nifH subjects, or to nifH subjects from the
same study as the query. These subject sequences come from
ﬁve studies that submitted multiple sequences to GenBank,

and we propose that these sequences were systematically misan-
notated as nifH.

4.3 Comparison with other nifH databases

The ARBitrator and Fungene databases as of November 20,
2012, had 29836 nifH sequences in common. ARBitrator ac-
cepted 4584 sequences that Fungene rejected. The false-positive
rate for these sequences is approximately the same as for the
overall sample set (0.03%). Fungene accepted 2134 sequences
that ARBitrator rejected; the false-positive rate for these se-
quences is 90%. This discrepancy can perhaps be attributed to
the fundamental difference between ARBitrator’s BLAST-based
algorithm and the hidden Markov model that underlies the
Fungene pipeline. ARBitrator classiﬁes according to similarity
to representative nifH sequences and to the NifH conserved
domain; Fungene classiﬁes according to similarity to a composite
proﬁle model.

ARBitrator’s results are substantially in agreement with the
latest update of the Buckley Laboratory database, which is not
generated by auto-curating software and requires manual pro-
cessing (Gaby and Buckley, 2014).

4.4 Extension beyond nifH

The nifD pipeline conﬁguration, despite being based on cruder
positive and negative training sets than the nifH conﬁguration,
nevertheless produced annotation-based error rates that were
<l%. This result supports the applicability of the ARBitrator
algorithm to other genes besides nifH.

The discrepancy between the superiority thresholds for nifH
(1.0) and nifD (0.1) can be explained by the evolutionary history
of nifD, which apparently originated as an ancestral gene that
underwent a duplication event, giving rise to an ancestral bicis—
tronic operon that later duplicated again to produce the present-
day nifD, nifE, nifK and nifN genes (Fani et al., 2000). Thus,
many nifD genes have low superiority because their similarity
to the nifE, nifK and nifN conserved domains is only slightly
worse than their similarity to the nifD conserved domain.
A higher superiority threshold would reject such sequences and
increase the false-negative rate. The similarity of nifD to other
genes makes it a particularly rigorous test of the extension of the
ARBitrator approach.

In conclusion, by combining a quality-based sensitivity phase
with a superiority-based speciﬁcity phase, we have been able to
implement a pipeline that meets all design criteria. Records pro-
vide nucleotide and amino acid sequences, as well as complete
annotations. Computed false-positive and false-negative rates are
acceptably low, and actual rates may be even lower. Results from
the November 20, 2012, run are generally in good agreement
with the nifH sequence collection at Fungene; however, the
ARBitrator results are more extensive, have a lower error rate,
and can be updated whenever a user wishes to rerun the pipeline.
ARBitrator is designed to support ongoing nifH phylogeny re-
search into the future as the GenBank collection continues to
grow exponentially. If error rates increase, adjustments can be
made to the quality and superiority thresholds. If NifH/Fer
family and CobB sequences continue to be major contributors
to the false-positive rate, the software may need to be adapted to
detect and reject these special cases.

In addition to its original application to nifH phylogeny,
ARBitrator can be adapted to other genes, as evidenced by the
nifD results. An immediate use for adapted versions of the pipe-
line would be the collection nif genes other than nifH and nifD.
Comparison of phylogenies of multiple nif genes could provide
new insight into N2 ﬁxation diversity and ecology.

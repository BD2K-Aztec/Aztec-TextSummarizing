Abstract

Motivation: Gene set analysis has revolutionized the interpretation of high-throughput transcrip-
tomic data. Nowadays, with comprehensive studies that measure multiple -omics from the same
sample, powerful tools for the integrative analysis of multi-omics datasets are required.

Results: Here, we present GeneTrai|2, a web service allowing the integrated analysis of transcrip-
tomic, miRNomic, genomic and proteomic datasets. It offers multiple statistical tests, a large num-
ber of predefined reference sets, as well as a comprehensive collection of biological categories and
enables direct comparisons between the computed results. We used GeneTrai|2 to explore patho-
genic mechanisms of Wilms tumors. We not only succeeded in revealing signaling cascades that
may contribute to the malignancy of blastemal subtype tumors but also identified potential bio-
markers for nephroblastoma with adverse prognosis. The presented use-case demonstrates that
GeneTrai|2 is well equipped for the integrative analysis of comprehensive -omics data and may
help to shed light on complex pathogenic mechanisms in cancer and other diseases.

1 Introduction

 

The advent of high-throughput analysis technologies during the
last decades has revolutionized biology and medicine and has lead to
a tremendous increase in the amount of available, high-dimensional bio-
logical data. However, technologies like microarrays, next-generation
sequencing or mass spectrometry are highly sensitive to changes in the
experimental conditions or protocols, giving rise to technological noise
that must be carefully accounted for (Leek et al., 2010). Due to the

above reasons, the development of automated and robust statistical ana-
lysis methods for high-throughput data has become a necessity.
Enrichment methods are one fundamental class of analysis procedures
for the study of pathogenic mechanisms and the identification of deregu-
lated pathways and categories. Widely-applied enrichment methods are
Over Representation Analysis (ORA) (Draghici et al., 2003) and Gene
Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) (Subramanian et al., 2005). Other
approaches, e.g. Kim and Volsky (2005), Newton et al. (2007), Tian

et al. (2005 ), employ straightforward averaging methods that, despite
their simplicity, offer competitive performance. Building upon such aver-
aging approaches, Efron and Tibshirani (2007) presented the maxmean
statistics. More specialized approaches, which complement the generally
applicable methods presented above, are e.g. topGO (Alexa et al., 2006)
and GO-Bayes (Zhang et al., 2010), which operate on the Gene
Ontology (GO) (Ashburner et al., 2000) and account for its hierarchical
structure. Another class of algorithms uses the topology of known bio-
logical networks to improve the computed enrichments. Examples are
GGEA (Geistlinger et al., 2011) and EnrichNet (Glaab et al., 2012).

Due to the popularity of enrichment methods, many implemen-
tations are available, both as stand-alone applications and as web
services. Some focus on a certain database while others are limited
to one or two algorithms (Fig. 1). Examples for available tools are
the Broad Institute’s GSEA implementation (Subramanian et al.,
2005) or the GSEA-SNP (Holden et al., 2008) R package. Also a
wide variety of web services for enrichment analysis exists, which
we discussed briefly in Supplementary Note 51. Moreover, a com-
prehensive collection of enrichment tools can be found in the
OMICtools database (Henry et al., 2014). Extensive reviews on en-
richment methods (Ackermann and Strimmer, 2009; Efron and
Tibshirani, 2007; Huang et al., 2009; Hung et al., 2011; Khatri
et al., 2012; Naeem et al., 2012) have been published and reveal
that no real gold standard exists. This is due to the fact that each of
the proposed methods is based on differing definitions of enriched
categories (differing null hypotheses), making their results incom-
parable in general. Instead of using a single ‘magic bullet’, an appro-
priate algorithm needs to be chosen carefully for each individual
research task.

Finally, as heterogenous datasets, e.g. datasets comprised of gen-
omic variations, miRNA and mRNA expression measurements,
are becoming increasingly common, integrative platforms for

Number of supported algorithms

Fig. 1. A comparison of selected enrichment tools. The number of supported
databases refers to the number of unique data sources from which categories
have been obtained. Databases are counted across all supported species and
-omics. The number of supported algorithms refers to the number of algo-
rithms offered for analysis. Related methods (e.g. network algorithms) have
been included. A tool was defined as supporting an -omics, if it provides dedi-
cated biological categories for this -omics type

enrichment analyses are needed. Unfortunately, only few such tools
are readily available. Examples are miRTrail (Laczny et al., 2012),
which links mRNA, miRNA and disease phentotypes, Genevar (Yang
et al., 2010), focusing on the association between SNPs and eQTLs,
or RAMONA using a Bayesian Model for linking arbitrary -omics to
ontology terms (Sass et al., 2014).

In this study, we present GeneTrail2, a new web server for the ana-
lysis of multi-omics datasets, with which we provide one of the most
comprehensive tools for enrichment analysis. For human alone, it fea-
tures over 46 000 categories collected from over 30 databases including
KEGG, Reactome, GO, WikiPathways, DrugBank, Pfam, miRWalk
and miRDB (cf. Supplementary Table 512). It natively supports tran-
scriptomics, miRNomics, proteomics, and genomics data and can con-
vert between 32 common identifier types. In total, we implemented 13
identifier-level statistics, 10 set-level statistics (see Section 2.3), two P-
value computation strategies and eight B—value adjustment methods.
Data from all major -omics are supported, making it possible to ana-
lyze and explore heterogeneous datasets in an interactive fashion using
GeneTrail2’s web interface. The web interface is built on top of mod-
ern web technologies with special attention to usability. Non-expert
users can quickly perform comprehensive analyses using the predefined
workﬂow, which is complemented with thorough documentation.
Moreover, the interface enables users to integrate enrichments obtained
from multiple -omics using the integrated mapping procedures and our
side-by-side view. For further analysis tasks, we offer a deep integration
into existing applications like the network visualization tool BiNA
(Gerasch et al., 2014) or the NetworkTrail (Stockel et al., 2013) web
service. Another key feature of GeneTrai12 is its RESTful API, through
which power users can script the web service. This scripting interface
allows the seamless integration of GeneTrai12 into workﬂow systems
such as Galaxy (Goecks et al., 2010) or Taverna (Wolstencroft et al.,
2013). The backend of GeneTrai12 relies on highly optimized C ++
code leading to excellent computation times. GeneTrai12 can be ac-
cessed under https://genetrai12.bioinf.uni-sb.de.

We demonstrate the capabilities of GeneTrai12 by applying it to a
Wilms tumor expression dataset with the goal of identifying molecu-
lar determinants for the increased malignancy of certain Wilms tumor
subtypes. Further use cases are discussed on the website.

2 Methods

Since GeneTrai12 is a comprehensive software platform comprising
more than 31 000 lines of code, we start with a short introduction
to the architecture of our web service. Then, we present an example
workﬂow serving as guide through the available functionality and
implemented methods.

2.1 Architecture

GeneTrai12 is a complete rewrite of its predecessor, the GeneTrail
(Backes et al., 2007) web service, with the goal to provide more,
readily available identifier- and set-level statistics and to greatly in-
crease its ﬂexibility. Furthermore, it supports user accounts and, for
increased reproducibility, fully automatic documentation of all used
parameters. To accommodate this, the new server is based on a
modular architecture (cf. Fig. 2) allowing to easily add new features,
exchange implementation details or perform general maintenance.
We implemented a user interface based on HTML5 and JavaEE
technology using the Thymeleaf template engine and JQuery. This
interface interacts with the web service using a RESTful API. This
API allows access to the complete functionality of GeneTrai12. It
offers interfaces for starting and managing computationally

brary we implemented a JAX-RS-based RESTful API. The frontend is based
on the Thymeleaf template engine and JOuery. As application server we use
Apache Tomcat

intensive analysis tasks as well as querying computed results.
Providing a RESTful API has the additional advantage that users
can write custom scripts in any programming language, e.g. for
batch processing.

All compute-intensive tasks were implemented using highly opti-
mized C ++ code in order to achieve maximum performance. This
code relies on the Boost library for the implementation of probabil-
ity distributions and auxiliary algorithms. Eigen 3 is used for ma-
trix—vector algebra and the GMP library provides multi precision
integer and floating point operations.

2.2 Workflow

GeneTrai12 offers a considerable number of analysis workflows
(Fig. 3). Due to space constraints, we only discuss one common
scenario. First, the user uploads the data to be analyzed, e.g. a ma-
trix containing normalized expression measurements. Then, the data
can be divided into sample and reference sets in order to enable the
computation of identifier-level scores. After score computation, a
set-level statistic must be selected. The user can then choose bio-
logical categories that should be analyzed.

For each step the user can adjust the parameters of the employed
method. As this usually requires considerable expert knowledge, we
provide defaults that should be applicable for most use-cases and
that have been chosen conservatively in order to prevent false
discoveries.

2.3 Method overview

GeneTrai12 accepts the following simple, tab-delimited text files as
inputs: identifier lists, score lists and data matrices. In addition, it is
possible to analyze microarray expression datasets from the Gene
Expression Omnibus repository (Barrett et al., 2013) directly.

2.3.1 Identifier and organism estimation

A key challenge when dealing with uploaded data is the automatic
detection of the identifiers used in the dataset. We solved this prob-
lem by creating a MapDB-based database of supported identifiers,
against which user data are validated. In addition, the database sup-
ports mapping between different identifier types such as UniProt
Accessions and Entrez Gene Ids. Coupled with automated file type
detection, no user intervention should be required when uploading
data.

2.3.2 Identifier-level statistics
Whereas identifier lists and score lists can be directly used as input
for computing enrichments, expression matrices need to be

Fig. 3. Simplified flowchart of GeneTrai|2. Round boxes depict start/end
states. Boxes with gray background represent input file types, whereas a
white background represents processing steps. Diamonds are decision nodes

processed to (identifier-level) scores first. To this end, we provide a
comprehensive set of statistics (see Supplementary Note 52.1).
Among these are the fold-change, Wilcoxon test and a (regularized)
version of the t-test. If possible and applicable, paired versions of the
statistics are provided. For supporting count data we integrated the
DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014), edgeR (Robinson et al., 2010) and
RUVSeq (Risso et al., 2014) approaches.

Simple transformations such as absolute value, square, square
root or logarithm can be applied to computed scores.

2.3.3 Set-level statistics and categories

Once the input data have been prepared, one of the following set-
level statistics can be applied: the weighted and unweighted
Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, the Wilcoxon test, ORA, sum-,
mean-, median- and maxmean statistics, as well as the one and two
sample t-test. After choosing an algorithm, the user can select cate-
gories for which an enrichment should be computed. The categories
integrated into GeneTrai12 were collected from many, commonly
used biological databases (cf. Supplementary Table S12). Among
others, these databases cover signaling pathways, genomic features,
transcription factor (TF) targets, miRNA targets, drug targets and
(disease) phenotypes. In addition, user-defined categories can be up-
loaded in gene matrix transposed (Subramanian et al., 2005 ) format.
For ORA, it is also required to select a reference (background) set.
For human alone, we offer over 40 predefined reference sets (see
Supplementary Tables 513—517) covering many experimental plat-
forms. If no applicable reference set is available, a custom set can be
uploaded.

2.3.4 P-value computation

For determining the significance levels of the computed set-level
scores, GeneTrai12 offers the gene set and the phenotype strategy.
While the gene set strategy is based on permuting the identifier-level
scores, the phenotype strategy randomly redistributes the measure-
ments between the sample and reference group. An advantage of the
gene set strategy is that it allows the direct computation of P-values
for some methods and thus avoids costly permutation tests (see

Supplementary Note 52.2). This leads to a higher resolution of the
computed P-values and very low computation times (see Section
2.4). For an in-depth discussion of the advantages and disadvantages
of the respective methods we refer the reader to Tian et al. (2005 ).
The phenotype strategy always requires that a permutation test is
performed. As new identifier-level scores must be derived for every
permutation, the method can only be used if a data matrix was
supplied.

Finally, a method for multiple testing correction must be chosen.
To this end, we provide a large set of correction methods (see
Supplementary Table 56) including the popular Benjamini—
Hochberg FDR adjustment (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995).

2.3.5 Examining computed results

Enrichments can be visualized online or downloaded as compressed
archives and MS Excel tables. When viewing an enrichment online,
we provide detailed statistics about significant categories and their
members, which are fully sort- and searchable. Besides the trad-
itional list of significant categories, we also offer an inverse enrich-
ment view, which for every gene displays the significant categories it
is a member of. In addition, the user can select a set of enrichments
that can be viewed side-by-side, providing a compact and clearly
arranged overview. This allows to quickly detect similarities and dif-
ferences with respect to the detected categories. Here, two view
modes are available. While the union mode displays all categories
that are significant in at least one enrichment, the intersection mode
only displays categories that are significant in all enrichments.
Whereas the union is useful for detecting variability between related
enrichments, the intersection can be used to reduce the number of
false positives by computing and comparing two or more enrich-
ments using different algorithms. Using these modes, the user is able
to effectively balance the sensitivity and specificity of an analysis in
a straightforward manner. Combining the side-by-side view with
GeneTrail2’s mapping features allows for an integrated analysis of
gene lists obtained from different -omics. For example, given tran-
scriptomics and proteomics data, protein abundance scores can be
mapped onto the corresponding genes allowing to compute enrich-
ments using gene categories for both score lists. Via the union mode
it is possible to spot similarities and differences between the enrich-
ments obtained from both -omics.

2.4 Performance

The performance of basic tools such as enrichment methods is crit-
ical, as good performance significantly shortens the development
cycles of data analysis workﬂows. To this end, GeneTrai12 uses a
C ++ implementation to guarantee optimal performance. In general,
the gene set strategy is one order of magnitude quicker to compute
than the phenotype strategy (see Table 1). The used set-level statis-
tics has little influence on the computation time. GeneTrai12 signifi-
cantly outperforms the Broad Institute GSEA application
(Subramanian et al., 2005 ) for both, the gene set and the phenotype
strategy.

3 Results

3.1 Case study: Wilms tumors

Wilms tumors (WTs), or nephroblastomas, are childhood renal
tumors. While in general WTs are associated with survival rates
>90%, some subtypes with much higher relapse rates are known
(Sredni et al., 2009). For proper risk-assessment and therapy

exact P-value computation method. Timings were obtained on an Intel Core
i7-3770 processor

stratification it is thus crucial to identify and understand the differ-
ences in the pathogenic processes between the tumor subtypes.

We used GeneTrai12 to analyze a WT expression dataset in order
to determine key players inﬂuencing the malignancy of WTs. The
dataset consists of 40 mRNA and 47 miRNA expression profiles
from 47 tumor biopsies from 39 patients, containing four healthy
tissue samples as well as 17 blastemal, nine mixed type and 17 mis-
cellaneous tumor samples (cf. Supplementary Section 53.1). As our
dataset stems from a study following the SIOP protocol, patients
underwent chemotherapy before surgery and sample collection.
Approximately 25% of initial blastemal predominant tumors do not
respond to preoperative chemotherapy and have a poor prognosis.
Hence, special attention was put on identifying factors leading to an
increased resistance to chemotherapy in this blastemal subtype,
which accounts for 10% of all WTs. In the following, we refer to
those tumors as blastemal tumors.

We describe the results of our WT analysis as a learning process
that was guided by the computed enrichments, simple statistical ana-
lyses and the study of literature. For a review of the implemented en-
richment algorithms, we refer the reader to the available, extensive
literature (Ackermann and Strimmer, 2009; Efron and Tibshirani,
2007; Huang et al., 2009; Hung et al., 2011; Khatri et al., 2012;
Naeem et al., 2012).

3.1.1 Consensus of enrichment approaches

We used GeneTrai12 to examine the differences between blastemal
and non-blastemal tumors using the independent shrinkage t-test
(Opgen-Rhein and Strimmer, 2007) to compute scores for all genes
and miRNAs (see Supplementary Note 53.5). For P-value computa-
tion the gene set strategy with Benjamini—Hochberg adjustment was
chosen. In order to compare the implemented set-level statistics
based on our data, we applied all available set-level statistics exclud-
ing ORA to the score lists. The resulting enrichments are given in
Supplementary Tables 518 and 519 and under https://genetrai12.bio
inf.uni-sb.de/results.htmlPsession=a9e84e92-ea41-42ab-9ee7—
c0f8515f9234. We observed that, despite a considerable overlap,
the differences between the enrichments are substantial (cf.
Supplementary Fig. 51). For example, while the union of all enrich-
ments contains 1436 GO-Biological Process categories, only 343
categories are contained in their intersection. As expected, this effect
is especially pronounced for databases containing categories close to
the significance level, which may indicate that these categories were
only reported due to idiosyncrasies of the corresponding method.

The number of significant categories per method can be found in
Table 2.

In order to focus on highly relevant processes, we only consider
categories consistently reported by at least seven of nine set-level
statistics, which can be easily achieved using our comparative en-
richment view. Further discussion only considers this intersection.

3. 1 .2 General observations

For mRNA the upregulation of categories like mRNA Processing,
Cell Cycle and DNA Replication suggest a clear increase in mitotic
activity in blastemal tumors. For miRNA, categories associated with
various cancer types, including HMDD-renal cell carcinoma, are
significantly enriched. The same is true for miRNA categories
involved in hormone regulation, immune response, apoptosis and
tumor suppression. None of the miRNA families is significant in all
enrichments; however, the families miR-302, miR-515, miR-30,
miR-17 and let-7 are significant for at least seven out of nine tests.
The miR-302 and miR-515 families are associated with the activa-
tion of the canonical WNT pathway (Anton et al., 2011). In add-
ition, the miR-17 family is known for its oncogenic role in cancer
and stem cell development (Mogilyansky and Rigoutsos, 2013).

3.1.3 Deregulation of let-7 via LINZSB and TRIM71

The let-7 miRNA family has previously been reported to play a vital
role in WT suppression (Urbach et al., 2014). However, many high
abundant family members are upregulated (see Supplementary Table
53), which is unexpected due to let-7 miRNAs acting as tumor sup-
pressors. A possible explanation for this behavior may be provided by
TRIM71, which is among the top-scoring genes. TRIM71 degrades
LIN28B via ubiquitin—mediated proteosomal degradation (Lee et al.,
2014) (cf. Fig. 4). LIN28B in turn suppresses the maturation of pri-
let—7 miRNA. Hence, the upregulation of TRIM71 induces an upregu-
lation of the let-7 family, which, in theory, promotes cell differenti-
ation. However, Chang et al. (2012) found that TRIM71 can
promote rapid embryonic stem cell (ESC) proliferation in mice and re-
port that it represses the expression of CDKN1A, a cyclin-dependent
kinase inhibitor, which acts as a cell-cycle regulator. As high expres-
sion levels of TRIM71 are commonly observed in undifferentiated
cells, the authors conclude that TRIM71 is an important factor for
maintaining proliferation in stem cells. Urbach et al. (2014) report
that LIN28B is able to induce WTs under certain conditions and note
that in these tumors the cap mesenchymal (CM) specific stem cell
markers CITED1, EYA1 and SIX2 are upregulated. In general, this
trend is present in our data, however, we find that the marker’s ex-
pression is more consistent with TRIM71’s expression pattern (Fig. 5
and Supplementary Fig. 52). In summary, our initial results indicate
that miRNA and genes associated with stem cell fate play an essential
role in blastemal tumors.

3.1.4 Activation of cancer-related WNT signaling
Deregulation of the WNT signaling pathway is often prevalent in
cancer samples (Polakis, 2012). Indeed, our enrichment analysis

2011), which promote cell differentiation and act on TRIM71 and LIN28B via a
negative feedback loop (Marson et al., 2008). TRIM71 as well as AG02 in com-
plex with miR-290/302 miRNAs repress CDKN1A expression leading to
increased proliferation (Lee et al., 2014). TCF3 acts on most of the above play-
ers (Marson et al., 2008), effectively amplifying the currently predominant sig-

(FA), diffuse anaplasia (DA) and blastemal. The size of a colored bar repre-
sents the absolute expression strength of the associated gene

contains categories associated with the WNT pathway (see
Supplementary Table 55). This is consistent with its previously re-
ported central role in most WTs and especially in blastema-rich
WTs (Fukuzawa et al., 2009). The activation of the canonical
WNT pathway usually leads to degradation of the destruction
complex that, as long as it is functional, degrades the transcrip-
tional coactivator ﬁ-catenin. Thus, degradation of the destruction
complex leads to higher amounts of ﬁ-catenin in the cytoplasm
that is transported to the nucleus where it builds complexes with
TCF/LEF proteins. Degradation of the destruction complex lies at

3.1.5 TCF3 as potential WT master regulator

We argued that factors associated with stem cell fate and the canon-
ical WNT pathway play an essential role in blastemal tumors. A
well-known link between the WNT pathway and the core regulatory

circuitry of ESCs is TCF3 that together with the pluripotency factors
OCT4 (POU5F1), NANOG and SOX2 builds the set of ‘ESC master
regulators’ (Cole et al., 2008). If the WNT pathway is inactive,
TCF3 is mainly repressing pluripotency factors and promoting dif-
ferentiation, however, if the WNT pathway is activated, the repres-
sive complex converts to an activating complex, promoting
pluripotency (Cole et al., 2008). To study the influence of E5C mas-
ter regulators, we constructed a new set of gene categories that we
subjected to the K5 test using the blastemal versus non-blastemal
scores as input. For each of the four transcription factors (TFs), we
defined two categories containing genes for which ‘strong evidence’
exists that they are regulated by the respective TF. In particular, we
add a gene to a category for a TF if the TF occupies a site in the
gene’s promoter region and the correlation between the TF’s and the
gene’s expression is >0.5 (positive category) or smaller than —0.5
(negative category). For the identification of the promoters occupied
by the master regulators, we used the mouse E5C ChIP-Chip dataset
of Cole et al. (2008) and the ChIP-Seq data set of Marson et al.
(2008). Using this procedure, we obtained more than 1500 genes,
including many other TFs and genes involved in E5C fate, inﬂuenced
by mainly TCF3 and OCT4. For a selection, see Supplementary
Table 54. Our K5 enrichment (Supplementary Table 520, https://
genetrai12.bioinf.uni-sb.de/results.htmlPsession=cbc86903-4248-
47a2-b916-bc682924c242) revealed that genes positively regulated
by TCF3 (p z 1040) and NANOG (p x 10‘”) are strongly en-
riched, whereas genes negatively regulated by TCF3 (p z 1040) are
strongly depleted. Conversely, genes positively regulated by OCT4
are strongly depleted, and genes negatively regulated by OCT4 are
strongly enriched. This is consistent with a correlation of TCF3 with
OCT4 of —0.7. SOX2 and NANOG both seem to be of lesser im-
portance in our data.

However, the four master regulators do not only regulate protein
coding genes. Marson et al. (2008) revealed that they are also ‘asso-
ciated with promoters for miRNAs that are preferentially expressed
in ESCs’. Examples are the miR-302, miR-515 and let-7 families
which we previously discussed (cf. Fig. 4). In addition, our data indi-
cate that TCF3 regulates the expression of the miR-17 cluster (all
correlations >0.5).

3.1.6 IGF2 as putative WNT activator

In the above section, we have outlined how the ESC regulatory cir-
cuitry is driven by TCF3 through the WNT pathway. However, the
mechanisms that activate WNT signaling still remain unclear.
Whereas certain genetic mutations occur with relatively low fre-
quency (S 30%), among them genes that may induce WNT signal-
ing, epigenetic lesions and especially loss of imprinting at the IGF2/
H19 locus have been found for 81% of all blastemal subtype WTs
(Wegert et al., 2015) leading to an overexpression of IGF2. In 2001,
Morali et al. (2001) showed that IGF2 can induce the expression
and import of ﬁ-catenin and TCF3 into the nucleus even in the ab-
sence of WNT proteins. This triggers a switchover from the epithe-
lial to mesenchymal cell state, which is in accordance with the
expression patterns of the CM stem cell markers shown in Figure 5.
In addition, TCF3 binding sites have been found in the IGF2 gene
(Cole et al., 2008). Remarkably, we observe an extreme correlation
of 0.9 between the TCF3 and IGF2 expression (see Supplementary
Fig. 53). This suggests that TCF3 in turn regulates IGF2 leading to a
self-sustaining feedback loop which is likely to be causal for the
stem cell character of, e.g. blastemal tumors.

4 Discussion

We presented GeneTrai12, a platform for the enrichment analysis of
multi-omics datasets. GeneTrai12 was designed to offer users a max-
imal amount of ﬂexibility while keeping the common workflow ac-
cessible to non-expert users. This is achieved by offering a user
friendly, well-documented web interface. In turn, scripting capabil-
ities allow expert users to conduct fully automated large-scale ana-
lyses and the integration into third-party applications. To further
this ﬂexibility, we provide, to the best of our knowledge, the largest
number of enrichment algorithms (Fig. 1) available in a web service.
This was motivated by the lack of gold standards for enrichment
analysis and enables researchers to choose the appropriate tool for
the task at hand. Through our comparative enrichment view, we
additionally offer a straightforward way for balancing the sensitivity
and specificity of analyses. Furthermore, we integrated an extensive
collection of biological databases allowing to choose appropriate
prior knowledge for a research task. Owing to today’s capabilities
and ubiquity of high-throughput measurement techniques, we im-
plemented support for the analysis of multi-omics datasets.
Moreover, the modular structure of GeneTrai12 ensures that new al-
gorithms, databases, organisms and identifiers can easily be added.
This allows to track the current state-of—the-art and continuously
improve GeneTrai12.

We demonstrated GeneTrail2’s capabilities by applying it to a
Wilms tumor mRNA/miRNA expression dataset. Here, the major
goal was to determine key molecular features that result in lower
susceptibility to preoperative chemotherapy of blastemal subtype
tumors. We were able to identify a substantial amount of highly sig-
nificant, cancer-associated categories that were deregulated in this
subtype. The unusual expression profiles of the let-7 miRNA family
lead to LIN28B, which is well studied in the context of WTs, and in
turn to its upstream regulator TRIM71. We discussed the role of
TRIM71 and in particular its function as a stem cell regulator and
we observed that its expression is consistent with the expression of
the CM stem cell markers EYA1, SIX2 and CITED1 (Fig. 5). These
first results indicated that stem cell regulators play a central role in
blastemal tumors. This is in agreement with the assumption that the
ability of WT cells to maintain stem cell character is a main deter-
minant for tumor malignancy. Furthermore, our results revealed an
upregulation of the canonical WNT pathway. Searching for a link
between WNT signaling and the regulatory circuitry of stem cells,
we arrived at the TF TCF3. To examine possible effects of a TCF3
deregulation, we searched for factors inﬂuenced by TCF3. We found
a large number of genes, including well-known oncogenes, with
TCF3 binding sites in their promoters and exceptionally high correl-
ations with TCF3 expression. Interestingly, IGF2 belongs to this
group of genes suggesting that TCF3 regulates IGF2. Loss of im-
printing at the H19/IGF2 locus is with an extreme rate of occurrence
of 80% the most abundant epigenetic lesion in WTs and leads to an
IGF2 overexpression that can activate the canonical WNT pathway
and, hence, trigger the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT).
Our findings indicate that the resulting TCF3 activation closes a
self-sustaining feedback loop further boosting IGF2 production.
This offers a potential explanation on how malignant tumor cells
maintain their stem cell character. The genes discussed above clearly
separate WTs according to tumor malignancy and may hence be
promising candidates for prognostic biomarkers that may also be
valuable for therapy stratification.

The presented use case shows that GeneTrai12 is able to uncover
biologically informative signals in -omics data making it an import-
ant tool for the elucidation of pathogenic processes. The ability to

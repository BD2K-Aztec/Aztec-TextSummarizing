ABSTRACT

Motivation: Automated annotation of neuroanatomical connectivity
statements from the neuroscience literature would enable accessible
and large-scale connectivity resources. Unfortunately, the connectivity
findings are not formally encoded and occur as natural language text.
This hinders aggregation, indexing, searching and integration of the
reports. We annotated a set of 1377 abstracts for connectivity rela-
tions to facilitate automated extraction of connectivity relationships
from neuroscience literature. We tested several baseline measures
based on co-occurrence and lexical rules. We compare results from
seven machine learning methods adapted from the protein interaction
extraction domain that employ part-of-speech, dependency and
syntax features.

Results: Co—occurrence based methods provided high recall with
weak precision. The shallow linguistic kernel recalled 70.1% of the
sentence-level connectivity statements at 50.3% precision. Owing to
its speed and simplicity, we applied the shallow linguistic kernel to a
large set of new abstracts. To evaluate the results, we compared 2688
extracted connections with the Brain Architecture Management
System (an existing database of rat connectivity). The extracted con-
nections were connected in the Brain Architecture Management
System at a rate of 63.5%, compared with 51.1% for co—occurring
brain region pairs. We found that precision increases with the recency
and frequency of the extracted relationships.

1 INTRODUCTION

The brain is a vast interconnected network. Each neuron com-
municates with many others through chemical and electrical syn-
apses to integrate information. Groups of neurons (in structures
such as nuclei or layers) make diverse connections across the
brain, forming pathways of information ﬂow. This structural
connectivity is a major determinant of brain function and is

frequently used by neuroscientists and clinicians to interpret
physiological data. Examples include understanding strokes
(Haines, 2004) and interpreting brain imaging results. Evidence
for connectivity abnormalities has been found in bipolar
(Houenou et al., 2007), autism (Koshino et al., 2005),
Alzheimer’s (Stam et al., 2007) and schizophrenia patients
(Karlsgodt et al., 2008). A major goal of modern neuroscience
is to understand the organization of the brain at all levels in as
much detail as possible, and to understand how this networked
organization relates to brain function and ultimately behaviour
and human health (Sporns, 2011).

The characterization of the connectivity network or wiring
diagram of the brain is incomplete (Crick and Jones, 1993).
In part this is due to the complexity of the brain and the difﬁculty
in collecting data. However, we suggest that informatics technol-
ogies can be used to leverage existing knowledge that has already
been collected to make new discoveries and guide further
experimentation.

In this work, we are primarily concerned with ‘macroconnec-
tions’, or connections that can be identiﬁed between small brain
regions (as opposed to microcircuitry, which describes the con-
nections among neurons per se). These macroconnections be-
tween groups of neurons are predicted to number between
25 000 and 100 000 (Bota et al., 2003). This suggests a high
level of complexity, although comfortably placed between the
more gross levels of brain organization and the microarchitec-
ture, which encompasses billions of neurons and quadrillions of
synapses (Sporns et al., 2005). Furthermore, this estimated
number of macroconnections is smaller in scale than estimates
of the human protein interactome at 650 000 interactions among
25 000 proteins (Stumpf et al., 2008).

Connectivity between brain regions can be assayed using tract
tracing or electrophysiology. Tract tracing typically involves
injecting a dye or other tracer (e.g. horseradish peroxidase)
into one brain region and tracking the fate of the tracer as it
follows axonal pathways (Lanciego and Wouterlood, 2011).
Electrophysiological methods use electrical or other stimulation
in one site along with electrical recording at a second site to test
the functional connectivity of regions. Using these methods, a
researcher can determine connections that send signals to the
region (afferent) or away from the region (efferent). Over
many years, thousands of connectivity studies have been per-
formed, each of which typically elucidates, at most, a few con-
nections. The presence of a deep literature on neuronal

connectivity is a major motivation for this work: the data are out
there, they just need to be assembled.

Attempts to turn this huge accumulation of knowledge into an
‘omics’ scale database have been limited, despite the potential
value of such a resource. Previous efforts have primarily used
manual reviews of the literature to laboriously generate connect-
ivity maps for limited parts of the brain. In 1991, F elleman and
Van Essen published a connectivity matrix of the macaque visual
cortex covering 305 pathways between 32 areas (Felleman and
Van Essen, 1991). Currently, a large number of collated connec-
tions are stored in the Collations of Connectivity data on the
Macaque brain database (CoCoMac) (Kotter, 2004). CoCoMac
contains detailed information from 413 literature reports regard-
ing 7007 macaque brain regions. A fourth model organism with
large-scale connectivity data is the rat, with more than 40 000
formalized reports of connections in the Brain Architecture
Management System (BAMS) (Bota et al., 2005). Information
is added to these databases manually, and therefore, they
are accurate but sparse. Currently, the only complete connec-
tome scale database is the neuron-level wiring diagram of
Caenorhabditis elegans, determined from electron micrographs
White et al., 1986).

We sought to extend and complement manual efforts with
automated text mining techniques. More than 10 years of efforts
to recognize gene and protein mentions and their interactions
inspire our work (Blaschke et al., 1999; Jensen et al., 2006). In
the gene interaction task, one must extract information from
sentences such as ‘gene A interacts with gene B’ (to give a toy
example). Despite the difﬁculty of this task, great progress has
been made. A comprehensive evaluation of kernel methods for
extracting protein—protein interactions detailed precision and
recall values ranging from 45 to 70% by varying experiment
design, dataset and method tested (Tikk et al., 2010). At the
second Critical Assessment of Information Extraction systems
in Biology (BioCreAtIvE II), the top team was able to extract
normalized directed interaction pairs from full-text articles, with
precision of 37% and recall of 33% (Krallinger et al., 2008). The
analogy to brain connectivity is tight: we wish to extract infor-
mation from sentences akin to ‘brain region A connects to brain
region B’. This related research gives us hope that the approaches
applied to extracting gene interaction information can success-
fully mine connectivity relations.

To our knowledge, there have been no previous attempts to
extract connectivity information using text mining methods. The
closest work to our own is that of Burns et al. (2007), which was
aimed at extracting information about tract-tracing experiments,
trained and evaluated with a manually annotated corpus of 1047
sentences from 21 documents. Although Burns et al. describe
named entity recognition (e.g. identiﬁcation of label injection
sites), they did not report extraction of connectivity statements
themselves.

For the work presented here, we have simpliﬁed the problem
by limiting our input dataset and output results. We focus on
abstracts from one journal, the Journal of Comparative
Neurology (JCN), because it is enriched for tract-tracing studies.
We used abstracts rather than full-text documents because they
are enriched for high-level summary statements and are more
accessible. We also break our task into several subtasks, isolating
the steps of brain region term recognition and normalization

from the evaluations (French at al., 2009; French and Pavlidis,
2011). We only consider the presence of connectivity relations,
ignoring the type, strength or direction of the connection. These
limitations make the task simpler and set the stage for future
more detailed studies.

Our results show that text mining approaches previously used
to analyse protein networks can be usefully applied to brain
connectivity. Our large manually annotated corpus allowed test-
ing and training of various techniques possible, and we also per-
form extensive manual validation of the results. Beyond the
corpus-based evaluations, we compared a large set of automat-
ically extracted connectivity statements with an existing connect-
ivity database with favourable results. Together with our
previous work on term recognition and normalization, we pre-
sent a completely automated system for extraction of brain con-
nectivity information from abstracts.

2 METHODS
2.1 Annotated data

To train and test text mining algorithms, we created a large gold standard
dataset. This dataset or corpus consists of abstracts manually annotated
by an undergraduate research assistant (S.L.) for connection verbs, spe-
cies of study, brain region mentions and connections between them. We
annotated 1377 abstracts for 4276 connections and 17 585 brain region
mentions. Abstracts were randomly chosen from the J CN (years 1975—
2008). This dataset has been previously used to demonstrate automated
brain region recognition and normalization (French at al., 2009; French
and Pavlidis, 2011), without using the connectivity annotations. Each
annotated connection consists of two brain regions, text describing the
connection and the associated organism. This corpus provides sufﬁcient
training examples for machine-learning methods.

We developed guidelines and software for the annotation process.
Brieﬂy, our main guidelines were as follows: (1) annotate all brain
region mentions, regardless of whether they are part of a connection;
(2) annotate all connections and brain regions for all organisms and or-
ganism states; (3) do not annotate mentions of white matter tracts or
nerves; and (4) only annotate monosynaptic or direct connections. We
accepted connections that were stated in titles or introductory sentences
that assume connections between two high-level regions. Example rela-
tionships that were rejected are ‘may be connected’, ‘inﬂuences’, ‘invaded’
and ‘alters activity’. The General Architecture for Text Engineering was
used by annotators to highlight and connect brain region mentions in text
(Cunningham et al., 2002).

2.2 Co-occurrence and rule-based methods

To extract neuroanatomical connections as described by the abstract au-
thors, we must at least link two brain region mentions. Our ﬁrst method,
acting as a naive baseline method, predicts a stated connection between
every pair of brain region mentions (Jensen et al., 2006). We evaluate
co-occurrence for single sentences and entire abstracts (including title).

We created two simple rule-based extensions of the co-occurrence tech-
nique. The ﬁrst simply limits co-occurrence extraction to sentences with
less than a set number of brain region mentions. The second requires
presence of a connectivity-related keyword (‘afferent’, ‘efferent’, ‘pro-
jects’, ‘projection’, ‘pathway’ or ‘inputs’).

2.3 Kernel-based methods

Seven advanced kernel-based methods were applied to the dataset. These
methods were originally designed for extraction of protein—protein inter-
actions. Each technique uses different features, parameters and kernel

functions. Implementations were brought into a common evaluation
framework by Tikk and colleagues (Tikk et al., 2010). Syntax and de-
pendency trees for the sentences were computed by the Charniak-Lease
re-ranking (McClosky et al., 2006) and Stanford (De Mameffe et al.,
2006) parsers, respectively (same versions used in the Tikk et al. frame-
work). The methods are categorized according to the type of features
extracted. Four syntax tree-based methods use different techniques to
compare the sentence parse trees (Collins and Duffy, 2001; Kuboyama
et al., 2007; Moschitti, 2005; Vishwanathan and Smola, 2002). Going
beyond syntax parsers, the all-paths graph kernel (Airola et al., 2008)
and k-band shortest path spectrum kernel (Tikk et al., 2010) use depend-
ency parse information. Finally, the shallow linguistic kernel (SLK) uses
only shallow parsing information such as word occurrences and
part-of—speech tags (Giuliano et al., 2006). Further details about the ker-
nels are available on the supplement website. We used this framework to
benchmark each of the kernel-based methods on the brain region con-
nectivity task. Of the nine methods described by Tikk et al., we were able
to successfully test seven, including the three top-performing kernels re-
ported by Tikk et al. (2010). The same parameter sets used by Tikk and
colleagues were tested on our corpus.

2.4 Experiment setup

We evaluate connection extraction independently of the previously
described methods for automated brain region recognition (French
at al., 2009). This is done by providing the manually annotated brain
region mentions to the relation extraction algorithm. Under this design,
the extraction task only requires correct linking of brain region mentions.
To ﬁnd a high-performing method, the different methods and varying
parameters were run on a subset of 1146 abstracts. The top-performing
classiﬁer and parameter set were retested on the full set of 1377 abstracts
to gauge generalizability. Results for the kernel methods were computed
using 10-fold cross-validation. Each sentence became an input instance
for the kernel methods (including article title). Sentences of an abstract
were not split between training and testing sets (document-level split).

2.5 Evaluation

Several evaluations were performed to judge the accuracy of the extracted
connectivity statements. We primarily report the results from the
cross-validation experiments that test predictions against the manually
annotated connections. Detailed evaluation and annotation guidelines
are provided as Supplementary Materials.

Performance is measured against the number of true connectivity re-
lations that are annotated completely within a sentence or an abstract.
The rule- and co-occurrence-based methods can operate at the abstract or
sentence level, whereas the kernel methods are limited to single sentences.
Precision is computed as the proportion of predicted relations that are
correct, and recall is the proportion of true relations that are predicted by
the method. The f—measure is the harmonic mean of these two values,
providing a balance of both. We also compute the area under the receiver
operating curve where applicable (AUC). This measure uses a ranked list
of predictions with descending classiﬁcation prediction scores that ap-
proximate conﬁdence in the prediction. This ranking allows computation
of the true-positive and false-positive rates for a range of discrimination
thresholds. Previous experiments have found the AUC measure to be
more robust and stable than f—measure for interaction mining (Tikk
et al., 2010).

2.6 Comparison with existing connectivity database

Normalization of brain region mentions to brain region concepts in for-
malized lexicons was targeted to the BAMS atlas (Swanson, 1999).
BAMS was chosen because of its wealth of curated rat-tract-tracing stu-
dies (Bota et al., 2005). In addition, rat is the most commonly studied

species in our corpus. Our previously described Bag of Stems resolver was
applied, with all mention editors used, including those that map region
mentions to larger enclosing brain regions (French and Pavlidis, 2011).
The lexical information in BAMS was expanded with synonym informa-
tion to increase normalization performance. All possible normalized par-
ings are evaluated when a mention maps to more than one region.
Connections in the BAMS connectivity matrices were up—propagated in
the anatomy hierarchy, which ensures that if there is a connection be-
tween regions A and B, then all enclosing regions of A and B are also
connected. Self-connections extracted from literature were ignored. The
Linnaeus species tagger was used to recognize species names in the ab-
stracts (Gemer et al., 2010).

3 RESULTS

Our gold standard is a set of manually annotated 4276 brain
region connectivity relations across a corpus of 1377 abstracts.
To gauge interannotator agreement, a second curator (L.X.)
annotated a random subset of 231 documents. Roughly 80%
of the second curator’s annotations matched the primary curator
(79.5% recall at 82.3% precision). Unlike the automated meth-
ods that predict relations between given brain region mention
spans, this evaluation required both annotators to mark the
same spans and relationships. By removing this restriction and
allowing partially matching spans, the precision and recall reach
93.9% and 91.9%, respectively.

We used a co-occurrence analysis to reveal the proportion of
brain region mention pairs that are co-mentioned and described
as connected. Co-occurrence assumes the relation is a connect-
ivity statement. At the abstract level, this yields a precision of
only 2.2% at 100% recall and a f-measure of 4.3%. Within a
sentence, co-occurrences between all pairs predict connected
pairs at 13.3% precision and 72.4% recall (the remaining rela-
tions span sentences). This level of recall means that more than
1A of all annotated connectivity relations are formed with regions
in different sentences. Owing to the difﬁculty in extracting con-
nections spanning sentences, all of our subsequent evaluations
are performed at the sentence level, with the relations spanning
sentences excluded. Under this evaluation framework, sentence-
level co-occurrence recalls 100% of the remaining 3097 relations.

We tested two simple modiﬁcations of the sentence-level
co-occurrence technique. The ﬁrst reduces co-occurrence predic-
tions to sentences with a limited number of brain region men-
tions. By extracting co-occurring pairs from sentences with only
two brain region mentions, precision reaches 23.1% and 17.2%
recall (f-measure = 19.7%). This means that an average sentence
with two brain region mentions is reporting a connection in
almost one of four cases. By varying this threshold, the f-measure
increases until sentences with six or more brain region mentions
are included. We observed that some of these larger sentences
merely list brain regions involved in the study and not their re-
lationships. By limiting the threshold at ﬁve brain region men-
tions or less per sentence, co-occurrence provides 18.8%
precision and 66.1% recall (Table 1). The second rule tested re-
quires the sentences contain connectivity—related keywords (see
Methods section). This keyword-based rule increases recall to
17.4% and precision to 92.7% (f-measure = 29.4%). We created
a new approach named ‘Keyword 5-threshold’ by combining
these two rules. This again provides improvement, with
f-measure reaching 34.1%. As expected, rule-based methods

increase precision at the cost of lower recall when compared with
unrestricted co-occurrence.

Next, we applied seven previously published methods for ex-
tracting protein—protein interactions to our connectivity relation
dataset. Although the methods were designed for a different type
of biomedical relation, they did not require any modiﬁcation for
our application. The cross-validation results on the training data-
set (1146 abstracts) are provided in Table 1. For each method,
the parameter set with the highest AUC score is shown. The
parameter sets range in size and were reproduced from Tikk
et al. without modiﬁcation (primarily grid searches of support
vector machine settings). The f-measure scores for all of the seven
methods outperform unrestricted co-occurrence—based analysis
for at least one parameter set. The simple rule-based methods
outperform the more complex partial tree- and subset tree-based
methods. Although all of the syntax tree-based methods are out-
performed by the Keyword 5-threshold approach, they provide
much higher precision than recall. When ranked by AUC, the
SLK performs best with a 58.3% f-measure and an AUC of
88.9%. The All Paths Graph and k-band shortest path spectrum
kernel methods rank a close second and third, respectively, with
similar scores.

We choose the SLK method for subsequent experiments
owing to its accuracy, speed and single parameter set (global
n-gram = 3 and local window 2 2). Unlike the other kernel meth-
ods, the SLK method uses only shallow linguistic information at
the local (neighbouring words) and global sentence levels to pre-
dict relationships (Giuliano et al., 2006). This information forms
feature vectors that are used to train a support vector machine
classiﬁer (scalar product kernel). The performance of SLK on the
complete set of 1377 abstracts is consistent with the
cross-validation results (f-measure of 0.592). Figure S1 displays
the resulting receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve
(AUC = 0.899).

We applied the SLK classiﬁer to candidate sentences extracted
from a set of 12557 abstracts from the JCN (covering 1975—
2011), previously unseen by the algorithm. Our automatic
brain region recognizer provided 33 466 sentences that mention
two or more brain regions (French at al., 2009; French and
Pavlidis, 2011). Within these sentences, SLK predicted 18% of

relationships.

To evaluate the precision of the predicted connections, we
manually reviewed a random subset of 2000 abstracts. Each
pair was evaluated by two curators, yielding an interannotator
agreement rate of 85%. Conﬂicts were resolved by a third cur-
ator or by consensus after discussion. Overall, the SLK predic-
tions were 55.3% precise. Errors from the automated steps
of named entity recognition and abbreviation expansion were
11% and 4%, respectively. These rates suggest a lesser impact

of named entity recognition errors when compared with assess-
ments in the protein—protein interaction domain (Kabiljo et al.,
2009). Table 2 presents the ﬁve most and least conﬁdent con-
nectivity relations for the rat brain. Classiﬁcation conﬁdence is
approximated with the SLK prediction score (distance to clas-
sifying hyperplane), with highest values representing the cases
closest to positive training examples. Two of the most conﬁdent
predictions are extracted from an article title and have the same
form (ranks 1 and 5). The sentences containing top predictions
are shorter on average (192 characters) than the sentences with
least conﬁdent predictions (282 characters), suggesting sentence
complexity affects the prediction results. Of these 10 examples,
only one is clearly a false-positive prediction (rank 9764), while
several others point to errors in previous automated steps. The
mentions of ‘internal capsule’ (rank 9766) and ‘Met-enkephalin’
(rank 4) are incorrectly predicted as brain region mentions (our
deﬁnition of a brain region excludes ﬁbre tracts like the internal
capsule, while enkephalin is a peptide). We manually compared
these 10 results with the BAMS system and found it surprisingly
difﬁcult to map the mentioned regions to those in BAMS. For

example, ‘retrosplenial dysgranular cortex’ and ‘dorsal medullary
reticular column’ were not found in BAMS. In the end, corres-
ponding connections were found in BAMS for several of the
relationships, but only between enclosing regions (ranks 9767
and 5).

Encouraged by these results, we did a comparison of the re-
sults from the 12 557 abstracts with BAMS, to gauge accuracy of
connections and the extent to which our approach might supple-
ment manual curation efforts. Compared with the manual anno-
tations, this is a less precise evaluation because BAMS does not
cover the complete literature and is limited to rat studies (Bota
et al., 2005). In addition, mapping errors resulting from linking
brain region mentions to target regions in BAMS reduces accur-
acy (French and Pavlidis, 2011). For example, 12% of mentions
are mapped to more than one brain region owing to ambiguous
synonyms. To benchmark the BAMS evaluation metric, we ﬁrst
tested it on the manually curated connectivity relations from our
training corpus of 1377 abstracts. Our process ﬁrst extracts ab-
stracts that used rat (based on Linneaus analysis) and maps the
brain region mentions to the BAMS lexicon. These rat

This table presents the analysis of the extracted binary connectivity matrices. The ﬁrst two rows are from connectivity matrices derived from the 1377 annotated abstract set.
The remaining rows are from the 12 557 abstract set and are split between the SLK predictions and the co—occurrence technique. The threshold column displays the required
count of reported connections to be marked as connected in the matrix. Anatomical depth measures how speciﬁc the connections are by averaging the number of enclosing

brain regions for each connected region.

connectivity relationships were then compared with the BAMS
connectivity matrix. Only 167 manually annotated connectivity
relations were testable by this method, with 70.5% having a con-
nection in BAMS. In the same set of abstracts, the 2617 brain
region pairings not annotated as connections but co-occur in
sentences are connected in BAMS at 49.8%. This is not surpris-
ing because co-occurring regions may be connected, but the
author is not stating that in the sentence. In the larger set of
rat-related abstracts, 2688 computationally predicted connectiv-
ity statements are successfully resolved, and 63.5% are, in fact,
reported as true by BAMS (Fig. 1). For comparison, the remain-
ing set of co-occurring brain region pairs is connected in BAMS
at a rate of 51.1%. We noted that the extracted relationships are
between larger or less speciﬁc brain regions than those in BAMS.
Anatomical depth, or the average number of enclosing or parent
brain regions for a connected pair in the BAMS matrix, is 9.6,
whereas the literature-extracted connections had a mean of 7.9,
indicating they are larger and less speciﬁc brain regions. Along
the same lines, the literature-based relationships only involve 433
regions, whereas BAMS has connection reports for 633 regions.
We evaluated the 899 connections that are predicted by our
method but not listed as connected in BAMS (provided in
Supplement). Similar to the previous evaluation of 2000 connec-
tions, approximately one-half of these connections are false-
positive text mining errors (52.1% precision). The remaining
468 connections that are true positives at the sentence level
could be used to expand BAMS coverage (although curation
guidelines differ). Within these 468 true positives, we selected a
subset of 250 for further review by a domain expert (C. Krebs).
Only nine of the predicted connections were rejected (3.6%). Five
were rejected because a protein (pituitary adenylate cyclise—
activating polypeptide) was incorrectly recognized as a brain
region (pituitary gland). This agreement between the curators
and an expert suggests our annotation guidelines are consistent
and accurate.

We hypothesized that owing to improvements in tracing meth-
ods, more recent reports of connectivity would be of higher qual-
ity. This was suggested by a study of different eras of
tract-tracing techniques that revealed large improvements in

accuracy (Bota et al., 2003). Bota and colleagues found that
limbic system connections observed using an old method, axon
degeneration (Nauta, 1952), are 60% accurate. In contrast,
methods ﬁrst applied in 1987 to exploit axonal transport are
much more accurate with more than 90% considered valid. By
splitting our corpus into documents published before and after
1987, we tested for a similar signal that separates eras of experi-
mental techniques. In agreement with the manually quantiﬁed
trend, we observe an increase from 59.4 to 65.6% in the rate of
connectivity statements validated in BAMS (P = 0.00071, hyper-
geometric test). We note the speciﬁcity of regions involved in the
connections also increases, whereas the proportion of mapped
terms is unchanged.

Connections predicted more than once might be more likely to
be valid because of the effect of ‘conﬁrmation’. This was feasible
to study because, on average, each connection was predicted
more than twice. The number of extracted connections per
brain region (degree) provides a simple comparison with
BAMS. For the 344 common brain regions, the degree vectors
are strongly correlated (Pearson=0.769, Spearman=0.433).
Counting unique predicted connections, 54.7% are in BAMS
(Table 3, the value of 63.5% previously cited counts occur-
rences). From a recall perspective, 3.2% of BAMS connections
are connected in our predictions. By thresholding our connec-
tions to those predicted at least twice, precision reaches 65.9%,
whereas recall drops to 1.4% (Table 3). This accuracy is near the
67.5% precision of the hand-annotated set of connections.
Precision gradually increases as the threshold increases, eventu-
ally reaching 100% for nine connections that were extracted at
least 12 times. Further, we note the anatomical speciﬁcity of the
connections increases with the average number of enclosing re-
gions reaching 10.2 when thresholded at 12 occurrences. The
region pairs not predicted to form connectivity relations have
precision of 33.7% and recall of 9.3%. Again, this level of pre-
cision results from co-mentioned regions that are connected in
BAMS, but the author is not specifying that in the sentence.
Further, the higher recall value results from the much larger
set of pairings (6079 compared with 1286 SLK-predicted par-
ings). From a co-occurrence perspective, we found that brain

regions that co-occur in eight or more sentences recall 1.6% of
the BAMS connections at 66.4% precision. Interestingly, this
naive co-occurrence—based method performs at par to the SLK
method that extracts direct connectivity statements. As the
threshold is increased from eight co-occurrences, precision con-
tinues to gain, suggesting a large number of co-occurring men-
tions can be used to predict connectivity, as well as a smaller
number of more carefully analysed connectivity statements
(Table 3).

4 DISCUSSION

We reported a complete system for extracting connectivity
statements from biomedical abstracts. The method provides
high recall of manually annotated connectivity relations
described in single sentences. Precision from two separate evalu-
ations reached 50.3% and 55.3%. By comparing with an inde-
pendent source of rat connectivity, we found that precision
increases with the recency and frequency of the extracted
relationships.

A limitation of our work is that we did not consider the
direction of connectivity, although most of the relationships we
extracted have a direction described in the sentence. In addition,
we did not consider negation (region A does not project to
region B). Extracting this information by extracting key-
words such as ‘afferent’, ‘not’ or ‘input’ will require additional
work. These relationship modiﬁers are manually annotated
in our training corpus and can be used to design more complex
rules.

Our methods also did not attempt to extract the large number
of relations that span multiple sentences. When these connections
are taken into account, the SLK method provides only 51.7%
recall of annotated connections. Application of advanced natural
language-processing techniques may be necessary to bridge the
sentences (e.g. anaphora resolution).

The comparison of seven previously published kernel-based
approaches mirrored the previous results from the protein inter-
action relationship extraction domain (Tikk et al., 2010).
Further, we note that the SLK parser was applied to the drug—
drug interaction domain with similar results (Segura-Bedmar
et al., 2011). Several of the kernel methods have lower perform-
ance than our simple rule-based technique. Effort spent crafting
more complex rules may yield higher precision at the cost of
lower recall. The top three kernel methods (SLK, all-paths
graph, k-band shortest path spectrum kernel) all have similar
accuracy (AUC and f-measure scores) but vary in precision
and recall. This difference suggests higher performance may be
achieved by combining the methods.

Our results suggest a larger set of input abstracts will yield a
larger number of precise connections. The largest extension set is
Medline with more than 10 million abstracts and 120 million
sentences. Tikk and colleagues calculated that the SLK parser
could process all of Medline in 141 days (Tikk et al., 2010). A
two-step process may reduce runtime and increase accuracy by
ﬁrst identifying abstracts with connectivity statements and then
by extracting the speciﬁc connections with SLK (Poulter et al.,
2008).

In natural language processing, it has been observed that
simple statistical models (e. g. co-occurrence) can outperform

more complex models based on less data (Halevy et al., 2009).
Our experiments conﬁrm this. We found that brain region pairs
with many co-mentions tend to be connected. This simple tech-
nique produces a larger set of potential connections with reason-
able precision. Although this will produce a larger set of results
than the SLK method, it does not target connections that can be
directly curated in light of experimental evidence because the
co-mentions may or may not describe connectivity. Further,
such co-occurrences may result from region proximity or biases
(i.e. popularity) that may inﬂuence research attention both in the
literature and in BAMS. However, such co-occurrence networks
show valuable areas of focus when combined with comentions of
genes and diseases (Hayasaka et al., 2011; Voytek and Voytek,
2012).

One of the most serious challenges we encountered was in
mapping extracted brain region mentions to standardized lexi-
cons. In our previous work, we reported resolution rates of 63%,
with the major limitation being gaps in the lexicons (French and
Pavlidis, 2011). For the current work, the resolution rate is
greatly reduced, as both brain region mentions of a connect-
ivity relation must be mapped. It also appears that regions form-
ing connectivity relations are harder to resolve or map, on
average. For this work, we managed to double the resolution
rate to the BAMS lexicon by adding synonyms. Additional
work to improve the lexicons will lead to better resolution of
connectivity statements, allowing validation and linking to
other resources.

For our evaluation to an outside database, we focused on
BAMS (Bota et al., 2005). Although rat is the most frequent
mentioned organism, other evaluations could compare the con-
nectivity results with the CoCoMac (Kotter, 2004) or the Avian
Brain Circuitry Database (Schrott and Kabai, 2008). Beyond
evaluation, our dataset and method can provide a large set of
extracted connectivity relationships for other species-speciﬁc
databases.

In conclusion, we provide the ﬁrst application of large-scale
text mining to neuroanatomical connectivity extraction. We
demonstrated that machine-learning tools designed for extrac-
tion of protein—protein interactions are generalizable to mining
brain region connections. From an information retrieval perspec-
tive, our large set of predicted connections can aid neuroscientists
in forming hypotheses and models. Future work will be aimed at
further evaluating and disseminating the results before extending
the analysis.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Here, we present riboPicker, a robust framework for
the rapid, automated identification and removal of ribosomal
RNA sequences from metatranscriptomic datasets. The results
can be exported for subsequent analysis, and the databases
used for the web-based version are updated on a regular basis.
riboPicker categorizes rRNA-like sequences and provides graphical
visualizations and tabular outputs of ribosomal coverage, alignment
results and taxonomic classifications.

Availability and implementation: This open-source application was
implemented in Perl and can be used as stand-alone version
or accessed online through a user-friendly web interface. The
source code, user help and additional information is available at
http://ribopicker.sourceforge.net/.

1 INTRODUCTION

Metatranscriptomic approaches are drastically improving our
understanding of metabolism and gene expression in microbial
communities. By investigating all functional mRNA transcripts
isolated from an environmental sample, metatranscriptomic analyses
provide insights into the metabolic pathways important for a
community at the time of sampling. Although metatranscriptomes
are used to investigate metabolic activities, the majority of RNA
recovered in metatranscriptomic studies is ribosomal RNA (rRNA),
often exceeding 90% of the total reads (Stewart et al., 2010).
Even after various treatments prior to sequencing, the observed
rRNA content decreases only slightly (He et al., 2010) and
metatranscriptomes still contain signiﬁcant amounts of rRNA.
Although rRNA-like sequences are occasionally removed from
metatranscriptomes, the removal is performed only with a subset
of the publicly available rRNA sequences. Failure to remove
all rRNA sequences can lead to misclassiﬁcations and erroneous
conclusions during the downstream analysis. It is estimated that
misannotations of rRNA as proteins may cause up to 90% false
positive matches of rRNA-like sequences in metatranscriptomic
studies (Tripp et al., 2011). The potential for false positives arrises

from a failure to completely remove all rRNA prior to translating
the putative rRNA and querying a protein database. The rRNA
operons in Bacteria and Archaea are not known to contain expressed
protein coding regions that at the same time code for rRNA and
therefore, annotations of proteins in rRNA coding regions should be
presumed to be misannotations (Aziz et al., 2008). Metagenomic
sequence data generated to asses the metabolic potential of a
community will also be affected by false positive matches of rRNA
sequences when querying a protein database. Therefore, transcript
analysis should only proceed after it has been veriﬁed that all
rRNA-like sequences have been found and removed from the
dataset to allow accurate identiﬁcation of the transcribed functional
content. The high-throughput nature of community sequencing
efforts necessitates better tools for the automated preprocessing of
sequence datasets.

Here, we describe an application able to provide graphical
guidance and to perform identiﬁcation, classiﬁcation and
removal of rRNA-like sequences on metatranscriptomic data.
The application incorporates a modiﬁed version of the BWA-
SW program (http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/citmgr?gca
=bioinfo;26/5/5 89), and is publicly available through a user-friendly
web interface and as stand-alone version. The web interface allows
online analysis using rRNA sequences from public databases and
provides data export for subsequent analysis.

2 METHODS

2.1 Implementation and computational platform

The riboPicker application was implemented as stand-alone and web-based
version in Perl. The web application is currently running on a web server with
Ubuntu Linux using an Apache HTTP server to support the web services. The
alignments are computed on a connected computing cluster with 10 working
nodes (each with 8 CPUs and 16 GB RAM) running the Oracle Grid Engine
version 6.2. All graphics are generated using the Cairo graphics library
(http://cairographics.org/).

2.2 Identiﬁcation of rRNA-like sequences

The identiﬁcation of rRNA-like sequences is based on sequence alignments
using a modiﬁed version of the BWA-SW program. The modiﬁcations do
not change the default behavior of the algorithm and include parameter
forced changes in the alignment of ambiguous bases and the generation of
an alternative output. The documentation provides a detailed list of changes
and is available on the program website.

riboPicker uses query sequence coverage, alignment identity and
minimum alignment length thresholds to determine if an input sequence

is an rRNA-like sequence or not. This approach is based on the idea that
looking for similar regions consists of grouping sequences that share some
minimum sequence similarity over a speciﬁed minimum length. Threshold
percentage values are rounded toward the lower integer and should not be
set to 100% if errors are expected in the input sequences. The results for
multiple databases are automatically joined before generating any outputs.

Using simulated datasets, we evaluated the classiﬁcation of rRNA-like
sequences and showed that riboPicker performed with high accuracy
comparable to the latest version of meta_rna (Huang et al., 2009)
and BLASTn (Supplementary Material). A comparison on real
metatranscriptomic data showed that riboPicker processes data more
than twice as fast as Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based programs and
>100 times faster than BLASTn (Supplementary Material).

2.3 Reference databases

The web-based version offers preprocessed databases for 58/5.8$,16S/18$
and 238/288 rRNA sequences from a variety of resources, currently including
SILVA (Pruesse et al., 2007), RDP (Cole et al., 2009), Greengenes (DeSantis
et al., 2006), Rfam (Gardner et al., 2011), NCBI (Sayers et al., 2011) and
HMP DACC (The NIH HMP Working Group et al., 2009). To reduce the
number of possibly misannotated entries, sequences were ﬁltered by length
to remove very short and long sequences and by genomic location to remove
overlapping rRNA misannotations. The remaining sequences were then
converted into DNA sequences (if required) and ﬁltered for read duplicates
to reduce redundancy in the sequence data. Detailed information for each
reference database is provided on the website. Taxonomic information was
either retrieved with the sequence data from the resources or was added
based on the NCBI Taxonomy. The databases are automatically updated on
a regular basis and can be requested from the authors for ofﬂine analysis. A
non-redundant database is made available for the stand-alone version on the
program website.

3 WEB-INTERFACE
3.1 Inputs

The web interface allows the submission of compressed FASTA or
FASTQ ﬁles to reduce the time of data upload. Uploaded data can
be shared or accessed at a later point using unique data identiﬁers.
It should be noted at this point that the input datasets should
only contain quality-controlled, preprocessed sequences to ensure
accurate results (Schmieder and Edwards, 2011). In addition to the
sequence data, the rRNA reference databases have to be selected
from the list of available databases.

Unlike the stand-alone version, the web-based program allows
the user to deﬁne threshold parameters based on the results after the
data are processed. This does not require an a priori knowledge of
the best parameters for a given dataset and the parameter choice can
be guided by the graphical Visualizations.

3.2 Outputs

Users can download the results in FASTA or FASTQ (if provided
as input) format or its compressed version. Results will be stored
for the time selected by the user (either 1 day or 1 week), if not
otherwise requested, on the web server using a unique identiﬁer
displayed during data processing and on the result page. This
identiﬁer additionally allows users to share the result with other
researchers.

The current implementation offers several graphical and tabular
outputs in addition to the processed sequence data. The Coverage
versus Identity plot shows the number of matching reads for

different coverage and identity threshold values. The coverage plots
show where the metatranscriptomic sequences aligned to the rRNA
reference sequences and provide an easy way to check for possible
bias in the alignment or the rRNA-removal prior to sequencing.
The coverage data for each database sequence is available for
download. The taxonomic classiﬁcations of rRNA-like sequences
are presented as bar charts for each selected database. The summary
report includes information about the input data, selected databases
and thresholds, and rRNA-like sequence classiﬁcations by database,
domain and phyla.

4 BRIEF SURVEY OF ALTERNATIVE PROGRAMS

There are different applications that can identify rRNA—like
sequences in metatranscriptomic datasets. The command line
program meta_rna (Huang et al., 2009) is written in Python and
identiﬁes rRNA sequences based on HMMs using the HMMER
package (Eddy, 2009). Another program based on HMMER is
rRNASelector (Lee et al., 2011), which is written in Java and
can only be used through its graphical interface. The web-based
MG—RAST (Meyer et al., 2008) uses the BLASTn program,
identifying rRNA-like sequences based on sequence similarity. The
HMM—based programs currently allow identiﬁcation of bacterial and
archaeal rRNAs. The sequence similarity-based programs make it
easy to assign sequences to taxonomic groups.

5 CONCLUSION

riboPicker allows scientists to efﬁciently remove rRNA—like
sequences from their metatranscriptomic datasets prior to
downstream analysis. The web interface is simple and user—friendly,
and the stand-alone version allows ofﬂine analysis and integration
into existing data processing pipelines. The tool provides a
computational resource able to handle the amount of data that
next-generation sequencers are capable of generating and can place
the process more within reach of the average research lab.

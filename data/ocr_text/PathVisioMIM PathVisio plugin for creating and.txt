ABSTRACT

Motivation: A plugin for the Java-based PathVisio pathway editor
has been developed to help users draw diagrams of bioregulatory
networks according to the Molecular Interaction Map (MIM) notation.
Together with the core PathVisio application, this plugin presents a
simple to use and cross-platform application for the construction of
complex MIM diagrams with the ability to annotate diagram elements
with comments, literature references and links to external databases.
This tool extends the capabilities of the PathVisio pathway editor by
providing both MIM-specific glyphs and support for a MIM-specific
markup language file format for exchange with other MIM-compatible
tools and diagram validation.

Availability: The PathVisio-MIM plugin is freely available and works
with versions of PathVisio 2.0.11 and later on Windows, Mac OS X
and Linux. Information about MIM notation and the MIMML format is
available at http://discover.nci.nih.gov/mim. The plugin, along with
diagram examples, instructions and Java source code, may be
downloaded at http://discover.nci.nih.gov/mim/mim_pathvisio.html.

1 INTRODUCTION

Understanding biological pathways requires knowledge of both
the biological components of a pathway and the interactions
between its components. Improvements in molecular biology
techniques have fueled a surge in this type of information. This
has made the organization of biological knowledge along with
consistent mechanisms for how this information is exchanged among
researchers of utmost importance.

One of the most common means of relating information about
biological pathways is through the use of pathway diagrams
which are oftentimes more ‘natural’ to readers. The Molecular
Interaction Map (MIM) notation is a graphical notation for
depicting diagrams of biochemical and cellular processes designed
to alleviate ambiguity that exists in many diagrams currently found
in publications (Kohn et al., 2006). MIM diagrams are similar to

road maps or electronic circuit diagrams, and are used to deﬁne
entities and their interactions in biological systems.

The MIM notation has been described extensively in the past,
but until now it has only limited software support. Software is
important to make the creation of large—scale diagrams, typical to
MIM diagrams, feasible. Previously, creation of MIM diagrams
was conducted using general graphics products, such as Adobe
Illustrator. Some missing features in these tools include easy access
to MIM glyphs, connectors that remain attached to elements as they
are rearranged, connectors with routing capability and functionality
to associate annotations to speciﬁc elements. A comparison of
several interaction network and pathway diagram editors is provided
in Table 1 in the Supplementary Material.

PathVisio is a full—featured diagram editor for biological pathways
with the ability to change many attributes of diagram elements:
data nodes (color, size and labels) and connecting lines (color and
arrowheads) (van Iersel et al., 2008). PathVisio also allows elements
to be linked to external databases and references, and it is capable
of producing graphics in a variety of formats including SVG, PNG
and PDF. PathVisio is a Java—based application available on all
major computing platforms (e. g. Windows, Mac OS X and Linux).
Additionally, PathVisio has provided some of the graphical elements
necessary for the MIM notation since PathVisio 1.1.

Since these earlier versions, continued development of the MIM
support has been conducted as an independent plugin. By moving
MIM functionality into a plugin, the user interface can be highly
customized to MIM support, while the core program remains open to
unformatted pathway diagrams. The major objective of this project
is to provide complete support for the MIM notation in a simple to
use graphical editor and for it to serve as one starting point for future
MIM software development.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

PathVisio provides a plugin interface that allows the majority
of the editor to be extended and customized; changes were also
introduced into the core software as necessary to facilitate MIM—
speciﬁc features. Here, we present the support for the MIM notation
within PathVisio.

2.1 PathVisio-MIM features

The MIM notation has evolved, since its inception in 1999, as it
has become necessary to support additional biological constructs.

Fig. 1. Screenshot of PathVisio diagram editor with PathVisio—MIM plugin
loaded. MIM—speciﬁc glyphs are shown in the right—hand side panel.

An updated speciﬁcation (available at http://discover.nci.nih.gov/
mim/) was recently created that is meant to facilitate software
implementation; readers should refer to Luna et al. (2011) for
information regarding the MIM glyphs as implemented in this
plugin. The PathVisio—MIM plugin provides full implementation of
the updated speciﬁcation and the following features.

MIM Glyphs: the plugin introduces a new side panel that contains
the MIM glyphs separated into the categories laid out by the
speciﬁcation; these are shown in Figure 1. Interaction glyphs
drawn through this interface use orthogonal line connectors that
are recommended for MIM diagrams. Support for the additional
MIM glyphs, such as complexes, branching connectors and the glyph
representing intermolecular interactions are provided through user
interactions outside the MIM panel; for instance, the product of a
binding interaction added through the right—click menu. Instructional
videos are provided for usage of these glyphs (http://discover.nci.nih
.gov/mim/mim_pathvisio.html).

Annotations: interactions on diagrams may be annotated with
comments and literature reference information. These annotations
allow users to document the sources of interactions and help
readers of MIM diagrams ﬁnd the original resources to gain a
greater understanding of a particular biological system. Additionally,
entities may be cross—referenced with identiﬁers from a wide range
of external databases, such as Entrez Gene, HUGO gene names, etc.
Support for MIMML: diagrams may be stored as either the
native PathVisio GPML format or in the MIM Markup Language
(MIMML) format that was recently developed (Luna et al., 2011).
The MIMML format is intended as a common exchange mechanism
between MIM software, and is supported by another MIM editor,
MIMTool (http://code.google.com/p/mimtool/; Edes,M. et al.,
manuscript in preparation). Additionally, this format is used for the
validation of MIM diagrams according to syntax rules outlined by
the MIM speciﬁcation. Import and export functionality in the plugin

is provided through a MIM application programming interface
(API); export functionality only exports MIM—speciﬁc elements to
help ensure diagrams are in accordance with the MIM notation and
exchangeable with other MIM software. A potential use for the
import capability is in loading MIMML documents from other tools
for conversion into formats that PathVisio supports.

3 CONCLUSION

The PathVisio—MIM plugin helps biologists draw diagrams in
accordance with the MIM notation. This combined with the many
features of PathVisio will aid in making the MIM notation accessible
to a wider audience. To encourage usage of this software and
the notation by ﬁrst—time users, we provide example ﬁles, written
documentation and instructional videos on the project web site.

The plugin takes advantage of the extensible nature of PathVisio
to provide support of all the major features of the MIM notation
and may serve as an example for MIM support in other software.
Code additions that were made in the core PathVisio editor should
facilitate the support of other notations in PathVisio, such as
the Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN) or the modiﬁed
Edinburgh Pathway notation (Freeman et al., 2010; Le Novere et al.,
2009); support for the SBGN notation is currently in development
via a separate plugin. Support for these notations or other notations
within the same software tool presents a basis for translating
diagrams between notations. Future development of the plugin is
expected as additions are made to the MIM speciﬁcation. Also, we
expect the addition of validation support in PathVisio for rulesets,
such as the one developed for MIMML.

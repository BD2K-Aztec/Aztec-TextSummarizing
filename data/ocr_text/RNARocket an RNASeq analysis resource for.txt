Abstract

Motivation: RNA—Seq is a method for profiling transcription using high—throughput sequencing
and is an important component of many research projects that wish to study transcript isoforms,
condition specific expression and transcriptional structure. The methods, tools and technologies
used to perform RNA—Seq analysis continue to change, creating a bioinformatics challenge for re—
searchers who wish to exploit these data. Resources that bring together genomic data, analysis
tools, educational material and computational infrastructure can minimize the overhead required
of life science researchers.

Results: RNA—Rocket is a free service that provides access to RNA—Seq and ChlP—Seq analysis tools
for studying infectious diseases. The site makes available thousands of pre—indexed genomes, their
annotations and the ability to stream results to the bioinformatics resources VectorBase, EuPathDB
and PATRIC. The site also provides a combination of experimental data and metadata, examples of
pre—computed analysis, step—by—step guides and a user interface designed to enable both novice
and experienced users of RNA—Seq data.

Availability and implementation: RNA—Rocket is available at rnaseq.pathogenportal.org. Source
code for this project can be found at github.com/cidvbi/PathogenPortal.

1 Introduction

Transcriptomic analysis using high—throughput sequencing con—
tinues to increase in popularity due to low sequencing costs, its sen—
sitivity, reproducibility and its ability to sample the entire
transcriptome (Wang et 61]., 2009). As an active area of research,
there are many variations of RNA—Seq protocols, data types and
tools that continue to evolve. As a result, there is no ‘one size fits all’
solution for doing RNA—Seq analysis. The range of considerations
facing life scientists who want to leverage this technology can de—
mand significant investment of time and resources. For this reason,
we have created RNA—Rocket, an RNA—Seq analysis service that en—
ables infectious disease research for prokaryotic and eukaryotic
pathogens as well as vectors and host genomes.

RNA—Rocket is built on Galaxy (Blankenberg et 61]., 2001;
Giardine et 61]., 2005; Goecks et 61]., 2010), with modifications to
help simplify the process for routine use and provide a guided user
experience. RNA—Rocket integrates data from the PATRIC,
EuPathDB and VectorBase Bioinformatics Resource Centers (BRCs)
and is provided by Pathogen Portal (pathogenportal.0rg), a resource
linking all BRCs funded by the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases (NIAID).

The RNA—Rocket service leverages multiple open source soft—
ware tools to provide a free resource where users can upload their
RNA—Seq data, align them against a genome and generate quantita—
tive transcript profiles. This service also provides streaming of align-
ment and annotation results back to the appropriate BRC so that
users can view results in the relevant BRC, using annotations and
tools provided in support of transcriptomic analysis.

The Pathosystems Resource Integration Center (PATRIC) is the
all—bacteria Bioinformatics Resource Center (patricbrc.org)
(Wattam et 61]., 2013). PATRIC provides researchers with an online
resource that stores and integrates a variety of data types (e.g. gen—
omics, transcriptomics, protein—protein interactions, 3—D protein
structures and sequence typing data) along with any associated
metadata. The eukaryotic pathogen databases (EuPathDB: eupathd—
b.0rg) provide access to a variety of data types from important
human and veterinary parasites such as Plasmodium (malaria),
Cryptosporidium (cryptosporidiosis) and kinetoplastida (i.e.
Trypcmosoma brucei and Leishmania species.) (Aurrecoechea et 61].,
2013). VectorBase (vectorbase.org) is a bioinformatics resource for
invertebrate vectors of human parasites and pathogens (Megy et 61].,
2012). It currently hosts the genomes of 35 organisms including
mosquitoes (20 of which are Anopheles species), tsetse ﬂies, ticks,
lice, kissing bugs and sandflies.

2 Implementation

RNA—Rocket takes advantage of many different open—source projects
to enable users to upload and analyze their own data. We use the
Galaxy system to consolidate and provide the tools and services neces—
sary to process high—throughput sequencing data. The use of Galaxy
has many benefits: showing provenance information for data creation,
including the tools and parameters used to process data; support for
batch analysis for multiple samples; providing a mechanism for results
sharing across research groups and publishing for external references
such as presentations or publications and its integration of tools and
projects in the larger bioinformatics community.

Before users can run analysis on the RNA—Rocket site they must
first upload their data in FASTQ format. Using standard Galaxy
interfaces RNA—Rocket supports upload via URL, FTP, HTTP and
direct transfer via the European Nucleotide Archive (Leinonen et 61].,

2011), which can be searched using ENA, SRA, GEO and
ArrayExpress identifiers. To enable basic RNA—Seq processing,
RNA—Rocket provides users with a set of pre—determined Galaxy
workﬂows configured to use existing BRC genomes and annota—
tions. The primary workflow for RNA—Seq analysis aligns short read
data to a reference genome using B0wtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg,
2012) or TopHat2 (Kim et 61]., 2013), assembles transcripts using
Cufﬂinks, and generates coverage bedGraph and BigWig files using
BEDTools (Quinlan and Hall, 2010) and UCSC tools (Kuhn et 61].,
2013), respectively. This workflow generates BAM files and tab—de—
limited output, which can be used to determine transcript structure
and the level of expression in the target organism.

The site also provides the ability to conduct differential expres—
sion analysis using Cuffdiff, part of the Cufflinks suite and the abil—
ity to visualize data generated using CummeRbund (Trapnell et 61].,
2012). When users submit their jobs to RNA—Rocket, they are
queued and run on a first—come, first—served basis on a compute clus—
ter using a modern, high—density computer architecture.

The site features an interactive concept diagram, which high-
lights the appropriate processing step(s), based on the concept that
the user is interested in. Clicking on a concept diagram component
gives information about the corresponding processing steps that ful—
fill the component (Fig. 1). To assist users, the site provides a
‘Launch Pad’ menu system that breaks down the context and ration—
ale for executing a particular step, the input required from the user
and the output that is generated.

RNA—Rocket is designed to make users aware of three major
concerns: the quality base calls in their sequencing reads, the number
of reads aligned from their sample and accounting for PCR bias.
Base call quality can vary depending on the sequencing technology
and sample preparation. Poor quality sequencing can impact the cer—
tainty with which a read can be mapped to the genome (Li et 61].,
2008). Although, modern aligners endeavor to account for Phred
quality scores when performing alignment, it is important for users
to be aware that low quality input can lead to low levels of align-
ment. To help users account for this, RNA—Rocket provides access
to the FastQC tool (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/
projects/fastqc) for determining the quality profile of sample
reads, as well as Sickle (https://github.com/najoshi/sickle) and
Trimmomatic (Bolger et 61]., 2014), which can be used to automatic—
ally trim off low quality base calls from the ends of sequencing
reads. Once alignment is performed the user also has the option to
check the quality profile and number of reads mapped using a modi—
fied version of the SAMStat tool (Lassmann et 61]., 2011). The RNA—
Rocket site highlights these quality control steps in both the concept
diagram and interactive menu system. These three options enable
the researcher to maximize the amount of their sample being used
through iterative pre—processing, alignment and evaluation.

RNA—Rocket also provides a quality control option for
removing PCR bias that can occur as a result of library preparation

(Aird et al., 2011). Certain sequences may be overrepresented if their
composition leads to bias in the amplification process (Benjamini and
Speed, 2012). For paired—end data this option uses Picard tools (http://
picard.s0urcef0rge.net/) to ‘collapse’ multiple read pairs that have iden—
tical coordinates for the first and second read into a single representa—
tive pair.

In addition to RNA—Seq analysis, RNA—Rocket also supports
ChIP-Seq (Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Sequencing) analysis by
providing access to the peak calling program MACS (Zhang et al.,
2008). After mapping the reads to the reference genome, a user may
use MACS to identify and quantify the ChIP signal enriched genomic
regions. The mapped reads and genome coverage can be directly
viewed via the BRC genome browsers and the peak calling result can
be viewed and downloaded via the RNA—Rocket web interface.

The RNA—Rocket site is updated daily with genomes and annota—
tions from each of the contributing BRCs. Thousands of genomes
are organized and indexed using B0wtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg,
2012) and SAMtools (Li et al., 2009) to enable alignment and bias
correction for abundance estimation, respectively. Reference re—
sources are organized by BRC so that results can be streamed and
analyzed within the context of the data provider.

3 Results

The RNA-Rocket project modifies the existing Galaxy code so that
Galaxy workﬂows can be constructed in advance by system adminis—
trators and shared to users through a tiered menu system. This menu
system, referred to as ‘Launch Pad’, organizes RNA—Seq processing
steps conceptually and gives increasing detail as the user progress to—
wards launching a job, i.e. an analysis step. This system also asks the
user to populate their project space, known as a ‘history’ in Galaxy
terms, with the necessary files before attempting to configure the par—
ameters for their job. This is designed to minimize confusion when at—
tempting to setup an analysis and promote organization for projects
involving many files and processing steps. Using the workﬂow system,
RNA—Rocket provides pre—formulated solutions for common prob—
lems that users encounter. These workﬂows are easily adapted to new
tools and are publicly available for download to enable ofﬂine analysis
and customization for researchers.

RNA—Rocket provides example data from each of the BRC
projects so that users can familiarize themselves with the site using
real data. Some of these data are provided through the Driving
Biological Project (DBP) initiative, research projects competitively
enabled through NIAID’s BRC program designed to drive innov—
ation at the BRC sites based on the needs of the research community.
Each dataset is provided as both ‘before’ and ‘after’ project spaces
so that users can import the project into their own user space, run
their own analysis and view pre—existing results. See the
Supplementary Material for more details on this data.

By combining experimental concepts with file—based requirements,
the user interface aims to guide life science researchers through the
process of RNA—Seq data analysis while making them aware of quality
control caveats. After results have been computed at the RNA—Rocket
site they can be streamed back to the respective BRC depending on
the reference organism selected for analysis. This provides users with
the ability to process and analyze their RNA—Seq data remotely with—
out having to download potentially large files to their own computer.

RNA—Rocket is a free service that can be used by life—science re—
searchers to process and analyze their RNA—Seq data. The site maintains
up—to—date genome and annotation data through NIAD’s Bioinformatic

Resource Centers. By leveraging BRC data and the Galaxy system, the
RNA—Rocket project can provide up—to—date tools and capability despite
the rapidly changing landscape of RNA—Seq analysis.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Reverse engineering gene regulatory networks,
especially large size networks from time series gene expression
data, remain a challenge to the systems biology community. In
this article, a new hybrid algorithm integrating ordinary differential
equation models with dynamic Bayesian network analysis, called
Differential Equation-based Local Dynamic Bayesian Network
(DELDBN), was proposed and implemented for gene regulatory
network inference.

Results: The performance of DELDBN was benchmarked with an
in vivo dataset from yeast. DELDBN significantly improved the
accuracy and sensitivity of network inference compared with other
approaches. The local causal discovery algorithm implemented in
DELDBN also reduced the complexity of the network inference
algorithm and improved its scalability to infer larger networks. We
have demonstrated the applicability of the approach to a network
containing thousands of genes with a dataset from human HeLa
cell time series experiments. The local network around BRCA1 was
particularly investigated and validated with independent published
studies. BRAC1 network was significantly enriched with the known
BRCA1-relevant interactions, indicating that DELDBN can effectively
infer large size gene regulatory network from time series data.

1 INTRODUCTION

The increasing availability of high—throughput measurements of
transcripts has presented a golden opportunity for elucidating gene
regulatory pathways and networks for important traits such as human
diseases. Time series datasets such as the temporal measurements
in yeast (Spellman et al., 1998) and human cell cycles (Whitﬁeld
et al., 2002) are of particular interests for two reasons. First, the
temporal measurements capture the expression proﬁle of the genes

in a dynamic process, which allows for efﬁcient deconvolution of the
regulatory interactions from the data. Second, the time information
of a temporal measurement provides an important extra dimension
for causality studies based on the intuition that past events has causal
effects on current and future events and not Vice versa.

It is the motivation of this article to develop a systems biology
approach to reverse engineer gene regulatory network from time
series data with higher accuracy and better scalability than has
been achieved using currently existing methodologies. Various
approaches have been developed and applied for this purpose, which
generally fall into one of the two categories, namely the model—
based approaches and the machine learning—based approaches.
Ordinary differential equation (ODE) models were used in the
model—based approaches to explicitly represent the dependence of
the concentration of one gene’s transcripts on that of other genes. The
representative example algorithms in this category include network
identiﬁcation by regression (NIR) (Gardner et al., 2003), singular
value decomposition and regression analysis (Yeung et al., 2002),
mode—of—action by network identiﬁcation (MNI) (di Bernardo et al.,
2005), time series network identiﬁcation (TSNI) (Cantone et al.,
2009) and Inferator (Bonneau et al., 2006). Examples in the second
category include the use of various machine learning approaches for
network learning, such as partial correlation (Schafer and Stimmer,
2005), Graphic Gaussian Models (GGM) (Schafer and Stimmer,
2005), Dynamic Bayesian network analysis (DBN) (Murpy and
Mian, 1999; Yu et al., 2004; Zou and Conen, 2005), state space
model (Li et al., 2006a) and Granger causality (Mukhopadhyay and
Chatterjee, 2007; Nagaraj an and Upreti, 2010). However, the success
of these approaches have been limited due to technical challenges
such as the difﬁculty in estimating the parameters in the ODE models
and the computational complexity for machine learning approaches
like DBN for large size networks and lack of gold standard datasets
for the benchmarking of methodologies.

In this article, we propose a new approach, named DELDBN
(Differential Equation based Local Dynamic Bayesian Network),
to integrate ODE models with dynamic Bayesian analysis to infer
gene regulatory networks. ODE models represent a parametric
version of mechanistic gene regulations with the advantage of
accurately capturing the underlying data generation process. To
avoid the challenge of estimating parameters in solving ODE
models, we applied a DBN analysis step to connect the left—hand
side (transcription rate of a gene) to the right—hand side of an ODE
(expression level of regulatory genes). To improve the speedup

and scalability of the DBN analysis, we implemented a new DBN
learning algorithm using local causality discovery algorithm by
identifying a Markov Blanket (Margaritis and Thrun, 1999) of the
transcription rate. To benchmark the method, we ﬁrst estimated the
pammmmejﬂmDHlBNdgmmmumgmnnmemdmmk
dataset from yeast with a known synthetic gene regulatory network.
Our algorithm demonstrated superior accuracy when compared with
other known approaches that have previously been applied to the
same dataset. Next, we applied the algorithm to the time series
expression measurements for thousands of genes of human HeLa
cells within a cell cycle. We examined the network around a well
studied gene, BRCA1, and found that the BRACl network was
signiﬁcantly enriched with the known BRCAl—relevant interactions,
indicating that DELDBN can effectively infer large—sized gene
regulatory network from time series data.

2 METHODS

2.1 Modeling dynamic gene regulation with ordinary
differential equation
Following previous work on the ODE modeling of gene regulation (Bonneau
et al., 2006), we model the dynamic gene expression as follows
dX-(t)
d’t = ZﬁzijU) (1)
in which Xi(t), Xj(t) represent the expression level of gene i and j at time
t, respectively. The items on the right represent the combined effects of all

other genes on gene i with ﬁij representing the effect of gene j on gene i.
We use

 

Xi(t+ 1) —Xi(t)
At
to approximate the transcription rate of gene i when expression data was
sampled densely enough, e.g. every 10 min in yeast cell (Cantone et al.,
2009). Equation ( 1) can then be transformed into the following format

W =Zﬁz-J-Xja) (2)
If time interval is long (e. g. in hours) and transcription rate dx/dt cannot be
accurately estimated from data, we use an autoregression model to replace
Equation ( 1)
Xi(t+1)=Zﬁz-J-Xj(t) (3)
While in the steady state case, we learn the gene regulations by uncovering
the genes at time t that regulate the expression of gene i at t+1, in the
dynamic case, we learn the gene regulations by identifying the genes that
regulate the transcription rate of gene i at time t. Hence, learning the gene
regulatory network is thus reduced to solving the Equations (2) and (3) as
described before. Unlike previous studies (Bonneau et al., 2006), we use
DBN analysis to learn the dependence of the left—hand side of the equations
to the right—hand side.

2.2 Local causality-based

DBN analysis

DBN was ﬁrst introduced and implemented by Murphy et al. to model the
gene regulatory network (Murphy and Mian, 1999); however, the intensive
computational cost limited the application of DBN to small size gene
regulatory networks with 100 or less genes. The search and score—based
DBN inference tool Banjo (Yu et al., 2004) is the only DBN tool to our
knowledge that can be applied to large—sized networks; however, multiple
equivalent structures could have the same scores, thereby making it difﬁcult
to obtain a unique, globally optimized solution.

In this article, we propose a new algorithm based on local causal discovery
algorithms which have been developed in recent years to address the problem

of scalability of Bayesian network learning approaches (Aliferis et al., 2010).
Aliferis et al. presented a theoretical analysis of the robustness of local
causal discovery algorithms which we brieﬂy summarize here. Local causal
discovery algorithm learns the local neighborhood of a speciﬁc target variable
instead of learning the full causal network. In this study, we use a Markov
blanket to identify the local neighborhood. The Markov blanket of a target
variable T was deﬁned as a minimal set of variables, by conditioning on
which all other variables are independent of T. Sound algorithms have been
developed for Markov blanket identiﬁcation, an example of which is the
growth—shrink algorithm (Margaritis and Thrun, 1999). In the growth phase,
all variables that are dependent on T are added to MB(T), while in the
shrink phase all variables were tested for independence to T within MB(T)
to remove the independent variables. However, the GS algorithm uses weak
heuristic and requires the sample size to grow exponentially to the size
of the Markov blanket (Aliferis et al., 2010). Improved algorithms such
as incremental association Markov blanket (IAMB) and its variants from
Aliferis’s group are needed for large—scale dataset analysis. Therefore, the
GS algorithm was used in our ﬁrst application of yeast synthetic network
data and the IAMB algorithm was used in the second application to human
HeLa cell cycle data analysis.

Our DBN learning is based on Markov blanket identiﬁcation. The pseudo
algorithm is described as follows.

Algorithm DELDBN
Input: A time series data X (t = 1 :N ) with P genes, N time points
Output: Net_DELDBN with dimension pxp

For i = 1 :P//loop through every gene

1: Target =X (i, 2 :N ) expression of gene i from i=2 to N, for steady
state measurements with long time intervals, or Target=X (i, 2 :N ) —
T (i , 1 :N — 1), transcription rate from t: 2 to N, for dynamic proﬁles
with small time intervals;

2: Select expression data for potential regulators R=X(:,1:N—1),
expression of all genes from i=1 to N — 1.

3: Solve Equation (1) using local causal discovery algorithm through
identifying the Markov blanket of target variable T, MB (Target) from
its potential regulators.

4: Parent (i)=MB(Target)//Direction assignment. Directions were
assigned based upon the intuition that the regulatory effects always
go from previous events to the present or future events. Thus, the
direction were naturally assigned as MB(T) to T.

5: Net_DELDBN(i, parent(i)) = 1;
End //for loop

The algorithm is illustrated in Figure 1. The BNLeam R package (Scutari,
2010) was used for Markov Blanket identiﬁcation. The Hygecdf function in
Matlab was used for hypergeometric test in evaluating the enrichment score
of a subset of genes in a local network.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Improved accuracy of a reverse engineered yeast
IRMA network from time series data

In order to evaluate the performance of DELDBN, we ﬁrst applied
the algorithm to a newly published in vivo benchmark dataset from
yeast (Cantone et al., 2009). A synthetic gene regulatory network
was built into the Saccharomyces cerevisiae, thus we know a priori
the underlying network structure. Dynamic proﬁles of the mRNA
expression were measured every 10min after a perturbation of
culture medium caused by a switch between galactose and glucose.
The switch—off time series data were used for reconstructing the
network structure.

Considering the short time intervals in the data, we used the
transcription rate of a target gene for inferring the connections to the
target gene. The inference results were shown in Figure 2. Overall
our algorithm was able to uncover 10 connections, of which 7 are
part of the original network. Following the metrics used by the
authors (Cantone et al., 2009), we calculated positive predictive
value, PPV=0.7, and sensitivity, SE=0.875. We compared the
performance to the other algorithms, including TSNI, and DBN in
Banjo, as described by Cantone et al. (2009) and Gaussian process
as described in Aijo and Lahdesmaki (2010) in Table 1. From the

comparison, we can see that our algorithm achieved the highest
sensitivity with accuracy comparable with other top performing
algorithms. We also noticed that one of the three false connections
was between connected pair of genes, SWIS—CBFl, but with a
reversed direction. It indicated that it was difﬁcult to tell direction
between SWIS—CBFl based on the data, while strong connections
were suggested by the data.

The most noticeable improvement with DELDBN is the
signiﬁcant increase of both PPV and sensitivity (SE) when compared
with the score—based DBN algorithm in Banjo. We believe that
it was the ODE modeling process, i.e. using the time differential
of the target variable to identify the regulatory interactors prior to
applying the DBN algorithm, improved the performance. We tested
the DELDBN inference without the transcription rate estimation
step. As shown in Figure 2C, the inference performance (with
PPV = 0.3, and SE = 0.375) was indeed much worse than that shown
in Figure 2B (with PPV = 0.7, and SE = 0.875), and was comparable
to the performance of DBN in Banjo (with PPV = 0.3, SE = 0.25) as
reported in Cantone et al. (2009). In summary, our new algorithm
DELDBN was able to infer the IRMA network with the highest
sensitivity and top ranked accuracy. The integration of the ODE
model into the DBN process improved the performance of network
inference signiﬁcantly when the time interval is short enough for
accurate transcription rate estimation.

3.2 Enhanced scalability and connectivity of a reverse
engineered BRCAl network from human HeLa cell
time series data

In the ﬁrst example, we showed the performance of DELDBN
with an in vivo benchmark dataset for a small size network.
In order to examine the scalability of DELDBN to large sized
networks, we next applied DELDBN to a human HeLa cell time
series dataset. The dataset was ﬁrst generated by Whiteﬁeld et al.
(2002) to identify genes that are periodically expressed in cell
cycles. Various analyses have been applied to this dataset for
reconstructing gene regulatory networks, including the Granger
causality analysis (Mukhopadhyay and Chatterj ee, 2007; Nagaraj an
and Upreti, 2010) and time—lagged correlation analysis (Li et al.,
2006b). We started the analysis with 1134 genes with periodicity
of expression across 48 time points, of which 1099 genes with
no missing values in all samples of Experiment 3 were included
in our analysis (see File 1 in Supplementary Material for details
of the 1099 genes) (Whiteﬁeld et al., 2002). The whole dataset
was downloaded from http://genome—www.stanford.edu/Human—
Cellecle/Hela/data/dataPlusScores_a115.txt.

The time interval in this experiment is l h, which led us to assume
the steady—state conditions for each time point. Therefore, we used
the mRNA expression level, instead of the transcription rate, of
the target gene to infer the regulatory interactions. We speciﬁcally
investigated the ﬁrst and second neighbors of one particular gene
BRCAl (breast cancer associated gene 1) since it is well studied for
its functional role in inducing increased risk of breast cancer and
ovarian cancer (Deng, 2006). Many interaction partners have been
identiﬁed in the literature (Deng, 2006). Perturbation studies have
also been done to identify genes responsive to BRCAl suppression
in cell lines (Bae et al., 2005). Such information can thus be used
as an independent gold standards to validate the BRCA1 network
reconstructed from the HeLa cell time series dataset.

The BRCAl network is shown in Figure 3, with 185 genes in
this local network, of which 11 were directly connected to BRCAl.
Some of the important functional categories were summarized in
Table 2. The Cytoscape ﬁle of the whole network can be found in
File 2 in Supplementary Material.

Studies have shown that BRCAl is involved in the ubiquitination
of r—Tubulin, which regulates the centrosome number (Starita et al.,
2004). In an independent study, microtubule motor proteins such

as kinesins and kinesin—like proteins, and together with tubulin
itself were downregulated in BRCAl silenced cell lines (Bae et al.,
2005). Histones were also found to have decreased expression in
the same study. As shown in Table 2, within the local network
we found all of the above—mentioned genes. We calculated the
enrichment of these four categories within BRCAl neighborhood
using a hypergeometric test by comparing the distribution of the
functional group within BRCAl local network to the background
network outside of BRCA1 network. The test indicates that Tubulin
(P=0.0048) and kinesin—like proteins (P=0.0069) were highly
enriched with P<0.01 and histone family proteins (P=0.0342)
were enriched with P < 0.05.

Interestingly, two topoisomerases, TopBP1[GENE271X,
IMAGE:200136, G1/S TOPBPl topoisomerase (DNA) II binding
protein Hs.9l4l7 R97836 DNA metabolisml DNA replication and
chromosome cycle] and Top2A [GENE548X, IMAGE:366971,
G2 TOP2A topoisomerase (DNA) II alpha (170 kDa) Hs.156346
AA026682], were also found in the BRCA1 network. TopBPl
has been reported to have functional relations with BRCAl in
regulating G2—M cell cycle checkpoint (Yamane et al., 2003) based
upon the evidences that (i) both proteins have the BRCT motif; (ii)
both are strongly induced in S phase; (iii) both colocalize under
DNA damage conditions; (iv) both are phosphorylation targets of
ATM under DNA damage; and (v) double knockout of both had
signiﬁcant induction of cell death than each single knockout. Top2A
on the other hand has been found in the perturbation study (Bae
et al., 2005) to be signiﬁcantly downregulated by BRCAl siRNA
in both prostate (DU—145) and breast (MCF—7) cancer cell lines.

E2F1 (GENE116X, IMAGE2768260, G1/S E2F1 E2F trans—
cription factor 1 Hs.96055 AA424950 cell deathl cell cyclel cell
proliferationl transcription) is another interesting gene found in the
BRCA1 local network. BRCAl has been found previously as the
in vivo target of E2Fl in a transgenic mouse model (Wang et al.,
2000). Human BRCAl also contains the E2F binding site and its
promoter activity can be induced by 5—fold in cell lines when E2F1
is overexpressed (Bae et al., 2005).

From the above results, we can see that the BRCA1 network
is highly enriched for BRCAl—relevant genes supported by
independent published studies. Therefore, this network can be
used as a good resource for studying functions and mechanisms
of BRCAl’s role in breast cancer. To give an example, we
found that CKSl(GENE594X, IMAGE2703633, G2 CKSl CDC2—
Associated Protein CKSl Hs.77550 AA278629 cell cycle controll
cell proliferationl cell cycle controll cell cycle) connected directly
to BRCA1 and many of its neighbors such as pinin (GENE90X),
TUBA2 (GENE551X) and TOP2A (GENE548X) have been found
to be involved in breast cancer or functionally related to BRCAl.
Therefore, we can hypothesize that CKSl has putative connections
with BRCA1 and could be functionally involved in breast cancer
development. While no study was found by us to show a direct
connection between BRCA1 and CKSl, however, recent studies
have shown that overexpression of Cksl is strongly associated
with lymph node metastasis (Wang et al., 2009). Knockdown of
CKSl expression in MDA—MB—231 cells also inhibited its growth
and reduced cell migration and invasion abilities (Wang et al.,
2009). It is strongly suggested that CKSl is an oncogene playing
an important role in breast cancer development. Its connection to
BRCAl deserves further study and could potentially add to our
understanding of breast cancer development and treatment.

4 DISCUSSION

In this study, we integrated for the ﬁrst time a dynamic mechanistic
gene expression model with DBN analysis and demonstrated its
advantage against ODE—based model such as TSNI and DBN model
in Banjo when applied to ﬁne time series dataset of IRMA, as
shown in Table 1. We particularly noticed that the mutual connection
between Gal4 and Gal80 was not able to be recovered by any of
the methods discussed in Cantone et al. (2009). The connection
between these two genes is due to interactions between GAL4
and GAL80 proteins. Direct inference of these connections from
transcriptional proﬁles proved to be a challenge (Cantone et al.,
2009). However, integrating the dynamic model, i.e. using the
time differential to infer the connections, successfully uncovered
these two connections. Aijo et al. inferred the connections between
GAL4 and GAL80 too (Aijo and Lahdesmaki, 2010) using a
more complicated non—parametric kinetics model with a Gaussian
process approach. Therefore, it appears that the dynamic modeling
integration step empowered the subsequent DBN inference to infer
the subtle connections. These connections can only be inferred from
their derived dynamic properties such as the transcriptional rate in
our case. At the same time, the approach was also able to infer
other strong transcriptional regulations found by other approaches.
The current framework provided a way to incorporate more detailed
mechanistic understanding of transcriptional gene regulation by
modifying Equation (1).

Given the increasing availability of genome—scale measurements
such as proﬁling for mRNA and small RNA, it becomes more
and more important for network reconstruction algorithms to have
the capability to scale up to handle thousands of genes. DELDBN
adopted the local causal discovery algorithm that was introduced
by Tsamardino et al. (Alferis et al., 2010), which reduced the
complexity of the Bayesian network inference algorithm by reducing
the number of independency tests. DELDBN can be applied to large
size networks with thousands of genes and the computation can be
ﬁnished reasonably fast (order of hours) as has been tested during
the Human HeLa cell data analysis. The local DBN analysis gave an
approximate and faster solution to the dynamic problem as deﬁned
in Equation (1), which otherwise has to be solved in a much longer
time using more complex approaches such as the Gaussian process
(Aijo and Lahdesmaki, 2010).

In the current analysis, we assumed the ﬁrst order Markov chain
by modeling the expression of genes G at time T, G(T) as the a
function of its regulators R at the immediate previous time point,
T— l. The approach can be extended easily to allow more optional
time lags ‘L' with the following equation.

Xm'
d,” = Zﬂlpzj<t>+znjxja — r) (4)

The equation can be solved using same local DBN approach to
identify the MB of Xi from its history predecessors. However,
it increases the pool size of the potential regulator by allowing
more time lags. Although the ﬁrst order approximation worked
ﬁne with IRMA network, the actual time lag should be determined
carefully based upon knowledge on the experimental system under
investigation.

Time series data allowed the inference of causal effects relations
since the direction of regulation can only go from past to current
and then to the future events. Different approaches such as Granger
causality analysis and DBN analysis have been developed and

 

applied to gene regulatory network analysis. Granger causality
analysis has been applied to the same human HeLa cell data
previously (Mukhopadhyay and Chatterjee, 2007; Nagarajan and
Upreti, 2010). However in contrast to our study, no genes were found
to connect to BRCAl in these previous two studies. While in this
article, it has been shown that with DELDBN very relevant genes
can be identiﬁed in the local neighborhood of BRACl. Therefore,
DELDBN might have advantages for large network analysis over
other approaches.

Another advantage of DELDBN is its ﬂexibility to incorporate
prior knowledge into the learning process. For example, we can
restrict the connection from transcription factors to target genes by
only allowing predeﬁned transcription factors to be the regulators
in the right—hand side of Equation (1). We can also forbid certain
connections, e.g. A B, by excluding A from the pool of potential
regulators of B in Equation (1).

It should be noted that accurate dynamic proﬁles, e. g. transcription
rates, can only be estimated from ﬁne time series data with short
sampling time intervals. The IRMA time series data is an excellent
example of such kind with a sampling time interval of 10 min. The
accurate inference of dynamic properties is crucial to the following
DBN inference of the regulatory connections. Thus, the advantage
of the algorithm cannot be necessarily guaranteed when applying
to datasets with large time scales (on the order of hours). The
result from this study also provided an example of guidance on
experimental design for gene regulatory network inference. A time
interval of tens of minutes is recommended for dynamic network
inference based on this study.

A few other practical limitations should be considered when
applying DELDBN. First, sampling time intervals can be quite
different in many existing studies, thus a good strategy is needed
to decide on whether to use transcription rate or expression for
dynamic network inference. In the current study, we applied both
approaches and evaluated the network quality by comparing to gold
standard datasets to make the ﬁnal decision. As shown in the case
of IRMA network inference case, using transcription rate clearly
outperformed using expression data, and it validates the selection of
transcription rate. We also applied transcription rate to the human
HeLa cell cycle data and compared BRCAl subnetwork (File 2
in Supplementary Material, network BRCA1.2) to the one shown
in Section 3 which was inferred with expression data (File 2 in
Supplementary Material, network BRCAl). It was found that the
BRCA1.2 network was less signiﬁcantly enriched for the above—
mentioned gene categories. For example, none of the tubulin and
topoisoenzyme genes was found in BRCA1.2 network. Less number
of kinesin genes was found the BRCA1.2 network. Therefore, the
comparison validates the selection of using expression data for
network inference in this case. Second, data were often not sampled
densely enough to estimate accurate transcription rate. Moreover,
uneven timer intervals may be used in the sampling. The current
approach needs to be extended to accommodate these situations.
One candidate solution can be to increase the number of data
points by interpolation using smoothing spline ﬁlters with adjustable
smoothing parameters, as used in TSNI algorithm (Bansal et al.,
2006). After smoothing and interpolation, discrete time series data is
converted into continuous temporal data, which can then be sampled
evenly and densely enough to estimate the transcription rate in silico.
Third, we estimated the transcription rate using the backward Euler’s
method in this article with two time points. Other approaches such

as forward Euler’s method and three—point estimation can also be
used. These approaches need to be evaluated in different cases to
ﬁnd the most appropriate one for best network inference.

5 CONCLUSION

In conclusion, we have developed a new algorithm, differential
equation integrated local dynamic Bayesian network analysis
(DELDBN), for inference of large gene regulatory network from
time series data. By benchmarking on two experimental datasets,
IRMA and human HeLa cell cycle time series data, DELDBN
demonstrated signiﬁcant improvements over other approaches such
as DBN and Granger causality analysis on reconstructing networks
of both small and large sizes.

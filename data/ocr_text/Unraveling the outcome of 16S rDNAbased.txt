ABSTRACT

Motivation: 16S rDNA pyrosequencing is a powerful approach that
requires extensive usage of computational methods for delineating
microbial compositions. Previously, it was shown that outcomes of
studies relying on this approach vastly depend on the choice of pre-
processing and clustering algorithms used. However, obtaining in-
sights into the effects and accuracy of these algorithms is challenging
due to difficulties in generating samples of known composition with
high enough diversity. Here, we use in silico microbial datasets to
better understand how the experimental data are transformed into
taxonomic clusters by computational methods.

Results: We were able to qualitatively replicate the raw experimental
pyrosequencing data after rigorously adjusting existing simulation
software. This allowed us to simulate datasets of real-life complexity,
which we used to assess the influence and performance of two widely
used pre—processing methods along with 11 clustering algorithms. We
show that the choice, order and mode of the pre—processing methods
have a larger impact on the accuracy of the clustering pipeline than the
clustering methods themselves. Without pre—processing, the differ-
ence between the performances of clustering methods is large.
Depending on the clustering algorithm, the most optimal analysis pipe-
line resulted in significant underestimations of the expected number of
clusters (minimum: 3.4%; maximum: 13.6%), allowing us to make
quantitative estimations of the bacterial complexity of real microbiome
samples.

1 INTRODUCTION

Rapidly improving next- generation sequencing technologies have
rendered 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing a standard approach
to explore the composition and dynamics of complex microbial
communities Moo et al., 2008). The accurate identiﬁcation
of bacteria and discovery of new species with this approach
help describe, in unprecedented detail, the hitherto unknown
biodiversity in environments such as ocean water (Kirchman

et al., 2010) and soil (Roesch et al., 2007). On a broader scale,
simultaneous sequencing of internal transcribed spacer regions,
16S and 18S rDNA amplicons has led to the successful charac-
terization of bacterial, archaeal and eukaryotic microorganisms
(Kittelmann et al., 2013; Somboonna et al., 2012). Within a clin-
ical context, this technique provides novel insights into the rela-
tionship between the health status of the host and associated
microbiome, for example, the human gut (Le Chatelier et al.,
2013) or oral cavity (Crielaard et al., 2011).

A typical 16S rDNA-based proﬁling study involves PCR amp-
liﬁcation of one or more hypervariable regions (HVRs) of mi-
crobial 16S rRNA genes, followed by massively parallel
sequencing. Because incomplete 16S rDNA databases limit ref-
erence-based taxonomic classiﬁcation (Sun et al., 2012), a
common approach is to perform a taxonomy-independent ana-
lysis (TIA), where the sequences (reads) are compared with each
other and are clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs;
conventionally 97% similarity for species-level clustering). The
number and sizes of the resulting OTUs describe the diversity in
the sample.

Among next-generation sequencing platforms that are suitable
for amplicon sequencing, 454 pyrosequencing has possibly been
the most popular technique due to its relatively long reads and
sufﬁcient sampling depth (Siqueira et al., 2012; Tamaki et al.,
2011). Nevertheless, sample diversity and structure estimates
based on this procedure are affected by a number of factors,
including the DNA extraction method (Sergeant et al., 2012),
choice of primers (Klindworth et al., 2013), copy number vari-
ation (Kembel et al., 2012), presence of chimeric (Haas et al.,
2011) or non-target sequences (Hartmann et al., 2010), sequen-
cing errors (Kunin et al., 2010), and OTU clustering (Huse et al.,
2010). Among these, detecting chimeric sequences (Edgar et al.,
2011) and correcting sequencing errors (Quince et al., 2011;
Reeder and Knight, 2010) have perhaps been the most success-
fully addressed issues by computational means, resulting in a
number of algorithms for data pre-processing that incorporate
these corrective steps. The removal of such artifacts is key
to avoiding accumulation of spurious records in databases
(Hugenholtz and Huber, 2003). More importantly, recent studies
stress the necessity of data pre-treatment by pointing out that
diversity estimates differ orders of magnitude depending on the
pre-processing procedure used (Bonder et al., 2012; Schloss et al.,
2011). However, conclusive reports on how these methods work

on a representative scale are limited due to the absence of ground
truth in complex environmental datasets.

Following pre-processing, accurate clustering of reads into
OTUs facilitates the recovery of the community composition in
the sample. However, numerous clustering methods used for
TIA, such as single linkage or furthest linkage hierarchical clus-
tering (Huse et al., 2010), have been reported to yield consider-
ably different results, and even small changes in algorithm
parameters within individual methods can lead to vast differ-
ences (White et al., 2010). In addition, differences in clustering
algorithms, such as different criteria for the ordering of input
sequences or the calculation of distance matrices, are likely to
yield different clustering outcomes.

The evaluation of the various data treatment and clustering
methods and their use on real datasets have hitherto been limited
to in vitra mock studies, where sample diversities are typically (at
least) an order of magnitude less compared with those in real-life
situations. Such limitations of in vitra studies have led to the de-
velopment of simulation software, such as MetaSim (Richter
et al., 2008) and Grinder (Angly et al., 2012), which are capable
of generating complex sequence datasets. These packages, which
do not produce the 454-speciﬁc standard ﬂowgram format, can
be complemented by FlowSim (Balzer et al., 2010) or 454Sim
(Lysholm et al., 2011) to simulate ﬂowgrams (the pyrosequencing
output). Nevertheless, some aspects of 16S rDNA pyrosequen-
cing are not amenable to implementation in simulations or
cannot be incorporated at all. These include PCR efﬁciency,
primer bias, 16S rDNA copy number variation and realistic
read quality scores.

Here, using in silica datasets, we aimed to provide an inde-
pendent assessment of the accuracy and effects of computational
techniques on delineating compositions of complex microbial
communities using 16S rDNA pyrosequencing. We analyzed
two low-complexity experimental datasets and derived data char-
acteristics, which were then used to simulate datasets that are
likely to mimic real-life complexity. We applied two widely
used data pre-processing tools followed by 11 clustering algo-
rithms on these datasets, and evaluated the accuracy of the re-
sulting clusters using the normalized mutual information (NMI)
score and the number of OTUs formed. The overall experimental
design is shown in Figure 1. We show that pre-processing meth-
ods have a larger impact on the results of the TIA pipeline than
the clustering methods themselves. Without pre-processing, clus-
tering methods were found to yield considerably different out-
comes. The workﬂow that yielded the best agreement with the
expected number of clusters resulted in signiﬁcant underestima-
tions of the expected number of OTUs, depending on the clus-
tering algorithm used. We conclude with a discussion on how
these new ﬁndings can be projected to earlier studies that
describe the microbial complexity in human saliva samples.

2 METHODS

2.1 In vitra datasets

We studied two GS-FLX Titanium datasets, hereafter referred to as
Mock-I and Mock-II, from a mock community of 15 oral bacteria. For
both sequencing runs, the V5—V7 HVR of the 16S rDNA was ampliﬁed
using the forward primer 785F (GGATTAGATACCCBRGTAGTC)
and the reverse primer 1175R (ACGTCRTCCCCDCCTTCCTC)

Fig. 1. Flow diagram of the study design. Two in vitra datasets were
analyzed and the resulting statistics were used in simulations to replicate
one of these datasets (gray), as well as to generate datasets of real-life
complexity (black). Different pre-processing approaches and clustering
algorithms were evaluated in a combinatorial way by calculating the
NMI score and the number of clusters formed. The computational pipe-
line applies to COREI and COREZ datasets

(Kraneveld et al., 2012). The reference 16S rDNA sequences were down-
loaded from the SILVA SSU 16S rRNA database v111 (Quast ei al.,
2013). The presence of three different 16S rDNA copies in the database
for one of the 15 species led to the retrieval of 17 non-redundant reference
sequences.

2.2 Analysis of in vitra mock datasets

2.2.] Quality ﬁltering The reads were demultiplexed using QIIME
v1.5.0 (Caporaso et al., 2010) with the ‘truncate_remove’ option for
reverse primer removal. Two mismatches to both primers and zero mis-
matches to the barcode were allowed. No ﬁltering was performed based
on quality scores, read length, homopolymer region length or the number
of ambiguous bases. The read length distribution was calculated by
demultiplexing without primer removal.

2.2.2 Chimera detection After quality ﬁltering, the set of true chi-
meras was approximated by identifying a set of high-conﬁdence chimeras,
as previously described by Schloss et al. (2011), using the seq.error (here-
after referred to as SEQERR) routine in mothur v1.25.0 (Schloss et al.,
2009). The SEQERR method is applicable only to datasets where the
reference sequences from which the reads originated are known. We
used USEARCH UCHIME v6.1.544 (Edgar et al., 2011), an algorithm
that is widely used for datasets of unknown composition, to identify
putative chimeras. The union set of chimeras detected by the de nova
and reference-based chimera detection modes of UCHIME was taken
as the ﬁnal list of putative chimeras. Reads were ﬁrst dereplicated
(derep_fulllength), otherwise default parameters were used. The reference
database (primers removed) used for the reference-based mode was pro-
duced by in Silica ampliﬁcation of the SILVA SSU 16S rRNA database
v1 11 using the 785F and 1175R primers (allowing for one mismatch). The
sensitivity and speciﬁcity of UCHIME chimera detection in in vitra sets

were evaluated based on the set of high-conﬁdence chimeras identiﬁed by
SEQERR.

2.2.3 Error analysis ( in vitra reads) Error rates were calculated
using the non-chimeric reads only. To determine the reference sequences
of these reads and their relative abundance, chimeras detected by
SEQERR were removed from the datasets and the remaining reads (pri-
mers removed) were queried against the set of reference sequences using
BLASTN (Altschul et al., 1990, 1997) with a minimum similarity thresh-
old of 80%. Reads that were mapped to a reference with a unique top
score were then globally aligned to their parents using the needle program
in EMBOSS v6.5.7 (Rice et al., 2000). Global alignments were truncated
to discard the end gaps. The error rate per base for insertions, deletions,
substitutions and ambiguous base calls was normalized by dividing the
number of occurrences of each error type by the sum of truncated (pair-
wise) alignment lengths of all reads. The overall error rate per base for
mismatches was calculated as the sum of error rate per base for each error

type.

2.3 Simulations

First, the Mock-I-sim dataset was generated to replicate the in vitro
Mock-I dataset as closely as possible. After establishing the in silica re-
producibility of the in vitro data properties, two groups of composition-
ally more complex datasets, collectively referred to as CORE-Sim, were
simulated. Below, we ﬁrst detail the methods shared by Mock-I—sim and
CORE-Sim simulations and then describe these individually.

2.3.1 In silica dataset generation Grinder v0.5.3 (Angly et al., 2012)
was used to simulate the PCR ampliﬁcation of full-length W5—V7) non-
chimeric amplicons based on a given total read count and a relative
abundance proﬁle for the reference sequences. The percentage of non-
erroneous reads in Mock-I after quality ﬁltering, which was 66% of non-
chimeric reads, was approximated by merging two Grinder-produced
datasets: a dataset of amplicons with unifome distributed substitution
errors and another dataset with non-erroneous amplicons (6.2 and 93.8%
of Grinder reads, respectively). Further errors were subsequently intro-
duced by 454Sim as described below. Chimeras that constitute 14.5% of
all reads in the datasets, in the form of birneras, trimeras and quadmeras,
were generated using CHSIM (Edgar et al., 2011), based on a slightly
modiﬁed n-mera state distribution (bi:81%, tri:18.7% and quad: 0.3%)
reported in Quince et al. (2011). The relative abundance of chimeras for
each top-parent similarity interval between 89 and 99% was modeled to
have a linear increase from 0.05 to 0.15 (e.g. 5% of all chimeras were
89—90% similar to their top-parents). The relative abundance of a given
parent (reference) sequence in the CHSIM input was assigned the same as
that in the Grinder-generated amplicons. Next, Grinder and CHSIM
reads were used as input for 454Sim v1.04 (Lysholm et al., 2011) to
generate the corresponding ﬂowgrams, which included further insertion
and deletion errors. The 454Sim parameters that control the read lengths,
homopolymer model for positive ﬂows, and degeneration of positive
and negative ﬂows, were manually tuned to obtain a comparable length
distribution and error rates to those of the Mock-I dataset.

2.3.2 Mack-I—sim: simulation of I5—species mack dataset The ref-
erence sequences of in vitro mock species and their relative abundances
found in Mock-I were used in Grinder to simulate 34172 full-length and
non-chimeric amplicons, of which 32047 (93.8 %) did not contain any
errors, while the remainder contained 0.72% substitution errors on aver-
age. In accordance with the abundance of chimeric sequences detected by
SEQERR in Mock-I, 5786 chimeras were simulated using CHSIM.
Finally, a FASTA ﬁle of 39 958 reads was processed with 454Sim to
obtain ﬂowgrams. To analyze the errors, reads were quality-ﬁltered/
demultiplexed in QIIME by removing primers (‘truncate_remove’
option) and true chimeras, known by their read labels, were discarded.

The remaining non-chimeric reads were aligned to the reference sequences
from which they were generated by the needle program, and error rates
were calculated as described above for in vitro datasets (Section 2.2).
In addition, to investigate the inﬂuence of the pre-processing order, the
putative chimeras were identiﬁed by UCHIME (Section 2.2), without or
with denoising the reads using denoiser (Reeder and Knight, 2010). For
both treatments, the performance of UCHIME was calculated based on
the set of simulated chimeras that remained after quality ﬁltering.

2.3.3 Complex mack dataset simulations (CORE-sim) CORE
v2012-02-09 (Griffen et al., 2011), an oral microbiome database of 1159
phylogenetically curated 16S rDNA sequences, was ampliﬁed in silico
using TaxMan (Brandt et al., 2012) with the 785F and 1175R primers
(no mismatches allowed). Sequences containing ambiguous bases or more
than one unique taxonomic lineage in their headers were discarded. The
thus ﬁltered CORE database (COREI) contained 672 amplicons from
447 taxonomic lineages (447 species; 139 genera). Next, we constructed
a second database in which each taxonomic lineage contained only one
amplicon, and then used alignments constructed by the needle program
(Rice et al., 2000) to remove all amplicons that had (based on the shorter
sequence) 297% similarity to any other sequence. This second database
(COREZ) contained 292 sequences from 292 taxonomic lineages (292
species; 126 genera). When present, the subspecies part of a lineage
label (starting with ‘subsp.’) was removed (for CORE1 and COREZ).

Simulations For each database (CORE1 and COREZ), 50 composition-
ally different datasets were generated. To obtain ~200 OTUs for each
dataset at a 97% similarity threshold, 250 (COREI) or 200 (COREZ)
reference sequences were randomly drawn from their respective data-
bases. For each dataset, ~40 000 reads were simulated, as for Mock-I-
sim (see Section 2.3.2). However, in this case, the relative abundances of
the sequences were randomly assigned using a powerlaw distribution with
parameter 0.4 (Grinder). Reads were quality ﬁltered (QIIME) using the
following options: reverse primer removal: ‘truncate_only’; minimum
sequence length: 150; ambiguous bases: 0; maximum homopolymer
run: 6nt; one forward and two reverse primer mismatches; a minimum
quality score of 25; sliding window: 50; and zero barcode errors. Next, the
reads were pre-processed in ﬁve different ways: no cleaning (NC),
denoised (D), chimera checked (CC), denoised and chimera checked
(DCC) and chimera checked and denoised (CCD).

Clustering After each pre-processing approach, the remaining reads
were clustered at a 97% similarity threshold with 11 different clustering
algorithms with their default parameters: CD-HIT v3.1.1 (Li and Godzik,
2006), DNACLUST parallel release 2 (option: -1) (Ghodsi et al., 2011),
ESPRIT-Tree 64-bit v11152011 (Cai and Sun, 2011), UCLUST v1.2.22q
(Edgar, 2010), USEARCH v6.1.544 (Edgar, 2010), CLUSTOM v0.10
(Hwang et al., 2013), TBC version January 31, 2011 (Lee et al., 2012),
CROP v1.33 (options: -e 4400 -s -m 20 -z 400 -r 2 -b int[#uniq sequences/
50+0.5]) (Hao et al., 2011), M-pick (-f 1) Wang et al., 2013), swarm
v1.2.2 (-d 11; https://github.com/torognes/swarm) and CRUNCHCLUST
v43 (-strict -min 0 -max 1000 -keep_n -diff 11 -d_hl -noendgaps)
(Hartmann et al., 2012). USEARCH was also evaluated with options
‘maxaccepts’ and ‘maxrejects’ set to zero (referred to as USEARCH
Optimal). Before clustering with USEARCH and swarm, the reads
were dereplicated, sorted by abundance and sequence length. In the
case of M-pick, the reads were dereplicated and randomly shufﬂed to
avoid crashes during clustering. To improve its memory usage, some
code changes that do not inﬂuence the clustering output were made
in the M-pick package (see the patch ﬁle at http://www.ibi.vu.nl/
downloads).

To obtain ground truths for the clustering algorithms, non-erroneous
datasets (50 for COREI and 50 for COREZ) were generated, which con-
tained only the complete V5—V7 reference sequences of non-chimeric
reads (primers removed). These non-chimeric and non-erroneous reads
were clustered using each algorithm to obtain the ‘reference clusterings’.
For evaluating the clustering results of COREZ simulations, the reference

number of OTUs for each algorithm was derived from its corresponding
reference clustering, whereas the number of expected OTUs (due to 97%
ﬁltering) was 200.

The clustering accuracy was evaluated by calculating the number of
OTUs and the NMI score (Bonder et al., 2012). The NMI score is pena-
lized when sequences of the same label are assigned to different clusters,
as well as when sequences of different labels are assigned to the same
cluster (Cai and Sun, 2011). The NMI score was calculated at both the
species and genus level, where taxonomic lineage labels, which were used
as the ground truth, were taken from Grinder sequence headers for non-
chirneric reads. For chimeras, the lineage of the parent species with the
highest similarity to the chimeric read was taken from the CHSIM read
headers.

3 RESULTS

We ﬁrst analyzed two in vitra datasets from a small mock com-
munity. Using simulation packages, we then replicated this mock
community in silica and compared the results with the in vitra
data. After verifying that the simulation parameters were set
appropriately, we simulated two groups of more complex data-
sets to uncover the effects and accuracy of computational meth-
ods on a realistic scale (Fig. l).

3.1 In vitra mock datasets

3.1.] Error rate estimation To determine a set of primary data
attributes required for simulations, we analyzed two in vitra data-
sets derived from pyrosequencing 16S rDNA (V5—V7 HVR)
from a mock community of 15 oral microbes. First, we deter-
mined the rate of substitution, deletion and insertion errors. For
pyrosequencing, one typically expects the substitution rate to be
much lower than insertion and deletion rates, as the main cause
of errors is over- and undercalls in homopolymer runs (Balzer
et al., 2010). However, error analysis of non-chimeric reads in
both Mock-I and Mock-II datasets resulted in suspiciously high
ratios of substitution errors to insertion and deletion errors.
Moreover, the rates of substitutions were 10-fold higher than
the reported rates (Gilles et al., 2011).

The high substitution error rates were identiﬁed to be caused
by (i) non-speciﬁc binding at degenerate primer positions and (ii)
the absence of seven (unknown) variant sequences in the refer-
ence database, which contained single nucleotide mismatches at
one or two positions with respect to their original database ref-
erences (Fig. 2). These variants were conﬁrmed by Sanger
sequencing of newly produced amplicons, starting from genomic
DNA. Consecutively, they were added to the initial reference
database of 17 sequences. In addition, spurious reads were iden-
tiﬁed by clustering the denoised non-chimeric reads using
UCLUST. Eight spurious OTUs were detected in both datasets
and were considered contaminants on manual inspection, leading
to the removal of their members (45 reads in Mock-I and 36
reads in Mock-II).

The ﬁnal error rates were calculated using the contaminant-
free datasets with the updated reference database. An overall
error rate per base of 0.14% for Mock-I and 0.12% for Mock-
II was found for the non-chimeric reads (Table 1). More than
half the reads in both datasets were entirely error-free (66% in
Mock-I and 74% in Mock-II, see Supplementary Fig. S1 for the
error distribution).

3.1.2 Estimating the abundance of chimeras 16S rDNA pyrose-
quencing includes a PCR ampliﬁcation step prior to sequencing,
resulting in the formation of a signiﬁcant number of chimeras,
which can be more than 45% of all reads (Haas et al., 2011). Any
realistic computational taxonomy analysis pipeline working with
such datasets is required to address this issue. To determine the
abundance of chimeric sequences, SEQERR and UCHIME al-
gorithms were separately applied to Mock-I and Mock-II data-
sets. Using SEQERR, 14.5% (Mock-I) and 17.6% (Mock-II) of
the raw reads were found to be chimeric (Table l). The perform-
ance of UCHIME was evaluated on the basis of these sets of
high-conﬁdence chimeras detected by SEQERR. The sensitivity,
precision and speciﬁcity of UCHIME in both datasets were
found to be ~0.92, 0.98 and 1.00 (Supplementary Table S1).

3.2 In silica mock datasets

3.2.1 Mack-I—sim simulations Using the read length distribu-
tion, the abundance and forms of chimeric sequences, and the
rate of errors found in the in vitra Mock-I dataset, we ﬁrst
replicated the Mock-I datasets in silica. Mock-I—sim, the result-
ing dataset, contained 39 600 reads after quality ﬁltering, of
which 5761 were chimeras generated by CHSIM. The length
distribution of reads in Mock-I-sim and Mock-I were almost in
complete agreement (Supplementary Fig. S2). The overall error
rate in reads when simulated chimeras were discarded was the
same as in non-chimeric Mock-I reads (0.14%, Table l), and
the distribution of these errors over the dataset was found to
be similar to Mock-I and Mock-II (Supplementary Fig. S1). In
addition, the overall error rate in reads after chimeras identi-
ﬁed by UCHIME were ﬁltered out, as well as UCHIME’s
performance in terms of sensitivity (0.96) and speciﬁcity
(1.00), was very similar to the values obtained for Mock-I

(Supplementary Table S1). We note that achieving such resem-
blance between Mock-I and Mock-I-sim datasets was possible
only after extensive re-parameterization of Grinder, CHSIM
and 454Sim packages and adjustments in several parts of the
simulation pipeline.

To determine the effects of the order of the pre-processing
steps, chimera checking was performed separately on denoised
and non-denoised datasets, using the de nava and reference-based
modes of UCHIME. The latter mode outperformed the ﬁrst in
terms of sensitivity, an outcome that was more pronounced on
non-denoised sequences (Table 2). Taking the union set of chi-
meras detected by the two modes resulted in an improved sensi-
tivity in chimera detection and did not inﬂate the number of
false-positive chimeras.

When the reads were denoised prior to chimera checking, the
majority of chimeric sequences with high similarity to their par-
ents were altered by denoising. These reads with altered se-
quences were not detected as chimeras by UCHIME, resulting
in a >40% decrease in UCHIME’s sensitivity with respect to the
original read labels (Table 2, DCC approach). However, these
denoised chimeras did not inﬂate the diversity estimation, as
clustering the reads using UCLUST did not yield any unexpected
OTUs. Indeed, chimeric sequences with high parent similarity are
likely to be denoised to a non-chimeric state.

3.2.2 CORE-sim simulations Having been able to replicate the
in vitro Mock-I dataset in considerable detail, we extended the
simulations to generate datasets of more realistic diversity. To
obtain two reference databases of different compositional prop-
erties, CORE1 and COREZ were derived from the CORE oral
microbiome database (see Section 2.3.3). CORE1 contained
amplicons that are >97% similar to each other, as well as differ-
ent amplicons from the same taxonomic lineage. To probe the
limitations of a database with such properties, the CORE data-
base was constructed, where the reference sequences were <97%
similar to each other and had unique taxonomic lineages. Using
each database, 50 representative datasets of ~40 000 amplicons
were simulated from randomly selected reference sequences. To
assess the taxonomy analysis pipeline, each dataset was pre-pro-
cessed in ﬁve different ways: no cleaning (NC), denoised (D),
chimera checked (CC), denoised and chimera checked (DCC)
and chimera checked and denoised (CCD). The resulting reads
were clustered separately by 11 clustering algorithms at a 97%
similarity threshold. CRUNCHLUST and swarm do not use
percentage similarity, but Levenshtein distance. We set this par-
ameter to 11 based on the average read length (368 nt) and 3%
divergence. The clusters were evaluated by calculating the NMI
score and the number of OTUs. For each simulated dataset, a
non-erroneous dataset was created by discarding chimeric reads

16$ rDNA-based taxonomy analysis through mock data and simulations

 

and replacing the erroneous reads with the non-erroneous refer-
ence amplicon sequences from which they originated.
These datasets were used to obtain reference clusterings for
each clustering algorithm. Additionally, we set the number of
expected OTUs to 200 for COREZ simulations because the se-
quences in CORE2 are <97% similar to each other.

The distinctive compositions of CORE1 and COREZ databases
are reﬂected in the clustering results. In simulations performed
using the CORE database, OTUs formed by clustering the non-
erroneous (reference) datasets resulted in species-level NMI
scores between 0.93 and 0.97 (Fig. 3A). This outcome is expected
when amplicons from different taxonomic lineages that are
297% similar to each other cluster together. In contrast, the
average NMI score per clustering algorithm for non-erroneous
datasets in COREZ simulations ranged between 0.98 and 1.00
(Fig. 3B), indicating that almost all reads were correctly clustered
when reads with different taxonomic labels were <97% similar to
each other. Likewise, for all COREZ datasets, a given clustering
algorithm produced more consistent numbers of OTUs than in
CORE1 datasets. The variance in the number of OTUs formed
by the clustering algorithms for the reference datasets also shows
the difference between these databases (Fig. 3E and F).

At species level (Fig. 3A and B), clustering algorithms expect-
edly yielded higher NMI scores when clustering the non-
erroneous datasets than the pre-processed datasets. At genus
level, however, denoising followed by chimera checking (CCD),
as well as chimera checking followed by denoising (DCC) re-
sulted in NMI scores higher than reference clusterings (Fig. 3C
and D). This was found to be a consequence of denoising, where
sequences of different species of the same genus, which were not
assigned to the same cluster at a 97% similarity threshold in
reference clusterings, were clustered together in the case of the
DCC and CCD approaches. Correspondingly, the number of
OTUs formed by sequences of the same genus in the reference
clusterings was higher than the number of OTUs formed by the
DCC and CCD approaches. This also explains why all clustering
algorithms (applied after DCC or CCD) underestimate the
number of expected OTUs: denoising decreases the divergence
of very similar sequences (Fig. 3E and F). When the average
number of OTUs for the 50 CORE2 simulations (per algorithm)
after the CCD pre-processing approach is considered, the largest
diversity underestimation with respect to the number of expected
OTUs (200) was observed with CROP (13.6%), whereas
DNACLUST, USEARCH, USEARCH Optimal and swarm
provided the smallest underestimation (3.4%). When the same
comparison is performed between the average number of OTUs
obtained in the reference clusterings and after the CCD ap-
proach, CLUSTOM yielded the largest overestimation (4.2%),
whereas CRUNCHCLUST resulted in the smallest underestima-
tion (1.7%), suggesting that CRUNCHCLUST is rather robust
against the remaining noise. CROP resulted in a 2.9% overesti-
mation of the number of OTUs obtained in the reference clus-
tering (173 versus 168 OTUs). The run times of the clustering
algorithms are given in Supplementary Table S2.

The NC approach resulted in the lowest NMI scores along
with diversity overestimations as high as 20-fold (Fig. 3E and
F), conﬁrming earlier clusterings (Bonder et al., 2012). Chimera
checking or denoising alone was insufﬁcient to obtain accurate
clustering. The removal of chimeras was the most important step

because the clustering accuracy deteriorated far more by the pres-
ence of low-parent similarity chimeras (D) than by the occurrence
of erroneous reads (CC). The low error rate in the NC sequences
and successful chimera removal by UCHIME gave rise to high
NMI scores in the CC approach. This is especially salient in
CORE2 simulations, where achieving a good agreement with
ground truth labels is more likely because reference sequences in
these simulations were at least 3% distant from each other,
making inaccurate clustering due to sequence errors less probable.

The best agreement with the number of OTUs formed in
reference clusterings was obtained by the DCC and CCD
approaches. Although hardly any difference was observed in
the number of OTUs formed between the two approaches, the
clusters formed using the latter approach showed consistently
higher NMI scores. This was due to a large portion (~10%) of
undetected chimeras in the DCC approach: denoising not only
converted the chimeras into non-chimeric sequences but also re-
sulted in disagreements between the non-detected chimeras and
their taxonomic labels. We observed the same denoising effect
for undetected chimeras in the CCD approach; however, because
their number was substantially lower (~10-fold), the NMI score
was not affected.

The differences (NMI scores and number of OTUs) between
the various clustering algorithms became less pronounced when
they were applied after denoising (D, DCC, CCD). Four excep-
tions here were CLUSTOM, CRUNCHCLUST, CROP and
M-pick, which in both CORE1 and COREZ simulations resulted
in slightly lower species-level NMI scores than other algorithms,
whereas at genus level they achieved slightly higher NMI scores.
Along with these, the relatively small number of OTUs formed
by CLUSTOM and CROP, especially for NC datasets, is indi-
cative of over-clustering, which in this case occurs when
sequences from two species of the same genus with <97% simi-
larity are assigned to the same cluster. In contrast, clustering by
ESPRIT-Tree and TBC resulted in consistently higher species-
and genus-level NMI scores after NC and CC approaches, as
well as good estimations of the reference number of OTUs after
the DCC and CCD approaches.

4 DISCUSSION

Pre-processing and clustering are two major steps in the analysis
of pyrosequenced 16S rDNA amplicons, which have a dramatic
inﬂuence on the accuracy of downstream efforts such as diversity
estimation. In this study, we aimed to improve our understand-
ing of how these methods transform the sequencing datasets
into community proﬁles. To this end, we analyzed data from
two pyrosequencing runs that were performed for a 15-species
mock microbial community. Data properties derived from these
analyses were adapted in computer simulations to overcome the
main shortcoming of in vitro studies, namely, the absence of
ground truth. Error rates, error distributions, read length distri-
butions, and percentage of chimeras are good examples of basic
data features that can be incorporated in silica. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study where such characteristics of a
given pyrosequencing dataset are replicated with high precision
in the raw experimental output (ﬂowgrams). This, for example,
resulted in similar chimera detection sensitivity for in vitro Mock-
I and in silica Mock-I—sim data.

16$ rDNA-based taxonomy analysis through mock data and simulations

 

The sequencing error rate (0.14%) in our in vitro and simu-
lated datasets is low compared with other reported values, such
as 1.07% (Gilles et al., 2011) or 0.61% (Schloss et al., 2011). This
may appear to be limiting the resolution at which the perform-
ance of different clustering algorithms can be compared for the
pre-processing approaches that include denoising. Other than
CLUSTOM and CROP, there was no prominent difference
between the outcomes of different algorithms in the DCC and
CCD approaches, and they all yielded underestimations of
the expected number of OTUs [minimum (min): 3.4% with
CCD-swarm; maximum (max): 13.7% with DCC-CROP for
COREZ, averaged over all 50 simulations]. Highly erroneous
COREZ simulations with a 6-fold higher error rate (0.86%) did
not help differentiate between clustering methods when denoising
was applied either (results not shown). In this case, all methods
excluding CLUSTOM, CRUNCHCLUST and CROP yielded a
small (min: 0.7% DCC-TBC; max: 5.8% CCD-USEACH), but
signiﬁcant, overestimation of the expected number of OTUs
(200) instead of an underestimation (M-pick could not be
included due to its large memory requirement). These ﬁndings
suggest that studies where accurate estimations of the sample
complexity is of crucial importance should include a thorough
analysis to appropriately adjust the sequence/ﬂowgram similarity
thresholds used for denoising, preferably with the guidance of an
experimental mock dataset, to avoid over- or underestimations.
This is supported by an earlier study (Gaspar and Thomas,
2013), which thoroughly examined the spectrum of changes
caused by a variety of pyrosequencing noise-removal tools. The
authors report that some of these changes were inconsistent with
removing noise and could potentially lead to undesired outcomes
such as removing rare variants. Similarly, Bakker et al. (2012)
provide a discussion on the effects of subsampling and error
correction, where they observed the loss of rare OTUs as a
denoising outcome. Because the datasets used in both studies
are derived from environmental samples lacking a ground
truth, results presented here can be regarded as complementary
with respect to such earlier predictive conclusions.

Recently, Bonder et al. (2012) analyzed the diversity in human
saliva samples using a taxonomy-independent approach. After
denoising, chimera checking and clustering with ESPRIT-Tree,
they reported 306 OTUs. In our 50 simulated datasets of closely
related sequences (COREI), DCC followed by ESPRIT-Tree
clustering, on average, yielded a 6.0% underestimation of the
sample diversity (min: 1.3%; max: 12.1%). In 50 simulations
of more divergent sequences (COREZ), the same approach re-
sulted in a 4.2% underestimation on average (min: 1.0%; max:
7.0%). When our in silica ﬁndings are projected on the results
reported by Bonder et al., we predict the microbial diversity in
this saliva dataset to be slightly higher, namely, between 319 and
326 OTUs.

Although we did not observe major differences in the perform-
ance of different clustering algorithms after the DCC and CCD
approaches, the NC and CC approaches, as well as the calcula-
tion of the NMI scores at different taxonomic levels, provide
useful information for the comparison of different clustering
methods. An indication of accurate clustering is a high NMI
score at both the species and genus level for a given dataset.
A method that clusters sequences at similarity thresholds that
are lower than a speciﬁed value (e. g. 97%) will have a high

NMI score at genus level, whereas the species-level NMI score
will be low. When the CORE-sim results are evaluated in this
context, ESPRIT-Tree and TBC are identiﬁed as the two best
clustering algorithms of the 11 considered in this study. They
consistently achieved the highest NMI scores at both taxonomic
levels in pre-processing approaches that do not include denois-
ing, while simultaneously providing very close approximations
after the DCC or CCD treatments to the reference number of
OTUs.

Here, we assessed different data pre-processing strategies in
combination with several clustering algorithms that are com-
monly used in taxonomy analysis. Based on our as well as pre-
vious results (Bonder et al., 2012; Schloss et al., 2011), we suggest
an analysis workﬂow, which (after quality ﬁltering) starts with
chimera removal. We showed that the most accurate chimera
detection is obtained when the union of chimeras detected by
UCHIME de nava and reference-based modes are taken, where
the reference database should be extensive, quality checked [e. g.
SILVA (Quast et al., 2013) or Greengenes (DeSantis et al., 2006)]
and preferably trimmed to the HVR of interest (Brandt et al.,
2012). As the current UCHIME algorithm is remarkably fast,
chimera checking can be performed before denoising, resulting in
2-fold shorter denoising time due to the reduction in unique
ﬂowgrams after chimera removal. The resulting reads should
be corrected for sequencing errors, preferably with a denoising
algorithm that is ﬁne-tuned for the error rate that is speciﬁc to
the dataset. The chimera-checked and denoised reads can be
clustered with ESPRIT-Tree, TBC or a signiﬁcantly faster clus-
tering algorithm such as USEARCH or swarm in the case of
run-time constraints.

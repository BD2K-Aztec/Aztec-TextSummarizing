ABSTRACT

Summary: Systematic studies of drug repositioning require the inte-
gration of multi-level drug data, including basic chemical information
(such as SMILES), drug targets, target-related signaling pathways,
clinical trial information and Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-
approval information, to predict new potential indications of existing
drugs. Currently available databases, however, lack query support for
multi-Ievel drug information and thus are not designed to support drug
repositioning studies. DrugMap Central (DMC), an online tool, is
developed to help fill the gap. DMC enables the users to integrate,
query, visualize, interrogate, and download multi-level data of known
drugs or compounds quickly for drug repositioning studies all within
one system.

Availability: DMC is accessible at http://r2d2drug.org/DMC.ast.

1 INTRODUCTION

Drug repositioning has emerged as a cost-effective and time-
efﬁcient strategy to find new indications for old drugs
(Ashburn and Thor, 2004; Iorio et al., 2010; Jin et al., 2012;
Sirota et al., 2011). Because development of a new drug is time
consuming (~l2—15 years), expensive (>$l billion), and has a low
success rate (between 1/10 000 and 1/5000), researchers are
applying more systematic approaches to address new treatment
opportunities by using the available multi-level data and infor-
mation of known drugs, including their chemical structures, tar-
gets, target-related signaling pathways, clinical trial information
and FDA-approval information. Several available databases
have been developed for the aim of supporting drug reposition-
ing research, including PharmDB (http://pharmdb.org),
PROMISCUOUS (von Eichborn et al., 2011) and DrugPredict
(Simon et al., 2012).

However, clinical trial and FDA-approval information as well
as signaling pathway information are often missing from these
available drug-repositioning databases. It is inconvenient and
time-consuming for researchers without any pharmacological
background to interrogate and assimilate these multi-level drug
data distributed across different data sources for drug reposition-
ing studies. Moreover, these data often do not share consistent
entry names. When a speciﬁc biological question is asked, e.g.
which drugs that are not in clinical trial phase II or later phases
target on the HER2 pathway, the researcher has to go to differ-
ent databases to check the data of clinical trials, targets and
pathways. In this article, we present a united data source,
DrugMap Central (DMC), with online visualization interfaces
to query and search the integrated drug data quickly.
Furthermore, DMC integrates the standardized disease informa-
tion from MeSH (http://www.n1m.nih.gov/mesh/) into clinical
trial and FDA-approval information to facilitate checking
known disease information of drugs or compounds for drug
repositioning studies. The unique multi-level drug data with visu-
alization interfaces are available at http://r2d2drug.org/DMC.
ast with testing demos.

2 METHODS

We collected the multi-level drug data from a variety of public databases
by using Python based codes. The basic drug information, such as chem-
ical structures and targets, was collected from three data sources—
Drugbank (Knox et al., 2011), PharmGKB (Hewett et al., 2002) and
TTD (Chen et al., 2002), and uses the chemical IDs curated from
PubChem. The signaling pathway data were derived from three data-
bases—KEGG (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000) (only data prior to 2011 avail-
able), PID (Schaefer et al., 2009) and BioCarta (http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/
Pathways/BioCarta_Pathways). Clinical trial information was curated
from ClinicalTrial.gov, and FDA approval information was collected
from Drugs@FDA (http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drug-
satfda/) and DailyMed (http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/).

The multi-level drug data were integrated together using the drug
terms in MeSH (http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/), in which the drug
target information was linked to signaling pathway data. We further
used the MeSH disease terms to annotate the disease information in
the clinical trials and FDA-approval data.

Visualization interfaces were designed to visualize the integrated multi-
level drug data using GraphViz software (http://www.graphviz.org). The
network structure is constructed through a recursive method that starts
from the initial drug to further levels, e. g. targets, pathways, clinical trials

and FDA, until no more contiguous interactions are found in the data-
base. The visualization method translates all curated database entities to
the GraphViz language and feeds them into the GraphViz program. The
GraphViz dot program applies an automatic layout algorithm to generate
the visualization interface. An example graph is shown in Figure 1.

DMC database search engine is built on Microsoft IIS web server 7
and SQL server 2005. Full-text indexing is enabled for optimal informa-
tion retrieval.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

The DMC provides two major methods to search and query the
integrated multi-level drug data, as shown in Figure l. The ﬁrst
method supports multiple-ﬁeld search to retrieve drug data of
interest. For instance, users can input ‘ERBB2’ in the target ﬁeld
and ‘breast cancer’ in the clinical trial options—disease ﬁeld. The
multi-ﬁled search then returns all of the drugs with targets of
‘ERBB2’ testing for ‘breast cancer’ in clinical trials. The next
interface is the visualization of the multi-level drug data (see
Methods and Fig. 1B). The GraphViz-based interface enables
users to query or download the ﬁelds-of—interest quickly, includ-
ing the information for targets, clinical trials and FDA-approval
applications. This visualization interface is also helpful for users
to access the original data sources easily.

DMC provides two types of visualization interfaces, namely,
All-Data—Integration-Builder (DMC-A11, as shown in Fig. 1B)
and Drug-Target-Pathway-Builder (DMC-DTP, as shown in
Fig. 2), to integrate, query and download multi-dimensional
data and information of known drugs or compounds. The
DMC-All interface enables interactive visualization of six types
of drug information: drug (chemical structure), target, clinical
trial, FDA, targeted signaling pathways and targeted diseases

under clinical trials or approved for use, whereas the DMC-
DTP speciﬁcally represents the information of drug targets
with their targeted signaling pathways. In the reported DMC
database, we provide the DMC-A11 interface for interactively
querying and visualizing information of about 2000 known
drugs, with available clinical trial information and FDA-
approval information, and the DMC-DTP interface for querying
and visualizing available targets and signaling pathway informa-
tion of >10 000 known drugs.

The integrated multi-level drug data with the convenient visu-
alization-based search and query tools will support researchers
and scientists to interrogate available drug information quickly.
The availability of DMC will beneﬁt greatly both computational
scientists and experimental researchers to conduct drug repos-
itioning studies.

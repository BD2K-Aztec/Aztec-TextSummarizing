*ABSTRACT

Summary: Gene Slider helps visualize the conservation and entro-
py of orthologous DNA and protein sequences by presenting them
as one long sequence logo that can be zoomed in and out of, from
an overview of the entire sequence down to just a few residues at a
time. A search function enables users to find motifs such as cis-
elements in promoter regions by simply “drawing” a sequence logo
representation of the desired motif as a query. In addition to display-
ing user-supplied FASTA files, our demonstration version of Gene
Slider loads and displays a rich database of 90,000+ conserved non-
coding regions across the Brassicaceae indexed to the TA|R10 Col-
0 Arabidopsis thaliana sequence. It also displays transcription factor
binding sites, enabling easy identification of regions that are both
conserved across multiple species and may contain transcription
factor binding sites.

1 INTRODUCTION

Sequence logos are a well-known bioinforrnatic data visualization
paradigm for displaying conservation and entropy in aligned se-
quences (Schneider and Stephens, 1990). Each of the residues in a
sequence is represented by a series of stacked characters in which
the height of the stack signiﬁes the degree of conservation for that
position, and the height of the characters signiﬁes the frequency of
that residue. Traditionally, sequence logos are generated with tools
such as WebLogo (Crooks et al., 2004) and Seq2Log0 (Thomsen
and Nielsen, 2012) in which any sequence beyond 30 or so bases
must be broken into separate rows. This makes it difﬁcult to identi-
fy motifs that span multiple rows. Skylign (Wheeler et al., 2014)
addresses this problem by generating long sequence logos that can

be zoomed in and out of, however it is still difﬁcult to identify
amino acid motifs when there is “wobble” in one or more of the
bases.

Gene Slider addresses these challenges by combining the ability
to make long sequence logos with a search panel that automatically
highlights motifs of interest, even when there is a high degree of
wobble. Slider controls assign certainty thresholds for each posi-
tion of a search query to control whether the search ﬁmction will
recognize partially conserved matches. Up to six different motifs
can be searched for, with each motif containing up to eight differ-
ent bases. A navigation slider at the bottom of the screen indicates
which region of the sequence is currently being displayed. Col-
oured markers along this slider indicate where query motifs have
been identiﬁed, making it easy to see where multiple matches have
been found. Figure 1 shows a portion of an alignment in which
there is only one occurrence of the motif AAACA. Without the
search ﬁmction it would be challenging to ﬁnd this motif because
of the entropy in positions 3 and 4 of the match.

Fig. 1. The motif AAACA is highlighted according to the query in the
search panel. The horizontal bar superimposed over each column represents
the number of sequences with a residue at that position. The six residues on
the right side of the ﬁgure have high bit scores suggesting a high degree of
conservation, however the horizontal bar indicates that only one of the
nineteen species in the alignment has a base in those positions.

2 METHODS

Gene Slider loads FASTA formatted aligned sequences into a large
matrix and then counts the frequency of each base per column. Bit
scores for each base are calculated according to Schneider & Ste-

phens’s (1990) application of the Shannon entropy formula. Indi-
vidual bit scores are summed to make a total bit score for the col-
umn. Symbols are then scaled according to the frequency of resi-
dues found in each column and drawn to the screen according to
the start and end points of the view settings.

The usual Shannon logo can be misleading because column
heights do not take insertion and deletion events into account. A
base that is only found in one sequence while each of the other
sequences show a gap will have the same bit score and column
height as a base that is conserved across every sequence. Gene
Slider provides two modes for visualizing how many sequences are
contributing to the bit score for any given base. The ﬁrst mode
uses a horizontal bar indicator, as can be seen in Figure 1 where
positions 534-539 only have one species with a base in that col-
umn. The second mode manipulates the saturation level of each
column, which takes advantage of the preattentive ability in our
visual cortex to quickly recognize subtle changes in luminance
(Healey and Enns, 2012).

Fig. 2. Pre-mapped JASPAR and Weirauch et a1. (2014) motifs in the
promoter of KAT I (At5g46240). It has been shown that the transcription
factor SOCl affects stomatal opening, which is regulated by KATl OG-
mura et al., 2015). The left panel shows a well-conserved SOCl binding
site (yellow) immediately upstream of the KATl promoter, while the right
panel shows a SOCl site that is not well conserved. The hypothesis would
be that the former is the functional SOCl binding site. The panels are dis-
played with the same vertical weighted bit score scale.

Gene Slider provides another method for overcoming this prob-
lem by introducing a new logotype we call a “Weighted Shannon”.
This approach factors the number of sequences contributing to the
bit score into the calculation of that position’s height by multiply-
ing the bit score with the number of residues in that column divid-
ed by the total number of sequences in the alignment. In contrast to
the various Kullback—Leibler modiﬁcations in Seq2L0go (Thomsen
and Nielsen, 2012), this produces a logotype that is similar to the
convention, but highly conserved regions are not conﬂated with
ones having just one or two residues in an otherwise gapped re-
g10n.

Work sessions can be saved and reloaded via a dynamically gen-
erated URL accessed through the ‘Share’ button. The ‘Screen
Grab’ button creates high-resolution images suitable for publica-
tion. Gene Slider can display DNA or protein FASTA ﬁles, as well
as GFF ﬁles that are uploaded by the user.

Gene Slider was written in Processingjs and runs in most web
browsers. It can display a large number of sequences of any length,
however performance decreases as the sequence length and se-
quence number goes up. Contemporary laptops can display se-
quences up to 3000 bases long without noticeable lag. Data can be
loaded directly from the users’ hard drive, however, conserved
noncoding sequence data can be loaded from RESTful web ser-
vices running on the BAR (Touﬁghi et al., 2005).

3 RESULT

To demonstrate Gene Slider, we have pre-processed 90,000+ con-
served non-coding regions across the Brassicaceae (Haudry et al.,
2013), indexed to the TAIR10 Col-0 Arabidopsis thaliana se-
quence, for easy identiﬁcation of regions that are conserved across
multiple species. Further, we have mapped transcription factor
binding sites from the JASPAR database (Mathelier et al., 2014)
and from Weirauch et a1. (2014) to the TAIR10 genome sequence
using FIMO (Grant et al., 2011) to permit the identiﬁcation of
regions that are both conserved and may contain transcription fac-
tor binding sites (Figure 2). Upon visiting the web site, simply
enter the name of the Arabidopsis gene and how many bases up-
stream and downstream of the gene you wish to load, or select a
chromosomal region by entering the chromosome number, start
and end point. This data can also be accessed directly as a web
service. A link for this can be found on the website’s About page.

Although FIMO-mapped motifs are found in many places in the
genome, a strong positional disequilibrium for a subset of these is
found approximately -200 bp upstream of the transcriptional start
site in Arabidopsis promoters if a conservation criterion is applied.
Such a disequilibrium is consistent with ﬁmctionally active binding
sites. In Arabidopsis, 79% of the TFBSs mapped from the
Weirauch et a1. (2014) data set and some other smaller data sets
have identical positions in the alignment of the promoter region
with three other closely related Brassicaceae species (Yu et al.,
2016). This subset shows a marked positional disequilibrium. In
the same study, the authors also examined DNAse I hypersensitivi-
ty data from Sullivan et a1. (2014), and found a similar disequilib-
rium in the -200 bp upstream region. For this reason, we have also
included a “Link to Regulome” for a set of DNAse I data from
Sullivan et a1. (2014).

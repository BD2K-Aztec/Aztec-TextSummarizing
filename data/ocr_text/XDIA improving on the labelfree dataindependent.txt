ABSTRACT

Summary: XDIA is a computational strategy for analyzing
multiplexed spectra acquired using electron transfer dissociation and
collision-activated dissociation; it significantly increases identified
spectra (~250%) and unique peptides (~30%) when compared
with the data-dependent ETCaD analysis on middle-down, single-
phase shotgun proteomic analysis. Increasing identified spectra and
peptides improves quantitation statistics confidence and protein
coverage, respectively.

1 INTRODUCTION

Label-free approaches (e.g. spectral counting) for the relative
quantitation of complex peptide mixtures have gained popularity
because of their low cost, reasonable accuracy and simplicity.
However, in accuracy they still fall behind the approaches that
measure abundance by comparing peptides to an internal, chemically
identical standard enriched with a heavy stable isotope. The
latter, in turn, are expensive and laborious. But regardless of the
strategy, quantitation and identiﬁcation, efﬁciency and accuracy are
constrained by limitations from the data acquisition method.

The widely adopted data-dependent acquisition (DDA) relies
on a full-range survey scan (M81) to select peptide ions for
fragmentation. Peptides are then identiﬁed by submitting their
tandem mass spectra (M82) to a protein database search engine
such as SEQUEST or Mascot (Perkins et al., 1999). In general,
DDA selects the most abundant peaks in the M81 for individual
fragmentation, and the peaks for which M82 is acquired are excluded
for a short period of time from further M82 acquisition. If there are
many co-eluting ions, however, there may be insufﬁcient time to
acquire M82 data for all ion species and thus some low-abundance
ions may never be identiﬁed. Poor sampling of low-abundance ions
affects overall sampling statistics, thereby impacting the accuracy
of quantitation, especially for the lowest abundance peptides.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

To overcome such limitations, Venable et al. introduced an
alternative strategy to DDA that does not rely on M81 data, called
data-independent acquisition (DIA) (Venable et al., 2004). Brieﬂy,
the authors used a fast scanning linear ion trap (LTQ) (Thermo
Fisher, San Jose, CA, USA) to sequentially isolate and fragment
precursor windows of 10 m /z by collision-activated dissociation
(CAD) until a desired range was covered (e. g. 400—1000 m / z). Their
results showed a 3- to 5-fold improvement in the signal-to-noise
ratio of the ion chromatograms in comparison to DDA, clearly
demonstrating the beneﬁts of DIA for quantitation (Venable et al.,
2004). Moreover, the method provided time-consistent ion sampling
and was able to identify peptides undetected in M81. The increased
sensitivity is due to the ability of the linear ion trap to accumulate
selected precursor ions for M82, thereby becoming less affected by
chemical noise than M81. Venable et al. did not attempt to extract
information from the multiplexed spectra that may have occurred
when multiple precursor ions were fragmented in the same m / z
window; this greatly compromised the number of identiﬁcations.

Here we describe a novel approach for shotgun proteomic data
acquisition, termed extended data-independent acquisition (XDIA),
which greatly improves on the latter and reduces the gap between
the label-based and label-free technologies. We demonstrate XDIA
on a middle-down proteomic experiment, which targets the analysis
of bigger molecules than the ones produced by a trypsin digest.
Some key advantages of analyzing large molecules include increased
identiﬁcation coverage and the possibility of assessing relationships
among multiple modiﬁcations in the same molecule (e. g. histone).
To accomplish such, our experimental strategy uses electron transfer
dissociation (ETD), a new fragmentation process that is effective for
larger molecules and is known to conserve the information of post-
translational modiﬁcations. To enable for protein identiﬁcation, the
data must be processed by our software, termed the XDIA processor.

2 DATA ACQUISITION

XDIA combines high—resolution Orbitrap survey scans with
multiplexed fragmentation data acquired using ETD and CAD. An
XDIA data acquisition cycle consists of one high-resolution M81
(e.g. acquired with the Orbitrap) and a series of consecutive M82
events of 20 m /z isolation windows overlapping each other by
1 m /z. Ion dissociation is achieved by ETD (without supplemental
activation) followed by CAD in two scan events (ETD-CAD).
This process is repeated until a desired m /z range is covered.
Then the XDIA processor is used to enable for protein identiﬁcation.

A schematic of this process is shown in Supplementary Figure 1 and
the experimental method is detailed in Supplementary Method 1.

We acquired spectral counts on a yeast lysate digested with Lys-C
using XDIA and compared the result to the one obtained by DDA
ETCaD (ETD with supplemental activation). These analyses were
performed in triplicates.

3 ALGORITHM

The generated data were processed by the XDIA processor, whose
algorithm is as follows. For every M82 isolation window, a list of
monoisotopic peaks (henceforth referred to as the precursor list)
having m /z values within the isolation window m /z bounds is
extracted from the two nearest M81 events (Supplementary Fig. 1).
This is accomplished using subroutines from YADA (Carvalho
et al., 2009), a software developed by our group that is an isotopic
envelope pattern recognition algorithm. This precursor list is used to
remove charge-reduced precursors [CRPs, which have been proven
to play a critical role for charge prediction and precursor detection
in ETD M82 (Sadygov et al., 2008)] and neutral loss peaks from
the corresponding ETD M82 spectrum. Then any remaining CRP
patterns are used to infer precursors that were undetected in the
ﬂanking M81 events. These newly detected (M82) precursors are
added to the precursor list, and their CRPs and neutral loss peaks
are also removed from the M82. The ﬁnal output is generated by
combining information from the M81 precursors, the M82-detected
precursors and the cleaned list of M82 product ions. These data are
then re—organized to be saved as if they were originally acquired by
DDA, so they can serve as input to a protein search engine and the
analysis pipeline of choice (details in Supplementary Discussion).
When acquiring data using the XDIA ETD-CAD methodology, the
+2 ions fragmented using ETD are excluded by the XDIA processor
because of ETD’s poor efﬁciency in dissociating +2 ions (details in
Supplementary Discussion).

4 RESULTS

Table 1 shows the average number of identiﬁed spectra from
each charge state. XDIA ETD-CAD identiﬁed roughly 250% more
spectra than DDA ETCaD. The average and standard deviation
of the number of uniquely identiﬁed peptides for the three yeast
lysate replicates acquired by XDIA ETD—CAD and DDA ETCaD
were 1434 :I: 210 and 1035 :I: 155, respectively. A general overview
showing that the great majority of the peptides achieve a greater
spectral count when using XDIA ETD—CAD instead of DDA ETCaD
is presented in Supplementary Figure 2. A false discovery rate of
<1% was obtained for all analyses (Supplementary Method 2).
A Venn diagram comparing the number of uniquely identiﬁed
peptides when using DDA ETCaD, DIA ETD—CAD and XDIA ETD—
CAD is presented in Supplementary Figure 3. The DIA ETD—CAD

results were obtained by analyzing the DIA data without using the
XDIA processor, as performed by Venable et al. (2004).

5 FINAL CONSIDERATIONS

Boosting the number of identiﬁed spectra signiﬁcantly improves
the quantitation statistics conﬁdence; increasing identiﬁed peptides
improves on coverage, making XDIA a key contribution. XDIA
is recommended for experiments targeting post-translational
modiﬁcations, those for which ETD is recommended. XDIA
performs best when analyzing complex samples with limited
chromatographic separation. Such is the case of a yeast lysate in
a single chromatographic run.

The XDIA processor is coded in C# and requires a PC with
Windows XP SP2 or later and .NET 3 .5. It installs under the directory
PatternLab for proteomics (Carvalho et al., 2008).

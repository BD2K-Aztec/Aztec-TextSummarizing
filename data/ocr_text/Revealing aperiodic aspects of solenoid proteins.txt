Abstract

Motivation: Repeat proteins, which contain multiple repeats of short sequence motifs, form a large
but seldom—studied group of proteins. Methods focusing on the analysis of 3D structures of such
proteins identified many subtle effects in length distribution of individual motifs that are important
for their functions. However, similar analysis was yet not applied to the vast majority of repeat pro—
teins with unknown 3D structures, mostly because of the extreme diversity of the underlying motifs
and the resulting difficulty to detect those.

Results: We developed FAIT, a sequence—based algorithm for the precise assignment of individual
repeats in repeat proteins and introduced a framework to classify and compare aperiodicity pat—
terns for large protein families. FAIT extracts repeat positions by post—processing FFAS alignment
matrices with image processing methods. On examples of proteins with Leucine Rich Repeat (LRR)
domains and other solenoids like proteins, we show that the automated analysis with FAIT cor—

1 Introduction

Almost 20%, of all plant and animal, including human, proteins are
entirely built from or contain large domains that consist of multiple
repeats of short sequence motifs (Andrade et 61]., 2001). These re—
peated motifs typically contain between 3 and 40 amino acids and
cannot form independent structures by themselves (Kajava, 2012).
A subset of repeat proteins that folds into solenoid—like structures
have motif lengths typically in the range of 20—40 amino acids.
Since all repeats in any given protein are homologous, it is often
assumed that their lengths would be constant and, even if not, the
small differences in the length of individual motifs are usually
treated as noise. However, when a few available 3D structures of so—
lenoid proteins were analyzed, it was shown that small length vari—
ations of 1—5 amino acids between individual motifs can modify
structure in subtle but functionally important ways. For instance,
structures of the Leucine Rich Repeat (LRR) family are all known to

fold into curved solenoid (Kobe and Kajava, 2001; Kajava, 1998),
horseshoe—like structures and small motif length variations affect
their local curvature (Matsushima et 61]., 2005) and, hence, the spe—
cific shape of the binding cavity and their binding specificity. This
feature of LRR proteins is being explored in in silico design of artifi—
cial solenoid—like proteins with desired shapes and curvatures
(Bazan and Kajava, 2015; Park et 61]., 2015). The interest in detect—
ing and analyzing repeat proteins grew over the last decade as more
functionally important groups of such proteins were discovered.
This led to the development of many methods for their recognition
and analysis based, among others, on self-alignment—RADAR
(Heger and Holm, 2000), HMMs—HHRepID (Biegert and deing,
2008), self—comparison approaches based on tiling (Parra et 61].,
2013) or predefined databases and Fourier transformation—
Repetita (Marsella et 61]., 2009). Results of such structure analysis
now available in dedicated resources such as the RepeatDB database

(Di Domenico et al., 2013), as analyzed with Raphael (Walsh et al.,
2012). However, nearly all methods focused on the first step of the
analysis—detecting the motifs—and not on identifying exact lengths
and variations thereof.

At the same time, detecting variations in periodic signals in other
fields, such as cardiographic signals or intense sunspot activities that
oscillate with an approximate period of 11 years, but with signifi-
cant variations, created a large repertoire of mathematical frame-
works that can be applied to detect length variability in solenoid—
like proteins (Jacobson, 2001; Scholkmann et al., 2012). Here, we
present a novel approach called FFAS—based Aperiodicity detection
using Image—processing Techniques (FAIT) for the in detail analysis
of solenoid like proteins. FAIT is an adaptation of image—processing
algorithms to the post—processing the graphic representation of re—
sults of the sensitive profile—profile alignment method FFAS de-
veloped previously in our group (Jaroszewski et al., 2011). We
analyze FAIT’s performance comparing FAIT to annotations from
our structure—based tool, ConSole (Hrabe and Godzik, 2014), since
no standard benchmark exists that contains information about pos—
itions and lengths of individual repeat units for sufficiently large sets
of proteins. Finally, we use FAIT to analyze variability of several
large families of solenoid proteins.

1.1 Aperiodicity profiles

In our previous publication, we introduced a concept of aperiodicity
profiles of solenoid—like protein structures to describe their precise
variation in solenoid motif lengths (Hrabe and Godzik, 2014).
These are plots of motif lengths, indicating the variability between
individual solenoid units. Properties of repeat structures include the
mean unit length 2,, and the lengths of individual units 2,, which can
also be described as differences from the mean length. Differences
from 2,, are specific for individual repeats, describing how they vary
from the average repeat motif length. They can be indicative for
presence of binding sites or local curvature of the protein, distin—
guishing specific individual repeats from other repeats of the same
family. For instance, aperiodicity in the TLR4 profile (2264) indi-
cates the binding region to MD2 with variable electrostatic potential
in several species (Anwar et al., 2015). Analysis of these parameters
allowed us to automatically highlight aperiodic regions in solenoid
structures and identify their specific aperiodicity signatures.

Here, we first benchmark FAIT’s sequence—derived aperiodicity
profiles by comparing them to more—accurate structure—based meth—
ods. We also introduce a novel aperiodicity score, the area A under
the aperiodicity profile curve, to use in a large—scale analysis of the
aperiodicity in LRR proteins (see Section 2 for details). Flat

aperiodicity profiles and hence low A scores indicate periodic struc—
tures, while profiles with many peaks and hence high A scores are
an indicator for highly aperiodic structures. For instance, A allows
us to automatically sort structures by their aperiodicity (Fig. 1).
We use aperiodicity profiles and A scores as descriptors to bench—
mark FAIT and to analyze large protein families.

2 Methods

Detection of aperiodicity patterns with FAIT is based on a custom—
ized signal-processing pipeline where the FFAS—generated profile—
profile scoring matrix M (Wilson, 1996) is enhanced with image—
processing techniques to reveal positions of repeat units in the query
sequence. The FFAS program (Jaroszewski et al., 2011), similarly to
other sequence alignment algorithms, returns the sequence align—
ment as the main output, but the full scoring matrix used to generate
the alignment can also be exported. Visualization of such matrices
was used in many early protein and nucleic acid alignment programs
to manually identify the alignment in a method referred to as a dot—
plot analysis (Vingron and Argos, 1991), but its popularity waned
with improvement of the automated methods for alignment identifi-
cation. Here, we identify and enhance repetitive patterns in a pro—
file—profile scoring matrix using image—processing tools.

A scoring matrix M is an n-by-m matrix, with n being the length
of the reference protein sequence, and m being the length of the
query protein sequence. In a classical alignment problem, values at
position i,j in M are the result of comparing query sequence residue
Q at position i and the reference sequence residue R at position 1':

M1) = 3(Ql', RI) (1)

where B is an amino acid substitution matrix. An optimal path
through matrix M, i.e. the alignment, is typically found by dynamic
programming (Wilson, 1996). This approach can be generalized to a
profile—profile scoring matrix in which positions in the two profiles
being compared are described by vectors rather than amino acids
(Rychlewski et al., 2000; Xu et al., 2014). Values at position i,j in the
scoring matrix are now determined using a matrix—vector product
defined as:

M1,) = V3,; '13 - Vii, (2)

where vi,- is a vector describing a sequence variation at position 1th
in the reference protein sequence, B is the amino acid substitution
matrix [BLOSUM62 substitution matrix (Henikoff and Henikoff,
1992) in FFAS], and 1237,- is a vector describing a sequence variation
at the jth position in the query sequence (Xu et al., 2014).

Revealing aperiodic aspects of solenoid proteins

 

2.1 Reference sequence

The matrix analysis described below relies on the fact that starts
and ends of individual solenoid units in the reference protein are
known from structure analysis. For LRRs, we selected Listeria
internalin (PDB id: ZOMZ, chain A) as the reference protein. The
LRR domain in this structure is relatively long and consists of
n = 15 LRR units. Internalins are ideally periodic LRR structures,
so that:

V2122): 2,);1' e [1;N] (3)

Hence, 2OMZ provides a robust reference for detecting aperiod-
icity in LRRs. The whole protein was manually truncated to the
LRR domain, which was extracted from the 2OMZ structure, and
all LRR unit start positions were labeled in the sequence based on
the ConSole results. For Ankyrin and Armadillo sequences, we simi-
larly extracted positions from the structures 1AWC-B and 3TJ3-A,
respectively.

2.2 Matrix processing

Elucidating LRR aperiodicity from the profile—profile scoring matrix
M (Fig. 2.1) involves several steps modeled after image processing.
In the following description, we will refer to each matrix value at
position i,/' as pixel pl”.

1. We apply an averaging ﬁlter to amplify local similarity at each
position (Fig. 2.2). The averaging ﬁlter calculates the mean value
of 10 pixels along the diagonal fragment [le} pH 10Wr 10]. High
values detected for such diagonals indicate regions of high local
similarity between corresponding regions of two compared se-
quences (or proﬁles).

2. Because repeat unit positions in the reference sequence are
known, we now split the whole matrix into several submatrices
SM with the size of 2reference X m, where 2reference is the length of

(a) -

 

(d)

(b)

 

 

 

the repeat unit in 2OMZ and m is the length of the analyzed
protein.

3. We calculate the average matrix AM of all SM: AM 2 EN SM,-
(Fig. 2.3). Strong similarities, now Visible on some diagonals, in-
dicate high local sequence similarities. This approach to reveal
strong features in the matrix is similar to noise-reduction in
signal or image processing as it is done by averaging images
acquired by cryo electron microscopes for instance (Hrabe and
Forster, 2011).

4. We use the discrete Laplace operator ﬁlter to amplify diagonals
(Fig. 2.4). The Laplace ﬁlter is a standard image-processing tech-
nique to detect edges in an image (Forsyth and Ponce, 2003).
The outcome of the convolution is matrix L (Fig. 2.4), which is

= 32% —|— 32 The ﬁlter is applied

by convoluting each position in AM with the kernel K, which is
deﬁned as

 

formally deﬁned as L(x,y)

—1 —1 —1
K: —1 8 —1 (4)
—1 —1 —1

5. Finally, we average over the ﬁrst ﬁve rows of L to analyze simi-
larity between the query sequence and the static LxLxx pattern
of the internalin LRR unit (Fig. 2.5 ).

2.3 Signal processing

As a result of the steps described in the previous paragraph, we ob-
tain a 1D signal of identical length as the query sequence length
(Fig. 2e). High values of the signal indicate high similarity to starts
of the LRR units in the reference protein. Hence, by extracting pos-
itions of these peaks, one can find start positions of units in the
query sequence. We use the signal statistics to detect peaks in the

described in more detail in the main text. (5) Peaks in the final signal are indicators for the starting positions of the LRR units in the query sequence. The highest
peak in the profile identifies positions of two engineered residues in the 20MZ sequence

signal. We define significant peaks as values larger than 20' of the
signal over the query sequence length. The average distance between
the detected peaks corresponds to the mean unit length 2,,. The
method accepts 2,, as a valid unit length if it falls within the known
unit length intervals [18;32] for LRRs, [23;43] for Ankyrin and
[31;51] for Armadillo (Kajava, 2012; Li et al., 2006; Tewari et al.,
2010). If 2,, is not within that interval, the asignal factor used in unit
detection is gradually decreased. If a valid value of 2,, is still not
found at 10', the query sequence is classified as a non—LRR.

Once 2,, is known, we iteratively identify LRR units from peaks in
the signal. Here, a numeric optimization method starts detection at
the first peak and optimizes Equation (5 ) to detect individual units:

14,- : argmaxievrégiﬁa] (U, —l— 141,-) (5)

Starting at the first peak with position i and a signal value 11,-, the
unit length j is sampled within the [2,, — (3; 2,, —l— (3] interval, where
(3 specifies the maximum length of a unit. The only predefined par-
ameter in FAIT and is set to (3 = 2,, / 2. Once a highest scored unit is
assigned to residue 1', the method continues at position i—l— j—l— 1.

2.4 Similarity of aperiodicity profiles

In order to compare two aperiodicity profiles, we calculate the pro—
file similarity s with a sliding L2 window. Here, we slide the shorter
profile [)1 along the longer profile [)2 and detect the minimal
Euclidean distance for all overlapping regions [Equation (6 )], where
N is the number of elements in the shorter sequence p1 and M the
number of elements in the longer sequence [92:

S = miniM_N 2:0 (P1,; — 1924402 (6)

We experimented with a similar approach by calculating the
correlation of p1 and [92, but the L2 norm yields more stable re—
sults. The problem with normalized correlation is that the similar-
ity of two vectors where one has all identical elements is not
defined. Correlation becomes not meaningful for extremely peri-
odic proteins, and hence L2 is a more stable score in this applica—
tion. Finally, each element in each profile is the respective
difference 2,,i—2,, measured in amino acids (aa); then, the unit of s
is 6161, too.

3 Results

3.1 Benchmark based on aperiodicity profiles

from structure

In order to benchmark FAIT, we compared its sequence—based aperi—
odicity profiles against structure—based profiles from our structure—
based method, ConSole. A total of 54 LRR, 148 Ankyrin and 80
Armadillo proteins were used to compare aperiodicity profiles
derived directly from structure (Console) to analogous profiles pre—
dicted from sequence (FAIT). For all structures, we could identify
the error distribution for the profiles as an average profile difference
of 0.6 aa and a standard deviation of 0.41 aa, as detected by
Equation (6). Moreover, profile lengths differed by 2 act on average.
Figure 3 depicts structures and their compared aperiodicity profiles.
Our results indicate that aperiodicity profiles detected with FAIT
are in good agreement with the ones detected from structures with
ConSole.

3.2 Comparing FAIT and HHRepID

We compared FAIT to HHRepID repeat detector (Biegert and
Soding, 2008). HHRepID is probably the conceptually most
similar method from all the repeat detection algorithms, as the
HMM—HMM comparison not only detects any repeat motifs in a
sequence, but returns positions of repeat units as well. Hence, for
direct comparison, HHRepID was applied to generate aperiod—
icity profiles for the identical LRR dataset used to benchmark
FAIT.

Here, we show that FAIT clearly outperforms HHRepID
(Table 1). For instance, for the ribonuclease inhibitor (PDB ID
1A4Y-A), HHRepID returns unit some lengths as long as 57 aa.
This result is not satisfactory as it ignores the fact that these 57 aa
contains two LRR units that vary in length between 28 aa and 29
aa, as shown by FAIT (Fig. 3). Similar effects could be observed for
Armadillo repeats. Results for Ankyrin repeats, however, were
in good agreement for both methods. This must be attributed to
the low, intrinsic aperiodicity of the whole protein family, which
we also observed in our previously study (Hrabe and Godzik,
2014)

While HHRepID performs well as a generalized repeat detector
from sequence, it underperforms in detecting individual repeat units
in sequence. HHRepID with other sequence—based methods such as
RADAR, Repettita or Tiling were developed and benchmarked for
the general purpose of detecting whole repeat domains in sequence,
and were not specifically tailored to detect individual repeat units
and their lengths (Luo and Nijveen, 2014).

3.3 Model bias analysis

In order to analyze FAIT’s sensitivity to the type of reference used
for analysis, we varied the reference sequence for detecting LRR
units. Specifically, we used the Ankyrin (PDB: 1AWC—B) sequence
as reference for FAIT analysis. Ankyrin proteins also form solenoid-
like structures, but their sequence does not resemble any LRR pat—
tern and their structures significantly differ from LRR structures.
The difference between the Ankyrin—based FAIT and ConSole pro—
files detected by the sliding Euclidean score was significantly larger
than using the LRR 2OMZ—A as reference. The average difference
between aperiodicity profiles was 1.62 aa with a standard deviation
of 2.67 aa.

family cluster in the plot. The cluster centers are determined by the mean values of 2,, and A score and the cluster width by corresponding standard deviations in
the cluster. Structures of the bacterial internalin family and the ribonuclease inhibitor family form clusters in the lower A-score regions, with the ribonuclease in-
hibitor cluster overlapping the NLR subfamily cluster (not shown). TLR structures generally have a higher aperiodicity (they form clusters in higher A-score re-
gions). LRR structures from human gut show the largest aperiodicity of all subfamilies. The positions and widths of FAIT-based clusters are highly correlated with

3.4 Pan—family LRR analysis

The intended application of FAIT was to analyze large protein fami-
lies, with most proteins known only on the sequence level. Here, we
analyzed various LRR subfamilies ranging from ideally periodic
internalin proteins to highly aperiodic TLR proteins and generated
aperiodicity profiles in each subfamily based entirely on sequence in—
formation. Aperiodicity profiles were generated for subfamily spe—
cific structures and sequences. Figure 4 shows a comparison of
structure— and sequence—based aperiodicity analysis. The plot con—
firms our previous observations about existence of several subfami—
lies of LRR proteins and hence corroborates the robustness of FAIT:
(i) human NLRs and ribonuclease inhibitors have a repeat—unit
length of 28 an and generally a low aperiodicity, (ii) internalins are
known to have short unit lengths of typically 22 an, and (iii) human
TLRs cluster around a unit length of 24 an and have a larger aperi—
odicity than all previously discussed subfamilies. In addition, our re—
sults show that bacterial LRRs from human gut symbionts have the
largest aperiodicity we observed in our analysis and are systematic—
ally different both from TLR and NLR-like proteins. Again, as
shown in Figure 4, FAIT analysis of sequences is highly correlated
with structure—based results from ConSole and validates the robust—
ness of our method.

4 Conclusion

FAIT is a novel method developed to analyze variations in length of
individual repeats in solenoid—like proteins, and it is the first method
developed specifically to detect it only from sequences. It can, there—
fore, be used to analyze proteins from newly sequenced genomes
and/or large families that were never structurally characterized. It
uses information from the profile—profile alignment scoring matrix
calculated with FFAS and extracts subtle variations of individual re—
peats with image—processing algorithms.

FAIT was benchmarked against an established structure—based
method and shown to give results closely correlated with those ob—
tained using structural data. This allows it to be used on much larger
groups of proteins, as 3D structures of only a very small percentage
of all repeat proteins are known. HHRepID is probably the se—
quence—based method with the most similar annotation detail, but as
nearly all existing methods it was developed to detect repeat do—
mains and not to specifically provide exact positions of individual
units as FAIT. Hence, the major difference between existing meth—
ods and FAIT is the analysis of individual units, not the detection of
repetitive domains in sequence.

Using a previously annotated protein as reference in FFAS com-
parison is the key feature of our approach, as it allows us to pre—
cisely detect individual repeats. Our results indicate that while
varying references for cross—family experiments yields valuable re—
sults, to get the best results possible it is preferable to use a family-
specific reference. Hence, using annotated reference protein seems
to be a required step to increase the resolution in analyzing repeat
sequences. We mainly demonstrate the proof of concept of our algo—
rithm on the large LRR protein family, using a previously annotated,
long and extremely periodic sequence. However, results on other so—
lenoid-like protein families such as Ankyrin and Armadillo repeats
indicate that the FAIT procedure can be readily adapted to other
protein families with one previously annotated sequence and known
length of repeat motifs.

In FAIT, we also introduce a novel framework using the A score
and aperiodicity profiles to analyze large groups of solenoid—like
proteins and group them by their variability, allowing us to

investigate structural and sequence ﬂexibility in more detail than
currently possible on the PDBFlex.0rg webserver (Hrabe et al.,
2015 ). We performed such analysis to visualize aperiodicity in sub—
families of LRRs. These results also provided additional validation
of our method since we compared clustering according to FAIT with
structure—based clustering and showed that they are highly corre-
lated. We are currently conducting a larger study in which we use
FAIT to analyze the evolution of aperiodicity in NLR and TLR
families.

As all of our previous methods, FAIT is currently available as an
open—source package, and will be extended in a future web—server
implementation that automatically distinguishes between multiple
solenoid families.

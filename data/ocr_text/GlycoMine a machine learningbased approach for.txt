Abstract

Motivation: Glycosylation is a ubiquitous type of protein post—translational modification (PTM)
in eukaryotic cells, which plays vital roles in various biological processes (BPs) such as cellular
communication, ligand recognition and subcellular recognition. It is estimated that >50% of the
entire human proteome is glycosylated. However, it is still a significant challenge to identify glyco—
sylation sites, which requires expensive/laborious experimental research. Thus, bioinformatics
approaches that can predict the glycan occupancy at specific sequons in protein sequences would
be useful for understanding and utilizing this important PTM.

Results: In this study, we present a novel bioinformatics tool called GlycoMine, which is a compre—
hensive tool for the systematic in silico identification of C—linked, N—linked, and O—linked glycosyla—
tion sites in the human proteome. GlycoMine was developed using the random forest algorithm
and evaluated based on a well—prepared up—to—date benchmark dataset that encompasses all three
types of glycosylation sites, which was curated from multiple public resources. Heterogeneous
sequences and functional features were derived from various sources, and subjected to further
two—step feature selection to characterize a condensed subset of optimal features that contributed
most to the type—specific prediction of glycosylation sites. Five—fold cross—validation and independ—
ent tests show that this approach significantly improved the prediction performance compared
with four existing prediction tools: NetNGlyc, NetOGlyc, EnsembleGly and GPP. We demonstrated
that this tool could identify candidate glycosylation sites in case study proteins and applied it to
identify many high—confidence glycosylation target proteins by screening the entire human
proteome.

1 Introduction

Glycosylation is a dynamic enzymatic process where glycans (or
carbohydrates) are attached selectively to proteins or lipoproteins.
Glycosylation is an important and ubiquitous post—translational
modification (PTM) (Mazola et al., 2011) and numerous studies
have shown that glycosylation plays a crucial role in various BPs,
ranging from protein folding, subcellular localization, and degrad—
ation (Dwek, 1998; von der Lieth et al., 2004) to extracellular
recognition and cell—cell interactions (Brennan et al., 2011). It is
commonly understood that glycosylation occurs in all cellular com—
partments and that >5 0% of all polypeptides are covalently modi—
fied (Hart and Copeland, 2010; Zaia, 2008). Serine (S), threonine
(T), asparagine (N) and tryptophan (W) are the usual targets of pro—
tein glycosylation (Gavel and Vonheijne, 1990). Glycosylation can
modulate the physicochemical and biological properties of proteins
(Varki, 2007). For example, glycan occupancy in a protein can influ-
ence the ligand—binding mode and affect its biological activity. It can
also inﬂuence protein stability and solubility, as well as modifying
the susceptibility to proteolysis (Mazola et al., 2011).

Glycosylation can be divided into four main categories according
to the chemical linkage between the specific acceptor amino
acid and the glycan, i.e. N—glycosylation, O—glycosylation, C—
glycosylation (or C—mannosylation), and glycosyl—phosphatidylinosi-
tol anchor attachment (Ohtsubo and Marth, 2006). Each of these
types has characteristic sequons or sequence motifs (Ohtsubo and
Marth, 2006; Varki, 2007). The three most abundant types of glyco—
sylation, i.e. N—, O— and C—glycosylation, are of particular interest.
During N-glycosylation, the glycan is linked to the amide nitrogen
in N residues. The sequon for N—glycosylation is N—X—T/S, or N—X—C
in some rare cases, where X can be any residue except proline
(Gavel and Vonheijne, 1990). During O—glycosylation, the glycan is
attached to the hydroxy groups of S and T side—chains. No specific
sequence motifs are defined for O—glycosylation, although experi-
mental studies indicate that most O—linked glycosylation sites occur
on S or T residues with a beta conformation that are in close prox—
imity to proline residues (Christlet and Veluraja, 2001). In addition,
O—glycosylation is frequent in secretory and membrane-binding
proteins in a number of mammalian species. C—glycosylation
involves the attachment of the glycan to the carbon of the first W
residue in the following sequence motifs: W—X-X-W, W—X-X-C or
W—X-X-F (Doucey et al., 1998; Krieg et al., 1998).

The key to understanding the mechanisms and other functional
roles of glycosylation is identifying its substrates and the corres—
ponding glycosylation sites. However, the experimental detection
of glycosylation sites is still a challenging task, which often requires
extensive laboratory work and considerable expense. Thus, compu—
tational approaches that accurately predict the glycan occupancy
at specific sequons based on protein sequence information would
be highly valuable and they may provide important insights into
the functional roles of glycosylation. This is very important, because
sequence—based analyses are currently the simplest and most readily
deployed approach for predicting glycosylation targets and their
respective glycosylation sites.

A number of computational approaches based on sequences
or sequence—derived information have been developed to address

this task. Gupta and Brunak developed NetNGlyc, which is a web
tool based on neural networks that predicts N—glycosylation sites
from protein sequences (Gupta and Brunak, 2002). Steentoft et al.
(2013) developed NetOGlyc based on sequence context and surface
accessibility. Cornelia et al. used ensembles of support vector ma—
chine (SVM) classifiers to predict amino acid residues that were
likely to be glycosylated and implemented the EnsembleGly web ser—
ver (Caragea et al., 2007). The SVM classifiers were trained using
a dataset of experimentally determined N—, O— and C—linked glycosy—
lation sites in 242 proteins extracted from the O—GlycBase database
(version 6.0) (Gupta et al., 1999). Hamby and Hirst (2008) identi—
fied the pairwise patterns around glycosylation sites and combined
these with the predicted secondary structure, predicted surface ac—
cessibility and hydrophobicity of the amino acids to train random
forest (RF)—based predictors in an effort to improve the prediction
accuracy. The developed GPP tool had an accuracy of 90.8% for S,
92.0% for T and 92.8% for N sites, respectively, based on an evalu—
ation using a dataset of 242 proteins and 2415 glycosylation sites.
Chen et al. (2008b) developed an SVM—based approach called
CKSAAP_OGlySite, which employed a sequence—encoding scheme
based on the composition of k—spaced amino acid pairs (CKSAAP)
to predict O—linked glycosylation. Sasaki et al. (2009) trained SVM
models using the local sequence features around glycosylation sites,
and the characteristic subcellular localization of glycoproteins
and achieved ~90% accuracy for both N—linked and O-linked
glycosylation sites. Incorporation of structural features around the
glycosylated sites, including the local contact order, surface accessi—
bility, and secondary structure, have proved useful for improving
the prediction accuracy of N—glycosylation (Chuang et al., 2012).
More recently, Chauhan et al. (2013) developed an SVM—based tool,
GlycoEP, based on the datasets with eukaryotic proteins of C—, N—
and O—linked glycosylation sites. GlycoEP yielded accuracy of 84.3,
86.9 and 91.4% for prediction of N—, O— and C—linked glycosylation
sites, respectively.

There has been considerable success in the development of useful
approaches for glycosylation site prediction, but several problems
still exist in most of the currently available methods that need to be
addressed to develop better methods, as follows. (i) The datasets
used for model training are relatively small, which limits the predict-
ive power of the method. In particular, many of the experimentally
verified novel glycosylation sites that were discovered recently
using high-throughput proteomic techniques were not included
in the curated datasets. (ii) The majority of the available
methods only predict specific types of glycosylation sites, such as
N— or O—glycosylation. Few methods exist that predict all three
of the major types of glycosylation sites, with the exceptions of
NetNGlyc (Gupta and Brunak, 2002), NetOGlyc (Steentoft et al.,
2013) and SVMGlyc (Sasaki et al., 2009), although they are out—
dated. (iii) The feature space used by existing methods to construct
models is incomplete and not comprehensive. Other potentially use—
ful features also remain that need to be characterized. (iv) Biological
features are intrinsically heterogeneous, noisy, and multi—
dimensional, but most existing methods do not employ feature selec—
tion techniques to quantify the importance and the contributions of
the features used for the model performance, thereby leading to only

a partial understanding of the sequence—glycosylation relationships.
Given these deficiencies, it would be very useful to develop more
accurate tools that facilitate the systematic prediction of all the
major types of glycosylation.

In this study, we propose a novel bioinformatics approach called
GlycoMine that addresses these problems and significantly improves
the prediction performance for C—, N— and O—linked glycosylation
by integrating various informative features derived from protein
sequences. GlycoMine uses the RF algorithm coupled with a novel
feature selection strategy to boost the performance. Specifically, an
effective two—step feature selection method based on information
gain (IG) (Kent, 1983) and minimum redundancy maximum rele-
vance (mRMR) (Peng et al., 2005) is used to determine the features
that are important for glycosylation site specificity, as well as iden—
tifying condensed subsets of optimal features that contribute most to
the prediction. A 5 —fold cross—validation and independent tests using
curated datasets demonstrated that GlycoMine outperformed other
tools, including NetNGlyc (Gupta and Brunak, 2002), NetOGlyc
(Steentoft et al., 2013) EnsembleGly (Caragea et al., 2007) and GPP
(Hamby and Hirst, 2008). Two case studies demonstrated that
GlycoMine can be applied rapidly to accurately identify potential
novel glycosylation sites in a protein of interest.

2 Materials and methods

2.1 Overall framework

The overall framework of GlycoMine is illustrated in Figure 1,
which shows that are four stages in the development of this tool, i.e.
data collection and preprocessing, feature extraction, feature selec—
tion and model training and evaluation. The first stage involved
data collection and preprocessing. In the second stage, a variety of
features were extracted, including local sequence features, predicted
structural features, protein functional features, and functional anno-
tations. In the third stage, extensive feature selection was performed
using a two—step procedure based on mRMR or IG in a cross—
validation manner, where the optimal feature subsets were selected
for each glycosylation type. In the final stage, three RF—based classi—
fiers were respectively trained for C—, N— and O—linked glycosylation
sites. The performance comparison with other existing methods was
made via 5 —fold cross—validation and independent tests.

2.2 Collection of datasets and preprocessing
The experimentally determined C—, N— and O—linked glycosylation
sites were extracted from four public databases (Supplemental

Methods). All of the experimentally verified glycosylation sites in
human proteins were extracted from these databases. Sequence redun—
dancy in the curated datasets was removed using the CD—HIT pro-
gram (Huang et al., 2010) to ensure that the sequence identity
between any two proteins was no greater than 30%. This step was
essential for eliminating sequence redundancy and avoiding overesti—
mates of the performance of machine learning—based classifiers. As a
result, we obtained 15, 168 and 208 glycosylated proteins with 68 C—,
416 N— and 649 O—linked glycosylation sites, respectively.

The experimentally determined glycosylation sites were used
as positive samples. However, it would be difficult to prove that a
protein is not glycosylated in any specific conditions. Thus, it was
difficult to collect proteins that could be considered as non—
glycosylated. A background dataset that contained all human pro—
teins was retrieved from UniProt. Negatives (no glycosylation sites)
were selected from this background protein set, which excluded all
experimentally verified glycosylated proteins. Amino acid residues
(N, S, T and W) that were not experimentally verified as glycosyla—
tion sites were regarded as negatives. In addition, to obtain reliable
positive and negative data, samples labeled as ‘Probable’, ‘Potential’
or ‘By similarity’ in UniProt were discarded.

The final datasets were divided into two random subsets, which
are referred to as the benchmark dataset and the independent data—
set (~20% of the size of the benchmark dataset). The performance
of our method and other existing methods were compared using
5 —fold cross—validation tests with the benchmark dataset and further
validated with the independent dataset. In addition, feature selection
and model training were performed with the benchmark dataset.
To extract the local sequence or structural features around potential
glycosylation sites, we used a local sliding window (Trost
and Kusalik, 2011) that comprised 15 residues, where the potential
glycosylation site was located at the center with seven neighboring
residues upstream and downstream of the central site.

2.3 Feature extraction

Previous research into functional site prediction have demonstrated
the value of features that capture sequence, structural and functional
properties as well as information encoded in functional annotations
(Chen et al., 2008b; Chuang et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2014). To this
end, we extracted major features of each of these types (see
Supplementary Table 81 for a complete list of the extracted
features).

2.3.1 Sequence-based features

(i) AAindex (Kawashima et al., 2008), which is a database that con—
tains 544 (release 9.1) amino acid properties collected from the lit—
erature; (ii) Physicochemical properties of proteins, which were
generated by BioJava (Holland et al., 2008); (iii) Position—specific
scoring matrices (PSSMs), which were generated by performing
PSI—BLAST searches (Altschul et al., 1997) against the NCBI non—
redundant database; (iv) Residue conversation score derived from
the PSSM generated by PSI—BLAST defined as:

20
Scorer = — 2 19141032194),
{:1
where [9,),- is the frequency of amino acid j at position i; (v) CKSAAP
(Chen et al., 2008b). This feature type was shown to be particularly
useful for several PTM site predictions.

2.3.2 Predicted structural features
These include disordered regions predicted by DISOPRED2
(Ward et al., 2004); secondary structures predicted by SABLE

(Wagner et al., 2005) and backbone dihedral angles predicted by
SpineX (Faraggi et al., 2009).

2.3.3 Functional features

(i) BP from Gene Ontology (GO) (Ashburner et al., 2000);
(ii) cellular component from GO; (iii) molecular function from
GO; (iv) functional domain from InterPro (Hunter et al., 2012);
(v) pathway information from KEGG (Kanehisa et al., 2012);

v) Functional domain from Pfam (Punta et al., 2012) and

( i
(vii) Protein—protein interaction annotations from STRING
(Franceschini et al., 2013).

2.3.4 Functional annotations

The functional annotations were derived from UniProt:
(i) Functional domain; (ii) nucleotide-binding site; (iii) disulfide
bond; (iv) posttranslationally modified residues (glycosylation sites
annotated by UniPort were removed); (v) active site; (vi) natural
variants; (vii) metal ion—binding site and (viii) other binding sites for
any chemical groups (such as co—enzymes and prosthetic groups).
A detailed description of all the extracted features is provided in the
Supplemental Methods.

2.4 Feature selection

It is likely that the initial feature sets contained certain redundant
and noisy features, which were unwanted and which might
have resulted in negative impacts on model training. Thus, it is im-
perative and often a common practice to employ feature selection
techniques to reduce the dimensionality of the feature vectors in
the initial sets (Saeys et al., 2007; Song et al., 2012) by eliminating
features that do not contribute to the prediction. Thus, we de—
veloped a novel two—step feature selection strategy based on
mRMR and IG, both of which are well—established feature selec—
tion methods, and they were applied initially to rank the import-
ance and contributions of each feature type to glycosylation
prediction.

2.4.1 Minimum redundancy maximum relevance

mRMR is a feature selection algorithm based on mutual information
(MI). It has been used widely in the field of bioinformatics and com-
putational biology (Li et al., 2012, 2014). It can rank features based
on their relevance to the target and the redundancy among the fea—
tures. A ranked feature with a smaller index indicates that the
feature has a better trade—off between the maximum relevance
and the minimum redundancy. The mRMR—based feature selection
strategy has been successfully applied in our previous studies of
caspase—specific cleavage sites and has been shown to identify
subsets of more important features relevant for the prediction
(Wang et al., 2014).

2.4.2 Information gain

IG is a feature selection method based on the information theor—
etic concept of entropy and it is a measure of the uncertainty of
a random variable (Yu and Liu, 2003). IG evaluates each feature
by measuring the IG with respect to the target class. IG has been
used widely in bioinformatics as a fast and efficient feature selec—
tion method for high—dimensional data (Chen et al., 2008a,
2009, 2013; Chen and Kurgan, 2007). See Supplemental
Materials for more details. IG regards the features with the high—
est IG as important, whereas mRMR ranks features according to
their relevance to the target class and the redundancy between
the features.

2.4.3 Two-step feature selection based on mRMR or IG
Algorithm 1 describes the detailed procedure of our two—step feature
selection method based on IG, mRMR and RF. In the first step, IG
and mRMR were used to obtain the top 500 features as the optimal
feature candidates (OFCs). In the second step, the most informative
and contributory features were determined by the incremental fea—
ture selection (IFS). In step 1, the importance of each feature was
evaluated by IG or mRMR.

In the second step, the top 500 features were selected as OFCs
(n = 500). getTopfeatures (FX, 1') is a function that can obtain the top 1'
features from feature set FX. To determine the optimal features in the
OFC, an IFS strategy based on a RF classifier and a 5 —fold cross—valid—
ation were applied to the benchmark dataset to assess all of the fea—
tures included in the OFCs. Steps 3—15 in Algorithm 1 describe the IFS
strategy. In step 8, the variable ‘sum’ represents the sum of 20 calcula—
tion results. In step 10, ‘average (sum)’ is a function that calculates the
average value of sum, which is defined as: n/20. In step 16, the variable
‘num’ represents the position of the best AUC score in the array AUC.

IFS can be described brieﬂy as follows. It constructs n feature
subsets by adding one feature at a time from OFC to the candidate
feature subset  The i—th feature subset is defined as:

Fx={f|f1,f2,---,fz},

where  is the i—th feature from OFC. Each feature set Fix was tested
using the RF classifier and evaluated based on five—fold cross—
validation tests to avoid overfitting. This process was repeated for
20 rounds. As a result, the feature set with the highest AUC value
among the 500 AUC values was selected as the optimal feature set.

2.5 Model training and evaluation

2.5.1 RF classifier

RF (Breiman, 2001) is a popular machine learning algorithm, which
has been used widely in bioinformatics and computational biology.
RF is an ensemble of decision trees that are built by random boot—
strapping with a training dataset and a feature space. RF grows
many classification trees and selects the classification that receives
the most votes from all the trees. RF has various advantages that
make it suitable for our prediction task, including: (i) RF performs
better with high-dimensional inputs; (ii) RF is a highly efficient
machine learning model because the RF training process is usually
faster than that of many other algorithms. Given its reliable per-
formance and efficiency, the RF algorithm implemented using the R
package was used to train the models in the present study.

2.5.2 Performance evaluation

We used five measures, i.e. sensitivity, specificity, precision, accur—
acy and Mathew’s correlation coefficient (MCC) to evaluate the pre—
diction performance in the present study. We also use AUC, the area
under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), which plots
TPR against the false positive rate. We use the ROCR package
(Sing et al., 2005 ) to draw the ROC curves and to calculate the AUC
values. To evaluate the performance and to facilitate comparisons
with other methods, we performed a 5—fold cross—validation (based
on the benchmark datasets) and independent tests (based on the in—
dependent test datasets). A detailed description of these measures
can be found in the Supplemental Methods.

3 Results and discussion

3.1 Amino acid site specificity of glycosylation

Based on the curated datasets, we analyzed the site specificity of the
three types of glycosylation sites. We calculated the frequencies
of the amino acids at each position using a local window size of
14 residues (i.e. seven residues upstream and seven residues down—
stream) around the central glycosylated residue. The sequence logos
shown in Supplementary Figure S1 allowed us to visualize and ana—
lyze the sequence—level site specificity of the three types of glycosyla—
tion sites, where each stack represents the corresponding amino acid
position in the sequence. The degree of sequence conservation at the
corresponding position is measured based on the total height of each
stack, which indicates the relative occurrence of the amino acid at
that position.

The distinct differences in the site motifs of the three types of gly—
cosylation are reﬂected by the different requirements for amino
acid types in the central position. For example, a hallmark of the
C—glycosylation motif is the requirement for a W residue at the cen—
tral position. A lesser requirement for W and cysteine (C) residues is
also shown in the downstream (+3 position) region and W in the
upstream (—3 position) region, thereby constituting the canonical
C—linked glycosylation site motifs, including W-X-X-W and W-X-X-
C (X can be any residue except proline) (Krieg et al., 1998).
For N—linked glycosylation, N residues are preferred in the central
position, as well as a strong requirement for S or T at the +2
position, thereby forming the N—linked glycosylation sequence
motifs N—X—T and N—X—S (Gavel and Vonheijne, 1990). For
O—glycosylation, it can be seen that S and T residues are preferred
in the central position. No specific sequence motifs can be clearly
defined for this type of glycosylation. Thus, the sequence—derived
features that describe the local site specificity might be useful for
predicting the different types of glycosylation.

3.2 Enhancing the prediction performance using

a two—step feature selection strategy

To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first system—
atic effort to use intensive feature selection to select and characterize
more relevant features for protein glycosylation prediction, which
contrasts with most previous studies where few used feature selec—
tion methods to address this problem. In the first step of feature
selection, we used IG or mRMR algorithms to rank all of the initial
features and to generate the top 500 OFCs, which were ranked by
the corresponding IG or mRMR scores. In the second step of feature
selection, we performed IFS to characterize the final optimal fea-
tures for each type of glycosylation. The performance changes in the
RF—based classifiers during the course of this latter feature selection
procedure were reflected by the respective FFS curves, as shown in
Supplementary Figures S3 and S4. There was a general trend where
the height (the AUC score) of the feature selection curve continued
to increase until it reached its highest peak. As a result, we selected
condensed subsets of the most relevant and informative features that
contributed to the prediction of glycosylation sites.

To better understand the relative importance and contribution of
each group of the final optimal features to the performance of the
GlycoMine models, we evaluated the performance decrease (based
on the AUC score) by iteratively removing feature groups from the
model one a time. The changes in the performance results are shown
in Supplementary Table S8. Compared with the other groups of fea—
tures, it is clear that functional features were the most important
feature type for all three types of glycosylation because removing
this group from the model caused the largest performance decrease
(resulted in the lowest AUC scores in Supplementary Table S8).
For example, for O-linked glycosylation prediction, removal of
functional features resulted in 12.8 and 26.5% decreases in the AUC
values for the IG—l—IFS and mRMR—l—IFS models, respectively.
Moreover, we found that the mRMR—l—IFS model performed slightly
better than the IG—l—IFS model in terms of the AUC for C— and N—
linked glycosylation (Supplementary Table S8). For O—linked glyco—
sylation, the IG—l—IFS model had a higher AUC. In addition, the num-
ber of final optimal features varied significantly, depending on the
type of glycosylation (Supplementary Tables S9 and S10). Models
with less final features did not necessarily deliver worse perform—
ance, but the opposite was also true, i.e. a model may requires more
final features to achieve a better performance. In the latter case,
many of the features complemented each other and contributed col—
lectively to the performance. Supplementary Tables S9 and S10
show statistics for the final selected optimal features for each type
of glycosylation based on the IG—l—IFS and mRMR—l—IFS models,
respectively.

3.3 Comparison with other methods using a 5—fold
cross—validation and independent tests

In this section, we compare the results of the prediction performance
using GlycoMine and those with four other existing tools, i.e.
NetNGlyc (Gupta and Brunak, 2002), NetOGlyc (Steentoft et al.,
2013), GPP (Hamby and Hirst, 2008) and EnsembleGly (Caragea
et al., 2007), which are currently publicly available. Note that
NetNGlyc and EnsembleGLy were trained using human glycosyla-
tion data, thus it is reasonable to compare the performance of these
two tools with GlycoMine based on our datasets. These different
methods used different training datasets to train their prediction
models, thus to objectively evaluate the performance of these
methods, we performed both 5—fold cross—validation and inde—
pendent tests using the same benchmark and independent datasets.

In the 5—fold cross—validation tests, it should be noted that we only
performed feature selection using the four subsets and we excluded
the test subset, thereby facilitating objective evaluations of the per—
formance of our method. The number of three kinds of glycosylation
sites in both benchmark and independent test are shown in Table 1.

The sequences of these datasets were submitted to the servers
of NetNGlyc, NetOGlyc, GPP and EnsembleGly to evaluate the pre—
diction performance of these servers, where we used the default
or recommended settings suggested by the authors. However, it is
worth noting that GlycoMine was capable of predicting all three
types of glycosylation, whereas the other tools could only be used to
predict one or two types. The prediction performance comparison
results for the three types of glycosylation sites are shown in
Supplementary Table 812. We also used the ROC curves and AUC
measures to evaluate the performance of the different methods.
The ROC curves for the benchmark and independent datasets are
shown in Supplementary Figure 85 and Figure 2, respectively.

The results on both 5 —fold cross—validation (Supplementary Table
812) and independent tests (Fig. 2) indicate that for O—linked glyco—
sylation sites, the IG—I—IFS models achieved slightly higher AUC
scores, while the mRMR—I—IFS models achieved higher AUC scores
for C— and N—linked glycosylation. Both types of GlycoMine models
(trained using the optimal feature subsets selected by IG—I—IFS and
mRMR—l—IFS) clearly outperformed the other four existing tools for
all the three types of glycosylation sites. GlycoMine achieved signifi—
cantly higher AUC scores than the other tools when tested using
both the benchmark and independent datasets. For example, with
the independent datasets, the GlycoMine models trained using the
optimal feature sets (obtained by IG and IFS) obtained AUC values
of 0.983 and 0.982 for N— and O—linked glycosylation, respectively,
whereas the corresponding GlycoMine model trained using the opti—
mal features selected by mRMR and IFS obtained AUC scores of
0.986 and 0.961, respectively. In contrast, the second best tool,
EnsembleGly, obtained AUC scores of 0.939, 0.819 and 0.919,
for the three types of glycosylation prediction. NetOGlyc obtained
an AUC score of 0.850 for the O—linked glycosylation prediction.
The other two tools, GPP and NetNGlyc, obtained much lower AUC
values. For C—linked glycosylation, the GlycoMine models (IG—I—IFS
and mRMR—I—IFS models) obtained an AUC score of 1.0. This was
probably due to the limited size of the independent test dataset,
where only 13 C—linked glycosylation sites were available.

Considering that certain negative samples (i.e. non—glycosylated
sites) can potentially be mislabeled, we further investigated the per—
formance of GlycoMine by randomly sampling negative samples.
We randomly selected the same number of negative samples as posi—
tive samples from the benchmark datasets for C—, N— and O—linked
glycosylation with different OFCs using mRMR—l—IFS and IG—l—IFS
methods. This randomization process was repeated 10 times.
For each randomization, we conducted five—fold cross—validation
tests. We calculated the average performance for 10 times of 5 -fold
cross—validation tests and reported the results in Supplementary
Table 811. It is clear that even with different selected negative sam—
ples, there is a slight performance difference across the 10

GlycoMine is robust and insensitive to the potential impact posed
by the randomly selected negative samples.

In addition to the AUC scores, we calculated the MCC, ACC,
sensitivity, specificity and precision to compare the performance of
the tools (Supplementary Table 812). These results demonstrated
that GlycoMine obtained better performance than the other
four tools, NetNGlyc, NetOGlyc, GPP and EnsembleGly, for the
prediction of N—, C— and O—linked glycosylation sites, with the
sole exception of the sensitivity score for N—linked glycosylation
where GlycoMine obtained a slighter lower sensitivity than GPP
(Supplementary Table 812). The improved prediction performance
of our method compared with GPP and EnsembleGly might be
attributable to three important factors: (i) the extraction of more
useful and complementary features from multiple sources yielded
better descriptions of protein glycosylation sites; (ii) the use of RF as
the algorithm to learn the underlying rules of glycosylation and
to train the models; and (iii) the use of an efficient two—step feature

selection strategy to remove noisy and irrelevant features, and to
select most informative features that contributed to the predictions.

3.4 Web server and local Java tool implementation

We developed a web server and a local Java Applet for GlycoMine
to allow users to perform high—throughput bioinformatics analyses
of novel glycosylation sites, which are freely available at http://
www.structbi0infor.org/Lab/GlycoMine. The
was implemented using Java Server Pages running Tomcat7 and

GlycoMine server

configured in the Linux environment on a 16—c0re server machine
with 50 GB memory and a 4 TB hard disk. The server uses the best—
performing models trained using the final optimal features selected
by the two—step feature selection procedure. For O—linked glycosyla-
tion, the optimal features were selected by IG—I—IFS, while for C— and
N—linked glycosylation, the optimal features were determined by
mRMR—l—IFS. The server requires protein amino acid sequences in
the FASTA format as the input. In cases where the user has multiple
sequences to predict, they are encouraged to download the Java
Applet of GlycoMine and submit a multiple FASTA formatted input
to this Java program to predict the potential glycosylation sites
of multiple proteins. Supplementary Figure 86 shows an example of
the interfaces of web server and the Java program together with its
prediction output. The computational time required for a prediction
task depends on the length of the submitted sequence. For a protein
sequence with 500 amino acid residues, the prediction task requires
3 min and 50 s to generate and return the prediction results.

3.5 Proteome—wide prediction of glycosylation sites

The development of GlycoMine allows users to perform the prote—
ome—wide prediction of glycosylation sites in an automated manner.
Thus, we used GlycoMine to screen potential glycosylated proteins
and their respective glycosylation sites in the complete human prote—
ome (a total of 84 843 proteins). The prediction models were trained
using the final optimal features based on the complete training data—
sets. We adjusted the prediction thresholds to set the specificity

I"

level at 99.0% to generate high—confidence prediction results.
The statistics for the predicted N—, C— and O—linked glycosylated
proteins and glycosylation sites are shown in Supplementary Table
813. In total, 5846 and 6358 proteins were predicted to be N— and
O—glycosylated, which contained 24 174 and 97 042 predicted N—
and O—glycosylation sites, respectively. In contrast, the number of
predicted C—linked glycosylation sites was lowest (only 18 926 sites),
possibly due to the limited availability of experimentally verified
glycosylation data for model training. A complete list of the pre—
dicted glycosylated proteins and their glycosylation sites is available
from the GlycoMine website.

3.6 Case study

To further illustrate the capacity of GlycoMine, we performed a
case study of two proteins with respect to N— and O—linked glycosy—
lation. The first protein was perforin-1 (PRF1; UniProt ID: P14222),
a cytotoxic pore—forming glycoprotein that plays an important
role in killing virus-infected and transformed cells by cytotoxic T
lymphocytes and natural killer cells (Brennan et al., 2011). One
N—linked glycosylation site has been experimentally confirmed by
a previous study (Chen et al., 2009). Previous study also indicates
that transport from the Golgi to secretory granules requires
N-linked glycosylation of perforin-1 (Brennan et al., 2011).
The second protein was glycophorin-A (GYPA, UniProt ID:
P02724), a major intrinsic membrane protein with a high propor-
tion of O—glycosylated residues in erythrocytes (Wilson et al., 1993).
The O—linked glycosylation sites (labeled in blue) in Figure 3B were
experimentally verified (Pisano et al., 1993). Glycophorin—A is ex—
pressed exclusively in erythroid cells and their precursors and is a
marker for identifying erythroid differentiation in hematopoietic
malignancies. The sequence scanning results and the predicted
glycosylation sites for the domains of each protein are shown in
Figure 3. By assigning a higher prediction cutoff threshold of 0.5,
GlycoMine predicted six and 34 high—confidence N— and O-linked
glycosylation sites, respectively, in these two proteins. One of these

sites in perforin-1 and 16 sites in glycophorin—A have been con—
firmed experimentally as glycosylation sites. These results suggest
that GlycoMine can be a useful tool for in silico glycosylation site
prediction.

4 Conclusion

In this study, we developed a novel machine—learning approach
called GlycoMine for predicting C—, N— and O—linked glycosylation
sites in the human proteome. GlycoMine combines various inform—
ative features from multiple sources. A two—step feature selection
method based on mRMR or IG with IFS is used by GlycoMine to
select the most contributory and useful features. Extensive cross—
validation and independent tests using benchmark and independent
datasets suggested that GlycoMine outperformed existing tools:
GPP, EnsembleGly and NetNGlyc. This study represents the first
systematic effort to select and characterize the most important fea—
tures that are relevant for predicting the three major types of glyco—
sylation using intensive feature selection techniques. A user—friendly
web interface and a Java Applet are available as an implementation
of this approach. Compared with experimental approaches, bio—
informatics tools such as GlycoMine can provide a powerful and
cost—effective approach that allows the proteome—wide prediction
of potential glycosylation sites. These predictions are likely to have a
number of important applications, such as identifying novel glycosy—
lated substrate proteins, examining the effect of point mutations on
the gain or loss of glycosylation sites, and the rational design of
glycoproteins by inserting neo—glycosylation sites. We consider that
the web server and Java program will be useful tools for large—scale
glycosylation site prediction and they may facilitate hypothesis—
driven experimental design.

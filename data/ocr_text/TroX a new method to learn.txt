ABSTRACT

Motivation: An estimated 10-30% of clinically recognized concep-
tions are aneuploid, leading to spontaneous miscarriages, in vitro fer-
tilization failures and, when viable, severe developmental disabilities.
With the ongoing reduction in the cost of genotyping and DNA
sequencing, the use of high-density single nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) markers for clinical diagnosis of aneuploidy and biomedical re-
search into its causes is becoming common practice. A reliable, flex-
ible and computationally feasible method for inferring the sources of
aneuploidy is thus crucial.

Results: We propose a new method, TroX, for analyzing human tri-
somy data using high density SNP markers from a trisomic individual
or product of conception and one parent. Using a hidden Markov
model, we infer the stage of the meiotic error (I or II) and the individual
in which non-disjunction event occurred, as well as the crossover lo-
cations on the trisomic chromosome. A novel and important feature of
the method is its reliance on data from the proband and only one
parent, reducing the experimental cost by a third and enabling a
larger set of data to be used. We evaluate our method by applying it
to simulated trio data as well as to genotype data for 282 trios that
include a child trisomic for chromosome 21. The analyses show the
method to be highly reliable even when data from only one parent are
available. With the increasing availability of DNA samples from mother
and fetus, application of approaches such as ours should yield unpre-
cedented insights into the genetic risk factors for aneuploidy.

1 INTRODUCTION

A fundamental step in meiosis is the segregation of chromosomes
to create haploid egg and sperm cells. In humans, this process is
highly error-prone: 10—30% of clinically recognized pregnancies
are thought to be aneuploid, i.e. to carry an abnormal number of
chromosomes (Hassold et al., 1996; Jacobs et al., 1992). The vast
majority of aneuploid pregnancies result in spontaneous miscar-
riages or lead to severe developmental disabilities in the child
when not embryonic lethal (Hassold and Hunt, 2001).

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Conversely, aneuploidy underlies more than a third of spontan-
eous miscarriages (Nagaoka et al., 2012).

Aneuploidy results from the improper segregation of chromo-
somes to daughter cells (termed non-disjunction) and can in prin-
ciple occur in either male or female and in mitosis or meiosis. In
practice, in humans, the vast majority of non-disjunction events
(~90—95%) are of maternal origin (Hassold and Hunt, 2001).
Meiotic non-disjunction can further originate in meiosis I (MI),
if homologous chromosomes fail to disjoin, or in meiosis II
(MII), if sister chromatids do not segregate properly (Fig. 1).
Errors in MI are thought to be more common, though the pro-
portions vary across chromosomes [e. g. M11 is more common for
chromosome 18 (Hassold et al., 1993)].

Among known risk factors for aneuploidy are maternal age,
with rates of trisomies increasing exponentially after the age of
approximately 35 (Hassold and Hunt, 2001; Penrose, 1933), and
errors in recombination. In humans, as in most sexually repro-
ducing organisms, there is an obligate crossover per chromosome
to ensure proper disjunction (see Fledel—Alon et al., 2009, and
references therein). If no crossover occurs (and in the absence of
a backup mechanism for achiasmatic segregation), chromatids
are distributed randomly into daughter cells and thus are ex-
pected to result in aneuploidy in half the cases. Accordingly,
the genetic map of chromosomes that experience non-disjunction
in MI is shorter than seen in proper disjunctions (Sherman et al.,
1991). In addition to too few crossovers, an abnormal placement
of crossovers (e. g. events unusually close to the centromere) has
been associated with chromosome 16 and 21 trisomies (Lamb
et al., 1996; Sherman et al., 1994; also see Hassold and Hunt,
2001 and references therein). Beyond these features, little is
known about the risk factors for non-disjunction. In particular,
it remains unclear how much the locations of crossovers overlap
between transmissions with proper disjunction and transmissions
that lead to aneuploidy.

The analysis of genetic data from trisomic children or trisomic
products of conceptions (POC; henceforth referred to as ‘pro-
bands’) and their parents allows one to identify the stage (MI or
M11) in which the non-disjunction occurred and the origin (ma-
ternal or paternal). In a subset of cases, it also allows one to infer
the locations of a subset of crossover events that occurred on the
tetrad of the chromosome that did not disjoin properly (Jacobs
et al., 1988). Thus, as genotyping and sequencing methods
become much more accessible and as non-invasive methods to
sample fetal DNA from maternal blood become widespread
(Fan et al., 2008, 2012; Palomaki et al., 2012), there is an

Fig. 1. Stages at which non-disjunction can occur. In this cartoon, we
consider the tetrad for one chromosome and do not represent the other
22. (a1) MI non-disjunction results in two daughter cells with two chro-
matids and two with zero chromatids. Alleles near the centromere are not
identical by descent (NIBD), so may be heterozygous. In this case, a
recombinant chromatid and a non-recombinant chromatid are trans-
mitted, so the crossovers can be detected from proband and parental
data. (a2) In contrast, arecombinant crossover cannot be detected if
both recombinant (or non-recombinant) chromatids are transmitted. (b)
MII non-disjunction results in one daughter cell with two chromatids,
one with zero chromatid and two normal cells with one chromatid each.
Alleles near the centromere are identical by descent (IBD), so are homo-
zygous. The pattern near the centromere is therefore informative about
the stage of meiosis at which non-disjunction events occurred

 

unprecedented opportunity to gain a better understanding of
genetic risk factors for non-disjunction.

There exist a number of methods to infer the stage of meiosis
at which non-disjunction occurred and to identify crossovers. All
are based on the same basic idea: to look for chromosome seg-
ments in which the trisomic chromosome has retained the pater-
nal or maternal heterozygosity (Jacobs et al., 1988). Whether this
segment surrounds the centromere is indicative of the stage of
meiosis in which non-disjunction occurred, and the switches be-
tween retained heterozygosity and homozygosity point to the
location of crossovers (Fig. 2). Existing methods suffer from im-
portant limitations, however. Some rely on few highly poly-
morphic markers such as microsatellites (Feingold et al., 2000;
Li et al., 2001) and are not computationally feasible for high-
density markers, so do not allow recombination events to be
precisely localized. Others can handle single nucleotide poly-
morphism (SNP) genotype data, but require data from both par-
ents (Gabriel et al., 2011), as well as complete triploid genotype
calls for the proband (requiring that, for example, ATT be dis-
tinguished from AAT instead of simply read as heterozygous;
Oliver et al., 2012). None of the existing methods have an explicit
error model; instead, they rely on post hoc filtering to identify
crossovers, potentially leading to errors and inconsistencies
among studies. Finally, and perhaps most importantly from a
practical standpoint, none of the computationally feasible meth-
ods can accommodate missing data from the male, when collect-
ing samples from both male and female is often prohibitive.

Motivated by these considerations, we developed a new
method, TroX (trisomy crossover), and made the software

Fig. 2. Representation of the genetic pattern indicative of MI and M11
non-disjunction errors and where crossovers took place. Shown on the
ﬁgure are the positions that are heterozygous in the mother, here
the origin of the non-disjunction event. The difference between non-
disjunction occurring at MI (left panel) and at MII (right panel) lies in
the location of the tracts that are NIBD, which are associated with a
retention of heterozygosity (underlined in orange). Complete genotypes
(triploid) represent the number of alternative alleles to the reference
genome carried by the proband, while incomplete genotypes (diploid)
correspond to homozygous (0 or 2) or heterozygous (1) sites in the pro-
band. In the HMM, the hidden states are the states of the tracts: IBD (I)
or not (N), and the observed values are the genotypes of the proband:
heterozygous (Z) or homozygous (H). Transitions between states depend
on the recombination rate r

available online as an R package. It uses a hidden Markov
model (HMM) to identify the parent and stage of meiosis in
which non-disjunction occurred and calls crossover locations
on the chromosome involved in non-disjunction from dense
SNP data. The method can be used on trio data or data from
only the proband and one parent, and takes into account geno-
typing errors and missing data. Moreover, our method can be
applied to diploid genotype data from the trisomic chromosome
(i.e. where ATT and AAT are both simply considered heterozy-
gous). We assessed the performance of our method using simu-
lated trisomic sequences based on individuals from the 1000
Genomes Project (The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium,
2012) and, to evaluate how well the method performed when
the father is masked, we applied the method to 282 trios with
trisomy 21 previously analyzed by Oliver et a]. (2012).

2 METHODS

As a consequence of a MI non-disjunction event, alleles at the centro-
meres of the disomic gamete are descended from distinct homologous
chromosomes, i.e. they are not identical by descent (NIBD). In contrast,
in the case of a MII non-disjunction event, alleles at the centromere come
from the same sister chromatids and therefore are identical by descent
(IBD). In the absence of recombination, all alleles are NIBD on MI
trisomic chromosomes, whereas all alleles are IBD in the case of MII
trisomic chromosomes. As shown in Figure l, a crossover on the premei—
otic tetrad may cause a switch from IBD to NIBD in the disomic gamete
transmitted to the proband, or vice versa. Whether it does depends on
which chromatids are involved in the crossovers and which two are
transmitted to the proband (Fig. la2 and Supplementary Material).

As a result of NIBD, heterozygosity of the non-disjoining parent
(N DJP) is retained in the proband. Therefore, heterozygosity levels can
be used to infer whether the region is IBD or NIBD and estimate the
location of a subset of crossovers that occurred on the tetrad. In turn, the
meiotic stage of non-disjunction can be inferred from the IBD state at the
centromere (Chakravarti and Slaugenhaupt, 1987). Although in principle
the stage can always be determined, regardless of whether all crossovers
are observable, in practice, the ﬁrst marker will not be at the centromere
but at some genetic distance away, and if there is a crossover between
them, the stage may be misclassiﬁed. Thus, in practice, the misclassiﬁca-
tion rate will be approximately equal to the distance between the ﬁrst
marker and the centromere (lower for metacentric chromosomes, in
which both arms are informative).

Motivated by these considerations, we used an HMM in which the
hidden states are the IBD status of a given locus in the proband and the
transition between states depends on the recombination rate. The method
assumes that the trisomic chromosome has been independently identiﬁed.
We note that if this were not the case, the trisomic chromosome could be
identiﬁed by an increase in the average sequencing read depth (see Fan
et al., 2008, and references therein) or from the raw genotype intensities
(e.g. Gabriel et al., 2011). The emission probabilities are calculated based
on the error model and Mendelian inheritance laws. We incorporated the
missing data for a given position (or the whole sequence in the male) and
possible diploid genotype of the proband as part of the error model.
Considering two alternative models (i.e. the mother versus the father as
the NDJP), we used the Forward algorithm to calculate the probability of
the proband’s genotype data, D, given each model. We used these prob-
abilities to calculate the Bayes factor, K = P(D|mother)/ P(leather),
which is then used to calculate the posterior odds ratio (OR)
P(motherlD)/P(father|D) = KP(mother)/P(father). A posterior OR >1
indicates that the mother is more likely to be the NDJ P. The prior prob-
abilities [i.e. P(mother),P(father)] can be speciﬁed based on previous
studies of trisomies for the chromosome of interest. Having determined
the individual in which non-disjunction occurred, we then used the
Viterbi algorithm to ﬁnd the most likely path and estimate the locations
of crossovers. Our method is similar to the one developed by Feingold
et a]. (2000), but applicable to a much larger number of markers; it also
differs in considering an explicit error model and in its treatment of
missing parental data.

We note that it is not feasible to identify all crossovers that have
occurred on the tetrad, as a subset will not generate a discernible
change from IBD to NIBD (or vice versa) in the proband. By direct
consideration of all possible crossovers between chromatids and possible
segregation patterns in MI and M11, we constructed a matrix showing the
proportions of observable crossovers (c’) for a given number of cross-
overs on the tetrad (c), for c = 1, 2, 3 and 4. These proportions are given
by the following two matrices, in which rows correspond to c and col-
umns correspond to c’ = 0, ..., c:

l l 0 0 0
i i 1 0 0

forMI,and
010 0 0
0 l l 0 0
QMII= iii 9 (2)
0 0

for MII errors. For example, if there are four crossovers on the tetrad and
an error occurs during MI, in only 6% of cases will all these crossovers be
detected; were the error to occur in M11 instead, all four crossovers can be
detected in 25% of cases.

2.1 The error model

In this section, we present an error model for genotyping data. An
alternative error model, more appropriate for next-generation sequencing
data, can be found in the Supplementary Material. Both models incorp-
orate genotyping errors in parental data as well as in the trisomic POC.
For a given locus, we represent individual genotypes by the number of
alternative alleles to the reference genome. Taking into account the
possibility of genotyping errors, we distinguish between the observed
and the true genotypes of the parents and the proband. Without loss of
generality, suppose that the mother is the NDJP. Let i, j e {0, 1, 2} and
k e {0, 1, 2, 3} denote the actual genotypes of the mother (NDJP),
the father and the proband, respectively. Similarly, let i’ , j’ ,k’ denote
the corresponding observed genotypes. When triploid data from the pro-
band are available, we have [6’ e {0, 1, 2, 3}, whereas for the diploid case,
[6’ 6 {0,1,2}. We extend our deﬁnition of observed genotypes for the
parent to include the missing data, i.e. i’ , j’ e {0, 1, 2, >1<}, where ‘*’ repre-
sents the missing genotype at a given position.

We consider symmetric genotyping error [e.g. P(A —> T) =
P(T —> A) = 6] and make the realistic assumption that the probability
of an error is given by 6 << 1. Let g,, ,1 be the conditional probability of
observing genotype 1" in the father or the mother given that the actual
value is i, i.e. gr, 1" = P(i’ Ii). We represent the probability of missing data
by c. As shown in the next section, the choice of the value of c does not
affect our calculations for the emission probabilities.

The error model for the diploid sequences of the parents is given by a
3 x 4 matrix with the convention that the fourth column corresponds to
missing genotypes. Ignoring terms of 0(62), we have

1—26 26 0 1756
G=(1—c) 6 1—26 6 1%,, (3)
0 26 1—26 L

,_.
I
n

Depending on whether we have diploid or triploid data from the
proband, we need to consider either a one-layer or a two-layer error
model. Let E denote the 4 X 4 error matrix for the trisomic sequence.
We assume that the sites with missing data in the proband have
been ﬁltered out. Under similar assumptions as for constructing G, we
obtain

1—36 36 0 0
6 1—36 26 0
E: 0 26 1—3e 6 ° (4)
0 0 36 1—36

We assume that when only diploid data for the proband are available,
genotype values 1,2 (e.g. 110,001) are more likely to be represented as
heterozygous (01), while 0, 3 are always represented as homozygous for
the reference and the alternative alleles, respectively. Therefore, for the
case of diploid data, we consider [6’ 6 {0,1,2} and the error matrix is
given by a 4 x 3 matrix H

1 0 0
oz 1—Ol 0

H_ 0 1—Ol oz ’ (5)
0 0 1

with 0 5 oz 5 1. An entry 11k, k1 of this matrix denotes the conditional
probability of observing the diploid genotype [6’ given complete triploid
genotype k. As an example, consider km 2 P(k’ = 1|k = 2) = 1 — 01. This
means that 110 (or 101,011, etc.) is mapped to 11 with probability 0:,
while it is mapped to 10 with probability 1 — 0:. Thus, at can be con-
sidered as an error in deciding whether a trisomic locus is heterozygous
or homozygous. Finally, the error matrix for the case of diploid data

This matrix deﬁnes the mapping from triploid data to diploid data. We
observe that, for 6 = 0: = 0, the second and the third row of the matrix
(corresponding to mapping 100 and 110 to 01) become identical, reﬂect-
ing the lack of discriminatory ability between these two cases.

3 IMPLEMENTATION

We approximate the transition process between IBD and NIBD
in the two chromosomes transmitted to the proband by the
NDJP by a non-homogeneous Markov chain. Let X, denote
the underlying hidden state at position n, with possible values
IBD (I) and NIBD (N).

The transition probability matrix can be written as

A =  _pI—>N(n) pI—>N(n) )
n pN—>I(n) 1 — pN—>I(n) 9

where p1_,N(n) :2 P(A/n+1 = NIX" = I) and pN_,1(n) :2
P(Xn+1 = Ian = N): given by

PN—>1(n) = rn p1 —l— p2/2) and

19mm) = rn(1 — 191/2)-

In these equations, rn denotes the probability of a crossover
between marker n and n + l on the tetrad, w,, is the map distance
between the nth marker and the centromere, p1 and p2 are the
prior probabilities of MI and MII errors, respectively, and y(w,,)
is the linkage parameter determining the probability that the two
copies of the nth marker on sister chromatids are NIBD (see
Chakravarti and Slaugenhaupt (1987) and the Supplementary
Material). The value of y, assuming no interference, is related
to the map distance by

y(W) = (2/3)(1 — e‘31”)

(Barratt et 61]., 1954; Chakravarti and Slaugenhaupt, 1987;
Mather, 1938), where w is the map distance in Morgans.

We assume that the loci under study are located on the long
arm of the chromosome and the ﬁrst position in the observed
trisomic sequence corresponds to the most centromeric locus.
The probability of the initial state of the chain is given by

W = (P29P1), (7)

in which p1 (corresponding to the NIBD state) and p2 (IBD state)
are based on our prior knowledge regarding the probabilities of
MI or MII errors. For metacentric chromosomes, the method
can be applied to each arm of the chromosome independently.
We note that, in principle, a different meiotic stage could be
inferred from each arm of the chromosome. This could reﬂect
error in the method, or the rare case where there is a crossover
between the centromere and the ﬁrst marker on one of the arms.
To derive the emission probabilities, we condition on the ma-
ternal and paternal genotype sequence (including missing geno-
types). Let M, F and 0 represent the observed sequences of the

mother, father and the (trisomic) proband, respectively. For a
given step n, let Bizjj/(k’lX) to denote the probability of observing
0,1 = [6’ given the hidden state X, with observed genotypic values
Mn 2 z",F,1 = j’ for the mother (here, the NDJP) and the father,
respectively, i.e.

B,,,,,(k’|X) = P(On = k’lX, Mn = i’,F,, =j’),
for some 16’ e {0, 1, 2, 3} and i’,j’ e {0,1,2,>1<}. Then we have

The values of ek, k/ are given by E in Equation (4) (in the case of
triploid data) and E x H in Equation (6) (for the case of diploid
data), and gm values are given by G in Equation (3). f,- denotes
the frequency of genotype 1' in the parent’s population of origin.
If individuals are from two different populations, we use dif-
ferent sets of values for the vector f = (fo,f1,f2) for each
parent. Assuming Hardy—Weinberg equilibrium within a popu-
lation, genotype frequencies can be calculated based on allele
frequencies. T X(k; i, j) denotes the probability of the proband’s
genotypic value being k, conditional on the mother (assumed to
be the NDJ P) having genotype 1', the father j and the hidden state
X at a given locus. Values of T X(k; i, j) can be calculated based on
Mendelian inheritance laws and are given in Table 1.

As an example, suppose that we have triploid genotype
data from the proband and 6 = 0. Thus, ekjk/ = 61,514, where
61,514 is the Kronecker Delta. Assuming no missing genotype
values, we have gm, 2 (l — c)6,-,,v. It is then easy to show
that Bi/jj/(k/IX) = T X(k’; i’,j’). Assuming that the paternal geno-
type value at a given locus is missing (1" = >l<), we obtain

3.1 Simulations

We used data from the 1000 Genomes project (The 1000
Genomes Project Consortium, 2012) to simulate trisomy 21 sam-
ples, assuming that both parents belong to the same population.
To roughly mimic a genotyping array, we selected at random
~2500 SNPs with minor allele frequency >l% from the long
arm of chromosome 21. An exact simulation of the process
would consist in a simulation of all four chromatids, where a
pair is chosen at random for each crossover, then non-disjunc-
tion occurs in MI or MII. Only a subset of such crossovers will
be observable in the chromatids transmitted to the proband,
however, and so most of the simulations would be uninformative
about the performance of the method in that regard. We instead
simulated observable crossovers by modeling crossovers on the
disomic gamete. We veriﬁed that taking this approach instead
makes no difference by comparing it with the full treatment (data
not shown).

Speciﬁcally, for a given number of observable crossovers
x e {0, l, 2} for each possible NDJP (mother or father) and for
each possible meiotic stage of non-disjunction (MI or MII), we
simulated 1000 trisomic samples, choosing the parents at random
from a pool of 200 individuals, for two different sets of popula-
tions. The ﬁrst set consists of individuals of African ancestry (15
ASW, 97 LWK and 88 YRI), which we denote AFR, and the
second set consists of individuals of European ancestry (4 CEU,
93 FIN, 89 GBR and 14 IBS), which we refer to as EUR. In
these simulations, we ignored crossover interference, and we
placed 0, l or 2 crossovers at random between some pair of
markers to simulate the NDJP’s disomic gamete [we did not
consider more events because the occurrence of three or more
crossovers is rare even in proper disjunctions, e.g. Fledel-Alon
et al. (2009)]. Subsequently, we generated errors based on the
error models presented in the previous section, assuming
6 = 5 x 10‘3 (Oliphant et al., 2002) and or 2 10‘3. We ran the
program for four possible scenarios, i.e. with triploid or diploid
genotypes and with or without the paternal genotypes. We also
applied the method on simulated trisomy 16 trios and obtained
the same qualitative results (data not shown).

4 RESULTS

We applied TroX to simulated trio data where either the mother
or the father is the source of non-disjunction and MI and MII
are equally likely. We assumed that the recombination rate be-
tween adjacent markers is constant and given by r = 10‘4 (i.e.
roughly the sex-averaged recombination rate per base pair, given
that the average distance between each pair is R510 kb). We also
tried using the sex-averaged HapMap genetic map instead, and
results were similar (not shown). We note that neither choice is
expected to represent the map in trisomies, which remains

unknown, but the results suggest that with dense markers, it
should not matter much.

We calculated the OR for the mother versus the father as the
source of non-disjunction, using prior odds of 50/50. As shown
in Figure 3 (for triploid data) and Supplementary Figure S2 (for
diploid data), the distributions of the log ORs are non-overlap-
ping, so maternal and paternal origin can be distinguished in all
cases, even when the paternal data are missing, enabling us to
detect the NDJ P with high reliability. The one exception is when
the non-disjunction event arose in MII, 0 crossovers occurred
and we have only diploid genotype data (see Supplementary
Figure S3). The reason can be understood as follows: in this
scenario, the sister chromatids are IBD throughout. Consider
an informative locus with maternal genotype 10, paternal geno-
type 11 and proband genotype 001. If we have triploid data and
no genotyping errors (6 = 0), we would observe the proband as
001 and conclude that the mother is the NDJ P. However, if we
only have diploid data from the proband and there is no bias in
mapping triploid to diploid data (or = 0), we observe the proband
as 01, which contains no information regarding the parent of
origin [i.e. the emission probabilities under both models are
equal in this case; see Equation (10) and Table l]. Counter-in-
tuitively, errors in mapping triploid to diploid data (05,6 75 0)
retain some information regarding the parental origin
(Supplementary Figure S2). This is because, with mapping
errors, the symmetry in emission probabilities breaks down [see
Equation (9) and Table 1].

Our results further suggest that the method performs well in
estimating the meiotic stage of the error (Fig. 4). In at least 98%
of cases with triploid genotypes, the correct stage is inferred,
irrespective of whether data from the father are available, and
a minimum of 94% of cases are called correctly only with diploid
data.

odds for MI versus MII. The error bars represent the 95% conﬁdence
intervals. The number of observable crossovers is shown on the x—axis.
Note that the y-axis is truncated

The method also performs well in estimating the number of
crossovers when we have data for the parent of origin of non-
disjunction (Fig. 5). As expected, however, when the father is
NDJP and yet his data are not available, the proportion of
cases in which the number of crossovers is correctly identiﬁed
decreases somewhat (down to 70% in the worst case). In prac-
tice, though, most non-disjunction events are of maternal origin
and DNA from the mother is easier to obtain, so this does not
represent an important limitation.

In most of the cases where the estimated number of crossovers
is incorrect, the method detects spurious double crossovers that
are close to each other. For example, for the case of MI/missing
paternal data applied on triploid genotypes with one true cross-
over, 8% of cases had an incorrect estimate of the number of
crossovers, and 60% of those were within 1 CM of another cross-
over. Because double crossovers in close proximity are highly
unlikely to be real, it is therefore possible to ﬁlter them out.
We also observe that in some cases when the father’s data are
not available, the method performs better in estimating the
number of crossovers when only diploid data are available
(Fig. 5). This counter-intuitive ﬁnding may reﬂect the fact that,
when the father’s data are missing, the emission probabilities are
more sensitive to allele frequencies when using triploid rather
than diploid data.

Next, we consider the accuracy with which we infer crossover
locations. As shown in Figure 6 (for CEU) and Supplementary
Figure S4 (for AFR), in most of the cases, the inferred location
of the crossover is within 200 kb of the true position (i.e. 20 SNPs

analyzed 282 trios with an offspring trisomic for chromosome 21,
in which an average of ~1270 SNPs were genotyped. Triploid
genotypes were called using a clustering method described in Lin
et al. (2008). The data are a subset of those described in Oliver
et al. (2012). For our prior on recombination rates, we used the
sex-averaged ﬁne-scale genetic map for proper disjunctions,
inferred from HapMap data (The International HapMap
Consortium, 2007). Information regarding the ancestry of the
individuals was available for 137 families (103 European/
Hispanic—American, 29 African—American and 5 Asian—
American, based on self-reporting). For those, we used allele
frequencies from the 1000 Genomes Project (The 1000
Genomes Project Consortium, 2012) from European ancestry
(CEU), Yoruban ancestry (YRI) as well as Japanese and
Chinese ancestries (ASN). For trios without self-reported ances-
try, we used CEU allele frequencies. To infer the NDJP, we
assumed that the prior odds of the mother being NDJP are
9:1, based on prior studies of chromosome 21 non-disjunction
(e.g. Hassold et al. (1996)). We identiﬁed the parent of origin as
the one with an OR of 10:1 in his/her favor and considered the
parent undecided otherwise (thus requiring the likelihood of the
father to be >100 times that of the mother to call the father as
NDJP).

We compared our results with those of a previous analysis on
the same data (Oliver et al., 2012), which looked at retention of
heterozygosity of SNPs and Short Tandem Repeats (STR) to
infer the source and stage of non-disjunction as well as the loca-
tions of crossovers, using the data from both parents (see Oliver
et al. (2008, 2012) for more information). Their method does not
have an error model and hence markers were ﬁltered for quality.
However, in our analysis, we used all SNPs, including those
judged to be of lower quality, and an error rate of
6 = 5 X 10‘3 (Oliphant et al., 2002).

In making the comparison, we created a set of crossover calls
that we believe to be most reliable. Notably, we excluded cases
where crossover events were supported by fewer than ﬁve SNPs
on one side to minimize artifacts due to chromosome edges [e. g.
Fledel-Alon et al. (2009); Kong et al.,(2004)]. We further
excluded double crossovers within 2cm, which are highly un-
likely to be real (Fledel-Alon et al., 2009), but arise at non-
negligible rates in simulations (e.g. 1.3% among 1000 cases of
triploid data with paternal data). Application of both ﬁlters af-
fected two of the conﬁrmed calls made by the previous method,
ﬁve made by TroX with the paternal data and nine made by
TroX without paternal data.

As in the Oliver et al. (2012) analysis, TroX identiﬁes all but
two non-disjunction events as maternal (the two paternal cases
are MI and have no crossovers). With paternal data, we ﬁnd
79% to be due to errors in MI, whereas Oliver et al. (2012)
infer 76%; without paternal data, we estimate that fraction to
be 78%. Our results regarding the stage and the number of cross-
overs are also in close agreement with the previous analysis, even
though we do not ﬁlter out low-quality genotypes (but instead
use an error model; Fig. 7). With paternal data, our estimates of
the number of crossovers and the stage of the error are identical
to the ones made by the previous method in 262 cases (93%).
This number reduces only slightly, to 259 (92%) when we mask
the paternal data. The only effect of masking the father’s data

The TroX analyses were obtained by applying the method to triploid
proband data with and without using paternal genotype data. The
Oliver et a]. (2012) results come from the application of a method out-
lined in their paper to the same data, using paternal genotype data. Left
panel: MI non-disjunction. Right panel: MII non-disjunction. The error
bars represent the 95% conﬁdence intervals

appears to be an overestimation of the instances of three cross-
overs in MII (in two cases; Fig. 7).

5 DISCUSSION

Existing methods for analyzing human trisomies using dense
SNP data rely on the availability of DNA samples from both
the mother and the father. However, it is often impractical to
obtain a sample from the father, which in turn causes in a drastic
reduction of full trios for study. For example, in a prospective
study of recurrent miscarriages, paternal DNA was not available
in ~80% of the cases (Z. Williams, personal communication). By
requiring only the sequence from the mother and the proband,
our method overcomes this limitation.

Importantly, our results suggest that even with diploid data,
missing data from the male do not affect our estimates of the
number of crossovers and stage of the error, unless the father is
the NDJP. In this case, estimates of crossover locations become
less reliable. However, this scenario should constitutes <10%
of all cases [assuming that in 80% of the cases the data from
the father are not available and a ~10% chance that the father is
the NDJP (Hassold and Hunt, 2001)]. Thus, for most practical
purposes, a sample from the father is unnecessary for these in-
ferences, and therefore, our method allows one to reduce experi-
mental costs by a third. A further advantage of our method is
that, by incorporating an explicit error model, it bypasses the
need to ﬁlter markers somewhat arbitrarily in ways that could
introduce differences among studies. In addition, the method
allows for missing parental data at a given site, increasing the
number of markers that can be used.

Our simulations further indicate that, without paternal data,
the method performs better in estimating the number of cross-
overs when applied to AFR populations as compared with CEU
populations (Supplementary Figures S5). One explanation is that
in our model, we ignore linkage disequilibrium (LD) among sites
and because LD levels are higher in EUR population, this as-
sumption may be more problematic. We examined this hypoth-
esis by applying the method on simulated sequences with no LD,
and indeed, the method performs better in this case (data not

shown). If precise resolution of crossovers is not important to the
speciﬁc study, one solution might then be to thin the markers so
to minimize LD among them, or alternatively to thin the markers
to call crossovers and then localize them using all the data.

One limitation of our method is that it relies on accurate
knowledge about the ancestry of the parent whose data are miss-
ing. To assess the effect of using incorrect ancestry information,
we switched population labels between CEU and AFR in the
trisomy 21 samples, and reanalyzed the data. Our results suggest
that the reliability of inference about the parent of origin remains
the same and in 97% of the cases, estimates of the meiotic stage
of the error are unaffected. In contrast, estimates of the number
of crossovers become less reliable, with 23% of cases showing a
different number than with the correct ancestry (13% after ap-
plication of our ﬁlters). A related problem is what would happen
if the parent whose data are missing is admixed. Both problems
could be overcome either by extending this approach to consider
the ancestries as additional parameters to be inferred by the
method or by using methods such as principal component ana-
lysis (e.g. Patterson et at, 2006; Novembre et at, 2008) to infer
the ancestry of the missing parent from the proband and mater-
nal genotype data.

In conclusion, the rapid decrease in genotyping and sequen-
cing costs, in combination with the advent of non-invasive
approaches to sample fetal DNA from a maternal blood
sample (Fan et at, 2008, 2012; Palomaki et at, 2012), allow
the genomes of mother and fetus to be readily surveyed.
Among these will be a substantial fraction of cases in which
the fetus is trisomic. Application of our method and related
approaches to such data should yield unprecedented insight
into recombination proﬁles that underlie non-disjunction and
ultimately help to identify risk factors of aneuploidy in humans.

An open source R package implementing our approach is
available at http://przeworski.uchicago.edu/. Users can choose
one of our error models or specify their own.

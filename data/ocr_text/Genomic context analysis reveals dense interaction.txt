ABSTRACT

Motivation: Genomic context analysis, also known as phylogenetic
profiling, is widely used to infer functional interactions between
proteins but rarely applied to non-coding cis-regulatory DNA
elements. We were wondering whether this approach could provide
insights about utIraconserved non-coding elements (UCNEs). These
elements are organized as large clusters, so-called gene regulatory
blocks (GRBs) around key developmental genes. Their molecular
functions and the reasons for their high degree of conservation
remain enigmatic.

Results: In a special setting of genomic context analysis, we
analyzed the fate of GRBs after a whole-genome duplication event
in five fish genomes. We found that in most cases all UCNEs were
retained together as a single block, whereas the corresponding target
genes were often retained in two copies, one completely devoid
of UCNEs. This ‘winner—takes-all’ pattern suggests that UCNEs of
a GRB function in a highly cooperative manner. We propose that
the multitude of interactions between UCNEs is the reason for their
extreme sequence conservation.

1 INTRODUCTION

Genomic context analysis (Huynen et al., 2000) is a comparative
evolutionary approach to infer interactions between protein—coding
genes. The STRING database (Szklarczyk et al., 2011) distinguishes
three types of evolutionary evidence for interactions: co—occurrence
in the same species, co—localization in the same chromosome
region and gene fusion. Co—occurrence analysis is the most widely
applicable variant and has been termed phylogenetic proﬁling
(Pellegrini et al., 1999). The co—localization or neighborhood
criterion is primarily used in prokaryotes where genes participating
in the same pathway are often arranged in a single operon. Gene
fusion is a less frequent event, but probably constitutes the strongest
type of evolutionary evidence that two proteins encoded by separate
genes in some genomes physically interact with each other.

In principle, genomic context analysis should be applicable
to non—coding sequences as well. The neighborhood criterion is
ideally suited to infer interactions involving cis—acting regulatory
elements as such elements by deﬁnition have to reside on the
same chromosome with their interaction partners. Nevertheless,
with a notable exception discussed further below, genomic context
analysis has rarely or never been applied to non—coding sequences.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

In this work we present an application of this method to vertebrate
ultraconserved non—coding sequence elements, henceforth referred
to as UCNEs.

Vertebrate UCNEs are the most conserved sequences that exist
in nature. The term was originally coined by Bejerano et al. who
deﬁned ultraconserved elements as sequence regions that are at least
200—bp long and 100% identical between human, mouse and rat
(2004). Somewhat different deﬁnitions have been applied by other
groups (see Elgar and Vavouri, 2008). In a previous work, we deﬁned
UCNEs as non—coding elements that are at least 200—bp long and
have evolved at a substitution rate of <0.01% per million years
(Retelska et al., 2007).

The reasons for ultraconservation remain enigmatic. No molecular
mechanism is known that would require such a high degree of
conservation. It is broadly accepted that a majority of UCNEs
act as tissue—speciﬁc enhancers (Woolfe et al., 2005). A few may
function as splicing regulators (Lareau et al., 2007) or as non—
coding RNAs (Calin et al., 2007). Surprisingly, genetically altered
mice lacking particular UCNEs were found to be viable with no
detectable phenotype (Ahituv et al., 2007). It could be argued that the
phenotypes may be too mild to be recognized by human researchers
but still severe enough to be removed by purifying selection in nature
over many generations.

A striking property of UCNEs is their tendency to occur as large
clusters on the genome (Sandelin et al., 2004). Such clusters, also
referred to as genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs), may comprise up
to 100 UCNEs, span over more than a megabase, and include up to
a dozen of genes. Within a GRB, the UCNEs appear to be randomly
localized with respect to genes, with approximately equal numbers
located in introns and intergenic regions, respectively. The order of
individual elements is strictly conserved between distant vertebrate
species resulting in perfect synteny of the corresponding genes. It is
assumed that GRBs in general have only one target gene. The other
genes within the block are called bystander genes.

In an elegant and pioneering study by Kikuta et al. (2007) the
neighborhood principle of genomic context analysis was used to
discriminate between target and bystander genes of GRBs in ﬁsh
genomes. For most vertebrate species, the neighborhood criterion
would be useless because the synteny within GRBs is perfectly
conserved. However, the situation is radically different in teleost
ﬁshes which have undergone a lineage—speciﬁc whole—genome
duplication (WGD). After the WGD event, most genes survived in
only one copy and the same may be true for gene regulatory elements
as well. Within a duplicated GRB, bystander genes may be retained
randomly by one or the other copy. However, the UCNEs will always
stay with their target genes. The availability of ﬁve ﬁsh genomes
with potentially different gene loss histories after WGD increases
the power of the method. In fact, numerous cases of reciprocal gene

loss were observed between the lineages leading to zebraﬁsh and
Tetraodon (Semon and Wolfe, 2007). We should mention in this
context that the fate of conserved non—coding elements after WGD
was also analyzed to address questions about subfunctionalization
(Woolfe and Elgar, 2007).

In this work, we also exploit the WGD event that has happened
in teleosts. However, we address a different question. We are not
primarily interested in UCNE—target gene relationships. Our focus
is on cooperative interactions between UCNEs within the same
block. Speciﬁcally, we use genomic context analysis to discriminate
between two models of UCNE action, which may be called
‘standalone’ and ‘cooperative’. The standalone model assumes that
each UCNE acts independently, whereas the cooperative model
assumes that two or more UCNEs jointly drive expression of the
target gene in a particular tissue. The two modes of gene regulation
are illustrated in Figure 1 with a minimal GRB consisting of
three UCNEs. In the standalone mode, each UCNE drives gene
expression in one of three different tissues. In the cooperative
mode, three different pairwise combinations drive the expression
in three different tissues. The fate of UCNEs after WGD could
potentially discriminate between these two scenarios. If UCNEs act
independently of each other they will be randomly distributed over
the daughter genes. If UCNEs cooperate with one another they have
to be jointly retained with one daughter gene. We should mention
that the discriminatory power of this approach depends on two
conditions: (i) the target genes are frequently retained in two copies
after WGD and (ii) individual UCNEs are frequently retained in
only one copy. Fortunately, these conditions are met, as will become
evident from the results presented further below.

The reminder of this article is organized as follows. Section 2
describes the computational protocols at a technical level. In Section
3, we present two largely independent studies. The ﬁrst part centers

on putative target genes that are highly enriched in intronic UCNEs.
In the second part, we analyze the fate of the most prominent GRBs
after WGD. This part also includes a non—technical description of
the computational protocol used to trace—back the individual pieces
of duplicated GRBs after potential synteny breaks. Conclusions and
perspectives are presented in the last section.

2 METHODS
2.1 Identiﬁcation of UCNEs

We scanned whole—genome alignments between human (hg19) and chicken
(galGal3) genomes provided by the UCSC Genome Browser (Fujita et al.,
2011) in order to extract the human sequence regions where the percentage
of sequence identity consistently is 295%. These two reference species were
selected for this work because they are well suited to deﬁne synteny blocks
in view of the evolutionary distance and high quality of genome assembly
(Section 2.5.1). The sequence identity was computed in an asymmetric
fashion by taking the human genome as a reference and counting the number
of conserved bases in the target species in a 61—bp sliding window. According
to previous experience (Retelska et al., 2007), this window size offers a good
trade—off between spatial resolution and stability of the signal. The number
obtained from one window was used to assign a percentage identity value
to the base at the center of the window. The numbers from the ﬁrst and last
window were also used to assign missing percentage identity values to the
30 bases at the beginning and at the end of the aligned sequence regions.

Based on the ‘RefSeq Genes’ annotation track for the human genome
(hg19) downloaded from the UCSC Genome Browser, we ﬁltered out
sequences (or parts of sequences) that overlap with coding regions. After that,
we eliminated sequences that were <200 bp. The remaining 4386 sequences
composed our set of UCNEs (Supplementary Table 81).

Each of these UCNEs was classiﬁed as intronic, UCNE within an
untranslated region (UTR) or intergenic using the human RefSeq gene
annotation.

2.2 Identiﬁcation of UCNE homologs in ﬁsh genomes

We analyzed the retention of each UCNE in ﬁve ﬁsh genomes: F ugu (fr2),
medaka (oryLat2), stickleback (gasAcul), T etraodon (tetNig2) and zebraﬁsh
(danRer7). We used the program SSEARCH v36.3.5 from the FASTA
package (fasta.bioch.virginia.edu/) (Pearson, 1996) to compute the optimal
local alignment score between each human UCNE and each conserved
ﬁsh genomic sequence. For this purpose, we extracted all ﬁsh sequences
alignable to a human region according to the ﬁsh—human pairwise alignments
downloaded from the UCSC Genome Browser. SSEARCH was then again
used a posteriOri to compute a base composition—adjusted E —value for each
aligned region by shufﬂing the ﬁsh sequence 500 times in windows of 20 bp.
Aligned ﬁsh sequences with E —value < 10‘4 were accepted as homologs.

2.3 Identiﬁcation of paralogs of UCNEs

A ﬁsh homolog of a human UCNE could be a direct ortholog of the UCNE
under consideration, or an ortholog of a paralog of the human UCNE. To
eliminate paralogs of the latter type, we ﬁrst compiled a list of paralogs
of human UCNEs. This was done by aligning each human UCNE to all
human sequences extracted from human—chicken pairwise alignments from
UCSC, using SSEARCH exactly as described above. Note that the human
paralogs identiﬁed in this way may themselves not qualify as UCNEs. Using
the human paralog list, we compared each ﬁsh homolog of a human UCNE
to all human paralogs if there were any. If a better alignment score (lower
E —value) was obtained with a paralog, then the ﬁsh homolog was considered
a paralog of the speciﬁc human UCNE under consideration.

2.4 Analysis of UCNE-enriched genes

2.4.] Classiﬁcation of retention patterns of intronic and UTR UCNEs in
ﬁsh orthologous genes Our initial set of UCNEs consists of 2220 UCNEs
residing within introns and UTRs of 618 human genes. Orthologous genes in
the ﬁve ﬁsh genomes were compiled from Ensembl v64 (Flicek et al., 2011).
Genes annotated as ‘possible orthologs’ were also included. We discarded
the human genes for which either none of the ﬁsh orthologous genes retained
UCNEs or none of the ﬁsh species retained more than one ortholog. In total,
we analyzed 204 test cases of gene—UCNE associations. The UCNE retention
patterns were then assigned to three groups referred to as ‘winner—takes—all’,
‘concordant retention’ and ‘reciprocal retention’. To this end, we counted
the number of UCNEs retained by each gene of a group of orthologs in a
ﬁsh species. The orthologous gene with the highest number of UCNEs was
denoted as ‘major ortholog’, the other(s) as ‘minor ortholog(s)’ (occasionally,
there were more than two annotated orthologs). The classiﬁcation was then
based on three numbers. Let a be the number of UCNEs retained only by the
major ortholog, b the number of UCNEs retained by both the major and minor
orthologs and c the number of UCNEs retained only by the minor ortholog(s).
Then a case was classiﬁed as ‘winner—takes—all’ if a/(a+ b + c) > 0.8, as
‘reciprocal retention’ if c/ (a + b + c) > 0.2, and as ‘concordant retention’
in all other cases.

2.4.2 Quantifying the biased retention of intronic/UTR UCNEs in ﬁsh
orthologous genes To quantitatively demonstrate the biased retention of
intronic/UTR UCNEs in ﬁsh orthologs of a given species we determined a
‘winner score’ for each case. This was done as follows: ﬁrst, we deﬁned a
conservation score Cl‘j for each human UCNE i in each ﬁsh ortholog j. This
score is equal to the bitscore of the optimal alignment, if an ortholog with a
corresponding E—value < 10‘4 exists and zero otherwise. The total amount
of conserved UCNEs for the human reference gene is then determined as
follows:

C W = maxc--.
2 .- a
The amount of conserved UCNEs in the major orthologous gene is
Cwinner : max C”.
.- 2 a

The winner score is the percentage of UCNEs retained by the major gene:

winner

Swinner : — X 100.
Ctot
Note that we considered only the cases with two or more ﬁsh orthologs where
three or more intronic/U TR UCNEs are retained in the major ortholog.

To compare the histogram of the winner scores with the expected
distribution from a random retention model, we computed the mean
histogram frequencies from 500 shufﬂed datasets. The shufﬂing was done by
randomly permuting the assignment of conservation scores to orthologous
genes for one human UCNE at a time.

2.5 Analysis of UCNE clusters

2.5.] Deﬁnition and gene annotation of human UCNE clusters UCNEs
that occur in arrays at orthologous chromosomal locations in the human
(hg19) and chicken (galGal3) genomes were grouped into clusters. An array
of UCNEs forms a cluster if (i) all UCNEs occur on the same chromosome in
the corresponding genome and (ii) any two neighboring UCNEs are separated
by <0.5 Mb in both human and chicken genomes.

For each cluster, we recorded the names of the human genes associated
with the cluster. A gene is considered associated with a cluster, if it contains
an intronic/U TR UCNE or if it is adjacent to an intergenic UCNE from the
cluster. Only protein—coding genes with annotated coding regions and not
marked as pseudogenes were considered.

2.5.2 Identiﬁcation of orthologous syntenic subclusters of UCNEs in a
ﬁsh genome For each human UCNE cluster we identiﬁed orthologous
syntenic subclusters of UCNEs in each ﬁsh genome. An orthologous syntenic
subcluster is a set of UCNE orthologs that occur as a cluster on the same
chromosome or scaffold in the ﬁsh genome, such that any two neighboring
UCNEs are separated by <0.5 Mb. From the set of orthologous syntenic
subclusters we determined the one that has retained the highest number of
UCNEs after whole—genome duplication and we refer to it as the ‘major
orthologous subcluster’. The rest of the orthologous syntenic subclusters are
referred to as ‘minor orthologous subclusters’.

Due to uncertainties or errors in the ﬁsh genome assembly, a natively
syntenic region may be split over two or more discontinuous regions.
To overcome this problem, we manually checked the minor orthologous
subclusters and merged minor subclusters with the major orthologous
subcluster under the following conditions: (i) the minor subcluster is located
on a genomic region that is not assigned to any chromosome; (ii) the minor
subcluster is surrounded by gaps on both sides according to the annotation
provided by the UCSC Genome Browser and (iii) the two subclusters map
to non—overlapping regions of the human UCNE cluster.

For each human gene that is associated with a UCNE cluster we extracted a
list of corresponding othologous genes in the ﬁve ﬁsh genomes as described
in Section 2.4.1. Using this list we identiﬁed ﬁsh orthologous genes that
are associated with each orthologous syntenic subcluster. In a ﬁsh genome,
a gene is considered associated with a UCNE subcluster if it contains an
intronic/UTR UCNE or if it is located at a distance <0.1 Mb from the
nearest conserved UCNE of the subcluster. (Repeating the whole analysis
with a distance threshold of 0.5 Mb produced virtually identical results).

Retention patterns of the major and minor orthologous syntenic
subclusters were classiﬁed as described for genes in Section 2.4.1.

2.6 Evolutionary simulation protocol

We ﬁrst deﬁned a cluster of N UCNEs, all located upstream of a target
gene. Then we randomly selected a fraction q of interacting pairs. After
duplications of the clusters, we randomly applied two types of mutational
events to one of the clusters at a time, synteny breaks or single UCNE knock—
outs. Mutations were accepted if at least one copy of each interacting pair
stayed connected to the target gene. The evolutionary process was continued
until no further mutations were possible. Simulations for a given parameter
combination N, q were repeated 10 000 times.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Analysis of UCNE-enriched genes

We ﬁrst focused on intronic and UTR—associated UCNEs of putative
target genes that have been retained in two copies in one of
the following ﬁve completely sequenced ﬁsh species: zebraﬁsh,
stickleback, medaka, Tetraodon and F aga. Although this approach
may be criticized for looking only at parts of a natural biological
unit, namely a GRB, it offers other advantages. Most importantly,
we can circumvent many difﬁculties related to synteny breaks and
assembly errors, as annotated orthologs of human genes are free of
either type of discontinuity.

To compile candidate cases, we selected 2220 UCNEs that
overlapped with non—coding parts of human genes (intronic/UTR
UCNEs). We ranked the human genes by the number of UCNEs
they contain and selected those where we could ﬁnd at least two
orthologous genes and at least three conserved UCNEs in one or
several ﬁsh genomes. Since many of the UCNE—enriched genes have
in fact been retained in two copies after WGD, we were able to
compile many test cases for our study.

To assess the fate of UCNEs in ﬁsh orthologous genes, we
ﬁrst identiﬁed sequences orthologous to UCNEs (Section 2). We
then determined the number of conserved UCNEs in each ﬁsh
ortholog and declared the ﬁsh ortholog with the highest number
‘major ortholog’, and the other one ‘minor ortholog’. Based on the
numbers of UCNEs conserved only in the major, the minor or in
both orthologs, respectively, we classiﬁed the retention patterns as
‘winner—takes—all’, ‘reciprocal retention’ or ‘concordant retention’.
The ‘winner—takes—all’ retention pattern denotes that one ﬁsh gene
retains many UCNEs whereas the other one loses all (or most—see
Section 2). A typical example is shown in Figure 2. ‘Concordant
retention’ denotes that the same UCNEs are retained in both copies
of the ﬁsh orthologs. ‘Reciprocal retention’ means that different
UCNEs are retained in the ﬁsh orthologs. Surprisingly, the majority
of the genes exhibited the ‘winner—takes—all’ pattern (Table 1,
Supplementary Fig. S 1, for full results see Supplementary Table S2).

To provide statistical support for our claim, we computed for each
test case the amount of conserved UCNEs retained by the major
ortholog, as a percentage of the total amount of conserved UCNEs
in the two orthologs. In this analysis we considered also the length

standard deviation computed from 500 simulations

and alignment scores of the conserved UCNEs (see Section 2). The
distribution of this statistic is shown in Figure 3A. We note that in
81% of the cases, one gene takes 100% of the UCNEs.

We then repeated the same analysis with permuted data reﬂecting
a random retention model. In this case, only 9% of all genes retain
100%. Taking into account the error bars in Figure 3B, the difference
is highly signiﬁcant. In conclusion, we interpret the preponderance
of the winner—takes—all pattern as strong evidence for a cooperative
mechanism of UCNE function.

3.2 Analysis of UCNE-clusters

To better understand the reasons for the ‘winner—takes—all’ retention
pattern, we extended the analysis to complete regulatory blocks
operationally deﬁned as clusters of UCNEs. We deﬁned clusters
as syntenic arrays with a maximal distance of 0.5 Mb between

The potential target genes of a cluster are marked in bold. An a — b — c pattern stands for: a—number of UCNEs in the ‘major’ cluster only, b—number of UCNEs commonly present
in the ‘major’ and ‘minor(s)’ clusters, c—number of UCNEs present in the ‘minor(s)’ cluster only. The classiﬁcation column denotes the number of cases where the corresponding

pattern is observed.

adjacent UCNEs in both the chicken and human genome. We
then ranked the clusters identiﬁed in this way by the number of
UCNEs and focused on the top 25 clusters (Table 2) (we assume
that these clusters correspond to GRBs). Then we tried to identify
ortholologous regions in the target ﬁsh genomes. This task is more
difﬁcult with GRBs than with individual genes as we have to assume
that synteny breaks may have occurred in at least one of the clusters.

Our analysis strategy is guided by the assumption that at least
one cluster copy has to stay intact after WGD. Practically we
proceeded as shown in Figure 4. We ﬁrst searched for orthologs
of the UCNEs in the ﬁsh genomes. The genomic coordinates of the
UCNE orthologs identiﬁed in this way were used to deﬁne syntenic
orthologous regions in the ﬁsh genomes. Typically, we found one to
three syntenic regions with multiple UCNEs, occasionally also a few
singletons. Next, we eliminated a few syntenic subclusters composed

of ancient paralogous UCNEs resulting from earlier WGD events,
some of which were described in (McEwen et al., 2006). At the
end, we declared the orthologous region with the highest number of
orthologous UCNEs the ‘major subcluster’. All other regions were
considered as ‘minor’ regions. The retention statistics was carried
in the same way as for the single genes.

For each GRB, we also tried to identify potential target genes.
For each gene associated to a human GRB, we checked whether
its orthologs in the ﬁve ﬁsh species are UCNE—associated or not
according to a co—localization criterion (see Section 2). Each gene
that has at least one UCNE—associated ortholog in all ﬁve ﬁsh species
is considered a potential target gene; the others are considered
bystander genes.

All results from the cluster analysis are summarized in Table 2
and Supplementary Figure S2 (for full results see Supplementary

Table S3). Details for one example (ZEB2) are presented in Figure 5.
Overall, the winner—takes—all trend is conﬁrmed. However, we see
a larger number of imperfect reciprocal retention patterns. We also
were surprised to see a striking difference between the retention
patterns of the same GRB in different ﬁsh species. For instance,
the ZEB2 cluster displays a classical winner—takes—all pattern in all
species except zebraﬁsh, where we observe reciprocal retention.

3.3 Validation by evolutionary simulations

To better understand the quantitative relationship between the
connectivity of a cis-regulatory network and the resulting retention
patterns, we carried out evolutionary simulations with artiﬁcial
GRBs consisting of N UCNEs and a fraction of q cis-interacting
pairs. We found that at least 60% connectivity (q 2 0.6) is required
in order to achieve >75% winner—takes—all cases. Surprisingly,
this relationship appears to be independent of the cluster size
N. Although these simulations may be criticized for being over—
simpliﬁed (notably they ignore potentially deleterious effects of
gain—of—function mutations) they make clear that the winner—takes—
all pattern is not an obvious evolutionary outcome. Within the
explanatory framework we propose, the high incidence of the
winner—takes—all pattern can only be explained by a high degree
of connectivity of the UCNE interaction network.

4 DISCUSSION

In this work, we have addressed the question whether UCNEs
of a GRB act independently of one another, or in a cooperative
manner. Using a special setting of genomic context analysis, we
presented evidence in support of the cooperative mode of action.
This cooperativity can be viewed as a second layer of combinatorial
gene regulation. Traditionally, this concept has been applied to
transcription factor binding sites within a gene regulatory region. It
has been argued that a great variety of different response behaviors
could be achieved through different combinations of relatively few

Question marks indicate line breaks that may not be real. The break in the
major zebraﬁsh cluster corresponds to a local inversion potentially resulting
from an assembly error

different transcription factors—binding sites. We propose that this
kind of combinatorics extends to the next higher level of gene
regulatory units, namely to GRBs composed of UCNEs.

The cooperative model of UCNE action has implications for
experimental strategies to elucidate their function. At ﬁrst sight
the model seems to be in conﬂict with experiments showing that
single UCNEs can drive tissue—speciﬁc gene expression in mouse or
zebraﬁsh embryos. Our ﬁndings could be reconciliated with this
fact by assuming that UCNEs have an intrinsic gene activating
capability with loose tissue speciﬁcity dependent on interactions
with neighboring UCNEs to achieve the higher degree of regulatory
precision needed for in vivo function. Regardless of the precise
reasons, the cooperative model suggests that reporter gene assays in
mouse embryos with single UCNEs cannot reveal the true function
of these elements (though they may be effective in distinguishing
tissue—speciﬁc enhancers from other types of UCNEs). In vein with
this, our cooperative model gets support from in vivo deletion
experiments, where combinations of conserved non—coding elements
were knocked out in their native genomic context (Montavon et al.,
2011). In this study, complex non—additive effects of combinations of
mutations were observed, and physical interactions between mutated
elements could be demonstrated by chromosome conformation
capture technology.

One of the open questions arising from our work is why target
genes that have lost all UCNEs are nevertheless retained in extant
ﬁsh genomes. One possible explanation is that they underwent
neofunctionalization in the protein—coding part or regulatory regions.
This hypothesis could potentially be tested by comparative genomics
methods, and thus constitutes one of our agenda item for future work.
We note in this context that many of the bona ﬁde target genes of

Dense interaction network between UCNEs

 

GRBs have paralogs that were retained after two earlier WGD events
that have occurred in vertebrate evolution (e.g. Foxp1—4).

The most exciting aspect of our work is that it suggests an
explanation for ultraconservation. In fact, a dense cooperativity
network interconnecting many UCNEs could be responsible for
both their high conservation and strong clustering on the genome.
If one element interacts with many others then each interaction
will add constraints on the base sequence. Similar ideas have been
raised in the context of experimental studies of physical interactions
between non—coding elements using chromosome conformation
capture technology (Robyr et al., 2011). The principle that many
interactions imply high conservation is well accepted for proteins.
For instance, the ultraconservation of histone proteins is commonly
explained by the fact that these proteins have to properly interact
with hundreds of other nuclear proteins. Hence, if ultraconservation
is the consequence of interactions with neighboring elements, it
follows that UCNEs can only exist in the vicinities of other UCNEs.
If this view is correct then GRBs were created by a concerted
evolutionary process during which the degree of conservation of
individual elements has increased proportionally to the number of
elements within the block. The few UCNEs which occur outside
clusters may be splicing regulators or RNA genes rather than
cis—acting regulatory elements. Their high degree of sequence
conservation may also be due to many molecular interactions but not
cis—interactions. Hence, the genes encoding their trans—interaction
partners can be spread all over the genome.

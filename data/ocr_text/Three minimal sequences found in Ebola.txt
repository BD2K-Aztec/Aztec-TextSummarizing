Abstract

Motivation: Ebola virus causes high mortality hemorrhagic fevers, with more than 25 000 cases
and 10000 deaths in the current outbreak. Only experimental therapies are available, thus, novel
diagnosis tools and druggable targets are needed.

Results: Analysis of Ebola virus genomes from the current outbreak reveals the presence of short
DNA sequences that appear nowhere in the human genome. We identify the shortest such
sequences with lengths between 12 and 14. Only three absent sequences of length 12 exist and
they consistently appear at the same location on two of the Ebola virus proteins, in all Ebola virus
genomes, but nowhere in the human genome. The alignment—free method used is able to identify
pathogen—specific signatures for quick and precise action against infectious agents, of which the
current Ebola virus outbreak provides a compelling example.

1 Introduction

Ebola virus (EBOV) is a negative strand—RNA virus from the
Filoviridae family that causes high mortality hemorrhagic fevers, for
which no vaccine or treatment currently eXist (Sarwar et al., 2014).
There are five Ebolaz/irus species, namely, Zaire ebolaz/irus, Sudan
ebolaz/irus, Bundibugyo ebolaz/irus, Tai Forest ebolaz/irus and
Reston ebolaz/irus, with the first (1976) and major (2014) outbreaks
caused by the type species Zaire ebolaz/irus (Baize et al., 2014).

The numbers of the largest ever EBOV outbreak are worrying
and continue escalating, with over 25 000 cases and 10 000 deaths
from the virus mainly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, accord—
ing to the World Health Organization. The current outbreak is also
the first where transmission has occurred outside Africa, with re—
ported cases in Europe (Spain) and America (USA; Butler and
Morello, 2014). Promising vaccine candidate tests are being rushed
to face the epidemics and could be available within a few months

(Gulland, 2014). These yet experimental therapies include, for eX—
ample, recombinant viral vectors (Jones et al., 2005) or antibodies
that target the viral glycoprotein (GP; Friedrich et al., 2012; Sarwar
et al., 2014), but innovative approaches are still needed for the de—
velopment of diagnosis tools and identification of druggable targets.

Minimal absent words are the shortest sequence fragments that
are not present in the genomic data of a given organism. They have
been studied before to describe properties of prokaryotic and
eukaryotic genomes and to develop methods for phylogeny con—
struction or PCR primer design (Chairungsee and Crochemore,
2012; Falda et al., 2014; Garcia et al., 2011; Herold et al., 2008;
Pinho et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2010). Here, we introduce minimal
relative absent words (RAW), a concept which has not been used so
far in the context of personalized medicine, but which is deemed
useful for differential identification of sequences that are derived
from a pathogen genome but absent from its host.

We use the current EBOV outbreak sequences, which were re—
cently published (Gire et al., 2014), to discover and characterize the
minimal RAWs that are present in EBOV genomes but absent from
the human genome. Moreover, we show that these words are also
absent from the other Ebolaz/irus species and even from the genomes
obtained from previous outbreaks. Thus, the sequences that we
identify are species—specific and important for future development of
diagnosis or therapeutic strategies for EBOV. The method that we
introduce can be applied to other emerging pathogens or to show
evidence of evolutionary patterns and signatures across species.

2 Methods

2.1 Relative absent words
Consider a target sequence (e.g. a virus sequence), x, and a reference
sequence (e.g. the human genome), 3/, both drawn from the finite al-
phabet Z = {A, C, G, T}. We say that or is a factor of x if x can be ex—
pressed as x : new, with 141/ denoting the concatenation between
sequences a and 12.

We denote by Wk the set of all k—size words (or factors) of x.

 

Also, we represent the set of all k—size words not in x as Wk(x). For
each word size 13, we define the set of all words that exist in x but do
not exist in y by

194953): WW0 0 WW”) (1)

and the subset of words that are minimal, in the sense presented in
Pinho et al. (2009), as

Mk(x,y) : {or E Rk(x,y) : Wk_1(oc) ﬂ Mk_1(x,y) : ¢} (2)

i.e. a minimal absent word of size 13 cannot contain any minimal ab-
sent word of size less than k. In particular, [err is a minimal absent
word of sequence x, where l and r are single letters from 2, if [err is
not a word of x but both la and ocr are (Pinho et al., 2009). In this
work, we were particularly interested in the non—empty set M k (x, y)
corresponding to the smallest 13. These are referred as RAWs.

2.2 Protein structural models

Protein 3D structural models were built by homology modeling as
previously described (Duarte—Pereira et al., 2014). Appropriate tem—
plates were selected from PDB (www.rcsb.org; Berman et al., 2000),
where several nucleoprotein (NP) structures from viruses within
Mononegaz/irales (negative—sense genome single—stranded RNA
viruses) are available, whereas for the region of interest in L-protein
only structures from more distant viruses exist.

Structures from the Nipah virus NP (PDB ID:4CO6; Yabukarski
et al., 2014) and the BVDV (bovine viral diarrhea virus) RNA poly-
merase (PDB ID:1S48; Choi et al., 2004) were used as templates in
MODELLER (Eswar et al., 2006; Sali and Blundell, 1993), to pre—
dict the structure of the N—terminal regions of Ebola virus NP (resi-
dues 1—380) and RNA—polymerase (residues 177—805), respectively
(Supplementary Figs. S3 and S4). Accuracy of the predicted models
(Supplementary Fig. S5) was estimated using ProSA—web (https://
prosa.services.came.sbg.ac.at/prosa.php; Sippl, 1993; Wiederstein
and Sippl, 2007) and structures were visualized with PyMOL
(Schrodinger, 2010).

3 Results

To identify RAWs, we have developed the EAGLE tool that imple—
ments the method described above (Supplementary Data). We have
used the full GRC—38 human reference genome (Church et al., 2011)

downloaded from the NCBI, including the mitochondrial, unplaced
and unlocalized sequences. The sequences of 99 EBOV genomes
from the current outbreak in Sierra Leone (Gire et al., 2014) and
additional 66 Ebolaz/irus genomes have been also downloaded from
NCBI (Supplementary Table S1). The code used in this analysis is
available (Pratas, 2015).

Figure 1 shows the computation for word sizes 12, 13 and 14 (for
computer characteristics see Supplementary Section Software and
Hardware). As expected, the number of absent words decreases as the
k—mer size decreases. Specifically, for k = 11 (not represented), there
are no EBOV RAW. On the other hand, for k = 12, three groups of
points emerge (RAW1, RAW2 and RAW3) representing the position
of a RAW in each of the 99 unaligned viral genomes (Fig. 1a).

Alignments of 124 Ebolaz/irus sequences (Gire et al., 2014),
including additional EBOV genomes from the current outbreak in
Guinea (Baize et al., 2014) and from previous outbreaks, show that
the identified minimal RAWs fall into conserved protein regions
(Fig. 1b). However, several mutations can be found in the genomes
that discriminate between the different species of Ebolaz/irus and
even between EBOV sequences from the current and previous out—
breaks (Fig. 1c). The identification of these viral genome signatures
is important for quick diagnosis in outbreak scenarios. Additional
analysis with all 165 Ebolaz/irus genomes confirmed these results
(Supplementary Fig. S1). In particular, RAW1 is conserved within
EBOV and can distinguish EBOV from other Ebolaz/irus species.
RAW2 is conserved in all sequences from the West African 2014
outbreak in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, and only one nucleo—
tide difference exists between these sequences and unrelated out—
break genomes. RAW3 is also conserved at the species level,
excluding the four EBOV 1976/77 genomes, and can distinguish be—
tween all Ebolaz/irus species (Supplementary Fig. S2).

From the three EBOV sequence motifs absent in the human gen—
ome, the first (RAW1) is included in the virus NP, while the other
two (RAW2 and RAW3) fall within the sequence of the viral RNA-
polymerase (L—protein; Fig. 1c). Previous studies show that the N—
terminal region of EBOV NP participates in both the formation of
nucleocapsid—like structures through NP—NP interactions and in the
replication of the viral genome (Watanabe et al., 2006), and RAW1
sequence (TTTCGCCCGACT) is part of this N-terminal region.
The L-protein (LP) produces the viral transcripts to be translated by
host ribosomes and is involved in the replication of the viral genome
as well. The LP contains the two additional minimal RAWs, RAW2
(TACGCCCTATCG) and RAW3 (CCTACGCGCAAA).

Both NP and LP are critical for the virus life cycle and constitute
good targets for therapeutic intervention. Screening for new anti-
viral compounds could benefit from knowledge of their protein
structures. For EBOV, most protein structures are unknown except
for the C-terminal domain of NP, GP, VP24 and VP35 (Shurtleff
et al., 2012), thus, we have predicted the structure of the N—terminal
regions of the EBOV NP and LP by homology modeling
(Supplementary Figs. 83—85). These structural models show that the
amino acids corresponding to the RAW1 motif are enclosed within
the structure, while RAW2 and RAW3 are exposed at the protein
surface, which can justify its higher degree of conservation.

4 Discussion

The personalized medicine field is now closer to clinical practice with
the advances of next—generation sequencing technologies. Personalized
therapeutics are a possibility and their development is essential with
the emergence of resistance to current available drugs. Additionally,
quick diagnosis is required for emerging pathogens and in epidemics

Fig. 1. Ebola virus minimal absent words relatively to the human complete genome. (a) RAWs were identified in 99 unaligned genomes from the current outbreak

in Sierra Leone (2014) and are highlighted in red (k=12, arrows), blue (k: 13)

and grey (k: 14). (b) Whole genome alignments from 124 published Ebolavirus

genomes were obtained from Gire et al. (2014) and visualized in Geneious (created by Biomatters, available from http://www.geneious.com). Sequence logos

and identity define conserved regions. (c) Regions corresponding to the ident
alignments. The Ebolavirus reference genomes are displayed, as well as selecte

such as the current Ebola outbreak. Here, we have detected minimal
RAWs in the human genome that are present in EBOV genomes, and
identified nucleotide differences in some of these sequences that can
distinguish between Ebolavirus species and outbreaks. Also, we show
that the corresponding amino acid sequences are conserved within
EBOV. These results can now be further explored for diagnosis and
therapeutics, sometimes mentioned as theranostics (Picard and
Bergeron, 2002). Namely, RAW nucleotide sequences can be used in
diagnosis to design primers that identify Ebolavirus infections or

ified RAWs are shown in genome location and both as nucleic acid and protein
d representative sequences where nucleotide differences are observed

distinguish between Ebolavirus species. For PCR—based methods, lon—
ger sequences and multiplex reactions can be developed to avoid pri—
mer binding bias. Additional nucleotide or protein—based strategies for
therapeutics can be envisaged, as discussed below.

One problem in developing efficient EBOV treatments is the
virus ability to evade the immune system. The viral GP is a major
target because it mediates attachment and entry into the host cells.
However, in addition to the surface envelope protein, the GP gene
also produces fragment, soluble GPs that are secreted and direct the

immune system to produce antibodies for variable and non—essential
regions of the virus (Cook and Lee, 2013; Mohan et al., 2012). As
current efforts based on the viral GP might prove ineffective, add—
itional targets should be sought. Our results show that the viral NP
and polymerase (LP) can be attractive targets. As the amino acid se—
quences of all three 12—mer RAWs are conserved within EBOV,
these regions can be used to screen for small molecule inhibitors. In
particular, RAW1 is conserved in all Ebolavirus NP proteins, which
can indicate a functional or structural role. And, considering that
the protein model predicts that RAW2 and RAW3 are relatively
close in the 3D structure and in exposed domains, these regions
can be used to develop novel antibodies. Also, a recently described
mechanism shows that the polymerase (LP) from Ebola and
Marburg viruses is capable of editing transcripts, resulting in
increased variability in the produced proteins, and that the most
edited mRNAs are the Ebola GP and Marburg NP and LP itself
(Shabman et al., 2014). Thus, the use of combined therapies towards
multiple proteins can be more effective, as suggested by studies to
develop vaccines for Lassa virus that target both NP and GP (Fisher-
Hoch et al., 2000; Lukashevich, 2012).

RNA—based strategies such as RNA interference (RNAi) or
antissense therapies are also promising approaches to silence target—
specific gene expression. The RAW sequences that we have identified
can be used to develop RNAi or antisense probes that bind viral tran-
scripts and prevent their translation, thus, inhibiting viral replication
without blocking the host mRNAs. Translation of these technologies
into clinical applications have been slowed by challenges in the deliv—
ery of small RNAs into cells, but recent developments in delivery sys—
tems are bridging the bench to bedside gap (Hayden, 2014; Yin et al.,
2014). Among these, gold or lipid nanoparticles (Conde et al., 2014;
Draz et al., 2014) were shown to be effective against cancer and viral
infections, including EBOV (Geisbert et al., 2010). Gold—nanobeacons
can be applied as a combined diagnosis and therapy tool for effective
testing, including in low—cost settings (Costa et al., 2014) and, with
this purpose, advances in peptide nucleic acid probes for viral detec—
tion are also taking place (Joshi et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2010).

Whichever the technology, the identification of genome signa-
tures for rapid evolving species such as Ebola viruses will be useful
for the development of both diagnosis and therapeutics.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Protein function prediction (PFP) is an automated function
prediction method that predicts Gene Ontology (GO) annotations for
a protein sequence using distantly related sequences and contextual
associations of GO terms. Extended similarity group (ESG) is another
GO prediction algorithm that makes predictions based on iterative
sequence database searches. Here, we provide interactive
web servers for the PFP and ESG algorithms that are equipped with
an effective visualization of the GO predictions in a hierarchical
topology.

Availability: PFP/ESG servers are freely available at http://kiharalab.
org/web/pfp.php and http://kiharalab.org/web/esg.php, or access
both at http://kiharalab.org/pfp_esg.php

1 INTRODUCTION

The rapid growth of genomics and proteomics technologies has
posed a major challenge of large-scale automatic annotations of
newly sequenced data that awaits functional interpretation.
Advanced algorithms can often provide more accurate annota-
tions with a larger coverage than conventional function predic-
tion methods that use homology as the source of information.
Here we developed web servers for our two sequence-based func-
tion prediction algorithms, protein function prediction (PFP)
and extended similarity group (ESG).

PFP extends traditional PSI-BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997)
search by extracting and scoring Gene Ontology (GO) annota-
tions from distantly similar sequences and by applying context-
ual associations of GO terms observed in the annotation
database to the scoring scheme (Hawkins et al., 2006, 2009).
PFP was ranked the best in the function prediction category in
the Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure
Prediction (Lopez et al., 2007).

ESG performs an iterative sequence database search and
assigns a probability score to GO terms based on its relative
similarity scores to the multiple-level neighbors in a protein

similarity graph (Chitale et al., 2009). ESG was shown to out-
perform conventional methods in a thorough benchmark study.
In the large-scale community-based critical assessment of protein
function annotation experiment, ESG was ranked fourth in
predicting Molecular Function GO terms among 54 participating
groups (Radivojac et al., 2013). Thus, both PFP and ESG have
been rigorously benchmarked both in the original papers and in
objective assessments by the community. Predictive performance
of the two methods is discussed in Supplementary Data.

2 METHODS

2.1 PFP algorithm

The PFP algorithm uses PSI-BLAST to obtain sequences hits for a target
sequence and predicts GO terms. PFP computes the score for GO term fa,
s(f,,), as follows:

Nfunc(i)

N
saw: 2 ((—10g(E— value(i))+b)P<ram-))

i=1 j=1

where N is the number of sequence hits considered in the PSI-BLAST
hits, Nfunc( i ) is the number of GO annotations for the sequence hit
1', E_value( i ) is the PSI-BLAST E-Value for the sequence hit 1',  is
the j-th annotation of the sequence hit 1', and constant b takes value 2
(= log10100). The conditional probabilities P0211?) consider co-
occurrence of GO terms observed in sequence annotations. To take
into account the hierarchical structure of the GO, PFP transfers the
raw score to parental terms by computing the proportion of proteins
annotated with fa relative to all proteins that belong to the parental
GO term in the database.

2.2 ESG algorithm

The ESG algorithm recursively performs PSI-BLAST searches using se-
quences that are retrieved by the initial search from the query sequence.
Each sequence hit in a search is assigned a weight that is computed as the
proportion of the -log(E_value) of the sequence relative to the sum of the
weights from all the sequence hits of the same search round. This weight
is assigned to GO terms annotating the sequence hit. Weights for GO
terms found in the second iteration search are computed in the same
fashion. Finally, the score for a GO term is computed as the sum of
weights from the two levels of searches.

PFP and ESG have different characteristics: PFP is designed to have a
larger coverage by retrieving annotations widely from even weakly similar
sequences, while ESG is for better speciﬁcity by taking consistently
predicted GO terms in an iterative search. This is further discussed in
Supplementary Data.

2.3 Input

Input of PFP and ESG is one or more query protein sequences in the
FASTA format. Users can submit sequences separated by line breaks or
upload a ﬁle containing sequences.

2.4 Output

Both PFP and ESG algorithms predict GO terms for a given protein
sequence. ESG outputs a score that ranges from [0,1]. Predicted GO
terms are listed on the result page (Fig. 1). Predictions are classiﬁed
into four conﬁdence levels: very high, high, moderate and the rest. In
addition, an XML ﬁle is provided that summarizes the prediction.
Moreover, predicted GO terms are visualized as discussed below.
Submitted jobs are tracked and kept in a MySQL database so that the
user can retrieve the results later. Average computational time for PFP
and ESG is 40.1 s and 7.5 min, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S1).

2.4.1 Tracing origin of predicted G0 terms The servers provide
sequence IDs indicating the source of each predicted GO term. Since
PFP and ESG often retrieve GO annotations from distantly related
sequences that are not obvious homologs to the query, the tracing func-
tion will clarify how predictions are computed and can provide insights
into the function of the query protein. For each predicted GO term,
clicking a [+] sign will open a list of sequence IDs that contributed
scores to the GO term. The contribution of each sequence is shown as
the percentage of the score that originates from the sequence.

2.4.2 GO term visualization The GO term Visualizer intuitively
shows predicted GO terms in the GO hierarchy (Fig. 2). A visualized
GO graph can be zoomed in and out or further expanded to see sub-
nodes of a branch. GO terms are colored based on their assigned prob-
ability. GO terms can be also colored based on the number of child nodes
under them that are directly predicted. In addition, visualization in
Cytoscape allows three modes of GO hierarchy visualization (tree, radial

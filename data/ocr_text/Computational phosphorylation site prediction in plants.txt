ABSTRACT

Motivation: Phosphorylation is the most important post-translational
modification in eukaryotes. Although many computational phosphor-
ylation site prediction tools exist for mammals, and a few were created
specifically for Arabidopsis thaliana, none are currently available for
other plants.

Results: In this article, we propose a novel random forest-based
method called PHOSFER (PHOsphoryIation Site FindER) for applying
phosphorylation data from other organisms to enhance the accuracy
of predictions in a target organism. As a test case, PHOSFER is
applied to phosphorylation sites in soybean, and we show that it
more accurately predicts soybean sites than both the existing
Arabidopsis-specific predictors, and a simpler machine-learning
scheme that uses only known phosphorylation sites and
non-phosphorylation sites from soybean. In addition to soybean,
PHOSFER will be extended to other organisms in the near future.
Availability: PHOSFER is available via a web interface at

1 INTRODUCTION

Kinase—mediated protein phosphorylation is a critical mechanism
for the regulation of virtually all cellular processes in eukaryotes
(Bu et al., 2010; Kim and Lee, 2011; Lian et al., 2010;
Ressurreicao et al., 2011; Uddin et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2010;
Wood et al., 2009; Zhang and Johnson, 2000). To fully
understand signaling mechanisms in an organism of interest, it
is necessary to identify both its protein kinases and the sites that
those kinases phosphorylate. Although the protein kinase com-
plement of many organisms is known (Manning et al., 2002),
many phosphorylation sites have yet to be identiﬁed, particularly
in less well-studied organisms.

Although mass spectrometry enables phosphorylation sites to
be detected in a high-throughput manner, most laboratories do
not have access to the instruments and expertise required to use
this technique. As a result, computational methods for predicting
phosphorylation sites have become increasingly popular. Dozens
of predictors are now available; to review these, see Xue et al.
(2010) and Trost and Kusalik (2011).

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed

Most current predictors focus on human phosphorylation
sites. However, the protein kinase complements in various or-
ganisms differ signiﬁcantly both in quantity and in kind (Diks
et al., 2007); for example, the plant Arabidopsis thaliana encodes
twice as many protein kinases as does human (Champion et al.,
2004), but it seems to lack any that are similar to classical human
tyrosine kinases. This makes most current predictors suboptimal
for predicting phosphorylation sites in non-human organisms.
Although three tools—PhosPhAt (Durek et al., 2010;
Heazlewood et al., 2008), PlantPhos (Lee et al., 2011) and an
unnamed tool developed by Gao et al. (2009a)—are speciﬁc to
Arabidopsis, predictors are lacking for other plants.

This article describes PHOSFER (PHOsphorylation Site
FindER), a phosphorylation site prediction tool for plants, par-
ticularly those for which little phosphorylation site data are
available. As a test case, we use soybean (Glycine max), an eco-
nomically important crop in many areas of the world. We use a
novel strategy for using phosphorylation site data from other
organisms to boost predictive performance. Speciﬁcally, Basic
Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) searches are used to de-
termine the degree of conservation between phosphorylation
sites in soybean and those in several other organisms for which
known phosphorylation sites are available. A machine-learning
scheme is used in which a speciﬁc training instance from organ-
ism X is given a weight proportional to the level of phosphoryl-
ation site conservation between soybean and X, with greater
weights implying more inﬂuence on the learning process. We
show that the resultant predictors outperform the aforemen-
tioned Arabidopsis-speciﬁc tools when applied to soybean, and
they also outperform a simpler machine-learning technique that
uses only known phosphorylation sites from soybean. In the near
future, PHOSFER will be extended to predict phosphorylation
sites in other organisms.

2 METHODS
2.1 Data

2.1.] Pmteomes The human (Homo sapiens), mouse (Mus musculus),
cow (Bos taurus), Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster
proteomes were obtained from UniProt (preiler et al., 2004; UniProt
Consortium, 2008, 2012). The Arabidopsis proteome was downloaded
from The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) (Swarbreck et al.,
2008), whereas the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) proteome was down-
loaded from the Saccharomyces Genome Database (Cherry et al., 1998;
Engel et al., 2010). Finally, the proteomes for rice (Oryza saliva)
and soybean were retrieved from the Phytozome project (Goodstein
et al., 2012).

Computational phosphorylation site prediction in plants

 

2.1.2 Positive phosphorylation Site data Phosphorylation sites that
have been experimentally characterized using mass spectrometry or
low-throughput biological techniques were gathered from online data-
bases for each of the nine organisms aforementioned. Known sites
from C.elegans were gathered from Phospho.ELM (Diella et al., 2004,
2008; Dinkel et al., 2011). Both Phospho.ELM and PhosphoSitePlus
(Hornbeck et al., 2004, 2012) contained sites from human, mouse, cow
and Drosophila. Known sites from rice, soybean and Arabidopsis were
downloaded from P3DB (Gao et al., 2009b). Finally, sites from
S.cerevisiae were obtained from PhosphoGRID (Stark et al., 2010).
Although disagreement exists over the optimal peptide length for
representing phosphorylation sites in a machine-learning model (Trost
and Kusalik, 2011), a few studies have proposed lengths between 9 and
15 (Biswas et al., 2010; Blom et al., 1999; Miller et al., 2008). In this study,
phosphorylation sites were represented as peptides of length 15, with the
phosphorylated residue in the center and seven amino acids on either side.
When a particular phosphorylated residue was too close to the beginning
or end of the protein to have seven residues on either side, the missing
residues were represented by gap (—) characters. The handling of gaps
with respect to the machine-learning features is described in Section 2.2.3.
Peptides containing one or more ambiguous amino acids were removed.

2.1.3 Negative phosphorylation Site data Negative phosphorylation
sites (15mer peptides with S, T or Y central residues that are assumed not
to be phosphorylated) for all organisms described earlier were gathered
from their respective proteomes as follows. A given S/T/Y residue had to
meet three criteria to be selected as a negative site. First, a potential
negative site could not have been reported as a positive site. Second, as
suggested by Neuberger et al. (2007), it had to be within a protein that
contained known positive sites. The rationale for this criterion is that as
proteins with several known phosphorylation sites have been well studied
with respect to phosphorylation, sites in these proteins that are not
known to be phosphorylated are more likely to be true negative sites.
In this study, a potential negative site had to be in a protein containing at
least three positive sites. Third, as suggested by Blom et al. (2004), a
negative phosphorylation site had to be predicted as solvent-inaccessible;
the rationale here is that residues buried in the core of a protein would
not be accessible to any kinase. To predict solvent accessibility, the
NetSurfP program (Petersen et al., 2009) was used. If a given S/T/Y
residue was predicted as buried by NetSurfP, it was deemed to be a
potential negative phosphorylation site.

2.1.4 Redundant sequence removal To remove redundant sites, all
positive and negative sites from all nine organisms were combined into
one dataset, which was then clustered using CD-HIT (Li and Godzik,
2006) at a sequence identity threshold of 65%. These clusters were pro-
cessed using the following rules.

(1) If a cluster contained exactly one site, that site was retained.

(2) If a cluster contained multiple positive (or negative) sites from a
single organism, then a single site was arbitrarily chosen to retain.

(3) Some clusters contained positive (or negative) sites from two or
more organisms. To avoid redundancy, all but one of these sites
were discarded. To choose the site to retain, the organism repre-
sented in the cluster with the highest level of phosphorylation site
conservation with soybean (i.e. the highest value of CBk; see
Section 2.2.2 for details) was determined. If there was only one
site from that organism, that site was retained; otherwise, one of
the sites was arbitrarily selected. Given this rule, a site from soy-
bean was always selected if soybean was represented in the cluster.

(4) Because positive and negative data from different organisms were
combined, a single cluster could contain both a positive site (from
one organism) and a negative site (from a different organism). If a
cluster contained at least one positive site and at least one negative

site, then that sequence was considered to be a positive site (as the
‘negative sites’ in the other organisms are likely to be undiscovered
positive sites). If the site was known to be positive in more than one
organism, then the organism was selected according to the afore-
mentioned rule 3.

2.1.5 Dataset imbalance correction In machine-learning problems,
imbalanced datasets occur when one class has a signiﬁcantly different
number of instances than another class and can signiﬁcantly affect the
accuracy of some learning methods (Japkowicz and Stephen, 2002). In
the context of phosphorylation site prediction, positive phosphorylation
sites are vastly outnumbered by negative sites (Tang et al., 2007).
To correct this imbalance, for each organism and for each site type
(S, T or )0, the number of positive sites was determined, and an equal
number of negative sites were randomly chosen from the list generated as
described earlier. For example, if 123 positive sites were available for T
sites in Drosophila, then 123 corresponding negative T sites were chosen.

2.2 Building the classiﬁer

2.2.1 Random forests The random forest machine-learning technique
(Breiman, 2001) was used as implemented in the data mining and
machine-learning package Weka (Frank et al., 2004; Witten et al.,
2011). This method involves building many decision trees, each of
which is built using a number of randomly selected features. The more
trees that predict that a given peptide contains a phosphorylation site, the
more likely it is that this is indeed the case. Each model built for this study
used 300 random trees; each built using 10 randomly selected features.
Separate models were created for S, T and Y phosphorylation sites.

2.2.2 Organism-speciﬁc instance weights In this study, known
phosphorylation sites both from soybean and from other organisms
were used as training data. Each training instance with phosphorylated
residue k (k e {S, T, Y}) from organism B was assigned a weight based on
(i) the degree of phosphorylation site conservation (speciﬁcally, conser-
vation of 15mer peptides having phosphorylated residues in the center)
between soybean and B and (ii) the number of instances of type k in
organism B. Training instances from organisms whose phosphorylation
sites were better conserved in soybean were given higher weights.
Conversely, the more training instances of type k that were available
for a given organism, the lower the weight given to each instance. The
greater the weight assigned to a particular training instance, the more
inﬂuence it had on the resultant model.

Formally, let T Bk represent the set of positive training instances from
organism B with phosphorylated residue k. The elements of a given set
T Bk, as well as the negative training instances for the same B and k, were
each given an identical weight WBk according to the formula
W3;C = 100 X CBk/ITBkl. The term CBk, which represents the degree of
phosphorylation site conservation between organism B and soybean, is
described in more detail later in the text. A scaling factor of 100 was
applied to make the resulting numbers less unwieldy.

Each CBk was calculated as follows. Let A denote the soybean prote-
ome, and let (A —> B)k represent the comparison in which all of the
known phosphorylation sites from A (i.e. 15mer peptides with the phos-
phorylated residue in the center) of type k were used as BLAST queries
against proteome B (which could be any of the proteomes described in
Section 2.1.1, including soybean itself). This was done using all the posi-
tive phosphorylation sites for a given organism, not just the ones selected
at the end of the ﬁltering process described in Section 2.1.4. Note that for
phosphorylated residues occurring within seven residues of the C- or
N—terminus of a protein, the BLAST query was <15 residues, with the
phosphorylated residue no longer in the middle. Speciﬁcally, let X be a
known phosphorylation site from A, and let Y be its best BLAST match
in B. Also, let X’ and Y’ denote the full-length proteins corresponding to

X and Y, respectively. X was deemed to be in the ‘not conserved’ category
with respect to B if either X and Y, or A” and Y’, were not conserved. X
and Y were considered non-conserved if the E—value corresponding to Y
was >100 when X was used as a BLAST query against B, or if the number
of sequence differences between them was 27. A” and Y’ were considered
non-conserved if the E-value corresponding to Y’ was >10_3 when A” was
used a BLAST query against B. If X was not in the ‘not conserved’
category according to the aforementioned criteria, then it was placed in
the ‘conserved’ category. An analogous process was also done for the
comparison (B —> A)k (i.e. in which proteins from some proteome B were
used as query sequences, and the soybean proteome was used as the
database).

Let Hgk denote the percentage of known phosphorylation sites in the
‘conserved’ category for the comparison (A —> B)k, and let Hik denote
the same for (B —> A)k. Then CBk = (Hive +H%k)/2. For example, if
70% of sites were in the ‘conserved’ category for (A —> B)k and 80%
were in the ‘conserved’ category for (B —> A)k, then
CB;C = (70 + 80)/2 = 75. By deﬁnition, if B is soybean, then CB;C = 100
for each k.

As an illustration of the entire step, suppose that 465 known threonine
phosphorylation sites remained from rice after ﬁltering (|TBk| = 465,
where B is rice and k is T). Further, suppose that (before ﬁltering)
27.7% of soybean T sites had conserved sites in the rice proteome, and
28.4% of rice T sites had conserved sites in the soybean proteome. Then
C Bk 2 (27.7 + 28.4) / 2 = 28.1. The weight given to each training instance
from rice (both positive and negative) would then be
W3;C = 100 x CBk/ITBkl = 100 x 281/465 2 6.04.

2.2.3 Features AAIndex (Kawashima et al., 2008; Nakai et al., 1988)
is a database of 544 (as of release 9.1) amino acid properties gathered
from the literature. Although useful for many bioinforrnatics tasks
(Kawashima et al., 2008), the sheer number of these properties could
potentially cause both computational tractability and overﬁtting prob-
lems when used as features in a classiﬁcation problem. Given that many
of these properties are strongly correlated with one another, clustering
them can produce a set that is substantially smaller than the full set, but
nonetheless, it retains much of its information. Although this has been
done by the authors of AAIndex itself using hierarchical clustering
(Kawashima et al., 2008; Tomii and Kanehisa, 1996), a more sophisti-
cated method called consensus fuzzy clustering was recently developed by
Saha et al. (2011). After deriving eight clusters using their technique, these
authors identiﬁed a set of 24 ‘high-quality indices’ consisting of three
individual AAIndex indices from each cluster: the index at the center of
the cluster (the medoid) and the two indices farthest from the medoid.
The eight clusters roughly represent electric properties, hydrophobicity,
alpha and turn propensities, physicochemical properties, residue propen-
sity, composition, beta propensity and intrinsic propensities. A more de-
tailed descriptions of each of these clusters can be found in the original
article (Saha et al., 2011); however, to give the reader a sense of these
real-valued indices and how they relate (or do not relate) to an intuitive
idea of the properties of each amino acid, Table 1 contains these values
for 3 of the 24 high-quality indices. Except for the invariant middle resi-
due, the 24 features were considered for each of the residues in a given
15-residue-long phosphorylation site, for 24 X 14 = 336 features. As
described earlier in the text, missing residues (because of the phosphory-
lated residue being too close to the N— or C-terminus of the protein) were
represented by gap characters (—) in the 15mer representation of phos-
phorylation sites. To make it as neutral as possible, for each index, the
gap character was assigned a value equal to the average value for the 20
amino acids.

prediction—PhosPhAt (Durek et al., 2010; Heazlewood et al., 2008),
PlantPhos (Lee et al., 2011) and a method by Gao et al. (2009b).
Unfortunately, no implementation is available for the latter technique;
therefore, only PhosPhAt and PlantPhos were compared with
PHOSFER. Although PhosPhAt and PlantPhos were trained only
using data from Arabidopsis (and none from soybean), they are nonethe-
less the two most comparable tools with PHOSFER, with other phos-
phorylation site tools having been trained on mammalian data (Trost and
Kusalik, 2011) (as these tools are not open-source, it was not possible to
retrain them using soybean data). As PhosPhAt uses 13mers rather than
15mers (as PHOSFER does), the ﬁrst and last residues were removed
from each peptide before being input to PhosPhAt. PlantPhos uses
21mers; therefore, the 21mer corresponding to each 15mer site (three
additional residues on either side) was used. Phosphorylated residues
located too close to the beginning or end of the corresponding full protein
sequence to make a full 13mer or 21mer could not be tested with
PhosPhAt or PlantPhos, respectively. Also, PlantPhos did not return
scores for a small portion of the sequences given as input; hence, these
sites were considered to have been given a score lower than the minimum
of the reported scores.

The performance of PHOSFER was also compared with those of sev-
eral variants, which we have called PHOSFER-NC, PHOSFER-EW,
PHOSFER-SO, PHOSFER-A0 and PHOSFER-A025. Each was iden-
tical to PHOSFER except for the following differences. PHOSFER-NC
(‘no conservation’) used the weights WBk = 100/ | T Bkl—ie. each training
instance was weighted only according to the number of training instances
for that organism and not also according to the phosphorylation site
conservation between that organism and soybean. PHOSFER-EW
(‘equal weights’) used equal weights for all training instances, regardless

of the source organism. PHOSFER-SO (‘soybean only’) was trained
exclusively using soybean data; thus, it did not involve the use of instance
weights. PHOSFER-A0 (‘Arabidopsis only’) was trained exclusively
using Arabidopsis data; thus, it also did not involve instance weights.
Finally, PHOSFER-A025 (‘Arabidopsis only 25%’) was the same as
PHOSFER-A0, except it used only 25% of the Arabidopsis data for
training.

Evaluating the performance of these variants allows us to assess the
contribution of various aspects of PHOSFER, including the machine-
learning model (random forests using AAIndex-derived features), the
use of data from other species, the use of instance weights and the use
of species-speciﬁc instance weights. Speciﬁcally, comparing PHOSFER-
A0 with PhosPhAt and PlantPhos allowed us to compare the
machine-learning model used here with those used by PhosPhAt and
PlantPhos. As there are more Arabidopsis data currently available than
there were at the time PhosPhAt and PlantPhos were developed, we also
tested PHOSFER-A025, which used fewer Arabidopsis training instances
than PlantPhos for each type of phosphorylation site (Lee et al., 2011) [it
is not clear how many sites were used in training the PhosPhAt predictor
(Durek et al., 2010; Heazlewood et al., 2008)]. This allowed the impact of
the machine-learning models used to be separated from the impact of a
larger training set.

Comparing PHOSFER-SO with PHOSFER-A0 allowed us to com-
pare the use of soybean-speciﬁc data with the use of Arabidopsis-speciﬁc
data in predicting soybean phosphorylation sites. Comparing PHOSFER-
EW with PHOSFER-SO allowed us to evaluate the impact of using, in
addition to soybean data, data from organisms other than soybean.
Comparing PHOSFER-NC with PHOSFER-EW allowed us to evaluate
the impact of weighting the training instances based on the number of
instances from each organism. Finally, comparing PHOSFER with
PHOSFER-NC allowed us to determine whether there is value in also
weighting the training instances based on the degree of phosphorylation
site conservation between soybean and the source organism.

2.3.2 Training and testing Because PhosPhAt, PlantPhos,
PHOSFER-A0 and PHOSFER-A025 were trained only using data
from Arabidopsis, they were tested directly on the known soybean data,
with no cross-validation needed. PHOSFER-SO was tested using 10-fold
cross-validation, with each fold using 90% of the soybean data for train-
ing and the remaining 10% for testing. PHOSFER, PHOSFER-NC and
PHOSFER-EW were evaluated in the same way, except all of the

phosphorylation sites from the non-soybean organisms were used as
training instances in each fold in addition to 90% of the soybean data.
For completeness, in addition to 10-fold cross-validation, all performance
evaluations were also done using leave-one-out cross-validation.

2.3.3 Evaluation criteria For each tool, receiver operating character-
istic (ROC) curves were plotted, wherein the y-axis represents sensitivity,
the x-axis represents 1 — speciﬁcity and each point represents the sensi-
tivity and speciﬁcity of a given tool at a given scoring threshold. The score
is the proportion of the 300 decision trees that classify a given residue as a
phosphorylation site. Sensitivity was deﬁned as TP/(TP + FN), where TP
stands for true-positive sites and FN for false-negative sites. Speciﬁcity
was deﬁned as TN/(TN + FP), where TN is true-negative sites, and FP is
false-positive sites. Each tool was evaluated based on the area under its
ROC curve (AROC), where a value of 0.5 represents classiﬁcation accur-
acy that is only as good as random guessing, and a value of 1 represents
perfect discrimination. The ROCR package (Sing et al., 2005) for the R
programming language was used to facilitate the ROC analysis.

Although an AROC value represents overall classiﬁcation accuracy, a
classiﬁer with a higher AROC value than another does not necessarily
make it more useful. In some applications, it is important to have good
sensitivity at very high speciﬁcity. For example, suppose that a user
wanted to scan an entire proteome for phosphorylation sites. Because
there are so many potential sites, speciﬁcity must be very high to avoid
getting large numbers of false-positive sites. Thus, the best tool for this
situation would be the one having the highest sensitivity at very high
speciﬁcity (say, 0.99). Another application might favor good sensitivity
at somewhat lower speciﬁcity—for instance, speciﬁcities of 0.95 or 0.90
might be appropriate when scanning a limited number of proteins of
interest. Given this, the tools were also evaluated according to their
sensitivities at the practically useful speciﬁcity values of 0.99, 0.95 and
0.90. The Matthews Correlation Coefﬁcient (MCC) was also calculated
for each of those speciﬁcity values.

aCow had only 92 negative S sites remaining after the ﬁltering procedures described in Sections 2.1.3 and 2.1.4; hence, in this case, the number of negative sites was less than the

number of positive sites.

number of positive S, T or Y sites from each organism
(the quantities ITBkl described earlier) following the removal of
redundant sequences. The number of negative sites used for a
given organism was made to be the same as the number of posi-
tive sites for that organism; however, because of the ﬁltering
steps performed in Sections 2.1.3 and 2.1.4, cow had too few
negative S sites remaining to match the number of positive
sites; in this case, all possible negative sites were used. Table 2
also shows the level of phosphorylation site conservation
between each organism and soybean; these numbers were used
to calculate the values C Bk. Finally, Table 2 contains the instance
weight W3;C for each combination of B and k.

3.2 Performance of PHOSFER, the PHOSFER variants,
PhosPhAt and PlantPhos

As mentioned earlier, the performance of the primary classiﬁer
(PHOSFER) was tested, along with those of a number of vari-
ants: PHOSFER—NC (trained using instance weights that take
into account only the number of training instances from a given
organism, and not phosphorylation site conservation with soy-
bean), PHOSFER—EW (trained using equal instance weights for
all organisms), PHOSFER-SO (trained using only soybean phos-
phorylation sites), PHOSFER-A0 (trained using only
Arabidopsis sites) and PHOSFER-A025 (trained using only
25% of the available Arabidopsis sites). Figure 1 contains ROC
curves illustrating the performance of PhosPhAt and PlantPhos,
both of which were trained only using data from Arabidopsis,
and compares them to PHOSFER-A0 and PHOSFER-A025.
Figure 2 contains ROC curves for the ﬁrst four PHOSFER vari-
ants as aforementioned. These data were a result of using 10-fold
cross-validation; results using leave-one—out cross-validation can
be found in the Supplementary Materials. In addition, Table 3
contains the AROC value for each tool and each site type, as well
as sensitivity at various practically useful speciﬁcity values.

In Section 2.3.1, the purpose of including each of the
PHOSFER variants was explained. The results given in
Figure 1, Figure 2 and Table 3 allow the comparisons mentioned
in that section to be made.

Figure l and Table 3 show that, for all site types, both
PHOSFER-A0 and PHOSFER-A025 outperformed
PhosPhAt and PlantPhos. All four of these tools were trained
using data from Arabidopsis and then tested on soybean data,
and although PHOSFER-A0 had the advantage of a greater
amount of training data than PlantPhos (as mentioned earlier
in the text, it is unclear how many training instances were used
for PhosPhAt), PHOSFER-A025 had fewer training instances
than PlantPhos for all three site types. This implies that the
model used here, which uses random forests and
AAIndex-derived features, compares favorably with the models
used by PlantPhos (and probably PhosPhAt).

As expected, Figure 2 and Table 3 show that PHOSFER-SO
had the lowest performance among the variants of PHOSFER
that used soybean data for training. This was the case for all
three types of phosphorylation sites. PHOSFER-EW, which
was trained using equally weighted data from soybean and
other organisms, exhibited comparable performance with
PHOSFER-SO for S sites, but it greatly improved performance
for T and Y sites, for which less data were available from

soybean. PHOSFER-NC and PHOSFER had comparable
AROC values with PHOSFER-EW for S and T sites and im-
proved AROC values for Y sites. Finally, PHOSFER and
PHOSFER-NC had comparable AROC values, but PHOSFER
generally had slightly to moderately better sensitivity at high
speciﬁcity than PHOSFER-NC.

Perhaps the most surprising observation from Table 3 is that
the performance of PHOSFER-A0 rivaled (and sometimes bet-
tered) that of PHOSFER, both in terms of AROC values and in
terms of sensitivity at high speciﬁcities. This observation is dis-
cussed further in Sections 4.3 and 4.4.

3.3 The relationship between improvements in
performance and the amount of available data

Given the previous observations, it seems that using data from
other species provide substantial beneﬁt when few known phos-
phorylation sites from the organism of interest are available
(T and Y sites in this case), but a more modest beneﬁt
when many sites are available (S sites). To more explicitly exam-
ine this phenomenon, three subvariants of PHOSFER
(PHOSFER75, PHOSFER50 and PHOSFER25) and
PHOSFER-SO (PHOSFER-SO75, PHOSFER-S050 and
PHOSFER-SO25) were created, which used 75, 50 or 25%, re-
spectively, of the available soybean data. The performance of
each tool was evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation. The re-
sults are presented in Table 4, which suggests that the aforemen-
tioned conjecture may be at least partially incorrect. We expected
the performance of PHOSFER-SO to degrade when using smal-
ler amounts of soybean training data, but the performance of
PHOSFER to remain essentially the same; however, the per-
formance of both tools remained essentially unchanged even
when using only 25% of the soybean data. This may indicate
that the greater improvement in performance between
PHOSFER and PHOSFER-SO for T and Y sites relative to S
sites cannot be attributed solely to the greater amount of soybean
data available for S sites. Although we cannot pinpoint with
conﬁdence an alternative explanation for this difference, it is
possible that the patterns governing T and Y site recognition
are more complex than those governing S site recognition, and
thus beneﬁt more from the cross-species phosphorylation site
data used by PHOSFER. In any case, the fact that
PHOSFER-SO, PHOSFER-SO75, PHOSFER-S050 and
PHOSFER-SO25 performed similarly shows that the machine-
learning model used here (random forests using AAIndex indices
as features) is robust in the face of different amounts of training
data.

4 DISCUSSION

4.1 Phosphorylation site conservation

As shown in Table 2, the different organisms varied greatly in the
degree to which their phosphorylation sites were conserved in
soybean, and vice versa. Although the numbers varied somewhat
depending on the exact organism, in general, the percentage of
phosphorylation sites shared between soybean and another or-
ganism was ~10 times higher in the plants (Arabidopsis and rice)
than in the non-plant organisms. For example, 24.1% of S sites

The huge disparity in phosphorylation site conservation
among the different organisms means that the information pro-
vided by a training instance from one organism (e.g. human)
may not be as relevant to the decision problem as one from
another organism (e.g. Arabidopsis). This was the motivation
behind the use of the CB;C terms when calculating instance
weights for PHOSFER.

4.2 Kinase speciﬁcity

Although PHOSFER provides respectable accuracy for predict-
ing phosphorylation sites in soybean, its accuracy is still less than
that of most predictors that focus on human sites (Xue et al.,
2010). A portion of this underperformance could be attributed to
the smaller number of known phosphorylation sites in soybean
relative to human. However, a more important factor is likely the

lack of information regarding the kinases responsible for phos-
phorylating soybean phosphorylation sites. From years of
low-throughput laboratory experiments, the kinases responsible
for phosphorylating many human sites are known. For example,
there are currently 4985 human sites in the PhosphoSitePlus
database (Hornbeck et al., 2004, 2012) for which the correspond-
ing kinase is known. This information allows the creation of
kinase-speciﬁc predictors [the majority of current human pre-
dictors (Trost and Kusalik, 2011)], which typically have greater
accuracy than non-speciﬁc predictors (Neuberger et al., 2007).
Individual kinases, as well as families of kinases, have character-
istic recognition patterns, and it is likely easier to model such
recognition patterns than those of kinases in general. In contrast
to human, all currently known soybean phosphorylation sites
were determined using mass spectrometry—a high-throughput
technique that, although cheaper and faster than traditional

methods for studying kinase substrates, does not provide any
information on the kinases that catalyze the phosphorylation
of a given site. As such, it is currently impossible to create a
kinase-speciﬁc predictor for soybean, likely creating a ceiling
on the accuracy of future soybean predictors—as well as pre-
dictors for any other organism for which kinase-speciﬁc infor-
mation is unavailable.

4.3 Phosphorylation site conservation and kinase
recognition patterns

It was surprising that although PHOSFER generally exhibited
improved performance over the other PHOSFER variants that

used data from soybean (PHOSFER-NC, PHOSFER-EW and
PHOSFER-SO), its performance was rivaled—and in some cases
exceeded—by PHOSFER-A0. This is particularly interesting
given the level of phosphorylation site conservation between
Arabidopsis and soybean, which—although the highest of the
organisms tested—was only ~50% for Y sites and signiﬁcantly
less than that for S and T sites. How, then, can using Arabidopsis
data to predict soybean sites result in high predictive accuracy?
One possibility is that, although cellular signaling pathways and
processes may be only partially conserved between the two plants
(thus explaining the proportion of conserved phosphorylation
sites), the patterns dictating kinase recognition of those sites

are more similar. If this is the case, it certainly validates the use of
machine-learning tools for predicting phosphorylation sites in an
organism of interest (e. g. soybean), instead of (or in addition to)
simply ﬁnding conserved sites using known phosphorylation
data from a related organism (e.g. Arabidopsis). It would make
interesting future work to statistically characterize the patterns
found in the phosphorylation sites of various organisms, with
statistical measures indicating their similarity or dissimilarity.

4.4 Testing the efﬁcacy of simpler cross-species models

Given the comparable performance of PHOSFER with
PHOSFER-A0, as additional future work, it would be valuable
to further investigate the performance of simpler (than
PHOSFER) cross-species models. For example, would using
only rice sites as training data result in similar predictive per-
formance (relative to PHOSFER-A0) on soybean testing in-
stances? More generally, it would be worthwhile to determine
the relationship between conservation of phosphorylation sites
for each organism, as shown in Table 2, and the efﬁcacy of using
those data as training instances for predicting soybean sites.

4.5 Applicability to other organisms

In addition to soybean, the technique used by PHOSFER should
be applicable to other plants for which few known phosphoryl-
ation sites are available. For example, the number of known
phosphorylation sites in economically important crops like
corn, canola and wheat and in scientiﬁcally important model
organisms like Medicago truncatula, are currently comparable
with, or less than, that of soybean (Dinkel et al., 2011; Gao
et al., 2009b; Hornbeck et al., 2012). In addition, the technique
used by PHOSFER need not be restricted to plants; the accuracy
of predicting phosphorylation sites for virtually any organism of
interest could be enhanced by using data from related organisms.

4.6 Availability

Using the Galaxy platform (Goecks et al., 2010), we have made
PHOSFER available on the web. The user simply needs to
browse to http://saphire.usask.ca and upload a multi-FASTA
ﬁle. Three tab-delimited output ﬁles will be created: one contain-
ing the score given to each 15mer with S at its center and simi-
larly for T and Y. Each ﬁle contains four columns: the name of
the source protein, the 15mer sequence, the position of that
15mer sequence in the full protein and the predicted score.
Sequences with higher scores are more likely to be phosphoryl-
ation sites.

5 CONCLUSION

In this article, we have described a novel machine-learning model
for predicting phosphorylation sites in soybean using known
phosphorylation sites from both soybean and other organisms.
The use of data from other species resulted in a large improve-
ment in predictive accuracy for T and Y sites and a more modest
improvement for S sites. The species-speciﬁc instance weights
generally imparted a modest, but noticeable, increase in predict-
ive performance over similar models that lacked them; however,
surprisingly a model using only Arabidopsis data for training was

able to achieve roughly equivalent performance. We hope that
the techniques outlined here—random forests, AAIndex features
and the use of cross-species training data—can be used as the
basis for even more accurate phosphorylation site predictors,
especially for organisms having few experimentally characterized
phosphorylation sites.

Abstract

Motivation: High—dimensional omic data derived from different technological platforms have been
extensively used to facilitate comprehensive understanding of disease mechanisms and to deter—
mine personalized health treatments. Numerous studies have integrated multi—platform omic data;
however, few have efficiently and simultaneously addressed the problems that arise from high
dimensionality and complex correlations.

Results: We propose a statistical framework of shared informative factor models that can jointly
analyze multi—platform omic data and explore their associations with a disease phenotype. The
common disease—associated sample characteristics across different data types can be captured
through the shared structure space, while the corresponding weights of genetic variables directly
index the strengths of their association with the phenotype. Extensive simulation studies demon—
strate the performance of the proposed method in terms of biomarker detection accuracy via com—
parisons with three popular regularized regression methods. We also apply the proposed method
to The Cancer Genome Atlas lung adenocarcinoma dataset to jointly explore associations of
mRNA expression and protein expression with smoking status. Many of the identified biomarkers
belong to key pathways for lung tumorigenesis, some of which are known to show differential ex—
pression across smoking levels. We discover potential biomarkers that reveal different mechan—
isms of lung tumorigenesis between light smokers and heavy smokers.

1 Introduction

OXFORD

 

The success of the Human Genome Project enables genome—wide
studies of various biological activities in humans and other organ-
isms. The extensive development of high—throughput biotechnolo—
gies have made data accessible from different platforms, including
RNA sequencing, copy number variation, DNA methylation and
protein lysate arrays. Although vital to the progress of biomedical
research, these multi—platform data impose new challenges for data
analysis. In addition to high dimensionality and complex correl-
ations within and across platforms, different types of omic data also
likely have different scales and distributions (Zhang et 61]., 2012).

Therefore, appropriate and effective analytical methods are desir—
able to extract useful information from the emerging data platforms.

Integrative analysis of multi—platform data has been proposed to
study the interplay within and between different levels of biological
data (Chari et 61]., 2010; Kristensen et 61]., 2014; Rhodes and
Chinnaiyan, 2005). A large number of statistical methods have been
discussed for different applications and purposes. For example, se—
quential analysis (e.g. multiple concerted disruption, (Chari et 61].,
2010)) confirms or refines the findings obtained from one data type
by analyzing additional omic data collected from the common set of
samples. Pairwise correlation of genetic variables (e.g. weighted

gene correlation network analysis, (Langfelder and Horvath, 2008))
is used to infer molecular network interactions. Network analysis
(e.g. jActiveModules (Ha et al., 2015; Ideker et al., 2002)) identifies
active or aberrant subsets in a certain biological system using mo—
lecular network interactions based on graphical models. Bayesian
network approaches (Chekouo et al., 2015; Ni et al., 2014) identify
biomarkers that are associated with clinical outcomes by incorporat—
ing another type of biomarkers collected from the same samples
through prior distributions. Another line of work in canonical cor-
relation analysis (CCA) intends to identify the linear combinations
of the two sets of genetic variables which have maximum correlation
with each other. More recent development based on the original
CCA includes sparse CCA which identifies the linear combinations
of the two high—dimensional genomic data by incorporating penalty
function, supervised CCA which associates the linear combinations
with some clinical outcome, and multiple CCA which extends to the
case of more than two datasets (Witten and Tibshirani, 2009;
Witten et al., 2009).

We propose to simultaneously analyze multi—platform data to
detect predictive biomarkers for a response variable of interest,
which is typically a disease—associated phenotype. The widely used
variable selection approach aggregates genetic variables derived
from different platforms as covariates in regression models for the
response variable (Bovelstad et al., 2007; Mankoo et al., 2011). To
address the extremely high dimensionality of the covariate space,
which is much larger than the number of samples, sparsity—induced
penalization methods have been commonly used. This line of work
includes the L1—penalty—based Lasso (Tibshirani, 1996), its improved
version, adaptive Lasso (Zou, 2006), L1 and L2 combined elastic net
(Zou and Hastie, 2005) and smoothly clipped absolute deviation
(SCAD) (Fan and Li, 2001; Fan and Peng, 2004). The SCAD
method has been shown to have appealing theoretical oracle proper—
ties (unbiasedness, sparsity and continuity) (Fan et al., 2001).
However, the drawbacks of regression—based methods include a
limitation on the number of selected variables according to the avail—
able sample size and the incapability to detect correlated variables.

To address these challenges, we propose a framework of shared
informative factor models to use in integrating multiple types of
omic data plus a disease—associated response variable. In contrast to
the conventional factor models, we incorporate the disease pheno—
type information in the factor space to detect genetic variables that
interact with the response variable. In addition, we assume a com—
mon structured factor across multiple data types for the purpose of
detecting different levels of the important disease—associated genetic
variables. The proposed framework lays the foundation for incorpo—
rating prior biological knowledge on functional pathways and net—
works, both within a data type and across different data types to
improve the biological relevance of the results.

2 Methods

2.1 A framework of shared informative factor models

We describe a new model framework to explore associations
between a disease phenotype and high—throughput genetic data gen—
erated from multiple (2 2) platforms. Herein, we focus on two—
platform data for the purpose of demonstration. Let the n X [)1
matrix X1 and n x [)2 matrix X2 denote two data matrices contain—
ing the intensity measurements of [)1 genetic variables obtained from
platform 1 and those of [)2 genetic variables obtained from platform
2, respectively. Correspondingly, we let the length—n vector y denote
the phenotypes of 11 subjects (e.g. smoking status, cancer subtype).

The system is built upon the generalized linear models, considering
exponential family of distributions for genetic variables in X1 and
X2 (e.g. continuous measurements, count data). We can express the
transformed mean functions of the expression intensities of genetic
variables via canonical link functions g1 and g2, respectively corres—
ponding to X1 and X2, as follows,

g1{E(X1)} = C>11 + CA,

1
g2{E(X2)} 2 d2 -i— CB. ( )

For the demonstration, we focus on continuously measured genetic
variables (e.g. gene expression, protein expression, DNA copy num-
ber), for which the identity link g1(u) : g2(u) : u is used. We also
assume the genetic variables in X1 and X2 follow normal distribu-
tions (posterior to transformation when appropriate). The n x 1
parameter vectors (:1 and (12 respectively correspond to baseline
sample effects in two sets of genetic data. The jth columns of the
n x [)1 residual matrix 81 of X1 and the n x in residual matrix 82 of
X2 follow mean-0 normal distributions with the respective variances
6%]- and 6%. Our interest is drawn to the multiplicative terms CA
and CB, which capture the associations between the phenotype and
genetic variables. Our framework has two main distinctions from
the conventional factor models that have similar forms. First, the 11
X1 parameter vector C is structured to deliver the phenotype infor—
mation. In the case of a K—categorical phenotype (e.g. K levels of
smoking status), C : {C1,...,C1, ...,cl, ...,cl,... ,cK,.. .,cK}T,
with 6; indicating the common effect that the subjects in the lth
phenotype contribute to the associations between the phenotypes
and genetic variables. Second, the same C is employed in these two
models to represent the common intrinsic sample characteristics in
the two sets of genetic data. The length—p1 vector A and length-p2
vector B contain the weights that the genetic variables contribute to
the structured sample characteristics shared by the two sets of gen—
etic data. The elements of A and B are called association scores. We
call this new system shared informative factor models (SIFORM).

For model identifiability, we impose 2:721 61-2 = 1. We also fol—
low the established practice of standardizing the intensity values of
each genetic variable prior to the downstream analysis.

2.2 Model estimation
In the above—described framework, the log—likelihood of the two sets
of observed genetic data is

m n (9611," — 0L1," — C] -a,-)2 1 2
I

p2 n (x21'—0L2'—C  1
Z I 1 l I 2

i=1 i=1

+

To identify important genetic variables associated with the
phenotype of interest, we also impose a sparsity regularization on
the elements of the parameter vectors A and B in model estimation.
We adopt the SCAD penalization method (Fan et al., 2001), which
uses symmetric penalty functions that are non-concave on (0, 00) to
simultaneously select the variables and estimate the coefficients.
SCAD has been shown to have good theoretical properties and to
offer promising empirical results.

We obtain parameter estimates via minimizing the following ob-
jective function, which is simply the negative penalized log-likelihood,

where P5(.) : 82 —  — 8)ZI < 8), and its first—order derivative is
Pg(.) : 8I(. g 8) +wj+f+1(. > 8). We take the value of 6123.7 as
suggested by (Fan et al., 2001). Herein, 81 and 82 are the penalty
tuning parameters that respectively correspond to the two sets of
genetic data.

We adopt the local linear approximation of Zou and Li (2008)
for the sparsity penalty term and find a convex function to imple-
ment the efficient majorization—minimization algorithm (Hunter
and Li, 2005). Using P5,(|a,-|) as an example, the local linear ap—
proximation can be expressed as

where 611(k) is the value of a,- estimated at step 12. Then the majoriza—

Similarly, we can obtain the majorization function G5,(|b,-|) for
P820511)-

We have thus obtained the parameter estimates by iteratively
minimizing the following objective function,

P1 P2
5* = —l + Z G81(|dj|) + Z G82(ibii)-

At the (k —l— 1)th step, we can obtain the closed—form penalized log—
likelihood estimators for the elements of A and B as

All the other parameter estimates are obtained via their closed—form
solutions in a straightforward manner at each step; therefore, we
omit the details here.

The tuning parameters 2» = (81, 82) are important for calibrating
the goodness—of—fit for the data and model sparsity. We adopt the
Bayesian information criterion (BIC) (Schwarz, 1978), which is
widely used in high—dimensional studies (Fan, 2013; Zou et al.,
2007), and defined as

BIC = —21+10g(n(191 + 192)) ' 611%),

where df(7t) is proportional to the summation of the number of non-
zeros in A and the number of nonzeros in B. The pair of (81, 82) that
achieves the smallest BIC value is obtained by using a two—
dimensional grid search over a pre—determined space. The value is
typically between 0 and 10 for each tuning parameter.

2.3 Iterative algorithm

We provide the details of the iterative parameter estimation proced—
ure in Algorithm 1. The convergence threshold 8 is set to be 10—5.
We also learn from extensive simulations that the estimation seems
to stabilize within 300 iterations. We stop the iterative procedure

when either convergence is reached or 300 iterations are completed,
whichever occurs first.

3 Simulation studies

We conducted extensive simulations to assess the performance of
the proposed SIFORM and compared its performance to several
popular regularized regression methods SCAD, Lasso, adaptive
Lasso (adaLasso), and two canonical correlation analysis (CCA)
based methods: multiple CCA (mCCA) and penalized collaborative
regression (pCollRe) (Gross and Tibshirani, 2015; Witten and
Tibshirani, 2009; Witten et al., 2009). These methods can be imple—
mented directly using the respective R packages not/reg, glmnet,
parcor and PMA. The tuning parameters are selected by the 5—fold
cross—validation procedure.

We use seven simulation scenarios to study the various data gen—
eration models, inter—genetic marker dependence structures and re—
sidual variances. In scenarios 1—3 and 5—6, we consider a phenotype
variable Y categorized into four groups and two high—dimensional
genetic profiling matrices, X1 and X2. In the three penalized regres—
sion methods, all the genetic variables in X1 and X2 are treated as
the covariates to predict the phenotype. Note that multinomial logis—
tic regression models are used for the response variable of smoking
status in four categories. For SCAD, we take the union of all the
nonzero coefficients identified in three separate logistic regression
models, treating the category of non—smoker as the reference group.
In contrast, SIFORM conveniently uses A and B to identify the im-
portant biomarkers despite the different disease phenotypes. In

X.An et al.

 

addition, we investigated scenarios 4 and 7 wherein integration of
three bioinformatics data platforms is considered.

In brief, scenarios 1—4 generate genetic data from model (1), and
scenarios 5—7 simulate discrete phenotype data from multinomial lo-
gistic regression models. The data matrices Xk(k : 1, 2, 3) in scen—
arios 5—7 and residuals 8k (12 = 1,2,3) in scenarios 1—4 are simulated
from multivariate mean—0 normal distributions. The corresponding
variances are set to be 1 for all the multivariate normally distributed
variables in scenarios 1—4. In scenario 6, they are sampled from a
lung cancer dataset obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA). In terms of the data dependence structure, the genetic vari—
ables in X1 and X2 are mutually independent in scenario 1; the gen—
etic variables with nonzero coefficients are correlated with p = 0.8,
and 14—32% of the remaining genetic variables are weakly corre—
lated with p = 0.2 in scenarios 2—7. Throughout all the scenarios,
sparse true biomarkers that are associated with the phenotype are
assumed. Additional details for the five simulation scenarios follow.

° Scenario 1: We equally assign 120 samples to the four categories
of the phenotype y, which gives the corresponding C = (0.033,
...,0.033, 0.067,...,0.067,0.100,...,0.100,0.133,...,0.133).
Each sample has intensity measurements collected over 100 gen—
etic variables in dataset 1 (X1) and over 100 genetic variables in
dataset 2 (X2). In each dataset, only the ﬁrst 5 genetic variables
are associated with the phenotype, with the sparse coefﬁcient
vectors A1X100 : (5, 7, 11, 15, 18,0, . . . , 0) and B1X100 :
(4, 8, 10, 14,20,0, . . . ,0). All the genetic variables are assumed
to be mutually independent. The baselines 0L1 and 012 are set to be
0, and the intensity measurements in X1 and X2 are simulated
from model (1).

° Scenario 2: This scenario is the same as scenario 1, except that
we assume a blockwise compound symmetry correlation struc—
ture among the genetic variables to mimic real studies.

' Scenario 3: In this higher dimensional case, 160 samples are
equally assigned to four categories, and there are 1000 variables
in each of the two genetic datasets. Among the genetic variables,
only the ﬁrst 50 have nonzero coefﬁcients in each dataset. The
data are generated in the same way as in scenario 2.

° Scenario 4: The only difference from scenario 2 is that we include
the third omics dataset X3 which contains additional 100 genetic
variables and is generated from X3 : 0L3 —l— CD —l— 63 with the cor—
responding sparse coefﬁcient vectors D1X100 : (3, 6, 9, 12, 17,0,
...,0)andoc3 =0.

° Scenario 5: We use a multinomial logistic regression model to
generate the phenotype. We consider a total of 200 samples and
100 genetic variables, where the ﬁrst 5 variables are true bio—
markers, in each of X1 and X2. Letting the sparse coefﬁcient vec—
tors Ammo = (6, 14,14,24,2o,o,... ,0), Bmxloo = (4,12,
10,18,18,o,...,0),Ammo=(3,14,11,24,24,o,...,0) and
Bmlxloo =(2,1o,13, 24,23,0,...,0),A(3)1X100 =(2,14,15,2o, 25,
0,...,0) and B(3)1X100:(2,10,11,21,23,0,...,0), we have the
logit transformed predictor 11,-, : log(11:((;’:,l,))) :
A(1)X1i—l—B(1)X2,-, [2 1,2,3. The probability of Y,- =lispi1 :
enil/ (Ll—211:1 enik). Accordingly, we sample Y,- from the multi-
nomial distribution MN (1, [2,1, pi2, pi3, p24). The genetic intensity
values follow multivariate mean—0 normal distributions. The gen-

 

erated data are fairly balanced. For example, a simulated dataset
contains 66, 40, 43 and 51 samples in the four respective
categories.

° Scenario 6: We investigate a higher dimensional setting for the
data generated under a multinomial logistic regression model,
which is similar to scenario 4. We consider 230 samples, with X1

and X2 respectively containing 3500 and 150 genetic variables.
This dimensionality is comparable to that of the TCGA lung can—
cer dataset we use to illustrate the real application of our
method. Among the genetic variables, only the ﬁrst 30 in X1 and
the ﬁrst 10 in X2 are the true predictors of the phenotype. As an
example, a simulated dataset produces 59, 47, 49 and 75 samples
in the four respective phenotype categories.

° Scenario 7: We investigate a 3—platform setting in which the data
is generated from a multinomial logistic regression model. The
same X1, X2, Amlxloo  = 1,2, 3), and Banxloo  = 1,2,  11’1
scenario 5 are used here. The only difference from scenario 5 is
that we include the additional third omics dataset X3 which con—
tains 100 genetic variables with the corresponding sparse coefﬁ—
cient vectors Dmlxloo : (3,9,12,15,22,0,.. ., 0), Dmlxloo :
(4, 8, 12,20,23,o, . . . ,0), and D(3,1X100 = (3,10,15, 19, 24, o,
. . . , 0). Similar to scenario 5, Y,- is generated from the logit trans—
formed mean model nil : log(11:((;’:l,))) : A(1)X1,- —l— B(1)X2,-—l—
D(1)X3i, [2 1,2, 

 

We ran 100 simulations for each scenario. We report the average
value and standard error of the true positive rate (TPR), true nega—
tive rate (TNR) and false discovery rate (FDR) among the top gen—
etic variables detected that have the largest values of |A|or|B| for
SIFORM, and the largest absolute values of the regression coeffi—
cients for the other methods. For scenario 3 with 100 true bio—
markers, we focus on the top 10 biomarkers detected by different
methods. For all the other scenarios, we focus on the top 5 bio—
markers detected.

We report the variable selection results in Table 1. The first four
scenarios correspond to the generation of data from the shared in-
formative factor models, considering independent and dependent
genetic variables, different levels of dimensionality and different
number of platforms. The simulations demonstrate the consistently
superior performance of the SIFORM method compared to those of
the five other methods in terms of biomarker detection accuracy
across the scenarios. pCollRe shows the second best performance,
especially in high-dimensional scenarios, partially because both
sparsity—induced L1— and smoothing L2—penalties are used to obtain
better—behaved estimates (Gross and Tibshirani, 2015). In contrast,
mCCA’s performance appears to be inferior and unstable in terms of
TPR and FDR. Among the penalized regression methods, SCAD de—
tects the highest number of true biomarkers while sacrificing false
positives, and thus yields a high FDR. The remaining two penalized
regression approaches, Lasso and adaLasso, detect fewer true bio—
markers, and adaLasso produces a lower FDR than Lasso and
SCAD.

We also considered generating data from a logistic regression
model under scenarios 5, 6 and 7, which represent different dimen-
sionalities and numbers of platforms of genetic data. While the dif—
ferences between SIFORM and the other three methods are not as
large as in the first three scenarios, the advantage of using SIFORM
in terms of selecting true biomarkers is still clear. In the most scen—
arios, SIFORM detects the most true biomarkers with the smallest
FDR among all the six evaluated methods. In contrast, SCAD,
Lasso and mCCA yield high FDR, implying that large numbers of
trivial genetic variables are selected into the models. pCollRe is
again the second best performer, in fact, it discovers more true posi—
tives than SIFORM in scenario 6, but at the sacrifice of FDR.
Furthermore, we evaluated the phenotype prediction performance of
SIFORM and pCollRe via cross—validation, and the result suggests
that pCollRe may not be well—suited for prediction, coherent with
the observation in the literature (Gross and Tibshirani, 2015 ). For

simplicity, in scenario 6 we focused on the samples in the two most
extreme phenotype categories 3) = 1 versus 4. We used leave—one—
out cross—validation and obtained the average misclassification rate
for each dataset. To make a fair comparison, we focused on the pre—
dictive performance of the top 5 biomarkers identified by each
method. The means (standard deviations) of misclassification rates
of SIFORM and pCollRe are, respectively, 0.283 (0.085) and 0.409
(0.090) across 100 generated datasets. The result indicates that
SIFORM also outperforms pCollRe in terms of prediction.

Figure 1depicts the boxplots of the number of TPRs and FDRs
obtained by all six methods over 100 simulations under scenarios 3
and 7.

We also assessed the performance of the BIC in our proposed
framework. We use scenario 3 as an example. Figure 2 shows the
BIC values along the tuning parameters 81 and 82 in a simulated
dataset. Reading from left to right in Figure 2, the subpanels corres—
pond to 81 values increasing from 2.5 to 4.6. In each subpanel, the
BIC values are plotted against the values of 82 in increments of 0.3.
The good behavior of the BIC method is indicated by clear convex

curves, with (81 = 3.4, 82 = 4) chosen as the optimal tuning param-
eter values for this dataset. In a common scenario, we note that the
results are very similar across different simulated datasets, and thus,
we use the tuning parameter values obtained from a single dataset
for computational consideration.

4 Lung cancer applications

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United
States (Sanchez—Cespedes et al., 2001). Among the major histolo-
gical types of lung cancer, adenocarcinoma is the most common
form in non-smokers (Sun et al., 2007). We investigated the applic—
ability of SIFORM to the TCGA lung adenocarcinoma dataset avail—
able through the data portal hosted by the National Cancer Institute
(http://cancergenome.nih.gov/). Particularly, we focused on two
phenotypes, smoking status and survival, to demonstrate the applic—
ability of SIFORM and explore new molecular biomarkers that may
facilitate understanding of lung cancer.

Integrating multi-platform bioinformatic data

 

4.1 The association of biomarkers with smoking status
Cigarette smoking is the most important risk factor for lung cancer;
however, approximately 25% of lung cancer cases are not attribut—
able to tobacco use. Striking differences in the epidemiological, clin-
ical and molecular characteristics of lung cancer have been
demonstrated when the cancer arises in a non—smoker versus a
smoker (Samet et al., 2009; Sun et al., 2007; Yano et al., 2008,
2011). This suggests that the lung cancers are likely caused by separ—
ate biological mechanisms for smokers and nonsmokers.

Substantial studies have identified the genes and pathways that
contribute to lung tumorigenesis in smokers (e.g. EGFR, KRAS and
TP53) (Ding et al., 2008; Sun et al., 2007), and these discoveries
have led to the development of targeted therapies (e.g. EGFR tyro—
sine kinase inhibitor erlotinib; anti—VEGF antibody bevacizumab)
(Serke, 2007). However, most of the studies have analyzed genetic
profiles in a single assay, and the etiology of lung tumors that arise
in non-smokers remains unclear (Sun et al., 2007). Therefore, it is
worthwhile to integrate multi—platform bioinformatic data to dis—
cover predictive biomarkers that are associated with the smoking
status of patients diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma.

4.1.1 Data description

The TCGA lung adenocarcinoma dataset includes samples from 225
patients, from whom expression intensities of 20 531 genes and 160
proteins were measured using the respective platforms of Illumina
RNA sequencing and reverse—phase protein array (RPPA) technol-
ogy. The variable of smoking status has four categories. Among the
225 patients represented in the samples, there were 49 with the sta—
tus of ‘current smoker’, 86 with ‘current reformed smoker for < or
= 15 years’, 58 with ‘current reformed smoker for >15 years’ and
32 with ‘lifelong non-smoker’.

The gene expression data were normalized using the RNA—seq
by Expectation—Maximization approach (Li and Dewey, 2011) and
logarithm-transformed prior to downstream analysis. The protein
concentration data were also normalized by subtracting the median,
both column—wise and row—wise (Li et al., 2013).

4.1.2 A subsample study

The six methods we investigated aim to simultaneously analyze gen—
etic variables to detect predictive biomarkers for a given phenotype.
We were further interested in investigating the capabilities of the
methods to detect biomarkers that are likely marginally associated
with the phenotype, using individual marker tests as the reference.

We subsampled 300 genes and 100 proteins from all the genetic
variables. Because the truth is unknown in a real data study, we
treated 30 genes as the true biomarkers; these genes were identified
via gene shaving (Hastie et al., 2000) or with the smallest P—values
obtained from a univariate F—test. The remaining 270 ‘null’ genes
are genes that have the largest P—values obtained from the univariate
F—test. Among the 100 proteins, 10 were treated as truly important
as determined by gene shaving and univariate test results. The other
90 ‘null’ proteins are proteins with the largest P—values based on the
univariate F—test.

We report the results of our implementation of all six methods in
Table 2(a), which lists the TPR, TNR and FDR values. Compared to
the other methods, SIFORM has superior performance in terms of
accurate biomarker detection. pCollRe has the second highest true
positive rate among the remaining methods. Lasso performs the
worst in both true and false biomarker detection, while SCAD and
adaLasso have similar performances, with discovery rates better

than Lasso. These results are consistent with the simulation results
demonstrated in the previous section.

4.1.3 Full data analysis

We implemented the following steps to filter out trivial genes in the
RNA—seq data. First, we removed 5% of the genes that had ex—
tremely small coefficient of variation values, where the coefficient of
variation is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the ab—
solute value of the mean of the gene expression intensities. Second,
we removed genes for which the difference between the top 90%
quantile and the bottom 10% quantile was no larger than 0.8. Then,
we filtered out the genes with P—value Z 0.03 based on a univariate
analysis of variance F—test. This procedure retained 3707 genes for
further analysis.

We implemented all six methods for the integrative analysis of
the genomic and proteomic data. To determine the tuning param-
eter values in SIFORM, we performed a grid search over
[4,14] for 81 and [1,10] for 82. We obtained (81,82) : (5.2,4) as
the local optimal values. SIFORM identified 17 genes that had non—
zero coefficients in A: ATP13A4, BANK1, C200rf103, C50rf41, C7,
DBF4B, FAM65C, LOC100132707, MACRODZ, PCDHACZ,
RSPOZ, STOM, THOC4, TLR3, TMEM173, UGT1A4 and USP53.
SIFORM also detected 13 proteins based on B: 4E-BP1, 4E-
BP1_pT70, Akt_pS473, caspase—7_cleavedD198, Chk1, Chk2_pT68,
EGFR_pY1068, JNKZ, PCNA, PDK1_ps241, Ret_pY905, stathmin
and tuberin.

We performed hierarchical clustering of the samples based on
the Pearson correlation distance and applied Ward’s linkage method
to the selected genes and proteins. The clustering heatmaps using the
17 genes and 13 proteins, respectively, are displayed in Figure 3. In
both panels, we observe that most ‘non—smokers’ (yellow) and ‘cur—
rent reformed smokers for >15 years’ (orange) are clustered to—
gether. In addition, most of the 49 ‘current smokers’ (blue) are
mixed with some ‘current reformed smokers for < :15 years’
(green). However, the data for some of the 86 recently reformed
smokers (green) behave differently from the rest of the group; these
samples enlarge the overall difference between the green and blue
groups. The observations can be somewhat reﬂected from the esti—
mate of C = (—0.064, —0.074,0.015,0.104). The close values (61,
62) between ‘non—smokers’ and ‘current reformed smokers for >15
years’ indicate similarity between the major genetic profiling charac-
teristics of these two categories of smoking status. The relatively
large difference between (61, c2), C3 and C4 manifests possible genetic
profiling variations between (roughly) non—smokers, recent smokers

and current smokers. In particular, the most different genetic pro—
files are those of non—smokers compared to current smokers, which
agrees with our intuitive expectation.

We can also visually see that the most identified biomarkers show
clear differential expression between light smoking and heavy smok—
ing. For instance, the genes contained in the first 13 rows of the heat—
map in the upper panel have lower expression levels in heavy smokers
but higher expression levels in light smokers, and the bottom four
genes show the opposite expression pattern. As an example, gene
UGT1A4 (the 14th gene in the upper panel of Fig. 3) appears to be
up—regulated in the heavy smokers but down—regulated in the light
smokers. Extensive evidence shows that UGT1A4 can be induced by
cigarette constituents (Bock et al., 1994; Collier et al., 2002).

We summarize the comparisons among the six methods in terms
of variable selection as follows.

° SCAD, Lasso, adaLasso, pCollRe and mCCA identify 60, 22,
33, 27 and 12 genes, respectively. SCAD detects more genes than
the other methods; however, it likely yields the largest number of
false positives, as indicated by the simulation studies. No com—
mon gene is identiﬁed across the six methods. This implies an on-
going challenge for genetic studies of the association between
smoking and lung cancer, which is also reﬂected in the very lim—
ited medical literature in this area of research. SCAD, Lasso and
mCCA, all of which are known to produce high false positives,
identiﬁed 5 genes in common. AdaLasso and pCollRe, which are
known to have appealing empirical and theoretical properties

Fig. 3. Sample clustering based on genes and proteins selected by SIFORM

(Gross and Tibshirani, 2015; Zou, 2006), identiﬁed very few
genes that overlap with those identiﬁed by the other comparative
methods but substantially overlap with those identiﬁed by
SIFORM (13 by adaLasso and 10 by pCollRe).

° In terms of proteomic proﬁling, SCAD, Lasso, adaLasso and
mCCA identiﬁed very few proteins, 3, 0, 1 and 1, respectively,
that are associated with smoking status. In contrast, our pro—
posed method, SIFORM detected 13 proteins and pCollRe de—
tected 10. SIFORM and pCollRe identiﬁed 9 proteins in
common, which could be more convincing due to the good per—
formance of pCollRe in simulation studies.

Next, we studied the biological relevance of the genes and pro—
teins detected by SIFORM. Conducting pathway analysis with a
web—based tool, Pathway Commons (http://www.pathwaycom
mons.org/pcvizl), we discovered that 13 genes likely interact with
each other through functional pathways and networks. This is dis—
played in Figure 4(a), where these genes are highlighted in green.

Integrating multi-platform bioinformatic data

 

The important miRNAs associated with a common pathway are
shown in red. The 8 detected proteins appear to be in several com—
mon pathways, as highlighted in green in Figure 4(b). Several of
them are known to be associated with lung cancer.

EGFR, which was detected in our study, has been found to play
a key role in lung tumorigenesis. Approximately 10% of non-small-
cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cases in the US. and 35% in East Asia
have tumor—associated EGFR mutations. EGFR mutations are more
often found in tumors from non—smokers with adenocarcinoma hist—
ology (http://www.mycancergenome.org/content/disease/lung—can
cer/egfr/; Lovly et al., 2015 ), which supports the biological relevance
of our finding.

Activated EGFR can regulate the activity of another detected
gene, PCNA, and trigger its important downstream signaling path—
way AKT/PI3K (Sarris et al., 2012). PCNA, an index of tumor cell
proliferation, has high expression in poorly differentiated lung
adenocarcinomas (Brand et al., 2011; Ma et al., 2008). Another de—
tected biomarker, AKT1, is an isoform of AKT (Fumarola et al.,
2014). The signal transduction pathway AKT/PI3K is involved in
the regulation of cell proliferation, survival, differentiation, adhe—
sion, motility and invasion. Aberrations of this pathway have been
implicated in lung cancer development and progression (Fumarola
et al., 2014).

Most of the proteins selected by SIFORM are associated with
the tumorigenesis of NSCLC through the AKT pathway, as shown
by Figure 4(b). First, the activated AKT pathway regulates tuberin
(TS C2), which inhibits the mTOR nutrient signaling input through
the tuberous sclerosis complex. mTOR has been correlated with
NSCLC tumor progression (Fumarola et al., 2014; Sarris et al.,
2012). Second, the activated AKT phosphorylates CHEKI, an inte-
gral component of the DNA damage response. The overexpression
of CHEKI is associated with poor tumor differentiation and signifi-
cantly worse patient survival in NSCLC (Grabauskiene et al., 2014).
In addition, activated AKT induces the phosphorylation and inacti—
vation of EIF4EBP1, and the increased phosphorylation of
EIF4EBP1 is found to be associated with progression of several
types of cancer, including lung adenocarcinoma (Dumstorf et al.,
2010; Gingras et al., 1998; Sekia et al., 2010). In addition to EGFR,
we identified another activator of the AKT/PI3K pathways—RET.
The alteration of RET has key roles in cell growth, differentiation
and survival, and has been associated with NSCLC (Fumarola et al.,
2014). In addition to PI3K/AKT, RET signaling activates the MAPK
family, including MAPK9 (jNKZ) (Giunti et al., 2013). Some studies
have found that MAPK9 is frequently activated in NSCLC (Nitta
et al., 2011).

In summary, EGFR and its downstream PI3K/AKT pathway are
among the most important molecular therapeutic targets for
NSCLC (Cooper et al., 2013; Ren et al., 2012). Existing studies
suggest differences in EFGR mutations between smokers and non—
smokers, and thus implicate the AKT/PBK pathway and its down—
stream targets as playing nontrivial roles that differ in patients who
develop lung cancer and have a history of smoking versus those who
have never smoked. In contrast, other methods have identified only
one protein, collagen VI, which is an extracellular matrix protein.
Although collagen VI has been correlated with tumor progression,
its role in NSCLC is rarely discussed (Chen et al., 2013; Voiles et al.,
2014)

Cross-validation: We evaluated the prediction performance of
each method used in simulation. For simplicity, we focused on the
81 patients whose habits placed them in the two most extreme cate—
gories related to smoking: 49 who were current smokers and 32
who were lifelong non—smokers. We used leave—one—out cross—

validation to predict the smoking status of each patient. This pro—
cedure was repeated 81 times to obtain the overall misclassification
rate. To make a fair comparison, we focused on the predictive per—
formance of the top 5 biomarkers with the largest absolute coeffi—
cient estimates. The misclassification rates of SIFORM, SCAD,
Lasso, adaLasso, mCCA and pCollRe are respectively 0.407, 0.469,
0.593, 0.556, 0.605 and 0.593. These results indicate that SIFORM
has the best prediction accuracy. The overall high misclassification
rates across the six methods might arise from the limited sample
sizes and the recognized difficulty of differentiating the genetic
mechanisms of lung cancer attributable to smoking versus not
smoking.

4.2 The association of biomarkers with survival
The 5 —year survival rate for lung cancer is only approximately 15%,
and the conventional treatments (e.g. chemotherapy) have limited
impact on improving survival of advanced NSCLC. Biological func—
tions of biomarkers may play important roles in disease formation
and progression. Therefore, identification of such biomarkers can
likely advance targeted cancer therapies towards the direction of
personalized medicine (Kuykendall and Chiappori, 2014). The inte-
grative analysis of multi—platform bioinformatic data aims at under—
standing the underlying relationship between survival and genetic
activities at different levels in patients with lung adenocarcinoma.
We investigate the same set of gene intensity and protein expres—
sion data as described in Section 4.1. The only difference is that the
survival phenotype is considered here. We divide 219 patients into
two groups (Long—Term Survival (LTS) and Short—Term Survival
(STS)) according to the length of survival time. By using an extreme
discordant phenotype design (Nebert, 2000), we define the top 25 %
(55 patients, surviving >896 days) of the patients as LTSs and the
bottom 65% (29 patients, surviving <5 93 days) as STSs. We include
these 84 patients in data analysis.

4.2.1 A subsample study

We again subsampled 300 genes and 100 proteins, among which 30
genes and 10 proteins are selected as the true biomarkers. The sam—
pling and selection procedure is described in Section 4.1.2. We re—
port the results obtained by the six methods in Table 2(b).
Compared to the other methods, SIFORM shows superior perform-
ance in terms of biomarker detection accuracy, in particular, TPR.
pCollRe performs the second best, while Lasso produces the small—
est true negative rate. The variables detected by each method are all
the true biomarkers (FDR: 0) for this particular case. Overall, the
result is also consistent with the simulation studies.

4.2.2 Full data analysis

We filtered out trivial genes in the RNA—seq dataset in the similar
fashion as described in Section 4.1.3. This procedure results in 2529
genes included in the following data analysis. We implemented all
the six methods. For SIFORM, the tuning parameters (81, 82) are set
to (4.7, 1.9) using the BIC method. Consequently, SIFORM identi-
fied 12 proteins: 4E-BP1, CD49b, Cyclin_B1, ER-alpha, ER-
alpha_pS118, Fibronectin, INPP4B, LCN2a, Napsin-A, PAI-1,
PCNA and TTF1. In comparison, SCAD, Lasso, adaLasso, mCCA
and pCollRe detected 1, 1, 1, 1 and 4 proteins, respectively; these
five methods identified only one common protein, estrogen receptor
(ER)-alpha. The prognostic values of ER expressions in lung cancer
have been extensively discussed. ER proteins, including ER-alpha, is
found to be associated with a poorer prognosis among NSCLC

patients (Kawai et al., 2005; Olivo—Marston et al., 2010). This pro—
tein is also discovered by SIFORM.

We also notice that the most proteins identified by SIFORM are
found biologically relevant to lung cancer prognosis. 4E-BP1 is a
eIF4E binding protein, which is known to be related to reduced sur—
vival in a variety of cancers including lung adenocarcinoma. High
4E-BP1 expression has been found to be correlated with worse over—
all survival of lung cancer patients (Dumstorf et al., 2010; Lee et al.,
2015; LV et al., 2015). Cyclin B1 plays a key role in the G2—M phase
transition of the cell cycle, the elevated expression level of which has
been shown as an indicator of poor prognosis in NSCLC (Arinaga
et al., 2003; Cooper et al., 2009; Yoshida et al., 2004). Fibronectin,
which plays an important role in cell adhesion, migration, growth
and differentiation by mediating cellular interactions with the extra—
cellular matrix, stimulates NSCLC cell growth and survival through
activation of Akt/mTOIUp70S6K and inactivation of LKB1/AMPK
signal pathways (Han et al., 2006; Pankov and Yamada, 2002).
Napsin-A and TTF1 have been extensively studied as the correlated
prognostic factors for lung cancer patients’ survival. Patients with
high expression levels of TTF—1 and Napsin A have better survival
rates than those with low levels of expression (Ma et al., 2015).
Finally, high expression levels of PAI-1 and PCNA proteins indicate
a shorter survival for patients diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma
(Di Bernardo et al., 2009; Robert et al., 1999).

In terms of gene expression profile, SCAD, Lasso, adaLasso,
mCCA and pCollRe identified 24, 40, 17, 215 and 29 genes, respect—
ively, compared to none detected by SIFORM. However, no com—
mon genes are identified across these five methods. Moreover, we
observe that only eight genes are identified by any four methods sim-
ultaneously, but none of them has been reported to be correlated
with lung cancer survival in the literature.

We also used the Kaplan—Meier method to further investigate if
the selected proteins can differentiate patients in terms of length of
survival time. Specifically, we fit logistic regression to the binary sur—
vival phenotype (‘STS’ versus ‘LTS’) treating the 12 proteins as the
covariates, and then call the linear prediction value, based on the
estimated coefficients, as the single score for a patient. Each patient
is reclassified into two subgroups (called ‘long—term survivors’ versus
‘short—term survivors’) based on their calculated scores by using 0.5
as the cutoff. We display the Kaplan—Meier curves of the two sub—
groups based on the patients’ original survival data in Figure 5,

which clearly shows the distinctive survival curves between the two
subgroups (P—value:0.045). This result suggests that the 12 pro—
teins selected by SIFORM can potentially be considered as prognos—
tic biomarkers for lung adenocarcinoma.

Furthermore, we evaluated the prediction performance of all the
methods via leave—one—out cross—validation. The misclassification
rates of SIFORM, SCAD, Lasso, adaLasso, mCCA and pCollRe
are, respectively, 0.322, 0.369, 0.631, 0.560, 0.417 and 0.607.
SIFORM again outperforms all the others in terms of prediction ac—
curacy for the survival phenotype.

5 Discussion

We have proposed a generalized statistical framework SIFORM to
jointly model high—throughput omic data produced by multiple plat—
forms and to discover associations between these genetic variables
and a disease—associated phenotype. The new method conveniently
produces direct rankings of genetic variables in terms of the strength
of association with the response variable. Extensive simulation stud—
ies demonstrated the superior performance of SIFORM in terms of
biomarker detection accuracy, regardless of inter—variable correl—
ations, compared to the performances of other penalized variable se—
lection methods. Biological meaningfulness of the proposed method
is supported by two TCGA lung adenocarcinoma studies that inves—
tigate the association of the integrated mRNA expression and RPPA
protein concentration data and two phenotypes, smoking status and
discretized survival. In particular, we discovered that most of the
identified proteins either belong to known key pathways for NSCLC
tumorigenesis or are prognostic biomarkers in NSCLC. We also dis—
covered some proteins that are potentially associated with the differ—
ent ways in which NSCLC develops in smokers versus non—smokers.

The proposed framework appears to fit the lung cancer data rea—
sonably well. However, a more comprehensive version of this frame-
work can be developed to improve the goodness of fit of the model
if appropriate. A possible solution is to include a nonparametric
mean component, for example, with the structure of singular value
decomposition, and use model selection methods (e.g. BIC) to deter—
mine the rank of the additional component. This idea requires exten—
sive investigation and, therefore, is deferred to our future research.
Another ongoing research project is to modify SIFORM by incorpo—
rating the prior biological pathway information to improve bio—
marker detection accuracy. Specifically, further regularization of the
parameters, for example, a graphic model based penalization
method (Kim et al., 2013), will be investigated.

ABSTRACT

The identification of orthologs—genes pairs descended from a
common ancestor through speciation, rather than duplication—
has emerged as an essential component of many bioinformatics
applications, ranging from the annotation of new genomes
to experimental target prioritization. Yet, the development and
application of orthology inference methods is hampered by the lack
of consensus on source proteomes, file formats and benchmarks.
The second ‘Quest for Orthologs’ meeting brought together
stakeholders from various communities to address these challenges.
We report on achievements and outcomes of this meeting, focusing
on topics of particular relevance to the research community at large.
The Quest for Orthologs consortium is an open community that
welcomes contributions from all researchers interested in orthology
research and applications.

1 INTRODUCTION

The concepts of orthology and paralogy are central to comparative
genomics. These terms were coined more than four decades
ago (Fitch, 1970) to distinguish between two classes of gene
homology: those descended from a common ancestor by virtue of
a speciation event (orthologs) versus those that diverged by gene
duplication (paralogs). This distinction permits accurate description
of the complex evolutionary relationships within gene families
including members distributed across multiple species. Detection
of orthology and paralogy has become an essential component of
diverse applications, including the reconstruction of evolutionary
relationships across species (reviewed in Delsuc et al., 2005),
inference of functional gene properties (e. g. Chen and J eong, 2000;
Hofmann, 1998; Tatusov et al., 1997), and identiﬁcation and testing
of proposed mechanisms of genome evolution (e. g. Mushegian and
Koonin, 1996; Tatusov et al., 1997). In today’s context, with the
number of fully sequenced genomes growing by the day, accurate

and efﬁcient inference of orthology has become an imperative.
A plethora of computational methods have been developed for
inferring orthologous relationships, many of which provide their
predictions in form of web-accessible databases (reviewed in
Alexeyenko et al., 2006; Gabaldén, 2008; Koonin, 2005; Kristensen
et al., 2011).

In 2009, the ﬁrst Quest for Orthologs meeting was organized
to bring together scientists working in the ﬁelds of orthology
inference, genome annotation and genome evolution to exchange
ideas, tackle common challenges, aiming at removing barriers and
redundancy (Gabaldon et al., 2009). The main objectives identiﬁed
were concerted effort toward standardized formats, datasets and
benchmarks, and establishment of continuous communication
channels including a mailing list, a website and a regular meeting.

Following the ﬁrst Quest for Ortholog meeting in 2009,
a second meeting was held in June 2011, bringing together
45 participants from 27 different institutions on 3 continents,
representing >20 orthology databases (http://questfororthologs.
org/orthology_databases). The meeting was structured to include
plenary sessions devoted to topics of general interest (reference
datasets, orthology detection methodology, practical applications of
orthology), and additional discussions focusing on benchmarking,
standardized formats, alternative transcripts, ncRNA orthology, etc.
In this letter, we summarize the discussions and speciﬁc outcomes
of the meeting, as well as some of the most important achievements
of the Quest for Orthologs community in the past 2 years.

2 DEFINITIONS AND EVOLUTIONARY MODELS

Orthology ﬁnds application in multiple, diverse research areas.
Depending on the context, the reasons for identifying orthologous
genes can vary considerably, sometimes driving the use of subtly
differing deﬁnitions of orthology and its extension to groups of
genes. Brigitte Boeckmann (Swiss Inst Bioinformatics, Geneva,
Switzerland) and Christophe Dessimoz (ETH Zﬁrich, Switzerland)
reviewed the deﬁnitions and objectives of orthologous groups
within a unifying framework and discussed the implications of
these differences for the interpretation and benchmarking of
ortholog databases (Boeckmann et al., 2011). The need for clear
evolutionary deﬁnitions is particularly acute for multidomain
proteins, as their underlying coding sequences often have distinct,
and even conﬂicting, evolutionary histories. In an attempt to salvage

Quest for orthologs 2

 

the gene as the fundamental evolutionary unit, Dannie Durand
(Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, USA) proposed a model
of gene homology based on the genomic locus, not the constitutive
nucleotides of the gene (Song et al., 2008).

3 DEBATING THE ‘ORTHOLOG CONJECTURE’

The ‘ortholog conjecture’—that at a similar degree of sequence
divergence, orthologs are generally more conserved in function
than paralogs—has been a prevailing paradigm, originally supported
by theory rather than empirical studies. At the previous
Quest for Orthologs meeting, Bill Pearson (University Virginia,
Charlottesville, USA) questioned the ortholog conjecture and
contended that the sequence similarity be the primary determinant
of functional conservation (Gabaldon et al., 2009). Several studies
have now been undertaken to compare the properties of orthologs
versus paralogs, and generally appear to support the importance of
distinguishing orthologs from paralogs.

Erik Sonnhammer (Stockholm University, Sweden) reported
signiﬁcant support for the ortholog conjecture based on conserved
domain architecture (Forslund et al., 2011) and intron positions
(Henricson et al., 2010). David Roos (University of Pennsylvania,
Philadelphia, USA) showed that protein structure is signiﬁcantly
more conserved for orthologs than for paralogs, particularly within
protein active sites. Indeed, it is even possible to quantify the
importance of orthology, in terms of sequence conservation or
RMSD, for structural modeling (Peterson et al., 2009). Toni
Gabaldén (Center for Genomic Regulation, Barcelona, Spain)
and colleagues found that human—mouse orthologs exhibit more
conserved tissue expression than paralogs of a similar age (Huerta-
Cepas et al., 2011). Similarly, Klaas Vandepoele (Ghent University,
Belgium) reported that for 77% of orthologs between Arabidopsis
and rice, the expression patterns were more highly conserved than
the background distribution, and that expression patterns can also
be used to tease out functional similarity even among in—paralogs
(Movahedi et al., 2011).

In other tests, however, orthologs were not found to be
functionally more conserved than paralogs. Just days before the
meeting, Nehrt et al. (2011) reported that Gene Ontology (GO)
functional annotations (du Plessis et al., 2011) may be less
similar among orthologs than among paralogs, and that human—
mouse co-expression data across tissues argues against the ortholog
conjecture. Discussion at the meeting noted an inherent bias
favoring conservation between homologs in the same species, which
may inﬂate the scores of paralogs. Furthermore, using correlation
coefﬁcients as a measure of gene expression conservation may
also cause problems (Pereira et al., 2009). Overall, this discussion
suggests that the debate remains far from being settled.

4 INNOVATIONS IN ORTHOLOGY INFERENCE:
INCREMENTAL METHODS AND
META-METHODS

Much of the meeting focused on innovations in orthology inference.
One trend involves the application of incremental methods,
minimizing the need to recompute results as new datasets are added.
lkuo Uchiyama (National Institute for Basic Biology, Okazaki,
Japan) described how the Microbial Genome Database (MBGD)
uses such an approach to cope with new genomes, and also

to identify orthologs in metagenomic samples (Uchiyama et al.,
2010). Likewise, the most recent release of the OrthoMCL database
permits new genes (and even entire genomes) to be assigned to
putative ortholog groups (Chen et al., 2006). Ingo Ebersberger
(CIBIV, Vienna, Austria) showed how an incremental approach
based on hidden Markov models can be used to identify orthologs
in EST libraries, which typically only cover a fraction of all genes
(Ebersberger et al., 2009), and Radek Szklarczyk (2012) introduced
a new proﬁle-based iterative procedures that pushes the boundaries
of reliable homology detection and helps identify disease genes in
human.

Another trend involves the application of meta-methods to
integrate predictions from multiple datasets, combining their
strengths so as to outperform any single underlying method.
Michiel Van Bel (Ghent University, Belgium) presented an ensemble
method intended to detect orthologs in plant species combining
different orthology inference methods—a notorious challenge due
to extensive whole genome duplication and paleopolyploidy. This
concept lies at the heart of the PLAZA database (Proost et al.,
2009). Michael S. Livstone (Princeton University, USA) described
how the P-POD database (Heinicke et al., 2007) enables users
to compare orthology and paralogy predictions from multiple
homology inference methods on 12 reference genomes from the
Gene Ontology Consortium (Reference Genome Group of the Gene
Ontology Consortium, 2009). With MetaPhOrs, Gabaldén showed
that combining the orthologs inferred from several large-scale
phylogenetic resources is not only meaningful to increase the total
number of predictions, but also to assess the accuracy based on the
consistency across different sources (Pryszcz et al., 2011).

5 STANDARDS AND BENCHMARKING

Aprimary motivation for this meeting has been to establish standards
for efﬁcient data exchange in the orthology community. Until now,
virtually every ortholog database has used a different format, posing
a major impediment for consumers of orthology data, including
annotators and for comparative genomicists. Likewise, the source
data for orthology analysis (proteomes) has used a variety of
formats (mostly ad hoc variations of the Fasta format). To resolve
these issues, a working group has developed XML-based formats
for both sequence and orthology data (OrthoXML and SeqXML,
respectively) (Schmitt et al., 2011). These formats were endorsed
by meeting participants, representing many orthology databases,
and by the reference proteome project. Documentation and tools
are available at http://OrthoXML.org and http://SeqXML.org.
Following on from suggestions at the previous meeting, the Quest
for Orthologs ‘Reference Proteomes’ serves as a common dataset
to compare orthology inference methods. Eleanor Stanley (EBI,
Hinxton, UK) gave an overview of UniProt’s commitment to curate
this dataset. Meeting participants suggested that an annual release
schedule would be appropriate, and should ensure that most methods
are applied to a common and reasonably current dataset. Although
driven by the need to benchmark ortholog detection algorithms
against a common dataset, we anticipate that the reference proteome
project will be useful beyond the orthology prediction community.
For example, UniProt curators are eager to test how different
ortholog predictions against a consistent dataset can be used to
facilitate protein annotation. Complementing the reference proteome
project, Raj a Mazumder (Georgetown University, Washington,

C.Dessimoz et al.

 

USA) presented an automated approach to identify representative
proteomes—relatively small subsets of all proteomes that capture
most of the information available (Chen et al., 2011).

The availability of standardized datasets should signiﬁcantly
ease the challenge of sourcing genomes faced by all providers of
ortholog detection, and holds great promise for orthology inference
benchmarking. Indeed, previous benchmarking studies have been
forced to evaluate orthology predictions based on inconsistent
datasets (Altenhoff and Dessimoz, 2009; Boeckmann et al., 2011;
Hulsen et al., 2006; Trachana et al., 2011), or have been limited to
comparatively small datasets analyzed only by methods available
as stand-alone programs (Chen et al., 2007; Salichos and Rokas,
2011). Leveraging the Reference Proteomes, Adrian Altenhoff
(ETH, Zﬁrich, Switzerland) presented a web server prototype for
orthology benchmarking. The service gathers predictions submitted
by ortholog providers and runs a battery of tests, such as an
assessment of how well the predictions satisfy a standard deﬁnition
of orthology (Fitch, 1970), and a test assessing accuracy in predicting
GO function annotations (du Plessis et al., 2011).

6 FUNCTIONAL PREDICTIONS

One of the chief beneﬁts of ortholog group assignment is the
potential for inferring putative function—particularly as new
sequencing methodologies make it increasingly possible to assemble
genomes and deﬁne genes from species where experimental data is
lacking. Such computational inference can be risky, however, as
the accuracy of existing annotations is often unknown, particularly
for electronically assigned annotations, leading to rampant in silico
propagation of errors (Gilks et al., 2002). Paul Thomas (USC,
Los Angeles, USA) outlined activities of the Gene Ontology (GO)
Reference Genomes Project (Reference Genome Group of the
Gene Ontology Consortium, 2009), and described a pilot project
assigning GO terms to internal nodes of a reference tree (Gaudet
et al., 2011). Incorporating a concept of evolutionary breadth (and
conﬁdence) into the annotation process would greatly enhance
the speciﬁcity of orthology-based inference. Nives Skunca (ETH,
Zﬁrich, Switzerland) reported an innovative effort to estimate
the quality of electronic GO annotations, by tracking changes in
stability, coverage and speciﬁcity over time. This study suggests
a strategy for identifying high conﬁdence electronic annotations
that can be relied upon for transitive inference. The availability
of a web-based platform for comparing the performance of
orthology detection methods (see above) should greatly facilitate
the assessment of functional prediction performance. In addition,
the development of a curated catalog of ortholog genes with similar
function, using experimental data, such as RNAi, expression data or
mutant phenotype, would be a useful resource and could improve
functional prediction.

7 ADDITIONAL TOPICS

Homology prediction based on similarity is a prerequisite for
many orthology prediction methods, and a workshop was held to
discuss current approaches and upcoming challenges in assessing
sequence similarity. Much discussion was devoted to the need
for more realistic models of sequence evolution, which would
enable the proper assessment of what level of similarity is expected
for two evolutionary related sequences. Tina Koestler (CIBIV,

Vienna, Austria) and Jean-Baka Domelevo (LIRMM, Montpellier,
France) presented proﬁle-based models of evolution, taking into
account particularities of functional or structural regions of protein
sequences. Further discussions stressed the necessity of elucidating
the mode of evolution of multidomain proteins, particularly in
the context of domain rearrangements. In a different take on
homology inference, Vincent Miele (LBBE, Lyon, France) reported
new methodology to identify robust homologous groups from the
structure of similarity networks.

Orthology inference has been traditionally focused on the study
of protein coding genes, but there is increasing interest in applying
similar analyses to non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). For example,
both Ensembl (Flicek et al., 2011) and miROrtho (Gerlach et al.,
2009) have started to provide orthology predictions for a subset of
ncRNAs, largely based on synteny. Most of the discussion centered
on the difﬁculties in use of phylogenetic methods for the analysis of
ncRNAs: phylogenetic models used for protein coding genes usually
assume that sites evolve independently, but ncRNAs often violate
this assumption, owing to the importance of secondary structure
conservation. Several models speciﬁcally developed for RNA
sequences have been implemented in phylogenetic packages [e.g.
PHASE (Gowri—Shankar and Rattray, 2007) or RAxML (Stamatakis,
2006)], but these models are not widely known. Other limitations
hindering phylogenetic study of ncRNAs, include the difﬁculty in
reliably detecting these genes. The RFam database (Gardner et al.,
2011) contains a high-quality set of ncRNA families, but its scope
is limited to families for which an expert multiple alignment is
available. A central repository for RNA sequences has been recently
proposed (Bateman et al., 2011) and we see this as important for
boosting interest and helping to drive evolutionary studies on RNA
sequences.

8 ACHIEVEMENTS AND OUTLOOK

The disparate but interconnected communities represented at this
meeting have taken an important step toward better understanding
one another. Inferring orthology is a non-trivial task, for
many reasons. There are certainly signiﬁcant computational and
algorithmic challenges, but at a more basic level, differing
applications driving the quest for orthologs has led to differing
deﬁnitions of orthology (particularly with respect to subcategories,
such as in-paralogs or co-orthologs), the use of different source
datasets and different metrics for evaluating performance. The most
important achievement to emerge from the Quest for Orthologs effort
thus far is a series of consensus agreements, on:

0 reference proteome datasets, including a minimal set
suggested for benchmarking ortholog detection algorithms,
and a larger set, greatly facilitating data sourcing;

0 data exchange formats, including OrthoXML and SeqXML;
and

0 an analysis platform providing for comparison of developer-
supplied ortholog calls using diverse metrics (include metrics
supplied by users and developers).

The many different uses of orthology detection ensure that there
will continue to be a multitude of useful algorithms. Some will
be optimized for computational efﬁciency and/or scalability. Some

Quest for orthologs 2

 

will focus on speciﬁc phylogenetic groups, which may be highly
homogenous or relatively diverse, may or may not exhibit synteny
and may include introns or operons, etc. Still other methods will
be tailored to handle multidomain proteins, alternative transcription
units, metagenomics data, etc. (Dessimoz, 2011).

The availability of reference datasets permits all groups to use
the same proteomes, while also minimizing the effort to source
the raw data. The OrthoXML format allows predictions to be
exchanged efﬁciently, and the benchmarking platform permits
consistent assessment of the results. One of the highlights of the
June 2011 meeting was the discussion of orthology prediction
methods—a discussion that could only take place because different
algorithms were applied to the same source data. Proposed
benchmarks are publicly accessible from the Quest for Orthologs
portal (http://questfororthologs.org), in order to encourage other
researchers to use this platform.

It will be exciting to see the progress of Quest for Orthologs
initiatives over the coming years—the next meeting is tentatively
scheduled for 2013. In the meantime, the reference proteomes
will be updated and enlarged to sample taxonomic space, and the
benchmarking service will be made publicly available. We invite all
interested parties to join the orthology community, using the contacts
available at the aforementioned Quest for Orthologs portal.

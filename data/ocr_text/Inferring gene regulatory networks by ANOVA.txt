ABSTRACT

Motivation: To improve the understanding of molecular regulation
events, various approaches have been developed for deducing gene
regulatory networks from mRNA expression data.

Results: We present a new score for network inference, 7,2, that
is derived from an analysis of variance. Candidate transcription
factor:target gene (T F:TG) relationships are assumed more likely if the
expression of TF and TG are mutually dependent in at least a subset
of the examined experiments. We evaluate this dependency by 712, a
non-parametric, non-linear correlation coefficient. It is fast, easy to
apply and does not require the discretization of the input data. In the
recent DREAMS blind assessment, the arguably most comprehensive
evaluation of inference methods, our approach based on n2 was rated
the best performer on real expression compendia. It also performs
better than methods tested in other recently published comparative
assessments. About half of our predicted novel predictions are true
interactions as estimated from qPCR experiments performed for
DREAMS.

Conclusions: The score 712 has a number of interesting features
that enable the efficient detection of gene regulatory interactions.
For most experimental setups, it is an interesting alternative to other
measures of dependency such as Pearson’s correlation or mutual
information.

1 INTRODUCTION

The reconstruction of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from
expression data can help to improve our understanding of molecular
regulation events. A variety of algorithms have been devised to
predict gene regulatory interactions, frequently based on mutual
dependencies between the expression of regulators and their targets
(see related work).

We propose to evaluate transcription factor:target gene (TFzTG)
interactions by the measure 772 [Cohen (1973)], a non—linear
correlation coefﬁcient derived from an analysis of variance
(ANOVA). Although 772 has a number of interesting features it
has, to our knowledge, not been applied to network inference or
to bioinformatics in general.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

A high proportion of our predicted novel interactions were
conﬁrmed by small—scale qPCR experiments performed by the
DREAMS organizers. In addition, our approach was evaluated
as the best performer for the inference of real datasets in the
recent DREAMS blind assessment [http://wiki.c2b2.columbia.edu/
dream/index.php; Marbach et al. (2010); Prill et al. (2010)]. Here,
29 participating teams applied a diverse set of inference methods to
a variety of large real (Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae)
and artiﬁcial expression compendia with thousands of genes from
several hundreds of microarray measurements. The microarray
experiments consisted of various gene, drug or environmental
perturbations that were in some cases carried out as time courses.

After a brief summary of related work we describe the GRN
inference setting, introduce our inference approach based on the
score 772 and evaluate its properties and performance.

1.1 Related work

The inference of large GRNs of 500+ nodes is frequently tackled
by unsupervised, data—driven approaches that aim to resolve
dependencies from expression data alone. We brieﬂy review some
commonly used techniques in the following and refer the reader
to review papers [e.g. by Altay and Emmert—Streib (2010b), Lee
and Tzou (2009) and Markowetz and Spang (2007)] for a more
comprehensive overview of methods.

Unparameterized topologies can be approximated even for large
networks by measures of pairwise gene dependencies, e. g. using
Pearson’s linear correlation coefﬁcient [Butte and Kohane (1999)].
To take non—linear correlations into account, information theoretic
approaches can be employed such as Bayes conditional probability
tables or mutual information [Butte and Kohane (2000); Ding and
Peng (2005); Faith et al. (2007); Margolin et al. (2006); Meyer
et al. (2007); Zhao et al. (2006)]. The latter techniques require a
very careful discretization of the expression data to avoid the loss
of signal [Altay and Emmert—Streib (2010a); Mukherjee and Speed
(2008); Zhu et al. (2008)].

One source of false positive predictions are indirect effects,
i.e. in a cascade A—>B—>C methods are likely to also predict
the additional effect A—> C. Extensions like the data processing
inequality [ARACNe, Margolin et al. (2006)] and gene dependent
background distributions [CLR, Faith et al. (2007)] have been
proposed to overcome this problem. The minimum redundancy
maximum relevance concept [Ding and Peng (2005); Meyer et al.
(2007)] offers another way to select important edges. Indirect effects
might also be identiﬁed and removed by partial correlations [Castelo
and Roverato (2009)], elastic net or lasso, a Ll—penalized estimation
of the inverse covariance matrix [Friedman et al. (2008); Kabir
et al. (2010); Wang et al. (2009)]. All of the mentioned approaches
measure global dependencies, i.e. dependencies that are visible

across the majority of measured experimental conditions. Local
dependencies that are only apparent in a subset of the conditions
[Kwon et al. (2003)] might thus be missed.

Models like Boolean, (probabilistic) Bayesian networks, ordinary
differential equations (ODE) or Petri Nets are generative i.e. they
allow the generation of the original training datasets by simulation.
Optimization approaches minimize the deviation from given data
by parameterizing models [Guthke et al. (2005); Kuffner et al.
(2010); Wang et al. (2006)]. Due to the huge parameter space these
algorithms may not scale well to large networks.

The assessment of the multitude of reconstruction algorithms is
quite difﬁcult. Comparative studies [Hache et al. (2009); Michoel
et al. (2009); Narendra et al. (2011); Soranzo et al. (2007);
Zou and Feng (2009)] evaluate only subsets of approaches. More
comprehensive assessments are facilitated through community—wide
challenges conducted by the DREAM consortium.

2 METHODS

2.1 Inference setting, data sources and evaluation

Problem statement and evaluation. GRN inference aims at the detection
of gene regulatory relationships from mRNA expression datasets. The
task is to reverse engineer the directed topology of one network for
each of the available expression datasets (Table 1). In the following, we
describe a setup for the evaluation of inference methods that has been
adopted by many comparative assessment studies including DREAMS
(http://wiki.c2b2.columbia.edu/dream/index.php/DSc4) and Narendra et al.
(2011).

For each dataset, potential TFs are given. Only these TFs should be
included as regulators in the network predictions as the used gold standards
do not contain gene regulatory interactions for other regulators such as sigma
factors or miRNAs. The list of TFs was available to all participants of the
challenge. Approaches were then required to check and rank |TF| >< |Genes|
candidate relationships. Lists of ranked candidate interactions are evaluated
against the true topology (in case of the artiﬁcial dataset) or against
experimentally determined TFzTG interactions. Candidate lists are evaluated
against gold standard networks (see below) based on the area under the
precision—recall curve (AUPR) and the area under the receiver—operator
characteristics curve [AUROC; see Prill et al. (2010)]. In DREAMS, only
the top 100 000 interactions were considered for this analysis. The resulting
AUPR and AUROC will be lower if only a subset of the interactions is
considered. Although this difference has only little effect on the ranking of
the approaches, we will report AUROC values for the top 100 000 predictions
as well as for all predictions in order to enable the comparison to other
studies [e.g. Narendra et al. (2011)]. The performance evaluation in this
article focuses on the AUROC, but additional evaluation and scores can be
found in the Supplementary Material (part 4).

Shown is the size of the examined datasets as well as the number of measurements
subject to gene speciﬁc perturbations (gene over-expressions and deletions).

Expression compendia. In this study, we used three datasets provided by
DREAMS and two additional datasets from M3D [Faith et al. (2008)]. All
datasets consisted of several thousand genes and several hundred microarray
measurements (Table 1). In comparison to data repositories such as GEO
[Barrett et al. (2010)], DREAMS and M3D provide fewer but uniformly
preprocessed and normalized datasets. Measurements as well as annotations
are rendered comparable across different experiments and are thus suited to
automated network inference.

In case of the real DREAMS datasets, organism, experiment and gene
names are replaced by random IDs to enable the evaluation of the inferred
networks against experimentally conﬁrmed interactions unknown to the
participants. Thus, no prior knowledge could be utilized for the inference.

Datasets in the expression compendia are subdivided into experiments
that consist of all microarrays described in a single publication or conducted
by the same experimenter. Besides wild—type measurements, experimental
conditions represent (combinations of) drug, environmental and gene
perturbations. Some of the drug or environmental perturbations are provided
as time course measurements. We considered each time point as a separate
condition. A condition may contain multiple replicates. In case of gene
perturbations (deletion or over—expression), the annotations provide the IDs
of the perturbed genes. The artiﬁcial dataset was generated by the tool
GeneNetWeaver [Marbach et al. (2009), see Section 6 of the challenge
description at http://wiki.c2b2.columbia.edu/dream/index.php/DSC4] and
mimicked the E. coli dataset in the composition of the perturbations and
time courses.

For additional validation, we obtained E. coli and S. cerevisiae expression
data from the M3D database [see Table 1 and Faith et al. (2008)]. Similar to
the chip annotations provided in DREAMS, M3D provided manually curated
metadata for their chip measurements.

Gold standard networks. Predicted E. coli interactions were validated
based on RegulonDB [Gama—Castro et al. (2011); Huerta et al. (1998)],
a database of gene regulatory relationships that are both experimentally
validated and manually curated. The S. cerevisiae gold standard [MacIsaac
et al. (2006)] was automatically derived by large—scale chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) binding assays. Physical binding is not a
sufﬁcient evidence, as noted by Hu et al. (2007) and Boulesteix and Strimmer
(2005). Thus, ChIP will lead to many false positive interactions. MacIsaac
et al. (2006) aimed to overcome this problem by complementing ChIP assays
with conservation—based motif discovery algorithms. Due to the more reliable
small—scale assays and the manual curation, the E. coli gold standard should
be regarded as more reliable than the one for S. cerevisiae. This is supported
by a recent review by Narendra et al. (2011) where even otherwise accurate
methods fail to predict this gold standard. The true network topology is
known for the artiﬁcial dataset and was used for evaluation.

Combined with the above mentioned M3D datasets, these gold standard
networks have been used for evaluating inference methods by DREAMS as
well as Faith et al. (2007) and Narendra et al. (2011). Because the same
gold standards are used and because the majority of the experiments in the
DREAMS datasets on E. coli were taken from the M3D database (Daniel
Marbach, personal communication) results of DREAMS and Narendra et al.
(2011) are approximately comparable. This also applies to assessments based
on artiﬁcial datasets that have been generated by the tool GeneNetWeaver
[Marbach et al. (2009)] in both studies.

2.2 Network inference

Fold changes. Basal gene levels can be very different between experiments.
To compensate for this, we transformed the absolute expression values into
expression fold changes (see also Supplementary Material, part 1). Fold
changes are computed by mapping the measurements mi,i=1...|m| of each
condition m onto one or more valid control conditions (Fig. 1). Each m is
subject to a combination of gene, drug or environmental perturbations P.
A condition mC measured at time t(mc) under the set of perturbations PC
is called a valid control condition for m if PC CP and t(m)=t(mc), where
P —PC represents the differential treatment between two conditions.

Fig. 1. Transformation of absolute expression values into fold changes.
We compute log—fold changes by mapping each measured condition m to
one or more control conditions (replicated measurements) from the same
experiment. A control may have fewer drug or gene perturbations than the
corresponding measurements, but not more. In the example shown, both
conditions a and b have fewer perturbations than m and are valid control
conditions. Then, the replicates of the controls are averaged and (here: a total
of 6) fold changes are computed for the replicates in m against the means
of the selected controls. Log—fold changes are computed as differences as
measurements are already log—transformed. For the given application, the
resulting geometric mean performs similar to an average (not shown).

For instance, the DREAMS E. coli dataset consisted of 805 chip
measurements of 487 different experimental conditions. Among the 805
chips we selected controls for 599 chips (corresponding to 379 conditions).
Due to the multiplicity of measurement—control combinations, 935—fold
changes were computed from the 599 chips.

Relevance networks. Our network inference approach is based on the
estimation of the relevance of candidate interactions [Butte and Kohane
(1999); Butte and Kohane (2000)]. Candidate interactions, i.e. pairs of a
TF and a TG, are ranked by a score s. The score s can be any measure of
dependency between the expression of the TF and its TG. Frequently used
measures of dependency are based on Pearson’s or Spearman’s correlation
coefﬁcients or mutual information. In this article, we propose to use the
score 712 that is introduced below. The application of n2 in the relevance
network framework will be referred to as the 712 approach. In addition
to relevance networks, we also evaluate if in the context of the C3NET
[Altay and Emmert—Streib (2010a)] and CLR [Faith et al. (2007)] frameworks
(Supplementary Material, part4).

A measure of association derived from two-way ANOVA. Our inference
approach is based on a two—way ANOVA. A two—way ANOVA can be used
to model experimental observations Yijk as responses to two factors C and
G as well as the measurement error,

Yijk=M+Ti+ﬁj+Vij+€ijk (1)

where [L is the average response, I,- is the effect from the i—th level of the
factor C, 61- is the effect from the j—th level of factor G, yij is the joint
effect from the interaction between factors C and G and eijk represents the
remaining unexplained error in replicate k. In our application of ANOVA,
C models the effect of differential expression across ie [1...c] different
experimental conditions and G models whether the expression proﬁles of
the genes j e [g, t] (as we consider exactly one TF t and one TG g) differ.
Thus, we apply ANOVA to a matrix of conditions, genes and replicates as
depicted in Figure 2A. A two—way ANOVA tests three null hypotheses: (i) no
differences in means of factor C; (ii) no differences in means of factor G;
and (iii) no interaction between C and G, by partitioning the total sum of
squares SST into four components (Fig. 2):

SST=SSC+SSG+SSCG+SSeH (2)

A sum of squares (SS) is a sum of squared deviations from a mean
[Miller (1997)] and can be regarded as an unadjusted measure of dispersion.

Fig. 2. Sum of squares and the two—way ANOVA. A two—way ANOVA
analyzes two dimensions or effects (here: C for conditions and G for genes)
by partitioning the SS into four components: SST=SSC+SSG+SSCG+
SSel—r. The ﬁrst example (panel B) exhibits strong associations between TF
and TG. Here, SSC is high as there is strong differential expression between
the conditions. In panel C, the genes exhibit strong differences so SSG will
be high. If the two effects are linked (panel D), i.e. differential expression
across conditions occurs only if strong differences are exhibited between
both genes, SSCG will be high. A high replicate variance leads to a high
SSerr (panel E).

A variance Vx is computed by adjusting the SS), for the degree of freedom
dfx, where dfx is the number of data points under consideration minus 1,
and x6 [C, G, CG, err, T]. An F —value is computed by weighting the effect
variance against the error variance [Equation (3)]. F —values follow the
F —statistic, which can be used to derive the statistical signiﬁcance of the
involved factors as p—values. For instance, to estimate the signiﬁcance of
differential expression across conditions we compute F C by:

x VC
VxZEaFCZVeH (3)
Effects so far describe differences, but ANOVA can also be used to detect
speciﬁc similarities or associations between TF and TG. Phrased in terms of
the two—way ANOVA, the strength of an association is proportional to the
fraction of SSC in the total sum of squares SST:

SSC VC
_ a[777+ = _
SST VT

Thus, iii 6 [0...1] measures association as the fraction of the total
variance that is explained by the differential expression across experimental
conditions. Cohen (1973) refers to 7,1 as the non—parametric non—linear
correlation coefﬁcient. Its statistical signiﬁcance can be estimated via F n+.
A more detailed description of the algorithm including pseudo code can be
found in the Supplementary Material (parts 2 and 3).

Adjusting for negative correlation. In contrast to Pearson’s pz, 712 does not
directly test for negative correlations. We therefore propose to reverse the
signs of the TF—fold changes to compute an additional 713. The ﬁnal ranking
of candidate interactions is performed using 712 =max(ni, n3).

GRN Inference

 

Incorporation of gene perturbation experiments. We extend the basic
approach to incorporate measurements on gene speciﬁc perturbations.
A candidate interaction between a TF and a putative TG should be considered
more likely if the TG shows a response to the knock—out or over—expression
of the TF. In the calculation of n2 for such an interaction this is taken
into account by increasing the weight of conditions that involve gene
perturbations affecting the TF by a user speciﬁed weight parameter wgp.
Values may range between 10 and 1000 (see Supplementary Material, part 4)
and have been estimated based on M3D data [Faith et al. (2008)] prior to
our participation in DREAM. The weight of such a condition is increased
by inserting wgp—l additional copies into the ANOVA matrix (Fig. 2A).
Conditions where non—TFs or TFs other than the currently tested TF are
perturbed receive the default weight of 1.

3 RESULTS

Diﬁ‘erences between datasets. Prokaryotes organize the regulation
of expression by operons. A promotor region controls several
structural genes which show similar expression patterns. We
analyzed expression patterns by Markov clustering [mcl; Enright
et al. (2002)]. Figure 3 shows the resulting expression patterns from
the largest clusters of the E. coli and the artiﬁcial data. Co—regulation
patterns are easy to detect in all real datasets but are virtually absent
in the artiﬁcial data. We also noticed that ~50% of the regulation
in the artiﬁcial data is due to inhibition. Inhibition, i.e. negative
correlations between TF and TG is comparatively rare in the real
datasets (Fig. 4). Real networks are more complex than the artiﬁcial
networks created by Marbach et al. (2009) as they do not account
for interactions involving proteins or other molecules.

The real E. coli and S. cerevisiae datasets were also markedly
different. While correlation between TF and TG is a good predictor
of a gene regulatory relationship in artiﬁcial and E. coli data, this
is not the case in S. cerevisiae (Fig. 4). This ﬁnding is reproducible
across different yeast datasets, gold standards and measures of
dependency (not shown). That network inference is more difﬁcult
in S .cerevisiae as compared with E. coli is consistent with the work
of Hu et al. (2007) and Narendra et al. (2011).

Run time complexity. The run time complexity of our
network inference approach is 0(|TF | X |genes| >< |chips|) (see
Supplementary Material, part 3), i.e. the complexity of the ANOVA
estimator is linear in the number of chips. The datasets (Table 1)
required between 280 k and 2 M evaluations of 772 across 160 to 907
chips. The largest datasets required a run time of 2 min on a single
processor core. The complexity of other inference approaches has
been discussed previously [Narendra et al. (2011)].

Performance evaluation. Table 2 and Figure 5 show the
performance of our 772 method in comparison to other approaches.
For a broad comparison of methods we combined our own evaluation
results for some of the publicly available methods (for additional
evaluation and scores see Supplementary Material, part 4) with the
results of the DREAMS network inference challenge as well as
the large comparative assessment study of Narendra et al. (2011).
We selected methods that performed best on one of the three
DREAMS datasets (methods 1—3) and the best performing methods
(with respect to AUROC) as determined by Narendra et al. (2011)
(methods 6—9). For comparison, we also applied the methods 2 as
well as 5—7 as end—user ready tools were available.

Fig. 3. Co—regulation patterns in artiﬁcial and real datasets. In contrast to the
artiﬁcial data (panel A), all real datasets (panel B) show strong co—regulation
patterns. In E. coli, clustered patterns largely overlap with operons. Shown
are subsets of 20 genes selected from the largest clusters derived by Markov
clustering.

In order to render the DREAM evaluation (that considered
only the top 100 k predictions) comparable to the evaluation by
Narendra et al. (2011), we re—computed the performance based on
all predictions (i.e. not only the top 100 k) and re—applied publicly
available methods. Considering all predictions usually increases the
resulting AUROC by up to a few percentage points, which usually
has only little effect on the performance ranking of the methods.

Interestingly, some of the participants in the DREAMS challenge
outperformed existing inference methods signiﬁcantly, particularly
in case of the artiﬁcial and E. coli datasets (Fig. 5). For the inference
of yeast interactions such a clear statement was not possible as all
methods performed rather poorly.

The presented 772 method was the best performer for inferring
E. col i interactions and was also competitive for the artiﬁcial dataset,
outperforming the previously published methods analyzed in this
article or by Narendra et al. (2011). The performance on artiﬁcial
and E. coli interactions is depicted in Figure 5 for all methods that
participated in the DREAMS network inference challenge.

The prediction performance apparently also depends on the
number of chip experiments. All methods yielded a better prediction
performance for the M3D E. coli dataset (Table 2), which contains
more measurements than the DREAMS E. coli dataset. The same
reasons also contribute to the lower performance observed in the
S. cerevisiae dataset.

Properties of 772 exempliﬁed via selected interactions. We analyzed
properties of 772 on the E. coli dataset from M3D. A strong linear
correlation is exhibited for instance by the ﬁszdusB interaction (ﬁs:
organization and maintenance of nucleoid structure; dusB: tRNA-
dihydrouridine synthase B, Fig. 6A). The observed linear correlation
might be due to the fact that both genes are part of the same operon.
Non—linear correlations such as gadEzhdeA are also detected by 772
(gadE: acid-induced positive regulator of glutamate-dependent acid
resistance; hdeA: stress response acid resistance protein). hdeA is
already activated by low gadE concentrations (Fig. 6B). In contrast,
mth (multidrug transporter component) is activated only at high
concentrations of gadX (regulator of acid resistance) resulting in an
upwardly—curved scatterplot (not shown).

772 also enables the detection of correlations that are only
apparent in a subset of the measured conditions, i.e. it detects
local correlations. This increased sensitivity is due to the

and from the paper of N arendra et al. (2011)? To render the DREAMS protocola’b (gray background, considering the top 100 k predictions only) comparable to other studies, the
performance on the DREAM datasets has been re-calculatedC with all predictions. Also, publicly available methods have been re-appliedCl to M3D datasets. Methods show similar
performance between the DREAMSC and M3Dd’e real (because of their large overlaps) as well as artiﬁcial datasets (because they were generated by the same tool, GeneNetWeaver).
The best predictions are shown in bold. See Supplementary Material (part 4) for additional scores. All methods were invoked with the designated options to utilize the preselected

effective utilization of the replicated measurements to quantify
the measurement error. The expression proﬁles of an interaction
between the multiple antibiotic resistance (mar, GeneOntology
GO:0046677—response to antibiotic) genes marA and marB are a
good example of a local correlation between TF and TG. While
Pearson’s p2 would argue against this edge, it is considered as
relevant by 772 (Fig. 6, panels C and E). The interaction between
marA and marB is active in E. coli treated with the antibiotic
norﬂoxacin (a gyrase inhibitor). The co—regulation across various
gene over—expression experiments in the presence of norﬂoxacin is
depicted in Figure 6E (left side). The treatment with other antibiotics
such as ampicillin and kanamycin also triggers the co—regulation of
the two mar genes (not shown). The interaction is not active in the
experiments on bioﬁlm formation and growth phases as marA and
marB exhibit virtually no co—regulation here (Fig. 6E, right side).

In vivo conﬁrmation of novel interactions. Novel candidate
interactions in E. coli were preselected by applying a 50% precision
cutoff to the predictions, i.e. we stop iterating over the list
of predictions from most to least conﬁdent when the precision
evaluated against RegulonDB drops <50%.

Predicted TF:TG interactions were tested by quantifying the
presence of the TG mRNA through qPCR ampliﬁcation in E. coli
gene knockouts of the corresponding TF. The mRNA levels for the
same TG were quantiﬁed in non—mutant, wild—type E. coli to measure
gene expression differences. Expression differences >2—fold for TGs
are considered evidence for a true regulatory relationship between
the predicted TF:TG pair.

In total, 5 TFs were sampled and 53 interactions not contained
in the gold standard were tested. Here, 21 TF:TG pairs showed
greater than a 2—fold change corresponding to a conﬁrmation rate
of 39.6%. Relaxing the fold change cutoff to 1.8, 26 pairs are
reported (precision of 49.1%). This approximately conﬁrms the 50%
precision cutoff from the computational analysis. At a precision
cutoff of 50% we predict 1995 novel interactions thus expecting
~1000 (1995 X 49.1% 2979) additional true interactions not
contained in RegulonDB. The qPCR experiments were performed
by the lab of James J. Collins at the Boston University in the context
of the DREAMS challenge. The full description and analysis of these
interactions as well as the participating inference approaches will be
the subject of a future paper (Marbach,D., Costello,J. and Kuffner,R.
et al., The wisdom of crowds for gene network inference, submitted).

GRN Inference

 

4 DISCUSSION

To infer gene regulatory networks (GRNs), we rank the relevance of
candidate relationships consisting of a TF and a TG by measuring
the dependency between their respective expression proﬁles.

For the detection of dependencies we proposed the measure
772 that is derived from an analysis of variance (ANOVA). To
our knowledge, 772 has not been applied to network inference or
to other problems in bioinformatics although it has a number of
interesting features (Fig. 6). Like Pearson’s p2, but in contrast
to Bayes conditional probability tables or mutual information, 772
does not require the discretization of the input data. This increases
the robustness of our method as inappropriate discretization might
lead to loss of signal. In contrast to Pearson’s linear correlation
coefﬁcient, 772 is a non—parametric, non—linear correlation coefﬁcient.
It also detects local correlations that are only apparent in a subset
of the measured conditions. This increased sensitivity is due to
the effective utilization of replicated measurements to model the
measurement error.

The recent DREAMS blind assessment solicited the prediction of
GRNs with thousands of genes from two real datasets (E. coli and
S. cerevisiae) and one artiﬁcial dataset. The 29 participating teams
employed a variety of methods based on regression (Lasso, random
forests), Bayesian networks, mutual information and correlation.
In DREAMS, our approach was rated the best performer on the
inference of real networks and the second best performer on real
and artiﬁcial networks combined. Especially for the inference of
E. col i interactions, our approach performed signiﬁcantly better than
the methods evaluated in DREAMS (Fig. 5) as well as in the large
assessment of Narendra et al. (2011) (Table 2).

DREAMS participants applied a range of network inference approaches
including meta predictors (=combining different approaches) and others
(=methods eluding categorization). Some of the participants, particularly
7,2 (denoted as 1) and Genie3 (=2) signiﬁcantly outperformed previously
published inference approaches (=4—7, compare Table 2, ﬁrst two gray

Fig. 6. Correlations between TFs and TGs in E. coli. As only mRNA
expression data is available, inference depends on the accurate detection
of correlations. The plots in panels (A)—(D) (expression of TF/abscissa
scattered against TG/ordinate, data obtained from M3D) depict a series of
interactions from RegulonDB that are increasingly difﬁcult to detect. Global
linear correlations (A) are easier to detect than non—linear correlations (B).
The expression proﬁles of the multiple antibiotic resistance (mar) genes marA
and marB are a good example of a local correlation that is detected by 712 but
not by ,02 (C). The correlation becomes visible if E. coli is treated with the
antibiotic norﬂoxacin (C: blue dots, E: left side) but not in the experiments
on growth phases (C: orange dots, E: right side). No correlation (panel D)
might result if the TF itself is not regulated at the level of transcription.

In contrast to E. coli, predictions for S. cerevisiae received
signiﬁcantly lower scores because the yeast gold standard network is
less reliable. Compared with E. coli and artiﬁcal networks, inference
is substantially more difﬁcult in S. cerevisiae as here the expression
of TF and their regulated genes is hardly correlated (Fig. 4). Indeed,
with an AUC between 0.49 and 0.54, predictions were hardly better
than guessing. The difﬁculty of network inference in S.cerevisiae
has also been recognized by Hu et al. (2007) and Narendra et al.
(2011). Many publications on network inference approaches solely
focus on E. coli [Faith et al. (2007); Mordelet and Vert (2008)].

Some of the known E. coli interactions identiﬁed by our approach
were quite interesting biologically. For instance, an interaction
between multiple antibiotic resistance genes was active after
antibiotic treatment (local correlation) but not in growth phase
experiments. According to qPCR experiments that were performed
as part of the DREAMS conference >50% of our novel predictions
represent true interactions. At a precision of 50% we thus expect
that our predictions contain 1000 previously unobserved true
interactions.

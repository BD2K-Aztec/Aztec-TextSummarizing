ABSTRACT

Summary: Phylogenetics, likelihood, evolution and complexity (PLEX)
is a flexible and fast Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo software
program for large-scale analysis of nucleotide and amino acid data
using complex evolutionary models in a phylogenetic framework. The
program gains large speed improvements over standard approaches
by implementing ‘partial sampling of substitution histories’, a data
augmentation approach that can reduce data analysis times from
months to minutes on large comparative datasets. A variety of nucleo-
tide and amino acid substitution models are currently implemented,
including non-reversible and site-heterogeneous mixture models. Due
to efficient algorithms that scale well with data size and model com-
plexity, PLEX can be used to make inferences from hundreds to thou-
sands of taxa in only minutes on a desktop computer. It also performs
probabilistic ancestral sequence reconstruction. Future versions will
support detection of co-evolutionary interactions between sites, prob-
abilistic tests of convergent evolution and rigorous testing of evolu-
tionary hypotheses in a Bayesian framework.

Source code and documentation will be available for download at

1 INTRODUCTION

Comparative genomic and phylogenetic datasets are growing
dramatically in size, thanks to rapid and inexpensive
next-generation DNA sequencing technologies. The wealth of
information present in large datasets, however, is difﬁcult to
exploit due to the non-linearly increasing computational
burden imposed by increasing data size and model complexity
(de Koning et al., 2010). For example, it is not uncommon for
phylogenetic analysis of large datasets to now incur compute
times on the order of months, even with models that are fairly

simple from a mechanistic, biochemical perspective (e. g. Rodri-
gue et al., 2010).

To help overcome these challenges, we developed Phyloge-
netics, Likelihood, Evolution and Complexity (PLEX), which
implements rapid data augmentation methods using partial sam-
pling of substitution histories (de Koning et al., 2010) and de-
rivative methods. PLEX is an active research platform and will
support the future development of new models and algorithms.
The capabilities of PLEX will therefore expand over time. For
example, the current version now incorporates more models than
previously as well as implementations of conjugate Gibbs sam-
pling (Lartillot, 2006) and slice sampling (Neal, 2003).

2 APPROACH

PLEX performs Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
analysis using novel data augmentation strategies that can af-
ford it great speed advantages over MCMC packages that use
fully integrated likelihood calculations (e. g. MrBayes, Ronquist
and Huelsenbeck, 2003 and BEAST, Drummond and Rambaut,
2007). Speed advantages are obtained by ‘partially sampling’
substitution events to the nearest branch region and rapidly
integrating over the timing of events within regions when evalu-
ating the likelihood. This approach can be much faster than
sampling the exact timing of substitution events, but appears
to retain the computational advantages of doing so (de Koning
et al., 2010). As a result, PLEX is faster than programs that
augment sequences with fully speciﬁed substitution histories
(e.g. PhyloBayes; Lartillot et al., 2009).

The program samples branch lengths, model parameters and
‘missing’ unobserved data (e.g. ancestral states) from their pos-
terior distributions and provides posterior summaries to facili-
tate inferences about evolutionary mechanisms. The distribution
also includes the ability to calculate posterior statistics of substi-
tution histories, which can be an effective approach for making
complex inferences from comparative data without fully model-
ing the processes of interest (e. g. for detecting co-evolution; our
unpublished data). Posterior-predictive simulation is included for
some model checking applications, and Bayes factor calculation
can be made using thermodynamic integration (Lartillot and
Philippe, 2006; Rodrigue and Aris-Brosou, 2011).

Importantly, the speed advantages enabled by PLEX’s
data augmentation approach help to overcome computational
challenges of large-scale phylogenomic inference in general and
are thus applicable to Virtually any evolutionary model or

phylogenetic analysis task (de Koning et al., 2010). Furthermore,
the approach was designed to substantially reduce the scaling of
time complexity with model complexity (Supplementary Fig. S1),
so that model realism can be more effectively explored without
the need to greatly oversimplify models for computational
convenience.

For example, the times to achieve an average of 1000 effect-
ively independent posterior samples on a large dataset are shown
for a variety of amino acid substitution models (Table 1).
Remarkably, the most parameter-rich site-homogeneous model
in this set is also the easiest to sample from (and therefore the
fastest), because conjugate Gibbs sampling mechanisms are pos-
sible for all parameters in this case (general non-reversible).
Thus, not only do these approaches reduce the need to simplify
models for computational convenience but also in some cases
they facilitate an inversion of incentives, making complex
models more computationally convenient than simpler ones. It
should be noted that similar contrasts can be constructed when
exact substitution timings are augmented (Lartillot, 2006). For
performance comparisons between PLEX and several popular
phylogenetics programs, see Supplementary Results.

When Gibbs update mechanisms are unavailable for a given
model, PLEX uses slice sampling or Metropolis—Hastings up-
dates. The simple form of PLEX’s likelihood function often
makes likelihood evaluations for these mechanisms extremely
rapid and sometimes even 0(1) (de Koning et al., 2010).

The PLEX code is written in C/C++ and has no dependencies
on external libraries. It should therefore compile on any platform
that supports standard C/C++.

3 APPLICATIONS

PLEX is run at the command line using a control ﬁle interface
that allows customization of analyses, including locations of
input sequence alignments and tree topologies. Example control
ﬁles are included that demonstrate how to run most types of
supported analyses. Any position in the alignment possessing a
gap can be excluded or optionally treated as missing.

PLEX currently has several main uses, including:

(1) Rate matrix and branch-length estimation from hundreds
to thousands of taxa in minutes on a desktop computer.

(2) Inference of site heterogeneity in substitution patterns.

(3) Probabilistic inference of ensembles of ancestral states.

(4) Calculation of posterior statistics of substitution histories
(e. g. for tests of co-evolution; our unpublished data).

(5) Hypothesis testing and model evaluation using
posterior-predictive statistics (scripts to automate thermo-
dynamic integration will be made available in a future
release).

PLEX is an active research platform for the development of
new models and algorithms. As such, it will be updated fre-
quently and will grow in capabilities over time. We therefore
expect that PLEX will continue to evolve into an increasingly
capable and comprehensive package for studying molecular evo-
lutionary mechanisms.

4 CONCLUSION

PLEX is a software package for performing rapid and accurate
Bayesian MCMC analysis on large phylogenomic datasets that
remain under active development. Future updates will include
models of temporal heterogeneity, spatial substitution gradients
(Faith and Pollock, 2003) and codon substitution. It is likely that
parallelization and tuning of our slice sampling algorithms will
further substantially improve speed for certain complex analysis
tasks and will thus be pursued in future releases.

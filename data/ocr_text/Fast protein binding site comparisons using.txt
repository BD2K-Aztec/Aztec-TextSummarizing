ABSTRACT

Motivation: Finding geometrically similar protein binding sites is
crucial for understanding protein functions and can provide valuable
information for protein—protein docking and drug discovery. As
the number of known protein—protein interaction structures has
dramatically increased, a high-throughput and accurate protein
binding site comparison method is essential. Traditional alignment-
based methods can provide accurate correspondence between the
binding sites but are computationally expensive.

Results: In this article, we present a novel method for the
comparisons of protein binding sites using a ‘visual Ms’
representation (PB—Sword). We first extract geometric features of
binding site surfaces and build a vocabulary of visual words by
clustering a large set of feature descriptors. We then describe a
binding site surface with a high-dimensional vector that encodes
the frequency of visual words, enhanced by the spatial relationships
among them. Finally, we measure the similarity of binding sites by
utilizing metric space operations, which provide speedy comparisons
between protein binding sites. Our experimental results show that
PBSword achieves a comparable classification accuracy to an
alignment-based method and improves accuracy of a feature-
based method by 36% on a non-redundant dataset. PBSword also
exhibits a significant efficiency improvement over an alignment-
based method.

1 INTRODUCTION

Protein—protein interaction, as an essential aspect of biological
processes, plays a signiﬁcant role in determining protein functions
and forming protein complexes. The protein complexes consist of
multiple subunits (domains or chains) that interact Via protein—
protein interfaces (PPIs) Bahadur and Zacharias, 2008; Kim
et al., 2006). The PPIs are composed of geometrically and
physicochemically complementary binding sites from the respective
subunits. In a protein complex, each binding site corresponds to a

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

region of residues that are in close spatial proximity and can interact
with residues from another subunit.

With the development of high—throughput experimental
techniques (e.g. yeast—two—hybrid screens), the size of data
repositories of protein—protein interactions has dramatically
increased, which makes a comprehensive understanding of the
protein interaction network feasible (Aloy and Russell, 2006).
Several protein—protein interactionrelated databases have been
constructed, such as SCOPPI (Winter at al., 2006), PIBASE
(Davis and Sali, 2005), IntAct (Kerrien et al., 2012), inam (Finn
et al., 2005) and DOMMINO (Kuang et al., 2012). Particularly,
the SCOPPI database provides an evolutionary and structural
classiﬁcation of PPIs based on SCOP family (Murzin et al., 1995),
sequence similarity and geometric features of binding sites. To
analyze the protein—protein interaction mechanisms, an efﬁcient
method for comparing protein binding sites is an indispensible
tool, with a potential impact on protein function prediction,
protein—protein docking, drug discovery and evolutionary studies
(Bradford et al., 2006; Henschel et al., 2006; Tuncbag et al., 2008;
Wu et al., 2004; Zhao et al., 2011).

Methods for comparing the protein binding sites can be generally
classiﬁed into two categories: (i) alignment—based and (ii) feature—
based. Early research works on alignment—based methods focused
on comparing binding sites by aligning the corresponding Ca
atoms from different protein complexes using global structural
alignment tools (Keskin and Nussinov, 2007; Keskin et al., 2004;
Tsai et al., 1996). This group of methods works well when
sequence and structure are well conserved. However, as shown
in an earlier work (Nagano et al., 2002), the limitation of global
protein structure alignment is that it cannot usually produce accurate
interface alignment since the true interface may not be the ﬁrst
priority for a global structure alignment method. To overcome
this issue, iAlign was developed to align the residues from
PPIs (Gao and Skolnick, 2010). Another method, I2ISiteEngine,
supports alignment of two binding sites based on the similarity of
physicochemical properties and the shapes of surfaces (Shulman—
Peleg et al., 2004). The alignment—based methods can provide
accurate correspondence between two binding sites but are usually
computationally expensive, which makes them infeasible when
working with very large datasets.

Feature—based methods, on the other hand, make comparison
based on feature descriptor, which may be structural and/or
geometric properties of the binding site. Typically, the structural
descriptors are distributions of distances between different types
of functional atoms of the binding sites (Sander et al., 2008),
whereas the geometric descriptors include spin—image (Merelli

Fig. 1. Framework of PBSword. The inputs include a query binding site and a
database of binding sites. The outputs are similarity scores between the query
and the database binding sites. For each binding site, geometric features are
extracted and assigned to the nearest visual word from a vocabulary which is
generated by a huge set of features collected from the entire database. Thus,
each binding site can be represented by a histogram of occurrence of visual
words. Two binding sites can be compared by the similarity of two visual
words vectors. A color version of this ﬁgure is available as Supplementary

et al., 2011), 3D—Zernike (Sael et al., 2008), shape distribution
(Das et al., 2009), moment invariants (Sommer et al., 2007) and
many others (Liu et al., 2009; Yin et al., 2009). After generating
surface features, two binding sites can be compared using various
metric functions in the feature space to perform high—throughput
surface comparisons without explicit alignments. Existing feature—
based methods mainly focus on protein—ligand binding sites, which
have not been extensively applied or evaluated on protein—protein
binding site classiﬁcation and related applications. This is important
as protein—protein binding sites are known to have some unique
characteristics, such as relatively large areas and ﬂat binding site
surfaces (Bahadur and Zacharias, 2008).

To deal with very large datasets, one can employ the classic
method from the information retrieval area of comparing the
similarity between word frequency proﬁles of two documents, which
has been successfully utilized in web search engines. Recently, this
idea has been extended to the matching and retrieval of 3D objects
(Bronstein et al., 2011), in which a word is represented by a cluster
of similar features. In the bioinformatics area, this technique has
been applied in the alignment—free genome sequence comparisons
(Sims et al., 2009) and in the retrieval of similar protein structures
(Budowski—Tal et al., 2010).

In this article, we further extend the text comparison method
and propose a novel approach, PB Sword, for characterizing protein
binding sites with a collection of ‘visual words’ such that similar
binding sites from the database can be efﬁciently and accurately
identiﬁed. We conduct experiments to evaluate the performance
of PBSword—based classiﬁcation and retrieval of protein binding
sites. The experimental results show that PBSword can achieve

comparable performance to an alignment—based method, iAlign,
and signiﬁcantly outperforms a feature—based method using moment
invariant descriptors (Sommer et al., 2007). More importantly,
comparing PBSword vectors is orders of magnitude faster than the
alignment—based methods. Thus, PBSword can be used to quickly
identify geometrically similar candidates of a query protein binding
site from a large dataset.

2 METHODS

The framework of PBSword is shown in Figure 1. The inputs include a query
binding site and a database of protein binding sites. The outputs are similarity
scores between the query and database binding sites. The workﬂow of
PBSword consists of the following four steps. First, we select feature points
of each database binding site surface and extract corresponding geometric
features. Second, a visual vocabulary is built by clustering a huge number of
feature point descriptors collected from the entire database of binding sites.
Third, according to its descriptor, each feature point is associated with the
nearest visual word from the visual vocabulary. This allows each binding
site to be represented by the corresponding distribution of visual words. The
above processes for the database binding sites are performed off—line. For
the query binding site, we follow similar steps to generate its visual word
representation. Finally, pairs of binding sites are compared by a scoring
function which calculates the similarity between the two visual word vectors.

Comparing protein binding sites is a more challenging problem than
comparing protein sequences or structures since the residues of a binding
site are not always sequential in nature (Tsai et al., 1996). Hence, a binding
site cannot be represented by a string of residues from the N— to C—terminus
of a protein chain. To solve this problem, we ﬁrst use the surface features to
represent the whole binding site. Then, by projecting the feature vectors into
a visual word from the vocabulary, we can use the occurrence of visual words
to describe the surface, which alleviates the need for sequential relationships
between two feature points. As a feature—based method, PBSword shares
some attractive properties as other similar methods in this category, such
as being sequence— and structure— independent and alignment—free. The
uniqueness of PBSword is in the way it represents the binding sites as a
collection of visual words, which can be used not only in the development
of a compact representation for a family of protein binding sites but also
in the construction of an inverted index for fast retrieval of geometrically
similar binding sites from a large dataset.

2.1 Surface generation

For a protein complex, we use the MSMS program (Sanner et al., 1996) to
generate a triangulated mesh for each of its interacting subunits and set the
density and probe radius to 2.0 points/A2 and 1.4 A, respectively. Since we
are only interested in the binding regions, for each protein mesh, we retain
only those surface points that are within a distance of 4A from the surface of
its binding partner (Shulman—Peleg et al., 2004). A triangle is selected when
its three vertices are all retained in the interaction region. In this article, we
deﬁne a face, as used in the computer graphics community, to represent the
surface of a triangle.

2.2 Feature descriptor

In our approach, feature points are deﬁned as the centers of faces (or
triangles), and a number of sample faces are selected using the procedure
proposed in Osada et al. (2001) to improve computational efﬁciency. In this
method, we ﬁrst calculate the area of each face on the surface and store it as
an array of cumulative areas. Then, we generate a random number ranging
from 0 to the total area, and select the face corresponding to that value in
the array of cumulative areas.

We further develop an approach based on the representation of shape
contexts, originally introduced in Belongie et al. (2002) for 2D object
matching, as a feature descriptor for each feature point. Before calculating

points (i and j) are shown on the binding site surface. m (or I’lj) and r,-
(or rj) represent the normal vector and 3D coordinate of the i—th (or j—th)
face center, respectively. Suppose the visual word index for the sample point
i (or j) is V,- (or Vj). To calculate the PFP for the sample point i, a ball with
radius d is ﬁrst placed at ri. Then, the occurrence of word pairs with index
(Vi, Vj) (j=1,...,k) within the ball is counted for different directions 6 (6 2
0°, 45°, 90°, 135°, and 180°) separately. Here, the direction 6 is deﬁned as
the angle between two corresponding normal vectors.

features, we normalize the scale of binding site mesh by the maximum
geodesic distance from all pair—wise distances within each binding site.
Assuming binding site A has N faces and M (M << N) sample faces, for
face F i, we use m and rl- (Fig. 2) to represent the normal vector and 3D
coordinate of the i—th face center, respectively. For a given sample face F ,- (i:
1,. . .,M) and another face F]- (j 75 i, j: 1,. . .,N) on the binding surface, we ﬁrst
calculate the geodesic distance gl-j between rl- and rj using Dijkstra’s shortest
path algorithm (Dijkstra, 1959) and angle Olj between I’lj and a unit vector
pointing from r,- to rj. Then, a feature descriptor Wl- (or shape context) for
the sample face F ,- is calculated to quantitatively measure the distributions
between F ,- and the remaining N —1 face centers in logarithmic geodesic
distances bins and angles bins, which are set to 10 and 8, respectively. By
construction, the feature vector at a given face center is invariant under
translation and scaling. In total, we extract M features {Wf‘, ie{1,...,M } },
and say that binding site A is characterized by its feature descriptor WA. In
the experiments, M is emperically set to 200.

2.3 Visual vocabulary construction

The feature descriptors from different binding sites are clustered to construct
a vocabulary of visual words, where each word in the vocabulary is
quantitatively described by the corresponding cluster. We empirically
identify a number of clusters based on the standard square—error partitioning
method, k—means (Lloyd, 1982). In this step, a vocabulary V: {V1, ...,Vk}
of size k is obtained. Descriptors sharing the same center will be represented
by the same word.

Unlike the vocabulary of a text corpus whose size is relatively ﬁxed, the
size of a vocabulary for protein binding sites is controlled by the number
of feature clusters generated by k—means. With a small vocabulary, the
visual word is not very discriminative because dissimilar feature points
can be mapped to the same visual word. As the vocabulary size increases,
the feature is expected to be more discriminative; however, it becomes
possible for similar feature points to be mapped to different visual words. As
there is no standard way to select the appropriate size of a vocabulary, we
empirically select k based on the experiment for various vocabulary sizes
(see Section 3.3).

2.4 Surface Visual words representation

The surface visual words representation consists of two parts: (i) single—word
frequency proﬁle (SFP) and (ii) pair—word frequency proﬁle (PFP).

We ﬁrst compute the frequency of occurrence of each individual visual
word for a binding site A. Given a vocabulary V, for each sample face ieA
with descriptor Wlf“, we calculate the Euclidean distance between W? (i:
1,...,M) and each visual word V]- (j= 1,...,k). We then associate face i with
the index of the visual word with the smallest distance from the vocabulary V.

The SFP of binding siteAis a k x 1 vector PA: (19?, . .,pz‘), which is deﬁned
as the frequency of each word in A. An example of the SFP for three binding
sites with k = 400 is shown in Supplementary Figure S1. As these binding
sites are from the database SCOPPI, we use the same identiﬁer as (Sommer
et al., 2007), to name each binding site: <PDB—ID>_< SCOP—domain
of the binding site>_<Chain—ID of the binding site>_< SCOP—domain
of the binding partner>_<Chain—ID of the binding partner>. The group
ID for each binding site is labeled as: <SCOP—family of the binding
site >_<cluster ID within the SCOP family>. In Supplementary Figure $1,
the binding sites 1m3d_78535_B_78538_C and 1t60_106525_V_106528_W
are from same SCOPPI group (ID: d.169.1.6_1) whereas the binding site
1cer_29989_R_39901_O is from another SCOPPI group (ID: c.2.1.3_25).
From the ﬁgure, we can see that the SFPs of 1m3d_78535_B_78538_C
and 1t60_106525_V_106528_W are very similar whereas they are starkly
different from the SFP of 1cer_29989_R_39901_O.

The pair—word spatial—sensitive frequency proﬁle (PFP) of binding site A,
extended from (Haralick et al., 1973) for texture analysis of images, is based
on the idea that the surface of a binding site can be characterized spatially
by measuring the local distribution of pairs of visual words that are within
a given distance d in a given direction 6 for a sample point. Given a sample
point with a visual word index Vi, the frequency P6139 (i, j) is calculated
by accumulating the occurrences of a pair of visual words that have visual
word indices of visual word (Vi, Vj) and are located within a distance d in
direction 6 (Fig. 3). The following measures [shown in Equations (1)—(7)]
are computed for each binding site surface:

coordinates of all visual words on the binding sites, and the direction 6 is
deﬁned as the angle between the two corresponding normal vectors. As there
is no particular purpose required to retain the 6 dependence, we compute the
above mentioned measures with 6 = 0, 45, 90, 135 and 180° and take the
average over these angles.

2.5 Scoring function

For a given query binding site A, the scoring function is used to assign a
similarity score of a retrieved binding site B from the database. We ﬁrst
deﬁne the score of SFP as follow:

< PA,PB >

SSFP(A,B)=1—COS—1(—
IIPAII-IIPBII

) (8)
where PA and PB are the SFPs for binding sites A and B, respectively. < PA,
PB > is the inner product of PA and PB, and ||PA II and “PB II are the norms
of PA and PB, respectively.

In addition, we deﬁne a score for PFP as follows:

llTA—TBII

S A,B =l——.
PF” ) argmaXOlTA—T’ll)
i

(9)

where T A and T B are the PFPs for binding sites A and B, respectively. The
distance llTA — TB II is normalized by the maximum distance between A and
the database binding sites T i (i: 1,. . .,L) where L is the size of database.

Finally, we also look at the ratio of areas between two binding sites A and
B. The intuition is that if two binding sites display a signiﬁcant difference
in surface area, they will not be geometrically similar. We deﬁne the scoring
function regarding area of binding sites as follows:

min(RA , RB)

S A,B :—
Area( ) maX(RA,RB)

(10)
where RA and RB are areas of binding sites A and B, respectively.

An aggregated similarity function is deﬁned to include the above three
scoring functions to provide a ﬁnal similarity score:

SBS(AaB)=W1XSSFP+W2XSPFP+W3 XSAreaa (11)

where M, wz and W3 are used to weight the contributions from the three
similarity terms.

3 RESULTS

To demonstrate the signiﬁcance of this work, we compare the
performance to current methods in terms of accuracy and efﬁciency.
The current methods include an alignment—based method, iAlign
(Gao and Skolnick, 2010), which is designed for PPI comparison
based on the local substructures of subunits, and a feature—based
method, MI (Sommer et al., 2007), which describes the geometric
shape of a binding site using a feature vector based on moment
invariants.

We apply PBSword, iAlign and MI to a non—redundant dataset
from SCOPPI to evaluate classiﬁcation and retrieval performance
for protein—protein binding sites. During the experiment, a query
dataset is selected and used to retrieve similar binding sites from the
entire database.

To evaluate classiﬁcation accuracy, we use a general metric, the
correct classiﬁcation rate (CCR), which is deﬁned as follows:

CCR _ The number of correctly classiﬁed binding sites (12)
_ The total number of test binding sites

 

In addition, for each query, we identify the top results whose SCOPPI
group matches the query’s group. The ranks of these ‘top results’ are
then accumulated with summary statistics reported.

Comparison of the CCR for PBSword and MI. The result of MI is from caption of
Figurel in Sommer et al. (2007). CCR of PBSword is calculated for top 1, 5, 10 and
1% ranked results.

We also use the AUC (area under curve) in the ROC (receiver
operator characteristics) curve (Bradley, 1997) to measure how well
each method identiﬁes the other binding sites from the query’s group.
An AUC of 1.0 would correspond to perfect classiﬁcation, which
would rank the binding sites from the same group as the query’s
before all other binding sites, whereas an AUC of 0.5 would be
expected for a random classiﬁer.

3.1 Protein binding site classiﬁcation and retrieval

The dataset used in this experiment, denoted as D1, is a non—
redundant dataset of protein binding sites extracted from SCOPPI
1.69 and has been used to evaluate the performance of MI. Dataset
D1 consists of 2819 protein binding sites clustered into 501 groups,
as determined in Sommer et al. (2007). The query dataset, denoted
as Q1, includes 224 binding sites from 53 groups that are selected
from D1 by applying a structural alignment tool, TM—align (Zhang
and Skolnick, 2005), to ensure the similarity score (i.e. TM—score)
among the binding sites within one group was >0.45 [for a more
detailed description of D1, see (Sommer et al., 2007)].

We test our method with a vocabulary size (k) of 400 on all protein
binding sites from Q1. As each binding site in D1 belongs to a group
of geometrically similar binding sites, our evaluation is to measure
how well we can correctly classify members from the same group.
For a query binding site, we rank each binding site in D1 (with the
query binding site excluded) based on similarity score [Equation
(11)]. In a perfect scenario, the query binding site would be classiﬁed
into the same group as the top—ranked binding site. Table 1 presents
the CCR performance comparison of PBSword and MI for Q1 and
D1. Intuitively, the optimal accuracy of classiﬁcation is 100% CCR.
Our classiﬁcation results show that when using only the top rank,
PB Sword achieves a 76% CCR, which is a signiﬁcant improvement
over the 40% CCR reported by MI in its original paper (Sommer
et al., 2007). We also investigate the performance of PBSword
by examining up to the top 1% (=28) of ranked results. In these
situations, if one protein binding site from the same group as query
can be found in a certain range, the query binding site is regarded
as correctly classiﬁed. As shown in Table 1, CCRs are 88 and 91%
when the top 5 and top 10 ranks are considered, respectively.

Table 2 shows summary statistics for the best hits from PBSword
and MI for Q1 and D1. Here, the quartiles are values that divide a
set of data into four equal parts. From the table, we can see that the
third quartile of PB Sword is still 1, as opposed to 18.3 for MI, which
represents a signiﬁcant improvement. In the worst case, PBSword
ﬁnds a binding site from the same group as the query at rank 587
(top 20%).

Table 3 shows summary statistics for the AUC of PB Sword and MI
for Q1 and D1. From the table, we can see PB Sword also outperforms
MI in terms of AUC. In the worst case, PBSword can achieve

PB Sword. With our method, for 25% of the queries, we can identify
all the members from the same group without any false positives,
which signiﬁcantly outperforms MI (5%) and improves by 20%.
In addition to comparing the feature—based method MI, we also
perform the same experiments using the alignment—based method,
iAlign, on Q1 and D1. Unfortunately, iAlign cannot always ﬁnd
all the alignments of binding sites from the dataset; hence, to
facilitate the comparison between PB Sword and iAlign, we construct
a reduced query dataset, Q’l, by removing those groups from the
query dataset that contained the binding sites iAlign could not
ﬁnd. This results in the exclusion of 10 groups (ID: a.2.11.1_3,
c.1.9.2_7, c.1.14.1_1, c.48.1.2_2, d.8.1.1_2, d.8.1.1_5, d.19.1.1_36,
d.58.33.1_6, d.153.1.4_13 and f.21.1.2_15) from the query dataset

Q1, which left 188 binding sites clustered into 43 groups. For
completeness, the performance of PB Sword on the excluded binding
sites {Q1 — Q’1 } is reported in Supplementary Tables Sl and S2.
Table 4 presents the CCR performance comparison between
PBSword and iAlign for the reduced query dataset Q’l. As can be
seen, PB Sword achieves a 77% CCR, which is relatively close to the
82% CCR of iAlign. We further investigate the CCR performance by
examining up to the top 1% of ranked results. By using the top ﬁve
results, PB Sword can achieve a CCR of 88%, which is comparable
to the CCR using top result from iAlign (82%). Thus, on this dataset,
instead of performing one—against—all structural alignment using
iAlign, we can achieve a similar classiﬁcation accuracy by checking
the top ﬁve results (0.1% of the entire database of binding sites)
generated by PBSword. Table 5 presents the summary statistics for
the best hits from these two methods. Though it is noted that the
worst rank of the best hit from PB Sword is 587, which is worse than
iAlign, PBSword still ﬁlters out ~80% of the dissimilar binding
sites. By performing iAlign on the remaining 20% of binding sites
in the database, we cannot only achieve a similar classiﬁcation
accuracy as iAlign, but can also save ~80% in computing resources
compared with a one—against—all alignment using iAlign. Table 6
shows the summary statistics for the AUC. In the worst case,
PB Sword obtains an AUC of 0.75, which is better than that of iAlign
(0.69). From these experimental results, we can see that PBSword

provides an efﬁcient way to ﬁlter out geometrically dissimilar
binding sites and obtain a short list of similar ones, which can be
sent to the existing alignment—based methods for reﬁnement.

We also evaluate performance of PB Sword using a non—redundant
dataset selected from SCOPPI 1.75, which is denoted as D2.
The experimental results of D2 can be found in Supplementary
Material Sl.

3.2 Efﬁciency

We measure the average response time for 188 binding sites from
Q’1 to evaluate the efﬁciency of PBSword. The experiments are
conducted on a Linux Fedora server with AMD Opteron dual—
core 1000 series processors and 8 GB RAM. With PBSword, each
query takes 0.31 s for one—against—all score calculations. For iAlign,
however, each query takes 1016 s to scan the entire database D1.
Note that we have excluded the CPU time spent on generating the
surface and calculating the visual words, as it can be performed off—
line during the preprocessing stage. An efﬁciency comparison with
I2ISiteEngine, another alignment—based method, was not performed
in this article, though we note that I2ISiteEngine has been evaluated
elsewhere (Gao and Skolnick, 2010) where experimental results
showed that iAlign can achieve about an 89—fold speedup over
I2ISiteEngine.

3.3 Parameter selection

The performance of our method is heavily dependent on the
vocabulary size (k). To study the inﬂuence of k on the results, we
carried out three experiments on D1 with k= 200, 400 and 600. The
corresponding CCR of top rank is 69, 76 and 74%, respectively. As
such, we selected k= 400 as our default settings.

4 STUDYING PROTEIN STRUCTURES FROM A
GEOMETRIC PERSPECTIVE

We have shown that PBSword can identify geometrically similar
protein binding sites from the same SCOP family based on surface
shape features. As the molecular shape has long been recognized as
a key factor in protein—protein interactions, we further investigate
whether PBSword can discover non—trivial biological connections
among proteins from a geometric perspective. In this section, we
ﬁrst study whether our approach can help us to investigate the
relationships between the geometrically similar shapes of protein
binding sites participating in an interaction and the functions carried
out by the interactions. Speciﬁcally, we use our approach to ﬁrst
retrieve geometrically similar binding sites for a ‘seed’ binding
site A, and then select the top—ranked binding site B to analyze
the functional similarity between the corresponding proteins. The
binding partners of A and B are denoted as A’ and B’, respectively.
We consider two cases: (i) A and B are from same SCOP family,
whereas A’ and B’ are from different families; and (ii) A, A’, B and B’
are all from different SCOP families. We then study the relationships
between the shapes of protein binding sites and functional diversity
within a SCOP family. Intuitively, proteins from the same family
are expected to be structurally similar and have related functions.
Discovering a protein binding site from such a family would not
be very biologically signiﬁcant, since the binding sites from the
structurally similar proteins are expected to be similar and clustered
together. What would be more interesting would be the discovery of

two protein binding sites which are from the same family, but have
dissimilar geometric shapes and different molecular functions. For
this study, we consider another case: (iii) A, A’, B and B’ are from
the same SCOP family but belong to different functional groups. In
this case, the binding site B is not the top—ranked, but the highest
ranking result from the same family. The schematic representations
for the three cases are shown in Figure 4.

To study the structure—function relationship based on the
geometric feature of binding site, we select another non—redundant
dataset of protein—protein interfaces generated by all—against—all
interface comparisons of protein complexes from PDB using
I2ISiteEngine (Mintz et al., 2005). This dataset, denoted as D3,
consists of 604 protein—protein interfaces clustered into 59 groups.
In each group, interface members share a sequence identity of
<50%. As the binding site in this dataset is deﬁned on the protein
chain, we use <PDB—ID >_< Chain ID of the binding site><Chain
ID of the binding site partner> to represent a protein binding site.

In the ﬁrst case, the protein binding site 4sgb_EI is selected as a
query to retrieve similar binding sites from D3 with our method.
The top result is 1sgd_EI from the same group (Fig. 5a). The
protein chains 4sgb_E and 1sgd_E are all from the prokaryotic
proteases family, whereas the chain 4sgb_I and 1sgd_I belong to the
plant proteinase inhibitors family and ovomucoid domain III—like
family, respectively. The alignment results of TM—align and iAlign
are shown in Figure 5b and c, which show that two protein chain
pairs can be well aligned. The TM—score of the two aligned protein
structures is 0.99, and the IS—score of the aligned interfaces is
0.64, which are statistically signiﬁcant (Gao and Skolnick, 2010;
Xu and Zhang, 2010). The binding site surfaces with the chemical
environments (i.e. electrostatic potential), shown in Figure 5d, are
also similar. In this case, 4sgb_I and 1sgd_I belong to different
families, but can bind to the equivalent sites of homologous 4sgb_E
and 1sgd_E, respectively. This type of interactions, also known as
convergently evolved interaction motifs, would be very biologically
signiﬁcant as it can be used to discover rules for interactions and
design ligand (Henschel et al., 2006).

In the second case, we select protein binding site 1b99_AD. In
D2, 1b99_AD has been classiﬁed into a group including 1100_AB,
113b_AD, 1e7p_AD, 1gtt_BC and liun_AB (Mintz et al., 2005).
The top result from PB Sword is 1tmk_BA, which is from another
group. The proteins 1b99 and 1tmk are from the nucleoside
diphosphate kinase family and nucleotide and nucleoside kinases
family, respectively. However, both proteins are kinase and mainly
composed of oz—helices and ,8—strands (Supplementary Fig. 84A).
The sequence alignment between the 1b99 and 1tmk binding chains
shows low similarity. The global structure alignment using TM—
align is given in Supplementary Figure S4B, which shows that
the residues from the binding chains 1b99_D and 1tmk_A cannot
be aligned together. Hence, we obtain a TM—score of 0.25, which
is not statistically signiﬁcant. In contrast, iAlign can ﬁnd partial
residue correspondences between the two interfaces (Supplementary
Fig. S4C) with an IS—score of 0.24 (p—value = 0.42 X 10‘2). As a
comparison, the binding site surfaces of 1b99_AD and 1tmk_BA
are shown in Supplementary Figure S4D. Despite the sequence and
global structure conservation being low, the binding site surfaces
of 1b99_AD and 1tmk_BA are geometrically similar, which is
effectively captured by PB Sword.

In the third case, we select the family of C—type lectin domains
(SCOP ID d.169.1.1). In 1993, Drickamer ﬁrst classiﬁed proteins in

chains 4sgb_I and 1sgd_I belong to the plant proteinase inhibitors family
and ovomucoid domain III—like family, respectively. (b) Global structure

this family into seven groups and showed that such classiﬁcation can
capture functional similarities between proteins (Drickamer, 1993).
The classiﬁcation was later revised (Drickamer and Fadden, 2002;
Zelensky and Gready, 2005), and currently this family has 17 groups.
The spatial relationships of protein binding sites in this family were
analyzed in (Korkin et al., 2005), and signiﬁcant diversity was
found. In this case, protein binding site 1k9i_68344_B68349_G
from this family, which is not included in the query dataset Q1,
is selected and compared with the sites from D1. In D1, binding
site 1bv4_42381_B42383_C (Supplementary Fig. SSA) from the
same family is recognized as having a similar interface type and is
classiﬁed into the same group (ID: d.169.1.1_21) according to the
sequence and structure alignment methods employed by SCOPPI.
With our approach, the binding site 1bv4_42381_B42383_C is
ranked as 2334. The structure alignments of TM—align and iAlign
are shown in Supplementary Figure 85B and C, respectively. As
these two bind sites belong to same family, we can ﬁnd signiﬁcant
similarity from TM—align (TM—score = 0.86). However, the IS—score
from iAlign is only 0.11 (p—value = 0.84). The binding site surfaces,
shown in Supplementary Figure 85D, are remarkably dissimilar. The
functional groups of 1k9i and 1bv4 are also different. According
to the classiﬁcation of functional groups in (Zelensky and Gready,
2005), protein 1k9i belongs to the asialoglycoprotein and DC
receptors group whereas protein 1bv4 belongs to the collectins
group. From this case, we can see that the surface dissimilarity

detected by PB Sword can be potentially used to discover functional
diversity between two proteins from the same family.

5 CONCLUSIONS

We have presented PB Sword, a novel method for protein binding site
characterization and comparison based on the distribution of visual
words of surfaces. The proposed method complements existing
alignment—based approaches in the analysis of protein—protein
interactions. The method is applied to evaluate the classiﬁcation
and retrieval performance of protein—protein binding sites and is
compared with an alignment—based method (iAlign) and to a feature—
based method using moment invariants. The results show that
PBSword can achieve comparable classiﬁcation accuracy to the
alignment—based methods with greatly improved efﬁciency.

We emphasize that PBSword, as a feature—based method for
fast ﬁltering of similar binding sites from a large dataset, is not
designed to be a replacement of existing alignment—based methods.
Instead, PBSword works as a complementary approach to the
various structure comparison methods and offers an efﬁcient way
to classify and retrieve geometrically similar binding sites.

Our future work includes (1) the development of a more
comprehensive scoring function for the surface comparison that
takes into consideration physicochemical properties, and (ii)
extension to the protein—ligand binding site comparison and
retrieval.

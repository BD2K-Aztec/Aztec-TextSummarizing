Abstract

Summary: Descriptions of genetic variations and their effect are widely spread across the biomed—
ical literature. However, finding all mentions of a specific variation, or all mentions of variations in
a specific gene, is difficult to achieve clue to the many ways such variations are described. Here, we
describe SETH, a tool for the recognition of variations from text and their subsequent normalization
to dbSNP or UniProt. SETH achieves high precision and recall on several evaluation corpora of
PubMed abstracts. It is freely available and encompasses stand—alone scripts for isolated applica—
tion and evaluation as well as a thorough documentation for integration into other applications.

Availability and Implementation: SETH is released under the Apache 2.0 license and can be down—

loaded from http://rockt.github.io/SETH/.

1 Introduction

Over the last decades, a wealth of information about genetic vari—
ations and their effect on phenotypes has been published in the sci—
entific literature. However, finding such variations, the genes they
affect, and the associated effects on phenotypes is cumbersome due
to the many ways in which variations can be described. Despite ef—
forts towards defining nomenclature guidelines for genetic variants
(den Dunnen and Antonarakis, 2000), authors often use descriptive
natural language instead of following a suggested formalism, which
incurs ambiguity and uncertainty in which variation actually is
described. This severely hinders the usage of published variation
data for subsequent analyses such as biological and clinical inter-
pretation. Several tools have been developed to facilitate the identifi—
cation of genetic variants in teXt (for a recent evaluation we refer to
Jimeno Yepes and Verspoor 2014b), but none of them is freely avail—
able, recognizes and normalizes mentions to an acknowledged no—
menclature, links variations to structured databases (e.g. dbSNP or
UniProt), and covers a large range of mutation types. SETH is an
open source tool unifying all these features. Furthermore, SETH

achieves consistent high precision and recall on several publicly
available gold standard corpora.

2 Methods

SETH’s workﬂow is depicted in Figure 1. It consists of two main
components: (i) Recognition of genetic variants mentioned in teXt
(see Section 2.1) and (ii) mapping of recognized variants to dbSNP
or UniProt identifiers (see Section 2.2).

2.1 Named—entity recognition
SETH relies on four complementary modules to recognize genetic
variants.

i. Nomenclature EBNF: Variation mentions adhering to the
human mutation nomenclature, described by den Dunnen and
Antonarakis (2000), are recognized by an Extended Backus—
Naur (EBNF) grammar which was originally published by
Laros et al. (2011). We adapted this grammar to also detect

Fig. 1. SETH uses multiple strategies to recognize and subsequently normal-
ize genetic variations (see text for details)

frequently observed deviations from the nomenclature
(‘p.Arg282 >Gln’ instead of ‘p.Arg282Gln’).

ii. MutationFinder: Short phrases describing single nucleotide sub—
stitutions are recognized using a modiﬁed version of
MutationFinder (Caporaso et al., 2007). We included patterns
detecting nonsense mutations (‘Ala15Ter’, ‘A15X’), DNA sub-
stitutions (‘—650A > T’), and mutations using ambiguous amino
acid letter codes (‘Asx’ for Aspartate or Asparagine).

iii. Nomenclature RegExes: Using a set of regular expressions,
SETH recognizes deletions (‘852 —l— 123delT’), insertions, substi—
tutions (‘IVS123-12A— >T’), and frameshift mutations
(‘A123st1’) following nomenclature recommendations from
(Ad Hoc Committee on Mutation Nomenclature, 1996).
Regular expressions have been developed by implementing a
test—driven approach integrating variation mentions from eleven
different proposals for a mutation nomenclature.

iv. Literal mentions: Literal mentions of dbSNP identiﬁers (‘rs334’,
‘rs334zA > C’) are recognized using regular expressions.

SETH merges mutations found by more than one NER—module
into a single mention. This strategy helps to resolve ambiguous cases
by favoring matches against the most rigorous and recent nomencla—
ture over others. For example, MutationFinder might detect a sub—
string of a variation, while the EBNF grammar detects the full
mutation mention. All recognized mutation mentions are categorized
into one of the following: substitution, deletion, insertion, duplica—
tion, insertion—deletion (insdel), inversion, conversion, translocation,
frameshift, short—sequence repeat or literal dbSNP mention.

2.2 Named—entity normalization
Following the initial recognition of mutation mentions, SETH links
variations to a unique identifier of the dbSNP (for single nucleotide
variations) or UniProt database (regarding the protein containing the
mutation) if possible. To disambiguate between multiple possible
identifiers, this step requires additional information about genes or
proteins mentioned in the same article. SETH currently is configured
to work with PubMed abstracts for which it uses precomputed results
from the gene recognition tool GNAT (Hakenberg et al., 2011) and
NCBI’s gene2pubmed (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/DATA/GENE_
INFO/). However, the modular implementation of SETH makes it
simple to replace the gene recognition tool to be used, in order to
adapt to other types of texts, such as patents or clinical trial reports.
The normalization procedure uses the heuristics discussed by
Thomas et al. (2011). These heuristics account for frequent differ—
ences between textual and structured database information by per—
forming a physical validation. This validation technique compares
detected variations with the DNA coding sequence (CDS) or protein
sequence in the respective dbSNP or UniProt database, taking into

account systematic differences like post—translational modifications
or inversed DNA strands.

SETH rewrites mentions of variations using a HGVS—compliant
representation, substituting, for instance, ‘AF508’ with ‘p.Phe508del’.
This is useful for mapping large repositories of mutation mentions
into the latest mutation nomenclature, helping to decrease ambiguity.

3 Evaluation

We assessed the performance of SETH on a series of publicly
available corpora for named entity recognition and dbSNP—
normalization (see Table 1). All these corpora are annotated on
abstract level and performance of named entity recognition was
evaluated using an exact matching strategy. We also annotated a
text corpus of 630 publications with mutation mentions by sam—
pling papers from the journals The American journal of Human
Genetics and Human Mutation published between 1992 and 2012.
To ensure a high variability of textual variation expressions, we
uniformly sampled 30 publications per year. This corpus is freely
available from the SETH project web page. Regarding identifica—
tion of variations, SETH achieves F1 scores over 85% across sev—
eral corpora, demonstrating its robustness and independence from
particularities of the curation processes in these different corpora.
In their own evaluation on two publicly available test corpora,
thar (Wei et al., 2013) outperforms SETH by 4—5% points for
NER. However, SETH has been compared with four freely avail—
able tools for mutation recognition in intrinsic and extrinsic ex-
periments by Jimeno Yepes and Verspoor (2014b). In their work,
the authors evaluated MutationFinder (Caporaso et al., 2007),
EMU (Doughty et al., 2011), OMM (Naderi and Witte, 2012),
thar (Wei et al., 2013) and SETH. In the intrinsic set-up, SETH
outperformed all competitors in terms of F1 on the Variome full-
text corpus (Jimeno Yepes and Verspoor, 2014a) using exact
matching for evaluation. In the extrinsic set—up, where only cover—
age was measured, SETH achieved the best result for the COSMIC
database (Bamford et al., 2004).

Finally, the performance of normalization to human dbSNP
identifiers was assessed on two publicly available corpora
(Furlong et al., 2008; Thomas et al., 2011). The first corpus pro—
vides annotations for gene name, which were used in our normal-
ization experiments. For the second corpus from Thomas et al. we
used the precomputed GNAT and gene2pubmed results.

4 Conclusion

We introduced SETH, an open—source tool for recognizing and nor-
malizing mentions of variations in natural language text. By rewriting

variants using the HGVS nomenclature and normalization to dbSNP,
SETH facilitates indexing and information retrieval of heterogeneous
occurrences of the same biological variant across the literature. SETH
achieves state—of—the—art performance and is the only freely available
tool performing physical validation not only for protein sequence mu—
tations but also for DNA variations. Variation mentions recognized by
SETH in PubMed and PubMed Central can be browsed in GeneView
(Thomas et al., 2012) at http://bc3.informatik.hu—berlin.de/.

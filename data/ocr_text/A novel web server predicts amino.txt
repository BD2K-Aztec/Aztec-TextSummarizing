ABSTRACT

Motivation: To clarify the relationship between structural elements
and polypeptide chain mobility, a set of statistical analyses of struc-
tures is necessary. Because at present proteins with determined spa-
tial structures are much less numerous than those with amino acid
sequence known, it is important to be able to predict the extent of
proton protection from hydrogen—deuterium (HD) exchange basing
solely on the protein primary structure.

Results: Here we present a novel web server aimed to predict the
degree of amino acid residue protection against HD exchange solely
from the primary structure of the protein chain under study. On the
basis of the amino acid sequence, the presented server offers the
following three possibilities (predictors) for user’s choice. First, predic-
tion of the number of contacts occurring in this protein, which is shown
to be helpful in estimating the number of protons protected against HD
exchange (sensitivity 0.71). Second, probability of H-bonding in this
protein, which is useful for finding the number of unprotected protons
(specificity 0.71). The last is the use of an artificial predictor. Also, we
report on mass spectrometry analysis of HD exchange that has been
first applied to free amino acids. Its results showed a good agreement
with theoretical data (number of protons) for 10 globular proteins (cor-
relation coefficient 0.73). We pioneered in compiling two datasets of
experimental HD exchange data for 35 proteins.

1 INTRODUCTION

Because ﬂexible sequence regions frequently play an important
functional role, they are currently in the focus of numerous stu-
dies. The functional properties of a protein molecule are a com-
promise between ﬂexibility and rigidity. It was demonstrated that
loops and ,B-turns showed a higher mobility than other structural
elements (Rose et al., 1985). Flexibility is also characteristic of
epitopes and binding sites of a number of enzymes modulating

the life span of proteins in viva (Fontana, 1988; Westhof et al.,
1984). The method combining hydrogen—deuterium (HD) ex-
change and mass spectrometry data (HDMS) is widely used to
study conformational changes in protein structures. HD ex-
change studies are mostly focused on the exchange of protons
involved in H-bonding, which contributes to stabilization of sec-
ondary and spatial structures of proteins (Englander, 2006).
HDMS results have proved to be useful in improving prediction
of de novo protein structures (Malmstroem et al., 2009).

Recently, it was demonstrated that the direct contact of an
amino acid residue with solvent did not guarantee a rapid HD
exchange (Skinner et al., 2012), which pointed to the necessity of
taking into account the structure—rate relationships (Skinner
et al., 2012).

It should be noted that to predict rigid/ﬂexible regions and
HD exchange rates, a 3D structure was typically used as the
subject matter of, for example, the pebble game/FIRST
method (Jacobs et al., 2001). The CamP server made for predic-
tion of protection factors solely from an amino acid sequence
(Tartaglia et al., 2007) and previously available at http://www-
almost.ch.cam.ac.uk/camp.php now does not exist, but in 2008
we had a chance to make predictions for 6 of 14 proteins
(Dovidchenko and Galzitskaya, 2008). The fraction of amino
acid residues with the correctly CamP-predicted degree of pro-
tection was 50%. In spite of the fact that CamP was a complex
neural network-based method, it heavily overpredicted the
number of HD exchange-protected residues, and thus, with
97% accuracy of prediction of protected regions, that of unpro-
tected ones was as low as 13%.

We believe that the absence of protection may be explained
mostly by large amplitude of ﬂuctuations of the protein chain
regions between packed elements of the secondary structure,
which promotes contacts of the ﬂuctuating region with solvent.
Hence, prediction of unfolded and ﬂexible regions can reveal
those prone to large structural ﬂuctuations, and therefore, to
HD exchange. Some structural aspects of local ﬂexibility are
outlined in this work. We concentrated on the possibility of pre-
diction of polypeptide chain protection against HD exchange,
which resulted in the presented here server made for prediction
of residues protected/unprotected against HD exchange.
Additionally, we report on the pioneer use of mass spectrometry
analysis of HD exchange for free amino acids and good correl-
ation of its results with theoretical data for 10 globular proteins.

2 METHODS

Approaches to prediction of residue protection against HD exchange: The
observed packing density and H-bonding statistics were obtained for a
database that contained spatial structures of 3769 proteins (Galzitskaya
et al., 2006). The database contained proteins that belong to four main
structural classiﬁcation of proteins (SCOP) (Murzin et al., 1995) classes
(classes a, b, c and d with all-oz, all-,8, 05/,8 and 05+ ,8 proteins, respect-
ively). The proteins had <25% sequence identity to one another.

The observed packing density (the observed number of contacts) for
each amino acid residue in the database was calculated (Galzitskaya
et al., 2006) as an average number of close residues (within a given dis-
tance). A residue was considered to be close to another one if any pair of
their non-hydrogen atoms was at a distance <8 A (the neighboring resi-
dues were excluded from the consideration). Then, the observed packing
densities were averaged for each of 20 types of amino acid residues.

Hydrogen bonds were searched for in the same database.
Backbone—backbone hydrogen bonds (that is, hydrogen bonds where
the donor is an NH-group of the protein backbone and the acceptor is
an O-atom of the protein backbone) were analyzed by a standard pro-
gram DSSP (Kabsch and Sander, 1983). For each NH-group, only one
hydrogen bond (which had the best energy, according to DSSP) was
taken into consideration in this case. The criterion of hydrogen bond
formation was that recommended by DSSP (the calculated energy
lower than —0.5kcal/mol). Based on the obtained data, the probability
of H-bonding by each of 20 types of amino acid residues was calculated.
For the calculation, the hydrogen bonds were ‘ascribed’ to donors.

The expected values (the expected packing density or H-bonding prob-
ability) served as predictors for constructing a packing density proﬁle or
an H-bonding probability proﬁle. The calculations were made using the
sliding-window averaging technique. First, the expected value was deter-
mined for each residue (it was equal to the average value observed for this
type of residue in a spatial structure); then, these numbers were averaged
inside the window, and the average was assigned to the central residue of
the window. The ‘smoothed’ expected value for every position of the
polypeptide chain provided the ﬁnal proﬁle, which was directly used
for prediction of residues protected against HD exchange.

Basing either on the predictor of expected contacts or on that of ex-
pected number of hydrogen bonds, we predicted protected residues as
those with a cut-off—exceeding number of expected contacts or expected
hydrogen bonds.

Criterion for estimation of the quality of prediction: To assess the ability of
a certain parameter to predict the degree of protection of amino acid
residues against HD exchange, we compared the results of our predictions
with experimental data. The quality of our predictions was evaluated
using the commonly used standard values sensitivity and speciﬁcity,
which are the fraction of correctly predicted protected residues and the
fraction of correctly predicted unprotected residues, respectively.

 

Sensitivity = TP/Np (1)
Specificity = T N /an (2)
ACC : Sensitivity + Specificity (3)

where T P (true positives) is the number of amino acid residues correctly
predicted as protected against HD exchange, TN (true negatives) is the
number of amino acid residues correctly predicted as unprotected ones.
N p is the number of residues experimentally shown as protected, and an
is the number of residues experimentally shown as unprotected against
HD exchange. The quality of prediction was estimates as

Q2=(TP+TN)/N (4)

where N is the total number of amino acid residues for which experimen-
tal data were available.

The error of averaging over proteins was calculated from

a

where o is the root-mean-square deviation, and n is the number of pro-

teins. The error of averaging over amino acid residues was calculated
using the equation

Datasets: We used proteins with reported experimental data on protec-
tion of their separate amino acid residues against HD exchange. These
residues were divided in two groups: protected and unprotected against
HD exchange (in accordance with references below).

Amino acid sequences of the selected proteins were taken from
UniProt (www.uniprot.org). We constructed three datasets. Dataset I
contained 14 proteins and was used to test the methods (Dovidchenko
et al., 2009); Dataset II contained 21 proteins and was created to check
the quality of our method and to present a novel server for the prediction
of residues protected/unprotected against HD exchange from solely the
amino acid sequence; Dataset III included 10 proteins and was used to
compare the predictions with experimental mass spectrometry results
(Suvorina et al., 2012). For proteins from Datasets I and II, we used
experimental results obtained for amide backbone protons only, while
for Dataset III all exchangeable protons were considered. In case there
were several sets of experimental data available for one protein, we pre-
ferred the set obtained in conditions closest to native.

Dataset I contained the data for the following proteins (pdb codes are
given in parenthesis): oz-Lactalbumin from Bos taurus (1F6R) (Wijesinha—

et al., 1993). The sequences with exchange-protected amino acid residues,
as shown experimentally, are given in Supplementary Dataset 1 and all
predicted data are given in Data_for_Dataset1.

amino acid residues, as shown experimentally, are given in Supplemen-
tary Dataset 2.

The amino acid sequences of 10 proteins included in Dataset III are
listed in Table 3. The identities of proteins used in the different sets are
given in the Supplementary material, H-D_exchange.xls.

Mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry analysis of amino acids:
HD exchange was initiated by diluting amino acids (Sigma, USA) in 98%
D20 (pD=3.0). The incubation time was one day. The solution con-
tained 10‘9 mol/ul amino acid. After HD exchange, the samples were
analyzed on an ion trap LCQ Deca XP Plus (Thermo Finnigan, USA)
using electrospray ionization. The sample volume varied from 10 to 15 11.1.
The ﬂow rate did not exceed 2 til/min. Mass spectra were accumulated at
positive ions mode from 50 to 220 m/z, at capillary voltage 1.7—2.3 kV,
and entrance capillary temperature of 220°C. Fragmentation of amino
acids was performed by collision-activated dissociation. MS/MS—spectra
were registered at isolation width of the parent ion of 10 m/z. The normal-
ized collision energy varied from 25% to 30%. The average number of
exchangeable protons was calculated using the following equation:

8
<n> = Zi-Pi/100 (7)
i=1
where iis the number of exchangeable protons (the maximal value can be
8 for arginine), P,- is the probability for the state with i exchangeable
protons.

Mass spectrometric analysis of protein: We used 20 mM solution of am-
monium acetate (Panreac), pH 6.8, as a buffer system to prepare protein
solutions. All buffer solutions were prepared using deionized water and
deuterated water (D20 content was 98%).

The proteins were desalted by dialysis against a buffer solution of
20 mM ammonium acetate, pH 6.8. We used a dialysis membrane of
10 kDa (Serva, Germany) for dialysis of protein samples.

The reaction of HD exchange in proteins started with dilution (1:5)
of DzO-containing buffer. The remaining non-deuterium water was
removed using gel ﬁltration on microcolumns produced in the
laboratory. Sefadex G-10 (40—120um granules, Pharrnacia Fine
Chemicals, Sweden) was used as a matrix for microcolumn packing.
Protein solution (5 ul) with a concentration from 1 to 3mg/ml was
applied onto a column, equilibrated with 10 mM ammonium acetate,
pH 6.8, prepared using deuterium water. The columns were centrifuged
at 2000 rpm for 2—5 min (Eppendorf, Germany). The average number of
protons that were subject to HD exchange was determined by mass
spectrometry.

The mass spectrometric analysis of proteins was performed using an
ion trap LCQ Deca XP Plus (Thermo Finnigan, USA). Ionization of
samples was carried out by direct infusion of nanoelectrospray. The
sample volume varied from 10 to 15 ul. The voltage supplied to capillary
varied from 1 to 1.5 kV. The temperature of the entrance capillary varied
from 220 to 245°C. The mass spectra were registered at positive ions from
500 to 2000 m/z and from 500 to 4000 m/z. The coarse resolution and low
dynamic range of the used mass spectrometer led to increased reading
spread for ions with a low relative concentration. Calculation of the
average mass using such peaks could result in an increased calculation
error. Therefore, to calculate the average mass, we used peaks with amp-
litudes of >60%. At the same time, we used all signiﬁcant peaks for
calculation of the charge state of ions with the corresponding mass-to-
charge ratio (m/z). The error of measurements was ~5%.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Assessment of the method for 35 proteins

On the assumption that an amide proton exchanges for a deu-
terium, provided it is sufﬁciently ﬂexible and accessible to solv-
ent, we considered the number of inter-residue contacts and H-
bonding energy to be indicative of such a possibility. The number
of inter-residue contacts shows how tightly the amino acid resi-
due in question is surrounded by other amino acid residues,
thereby revealing the extent of accessibility of the amide
proton to solvent (the more contacts, the less accessibility). H-
bonding energy points to the presence and strength of inter-resi-
due H-bonds; hydrogen involved there does not participate in
HD exchange. Besides, we sought for characteristics of amino
acid residues derived not from the protein 3D structure but solely
from their sequence. Speciﬁcally, we used the expected number
of contacts per residue (Galzitskaya et al., 2006) and the prob-
ability of H-bonding (SaVitski et al., 2007).

We were the ﬁrst to compile in two datasets HD exchange data
for 35 proteins with known rates of the native state out-exchange
(Supplementary datasets). One of these (Dataset I) included 14
single-domain proteins or separate domains of multi-domain
proteins; it served for ﬁnding the threshold of the method used
here. The proteins involved were not large in size (from 56 to 155
amino acid residues) and contained 563 amino acid residues pro-
tected against HD exchange, 667 unprotected ones and 110 resi-
dues for which the degree of protection was not determined
(these were mainly proline residues without the amide proton).
Solely on the basis of the amino acid sequence, we determined H-
bond predictor sensitivity and speciﬁcity as 0.59 and 0.65, re-
spectively (Fig. la) and those of the contact predictor as 0.69
and 0.54 (Fig. lc).

Figure la shows the threshold-depending changes in H-bond-
ing predictor sensitivity and speciﬁcity. It should be noted that
we did not choose the optimal value of the threshold. For the H-
bonding predictor, the maximal Q2 coincides with the threshold
determined previously for prediction of amyloidogenic regions in
the members of another database containing 144 amyloid form-
ing peptides and 263 non-amyloid forming peptides (see our
server FoldAmyloid (Garbuzynskiy et al., 2010) at http://
bioinfo.protres.ru/fold-amyloid/oga.cgi), which points to applic-
ability of this threshold to different tasks.

For the predictor of expected number of contacts, the max-
imum is wide (Fig. 1c); a threshold of 20.4 practically coincides
not only with this maximum but also with the threshold used in
search for protein disordered regions by FoldUnfold (Galzitskaya
et al., 2006) (see our server http://bioinfo.protres.ru/ogu/).

According to our assumption, ﬂexible regions, which—due to
their ﬂexibility—can contact with solvent, are accessible for HD
exchange; regions with irregular secondary structure can be
attributed to such ﬂexible regions; therefore, the type of the sec-
ondary structure points to amino acid residues that are not pro-
tected against HD exchange. Additionally, in water-soluble
globular proteins (all proteins in our datasets are like that), the
regions with irregular secondary structure, as a rule, are situated
on the surface of a protein globule, i.e. are accessible to solvent.
When predicting HD exchange-protected/unprotected residues
from the secondary structure, we considered those involved in
regular structural elements (oz-helices, ,8—strands) as protected,

speciﬁcity for Dataset I (a) and Dataset II 0)) as predicted by the
H-bonding—based method. The vertical line at 0.695 separates protected

and the ones from irregular regions as unprotected. The type of
the secondary structure was predicted using the standard pro-
gram PsiPred (Jones, 1999). The sensitivity and speciﬁcity for
this predictor are 0.65 and 0.62, respectively.

We created an artiﬁcial predictor as a fraction of protected
residues for each type of amino acid residues using 14 proteins
from Dataset I.

In Dataset II, 992 amino acid residues are protected against
HD exchange, 1393 amino acid residues are unprotected and for
83 residues the degree of protection was not determined. For the
H-bonding predictor, sensitivity and speciﬁcity are 0.53 and 0.71,
respectively (Fig. lb). Those for the contact predictor are 0.71
and 0.54, respectively (Fig. 1d). For the artiﬁcial predictor, the
values are 0.58 and 0.63, respectively. Therefore, for the two
datasets we obtained similar results.

We performed the cross validation test for all 35 proteins. The
ACC, sensitivity and speciﬁcity proved to be practically the same
for the whole set of 35 proteins and for each of two subsets of 18
and 17 proteins taken at random (Table l and Supplementary
Material, H-D_exchange.xls).

A schematic representation of predictions made from the
amino acid sequence is shown in Figure 2 for protein CI2. As
follows from experimental data, some loop regions are capable of
HD exchange, while others are not. Speciﬁcally, among the latter
we see the N-terminal loop (amino acid residues 27—30) of CI2.
Thus, loops can be divided into available (ﬂexible) and unavail-
able (rigid) for HD exchange.

3.2 Mass spectrometry data for amino acids

Until now there have been no experimental data about HD ex-
change for free amino acids. We bridged this gap using mass
spectrometry. The tandem mass spectrometry technique allowed
neutralizing contribution of the N-terminal group -NH3 to HD
exchange. Fragments lacking -NH3 were obtained for arginine,
asparagine, glutamine, lysine, tyrosine and tryptophan (Table 2).
For all of them, relative distribution of the number of exchange-
able protons was calculated (Table 2). Statistical distribution of
HD exchange was calculated taking into account contribution of
natural isotopes. Fragments without the C-terminal group were
obtained for aspartic and glutamic acids, threonine, serine and
histidine. It should be noted that hydrogens belonging to atom N
exchange with higher probability than those of atom O. For
glutamic and aspartic acids without C-terminus, as well as for
lysine without -NH3, the average number of exchangeable pro-
tons is close to zero. Moreover, asparagine showed a smaller
average number of exchangeable protons than glutamine
(Table 2). This may be explained by the difference in their struc-
tures: glutamine has an additional CH2 group in its side chain.
This subtle difference gives considerable distinctions in their bio-
logical activities.

For aspartic acid, glutamic acid, histidine, serine and threo-
nine, the average number of exchangeable protons was

 

(upper values) and unprotected residues. The same changes as predicted
by the contact-based method: (c), Dataset I; (d), Dataset II. The vertical
line at 20.4 separates protected (upper values) and unprotected residues.
The averaging frame size was 3

the C-terminus was lacking. To exclude the inﬂuence of the both
termini, another set of mass spectrometry experiments on frag-
ments with modiﬁed termini is required.

3.3 Comparison of mass spectrometry and prediction data
for 10 proteins

Our additional goal was to assess whether the obtained bioinfor-
matics data were applicable for predicting the behavior of pro-
teins in solution. For this purpose, we made a mass spectrometry
analysis of HD exchange in 10 proteins and compared its results
with our predictions.

Proton and deuterium occupations of amide and indole groups
were characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance to show the
behaviour of separate amino acid residues in terms of HD ex-
change analyzed by mass spectrometry (Suvorina et al., 2012).
The increments of the average mass in D20 were measured after
15min and 1 day incubation of 10 protein samples (Table 3).

Here we present the recalculated numbers of protons
exchanged for deuterium in side chains of amino acid residues
predicted as unprotected. To do so, we compared the predicted

numbers with mass spectrometry results ﬁrst obtained for free
amino acids (Table 2). Speciﬁcally, our mass spectrometry ex-
periments showed that lysine predicted to exchange three protons
had zero exchangeable protons, while asparagine and glutamine
had one and two, respectively, instead of predicted two for each
of them. Glutamic acid and aspartic acid are believed to ex-
change one proton each, but the extremely low probability of
the event makes us consider the number as zero (Table 2). It
should be noted that arginine capable of exchanging ﬁve protons
in reality exchanges about 3, as shown experimentally. Serine,
threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine and histidine are to exchange one
proton each, whereas in reality we observed one exchangeable
proton per side group.

The number of deuteration sites predicted by our method is in
good agreement with the experimentally found protein mass
increment in the course of HD exchange (Table 3). For the
H-bonding predictor, the correlation coefﬁcient is 0.73; for the
contact predictor, it is 0.47; for the artiﬁcial predictor, it is 0.66,
and prediction from the secondary structure had it equal to 0.33.
It should be noted that the correlation coefﬁcients were calcu-
lated for normalized protein lengths to exclude the length effect
on the correlation. The theoretical results based on H-bonding
are in a better agreement with mass spectrometry measurements
of increased protein mass after long incubation in D20 than
those based on the expected number of contacts. However, the
latter are closer to experimental results obtained after 15min
incubation in D20. So, exchangeable protons from the surface
of a globule or unstructured regions of the chain are better pre-
dicted by the contact predictor. In its turn, prediction based on
the H-bonding statistics is more accurate for exchangeable pro-
tons from the groups in contact with the solvent during a long-
term incubation.

4 THE H-PROTECTION SERVER

To predict the status (protected/unprotected against HD
exchange) of a residue and the number of exchangeable protons
on the basis of solely the amino acid sequence of a protein, we
use three predictors: the expected number of contacts, the prob-
ability of H-bonding within the backbone amide group and an

propriate value was assigned to the amino acid residue in ques-
tion. Then these values were averaged using a shifting window.
The H-protection web server is available at http://bioinfo.pro
tres.ru/ogp/. Using the entered amino acid sequence, the server
produces a proﬁle of expected contacts or that of probable
H-bonding for each residue to be described in terms of its pro-
tection against HD exchange. Residues with a number of pre-
dicted contacts above the cut-off point (20.4 intraprotein
contacts per residue) are shown as protected, and those with a
smaller number as unprotected. Similarly, residues with H-bond-
ing probability above the cut-off point (0.695) are predicted as
protected, while those with a probability below this threshold are
shown as unprotected against HD exchange (Fig. 3).

To calculate the number of exchangeable protons of unpro-
tected residue side groups, we used the tabulated experimental

topology that has a dominant effect over the exchange kinetics
(Craig et al., 2011).

ABSTRACT

Motivation: In biomedical research transcriptomic, proteomic or
metabolomic profiles of patient samples are often combined with
genomic profiles from experiments in cell lines or animal models.
Integrating experimental data with patient data is still a challenging
task due to the lack of tailored statistical tools.

Results: Here we introduce guided clustering, a new data integration
strategy that combines experimental and clinical high-throughput
data. Guided clustering identifies sets of genes that stand out
in experimental data while at the same time display coherent
expression in clinical data. We report on two potential applications:
The integration of clinical microarray data with (i) genome-wide
chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and (ii) with cell perturbation
assays. Unlike other analysis strategies, guided clustering does not
analyze the two datasets sequentially but instead in a single joint
analysis. In a simulation study and in several biological applications,
guided clustering performs favorably when compared with sequential
analysis approaches.

Availability: Guided clustering is available as a R-package
from http://compdiag.uni-regensburg.de/software/guidedClustering
.shtml. Documented R code of all our analysis is included in the
Supplementary Materials. All newly generated data are available at
the GEO database (GSE29700).

1 INTRODUCTION

Today, molecular proﬁling technologies allow the characterization
of clinical biopsies which capture complementary cellular properties
including genotype, methylation state, transcriptome, proteome
and metabolome snapshots. Moreover, the same technologies are
used in experiments with cell lines or primary cell cultures
where they are complemented by chromatin immunoprecipitation
assays like ChIP—seq, protein—protein interaction screens or protein
localization assays. Each proﬁling technology sheds different, and
partly complementary light on the functioning and malfunctioning of
cells. However, their joint full potential can only be realized when
the two information sources are combined. Thus, integrating data
from different sources is an important part of modern biomedical
research. An important aspect of data integration is the development

of tailored statistical methods that are able to leverage knowledge
contained within a diverse range of data sources and at the same
time, being able to provide evidence to answer the types of question
being posed by the research community as a whole. While the
concept of statistical data integration is self evident, its realization
in genomics is challenging. Obstacles include the heterogeneity
of experimental setups, study designs, proﬁling platforms, sample
handling and data management. Furthermore, missing metadata
and insufﬁcient documentation of heuristic and complex multistep
analysis procedures complicate the endeavor.

Heterogeneities can in part be overcome by data integration
on the level of gene lists [Beissbarth and Speed (2004), PaVlidis
et al. (2002), Subramanian et al. (2005)]. All datasets are analyzed
individually and gene sets or ranked list of genes are produced.
In a subsequent meta—analysis step, the studies are integrated by
detecting signiﬁcant overlaps of gene—sets (Beissbarth and Speed,
2004), enrichment of genes sets in ranked lists (Subramanian et al.,
2005) or similarities of multiple ranked lists (Lottaz et al., 2006).
This strategy avoids the need for joint quantitative data models
that describe the dependencies between individual quantitative
proﬁles. A quantitative approach is the concatenation of feature
vectors from different platforms in the context of classiﬁcation
problems. If several types of high—dimensional readouts are available
for the same group of samples, predictive signatures can be
constructed by combining selected features across all data types,
thus exploring potential complementary information. Somewhat
surprisingly, several authors observed only marginal improvements
in classiﬁcation accuracy resulting from data integration [B oulesteix
et al. (2008), Lu et al. (2005)].

In complementary work, data integration has been used to
aggregate information across clinical and experimental sample
populations rather than platforms. Bild et al. (2006) combined data
generated experimentally by overexpression of active oncogenes
in non—malignant breast epithelial cells with tumor samples of
various carcinomas. Signatures of pathway activation were learnt
on the primary cell culture data and applied to tumor proﬁles
for predicting pathway activation status, outcome and treatment
efﬁciency of the cancer samples. The exact opposite sequential
analysis strategy is described by L'auter et al. (2009). The authors
start their analysis on the clinical data by identifying clusters of
strongly coexpressed genes, which they subsequently test for joint
differential expression between experimental conditions. Here, the
experimental data cannot inﬂuence the formation, but the selection
of gene clusters. The ﬁrst analysis approach to combine both data
sets from the outset is described in Bentink et al. (2008). Applying
a class discovery method by von Heydebreck et al. (2001) in a
semisuperVised setting, the authors ﬁnd classiﬁcations of patient

samples based on coherently expressed genes that simultaneously
separate experimental conditions.

Here, we complement and extend the approach of Bentink
et al. We introduce guided clustering a new data integration
strategy that combines experimental and clinical high—throughput
data of possibly different genomic data types. Guided clustering is
tailored to analysis scenarios, where the construction of a diagnostic
signature is not driven by class labels on the clinical data, for
instance disease types or clinical outcomes, but by a biological
focus, for example the activity of a transcription factor or an
entire pathway. The biological focus of the signature is established
by a complementing experimental study e.g. a cell perturbation
experiment. Guided clustering identiﬁes sets of genes that stand
out in the experimental data while at the same time display
coherent expression in clinical data. Different to the semisuperVised
approach of Bentink et al., guided clustering is unsupervised.
However, the feature selection that drives the clustering of patient
samples is guided by complementing experimental data. Moreover,
it extends the framework of the previous method in that it can
incorporate data from different genomic platforms and provide
quantitative predictions of pathway activation. Further the balance
between guiding and clinical data can be calibrated and tested
explicitly.

In principal, guided clustering can be applied to any data
integration problem that combines a sample clustering problem
with a feature selection problem driven by a second dataset.
Here, we report on two exemplary applications: (i) the prediction
of transcription factor activity in clinical samples guided
by a chromatin immunoprecipitation experiment and (ii) the
prediction of pathway activity guided by cell culture perturbation
experiments.

2 ALGORITHM

For clarity, we ﬁrst describe guided clustering in the application
context of oncogenic pathway activation in tumor samples, and later
describe a series of modiﬁcations that adapt the method to different
applications.

Let T,:,- be a set of tumor expression proﬁles and Gij a guiding
dataset. Rows i denotes genes while columns j denotes samples. For
simplicity, we assume that the same proﬁling platform is used and
hence the same genes are monitored in both datasets.

The guiding dataset G consists of two types of samples: cell lines
where a pathway is perturbed and the corresponding unperturbed
control. Thus it is labeled, since we know in which proﬁles the
pathway was experimentally perturbed. The label is stored in a
binary vector L , where a one marks the proﬁles from perturbed
cell lines and a zero control samples. We assume that the activity
of the pathway varies across the tumors in T due to different
genotypes. However, a priori we do not know in which tumors
the pathway is active and to what extend. The dataset T is thus
unlabeled. The activity of the pathway affects the expression of its
target genes. In general, targets can be either induced or repressed
by the pathway. Consequently, the guiding data contains genes that
are upregulated in perturbed samples relative to controls and those
that are downregulated. To simplify computation, we multiply the
expression of pathway repressed genes by —l in both datasets, such
that numerically all targets display ‘high’ expression upon pathway
activation.

2.1 Fusion of similarity matrices

Guided clustering starts by computing a matrix of pairwise gene
similarities. The gene similarities are high if two genes are strongly
correlated in T and simultaneously both genes are differentially
expressed in G. This matrix fuses the information of two other
matrices that capture gene similarity for both datasets separately.
For two genes g and h, we deﬁne AT a similarity matrix on T by the
Gaussian smoothing kernel:

(1)

—1— d ,h2
AT(g,h)=exp(%),

where d(g, h) = l —max(,0(g, h), 0) and ,0(g, h) the Spearman’s
correlation of the expression vectors of genes g and h. The bandwidth
of the Gaussian smoothing function is speciﬁed by a, and a) E [0... l]
is a tuning parameter that will help us balance the information from
both datasets. Parameter calibration will be discussed in Section 2.4.
Note that anticorrelated pairs of genes are dissimilar. Similarly, we
use G to deﬁne a diagonal similarity matrix

_ 2
wd(g,L) ) (2)

AG(g,g)=eXp( 202

where d (g, L) = l — Q(g, L) and Q(g, L) the Pearson’s correlation. This
matrix captures the correlation of gene expression with the class
label vector L. High values correspond to genes that respond to
pathway activation. Again a is the bandwidth of the smoothing
function and a) a weighting parameter that will be discussed later.
The two individual matrices are then fused by a simple matrix
multiplication:

IG/ZATAIG/2 (3)
W is a symmetric similarity matrix that holds high values only
for pairs of genes that show consistent expression in T and
simultaneously respond to pathway activation in G.

Figure 1 schematically explains the effect of matrix fusion. The
points in the left panel show a set of genes embedded in the 2D
plane. Their distance reﬂects similarity according to AT. The gray
tone encodes information from the guiding data: black points do
not show differential expression in G while gray points are targets
and the brighter the point the stronger the gene responds to pathway
perturbation. Note that all genes fall into clusters. This is typical
for expression data. Barer is any one gene regulated independently
from any other genes. The right panel shows the same genes again.
However this time, the distances are based on the fused similarity
matrix. The dark points moved out of the clusters and distribute
uniformly. The only remaining dense areas consist of bright genes
that were already close to each other in the left panel. The effect of
the matrix fusion can be Viewed as a magnetic repulsion between
genes. The less a gene responds to pathway activation, the stronger
is its repulsion from all other genes. Genes remaining in clusters
are potential pathway target genes that are consistently regulated in
tumors. We will use their consensus expression as a surrogate for
pathway activity in tumors. Figure 1 shows that the matrix fusion
induces similarities that makes clustering genes a hard problem,
since many genes are no longer in clusters but on their own.
However, we do not need to assign all genes to clusters. Instead
we aim to detect the top most densest modules of genes thus leaving
the majority of genes unassigned to any cluster.

of genes while gray shades represent the genes response to pathway
perturbation. The brighter a point, the stronger the gene responds to the

only. All genes fall in clusters, since genes are regulated in concert. (b) The
same genes as in (a), but distances are based on the fused similarity matrix
W. Genes that do not respond to the pathway moved out of the clusters and
distribute uniformly across the plane.

2.2 Extraction of tight expression modules

Along the lines of kernel density estimation, we calculate the
neighborhood density for each gene as

K(g)=ZW ,l- (4)
i=1

where n is the total number of genes in the dataset. A gene g with
a high value K (g) is located in a large and dense cluster. Guided
clustering starts by selecting the gene go that maximizes K (g) as
a seed gene. Next a module of genes C is grown around g0 using
average linkage by iteratively adding genes gk that maximize

Zijfk Wet-e,-

ICI+1 (5)

V(go,gr,---,gk—1,gk)=
where |C| is the number of genes in C. The iteration is
terminated, if no gene gk exists, such that y(g0,g1, ...,gk_1,gk)>
y(g0,g1,...,gk_1). In case we want to extract more than one
dense cluster, we remove all genes selected in the current iteration,
recompute K (g) and proceed as described above.

2.3 Condensing the joint expression of genes in a
module to a consensus expression index

By construction, the expression levels of genes in a module are
tightly correlated across tumor samples. In any tumor, they are either
unanimously up— or downregulated. This allows us to condense their
expression into a single number per tumor. This index can be used as
a surrogate for pathway activity in the tumor. A high index points to
an active pathway and a low index to an inactive pathway. Although
genes in a module correlate strongly, their raw expression can deviate
highly due to scale differences. A module can be composed of genes,
where some have a greater expression level than others. To compute
the consensus index, we use a standard additive model that accounts
for scale differences on the log scale:

yzj=M+Oti+ﬂj+6zj, (6)

where ylj is the observed expression of a gene, 05,- a gene—speciﬁc
scale coefﬁcient, ,0) the sample speciﬁc index of pathway activation
and 6)]- the error term. We ﬁt the additive model using Tuckey’s
robust median polish procedure (Hoaglin et al., 1977). In the
following, we will refer to the index as pathway activation index
(PAI). Note that our approach for summarizing the expression of
module genes to a PAI is identical to a method used to compute
probe—set summaries in the popular normalization package RMA
for Affymetrix gene chips.

2.4 Balancing both datasets

Guided clustering uses the parameter a) to balance the inﬂuence
between both datasets. While the tumor data are driving within
cluster strength, the guiding data forces genes to have a high
response to perturbation. a) shifts the focus from the clinical data
(w=0) to the guiding data (c021). Guided clustering evaluates
within cluster strength by the average pairwise correlation:

¢(w)=1/ICw|2 Z max(p(g,h),0)
g,hEC,,,

where Cw is a gene cluster retrieved for a speciﬁc a). The response
to perturbation is assessed by the average gene activation:

<0(w)=1/ICwI Z 9(g,L>.

gECw

We calculate qb(w) and g0(w) for we [0,0.1,0.2,..., 1]. Since qb(w)
and g0(w) are on different scales, we rescale them such that they
both range form 0 to 1. The algorithm chooses the a) that maximizes
the sum qb(w) —I— g0(w).

The smoothing parameter a speciﬁes the bandwidth of the
smoothing kernel and inﬂuences the sensitivity of the method. Larger
bandwidths result in larger clusters that may include genes with low
responses to perturbation. Smaller bandwidth enforce more rigorous
restrictions on the genes from the guiding data. We recommend to
tune a manually starting from a large value and decreasing it in
several steps while at the same time monitoring the cluster tightness
and the distribution of perturbation responses in the guiding data.
For our analysis, we varied a between 1/3 and 0.1/3 in steps of
0. 1 / 3. In the next section, we give an example of parameter tuning.

2.5 Extensions to other experimental settings

So far, we have discussed guided clustering in the context of a
pathway perturbation experiment with a labeled guiding dataset G. It
can be easily adapted to other application scenarios by tailoring the
similarity function in Equation (2) to the application. The similarity
values need to quantitatively rank genes that should be preferentially
used to build gene clusters. The strongest preference possible is
encoded by a value of 1. Smaller values gradually reduce the
inﬂuence of a gene. The preference scores need to be calculated
from guiding data. Many application settings are possible. The
preference score can e.g. reﬂect the connectivity of a gene in a
protein—protein interaction network, thus guiding the formation of
gene clusters seeded around hub genes. They can also reﬂect the
binding abundance of a transcription factor assessed in a chromatin
immunoprecipitation experiment, thus guiding the gene clusters to
be build from targets of a speciﬁc transcription factor. We will
demonstrate the use of guided clustering in this context in Section 4.1

2.6 Runtime

To analyze the runtime of the guided clustering algorithm, we
dissect the algorithm into its three main parts: (i) the calculation of
the pairwise gene distance matrix has a runtime of 0(n2), where
n is the number of genes. (ii) Transformation of the pairwise
gene distances into afﬁnities needs additional nw 0(n2) operations,
where nw is the number of values used for a) when choosing
the optimal weighting between both datasets. (iii) Extracting k
gene modules has a complexity of k0(n). The total complexity
0(n2)-I—nw 0(n2)—I—k0(n)=0(n2) is dominated by the number of
input genes (Supplementary Fig. 1).

All calculations have been performed on a machine containing
16 Quad—Core AMD Opteron 8354 processors with 2.2GHz each
and 132 GB main memory. At the current state of development,
guided clustering is a single thread method using 1 of 16 processors
available. For the analysis of simulated datasets used in Section 3,
each run needed 13 s on average. Analysis of the lymphoma samples
together with BCL6 and LPS data in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 took about
890 and 902 s, respectively.

3 SIMULATION-BASED VALIDATION AND
COMPARISON TO COMPETING APPROACHES

Prior to testing guided clustering in real data integration contexts,
we study its performance on data that is artiﬁcially generated
and fulﬁlls the underlying assumptions of our algorithm. This
allows us to better understand its limitations alongside those of
competing strategies. In simulations, the data generating process
deﬁnes a ground truth, against which any analysis result can be
evaluated. In real applications, we often do not have a ground truth
result. Moreover, focused simulations allow us to study individual
difﬁculties in the analysis independently from each other, while
real data usually comprises many of them in parallel. Finally, the
difﬁculty of clustering problems can be scaled freely in simulations.
Here, we compare guided clustering to the two competing sequential
analysis concepts described in the literature, which select genes sets
only using the clinical or the guiding data, respectively.

We simulate artiﬁcial data that mimics the application of guided
clustering in the context of pathway activation prediction.The data
consist of an artiﬁcial clinical dataset T with 80 samples and a
guiding dataset G with 20 control and 20 perturbed samples. The
datasets hold 1500 features. Both datasets are generated by adding
a signal component and a noise component eij:

Ti' =Flj+wT€lj7 and Gil :Iij+wG6ij'

F i]- and I i]- are the signal components that contain the ground truth
of simulated effects, and the tuning parameters wT and cm are
used to calibrate the signal to noise ratio. The noise component
6 is simulated using a multivariate normal distribution with a block
structured covariance matrix following Guo et al. (2007).

For T,:,-, we generate signals in three clusters E1,...,E3 of 200
features. To generate traces of pathway activity, we draw for
each gene in a cluster a random number or,- uniformly from the
interval [0,1], which represents the strength with which the gene
responds to pathway activation. Moreover, for every sample we
draw a uniformly distributed random number ,0) from [— 1, 1] which
represents the strength of the pathway activation in this sample. F i]-

is then set to 05,- —I—,8j. For genes that do not fall in any of the three
clusters, F ,j are set to zero.

The simulation of the guiding data Gij includes a set Bd of 600
responding genes. For each of these, we draw a random number
yl- uniformly from [0,1] and set Ii- =—)/ for control samples and
I ,j = y for perturbation samples. For the remaining genes, we set I i]-
to zero. The size of the intersection of the three clusters E with the
set of responding genes varies across clusters (200 for E1, 100 for
E2, and 50 for E3). More details are given in the Supplementary
Materials. The simulation setup is summarized in Figure 2a. Note
that we not only simulate signals and noise, but also confounding
structures including clusters of correlated genes in T that do not
correspond to induced genes in G, as well as induced genes in G
that do not form tight clusters in T.

The goal of guided clustering is to reconstruct the hidden pathway
activation signal ,0) for all samples and all three clusters accurately.
We ran guided clustering on this series of simulated datasets
with increasing difﬁculty by varying the signal—to—noise ratio of T
between 0.5 and 2 in steps of 0.1. The signal—to—noise ratio for G
is kept constant at 2. To evaluate accuracy of the estimated signals,
we calculated the maximal correlation of the top three estimated
pathway indices ,0]- to any of the ,0) underlying the simulation.

We give a detailed description of analysis results obtained for
a signal—to—noise ratio of 1. Analysis starts with calibrating the
parameter a such that the resulting clusters are strongly enriched
for genes with strong signals from the guiding data. We start with
a large value of o and consecutively lower it while monitoring the
distribution of signals from the guiding data. Figure 2b shows that
with 020.23, a good balance was found. a was kept constant for
all other analyzes.

A characteristic feature of guided clustering is the simultaneous
use of both datasets. In order to evaluate its beneﬁts, we compare
guided clustering to the two possible sequential analysis concepts,
namely gene selection based on experimental data followed by
pathway activity prediction on the clinical data as described by
Bild et al. (2006), and gene selection via identiﬁcation of strongly
correlated gene—sets in the clinical data followed by multivariate
tests in the experimental data as described by L'auter et al.
(2009).

Figure 2d shows the results for estimating the pathway indices of
the three simulated effects (E1 solid, E2 dotted, E3 dashed line).
Guided clustering reconstructs the pathway indices correctly for
signal—to—noise ratio 2 1. However, the smaller the overlap between
the correlated clusters in T and the differentially expressed genes
in G, the more difﬁcult the reconstruction. The approach by L'auter
et al. reconstructs the signals perfectly since we provided it with
the correct gene—sets. Using the approach of Bild et al. results in
a poor reconstruction quality. The method is only able to coarsely
reconstruct the cluster with the biggest overlap. We believe that the
ignorance of the correlation structure in T that this method exercises
when constructing gene—sets compromises its performance in signal
reconstruction.

Additionally, we tested the gene—sets for joint differential
expression on G. Here, the approach of L'auter et al. (2009) only
identiﬁes effects in gene—sets where the majority of contributing
genes are differently expressed within the guiding data. It does not
ﬁlter non—responding genes since it does not access the guiding data
during gene—set formation. Guided clustering reliably detected gene—
sets with differential expression in G. The approach of Bild et al.

4 APPLICATIONS

Guided clustering identiﬁes sets of genes that stand out in the
experimental data while at the same time display coherent expression
in clinical data. This general setting allows for the application of
guided clustering in many different situations. Here, we choose two
of them: (i) the detection of functional targets of a transcription factor
and the quantitative estimation of its activity in individual clinical
samples; (ii) the estimation of pathway activities in tumor samples
as introduced by Bild et al. (2006) using a cell line stimulation
experiment.

4.1 Guided clustering identiﬁes BCL6 activity as a
strong prognostic factor in diffuse large B-cell
lymphomas and suggests a link between BCL6 and
the activity of Toll-like receptor pathways

BCL6 is a transcription factor that predominantly acts as a repressor
of transcription. In mature B—cells, BCL6 is required for the
formation of germinal centers (GC). Hence, its function is critical
for the working of the acquired immune system. However in
diffuse large B—cell lymphomas (DLBCL), BCL6 is frequently
translocated, hypermutated and hypermethylated. Its dysfunctional
activity is assumed to contribute to oncogenesis in a subset of
DLBCL and potentially also in different malignancies (Iqbal et al.,
2007). DLBCL is a morphologically, genetically and clinically
heterogeneous lymphoma entity (WHO, 2008) with several deﬁned
subentities (Bentink et al., 2008; Rosenwald et al., 2002) and most
likely more. Whether differential BCL6 activity contributes to the
heterogeneity is not fully known.

Recently, the inﬂuence of BCL6 on the transcriptional program
of B cells was investigated (Ci et al., 2009). The authors performed
a ChIP—on—chip screen with primary human GC B—cells and
the DLBCL cell lines OCI—Lyl and OCI—Ly7 using high—density
oligonucleotide promotor microarrays. These data were combined
with gene expression proﬁles from DLBCL. The authors followed
a strictly sequential analysis strategy: ﬁrst only the ChIP data were
used to identify distinct groups of genes bound by BCL6 exclusively
in GC B cells, DLBCL or both. Second, a look up of these genes in
the tumor data revealed that a large number of BCL6 target genes
are silenced in primary human centroblasts compared with na'r've
B cells. But only half of those genes are also silenced in DLBCL.
Additionally, BCL6 target genes have a lower expression in GC
B cell—like (GCB) lymphomas compared with activated B cell—like
(ABC) lymphomas. DLBCL and its subentities GCB and ABC were
analyzed as lymphoma populations. The variability of BCL6 target
expression across individual lymphomas was not addressed. In fact,
we observed that the expression of the top ranking genes in DLBCL
is rather disperse (Fig. 3a).

This observation is not surprising: genome—wide chromatin
immunoprecipitation assays identify binding sites of transcription
factors in the neighborhood of genes and thus generate lists of
potential targets of the transcription factor. Clearly, binding does

needed for transcription and their presence depends on the cellular
context. However, if a transcription factor like BCL6 actively

regulates a module of target genes in a deﬁned cellular context like
the DLBCL context, its functional targets should display correlated
expression across clinical samples. The heterogeneity of DLBCL
poses an additional problem, since it is not clear whether there
is only a single ‘DLBCL context’. The expression and activation
of transcriptional co—regulators might vary across DLBCL and we
might ﬁnd multiple modules of functional BCL6 targets, each
expressed in different subsets of DLBCL.

Using guided clustering, we integrated BCL6 ChIP—on—chip data
of GC B cells from Ci et al. (2009) GEO accession: GSE15179
with 220 expression proﬁles from DLBCL and Burkitt lymphoma
samples from Hummel et al. (2006) GEO—accession: GSE4475.
Afﬁmetrix gene expression data were normalized using the variance
stabilization method (Huber et al., 2002) and probe—sets were
summarized to gene expression values by ﬁtting a standard additive

model, employing Tuckey’s median polish algorithm (Hoaglin et al.,
1977). For the ChIP—on—chip data, log2 ratios were averaged across
all three replicates after truncating ratios above the 95% quantile
of all positive log2 ratios (W 2.67). Locus by locus, we subtracted
the log2 ratios from their maximum across samples and fed these
values directly into the guided clustering algorithm. BCL6 binding
loci were matched to HGU133a probe—sets using the accession
numbers and refseq ids provided by the authors. Multiple probe—
sets for the same locus were summarized using the median polish
algorithm. After matching, the dataset consisted of 9648 genes and
220 samples.

On this data, we ran guided clustering and identiﬁed the top
three modules of BCL6 targets each expressed predominantly in
a different subset of lymphomas. The smoothing parameter was
selected as described in Section 2.4 and set to 020.23.

Genomic data integration using guided clustering

 

Figure 3e shows the expression of the extracted gene modules
across lymphomas. Note that the genes are coherently expressed
across lymphomas and there is a continuous gradient when
lymphomas are arranged by increasing BCL6 indices. Figure 3b
shows that these genes also have strikingly large log2 ratios,
indicating that BCL6 indeed binds their promotor. Together, both
plots conﬁrm that the two datasets are in good balance. In agreement
to the observations of Ci et al. (2009), the second extracted index
(BCL6—index2) is higher in ABC than GCB type DLBCL (P < 10—9,
t—test).

To test for a clinical impact of BCL6 activity in DLBCL, we
ﬁtted a cox proportional hazard model including the BCL6—index
from module 2 as a continuous covariate and established categorical
prognostic factors like the ABC/GCB status, age >59 years and
Ann Arbor stage. Survival analysis was restricted to a group
of patients that received identical treatment [a combination of
chemotherapy based on cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine
and prednisone (CHOP) or similar]. This was the case for 80
lymphoma patients in the study. We found the BCL6—index2 to be a
signiﬁcant independent predictor of survival (P <10_5). Patients
with a high BCL6—index2 have a better outcome than patients
with a low index. Notably, the hazard associated with the BCL6—
index2 is higher than all other factors including the AB C/GCB status
(Supplementary Table S2).

The BCL6—index2 accumulates the expression of 335 genes
including several BCL6 targets that were also described in the
primary analysis of the dataset by Ci et al. (2009) (Supplementary
Table S4). We analyzed this gene—set for enrichment of genes
involved in certain aspects of B—cell functionality or malignant
transformation using the Gene Set Analysis Toolkit V2 by Duncan
et al. (2010). Genes involved in Toll—like receptor signaling were
signiﬁcantly enriched (P < 0.004, hypergeometric test); similarly,
we found enrichment of Jak—STAT signaling genes (P<0.001,
hypergeometric test). These observations support the ﬁndings
of Basso and Dalla—Favera (2010) who hypothesize that BCL6
modulates signaling through Toll—like receptors.

4.2 LPS mediated Toll-like receptor signaling and
BCL6 targets are coherently expressed
in DLBCL

To support the hypothesis of Basso and Dalla—Favera (2010)
experimentally, we stimulated cells from the BL—2 lymphoma cell
line with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 6h, thus stimulating Toll—
like receptor signaling. Expression proﬁles of stimulated cells
were compared to control proﬁles of unstimulated BL—2 cells. The
expression proﬁles were generated on Affymetrix HGU133plus2
GeneChips and were normalized as described above and matched
to both the lymphoma and BCL6 datasets through the accession
numbers from Ci et al. (2009). Altogether six samples were
hybridized, three independent biological replicates in each group.
A detailed description of the sample preparation can be found in the
Supplementary Material. These expression proﬁles are available at
the GEO database (GSE29700).

We used guided clustering for a joint analysis of our stimulation
data and the lymphoma dataset by Hummel et al. (2006). This is a
typical application of guided clustering in the context of integrating
experimental cell perturbation data and clinical expression studies.
In contrast to ChIP assays, cell perturbation experiments can identify

functional targets of signaling pathways. However, they are not
conﬁned to direct targets. Transcriptional regulation is context
speciﬁc and the molecular contexts of a cell culture signiﬁcantly
differs from that of a tumor. Nevertheless, if genes whose expression
respond in the cell culture context also display a coherent expression
across patient proﬁles, it is likely that their consensus expression
reﬂects the activity of this pathway in individual patient probes
(Bentink et al., 2008). We applied guided clustering to identify
transcriptional modules that are conserved between both cellular
contexts. The smoothing parameter was selected as described in
Section 2.4 and set to o = 0.17. As inthe BCL6 analysis, we extracted
the top three modules and examined them for cluster tightness
in the lymphoma data and differential expression in the guiding
data. Figure 3f shows heatmaps of the extracted gene modules on
the clinical data. The genes are coherently expressed across the
lymphomas and form a continuous gradient when the lymphomas are
arranged by increasing LPS indices. The distribution of correlations
to the class label vector for module genes and non—module genes
are shown in Figure 3d. The module genes stand out and are clearly
enriched for LPS stimulation.

Strikingly, the LPS—index2 and our BCL6—index2 although
derived from completely different guiding datasets and only
intersecting in 73 of 198 genes (Supplementary Table S5) are almost
perfectly correlated (r > 0.98). This further supports the hypothesis
that BCL6, in fact, modulates Toll—like receptor signaling in DLB CL.
Moreover, our analysis captures this link quantitatively. The higher a
lymphoma expresses direct BCL6 targets, the higher it also expresses
LPS—inducible genes. While many explanations for this correlation
can be taken into account, the easiest of them is the modulation of
Toll—like receptor signaling through BCL6.

5 CONCLUSION

We introduce guided clustering, a new method for the combined
analysis of clinical microarray gene expression data and
experimental data. Our method is controlled by two parameters a)
and a. While a) is selected automatically, 0 has to be speciﬁed
by the user. With the help of these parameters, guided clustering
circumvents the need for crisp cutoffs of gene lists and clusters
used by most competing methods. Even though both parameters
are chosen based on the training data, they are not tuned to
enhance any ﬁt. Their purpose is to balance the inﬂuence of both
datasets. In fact, we did not observe any overﬁtting phenomenon in
simulations with separate test and training data (data not shown).
Guided clustering is ﬂexible and can be adapted to various data
integration challenges. Here, we applied it in the context of a study
on DLBCL that was guided to focus on aspects of BCL6 and Toll—
like receptor signaling. We could establish a novel prognostic index
in DLBCL, which holds more prognostic information than existing
predictors of survival. The composition of the genes underlying
this index point to a link between BCL6 activity and Toll—like
receptor signaling. We experimentally strengthened this link by
an LPS stimulation experiment combined with a second guided
clustering analysis. We observed that targets of LPS—mediated Toll—
like receptor signaling, and BCL6 targets are coherently expressed
in a large collection of DLBCL, suggesting that BCL6 in fact
inﬂuences the transcriptional program by Toll—like receptor signaling
in DLBCL.

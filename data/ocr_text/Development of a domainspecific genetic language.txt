ABSTRACT

Motivation: Expression vectors used in different biotechnology ap-
plications are designed with domain-specific rules. For instance, pro-
moters, origins of replication or homologous recombination sites are
host-specific. Similarly, chromosomal integration or viral delivery of an
expression cassette imposes specific structural constraints. As de
novo gene synthesis and synthetic biology methods permeate many
biotechnology specialties, the design of application-specific expres-
sion vectors becomes the new norm. In this context, it is desirable to
formalize vector design strategies applicable in different domains.
Results: Using the design of constructs to express genes in the
chloroplast of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as an example, we show
that a vector design strategy can be formalized as a domain-specific
language. We have developed a graphical editor of context-free gram-
mars usable by biologists without prior exposure to language theory.
This environment makes it possible for biologists to iteratively improve
their design strategies throughout the course of a project. It is also
possible to ensure that vectors designed with early iterations of the
language are consistent with the latest iteration of the language.

is part of the GenoCAD application. A public instance of GenoCAD is

able from SourceForge and licensed under the Apache v2.0 open

1 INTRODUCTION

Most bioinformatics software packages include sequence editors
that facilitate the design and assembly of new DNA sequences.
Automatic recognition of sequence features, identiﬁcation of re-
striction sites and tools to add sequence annotations help biolo-
gists visualize the different elements of the DNA sequences they
manipulate. Software lets users switch between graphical repre-
sentations of DNA sequences that provide a macroscopic view
and textual representations more suitable to examine sequences
with a base-level resolution. Irrespective of the software environ-
ment used, the cut-and-paste approach to sequence editing in-
creases the chance of introducing errors, such as leaving or

deleting a DNA segment, accidently inserting it twice or truncat-
ing a functional element. For a large multigene construct (e. g. an
expression cassette encoding all components of a biochemical
pathway), these risks could become unacceptably high. In
many cases, errors are uncovered only after several months of
unsuccessful attempts to express a gene.

Many of these errors can be avoided by developing a library of
genetic parts before designing DNA sequences. The Registry of
Standard Biological Parts (Peccoud et al., 2008) was the ﬁrst
database of genetic parts. The notion of genetic parts supports
a different approach to sequence design: complex genetic con-
structs can be designed using drag-and-drop user interfaces that
rely on icons to represent different categories of genetic parts
(Villalobos et al., 2006). This added level of abstraction makes
it easier to understand the structure of a new sequence. It also
avoids sequence manipulation errors. However, it still makes it
possible to design sequences lacking components required for
proper gene expression.

We demonstrated that the structure of many gene expression
vectors can be modeled as context-free grammars (Cai et al.,
2007). GenoCAD, a web-based application to design synthetic
DNA sequences, relies on the notion of ‘grammars’ to organize
large collections of genetic parts (Cai et al., 2010). It also includes
a wizard-like sequence editor that guides users through a series of
design decisions corresponding to the rewriting rules of a gram-
mar selected by the user (Czar et al., 2009).

Initially, users could only choose from a set of public gram-
mars when designing sequences. These public grammars were
developed by manually adding records in the GenoCAD back-
end database. The process was tedious and only GenoCAD ad-
ministrators familiar with the application data model could
develop new grammars. These early grammars were interesting
as proof of concepts, but they did not necessarily reﬂect the
design rules that users wished to use for speciﬁc research projects.

We have now formalized the grammar development process
and developed a graphical user interface enabling life scientists to
develop context-free grammars. The GenoCAD grammar editor
allows users to revise existing grammars or even to develop
brand-new grammars. These grammars can be fairly generic to
generate a broad range of expression vectors for a new host.
Alternatively, they can be made speciﬁc to capture project-
speciﬁc design constraints, such as the ones resulting from
intellectual property licensing agreements. These languages
describing families of synthetic DNA molecules are comparable
with domain-speciﬁc languages (DSL) used in computer pro-
gramming. Specialized DSLs facilitate communication between

programmers and domain experts by directly expressing concepts
speciﬁc to the domain. The Structured Query Language (SQL) is
an example of a DSL used for programming databases.

The design of vectors to express polycistronic genes in the
chloroplast of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is an example of a
domain that calls for the development of a DSL. Site-speciﬁc
gene insertion into Chlamydomonas chloroplast can be per-
formed through homologous recombination, making it an at-
tractive system to study processes such as photosynthesis. It
has been previously shown that recombinant protein can accu-
mulate at much higher levels when expressed in the chloroplast
genome of Chlamydomonas compared with the nuclear genome
(Franklin et al., 2002). Also its generally oxidizing environment
makes the formation of disulﬁde bonds possible, hence enabling
expression of large complex proteins such as full-length antibo-
dies (Mayﬁeld et al., 2003). Owing to these characteristics,
Chlamydomonas chloroplast recently gained much attention as
a venue for recombinant protein production (Rasala and
Mayﬁeld, 2011).

Interestingly, Chlamydomonas chloroplast is capable of carry-
ing out anaerobic reactions such as hydrogen production under
well-studied speciﬁc circumstances, despite its generally oxidizing
environment (Esquivel et al., 2011; Hemschemeier et al., 2009).
Also, Chlamydomonas chloroplast genome has a prokaryotic ar-
rangement, encoding both mono- and polycistronic genes, which
offers the potential for introduction of polycistronic synthetic
expression cassettes like in bacteria (Drapier et al., l998).These
characteristics make Chlamydomonas chloroplast an attractive
venue to introduce genes required for nitrogen ﬁxation, as (i)
appropriate stoichiometry between the components is essential,
which can be better controlled in a system that allows expression
from polycistronic operons and homologous recombination; (ii)
high level of expression is essential due to the slow kinetics of
nitrogenase; and (iii) even though such a state is transient, anae-
robicity can be achieved. Yet, the DSLs that are available for
bacterial synthetic constructs would not be sufﬁcient because in
many cases the exact locations of regulatory components are not
known. For example, ribosomal binding sequences (RBSs) are
not characterized for most of the genes, and it is predicted that
the translational initiation is more complex than the ancestry
bacterial system. This necessitates more ﬂexibility than a
simple promoter-RBS-coding sequence (CDS) arrangement
found in synthetic constructs for bacteria; in some cases, it is
not practical to separate the promoter from 5’ untranslated
region sequence that potentially includes RBS and other regula-
tory elements. Undoubtedly, the expression of multiple genes
from a complex polycistronic unit would require empirical opti-
mization of genetic parts through biological assays, hence a rapid
method to assemble multiple parts without risk of introducing
sequence mistakes is highly beneﬁcial.

2 SYSTEM AND METHODS

2.1 Accessing the grammar editor

The context-free grammar editor can be accessed from GenoCAD’s Parts
module by choking on the Parts header, then the Grammars tab from the
left-hand navigation bar. This displays a list of the grammars available in
the system, deﬁned as either public grammars (the ones anyone can use
and view) or user grammars (those that belong to the logged-in user).

From this list, users can select a grammar from the list on the left and
see a summary of the selected grammar on the right, including a descrip-
tion of the grammar, the number of categories and rules that deﬁne the
grammar and the number of libraries and parts associated with that
grammar.

2.2 Category definition

The grammar development process starts by declaring categories of gen-
etic parts, such as promoters, transcription terminators or coding se-
quences. Each category needs an alphanumeric code. By convention,
three or four capital letters such as PRO for promoter or TER for ter-
minator work well. In addition, the category needs to be deﬁned by
providing a short text description of the type of genetic element corres-
ponding to the category. An optional ﬁeld is available to associate the
category with a speciﬁc GenBank qualiﬁer. This is used to ensure that
parts in that category will be properly annotated when exporting expres-
sion vectors as GenBank ﬁles. Finally, the software allows users to select
an icon that will be used to represent parts of this category in the
GenoCAD design tool.

All new GenoCAD grammars come with a set of predeﬁned reserved
categories. The ﬁrst is the start category (S), which is the default root to
the hierarchical rules tree; it is required in the grammar deﬁnition that
one category be designated as the root, but it is possible to designate a
separate category to fulﬁll this role. The other reserved categories are
used as sequence delimiters. Brackets are used to indicate the orientation
of a DNA sequence, parentheses are used to delimit plasmids in con-
structs that involve more than one plasmid and braces are used to delimit
chromosomes in genome design projects.

2.3 Rule declaration

As soon as a few categories have been declared, it is possible to start
declaring rewriting rules. The rules can be added by means of a drag-and-
drop interface that allows the user to pull categories from a list on the left
and organize them on the right. Rules are identiﬁed using a short alpha-
numeric code. Lower case codes are used to differentiate them from cat-
egory codes.

To facilitate the development of sets of transformation rules, it is con-
venient to identify three groups of categories. Rewritable categories are
categories that are composed of one or more different categories. For
example, rule s gen: CDS -> ATG GEN STP states that the category CDS
is composed of a start codon (ATG), an open reading frame (GEN) and a
stop codon (STP). Terminal categories are those that may not be trans-
formed via a rule to another category or set of categories; usually DNA
segments (parts) will be associated with terminal categories. ATG and
STP are examples of terminal categories. Orphaned categories are those
not used in any rewriting rule.

In a new grammar, all categories are orphaned categories. As new rules
are added to the grammar, the software automatically reassigns cate-
gories to one of the three groups according to their use. A properly de-
veloped grammar should not have any orphaned categories. Predeﬁned
categories that are not applicable to a particular grammar should be
deleted; for example, the chromosome delimiters are rarely used.

2.4 Grammar management

The development of a new grammar proceeds through multiple iterations
that include both category and rule deﬁnitions. The development of new
rules can necessitate the declaration of new categories. A test tool makes
it possible to test the new grammar by experimenting with the existing
rules. These simulations often uncover limitations of the existing rule sets.

Users may only make changes to their own grammars, but they can
make copies of existing public grammars and use these as templates for
the development of new grammars. In addition, grammar ﬁles may be

Fig. 1. Compiler generation workﬂow. When validating a design,
GenoCAD generates an on—demand compiler written in Prolog that is
tied to the library and grammar of the design

imported into a user’s workspace; such ﬁles are available from a number
of sources. We have previously published several GenoCAD grammars
(Cai et al., 2007, 2010; Czar et al., 2009).

When users copy or export a grammar, they have the option of also
including any parts libraries, and, by extension, designs and parts, with
the copied grammar; this is a quick way to export a complete data set and
share it with a colleague who can load it into their own GenoCAD work-
space for review and further modiﬁcation.

2.5 Parser generation and plasmid veriﬁcation

When a plasmid is created using GenoCAD, the design tool guides the
user through grammar— and library-appropriate choices, thereby prevent-
ing the user from developing an invalid design. However, subsequent
changes to the design’s underlying grammars, libraries or parts may
alter the design’s validation status. GenoCAD has implemented a
three-step validation feature to allow for revalidation of developed
designs.

The ﬁrst step is to generate a compiler speciﬁc to the grammar and
library that the design is associated with; this process is illustrated in
Figure 1. Written in Prolog, this compiler consists of some hard-coded
functions to handle processing of the design, but also contains the gram-
mar’s rule speciﬁcations, a list of the parts supported by the library and
the relationship between the categories and the parts. The compiler’s
algorithm incorporates strategies from Moore’s algorithm (Moore,
2000) to remove immediate left recursion from context-free grammars
because Prolog does not natively support it; this feature makes it possible
for users to deﬁne rules like ‘CAS -> CAS CAS’, where the ﬁrst category
on the right side of the rule is the same as the category on the left side. It
should also be noted that this compiler needs to be regenerated every time
the design is validated to ensure that all modiﬁcations to the grammar,
library or parts have been captured.

Fig. 2. Validating designs. In Step 1, the compiler is generated from the
design’s grammar and library. In Step 2, the design sequence is run
through the compiler to ensure it is compliant with the parts library
and the grammar. In Step 3, the sequence based on the parts is compared
with the previously saved sequence in case one of the part sequences has
changed

In the second step, the sequence of the design is generated from its
associated parts, and this sequence is passed to the compiler for a two-
phased validation strategy. In the ﬁrst phase, a lexical analyzer uses a
bottom up parser constructing the rightmost derivation to divide the
sequence into parts; this may seem redundant, as the sequence was just
assembled from the design’s underlying parts, but this veriﬁes that the
design consists only of parts still present in the design’s parts library. If
the ﬁrst phase returns a list of parts instead of an invalid status, the
second phase of the compilation process parses the grammar hierarchy,
following a top-down parser constructing the leftmost derivation from
the start category down to the parts level to see if these series of parts can
be reconciled to a grammatically valid construct. This step conﬁrms that
the design still conforms to the grammar.

If the sequence is deemed valid during the second step, the third step is
to compare the sequence generated from the parts of the design to the
sequence of the design from the last time it was saved; this is a simple
string comparison and does not involve the compiler. This check is per-
formed because a design may still be consistent with its parts library and
grammar, but changes to the sequences of underlying parts could result in
a different design sequence than the one that was originally developed.
In this case, the design is marked with a caution sign, which warns that
while the design is still valid based on its parts and grammars, the under-
lying sequence has Changed. The revalidation process is illustrated in
Figure 2.

3 RESULTS

We have applied the grammar-design workﬂow described before
to develop a grammar to design vectors that can express one or
multiple genes from a DNA sequence as inserted in the chloro-
plast chromosome.

3.1 Category definition

The list of categories includes those found in many grammars,
like open reading frames, tagging sequences or transcription ter-
minators. Here, we have decided to declare start and stop codons
as a category. This common convention facilitates the design of
fusion proteins by concatenation of multiple protein coding se-
quences lacking stop codons.

The grammar also includes categories that are speciﬁc to this
application. For instance, the translation initiation sites are not
as well characterized in C.reinhara’tii as in Escherichia coli. The
promoter category is deﬁned as sequences that include both tran-
scription and translation initiation sites. The C.reinhara’tii chlor-
oplastic chromosome has several operons in which adjacent
coding sequences are separated by short interval sequences. We
decided to deﬁne these sequences as a part category that will be
used to make polycistronic cassettes. To target a speciﬁc region
of the chloroplast chromosome by homologous recombination,
the constructs need to include ﬂanking sequences in 5’ and 3’
positions of the expression cassette. The grammar also includes
a number of rewritable categories corresponding to large struc-
tural blocks. Another category labeled ‘targeted expression cas-
sette’ corresponds to expression cassettes ﬂanked by two
genomic sequences for homologous recombination. Figure 3
lists all the grammar categories along with their deﬁnition,
abbreviation and graphical representation.

3.2 Parts sequences

On completion of the category deﬁnition process, we imported
sequences into each category. Nif genes were originally from
Azotobacter genome (accession number M20568) (Jacobson
et al., 1989). The sequence of nif genes and tags were codon—
optimized for Chlamydomonas using OPTIMIZER (Puigbo
et al., 2007).

The sources of promoter and Short Interval Sequences (SISs)
are described in the online supplement. Additional information
regarding the origin of parts sequences is available in the parts
description ﬁeld.

3.3 Rules declaration

The rules for the C.reinhara’tii grammar are illustrated in
Figure 4. The best way to review the rule set is to start from S.
S can be rewritten into a single targeted expression cassette (rule
ltcs), a complete plasmid that includes both a cassette and a
vector backbone (rule lplas) or a construct that includes two
plasmids (rule 2plas) that could be convenient in cases where
the size of the insert exceeds the cloning capacity of the vector
backbone.

Three rules are then used to rewrite the CAS category. Rule
2cas is used to introduce an additional cassette in the design.
Rule rcas is used to change the orientation of the cassette.

Finally rule prct is used to break the cassette down into pro-
moter, open reading frame and transcription terminator.

The rewriting of CDS is the focus on the next two rules. Rule
2cds is used to create polycistronic constructs. Rule sgen reveals
the start and stop codons that delimit the open reading frame
(GEN).

Finally, the grammar has three rules to rewrite the GEN cat-
egory. Rule 2gen creates the possibility to make fusion proteins
by combining two open reading frames. Rules tgen and gent
correspond to the addition of an epitope tag on the N or C
terminus of the open reading frame.

3.4 Sample designs

Four designs of varying complexity were developed to illustrate
how one grammar can have the ﬂexibility to create a variety of
designs. These designs can be viewed in Figure 5.

Design 1 illustrates the implementation of a targeted expres-
sion cassette (TCS). Although usually a TCS would be imple-
mented as part of a plasmid, this example illustrates how partial
sequences can be implemented in GenoCAD, then further
reﬁned in another application. This design includes a HisTag,
along with the NifB and lucCP genes.

Design 2 takes this concept a step further by encapsulating the
ﬁrst design within a complete plasmid, along with a vector. The
special case delimiters for the plasmid (indicated with parenthe-
sis) is handled when the sequence is downloaded; this is especially
evident in the GenBank download.

Design 3 builds on the second design by adding a second nif
gene on a single transcript; it also relies on an SIS.

Design 4, on the other hand, relies on two cassettes instead of
an SIS part. An additional feature that makes Design 4 distinct
from the others is that the ﬁrst cassette is implemented in the
reverse complement orientation, as indicated by the special case
reverse complement delimiter tags (brackets) Whenever the se-
quence is downloaded, the sequence encapsulated between those
delimiters is reverse complemented before the ﬁnal sequence is
returned for download; that portion will also be indicated in the
GenBank export as complement features.

All four designs are included as part of the C.reinhara’tii
chloroplast grammar provided in the Supplementary Material.

3.5 Design veriﬁcation

GenoCAD provides a validation feature to notify the user if
changes to underlying parts and grammars have impacted any
of the designs. To demonstrate this capability, we copied the
C.reinhara’tii chloroplast grammar, along with its designs, and
made modiﬁcations as described later in the text. It should be
noted that at the beginning of this exercise, all four designs were
in ‘valid’ status; the statuses of the designs after the changes are
displayed in Figure 6.

The ﬁrst change was to deselect the terminator in Design 1 and
save the design. On revalidation, the design reﬂects that it is in
‘under construction’ status. It will retain this status until some-
one selects a terminator so that all of the terminal categories have
associated parts.

The second change was to edit the sequence of VEC part
pTJ 322 (Noor-Mohammadi et al., 2012), which is used in designs
2, 3 and 4. Initially, all three designs subsequently showed a

Fig. 6. Examples of design veriﬁcation. (A) Changes to designs, parts, parts libraries and grammars can invalidate previously valid designs. (B) Design 3
after the selected SIS part was removed from the design’s library. (C) Design 4 needs to be rebuilt from Step 3 after the deletion of the 2cas rule

status of ‘needs validation’, but on revalidation, they all showed
a status of ‘caution’. Although still valid designs, the design se-
quences for each, as implemented from the part segments, differ
from their original design sequences. If the designs had been
saved again, the original design sequences would be overwritten
with the new sequences, as based on the parts, and the statuses
would return to ‘valid’.

After removing the SIS part rrnL_Cr_igs from the
Creinhara’tii chloroplast parts library, Design 3 became invalid
because it depended on that part; when displayed in the design
screen, that part is not even displayed for the SIS element, and
the user would have to go select another SIS part to make the
design valid again.

Finally, using the grammar editor, the rule 2cas was deleted;
this rule allowed the user to have two cassettes in their plasmid

instead of just one. Design 4 contains two cassettes, so this design
was also rendered ‘invalid’. To restore this design to ‘valid’
status, the user would have to return to Step 3 and rebuild the
design from that point; that said, the design could never be
restored to its original form without the reimplementation of
the 2cas rule.

4 DISCUSSION

A grammar should be ﬂexible enough to support a variety of
designs applicable to a certain application domain. Although
there are often multiple ways to express a set of design principles,
some grammar development strategies are better than others.
Rewriting rules that resolve to a long list of categories are
usually an indication of bad grammar design. It is often possible

Development of a domain-specific genetic language

 

to break down this transformation into a set of simpler rewriting
rules by introducing intermediate categories corresponding to
shorter aggregations of categories. Deﬁning these new categories
is an opportunity to formalize an abstraction hierarchy.

When deﬁning categories and rules, it is important to identify
reusable patterns and implement rules that group these cate-
gories together. This limits the number of categories and rewrit-
ing rules.

A good grammar should be expressive enough to allow the
generation of a broad range of constructs but should also be
constrained enough to limit the possibilities of designing faulty
constructs. How constraining it needs to be is something that
should be discussed with a domain expert. For example, the
grammar presented here allows users to design constructs distrib-
uted over two different plasmids. When two plasmids are used
together, it may be helpful to ensure that they rely on different
selection markers. It was decided that it was not necessary to
express this constraint in rule 2plas, but the grammar could easily
be modiﬁed should it become necessary to enforce this
constraint.

The need to provide biologists with tools to express custom
design strategies is somewhat antithetic of the need for standard-
ization. For instance, we could not identify any GenBank quali-
ﬁer corresponding to the domain-speciﬁc categories deﬁned in
the grammar, such as SIS, start codon (ATG), stop codon (STP)
or vector (VEC). This limitation would lead to an incomplete
rendering of designs built with this grammar if exported in
GenBank format for import into another application.

Similarly, it proved challenging to use SBOLv, the set of stand-
ard icons developed by the Synthetic Biology Open Language
(SBOL) project (Galdzicki et al., 2012). This difﬁculty forced us
to develop a custom set of icons.

GenoCAD’s grammar editor has been used to develop other
DSLs. It has been used to model the structure of a family of
vaccine vectors derived from the vesicular stomatitis virus
(Overend et al., 2012). A grammar has also been developed for
the design of synthetic transcription factors based on zinc ﬁngers,
transcription activator-like effectors and the recently developed
clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats
CRISPR/Cas-based system (Purcell O., Peccoud J ., Lu T.K.,
Grammar for the Design of Eukaryotic Synthetic
Transcription Factors, submitted).

To make it easier for potential users to develop DSLs for their
own applications using the GenoCAD grammar editor, this fea-
ture is introduced in the GenoCAD tutorial available from

Figshare (doi:10.6084/m9.ﬁgshare.153827). Potential users are
encouraged to familiarize with this tutorial and complete the
exercises before starting the development of their own grammars.

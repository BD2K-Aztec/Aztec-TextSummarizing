ABSTRACT

Summary: Epigenetics, the study of heritable somatic phenotypic
changes not related to DNA sequence, has emerged as a critical
component of the landscape of gene regulation. The epigenetic
layers, such as DNA methylation, histone modifications and nuclear
architecture are now being extensively studied in many cell types
and disease settings. Few software tools exist to summarize and
interpret these datasets. We have created a toolbox of procedures
to interrogate and visualize epigenomic data (both array- and
sequencing-based) and make available a software package for the
cross-platform R language.

Availability: The package is freely available under LGPL from the
R-Forge web site (http://repitoo|s.r-forge.r-project.org/)

1 INTRODUCTION

Epigenetics is the study of the phenotypic changes unrelated to DNA
sequence. Epigenomics is the large—scale study of epigenetics, with
various genome—wide assays having been introduced in the past few
years and with many epigenome mapping projects on the horizon
(Jones et al., 2008; Nature editorial, 2010). DNA methylation is one
of the best studied epigenetic marks and can be assayed genome—
wide using restriction enzyme, bisulphite or enrichment—based
approaches (reviewed in Laird, 2010). Another signiﬁcant class
of epigenetic regulators is histone modiﬁcations, typically studied
using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) in combination with
microarrays (ChIP—chip) or next—generation sequencing (ChIP—seq).

There are limited general tools available for the exploratory
analysis and summarization of enrichment—based epigenomics data
(see Table 3 of Laird, 2010). We present Repi tools, a software
package for the R environment that is focused on the analysis of
enrichment—based epi genomic data. Examples are shown to illustrate
the diversity of tools within the package; many further examples can
be found in the comprehensive user’s guide. The routines have been
tested on Affymetrix and Nimblegen tiling microarrays and Illumina
Genome Analyzer sequencing data; generic data types are used so
that other platforms can be easily supported.

2 DATA SUMMARIZATION

Various procedures for visualization are available within the
package. For example, enrichmentPlot displays the
distribution of enrichment across the whole genome for sequencing—
based experiments. cproxp 1 ct s and cpgDens i tyP 1 ct
display microarray and sequencing results, respectively, for quality
assessment of DNA methylation enrichment experiments. Figure 1A
illustrates the cpgDens ityPlot of a successful methylated DNA
enrichment experiment using MethylMinerTM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad

CA, USA) where, as expected, the CpG density of the enriched
DNA population is heavily skewed to the right compared to the
input DNA control.

We have provided many ways to visualize and summarize
promoter—level microarray or genome—wide epigenomic data. For
example, given a table of annotation, the binPlots function
summarizes median signal across points of interest (e. g. transcription
start sites). We routinely use binPlots as a quality control
step of new ChIP experiments where there is a previously known
relationship between the interrogated chromatin mark and another
metric, commonly gene expression. For example, Figure 1B
clearly illustrates the positive association between gene expression
levels (Affymetrix Gene 1.0 ST data) and the occurrence of
H3K9 acetylation in the proximity of the corresponding promoters
(Affymetrix Promoter 1.0R data). The routine handles tiling array
or sequencing data as inputs, can accept alternative rankings for
grouping and the display can be a plot with multiple lines, a heatmap
or a 3D visualization.

Another useful strategy for summarizing sets of genes of
interest is significancePlots. As illustrated in Figure 1C,
significancePlots shows the distinct methylated DNA
enrichment changes associated with genes whose expression is
up— or down—regulated >2—fold between two samples, and how
the proﬁles differ between array and high—throughput sequencing
readout. For the comparison, a large number of random gene sets
are taken to form the proﬁle null distribution; median and conﬁdence
intervals are plotted. These plots show evidence that there is a
clear enrichment of sequencing reads and hence, DNA methylation
surrounding many genes are down—regulated in this comparison.
Further data summaries are regularly added.

3 STATISTICAL PROCEDURES

The visualization procedures detailed above aggregate signal over a
large number of promoters or regions of the genome. Often, it is of
interest to focus on speciﬁc regions of the genome and summarize the
signal observed at these regions (e. g. transcription start sites, exons,
etc.). For example, an experimenter may be interested in promoter—
level summaries of a particular epigenetic mark. The general purpose
bl ocks S tat s procedure focuses on data for the speciﬁed genomic
regions of interest. For microarray data, this involves the calculation
of a probe—level score and applying a statistical test to the groups of
probes within a speciﬁed distance from the region of interest. For
sequencing data, we calculate statistics on aggregated read counts
around the features of interest. Further details are available in the
accompanying user’s guide.

We also have procedures for untargeted analysis of epigenomic
tiling array data. The regionStats function searches for a
persistent change in signal in an untargeted fashion, similar in
principle to model—based analysis of tiling arrays (Johnson et al.,
2006), and therefore not relying upon annotation. Analogous
procedures for sequencing data are in development.

4 ACCESSORY TOOLS

The package contains a number of useful tools in the spectrum
of epigenomics. For example, in the context of CpG methylation,

microarray probes or sequence reads are often affected by the local
CpG density of the regions being interrogated. cpgDens ityCalc
is a procedure to calculate local CpG density according to a
previous deﬁnition (Pelizzola et al., 2008). annotationLookup
provides a framework for relating annotation (e. g. transcription
start sites) information to probe positions on a tiling array.
multiHeatmap is a general tool for creating adjacent heatmaps
using separate colour scales. Additional included tools exist to access
Nimblegen array quickly (e.g. readPairFile), access features
of aroma.affymetrix objects (e.g. getProbePositionst) and
aggregate sequencing reads according to proximity to annotation
(e.g. annotationCounts). We expect further tools to be added
and encourage others in the epigenomic community to contribute
generally useful procedures.

5 DISCUSSION

There are relatively few tools currently available for the analysis
of epigenomic data. We have developed Repi tools, a software
package for the R environment; it contains many useful functions
for quality assessment, visualization, summarization and statistical
analysis of epigenomics experiments. The package makes use of
aroma.affymetrix and several Bioconductor packages for various
preprocessing steps (Bengtsson et al., 2008; Gentleman et al., 2004)
and may require an intermediate understanding of R for some
features. A comprehensive user manual is available and examples
can be run using supplied data. The analysis of large Affymetrix
tiling array datasets is facilitated through the memory efﬁciency
afforded by the aroma.affymetrix package (Bengtsson et al., 2008).

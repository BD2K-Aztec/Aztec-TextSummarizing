ABSTRACT

Motivation: Over the past decade, deciphering the roles of
microRNAs (miRNAs) has relied heavily upon the identification of
their targets. Most of the targets that were computationally and
experimentally characterized were evolutionarily conserved ‘seed’
targets, containing a perfect 6—8nt match between the miRNA
5’-region and the messenger RNA (mRNA). Gradually, it has become
evident that other types of miRNA binding can confer target
regulation, but their characterization has been lagging behind.
Results: Here, we complement the putative evolutionarily-
conserved seed-containing targets by a wide repertoire of putative
targets exhibiting a variety of miRNA binding patterns, predicted
by our algorithm RepTar. These include non-conserved sites, ‘seed’
binding sites with G:U-wobbles within the seed, ‘3’ compensatory’
sites and ‘centered’ sites. Apart from the centered sites, we
demonstrate the functionality of these sites and characterize the
target profile of a miRNA by the types of binding sites predicted
in its target 3’ UTRs. We find that different miRNAs have individual
target profiles, with some more inclined to seed binding and others
more inclined to binding through 3’ compensatory sites. This diversity
in targeting patterns is also evident within several miRNA families
(defined by common seed sequences), leading to divergence in the
target sets of members of the same family. The prediction of non-
conventional miRNA targets is also beneficial in the search for targets
of the non-conserved viral miRNAs. Analyzing the cellular targets of
viral miRNAs, we show that viral miRNAs use various binding patterns
to exploit cellular miRNA binding sites and suggest roles for these
targets in virus—host interactions.

1 INTRODUCTION

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as key regulators of gene
expression, exerting their regulatory function post—transcriptionally
by base—pairing with the mRNA [reviewed in Ref. (Bartel, 2009)].
Over the past decade, hundreds of miRNA genes have been

discovered in metazoa, plants and viruses. While it has been
demonstrated that quite a few of them have important roles in
central cellular processes [reviewed in Ref. (Wienholds and Plasterk,
2005)], understanding these roles relies heavily upon identiﬁcation
of their target genes. Consequently, many experimental and
computational efforts have been made to identify miRNA targets.
Most of the ﬁrst discovered miRNA targets exhibited evolutionary
conservation and full complementarity in their 3’ —untranslated
region (3’ UTR) to a short sequence of ~7 nt in the 5’ region of the
miRNA, termed seed [reviewed in Ref. (Bartel, 2009)]. Therefore,
the main features of miRNA binding sites that were initially used to
predict miRNA targets were the presence of a seed and evolutionary
conservation of the site [reviewed in Ref. (Bartel, 2009)]. These
features narrowed the vast number of possible base—pairings between
mRNA 3’ UTRs and miRNAs, and directed most research in the
ﬁeld to seed—containing targets. However, two of the originally
discovered miRNA targets in Caenorhabditis elegans, as well as
additional targets identiﬁed along the years, lacked perfect seed
pairing, but rather exhibited extensive base—pairing between the
mRNA 3’ UTR and the miRNA 3’ region, termed ‘3’ compensatory’
sites (Brennecke et al., 2005; Reinhart et al., 2000; Slack et al.,
2000; Stern—Ginossar et al., 2007). Furthermore, the miRNA binding
options were recently expanded even further with the identiﬁcation
of ‘centered sites’, functional miRNA binding sites that lack both
perfect seed and 3’ compensatory pairing but exhibit extensive
pairing between the mRNA 3’ UTR and the center region of the
miRNA (Shin et al., 2010). All these additional types of sites were far
less studied; non—evolutionarily conserved targets can be predicted
by several algorithms (Betel et al., 2010; Friedman et al., 2009; John
et al., 2004; Kertesz et al., 2007; Maragkakis et al., 2009; Marin
and Vanicek, 2011; Miranda et al., 2006; Muckstein et al., 2006;
Rehmsmeier et al., 2004; Smith et al., 2010), the 3’ compensatory
targets are predicted by only few (Betel et al., 2010; Friedman et al.,
2009) and no target prediction algorithm to date predicts centered
sites (see Supplementary Material S1 and Supplementary Table S 1).
Consequently, much is still unknown regarding the functionality
and the biological implications of these non—conventional targets.
This shortage may be even more pronounced when targets of viral
miRNAs are considered, as these miRNAs are not evolutionarily
conserved and one of their ﬁrst discovered cellular targets (based
on RepTar’s predictions) contained a 3’ compensatory site (Stern—
Ginossar et al., 2007).

Here, we provide a wide repertoire of targets obtained by our
algorithm ‘RepTar’, which enables identiﬁcation of targets with
various binding types. The set of RepTar’s predictions includes

evolutionarily conserved and organism—speciﬁc non—conserved
targets that have either multiple or single binding sites of various
types: seed binding sites (that may include G:U wobbles within the
seed), 3’ compensatory binding sites and centered sites.

We applied RepTar to human and mouse miRNAs as well as
to miRNAs from several viruses and provide our predictions in
a database that enables simple and advanced querying at http://
reptar.ekmd.huji.ac.il (Elefant et al., 2011). Using experimental data
we are able to demonstrate that most of the non—conventional sites
mediate down—regulation of their targets, and that the combination
of a 3’ compensatory binding site with a perfect seed site confers as
efﬁcient down—regulation as two perfect seed sites. Characterizing
the viral and cellular miRNAs by their binding site types we suggest
functional implications for differential targeting.

2 METHODS

2.1 Databases of miRNA and 3’ UTR sequences

Seven sets of miRNAs (including sequences of the ‘star’ miRNAs—miRNA*)
were extracted from the miRBase version 15.0 (http://microma.sanger.ac
.uk/) (Grifﬁths—J ones, 2004; Grifﬁths—Jones et 01., 2006; Grifﬁths—Jones et 01.,
2008): a dataset of all human miRNAs (1100 miRNAs), a dataset of all mouse
miRNAs (717 miRNAs), three datasets of miRNAs of human—infecting
viruses: human cytomegalovirus (17 miRNAs), Kaposi sarcoma—associated
virus (25 miRNAs) and Epstein Barr virus (44 miRNAs) and two datasets of
mouse—infecting viruses: mouse cytomegalovirus (29 miRNAs) and mouse
gammaherpesvirus (10 miRNAs).

The set of human 3’ UTR sequences and related data were extracted from
University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) human genome assembly (build
36.1, hg18), dated March 2006 (http://genome.ucsc.edu). Nearly 24 407
unique refGene 3’ UTR sequences ranging from the stop codon to the
polyadenylation site and deﬁned as non—intronic regions were retrieved.
Each RefSeq accession was then attributed to the corresponding gene—
symbol accession using the ngref table. This process grouped together
RefSeq accessions of alternatively spliced sequences. The sequences of these
alternatively spliced 3’ UTR variants were aligned using fasta version 3.4
with Smith—Waterman alignment and variants with ~80% sequence identity
were represented once by the longest common sequence. This procedure
resulted in a ﬁnal set of 18 421 3’ UTR sequences.

The set of mouse 3’ UTR sequences was extracted from the
UCSC mouse genome assembly (build 37.1, mm9), dated July 2007
(http://genome.ucsc.edu). In total, 19 613 unique RefSeq 3’ UTR sequences
were retrieved and processed, as described above, resulting in a ﬁnal set of
17 069 sequences.

2.2 Dataset of experimentally-determined direct targets

Human and mouse validated miRNA targets were retrieved from the TarB ase
database version V5 June 2008 (Papadopoulos et al., 2009). Only ‘TRUE’
targets with ‘direct support’ were retrieved. Of these, several targets were
excluded because of absence of the miRNA/3’ UTR in our database or
differences between the reported miRNA sequence and the one in our
database. This resulted in 197 miRNA:target pairs. These are listed in
Supplementary Table S2, along with their annotation as predicted or not
predicted by RepTar.

Cellular targets of viral miRNAs were collected from several papers that
were published at the time of the analysis (Supplementary Table S3). Of
the 23 direct cellular targets, two targets were excluded from the analysis:
one target did not appear in our 3’ UTR database and the other, major
histocompatibility complex class I—related chain B (MICB), was discovered
based on RepTar’s prediction and therefore excluded (Stern—Ginossar et al.,
2007). This resulted in 21 miRNA:target pairs for our assessment.

2.3 mRNA and protein expression datasets

Experimental data of the change in mRNA expression levels and protein
expression levels were retrieved from Baek et a1. (2008) and Selbach et al.
(2008). Data from three experiments of over—expression of miR—l, miR—
124 and miR—181a and one experiment of knock—down of mouse miRNA
miR—223 (Baek et al., 2008), as well as data from ﬁve experiments of
overexpression of let—7b, miR—l, miR—16, miR—30a and miR—155 (Selbach
et al., 2008) were used. Experimental data of the change in mRNA expression
levels were retrieved from Grimson et al. (2007) for nine experiments of
miRNA overexpression of miR—7, miR—9, miR—122, miR—128, miR—132,
miR—133a, miR—142—3p, miR—148b and miR—181a. Only probes whose values
exceeded the median intensity before transfection were considered.

In all analyses based on the above experimental data, the KS test was
applied to compare between groups of predicted targets and all other genes
in the experiment (referred to as background).

2.4 Dataset of binding sites determined in PAR-CLIP
experiments

We downloaded experimentally veriﬁed Ago—interaction regions in
mRNAs from Photoactivatable—Ribonucleoside—Enhanced Crosslinking and
Immunoprecipitation (PAR—CLIP) experiments in Human embryonic kidney
293 (HEK293) cells from (Hafner et al., 2010). In total, 17 319 regions were
downloaded and of these, 5532 mapped to our database of 3’ UTRs. Within
these regions we searched for RepTar’s predicted miRNA binding sites for
the top 100 miRNAs expressed in HEK293 cells requiring that the site resides
fully within the region and that the T to C transition be within the predicted
binding site.

2.5 Speciﬁc binding patterns for individual miRNAs

The predicted targets were divided according to their binding patterns (seed
only, 3’ compensatory only and mixed). We then searched for miRNAs that
had a greater fraction of 3’ compensatory targets than seed targets. These
miRNAs were required to have at least 50 predicted targets and a fraction
of 3’ compensatory targets that exceeded the fraction of seed targets by at
least 5%. This resulted in 84 miRNAs and 8 star miRNAs with a fraction
of 3’ compensatory targets that was larger than their fraction of seed targets.
We compared the nucleotide distribution and expression proﬁle of these 92
miRNAs showing a larger fraction of 3’ compensatory targets with that of
937 miRNAs showing a higher fraction of seed targets. For the expression
analysis, we compared the number of tissues where the miRNAs in each
group were expressed, using the miRNA expression atlas of Landgraf et al.
(2007).

2.6 Overlap of viral and human miRNA binding sites

For the analysis of overlap between predicted binding sites of viral and
cellular miRNAs we considered as overlapping, sites that differed in their
genomic start position by no more than 5nt. The statistical signiﬁcance
of the overlap between the sites was assessed for each pair of viral and

cellular miRNAs using the hypergeometric test with false discovery rate
(FDR) correction for 0.05.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1 The RepTar algorithm

3.1.] Overview of the algorithm To identify conventional, as
well as non—conventional binding sites in 3’ UTRs of genes, we
developed a predictive algorithm, RepTar, which is not restricted
to evolutionarily conserved seed sites. The main steps of the
algorithm are described in Figure 1 and detailed in Supplementary
Material S1. Brieﬂy, it begins by searching for statistically
signiﬁcant repeating motifs in each 3’ UTR, which are then

Fig. 1. Schematic overview of the RepTar algorithm. (A) First we identify
targets containing repetitive binding sites for each miRNA, by characterizing
repetitive elements in each 3’ UTR. (B) The sets of miRNAs and their putative
3’ UTR targets are then used in the next stage to identify additional targets
containing single binding sites. The ﬁnal set of RepTar’s predictions consists
of conventional and non—conventional targets identiﬁed in both stages.

represented by a proﬁle Hidden—Markov—Model (HMM). These
HMMs are reversed and complemented so that they represent
the sequence that is reverse—complementary to the motif. The
complementary HMMs are searched against a database of miRNA
sequences, to identify pairs of complementary HMMs and miRNAs.
To allow all types of miRNA binding sites, we speciﬁcally use
the HMM representation that permits insertions and deletions in
the alignment and therefore searches for perfectly, as well as
imperfectly matching miRNAs. Using HMMs, we also award
statistical signiﬁcance to G:U pairing. Consequently, RepTar’s initial
search does not impose any restriction on the location of the match
within the miRNA (whether it is in the 5’ —end or 3’ —end) or on the
type of miRNA binding site.

Once statistically signiﬁcant matching miRNAs are identiﬁed,
several ﬁltering criteria are applied, including the binding pattern
and the thermodynamic stability of the miRNA:mRNA hybrid
(Supplementary Material S1). Restrictions are imposed also at
the gene level: for a gene to be considered a putative target
gene, its 3’ UTR must contain at least two qualiﬁed binding
sites. This requirement for repetitiveness provides a constricted
and more reliable set of miRNA binding sites, without considering
evolutionary conservation.

Finally, the constricted set of repetitive binding sites is used to
deﬁne statistical models by which we identify targets with non—
repetitive sites or with sites that lack a high scoring repetitive motif
(Supplementary Material S1).

3.1.2 Application of RepTar RepTar was applied in search
of targets of human and mouse miRNAs in human and mouse
3’ UTRs, respectively. It was also applied in search of cellular
targets of several viral miRNAs: Human 3’ UTR sequences were
searched for matches to miRNAs of human cytomegalovirus
(HCMV), Kaposi sarcoma—associated herpes virus (KSHV) and
Epstein Barr virus (EBV); Mouse 3’ UTR sequences were searched
for matches to miRNAs of mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) and
mouse gammaherpesvirus (MGHV) (for more details see Section 2).

3.1.3 Evaluation of RepTar To evaluate the RepTar algorithm,
we assessed its sensitivity, precision and functionality in several
ways. First, we turned to experimentally determined direct targets
by small—scale experiments extracted from the TarBase database
(Papadopoulos et al., 2009). RepTar successfully predicted 142 out
of 197 reported direct targets of human and mouse miRNAs, deﬁning
a sensitivity of 72% on this dataset (P 5 2.5e—64 by a hypergeometric
test) (Supplementary Table S2). Of note, the direct targets of the
TarBase database are comprised mainly of validated predictions
of existing algorithms and therefore includes mainly conventional
binding sites. Similarly, to validate RepTar’s predictions of cellular
targets of viral miRNAs we compiled a set of 21 experimentally
validated direct cellular targets of viral miRNAs (Supplementary
Table S3). RepTar correctly predicted 15/21 cellular targets of viral
miRNAs, constituting a sensitivity of 71%, similar to that obtained
for the human and mouse miRNAs.

Next we turned to large databases of targets obtained from
large—scale experiments. We began by assessing the precision and
sensitivity of RepTar by conducting the same analysis as was
recently performed by Alexiou et al. (2009) on the same data of
measured protein level changes after overexpression of ﬁve miRNAs
(Selbach et al., 2008). In the study of Alexiou et al., the sensitivity
and precision of miRNA target prediction algorithms was assessed
relative to a set of genes deﬁned as target genes based on the
down—regulation of their protein levels below an assigned threshold
(logZ—fold change < —0.2). Following these deﬁnitions, RepTar’s
precision and sensitivity on this data were 25 and 23% respectively,
demonstrating a lower precision than the less permissive miRNA
target prediction algorithms but a higher sensitivity than available
algorithms [see Ref. (Alexiou et al., 2009; Elefant et al., 2011)]
(Supplementary Material S1). RepTar’s ability to predict a wide
variety of binding sites is expected to create higher false positive
rates and render it less precise but in turn it is expected to award
it higher sensitivity. Indeed, when ﬁltering RepTar’s predictions
to include only perfect seed sites (full Watson—crick binding of
positions 2—7 or 2—8) we obtain for the same data a higher precision
of 39% but a lower sensitivity of 14%.

We then used the large—scale experiments to assess RepTar’s
predictions in terms of biological functionality, this time using the
whole spectrum of changes in gene expression, without setting
pre—deﬁned thresholds of down—regulation (or up—regulation). We
used both the data described above, as well as data from two
additional large—scale experiments (Baek et al., 2008; Grimson et al.,
2007) and evaluated the change in gene expression of the genes in
the group of RepTar’s predicted targets compared with all other
genes in the data. In the experiment by Grimson et al. (2007)
mRNA expression levels were measured upon overexpression of
nine different human miRNAs. In the experiments of Baek et al.
(2008) and Selbach et al. (2008) both changes in mRNA and protein

Fig. 2. Assessment of RepTar’s predictions using large—scale mRNA
expression data. RepTar’s predictions were evaluated using pooled data from
nine large—scale experiments measuring changes in mRNA expression under
overexpression of a miRNA (Grimson et al., 2007). The logz—fold change
values of RepTar’s predicted targets (RepTar) were compared with all other
genes (bg), by a one—sided KS test. The predicted targets were statistically
signiﬁcantly down—regulated compared with the background genes. The
P—value appears in the box.

expression levels were measured upon overexpression (and in two
cases suppression) of three human and one mouse miRNAs and of
ﬁve human miRNAs, respectively. For each of these experiments,
we show that RepTar’s predicted targets are statistically signiﬁcantly
down—regulated (or up—regulated in the case of the suppressed
miRNAs) compared with all other genes on the array [KS test,
P < 0.05 (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figs. S1 and S2)]. In the same
manner, we compared the change in cellular mRNA expression
levels upon transfection of endothelial cells and B—cells with the
cluster of KSHV miRNAs (Sebastien Pfeffer and Juergen Haas,
personal communication). RepTar’s predicted targets are statistically
signiﬁcantly down—regulated compared with the background genes
[one—sided Kolmogorov—Smirnov (KS) test, P 50.05, data not
shown], conﬁrming the validity and biological relevance of these
viral miRNA target predictions as well.

Thus, when considering the full set of RepTar’s predictions we
ﬁnd that these predicted targets exhibit statistically signiﬁcant down—
regulation in the presence of the corresponding miRNA. The set
of RepTar’s predictions is composed of targets that are bound
through different binding patterns (e. g. seed, 3’ compensatory) and
are characterized by various features (e. g. G:U pairing in the seed).

We next turned to characterize and assess the functionality of the
various types of binding sites.

3.2 Various miRNA binding types

3.2.] Distribution of miRNA binding types The most abundant
type among RepTar’s predicted binding sites is the seed site. Nearly
81% of RepTar’s predicted sites are seed sites, while 18.6% are
3’ compensatory and <0.5% are centered sites. This is consistent
with the general consensus that most miRNA binding sites are seed
sites. While seed sites require pairing of 6—, 7— or 8—mers in the
3’ UTR, 3’ compensatory and centered sites require longer stretches

of matches and can be expected to be less abundant than the seed
sites. Many of our predicted target genes have several predicted
binding sites within the sequence. When we assign each target gene a
binding type according to the predicted binding sites that it contains,
we ﬁnd that 78% of the predicted human targets are ‘seed targets’
(contain only seed sites), 15% are ‘3’ compensatory targets’ (contain
only 3’ compensatory sites), <0.5% are ‘centered targets’ (contain
only centered sites) and 6.5% are ‘mixed targets’ containing several
binding sites of different types within their 3’ UTR (Fig. 3A).

3.2.2 Biological validity of the various predicted binding types
To study the function of the various types of RepTar’s predicted
targets we used the experimental data of the change in mRNA
expression levels described above (Grimson et al., 2007). We
divided the predicted targets by type and compared the expression
fold change of the predicted targets in each group with that of the
background genes (all genes not predicted as targets). In addition
to the basic categorization of targets into types (Fig. 3), we studied
additional categories of groups of targets: conserved target group
(targets containing at least one binding site that showed evolutionary
conservation), non—conserved target group (targets containing only
non—evolutionarily conserved sites), perfect seed group (targets that
contained only seed sites with at least one perfect seed) and seed
with G:U wobble group (targets that contained only seed sites
with G:U wobbles). The small number of targets included in the
centered group was insufﬁcient for achieving statistical signiﬁcance
and therefore, was not included in this analysis. For all other
types of targets we ﬁnd that each group, classiﬁed by the binding
type, is statistically signiﬁcantly down—regulated in the experimental
data (Fig. 4A—C). These include evolutionarily conserved targets,
non—conserved targets (which are statistically signiﬁcantly down—
regulated but less down—regulated than the conserved sites), seed
targets, seed targets with G:U wobbles (which are statistically
signiﬁcantly down—regulated but less down—regulated than the
Watson—Crick seed targets), and 3’ compensatory targets.

The functionality of the different binding sites has been gradually
acknowledged. Non—conserved sites have been shown to be

Fig. 4. Functionality of non—conventional targets. Logz—fold change in
mRNA expression levels of different groups of predicted target genes was
compared that of the background genes (bg). Analysis as described in
Figure 2A. (A) RepTar’s predicted targets were divided into three groups
according to their types: seed (s), 3’ compensatory (c) and mixed (m). All
groups show a statistically signiﬁcant down—regulation, with mixed targets
showing the most signiﬁcant down—regulation. (B) RepTar’s predicted targets
were divided into targets containing perfect seed matches with no G:U base—
pairing (ngu) and targets containing seed matches with G:U base—pairing
(gu). Both the ‘ngu’ and the ‘gu’ groups were statistically signiﬁcantly
down—regulated, although the ‘gu’ group is less down—regulated than the
‘ngu’ group. (C) RepTar’s predicted targets were divided into evolutionarily
conserved targets (cons) and targets that are not evolutionarily conserved
(ncons). Both the ‘ncons’ and the ‘cons’ groups were statistically signiﬁcantly
down—regulated, although the ‘ncons’ group is less down—regulated than
the ‘cons’ group. (D) RepTar’s predicted targets were divided into those
containing one perfect seed site (s), two perfect seed sites (ss), one perfect
seed site and one seed site with G:U pairing (ssgu) and targets containing
one 3’ compensatory site and one perfect seed site (cs). The logz—fold
change in mRNA expression levels of each group was compared with the
‘bg’ group using one—sided KS and to the ‘s’ group using two—sided KS
test. In addition, the log fold change in mRNA expression levels of the
‘cs’ group was compared with the ‘ss’ group using two—sided KS test. All
groups were statistically signiﬁcantly down—regulated compared with the
‘bg’. As expected, the ‘ss’ group was statistically signiﬁcantly more down—
regulated than the ‘s’ group. In contrast, the ‘ssgu’ group was not statistically
signiﬁcantly more down—regulated than the ‘s’ group and surprisingly, the ‘cs’
group did not differ statistically signiﬁcantly from the ‘ss’ group, suggesting
an important contribution of the 3’ compensatory site. (The ﬁrst P—values
are for the comparison with the ‘bg’, the following parentheses contain the

functional (Farh et al., 2005) and are accounted for in many
prediction algorithms. The functionality of seed sites with G:U
wobbles was addressed in several papers (Didiano and Hobert, 2006;
Doench and Sharp, 2004; Miranda et al., 2006; Tay et al., 2008),
resulting in contradicting ﬁndings, and only some of the prediction
algorithms account for these sites. The 3’ compensatory sites are still
neglected by most prediction algorithms (Supplementary Table S1,
Supplementary Material S1). Our results show that seed sites with
G:U base—pairing within the seed are effectively down—regulated,
providing additional support to their functionality. Likewise for the

3’ compensatory binding sites, initially discovered in C. elegans
(Reinhart et al., 2000; Slack et al., 2000) and then reported in
Drosophila melanogaster (Brennecke et al., 2005). Our results show
that targets with such non—conventional binding patterns can undergo
functional down—regulation by the corresponding miRNAs.

A substantial portion of our predicted targets are mixed
targets, containing more than one type of binding site (see also
Supplementary Material S1). Interestingly, conducting the same
analysis on this group of genes, we ﬁnd that the mixed targets
show the highest level of down—regulation (Fig. 4A). This high
level of down—regulation may be due to the mere presence of a seed
site, to the presence of multiple binding sites, or speciﬁcally to the
combination of different types of binding sites. To assess whether
this beneﬁcial targeting is due to the combination of different types
of sites, we compared between the down—regulation of groups of
targets with different combinations of sites (Fig. 4D). As only few
centered sites are found, these are not included in the analysis
and we address mainly the combinations of different seed and 3’
compensatory sites. First, we compared targets with two perfect seed
sites (not allowing G:U pairing) with targets with one perfect seed
site. As expected, targets with two seed sites show a higher level of
down—regulation compared with targets with a single seed site [as
previously shown by Grimson et al. (2007)]. We then considered
targets with one perfect seed and one seed with G:U pairing and
compared them with targets with a single perfect seed site. In this
case, we found that the down—regulation of the targets with two sites
did not differ statistically signiﬁcantly from the targets with a single
perfect seed site, suggesting that the addition of a seed—G:U site does
not contribute substantially to the down—regulation of a target already
containing a perfect seed site. Finally, we compared mixed targets
containing one perfect seed site and one 3’ compensatory site with
targets with a single perfect seed site and with targets with two
perfect seed sites. These mixed targets were statistically signiﬁcantly
more down—regulated than the single seed targets and, surprisingly,
showed a down—regulation as substantial as the double seed targets
(Fig. 4D). This was even more surprising in light of the results
of comparing targets with single sites of different types, which
showed that 3’ compensatory sites are statistically signiﬁcantly more
down—regulated than seed—G:U sites but not as efﬁcient as perfect
seed sites (Supplementary Fig. S3). Therefore, we suggest that it
is the combination of 3’ compensatory and seed sites that has a
synergistic effect and mediates down—regulation as effectively as
the combination of two perfect seed sites.

We further validated RepTar’s predicted binding sites and their
biological functionality, using data of Ago—interaction regions in
mRNAs from PAR—CLIP experiments in HEK293 cells (Hafner
et al., 2010). For the top 100 miRNAs expressed in HEK293 cells,
we ﬁnd that RepTar predicts miRNA binding sites in 36% of the
experimentally veriﬁed regions in 3’ UTRs, similar to the portion
predicted by Hafner et al. (40% of the regions). Within these RepTar
predicted sites, 69% are perfect seed sites, 28% are seed sites with
G:U wobbles and 3% are 3’ compensatory sites. The overall fraction
of RepTar predicted 3’ compensatory targets for these 100 miRNAs
is 9%. In the experimental data on changes in protein expression
levels used above (Selbach et al., 2008), 3% of the down—regulated
proteins are predicted to be 3’ compensatory targets, whereas the
overall fraction of RepTar predicted 3’ compensatory targets in this
dataset is 5%. Some of RepTar’s predictions are expected to be false
positives, and it is possible that there is a higher false positive rate

Fig. 5. miRNA binding patterns. (A) Binding patterns of individual
miRNAs: for each position, the fraction of binding sites in which the position
is bound is determined. miRNAs may show a preference for binding mostly
through their seed positions, implying a preference for seed binding sites,
(left panel), they may show excessive binding at non—seed binding positions
implying a preference for binding 3’ compensatory sites (middle panel),
or show comparable tendencies to both (right panel). (B) Target proﬁle of
individual miRNAs: for each miRNA we compute the distribution of targets
by their different types. The examples demonstrate that miRNAs differ in
their target proﬁles: most of the targets of hsa—miR—10a are seed targets, those
of hsa—miR—551a are mostly 3’ compensatory targets, and hsa—miR—371—3p
binds equally both types of targets. There is a high compatibility between
the binding patterns of the miRNAs (A) and their target proﬁles (B).

among the predicted 3’ compensatory targets. Nonetheless, these
results indicate that a portion of the predictions are indeed functional,
and speciﬁcally, that the non—conventional sites predicted by RepTar
can be functional.

3.2.3 Binding types of speciﬁc miRNAs Next, we turned to see
if any of the miRNAs show a preference to a speciﬁc type of
binding site, i.e. if predicted targets for a certain miRNA are enriched
with one type of site over another (we refer to the distribution of
miRNA targets classiﬁed by their binding site types as the miRNA’s
‘target proﬁle’). For this analysis, we considered the seed targets
and 3’ compensatory targets, which make up 93% of all predicted
targets. Whereas most miRNAs show a target proﬁle enriched with
seed targets, some have equal representation of seed targets and
3’ compensatory targets and for 92 miRNAs, we ﬁnd an enrichment
of 3’ compensatory targets (Fig. 5, see Section 2). For several of these
miRNAs, the 3’ compensatory fraction exceeds 80%. Interestingly,
while conducting the same analysis on mouse miRNAs, we found
a correlation between the target proﬁles of the human miRNAs and
their orthologous mouse miRNAs (Spearman correlation, r=0.59;
P < 0.0001, Supplementary Fig. S4), where many of the orthologous
mouse miRNAs show the same 3’ compensatory tendency. This
suggests that individual miRNAs may have different targeting
preferences and that some of these preferences may be conserved
between human and mouse.

The diversity in target proﬁles may stem from differences
in sequence composition between the miRNAs. Indeed, the 92
3’ compensatory—inclined miRNAs are richer in G nucleotides
compared with the seed—inclined miRNAs (P<0.0001 for whole
miRNAs and P 5 0.0001 for seed regions by chi—squared tests). This
higher G composition is not region—speciﬁc, as the 5’ — and 3’ —ends
show a similar distribution of nucleotides. As 3’ UTR sequences in

human and mouse are generally A/U rich, it would be expected that
miRNAs showing an abundance of extensively matching miRNA
sites, such as are the 3’ compensatory sites, would be A/U rich
as well. It is therefore interesting that these G—rich miRNAs are
3’ compensatory—inclined.

3.2.4 Functional implications of miRNA target proﬁles The
differences in targeting proﬁles may have functional implications.
One possible function is to allow differential regulation of members
of the same miRNA family. Members of miRNA families are often
similarly expressed, share the same seed and differ only in 3’
sequence. These miRNAs would share the same seed—mediated
targets but could differ in other types of targets. Indeed, we ﬁnd
that many of the 3’ compensatory—inclined miRNAs are members
of miRNA families where the other members are seed—inclined
miRNAs (Table 1). For instance, in the let—7 family, all miRNAs are
seed—inclined (with >80% of their targets being seed targets) except
for miRNA—202 that exhibits 56% 3’ compensatory targets, or the
miR—320 family exhibiting two seed—inclined miRNAs and two 3’
compensatory—inclined miRNAs. Thus, for some miRNA families,
the use of differential targeting patterns by the members of the family
can cause divergence in the target sets of the miRNAs in the family
awarding individual functions for each member.

Several other functions may be proposed for these target proﬁles.
The difference in binding sites may confer differences in the type
of regulation, just as sites with near—perfect complementarity are
thought to mediate degradation rather than translational repression.
It is known that factors such as concentration of the mRNA
molecules, mRNA half life and auxiliary RNA binding proteins
affect miRNA targeting (Arvey et al., 2010; Jacobsen et al., 2010;
Larsson et al., 2010). When considered in the context of the cell
or tissue being investigated, it would be interesting to see if these
factors contribute differently to the various types of targets. A hint
to the possibility that these miRNAs may serve slightly different
functions can be seen in the differential expression that they exhibit.
3’ compensatory—inclined miRNAs show lower expression levels
and are expressed in fewer tissues compared with seed—inclined
miRNAs (P50.009 by a two—sided Wilcoxon test) [based on the
data in Ref. (Landgraf et al., 2007), see Section 2].

3.3 Cellular targets of herpesvirus miRNAs

3.3.] Target proﬁles of cellular targets ofherpesvirus miRNAs An
additional group of targets provided by RepTar comprises cellular
targets of viral miRNAs. As viral miRNAs are generally poorly
evolutionarily conserved (Cai et al., 2005; Schafer et al., 2007)
and as a 3’ compensatory target of a viral miRNA has been
proven functional (Stern—Ginossar et al., 2007), the prediction of
both conventional and non—conventional targets of viral miRNAs
encompasses a greater set of potential cellular targets of viral
miRNAs.

Consistent with the proﬁle characteristics of the human miRNAs,
we ﬁnd that most viral miRNA cellular targets are seed targets, a non—
negligible fraction are 3’ compensatory targets, a small fraction are
mixed targets and few are centered targets (Fig. 3B—D). Investigating
possible functional implications for the miRNA binding types of
viral miRNAs we ﬁnd that the group of 3’ compensatory targets of
HCMV miRNAs are enriched in genes that regulate apoptosis, and
genes that are involved in lymphocyte activation and differentiation

Listed are several miRNA families and the proﬁle distribution of the predicted human targets for the members of the families. Each box represents a family and the ﬁrst member
(or members) is a 3’ compensatory-inclined miRNA, whereas, other members are seed-inclined (as indicated by their percentage of miRNA targets in each proﬁle). Nucleotides
underlined represent the seed of the miRNAs. Bold percentages indicate the dominant proﬁle.

(by gene ontology annotation, P50003, P50003, P5002,
respectively). HCMV is known for its manipulative functions on
its host cell, which include evasion of immune mediators and
preventing cell apoptosis (Mocarski, 2002, 2004). Furthermore,
the ﬁrst HCMV miRNA cellular target to be discovered (based
on RepTar’s predictions) was the MICB gene, an NKG2D ligand
mediating cell death by natural killer cells, which contained a non—
evolutionary conserved, 3’ compensatory binding site of the virus
miRNA UL112. Therefore, it is possible that for HCMV miRNAs,
the 3’ compensatory targeting is a means for immune system and
apoptosis regulation.

Another interesting binding type is the ‘near—perfect
complementarity’ site, a binding pattern where extensive
complementarity exists in both the seed and the 3’ region.
This type of site is thought to mediate mRNA degradation
rather than translational repression [reviewed in Ref.
(Wienholds and Plasterk, 2005)]. Relatively, few such targets
are predicted for human, mouse and viral miRNAs. Near—perfect
complementarity to viral miRNAs has been reported in viral mRNA
targets, mostly in genes encoded on the opposite strand of the viral
miRNA [reviewed in Ref. (Gottwein and Cullen, 2008)]. However,
such near—perfect complementarity has not yet been identiﬁed in

cellular target genes. RepTar predicts several such cellular targets
of the viral miRNAs and this group contains dozens of genes that
can limit viral replication, as well as cytokines, apoptosis—inducing
genes and tumor suppressors, which may contribute to the known
tumorigenicity of some of the herpes viruses (Supplementary
Table S4). Among these are the DNA fragmentation factor alpha
subunit (DFFA) and ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) genes,
both containing near—perfect complementarity binding sites for
HCMV, as well as EBV miRNAs. The DFFA gene is a substrate
of caspase—3 and triggers DNA fragmentation during apoptosis.
The ATM gene encodes a protein that is considered one of the
master regulators of the cell cycle and is known to regulate the
tumor suppressor genes BRCA1 and P53. It would be to the virus’
advantage to target such genes that endanger its survival and such
near—perfect complementarity may mediate strong down—regulation
or mRNA degradation.

3.3.2 Viral miRNAs may use non-conventional binding to exploit
cellular miRNA binding sites In order to target cellular genes it is
quite possible that viral miRNAs may attempt to use cellular miRNA
binding sites [such targeting was demonstrated in Ref. (Gottwein
et al., 2007; Nachmani et al., 2010; Stern—Ginossar et al., 2008)].
While several viral miRNAs show sequence similarity to human
miRNAs (Gottwein et al., 2007; Stern—Ginossar et al., 2008) most
viral miRNAs differ in sequence from human miRNAs. Therefore,
in order to exploit cellular binding sites, the viral miRNA may
bind the same area but with a slight shift in binding positions
and/or use a different binding patterns in order to match the
cellular miRNA’s binding site. As RepTar’s initial search for both
cellular and viral miRNA binding sites stems from the identiﬁcation
of repeating regions in the 3’ UTR, it would not be surprising
if predicted viral miRNA binding sites would overlap predicted
cellular binding sites. Indeed, we ﬁnd many overlapping cellular
and viral sites, but, interestingly, we ﬁnd that a quarter to a third of
these overlapping sites are predicted to be bound by the cellular and
viral miRNAs through different binding patterns (see for instance
the predictions in the apoptosis related gene DIDO in Fig. 6). In
addition, we ﬁnd several individual viral miRNAs that show a
higher than expected overlap between their predicted targets and
those of a cellular miRNA (P < 0.05 by a hypergeomertic test with
FDR correction for 0.05, see Table 2). For these highly overlapping
miRNAs, a certain degree of sequence similarity is observed as
well. One example is the KSHV miRNA miR—Kl2—ll, known to
function as an orthologue of the human miRNA miR—155 and
showing a substantial overlap in predicted binding sites (Gottwein
et al., 2007). Another example is the KSHV miRNA miR—Kl2—
7 for which its predicted sites highly overlap the predicted sites
of the human miRNA miR—2l6a. The human miRNA miR—2l6
was shown to be a negative regulator of apoptosis (Cheng et al.,
2005) and it is possible that the KSHV miR—Kl2—7 has evolved
to exploit the binding sites of hsa—miR—2l6 acquiring its anti—
apoptotic function in order to increase the virus’ survival within
the host cell.

4 CONCLUSIONS

In summary, we expand the repertoire of seed sites with additional
non—conventional sites, which have been somewhat overlooked.
While the prediction of this wide repertoire of sites is expected to

three overlapping sites of viral seed sites with cellular 3’ compensatory sites
(second to forth boxes from the 5’ —end). 3’ UTR sequences appear in black,
viral miRNA sequences are the upper sequence and appear in red and cellular
miRNA sequences are the lower sequences and appear in blue. Of note,
the predictions of different binding sites for miRNAs from all three herpes
viruses (HCMV, KSHV and EBV) in this gene may suggest convergent
evolution of these viruses to target this important gene involved in apoptosis
regulation.

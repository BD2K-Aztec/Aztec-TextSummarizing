ABSTRACT

Motivation: The development of glycomics technologies in recent
years has produced a sufficient amount of data to begin analyzing
the glycan structures present in various organisms and tissues. In
particular, glycan profiling using mass spectrometry (MS) and
tandem MS has generated a large amount of data that are waiting
to be analyzed. The Consortium for Functional Glycomics (CFG) has
provided a web resource for obtaining such glycan profiling data
easily. Although an interactive spectrum viewer is provided on the
website as a Java applet, it is not necessarily easy to search for par-
ticular glycans or to find commonalities between different tissues in a
single organism, for example. Therefore, to allow users to better take
advantage of the valuable glycome data that can be obtained from
mass spectra and other leading technologies, we have developed a
tool called Glycome Atlas which is pre-loaded with the data from the
CFG and is also able to visualize local glycan profiling data for human
and mouse.

Results: We have developed a tool to allow users to visualize and
perform queries of glycome data. This tool, called GlycomeAtlas, is
pre-loaded with glycome data as provided by the CFG. Moreover,
users can load their own local glycome data into this tool to visualize
and perform queries on their own data.

Availability: This tool is available at the following URL: http://www
.rings.t.soka.ac.jp/GlycomeAtlas/GUI.html.

1 INTRODUCTION

Recent advancements in glycomics technologies have enabled the
glycome proﬁling of various cells and tissues. This is evidenced
by the Consortium for Functional Glycomics (CFG) (Ismail
et al., 2011; North at al., 2012; Raman et al. 2005, 2006),
which has made available a large amount of such proﬁling
data for various human and mouse samples, obtained from
electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (ES-MS/MS) and
matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-ﬁight mass
spectrometry (MALDI—TOF MS) analysis. The majority of
these data have been annotated with glycan structures using
Cartoonist (Goldberg et al., 2009). The CFG web page at
http://www.functionalglycomics.org/ also provides a Java
applet which allows users to interactively view the actual mass
spectra for each sample, in addition to PDF and JPG images
of the spectra. Using this Java applet, users can zoom into a par-
ticular mass peak and see the glycan structures corresponding to

each peak. Although useful, however, users who would want to
view commonalities between different samples, or patterns of
glycans between different tissues or even organisms, would
not be able to do so. Therefore, we have developed the
GlycomeAtlas, which is a Flash-based application that can visu-
alize the glycan structures across different tissues in human and
mouse. Users can also search for particular glycans across the
different tissues, and new glycome data can also be uploaded
using the Proﬁle Input option for users to visualize their own
data.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

Text versions of the proﬁling data were obtained from the CFG
website for each wild-type tissue sample in human and mouse.
These data are stored in a MySQL database on the RINGS
resource (Akune et al., 2010) at http://www.rings.t.soka.ac.jp/.
GlycomeAtlas was built using Adobe Flash Professional CS4,
using Adobe Flex and Flash Builder 4. ActionScript 3.0 was
used to implement the web interface functionality, and Java
Server Pages (J SP) was used to interact with the database.

3 FEATURES

The main features of GlycomeAtlas include glycan proﬁle visu-
alization of human and mouse tissue samples, as provided by the
CFG, glycan structure search of proﬁle data and visualization of
results, and glycan proﬁle input for users who have their own
glycome data which they wish to analyze. Each of these features
is described in detail here.

3.1 Glycan proﬁle visualization

The main interface of GlycomeAtlas is depicted in Figure l. The
left-hand list of buttons provide a variety of functionality. The
‘Home’ button will jump to the RINGS web resource where this
tool is housed. The ‘Help’ button will display the Help page of
RINGS, the ‘Feedback’ button will display the Feedback form
of RINGS in a new window and the “Data source’ button will
display a dialog listing the tissue sample data that are stored in
the database for this tool. In Figure l, the heart of human has
been selected. The glycan structures annotated to have been
found in the selected sample are illustrated on the right panel,
using the monosaccharide symbols as deﬁned by the CFG (Varki
et al., 2009).

The center panel has two tabs of illustrations: one for human
and the other for mouse samples. The list of available tissues is
also listed next to the drawings, along with the number of glycans

Fig. 1. The main interface of GlycomeAtlas. Here, the user has clicked on
the heart in the diagram. Therefore, the right panel displays the glycan
structures that have been annotated to be present in the human heart
sample

annotated for each sample. In addition to clicking directly on the
diagram, the tissue name in the list can also be clicked to obtain
the same data (in the case of skin or lymph node, which may be
more difﬁcult to click directly). Note that the glycans listed have
been analyzed using MALDI—TOF MS, so the glycosidic bond
information is unavailable and some glycans have ambiguous
linkages (such as the upper right-most glycan structure in
Fig. l where the ﬁnal terminal mannose residue exists but its
parent residue is undetermined).

3.2 Glycan structure search

To search for a particular glycan structure, the user can click the
‘Glycan search’ button in the menu list on the left and a new
dialog box will appear. Here, a glycan structure should be
speciﬁed in LinearCode® (Banin et al., 2002) format. This
format is available from the CFG website for all of the glycan
structures registered in their database. It is a linear string format,
allowing it to be easily stored in text ﬁles. For example, the
ﬁve-residue N—glycan core structure would be represented as
Ma3(Ma6)Mb4GNb4GN, where M represents mannose, GN
represents N—acetylglucosamine a and b represent alpha and
beta, respectively, and numbers indicate the linkage position.
Note, however, that since linkage information is not annotated
for the data from the CFG, the following string representation
would ﬁnd hits in the database: M??(M??(M??)M??)M??
GN??GN. After inputting the query string and clicking the
‘draw’ button, a ﬁgure of the glycan structure will be displayed
for the user to conﬁrm the structure. Then clicking ‘input’, the
query structure will be displayed in the area below the drawing.
Multiple glycans can be repeatedly added to this area by using
the ‘Glycan search’ dialog repeatedly. Then by moving the
mouse over any of the query structures, the tissues containing
that exact structure will be highlighted in both the drawing and
in the data list.

From the glycan list on the right panel, a similar search can be
performed. Choking on any glycan structure, that structure will
be copied into the bottom panel and all tissues containing that
structure will be highlighted. Unneeded glycan structures in the
bottom panel can be removed by clicking the ‘X’ at the upper
right corner of the particular structure. Also, adding multiple
copies of the same glycan structure is avoided as glycans that
are added are checked beforehand, and a message window will be
displayed indicating if it has already been selected.

3.3 Glycan proﬁle input

When a user has their own customized list of glycan structures
for a particular human or mouse sample, the data can be visua-
lized with this tool. The ‘Proﬁle input’ button will display a
dialog box for the user to specify a text ﬁle containing this in-
formation. A sample dataset is also provided to illustrate the
format, which consists of three tabbed columns for organism
(human or mouse), organ and glycan structure in
LinearCodeheX’reg’S’eer] format. When the data are loaded, the
table below will display the parsed list for the user to conﬁrm.
Errors in the text will be displayed in red in this table. Then by
clicking the ‘input’ button, the data will be loaded into the
display.

4 DISCUSSION

We present an innovative tool for analyzing glycan proﬁling
data, without regard to the manner in which it has been ob-
tained. Although the current database contains glycan structures
with undeﬁned linkage information, this tool can also handle
fully deﬁned glycan structures. With the visualization of glycan
structures in various tissues, the user can get an idea of glycan
structure localization, and this tool can aid as an educational
resource as well. We plan on further developing this tool to per-
form higher level analyses to compare differences between tissues
and animals. Moreover, easier methods for inputting glycan
structures are also being investigated.

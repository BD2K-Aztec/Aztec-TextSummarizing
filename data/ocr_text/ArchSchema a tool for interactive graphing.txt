ABSTRACT

Summary: ArchSchema is a Java Web Start application that
generates a dynamic 2D network of related Pfam domain
architectures. Each node corresponds to a different architecture
(shown as a sequence of coloured boxes) and indicates whether any
3D structural information is available in the PDB. Satellite nodes can
show either the UniProt codes or the PDB codes of proteins having
the given architecture. Search options allow search by UniProt code
or Pfam domain identifier, and results can be filtered by domain,
organism, or by selecting only proteins in the PDB.

Availability: ArchSchema can be freely accessed at
http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/archschema

1 INTRODUCTION

Domains are the fundamental evolutionary building blocks of
proteins (Bork, 1992), some occurring particularly frequently,
allowing the assembly of myriad proteins from a modest stock
of units (Bashton and Chothia, 2002, 2007). A given sequence of
domains deﬁnes a protein’s domain architecture. Many different
proteins, in terms of sequence and/or function, can have the same,
or very similar, architectures.

The Pfam database (Bateman et al., 2002) identiﬁes protein
domains on the basis of sequence alignments, hidden Markov
models and manual curation. It can list all the architectures
containing any domain and, in turn, all sequences belonging to any of
these architectures. There are several other resources that exploit the
Pfam data, focusing on domain architectures. PfamAlyzer (Hollich
and Sonnhammer, 2007) provides a graphical user interface that
allows searches for domain patterns, listing the architectures that
match. CDART (Geer et al., 2002) and DAhunter (Lee and Lee,
2008) both identify homologous proteins based on the similarity
of their domain architectures. The web server d—Omix (Wichadakul
et al., 2009) can show static 2D graphs of similarities in domain
architectures for a user—submitted set of protein sequences.

Here, we describe ArchSchema that shows related Pfam domain
architectures as a dynamic graph rather than as a list of matches.
It provides a clear 2D Visualization of how the architectures are
related. A further advantage over other methods is that it ﬂags any

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

nodes which have associated 3D structural information in the Protein
Data Bank, PDB (Berman et al., 2003).

2 METHODS

ArchSchema is a Java Web Start application that uses data derived from the
Pfam, UniProt (The UniProt Consortium, 2010) and PDBsum (Laskowski,
2009) databases. It makes use of two freely available Java libraries, namely
the Prefuse Visualization toolkit for generating the dynamic graphs and
the BrowserLauncher by Eric Alberts of Stanford University. Similarities
between architectures are computed using a simple Needleman and Wunsch
alignment (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970), and nearest—neighbours are
joined by edges, as described in the program’s online documentation.

3 RESULTS

ArchSchema can be launched from the ArchSchema home
page (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/archschema) or from links within
PDBsum. It can also be downloaded and installed locally for use
when needed.

3.1 Example: human CBL-C protein

Figure 1a shows an initial ArchSchema graph for human CBL—
C protein (UniProt code CBLC_HUMAN), a signal transduction
protein, which has no structures in the PDB. The protein consists of
four Pfam domains and its domain architecture is indicated by the
larger node with a grey background at the centre of the graph. This
is termed the ‘parent architecture’. The graph contains 18 related
architectures in all, each having one or more of the parent’s four
domains; 11 of the architectures contain all four domains. Details
are provided in a ‘data panel’ (Figure lb) that lists all the domains
on the graph in descending order of their frequency.

One can pan and zoom around the graph using click—and—drag
operations and can ‘switch on’ satellite nodes to show either the
UniProt sequences associated with each node (Figure 1c), or the
PDB codes of structures belonging to each node (Figure 1d). Where
there is a huge number of additional nodes, only 50 are shown and
are coloured pink to indicate a particularly popular architecture. The
lengths of the edges joining the nodes can be adjusted using a slider
bar, while another slider bar allows you to prune the outer nodes in
very large networks.

Clicking on a node of interest in the graph lists its UniProt
sequences in the data panel. These are hyperlinked to the UniProt
database and, any that have 3D structures in the PDB, are
hyperlinked to PDBsum. This provides a means of tracking down
protein structural information from related domain architectures.

Fig. 1. Examples of ArchSchema graphs for the signal transduction protein CBLC_HUMAN. (a) Initial graph showing all domain architectures sharing one
or more of the four domains belonging to CBLC_HUMAN (the ‘parent architecture’, the slightly enlarged node with a grey background in the middle of the
graph). The coloured boxes correspond to different Pfam domains: tall boxes for Pfam—A domains and short boxes for Pfam—B domains. Architectures with
proteins that have structural models in the PDB are annotated by a red line under the domains that have been structurally determined: a long red line indicates
that the structure encompasses at least 90% of the domain’s residues, a short red line that the structure covers <90% of the domain, and no line means there is
no (or very little, i.e. <50%) structural information available. A continuous line joining two or more domains means that one or more 3D structures contain all
the underlined domains together, whereas if the line between the domains is broken it means that the domains are found only in separate PDB entries. (b) The
key to the graph from the ‘data panel’ listing the Pfam domains in the parent architecture plus all domains on the plot in descending order of occurrence. (c) A
small part of the network, centred on the parent node, with satellite nodes added (coloured light blue) showing the UniProt sequences having each architecture.
((1) The top part of the graph in (a), with the satellite nodes (light yellow) representing PDB entries for proteins having the given domain architecture. Note
that the relative positions of the nodes adjust whenever any satellite nodes are added or removed as the network’s layout is dynamically optimized.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

We would like to thank Rob Finn and Marija Buljan for useful
comments on the program.

For example, the red line in topmost node in Figure 1a indicates that
one or more 3D structures of the ﬁrst four domains exist—precisely
the four domains of our CBLC_HUMAN protein.

3.1.] Reﬁning the search A search panel, in a separate tab, allows COnﬂiCt OfImereSt 3 none (160131” Cd-
you to reﬁne your search or to start a new search—perhaps to further
explore any of the architectures on the current graph. If the parent
sequence contains several different domains, you can search for
architectures containing any one, or more, of these domains. You
can ﬁlter the search by restricting it to a speciﬁc organism. And
ﬁnally, you can limit the search to just those proteins for which
there is structural information in the PDB.

3.1.2 Excessive data In some cases, the initial search may return
a vast number of related architectures. For example, the human
tumour suppressor protein BRCAl returns 2379 architectures that
contain at least one of its two Pfam domains, corresponding to 10 361
different UniProt protein sequences. This would be far too much data
to easily make sense of if displayed at once. Thus, ArchSchema uses
two strategies to focus on the most interesting part of the network
whenever the number of architectures exceeds 150. First, the Pfam—
B domains in all the architectures are replaced by a single dummy
domain, code PB000000. In the case of BRCA1_HUMAN, this
‘collapses’ the number of unique architectures to 954. These are
further ﬁltered according to their computed similarity to the parent
architecture. Only the closest 150 architectures, or thereabouts, are
retained and shown on the plot.

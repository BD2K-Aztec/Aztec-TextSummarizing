ABSTRACT

Motivation: Currently, there is great interest in detecting complex trait
rare variant associations using next-generation sequence data. On a
monthly basis, new rare variant association methods are published. It
is difficult to evaluate these methods because there is no standard to
generate data and often comparisons are biased. In order to fairly
compare rare variant association methods, it is necessary to generate
data using realistic population demographic and phenotypic models.
Result: SimRare is an interactive program that integrates generation
of rare variant genotype/phenotype data and evaluation of association
methods using a unified platform. Variant data are generated for gene
regions using forward-time simulation that incorporates realistic popu-
lation demographic and evolutionary scenarios. Phenotype data can
be obtained for both case—control and quantitative traits. SimRare has
a user-friendly interface that allows for easy entry of genetic and
phenotypic parameters. Novel rare variant association methods imple-
mented in R can also be imported into SimRare, to evaluate their
performance and compare results, e.g. power and Type I error, with
other currently available methods both numerically and graphically.

1 INTRODUCTION

Currently, there is great interest in detecting complex trait rare
variant associations. Next-generation sequencing technologies,
e.g. Illumina HiSeq, ABI 454 and Roche SOLiD, have made it
possible to cost-effectively identify rare variants through the gen-
eration of exome and whole-genome sequence data. It has been
demonstrated that for complex traits testing individual rare vari-
ants is grossly underpowered (Gorlov et al., 2008). Therefore, a
large number of rare variant association methods, which aggre-
gate variants across a region, which is usually a gene, have been
developed. However, comparing the power of these methods by
reviewing the literature is difﬁcult, because there is no regularity
in data generation and sometimes to make a particular method
appear more powerful than others, data are generated in an un-
realistic manner. Although variant data can be obtained for ex-
ample from the 1000 Genomes Project (The 1000 Genomes
Project Consortium, 2010) and The National Heart, Lung, and
Blood Institute (NHLBI) Exome Sequencing Project (Tennessen

et al., 2012), due to limited samples sizes, it is not possible to
generate variant data which is reﬂective of the true distribution
of rare variants (e.g. singletons and doubletons). It is therefore
crucial to be able to incorporate evolutionary history to generate
large samples of variant data.

The SimRare program was developed to evaluate Type I and
II errors of rare variant complex trait association methods by
generating both variant and phenotype data using realistic
models. SimRare, which has a graphical interface, is written in
Python/C++ and can incorporate R scripts for the evaluation of
novel and existing methods.

2 DESCRIPTION

2.1 Generation of variant data

SimRare can generate variant data using several existing popula-
tion genetics and demographic models (e.g. Boyko et al., 2008;
Kryukov et al., 2009) or parameters for other models can be
speciﬁed. Variant data are generated using forward-time simula-
tion (Peng and Kimmel, 2005; Peng and Liu, 2010). This imple-
mentation is superior to other methods (Liu et al., 2008) in that
it incorporates a realistic evolutionary model, which includes dem-
ography, variable mutation rates, recombination, multi-locus ﬁt-
ness effect and locus-speciﬁc selection models including purifying
selection. Using these population demographic models, it is pos-
sible to generate variant data, for different populations, e. g.
European and African. Additionally, haplotypes that have been
generated using other simulation methods can be implemented.
Variant data can also be generated based on the spectrum of vari-
ant frequencies estimated from exome or whole-genome sequence
data such as the NHLBI-Exome Sequencing Project.

2.2 Generation of phenotype data

To evaluate Type I, it is only necessary to generate data under
the null hypothesis, i.e. trait and variants are not associated;
therefore it sufﬁces to generate variant data for a region, uncon-
ditional on the phenotype. To evaluate Type II errors/power, it is
necessary to generate trait data conditional on the variant data
within a region. Either conditional or unconditional on the gen-
erated variant data, SimRare can generate phenotype data for
both case—control and quantitative traits using for a wide range
of genetic etiologic assumptions: including penetrance-prevalence
model, liability threshold model, population attributable risk
and linear model. The underlying genetic mode of inheritance
can be speciﬁed, e. g. additive and dominant. For quantitative

traits, a random or an extreme trait sample can be generated.
When an extreme quantitative trait sample is generated, the
ranges can be speciﬁed, e.g. upper 90% and lower 10%. All
sample sizes can be user-speciﬁed. Causal variants within a
‘gene’ region can either have an effect which is unidirectional
e.g. all variants increase disease risk or are bidirectional, e.g.
can either decrease or increase quantitative trait values. A pro-
portion of the variants can also be non-causal. For causal vari-
ants, the magnitude of the effect can either be ﬁxed, i.e. all causal
variants have the same effect size or variable, effect size is deter-
mined by frequency or selection coefﬁcients.

2.3 Analysis of data and evaluation of Type I and II errors

It is possible to analyze the generated data using a wide range of
complex trait rare variant association methods, e. g. combined
multivariate and collapsing method (Li and Leal, 2008), weighted
sum statistic (Madsen and Browning, 2009), variable threshold
(Price et al., 2010) and Kernel-based adaptive cluster (Liu and
Leal, 2010). Additionally, any newly developed rare variant as-
sociation method written in R can be evaluated using SimRare.
For case—control studies and randomly ascertained quantitative
trait studies, qualitative and quantitative analysis is performed,
respectively. While for an extreme quantitative trait sample, the
data can be dichotomized and qualitative analysis performed or
the quantitative trait values can be analyzed. For rare variant
association methods where signiﬁcance cannot be evaluated ana-
lytically, P—Values can be obtained empirically through permuta-
tion. For the evaluation of Type I and II error, the user
determines the number of permutations and/ or replicates which
should be generated.

2.4 Software overview

SimRare, a stand-alone executable software, is compiled for
Windows, Mac and Linux operating systems. Installation of R
is only required if it is desired to evaluate novel methods.
SimRare consists of three major modules: simulation of
sequence-based genotype data, generation of phenotype data
and evaluation of association methods. SimRare has a
user-friendly interface. Output from SimRare can either take
the form of tables or graphs, e.g. QQ plots for Type I errors
and bar graphs to display power. Additionally, simulated data
can be written to external ﬁles in standard linkage format.

Benchmark tests were performed on a 64-bit machine with
Intel 3.2GHz CPU and 8 GB RAM installed with the Ubuntu
Linux operating system. First 100 haplotype pools were gener-
ated using a population demographic model described by
Kryukov et al. (2009) model; the time to generate each pool
was 1.8 min. The generated haplotype pools can be used for all
subsequent power analyses. The total computation time for the
power analysis was 18.4 min when 1000 replicates were generated
each with 1000 case and 1000 controls and power was evaluated
using the combined multivariate and collapsing method (Li and
Leal, 2008).

3 DISCUSSION

SimRare, as a simulation platform with integrated modules
of data generation and statistical analysis, can be widely used

at many different levels for rare variant association studies.
SimRare can be used to impartially assess the power and robust-
ness of novel and existing rare variant association methods under
a broad range of scenarios. These features should greatly aid
researchers in the development of rare variant association meth-
ods. SimRare can also assist genetic epidemiological study de-
signs by allowing the power to be tested for a wide variety of
scenarios. For instance, for a population-based case—control
exome-sequence study SimRare can be used determine the neces-
sary sample size to achieve adequate power under a variety of
different phenotypic and genetic models.

SimRare will greatly increase the ability and speed in which
researchers can develop novel methods. SimRare allows re-
searchers to create methods without having to develop special
software to generate data in order to evaluate their methods.
It also facilitates an easy way to compare their method to
existing methods, because evaluation can be performed on con-
sistent datasets and additionally it is not necessary to write
software to implement existing methods for comparison pur-
poses. Ultimately, we expect this universally functional soft-
ware equipped with user-friendly interface to aid genetic
epidemiologists and statistical geneticist in the development of
methods and the design of sequence-based genetic association
studies.

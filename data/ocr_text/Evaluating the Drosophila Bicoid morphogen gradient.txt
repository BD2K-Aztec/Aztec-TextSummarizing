ABSTRACT

Motivation: We describe a statistical model to dissect the noise in
transcriptional bursts in a developmental system.

Results: We assume that, at any given moment of time, each copy
of a native gene inside a cell can exist in either a bursting (active)
or non-bursting (inactive) state. The experimentally measured total
noise in the transcriptional states of a gene in a population of cells
can be mathematically dissected into two contributing components:
internal and external. While internal noise quantifies the stochastic
nature of transcriptional bursts, external noise is caused by cell-
to-cell differences including fluctuations in activator concentration.
We use our developed methods to analyze the Drosophila Bicoid
(Bcd) morphogen gradient system. For its target gene hunchback
(hb), the noise properties can be recapitulated by a simplified gene
regulatory model in which Bcd acts as the only input, suggesting
that the external noise in hb transcription is primarily derived from
fluctuations in the Bcd activator input. However, such a simplified
gene regulatory model is insufficient to predict the noise properties
of another Bcd target gene, orthodenticle (otd), suggesting that otd
transcription is sensitive to additional external fluctuations beyond
those in Bcd. Our results show that analysis of the relationship
between input and output noise can reveal important insights into
how a morphogen gradient system works. Our study also advances
the knowledge about transcription at a fundamental level.

1 INTRODUCTION

Transcription is an inherently noisy molecular process that takes
place as burst—like events (Boettiger and Levine, 2009; Eldar and
Elowitz, 2010; Friedman et al., 2006; Ma, 2011; Raj et al., 2006; To
and Maheshri, 2010). How the incoherent transcriptional bursts lead
to coherent and precise gene expression patterns during development
is a fundamental question and a subject of intense investigations
(Martinez Arias and Hayward, 2006). It has been suggested that
averaging over time and/or space allows a biological system to gain
coherence and improve expression boundary precision (Erdmann
et al., 2009; Gregor et al., 2007; He et al., 2010a; Okabe—Oho et al.,

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

2009; Tostevin et al., 2007). To fully understand how precise gene
expression patterns are achieved in response to morphogen inputs,
it is necessary to have methods that can evaluate the experimentally
detected transcriptional bursts before such averaging takes place.
Here we develop a statistical model for such a purpose, where we
mathematically dissect the experimentally measured total noise into
the internal and external components.

We use our model to analyze our experimental data extracted from
early Drosophila embryos (He et al., 2011), where both the nuclear
concentrations of the activator Bicoid (Bed) and the transcriptional
states of its target genes hunchback (hb) and orthodenticle (otd)
are simultaneously measured. We show that the dissected external
noise in hb transcriptional bursts can be implicitly derived from
the measured Bcd input noise. In contrast, additional input noise
is required to account for both the measured total noise and the
dissected external noise in otd transcription. These results suggest
that, although Bcd acts as a direct and sustained input for both
otd and hb transcription (He et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2011), these
two target genes are distinct from each other. Our ﬁndings are
consistent with recent studies (Kim et al., 2011a, b; Lohr et al.,
2009; Ochoa—Espinosa et al., 2009), suggesting that, in addition to
Bed, otd transcription also responds to other input(s) and, thus, is
sensitive to additional external ﬂuctuations. Our study provides an
example illustrating the use of dissecting experimentally measured
transcriptional noise in understanding the mechanistic operations of
a native morphogen gradient system.

2 METHODS

To obtain our published dataset (He er al., 2011), we combined ﬂuorescence
in situ hybridization with immunostaining on l—4h w1118 embryos. Here,
we used ﬂattened embryos to maximize the number of nuclei per embryo
and we took ~6 Confocal z—section images in 0.5 gm intervals to capture
all the intron dots. Our imaging setting was maintained the same for
different embryos on different slides with all images captured in a single
imaging cycle. Thus the datasets under our experimental conditions have
the same molecule number—to—intensity rescaling factors, which make it
possible to combine the data extracted from different embryos and group
nuclei according to their A—P positions. In our detection for intron dots,
the deﬁnition of thresholds is according to He er al. (2011) and the threshold
setting was optimized to detect a stable pattern of the intron dot expression. A
comparison between machine—recognized intron dots and human—recognized
dots indicates an uncertainty of 8% in our analysis. See He er al. (2011)
for further technical details and intron dot data quality, and He er al. (2008,
2010a) for Bed data quality under our experimental conditions. In our current
analysis, we use each detected intron dot to denote a gene copy that is actively

transcribing in a snapshot (see main text for details). The distributions of
experimentally detected intron dot numbers suggest that the two copies of
hb or otd in a nucleus are independent (not shown).

3 RESULTS
3.1 A statistical model for evaluating transcriptional
noise

Let us consider a standard diploid cell that has two identical copies
of a gene. At a given moment of time, i.e. in a snapshot of the
cell, each copy can exist in either an actively—transcribing (bursting)
or non—transcribing (non—bursting) state. Experimentally, actively
transcribing gene copies can be detected as ‘intron dots’ (see Section
2 and further on for experimental details). We deﬁne gene copies that
are actively transcribing as active copies and those that are not as
inactive copies. We assume that both copies of the gene in this cell
are independent of each other. They have an identical probability
p of existing as active copies. Thus, the probability of this cell to
have k active copies of the gene in a snapshot can be expressed as
in Equation (1). The mean and noise (i.e. fractional variance) of the
numbers of active copies in this cell are ,0 2 2p and 772 = (1 — p) / 2p.

p(k)= (:)p"(1—p)Z—k. for ken, 1, 2} (1)

We then consider a population of N cells. We assume that all copies
of the gene in this population are independent. For the i—th cell in
this population, we denote the probability of its gene copies existing
as active copies by 19,-. We now evaluate all copies of the gene in all
the cells in this population. The mean and noise of number of active
copies per cell can be expressed, respectively, as in Equations (2)
and (3).

In Equation (3), the total noise of the stated system, mot, is a simple
sum of two components. One component is from the noise in p,
which is induced by cell—to—cell differences that we deﬁne as external
noise, next. The other contribution, which we deﬁne as internal
noise, mm, is proportional to the variance of the intrinsic binomial
distribution of the binary states, which is calculated for each cell
and then averaged over the entire population of cells. The quantity
([92) can be calculated as:

(p2)=p2(1+n30.)—p. (4)

By experimentally measuring the mean number of active copies (,0)
and its total noise (mot), we can obtain both next and 77th as:

In Supplementary Material, we present a general case of noise
dissection in cells with 6 identical copies of a gene. As discussed
there, for genes with a single copy per cell (c :1), such as X—linked
genes in Drosophila males, the quantity ([92) cannot be measured
and, consequently, next and 77th cannot be dissected in our model.

The approach described above for noise dissection is broadly
analogous to the previous concepts developed for single—cell systems
(Elowitz et al., 2002; Hilﬁnger and Paulsson, 2011; Raser and
O’Shea, 2004; Raser and O’Shea, 2005; Swain et al., 2002; Thattai
and van Oudenaarden, 2001), but it has several important features.
In particular, the noise deﬁned here is based on the active and
inactive copies of a gene, data that can be extracted from snapshots
without the need to acquire live—imaging data. In addition, it is
based on the endogenous copies of the gene (see Section 2 and
further on for experimental details) and does not require engineered
reporters such as dual reporters. The dual—reporter analysis requires
an assumption that the two reporters and their products are identical
because differences between the two reporters and products can
falsely contribute to the internal noise component. The use of
the endogenous gene copies as in our study does not require this
assumption because both copies and their products are identical.
Furthermore, as discussed below, our experimental system is an
entire embryo, where technically cells have not yet been formed
at the time of analysis. Thus, the external source of ﬂuctuations
estimated in our study includes both embryo—to—embryo and nucleus—
to—nucleus variances. For this reason, we use the terms ‘internal’ and
‘external’ as opposed to ‘intrinsic’ and ‘extrinsic’.

3.2 Propagation of activator input noise to
transcriptional noise

We now consider the external noise in an ideal, simpliﬁed gene
regulatory system where an activator is the only input for its target
gene’s transcriptional output. As before (Gregor et al., 2007; He
et al., 2008, 2011), we use a Hill function to describe the relationship
between the expected probability of a gene copy to exist as an active
copy ([9) and the activator concentration inside the nucleus of a
cell (B):

pmax
1+(B/K)—h ’ (7)

where pmax, K and h are, respectively, the maximal burst probability,
the activator concentration at half maximal burst probability and
the Hill coefﬁcient. These values can be adjusted in theoretical
studies for evaluating the behavior of different target genes or
different transcription system. They can also be calculated directly
from experimental data (see below). Equation (7) makes it possible,
similar to propagation of errors (Gregor et al., 2007), to directly
convert ﬂuctuations in activator concentration, 773 =6B/B, to the
variance of the burst probability of its target gene:

Fig. 1. Parameters affecting noise propagation. Activator input noise is
converted to external noise (next) in target gene transcription based on
Equation (10) in a simpliﬁed gene regulatory model. Here, next is shown as a
function of ,0), the mean number of active copies. The effects of parameters
that affect noise propagation are also shown. Such parameters include the
activator noise strength (v), the activator threshold concentration (K) and the
Hill coefﬁcient (h). Figure 1A shows that next increases as the normalized
noise strength (v/K) increases. Figure 1B shows that, at a given v/K, the
effect of h on next is sensitive to ,0.

As deﬁned in Equation (3), the external noise (next) in the
transcriptional bursts of the target gene is the noise in p:

To facilitate calculations in a theoretical analysis, we assume (He
et al., 2010a; Tkacik et al., 2008; Tostevin et al., 2007) that the
noise in the nuclear concentration of this activator, B, is Poissonian,
772B :12 / B, where v is referred to as the noise strength. Applying this
distribution of 773 to Equation (9) leads to the expression of next as
a function of ,0:

2 _ th pmax 1/h [0 2

next— K < p 1) (1 pmax) . (10)
Figure 1 shows next, converted from activator input noise according
to Equation (10), as a function of p/pmax. Figure 1A and B show
the effects of v/K and h, respectively, on next. Thus, next can be
calculated by two distinct methods: one that is based on the active
and inactive states of the gene copies with the noise in transcription
dissected according to Equation (5), and another that is based on
the activator input noise that is converted to next using the input—
output relationship in Equation (10). These two calculations should
arrive at the same next value in the ideal, simpliﬁed gene regulatory
system. We will use this property of an ideal, simpliﬁed system to
evaluate those of the real biological systems. In particular, if the
next values calculated from these two methods are similar, it would
suggest that the actual biological system can be approximated by
the simpliﬁed gene regulatory system, but a signiﬁcant deviation
between these two values would be indicative of oversimpliﬁcation
of the real biological system.

3.3 Evaluation of hb transcription data suggests a
dominant role of Bcd input

We now evaluate experimental data extracted from early Drosophila
embryos (He et al., 2011). Bed is a transcriptional activator
that forms an anterior—to—posterior (A—P) gradient (Driever
and Nusslein—Volhard, 1988; Houchmandzadeh et al., 2002). It

instructs embryonic patterning by activating its target genes in a
concentration—dependent manner (Ephrussi and St Johnston, 2004;
Grimm et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2011; Porcher and Dostatni, 2010).
During the period of Bed action (i.e. at the syncytial stage of
embryonic development), all nuclei undergo synchronous mitotic
divisions and, thus, nuclear Bcd concentration represents a primary
source of nucleus—to—nucleus differences relevant to Bed target gene
transcription. In our simpliﬁed gene regulatory model, cell—to—cell
differences arise solely from activator concentration differences. In
addition, our previous analyses of hb expression proﬁles in embryos
with perturbed Bcd gradient properties suggest that Bcd acts as a
dominant input at early nuclear cycle 14, a time for our current
analysis (Cheung et al., 2011; He et al., 2008, 2010a, 2010b, 2011;
Liu and Ma, 2011; Liu et al., 2011). At earlier cycles, maternal
Hb acts as an additional input for zygotic hb transcription (Porcher
et al., 2010). In our simpliﬁed gene regulatory model, the activator
is the only input for the active copies of its target gene. These
considerations suggest that hb represents an excellent candidate of a
native Bcd target gene suitable for evaluation against the simpliﬁed
gene regulatory model.

As detailed previously (He et al., 2011), our experimental dataset
consists of the Bed concentration (in arbitrary units) and the hb
transcriptional states of individual nuclei of ﬁxed wild—type (wt)
embryos. Currently this is the only high—quality combined dataset
that contains both the Bed input data and the hb transcriptional states
in embryos. In our experiments, we used an intronic probe to detect
the nascent hb transcripts, with a simultaneous detection of Bed
through immunostaining. Images of these embryos thus capture, as
in snapshots, distinct ﬂuorescent dots, referred to as the hb intron
dots (He et al., 2011). The reliability of both Bcd input data (He
et al., 2008, 2010a) and the intron dot data (He et al., 2011) under
our experimental conditions has been described previously. For our
current analysis, we count the number of the hb intron dots in
individual nuclei from the relevant parts of individual embryos.
Here, we use a detected hb intron dot to denote an active copy
of the hb gene. We sort our data by binning them according to
the A—P position, and calculate the mean (,0) and noise (mot) of
active copies for nuclei within the bins. Using Equations (5) and
(6), we dissect mot into next and 77th for each bin. Figure 2A shows
a scatter plot (on log—log scale) of the measured mot (blue circles)
and the dissected next (green diamonds) and 77th (red squares) as a
function of ,0. Figure 2A also shows our theoretical predictions (solid
lines) calculated from Equation (10) using the following values that
are derived from ﬁtting the experimental data (see legends): h=6,
12:05 and K :6. Our results show a resemblance between the
measured/dissected noise proﬁles and those calculated theoretically.
They suggest that the experimentally measured (and dissected) noise
properties for hb transcription are broadly similar to those predicted
theoretically in a simpliﬁed gene regulatory model (see Fig. 2 legend
for adjusted RZ—values and below for an experimental system with
contracting behaviors).

In our theoretical predictions shown as solid lines in Figure
2A, a Poissonian distribution of Bed concentration ﬂuctuations is
assumed. To evaluate whether our conclusions are dependent on this
assumption, we directly converted experimentally measured Bcd
input noise to next using Equation (9) without such an assumption.
Figure 2B shows a scatter plot of next values calculated by two
distinct methods (see above): one from the measured noise in hb
intron dot number through Equation (5) (shown as the dissected

Fig. 2. hb and otd have distinct noise properties in relation to the Bed
input noise. The experimentally measured mot (blue circles) in hb (A) and
otd (C) intron dot numbers is dissected into next (green diamonds) and
71th (red squares) according to Equations (5) and (6), and the results are
plotted against ,0. Solid lines are theoretical predictions based on Equation
(10) in the simpliﬁed gene regulatory model. The adjusted Rz—values of
ﬁtting the experimental data with the model for nextmim and mot of hb are,
respectively: 0.85, 0.99 and 1.00; the adjusted Rz—values for next, 71th and
mm of otd are, respectively: —0.48, 0.97 and 0.98. The negative R2 suggests
that, constrained by the measured parameter values, the model cannot predict
next of otd. Arrowheads show the boundary positions of ,0: ,omaX / 2. Here,
K—values are measured as the mean Bcd concentrations at the marked
boundary positions and h—values are extracted by ﬁtting Equation (7) with the
experimentally measured B—p proﬁles (He et 01., 2011). Since ﬂuctuations
in Bed concentration are dominated by Poisson—like molecular noise (He
et 01., 2010a), we perform a simple ﬁtting of the experimentally measured
Bcd noise to Poissonian distribution for extracting v—values. Figure 2B and D
are scatter plots of dissected next (same as in Figures 2A and C but showing
data only from the activation boundary regions for better data spread) against
converted next (see text for details). Here, Figures 2B and C are for hb and
otd, respectively. A linear regression line is also shown (with the equation in
the inset box) for each panel.

next in ﬁgure) and another converted from the experimentally
measured Bcd noise through Equation (9) (shown as the converted
next in ﬁgure). The two next values at individual A—P positions
exhibit good agreement with each other, suggesting that, consistent
with a previous study (He et al., 2010a), molecular (Poissonian)
ﬂuctuations in Bed concentration are a dominant source of the
measured Bcd noise in relevant parts of the embryos under our
experimental conditions. Furthermore, as discussed above, the
experimentally measured (and dissected) noise properties of the
hb transcription system are well approximated by our simpliﬁed
gene regulatory model. Together, they further support the suggestion
that the nucleus—to—nucleus ﬂuctuations in Bed concentration are a
dominant source of the external noise in hb transcriptional bursts
(see also Holloway et al., 2011).

A recent theoretical study (Saunders and Howard, 2009)
has suggested that an exponential morphogen gradient may be
evolutionarily advantageous because of its ability to balance
between the external and internal sources of noise for achieving

precise target gene expression boundaries. Our results show that
the hb boundary position (marked by an arrowhead in Fig. 2A)
coincides with a convergence of noise proﬁles that results in a more
balanced contribution of next and 771m. These results suggest that,
based on Saunders and Howard (2009), the Bed gradient system in
wt embryos may be optimal for the hb boundary precision.

3.4 Dissection of otd transcriptional noise suggests a
role of additional input(s)

In addition to hb, Bcd also activates the expression of another target
gene otd in early Drosophila embryos (Gao and Finkelstein, 1998).
Unlike hb, the Bod—activated otd expression boundary position is
much closer to the anterior of the embryo. Although Bcd also acts
as a direct and sustained input for otd transcription (He et al., 2011),
recent studies suggest that otd expression is subject to regulation by
both the Bed gradient and the terminal system inputs mediated by
a mitogen—activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (Kim et al.,
2011a, b; Lohr et al., 2009; Ochoa—Espinosa et al., 2009; Porcher
and Dostatni, 2010). Thus, the otd transcriptional system may
signiﬁcantly deviate from our simpliﬁed gene regulatory model,
where an activator is assumed to be the only input for its target
gene transcription. To test this idea, we analyze our otd data in a
manner identical to our hb analysis described above. As discussed
in Supplementary Material and above, male embryos have a single
copy of otd (i.e. c: 1) and, thus, such data are not suitable for the
noise dissection. Here, we present our analysis of the otd intron dot
data from female embryos.

Figure 2C shows the measured mot (blue circles) and dissected
77th (red squares) and next (green diamonds) in otd intron dot
number. It also shows the theoretically predicted noise proﬁles
(solid lines) for otd transcription based on our simpliﬁed gene
regulatory model using the following values derived from ﬁtting
the experimental data (see Fig. 2 legend): h :4, v 20.5 and K = 15.
These results show that, in contrast to hb (Fig. 2A), the external
noise in otd transcription dissected from experimental data (green
diamonds) is signiﬁcantly higher than what is theoretically predicted
(green line). As discussed above, these results suggest that, in
addition to the Bed input noise, otd transcription is sensitive to
other source(s) of input (external) noise missing in our simpliﬁed
gene regulatory model. Figure 2C further shows that, unlike the
hb transcriptional system, theoretically predicted mot and 77th also
deviate from the measured/dissected values.

To further evaluate the otd transcriptional system, we plot in
Figure 2D the dissected next against the converted next, values
calculated by the two different methods for different A—P positions
(see above). While dissected next is much higher than converted
next in absolute values, they are correlated with each other. These
results suggest that the proposed additional input (external) noise
for otd transcription is correlated with Bcd input noise. We currently
do not know the exact source of this noise. It is interesting to note
that recent studies have revealed a retroactive regulatory mechanism
where Bcd, a MAPK substrate, can in turn affect MAPK activity and
its availability to other substrates (Kim et al., 2011a, b). It remains
to be investigated whether the retroactivity of Bed on MAPK may
represent a potential mechanism that can lead to an ‘ampliﬁcation’
of the Bed input noise in term of otd transcription.

4 CONCLUSIONS

Our analysis of the noise properties of transcriptional bursts in
response to an activator input provides a useful framework for
investigating how developmental decisions are made. An important
feature of our statistical model is that it does not require knowledge
about, or modeling of, the speciﬁc molecular steps leading to such
stochastic bursts. The feasibility to capture the actively—transcribing
copies of a variety of native genes in early Drosophila embryos
(Boettiger and Levine, 2009; Pare et al., 2009; Wilkie et al.,
1999) suggests that our model may be of general use in evaluating
other transcriptional systems. As shown in our current study,
dissection of noise in transcription, coupled with the simultaneous
measurement of the activator input noise, can provide critical
insights—at a systems level—into whether the activator in hand is a
dominant input for a gene’s transcription in a native developmental
system. Understanding the relationship between the morphogen
input and target genes’ transcriptional output is crucial to advancing
the morphogen concept, a cornerstone of developmental biology
(Kerszberg and Wolpert, 2007; Lander, 2007; Wartlick et al., 2009).
These results suggest that, consistent with our recent studies (Cheung
et al., 2011; He et al., 2008, 2010a, 2010b, 2011; Liu et al., 2011),
Bed is a dominant input for lib expression at the time of our
analysis. The observed properties for lib contrast with those of otd,
suggesting the contribution of another input(s) for otd transcription.
Together, our ﬁndings represent an important step toward enhancing
our knowledge of morphogen action at a systems level.

Our study also advances our knowledge about transcription at
a fundamental level. As discussed recently (Hilﬁnger and Paulsson,
2011), in dual—reporter studies performed in single cell systems, cell—
to—cell differences other than activator concentration differences,
e.g. cell cycle stage differences, are also included in the extrinsic
component of transcriptional noise. The nuclei in the embryos that
we analyzed are nearly synchronous with regard to cell cycle stage.
This special property has contributed to our ability to document
experimentally, for the ﬁrst time to our knowledge, that the external
noise of a gene’s transcription can be explained by the activator
input noise.

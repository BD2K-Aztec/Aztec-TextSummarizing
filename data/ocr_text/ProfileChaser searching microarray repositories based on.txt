ABSTRACT

Summary: We introduce ProfileChaser, a web server that allows
for querying the Gene Expression Omnibus based on genome-
wide patterns of differential expression. Using a novel, content-
based approach, ProfileChaser retrieves expression profiles that
match the differentially regulated transcriptional programs in a user-
supplied experiment. This analysis identifies statistical links to similar
expression experiments from the vast array of publicly available data
on diseases, drugs, phenotypes and other experimental conditions.

1 INTRODUCTION

The introduction of the DNA microarray and other genome—level
technologies has provided an unprecedented, systems—level view
of cellular transcription. This detailed characterization of gene
expression provides a unique opportunity for data—driven discovery
of connections between biological conditions and phenotypes.
Past work has demonstrated the utility of gene expression—based
discovery in predicting the mechanisms of genetic and chemical
perturbations (Hughes et al., 2000) and linking drugs and diseases
(Hassane et al., 2008; Lamb et al., 2006), even when integrating
data across different platforms and cell types (Dudley et al., 2009).

While these studies have demonstrated the power of gene
expression—based approaches to biological hypothesis generation,
few tools exist to exploit the primary molecular data cataloged
in repositories such as the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)
(Barrett et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2008). Here we introduce
ProﬁleChaser, a web server that allows for content-based gene
expression search with a user—supplied experiment. Our tool mines
GEO DataSets for experiments that differentially regulate the
same transcriptional programs. ProﬁleChaser provides an accessible
and powerful interface for leveraging public data to inform new

experiments and predict novel associations between diseases, drugs,
genotypes and phenotypes.

2 METHODS

ProﬁleChaser aims to link biological conditions that have similar patterns
of differential gene expression. Conceptually, if the differentially expressed
genes in a ‘breast cancer versus normal tissue’ experiment match the
differentially expressed genes in a ‘Mock versus Drug X’ experiment, we
might predict that drug X could match biological processes involved in
breast cancer. We expand this approach beyond drug—disease relationships
to include all cellular phenotypes, perturbations and genetic modulations:
we leverage GEO DataSet (GDS) annotations as previously described
(Morgan et al., 2009) to automatically generate and search 14974
combinatorial comparisons between experimental conditions comprising
37 710 microarrays from 1815 GEO DataSets.

ProﬁleChaser indexes and searches GEO DataSets using a combination
of previously developed techniques (Fig. 1a) (Chen et al., 2007; Engreitz
et al., 2010a, b). To begin, we apply independent component analysis to
a compendium of human gene expression data, obtaining a reduced set of
gene expression features that describe biologically relevant transcriptional
programs (Engreitz et al., 2010a). We call these features fundamental
components of gene expression. We reduce the dimensionality of GEO
DataSet experiments by mapping genes to their unique human homologs
and projecting the resulting data into the feature space identiﬁed by these
fundamental components. This 50—fold reduction in complexity allows
for speedier and more accurate retrieval of relevant experiments, even
across tissue types, platforms and species (Engreitz et al., 2010b). Next,
we create a diﬁerential expression (DE) proﬁle for each of the 14 875
experimental comparisons, including the fold—change and P—value of DE
for each fundamental component. These DE proﬁles summarize the changes
in the expression of conserved transcriptional programs, and together form
ProﬁleChaser’s main database.

To query this collection of DE proﬁles, the user supplies an experiment
that compares two conditions. ProﬁleChaser generates a DE proﬁle in
feature space as described above, then searches its database to ﬁnd similar
experiments (Fig. 1b). As opposed to Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
(GSEA)—based approaches that require arbitrarily chosen gene—set cutoffs,
we score the similarity between two DE proﬁles using a weighted Pearson’s
correlation: fundamental—component fold—changes are weighted by their P—
value of DE (Engreitz et al., 2010b). A null distribution for this measure
is computed from the correlation coefﬁcients of all 14875 experimental
comparisons, allowing for the calculation of a conservative false discovery
rate for each retrieved result.

For the top results, users can view the genes that contributed most to the
similarity between the query and retrieved comparisons. The Gene Results
page displays a weighted scatterplot of the most signiﬁcant genes, as well

3 RESULTS

To illustrate the utility of our method, we queried ProﬁleChaser to
ﬁnd experiments that resemble the treatment of MCF7 breast cancer
cells with 17,8—estradiol, the natural ligand of estrogen receptor
(GDS3315). The top matching comparisons included several
variations of this experiment performed by separate groups (Fig. 1b,
Supplementary Fig. 81). In addition, ProﬁleChaser identiﬁed other
experimental contexts involving hormone—induced proliferation,
including cytotoxic T cell response to interleukin—2 (GDS3222) and
primary prostate response to testosterone treatment (GDS2562). An
examination of signiﬁcant genes conﬁrmed that proliferation linked
these biological conditions: in the comparison of GDS3315 with
GDS2562, for instance, the second most signiﬁcant gene encoded
Ki—67, the canonical proliferation marker (Supplementary Fig. S2).

Next, we used the comparison of tumorigenic and non—
tumorigenic breast cancer cells (GDS2618) to identify
compounds that might speciﬁcally target these cell subpopulations
(Supplementary Fig. S3). The comparison of dasatinib—resistant
versus dasatinib—sensitive prostate cancer cell lines scored
signiﬁcantly, suggesting that tumorigenic breast cancer cells might
be sensitive to this Src inhibitor. Treating basal breast cancer
cell lines with dasatinib signiﬁcantly decreases the proportion
of ALDHl—positive tumorigenic cells, supporting this hypothesis
(Kurebayashi et al., 2010).

Finally, we recently used these methods to search GEO for
datasets that resembled the comparison of neural stem cells from
wild—type and Fox03_/_ mice (Engreitz et al., 2010b). We

identiﬁed four matching proﬁles that linked Fox03 to hypoxia,
a relationship validated by recent experimental work with our
collaborators (Renault et al., 2009). Thus, experiments retrieved by
ProﬁleChaser provide statistical evidence for associations that may
be veriﬁed by further experimental or computational analyses.

ProﬁleChaser comparisons are deﬁned by GEO annotations,
and thus interpretation of results may not be straightforward. In
particular, experimental designs with multiple factors may confound
analysis (Supplementary Fig. S4). Subset names assigned by GEO
may also be misleading. To properly interpret results, users should
examine the design of each experiment using the GEO web interface
and references therein. ProﬁleChaser cannot take advantage of
potential paired—sample information, and DE proﬁles generated
from the same experiment are not independent, since they contain
overlapping samples. Finally, users should note that the absence of
a positive result does not imply that two conditions are unrelated.

The ability to query GEO based on differential expression
will allow for the identiﬁcation of new associations between
diseases, drugs, genotypes and phenotypes. Future work will expand
ProﬁleChaser to incorporate other sources of gene expression
data, including European Bioinformatics Institute ArrayExpress
(Parkinson et al., 2011).

ABSTRACT

Motivation: In the past years, both sequencing and microarray have
been widely used to search for relations between genetic variations
and predisposition to complex pathologies such as diabetes or neuro-
logical disorders. These studies, however, have been able to explain
only a small fraction of disease heritability, possibly because complex
pathologies cannot be referred to few dysfunctional genes, but are
rather heterogeneous and multicausal, as a result of a combination
of rare and common variants possibly impairing multiple regulatory
pathways. Rare variants, though, are difficult to detect, especially
when the effects of causal variants are in different directions, i.e.
with protective and detrimental effects.

Results: Here, we propose ABACUS, an Algorithm based on a
BivAriate CUmulative Statistic to identify single nucleotide polymorph-
isms (SNPs) significantly associated with a disease within predefined
sets of SNPs such as pathways or genomic regions. ABACUS is
robust to the concurrent presence of SNPs with protective and detri-
mental effects and of common and rare variants; moreover, it is
powerful even when few SNPs in the SNP-set are associated with
the phenotype. We assessed ABACUS performance on simulated
and real data and compared it with three state-of-the-art methods.
When ABACUS was applied to type 1 and 2 diabetes data, besides
observing a wide overlap with already known associations, we found a
number of biologically sound pathways, which might shed light on
diabetes mechanism and etiology.

1 INTRODUCTION

In the past few years, the hereditary component of complex
multifactorial diseases has started to be explored through the
novel paradigm of genome-wide association studies (GWASs).
A GWAS searches for patterns of genetic variation, in the form
of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), between a popula-
tion of affected individuals (cases) and a healthy (control) popu-
lation. Although these studies have successfully identified a
number of significant SNP—disease associations, they were able
to explain only a small fraction of disease heritability (Manolio

et al., 2009). One of the reasons for this lack of success, as al-
ready faced in microarray data analysis (Di Camillo et al., 2012;
Sanavia et al., 2012), is that complex pathologies, such as cancer,
diabetes or neurological disorders, are heterogeneous and multi-
causal, as a result of the alteration of multiple regulatory path-
ways and of the interplay between different genes and the
environment, rather than imputable to a single dysfunctional
gene like monogenic diseases (Moore et al., 2010). Another im-
portant reason is that a combination of rare and common vari-
ants is likely to contribute to the disease (Gibson, 2012). Rare
variants, though, are more difficult to detect than common vari-
ants (Asimit and Zeggini, 2010); in fact, single-marker tests are
not powerful enough when applied in a context of low evidence
of association (relatively low number of subjects carrying the rare
allele) together with the need of correction for multiple testing
(Dudoit et al., 2003).

Several alternatives to single marker tests have been proposed
in the literature to detect rare variants. Multiple marker methods
test the association of a group of variants, e.g. SNPs within the
same gene or pathway, to the disease. In this context, a widely
applied approach is to test for the signiﬁcance of accumulation of
rare alleles within a phenotype, across a group of SNPs. Brieﬂy,
for each subject, SNPs in the same group are collapsed to an
indicator variable summarizing either the proportion of rare vari-
ants that carry at least one minor allele or the presence/absence
of at least one rare variant (Li and Leal, 2008; Madsen
and Browing, 2009; Morgenthaler and Thilly, 2007). These
approaches, known as collapsing methods or burden tests,
loose power when a portion of SNPs increases the risk of disease
and the remaining portion is protective. Multi-marker
approaches alternative to burden tests include the Hotelling
two samples T2 test (Fan and Knapp, 2003), the Zglobal statistic
(Schaid et al., 2005) and the weighted score test proposed by
Wang and Elston (2007). The Hotelling two samples T2 test is
a generalization of the Student’s t-test, whose degrees of freedom
increase with the number of SNPs being simultaneously tested,
thus losing power with the SNP-set size. The Zglobal statistic
and the weighted score test have only one degree of freedom;
however, using these methods implies to know the risk allele at
each variant and, as for burden tests, power is affected by the
relative proportions of SNPs increasing and decreasing the risk
of disease.

Alternatives, whose power does not depend on the SNP-set
size and that do not make any assumption on the direction of the
SNP effect (i.e. on the protective or detrimental effect of the
variants on the phenotype), are the methods based on genotype
similarity between individual in the same group, such as

multivariate distance matrix regression (W essel et al., 2006) and
kernel-based association tests (KBAT) (Mukhopadhyay et al.,
2010). In particular, multivariate distance matrix regression has
been shown to be more powerful for sets of correlated SNPs,
whereas KBAT well handles both correlated and uncorrelated
SNPs (Morris and Zeggini, 2010). In general, these latter meth-
ods based on genotype similarity between individuals are robust
to the direction of genotype risk. However, they have been re-
ported to lose power when higher minor allele frequency (MAF)
SNPs are included in the SNP-set or when many SNPs are jointly
analyzed and only few of them are associated with the disease,
probably due to the relative low number of subjects compared
with the number of possible combinations of rare variants
(Asimit and Zeggini, 2010; Zeggini and Asimit, 2011).
Recently, an optimal uniﬁed approach for rare variant associ-
ation testing has been proposed by Lee et a]. (2012); the method,
called SKAT-O, combines burden tests with a sequence kernel
association test.

Because in general, a combination of rare and common vari-
ants inﬁuencing the genotype with a protective or detrimental
effect is likely to contribute to the disease, an ideal method
should be robust to different MAF, to different direction of
genotype effects and to the number of associated SNPs within
the SNP-set being analyzed. Moreover, it is desirable to gain
some knowledge on the speciﬁc SNPs associated with the disease.
In fact, multi-marker and cumulative test methods assess the
association of a group of markers, but do not distinguish be-
tween associated and not associated markers within the group.

Here, we propose ABACUS, an Algorithm based on a
BivAriate Cumulative Statistic designed to analyze SNPs with
different MAF in the same group, independently on the protect-
ive or causative effect of the minor frequency allele.

Being based on a bivariate statistic, ABACUS, differently
from other methods, performs multiple tests on each SNP,
namely, equal to the number of SNPs in the SNP-set minus 1.
This provides multiple evidence of associations and allows
increasing the sensitivity with respect to other methods, such as
methods based on genotype similarity between individuals in the
same group and sequence kernel association tests, which instead
calculate a cumulative SNP-set statistic to associate SNP-sets to
phenotype. Moreover, the bivariate statistic used by ABACUS is
independent on the minor allele being protective or causative to
the disease, which makes ABACUS advantageous with respect to
burden tests. Relying just on a bivariate statistic, though, would
be type 1 error prone because of the number of performed tests.
Thus, to control type I error, ABACUS implements a Bonferroni
correction within each SNP-set together with a graph-theoretic
approach to identify groups of signiﬁcant SNPs.

Applied to a whole SNP dataset, ABACUS gives as output a
list of SNP-sets associated with the disease and, for each SNP-
set, the list of signiﬁcant SNPs.

ABACUS, like other methods, first requires the deﬁnition of
the SNP-sets, such as pathways, genes or genomic regions encod-
ing a priori information on the potential point effects of the
SNPs in each subset. We consider biological pathways as the
preferred deﬁnition of SNP-sets, as studying the cumulative vari-
ation of SNPs mapping on genes in the same pathway (interact-
ing genes) might ﬁll in part the missing heritability and guide
mechanistic studies helping uncovering the underlying disease

pathways (Barrett et al., 2009). Moreover, ABACUS is particu-
larly suited for pathway analysis, given its ability of simultan-
eously considering common and rare variants and different
direction of genotype effects.

In the following, we introduce ABACUS and assess its per-
formance in comparison with other methods on a number of
simulated datasets with known genotype—phenotype associ-
ations. To better appreciate the various facets of the method
and assess it also on real data, we illustrate ABACUS application
to the Wellcome Trust Case Control Study on type 1 and 2 dia-
betes (The Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium, 2007).
Results show how ABACUS is able to select a number of
SNPs and genes associated to diabetes, previously identiﬁed
either by the WTCCC consortium or in different TlD and
T2D GWAS, showing high sensitivity in detecting both
common and rare variants. Moreover, ABACUS identiﬁes new
biologically sound associations with diabetes, involving genes
associated with focal adhesion, platelet homeostasis, inositol
phosphate metabolism and glutathione metabolism for type 1
diabetes and tryptophan metabolism and lipid homeostasis for
type 2 diabetes.

2 METHODS

ABACUS exploits (i) a bivariate statistic, from now on called S2, calcu-
lated for each pair of SNPs within the SNP-set and (ii) an aggregated
score measuring the cumulative evidence of genetic—phenotypic associ-
ation of the SNPs annotated in the SNP-set. We ﬁrst introduce the stat-
istic S2 and then describe the ABACUS algorithm.

2.1 Computing the statistic 82 for a pair of SNPs

The genotype of a pair of SNPs i and j with alleles A,a and B,b, respect-
ively, has nine possible conﬁgurations: AABB, AABb, AAbb, AaBB,
AaBb, Aabb, aaBB, aaBb and aabb. The main building block of a
SNP pair-based analysis is thus a 2 X 9 contingency table, reporting the
frequencies of the number of genotypes in the case and control condi-
tions. In Table 1,ng are the frequencies of the number of cases (c = l) and
controls (c = 2) with genotype g (g = l, .., 9), i.e. the counts of the different
genotypes, divided by the number of samples in cases (N1) and controls
(N2), respectively. Thus, in the hypothesis of no association between the
pair of SNPs and the disease, f 1g % fgg (Vg: l, .., 9).

To test this hypothesis we exploit the concept of entropy (Shannon and
Weaver, 1963) and deﬁne a statistic S2, obtained by calculating, for each
genotype g, the relative weighted difference between the expected and the
observed entropy and summing it across the nine genotypes:

9
520,1) = Z  -Fg (1)

g=1

where: Fg is the proportion of the genotype g in the entire dataset, i.e.
Fg=(f1g-N1+ fZg-N2)/(N1+N2); Hg is the entropy of genotype g in the two
populations of cases and controls, computed as follows:

H = 43 - 10g2 (13) ﬂ - 10g2 (2)
F g F g F g F g
and H0 is the maximum entropy value, occurring when flg =f2g; i.e. in a
two classes problem H021. Genotypes with frequency 0 have Hg=0,
according to the entropy deﬁnition.

It has to be noted that a small difference, e.g. of one single subject, in
the number of cases with genotype g with respect to the controls implies
either a large or a negligible difference between fig and fgg depending on g
being rare or common, respectively. As a consequence, Hg will be much

lower than H0 in the ﬁrst case, thus contributing to increase S2(i, j j, and
almost equal to H0 in the second, thus giving almost no contribution to
SJ 1', j ). In general, this is a desirable property for Hg and, with a number
of subjects tending to the whole population, unbiased. However, in prac-
tice, the number of subjects is limited to the observed sample; thus rare
genotypes counts, limited to some units, can give an inaccurate estimate
of flg and fzg. In Equation 1, the relative difference between the observed
entropy Hg and its maximum value H0 is thus weighted by Fg, to correct
for possible biases introduced by genotypes with different frequencies.

The higher is S2, the higher is the conﬁdence that the two SNPs are
associated with the phenotype. The distribution of S2 under the null hy-
pothesis is obtained by repeatedly shufﬂing at random subject labels from
cases and controls and considering the distribution of all test statistics, i.e.
for all the SNP pairs (i,j).

A statistic S1 analogous to S2 can also be deﬁned for a single SNP i,
using a 2 X 3 contingency table. 51(1) represents the strength of the asso-
ciation between locus i and the phenotype; the difference A520, j) be-
tween S2(i, j) and max {51(1), 51(1)} can thus be interpreted as the fraction
of association between genotype and phenotype that is explained by the
joint effect of the two SNPs and that cannot be explained by a single gene
model. In other words, the value of the statistic S2(i, j) is enhanced by the
strength of association of the two single SNPs i and j and by their possible
epistatic interaction.

2.2 The ABACUS algorithm

Given a number of SNPs annotated in different SNP-sets, with possible
overlaps, ABACUS analyzes each SNP-set independently and, for each
SNP-set, selects the best subset of SNPs jointly associated with the pheno-
type. A SNP-set is considered signiﬁcantly associated with the phenotype
if it contains at least one SNP signiﬁcantly associated with it.

In details, given P SNPs belonging to a given SNP-set, ABACUS
selects signiﬁcantly associated SNPs based on the following steps
(Fig. 1 illustrates the algorithm with a graphical example).

(1) S2(i, j) is computed for each pair of SNPs (i, j) in the SNP-set

(2) For each SNP i, MS(i) = median {S2(i, j); j = l, .., P} is computed.

(3) The conﬁdence thresholds 6 for S2(i, j) are ﬁxed corresponding to a
signiﬁcance level at (corrected for the number of tests P-(P-Ij/2
using Bonferroni correction).

(4) An undirected graph G=(V, E) with vertices V={l,..,P} and
edges E = {(i, j); i, j 6 VI S2(i, j)>6} is deﬁned (Fig. lb).

(5) While the edge set E 75 Q:

- The SNP iw with the highest MS(i) is picked and, if there is at
least one edge (iw, j) e E, iw is considered associated with the
phenotype, with score MS(i) (Fig. 1c and e).

- All edges (iw, j) are removed from E (Fig. 1d and f).

The ﬁrst step of the algorithm is to compute S2(i, j) for each pair of SNPs
in the gene set. The higher the risk carried by 1' and/or j, the higher S2(i, j)
is expected to be. In general, if i is not associated with the phenotype,
S2(i, j) will be above the threshold 6 only if j is associated with the

phenotype or in case of a false positive. On the other hand, if i is asso-
ciated with the phenotype, S2(i, j) is likely to be above 6, with increased
value in case also j is associated, with single or joint effect on the pheno-
type. However, relying just on S2(i, j) to directly measure the association
between the pair (1', j) and the phenotype is type 1 error prone, both
because every SNP i is tested P-(P-Ij/2 times and because S2(i, j) is
likely to pass the threshold 6 even if just one of the two SNPs (i or j) is
associated with the phenotype. For these reasons, ABACUS implements
a Bonferroni correction within each SNP-set (0: is corrected for the
number of tests P- (P-I) /2) together with an iterative graph-pruning strat-
egy to identify groups of signiﬁcant SNPs. More in details, ABACUS
ranks the SNPs within a SNP-set based on the median value M S(i) of the
statistic S2(i, j) across the values observed for each pair (1', j), j = l, . . . , i—l,
i+ l, . . . ,P, rather than on the statistic itself. Because the median value
M S(i) of the statistic S2(i, j) is based on multiple evidences of association
of SNP i with the phenotype, it is a precise and sensitive statistic to select
signiﬁcant SNPs, as shown in Section 3. The median was preferred with
respect to the average or maximum value based on empirical observation
of the results on a number of different simulations (data not shown).

A null hypothesis can be derived also for MS(i) and, in principle, the
algorithm could stop at step 2. The rationale of steps 3—5 of the algorithm
is to further improve ABACUS precision limiting the loss of sensitivity,
by separating the confounding effect that strongly associated SNPs might
exert on the value MS(-) of non-associated SNPs.

For example, referring to Figure 1, if SNP l is associated with the
phenotype but 4 is not, 530, 4) will likely be above the threshold 6 and
MS(1) will likely be greater than M S(4), thus 1 will be analyzed before 4,
associated with the phenotype and removed from V (Fig. 1c and d).
When 4 will then be analyzed, the edge (1, 4) will have already been
removed from E and so all the edges (4, j), with MS(j)>MS(4)
(Fig. lf). Node 2, on the other hand, if analyzed after node 1 and 4,
has another incident edge after the removal of node 1, so it will be
selected.

ABACUS outputs the list of SNP-sets associated with the phenotype
and, for each SNP-set, the list of SNPs iw associated with the phonotype
and their score M S ( iw ), which can be used to rank the SNPs in the SNP-
set based on the strength of conﬁdence of association with the disease.
Because ABACUS implements a Bonferroni correction within each SNP-
set followed by the graph pruning strategy described earlier in the text,
the familywise error rate, i.e. the probability of making at least one false
SNP-phenotype association within the SNP-set, is controlled at a

probability equal or lower than the chosen signiﬁcance level 0: (see
Section 3). Thus, when different SNP-sets (let us suppose statistically
independent for the sake of simplicity) are analyzed, we expect a
number of false positive SNP-sets equal to at multiplied by the number
of SNP-sets that are truly non-associated with the phenotype (at max-
imum the number of analyzed SNP-sets). For example, if 0:: 0.05 and
100 SNP-sets are analyzed, we expect a number of false positive associ-
ations 55. ABACUS does not correct automatically by the number of
SNP-sets being analyzed but leaves the user to set the appropriate sig-
niﬁcance level 0:.

Steps 1—5 of the algorithm have computational complexity O(N-PZ),
O(Pz-logP), 0(1), O(PZ), O(P-logP), respectively; thus, analyzing one
SNP-set has computational complexity O(PZ-(N+logP), with N being
the number of subjects and P the number of SNPs.

ABACUS software is built as an R package with the most computa-
tionally demanding functions written in C; it is released under the GNU
general public license and is available at http://www.dei.unipd.it/
~dicamill/pagine/Software.html.

2.3 Type I error simulations

To investigate whether ABACUS attains to the desired type I error rate
at low signiﬁcance levels, e.g. 0:: 10‘6, it is necessary to conduct simu-
lations with hundreds of millions of simulated datasets. To do that while
diminishing the computational burden produced by simulating and ana-
lyzing such an amount of data, we generated 10 datasets of 4000 subjects
and 200000 SNPs and, for each dataset, we repeatedly (100 times)
sampled 10000 SNP-sets of 20 SNPs each, for a total of 107 simulated
SNP-sets. For each SNP, the MAF was randomly sampled from a uni-
form distribution ranging from 0.01 to 50%. Linkage disequilibrium
(LD) was simulated as described in Yuan et al. (2011) starting from an
initial population with high LD level, and then decaying to the desired
level through the processes of mating and recombination over gener-
ations. The case population under the null hypothesis was generated by
randomly picking 2000 subjects from the initial population of 4000.

2.4 Type 11 error simulations

To assess ABACUS power to detect true positives on a benchmark with
known genotype—phenotype associations under different conditions, such
as different number of SNPs associated with the disease, different MAF
and LD patterns across variants, we run a number of different simula-
tions. In particular, we generated 100 datasets of 4000 subjects and 20 000
SNPs and for each dataset, we sampled 1000 SNP-sets of 20 SNPs each,
for a total of 105 simulated SNP-sets. The LD was simulated as described
in the previous paragraph. Each SNP-set had a number of SNPs ran-
domly associated with the disease equal to 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 or 10. The
assignment was done having care to produce SNP-sets at low and high
MAF, in LD and not, to being able to assess methods performance under
different conditions.

After having assigned a phenotype label to each subject (e.g. half con-
trols and half cases), for each associated SNP allele frequencies were
distributed in cases according to 10 different models, including single-
locus and two-locus interactions, and to different odds ratio sampled in
the range 1.4—3. In particular, the model set included single-locus reces-
sive, dominant, additive and multiplicative models and six two-locus
models (Fig. 2), where the risk genotypes were all assumed to carry the
same risk. All the details on how we assigned allele frequencies accord-
ingly to the different models are given in the Supplementary Material.

2.5 Real data

As a proof of concept, we applied ABACUS on the WTCCC case-control
study on T1D and T2D (The Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium,
2007). The study examined ~2000 T1D cases, 2000 T2D cases and 3000

healthy controls. Each subject was genotyped on the Affymetrix
GeneChip 500K Mapping Array Set. We excluded a small number of
subjects according to the sample exclusion lists provided by the WTCCC.
In addition, we excluded a SNP if (i) it is on the SNP exclusion list
provided by the WTCCC and (ii) it has a poor cluster plot as deﬁned
by the WTCCC. The resulting dataset consists of 458376 SNPs, measured
for 1963 T1D cases, 1924 T2D cases and 2938 controls.

We mapped SNPs to genes using Affymetrix SNP Array 500K anno-
tation (http://www.affymetrix.com). SNPs annotated as 3’ and 5’ untran-
slatable region, coding sequences, intron, upstream and downstream were
all associated to the corresponding gene. Multiple SNP—gene associations
were allowed. We mapped genes to pathways using the Molecular
Signatures Database, mSigDB (Subramanian et al., 2005) and exploited
the curated SNP-sets derived from the REACTOME and KEGG path-
way databases (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000; Matthews at al., 2009). SNPs
that did not map to any pathway due to lack of annotation were mapped
on 22 pseudo-pathways corresponding to the different chromosomes.

2.6 Implementation of KBAT and SKAT-O

We compared ABACUS with KBAT and SKAT-O. We chose KBAT
because it has been reported to outperform other methods under different
disease—SNP association models and assumptions (Asimit and Zeggini,
2010; Mukhopadhyay et al., 2010) and SKAT-O because it optimally
combines a burden test with a kernel method and is one of the latest
proposed approaches by Lee et al. (2012).

We run SKAT-O in R using the package SKAT using the optimal
adjustment method, optimally compromising between a burden test and
the original SKAT algorithm (Wu et al., 2011). The SKAT function in R
allows setting two parameters a] and 612, to balance between the weights
of rare and more common variants in determining the SNP-set P-Value
(see Wu et al., 2011 for more details on these parameters). We run SKAT-
0 using both the default parameters setting, (11:1 and (12:25, which
weights more the rare variants, and an alternative parameters setting,
a] = 25 and a2 = I, which weights more the common variants, so to
explore both conditions. All the other parameters were set to their
default.

We implemented KBAT with the allele match kernel (AM) as ex-
plained in Mukhopadhyay et al. (2010), as this is the only kernel that
does not require knowledge of the risk allele of each SNP.

under the null hypothesis as explained in Section 2.3. Results are
shown in Table 2 and suggest that ABACUS is able to control the
type I error rate for SNP-set association in a slightly conservative
way, probably due to the implementation of the Bonferroni cor-
rection on the statistic 52 within each SNP-set, followed by the
graph pruning strategy. However, despite being slightly conserva-
tive, ABACUS maintains good power compared with the state-of-
the-art methods, as shown later in the text (Section 3.2).

Because ABACUS outputs both the SNP-sets associated to
the phenotype and the SNPs within the SNP-sets that contribu-
ted to the association, it is of interest to comment also on the
false-positive rate for single SNP association. In this regard, it
must be noted that ABACUS selects a SNP-set as associated to
the phenotype if at least one SNP in the SNP-set is associated
with the phenotype. As explained in Section 2.2, ABACUS con-
trols the familywise error rate of these associations at the chosen
signiﬁcance level 05 within each SNP-set; in other words, the
probability of committing at least one false-positive single SNP
association within each SNP-set is equal to 05. In a dataset with K
SNP-sets (let us suppose SNP-sets are statistically independent
for the sake of simplicity), the expected percentage of false-posi-
tive single SNP associations is thus equal to at multiplied by K,
divided by the total number of SNPs being analyzed. In our
simulations, this corresponds to 05 divided by 20. Consistently,
the empirical type I error rate observed for single SNP associ-
ation (Table 2, second row) takes a value close to the type I error
rate observed for SNP-set association divided by 20.

3.2 Comparison with KBAT and SKAT-O

One hundred simulated datasets were used to evaluate ABACUS
performance under different scenarios; namely, different MAF,
different numbers of associated SNPs and presence/absence of
LD within the SNP-set being analyzed, in comparison with
KBAT and SKAT-O. Each dataset consists of 1000 SNP-sets,
thus the false-positive rate was controlled at a signiﬁcance level at
equal to 0.005. Because KBAT and SKAT-O give their output in
terms of signiﬁcance of association of the SNP-set with the dis-
ease, to compare the different methods we used the recall,
deﬁned as the number of true positive SNP-sets divided by the
number of SNP-sets truly associated with the disease.

Figure 3 shows the results averaged across the 100 simulated
datasets, for low MAF, i.e. g 0.1 (left panels), and high MAF,
i.e. > 0.1 (right panels), under single- and multi-locus association
models, with associated SNPs in LD (upper panels) or not (lower
panels).

As for the other methods, ABACUS performance is robust to
different correlation among SNPs and improves with the number
of SNPs associated with the disease. A one side Wilcoxon signed

Fig. 3. Recall of different methods in detecting associated SNP-sets.
Average recall across 100 simulated datasets is shown at low (left
panels) and high (right panels) MAF, for SNPs in LD (upper panels)
and not in LD (lower panels), as a function of the number of SNPs
associated to the phenotype in the SNP-set. Colored star symbols indicate
statistically signiﬁcant differences between ABACUS and the other tests

ranks test corrected for multiple testing was used to test if
ABACUS signiﬁcantly outperforms other methods (a=0.05).
Results are shown in Figure 3, where colored star symbols indi-
cate statistically signiﬁcant differences between ABACUS and
the other tests. Because SKAT-O performance depends on the
parameters a1 and a2 and, as evident from Figure 3, there is not a
unique parameter setting working well for both rare and
common variants, we compared ABACUS with the best per-
forming setting of SKAT-O. Results indicate that ABACUS out-
performs all other methods in terms of ability to detect true
associations when few SNPs in the SNP-set are associated with
the phenotype. From Figure 3, it appears also evident that
ABACUS and KBAT are robust to different MAFs, with
ABACUS improving its performance at high MAFs.

The sensitivity of ABACUS in detecting rare variants even
when few SNPs are associated to the phenotype derives from
the use of a pairwise statistic 52 [Equations (1) and (2)]. In
fact, differently from other methods, which assign a score and
the corresponding P—Value to the SNP-set being analyzed,
ABACUS assigns a score to each pair of SNPs, which increases
with (i) the strength of association, (ii) the number of SNPs
associated to the disease and (iii) possible epistatic interactions
between SNPs. For example, let us consider a SNP-set of 10
SNPs. In the worst-case scenario, i.e. the most difﬁcult to
detect, just 1 SNP, say k, is associated to the phenotype within
the SNP-set. In this case, ABACUS computes 45:10*9/2
observed values of $2, of which 9 involve k. Even in case k cor-
responds to a rare variant, there is a reasonable chance that at
least 1 of the 9 values of S2{k,j) {j=1, . . ., 10,j7$k) passes the
threshold 6 (step 4 of the algorithm). In case 2 of 10 SNPs are
associated with the phenotype, l6 statistics 52 will involve one of

the SNPs associated with the phenotype and 1 statistic will in-
volve both, thus improving the chance that at least 1 statistic
passes the threshold 6. Moreover, if an epistatic interaction be-
tween the two associated SNPs exists, the statistic 52 between
them will further increase its value. Obviously, the power
of ABACUS keeps increasing with the number of associated
SNPs.

3.3 Application to T1D and T2D data

On T1D ABACUS identiﬁed 864 SNP associations, correspond-
ing to 153 genes and 267 SNP-sets; on T2D ABACUS identiﬁed
75 SNP associations, corresponding to 45 genes and 67 SNP-sets.
The MAF distribution of the SNPs identiﬁed by ABACUS as
associated with T1D and T2D covers the entire range 0.01—0.5
for both datasets (Fig. 4). Redundancy among SNP-sets is obvi-
ously observed, as a gene may function in multiple ways and thus
may appear multiple times in functional SNP-sets and SNPs
can be mapped to multiple genes. In Supplementary Material
‘PATH_tables’ non-redundant pathways associated with T1D
and T2D, i.e. pathways whose selected SNPs were not entirely
included in other pathways, are shown, together with the number
of selected SNPs and the corresponding genes. The complete lists
of associated SNPs and relative information (SNP ID, chromo-
some, cytoband, MAF, odds ratio and Affymetrix Annotation)
are available as Supplementary Materials (RES_TlD.txt and
RES_T 2D .txt).

Fig. 4. MAF distribution. MAF distribution of the SNPs identiﬁed by
ABACUS as associated with T1D (upper panel) and T2D (lower panel)

(6p22.2~6p21.32) received high ranking and had 758 SNPs
associated among the 864 selected. This was to be expected, as
HLA is one of the most recognized regions of interest for T1D
(Barrett et al., 2009) and HLA genes, playing a central role in the
human immune system, are known vulnerabilities to autoim-
mune diseases (Altmann and Trowsdale, 1989; Seliger, 2012).
Pathways from 1 to 9 and from 16 to 23 in Supplementary
Material PATH_tables refer to region 6p22.2 ~ 6p2l.32.

For both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, ABACUS was able to
detect SNPs/genes previously identiﬁed in the WTCCC study,
plus numerous additional SNPs/genes identiﬁed in different
T1D and T2D GWAS. In particular, 90% of the SNPs selected
by ABACUS were already associated or map in regions of the
genome previously associated with diabetes, metabolic traits,
LDL cholesterol, body mass index, fasting glucose-related traits
and glycated hemoglobin levels. These terms and the related SNP
associations were retrieved from the database HuGE Navigator
(W ei et al., 2011), searching for human genetic associations with
the term ‘diabetes’ http://hugenaVigator.net/HuGENaVigator/
gWAHitStartPage.do.

The 10% remaining SNPs map on genes and pathways that
are biologically sound. We brieﬂy list and comment these path-
ways in the following.

0 ‘Focal Adhesion’ is crucial for glucose-stimulated insulin
secretion (Rondas et al., 2011);

o ‘Platelet homeostasis’ is central in TlD, as platelet hyper-
activity and abnormal Ca(2+) homeostasis in diabetes mel-
litus are known (Li et al., 2001);

o ‘GPCR downstream signaling’ and, in particular, the gene
adenylyl cyclase 8 are central to glucagon-like peptide 1
signaling (Roger et al., 2011);

o ‘Apoptosis’ and ‘IL receptor SHC signaling’ might be of
great interest, as apoptosis is involved in T1D beta-cells
death and IL3RA is reported to be highly expressed in
beta cells in human (source: http://www.tldbase.org/);

o ‘Inositol phosphate metabolism’ and, in particular, pyro-
phosphates have been reported to inhibit Akt signaling
and thus insulin sensitivity (Chakraborty et al., 2010);

o ‘Glutathione metabolism’ has been reported to be altered in
adolescents with type 1 diabetes (Darmaun et al., 2008);

o ‘Huntigton disease’ has been controversely associated with
increased risk of T1D. Interestingly, the two genes we have
found in association with this pathway might be of interest,
as (i) the brain-derived neurotrophic factor has been shown
to exert an important role during implantation, placental
development and fetal growth and to have low expression
when fetal macrosomia is associated with maternal type 1
diabetes (Mayeur et al., 2010) and (ii) the nuclear respiratory
factor-1 (NRF-l) enhances the promoter activity of mito-
chondrial transcription factor A (a key regulator of mito-
chondrial DNA transcription and replication) at high
glucose levels. (Choi et al., 2004);

o ‘T ryptophan metabolism’ has been previously associated
with T2D, as tryptophan levels are low in type 2 diabetic
patients, and interestingly, also in gestational diabetic
women;

B.Di Camilla et al.

 

o ‘COPI-mediated transport’ might be of interest, as Coat
protein complex, or COPI complex is a regulator of lipid
homeostasis (Beller et al., 2008).

It is interesting to note that, for each of the pathways
listed above, which refer to regions not previously associated
with diabetes, only few SNPs (from 1 to 6) were associated to
the phenotype, possibly conﬁrming the sensitivity of ABACUS
when few markers in the SNP-set are associated with the
phenotype.

Overall, the aforementioned results provide proof of the prin-
ciple that ABACUS is a powerful tool to identify genotype—
phenotype associations within predeﬁned sets of functionally
related genes, thus conﬁrming the good sensitivity observed on
simulated data. Moreover, the application of ABACUS to bio-
logical pathways gives an implicit functional characterization of
trait-associated loci.

4 DISCUSSION

In this work, we have presented ABACUS, a method for iden-
tifying genotype—phenotype associations within predeﬁned sets
of SNPs in GWAS studies. ABACUS is based on the concept of
entropy, which allows measuring the variation in the information
content of genotype frequencies in cases versus controls. In par-
ticular, ABACUS selects the SNPs associated with the phenotype
within a SNP-set based on the median value MSW of the
bivariate statistic S2{ i, j ) [(Equations. (1) and (2)], this latter
measuring the joint effect of SNPs i and j on the phenotype.
It is important to note that the magnitude of MSW is SNP-set
dependent, its value being enhanced by the presence of
different SNPs associated to the phenotype in the SNP-set and
by possible epistatic associations between them. However,
MSW does not depend on the number of SNPs being
analyzed in the SNP-set; for example, for the WTCCC T1D
and T2D datasets, the Pearson correlation between MSW and
the number of SNPs in the SNP-set is —0.011 and 0.038,
respectively.

The rationale of the iterative graph pruning strategy per-
formed at steps 3—5 of the algorithm is to account for the con-
founding effect that strongly associated SNPs would have on the
statistic MSW of the other SNPs in the SNP-set. Steps 3—5 of
the algorithm result in a signiﬁcant improvement in terms of
precision in the detection of single SNP associations (number
of true positive SNPs divided by the number of selected SNPs),
which rises from an average value of 0.9 to 0.98 across the simu-
lated datasets (Wilcoxon paired test P<1 x 10‘”), without a
loss of recall.

On simulated data ABACUS has been shown to be robust to
different MAF and different correlation among SNPs; moreover,
it is more powerful than other methods in terms of ability to
detect true associations when few SNPs in the SNP-set are asso-
ciated with the phenotype. The robustness of ABACUS to dif-
ferent MAF and its sensitivity when few markers are associated
with the phenotype is conﬁrmed by the use of real data.

Because ABACUS is able to simultaneously consider common
and rare variants and different directions of genotype effect, we
consider pathways as the preferred deﬁnition of SNP-sets.
Focusing on multi-locus associations within a set of functionally

related genes might shed light on functional interactions and
might represent an advance in the direction of a systems-level
understanding of gene regulation. Besides observing a wide over-
lap with already known associations, analyzing ABACUS results
we found a number of biologically sound pathways, which might
help generating new hypothesis on diabetes mechanism and
etiology.

ABACUS, here described for a two-class problem, can be
easily extended to more classes. Moreover, with sufﬁcient num-
bers of cases and controls or focusing on a genomic region
known to be rich of possible interactions, ABACUS can be ex-
tended to analyze the joint effect of three or more variables.

In its present form, ABACUS does not output risky combin-
ations of alleles of the output SNPs. However, this can be easily
derived from ABACUS output using standard methods and
tools such as the logistic regression implemented in PLINK
(Purcell et al., 2007). One of the possible future directions is to
study the combinatorial problem of ﬁnding the best partition of
susceptibility SNPs in sets of one, two, . . ., k variables, each set
with a joint effect on the disease.

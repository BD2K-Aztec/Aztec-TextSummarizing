fast recognition of nucleosome positioning from next generation
sequencing and tiling arrays experiments. The software is integrated
with standard high-throughput genomics R packages and allows for
in situ visualization as well as to export results to common genome
browser formats.

1 INTRODUCTION

Eukaryotic chromatin is organized in nucleosomes, a structure
with approximately 147 basepairs (bp) of DNA wrapped around
an octamer of histones (Jiang and Pugh, 2009). Nucleosomes
affect the packaging and accessibility of DNA, thus playing a
crucial role in deﬁning its functionality (Jiang and Pugh, 2009).
The development of high—throughput techniques, such as tiling
arrays (TA) and next generation sequencing (NGS), coupled to
Micrococal Nuclease (MNase) digestions has enabled the study
of nucleosome positioning at the entire genome level for several
organisms including humans (Jiang and Pugh, 2009). Some clear
features emerged from these studies, such as the presence of well—
positioned nucleosomes and their depletion in regions surrounding
transcription start sites (TSS; Jiang and Pugh, 2009). However,
well—positioned (phased across different cells) nucleosomes coexist
with fuzzy (not—phased) ones outside the T88. This variability
makes nucleosome—positioning complex, requiring therefore the
development of algorithms to ﬁnd the ‘most—probable’ nucleosomal
conﬁguration. These approaches include, among others, Hidden
Markov Models (HMM) (Lee et al., 2007; Yassour et al., 2008; Yuan
et al., 2005), higher order Bayesian Networks (Chen et al., 2010)
or mixed methods (Di Gesu et al., 2009).These methods are very
powerful, but the intrinsic assumptions and the level of expertise of
the modeler can signiﬁcantly affect the results.

Here we present a new tool, nucleR, integrated in the open source,
multiplatform R/Bioconductor framework. The approach is based on
a fast, nonparametric detection of all nucleosome dyads and scoring
of the calls. A good performance is achieved by ﬁltering the noise
using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The user has full freedom to

export, select, merge or process suggested nucleosome calls in any
desired way, making the method completely ﬂexible. Algorithms
presented here are suitable for most TA and single or paired ended
NGS platforms.

2 METHODS

nucleR’s workﬂow is presented in Figure la. It relies the low—level processing
of the genomic data to specialized R/Bioconductor packages, allowing for a
wide variety of input formats.

The ﬁrst step is to convert the input data to obtain lbp resolution
hybridization ﬂuorescence ratios (TA) or short reads coverage (NGS). In the
latter case, some extra manipulations are applied to the reads, like correcting
the strand bias if working with single—ended sequencing or trimming the reads
for remarking the position of the dyad in paired—end cases. Additionally, to
reduce any potential bias due to the sequence preferences of MNase (Deniz
et al., in press), coverage maps obtained from nucleosomal DNA can be easily
corrected with those obtained in a parallel experiment for naked DNA. For
TA, the main problem is the existence of DNA segments not covered by a
probe, which in our procedure are inferred from neighboring probes.

The next step is ‘proﬁle cleaning’ based on Fourier analysis, which
simultaneously smoothes the signal and cleans the distortions in the coverage
peaks. Noise removal from coverage proﬁle is performed following signal
theory (Smith, 1999). Accordingly, the original complex signal is described
as a combination of simple periodic waves. By transforming the original
proﬁle into the Fourier Space using FFT, one can analyze the power spectrum
of single frequencies, i.e. the contribution of every frequency to the original
signal. High frequencies are usually echoes of lower frequencies and are
sources of noise. They can therefore be removed without affecting the ﬁnal
proﬁle (Smith, 1999). In our case, a small number of components are chosen
depending on the nature of the experiment (typically 1% for TA and 2%
for NGS; see Supplementary Material) and the rest are knockedout before
performing the inverse FFT; see Figure 1b for an example of raw and ﬁltered
proﬁles. The following step is the detection of nucleosome dyad, which is
done using a simple local maxima search and is largely facilitated by the
clarity of the ﬁltered proﬁle. Nucleosome calls are determined by selecting
the surrounding bases around the dyad position, and are scored based on the
height and sharpness of the peak; giving high score to large and sharp peaks
and penalizing fuzziness (Fig. lb).

Once nucleosome calling and scoring is done, the user can manipulate
the calls with standard R/Bioconductor tools to select, merge or perform
further study on nucleosome positioning in a way that fulﬁlls his/her speciﬁc
needs. Methods for visualizing the results and exporting the data in BED
and WIG formats are also provided. The nucleR package has been created
to manipulate large datasets and offers an efﬁcient usage of FFT (see
Supplementary Material) and support for parallel processing in multicore
machines.

3 RESULTS

In order to illustrate the performance of nucleR, we have analyzed
two datasets derived from MNase treatment of yeast chromatin: TA

from Nislow’s group (Lee et al., 2007) and an NGS experiment
performed in our group (Deniz et al., in press). A comparative
analysis has been performed using HMM results provided by
Lee et al. (2007) and the package ChIPSeqR, available from
R/Bioconductor repository. We selected the ﬁrst method as it is
widely used in the literature and the second one for being the
only package that enables a nucleosome positioning analysis in
R/Bioconductor.

The main difference between Lee’s HMM and our approach is
that the method presented here is able to detect multiple shifted
nucleosomes in a given single position, and not just providing the
‘most probable’ state for each position. This has a large impact on
the ﬁnal map, where we are able to identify a richer landscape
of nucleosome calls in TA experiments. Additionally, the HMM—
based approach is difﬁcult to apply to 1—bp resolution experiments,
such as NSG, due to the large amount of memory required for
backtracking. Apart from this scalability problem, the modeling of
background transition probabilities, a key element in HMM, requires
a very ﬁne and subjective tuning. This can overconstrain the results,
forcing, for example, preferred length linker DNA, strict periodic
positioning or inability to detect coverage peaks due to strange
chromatin structures, like centromers or tetrasomes. In the previous
work of Lee et al., 70 873 nucleosomes (40 096 well positioned and
30 777 fuzzy) were detected. nucleR applied to the same dataset
is able to detect a total of 151882 individual scored nucleosome
calls. Furthermore, our method displayed a larger ability to detect
nucleosome positions in synthetic data (77% hits for nucleR versus
67% for HMM) and also a higher correlation when rebuilding the
original read maps obtained from the TA experiment (P=O.63 for
nucleR versus P=0.38 for HMM) (see Supplementary Material).

ChIPSeqR (www.bioconductor.org) provides a similar approach
as the one presented here, but lacks support for TA data and a
method for noise removal. This generates problems in peak detection
since only global maxima above a settled threshold are detected
efﬁciently, missing many relevant sub—peaks (local maximums) and
leading to an underestimation of nucleosome density. In our NGS
data nucleR detects 100 335 nucleosome calls (repeated genomic
regions were not considered for this analysis), comprising all of
the local maximums above the default threshold on the smoothed
signal. With the same detection threshold, ChIPSeqR detects by
default 57 725 nucleosome binding sites and 2206180 if asking
for sub—peak detection, very far from the expected magnitude

of 104 — 105 calls, according to yeast genome size and putative
nucleosome length. A visual comparison of the mentioned methods
is available as Supplementary Material (see Supplementary Fig. S 1).
Again, a benchmark analysis showed that nucleR was able to recover
more nucleosome positions in synthetic data (95% for nucleR versus
81% for ChIPseqR) and to reproduce with higher deﬁnition the
experimental coverage map (P=O.29 for nucleR versus P=0.03
for ChIPSeqR) (see Supplementary Material for details).

nucleR has a computational complexity between 0(N) and 0( N
log N). The package is accessible free of cost under LGPL—3 license
scheme from our website (http://mmb.pcb.ub.es/nucleR) and the
Instituto Nacional de Bioinformatica site (http://www.inab.org) It
should also be available on Bioconductor upon publication.

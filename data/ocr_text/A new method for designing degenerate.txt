ABSTRACT

Motivation: We developed a technique and a tool for degenerate
primer design based on multiple local alignments employing the
MEME algorithm supported with electronic PCR. The objective is
to find adequate primers starting from sequences with poor global
similarity. We show an example of its application in our laboratory
to find sequences in Brachiaria with similarity to ESTs related to
apomixis.

1 INTRODUCTION

Classical methods for degenerate primer design include software
applications such as CODEHOP (Rose et al., 1998) or PrimaClade
(Gadberry et al., 2005). These methods usually rely on the
identiﬁcation of clear blocks of conserved regions in multiple
global alignments. Therefore, alignment quality should be very
high. However, in many cases, primer design using multiple
global alignments is unsuccessful (Kwok et al., 1994) due to poor
conservation among the sequences under study. To overcome this
problem, we propose a new method to design primers, which
could be used for sequences with poor global similarity or without
well—conserved blocks in multiple global alignments. Instead,
the technique is based on multiple local alignments, using the
Multiple Expectation — Maximization for Motif Elicitation (MEME)
algorithm (Bailey et al., 2006), in order to search for conserved
regions long enough to serve as primers. The results of MEME
are then veriﬁed by electronic PCR (e—PCR) (Schuler, 1997) and
standard primer design programs.

We employed this technique to design degenerate primers for
sequences related to apomixis in the tropical forage grass Brachiaria.
We demonstrate that the ampliﬁcation of sequences with similarity to
genes reported in other species (possibly homologues) is possible,
even when the species in question is poorly characterized at the
molecular level.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

Primer design: A database of expressed sequences of Brachiaria—
related species was constructed using EST sequences from
plants in the families Alliaceae and Poaceae. Sequences
were retrieved from the TIGR Gene Indices database
(http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/tgi/) and TIGR Plant Transcript
Assemblies database (http://plantta.tigr.org, both consulted on
September 2007). Input sequences can be full—length cDNAs if
available or genomic sequences.

Twenty—seven sequences related to apomixis (Albertini et al.,
2004; Chen et al., 2005; Guerin et al., 2000; Gustine et al.,
1993; Pessino et al., 2001; Rodrigues et al., 2003; Vielle—Calzada
et al., 1996) (accession numbers AB000809, AF2425 39, AF475 105,
AJ786393,AJ810708,AJ810709,AJ810710,AJ841698,AY375366,
D37938, D37939, D37940, EF517497, EF517498, EF530198,
EF530199, M32653, M38357, U40219, U65082, U65383, U65384,
U65385, U65386, U65387, U65388, U65389) (Supplementary
Table 1) were employed as BLAST queries against the constructed
database, in order to obtain groups of sequences similar to the query.
The maximum accepted E —value in this test was 10‘6 and sequences
showing values over this threshold were discarded. We could obtain
more than two similar sequences for only 24 accession numbers,
and the remaining three (u65386, u65387 and M32653) were not
further analyzed.

Each original query and its group of related sequences were
aligned using T—COFFEE (http://tcoffee.vital—it.ch/cgi—bin/Tcoffee/
tcoffee_cgi/index.cgi?stage 1 =1 &daction=TCOFFEE: :Regular&
referer0=embnet) to determine global similarity. A lack of block
conservation was observed in all cases in these multiple global
alignments. Alignments were then performed with MEME
(http://meme.sdsc.edu/meme4_1/cgi—bin/meme.cgi) (Bailey et al.,
2006). The conditions of these last alignments included a minimum
motif length of 18 nt and a maximum of 25, and minsites = 2/3 of
the total number of sequences. Sequences with low similarity in
the MEME alignment and redundant sequences were discarded,
and a second MEME alignment was performed with the remaining
ones. In this case, more than half of the results exhibited a common
arrangement of motifs between the analyzed sequences, indicating
a global similarity that could not be well resolved with common
algorithms of multiple global alignments (Fig. 1 and Supplementary
Figs 1 and 2). This proved the existence of well—conserved regions

and similarity in the analyzed sequences, which could be useful for
primer design.

The ﬁrst 20 motifs obtained in each MEME run were extracted,
ordered according to the score given in the program, and paired in
all possible ways, in order to test each motif pair as a primer pair.
Every pair was tested in the group of its corresponding sequences
(the sequences used in the second MEME alignment) in the e—PCR
program (Schuler, 1997) under the condition that amplicon size must
be at least 200 bp in length. In many cases, the ﬁrst eleven motifs
had an acceptable level of degeneracy, and they were preferred to
make subsequent analyses.

The presence of the original query and the number of
degenerations were veriﬁed in MEME alignments of both motifs
of the pair, beginning with the pair with the highest sum of
motif scores (referred to as the highest score). If the query was
absent in the alignments and/or the number of degenerations
was greater than 12 in the primer pair, it was discarded and
the test continued with the next one. When one motif pair was
acceptable, it was tested in NetPrimer (http://www.premierbiosoft
.com/netprimer/netprlaunch/netprlaunch.html), in order to verify
annealing temperatures, secondary structure formation and primer
dimers. If the pair had a Tm that was too high, a Tm difference
> 5°C, or formed dimers or secondary structures with a AG less than
—8 KJ/mol, bases of one or both motifs were eliminated, until the
conditions were acceptable. If these adjustments could not improve
them, the pair was discarded and the test continued with the next pair.
Finally, once one pair was accepted, the degenerations were put in
their positions and it was synthesized as a degenerate primer pair. If
neither motif pair had the required conditions, the analysis for this
particular sequence stopped. Taking into account these exclusion
criteria, we were able to design primers for only 22 out of the
24 original queries.

We developed a software application for the primer design that
can be accessed at http://bioinf—mac.uniandes.edu.co/design.

Primer assays: PCR reactions with obtained primers were
standardized and assayed on CDNA from pistils (reproductive
tissue) and a bulk of leafs, stems and roots (vegetative tissue)
(Supplementary Fig. 3). Amplicons could be obtained in 15 out

of the 22 designed primer pairs. With the exception of sequences
aj786393, ef530198 and pcu402019, no PCR gave a multiple
band product. Sequence analysis of the products showed a good
correspondence with the original query in 12 out of the 15 cases.
The three false positive results and the cases where an amplicon
could not be obtained were associated to low similarity patterns in
MEME analysis; i.e. cases where no clear common arrangement of
motifs could be seen. This indicates that primer design should be
avoided in those cases where MEME does not show a good level
of conservation in terms of motif organization. These results are
considered very positive, because many times our input sequences
consist on few similar sequences.

3 CONCLUSION

In conclusion, we were able to develop a new bioinformatics method
and a corresponding tool to amplify genes associated with a very
poorly characterized phenomenon at the molecular level such as
apomixis. This method could help to obtain ampliﬁcations in other
poorly understood biological events, in which there are few related
sequences. In general terms, the technique can be used for sequences
that have very few known homologues, or to conﬁrm them, and to
design degenerate primers when the classical methods do not work.
The method, however, needs to be improved, for instance trying to
automatize the time—consuming steps and avoiding sequences with
low similarity patterns. Our results will allow the analysis of all those
proposed candidate genes for apomixis in a unique plant species.

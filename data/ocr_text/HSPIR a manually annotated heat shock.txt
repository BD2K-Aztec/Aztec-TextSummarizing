ABSTRACT

Summary: Heat shock protein information resource (HSPIR) is a con-
certed database of six major heat shock proteins (HSPs), namely,
Hsp70, Hsp40, Hsp60, Hsp90, Hsp100 and small HSP. The HSPs
are essential for the survival of all living organisms, as they protect
the conformations of proteins on exposure to various stress condi-
tions. They are a highly conserved group of proteins involved in
diverse physiological functions, including de novo folding, disaggrega-
tion and protein trafficking. Moreover, their critical role in the control of
disease progression made them a prime target of research. Presently,
limited information is available on HSPs in reference to their identifica-
tion and structural classification across genera. To that extent, HSPIR
provides manually curated information on sequence, structure, classi-
fication, ontology, domain organization, localization and possible bio-
logical functions extracted from UniProt, GenBank, Protein Data Bank
and the literature. The database offers interactive search with incorpo-
rated tools, which enhances the analysis. HSPIR is a reliable resource
for researchers exploring structure, function and evolution of HSPs.

1 INTRODUCTION

Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are a specialized group of proteins
robustly synthesized in all living organisms in response to various
conditions of stress, including elevated temperatures. HSPs are
critical for cell survival both constitutively and in times of stress
to ensure proper folding of non-native states of proteins (Bukau
et al., 2006; Parsell and Lindquist, 1993). Based on their nature of
functions and molecular mass, HSPs are classiﬁed broadly into
six major families, namely, Hsp70, Hsp40 (J-proteins), Hsp60
(chaperonins), Hsp90, Hsp100 (Clp proteins) and small HSPs.
(Lund 2001; Kampinga and Craig, 2010)

They function cooperatively by forming an intricate molecular
network, thereby maintaining the overall cellular protein homeo-
stasis (Lund, 2001). Their diversiﬁed nature and vast repertoire
of functions have generated a signiﬁcant interest to deduce an

intricate cellular chaperone network and functional crosstalk
among major families of HSPs.

Presently, ‘canB’ (Hill et al., 2004) database exists but con-
tains data only for Hsp60 family. Heat shock protein informa-
tion resource (HSPIR) provides a comprehensive collection of
information on six major HSP families across various genomes,
with detailed subclassiﬁcation based on their domain, structural
organization and localization. HSPIR also includes sequences
that are not yet annotated in UniProt. Additionally, HSPIR
offers various tools like BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997) for hom-
ology search, CLUSTALW (Larkin et al., 2007) for multiple
sequence alignment, Archaeopteryx (Han and Zmasek, 2009)
for phylogenetic tree visualization and manipulation and Jmol
(http://www.jmol.org/) structural viewer. The database currently
holds ~10 000 hand-curated entries from six kingdoms, covering
all the major model organisms and 295 3D structures.

2 DATA RETRIEVAL AND CURATION

We did an extensive literature survey to retrieve names, nomen-
clature, functions and structural information of HSPs using the
PubMed query system. With this knowledge, we created a com-
prehensive list of standard names and alternative names for each
HSP family. Structures and their corresponding sequences of
HSPs were retrieved from Protein Data Bank (PDB). The afore-
mentioned generated data were used for keyword and sequence
search against SwissProt (Boeckmann et al., 2003). These data
sets were then ﬁltered to include sequences that belong to protein
existence level 1 or 2 (evidence at protein level or evidence at the
transcript level, respectively). Sequences with domains that are
partial in length or missing any functional motifs were discarded.
Using these initial data sets as seed sequences (refer Supplemen-
tary Table S1), position-speciﬁc scoring matrix (PSSM) was cre-
ated for each family of HSP. Organism-speciﬁc PSI-BLAST was
performed using the PSSM with an e-value cut-off of 0.0001
against the NCBI non-redundant protein sequence database
(Altschul et al., 1997; Benson et al., 2011) to populate HSPIR.
Extreme care was taken to remove the duplicated and highly
truncated sequences from the data sets. These collated data sets
were then manually curated by taking single sequence at a time
and using different database search methods to annotate struc-
tural and functional information (Supplementary Figure S1).
We used a wider collection of the protein family databases
such as NCBI CDD (Marchler-Bauer et al., 2011), Pfam (Finn
et al., 2010), InterPro (Hunter et al., 2009) and SMART (Letunic

et al., 2009) to identify domain architecture and associated func-
tional motifs of HSPs. The secondary structural assignments
were done using PSIPRED Version 3.2 (McGufﬁn et al.,
2000), and subcellular localization and signal peptide regions
were predicted using TargetP (Emanuelsson et al., 2007;
Nielsen et al., 1997), WolfPsort (Horton et al., 2007) and Psort
(Nakai and Horton, 1999).

Taxon information of each organism was obtained from
NCBI Taxonomy database (Benson et al., 2011). Gene ontolo-
gies were inferred from UniProtKB (The UniProt Consortium,
2012). Experimentally determined 3D structures were retrieved
from the PDB (Berman et al., 2000). Available literature refer-
ences were generated from PubMed; the cross-references and
identiﬁers of external databases were also imported.

3 DATABASE IMPLEMENTATION

HSPIR is built using open source MySQL database and inter-
faced with server-side PHP scripts. The Web interface uses dy-
namically generated HTML pages supported by JavaScript and
CSS to provide an interactive environment for public access.
Perl-CGI scripts have been used to compile the BLAST,
CLUSTALW and hidden Markov model search features
(Eddy, 1998).

4 DATABASE INTERFACE AND VISUALIZATION

HSPIR is a user-friendly Web resource in which the homepage
provides a model of functional networks of six major HSP
families (Supplementary Figure S2). Each of them is mapped
with a dedicated Web page explaining their structure, domain
organization, classiﬁcation and physiological signiﬁcance with
diagrammatic illustrations.

4.1 Search features

HSPIR incorporates four different search features. Basic key-
word search allows ﬁnding of HSPs based on their names (in-
cludes gene names, standardized and synonymous names),
families, identiﬁers (HSPIR and external) and classiﬁcations.
The advanced search is our key feature, which narrows the
search criteria for speciﬁc and better results. Users are able to
reﬁne their search using the combined search method with logical
and relational operators dynamically organized on the page. The
data retrieval can be further streamlined using other specialized
query tools such as genome-wide search and domain-based
search. These tools can query database independently to retrieve
records based on a speciﬁc genome, speciﬁed combination of
domains.

4.2 Results

Results of all the search tools are presented in the form of a
paginated table. Protein records can be viewed by clicking the
accession ID, or have been added to the HSPIR cart for down-
loading and further analysis. Individual protein records comprise
names and lineage, classiﬁcation, sequence information, domains
and motifs, structures, ontologies, references, cross-references,
external links to different databases and, ﬁnally, the protein
record information.

4.3 Sequence comparison

BLAST stand-alone package implemented in the database allows
the users to search for a query protein against HSPIR database
and identify similar HSP sequences. Comparing of multiple se-
quences can be done using CLUSTALW, and the tree is visua-
lized using Archaeopteryx.

4.4 HSP identiﬁcation

The HSP identiﬁcation tool allows the user to identify and clas-
sify unknown sequences into a particular HSP family. The
user-provided sequence is scanned against predeﬁned HSP
libraries of proﬁles created from a set of validated seed sequences
(Supplementary Table S1).

5 SUMMARY AND FUTURE PRESPECTIVES

The scope of HSPIR is to provide a dedicated resource for HSPs
with functional annotations. The interactive search features with
collated information provided in the database will allow re-
searchers to perform comparative analysis and explore additional
physiological functions of HSPs in different species, which was
not well appreciated previously. Moreover, the data in the
HSPIR will be checked for updates weekly, using PHP scripts
and parsers scheduled by crontab. These updated records will be
reviewed and uploaded by the curation team. The future perspec-
tive is to incorporate HSP information for additional genomes,
with a special emphasis on pathogenic species. We will include
other specialized chaperones like disulﬁde isomerases, accessory
proteins such as nucleotide exchange factors, prefoldins and
HSP90 co-chaperones.

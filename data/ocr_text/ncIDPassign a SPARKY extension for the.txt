ABSTRACT

Summary: We describe here the ncIDP-assign extension for the
popular NMR assignment program SPARKY, which aids in the
sequence-specific resonance assignment of intrinsically disordered
proteins (lDPs). The assignment plugin greatly facilitates the effective
matching of a set of connected resonances to the correct position in
the sequence by making use of IDP random coil chemical shifts.
Availability: The ncIDP-assign extension is available at

1 INTRODUCTION

The structural characterization of intrinsically disordered proteins
(IDPs) is a rapidly growing ﬁeld in structural molecular biology.
Over the past decade NMR spectroscopy has proven to be singular
in its capacity to provide detailed structural characterization of these
dynamic entities (Eliezer, 2009). Although diverse experimental
approaches have been developed (Bermel et al., 2006; Mantylahti
et al., 2010; O’Hare et al., 2009), the sequential resonance
assignment of >10 kDa natively unfolded polypeptides is still not a
trivial task.

Here, we describe an enhanced version of the SPARKY (Goddard
and Kneller, 2006) sequence repositioning extension, which assist
in matching, connecting and assigning consecutive residues, and is
speciﬁcally designed for intrinsically disordered proteins: ncIDP-
assign (neighbor—corrected IDP chemical shift assignment). This
tool makes use of a novel random—coil chemical shift library,
enabling the accurate prediction of the chemical shifts of a queried
protein on a basis of tripeptides (Tamiola et al., 2010). Predicted
sequence—speciﬁc chemical shifts are used as a template for re—
assignment and validation of existing resonance assignments. The
newly designed ncIDP-assign greatly accelerates the process of
sequential resonance assignment of large intrinsically disordered
proteins by drastically reducing the level of assignment ambiguities.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

The process of assignment validation and repositioning begins with
the computation of the sequence—speciﬁc random—coil chemical

shifts for the intrinsically disordered protein under study, based on its
primary sequence.The random—coil chemical shift for a nucleus n E
{1H021HN,13CO‘,13C’3,13C0,15N}of amino acid residue a, within a
tripeptide x — a — y, can be expressed as,

6;,ed(x,a,y)=Ail(x)+6¥c(a)+Aitl(y) (1)

where 8% (a) is the ‘random—coil’ chemical shift in the reference
peptide Gly—a—Gly , A’:1(x) and A’jrl(y), are the neighbor
corrections due to the preceding and the sequential residue,
respectively. Subsequently, a collection of experimentally assigned
resonances in a range k . . . k—l—l speciﬁed by the user is retrieved and
compared against the predicted chemical shifts from Equation (1).
All plausible locations for the fragment along the sequence of a
protein are considered. Each investigated position is characterized

chemical shifts and the standard deviations of expected chemical
shieldings for k . . . k—l—l sequence combination, respectively. A score
of 1.0 implies that at the queried sequence position, the experimental
shifts are one standard deviation from the computed values, on
average. Hence, the ‘best—ﬁt’ solutions are characterized by the
lowest S values.

3 RESULTS AND CONCLUSION

To assess the performance of ncIDP-assign we used the
NMR chemical shift assignments for the 140—residue intrinsically
disordered, cytoplasmic domain of human neuroligin—3 (hNLG3cyt)
(Paz et al., 2008). The robustness of the assignment procedure was
established using the data obtained in 1H—15N HSQC (Bodenhausen
and Ruben, 1980), COCAHA (Dijkstra et al., 1994) and HNCACB
(Wittekind and Mueller, 1993) experiments, providing access to
backbone and 1303 chemical shifts. Table 1 displays the level of
completeness of the resonance assignment for hNLG3cyt, and the
accuracy of the chemical shift back computation modules in the
standard and ncIDP versions of the SPARKY sequence repositioning
plugins. As borne out by Table 1, ncIDP-assign offers an almost two—
fold improvement in the estimation of chemical shifts for hNLG3cyt.
The superior predictive power of ncIDP-assign translates into
detection sensitivity of chemical shift deviations from the sequence—
speciﬁc ‘random—coil’ values due to resonance misassignment.

Fig. 1. Comparative analysis of accuracy of standard and ncIDP SPARKY
sequence repositioning extensions, using resonance assignments in: 1H—15N
HSQC, COCAHA and HNCACB experiments, for the intrinsically
disordered protein hNLG3cyt. (A) Normalized frequency of correct
repositioning solutions as a function of fragment length in: standard (blue)
and ncIDP—enhanced (green) repositioning, respectively. (B) Sensitivity
as a function of sequence length for: standard (blue) and ncIDP (green)
repositioning extensions.

This point is demonstrated by Fig. 1 where the repositioning
performance of the two methods is compared against known
resonance assignments for hNLG3cyt. ncIDP-assign identiﬁes
correct solutions much more readily, and already at the level
of dipeptides for the considered experiments (Fig. 1A). Further
expansion of the length of a query fragment to tripeptide rapidly
shifts the probability of assigning the correct solution. Consequently,
the information content contained within a combination of resonance
frequencies in short peptides (length 2 2) is unique enough to make
the correct position guess in most cases.

Another critical parameter in the assignment process is the relative
separation of the ‘best—ﬁt’ score Sbest with respect to the second—best
scoring suggestion Ssecondbesb expressed here as the sensitivity
Ssecond_best/Sbest (Fig. 1B). Values for the sensitivity close to
1.0 indicate ambiguity. Given a sequentially assigned dipeptide,
ncIDP-assign generates a list of solutions in which the ‘best—ﬁt’
scenario scores appreciably better than the next considered option.
Already signiﬁcant improvements are observed in the analysis of 1H—
15N HSQC resonance lists, clearly demonstrating that information
content of 1H—15N resonance pairs in sequentially connected
dipeptides can be effectively used in the assignment process of an
intrinsically disordered protein.

In conclusion, we have shown here that ncIDP-assign is an
effective tool to aid the sequential NMR resonance assignment of
(intrinsically) disordered proteins.

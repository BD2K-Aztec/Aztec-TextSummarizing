ABSTRACT

Motivation: The identification of catalytic residues is a key
step in understanding the function of enzymes. While a variety
of computational methods have been developed for this task,
accuracies have remained fairly low. The best existing method
exploits information from sequence and structure to achieve a
precision (the fraction of predicted catalytic residues that are
catalytic) of 18.5% at a corresponding recall (the fraction of
catalytic residues identified) of 57% on a standard benchmark. Here
we present a new method, DISCERN, which provides a significant
improvement over the state-of-the-art through the use of statistical
techniques to derive a model with a small set of features that are
jointly predictive of enzyme active sites.

Results: In cross-validation experiments on two benchmark
datasets from the Catalytic Site Atlas and CATRES resources
containing a total of 437 manually curated enzymes spanning
487 SCOP families, DISCERN increases catalytic site recall between
12% and 20% over methods that combine information from both
sequence and structure, and by 250% over methods that make use
of sequence conservation signal only. Controlled experiments show
that DISCERN’S improvement in catalytic residue prediction is derived
from the combination of three ingredients: the use of the INTREPID
phylogenomic method to extract conservation information; the use of
3D structure data, including features computed for residues that are
proximal in the structure; and a statistical regularization procedure to
prevent overfitting.

1 INTRODUCTION

The prediction of protein function from limited data is an important
challenge in the post—genomic era. Bioinformatics methods that
provide clues to the roles of individual residues in a protein are used
by biologists to prioritize site—directed mutagenesis experiments
and to provide a more speciﬁc prediction of function than simple
homology—based approaches (George et al., 2005). In this work,

we focus on the task of predicting catalytic residues in enzymes
using information from sequence and structure.

The earliest methods for catalytic residue prediction relied on
detecting conservation patterns across a family (Casari et al., 1995;
Landau et al., 2005; Lichtarge et al., 1996), followed by increasingly
powerful sequence—based scoring functions (Aloy et al., 2001;
Mayrose et al., 2004; Mihalek et al., 2004; Sankararaman and
Sj61ander, 2008). Methods relying exclusively on information from
solved 3D structures have been developed, analyzing features such
as the geometric arrangements of residues (Fetrow and Skolnick,
1998), surface geometry (Peters et al., 1996), electrostatics (Bate and
Warwicker, 2004), energetics (Elcock, 2001; Laurie and Jackson,
2005) and chemical properties (Ondrechen et al., 2001; Tong et al.,
2008). Other methods combine features derived from sequence and
structure (Aloy et al., 2001; Alterovitz et al., 2009; Gutteridge et al.,
2003; Innis et al., 2004; Landgraf et al., 2001 ; Ota et al., 2003; Pazos
and Sternberg, 2004; Petrova and Wu, 2006; Youn et al., 2007), or
use sequence data in combination with predicted structure features
to improve accuracy (Fischer et al., 2008).

In this article, we present a new method for predicting catalytic
residues, which we have named DISCERN. DISCERN is a statistical
predictor that achieves a signiﬁcant improvement in performance
over other catalytic residue prediction methods. Previously, the best
recall (the fraction of true catalytic residues that are predicted to
be catalytic) reported on homology—reduced datasets is 57% at a
precision (the fraction of predicted catalytic residues that are indeed
catalytic) of 18.5% (Youn et al., 2007). In comparison, at the same
precision, DISCERN yields a recall of at least 69%, representing an
improvement of 312% in recall over the best current methods for
this task.

1.1 The DISCERN methodology for catalytic residue
prediction

The statistical model underlying DISCERN is a binary logistic
regression model (Hosmer and Lemeshow, 2000), which predicts
catalytic residues based on a set of sequence and structure
features describing a site. Features considered by DISCERN include
evolutionary measures of positional conservation, relative and
absolute solvent accessibility, presence in a cleft or pocket,
secondary structure, polarity, charge and so on. Logistic regression
takes a weighted linear combination of these features, where
the weights are learned from a training set of experimentally

Fig. 1. Overview of the system for catalytic residue prediction: (0) Features are derived from the sequence and 3D structure of an enzyme and from homologs
identiﬁed using PSI—BLAST. Many features are considered, including the identity of the amino acid, evolutionary conservation scores and presence in a
pocket or cleft. (1) Annotated dataset (training data): a dataset of enzymes with labeled catalytic and non—catalytic residues, along with features derived for
each residue. (2) We estimate the parameters of the logistic regression model from the training dataset (this is known as a supervised learning procedure)
using Ll—regularized maximum likelihood. The parameters refer to the weights associated with the features. The Ll—regularization tends to set many of the
parameters to zero, resulting in a sparse model. (3) The output of the training phase is a predictor. (4) To predict catalytic residues for a new enzyme, features
are derived for the enzyme as in step 1 and the features are used by the logistic regression to classify each residue. (5) The predictor derived in step 3 is used

to predict the probability that each residue is catalytic (step 6).

characterized enzymes, and then transforms the result to a
probability scale (see Fig. 1 for an overview).

While statistical models making use of information from sequence
and structure have been developed for catalytic residue prediction,
and individual aspects of the DISCERN model have been used by other
methods (Alterovitz et al., 2009; Gutteridge et al., 2003; Petrova
and Wu, 2006; Youn et al., 2007), DISCERN brings together three
ideas that jointly differentiate it from existing predictors and which
provide a dramatic improvement in prediction accuracy.

The ﬁrst distinguishing aspect of the DISCERN model is
the use of the INTREPID phylogenomic conservation score
(Sankararaman and delander, 2008). INTREPID uses Jensen—
Shannon (J S) divergence and phylogenetic tree traversal to estimate
the evolutionary conservation for each residue in a protein,
computing this score at every node encountered on a path from the
root of the tree to the leaf corresponding to the sequence of interest.
The ﬁnal score for each residue is the maximum J S divergence
computed on that path. This procedure enables INTREPID to extract
a conservation signal that may only appear at deeply nested subtrees
in the superfamily phylogeny, and allows it to be applied to highly
divergent datasets.

The second critical aspect of DISCERN is its use of structure
information, in particular, the inclusion of features for structurally
proximal residues in the feature vector describing a site. For instance,
it is known that enzyme active sites are structurally conserved
across distant homologs (Baker and Sali, 2001). This structural
conservation is reﬂected by correspondingly high levels of sequence
conservation in the vicinity of catalytic residues. Catalytic residues
have other structural features, e. g. they are typically polar or charged,
found in clefts or pockets, and at least somewhat solvent accessible
(Bartlett et al., 2002). The DISCERN predictor represents these
fundamental characteristics of active sites by including features for
the individual site whose catalycity is being predicted and also for
its structural neighbors.

The inclusion of many features in the statistical model motivates
the third critical aspect of DISCERN —the use of an L1 —regularization
procedure to avoid model overﬁtting. Overﬁtting can result when
a statistical model has many more parameters than the number
of training data points, so that it can ﬁt the training data
very precisely but fail to generalize to new data (Hastie et al.,
2001). Our results show that regularization is essential for the
considerable improvement in DISCERN prediction accuracy, and
that performance degrades signiﬁcantly without regularization (see
Supplementary Materials for additional discussion of the overﬁtting
problem). L1 —regularization addresses the problem of overﬁtting by
maximizing the likelihood of the logistic regression model under a
constraint on the sum of the absolute values of the model parameters;
such a constrained estimation procedure yields a sparse model in
which many parameters are set to zero and also derives appropriate
weights for features that are highly correlated (or uninformative)
(Tibshirani, 1996). L1 —regularization has been shown to yield models
that are better predictors than those based on unregularized estimates
(Greenshtein and Ritov, 2004; Hastie et al., 2001; Tibshirani,
1996; van de Geer, 2008; Zhao and Yu, 2006), and has been
used in a number of bioinformatics applications including gene
expression microarray analysis (Segal et al., 2003; Shevade and
Keerthi, 2003) and genome—wide association studies (Hoggart et al.,
2008).

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

In this section, we describe the logistic regression model and the estimation
procedure underlying DISCERN. See Supplementary Materials for additional
details.

2.1 Ll-regularized logistic regression

Given an enzyme i with n,- amino acid residues, we denote by Jr?) the
d—dimensional vector of residue—speciﬁc features at site j, j=1,...,n,-, by

Active site prediction

 

X (i) the d X m matrix of all such features, and by z?) 6 {+1, —1} the catalytic
label of residue j (whether the residue is catalytic or not). We denote the
set of structural neighborhood features by a (W xnl- matrix Y (0. Here, N
refers to the number of structural neighbors of each residue. We model the
conditional distribution of the random variable zj’) 6 {+1, —1} by a logistic
regression model

Pr(Zj(i):1|X(i)7Y(i)7b7W17W2)
_ 1
1 +exp (— (b+w1/xJ(-i) +w2/yJ(-i)>>
The model has parameters (b,w1,wz); b is the intercept term which controls
the trade—off between false positives and false negatives, W1 is the set of
weights corresponding to the residue features, while W2 is the set of weights
for the structural neighbor features. Given a training set of enzymes and their
catalytic residue annotations, we estimate the parameters (b,w1,wz) using a
regularized maximum likelihood approach in which we maximize the sum
of the likelihood and an L1 penalty term:
m n,-
(i) (i) (i) _
mgxzzlogPrtz, IX 1 1w) leni,
i=1 j=1

 

where w=(w1,wz) and ||w||1=Zk|wk| is the L1 norm. The non—negative
regularization parameter A controls the sparsity of the estimate of w; larger
values of )t lead to estimates with increasing numbers of zero components.
We chose the value of )t by a cross—validation procedure. The optimization
problem is solved using an interior point method as implemented in Koh
et al. (2007).

2.2 Features for catalytic residue prediction

The feature vector used in our logistic regression model consists of a total
of 528 features—48 features at the residue of interest and at 10 neighboring
residues. We provide a brief description of these features in this section as
well as some of the options we considered; further details are provided in
the Supplementary Materials.

2.2.] Sequence conservation features We made use of three sequence
conservation scores. The ﬁrst, termed Global—J S, is the JS divergence (Lin
and Wong, 1990) between the amino acid distribution over the family as a
whole and a background distribution derived from the BLOCKS (Henikoff
and Henikoff, 1992) database [with prior weight = 0.5 as in (Capra and Singh,
2007)]. The other two sequence conservation scores make explicit use of the
phylogenetic tree topology using the INTREPID algorithm (Sankararaman
and Sjblander, 2008). The two variants used the J S divergence (INTREPID—
J S) and the log frequency of the modal amino acid (INTREPID—LO). See
(Sankararaman and Sjblander, 2008) for additional details.

Sequence conservation scores for each position were derived based
on multiple sequence alignments of homologs gathered from the UniProt
database (preiler et al., 2004) using PSI—BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997).
PSI—BLAST was run for four iterations with an E—value inclusion threshold
of 1><10_4 from which a maximum of 1000 homologs were retrieved.
A multiple sequence alignment was estimated using MUSCLE (Edgar,
2004) with MAXITERS set to 2, followed by the removal of identical
sequences and the deletion of columns in which the seed had a gap.
Phylogenomic conservation scores computed using INTREPID also made
use of phylogenetic trees from each alignment. A neighbor—joining tree was
built from each alignment using the PHYLIP package (Felsenstein, 1993),
using midpoint rooting (placing the root at the midpoint of the longest span
in the tree).

2.2.2 Amino acid properties Amino acids have varying catalytic
propensities as noted in Bartlett et al. (2002). We use the amino acid
types as features and also classify the amino acid into one of three
categories—charged (D,E,H,K,R), polar (Q,T,S,N,C,Y) or hydrophobic
(A,F,G,I,L,M,P,V,W). See Supplementary Materials for a description of this
classiﬁcation.

2.2.3 Structure-based features For each residue, we compute the residue
centrality, the B—factor, solvent accessibility, presence in a cleft and
secondary structure as follows. We compute the B—factor, a measure of
thermal motion for each residue as the average of the B—factors of all its
atoms. We compute a measure of centrality for each residue j as the inverse
of the average distance from a residue to all other residues in the enzyme;
i.e. Cj =  where d(k, j) is the distance from j to k along the contact
map. A residue that is located in the center of the protein has smaller average
distance to all other residues and hence a high centrality measure. We use
the seven—state secondary structure representation output by DSSP (Kabsch
and Sander, 1983). The area of a residue accessible to the solvent is obtained
from NACCESS (Hubbard and Thornton, 1993). We use LigSiteCSC (Huang
and Schroeder, 2006) to detect the presence of a residue in one of the three
largest pockets in the enzyme.

2.3 Benchmark datasets

We present results from two datasets of manually curated enzymes from
the CATRES (Bartlett et al., 2002) and Catalytic Site Atlas (CSA; Porter
et al., 2004) datasets. CSA and CATRES deﬁne a residue as catalytic if
it has been shown to be involved in catalysis either directly or through
other molecules, to stabilize an intermediate transition state, or to inﬂuence
a cofactor or substrate that aids catalysis. The manually curated sections
of CSA and CATRES contain enzymes with solved PDB structures for
which experimental evidence for catalytic sites have been obtained from
the literature.

Our primary benchmark dataset, termed CATRES—FAM, consists of 140
enzymes from the CATRES dataset, and was included to allow a direct
comparison with Youn et al. and Gutteridge et al.. This dataset contains a
total of 471 catalytic residues out of a total of 49 180 residues with a median
of three catalytic residues per enzyme.

Our second dataset, termed CSA—Fischer, consists of 423 enzymes from
the manually curated section of the CSA selected by Fischer and colleagues
(2008) to benchmark their FRcons method, and used here to allow a direct
comparison to FRcons.

Additional information on these benchmark datasets and results and details
on two other datasets are reported in Supplementary Materials.

2.4 Performance measurements

We measure the precision and recall on the test set as follows: Precision:
%, Recall: TIL—Pm, where a true positive (TP) is a predicted residue
included in the benchmark dataset, a false positive (FP) is a predicted
residue not listed in the benchmark and a false negative (FN) is a
catalytic residue in the benchmark which has been missed by a method. The
precision—recall curves were averaged over all the cross—validation folds
using the code from Davis and Goadrich (2006). See Section 8—421 in
Supplementary Materials for more details.

For the CSA—Fischer dataset, we followed the protocol described in
Fischer et al. (2008), i.e. we performed 2—fold cross—validation, ensuring that
no domain from the same SCOP superfamily appeared in both the folds. For
CATRES—FAM and other datasets (reported in the Supplementary Materials),
we used 10—fold cross—validation.

2.5 ConSurf and Evolutionary Trace results

ConSurf results for CATRES—FAM were obtained from the database of
precomputed results (http://consurfdb.tau.ac.il). Evolutionary Trace (ET)
results were obtained from the precomputed results of the ET server at the
Baylor College of Medicine (http://mammoth.bcm.tmc.edu/ETserver.html).

In this section, we report results of large—scale experiments on
manually curated enzymes from the CSA (Porter et al., 2004) and

CATRES (Bartlett et al., 2002) datasets, and compare DISCERN with
the best methods for catalytic residue prediction reported in the
literature. Three of these methods make use of machine learning
algorithms to combine sequence and structure information (or
inferences): a neural network approach from Gutteridge et al. (2003),
a support vector machine (SVM) method from Youn et al. (2007) and
the FRcons method from Fischer et al. (2008). (Note that FRcons
uses sequence information only, but predicts structural features to
improve performance.) Three other methods tested make use of
sequence conservation information only: ConSurf (Landau et al.,
2005), ET (Mihalek et al., 2004) and INTREPID (Sankararaman
and Sj01ander, 2008). Web servers, software or precomputed results
were available for ET, ConSurf and INTREPID making possible a
head—to—head comparison with these methods.

We compared DISCERN against Gutteridge et al., Youn et al. and
FRcons based on precision and recall statistics reported by the
authors. We also include a control method in these experiments
designed to evaluate the contributions of the different ingredients
of the DISCERN predictor. The control was trained identically to
DISCERN, but did not include features for structural neighbors or
the INTREPID phylogenomic conservation scores, nor was any
attempt made to enforce model sparsity. Notably, the performance
of the control is very similar to the results reported in Youn et al.,
suggesting that the improved performance of DISCERN relative to
Youn et al. is unlikely to be an artifact of differences between the
CATRES—FAM dataset and the datasets used by these authors.

We used cross—validation on two benchmark datasets to evaluate
DISCERN performance in catalytic site prediction, reporting the
average recall and precision in the withheld test sets in each
partition. The ﬁrst dataset, CATRES—FAM, was designed to allow
comparisons to methods developed by Youn et al. (2007) and
Gutteridge et al. (2003). The dataset used by Youn et al. (2007)
consists of a random subset of the domains present in ASTRAL
40v1.65 (Chandonia et al., 2004). Since the domains that were ﬁnally
selected were not recorded (E. Youn, personal communication),
we could not evaluate DISCERN on their dataset. CATRES—FAM
consists of 140 enzymes from CATRES ﬁltered at the SCOP
(Structural Classiﬁcation of Proteins; Murzin et al., 1995) family
level (i.e. no pair were from the same SCOP family). The second
dataset, CSA—Fischer, consists of 423 enzymes from the CSA
selected by Fischer and colleagues (2008) to benchmark FRcons,
and used in these experiments to allow a direct comparison with
FRcons.

On the CATRES—FAM dataset, as shown in Figure 2, DISCERN
recall is 12—20% higher than that of Gutteridge et al. and Youn
et al. at the levels of precision reported by these authors. Relative to
methods that are restricted to conservation signal only (INTREPID,
ConSurf and ET), DISCERN has 50% greater recall: at a precision of
18%, DISCERN has 69% recall, while INTREPID and ET reach 19%
and 2% recall, respectively (ConSurf does not attain a precision
of 18% over the entire range of recalls). We also evaluated two
prediction methods that make use of 3D structure information
only, LigSiteCSC (Huang and Schroeder, 2006) and PASS (Brady
and Stouten, 2000), on this dataset. Since these methods do not
provide scores for individual residues, we used the residues in the
top three sites identiﬁed by each method as predicted active site
residues. Using this criterion, PASS attained a recall of 29.7% for
a corresponding precision of 3%, and LigSite obtained a recall of
10.6% at a corresponding precision of 1.2%.

Fig. 2. Results on the CATRES—FAM benchmark dataset. Methods included
in this analysis are a neural network method from Gutteridge et al. (2003), a
Support Vector Machine approach from Youn et al. (2007), ConSurf (Landau
et al., 2005), INTREPID (Sankararaman and Sjblander, 2008), ET (Mihalek
et al., 2004) and the control method described in Table 1. The methods
of Youn et al., Gutteridge et al.and the control use information from both
sequence and structure, while ConSurf, INTREPID and ET use conservation
signal only to predict catalytic sites. In cross—validation experiments on this
dataset, at 18% precision, DISCERN reaches 69% recall, corresponding to a
gain in recall of 20% over Gutteridge et al. and 12% over Youn et al. (based
on their reported performance at this level of precision on similar datasets).
Relative to the methods that use conservation signal only, the difference is
greater: at 18% precision, INTREPID reaches 19% recall, while ET reaches
a recall of 2%. ConSurf does not reach 18% precision on this dataset.

On the CSA—Fischer dataset, DISCERN provides superior
performance relative to FRcons for recall values >30%. At a
precision of 18.5% [reported by (Youn et al., 2007)], DISCERN
achieves 15% higher recall than FRcons (DISCERN and FRcons
achieve 65% and 50% recall, respectively). Analysis of the area
under the precision—recall curve, termed PR—AUC, shows that the
PR—AUC of FRcons is 0.1 compared with 0.23 for Discern. On
this more extensive dataset, DISCERN recall is 14% higher than
that of Youn et al. (2007) and 18% higher than that of Gutteridge
et al. (2003) at the precision levels reported by these authors. See
Supplementary Figure S—2 for details.

In addition to these large—scale experiments, we present in the
next section a detailed case study of Bovine a—Chymotrypsin (PDB
id:1acb). Additional experiments on datasets ﬁltered to remove
members from the same SCOP superfamily and a second case
study on Escherichia coli Asparagine Synthetase (PDB id: 12as) are
reported in the Supplementary Materials (Section S—5. 1).

3.1 Bovine a-Chymotrypsin (PDB id:1acb, E.C.
number: 3.4.121.1)

Chymotrypsin (E.C. number 3.4.121.1) is the paradigmatic member
of the so—called serine protease family of enzymes that are
distinguished by having a catalytic triad of residues at the active
site (H57, D102 and S195) (Hedstrom, 2002; Kraut, 1977; Polgar,
2005).

Fig. 3. DISCERN predictions on Bovine a—Chymotrypsin (PDB id: lacb). The
top 15 DISCERN predictions are shown. DISCERN predicts the catalytic triad
H57, D102 and $195, with ranks 6, 4 and 1, respectively. The catalytic
glycine, G193, is predicted with rank 13. Y228 (DISCERN rank 10) is found
in the SI speciﬁcity pocket, but its functional role is unknown. The roles of
Y228 and other residues (D194, C191, C42, C58, Q30, C220, S214, G197,
H40 and G196) are described in Supplementary Table 8—2.

To predict catalytic residues for the a—chymotrypsin structure
lacb, we estimated DISCERN parameters using a subset of the
CATRES—FAM dataset, removing all enzymes in the same SCOP
superfamily as lacb. The top 15 residues predicted by DISCERN
are shown in Figure 3, with additional details provided in the
Supplementary Table S—2.

DISCERN gives the catalytic serine (S195) rank 1. The ,B—hydroxyl
moiety of S195, aided by general base catalysis by the imidazole
(NE2 nitrogen atom) group of H57 (rank 6), attacks the carbon
atom of the scissile peptide or ester substrate to form a tetrahedral
adduct, which, in turn, decomposes to form a covalent enzyme
bound ester intermediate with concomitant release of the amino or
hydroxyl portion of the peptide or ester substrate, respectively. The
general base catalysis is assisted in a way that is not fully understood
by the ,8—carboxylate of D102 (rank 4), whose ,8—carboxylate
functionality makes a strong hydrogen bond (Frey et al., 1994) with
the second nitrogen atom (NDl) of H57. The covalent intermediate
is subsequently hydrolyzed via H57/D102—mediated activation of
the attacking water molecule to yield the carboxylate component of
the substrate with regeneration of the enzyme. The transition state
leading to the tetrahedral intermediate is stabilized by developing
hydrogen bonds from the main chain NH groups of G193 (rank 13)
and S195.

The pancreatic serine proteases are biosynthesized in the
pancreas as inactive proenzymes, which are activated in the small
intestine by proteolytic cleavage of a 15—member peptide from the
N—termini. This results in a number of conformational changes
with concomitant repositioning of hydrogen bonds involving several
residues including Q30 (rank 8) (Kraut, 1977) and H40 (rank 14)

(Berna et al., 1997). D194 (rank 2) forms a salt bridge with the
nascent 116 that forms the N—terminus of the active enzyme.

DISCERN identiﬁes residues G197 (rank 12) and G196 (rank 15);
these allow the peptide chain to form a distinct structural element
called a ,B—bulge (Richardson et al., 1978) which may be important
for positioning the active site serine (S195). DISCERN also identiﬁes
C191 (rank 3) and C220 (rank 9); C191 and C220 form a disulﬁde
bond which has been shown to be critical for enzymatic function
(replacement of C191 and C220 with a pair of alanines resulted
in a 100— to 1000—fold decrease in activity) (Varallyay et al., 1997).
Another pair of cysteine residues forming a disulﬁde bond are found
in the top 15: C42 (rank 5) and C58 (rank 7). The C42—C58 disulﬁde
is part of the binding site for the amino terminus of the scissile
peptide bond (the Pl’ site) (Kraut, 1977).

The roles of two remaining residues in DISCERN’s top 15
predictions are unknown. The highly conserved S214 (rank 11) is
in hydrogen bond contact with one of the ,8—carboxylate oxygen
atoms of D102, and S214E and S214K mutants have been shown
to disrupt function, but an S214A mutant is as active as wild—type
enzyme in the hydrolysis of a tripeptide substrate (McGrath et al.,
1992). However mutation of this residue in thrombin, a closely
related serine protease, does lead to increased Km values for various
substrates (Krem et al., 2002). The proximity of this residue to the
active site and the degree of conservation argue that it is important
in function, although the role remains to be more precisely deﬁned.
Y228 (rank 10) is found in the S1 binding pocket (Hedstrom et al.,
1992), but its role is unknown.

In summary, of DISCERN’s top 15 predicted residues, all but
Y228 are known or proposed to have important roles in catalysis,
substrate recognition, proenzyme activation or formation of key
structural elements in Chymotrypsin. Given the very high percentage
of identiﬁcation of important residues whose functions have been
veriﬁed experimentally, the DISCERN results suggest that mutagenic
probing of Y228 in particular might be illuminating, and that
DISCERN can be generally useful in guiding experimental approaches
to mechanistic investigations of enzymes that have been much less
studied than Chymotrypsin.

3.2 Aspects of the DISCERN predictor

DISCERN combines three ingredients in making a prediction—the
use of phylogenomic scores, information from structure and features
computed at structural neighbors, and a statistical regularization to
control for overﬁtting. To investigate the relative importance of these
three aspects of the predictor, we conducted a set of experiments in
which subsets of these aspects were used. The results are shown in
Table 1. We see that a performance gain is obtained by including
phylogenomic scores. However, a decrease in performance is seen
when structural neighborhood features are also included but the
model is not regularized. This is presumably due to overﬁtting.
Indeed, when the model is regularized, a signiﬁcant performance
gain is observed.

We investigated quantitative aspects of the full DISCERN predictor
after it has been ﬁt to the CATRES dataset (Fig. 4). Among the 528
candidate features considered, 157 had non—zero weights in the ﬁnal
model. Examining these weights provides insight into the ability
of DISCERN to discriminate between catalytic and non—catalytic
residues. The highest weights are associated with features identiﬁed
by others as highly correlated with catalytic sites (e. g. high degrees

We compare DISCERN to simpliﬁed models that make use of conservation signal across the family as a whole and structural features for the residue of interest, but do not include
one or more of ( 1) features computed for structural neighbors, (2) INTREPID phylogenomic conservation scores and (3) L1 -regularization. Precision50 reports the precision at 50%

improvement over the control of 10.3% precision at 50% recall and an increase in recall of 21% at 18% precision. See Section S-5.3 and Figure S-6 in the Supplementary Materials

Fig. 4. Features selected by DISCERN. Shown here are the 15 features with the largest weights based on ﬁtting the logistic regression to the entire CATRES—
FAM dataset. Positive weights indicate positive correlation with putative catalytic residues; negative weights imply negative correlation. The magnitude of
the weight is indicative of a feature’s relative importance. (A) Features computed at the residue of interest. (B) Features summed over residues that are nearby

of sequence conservation across homologs, centrality in 3D structure
and relative solvent accessibility), and the largest negative weights
are those shown previously as anti—correlated (e. g. hydrophobicity)
(Bartlett et al., 2002).

A more subtle point is the fact that the DISCERN prediction is based
on a combination of weighted features. For a residue to achieve a
high rank (relative to other residues), a combination of features must
be present (or absent, in the case of a feature with negative weights).
For instance, while residue centrality has a strong positive weight,
this alone will be insufﬁcient to give a residue a high rank unless
it is also highly conserved, polar or charged, and has some level of
relative solvent accessibility.

Ll—regularization constrains the total weight allocated to a set of
features, with the end result that some features receive zero weight.
In many cases, these features are individually informative but are
effectively redundant due to other features which are given non—
zero weight (i.e. included in the ﬁnal model). Location in a cleft
or pocket is a case in point. We found that the explicit feature
of presence in a cleft or pocket is given a weight of zero in our
model, which is surprising given that presence in a cleft is known
to be one of the hallmarks of catalytic residues (Bartlett et al.,
2002). However, residue centrality and relative solvent accessibility
(features which were given positive weights) jointly encode for
presence in a cleft; i.e. if a residue is both near the center of the

molecule and exposed, it must be in a deep cleft. Thus, enforcing
model sparsity using Ll—regularization resulted in dropping the
feature of presence in a cleft or pocket, but retained residue centrality
and solvent accessibility which allow this deﬁning characteristic of
active site residues to be recognized.

In summary, the features selected by the regularized logistic
regression jointly describe highly conserved, charged, solvent—
accessible residues that are found in clefts or pockets, and whose
neighbors in the 3D structure are also highly conserved.

4 DISCUSSION

In this article, we have described a new approach to the prediction
of active sites in proteins. Our results on benchmark datasets of
manually curated enzymes from the CSA and CATRES resources
show that DISCERN provides a signiﬁcant improvement over the
best methods that make use of information from sequence and/or
structure to predict catalytic sites.

DISCERN is a statistical predictor that brings together three
important ideas, the combination of which are needed in order to
obtain the striking improvements in accuracy shown here. First,
DISCERN uses an evolutionary modeling approach (speciﬁcally, the
INTREPID phylogenomic method) to infer the degree to which
residues are under selective pressure. Second, we incorporate

Active site prediction

 

information from the structural neighborhood of a residue
including features (such as sequence conservation, charge, solvent
accessibility, etc.) computed for structurally proximal residues.
Third, and critically, we use statistical sparsiﬁcation methods
(speciﬁcally, Ll—regularization) to cope with the fact that our
statistical model is based on a large number of redundant, noisy
features. Without such regularization, we ﬁnd that our method
overﬁts—in particular, the inclusion of information from structural
neighbors leads to a decrease in accuracy. With regularization, we
obtain a signiﬁcant increase in accuracy. Regularization allows us
to ﬁnd a signal within the large set of candidate features that can be
used to describe the structural and evolutionary neighborhood of an
amino acid.

The parameters of the statistical model underlying DISCERN
are the weights of various features that capture the evolutionary
and structural context, computed both for the residue of interest
and for its structural neighbors. The largest weights tend to be
associated with features identiﬁed by others as highly correlated
with catalytic sites (e.g. high degrees of sequence conservation
across homologs, centrality in 3D structure and relative solvent
accessibility), and the largest negative weights are those shown
previously as anti—correlated (e.g. hydrophobicity). But the model
is not restricted to such known features; it can create new features
as linear combinations of the given features. Moreover, the model
parameters act in concert: for a residue to achieve a high rank, a
single feature is generally insufﬁcient; multiple features must be
present. The features selected by DISCERN jointly describe highly
conserved, charged, solvent—accessible residues that are found in
clefts or pockets, and whose neighbors in the 3D structure are also
highly conserved.

While many catalytic site prediction methods exploit residue
conservation as a primary source of signal (Gutteridge et al.,
2003; Youn et al., 2007), most of these restrict homologs to
only moderately divergent sequences, limiting the effective use
of this signal. In contrast, DISCERN makes use of the INTREPID
phylogenomic conservation score (Sankararaman and Sj01ander,
2008), which is able to exploit the conservation information in highly
divergent datasets.

DISCERN is not the only method to use information from
structural neighbors for catalytic residue prediction, but there are
a few differences between DISCERN and approaches used by others
that may contribute to the improved performance. In particular,
several methods use spatial clustering (Aloy et al., 2001; Landgraf
et al., 2001; Panchenko et al., 2004) as a post—processing step
(Gutteridge et al., 2003) based on classiﬁcation of individual
positions independently in an initial stage. In contrast, DISCERN uses
features from structurally neighboring residues as an integral part
of the model. Closer in spirit to DISCERN is the method proposed
by Youn et al. (2007), which uses atom—level features (Bagley and
Altman, 1995) in concentric shells (weighted equally within each
shell) around the C ,3 atom of the residue of interest (Mooney et al.,
2005). As in DISCERN, this yields a rich set of features describing
the neighborhood. Crucially, however, Youn et al. do not enforce a
penalty that enforces sparsity of parameters in their model, and the
poorer performance of Youn et al. (2007) relative to DISCERN may
reﬂect the kind of overﬁtting that we observe in Table 1.

In this work, we have evaluated DISCERN on two large—scale
datasets: the CATRES benchmark dataset (Bartlett et al., 2002)
and a homology—reduced subset of manually curated enzymes

from the CSA (Porter et al., 2004). While CATRES and CSA
provide important resources to benchmark the accuracy of prediction
methods, ﬁnite resources (e. g. a small number of biological curators
entering data into the CSA) and the inevitable lag between
publication and data entry can result in not all catalytic residues
being included. As our case studies show, this can result in residues
that are predicted by a method as catalytic being labeled as false
positives even if they are, in fact, catalytic.

Finally, our case studies suggest that DISCERN can be effective
at identifying general types of functionally important positions
(such as ligand—binding residues), and is not restricted to catalytic
residue identiﬁcation per se. In fact, the general approach underlying
DISCERN is extensible and general, and can be applied to model
other types of functional residues such as binding pocket speciﬁcity
determinants and interaction interfaces. Each of these application
areas depends only on the availability of high—quality training data,
such as that provided in the CSA.

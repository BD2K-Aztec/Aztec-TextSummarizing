Abstract

Summary: PsyGeNET (Psychiatric disorders and Genes association NETwork) is a knowledge plat-
form for the exploratory analysis of psychiatric diseases and their associated genes. PsyGeNET is
composed of a database and a web interface supporting data search, visualization, filtering and
sharing. PsyGeNET integrates information from DisGeNET and data extracted from the literature
by text mining, which has been curated by domain experts. It currently contains 2642 associations
between 1271 genes and 37 psychiatric disease concepts. In its first release, PsyGeNET is focused
on three psychiatric disorders: major depression, alcohol and cocaine use disorders. PsyGeNET
represents a comprehensive, open access resource for the analysis of the molecular mechanisms
underpinning psychiatric disorders and their comorbidities.

Availability and implementation: The PysGeNET platform is freely available at http://www.psyge
net.org/. The PsyGeNET database is made available under the Open Database License (http://open
datacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1.0/).

1 Introduction

 

Psychiatric disorders have a great impact on morbidity and mortal-
ity, accounting for 1:3 of disability worldwide (Murray and Lopez,
2013; Whiteford et al., 2013) and generating most of healthcare ex-
penditure (Collins et al., 2011). Psychiatric diagnoses are syndromes
rather than diseases with operative diagnostic criteria based on
symptoms and signs (e.g. the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders, and the International Classification of Diseases
Diagnostic Criteria) and lacking reliable biological markers. Co-
occurrence of two or more psychiatric diagnoses (‘psychiatric

comorbidity’) has been reported to be very frequent. This co-
occurrence raises two major clinical questions: whether there are
underlying common environmental, genetic and neurobiological
ethiopathological factors and what is their impact on clinical care.
For instance, there is a high prevalence of comorbidity between
major depression (MD) and substance use disorders (Pettinati et al.,
2013) which might be related to poor therapeutic outcome for both
disorders (WHOClobal Status Report on Alcohol and Health,
2014). In the past years, there has been a great progress on the gen-
etics of psychiatric disorders (Sullivan et al., 2012). However, there

is still limited understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms
underlying these diseases and their comorbidities. Some of the factors
limiting progress in this area are (i) the heterogeneity and fragmenta-
tion of the available data on psychiatric disorders into silos and (ii)
the lack of resources that collect these wealth of data, integrate them
and supply the information in an intuitive, open access manner to the
community. PsyGeNET (Psychiatric disorders and Genes association
NETwork) has been developed with these issues in mind. PsyGeNET
integrates curated information on psychiatric disorders and their
genes, offering exploratory tools for their query and analysis. In its
current version, we focused on three psychiatric disorders: MD, alco-
hol use disorder (AUD) and cocaine use disorder (CUD). The selection
of the diseases has been made on the basis of the following factors: (i)
the significant burden of each of the diseases for the society, (ii) the
large body of literature reporting results on the genetics of these dis-
eases, in particular for MD and (iii) the comorbidity between MD and
substance use disorders. Here, we describe the development of the
database, the functionalities of the platform and the questions that
can be addressed with PsyGeNET.

2 PsyGeNET database

PsyGeNET database (version 1.0, release January 25, 2015) con-
tains 2642 gene-disease associations (GDAs) between 1271 genes
and 37 psychiatric disease concepts collected from DisGeNET
(Piﬁero et al., 2015) and the literature by text mining followed by
expert curation. The psychiatric disorders were defined by experts in
the domain of psychiatry and neurobiology using 59 (MD), 13
(AUD) and 11 (CUD) UMLS concepts (the list of concepts is avail-
able at http://www.psygenet.org/).

2.1 Curated data

We included expert-curated, direct associations between human
genes and the selected disease concepts from the Comparative
Toxicogenomics DatabaseTM [CTD (Davis et al., 2013)]. On the
other hand, a dataset of GDAs identified by text mining and curated
by domain experts was developed (PsyCUR). To this end, Medline
abstracts published between 1980 and 2013 in journals with a SCI
impact factor greater than one were processed by BeFree (Bravo
et al., 2015) to select sentences with GDAs. The diseases were identi-
fied using the UMLS concepts that define each disorder, whereas an
in-house developed gene dictionary was used to identify the genes,
as described in Bravo et al. (2015). A web-based annotation tool
was developed to assist the curation process. The curators were pre-
sented with a putative GDA and additional information such as the
supporting publications with links to the PubMed abstracts and to
DisGeNET was provided. The curator decided to annotate a par-
ticular GDA as valid based on her background knowledge and the
publications that support the GDA identified by text mining. Only
valid GDAs were stored as PsyCUR.

2.2 Animal model data

We obtained genes from animal models of the diseases of interest
from the Mouse Genome Database [MGD (Blake et al., 2014)] and
the Rat Genome Database [RGD (Laulederkind et al., 2013)].
Mouse and rat genes were mapped to their human orthologs using
the mapping files provided by MGD (ftp://ftp.informatics.jax.org/
pub/reports/HOM_MouseHumanSequence.rpt) and RGD (ftp://rgd.
mcw.edu/pub/data_release/RGD_ORTHOLOGS.txt), respectively.
These mapping files are derived from NCBI HomoloGene. We only
included GDAs from animal models when a human ortholog of the

mouse or rat gene could be found and were supported by publica-
tions. In the case of RGD, we did not include the associations
labeled as ‘resistance’, ’induced’ or ‘no association’ nor the ones
annotated with the following evidence codes ‘Inferred from elec-
tronic annotation’, ‘Inferred from sequence or structural similarity’
and ‘Non-traceable author statement’.

2.3 Other data sources

We extracted GDAs from the Genetic Association Database (GAD),
an archive of human genetic association studies of complex diseases
(Becker et al., 2004). It includes a summary extracted from published
articles in peer-reviewed journals on candidate gene and Genome
Wide Association Studies (GWAS). We only included GDAs from
GAD that were not labeled as ‘negative’ or ‘normal variation’.

2.4 Data classification

We organized the data according to the source databases in the fol-
lowing classes: CURATED (containing GDAs from PsyCUR and
CTD), MODELS (containing GDAs from RGD and MGD) and
GAD (containing data from GAD).

2.5 Data attributes

Diseases are annotated to UMLS concepts and classified according
to the MeSH disease hierarchy, whereas genes are annotated to
NCBI Gene and UniProt and classified according to the Panther
Protein Ontology. Each GDA is annotated with the supporting evi-
dence (the publications reporting the GDA, a representative sentence
describing the association and the original source of provenance)
and the PsyGeNET score. The PsyGeNET score ranks each GDA
taking into account the number of sources that report each associ-
ation, the level of curation of each source and the number of publi-
cations supporting the association. The score ranges between 0 and
1 and is computed as follows:

S = SPSYCUR + SCTD + SMODELS + SLITERATURE

where
0.5 if the association is reported by PSYCUR
SPSYCUR={
0 otherwise
0.2 if the association is reported by CTD

UMLS concepts that define each psychiatric disorder: 59 concepts
for MD, 13 concepts for AUD and 11 concepts for CUD UMLS (the
list of concepts is available at http://www.psygenet.org/). We used
DisGeNET to query OMIM (downloaded on February 2015) and
CTD (version 13949M, downloaded on February 2015), as it allows
using UMLS concepts to search for diseases. We used PsyGeNET re-
lease 1.1 (January 2015). The results are listed in Table 1, where the
PsyCUR column represents the genes only available in PsyGeNET
and not present in the other sources.

3 PsyGeNET web interface

The PsyGeNET platform is composed of a database and a web inter-
face with a set of analysis tools, powered by Onexus (http://www.
onexus.orgl). The web interface supports searching, visualizing,
filtering and sharing of PsyGeNET data. Data files containing the re-
sults of the user’s search can be downloaded in a variety of formats.
Moreover, automatically generated scripts are provided in several pro-
gramming languages to reproduce the analyses performed by the user
and to incorporate them into bioinformatic workﬂows. Lastly, func-
tionalities are offered to share the results of queries performed with
PsyGeNET via e-mail or by embedding the HTML code of explor-
ation results in web pages. The web interface offers two entry points:

Search view: It allows the user to search a speciﬁc gene (or disease)
in the database using free-text or standard identiﬁers. As a result,
the user retrieves all diseases (or genes) that are associated with the
gene (or disease) and the supporting evidence. Queries on multiple
genes or diseases are also supported.

Browse view: It allows the user to explore all the information start-
ing by a speciﬁc data source (e.g. PsyCUR). The results are shown
in the same way as when using the Search view.

The PsyGeNET results can be filtered by the score, data source
and attributes of the data. The web interface also provides links to
external resources such as NCBI Gene and UniProt for genes,
Linked Life Data for diseases and PubMed for publications. The
user can inspect the evidence of each GDA by exploring the sen-
tences extracted from the supporting publications in which the gene
and disease are highlighted. For more details on the functionalities
offered by the web interface, go to the Web Interface Help section
(http://www.psygenet.org/).

4 PsyGeNET applications
Examples of questions that can be answered with PsyGeNET are:
1. Which genes are associated to alcoholism in expert-curated

databases?
2. What subtypes of depression are available in PsyGeNET?

3. Which genes support the association between MD and AUD?

A step-by-step guide on how to answer these questions is avail-
able in the online tutorial (http://www.psygenet.org/).

5 Conclusions

We have developed PsyGeNET as a new resource to foster transla-
tional research on psychiatric disorders and their genes, through an
open access database and publicly available exploration and analysis
tools. A comparison to other databases indicates that PsyGeNET is
unique regarding data quality and coverage (Table 1). PsyGeNET
can be used to support different case studies on psychiatric diseases
and their comorbidities. Because of its comprehensiveness, level of
curation and suite of tools, PsyGeNET represents a valuable re-
source to foster the research on the molecular and biological mech-
anisms underpinning psychiatric disorders and their comorbidities.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Local ancestry analysis of genotype data from recently
admixed populations (e.g. Latinos, African Americans) provides key
insights into population history and disease genetics. Although meth-
ods for local ancestry inference have been extensively validated in
simulations (under many unrealistic assumptions), no empirical study
of local ancestry accuracy in Latinos exists to date. Hence, interpreting
findings that rely on local ancestry in Latinos is challenging.

Results: Here, we use 489 nuclear families from the mainland USA,
Puerto Rico and Mexico in conjunction with 3204 unrelated Latinos
from the Multiethnic Cohort study to provide the first empirical char-
acterization of local ancestry inference accuracy in Latinos. Our
approach for identifying errors does not rely on simulations but on
the observation that local ancestry in families follows Mendelian inher-
itance. We measure the rate of local ancestry assignments that lead to
Mendelian inconsistencies in local ancestry in trios (MILANC), which
provides a lower bound on errors in the local ancestry estimates. We
show that MILANC rates observed in simulations underestimate the
rate observed in real data, and that MILANC varies substantially
across the genome. Second, across a wide range of methods, we
observe that loci with large deviations in local ancestry also show
enrichment in MILANC rates. Therefore, local ancestry estimates at
such loci should be interpreted with caution. Finally, we reconstruct
ancestral haplotype panels to be used as reference panels in local
ancestry inference and show that ancestry inference is significantly
improved by incoroprating these reference panels.

1 INTRODUCTION

During the past decade, studies of recently admixed populations
(e. g. Latinos, African Americans) have been used to detect asso-
ciations of genomic regions with disease risk and for the infer-
ence of population genetic parameters (Seldin et al., 2011; Verdu
and Rosenberg, 2011). These populations emerge from the
mixing of genetically diverged ancestral populations for a rela-
tively small number of generations (typically <20). Owing to
crossover recombination events, the chromosome of any
admixed individual is a mosaic of chromosomal regions originat-
ing from the ancestral populations. Identifying the ancestral
origin of each of these regions is the goal of local ancestry
inference.

Local ancestry inference has proven to be an extremely valu-
able resource for medical genetics in detecting genes associated
with disease through admixture mapping or through a combin-
ation of genome-wide association, admixture mapping and re-
sequencing studies (Fejerman et al., 2012; Freedman et al., 2006;
Pasaniuc et al., 2011; Shriner et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2011).

In additional to medical genetics, local ancestry has been success-
fully used in estimating fundamental quantities such as recom-
bination rates, as well as in revealing the effects of natural
selection and recent demography during the past generations
(Hinch et al., 2011; Jarvis et al., 2012; Jin et al., 2012; Johnson
et al., 2011; Tang et al., 2007).

Achieving the aforementioned goals critically relies on
estimates of local ancestry that are both highly accurate and
unbiased (not showing artifactual deviations) at any region in
the genome (Pasaniuc et al., 2011; Seldin et al., 2011).
Although a signiﬁcant number of methods have been proposed
and shown to be accurate in simulations, the performance of
current approaches for multi—way admixed populations such as
Latinos [with their genome a mixture of European (EUR),
African (AFR) and Native American (NAM) chromosomes]
has not been fully examined in empirical data (Baran et al.,
2012; Brisbin et al., 2012; Johnson et al., 2011; Pasaniuc et al.,
2009; Price et al., 2009; Sankararaman et al., 2008; Sundquist
et al., 2008; Tang et al., 2006). Simulation studies inevitably
make simplifying assumptions about the mixture process (such
as random mating, number of generations of admixture, the per-
generation admixture proportions) and the availability of accur-
ate proxies for the true ancestral populations. The effect of
Violations of these assumptions on local ancestry inference and
subsequent analyses has not been fully investigated in empirical
data. For example, the use of inappropriate proxies for the an-
cestral populations could produce systematic local ancestry
errors leading to false positive associations in admixture mapping
(Baran et al., 2012). To correctly interpret genetic studies of
Latinos, it is critical to assess local ancestry performance in em-
pirical data.

In this work, we provide approaches to quantify the error rate
in local ancestry estimates in empirical data without the use of
simulations. Our approach uses the fact that local ancestries
follow Mendelian inheritance. Local ancestry estimates (inferred
by methods that do not model family relationships) that lead to
Mendelian inconsistencies in trio families provide a lower bound
on the errors present in the local ancestry estimates. We propose
to measure the rate of Mendelian inconsistencies in local ancestry
(which we term the MILANC rate) as a means to assess error
rates in the local ancestry estimates (which we refer to simply as
the error rate). Our approach mirrors widely used approaches in
genotyping and sequencing studies that use Mendelian inconsis-
tencies to assess the overall error rate. The MILANC rate pro-
vides, for the ﬁrst time, a real data-based evaluation of local
ancestry estimates as opposed to simulations that cannot meas-
ure systematic inaccuracies arising from Violations of model as-
sumptions. Violations from model assumptions can occur at a
global scale (e.g. deviations from random mating) and at a local
scale (e.g. improper modeling of recombination rates) that could
lead to complex error patterns in the local ancestry estimates.

We analyze genotype data from 489 Mexican and Puerto
Rican trio families from the Genetics of Asthma in Latino
Americans [GALA study (Burchard et al., 2004)] in conjunction
with 3204 unrelated Latinos from the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC)
study (Kolonel et al., 2000) to assess the accuracy of local an-
cestry inference across the genome in Latinos. We use the
MILANC rate to evaluate the error rate of severally widely
used methods for local ancestry. We observe that the

genome-wide average MILANC rate is signiﬁcantly higher in
empirical data as opposed to simulations. Thus, simulations
under-estimate the true underlying error rate in the local ancestry
estimates in Latinos. Second, we show that errors in local ances-
try estimates vary substantially across the genome with several
loci attaining signiﬁcantly higher error rates than the average.
Importantly, we observe that loci with increased deviations in the
average local ancestry (more than three standard deviations) also
show increased MILANC rate. This result holds for all con-
sidered methods, suggesting that this is a general property of
local ancestry estimation.

Although the distribution of MILANC rates is approach spe-
ciﬁc, for the best performing methods, we observe a general pat-
tern where the MILANC rate correlates with deviations in local
ancestry. We hypothesize that this is due to the fact that the
reference panels do not fully capture the genetic diversity in the
ancestral populations of current day Latinos and therefore a
large percentage of errors correspond to alleles being mislabeled
preferentially toward a given ancestry. An implication of this
observation is that loci with higher deviations in their local an-
cestry estimates tend to have elevated MILANC rates. Such loci
could lead to false positive associations in scans of local ancestry
across the genome (e. g. case-only admixture mapping). We pro-
vide maps of MILANC rates for all compared methods as a
public resource for the scientiﬁc community.

An important caveat of studies of Latino populations is that
the Native American component is estimated using current day
Native American populations [e.g. Maya and Pima of the
Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP) (Li et al., 2008)]
that may have been exposed to European gene flow. We use
family information to accurately estimate panels of ‘Virtual’ an-
cestral haplotypes (NAM, EUR and West African) for the
Latino populations of GALA, in a manner similar to (Johnson
et al., 2011). Here, we show that these ‘Virtual’ ancestral panels
yield increased accuracy and lower bias than cosmopolitan
panels when used in local ancestry inference across both
GALA and the MEC studies. This suggests that the new refer-
ence panels provide a better representation of the ancestral popu-
lations of current day Latinos. We provide the inferred reference
panels as a public resource for the scientiﬁc community.

2 METHODS

GALA damsel. A total of 232 and 257 mother—father—child trio families
of Mexican and Puerto Rican ethnicities were collected as part of the
GALA Study (Burchard et al., 2004); GALA is a multi—center, interna-
tional effort designed to identify and directly compare clinical, genetic
and environmental risk factors associated with asthma, asthma severity
and drug responsiveness among Latino ethnic groups. The trios were
ascertained on an asthmatic proband. Genotyping was performed using
the Affymetrix 6.0 GeneChip Array. SNPs were ﬁltered based on call
rates 2 95%, Hardy—Weinberg equilibrium at signiﬁcance level of
10e-6 (in founders), < 1% Mendelian inconsistencies and an unambigu-
ous mapping to the human reference genome (hgl8). The total number of
SNPs passing QC was 837 383. Subjects were ﬁltered based on call rates
> 95%, consistency between reported and genetic sex and the absence of
any unexpected identity by descent or by state. Familial relationships
were conﬁrmed using measures of identity by descent and Mendelian
inconsistencies.

Biases in local ancestry estimation

 

MEC dataset. The MEC is a large prospective cohort study in
California (mainly Los Angeles County) and Hawaii (Kolonel et al.,
2000). Included in this analyses were Latino breast and prostate cancer
cases and control subjects from Genome-Wide Association Studies
(GWAS) of these cancers in the MEC [546 breast cancer cases and 558
control subjects (Fejerman et al., 2012); 1043 prostate cancer cases and
1057 control subjects (Waters et al., 2009)]. Genotyping of both studies
was conducted using the Illumina Inﬁnium 660W array in the Epigenome
Data Production Center at USC (breast) and the Broad Institute (pros-
tate). We excluded all SNPs with minor allele frequency of < 1% and call
rate of < 99%, and we excluded samples that had a genotyping call rate
of < 95%, as well as samples that showed cryptic relatedness. For MEC
local ancestry analyses, we intersected MEC and GALA SNP sets to
achieve a SNP density of 127 935 across the genome.

Inferring local ancestry in Latinos. We evaluated the error characteris-
tics of four methods for local ancestry inference: LAMP-LD (Baran et al.,
2012), ALLOY (Bercovici et al., 2012), WINPOP (Pasaniuc et al., 2009)
and PCAdmix (Brisbin et al., 2012). The ﬁrst two methods model linkage
disequilibrium (LD) in the ancestral populations, whereas the latter two
methods model SNPs as independent conditional on local ancestry. All
methods were run independently on each chromosome with default par-
ameters. As proxy for the AFR ancestry we used the 226 haplotypes of
the HapMap 3 phase 2 YRI (Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria) population,
whereas for the NAM ancestry, we used 88 Native American samples (25
Bolivian Aymara, 24 Peruvian Quechua and 39 Mesoamericans) that
were genotyped using the Affymetrix 6.0 array (Bigham et al., 2010).
We inferred the Native American haplotypes from genotype data using
the Beagle (Browning and Browning, 2007) phasing algorithm. For the
EUR ancestry, we tested the results both using the 224 HapMap 3 phase
2 CEU (Utah residents with ancestry from northern and western Europe)
haplotypes, as well as using a sample of Spanish individuals from the
POPRES data (Nelson et al., 2008) genotyped on the Affymetrix 550k
platform. To remove potential artifacts from mislabeling of the reference
allele across populations, we disregarded the C/G and A/T SNPs. We
merged all data by taking the intersection of all SNP sets. For GALA
data, this procedure yielded 588 595 SNPs (denoted as 600k) for the data
that uses CEU as proxy for the Europeans and 302 449 (denoted as 300k)
for the dataset that uses POPRES Spanish as proxy for the EUR ances-
try. For all compared methods, we used the most likely ancestry estimate
at each locus in each individual.

Quantifying errors in local ancestry inference in real data. The presence
of family relationships allows us to compare the estimates of local ances-
try at a given SNP among the members of the trio. We expect the local
ancestry at the child to be consistent with Mendelian inheritance rules.
For example, an SNP at which the child is inferred to have EUR ancestry
on both chromosomes while one of the parents does not have EUR an-
cestry alleles indicates an error in the estimated local ancestry. We refer to
these errors as MILANC. MILANC is only relevant to methods that
estimate local ancestry in unrelated individuals, when applied to family
data. We infer local ancestry in real Latino trios using methods that treat
every individual as unrelated and report the MILANC rate at every locus
in the genome deﬁned as the proportion of all trio families that contain at
least one Mendelian inconsistencies in their estimated local ancestry.
Unless otherwise noted, we averaged MILANC rate across all SNPs in
contiguous non-overlapping windows of 1 Mb in length. The results were
relatively insensitive to the choice of window lengths (Supplementary
Table S4).

Relationship of MILAN C rate and error rate in local ancestry estima-
tion. Consider a single SNP at which local ancestry is inferred. The error
rate in the local ancestry at this SNP is drawn from some distribution
F with mean % and standard deviation  Given a trio of individuals and
assuming that the errors in inferring the local ancestry of each allele in
this trio are independent, the probability of at least a single local ancestry
error in this trio is denoted 8. For small local ancestry error rates, the

distribution of 8 across SNPs has mean u and standard deviation
0. Under the assumption of an uncorrelated error process across trios,
the number of ancestry errors at this SNP for n trios is given
by 0 ~ Bin(n,e). Assume that a fraction 0: of these errors lead to
Mendelian inconsistencies. Thus M, the MILANC, at this SNP follows
M |0 ~ Bin(0, 0:). Then the squared correlation coefﬁcient in the popu-
lation between MILANC and the error rate, ,02 = p(M, 0)2, is computed

p2—>1.

Simulations of Latino admixed chromosomes. To investigate the relation
between MILANC and true underlying error rate, we simulated a Latino
population by mixing of European, NAM and West African chromo-
somes [HapMap phase 3 data together with the 88 Native Americans of
(Bigham et al., 2010), see earlier in the text]. Following the strategy of
(Price et al., 2009), we simulated admixed chromosomes by ﬁrst simulat-
ing recombination positions using a random walk from the 5’ -end to the
3’ -end, with crossovers between chromosomes occurring as a Poisson
process with rate g — 1 = 14 times the recombination rate. Conditional
on the positions of recombination events, we assigned the ancestry of
each segment between two consecutive breakpoints using the admixture
proportion of 0.45:0.45:0.1 for European, Native American and West
African populations, respectively. Finally, we selected at random one
haplotype per ancestry to create an admixed haplotype by copying seg-
ments according to the ancestry blocks. For all the simulation results
presented here, we removed the haplotypes used in simulation of admixed
data from the panel of haplotypes used as reference. For computational
purposes, we restricted all simulations to the Affymetrix 6.0 SNPs from
chromosome 1 (48 827 in total).

Inferring ancestral haplotype panels. We followed a two-step procedure
to infer ancestral haplotypes from the GALA trios. First, we ran LAMP-
HAP (Baran et al., 2012), a local ancestry method that takes family
relationships into account to achieve highly accurate local ancestry esti-
mates at every locus in the genome for every trio. LAMP-HAP provides
an assignment of ancestry at each of the four haplotypes in the trio. In the
second step, we selected all haplotype segments with corresponding an-
cestry assignment to form the reference panels of haplotypes (with seg-
ments from other ancestries set to missing). Similar approaches have been
used in previous works for inferring ancestral haplotype segments
(Bryc et al., 2010; Johnson et al., 2011).

Quantifying deviations in local ancestry and correlation to MILANC
rate. We divided the genome into non-overlapping windows of 1Mb
and computed the average local ancestry y}? in each window w for each
ancestral population p 6 {European, Native American, African}. Using
standard approaches, we normalized the deviations in local ancestry by

subtracting the mean and dividing by observed variance: 7;,” = W,
I’

where the mean and variance is taken across all windows w. We com-
puted average MILANC EWMILANC for each window and correlated
EWMILANC to 7711,”. To test the hypothesis that the correlation is zero, we
used the statistic m X p(EM1LA NOT/1,), where NW is the number of con-
sidered regions assumed to be independent. This test statistic approxi-
mates well (at small values of p, as expected under null) the Fisher’s
transformation 2 = 0.5* ln((1 + p) / (1 — p)) known to be asymptotically
normally distributed. We selected windows 10 Mb apart (yielding 271 in
total across the genome) and assumed the observations are independent.

Expected variation in the average local ancestry across the genome.
Under standard demographic assumptions (e.g. panmixia, no
continuous inﬂux of chromosomes from one ancestry), we can model
the local ancestry as a draw from the multinomial distribution with
parameter 0 = (0E,6N,6A), where 0 denotes the vector of genome-wide
proportions of the three ancestral populations. Therefore, the average
EUR local ancestry in a sample of NC chromosomes (the mean across
NC draws) has variance of 015* (1 — 6E)/Nc (same for the other ancestries);
we note that the theoretical estimates of the variance assume independ-
ence of the draws, which leads to deﬂated estimates. We estimate the
empirical standard deviation as the square root of the empirical variance.
We note that Violations of the assumptions above (e. g. continuous inﬂux
of chromosomes in the admixture) have the potential of increasing the
variance of the true local ancestries.

Quantifying the signiﬁcance of reduction in MILANC rate by
permutations. We measured the beneﬁt of the new reference panel using
the difference in the average MILANC rates as computed using the new
panel versus the standard one. We measured statistical signiﬁcance of the
difference being greater than 0 using permutations. We randomly per-
muted the label of the MILANC rate in the given window across the two
runs (with different reference panels) to create a null model of no differ-
entiation between the average MILANC rate. Across 10000 permuta-
tions, we did not observe any permutation that achieves a higher
difference in the average MILANC rate that the one observed in the
unpermuted data.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Identiﬁcation of errors in local ancestry via family
relationships

To measure error rates in empirical data, in which the true local
ancestry is unknown, we leverage the fact that local ancestry
follows Mendelian inheritance. Therefore, pedigree relationships
can be used to identify errors in local ancestry estimates by
simply testing whether the inferred ancestral status of the
child’s chromosomes can arise through Mendelian inheritance
from the ancestral status of the parents’ chromosomes. For ex-
ample, if at a given locus, the father has AFR ancestry on both
chromosomes, whereas the mother has EUR ancestry, the child
must have a single chromosome that is AFR and one that is
EUR (Fig. 1). We independently estimate local ancestry for
each individual in a pedigree using methods that ignore family
relationships and then test each position in the genome of the
child with the genomes of the parents for Mendelian inconsist-
ency in its local ancestry. The percentage of trios with at least one
Mendelian inconsistency in local ancestry (termed MILANC
rate) gives a direct lower bound of the error rate in local ancestry
inference at any locus in the genome. Importantly, MILANC
rate does not require the true ancestry and thus provides a meas-
ure of performance at each locus in real data. In contrast, the
local error rate is hard to estimate in simulations, as the speciﬁc
characteristics of the different loci in the genome cannot be fully
accounted for.

We analytically derived the correlation between MILANC
rate and the underlying error rate in the local ancestry estimates
as a function the number of trios, percentage of errors that mani-
fest as MILANC and the mean and variance of the error rate
across the genome (Section 2). We show that the correlation of
MILANC to the true error rate converges to l with increasing
number of trios as long as there exists variation in the local error

ferent colors

rate across the genome. This proves that MILANC is inform-
ative of the underlying error rate in the limit of large sample sizes
as long as there is variability in the error rate across the genome.

To further quantify the relationship between MILANC rate
and the error rate, we simulated 500 Latino trios using standard
parameters and estimated their local ancestry independently in
each individual ignoring family relationships using LAMP-LD
(Baran et al., 2012) (Section 2). The ancestry estimates attained
an average genomic error rate (deﬁned as percentage of all alleles
with incorrect inferred ancestry) of 3.0% with standard deviation
of 1.3%. This suggests that the error rate varies across the gen-
ome, thus making MILANC informative about the true under-
lying local error rate (see earlier in the text). We estimated the
average MILANC (as percentage of trios with at least one
MILANC) across loci of 1.5% (S.E.M. 0.2%). We observed
that 8.2% (S.E.M. 0.6%) of the errors in local ancestry inference
lead to MILANC, equivalent to roughly 24% all loci with at
least one error in the trio yielding a MILANC. The squared
correlation between MILANC and the error rate attained a
value of 0.52 greatly exceeding the theoretical squared correl-
ation of 0.07 under the assumption of no variability in the
local error rate and roughly matches the theoretical squared cor-
relation of 0.60 expected at 500 trios, error rate of 3% (standard
deviation of 1.3%) and 8% of all errors leading to Mendelian
inconsistencies. The difference between theoretical and observed
correlation could be due to the correlations in the errors in local
ancestry estimates and due to sampling variance. These results
are consistent with an error model with variable rates across the
genome out of which 8% of errors in local ancestry yield
MILANC.

To better characterize the error rate in ancestry estimation on
empirical data, we computed MILANC rates in the GALA
Mexican and Puerto Rican trios using local ancestry estimates
from methods that model ancestral haplotype structure [LAMP-
LD (Baran et al., 2012), ALLOY (Bercovici et al., 2012)] and
methods that assume independent SNPs when conditioning on
ancestry [WINPOP (Pasaniuc et al., 2009), PCAdmix (Brisbin
et al., 2012)]. Table 1 shows that the MILANC rate across the
genome varies with methodology for ancestry inference em-
ployed, with best performing methods attaining an average
MILANC rate ~3%, signiﬁcantly higher than simulation studies
(MILANC of 1.5% in 500 simulated trios for LAMP-LD). These
results suggest that the error rates estimated in simulations may
be signiﬁcantly lower than in real data (simulation assumptions
may lead to reduced error rates). This further emphasizes the
utility of studying error rate using MILANC in empirical data.
As previously reported, we observe that modeling of ancestral

LD through haplotypes leads to increased performance over
methods that model independent SNPs conditional on their an-
cestry in Puerto Ricans (Baran et al., 2012).

3.2 Loci with increased deviations in local ancestry show
an elevated MILANC rate

We investigated whether loci with increased deviations in local
ancestry are enriched with Mendelian inconsistencies (MILANC)
in the GALA trios. Similar to previous works (Bryc et al., 2010;
J in et al., 2012), we deﬁned loci with increased deviations in local
ancestry as all loci showing :3 standard deviations increase or
decrease in any of the three local ancestry components. Table 2
shows that for all considered methods for all ancestries, loci with
increased deviation in local ancestry show an elevated MILANC
rate. Results in Table 2 are consistent with a model in which
deviations in local ancestry occur at loci with higher error rates
in local ancestry inference.

Conversely, we quantiﬁed the average deviation in local
ancestry at loci with elevated MILANC rates. Table 3 shows
that for most methods, loci with elevated MILANC rate also
show deviations in local ancestry. For example, in the Mexican
data, we observe that at loci with 7.5% or greater MILANC
rates, the average deviation in AFR local ancestry is 2.9 and
4.1 standard deviations for WINPOP and ALLOY, respectively.
These results are consistent with an error model that mislabels
alleles preferentially toward AFR ancestry. We observe similar
patterns for haplotype-based methods (LAMP-LD and
ALLOY) in Mexican trios with respect to EUR and NAM an-
cestry in that they tend to increase EUR ancestry at the expense
of NAM ancestry. We also note that LAMP-LD attains fewer
loci with extremely large MILANC rate than other methods.

3.3 Exploration of MILANC rates in Latinos

Having established that all methods considered show deviations
in ancestry at loci with increased MILANC rate, we investigated
in details factors affecting local ancestry estimates from LAMP-
LD (one of the best performing methods). Figure 2 plots the
MILANC rate across the genome for LAMP-LD (similar results
are obtained for other methods, Supplementary Note). Twenty-
three loci (non-overlapping regions of 1 Mb) in Mexicans and 24
loci in Puerto Ricans attained an elevated MILANC rate (at least
three standard deviations above the average MILANC; nominal
threshold of 7.6% for Mexican and 5.9% for Puerto Ricans).
MILANC shows large variability across the genome, regardless
of the method or reference panel used albeit different approaches

trios computed when ancestral LD is modeled (LAMP-LD) in local
ancestry estimation procedure. Horizontal lines denote 3 (4) standard
deviations from the average

yield increased error rates at different loci (Supplementary Note).
These outliers are likely due to complex linkage disequilibrium
and recombination rate patterns not represented in the reference
panels.

We compared MILANC rate and deviations in the average
local ancestry proportions of AFR, EUR and NAM ancestries.
We observe that MILANC correlates to decreases in NAM and
increased EUR local ancestry (Fig. 3). For example, in Mexicans,
the Pearson correlation coefﬁcient r is 0.41 between MILANC
and EUR local average ancestry and —0.44 for MILANC and
NAM; the correlation is signiﬁcantly different from 0 at a
P-value of 2 X 10_8(1 X 10‘”) for the EUR (NAM) ancestry
and is not signiﬁcant (P-value of 0.12) for the AFR ancestry.
The association of MILANC rate with average local ancestry
persists across Latino populations and inference methods.
In Puerto Ricans, we observe r of 0.16 (—0.26) between
MILANC and EUR (NAM) ancestry with P-values of
3 X 10_3(9 X 105) for r2 different from 0. Similar to
Mexicans, we do not observe squared correlation signiﬁcantly
different from 0 (P-value 0.95) for the AFR ancestry (Fig. 3
and Supplementary Note). In addition, we observe signiﬁcant
correlations in MILANC between Puerto Ricans and Mexicans
r2=0.08 (P-value 4 X 10‘6) in LAMP-LD estimates, as well as
signiﬁcant correlation across LAMP-LD and WINPOP of
r2=0.09 (P-Value l X 10‘6) for Mexicans and r2=0.ll
(P-value 6 X 10‘8) for Puerto Ricans. The results are consistent
with an error model in which certain regions are susceptible to
increased error rates across populations and methods (presum-
ably, the diversity in these regions is not accurately captured by
the reference panels). We hypothesize that the correlation be-
tween the MILANC rate and EUR or NAM ancestries is due
to a tendency to miscall NAM alleles as EUR, thus leading to
inﬂated EUR estimates. Consequently, local ancestry estimates
at loci with large MILANC are not simply noisier but are likely
to be biased. This effect can lead to false positive associations,
given large enough sample sizes, in local ancestry scans in
Latinos (e. g. case-only admixture mapping or scans for selection)
as loci with elevated error rates tend to also have increased EUR
at the expense of NAM ancestry (Supplementary Note).

Most of the errors that contribute to MILANC (72% in
Mexicans and 54% in Puerto Ricans) are made between EUR
and NAM ancestries (Supplementary Note). This effect could be

explained by the fact that error rate correlates with genetic dis-
tance among the ancestral populations (Pasaniuc et al., 2009).
This is also supported by the observation that the per-individual
MILANC is negatively correlated with the genome-wide AFR
ancestry proportion (Supplementary Note, r = —0.39), reﬂecting
that it is easier to discriminate segments of AFR ancestry from
those of EUR and NAM ancestries than it is to discriminate
NAM ancestry from EUR ancestry. We note that as we do
not know the true ancestry at any locus in the genome, we
cannot assign directionality, and we therefore cluster the errors
by pairs of ancestries.

We investigated whether a Northern [HapMap CEU
(Altshuler et al., 2010)] or a Southern [POPRES Spanish
(Nelson et al., 2008)] EUR ancestry panel provides a better per-
formance for local ancestry in Latinos (Section 2). At similar
SNP density, we observe (Table 4) that the Southern European
reference panels provides marginal increase in performance.
Interestingly, the advantage of using a Southern versus
Northern European panels as proxy for the EUR ancestry in
Latinos is similar in magnitude to the advantage attained by
using a denser SNP panel (Table 4). However, the behavior is
different across Mexicans and Puerto Ricans. We note a much
larger gain in accuracy for Puerto Ricans when using a much
denser panel of SNPs than for Mexicans. Potential explanations

for this effect include having better proxy for the Native
American contribution of Puerto Ricans in our Meso and
South American reference panels (Martinez-Cruzado et al.,
2005).

3.4 Extendability of map of MILANC rates to
multiple studies

We tested whether the map of MILANC rates inferred on the
GALA cohort is useful for other studies in Latinos. We esti-
mated local ancestry in 3204 unrelated Latino samples from
the MEC data using LAMP-LD (Baran et al., 2012) (Section
2) and compared the MILANC rates inferred from the GALA
Mexican trios with deviations in the average local ancestry in the
MEC data. We observed correlations of 0.43, —0.42 and —0.01
between MILANC estimated in GALA data to EUR, NAM and
AFR ancestry, respectively, estimated in MEC data. Thus, the
correlation between MILANC and average local ancestry is not
speciﬁc to the GALA cohort (Supplementary Note) but extends
to other studies showing the usefulness of estimating MILANC
in GALA.

We observe a mean ancestry of (0.631, 0.323, 0.046) in the
MEC data with empirical standard deviations of (0.022, 0.022,
0.005) for the EUR, NAM and AFR ancestries. Genome-wide
signiﬁcant deviations from the average local ancestry (deﬁned as
4 or more empirical standard deviations from the mean genome-
wide ancestry) were observed only at the human leucocyte anti-
gens region on chromosome 6 in the NAM ancestry
(Supplementary Note). The signiﬁcant deviations in average
local ancestry at the human leucocyte antigens region could be
the result of higher error rates observed at this region (the
MILANC rate at this region varies between 5 and 6%) but
can also be due to a real signal (e.g. recent selection in the
region). Further work is required in determining whether signiﬁ-
cant deviations in local ancestry at this locus are an effect of
selection or artifacts of local ancestry inference, or possibly a
combination of both. No other genome-wide signiﬁcant devi-
ations were detected at this signiﬁcance level, consistent with
the phenotype ascertainment of this data.

3.5 Improving the reference panels for local ancestry
inference in Latinos

In principle, having accurate estimates for local ancestry in
Latinos should allow us to construct better reference panels of
the ancestral populations for local ancestry inference. A recon-
structed reference panel would be particularly valuable for the
Native American component where the true ancestral estimates
are not available or where current panels are limited in their
sample size. Although recent works have reconstructed ancestral
haplotypes for population demographic inferences (Bryc et al.,
2010; Johnson et al., 2011), here we focus only on the utility of
such reconstructed ancestral haplotype panels for local ancestry
inference. Given 489 trios, we expect 489 X 4 X 0.45 = 880.2
NAM alleles at each locus (see genome-wide admixture propor-
tions in Table 1). Thus, these inferred Native American panels
could prove to be a better proxy for the ancestral Native
Americans in other Latino populations. To assess the utility of
these panels, we performed two experiments.

In the ﬁrst experiment, we split the GALA trios into two data-
sets. We used LAMP-HAP, an extension of LAMP-LD to infer
local ancestry in trios (Baran et al., 2012), to estimate the local
ancestry in 123 randomly chosen GALA trios. We extracted the
NAM, EUR, and AFR haplotype segments, thus creating new
reference panels. The number 123 was chosen so that the total
number of inferred NAM and EUR alleles roughly matches the
number of alleles in the initial reference panels. To assess the ac-
curacy of this reference panel, we computed MILANC on the
LAMP-LD local ancestry estimates in the remaining 366 trios
(treating each of the individuals independently). As a baseline,
we computed MILANC attained by LAMP-LD using the refer-
ence panels containing a dense set of SNPs (600k) over the same
366 trios. We observe a signiﬁcant reduction in the overall average
MILANC rate when the newly constructed reference panels were
used (genome average of 1.7% as opposed to the 2.6%,
Supplementary Note), permutation P-value <1 X 10‘4 (Section
2). Thus, our newly inferred reference panel provides a signiﬁ-
cantly better inference accuracy, suggesting a better estimate of
the true ancestral components of Latinos, both at a global level
and at particular loci (Supplementary Note).

In a second experiment, we tested whether the newly con-
structed reference panels are useful in studies over cohorts
other than the ones that are part of the GALA study. To test
this hypothesis, we assessed local ancestry estimates in the MEC
sample when the newly built GALA reference panels were used
in addition to the cosmopolitan reference panels. We observed
mean of (0.598, 0.360, 0.042) with empirical standard deviations
of (0.014, 0.014, 0.005) for the EUR, NAM and AFR ancestries,
respectively. We observe a large decrease in the standard devi-
ation of average local ancestry estimates across the genome,
closer to the expected theoretical standard deviations of (0.006,
0.006, 0.002) for the three ancestries (although we note that we
expect the theoretical variance to be deﬂated as it assumes all
samples are independent, panmixia and a single admixture
impulse, assumptions that may not always hold in practice). In
addition, the decrease in EUR mean ancestry from 0.631 to 0.598
in conjunction with an increase in the NAM inferred ancestry
from 0.323 to 0.360 further supports a reduction in the overall
error rate coupled with a biased error model that preferentially
mislabels NAM alleles as EUR (most likely due to a misrepre-
sentation of the true NAM ancestry in the reference panels). This
hypothesis is further supported by a signiﬁcant reduction in the
correlation of MILANC rate and the deviations in average local
ancestry (e.g. r = 0.43 to r = 0.31 for EUR average local ancestry,
permutation P-value <10_4) showing that the bias is reduced
when our new reference panels are used in addition to the cosmo-
politan reference datasets (Supplementary Note). Finally, we
note that this effect (increased genome-wide EUR ancestry
when computed from local ancestry estimates) is consistent to
other recent works [Supplementary Figure S1 of Johnson et al.
(Johnson et al., 2011)] that also show increased genome-wide
EUR ancestry when computed from local ancestry estimates.
These results emphasize the importance of accurate reference
panels for future studies of local ancestry in Latino populations.

We also separately extracted the ancestral haplotypes from 232
Mexican trios and 257 Puerto Rican trios, respectively. We com-
puted the standard allele frequency differentiation statistics F ST
between the inferred ancestral allele frequencies of Mexicans and

Puerto Ricans computed from these haplotypes. We observe a
much greater allele frequency differentiation between the ances-
tral Native American components of the two Latino population
than the difference between the EUR ancestries consistent with
previous works that show large genetic diversity among the
NAM ancestors of current day Latinos (Martinez-Cruzado
et al., 2005) (see Table 5).

4 DISCUSSION

Accurate local ancestry inference in Latinos forms an important
component of disease and population genetic studies in these
populations. Biases in local ancestry estimation would lead to
false positive associations thereby invalidating the scientiﬁc
results reported in these analyses. In this work, we quantiﬁed
the accuracy of local ancestry inference at each location in the
genome using real genotype data over >4000 Latino individuals.
Our study provides the ﬁrst comprehensive evaluation of local
ancestry methods using external information taken from family
data and thereby overcomes the simplifying assumptions of
simulation-based assessments. We provide a direct analytic rela-
tion between the sample size, the MILANC and the error rates of
ancestry inference. We estimated the MILANC rates for a
number of state-of-the-art local ancestry methods—ALLOY
(Bercovici et al., 2012), LAMP-LD (Baran et al., 2012),
PCAdmix (Brisbin et al., 2012) and WINPOP (Pasaniuc et al.,
2009). All methods exhibit qualitatively similar behavior. First,
we observe that the MILANC rates associated with each of these
methods vary considerably across the genome. We construct gen-
omic maps of MILANC rates for different local ancestry infer-
ence methods that can be used to aid researchers in interpreting
the results of studies of local ancestry in Latinos. Second, we ﬁnd
that loci with increased deviation in local ancestry inference show
increased Mendelian inconsistency rates in local ancestry infer-
ence in Latinos. Our results strongly suggest that local ancestry
estimates at these loci are biased. This is important for studies of
local ancestry in Latinos such as case-only admixture mapping or

studies of natural selection that aim at identifying loci with large
deviations in local ancestry. The genomic maps of MILANC
rates could serve as a valuable tool to distinguish true signals
from loci where the local ancestry estimates are inaccurate. For
example, we ﬁnd 12 loci as putative for natural selection in the
GALA Mexican data (more than 3 standard deviations increase
in the EUR local ancestry). We observe an average MILANC
rate of 6.5% at these loci, signiﬁcantly higher than the average
genomic rate of 3.2%. This suggests that an alternate explan-
ation for part of the enrichment of EUR ancestry at these loci is
error/bias of local ancestry inference.

As future work, we propose to incorporate the newly inferred
error rates in robust association statistics that model the vari-
ation in error rates across the genome in addition to unbiased
local ancestry inference methods. Our results also show that cur-
rently available genotype data from Latinos can be used to build
better reference panels to be used as proxies for local ancestry
inference in Latinos; this motivates the need for improved meth-
odologies for recovery of ancestral haplotypes from admixed
populations. In practice, to obtain high resolution map of the
locus-speciﬁc error rates, our analysis should be replicated with a
considerably larger sample size. However, even with the current
sample size, we show a signiﬁcant correlation between the
MILANC results and the average ancestry, as well as a statistic-
ally signiﬁcant reduction in MILANC rates when an improved
reference panel is available. We observe this phenomenon when
using a denser set of SNPs as a reference panel, as well as when
using a closer population (e.g. Spanish instead of CEU). It is
therefore crucial to construct highly accurate reference panels,
and as a ﬁrst step toward this goal, we show that a reference
panel can be reconstructed by extracting the ancestral haplotypes
from an admixed population. Clearly, another potentially viable
approach may be to sequence a large number of NAM, EUR
and AFR samples and use those as a reference.

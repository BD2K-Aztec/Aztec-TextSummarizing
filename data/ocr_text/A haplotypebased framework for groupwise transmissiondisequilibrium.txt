Abstract

Motivation: A major focus of current sequencing studies for human genetics is to identify rare vari—
ants associated with complex diseases. Aside from reduced power of detecting associated rare
variants, controlling for population stratification is particularly challenging for rare variants.
Transmission/disequilibrium tests (TDT) based on family designs are robust to population stratifi—
cation and admixture, and therefore provide an effective approach to rare variant association stud—
ies to eliminate spurious associations. To increase power of rare variant association analysis,
gene—based collapsing methods become standard approaches for analyzing rare variants. Existing
methods that extend this strategy to rare variants in families usually combine TDT statistics at
individual variants and therefore lack the flexibility of incorporating other genetic models.

Results: In this study, we describe a haplotype—based framework for group—wise TDT (gTDT) that
is flexible to encompass a variety of genetic models such as additive, dominant and compound
heterozygous (CH) (i.e. recessive) models as well as other complex interactions. Unlike existing
methods, gTDT constructs haplotypes by transmission when possible and inherently takes into
account the linkage disequilibrium among variants. Through extensive simulations we showed
that type I error was correctly controlled for rare variants under all models investigated, and this
remained true in the presence of population stratification. Under a variety of genetic models, gTDT
showed increased power compared with the single marker TDT. Application of gTDT to an autism
exome sequencing data of 118 trios identified potentially interesting candidate genes with CH rare
variants.

1 Introduction

Next generation sequencing is routinely employed to identify rare
variants, e.g. variants with minor allele frequency (MAF) <0.01,
associated with complex traits. Although there are examples of stud—
ies implicating rare variants in complex diseases/traits (Auer et 61].,
2014; Cohen et 61]., 2004; Cruchaga et 61]., 2014; Ji et 61]., 2008;
Nejentsev et 61]., 2009; Nelson et 61]., 2012), it is clear that such
studies remain underpowered, and elucidating the contribution of
low—frequency variants to disease etiology should benefit from add—
itional methodology advances. Major challenges include the low
power of traditional analysis methods and the severe multiple testing
problem. For case—control studies, group—wise methods, such
as CAST (Morgenthaler and Thilly, 2007) and CMC, collapse rare
variants into a single genetic unit—a gene, region or pathway—to
test the association of multiple rare variants as a whole. The under—
lying rationale of collapsing approaches is that if multiple variants
at a locus confer disease risk independently, aggregating individual
variants strengthens the overall signal and avoids multiplicity in
single- and multi-marker tests, resulting in increased power for asso—
ciation analysis of rare variants (Li and Leal, 2008). A more power—
ful approach is to take a weighted sum of rare variants, with weights
reﬂecting the genetic effects of the corresponding variants (Li et 61].,
2013; Madsen and Browning, 2009). Such a strategy has the poten—
tial to achieve much improved power by assigning weights propor—
tional to the genetic effect of corresponding variants. A variety of
methods have been developed with varying ways of selecting and
weighting rare variants (Han and Pan, 2010; Li et 61]., 2013; Neale
et 61]., 2011; Price et 61]., 2010; Wu et 61]., 2011) in an effort to
increase power of rare variant association studies and new methods
continue to emerge (see reviews Asimit and Zeggini, 2010; Li et 61].,
2013 for more details).

This rationale in group—wise strategy to increase power, how—
ever, is able to aggregate and amplify spurious association signals as
well, if such undesired signals exist. Such spurious association can
be due to population stratification. For common variants, this con-
founding has been long recognized and can be effectively accounted
for by existing methods (Kang et 61]., 2010; Price et 61]., 2006). Most
rare variants are relatively young and often show differential allelic
spectra in populations traditionally considered as homogeneous;
85% of rare variants are population specific (Tennessen et 61].,
2012). Population stratification effects due to rare variants can
be stronger than that due to common variants, and methods rou—
tinely used for controlling population stratification in association
studies of common variants may fail for rare variants (Mathieson
and McVean, 2012). Family—based analysis, such as the transmis—
sion/disequilibrium test (TDT) (Spielman et 61]., 1993), uses only
transmission information from parents to offspring and is therefore
robust to such confounding. The collapsing approaches of rare vari-
ants originally developed for unrelated samples have been extended
to gene—based TDT and show improved power over single marker
TDT while controlling for population stratification/admixture
(De et 61]., 2013; He et 61]., 2014; Jiang et 61]., 2014), providing a ro-
bust approach to rare variant analysis. The general strategy of these
methods involves initial analysis done based on single variants, and
statistics across all rare variants are then aggregated, usually in a
linear fashion, to form a gene— or group—wise statistic (De et 61].,
2013; He et 61]., 2014; Jiang et 61]., 2014). These methods essentially
implement additive genetic models, and are unable to model inter—
actions among rare variants in a gene or pathway. Such interactions
may play important roles in complex disease (Lim et 61]., 2013; Liu
and Leal, 2010). For example, the compound heterozygous (CH)

model of loss of function variants has been implicated in autism
(Lim et 61]., 2013). Given that causal rare variants may act in com—
plex mechanisms at different loci for different diseases, it is critical
to develop methods that can encompass flexible models in a unified
framework, and to provide tools that enable the community to carry
out such analyses.

In this study, we describe a general framework for group—wise
TDT (gTDT) for rare variants and implement a few classical genetic
models in a user—friendly and computationally efficient tool. The
gTDT is haplotype—based and models the transmission of rare vari—
ant carrying haplotypes rather than single variants. Directly model—
ing haplotypes is advantageous because (i) the transmission unit
is haplotype and therefore it is the logical unit to model, and
(ii) gene products originate from haplotypes, so it is biologically
meaningful to model haplotypes (Tewhey et 61]., 2011), (iii) it is
straightforward to model interactions among variants along haplo—
types or between father or mother’s haplotypes and (iv) linkage dis-
equilibrium (LD) among variants is precisely accounted for without
explicit estimation of LD. Given the flexibility of the framework, a
variety of models can be implemented. For example, models imple-
mented in our tool include not only simple models such as additive
and CH models but also a hybrid that fuses CH and weighted addi—
tive models to test for recessive effects while incorporating prior
knowledge on different variants. It is straightforward to extend to
other customized models tailored to specific diseases or genes to
meet specific needs. Through extensive simulations, we showed that
type I error was correctly controlled for rare/low—frequency variants
(e.g. up to MAF : 0.1) under a variety of scenarios, including vari-
ous levels of population stratification. We evaluated the power of
gTDT for different underlying genetic models, and gTDT signifi-
cantly outperformed single marker TDT. For additive models we
were able to compare gTDT with other methods and observed com—
parable power. Overall our gTDT provides a ﬂexible framework
and an efficient computational tool to identify rare variants impli-
cated in diseases.

2 Methods

2.1 gTDT for rare variants

The gTDT models phased genotypes and thus requires haplotype
construction. If genotypes provided are phased by other means,
gTDT can directly takes the haplotypes to carry out haplotype—based
gTDT analysis. When unphased genotypes are provided, gTDT
automatically re—constructs haplotypes by transmission within each
trio when carrying out the analysis. The phasing is carried out as
following. We assume all variants are bi—allelic with allele 0 and 1,
representing the reference and alternative allele, respectively. We
denote the offspring’s ordered genotype as (A1, A2) such that A1
is transmitted from father and A2 is from mother. For parental geno—
types, the alleles are arranged in an order that the allele on the left is
transmitted to offspring and the allele on the right is not transmitted.
By this convention, the order of the alleles can be uniquely deter—
mined for all possible genotype configurations (15 in total) in a trio
except the ambiguous situation in which all genotypes in a trio are
heterozygous. This process is repeated for all variants in a trio
so that phasing can be determined along the chromosome. In am-
biguous cases, two phasing configurations are compatible, one of
which can be obtained from the other by flipping the two alleles in
each of the ordered genotypes in a trio. Phasing is randomly assigned
for such cases in gTDT. For rare variants this will be extremely rare
and therefore has little impact on the analysis (see Section 3).

Suppose we are testing the group—wise association of] rare variants
in N parents—proband trios. Let G denote the phased genotypes
of an individual as determined above, i.e. G : (H1,H2), where H1
and H2 are the two haplotypes in the gene or genomic region. We
further let Hg, 1': 1,2 and j: 1,. . .,], denote the coding of the jth
variant on haplotype H,, with  = 1 when it carries a rare allele
and zero otherwise. Let GF:(HF1,HF2) and GM:(HM1,HM2) de—
note the father and mother’s genotypes respectively, then the child’s
genotype is deduced as GC:(HF1,HM1) according to the phasing
strategy aforementioned. To achieve the aggregation effect of mul—
tiple rare variants in a group, we define a function, 5(G), which
numerically codes the phased genotype across multiple rare variants
in appropriate ways to reflect the underlying genetic models. This
framework provides a ﬂexible approach to incorporating a variety
of different genetic models (see examples below and Table 1). Let
P(D|G) denote the risk of being affected when the genotype is G,
and define the relative risk (RR) of G over a baseline genotype Go
as P(D : 1|G)/P(D : 1|G0). Suppose the RR follows a multiplicative
model, i.e.

log = ﬂ(5(G) — 5(60» <1)

The null hypothesis (H0: ﬂ :0) holds when no variants in the
group are associated with the disease, i.e. RR = 1. The conditional-
on—parental—genotype likelihood (Schaid, 1996) of a trio is:

P(DIGC7 GF: GM)P(GC|GF7 GM)

P GCD,G ,G = , ,
( I F M) Sc; P(D I Ge 7GF7GM)P(GC IGFaGM)

 

The sum in the denominator is over all four possible phased
offspring genotypes from the parents, and P(GC|G1:, GM) :
P(GCl |GF, GM) : 1/4. Assuming that disease status only depends
on the child’s genotype in a trio, the above equation is simplified to

: P(DIGc) : exp(ﬂ5(Gc))
ZG;P(D|G’C) Zcéexp (135(G;))

 

P(GCID7 GF7 

Differentiating the log likelihood of the above and evaluating at
ﬂ = 0, we get the score statistic for a trio under the null hypothesis
as the following:

In the above equation, 5(GC) and 2G; 5(G/C) are the observed
and expected numerically coded genotypes of offspring. The four
possible phased genotypes under the null, i.e. random transmission
from parents to offspring, are GIC1 : (H131, HMl), GIC2 : (HF1,HM2),

G/c3 Z (HF27HM1)9 G/c4 : (HF27HM2)9 0f WhiCh G/cl : (HFlaHM1)
is the same as the observed offspring genotype by construction.
The variance of the score under the null, V(S) 2%26 5(G/C)2—

derivative of the log likelihood and evaluating at ﬂ = 0. A score test
can then be constructed by summing over all N trios as

t:

One—sided or two—sided tests can be carried out depending on
specific hypothesis. The key advantage of this framework lies in
the ﬂexible aggregation of phased genotypes to encompass a variety
of models to increase power. In this study, we describe five genetic
models that were implemented in our user-friendly tool. The AD
model is the traditional additive model across all variants
and between the two haplotypes, i.e. 5(G) : 5(H1,H2) :
271:1(H’, —l—  In this model the aggregate coding of the genotype
is the count of rare variants carried in this group. The wAD is the
weighted version of the additive model, where the weight w,- is as—
signed to the jth variant. The DOM is the carrier (i.e. dominant)
model, where the phased genotype is coded 1 if an individual carries
one or more rare variants. The CH is a compound heterozygous
(i.e. recessive) model in which the two haplotypes have to carry at
least one rare allele each. The wCH is a hybrid of wAD and CH,
in which compound heterozygotes are coded as the weighted sum
of individual variants. If equal weights are assigned to all variants,
wCH becomes a hybrid of AD and CH. For the representation of all
models, see Table 1. It is straightforward to extend the framework
to handle other models, with possible incorporation of complex
interactions among rare variants across haplotypes, by designing
coding schemes of the phased genotypes. We plan to incorporate
such models in our software package as the need arises.

By default, gTDT uses a frequency—dependent scheme similar to
Madsen and Browning (2009), i.e. wi : Um, where p,- is
the MAF of the jth variant and is estimated based on parental geno—
types. This weighting scheme up—weights rare variants under the hy—
pothesis that the rarer variants have larger effect sizes, and is also
robust against non—causal common variants by down—weighting
them. More efficient weighting schemes can be constructed by incor—
porating prior knowledge, e.g. prediction scores from various
bioinformatics tools. Our tool can readily take such weights into
these models to carry out customized gTDT tests.

We implemented gTDT in C—I——I—. It takes a multi—sample VCF as
input and calculates either one—sided or two—sided tests depending
on the user’s input. More details are available in the online manual.
In this study, we used two—sided tests for the evaluation.

2.2 Simulation

We evaluated the type I error and power of gTDT using simulated
data. In order to generate simulated data that resemble empirical
data in allele frequency, LD, and population differentiation, we
adopted cosi (Schaffner et al., 2005) to generate haploid DNA
sequence pools, each of which contained 10 000 haplotypes.
To generate a trio, a pair of haplotypes was randomly drawn from
a pool and assigned as the genotype of each parent, and offspring’s
genotype was generated by randomly selecting a haplotype from
each parent. For type I error evaluation, we simulated N trios and
assigned the offspring as affected, regardless of offspring’s genotype.
For power analysis, the disease status of offspring was determined

based on the penetrance model described in Equation (1), in which
the penetrance was calculated according to RR with the baseline
penetrance of 0.05. Only trios with affected offspring were
collected.

Under the null hypothesis, we generated 50 000 replicates of
1000 trios. Two lengths of haplotypes with 30 and 50 variants were
simulated. We used the two lengths to explore the grouping of
regions similar to the average gene coding sequences as well as situ—
ations where larger genes or genes with non—coding variants are
included. To further test type I error in the presence of population
stratification, we generated haplotype pools for both European and
African populations using cosi, and then simulated trios based on
these haplotypes. Next, we mixed trios from different populations at
ratios of 1:4, 1:1 and 4:1 to simulate different levels of population
stratification. Again 50 000 replicates with 1000 trios were gener—
ated as described above such that population stratification issues
were included in simulated data.

To evaluate the power of gTDT, data were simulated under AD,
wAD, CH and wCH models separately. To mimic the reality in
which both causal and non—causal variants are present, we selected
haplotypes with 100 variants and randomly assigned 10 or 30%
of variants with MAF <0.05 as causal. For AD with equal effect
sizes, we assigned ﬂ :log(4), i.e. RR:4, to all causal variants and
zero otherwise. For CH, we used ﬂ :log(10), to causal compound
heterozygotes and zero otherwise. For wAD, we assigned effect sizes
in an allele frequency—dependent fashion. Let ﬂ,- denote the specific
effect of the jth variant. We first assumed variants with MAF below
0.01 have weights ﬂ,- 6 [log(1.5), log(4)] and a linear relationship
between ﬂ,- and MAF. Specifically, we divided ﬂ,- [log(1.5) — log(4)]
and MAF [0.01 — 0.0001] into 10 equal intervals and then assigned
ﬂ,- to variants with corresponding MAF. For variants with
MAFe[0.01, 0.1], we adopted ﬂ,- 6 [log(1.2), log(1.5)], and also
divided MAF and ﬂ,- into 10 equal intervals, then assigned variants
with different weights as above. Finally, we assigned a constant
ﬁ,=log(1.1) to all the variants with MAF >0.1 if included. In this
setup, the variants with smaller MAF were assigned higher effect
sizes. For all simulations, power was evaluated based on 1000 repli—
cates each of which had a sample size of 1500 trios.

3 Results

3.1 Evaluation of type I error
We first evaluated type I error at or level of 0.05 with different
numbers of collapsed variants in homogenous population when the
phasing was known through simulations. Table 2 summarizes
the proportion of replicates with P—value get for variants spanning
minor allele frequencies <0.1 under various genetic models. Type I
error rates were correctly controlled in all the scenarios, although
for the CH and wCH the tests were conservative (Table 2). We also
investigated the type I error rates for variants with MAF between
0.1 and 0.5 and no inflation of type I error was observed (data not
shown), indicating that LD was correctly accounted for even though
extensive LD exists among common variants. The conservativeness
of CH and wCH is due to the rarity of compound heterozygotes
of rare variants and is a common phenomenon associated with
rare variants (Li and Leal, 2008; Li et al., 2013). Furthermore,
we obtained similar results when evaluating the type I error at or level
of 0.005 (data not shown).

In typical data analysis pipelines, usually only unphased
genotypes are generated. One solution is to phase genotypes using
statistical methods, such as BEAGLE (Browning and Browning,

2009), MaCH (Li et al., 2010), SHAPEIT (Delaneau et al., 2013)
or TrioCaller (Chen et al., 2013). We investigated whether phasing
by simple transmission implemented in gTDT was adequate to
reconstruct haplotypes to correctly control the type I error rates.
Table 2 shows the type I error rates for the same scenarios as investi—
gated for known phasing. For variants with MAF <0.1 the type I
error rate was adequately controlled for all genetic models, with
similar conservativeness observed for CH and wCH. When variants
with MAF >0.1 were included, inﬂation of type I error rates was
observed (Supplementary Table S1). This is caused by incorrect
phasing, which occurs when all individuals of a trio are heterozy—
gotes and becomes common when the MAF increases. However,
the collapsing approach is applied only to rare variants and such
configurations are extremely unlikely to be observed, confirmed by
the correct type I error rates for variants with MAF below 0.1.
When it is desirable to include common variants in the collapsing,
it is necessary to phase genotypes using LD—based tools in order to
correctly control the type I error rates.

Variants that are heterozygous in all individuals of a trio are
non-informative in single marker tests, but have impact on the type
I error of haplotype—based gTDT if not phased correctly. We use the
example with two variants in a group in Supplementary Figure S1 to
illustrate the impact of incorrect phasing on test statistics. While the
phase of the second variant (at the bottom) is uniquely determined,
the phasing of the first variant is ambiguous. There are two compat—
ible phasing configurations (Supplementary Fig. S1). For AD, the
scores for cases 1 and 2 are the same, while the corresponding vari-
ances are different, e.g. 1.67 and 0.33, respectively. This holds for
wAD as well. For DOM, both the scores and the variances are
different in the two cases, with S = 0.75, V(S) : 0.25 for case 1 and
S: 1, V(S) :0 for case 2. For CH, the same pattern holds as for
DOM, with S = 0.25, V(S) : 0.25 for case 1 and S = 0.5, V(S) : 0.33
for case 2. The wCH is similarly affected. Based on these analyses
ambiguous phasing has differential impact on different tests, and
without phasing by LD, incorrect haplotype construction can lead to
inﬂation of type I error rates as shown in Supplementary Table S1.
For additive models the impact is not as dramatic as others
(Supplementary Table S1), probably due to the use of random phas—
ing implemented in gTDT, which potentially reduces the impact on
the overall statistics.

Finally, we evaluated type I error in the presence of population
stratification. In this investigation, we used phasing by transmission
to reconstruct haplotypes for gTDT rare variant analysis. As
expected, the type I error rates were well controlled at different

levels of population stratification for all models and MAF <0.1
(Table 3). The overall patterns were similar to scenarios without
population stratification (Tables 2 and 3). When phasing was avail—
able, our framework had correct type I error rates regardless of
allele frequencies in the presence of population stratification
(data not shown).

3.2 Evaluation of statistical power of gTDT

We explored the power of gTDT using simulated data for different
models with various effect sizes. All tests were carried out on data—
sets with 1500 trios. For datasets simulated under AD, the power of
additive models with and without weighting showed the highest
power for variants with different allele frequencies (Table 4). When
the data were simulated with varying effect sizes, the weighted
version of the additive model exhibited the greatest power, and
was significantly more powerful than the unweighted version when
high-frequency non—causal variants were included (Table 4). For
scenarios in which CH was the true model, CH and wCH were
more powerful than other models (Table 4). However, wCH was
more powerful than the CH model (Table 4), due to the use
of weights that preferentially penalize non-causal high frequency
variants. Consistently, for data simulated under the CH model with
varying effect sizes, wCH was the most powerful one (Table 4).
It is noticeable that the power was significantly lower for CH mod—
els even though higher effect sizes were used. This is not surprising
due to the rarity of compound heterozygotes and only large effects
in such models can be detected. In addition, the dominant model
(DOM) was generally very similar to the unweighted additive model
(AD) (Table 4). For additive models we were able to compare the
power of gTDT with other methods, and we observed similar power
compared with rvTest (He et al., 2014) in various scenarios. For
example, the power of wAD was ~93% for MAF <0.05 at alpha

level of 0.05, and for the same setting the power was ~94% for
rvTest.

There are scenarios that are non—informative to single variant
TDT but have impact on haplotype—based gTDT results: (i) parents
have the same genotypes that are homozygous rare allele and
(ii) parents have different homozygous genotypes. These two have
no impact on additive models since such variants contribute nothing
to both the score and its variance. This is not the case for other mod—
els. For example, with scenario (i), the genotype is coded as 1 for the
DOM and CH model, and non—zero for wCH; with scenario (ii),
it has the same effect on DOM as for (i), and has the potential
to make the genotype as compound heterozygotes. Although such
variants do not contribute variance to the test statistics on their
own, they may carry valuable functional information, which is
captured and reﬂected in gTDT via haplotype—based modeling.

3.3 Application to autism trio exome sequencing data
We applied gTDT to exome sequencing data of 118 parent-offspring
trios as part of the University of Illinois at Chicago’s Autism Center
of Excellence (ACE) project. The sample information has been
described elsewhere (Levin—Decanini et al., 2013). The exome data
were generated at the Center for Inherited Disease Research, and
variant calling was carried out using the standard GATK pipeline
(DePristo et al., 2011; McKenna et al., 2010). We only kept the
variants that passed the GATK’s VQSR quality assessment.
Variants were annotated using ANNOVAR (Wang et al., 2010)
(2014Mar10) and we denoted non—synonymous, stop and splicing
variants as ‘functional’ variants.

Since TDT assumes under the null that the transmission of alleles
from parents to offspring is random, i.e. the probability that either
allele is transmitted is 0.5, we first checked whether the transmission
rate had a systematic deviation from 0.5 in GATK calls. The trans-
mission ratios along with other statistics are displayed in Table 5.
For functional variants there was an under—transmission bias as
transmission ratios are <50% across all MAF and depth cutoffs
investigated (Table 5). We also investigated the transmission ratio
using all variants and observed a more severe under—transmission
bias compared with functional variants (Table 5 ). The major differ-
ence in the non—functional variants is the relatively lower depth
(~50><) compared with functional variants (~73><), and for lower
coverage the bias will be more severe. We reasoned that a major
cause of the bias was the genotype calling error that tended to mis—
call rare heterozygotes as homozygous reference allele, as a strong
prior was assigned favoring the reference allele in standard variant
calling algorithms. For example, in a trio where a rare allele is

transmitted from mother to child (Supplementary Fig. S2), a miscall
in either the mother or the child will induce under-transmission—for
case I it is a Mendelian inconsistency and an under—count of the
true transmitted alleles, and for case II the true transmitted allele is
incorrectly regarded as non—transmission. Since GATK ignores the
transmission information in trios, we applied PolyMutt (Li et al.,
2012), an algorithm that jointly models the trios for genotype
calling, to refine the genotypes and re—evaluated the bias on the new
calls. Clearly the bias was much reduced, for both functional
and all variants, although the bias was not completely eliminated
(the transmission ratio is still slightly <0.5, Table 5 ). As a result of
joint modeling of trios, the Mendelian error was essentially elimi-
nated in PolyMutt calls compared with GATK calls (Table 5 ).

We used PolyMutt calls for gene—based gTDT analysis given the
much reduced transmission bias. We focused on functional variants
that were predicted to be deleterious by various bioinformatics tools
provided in ANNOVAR output; these prediction algorithms include
Polyphen-2, SIFT, LRT, MutationTaster, MutationAssessor and
CADD. We used MAF <0.02 for AD and DOM and MAF <0.05
for CH models (CH and wCH). Furthermore, for each variant site
trios were included in the analysis if the minimum depth of the three
family members was >5. Q—Q plots showed that there was no infla-
tion of type I error in all gTDT tests (Supplementary Fig. S3). For
this dataset, the P—values of AD—DOM were consistent and we re—
ported results based on AD; similarly for compound heterozygotes
we reported results based on CH. No genes achieve exome—wide sig—
nificance, and the smallest P—value is 5 X 10_4 for gene KCNV2
under AD. The top five genes for AD with over—transmission are
KCNV2, SPEF2, ENAM, BCAM and DRC1. However, none of
these top genes overlap with the 124 known high confidence autism
genes reported in a previous study (Pinto et al., 2014). We further
assessed the expression levels of these five genes in different brain re-
gions spanning 15 developmental periods based on the data from
BrainSpan Atlas (Kang et al., 2011). None of the five genes are ex—
pressed in brain across developmental periods (Fig. 1A), indicating
that these are unlikely to be autism—associated genes.

For CH, the most significant gene is STAU2 with a P—value of
0.0027, and the top five genes include STAU2, ZFHX4, PDZD2,
ACIN1 and ANKRD16. We expected to observe less significant
P—values for CH models due to the rarity of compound

heterozygotes for rare variants. However, when examining the gene
expression in the BrainSpan Atlas data (Kang et al., 2011), we
observed that all these genes were expressed in different regions
across developmental periods (Fig. 1B). Moreover, STAU2, ZFHX4
and PDZD2 showed varying expression patterns in the prenatal
stages, which are important for the development of autism (Willsey
et al., 2013). Literature search revealed the involvement of these
genes in brain functions or psychiatric disorders. For example,
STAU2, which belongs to a family of RNA-binding proteins, is
highly enriched in the brain and plays key roles in early differenti-
ation of neurons and in the synaptic plasticity of mature neurons
(Heraud-Farlow and Kiebler, 2014); ZFHX4 is found to be deleted
in the 8q21.11 microdeletion syndrome associated with intellectual
disability (Palomares et al., 2011).

4 Discussion

Identifying genes harboring rare variants associated with human
complex traits is of great interest. On the other hand, it is also intrin-
sically challenging, owing to the dramatically reduced power as well
as the difficulty to account for rare variant population stratification/
admixture. The framework we described in this study tackles this
problem by aggregating rare variants in a group and uses a haplo—
type—based TDT to control for population stratification/admixture.
Compared with existing methods, our framework is better able to
deal with complex genetic models. Given the ubiquity of allelic het—
erogeneity in disease etiology, it is natural to assume that there exist
complex interactions between causal variants. Our work provides a
framework that enables the exploration of such complex models.
In addition, customized weighting schemes can be readily provided
to gTDT so that effective weights, such as functional prediction
scores (Price et al., 2010) or the weights based on the clever use of
controls (Jiang et al., 2014), can be incorporated to various models
in gTDT to take advantage of specialized weights. If the focus is on
rare variants (e.g. MAF < 0.05), our results show that it is adequate
to use phasing by transmission implemented in gTDT. We believe
that this is the most commonly employed strategy so that gTDT is
able to handle the majority of situations. For variants with MAF
>0.1 we recommend using LD—based methods to phase genotypes
before gTDT analysis.

Haplotype—based TDT frameworks for multiple makers have
been proposed previously based on genotyping data on common
variants (Abad—Grau et al., 2013; Clayton, 1999; Zhao et al., 2000).
These methods usually have multiple degrees of freedom without
collapsing effects, and often need to deal with uncertainties in haplo—
type phasing. A notable method employed a strategy to classify
haplotypes into two groups to reduce degrees of freedom
(Abad—Grau et al., 2013). In this method the collapsing of haplo-
types is based on observed over— or under—transmission in the data in-
stead of prior knowledge. On the other hand, our method is
designed for rare variants uncovered via sequencing, with almost
certain haplotype reconstruction and biological meaningful collaps—
ing of rare variants. As a result, it offers ﬂexibility to test different
genetic models based on prior knowledge with reduced degree of
freedom to increase power.

In gTDT it is natural to use gene as the analysis unit. It is equally
applicable to groups of rare variants from multiple genes. A key fac—
tor to consider for gTDT analysis of pathways or gene sets is that re—
combination events can occur between genes. To check the validity
of gTDT for such analyses, we also simulated two groups of variants
that had recombination rate of 0.5 between them. We carried out
the gTDT assuming no recombination and obtained correct type I
error estimates (data not shown), indicating that gTDT could be
applied to groups of variants beyond the gene level.

In gTDT we implemented several common genetic models.
In reality the underlying genetic model is generally unknown, and is
likely to vary from gene to gene. Some researches may be interested
in how to combine the results from different models. If the relative
probability of each model is known a priori, the association signal
can be obtained by taking a meaningful average of individual tests,
e.g. through Bayesian model averaging approaches (Stephens and
Balding, 2009). Since our method is not Bayesian, and it is hardly
possible to have a meaningful estimate of the priors, model averag—
ing is not readily applicable here. An alternative is to carry out asso—
ciation tests of genetic models of interest and use the maximum
statistic as the association signal for each gene; in this setup the sig—
nificance need to be correctly calculated either through permutation
or other approximation approaches (Gonzalez et al., 2008). If the
primary interest is to test one of the models, e.g. the CH model,
model averaging or selection approaches are not necessary.

We observed an under—transmission bias in genotype calls
and this bias can lead to not only inflation of type I error but also
decrease in the power to detect risk alleles. This bias can be more
dramatic when sequencing depth is low, as observed in other data
we have analyzed, and may be inﬂuenced by other factors during
complex sequencing and analysis steps. This further exacerbates
the challenges for rare variant association studies. Correcting
the bias may not be straightforward, as rare variants in the same
gene or group will likely to have differential bias patterns due to
different depth of coverage, allele frequencies, among other factors.
Although PolyMutt can dramatically reduce the bias by modeling
allele transmission in trios, the bias does not seem to be com—
pletely eliminated. It may require further effort to develop
sophisticated methods in order to efficiently correct the bias for
gTDT tests.

Application of gTDT to small—scale exome sequencing data
on autism trios did not reveal promising genes under additive mod—
els. This may simply reflect the inadequate power of the this study
to detect weak signals of rare variants. On the other hand, our ana-
lyses showed that CH models had potential to identify associated
genes harboring interacting rare risk alleles. Studies with larger
sample sizes are needed to elucidate the etiology of complex traits
contributed by rare variants. Our framework is ﬂexible to incorpor-
ate other complex interacting models to identify rare variant
associations.

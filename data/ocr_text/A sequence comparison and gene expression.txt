ABSTRACT

Summary: We present a plug-in for Pathway Tools, an integrated
systems biology software to create, maintain and query Pathway/
Genome Databases. Fully integrated into the graphical user interface
and menu, this plug-in extends the application’s functionality by the
ability to create multiple sequence alignments, systematically annotate
insertion sequence (IS) elements and analyse their activity by
cross-species comparison tools. Microarray probes can be automat-
ically mapped to target genes, and expression data obtained with
these arrays can be transformed into input formats needed to visualize
them in the various omics viewers of Pathway Tools. The plug-in API
itself allows developers to integrate their own functions into the
Pathway Tools menu.

Availability: Binaries are freely available for non-commercial users at
http://genome.tugraz.at/PGDBToolbox/ and can be used on all plat-
forms supported by Pathway Tools. A user guide is freely available at:

1. INTRODUCTION

Pathway/Genome Databases (PGDBs) are highly integrated
model organism databases that store genome sequence and an-
notation as well as a reconstruction of the metabolic and regula-
tory network. Well-curated PGDBs like EcoCyc (Keseler et al.,
2011) are an important tool to gain better understanding of cel-
lular component interaction and how changes in an organism’s
network affect its phenotype. PGDBs are usually maintained,
queried and visualized using the Pathway Tools software de-
veloped by the Bioinformatics Research Group at SRI
International (Karp et al., 2010), which has extensive capabilities
in the ﬁelds of operon and pathway prediction, analysis of biolo-
gical networks, species comparison and analysis of omics datasets.
The importance of PGDBs to biochemical research is reﬂected by
an ever growing number of PGDB collections and software tools
maintaining and analysing such databases (Caspi et al., 2010; Le
Fevre et al., 2007; Vellozo et al., 2011; Vieira et al., 2011).

Our toolbox aims at further extending the capabilities of
PGDB-based systems biology research by means of plug-ins

that can be added to the Pathway Tools software to address
special aspects of analytical workﬂows not covered by the core
software itself. Multiple sequence alignments of orthologous
genes across related organisms, including a freely deﬁned 5’ se-
quence region, allow detecting differences in gene, promoter or
regulator binding regions that affect gene function or expression.
Systematic annotation of insertion sequence (IS) elements, com-
bined with cross-species comparison functions, provides insight
into transposon activity and gene clusters affected thereof. Tools
for mapping microarray probes to target genomes and visualiz-
ing expression proﬁles in the genome browser are provided; these
tools also create input ﬁles for data visualization in Pathway
Tools’ various overview diagrams.

2. IMPLEMENTATION

Implemented in LISP, our toolbox can be loaded directly into
the Pathway Tools application at startup. An individual LISP
package separates toolbox functions from Pathway Tools in-
ternal functions. Toolbox components are grouped into modules
that address a speciﬁc task and can be used widely independent
from each other; a core module provides common functions and
services. All toolbox functions enumerated in the following sec-
tions are fully integrated into the Pathway Tools graphical user
interface (GUI) and accessible by a plug-in menu placed in the
application’s main menu.

2.1 Menu plug-in API

Although Pathway Tools provides an extensive LISP API that
allows integration of high-level script or console-based database
query and modiﬁcation routines, it currently does not provide a
plug-in API for its GUI. As a consequence, dynamic integration
of user interface commands and menus at runtime requires con-
siderable programming effort and in—depth knowledge of the in-
ternal program structure.

As part of this toolbox, we introduce an easy-to-use plug-in API
that allows integration of additional submenus and functions to
the application’s menu by a single function call. Besides its use
within the toolbox modules, this API can also be used by other
developers to add their speciﬁc functions to the plug-in menu.

2.2 Multiple sequence alignment of orthologs

Pathway Tools offers a multi-genome browser that allows align-
ing genome annotations based on links between orthologous
genes and is very useful for detection of large-scale differences

between organisms. Analysis of point mutations—especially in
the 5’ region of genes, where they might account for signiﬁcant
changes in expression levels OK u et al., 2009)—requires repeated
gene browsing, sequence export into FASTA ﬁles and alignment
using external tools, as this system lacks a built-in sequence
alignment feature. Therefore, we introduced an expanded
CLUSTAL W alignment (Larkin et al., 2007) to compare ortho-
logs of a selected gene at DNA sequence level. Organisms that
should be included in the alignment are selected in the same way
as for display in the multi-genome browser. A user-deﬁned
number of base pairs in 5’ direction of the gene can be included
into the alignment. The initial CLUSTAL alignment is processed
to include a header describing all aligned genes; additional
5’ sequences are highlighted by capitalization, and accurate pos-
ition information relative to the start of the gene is provided. The
ﬁnal result is presented in a dialog window from where it can be
saved as text ﬁle.

2.3 IS element annotation and analysis

IS elements are a major cause of genomic modiﬁcations that may
change a cell’s phenotype dramatically even during relatively
short-termed experiments under non-mutagenic conditions, as re-
cently demonstrated (Gaffé et al., 2011). They are short mobile
genetic elements encoding only functions involved in their mobil-
ity. A dedicated database, IS Finder (Siguier et al., 2006), gives
detailed information about individual ISs and their taxonomy. To
analyse IS abundance and activity, we integrated a systematic IS
annotation as well as suitable cross-species comparison tools.

The IS taxonomy tree of families, groups and types is placed
within the ‘Paralogous Gene Groups’ class of each PGDB. A
menu link to the root of this tree, combined with Pathway
Tools’ generic class tree navigation, allows easy browsing of
the IS taxonomy. As IS types behave like ordinary paralogous
gene groups, they proﬁt from all display and browsing options
provided for such groups, e.g. clickable links from IS types to
speciﬁc transposase genes and vice versa or location maps of all
genes of a certain type.

IS element annotation is facilitated by a system of dialog win-
dows that provides selection of deﬁned IS types as well as easy
creation of new taxonomy entries. When IS element annotation
is complete in all strains of interest, and orthologous genes are
linked to each other across all PGDBs, a species comparison
function creates tables of all IS element loci in each organism,
including information about adjacent genes; for each other or-
ganism, the orthologous IS element locus (if present) and the
percentage of sequence identity in the 5000 bp up- and down-
stream region of the IS element locus are reported. A summary
table lists all groups of orthologous IS element loci and thereby
allows rapid detection of shared as well as singleton loci.

2.3 Mapping of microarray probes and gene
expression data

Pathway Tools’ omics and pathway viewers offer many ways to
visualize gene expression in genomic, metabolomic and regula-
tory context. Efﬁcient use of these features implies accurate as-
signment of probes to PGDB genes, but using gene names
provided in array design ﬁles often leads to unsatisfactory results
(see Supplementary Material). We therefore introduce tools to
map probes to PGDB genomes by probe sequences and facilitate
preprocessing of gene expression data before visualization.

Microarray probes can be imported from tab-delimited text
ﬁles (e. g. GAL or ADF ﬁles) using a generic parser that prompts
the user to select proper probe ID and sequence columns. Probes
are mapped to target genomes/PGDBs by BLAST (Altschul
et al., 1997), followed by extraction of strong hits. Mapping re-
sults are stored in the PGDBs directory in GF F 2 format, which
allows displaying probe target annotation as additional track in
Pathway Tools’ genome browser. A tabular text ﬁle is created,
containing probe IDs, their target gene IDs and names as well as
the percent alignment identity, which facilitates the identiﬁcation
of imperfect or cross-talking matches.

To map expression data to the genome, tab-delimited data ﬁles
are merged with probe-target-mappings mentioned above. A
conﬁguration ﬁle deﬁnes how expression data are organized
into different tracks; time series, dye swap, clusters and optional
selection/highlighting of targets on either strand are supported.
Results are stored in two formats: GFF 2 to be visualized in the
genome browser, and tab-delimited text ﬁles that link expression
levels to PGDB-internal gene IDs for visualization in Pathway
Tools’ cellular and pathway overview diagrams.

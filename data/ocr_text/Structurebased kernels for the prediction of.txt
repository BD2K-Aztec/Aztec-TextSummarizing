ABSTRACT

Motivation: Enzyme catalysis is involved in numerous biological
processes and the disruption of enzymatic activity has been
implicated in human disease. Despite this, various aspects of
catalytic reactions are not completely understood, such as the
mechanics of reaction chemistry and the geometry of catalytic
residues within active sites. As a result, the computational prediction
of catalytic residues has the potential to identify novel catalytic
pockets, aid in the design of more efficient enzymes and also predict
the molecular basis of disease.

Results: We propose a new kernel-based algorithm for the
prediction of catalytic residues based on protein sequence, structure
and evolutionary information. The method relies upon explicit
modeling of similarity between residue-centered neighborhoods in
protein structures. We present evidence that this algorithm evaluates
favorably against established approaches, and also provides insights
into the relative importance of the geometry, physicochemical
properties and evolutionary conservation of catalytic residue activity.
The new algorithm was used to identify known mutations associated
with inherited disease whose molecular mechanism might be
predicted to operate specifically though the loss or gain of catalytic
residues. It should, therefore, provide a viable approach to identifying
the molecular basis of disease in which the loss or gain of function is
not caused solely by the disruption of protein stability. Our analysis
suggests that both mechanisms are actively involved in human
inherited disease.

1 INTRODUCTION

Enzymes are critically important macromolecules that accelerate
chemical reactions with high efﬁciency and rate enhancement
(Wolfenden and Snider, 2001). Driven by accumulating structural
and functional data as well as by increasing computational power,

various general mechanisms to account for the molecular basis
of enzyme catalysis have been proposed (Benkovic and Hammes—
Schiffer, 2003; Garcia—Viloca et al., 2004). Despite this, many
enzymes have still not been functionally annotated and many aspects
of enzyme catalysis remain unclear, including the precise details of
reaction chemistry or the geometry of the active sites (Benkovic
et al., 2008; Gutteridge and Thornton, 2005). Thus, computational
methods for the identiﬁcation of active sites and their catalytic
residues have the potential to identify novel catalytic pockets, aid
the design of more efﬁcient enzymes and in some instances predict
the molecular basis of disease.

Catalytic residues are typically deﬁned as amino acid residues
directly involved in the chemistry of catalysis (Bartlett et al., 2002;
Zvelebil and Sternberg, 1988). Hence, those residues involved in
substrate binding and protein stability, or simply supporting the
geometry of the active site are not regarded as catalytic residues
sensu stricto, despite being Vital for catalytic function. Aided by
the growing number of annotated enzymes (Porter et al., 2004),
the signatures of catalytic sites have been extensively studied,
yielding new insights into protein structure—to—function principles
(Gutteridge and Thornton, 2005). Catalytic residues are known to
be enriched in polar residues and depleted in hydrophobic residues,
but most are not directly exposed to water (83%), resulting in below—
average relative accessible surface areas and B—factors (Bartlett
et al., 2002). Catalytic residues have also been highly conserved
over evolutionary time, both structurally and sequence—wise (Bartlett
et al., 2002; Youn et al., 2007). As a result, their disruption is
expected to result in greatly reduced or complete loss of catalytic
activity.

Various computational methods have been proposed to facilitate
the task of predicting catalytic residues from protein structure.
The earliest published work employed spherical neighborhoods
around catalytic residues to deﬁne structural neighborhoods, and
used conservation of both sequence and structure to investigate
the properties of catalytic residues (Zvelebil and Sternberg,
1988). Although this study was only based on the structures of
17 proteins (36 catalytic residues), its conclusions were supported
by subsequent work. Indeed, to this end, other groups have
exploited the increasing number of annotated catalytic residues and
more advanced computational techniques (Alterovitz et al., 2009;
Gutteridge et al., 2003; Ondrechen et al., 2001; Ota et al., 2003;
Petrova and Wu, 2006; Sankararaman et al., 2010; Tang et al.,
2008; Tong et al., 2008, 2009; Torrance et al., 2005; Youn et al.,

2007). These methods are all based on vector representations of
various sequence, structural and evolutionary features, from which
a machine learning model is trained.

Catalytic residue prediction is bound up with the broader issue
of residue function prediction from protein structures; therefore, in
principle, other approaches can also be used for this task. Most of
these methods can be categorized into template—based (Wallace et al.,
1996), residue microenvironment—based (Gregory et al., 1993),
or graph—theoretic methods (Grindley et al., 1993). In addition,
structural alignment programs can provide baseline annotation of
catalytic sites. Such methods can readily incorporate the structural
similarity of larger and non— spherical neighborhoods. However, they
may be less sensitive to evolutionary conservation or to changes in
physicochemical properties than the geometry of the sites. Finally,
whole—molecule protein function prediction algorithms (Pazos and
Sternberg, 2004), combined with methods for predicting functional
residues in general (Elcock, 2001), can also be exploited.

From the machine learning perspective, kernel—based methods
have recently gained importance in computational biology, in part
because of their solid theoretical foundations (Schélkopf et al.,
2004). In kernel—based methods, a similarity function is created
between pairs of objects such as amino acid sequences (Leslie
and Kuang, 2004), secondary structure elements (Borgwardt et al.,
2005) or residue neighborhoods (Vacic et al., 2010), and then
used in a supervised learning scenario. Kernel methods can be
advantageous in cases where a relationship between pairs of objects
can be hypothesized to explicitly incorporate prior knowledge into
the similarity function. In contrast, non—kernel—based classiﬁcation
models (e. g. neural networks) typically construct features that are
considered important for the prediction step. These models do not
naturally permit the explicit encoding of prior knowledge such as
pairwise object similarities. Furthermore, kernel—based approaches
can beneﬁt from the large—margin classiﬁcation algorithms such
as support vector machines (SVMs), but can also be used in
combination with simpler methods such as k—nearest neighbors.

In this study, we developed a novel kernel—based approach
for the prediction of catalytic residues, and functional sites in
general. The predictor was extensively evaluated against established
approaches and used to identify instances where the loss or gain of
catalytic residue activity could plausibly represent the molecular
basis of disease. Our results suggest that the loss, and interestingly
also the gain of catalytic residues, may be actively involved in
human—inherited disease.

2 METHODS

For the purposes of this analysis, we have assumed that local residue
environments contain sufﬁcient information to allow the recognition of
catalytic residues and that protein crystal structures provide an adequate
representation of their in vivo counterparts. Our goal has been to construct a
classiﬁcation model that outputs a posterior probability that a given residue
is catalytic.

2.1 Structure-based residue environments

To exploit the information present in the 3D neighborhood of a potential
functional site, we ﬁrst deﬁne a residue environment as a sphere centered
around the Co, atom. The directionality of this structural environment is
determined by transforming the original atomic coordinates from the Protein
Data Bank (PDB) ﬁles into the new coordinates using the positions of three
backbone atoms with Co, as the origin. The z—axis direction is formed from

the vector connecting the amide nitrogen (N) with the carbonyl carbon (C);
the y—axis direction is deﬁned as the cross product of the unit vector with
direction from Co, to C and the unit vector with direction from Co, to N;
ﬁnally, the x—axis is formed as the direction of the cross product between the
y—axis and the z—axis. This residue—based coordinate system is similar to that
proposed by Grossman et al. (1995).

To facilitate similarity calculations, the coordinate system is further
transformed to the spherical coordinates. A point with coordinates (x,y,z)
is represented by a vector (r, (p, 6), where r: y/x2 +y2 +z2, <p=arctan(y/x)
and 6 = arccos(z / r), with (p e [0, 271) and 6 e [0, 71’). In the spherical coordinate
system, each local environment is divided into cells deﬁned by a vector
(A r, Ago, A6). The total number of cells in the residue environment is
n: lr/Arl ~ mat/Ago] ~ lat/ A61 +1, where 1 represents a special cell for the
residue whose structural neighborhood is considered and includes only the
origin of the coordinate system. Note that the cells are of non—uniform volume
since their size progressively increases with distance from the origin. Finally,
a residue is considered to be in a cell if its Co, atom resides within the cell’s
boundaries.

2.2 Structure-based kernel function

The kernel function K (x,y) between two residue neighborhoods, x and y,
represented by the contents of their respective cells, is calculated as

K(xvy):KG(xvy)'KC(xvy)'KE(xvy) 

where KG (x, y) is a geometric kernel, Kc (x, y) is a chemical kernel and
KE(x,y) is an evolutionary kernel between the two neighborhoods. Each of
the kernel functions is deﬁned below and a detailed example of a calculation
for a 2D situation is provided in Figure 1.

Let A be the set of all amino acids. Also, let Cl-(x) EA >< Z+ be a set of
pairs of amino acids and their protein positions in cell C,- of neighborhood x.
To deﬁne geometric similarity between x and y, KG (x, y), we ﬁrst introduce
vector C(x) as

C(x)=(|01(x)|,l02(x)|,~--,ICn(x)l), (2)
where |C,-(x)| represents the number of residues from neighborhood x in cell
Ci. Then, KG (x, y) is computed as an inner product between the two respective
vectors of counts C(x) and C(32) as

KGOW) = (C(96), C(y))- (3)

Calculating chemical similarity between two neighborhoods is more complex
due to the possibility that |C,-(x)| 75 |C,-(y)|. To address this, we ﬁrst construct
a partial matching from the smaller set to the larger set of amino acids and
consequently deﬁne a similarity function using the matched residues only.
More formally, let us consider cell C,- in neighborhoods x and y and let Cg and
CS be the cells with the larger and smaller number of elements, respectively,
with an arbitrary assignment if |C,-(x)| = |C,-(y)|. Let also f :Cs —> Cg be some
1—1 mapping between two non—empty cell contents CS and Cg. Then, we deﬁne
the best mapping fmaX between cell contents CS and Cg as

fmax=argmax Z s(A,B) , (4)
f (A,B)€f

where s(A,B) is a symmetric similarity function that depends upon the
difference in physicochemical properties between residues in A and B, but
ignores their positions. An example of such a function is the BLOSUM62
matrix.

To take advantage of the substitution matrix as a similarity measure
between amino acids, we make the following transformation

s(A,B)7max{s(A,A),s(B,B)}
S/(A,  = e max{s(A,A),s(B,B)} , 

which maintains matrix symmetry and generates a positive semi—deﬁnite
matrix for a number of scoring matrices (e.g. BLOSUM50, BLOSUM62,
BLOSUM80, PAM120 and PAM250). This can be easily veriﬁed by
computing the matrix eigenvalues.

Function Kg(x,y) is a kernel because the inner product matrix is positive
semi—deﬁnite (Scholkopf et al., 2004). Functions Kg: (x, y) and Ké (x, y) belong
to a class of optimal assignment kernels (Frohlich et al., 2005). Such
kernels have shown good performance in practice (Boughorbel et al., 2004;
Frohlich, 2006), but are not positive semi—deﬁnite in the general sense (Vert,
2008). While it is an open question under which precise conditions optimal
assignment kernels will be positive semi—deﬁnite, we note that a symmetric
matrix K can always be transformed into a positive semi—deﬁnite kernel
K/ using the following transformation: K/ <—K—Amin1, where Amin is the
smallest eigenvalue of K, and I is the identity matrix (Frohlich, 2006). In our
experiments, this transformation was unnecessary since Kc and KB, which
are summations of optimal assignment kernels, were always positive semi—
deﬁnite. Under the above—mentioned conditions, K (x,y) deﬁned in ( 1) is a
kernel owing to the fact that the kernel property is closed under addition and

multiplication (Schblkopf et 61]., 2004).

2.3 Datasets

Data from the Catalytic Site Atlas (CSA) v2.2.10 (http : / /www. ebi .
ac . uk; (Porter et al., 2004)) were downloaded but only literature—supported

catalytic residues were included as positive examples. Sites in sequences with
>40% identity were considered to be redundant and were removed using the
ASTRAL40 v1.73 database as a ﬁlter. The negative sites were collected from
PDB chains, where at least one positive site with the same amino acid was
reported. Out of 7125 catalytic residues in CSA, the ﬁnal non—redundant set
used for training comprised 986 catalytic and 112 851 non—catalytic residues.
In total, the dataset contained 314 protein chains associated with 339 families,
248 superfamilies and 189 folds. Note that the family, superfamily and fold
classiﬁcation were deﬁned in terms of protein domains; thus, a multi—domain
chain can be associated with more than one family (superfamin and fold).
Family, superfamin and fold classiﬁcations were based on SCOP (Murzin
et 61]., 1995).

To examine the contribution of inherited disease mutations giving rise to
the gain or loss of catalytic residues, the public version of the Human Gene
Mutation Database (HGMD; ht tp: / /www.hgmd. org) was analyzed
(Stenson et al., 2009). Mutations in HGMD were ﬁrst mapped to PDB
structures in order to obtain their 3D environments. For each mutation site,
a 51 residue long sequence centered around the wild—type amino acid at
the mutation position was aligned against the PDB sequences. Mutation
sites without an exact match were excluded from the further study. An
exact match was required because we intended to analyze the inﬂuence of
single amino acid substitutions. Another set of putatively neutral inherited
polymorphisms was downloaded from the Swiss—Prot database and used
to provide statistical conﬁdence for the prediction of gains and losses of
catalytic residues. Of 31139 missense mutations acquired from HGMD,
7225 were successfully mapped to PDB structures. Similarly, of 29 346
polymorphisms from Swiss—Prot, 1370 were mapped to PDB structures.
Polymorphisms matching HGMD mutations were removed prior to mapping.

2.4 Training and evaluation of classiﬁcation models

For a given set of training examples D={(x,d)}, where de{—1,+1} is
the class label (+1 if catalytic; —1 otherwise), a kernel matrix K can
be calculated by computing all the pairwise similarity functions K (xi,xj).
We used the SVMlig’” package (Joachims, 2002), with a default value for
the capacity parameter C, to train a classiﬁcation model for a given K.
After the calculation of the support vectors by the SVM optimizer, the
prediction score for an unseen example x can be computed as score(x)=
ZiaidiK(x,-,x), where x,- is the i—th support vector and at,- the i—th Lagrange
multiplier calculated during the SVM optimization process. Since SCore(x) e
(—oo,+oo), it is commonly converted into a probability value using a
sigmoid function.

Fig. 2. (A) ROC curves for various structure kernels. (B) ROC curves for the structure kernel compared with FEATURE and GBT. (C) Precision—recall curve
for the structure kernel compared with FEATURE and GBT. The black dotted line represents a uniformly random model. ROC and precision—recall curves
were estimated using a per—chain 10—fold cross—validation on the same dataset.

Predictor evaluation was carried out as a 10—fold cross—validation in four
different scenarios: (i) per chain; (ii) per family; (iii) per superfamily; and
(iv) per fold. Thus, in each of the 10 cross—validation steps, 1/ 10—th of protein
chains (families, superfamilies and folds) were included in the test set, while
the remaining proteins were used for training. The original dataset was
randomly split into 10 non—overlapping partitions based on protein chain,
family, superfamily and fold information for each residue. Thus, all residues
from any single chain (family, superfamin and fold) were either in the
training set or the test set. To obtain stable estimates of classiﬁer performance,
each 10—fold cross—validation was repeated 10 times with different random
partitions and the results were averaged across the 10 runs.

We estimated sensitivity (sn), speciﬁcity (sp), precision (pr) and the
area under the ROC curve (AUC) to characterize the performance of the
classiﬁers. For a given decision threshold, sensitivity (also called recall, rc),
is deﬁned as the fraction of positive examples correctly predicted, speciﬁcity
is deﬁned as the fraction of negative examples correctly predicted, while
precision is the fraction of all positive predictions that were correct.

2.5 Comparative evaluation

Comparative assessment of methods proposed for catalytic residue prediction
is difﬁcult due to prior evaluations on several different datasets using several
different evaluation strategies and metrics. Thus, we decided to test our
model against well—established methods for which the software was either
available or possible for us to implement. This scenario guaranteed training
and testing on the same data, using the same evaluation protocol. We
downloaded FEATURE (Wu et al., 2008) and also implemented the method
by Gutteridge et a]. (2003) using exactly the same features as described by
the authors (we refer to the latter model as the GBT algorithm, based on the
initials of authors’ surnames). However, some other recent methods such as
ResBoost (Alterovitz et al., 2009) and DISCERN (Sankararaman et al., 2010)
could not have been obtained and tested at this time (K. Sjolander, personal
communication). A positive to negative class prior ratio of 1 :6 was used in
training, as proposed previously (Gutteridge et al., 2003).

We note that FEATURE is based solely on residue microenvironments,
constructed from the concentric spheres around each residue of interest. Its
representation includes counts of atom types and their properties, counts
of residue types and their properties, counts of various chemical groups
and secondary structure information. In addition to the various sequence—
and structure—based features, the GBT method also uses evolutionary
information. It includes six types of features: conservation, relative solvent
accessibility, residue depth, cleft information, secondary structure type and
residue type (Gutteridge et al., 2003).

2.6 Prediction of the gain and loss of catalytic residues
We deﬁned the probability of the gain and loss of a catalytic residue for
mutations based on the probabilities that the residue is catalytic in the
wild—type protein (pwt) and the mutant (pm). The probability of loss of a
catalytic residue was calculated as ploss =pwt ' (1 —pmt), while the probability
of gain of a catalytic residue was calculated as pgain =pmt-(l —pwt). This
method assumes that the event of catalysis in the wild—type molecule is
independent of the event in the mutant protein, since the two proteins are
physically different molecules. To control for false positives, we used the
set of putatively neutral polymorphisms, which provide a score distribution
of amino acid substitutions that are unlikely to affect protein function. An
empirical P—value can be calculated from this null distribution and used to
assess the signiﬁcance of scores for the disease—associated mutations. Thus,
scores in the set of disease—associated mutations that were above 95% of the
scores in the putatively neutral set would yield P 5 0.05.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Parameter optimization

The set of cells in the structural neighborhood was deﬁned by four
tunable parameters (r, Ar, Ago and A6), where r was the radius of
the sphere. The cysteine subset, i.e. a set of all neighborhoods
centered around cysteines, was chosen for parameter optimization
because it was a dataset with an approximately average number of
positive examples over all catalytic residues. The best—performing
parameter set was then used on the whole dataset. This approach
signiﬁcantly reduced the time necessary for parameter selection
and the potential for overﬁtting. We performed a grid—like search
by selecting: {(r,Ar,i)|r=6,7,..., 18; Ar=1,2,...,6; i=1,2,3,4}
with Ag0=% and A6=%Ag0. The parameter set with the best
performance accuracy was: r: 12 A, Ar=4A, Agozjr/2 and
A6=Jr/4.

3.2 Performance evaluation

Using the parameters selected above, we used per—chain cross—
validation to evaluate the performance accuracy of the three
kernels individually (KG,KC and KB), as well as of their various
combinations (Fig. 2). As expected, the geometric kernel (AUC:
0.748) was individually inferior to the chemical (AUC=0.774)

and evolutionary kernels (AUC 20.841). A combination of the
geometric and chemical kernels (AU C 20.791) outperformed any
of the two individual components, but was still inferior to the
evolutionary kernel. This is consistent with other studies that
identiﬁed evolutionary conservation as the most important feature
for predicting catalytic residues (Gutteridge et al., 2003; Youn et al.,
2007). Interestingly, the geometric kernel improved the performance
of both chemical (AU C 20.791) and evolutionary kernels (AU C =
0.864). We believe that this is because chemical and evolutionary
kernels do not penalize mismatches in the number of residues in
each cell. The performance of the products of the two kernels
containing KB or all three kernels was very similar, with the
kernel KC-KE (AUC=0.879) slightly outperforming KG-KC-KE
(AUC=0.873). However, in the most important part of the ROC
curve, for false positive rates (fpr) <0.1, there was no difference in
their performance. The area with the low fprs (fpr: 1 —sp) is of
greater interest because of the large imbalance between positive and
negative examples (1 : 114 in the full dataset). Therefore, we used
the product of all three kernels as our ﬁnal model. The performance
accuracy on the entire dataset (AUC=0.873) was very similar to
that without cysteine residues (AUC=0.874) thereby ruling out
overﬁtting due to parameter optimization.

The structure—based kernel was also evaluated against FEATURE
and the GBT method (Fig. 2B and C). In terms of AUC, the structure
kernel outperformed FEATURE by 13.8% and the GBT method by
7.6% (Fig. 2B). However, at the fpr level of 0.05, the structure
kernel had a signiﬁcantly higher sensitivity (sn=0.453) than either
FEATURE (sn=0.209) or GBT (sn=0.340), as shown in Table 1.
It should be noted that since FEATURE does not use evolutionary
information, it should also be compared to the KC ~KG kernel. In
this case, we observed an increase in AUC of 3.1% and an increase
in sensitivity of 44.5% for the fpr of 0.05. Although FEATURE uses
both amino acid and atomic data representation, we believe that the
structure kernel has an increased accuracy due to the use of oriented
structural neighborhoods and the selection of a kernel function.

All methods were also evaluated by exclusion of particular protein
families, superfamilies and folds, as shown in Table 1 (a list of
families, superfamilies and folds on which the structure—based kernel
performed well or poorly is listed in Supplementary Material). In all
experiments, the residues of multidomain proteins were allowed to
be split across training and test sets. However, all residues belonging
to one chain, family, superfamin or fold were still required to be
in either training or test partitions (a stricter experiment that did
not allow for a protein to be split across partitions provided nearly

identical results; data not shown). The results indicate that there is
very little variation between the four different evaluation scenarios,
suggesting that the dataset ﬁltered using ASTRAL40 was sufﬁciently
diverse to prevent the model from overﬁtting. In addition, these
results emphasize that the signatures of catalytic residues are
inherently local, rather than inﬂuenced by families, superfamilies

Youn et al. (2007) using the S—BLEST method.

3.3 Loss and gain of catalytic residue activity in
inherited disease

Catalytic residue predictors were applied in the context of missense
mutations causing inherited disease in an attempt to identify those
mutations responsible for the loss or gain of catalytic residue
activity. The probabilities of loss or gain of catalytic residues
were calculated from the probabilities that the residue is catalytic
in the wild—type molecule (pwt) and the mutant (pmt). Using
the putatively neutral polymorphisms to form the empirical null
distribution (Noble, 2009), two sets of thresholds, corresponding
to 1% and 5% fprs for 191055 and pgain, respectively, were used to
select mutations with relatively conﬁdent predictions of loss/gain
of catalytic residue activity. At the 1% fpr level, we found that
3.5% of disease—associated mutations were predicted to give rise
to a loss of a catalytic residue (P=2.0><10_8; Fisher’s exact
test). At the 5% level, 11.4% of disease mutations had scores
greater than the threshold (P=7.0><10_15). Similarly, for the
gain of catalytic residues, 3.5% (P: 1.0 X 10‘8) and 10.4% (P:
1.1x10‘11) of disease mutations were predicted to be positives
at fpr levels of 1% and 5%, respectively. These results indicate
signiﬁcant differences in the distributions of potential/putative
catalytic site mutations between the neutral polymorphisms and
disease—associated mutations. They also suggest that the gain and
loss of catalytic residues are important mechanisms of inherited
disease. In practical terms, the differences in the right tails of the
score distributions also allow for the estimation of the false discovery
rate (fdr) for a particular decision threshold (Noble, 2009). For
example, at the 1% fpr level, we estimate fdr: 1/3.5=0.286 for
both the loss and gain of catalytic activity. At the 5% fpr level, we
estimate fdr=5/11.4=0.439 for the loss and fdr=5/10.4=0.481
for the gain of catalytic residue activity.

We searched the literature for experimental evidence to support
our predictions. Two such cases are discussed below.

(i) Loss of catalytic residue in coagulation factor IX (F9): F9 is
activated in response to injury of the blood vessel and has a key role
in blood clot formation. F9 itself is a precursor protein that becomes
activated to a serine protease through post—translational cleavage.
Its catalytic triad consists of H221, D269 and S365 residues (Porter
et al., 2004) in activated F9 (Fig. 3A). Mutations in F9 give rise
to the X—linked recessive disorder, hemophilia B. Mutation H221R
has the probability of loss [91055 20.274, which is above the 5% fpr
threshold of 0.255. Due to ASTRAL40 ﬁltering, the triple (H221,
D269 and S365) was not part of our training set.

(ii) Gain of catalytic residue in proprotein convertase
subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9): PCSK9 is a member of the
proteinase K subfamily of subtilases that reduces the number of
LDL receptors (LDLRs) in liver through a hitherto undeﬁned
post—transcriptional mechanism. Lagace et al. (2006) have shown
that puriﬁed PCSK9 added to the medium of HepG2 cells

reduces the number of cell—surface LDLRs in a dose— and time—
dependent manner. This activity was approximately 10—fold greater
for a gain—of—function mutant, PCSK9(D374Y), that causes hyper—
cholesterolemia (Lagace et al., 2006). Our prediction of gain
of catalytic activity pgain for D374Y is 0.262 (greater than the
fpr=0.05 threshold of 0.252). Recently, it was also shown that
D374H was as potent as D374Y in reducing cell—surface LDLR
(Fasano et al., 2009), with our score pgain = 0.261. The authors also
suggested that D129N, R496W and N425S were more potent than
the wild—type protein, but less potent than the D374 mutants; our
predicted pgain scores were 0.229, 0.220 and 0.177, respectively. The
trend indicates that the predicted scores can provide a quantitative
measure of the magnitude of the gain of catalytic function. The
predicted catalytic pocket for PCSK9 is shown in Figure 3B.

4 DISCUSSION

In this work, we introduced a novel kernel method for the
prediction of functional residues in protein structures. The kernel
function is a product of three kernels, each addressing a separate
aspect of protein function: (i) the geometric kernel addresses the
shape similarity; (ii) the chemical kernel addresses the similarity
in physicochemical properties; and (iii) the evolutionary kernel
addresses the evolutionary similarity of conservation patterns
for the residues in two structural neighborhoods. Our approach
was successfully applied to catalytic residue prediction and
was favorably evaluated against two of the leading alternative
approaches, FEATURE and GBT, on the same dataset. We showed
that a construction of oriented structural neighborhoods and
separation of the neighborhood volume into cells provides a good
alternative to such approaches. The use of oriented neighborhoods
was possible due to a very small coefﬁcient of variation (2% in our
dataset) between the bond angles of the backbone atoms.

Owing to its simplicity, the proposed kernel can be extended
to incorporate a wider array of features. It may incorporate an
atomic view of protein structure, or a view that exploits larger

structural elements such as pockets, clefts or secondary structure
elements. The structure of the kernel as a product of three kernel
functions also provided insight into the relative importance of shape,
physicochemical properties, and conservation for the prediction of
catalytic residues. For example, the importance of evolutionary
conservation for catalytic residue prediction was reported previously
(Gutteridge et al., 2003; Youn et al., 2007) and conﬁrmed in this
work. The geometry of the catalytic residue environments evaluated
well as an individual predictor and improved performance of the
models based on evolutionary information and physicochemical
similarities alone, but not together. This suggests that the site
geometry is a distinct feature of catalytic residues, but also
that evolutionary and chemical kernels already contain sufﬁcient
information about the site geometry, since they are also based on the
division of the neighborhood into cells. Thus, for orphan proteins and
proteins whose evolutionary history cannot be conﬁdently inferred,
a combination of the geometric and chemical kernel will still provide
useful performance. Finally, we note that in addition to the product
kernel, we also examined a linear combination of the three kernels
(with equal weights) as well as a kernel where a combined similarity
value was calculated in each cell, before adding them over all cells.
These kernels had slightly lower accuracy than the product kernel.
Despite good performance, the machine learning model proposed
herein is limited by several basic assumptions. For instance, because
the protein structure was considered to be ﬁxed, natural residue
ﬂuctuations and movements among alternative conformations
will not have been allowed for. An additional constraint is the
dependency of protein structures on experimental conditions used
for crystallization, such as pH or temperature (Mohan et al., 2009).
The application of our structure—based kernel on known disease—
associated mutations and putatively neutral polymorphisms serves
to demonstrate that structure—based statistical inference methods
can be successfully used to infer the molecular basis of disease.
We assumed that the structure of the wild—type protein and its
mutant counterpart were identical because the disruption of protein
structure or stability can be addressed using alternative approaches

Structure-based kernels for protein function prediction

 

(Capriotti et al., 2005). However, these approaches cannot address
loss of function events without loss of structure. Wang and Moult
(2001) constructed a rule—based model to infer the molecular cause
of disease from protein structures and later extended it to SVM—
based approaches (Yue and Moult, 2006; Yue et al., 2005). These
models cannot, however, predict functional residues such as catalytic
residues or post—translational modiﬁcations.

It is important to mention that the gain or loss of a catalytic residue
does not necessarily result in the gain or loss of enzymatic activity.
The gain of a catalytic residue is most likely to be observed in
already existing catalytic pockets, where the correct geometry and
favorable chemistry are already present. Hence, the gain of catalytic
residues may change the rate of the catalytic reaction, as discussed
in Section 3.3, but will only very rarely generate catalytic pockets or
enzymes de novo. Similarly, the loss of a catalytic residue does not
necessarily result in the complete loss of enzymatic function. Thus,
when assigning scores for the gain and loss of catalytic residue
activity, we assigned the same priors to these events. Until such
a time as the estimates of the likelihoods of such events can be
precisely ascertained, we believe that this approach is justiﬁed.

We have previously proposed sequence—based methods to infer the
molecular cause of disease, associating disease mutations with the
loss or gain of protein structure and function (Li et al., 2009; Mort
et al., 2010; Radivojac et al., 2008). However, for those proteins
whose structures have been solved or can be accurately modeled,
it is important to improve the statistical inference methods in order
for them to be subsequently utilized in translational research.

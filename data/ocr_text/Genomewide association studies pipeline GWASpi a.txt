ABSTRACT

Motivation: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) based on
single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays are the most widely
used approach to detect loci associated to human traits. Due to the
complexity of the methods and software packages available, each
with its particular format requiring intricate management workflows,
the analysis of GWAS usually confronts scientists with steep learning
curves. Indeed, the wide variety of tools makes the parsing and
manipulation of data the most time consuming and error prone part
of a study. To help resolve these issues, we present GWASpi, a user-
friendly, multiplatform, desktop-able application for the management
and analysis of GWAS data, with a novel approach on database
technologies to leverage the most out of commonly available desktop
hardware. GWASpi aims to be a start-to-finish GWAS management
application, from raw data to results, containing the most common
analysis tools. As a result, GWASpi is easy to use and reduces in up to
two orders of magnitude the time needed to perform the fundamental
steps of a GWAS.

Availability: Freely available on the web at http://www.gwaspi.org.
Implemented in Java, Apache-Derby and NetCDF-3, with all major
operating systems supported.

1 INTRODUCTION

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have come to be the
choice method to detect loci associated with human hereditary traits,
especially diseases (McCarthy et al., 2008). The number of studies
published yearly based on these arrays, has constantly increased
from 3 in 2003 to 384 in 2010 (Yu et al., 2008). In parallel,
reference databases such as HapMap (International and Consortium,
2003), HGDP (Cavalli-sforza, 2005) and the 1000 Genomes Project
(The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2010) are being released
together with an ever-growing range of analytical methods and
software packages.

The most common freely available tools in the ﬁeld, however,
leave it to the user to tackle the jungle of formats and the bulk of raw

data generated by GWAS. Also, learning how to apply the methods
commonly used in GWASs takes signiﬁcant time, extending an
already lengthy and arduous data gathering phase. Thus, the steep
learning curve and the burden of manipulation of the raw data still
makes the access to GWAS a costly endeavour for researchers or
institutions without Bioinformatics personnel. To contribute to solve
this problem and make GWAS an achievable effort for smaller teams,
as well as for the sake of speeding up raw data management in a
consistent, self-contained way for the general researcher community,
we have developed the GWAS Pipeline (GWASpi).

GWASpi has not been designed to replace other well-established
applications (Purcell et al., 2007; Browning and Browning, 2007)
insofar as it does not offer the whole breadth of statistical analysis
methods used in GWAS. Instead, the current version of GWASpi
focuses in case—control studies and offers a solution for teams in
need of concise and quickly obtained results as well as compact,
comprehensive and agile dataset management to complement
existing analysis packages. Some basic quality-control features are
also integrated in GWASpi.

2 APPROACH

Genotype data consists of dense, static information, in the sense that
it is formed by large numbers of genotypes (up to billions) that may
need to be accessed many times but do not change once they have
been ascertained. Subsets of data may be required some times for
separate analysis, but they can be generated easily and quickly as
new, independent datasets that, again, will be static. The NetCDF—3
database technology developed by the University Corporation
for Atmospheric Research (UCAR, http://www2.ucar.edu) and
originally intended for meteorological data storage has proven to
be well suited to this kind of data. On top of this database, Java’s
LinkedHashMap objects are used to retrieve slabs of data in an
ordered list fashion that is searchable by index.

3 METHODS

The efﬁcient storage of genotypes and the posterior retrieval of speciﬁc
subsets of this data is a highly desirable feature for the types of analysis that
are being performed on these datasets. Generally, this type of functionality
is achieved through the use of Relational Databases (RDB) with the help of
SQL language. Nevertheless, RDB technologies have poor scaling properties
for the type of data that composes genome-wide studies. GWASpi makes

use of an embedded J avaDB SQL database for its internal management
as well as for storage of data related to samples (such as their disease
status or geographic origin). However, a crucial feature of GWASpi is
that all genotype data and analysis results, which constitute the bulk of
information in a GWAS, are stored in the Array-oriented Scientiﬁc Data
Format (http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/). Among the existing
implementations of this technology, NetCDF-3 was chosen over others for
the availability of a pure Java implementation of its API, which ensures
cross-platform portability in conjunction with the availability of many high-
performance libraries and tools (J freeChart, Apache Derby). Plots and charts
are handled by the JFreeChart library.

3.1 Common usage

From the point of View of the user, GWASpi is a cross-platform Java
application with integrated tools and features that make the processing
of genotype data more agile and speedy. All the features included in
GWASpi are accessible through a self-teaching, user-friendly, graphical
interface, while the heaviest functionalities can also be launched Via a
command-line interface. The basic usage of GWASpi starts by uploading raw
genotype data exported from a proprietary genotyping platform or standard
formats such as Affymetrix GW6.0, Illumina, PLINK, HapMap, etc. Once
the data has been imported into GWASpi’s database, the standard quality
controls are performed, such as computing the number of missing genotypes
per sample and per SNP, controlling for allelic mismatch and measuring
individual heterozygosity. Next, a genotype frequency count is executed,
which automatically includes a Hardy—Weinberg quality control. Finally,
allelic, genotypic and trend association tests are performed, which generate
tables, reports and their corresponding Manhattan and QQ-plots. A navigator
is available to View the detail of a chromosome area around a given marker,
providing a ﬁrst glimpse of the results of the GWAS. These tables and plots
also link each marker to a selection of reference databases such as Ensembl,
NCBI’s dbSNP and the UCSC genome browser among others.

3.2 Performance

The general application performance parameters benchmark as follows:

RAM usage: GWASpi, as a Java application, gets assigned a ﬁxed size
of the system’s RAM and will never request more than this number. The
application has been designed to work on common desktop or laptop
hardware, typically using 2GB of RAM per 106 SNPs with the number
of samples only being limited by available disk space.

Disk usage: the disk usage increase is proportional to the number of
genotypes, which is equal to the number of SNPs times the sample size.
A genotype matrix 2x106 SNPs and 1000 samples large occupies about
4 GB on disk.

Speed: depending on the format and the number of genotypes, the loading
of a dataset into the GWASpi can take as little as a few minutes (using
GWASpi’s own format) up to hours. As a guideline, a study with 900.000
SNPs and 1000 samples in Affymetrix GW 6.0 format takes a total of about
4h for data load, quality control, Hardy—Weinberg and association tests as
well as for producing the corresponding reports and charts.

4 CONCLUSION

The integration of key pre-processing, quality control, data
management, analysis and reporting steps within a single application
is a distinctive advantage we present in GWASpi. With this
application, we want to offer a solid and scalable platform, even if the
current version focuses in basic case—control designs. New quality-
control and analysis methods as well as new formats are scheduled
to be added into GWASpi. High-quality charts and reports sorted by
relevance are generated automatically, delivering the results Visually
and in tables. Reference databases and chart navigation tools are
integrated in the application providing an agile starting point for
continuing research. For the user, GWASpi simpliﬁes drastically
the cumbersome workﬂows so common in GWAS pipelines and
the many intermediate data ﬁles to be generated, checked and re-
processed. The learning curve for GWASpi’s usage is very accessible
as all available operations are documented in an online contextual
help page.

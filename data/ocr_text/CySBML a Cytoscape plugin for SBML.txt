ABSTRACT

Summary: CySBML is a plugin designed to work with Systems
Biology Markup Language (SBML) in Cytoscape having the following
features: SBML import, support of the SBML layout and qualitative
model packages, navigation in network layouts based on SBML struc-
ture, access to MIRIAM and SBO-based annotations and SBML val-
idation. CySBML includes an importer for BioModels to load SBML
from standard repositories.

Availability and implementation: Freely available for non-commercial
purposes through the Cytoscape plugin manager or for download at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/cysbml/.

1 INTRODUCTION

The Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) is a free and
open interchange format for computer models of biological pro-
cesses (Hucka et al., 2003), which is currently supported by >230
software tools (June 2012). SBML is used to represent models for
a wide range of cell biology, including cell signaling, metabolism
and gene regulation. SBML provides a common standard of
interoperability and exchange allowing several researchers to
work with diverse tools on building, curation, annotation, simu-
lation, analysis and visualization of the same model. Standard
repositories of SBML models such as BioModels (Li et al., 2010)
have been established, providing annotated models on a molecu-
lar level for a wide range of biological questions with access to
their resources through web services (Li et al., 2010). However,
preserving models without the semantic layer of information
needed for an unambiguous identiﬁcation and interpretation of
model components is meaningless (Courtot et al., 2011). To this
end, SBML can be annotated based on Minimum Information
Required for the Annotation of Models (MIRIAM; Laibe and Le
Novere, 2007) and Systems Biology Ontology (SBO; Le Novere,
2006a, b), a set of controlled vocabularies in systems biology.
Cytoscape (Shannon et al., 2003), a widely used open-source
platform for complex network analysis and visualization, cur-
rently provides only rudimentary SBML capabilities; its applica-
tion to SBML models is limited to a subset of SBML. The SBML
document structure is inaccessible for visualization, validation of

SBML files is not possible and neither the information from SBO
or MIRIAM annotation nor SBML packages for layout infor-
mation or qualitative models are supported.

2 DESCRIPTION

We present CySBML, a Cytoscape SBML plugin based on
JSBML (Drager et al., 2011), a free, open-source JavaTM library
for SBML. CySBML supports all versions and levels of SBML,
handles models in SBML and the SBML Qualitative Model
format, includes validation of imported SBML files and provides
a navigation menu based on SBML structure and easy access to
BioModels through web services. All functions of CySBML are
available with one or two clicks through the Cytoscape menu
bar. CySBML was successfully tested with all networks from
the SBML Test Suite (version 2.0.2) and BioModels (release 21).

CySBML utilizes layout information encoded through the
SBML layout extension (Gauges et al., 2006) or alternatively
applies standard layouts based on visual styles optimized for
the bipartite species/reaction model underlying SBML. Species
and reactions are assigned to different visualization classes with
nodes being color coded according to their SBML compartment.

Special focus was put on making annotation information and
the semantic layer accessible to the user and linking these data to
additional web resources (see the methylselenol example in
Fig. 1). CySBML reads RDF-based MIRIAM annotations of
the SBML elements and provides access to the annotated re-
sources within the network visualization. Clicking at links to
online annotation resources and databases opens additional in-
formation in a browser window. In this way, information from a
wide range of resources and databases can be integrated within
the visualization. SBML files from BioModels can be imported
either by their identifiers or searched through name, author, pub-
lication, ChEBI or UniProt ( Fig. 1). Multiple models can be
imported at once for comparative analysis.

Validation of the imported SBML is available through the
menu bar. Validation results can be filtered with respect to the
severity of the errors. SBML annotation, BioModel import and
SBML validation are based on web services and therefore require
an Internet connection.

CySBML integrates seamlessly with other plugins by making
SBML information as Cytoscape node and edge attributes under
names deﬁned in CySBMLConstants accessible. A wide range
of tools works out of the box with CySBML providing add-
itional functionality for SBML models, such as analysis of topo-
logical parameters with NetworkAnalyzer (Assenov et al., 2008),
search of network motifs with NetMatch (Ferro et al., 2007) or

Fig. 1. CySBML interface and features. SBML models can be imported through the BioModels import dialog based on search criteria or BioModel
identifiers. Multiple models can be loaded for comparative analysis and are accessible through the Cytoscape Control Panel. Visualizations for the
imported models are generated in the central Cytoscape area based on information from the SBML layout extension or generic layout algorithms (middle,
KEGG pathway MAP00450, seleno compound metabolism). SBML annotations for network nodes are accessible through the CySBML annotation
window (right). After selection of nodes in the network or the SBML structure (top right), the respective MIRIAM and SBO resources are displayed. In
the example, among others, methylselenol information from KEGG, PUBCHEM, 3DMET and SBO with the corresponding direct links to the web
pages of the original resources. CySBML works out of the box with a multitude of other plugins including analysis of topological parameters with
NetworkAnalyzer (results shown for MAP00450 with visual mapping of node degree to node size, closeness centrality to node color and edge betweenness
to edge size), search for network motifs with NetMatch (top left, Human erythrocyte model glycolysis, linear chain of three nodes) or visualization of ﬂux
distributions (top center, Human erythrocyte model glycolysis, ﬂux balance analysis (FBA) solution for glucose utilization for ATP synthesis)

visualization of ﬂuxes with FluxViz (Konig and Holzhiitter,
2010) (Fig. l).

3 CONCLUSION

CySBML combines SBML, the standard format of models of
biological processes, with Cytoscape, one of the standard plat-
forms for the visualization of biological networks. Cytoscape has
already been used in numerous applications for visualization and
graphical network analyses, whereas the BioModels database
collects and annotates structural and mathematical models in
SBML format that provide insights into the dynamic behavior
of biological networks. CySBML makes it possible to combine
these two important system biological resources in a convenient
and easy-to-use way with special focus on the semantic layer
defining the models. This work opens the door for the develop-
ment of further plugins facilitating the analysis of SBML models
in Cytoscape.

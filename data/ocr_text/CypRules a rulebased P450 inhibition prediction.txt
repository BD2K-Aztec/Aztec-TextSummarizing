Abstract

Summary: Cytochrome P450 (CYPs) are the major enzymes involved in drug metabolism and bio-
activation. Inhibition models were constructed for five of the most popular enzymes from the CYP
superfamily in human liver. The five enzymes chosen for this study, namely CYP1A2, CYP2D6,
CYP2C19, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4, account for 90% of the xenobiotic and drug metabolism in human
body. CYP enzymes can be inhibited or induced by various drugs or chemical compounds. In this
work, a rule-based CYP inhibition prediction online server, Cpru/es, was created based on predict-
ive models generated by the rule-based C5.0 algorithm. Cpru/es can predict and provide struc-
tural rulesets for CYP inhibition for each compound uploaded to the server. Capable of fast execu-
tion performance, it can be used for virtual high-throughput screening (VHTS) of a large set of
testing compounds.

Availability and implementation: Cpru/es is freely accessible at http://cyprules.cmdm.tw/ and
models, descriptor and program files for all compounds are publically available at http://cyprules.

1 Introduction

Among CYP enzymes, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and
CYP3A4 are responsible for 90% of drug oxidation or hydrolysis
(Lynch and Price, 2007). More than 900 drugs have been identified
in causing liver injury (Friedman et al., 2003), making this the most
common reason for a drug to be withdrawn from the market.
Hepatotoxicity and drug-induced liver injury account for a substan-
tial number of compounds failure, highlighting the need for drug
screening assays capable of detecting potential compound toxicity
early in the drug development processes. Previous CYP prediction
models or prediction servers were: either based on a small number
of compounds, screened with non-rule based approaches that could

not suggest structural rules directly contributing to specific P45 0, or
only gives yes/no classification results (Cheng et al., 2011;
Hammann et al., 2009; Mishra et al., 2010; Rostkowski et al.,
2013; Rydberg et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2011; Sushko et al., 2011). In
this study, we chose five of the most common P45 0 enzymes to build
their corresponding inhibition prediction models with >16 000
compounds. The goals are: (i) to first build statistically high per-
formance 2D and 3D QSAR models, utilizing rule-based C5 .0 algo-
rithm (Quinlan, 1993) as a prediction tool to provide structural
information that contribute towards P45 0 inhibition endpoints in a
faster and more direct manner, compared with other machine learn-
ing methods, (ii) and then provide a simple, easy to use, and freely

available web server for quick assessment of compound inhibitions
towards the five major CYP enzymes.

2 Methods

The dataset used in this study was collected from the National
Institutes of Health Chemical Genomics Center (NCGC) cyto-
chrome panel assay’s PubChem BioAssay database (AID1851),
using the quantitative high-throughput screening (qHTS) technique.
This dataset contains 16561 compounds screened over five P450
endpoints, including CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6 and
CYP3A4. Compound structures were pre-processed to remove any
redundant ions and to convert them to 3D structures in preparation
for the following 1D, 2D and 3D molecular descriptor calculations.

Molecular descriptors were calculated for each P450 endpoint,
using three descriptor tools: PubChem 2D Fingerprint (ftp://ftp.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubchem/specifications/pubchem_fingerprints.txt),
PaDEL—Descriptor (Yap, 2011) and Mold2 (Hong et al., 2008).
Different combinations of these descriptor sets were all tested in
our works. For each P450 endpoint, corresponding trial descriptor
set was randomly split into training set and testing set of 7:3 ratio
(Akbani et al., 2004). The best descriptor set was derived from the
model with the highest G-mean, and the detailed results were
shown in supplementary information.

Classification models were constructed using C5.0 algorithm.
Rule-based C5 .0 decision tree generating algorithm is an improved
version of the well-known C4.5 (Quinlan, 1993). C4.5 is an algo-
rithm used to generate a decision tree using the concept of informa-
tion entropy. At each node on the decision tree, C5 .0 chooses an
attribute from the data that most effectively splits its initial set
of samples into subsets enriched in one class or the other. An
important/key feature of C5.0 is its ability to generate classifiers
called ‘rulesets’ which consist of unordered collections of (relatively)
simple if-then rules.

3 Results

The best C5 .0 models for each CYP enzymes, after considering dif-
ferent combination of descriptor sets, are listed in Table 1, with clas-
sification accuracy ranging from 0.73 to 0.90 and G-mean ranging
from 0.74 to 0.88. When compared with the other two freely avail-
able CYP prediction servers, MetaPred and WhichCyp, Cprules
outperformed in most CYP isoforms. (Accuracy values of 0.77,
0.66, 0.68, 0.55 and 0.51 for MetaPred (Mishra et al., 2010), and
0.88, 0.83, 0.85, 0.84 and 0.84 (Rostkowski et al., 2013) for
WhichCyp isoforms 1A2, 2C19, 2C9, 2D6 and 3A4, respectively).
Most importantly, MetaPred and WhichCYP only give yes/no classi-
fication results, but Cprules can further provide detailed structural
information that can be used as guidelines to refine drug candidates.
Because the CYP2D6 dataset is highly imbalanced compared with
other CYP datasets, CYP2D6 inhibitors were the most difficult to
predict in all previous studies. It is worth noting that our reported

4. Web server

4.1 Interface features and implementation

Cprules is a web server built based on the models tested in this
study, to provide a platform for virtually screening compound inhib-
ition at each P45 0 endpoint. The web server not only predicts the in-
hibition of P450 endpoints, it also provides structural rulesets that
contribute towards predicted inhibitions. Users can interpret the
models based on these rules. Consequently, the prediction models
embedded in Cprules may offer some insights on how chemical
structures correlate to P45 0 inhibition. Due to the nature of C5 .0,
which consumes less memory and executes faster than the well-
know precursor C4.5, the web server provides a reliable executing
speed for large data sets based on reasonable ruleset suggestions.
Users can upload 2D or 3D SDF files containing thousands of chem-
ical structures for screening simultaneously.

4.2 Example for inhibition prediction

For each P450 endpoint, Cprules deduced a prediction based on
the best model reported. Figure 1 showed Fluoxetine, a CYP2D6 in-
hibitor, and Ampicillin, a CYP2D6 non-inhibitor, were correctly
predicted, since the compounds’ structural features corresponded to
key descriptors, according to suggested rules. The suggested rules
were listed sequentially with rule numbers in the figure. The rows
containing ‘Rule #’ show the descriptor’s meaning and its condition.
The rows containing ‘Compound rule value’ show the compound’s
actual calculated value for each of the rules. For inhibitor
Fluoxetine, there were five rules related to CYP2D6 inhibitory po-
tency. Within these rules, Fluoxetine was predicted as an inhibitor
because of its benzene ring, low oxygen count, and absence of heter-
oatom-containing rings. For non-inhibitor Ampicillin, there were
five rules as well. Within these rules, Ampicillin was correctly pre-
dicted as a non-inhibitor because of its high oxygen count, carbonyl
groups, amide groups, and absence of ether groups. With these in-
formative rules that were specifically fitted for the five different
CYP isoforms, users may utilize these rules/descriptors as a guideline
for altering any inhibitor into non-inhibitor, or vice versa, by means
of structural modifications.

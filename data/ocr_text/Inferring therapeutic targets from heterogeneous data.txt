ABSTRACT

Motivation: The discovery of therapeutic targets is important for
cancer treatment. Although dozens of targets have been used in
cancer therapies, cancer remains a serious disease with a high mor-
tality rate. Owing to the expansion of cancer-related data, we now
have the opportunity to infer therapeutic targets using computational
biology methods.

Results: Here, we describe a method, termed anticancer activity en-
richment analysis, used to determine genes that could be used as
therapeutic targets. The results show that these genes have high like-
lihoods of being developed into clinical targets (>60%). Combined
with gene expression data, we predicted 50 candidate targets for
lung cancer, of which 19 of the top 20 genes are targeted by approved
drugs or drugs used in clinical trials. A hexokinase family member,
hexokinase domain-containing protein 1 (HKDC1), is the only one of
the top 20 genes that has not been targeted by either an approved
drug or one being used in clinical trials. Further investigations indicate
that HKDC1 is a novel potential therapeutic target for lung cancer.
Conclusion: We developed a protocol to identify potential therapeutic
targets from heterogeneous data. We suggest that HKDC1 is a novel
potential therapeutic target for lung cancer.

1 INTRODUCTION

In the past decade, targeted cancer therapies have improved
cancer treatment (Aggarwal, 2010; Sawyers, 2004). Dozens of
molecular targets have been used in cancer treatment, including
EGFR (Ciardiello and Tortora, 2008) and VEGFR (Tugues
et al., 2011). Although multiple drugs that selectively inhibit
these targets have been developed and are used in cancer treat-
ment, cancer is still a highly challenging disease (Siegel et al.,
2012). Therefore, discovering novel therapeutic targets is still
an important and challenging task for cancer treatment.
Several hallmarks of cancer have been deﬁned and have helped
guide cancer therapy (Hainaut and Plymoth, 2013; Hanahan and
Weinberg, 2011). Of these halhnarks, uncontrolled growth is the
most critical for cancer propagation. Therefore, a cancer

therapeutic target should have the following two characteristics:
(i) the target should be essential for the growth of cancer cells
(Ngo et al., 2006; Sethi et al., 2012; Tiedemann et al., 2012), and
inhibition of the target should directly or indirectly suppress
cancer cell growth; and (ii) disturbing the target should have
minimal side effects in normal cells. It would be ‘perfect’ if the
target was not expressed in normal cells but highly expressed in
cancer cells.

In this study, we used a computational biology method to infer
potential therapeutic targets from heterogeneous data. We ﬁrst
used our previously published method CDRUG (Li and Huang,
2012) to predict anticancer ligands in the CHEMBL database
(Gaulton et al., 2012). CDRUG is a web server (or method)
used to predict whether a chemical compound has anticancer
activity (Li and Huang, 2012). CHEMBL is a manually curated
chemical database of bioactive molecules that includes >9000
genes and >1 million compounds (Gaulton et al., 2012). We
then performed a hypergeometric test, termed anticancer activity
enrichment analysis (ACEA), to determine genes with signiﬁcant
enrichment of anticancer ligands. Further investigation revealed
that these anticancer ligand-enriched genes have high potentials
to become clinical targets.

After overlapping these genes with expression data from lung
cancer tissues, we inferred 50 candidate therapeutic targets for
lung cancer. We further propose that HKDC1, one of these 50
genes, is a novel potential therapeutic target for lung cancer.

2 METHODS

To infer novel therapeutic targets, we ﬁrst collected a large assortment of
datasets. These datasets included ligand—protein interaction data
(CHEMBL version 13) (Gaulton et al., 2012), the NCI-60 G150 data
(Shoemaker, 2006), microarray-based NCI-60 cell line expression data
(Reinhold et al., 2012), RNA-seq-based expression data (Krupp et al.,
2012), RNA-seq-based expression data from lung cancer and adjacent
normal lung cells (Sec 61 al., 2012) and all known anticancer drugs,
including approved drugs and those still in clinical trial, from the
Thomson Reuters IntegritySM database. Detailed information concerning
these datasets can be found in Supplementary Table S1.

Next, we ﬁltered the CHEMBL dataset based on a half maximal in-
hibitory concentration (ICSO) of <10 uM or a Ki< 10 uM and obtained
206173 ligands that belong to 1776 human genes. The anticancer activ-
ities of all the ligands were predicted using CDRUG (Li and Huang,
2012). CDRUG is based on chemical ﬁngerprint similarity and uses a
conﬁdence level (P—value) to predict whether a compound has anticancer
activity. Thus, we predicted 4018 anticancer ligands using the default

(P<0.05) cutoff and 1071 anticancer ligands using the strict (P< 0.01)
CDRUG cutoff.

Then, a novel method, termed ACEA, was developed to measure
whether a gene is essential for the growth of cancer cells. ACEA is
based on the results of the CDRUG analysis (Li and Huang, 2012)
and uses a hypergeometric distribution to perform enrichment analysis.
The P-value of each gene can be calculated using the following equation:

k—l (m N—m)

P=1—Zi)((+3i (1)

l: ’1

Here, N and n are the total number of ligands and the total number of
anticancer ligands in the ﬁltered CHEMBL datasets, respectively; m and
k represent the number of ligands and the number of anticancer ligands in
a gene, respectively. Both 11 and k are calculated using CDRUG.

Two runs of ACEA were performed to obtain a list of anticancer
ligand-enriched genes. The ﬁrst and second ACEA runs were performed
using the default (P<0.05) and the strict (P< 0.01) CDRUG cutoffs,
respectively. For example, in the second ACEA run, N equaled
206 173, and n equaled 1071. When we used ACEA to examine EGFR,
we obtained 3688 ligands that interacted with EGFR, and 114 of these
3688 ligands were predicted to have anticancer activity. Therefore, m and
k were 3688 and 114, respectively. The P-value for EGFR was then
calculated to be 1.3 X 10‘5 1.

Because multiple tests (1776 genes) were performed, the Bonferroni
correction method was used to adjust the P-value determined by ACEA:

p—adj = p X Ng (2)

Here, p is the P-value of ACEA, p_adj is the adjusted P-value of ACEA
and Ng is the number of genes in the ﬁltered CHEMBL datasets. In the
EGFR study, Ng was 1776. Therefore, the second ACEA run had a p_adj
value of 2.2 X 1048. Only genes with p_adj < 0.05 in both the ﬁrst and
second runs were retained. Using this process, we predicted 102 antic-
ancer ligand-enriched genes.

Next, to validate the predicted targets, we separated the known cancer
drug targets within the 1776 CHEMBL genes. We also obtained infor-
mation on all developed anticancer drugs from the Thomson Reuters
IntegritySM database; this included 743 anticancer compounds, of
which 274 have been approved for treatment. The remaining 469 com-
pounds are currently undergoing clinical trials (Supplementary Table S2).
Then, an all-against—all ligand similarity search was performed to map
these drugs to the CHEMBL datasets (Supplementary Table S3). Thus,
we obtained 239 approved cancer drug targets and 425 targets of trial
drugs from the 1776 CHEMBL genes (Supplementary Table S3). These
targets were then used to annotate the predicted targets.

Finally, to infer potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of lung
cancer, the expression proﬁles of 102 genes in lung cancer cells were
gathered from the collected RNA-Seq data (GSE40419, including 87
lung cancers and 77 adjacent normal tissues) (Seo et al., 2012). Of the
102 genes, 50 genes were signiﬁcantly overexpressed in lung cancer. In
this process, genes with an RPKM (reads per kilo bases per million reads)
of <30 were considered silent or expressed at low levels (Mortazavi et al.,
2008). The functional enrichment analysis of these 50 genes was per-
formed using the DAVID server (Huang et al., 2009).

3 RESULTS
3.1 Inferring potential therapeutic targets using ACEA

To infer potential therapeutic targets, we ﬁrst ﬁltered the
CHEMBL datasets and obtained 1776 genes that contain
206173 ligands. Of these 1776 genes, ~l3% (239 of 1776) are
approved cancer drug targets, and 24% (425 of 1776) are tar-
geted by drugs currently in clinical trials (Supplementary Table

S3). Then, we predicted the anticancer activity of the 206173
ligands using our previously published method (CDRUG),
which is based on chemical ﬁngerprint similarity (Li and
Huang, 2012). Finally, the anticancer ligand enrichment
method, ACEA, was developed to determine genes enriched
for anticancer ligands.

After two runs of ACEA, we obtained 102 anticancer ligand-
enriched genes (Supplementary Table S4). Approximately 40%
of these genes (43 of 102) are approved therapeutic targets,
whereas 60% of these genes (67 of 102) are being targeted in
clinical trials (Fig. 1). The percentage of known cancer targets
(approved or clinically used targets) within these 102 genes is
approximately three times the percentage of therapeutic targets
found in the total list (1776 CHEMBL genes). In other words,
the known therapeutic targets are signiﬁcantly enriched in the list
of 102 potential targets (P< 10‘12, hypergeometric test) (Fig. 1).
These results indicated that the anticancer ligand-enriched genes
have high likelihoods of being developed into clinical targets
(>60%). Thus, these 102 genes represent potential therapeutic
targets that should be validated further using other methods.

3.2 Inferring lung cancer therapeutic targets

Different types of cancer usually exhibit different characteristics,
including gene expression proﬁles; therefore, the predicted 102
potential targets should be further ﬁltered for a given cancer
type. Using RNA-seq expression data from lung cancer tissues,
which includes 87 lung cancers and 77 adjacent normal tissues,
we extracted 50 targets that are overexpressed in lung carcinomas
(Supplementary Table S5). These targets are involved in cell
growth or survival-related biological processes (adjusted
P<0.01), including histone deacetylation, oxidation—reduction,
cell division and the electron transport chain. Approximately 40
(19/50) or 60% (30/50) of these genes are targeted by approved
drugs or drugs that are currently being used in clinical trials,
respectively.

Note: Signiﬁcances of overexpression of the lung cancer targets are cataloged as *P-value of 0.05—0.01, **P-value of 0.01—10‘6 or ****P< 10‘6, respectively. The targets that
are not expressed or only expressed at low levels in normal lung cells (RPKM < 3) are shown in bold (underlined). Note: only the adjusted P-values of the second ACEA run

are shown in this table.

In these 50 candidate lung cancer therapeutic targets, we
observed that 19 of the top 20 targets were already targeted by
drugs that have been approved or are in clinical trials (Table 1).
These results indicate that ACEA can precisely predict lung
cancer targets. Notably, HKDC1 is the only one of the top 20
targets that has not been targeted in clinical trials (Table 1). We
also observed eight targets (TUBB3, CDKl, HKDC1, CCNB2,
CCNBl, KIFl 1, TOP2A and HSD17Bl) that are not expressed
or only expressed at low levels in normal lung cells
(RPKM<3.0) (Supplementary Table S5). Except for HKDC1,
all of these genes are targeted by approved drugs or drugs cur-
rently in clinical trials (Supplementary Table S5). These results
suggest that HKDC1 is a novel potential therapeutic target for
lung cancer.

3.3 HKDC1 may be a novel therapeutic target for lung
cancer

To further validate whether HKDC1 could be used to target lung
cancer, we investigated the heterogeneous data related to
HKDC1. Twelve inhibitors of HKDC1 were screened in the
NCI-60 DTP project (Shoemaker, 2006) (Fig. 2A), and 8 of
the 12 inhibitors have GISOs (50% growth inhibition) of
<10 uM (Fig. 2B). All of these inhibitors had GISOs of <30 uM
(Fig. 2B). In addition, HKDC1 is expressed in nearly all the
NCI-60 cell lines (Fig. 2C), assuming that genes with a
GCRMA value >3.32 are considered to be expressed (Siddiqui

et al., 2006). These observations suggest that inhibition of
HKDC1 could result in the suppression of cancer cell growth.

As mentioned earlier, a ‘perfect’ cancer therapeutic target
should not only be essential to cancer growth but also should
not be expressed in normal cells. Thus, we investigated the ex-
pression proﬁles of HKDC1 in normal tissues using data from
RNA-Seq Atlas (Krupp et al., 2012). The results show that
HKDC1 is either not expressed or expressed at low levels in
normal tissues, except for the kidney (RPKM=4.82)
(Fig. 2D). As shown in Figure 2E, HKDC1 is not expressed or
is expressed at low levels in all of the normal lung tissue samples
(77 samples). In contrast, HKDC1 is expressed or highly ex-
pressed (RPKM>3.0) in 60% (52/87) of the lung carcinoma
tissues (Fig. 2E). These results indicate that HKDC1 is a poten-
tial therapeutic target for lung cancer and could be applied to
~60% of lung cancer patients.

4 DISCUSSION

We have developed a computational biology method, ACEA, to
determine potential therapeutic target genes. Further analysis
shows that these genes have high likelihoods of being developed
into clinical targets. Combined with gene expression data, we
predicted 50 candidate targets for the treatment of lung cancer.
Further validation investigations suggest that HKDC1 is a novel
therapeutic target for lung cancer.

HKDC1 encodes the ﬁfth mammalian hexokinase, which
phosphorylates hexoses (W ilson, 2003). Because phosphorylation

is the ﬁrst step in glucose metabolism, hexokinases may play an
important role in regulating energy metabolism and thus regulat-
ing cell growth. Hexokinase type II (HK2) is a well-studied thera-
peutic target (Rempel et al., 1996; Tennant et al., 2010; Wolf
et al., 2011). Figure 3B shows that HK2 is overexpressed in
lung cancer tissues (fold change < l, P=0.03). However, only
HKDC1 showed a dramatic overexpression in cancer tissues
when compared with other hexokinases (fold change >2,
P<10_10) (Fig. 3). This result suggested that HKDC1 might
play an important role in cancer growth that is different from
other hexokinases. Further experimental elucidation of the exact
role of HKDC1 in cancer growth will be important to its devel-
opment as a therapeutic target.

5 CONCLUSION

We developed the novel computational biology method ACEA
to determine which genes are signiﬁcantly enriched for anticancer
ligands. We inferred 50 candidate targets for the treatment of
lung cancer, and we suggest that HKDC1 is a novel potential
therapeutic target for lung cancer.

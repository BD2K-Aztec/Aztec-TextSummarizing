ABSTRACT

Summary: Structure-based approaches complement ligand-based
approaches for lead-discovery and cross-reactivity prediction. We
present to the scientific community a web server for comparing the
surface of a ligand bound site of a protein against a ligand bound site
surface database of 106 796 sites. The web server implements the
property encoded shape distributions (PESD) algorithm for surface
comparison. A typical virtual screen takes 5min to complete. The
output provides a ranked list of sites (by site similarity), hyperlinked
to the corresponding entries in the PDB and PDBeChem databases.
Availability: The server is freely accessible at

1 INTRODUCTION

The numerous genome sequencing projects have ‘revealed that
proteins involved in entirely different biochemical pathways, and
even residing in different tissues and organs, may possess functional
binding pockets with similar shapes and physiochemical properties’
(Kinnings et al., 2009; Weber et al., 2004). The need to compare
protein binding sites and establish structure—function relationships
across protein families has become ever more important. Three
direct outcomes of such an effort are: (i) identiﬁcation of lead
compounds for ‘target—hopping’, (ii) repositioning an existing drug
and (iii) predicting adverse side-effects (Rognan, 2007; Shulman—
Peleg et al., 2004). The discovery of low molecular weight
somatostatin receptor subtype 5 (hSSTSR) antagonists involved use
of astemizole as the lead structure whose original target was H1,
a histamine receptor. H1 has binding site amino acid composition
similar to hSSTSR’s (Martin et al., 2007). The work by Kinnings
et al. (2009) utilizing the SOIPPA algorithm (Xie and Bourne,
2008) is an example of how a catechol- O-methyltransferase inhibitor
used for treating Parkinson’s disease can be repositioned as a lead
compound for treating multi-drug resistant and extensively drug
resistant tuberculosis. Since the compound has an excellent safety
proﬁle, repositioning it to treat drug-resistant tuberculosis offers

signiﬁcant incentives. Side effects are a serious cause for concern
in chemotherapy. A study by Paolini et al. (2006) found that out of
276 122 active compounds, over 96 000 had activity for more than
one target (Kinnings et al., 2009). While ligand-based approaches
can point to such cross-reactivity, they may not be sufﬁcient in cases
where ligands with low apparent similarity bind on to the same target
(Kinnings et al., 2009; Das et al., 2009).

The property encoded shape distributions (PESD) algorithm
(Das et al., 2009) offers high—throughput binding site comparison
that makes it suitable for mining large databases such as the
Protein Data Bank (PDB; Berman et al., 2000). There are several
web-based services and stand-alone programs for comparison of
ligand binding sites in proteins. The SitesBase (Gold and Jackson,
2006) server uses a geometric hashing algorithm on an all—
atom—based representation of the binding site. The SiteEngine
and Multibind (Shulman—Peleg et al., 2004, 2008) servers also
utilize a geometric hashing based search protocol that compares
pseudo-center representations of binding sites. The Catalytic Site
Search server (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton—er/databases/cgi-bin/
CSS/makeEbthml.cgi?ﬁle=f0rm.html) based on the Jess algorithm
(Barker and Thornton, 2003) searches for speciﬁc groups of
residues. PDBSiteScan (Ivanisenko et al., 2004) works on a
reduced representation of atoms (utilizing N, C and Ca) and
implements a combinatorial extension (Shindyalov and Bourne,
1998) algorithm followed by alignment for similarity detection. The
SuMo server (Jambon et al., 2005) matches graphs representing
triplets of functional groups such as unbound hydrogen bond donors
or acceptors, accessible sides of aromatic rings and carboxylate,
primary amide, etc. The FuzCaV program utilizes a generic cavity
ﬁngerprint generated from a labeled Ca representation of the binding
site (Weill and Rognan, 2010).

In Das et al. 2009, we have shown that binding sites can have
similar shape and property distributions on the surface and yet
show low conservation in underlying residue, pseudo-center or atom
composition. In such cases, methods based on residue, pseudo-center
or atom representations may not be able to detect the similarity that
is evident from the surface. The eF—site server (Kinoshita et al.,
2002) can work directly on electrostatic potential-mapped surfaces;
however, it uses a clique-detection—based algorithm that is NP-hard
and slow for high-throughput global similarity searches. The PESD
algorithm implemented in the PESDserV binding site comparison
server presented here overcomes this limitation and quickly returns
a list of globally similar ligand-bound site surfaces from the PDB
in a few minutes.

2 METHODS AND FEATURES

All X-ray crystal structures obtained from the PDB as of October 30, 2009,
were separated into protein and ligand parts. The protein side chains
were protonated with PROPKA (Li et al., 2005) at pH 7.0 and Gauss—
Connolly surfaces were generated in Molecular Operating Environment
(MOE Version 2007.09, Chemical Computing Group, Inc.). For any ligand
(identiﬁed by the HETATM keyword in a PDB ﬁle) not a heme and having
more than ﬁve non-hydrogen atoms, property-mapped Gauss—Connolly
binding site surfaces were generated on the protein. A 4.5-A cutoff distance
from the protein surface to any atom of the ligand was chosen for deﬁning
the binding site surface. The maps were for electrostatic potential and mildly
polar, hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding regions (MOE Active LP maps).
The Amber99 force ﬁeld was used for generating the electrostatic potential
mapped surface. A total of 106 796 binding sites were ﬁnally available for
PESD signature generation. The signatures were generated as described in
Das et al. (2009). A bin width of 1A was employed for the ﬁrst 24 bins
whereas the 25th bin recorded all distances >24 A. 100 000 pairs of points
were sampled from each surface. This formed the ‘pre-computed database’
of binding sites obtained from the entire PDB.

The server requires a user to upload a protein ﬁle and a ligand ﬁle in PDB
format. The binding site surface of the uploaded complex is generated as
described previously. The user has choices of L1 (Manhattan), L2 (Euclidean)
or x2 distances for calculating the similarity between the PESD signatures
of the uploaded site and the signatures in the database. Lower similarity
is indicated by a greater distance. The results are output as a sorted list of
sites, sorting being based on distance option chosen. Links to downloadable
tab-delimited results ﬁle are also provided in the output page. The output
page has seven columns: (i) rank of a site from the pre-computed database;
(ii) PDB accession code of the protein complex; (iii) ligand identiﬁer of
the ligand bound to the site; (iv) PESD distance; (V) ligand chain ID
extracted from the PDB ﬁle; (Vi) the PDB title extracted from the PDB
ﬁle; and (Vii) the Z-score. The Z-scores are computed from the mean and
SD of scores of all 106796 sites compared. The PDB accession codes are
linked to the PDB database and the ligand accession codes are linked to
PDBeChem database (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd—er/msdchem/cgi-bin/cgi.
pl) for convenience. The entire process of screening the pre—computed
database typically takes 5 min.

The true-positive recall rate of the PESD method was determined in
our previous work (Das et al., 2009). In a screening experiment involving
881 queries against corresponding 1256 member test sets, PESD was able to
retrieve a binding site with identical Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers
as the query in Rank 1 in 79.5% of cases.

3 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK

A publicly accessible server for fast web-based global similarity
analysis of surface shape and property distributions of ligand
binding sites in proteins was created. Since the matching is global,
functionally relevant sites differing in size will have a larger
PESD distance than similar-sized sites. Binding sites of signiﬁcantly
different shapes but that bind to the same ligand will also result in

a higher PESD distance compared to similarly shaped sites. We are
presently working on a fragment-based approach, where surfaces
around smaller and less ﬂexible ligand fragments would be generated
and matched to ensure local similarity-based matching of sites to
overcome current limitations.

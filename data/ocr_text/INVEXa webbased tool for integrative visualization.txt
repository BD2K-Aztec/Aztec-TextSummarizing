ABSTRACT

Summary: Gene expression or metabolomics data generated from
clinical settings are often associated with multiple metadata (i.e. diag-
nosis, genotype, gender, etc.). It is of great interest to analyze and to
visualize the data in these contexts. Here, we introduce INVEX—a
novel web-based tool that integrates the server-side capabilities for
data analysis with the browse-based technology for data visualization.
INVEX has two key features: (i) flexible differential expression analysis
for a wide variety of experimental designs; and (ii) interactive visual-
ization within the context of metadata and biological annotations.
INVEX has built-in support for gene/metabolite annotation and a fully
functional heatmap builder.

Availability and implementation: Freely available at http://www.

1 INTRODUCTION

‘Omics’ technologies such as microarrays, next-generation
sequencing and metabolomics are increasingly used in clinical
studies. In many cases, a single dataset will be associated with
multiple clinical parameters (metadata) such as diagnosis, geno-
type, gender and so forth. It is of great interest to analyze and to
visualize the data within these contexts as well as biological an-
notations to enable one to capture dynamic changes that correl-
ate with clinical factors. Linear models have proven to be a
powerful and flexible approach for analysis of gene expression
experiments (Smyth, 2005). However, users need to have a deep
understanding of statistical concepts and R language to use this
approach properly. Heatmaps have proven to be useful in visua-
lizing expression data. Heatmaps coupled with clustering have
become hallmarks for the presentation of gene expression data.
However, most web-based tools provide only static images with
limited support for user interactions. Interactive visualization is
mostly limited to stand-alone tools or Java applet plugin
(Pavlidis and Noble, 2003; Perez-Llamas and Lopez-Bigas,
2011; Reich et al., 2006; Saeed et al., 2003; Saldanha, 2004).
The rapid development of information technology, especially

HTML5 and JavaScript, has presented new opportunities to
overcome this limitation (Miller et al., 2013; Tan et al., 2013).
Here, we present INVEX @tegrative Xisualization ofﬂpression
data)—an intuitive web-based tool that seamlessly integrates
server-side capabilities for data analysis and annotation with
the browse-based technology for data visualization. INVEX
allows researchers to perform flexible data analysis and to visu-
ally explore the results as interactive heatmaps within the context
of associated metadata and biological annotations.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

INVEX is composed of two modules. The server-side module
was implemented using the latest JavaServer Faces 2.0 technol-
ogy. The data analysis was based on R and several packages
from Bioconductor (Gentleman et al., 2004). The client-side
module was developed based on the HTML5 canvas and
JavaScript using the jQuery library (www.jquery.com). INVEX
has been tested using Google Chrome (5.0+), Firefox (3.0+) and
Internet Explorer (9.0+) browsers. The performance of visual-
ization depends on the users’ computer. We recommend access-
ing INVEX from a computer with at least a 15-inch screen and 2
GB memory.

3 APPLICATION EXAMPLE

INVEX provides four example datasets each associated with
multiple metadata—three gene expression datasets (Estrogen,
Sepsis and T imeSeries) and one metabolomics data (Cachexia).
Here, we illustrate the main features of INVEX using the Sepsis
dataset.

3.1 Data upload, annotation and analysis

INVEX accepts an expression data table annotated with various
metadata. The data can be uploaded as a tab-delimited text (.txt)
or in its compressed format (.zip) (see INVEX ‘Help’ page for
detailed instructions). Click the ‘Start’ menu on the home page to
enter the analysis page. To access our test datasets, click the
“Try Examples’ button on the bottom left. The four datasets
are listed with detailed descriptions. The Sepsis data were gener-
ated from a study comparing gene expression changes
from Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation to endo-
toxin tolerance in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells

Fig. 1. Visual data exploration using INVEX. (A) Overview, (B) Focus view, (C) Annotation view and (D) Heatmap builder

(PBMC) from four donors (Pena et al., 2011). There are three
experimental conditions: control, LPS (pro-inﬂammatory) and
LPS_LPS indicating two doses of LPS treatments within a day
(leading to endotoxin tolerance). Thus, there are two types of
metadata: Treatment and Donor. Select the Sepsis data and click
‘Yes’ to upload the ﬁle. For the convenience of testing, INVEX
sets the default parameters for the remaining steps—annotation,
normalization, differential expression and enrichment analysis.
Click ‘Submit’ to proceed in the first two steps. For differential
analysis, INVEX can deal with two- or multiple-group, paired or
block design, time-series, common-control and nested-compari-
sons. Here, it is particularly interesting to compare genes that
respond differently between the two treatments. To perform such
analyses, we choose ‘nested comparisons’ between ‘control vs.
LPS’ and ‘control vs. LPS_LPS’, and select ‘Interactions only’.
The analysis returns 1791 signiﬁcant genes, which is reduced to
251 after setting logz fold change cutoff to 1.0 (2-fold change in
expression). Use ‘Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
(KEGG)’ for enrichment analysis. Finally, click ‘Proceed to visu-
alization’ to enter the visualization page.

3.2 Visual data exploration

A screenshot of the visualization page is shown in Figure 1.
There are four views—Overview, Focus view, Annotation view
and Heatmap builder, with a top toolbar containing menus for
adjusting resolution, colors, clustering and so forth. The
Overview on the left provides a bird’s-eye view of the expression
proﬁle of all signiﬁcant genes (Fig. 1A). By default, genes are
ordered by their adjusted P—values. Select ‘Euclidean distance’ to
cluster genes for pattern discovery. Users can drag to select any
region of interest for detailed inspection in the Focus view. The
Focus view in the center shows the gene expression proﬁles of
current interest with three adjustable resolutions (Fig. 1B). The
metadata, sample IDs and color keys are displayed on the top
and bottom panels, respectively. Double click the ‘Treatment’
metadata row to sort all samples accordingly. On the right
side, the Overall Enriched Themes pane shows enriched path-
ways, P—values and matched gene numbers (Fig. 1C). Double
click the name of the top hit ‘cytokine—cytokine receptor

interaction’ to visualize the expression proﬁles of its 22 genes.
The Enriched Themes in Current Focus bar allows users to iden-
tify enriched functional modules for genes in Focus view.

3.3 Building custom heatmaps

Click the ‘Heatmap builder’ from the top toolbar to activate the
Heatmap builder (Fig. 1D). This pane is a ‘playground’ that
allows users to easily create custom heatmaps to reveal speciﬁc
features. Users can now double click to select a single gene or
drag to select multiple genes from Focus view to Heatmap builder.
Within the builder, users can double click to delete or drag to
reorganize a row. Separators (blank rows) can be added and then
dragged to speciﬁc positions to create visual cluster boundaries.
When all genes of interest are included and organized, users can
edit samples using the ‘Edit samples’ option. Finally, all heat-
maps can be exported as portable network graphics (PNG)
images labeled with metadata, sample IDs and color keys by
using the ‘Download’ function from the top toolbar.

4 CONCLUSIONS

In the context of integrative analysis of expression data from
clinical studies, there are two general scenarios: multiple expres-
sion datasets collected for the same disease or multiple metadata
collected for a single dataset. We have recently developed
INMEX, a tool to support data analysis in the former scenario
(Xia et al., 2013). In this article, we introduce INVEX that has
been designed for the latter scenario. By coupling the conven-
tional server-side functions for data analysis and annotation with
the client-side visualization technologies, INVEX provides a pro-
mising approach for developing efﬁcient bioinformatics tool in
the ‘omics’ era.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: High-throughput gene expression profiling yields
genomic signatures that allow the prediction of clinical conditions
including patient outcome. However, these signatures have
limitations, such as dependency on the training set, and worse, lack
of generalization.

Results: We propose a novel algorithm called lTl (interactome—
transcriptome integration), to extract a genomic signature predicting
distant metastasis in breast cancer by superimposition of large-scale
protein—protein interaction data over a compendium of several gene
expression datasets. Training on two different compendia showed
that the estrogen receptor-specific signatures obtained are more
stable (11—35% stability), can be generalized on independent data
and performs better than previously published methods (53—74%
accuracy).

1 INTRODUCTION

The advent of post—genomic technologies provided the opportunity
to potentially decipher the genomic origin of human diseases,
including cancer. Thus, gene expression analysis using
DNA microarrays allowed improving the classiﬁcation and
prognostication of several types of cancer, including breast cancer
(S¢rlie et al., 2001; van de Vijver et al., 2002). This approach
can also help predict the metastatic recurrence and outcome
(Wang et al., 2005). In breast cancer (BC), the current prognostic
features poorly reﬂect the heterogeneous clinical outcome. The
consequence is that many patients (70—80%) receive unnecessary
adjuvant systemic chemotherapy. Genomic tools could provide an
opportunity to reﬁne prognosis and improve treatment strategy and
lay down foundation of personalized medicine in BC.

Several studies have produced signatures linked to BC distant
metastasis (Sotiriou et al., 2006). The Mammaprint 70—gene

signature (van de Vijver et al., 2002) classiﬁed BC patients in
either good or poor prognosis groups. Wang et al. (2005) reported
a 76 gene signature speciﬁc to estrogen receptor (ER) status (60
genes for ER—l— patients, and 16 for ER—). These two signatures
have an overlap of only three genes, which raised concerns about
their reliability. Michiels et al. (2005) reanalyzed the van de Vijver
dataset and concluded that the signatures obtained in such studies
are unstable and dependent on the patients training set. From a
classiﬁcation standpoint, any gene classiﬁer can be a good one
as long as it performs and generalizes well (Dobbin et al., 2008).
However, from either a scientiﬁc or clinical standpoint, both the
content and stability of signatures are of primary importance, so as
to decipher their molecular basis, to reinforce their robustness and
widespread acceptance of their routine clinical use and eventually
to lead to new therapeutic targets.

Reasons for inherent instability of gene—based signatures have
been previously enumerated (Bertucci et al., 2006; Fan et al., 2006).
Besides experimental variability, variation in patient sampling and
microarray platform bias, other reasons explain the lack of stability
of signatures (Ein—Dor et al., 2006). Reasons best explaining
this instability are (i) the curse of dimensionality and (ii) the
biological nature of gene expression measurements. The curse of
dimensionality is well known of statisticians and is due to the
inherent microarray data topology (too few samples for too many
variables). The biological nature of instability is the following.
Microarrays measure messenger RNA transcript abundance. To
the extent that perturbations linked to a particular phenotype
are reﬂected by changes in messenger RNA transcript levels,
microarrays may be useful for measuring perturbations linked to
a particular phenotype. Genes, however, are not independent but
their products act in concert through protein—protein interaction
(PPI) network(s). Our hypothesis is that phenotypes such as cancer
result from isolated and subtle molecular perturbations (changes
in gene expression and/or mutations for example) in driver genes
that may provoke expression changes of greater amplitude in
downstream genes (Chuang et al., 2007). Statistics for differential
expression detect changes of greater amplitude and reveal only
these downstream genes. Superimposing an interaction network
to expression changes can detect driver genes associated with
more subtle expression changes (Chuang et al., 2007). Factors
cited previously may be more problematic for markers for subtle
changes in differential expression, but we expect their effect to
be attenuated by combination of several datasets. Such genes,

IT! in breast cancer

 

used as biomarkers, have proved to be more robust in predicting
distant metastasis of breast tumors proﬁled on heterogeneous
platforms than genes detected without network information. Several
network—based approaches have been published for microarray
analysis. They include generating condition—dependent networks on
differential expression, where no prior information on interaction
data is used, which somewhat limits the biological relevance of the
results (Gill 61 611., 2010). Co—clustering expression and graph data
were proposed earlier by constructing a novel distance based on
expression and network interactions (Hanisch 61611., 2002). Support
vector machines (SVM) in combination with spectral decomposition
data denoising was proposed for analyzing transcriptional response
in yeast (Rapaport 61 611., 2007). A network—based method was
proposed to detect differentially expressed subnetworks in existing
PPI data by local subnetwork aggregation (Chuang 61 611., 2007).
Using a stricter statistical framework, an SVM variation for directly
using interaction data within a classiﬁer was applied to microarray
classiﬁcation (Zhu 61611., 2009).

These methods addressed the biological issues mentioned before.
However, the data dimensionality issue was still not taken into
account because training and testing were done on a single dataset
with a relatively low number of samples.

We propose here a multidataset re—implementation of the method
proposed by Chuang 61 611. (2007) to integrate analysis of several
gene expression datasets so as to extract subnetworks discriminating
BC distant metastasis. We demonstrate the performance of our
method, called interactome—transcriptome integration (ITI) on a
large compendium of publicly available data. To avoid potential
bias in subnetwork selection, we performed a stratiﬁed 10—fold cross—
validation and combined the obtained networks. Validation was then
done on two independent BC gene expression datasets (Desmedt
61 611., 2008; van de Vijver 61 611., 2002). Using this approach, we
signiﬁcantly increased the classiﬁcation performance as compared
with three previously published signatures while lowering the
dependence of the signature on the training set. Independent
classiﬁcation on two studies by van de Vijver 61 611. (2002) and
Wang 61 611. (2005) achieved 53 and 74% accuracy, respectively.
We detail here our ITI algorithm and report statistical validation,
patient classiﬁcation results, as well as biological validation of the
subnetworks thus deﬁned.

2 METHODS

To detect protein complexes with subtle expression changes, we
superimposed a large—scale PPI map to a compendium of BC expression
proﬁles. The strategy implemented in ITI consists in detecting interactome
subsets (subnetworks) whose expression is signiﬁcantly correlated with
distant metastasis—free survival (DMFS) in several datasets simultaneously.
These subnetworks are then validated subsequently by shufﬂing interaction
data and gene expression data. To train and test the system, six public
datasets were chosen according to the criteria Section 2.2. Four analyses were
performed [two different validation datasets held out for independent testing
for Study 1 (Desmedt’s dataset) and Study 2 (van de Vijver’s dataset) and
separate analysis according to positive or negative ER tumor status] to assess
the impact of training data on the detected subnetworks and to understand
their generalization capability. For each study, a 10—fold cross—validation was
performed by carefully stratifying the training (90% of samples) and test sets.
The aim of stratiﬁcation was to properly balance each of the 10 training sets
to keep the same ER+/ER— and DMFS event proportions in each of the 10
iterations.

2.1 PPI data integration

The following interaction datasets were used: Human Protein Resource
Database release 9 (HPRD Keshava Prasad e1 611., 2009), Molecular
INTeraction database (MINT, Ceol et 611., 2010), INTAct (Aranda et 611.,
2010), Database of Interacting Proteins (DIP, Salwinski e1611., 2004) and the
human interactome generated in 511100 with the Cocite algorithm (Ramani
e1 611., 2005). All data were downloaded on September 8, 2010, and parsed
to remove self—interactions, duplicates and proteins marked as ‘unknown’.
Self—interactions were removed from the ﬁles as they are not quantiﬁed by the
algorithm, and interaction maps were integrated by uniqueness of NCBI gene
ID accession numbers. Annotations were homogenized within datasets for
proper display within the system. Resulting interactions obtained by crossing
all interaction data totaled a number of 70 530 single interactions among a
total of 13 202 proteins.

2.2 Breast cancer compendium

The public datasets (Table 1) were selected and included in a Breast Cancer
Compendium (BCC) on the basis of the following criteria: early BC,
availability of clinical information related to metastasis (event information
and delay between the BC diagnosis, and the relapse or the last follow—up) and
immunohistochemical ER status (ER+, ER—) and absence of post—operative
adjuvant chemotherapy. A total of 930 tumors were retained for analysis from
the initial pool of 1561 tumors through six datasets. Sampling size, platform
types and ER status are detailed in Table 1. DMFS status was censored if
follow—up was <5 years for all datasets.

Raw datasets were downloaded from National Center for Biotechnological
Information (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus repository (Barrett
et 611., 2009) when available, and normalized using the GCRMA
method from Bioconductor (http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/
bioc/html/gcrma.html). The van de Vijver dataset was downloaded as
Supplementary Material from the publication (van de Vijver e1 611., 2002).
Datasets were collapsed from probe expression to gene expression as
described in Reyal etal. (2005). When multiple probesets were available for
a gene, we used the probeset having the highest median signal. Following
this, ‘nx_at’ marked probes were removed. HG—U133A and HG—U133B were
integrated as a virtual combined platform.

2.3 Dataset stratiﬁcation, imbricated 10-fold
cross-validation and independent testing

To detect discriminative subnetwork while avoiding over—ﬁtting, cross—
validation was performed by building training/testing sets while taking into
account the clinical and molecular status of the tumors. Hence, stratiﬁcation
was done to balance ER+/ER— and distant metastasis rate between training
and testing sets, leading to 10 randomly selected training sets. Preservation
of both molecular and clinical status proportions in each dataset allowed
increasing training and testing sets homogeneity and avoided molecular bias.

For each test/train set, subnetworks were detected with the ITI
algorithm (Section 2.4) and validated by gene expression and PPI shufﬂing
(Section 2.5), yielding ﬁve subnetwork lists. The lists were combined into
a single signature (Section 2.6) whose discriminative power was tested on
datasets held apart, as described in Section 2.7.

2.4 Interactome Transcriptome Integration—
Constructing subnetworks

Each couple of training/testing set was searched for discriminative
subnetworks whose average expression was linked to distant metastasis using
the ITI algorithm. The latter is derived from the algorithm of .Chuang etal.
(2007), with the added capability of detecting subnetworks on a compendium
(Fig. 1). ITI was implemented as a pipeline developed with open source
interpreters Perl and Bash and statistical validation was implemented with
Matlab Statistical Toolbox R2010b [The Mathworks (c) Natick, MA, USA].
Subnetwork detection was parallelized and implemented on a Beowulf

Samples

Fig. 1. ITI algorithm. Two data types were fed to the algorithm, the ﬁve
training BC datasets and an interactome. Expression was simultaneously
inspected on several datasets to aggregate discriminative subnetworks, i.e.
discriminative regions in the interactome, as described in Section 2.4.

Cluster to reduce computing costs. Subnetworks visualization was obtained
with the graph layout package GraphViz (AT&T Research, USA).

To detect discriminative subnetworks, correlations between clinical status
and gene expression were computed for each dataset. Then, the interactome
was exhaustively explored for discriminative regions (Fig. 1) by individually
considering each node as a potential seed and aggregate recursively neighbors
on the basis of a score measuring correlation of expression with DMFS status
[Equation (1)]. Neighbors were aggregated until subnetwork score could
not be improved above a certain threshold (improvement score threshold 2
0.03). Then, the following node in interactome was processed. Parallelization
was done by subdividing interactome over available scores. Subnetworks
overlapping by >50% with already detected subnetworks were rejected.
Overlap between subnetworks A and B was calculated by maximum inclusion
score of subnetwork A in B and B in A. Inclusion score of A to B was
measured by counting common genes included in subnetwork A to B and
dividing by the total number of genes contained in subnetwork A. As an
example, with a minimal threshold score of 0.3, analysis led to a total of
2986 subnetworks for Study 1 (ER+) —01 (run where the Desmedt dataset
was held for independent testing, and subnetworks were detected on training
stratiﬁcation 01—see Fig. 2).

Each subnetwork was characterized by a score Ssad [Equation (1)] on each
dataset measuring absolute correlation between the averaged subnetwork
gene expression and the clinical information for this dataset. A global score

Fig. 2. Complete data workﬂow. Interactome is assembled from multiple
sources (Section 2.1). Gene expression datasets forming our BCC assembled
in Section 2.2 are pooled to form a training dataset. Ten groups were then
formed on a 10% leave—out basis (Section 2.3). Subnetworks were detected
on human interactome on each training set using ITI (Section 2.4) and
validated twice by shufﬂing interactions and expression, as described in
Section 2.5. Retained subnetworks were combined (Section 2.6) to train a
SVM (Section 2.7). Final set was then used as a set of markers for classifying
independent data by majority vote on the ﬁve SVM models (Section 2.7).

SS, deﬁned by Equation (2), was computed by averaging individual scores
over all datasets (not used for further computation).

SS is the global score of subnetwork s, computed on the dataset 61 from
the compendium (groups of datasets DS of size NS), corr is the Pearson’s
correlation measured between the averaged gene expression e(g,61) for genes
belonging to s with the binary vector cc containing labels linked to clinical
conditions of patients in datasets 61, weighted appropriately by the square root
of the number 11,) of samples in dataset 61 divided by the maximum number
of samples in all datasets in DS.

 

2.5 Validating subnetworks—ﬁltering

To validate subnetworks statistically, two random distributions of score
were drawn. The ﬁrst random distribution assessed the signiﬁcance of
algorithm that extracts subnetworks. It was obtained by randomly selecting
subnetworks, i.e. by randomly accepting whether a subset of the interactome
is a subnetwork without taking gene expression data into account. The
second distribution assessed statistical signiﬁcance of the biological link

expression PPI. It was obtained by shufﬂing clinical conditions. To keep
random subnetworks comparable to detected subnetworks, their distribution
of size was forced to match that of the selected subnetworks by Gaussian
modeling. Next, the distributions of random subnetwork scores were
modeled by mixture of two Gaussian distributions. Once obtained, these
distributions were used to ﬁx score thresholds independently over all
datasets at signiﬁcance levels of P—values, and ﬁltered statistically signiﬁcant
subnetworks. Shufﬂing random interactions to obtain a random interactome
did not yield subnetworks at reasonable score levels, conﬁrming the
strong link between gene expression levels and protein—protein physical
interaction(s). Finally, we kept only the subnetworks with a score higher
than expected by chance both on subnetwork randomization (P < 1.10‘4 on
two datasets) and shufﬂing of expression (P < 1.10‘4 on two datasets).

2.6 Constructing a common subnetwork signature for
each training set

Using this ﬁlter, 10 subnetworks sets for each training tumor subset were
generated. Next, these sets were combined by examining subnetworks pair
by pair across datasets and combining them if overlap was larger than 50%.
Using this method, clusters of overlapping subnetworks were built. Finally,
a subnetwork list was constructed from the list of subnetwork clusters by
keeping only subnetworks appearing at least twice. For a given cluster, only
the subnetwork with the highest score was kept. Final subnetwork sets size
are detailed in Table 2.

2.7 Tumor classiﬁcation and distant metastasis
prediction of ER+ and ER— tumors on two
independent datasets

The subnetwork list obtained in Section 2.6 was used for independent
classiﬁcation using two different settings, namely Study 1 (in which
Desmedt’s data were held out) and 2 (in which van de Vijver’s dataset
were held out). In each setting, training was performed separately on tumors
from all datasets except the held out dataset, yielding ﬁve SVM models.
Classiﬁcation on the validation sets was done by majority vote (weighted
by sample size for each dataset) on the ﬁve SVM models. A complete
organization chart is presented in Figure 2.

To use subnetworks as unique SVM input variables, gene expression
within a subnetwork was averaged over genes and used as a discriminative
proﬁle for both training and testing. Several SVM models were tested for
increasing number of subnetworks. A ﬁnal subnetwork list was retained by
maximizing accuracy.

Classiﬁcation results (accuracy, true and false positives) are reported in
Section 3, along with a comparison with previously published classiﬁers.

2.8 ITI on-line resource—Gene Ontology category
enrichment

To detect pathways associated with BC distant metastasis, we computed
enrichment of biological process gene ontology in each subnetwork detected
by ITI using the ErmineJ program (Gillis etal., 2010) and the reference list
of Biological Process from Gene Ontology (Ashbumer etal., 2000). ErmineJ
provided corrected P—values for enrichment of ontological terms computed
with hypergeometric distribution. These were systematically computed for
all subnetworks to associate them to known molecular processes deﬁned in
the Gene Ontology.

The resulting data were organized in a dedicated on—line resource
(http://bioinfonnatique.marseille.inserm.fr/iti). This resource describes
subnetworks detected with ITI and gives a thorough description of
the included genes. Subnetworks and gene lists are downloadable for
further processing. Subnetworks P—values calculated according to random
distributions described in Section 2.5 were also included, along with
combined Fisher scores (Hong and Breitling, 2008). Genes were annotated
with direct NCBI EntrezGene links and links to other subnetworks
are provided. To understand expression changes of genes included in
subnetworks, color—coded gene graphs are provided, with correlation
expression/DMFS status superimposed on subnetworks. The correlation
score is provided for all datasets separately.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Establishment of two discriminative subnetworks
sets (ER+ and ER—) from a joined compendium of
930 tumors

Two separate signatures were generated for ER—l— and ER— BC
subtypes for two studies. In Study 1, Desmedt’s data (Desmedt 61611.,
2008) were held out, and in Study 2, van de Vijver’s data (van de
Vijver 61611., 2002) were held out, as described in Section 2.3. Thus,
four sets of subnetworks were assessed (Table 2).

The optimal signature size retained in Table 2 is the one that
maximizes the average accuracy on the 10 training sets for each
analysis. For the Study 1, discriminative subnetworks had an average
score of 0.49 (ER—l—) and 0.54 (ER—) conﬁrming the high correlation
of co—expression and proximity in the PPI network. Signature size
was respectively of 6 (ER—l—) and 165 subnetworks (ER—). For the
Study 2, the ER—l— signature yielded an optimal classiﬁcation score
on independent data for 14 subnetworks, and the ER— signature
for 122 subnetworks. They correspond to lists of 175 (Study 1,
ER+), 2310 (Study 1, ER—), 272 (Study 2, ER+) and 1481
(Study 2, ER—) genes, respectively, many genes being represented
in several subnetworks. These numbers are larger than what is
reported for other signatures. This suggests that we detected a large
panel of genes signiﬁcantly linked to distant metastasis, realistically
reﬂecting both the biological footprint of metastasis and the scale
of perturbations at the gene expression level. Redundancy of genes
within subnetworks may be explained by the high connectivity of
several hubs (for instance TP53), which makes them likely to be
included in several subnetworks.

superiority of subnetwork-based classiﬁcation over
independent gene signatures

The four subnetworks sets deﬁned in Section 2.3 were used to measure ITI classiﬁcation performance, highlighted in bold. The following code was used: N, number of tumors to
classify; TN, true negative; TP, true positive; FP, false positive; TP, true positive; ACC, accuracy; SV, sensitivity; SP, speciﬁcity; FPR, false positive rate. Subnetworks classiﬁcation
accuracy was superior to gene expression classiﬁcation for metastasis prediction for Desmedt’s dataset and around the same level for van de Vijver’s dataset.

the 76—gene ER status—speciﬁc signature (Wang 61 611., 2005) were
tested. Performance was measured on the same tumors (Desmedt and
van de Vijver datasets), separately on ER—l— and ER— tumors. The
classiﬁcation methods from the respective original publications were
used for each signature. For van de Vijver’s signature, distances to
mean centroids from relapse and non—relapse groups are calculated
(van de Vijver 61 611., 2002). For Wang’s signature, a relapse score
is calculated for each patient by a linear combination of gene
expression weighed by standardized Cox’s coefﬁcients (Wang 61611.,
2005). Because the GGI and Mammaprint signatures are probe—
speciﬁc, the tests were done with the probes present in the test
dataset. Results and performance measurements are detailed in
Table 3. They show that ITI generalization performance is vastly
superior to previously published signatures. The GGI classiﬁcation
showed the highest accuracy on the (47—68%) range, the 70 gene
signature on the (41—62%) range and the 76 gene signatures on the
(37—63%) range.

ITI gave a better accuracy as compared with the Wang signature
on Desmedt’s data (ER+); an accuracy of 74% (speciﬁcity of 92%)
was obtained versus an accuracy of 60% (speciﬁcity of 56%) with
the 76 gene signature. ITI gave superior results also on Desmedt’s
ER— tumors with an accuracy of 54% (speciﬁcity of 65%) versus
an accuracy of 38% (speciﬁcity of 41%) for the Wang signature.

This held true for the Mammaprint 70 gene signature, which works
mostly for van de Vijver patients. ITI showed an accuracy of 53%
associated with a speciﬁcity of 90% on van de Vijver’s data (ER—)
and an accuracy of 52% with a speciﬁcity of 65% on van de Vijver’s
ER—l— tumors. This performance is inferior to what was obtained
on Study 1 and may reﬂect a bias toward Affymetrix induced by
the training compendium. The Mammaprint signature had a lower
performance of 41% on ER—l— and of 42% on ER— Desmedt tumors.
Similarly, ITI showed performance superiority over the GGI for
ER— patients. Overall, ITI was able to generalize better with a lower
accuracy bound of 52%.

On a different comparison basis, Chuang 61 611. (2007) achieved
48.8% accuracy on van de Vijver samples with training on Wang
samples and 55.8% reciprocally.

survival rates as deﬁned by (A) ITI, (B) Mammaprint, (C) Wang’s signature
and (D) GGI for the ER+ Desmedt dataset. ITI gave the lowest P—value of
4.89.10‘5 with a log—rank test among all tested signatures.

Speciﬁc contributions of the interaction data or gene expression
data are not quantiﬁed, since they are not easily separable in the
current setting. However, Chuang 61611. (2007) already demonstrated
that an expression approach increased signature robustness, and
several studies showed that gene expression meta analysis also
increased classiﬁcation performance (Fishel 61 611., 2007; Xu 61 611.,
2005).

We performed a survival analysis between good and poor
prognosis groups in Study 1 (ER—l—) (Fig. 3). Log—rank test gave
a P—value of 4.89X10_5, suggesting good separation between
the two groups. This is higher than P—values obtained with other

signatures (Wang signature gave P=4.11><10_3 and GGI gave
P=1.34><10_3).

The Mammaprint signature was not able to separate Desmedt’s
patients in signiﬁcant groups. Even though ITI was not speciﬁcally
designed to obtain good log—rank score, it was able to separate
patients with higher survival and patients with lower survival
expectancy. An alternative could have been to compute subnetwork
score directly on genes log—rank P—values.

3.3 Signatures obtained with ITI show a stability of
11.5—32.8% for different training sets

Wang and van de Vij ver signatures have only three genes in common,
which represent <5% of all the genes in the two signatures. We
compared the two signatures obtained with ITI for ER—l— and ER—
samples with the Desmedt and van de Vijver tumors. A total of
937 genes were found in common between the Desmedt and the
van de Vijver signature for ER— samples, and 46 genes between
the Desmedt and van de Vijver signatures for ER—l— samples. This
represents an overlap of, respectively, 32.8% (ER—) and 11.5%
(ER+). These relatively low values reﬂect the fact that datasets and
platforms are biased. However, this is largely superior to the three
common genes between the Wang and van de Vijver signatures.
This overlap between subnetwork sets could probably be improved
by using a larger training compendium.

3.4 Biology of the discriminative subnetwork set is
meaningful

We examined the enriched annotations from the Gene Ontology
biological process for the subnetworks obtained in Study 1. Table 4
shows several enriched GO terms for both ER—l— and ER— signatures.
Ontology terms found in discriminative subnetworks are linked to
regulatory processes disrupted in cancer (cell cycle, DNA damage
checkpoint) and in metastasis (immune system, cell proliferation,
focal adhesion, cell migration and cytoskeleton organization) in both
ER—l— and ER— tumors.

As an example, we describe here a subnetwork signiﬁcantly
associated with metastasis in Study 1 (ER—) (subnetwork 6693,
represented in Fig. 4). Subnetwork 6693 contained genes with well—
known function in ER— BCs and metastasis, such as the tumor
suppressor gene (TSG) TP53 and the tyrosine kinase receptors
ERBB2 and EGFR.

The subnetwork contained also several cell cycle kinases and
regulators (CDK2, CDKNlA, CDKN2A), NQOl, whose altered
expression has been associated with various forms of cancer.
PIN1 is present in the subnetwork, and was recently found to
promote aggressiveness in BC. Insulin receptor was also present; its
deregulated expression correlates with poor response to anti IGF—FR
therapy in triple negative BC. It also contained several well—known
oncogenes and genes not previously linked to cancer, but which may
be acting as BC driver genes.

4 DISCUSSION

We conceived a network—based algorithm (ITI) to identify prognostic
genomic signatures generalizable over multiple and heterogeneous
microarray datasets. This algorithm works in two steps: ﬁrst it
integrates data from a compendium of BC microarray datasets, and
second it ﬁnds subnetworks, i.e. interacting gene complexes, whose

expression discriminates two conditions of interest. Subnetworks
are ﬁltered by statistical validation.

We applied the ITI algorithm to the particularly important but still
unresolved question of ﬁnding markers for BC distant metastasis for
which a large body of public data is available.

Our approach illustrates the feasibility of integrating gene
expression data compendia (930 BC tumor samples were integrated)
and large—scale PPI data; it represents a potential data mining tool
for gene expression repositories. It features inclusion of prior data
under the form of PPIs and clinical annotations.

We produced two ER status—speciﬁc signatures that were validated
on independent datasets held out from training. Repeating the
experiments for two datasets (Desmedt and van de Vijver)
yielded higher classiﬁcation performance than previously published
classiﬁers in both cases [74% for Desmedt (ER—l—) and 53% for
van de Vijver (ER+)]. Our subnetwork—based signatures reﬂect the
large biological footprint of metastasis and is consequently larger
that previously published signatures. The classiﬁer obtained with
ITI subnetworks was less sensitive to platform bias than previously

published classiﬁers, since performance obtained was similar on
the two training compendia. It also showed high speciﬁcity, which
is critical to make a decision on avoiding unnecessary adjuvant
systemic treatment.

The ITI algorithm is currently extended to incorporate other
data types, including DNA copy number variation data [SNPs,
Comparative Genomic Hybridization arrays (CGH) and DNA
methylation proﬁles]. ITI capability to handle the curse of
dimensionality makes it suitable to detect biomarkers yielded by
deep sequencing analysis. In next versions, PPI interaction type
will also be taken into account at the interactome integration
and subnetwork aggregation steps. Also, classiﬁcation performance
is inherently tied to molecular subtypes and ﬁner subtyping
is necessary to render this technology suitable for clinical
use. A signiﬁcant increase in ER— classiﬁcation was observed
by separating early and lately relapsing patients (data not
shown). Further clinical validation could be envisioned through
a phase—2 clinical trial with customized microarrays for adjuvant
chemotherapy treatment decision making.

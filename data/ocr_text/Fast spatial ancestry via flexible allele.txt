ABSTRACT

Motivation: Unique modeling and computational challenges arise in
locating the geographic origin of individuals based on their genetic
backgrounds. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) vary widely
in informativeness, allele frequencies change non-linearly with geog-
raphy and reliable localization requires evidence to be integrated
across a multitude of SNPs. These problems become even more
acute for individuals of mixed ancestry. It is hardly surprising that
matching genetic models to computational constraints has limited
the development of methods for estimating geographic origins. We
attack these related problems by borrowing ideas from image pro-
cessing and optimization theory. Our proposed model divides the
region of interest into pixels and operates SNP by SNP. We estimate
allele frequencies across the landscape by maximizing a product
of binomial likelihoods penalized by nearest neighbor interactions.
Penalization smooths allele frequency estimates and promotes esti-
mation at pixels with no data. Maximization is accomplished by a
minorize—maximize (MM) algorithm. Once allele frequency surfaces
are available, one can apply Bayes’ rule to compute the posterior
probability that each pixel is the pixel of origin of a given person.
Placement of admixed individuals on the landscape is more compli-
cated and requires estimation of the fractional contribution of each
pixel to a person’s genome. This estimation problem also succumbs
to a penalized MM algorithm.

Results: We applied the model to the Population Reference Sample
(POPRES) data. The model gives better localization for both unmixed
and admixed individuals than existing methods despite using just a
small fraction of the available SNPs. Computing times are comparable
with the best competing software.

Availability and implementation: Software will be freely available as

1 INTRODUCTION

The pertinence of the first law of geography—“Everything is
related to everything else, but near things are more related
than distant things’ (Tobler, l970)—has long been obvious
to population geneticists. For example, in the 1930s, Fisher

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

(Fisher, 1937, 2000) and Kolmogorov (Kohnogorov et al.,
1937) derived and solved a partial differential equation describ-
ing the spatial spread of an advantageous allele. Subsequent gen-
erations of ecologists and evolutionary biologists have studied
the correlations between geography and population structure
from many different perspectives (Guillot et al., 2009; Kimura
and Weiss, 1964; Sokal and Oden, 1978; Wilkins and Wakeley,
2002). During the past decade in particular, geneticists have dis-
covered how to localize the origin of individuals, human and
otherwise, based on their genetic backgrounds (Lao et al.,
2008; Novembre et al., 2008; Wasser et al., 2004; Yang et al.,
2012). Such localization is called spatial assignment.

In an application of principal component analysis (PCA),
Novembre et al. (2008) were able to match the first two principal
components of the genotype matrix of the Population Reference
Sample (POPRES) dataset (Nelson et al., 2008) to the map of
Europe. PCA-based estimation of geographic origins was accur-
ate to within a few hundred kilometers. Though this level of
resolution is impressive, it is natural to wonder if a model-
based method for spatial assignment could perform better and
whether inferences could be reliably made for admixed individ-
uals. This prompted Yang et al. (2012) to introduce spatial struc-
ture analysis (SPA), which, in fact, produces more accurate
spatial assignments than PCA. In estimating allelic frequency
surfaces for each surveyed single-nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP), SPA depends on a simple gradient function describing
how allele frequencies vary with location. In practice, allele fre-
quency surfaces can be bumpy without a dominant cline. The
current article relaxes this restriction and gives more accurate
reconstructions.

2 APPROACH

Our software, OriGen, adapts techniques from image reconstruc-
tion that encourages smoothness without requiring rigidly para-
meterized allele frequency surfaces (Chan and Shen, 2005; Lange,
1990). OriGen is model based and fast. It can infer the geo-
graphic origin of Europeans in the POPRES dataset to much
less than 100 km. Its impressive speed is achieved by focusing
on the most informative markers, sometimes as few as 1% of
all markers, and relying on new minorization—maximization
(MM) algorithms for parameter estimation. In choosing ancestry
informative markers, we replace the information criterion of
Rosenberg et al. (2003) by a homogeneity likelihood ratio test
(LRT) that accommodates substantial differences in sample
s1zes.

3 MATERIALS AND METHODS
3.1 A LRT criterion for SNP selection

The majority of SNPs are uninforrnative for ancestry and geographic
localization. This fact and considerations of computational speed suggest
choosing the most informative SNPs and ignoring the rest. The standard
ancestry informativeness criterion of Rosenberg et al. (2003) makes the
implicit assumption of equal sample sizes. The failure of this assumption
in the POPRES data prompted us to turn to a homogeneity LRT. The
null model of the test for a given SNP postulates that all individuals come
from a single population with a unique allele frequency for the reference
allele; the alternative model postulates different reference allele frequen-
cies at the different sampling sites. Binomial sampling is in force. Suppose
there are S sites with k,- sampled reference alleles and n,- sampled genes

(reference alleles plus alternative alleles) at site i. If k:  1 k, and
n =  11,-, then the LRT statistic reduces to

s 711'

where Q = k/n and 13,- : ki/n, are the maximum likelihood estimates of the
reference allele frequencies under the null and alternative models, respect-
ively. Although small sample sizes at many sites invalidate the chi-square
distribution of the LRT statistic, nothing prevents the statistic from being
used as an index to rank the various SNPs. In our experience, the highest
ranking SNPs are indeed the most informative.

3.2 Allele frequency surface estimation

To estimate the allele frequency surface for a given SNP, we divide the
region of interest, say Europe, into pixels and assign a reference allele
frequency p,- to each pixel i. Extending our previous notation, k,- now
represents the number of sampled reference alleles and n,- the number
of sampled genes from pixel i. For most pixels, k,=n,-=0. Maximizing
the binomial loglikelihood

ni

L(p)=Z |:ln (k

would allow estimation of the reference allele frequencies if all pixels
actually contained sampled people. Because this is not the case and be-
cause we desire smooth estimates across the landscape, we subtract
squared difference penalties from the loglikelihood and maximize the
penalized loglikelihood

Here the tuning constant p determines the extent of smoothing. The non-
negative weights wij incorporate nearest neighbor interactions and scale
the distance between pixel centers. For square pixels we accordingly set
wij = l for pixels sharing a side, wij = l /\/2 for pixels sharing a corner and

wij = 0 for all other pixel pairs. Limiting interactions to the eight pixels
surrounding a pixel obviously reduces computational complexity.

Maximizing the criterion (1) is a formidable optimization problem
because the penalty terms couple the parameters in an awkward fashion
and make it impossible to ﬁnd an exact solution. However, we can invoke
the MM principle (Hunter and Lange, 2004; Lange, 2012; Lange et al.,
2000) and construct a surrogate function that separates the parameters.
A surrogate function g(p | p") for the objective function f(p) must be
tangent to f(p) at the current iterate pn and dominated by it throughout
the common domain of both functions. Formally, these conditions can be
restated as the equality g(pn| p") =f(pn) and the inequality g(p | p") 5 f(p)
for all feasible p. In the maximization step of the MM algorithm, the next
iterate pn+1 is chosen to maximize p H g(p | pn). These deﬁnitions imply
the ascent condition

f(pn+1)2  2   :f(pn)v

which is the secret of the MM principle’s success.
The derivation of our surrogate function depends on the minorization

xy 2 xmym|:l +ln(xi) +ln(l)] (2)

for positive numbers. This minorization reduces to the supporting line
inequality —ln 2 Z l — 2 if we substitute 2 = xy/(xnyn). Application of the
minorization (2) leads to the overall minorization

g<p 1p.) = Lo) — p2 wt- [19.2 +19% — 2pmpnj<1n p.- m pp]
{131'}
of f(p) up to an irrelevant constant. With parameters separated, we can
now solve the stationarity equation

k- n- —k- 1
024—;—2p Wi‘|:pi _pnipn'—:|
Pi 1_Pi  J in

for the MM update pn+1,,- of pi. Multiplying this equation by 17,-(1 — 17,)
yields an equivalent cubic polynomial equation

0 2 Clip? — ail),2 — (711' 1” bm')Pi 1” ki 1” bni

where ai=2pzj7éiwij and bni=2ppnizj7éiw9pnf This cubic is positive

when p,- = 0 and non-positive when p,- = l. The cubic also tends to :l:oo
when p,- tends to :l:oo. Hence, there exists a single root on the interval
(0, 1]. One can extract this root by one of the standard formulas for
solving a cubic equation.

In practice, we add a small increment n, say 0.1, to each sampled k,- and
277 to each sampled 11,-. These pseudocounts, which are similar to Laplace
estimators, stabilize estimation and prevent allele frequencies from con-
verging to 0. For plotting on a log-scale, pseudocounts are mandatory.
One can View pseudocounts as imposing a weak beta prior.

3.3 Localization of unknowns

Once the allele frequency surfaces for the informative SNPs are estimated
by the MM algorithm, one can localize individuals of unknown origin. For
person j with genotype vector xj, Bayes’ rule gives the posterior probability

Pr (xj | j from pixel i) Pr (j from pixel i)
Pr (xj)

 

Pr( j from pixel i | xj) =

that j originates from pixel 1'. Application of this rule depends on ﬁxing a
prior. Two possibilities are convenient. The simpler one is the uniform
prior. A more accurate but less convenient choice is to scale the prior of
a pixel by its population size. For sufﬁciently informative genetic data, the
evidence dominates the prior, and the uniform prior is probably adequate.
The likelihood term

Pr (xj | j from pixel i) = H Pr (xjkl j from pixel i)

factors into a product of likelihoods at the canvassed SNPs under the
assumption of linkage and Hardy—Weinberg equilibrium. The likelihood
Pr (xjkl j from pixel i) at SNP k equals one of the three genotype probabil-
ities pfk, 2p,-k(l — pik) or (1 — pik)2 depending on fs genotype at SNP k. In
practice, it is advisable to work with the logarithms of these quantities to
avoid computer underﬂows. Although the pixel with the highest posterior
probability provides the most likely localization, it is a good idea in practice
to assign an average latitude and longitude and highlight the set of pixels
that contribute substantially to the posterior distribution. For large num-
bers of SNPs, the two methods of localization appear equivalent.

3.4 Admixed individuals

For an ethnically admixed individual, we suggest estimating the fractional
contribution f,- of each pixel i to his/her genome. If we let xk denote the
observed number of reference alleles at SNP k, then the loglikelihood of
the person’s observed genotypes amounts to

L0) = Z {xk 1n (Dc-pt.) + (2 — xi.) 1n [Dc-<1 — pt)“
k i i

subject to the constraints f,- = l and f,- 2 0 for all i. This formulation
of the problem is reminiscent of the ethnic admixture problem if we
identify pixels with ethnic groups and ﬁx allele frequencies rather than
estimate them (Alexander and Lange, 2011; Alexander et al., 2009).
Maximization of L(f) is a typical MM exercise. The key step is to separate
parameters via the minorizations

then standard arguments invoked in maximizing a multinomial likelihood

One can accelerate convergence in estimating f and improve inference
by imposing a penalty that drives to 0 those components f,- with low
explanatory power. As a lasso penalty A: = A is effectively constant,
we suggest the alternative penalty Aziqm), where the penalty function

f f<6

q(f){(3 fig

relies on a positive threshold 6 beyond which no further penalty is
imposed. Because q(f) is non-differentiable, we minorize it by the linear
function f on the domain [0, 6) and by the constant 6 on the domain
[6, 00). We previously used a variant of the current admixture model

and penalty to estimate haplotype frequencies. Rather than repeat the
mathematical derivation of the same penalized MM algorithm here, we
refer the reader to the reference (Ayers and Lange, 2008) for details.
Sufﬁce it to say that with parameters separated, the MM updates require
solving a simple quadratic equation for each component f,. Generic ex-
trapolation techniques for MM and similar algorithms permit conver-
gence acceleration beyond that afforded by our speciﬁc penalization
(Zhou et al., 2011).

Because highly admixed individuals are nearly impossible to charac-
terize fully, we choose 6:  Beyond this value no further penalty is
exerted to eliminate pixels with little evidence of admixture. The total
strength A of the penalty is chosen to minimize the expected geodesic

between the true and estimated centers of a person’s admixture distribu-
tion over many simulated admixed people. Here, dij is the geodesic dis-
tance between the centers of pixels 1' and j. Although somewhat ad hoc,
these choices of 6 and A perform well in practice.

4 RESULTS
4.1 A LRT criterion for SNP selection

The utility of SNPs in identifying ancestral origins varies widely.
The Rosenberg et al. (2003) criterion for ranking SNPs implicitly
assumes equal sample sizes at the different sampling sites. In
practice this assumption is usually violated. As an alternative,
we turned to a LRT statistic for testing homogeneity of allele
frequencies across sites. The LRT statistic compares the best
loglikelihood of the data under the null hypothesis of homogen-
eity to the best loglikelihood of the data under the alternative
hypothesis of complete heterogeneity. Figure 1 allows us to
compare the value of the two different methods of ranking
SNPs. The vertical axis of the ﬁgure represents the average
distance under cross-validation between the true location of
the POPRES individuals and their estimated locations under
OriGen. The horizontal axis represents the number of SNPs
used, with SNPs taken in their order of informativeness.
Although the three curves document the value of ancestry in-
formative SNPs in geographical projection, it is obvious that
the LRT criterion performs better than the information criterion.

4.2 Allele frequency surfaces

Accurate allele frequency surfaces are the primary reason for
OriGen’s superior performance. OriGen surfaces are more
adaptable and less rigidly parameterized. Figure 2 depicts the
estimated allele frequency surfaces of the six most informative
SNPs of the POPRES data. The ﬁgure also plots the maximum
likelihood estimates for each sampled site as a ﬁlled-in circle
at the appropriate location. For comparison, a ﬁgure in the
Supplementary Material depicts the surfaces for the same
SNPs generated by SPA. The ﬁgures demonstrate that OriGen
surfaces match the sampled allele frequencies (represented by the
shading of the circles at each sample location) better than the
SPA surfaces. SPA appears to be too heavily inﬂuenced by out-
lier sites and less adaptable overall.

4.3 Ancestral origin inference

Spatial assignment is the main application of OriGen. To show-
case OriGen’s accuracy, we computed average localization error
by leave-one-out cross-validation. Figure 3 displays the results
for OriGen versus SPA. The lower curve for SPA emphasizes the
beneﬁts of exploiting LRT ordered SNPs. Examination of the
ﬁgure shows that OriGen using 1% of the SNPs achieves better
accuracy than SPA using all of the SNPs. Using 5% of the SNPs,
OriGen is nearly perfect at the pixel level in its localizations.
The same point can be made by comparing OriGen’s results to
the results in Table l of the SPA paper (Yang et al., 2012). Given
the nature of the table, a fair comparison requires using OriGen
to estimate the optimal ancestral origin of each person and then
assigning the person to the closest sampling site as measured by
geodesic distance. Overall, OriGen was more than twice as ac-
curate as PCA and SPA based on just 1% of the data. With 5%
of the data, OriGen maps individuals to sampled pixels with 99%
accuracy. In Figure 4, we show the localization results of OriGen
obtained from cross-validation using only 2% of the SNPs. With
this small amount of data, it can already be seen that OriGen
does well in placing individuals at their true origin.

We also performed some small-scale comparisons with SCAT
(\Nasser et al., 2004). SCAT is computationally demanding and
so more ambitious comparisons were impossible to implement.

Thus, the current version of OriGen delivers good placement
with competitive execution times. The current formulation of
SCAT is unable to handle large numbers of SNPs.

4.4 Estimating proportions of admixed origins

Many individuals have mixed ancestry. PCA tends to localize
individuals with parents of different ethnicities in between their
parents’ regions of origin. SPA has the capacity to localize each
parent separately, but the user must inform the program before-
hand how many different ancestries contribute to a given indi-
vidual. Because this information is often unavailable, it would
be preferable for admixture detection and origin selection to be
more agnostic. OriGen can estimate admixture fractions on a
pixel-by-pixel basis. For example, when applied to a person
with a German parent and an Italian parent, ideally OriGen
should deliver 50% German ancestry, 50% Italian ancestry
and 0% other ancestry. This would make OriGen comparable
with the program ADMIXTURE (Alexander et al., 2009), with
the beneﬁt of using more accurate allele frequencies and covering
small countries with no sampled people at all.

In admixture mode, OriGen exploits the same allele frequency
surfaces that it does in normal mode. However, instead of apply-
ing Bayes’ rule to ﬁnd the posterior probability of origin of each
pixel, it estimates an admixture fraction for each pixel by pena-
lized maximum likelihood estimation. OriGen is not only able to
select the two contributing populations, it is also able to estimate
their proportions well. As Figure 5 illustrates, OriGen takes ad-
mixture estimation a step further by estimating the fractions at
each pixel instead of each population. OriGen allows one to
place individuals at locations with no sampled data. In the
ﬁgure, the true locations of the individual’s grandparents
are highlighted, while OriGen’s results are written as text at

Note: Population of origin was predicted for each individual using leave-one-out cross-validation. Accuracy :l: SD is the proportion of individuals

from each population correctly assigned to their true population. The values listed for OriGen represent either 1% of the data (2 K SNPS) or 5% of
the data (10 K SNPs). To make the values from OriGen comparable with PCA and SPA, the most likely location of each individual was estimated,
and the population closest in distance to that point was chosen as the population of origin. The results for PCA and SPA are taken from Table 1 of

the paper (Yang et al., 2012).

5 DISCUSSION

Motivated by advances in image reconstruction, we have pre-
sented a probability model for the estimation of complex allele
frequency surfaces. Our model captures not only linear clines,
but also multiple local peaks on a landscape. Allele frequency
estimates represent a compromise between locally sampled geno-
types and smoothness. The degree of smoothness is determined
empirically by cross validation. Spatial assignment exploits the
allele frequency surfaces of the most informative SNPs. To no
one’s surprise, the ancestry informative SNPs drive projection. In
ranking SNPs our homogeneity LRT statistic outperforms the
information criterion of Rosenberg et al. (2003), which assumes
equal sample sizes at the sampled sites. In practice, the combin-
ation of a good model with just 1% of the available SNPs give

better geographic localization on the POPRES data than com-
peting models (PCA, SCAT and SPA) with all of the SNPs. Our
computing times are vastly superior to SCAT and competitive
with PCA and SPA.

We have also proposed a model for spatial assignment of
admixed individuals. Our model assigns an admixture coefﬁcient
to each pixel. To avoid over-parameterization, we impose a pen-
alty that enforces parsimony and focuses attention on those
pixels with the greatest explanatory power. Estimation of both
allele frequency surfaces and admixture coefﬁcients beneﬁts from
the MM principle. The MM algorithms generated are simple to
code and automatically enjoy the ascent property. Convergence
can be slow, but standard extrapolation techniques accelerate
convergence dramatically. On the negative side of the balance
sheet, our software OriGen requires more storage per SNP than
SPA, which characterizes an allele frequency surface by just three
parameters. The accuracy of OriGen is also limited by the
number of pixels. For the POPRES dataset, we enclosed
Europe in a square with 70 pixels on a side. Smaller pixels
make little discernible difference in resolution at the expense of
considerably more computation. The heatmaps of posterior
probabilities and admixture coefﬁcients afforded by the pixels
are a decided plus. The ability to exclude infeasible pixels over
oceans is another advantage.

Modeling is an art. The best models combine realism with
computational efﬁciency. The injection of ideas and techniques
from image reconstruction is a major contribution of OriGen.
Dividing regions into pixels and nearest neighbor interactions
offer a logical framework for estimation. MM algorithms are
also ubiquitous in imaging. Our admixture model is directly
motivated by genetic considerations. It cleanly circumvents the
need for specifying which ancestors of an admixed person should

Fig. 5. Admixture coefﬁcients for four simulated Europeans with grandparents from locations highlighted in lighter colors. The numbers listed are the
estimated admixture coefﬁcients at their respective pixels based on 40 K SNPs; values <1 % are omitted. In the top left is a simulated individual with four
grandparents coming from the UK. On his right is an individual with two grandparents from Germany and two from Poland. On the bottom left is an
admixed individual with two grandparents from Portugal and one each from France and Poland. Finally, on the bottom right is an individual whose four

grandparents come from Spain, France, UK and Poland

be taken as geographically localized. Finally, our SNP selection
criterion is probably better suited to identifying ancestry inform-
ative SNPs than abstract information criterion. Readers will
doubtless think of many other ways of improving the current
model. For example, a reviewer suggested that it might be
useful to incorporate standard errors of allele frequency esti-
mates into localization heatmaps. Our preliminary testing
of this plausible idea ﬁnds no improvement, probably because
localization averages across so many SNPs. Science, like prod-
uct design, is usually an iterative process of successive
reﬁnement.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: We propose a novel algorithm to combine multiple
kernels and Laplacians for clustering analysis. The new algorithm
is formulated on a Rayleigh quotient objective function and is
solved as a bi-level alternating minimization procedure. Using the
proposed algorithm, the coefficients of kernels and Laplacians can
be optimized automatically.

Results: Three variants of the algorithm are proposed. The
performance is systematically validated on two real-life data fusion
applications. The proposed Optimized Kernel Laplacian Clustering
(OKLC) algorithms perform significantly better than other methods.
Moreover, the coefficients of kernels and Laplacians optimized by
OKLC show some correlation with the rank of performance of
individual data source. Though in our evaluation the K values are
predefined, in practical studies, the optimal cluster number can be
consistently estimated from the eigenspectrum of the combined
kernel Laplacian matrix.

1 INTRODUCTION

Clustering is a fundamental problem in unsupervised learning and
a number of different algorithms and methods have emerged over
the years. K —means (KM) and spectral clustering are two popular
methods for clustering analysis. K—means is proposed to cluster
attribute—based data into K numbers of clusters with the minimal
distortion (Bishop, 2006; Duda et al., 2001). Another well—known
method, spectral clustering (SC) (Ng et al., 2001; Shi and Malik,
2000), is also widely adopted in many applications. Unlike KM,
SC is speciﬁcally developed for graphs, where the data samples
are represented as vertices connected by non—negatively weighted
undirected edges. The problem of clustering on graphs belongs

Systems Biology, The University of Chicago.

to another paradigm than the algorithms based on the distortion
measure. The goal of graph clustering is to ﬁnd partitions on the
graph such that the edges between different groups have a very
low weight (von Luxburg, 2007). To model this, different objective
functions are adopted and the typical criteria include the RatioCut
(Hagen and Kahng, 1992), the normalized cut (Shi and Malik, 2000)
and many others. To solve these objectives, the discrete constraint
of the clustering indicators is usually relaxed to real values; thus,
the approximated solution of spectral clustering can be obtained
from the eigenspectrum of the graph Laplacian matrix. Many
investigations (e. g. Dhillon et al., 2004) have shown the connection
between KM and SC. Moreover, in practical applications, the
weighted similarity matrix is often used interchangeably as the
kernel matrix in KM or the adjacency matrix in SC.

Recently, a new algorithm, Kernel Laplacian (KL) clustering ,
is proposed to combine a kernel and a Laplacian simultaneously
in clustering analysis (Wang et al., 2009). This method combines
the objectives of KM and SC in a quotient trace maximization
form and solves the problem by eigen—decomposition. KL is shown
to empirically outperform KM and SC on real datasets. This
straightforward idea is useful to solve many practical problems,
especially those pertaining to combine attribute—based data with
interaction—based networks. For example, in web analysis and
scientometrics, the combination of text mining and bibliometrics
has become a standard approach in clustering science or technology
ﬁelds toward the detection of emerging ﬁelds or hot topics (Liu
et al., 2010). In bioinformatics, protein—protein interaction network
and expression data are two of the most important sources used to
reveal the relevance of genes and proteins with complex diseases.
Conventionally, the data are often transformed into similarity
matrices or interaction graphs, then consequently clustered by KM
or SC. In KL, the similarity—based kernel matrix and the interaction—
based Laplacian matrix are combined, which provides a novel
approach to combine heterogeneous data structures in clustering
analysis.

Our preliminary experiments show that when using KL to
combine a single kernel and a single Laplacian, its performance
strongly depends on the quality of the kernel and the Laplacian,
which results in a model selection problem to determine the optimal
settings of the kernel and the Laplacian. To perform model selection
on unlabeled data is non—trivial because it is difﬁcult to evaluate the
models. To tackle the new problem, we propose a novel algorithm to
incorporate multiple kernels and Laplacians in KL clustering. Our
recent work proposes a method to integrate multiple kernel matrices

in kernel k—means clustering (Yu,S. et al. Optimized data fusion for
kernel K —means clustering, submitted for publication). The main
contribution of the present work lies in the additive combination of
multiple kernels and Laplacians; moreover, the coefﬁcients assigned
to the kernels and the Laplacians are optimized automatically.
This article presents the mathematical derivations of the additive
integration form of kernels and Laplacians. The optimization of
coefﬁcients and clustering are achieved via a solution based on
bi—level alternating minimization (Csiszar and Tusnady, 1984). We
validate the proposed algorithm on heterogeneous datasets taken
from two real applications, where the advantage and reliability of the
proposed method are systematically compared and demonstrated.

2 METHODS

2.1 Combine kernel and Laplacian as generalized
Ralyeigh quotient for clustering

We ﬁrst brieﬂy review the KL algorithm proposed by Wang et al. (2009).
All the mathematical symbols used in the article are consistent and their
representations are listed in Supplementary Material 1. Let us denote X
as an attribute dataset and W as a graph afﬁnity matrix, both of them
are representations of the same sets of samples. The objective of the KL
integration to combine X and W for clustering can be deﬁned as

JKL=KJsc+(1—K)JKM, (1)

where JSC and J KM are, respectively, the objectives of SC and KM clustering,
K e [0, l] is a coefﬁcient adjusting the effect of the two objectives. Let us
denote A 6 RN XK as the weighted scalar cluster membership matrix, given by
1 . —>
— if x e C
Act): (T f’ b (2)
0 if xa ¢ Cb,

where m, is the number of data points belonging to cluster Cb and ATA =1 K,
where [K denotes a K ><K identity matrix. Let us denote D as the diagonal
matrix whose (a,a) entry is the sum of the entries of row a in the afﬁnity
matrix W. The normalized Laplacian matrix (von Luxburg, 2007) is given by

i=I—D—%WD—%. (3)
The objective of normalized cut—based SC is formulated as
miniAmize trace (ATLA). (4)

As discussed in the literature (Bishop, 2006; Duda et al., 2001; Hastie et al.,
2009), if the data X has zero sample means, the objective of the KM is
given by

maxiAmize trace(ATXTXA). (5)

We further generalize (5) by applying the feature map ¢(-):IR{—> .7: on X,
then the centered data in .7: is denoted as X ‘1’, given by

X‘I’=[¢(3c1)—ﬂ¢,¢(22)—t1¢,...,¢(2N)—t1‘1’1, (6)

where (15(2)) is the feature map applied on the column vector of the i—th data
point in .73, 11(1) is the global mean in .7: (Girolami, 2002). The inner product
xTx in (5) can be combined using the kernel trick G(§,,,2,)=¢(2,,)T¢(3c,),
where G(', i) is a Mercer kernel. We denote Gc as the centered kernel matrix
as GC=PGP, where P is the centering matrix P=IN —(1/N)IT, G is the
kernel matrix, IN is the N ><N identity matrix, I N is a column vector of N
ones. Without loss of generality, the KM objective in (5) can be equivalently
written as

maxi‘mize trace(ATGcA). (7)

Then the objective of KL integration becomes

miniAmize trace (ATLA) — (1 —IC) trace (ATGCA) (8)

subject to ATAle,
0 SIC 51.

To solve the optimization problem without tuning the ad hoc parameter
K, Wang et al. formulate it as a trace quotient of the two components (Wang
et al., 2009). The trace quotient is then further relaxed as a maximization of
quotient trace, given by

maxi‘mize trace (ATLA)‘1(ATGCA) (9)

subject to ATA 2 1K.

The problem in (9) is a generalized Rayleigh quotient and the optimal solution
A* is obtained in the generalized eigenvalue problem. To maximize this
objective, A* is approximated as the largest K eigenvectors of 11+ Gc, where
LT is the pseudo inverse of L (Wang et al., 2009).

2.2 Combine kernel and Laplacian as additive models
for clustering

As discussed, the original KL algorithm is proposed to optimize the
generalized Rayleigh quotient objective. In this article, we propose an
alternative integration method using a different notation of Laplacian (von
Luxburg, 2007), 1:, given by

i=D—1/2WD—1/2, (10)

where D and W are deﬁned the same as in (3). The objective of spectral
clustering is equivalent to maximizing the term as

maximize trace(ATLA). (11)

Therefore, the objective of the KL integration can be rewritten in an additive
form, given by

maxi‘mize trace{KATLA+(1—K)ATGCA} (12)

subject to ATAzlk,
0 S K g 1,

where A, Gc are deﬁned the same as in (8), K is the free parameter to adjust
the effect of kernel and Laplacian in KL integration. If K is pre—deﬁned, (12)
is a Rayleigh quotient problem and the optimal A* can be obtained from
eigenvalue decomposition, known as the spectral relaxation (Ding and He,
2004). Therefore, to maximize this objective, we denote $2 = KI:+(1 —IC)GC
thus A* is solved as the dominant K eigenvectors of $2.

In Sections 2.1 and 2.2, two different methods are investigated to integrate
a single Laplacian matrix with a single kernel matrix for clustering, where
the main difference is to either optimize the cluster assignment afﬁnity
matrix A as a generalized Rayleigh quotient (ratio model) or as a Rayleigh
quotient (additive model). The main advantage of the ratio—based solution is
to avoid tuning the parameter K. However, since the main contribution of this
article is to optimize the combination of multiple kernels and Laplacians,
the coefﬁcients assigned on each kernel and Laplacian still need to be
optimized. Moreover, the optimization of the additive integration model is
computationally simpler than optimizing the ratio—based model. Therefore, in
the following sections we will focus on extending the additive KL integration
to multiple sources.

2.3 Clustering by multiple kernels and Laplacians: an
additive model solved with bi-level optimization

Let us denote a set of graphs as Hi, ie {1, ..., r}, all having N vertices, and a
set of Laplacians L,- constructed from H,- as (10). Let us also denote a set of

centered kernel matrices as ch, j e {1, ..., s} with N samples. To extend (12)
by incorporating multiple kernels and Laplacians for clustering, we propose
a strategy to learn their optimal—weighted convex linear combinations. The
extended objective function is then given by

maximize le =trace (AT(£+G)A> (13)

where 61, ...,6r and 6r+1, ...,6r+s are, respectively, the optimal coefﬁcients
assigned to the Laplacians and the kernels. G and f. are, respectively, the
combined kernel matrix and the combined Laplacian matrix. The K parameter
in (12) is replaced by the coefﬁcients assigned on each individual data
sources.

To solve Q1, in the ﬁrst phase we maximize JQl with respect to A,
keeping 6 ﬁxed (initialized by random guess). In the second phase, we
maximize JQl with respect to 6, keeping A ﬁxed. The two phases optimize
the same objective and repeat until convergence locally. When 6 is ﬁxed,
denoting SZ=E+C~L Q1 is exactly a Rayleigh quotient problem and the
optimal A* can be solved as a eigenvalue problem of 52. When A is ﬁxed,
the problem reduces to the optimization of the coefﬁcients 6; with given
cluster memberships. In Supplementary Material 2, we show that when the
A is given, Q1 can be formulated as Kernel Fisher Discriminant (KFD)
in the high—dimensional feature space .73. We introduce W: [VT/1, ...,WK], a
projection matrix determining the pairwise discriminating hyperplane. Since
the discriminant analysis is invariant to the magnitude of W, we assume that
WTW=IK, thus Q1 can be equivalently formulated as

maximize jQ2= trace(WTATAW)_1(WTAT(G+L)AW>, (14)

The bi—level optimization to solve Q1 corresponds to two steps to solve Q2.
In the ﬁrst step (clustering), we set W =Ik and optimize A, which is exactly
the additive kernel Laplacian integration as (12); in the second step (KFD),
we ﬁx A and optimize W and  Therefore, the two components optimize
toward the same objective as a Rayleigh quotient in .7: so the iterative
optimization converges to a local optimum. Moreover, in the second step, we
are not interested in the separating hyperplane deﬁned in W, instead, we only
need the optimal coefﬁcients 6; assigned on the Laplacians and the kernels.
It is known that Fisher discriminant analysis is related to the least squares
approach (Duda et al., 2001), and the KFD (Mika et al., 1999) is related

to and can be solved as a least squares support vector machine (LS—SVM),
proposed by (Suykens et al., 2002). The problem of optimizing multiple
kernels for supervised learning (MKL) has been studied by Lanckriet et al.
(2004) and Bach et al. (2004). In our recent work Yu et al. (2010b), we
derive the MKL extension for LSSVM and propose some efﬁcient solutions
to solve the problem. In this article, the KFD problems are formulated as
LSSVM MKL and solved by semi—inﬁnite programming (SIP; Sonnenburg
et al., 2006). The concrete solutions and algorithms are presented in Yu et al.
(2010b).

combined matrix 52 is also ﬁxed; therefore, the optimal A can be found as
the dominant K number of eigenvectors of 52.

In our recent work, we have found that the 8 parameter controls the
sparseness of source coefﬁcients 61,...,6r (Yu et al., 2010b). The issue of
sparseness in MKL is also addressed by Kloft et al. (2009). When 8 is set
to l, the optimized solution is sparse, which assigns dominant values to
only one or two Laplacians (kernels) and zero values to the others. The
sparseness is useful to distinguish relevant sources from a large number of
irrelevant data sources. However, in many applications, there are usually a
small number of sources and most of these data sources are carefully selected
and preprocessed. Thus, they often are directly relevant to the problem. In
these cases, a sparse solution may be too selective to thoroughly combine
the complementary information in the data sources. We may thus expect a
non—sparse integration method which smoothly distributes the coefﬁcients on
multiple kernels and Laplacians and, at the same time, leverages their effects
in the objective optimization. We have proved that when 8 is set to 2, the
KFD step in ( 15) optimizes the Lz—norm of multiple kernels, which yields a
non—sparse solution. If we set 8 to 0, the cluster objective is simpliﬁed as to
averagely combine multiple kernels and Laplacians. In this article, we set 8

to three different vales (0, 1, 2) to, respectively, optimize the sparse, average
and non—sparse coefﬁcients on kernels and Laplacians.

When 8 is set to 1, the KFD problem in Q3 is solved as LSSVM MKL
(Yu et al., 2010b), given by

K K
. . . 1 1 "T—> —’T _1"
minimize §t+igﬁbﬁb—;ﬁbe 1 (16)

where B is the vector of dual variables, t is a dummy variable in optimization,
a is the index of data samples, 19 is the cluster label index of the discriminating
problem in KFD, Yb is the diagonal matrix representing the binary cluster
assignment, the vector on the diagonal of Yb is equivalent to the b—th
column of an afﬁnity matrix Fab using {+1, —1} to discriminate the cluster
assignments, given by

F b_ {+1 ianb >0, a: 1,  b: 1, ...,K
a _

—1 ianb=0, a: 1, ...,N, b: 1, ...,K.
The problem presented in Q4 has an efﬁcient solution based on SIP, which is
presented in Equation forty—one of (Yu et al., 2010b). The optimal coefﬁcients

6,- correspond to the dual variables bounded by the quadratic constraint t:
25:1 ﬁZLl-ﬁb in (16). When 8 is set to 2, the solution to Q3 is given by

where E 2 {25:1 6511161,, ..., 25:1 Egirﬁbﬂ, other variables are deﬁned the
same as (16). The problem Q5 also has an efﬁcient solution presented in
Equation forty—two in our recent work (Yu et al., 2010b). The main difference
between Q4 and Q5 is that Q4 optimizes the L00 norm of multiple kernels,
whereas Q5 optimizes the L2 norm. The optimal coefﬁcients solved by Q4 are
more likely to be sparse; in contrast, the ones obtained by Q5 are non—sparse.
The algorithm to solve Q4 and Q5 is concretely explained in Algorithm 0.2
in Yu et al. (2010b).

Analogously, the coefﬁcients assigned on kernels can also be obtained in
the similar formulation, given by

where most of the variables are deﬁned in the similar way as Q3 in (15). The
main difference is that the Laplacian matrices I: and 1:,- are replaced by the
centered kernel matrices G and ch. The solution of Q6 is exactly the same
as Q3, depending on the 8 value, it can be solved either as Q4 or Q5.

2.3.3 Algorithm: optimized kernel Laplacian clustering As discussed,
the proposed algorithm optimizes A and 6 iteratively to convergence.

The coefﬁcients assigned to the Laplacians and the kernels are optimized
in parallel. Putting all the steps together, the pseudocode of the proposed
optimized kernel Laplacian clustering (OKLC) is presented in Algorithm 2.1.

The iterations in Algorithm 2.1 terminate when the cluster membership
matrix A stops changing. The tolerance value 6 is a constant value as the
stopping rule of OKLC, and in our implementation it is set to 0.05. In
our implementation, the ﬁnal cluster assignment is obtained using the KM
algorithm on A0”). In Algorithm 2.1, we consider the 8 as predeﬁned values.
When 8 is set to 1 or 2, the SIP—LSSVM—MKL function optimizes the
coefﬁcients as the formulation in (16) or (18), respectively. It is also possible
to combine Laplacians and kernels in an average manner. In this article, we
compare all these approaches and implement three different OKLC models.
These three models are denoted as OKLC model 1, OKLC model 2 and
OKLC model 3 which respectively correspond to the objective Q2 in ( 14)
when 8 =1, average combination, 8 = 2.

2.4 Datasets and experimental setup

The proposed OKLC models are validated in two real applications to
combine heterogeneous datasets in clustering analysis. The datasets in the
ﬁrst experiment is taken from the work of multi—view text mining for disease
gene identiﬁcation (Yu et al., 2010a). The datasets contain nine different
gene—by—term text proﬁles indexed by nine controlled vocabularies. The
original disease relevant gene dataset contains 620 genes which are known to
be relevant to 29 diseases. To avoid the effect of imbalanced clusters which
may affect the evaluation, we only keep the diseases that have 11—40 relevant
genes. This results in 14 genetic diseases and 278 genes. Because the present
article is focused on non—overlapping (‘hard’) clustering, we further remove
16 genes which are relevant to multiple diseases. The remaining 262 disease—
relevant genes are clustered into 14 clusters and evaluated biologically by
their disease labels. For each vocabulary—based gene—by—term data source,
we create a kernel matrix using the linear kernel function and the kernel
normalization method proposed by (Shawe—Taylor and Cristianini, 2004),
(Chapter 5). An element in the kernel matrix is then equivalent to the value
of cosine similarity of two vectors (Baeza—Yates and Ribeiro—Neto, 1999).
This kernel is then regarded as the weighted adjacency matrix to create
the Laplacian matrix. In total, nine kernels and nine Laplacian matrices are
combined in clustering.

The datasets in the second experiment are taken from Web of Science
(WOS) database provided by Thomson Scientiﬁc (Liu et al., 2010). After
preprocessing, the dataset contains 8305 journals categorized in 22 scientiﬁc
ﬁelds. To create a balanced benchmark data for evaluation, we select seven
ﬁelds consisting 1421 journals. The titles, abstracts and keywords of the
journal publications are indexed by a text mining program using no controlled
vocabulary. The weights of terms are calculated using four weighting
schemes: TF—IDF, IDF, TF and binary. The citations among journals are
also investigated from four different aspects: cross—citation, co—citation,
bibliographic coupling and binary cross—citation. The lexical similarities are
represented as normalized linear kernel matrices (using the same methods
applied on the disease data) and the citation metrics are regarded as weighted
adjacency matrices to create the Laplacians. Totally, four kernels and four
Laplacians are combined on journal data. The details about the two datasets
are presented in Supplementary Material 3.

The datasets used in our experiments are provided with labels; therefore,
the clustering performance is evaluated as comparing the automatic partitions
with the labels using adjusted rand index (ARI; Hubert and Arabie, 1985) and
normalized mutual information (NMI; Strehl and Ghosh, 2002). To evaluate
the ARI and NMI performance, we set K =14 on disease data and K = 7 on
journal data. We also tune the OKLC model using different K values.

We implement the proposed OKLC models to integrate multiple
kernels and Laplacians on disease data and journal set data.

All the comparing methods combine four kernels and four Laplacians. The mean values
and the SDs are observed from 20 random repetitions. The best performance is shown
in bold. The P-values are statistically evaluated with the best performance using paired
t-test.

To compare the performance, we also apply six popular ensemble
clustering methods mentioned in relevant work (Yu et al., 2010a)
to combine the partitions of individual kernels and Laplacians as
a consolidated partition. These six methods are CSPA (Strehl and
Ghosh, 2002), HGPA (Strehl and Ghosh, 2002), MCLA (Strehl and
Ghosh, 2002), QMI (Topchy et al., 2005), EACAL (Fred and Jain,
2005) and AdacVote (Ayad and Kamel, 2008). As shown in Tables 1
and 2, the performance of OKLC algorithms is better than all the
compared methods and the improvement is signiﬁcant. On disease
data, the best performance is obtained by OKLC model 1, which
uses sparse coefﬁcients to combine nine text mining kernels and
nine Laplacians to identify disease—relevant clusters (ARI: 0.5859,
NMI: 0.7451). On journal data, all three OKLC models perform
comparably well. The best one seems coming from OKLC model
3 (ARI: 0.7336, NMI: 0.7758), which optimizes the non—sparse
coefﬁcients on the four kernels and four Laplacians.

To evaluate whether the combination of kernel and Laplacian
indeed improve the clustering performance, we ﬁrst systematically
compared the performance of all the individual data sources using
KM and SC. As shown in Supplementary Material 4, on disease
data, the best KM performance (ARI 0.5441, NMI 0.7099) and SC
(ARI 0.5199, NMI 0.6858) performance are obtained on LDDB text
mining proﬁle. Next, we enumerate all the paired combinations of a
single kernel and a single Laplacian for clustering. The integration is

based on Equation (12) and the K value is set to 0.5 so the objectives
of KM and SC are combined averagely. The performance of all
45 paired combinations is presented in Supplementary Material 5.
As shown, the best KL clustering performance is obtained by
integrating the LDDB kernel with KO Laplacian (ARI 0.5298, NMI
0.6949). Moreover, we also found that the integration performance
varies signiﬁcantly by the choice of kernel and Laplacian, which
proves our previous point that the KL performance is highly
dependent on the quality of kernel and Laplacian. Using the
proposed OKLC algorithm, there is no need to enumerate all the
possible paired combinations. OKLC combines all the kernels and
Laplacians and optimizes their coefﬁcients in parallel, yielding a
comparable performance with the best paired combination of a single
kernel and a single Laplacian.

In Figure 1, two confusion matrices of disease data for a single run
are depicted. The values on the matrices are normalized according
to leij/Ti, where Ti is the total number of genes belonging
in disease i and Q is the number of these Ti genes that were
clustered to belong to class j. First, it is worth noting that OKLC
reduces the number of misclustered genes on breast cancer (Nr.1),
cardiomyopathy (Nr.2) and muscular dystrophy (Nr.11). Among the
misclustered genes in LDDB, ﬁve genes (TSG101, DBC1, CTTN,
SLC22A18, AR) in breast cancer, two genes in cardiomyopathy
(COX15, CSRP3) and two genes in muscular dystrophy (SEPNl,
COL6A3) are correctly clustered in OKLC model 1. Second, there
are several diseases where consistent misclustering occurs in both
methods, such as diabetes (Nr.6) and neuropathy (Nr.12). The
intuitive confusion matrices correspond to the numerical evaluation
results; as shown, the quality of clustering obtained by OKLC model
1 (ARI = 0.5898, NMI = 0.7429) is higher than LDDB.

The performance of individual data sources of journal data is
shown in Supplementary Material 6. The best KM (ARI 0.6482,
NMI 0.7104) is obtained on the IDF kernel and the best SC (ARI
0.5667, NMI 0.6807) is obtained on the cross—citation Laplacian.
To combine the four kernels with four Laplacians, we evaluate
all the 10 paired combinations and show the performance in
Supplementary Material 7. The best performance is obtained by
integrating the IDF kernel with the cross—citation Laplacian (ARI
0.7566, NMI 0.7702). As shown, the integration of lexical similarity
information and citation—based Laplacian indeed improves the
performance.

In Figure 2, the confusion matrices (also normalized) of journal
data for a single run are illustrated. We compare the best individual
data source (IDF with kernel KM, ﬁgure on the left) with the OKLC
model 1. In the confusion matrix of IDF KM, 79 journals belonging
to agriculture science (Nr.1) are misclustered to environment
ecology (Nr.3), 9 journals are misclustered to pharmacology and
toxicology (Nr.7). In OKLC, the number of agriculture journals
misclustered to environment ecology is reduced to 45, and the
number to pharmacology and toxicology is reduced to 5. On other
journal clusters, the performance of the two models is almost
equivalent.

We also investigated the performance of combining only multiple
kernels or multiple Laplacians. On the disease dataset, we combined
the nine kernels and the nine Laplacians for clustering, respectively,
using all the compared methods in Tables 1 and 2. On the journal
dataset, we combine the four text mining kernels and the four
citation Laplacians. The proposed OKLC method is simpliﬁed as
only optimizing coefﬁcients on Laplacians (step 2 in Algorithm 2.1)

or kernels (step 3). As shown in Supplementary Material 8, the
performance of OKLC is also comparable to the best performance
obtained either by kernel combination or Laplacian combination. In
particular, of all the methods we compared, the best performance is
all obtained on OKLC models or its simpliﬁed forms.

It is interesting to observe that the average combination model
(OKLC model 2) performs quite well on the journal dataset but not
on the disease dataset. This is probably because most of the sources
in journal dataset are relevant to the problem, whereas in disease
dataset some data sources are noisy, and thus the integration of
disease data sources is a non—trivial task. We expect that the other two
OKLC models (models 1 and 3) optimize the coefﬁcients assigned
on the kernels and the Laplacians to leverage multiple sources
in integration and, at the same time, to increase the robustness
of the combined model on combining relevant and irrelevant
data sources. To evaluate whether the optimized weights assigned
on individual sources have correlation with the performance, we

compare the rank of coefﬁcients with the rank of performance from
Tables 3—6. As shown, the largest coefﬁcients correctly indicate the
best individual data sources. It is worth noting that in multiple kernel
learning, the rank of coefﬁcients are only moderately correlated with
the rank of individual performance. In our experiments, the MeSH
kernel gets the second largest weights though its performance in
evaluation is low. In MKL, it is usual that the best individual kernel
found by cross—validation may not lead to a large weight when used
in combination (Ye et al., 2008). Kernel fusion combines multiple
sources at a reﬁned granularity, where the ‘moderate’ kernels
containing weak and insigniﬁcant information could complement
to other kernels to compose a ‘good’ kernel containing strong and
signiﬁcant information. Though such complementary information
cannot be incorporated when cross—validation is used to choose a
single best kernel, these ‘moderate’ kernels are still useful when
combined with other kernels (Ye et al., 2008). Based on the ranks
presented in Tables 5 and 6, we calculate the Spearman correlations

between the ranks of weights and the ranks of performance on both
datasets. The correlations of disease kernels, disease Laplacians,
journal kernels and journal Laplacians are, respectively, 0.5657,
0.6, 0.8 and 0.4. In some relevant work, the average Spearman
correlations are mostly around 0.4 (Lanckriet et al., 2004; Ye et al.,
2008). Therefore, the optimal weights obtained in our experiments
are generally consistent with the rank of performance.

As a spectral clustering algorithm, the optimal cluster number of
OKLC can be estimated by checking the plot of eigenvalues (von
Luxburg, 2007). To demonstrate this, we investigated the dominant
eigenvalues of the optimized combination of kernels and Laplacians.
In Figure 3, we compare the difference of three OKLC models with
the pre—deﬁned K (set as equal to the number of class labels). In
practical research, one can predict the optimal cluster number by
checking the ‘elbow’ of the eigenvalue plot. As shown in Figure 3,
the ‘elbow’ in disease data is quite obvious at the number of 14.
In journal data, the ‘elbow’ is more likely to range from 6 to 12.
All the three OKLC models show a similar trend on the eigenvalue
plot. Moreover, in Supplementary Material 9 we also compare the
eigenvalue curves using different K values as input. As shown, the
eigenvalue plot is quite stable with respect to the different inputs
of K, which means the optimized kernel and Laplacian coefﬁcients
are quite independent with the K value. This advantage enables a
reliable prediction about the optimal cluster number by integrating
multiple data sources.

To investigate the computational time, we benchmark OKLC
algorithms with other clustering methods on the two datasets.
As shown in Table 7, when optimizing the coefﬁcients, OKLC
algorithm (models 1 and 3) spends longer time than the other
methods to optimize the coefﬁcients on the Laplacians and

the kernels. However, the proposed algorithm is still efﬁcient.
Considering the fact that the proposed algorithm yields much better
performance and more enriched information (the ranking of the
individual sources) than other methods, it is worth spending extra
computational complexity on a promising algorithm.

4 CONCLUSION

In this article, we propose a new clustering approach, OKLC, to
optimize the combination of multiple kernels and Laplacians in
clustering analysis. The objective of OKLC is formulated as a
Rayleigh quotient function and is solved iteratively as a bi—level
optimization procedure. In the simplest interface, the proposed
algorithm only requires one input parameter, the cluster number
K, from the user. Moreover, depending on user’s expectation to
select the most relevant sources or to evenly combine all sources, the
sparseness of coefﬁcient vector 6 can be controlled via the parameter
6. In our article, we propose three variants of the OKLC algorithm
and validate them on two real applications. The performance of
clustering is systematically compared with a variety of algorithms

and different experimental settings. The proposed OKLC algorithms
perform signiﬁcantly better than other methods. Moreover, the
coefﬁcients of kernels and Laplacians optimized by OKLC show
strong correlation with the rank of performance of individual data
source. Though in our evaluation the K values are predeﬁned, in
practical studies, the optimal cluster number can be consistently
estimated from the eigenspectrum of the combined kernel Laplacian
matrix.

The proposed OKLC algorithm demonstrates the advantage of
combining and leveraging information from heterogeneous data
structures and sources. It is potentially useful in bioinformatics and
many other application areas, where there is a surge of interest
to integrate similarity—based information and interaction—based
relationships in statistical analysis and machine learning.

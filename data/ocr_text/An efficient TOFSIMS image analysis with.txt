Abstract

Motivation: Advances in analytical instrumentation towards acquiring high—resolution images of
mass spectrometry constantly demand efficient approaches for data analysis. This is particularly
true of time—of—flight secondary ion mass spectrometry imaging where recent advances enable ac—
quisition of high—resolution data in multiple dimensions. In many applications, the distribution of
different species from a sampled surface is spatially continuous in nature and a model that incorp—
orates the spatial correlation across the surface would be preferable to estimations at discrete
spatial locations. A key challenge here is the capability to analyse the high—resolution multidimen—
sional data to extract relevant information reliably and efficiently.

Results: We propose a framework based on alternating non—negativity—constrained least squares
which accounts for the spatial correlation across the sample surface. The proposed method also
decouples the computational complexity of the estimation procedure from the image resolution,
which significantly reduces the processing time. We evaluate the performance of the algorithm
with biochemical image datasets generated from mixture of metabolites.

1 Introduction

 

Imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) is an increasingly popular ap—
proach in the characterization of biological samples (Alexandrov
and Bartels, 2013; Alexandrov and Kobarg, 2011). It is a powerful
tool to image surface structure with a mass spectrum measured at
each pixel. One IMS technique is time—of—flight secondary ion mass
spectrometry (TOF—SIMS) with applications in areas as varied as
hair care (Kempson and Skinner, 2005), medical implants (Viornery
et 61]., 2002) and drug delivery systems (Belu et 61]., 2000). It is pri—
marily applied in monitoring the distribution of targeted chemical
species, but can also be employed for imaging surfaces in non-tar-
geted analyses, when surface compositions are not well defined, in
particular in the analysis of biological systems (Fletcher et 61]., 2007;

Vaidyanathan et 61]., 2008). However, this latter extension poses sev—
eral challenges with respect to data deconvolution. Multivariate
analysis (MVA) methods have been used extensively to map large
complex spatio—spectral TOF—SIMS data into factors of single com—
ponents providing insights into the type and distribution of chemical
species on a surface. Popular MVA techniques to describe spatio—
spectral TOF—SIMS data include principal component analysis
(PCA) (Jackson, 2005), maximum auto—correlation factor (MAF)
(Larsen, 2002; Tyler, 2006) and multivariate curve resolution
(MCR) (De Juan and Tauler, 2006).

The PCA is perhaps the most commonly used technique, either as a
main analysis step (Wagner and Castner, 2001) or an initialization step

(Graham and Castner, 2012; Lee et al., 2009) for MA approach. MAF
is an alternative to PCA which is independent of pre—treatment scaling.
The method is based on maximizing the autocorrelation between neigh—
bouring pixels. A comparison of the two methods for TOF—SIMS data
analysis is reported in Henderson et al. (2009), recommending the use
of MAF when images with low spectral intensity are analysed.

The presence of negative peaks in the spectrum computed using
PCA or MAF makes it more difficult to interpret the resulting factor—
ization. MCR optimized by alternating least squares (MCR—ALS)
(Esteban et al., 2000; Garrido et al., 2008) overcomes this problem by
imposing a non—negativity constraint in an iterative optimization pro—
cess (Kim and Park, 2007; Lawson and Hanson, 1974; Wang et al.,
2003). However, these methods can be computationally expensive
when applied to large three—way datasets. The fast combinatorial
non—negativity—constrained least squares (FC—NNLS) algorithm (Van
Benthem and Keenan, 2004) is specifically designed to handle such
datasets, allowing for significant gains in the speed and computational
demands of the optimization process in ALS applications.

Despite a substantial performance increase in FC—NNLS, the esti—
mation of loadings and scores when decomposing large TOF—SIMS
data in an MCR—ALS algorithm can still be problematic. One limita—
tion is that the complexity of the scores estimation is coupled with
the number of image pixels. Therefore, an increase in the image
resolution of the sample surface leads to increases in the uncertainty
and computational demands of the score and loading estimates.
This is becoming increasingly important as sophisticated TOF—SIMS
images with higher spatial resolution are becoming more widespread
(Hanrieder et al., 2013; Kubicek et al., 2014). Even for a currently
typical TOF—SIMS dataset with 128 X 128 pixels and a spectral mass
range up to 1000 Da, the implementation of ALS algorithm with
three spectral basis functions contains the estimation of 128 x 128
><3 values in the scores estimation step. This emphasizes the benefit
of decoupling the number of pixels in images and the number of par-
ameters. In addition, the progress towards acquisition of image data
in voxels as opposed to pixels confers further demand on the ana—
lysis time and efficiency of data processing (Fletcher and Vickerman,
2012; Fletcher et al., 2007).

Additionally, in cases where the spatial distribution of com—
pounds in an image is continuous such as chemical samples or sam—
ples from a biological cell or a cellular environment, the
characteristics at proximate/distant regions on the surface are ex—
pected to be highly/weakly correlated. This requires the inclusion of
the spatial correlation across the surface in the estimation of scores
and loadings from TOF—SIMS data.

We propose an approach to MCR—ALS that incorporates a
continuous—over—space formulation which accounts for spatial
correlation across the sample surface. Additionally, the algorithm does
not couple the complexity of the estimation procedure to the resolution
of TOF-SIMS images, resulting in a significant reduction in the process—
ing time. We exploit the method of a basis function decomposition of
scores images which simplifies the estimation of individual pixel values
into a set of weights. These weights scale the continuous basis functions
and lie in a significantly lower dimensional space. We set out to exam—
ine the algorithm with biochemically relevant model image datasets that
were generated from simple mixture of metabolites, as an example.

2 Methods

2.1 Dataset description
Three metabolites, tyrosine, phenylalanine, and citric acid (all from
Sigma Aldrich, UK) were used in the study. The metabolites were

spotted on hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) (Sigma Aldrich) coated
silicon wafers (Compart Technology, UK), prepared as detailed else—
where (Salim et al., 2012). A focused spot of the sample (individual
metabolites or metabolite mixture) was obtained, each spot contain—
ing about 125 pmole of the metabolite.

TOF—SIMS negative ion spectra and images were obtained using
a SIMS V instrument (ION—TOF Inc., Germany). Fifty kiloelectron
volt Bi? was used as the primary ion source for the high current,
bunched mode spectral acquisition, with a target current of 0.11 pA
and 500 um2 field of view. The images collected contained
128 x 128 pixels. The vacuum in the analytical chamber was held at
10_9 mbar. Primary ion dose was kept below the static limit of 1013
primary ions/cm2 to maintain the static SIMS status. Each spectrum
was calibrated using hydrocarbon fragment peaks.

Spectral data up to m/z 200 was considered for analysis. Image
data were exported in ASCII format to MATLAB where it was ana-
lysed. Only the intensities at 100 m/z data points were considered
for the image analysis of all samples. This included the m/z corres-
ponding to CNT (m/z226) and the deprotonated metabolite ions
[M — H]_ for the three metabolites (as known signals).

Dataset contains measurements for three metabolites, tyrosine
(T), phenylalanine (P) and citric acid (C), spotted separately as indi—
vidual ‘pure’ species and as mixtures, one containing equimolar pro-
portions of tyrosine and citric acid (TC) and another containing all
three metabolites in equimolar proportions (TPC).

2.2 MCR model
The spatio—spectral TOF—SIMS data matrix can be described by the
bilinear MCR model

Y(f, s) =W(S)BT(f) +E(f, s), (1)

where f denotes the mass—to—charge ratio and s is the spatial location
in the two—dimensional physical surface. The superscript T denotes
the transpose operator. Each TOF—SIMS image with the dimension
of 1 pixels by 1’ pixels is reshaped to form a column of the p X 11 data
matrix, Y(-), where p : l X l’. The TOF—SIMS measurement is fac—
tored into a p X m scores matrix,  and a z/ x m loadings matrix,
B(-), comprising of m spectral basis vectors. The p X 11 matrix of re—
siduals,  is added to account for unmodelled terms and experi—
mental errors. This way spatio—spectral TOF—SIMS data are
decomposed into spatial (scores) and spectral (loadings) data matri—
ces which respectively provide information about the distribution
and the identity of the species. Each element of Y at a given spatial
location can be written as a sum of weighted loadings at a particular
peak, where the weights are scores at that spatial location, that is,

w, s) = ﬁve-(shim + Ev, s), <2)

i=1

where W,(-) and bi(-) denote the ith weight and spectral basis vec—
tors, respectively.

2.3 Estimation algorithm
A solution to the MCR model given in Equation (1) can be obtained
by minimizing the following cost function

1(W7B)=IIY — WBTné. <3)

where  - F denotes the Frobenius norm. This optimization problem
can be solved using the ALS algorithm (Paatero and Tapper, 1994).
When initialized, at each iteration the estimated scores are used to
update the loadings. The resulting estimates of the loadings are then

used when estimating new scores for the next iteration. The proced—
ure stops when the convergence is achieved. The ALS algorithm is
often combined with a non—negativity—constrained least squares to
provide chemically meaningful solutions. In this case, the cost func—
tion (3) becomes

](W,B) 2 MY — WBT||12Fs.t.W,B > o (4)

where W, B > 0 indicates that all the elements of W and B are non-
negative. Here, we use the FC—NNLS algorithm with ALS (Van
Benthem and Keenan, 2004) which efficiently solves the non—nega—
tivity—constrained least squares problem.

The knowledge of the system’s rank or the number of spectral
basis vectors, m, is required prior to the ALS algorithm. Here, we
use PCA and the scree test criterion as a guide to determine the num—
ber of spectral basis vectors. There are more sophisticated tech—
niques that incorporate smoothing methods or subspace
comparisons, in order to reduce the effect of measurement noise in
the system’s rank identification (Jiang et al., 2004).

The stopping rule adopted is based on observing the Frobenius
norms of the successive estimates of W matrices in Equation (4), that is,

k k—l
IIWIIEJ — “will )< p, <5)

where p is a threshold value.

2.4 Model decomposition

To facilitate the estimation procedure, we use a decomposition using
a finite set of continuous basis functions to represent scores images.
The proposed model accounts for the spatial correlation across the
sample surface. This is preferable to estimations at discrete spatial
locations where the distribution of species in the surface is continu—
ous in nature. The decomposition is described by

Wi(Sp) % Z “17¢;(Sp) (6)
i=1

where  are known basis functions scaled by unknown weights,
09,-, and n is the number of basis functions used to perform the de—
composition. The basis functions used here are two—dimensional
Gaussian functions given by

(S‘I‘«¢;)T(SM¢)>7 (7)

¢(S) : exp < 2

ad)

where ad, and Md, are the basis function width and centre, respect—
ively. These are standard basis functions often used to approximate
continuous fields from sampled observations (Park and Sandberg,
1991). They satisfy all the required conditions for reconstruction
functions (Scerri et al., 2009) and have advantageous characteristics:
(i) semi—compact support; (ii) dimensionally factorizable, allowing
efficient computation in higher dimension and (iii) a closed form
Fourier transform which is also Gaussian (Sanner and Slotine,
1992). The latter facilitates the determination of the width of the
basis functions using spatial frequency analysis described in the fol—
lowing section.
Substituting Equation (6) into Equation (2), we obtain a continu—
ous approximation which can be evaluated at f = f,, and s : sp as
Y(f1/)SP) : Z [ aii¢j(sp)] bi(fv) + 130(1)) 517): (8)
1

i=1 i:

This formulation accounts for spatial correlation across the sample

surface via sum of weighted Gaussian basis functions. This can be
written in a compact form as

Y = @ABT + E, (9)

where A is an unknown n x m weight matrix and q) is a constant
p x 11 matrix given by

¢>1(51) $201) ¢3(51)  ¢>n(51)
$102) $202) $302)  ¢>n(52)
q): ¢1(S3) ¢2(S3) ¢3(S3)  ¢n(83) , (10)

¢1(Sp) ¢2(Sp) ¢3(Sp) ¢n(sp) pxn

This representation allows for a more efficient implementation of the
ALS algorithm. The complexity of the scores estimation step in the opti—
mization problem given in Equation (4) is directly linked to the reso—
lution of TOF-SIMS images, limiting the applicability of the ALS
algorithm to big datasets. However, in Equation (9), the scores matrix
is decomposed into two parts: an unknown weight matrix Anxm and a
constant matrix 0);,” depending only on basis functions. Therefore, the
estimation problem of the scores matrix is simplified to the estimation
of a matrix of weights with a significantly lower dimension. Similarly,
the decomposition also simplifies the estimation of loadings matrix.
This leads to decreases in uncertainty in the score and loading estimates
and also improvement in the convergence property of the algorithm. An
example of the decomposition of a score image using an equally spaced
grid of 9 X 9 basis functions is shown in Figure 1.

Using the basis function representation, the cost function for the
estimation of loadings, B, becomes

](A, B) 2 Hi? — ABT||% s.t. B > o (11)

where
226x an
of = («won‘qu (13)

and A is fixed. The cost function for estimating the weight matrix,
A, is given by

](A,B) = “if — BAT||% St A > o (14)

where B is fixed. The matrix, Y, can be calculated once and stored
prior to the commencement of the algorithm. Here, the Frobenius

centre of each basis function is shown by a green cross (Color version of this

norms of the successive estimates of A can be monitored to stop the
algorithm.

It should be noted that basis decomposition technique results
into smoother estimates of scores images which might blur sharp
boundaries and details. However, if high resolution scores images
are required, an extra step can be added to the estimation algorithm.
The final estimate of B, obtained from the iterative optimization of
Equations (11) and (14), can be used in a single run of the FC—NNLS
algorithm to minimize

](W,B) 2 MY — WBT||% s.t. W > o, (15)

and B is fixed. This way a detailed estimate of the scores images is
obtained, while the loadings are still calculated from the reduced
continuous representation of scores images. The complete estima—
tion framework is given in Algorithm 1. The minimization of
Equations (11), (14) and (15) can be implemented using the
MATLAB m-file fcnnls provided by Van Benthem and Keenan
(2004). Note, FC—NNLS uses the solution of the overwriting method
(Gallagher et al., 2004) to initialize the algorithm.

2.5 Spatial frequency analysis

The spatial frequency response of the ion image can be used to specify
the width and spacing of the basis functions. The spatial cutoff fre—
quency of the image, V6, can be found by calculating its power spectral
density. This can be then used to determine the distance between basis
functions such that Shannon’s sampling theorem is satisfied

 

A): <16)

2pvc ’
where p E R21 is an oversampling parameter (Sanner and Slotine,
1992). The width of the basis functions is also governed by the spa—
tial cutoff frequency of scores images. For an attenuation of 3 dB at
115, the width of Gaussian’s basis functions should be set to
(Freestone et al., 2011)

1 ln 2
= —. 1
ad) 1w, 2 ( 7)

 

The number of basis functions can then be specified by dividing the spa—
tial region of interest into Ad, intervals. From reciprocal role of 116 in
Equations (16) and (17), it follows that a high cutoff frequency results
into a representation which comprises a large number of basis functions
with narrow widths. This results into a computationally more complex
estimation procedure as a higher number of weights is required to be
estimated. Therefore, a compromise should be made between the
accuracy and the computational demands of the estimation algorithm.
The number of basis functions can be reduced by limiting the spatial
bandwidth of the approximated images to a lower value.

3 Results

The proposed algorithm was first implemented on pure species to
extract discriminatory information from the estimated scores and
loadings. The extracted information was then used to perform peak
assignment in the computed spectra of TC and TPC mixtures.
During this process, the spectral information was summarized into
three major peaks that can differentiate different species. This infor-
mation was also used to examine replicate measurements of each
dataset to further evaluate the performance of the algorithm. The
total ion images for each dataset are depicted in Supplementary
Figure S1. TOF—SIMS images were mapped onto [—1 1] in both x
and y directions and therefore the spatial aspects of the model can
be considered arbitrary. Cross—section of the spatial frequency re—
sponse along the x—axis for TPC mixture is shown in Figure 2. From
this figure, it can be seen that to capture the full spatial bandwidth,
VC should be set to a high value (% 5.5, shown by blue dashed line),

count for the slow roll—off in the frequency response of Gaussian

basis functions, the oversampling parameter of p=2 was chosen.
Using these values in Equations (16) and (17) yielded the distance
between adjacent basis functions’ centres Ad, : 0.3 and the width of
basis functions ad) : 0.22. Given the spatial domain of interest, a
grid of 9 X 9 equally spaced basis functions can be used to satisfy
Shannon’s sampling criterion. With this arrangement, the number of
unknown parameters was reduced from m X 16 384 to m X 81.

The pre—processing stage involved normalizing the data to the
total ion counts. This was followed by Poisson scaling (Keenan and
Kotula, 2004) for the system’s rank analysis.

An initial guess of the number of spectral basis vectors, m, for
each Poisson—scaled dataset was obtained using PCA and the scree
test. The scree plot for the first few principal components is shown
in Figure 3. The results suggested three spectral basis vectors for
each of T, P and C elements and two and three spectral basis vectors
for TC and TPC mixtures, respectively.

The proposed algorithm was then applied on TOF—SIMS datasets
to estimate loadings and the corresponding scores images. In the es—
timation procedure, we set m=3 for all pure and mixed species

despite the suggested rank of two for TC compound in the PCA ana-
lysis. The results for scores and loadings estimation for T, P and C
components are shown in Figure 4. The m/z number for dominant
peaks are illustrated in the loadings plots where the inset figures
show the corresponding ion images in the TOF—SIMS dataset. Figure
4d shows large peaks (sorted in order of decreasing magnitudes) at
m/z = 180.06, 121.02 and 71.01 for the first factor of component
T. For component P, the first factor comprises of large peaks at
m/z = 164.05, 71.01 and 26.01 (Fig. 4]). For component C, signifi-
cant peaks for the first factor are located at m/z = 87.02, 41.01,
111.02 and 191.02 (Fig. 4p). As can be seen, the [M — H]_ signals
for each of the metabolite predominates, but fragment ion contribu—
tions also exist.

Peaks at m/z = 26.01, m/z = 27.98 and m/z = 136.93 are com—
mon between second and the third factors of all components.
Therefore, these m/z values do not contain discriminatory informa-
tion and can be considered noise in the system. In fact, the corres—
ponding scores images of the second and third factors show noisy
structures. Also, the peak at m / z = 71.01 presents in the first factors

of T (Fig. 4d) and P (Fig. 4]) and cannot be used to distinguish these
species. From this analysis, the characteristic peak for component P
can be identified as m/z = 164.05, which would be the deproto—
nated metabolite ion [M — H]_.

The result of the algorithm for TC mixture is illustrated in
Figure 5. Similar to the previous example, we associate the peak at
m/z = 136.93 in Figure 5f to the existence of the noise in the sys—
tem. The peak at m/z = 180.06 of the first factor in component T
can be also identified in Figure 5d with its corresponding scores
image illustrated in Figure 5a. The same observation can be made
for the component C, where three peaks of the first factor, that is,
m/z = 41.01, 87.02 and 191.02, can be identified (Fig. 5e).
However, the peaks at m/z = 41.01, 87.02 and 111.02 can be puta—
tively identified as fragment ions CHCOT, C4H7O§ and
[M — H — COz — 2HzO]_, respectively. The algorithm performed
well in this case where both T and C species were successfully identi—
fied. The analysis suggested m/z = 180.06 and m/z = 191.02 as
characteristic peaks for T and C, respectively.

The results for the score and loading estimates for TPC mixture
are depicted in Figure 6. The algorithm is able to identify all the spe—
cies, T (m/z = 180.06), P (m/z = 164.05) and C (m/z = 191.02), as
is shown in Figure 6(d—f). Again, the fragment ions at m/z = 41.01
and m/z = 87.02 are also present in the spectrum shown in Figure
6e. The algorithm is unable to separate the distribution of T
(m/z = 180.06) and P (m/z = 164.05) as is shown in Figure 6a. We
attribute this to the peak at m / z = 71.01, which is common between
T and P species, making it difficult to separate the two types.
However, the algorithm can almost isolate the distribution of C
component from the mixture. Note a small peak at m/z = 191.02
still exists in Figure 6d.

From the above analysis, the important peaks required to iden—
tify T, P and C components are m/z = 180.06, 164.05 and 191.02,

Fig. 7. Convergence of the estimation algorithm. The change in the Frobenius
norm of the error, E (Equations (1) and (9)). The full and reduced models are
shown by dotted and dashed lines, respectively

respectively. There are also strong peaks at m/z = 121.02 and m/z
: 183.02 for T (Fig. 4d and e, respectively) and at m/z = 111.02
for C (Fig. 4p); however, these peaks are not present in TC and TPC
mixtures. It should be noted that the peaks at m/z = 41.01 and
87.02 (Fig. 4p) are also present in TC and TPC spectra. Although
these peaks can provide discriminatory information for the compo-
nent C, they are fragment ions of the process. The results using ap—
propriate number of spectral basis vectors, that is, m = 1 for T, P
and C datasets and m :2 for TC dataset, are also provided in
Supplementary Figure S2, showing successful identification of differ-
ent components in each case.

The extracted information was also used to perform similar ana—
lysis on replicate images of T, P, C, TC and TPC to further examine
the performance of the algorithm on discerning different species. In
this case, we used the correct number of spectral basis vectors, that
is, m: 1, 2 and 3, respectively, for each pure replicate measure—
ments, TC replicate measurements and TPC replicate measurements.
The results are given in Supplementary Data, confirming the ability
of the proposed algorithm to identify different components. In the
case of pure species, the characteristic peak for the component C at
m/z = 191.02 is dominated by fragment ions, that is, m/z = 41.01
and 87.02 (bottom panels of Supplementary Fig. S3c—f). However,
this peak can be clearly identified from TC and TPC mixtures as is
shown in Supplementary Figures S4 and S5.

In each experiment, the algorithm was allowed to run for a max—
imum number of 100 iterations, although typically the change in the
weights matrix Frobenius norm dropped below 10‘5 after less than
20 iterations.

We compared ion image estimates from the full model and the
reduced model with TOF—SIMS data using the mean (over spectra)
of the root mean square error (MRMSE) over space. The average
MRMSE of the image estimates over three replicate measurements
are shown in Table 1. The slight increase in the error is due to the
low—pass action of the basis functions which attenuates the high fre-
quency details of the scores images during the iterative algorithm.

A comparison between the convergence of the algorithms when
reduced and full models were used is also shown in Figure 7. Note
that for 128 x 128 pixels images and m = 3, each iteration of the al—
gorithm takes 65 .3 ms for the full model. This is 7.8 ms when the
reduced model is used.

We also generated images using random numbers with different
pixel densities to compare the computation time for the full model
(FC—NNLS) and the reduced model (Algorithm 1 with n : 81) using
different number of spectral basis vectors. The computation time is
approximately 100 times faster when the reduced model is used as is
shown in Figure 8.

4 Discussion

This article has presented a novel framework for solving the alter—
nating non—negativity—constrained least squares using TOF—SIMS
measurement. The novel and key developments of the article include
a continuous—over—space formulation which accounts for the spatial
correlation across the sample surface and decoupling the computa—
tional complexity of the estimation procedure from the number of
pixels in the ion images. This results in a significant reduction in the
processing time that will translate favourably when high—resolution
images are analysed and in the analyses of three—dimensional images,
where voxels of information require processing.

To demonstrate the new methodology, the proposed algorithm
was evaluated using image data from simple mixture of metabolites.
Although the algorithm performed well, validating the framework
on more complex test datasets is still required. Such datasets can in—
clude multiple components with similar mass spectrum but different
intensities, patterned samples or images with higher pixel densities.

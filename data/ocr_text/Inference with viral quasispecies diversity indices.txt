ABSTRACT

Given the inherent dynamics of a viral quasispecies, we are often
interested in the comparison of diversity indices of sequential samples
of a patient, or in the comparison of diversity indices of virus in groups
of patients in a treated versus control design. It is then important to
make sure that the diversity measures from each sample may be
compared with no bias and within a consistent statistical framework.
In the present report, we review some indices often used as measures
for viral quasispecies complexity and provide means for statistical in-
ference, applying procedures taken from the ecology field. In particu-
lar, we examine the Shannon entropy and the mutation frequency, and
we discuss the appropriateness of different normalization methods of
the Shannon entropy found in the literature. By taking amplicons ultra-
deep pyrosequencing (UDPS) raw data as a surrogate of a real hepa-
titis C virus viral population, we study through in-silico sampling the
statistical properties of these indices under two methods of viral qua-
sispecies sampling, classical cloning followed by Sanger sequencing
(CCSS) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) such as UDPS. We
propose solutions specific to each of the two sampling methods—
CCSS and NGS—to guarantee statistically conforming conclusions
as free of bias as possible.

1 INTRODUCTION

RNA viruses show a high replication error rate due to the lack of
proofreading mechanisms, and it is estimated that for viruses
with typically high replicative loads every possible point muta-
tion and many double mutations are generated with each viral
replication cycle, and may be present within the population at
any time (Domingo et al., 2012). In the case of hepatitis C virus
(HCV), the viral load—deﬁned as the number of viral particles

per milliliter of serum in acutely or chronically infected pa-
tients—may reach 107 in immunocompetent patients, which
roughly means a population of circulating particles of
1010—1011 at any given time. This population is highly dynamic,
with a viral half-life of a few hours, and with the production and
clearance of 1010—1012 genomes per day in a patient (Herrmann
et al., 2000; Neumann et al., 1998). Given this inherent dynamics,
we are often interested in the comparison of diversity indices of
sequential samples of a patient or among groups of patients.
These comparisons may be informative of the patient evolution
or the appropriateness of a given treatment (Supplementary
Material).

Next-generation sequencing methods (NGS) will likely be in-
creasingly adopted in clinical diagnostics in the next years.
Improvements in costs, protocols and coverage are closing the
gap between what was feasible in research and diagnostics. The
ﬁrst diagnostics likely to be moved to NGS will be those cur-
rently based on classical molecular cloning and Sanger sequen-
cing (CCSS) because it is labor intensive and has limited
sensitivity. In this work we use in-silico sampling from viral ref-
erence distributions to study the statistical properties of diversity
indices aimed at quantifying RNA virus quasispecies complexity.

Estimates of the species richness and other diversity indices as
deﬁned in ecology (Supplementary Material) are challenging
when populations are complex in genomic composition
(Magurran and McGill, 2010) as is the case with viral quasispe-
cies (Domingo et al., 2012; Perales et al., 2010). The approaches
in the ecology domain are extensive and still active (Chao and
Shen, 2003; Chao et al., 2009, 2010; Colwell et al., 2012; Heip
and Engels, 1974; Hellmann and Fowler, 1999; Hutcheson, 1970;
J 0st, 2006; Magurran and McGill, 2010; Nemenman et al., 2011;
Pardo et al., 1997; Salicru et al., 1993; Tuomisto, 2010; Walther
and Moore, 2005) and can be useful for the analysis of viral
quasispecies. Although the quasispecies deﬁnition as a ‘dynamic
distributions ofnon-identical but closely related mutant and recom-
binant viral genomes subjected to a continuous process of genetic
variation, competition and selection, and which act as a unit of
selection’ (Domingo et al., 2005) conveys an intuitive image
of complexity, no comprehensive and universally admitted

Inference with viral quasispecies diversity indices

 

index of quasispecies complexity exists. In a large population in
equilibrium or with small perturbations, the genome frequencies
are related with their relative ﬁtness. There are a number of
useful indices and variables but none of them fully captures
that intuitive image. Viral quasispecies complexity may be
viewed as a multivariate feature, where the number of haplotypes
of polymorphic sites and their relative frequencies are its dimen-
sions. Each of these indices and variables are difﬁcult to estimate
given the expected diversity of a quasiespecies from available
data and the limited sample size amenable to analysis
(Domingo et al., 2012).

The primary indices measure the extend of the viral quasispe-
cies complexity by the number of haplotypes, polymorphic sites
and number of different mutations; these may be considered as
richness indices. Other indices such as the Shannon entropy (S)
(Shannon, 1948) or the Simpson index (Magurran, 2004) meas-
ure the diversity, or the evenness when normalized to maximum
diversity (Sn), while others such as the mutation frequency (Mf)
or the nucleotide diversity (Pi) measure the intrapopulation het-
erogeneity, that is how different are the members of the popula-
tion among them. S and Sn, or the Simpson index, are not
sensitive to the number of mutations. The Simpson index has
been less used with viral quasispecies (Nowak et al. 1991,
Wolinsky et al. 1996), as it provides a more stable, although
less sensitive, measure of diversity by downweighting the rare
haplotypes. Mf measures the heterogeneity with respect to the
most represented (dominant) sequence (Ramirez et al., 2013) or
the consensus sequence of the population (Cabot et al., 2000). Pi
gives the global population heterogeneity, taking into account
the average number of mutations between each pair of individ-
uals in the viral population (Nei, 1987). Each of these variables
describes a different part of the mutation space occupied by a
quasispecies, and they all provide relevant information regarding
mutation barriers to antiviral treatment resistance.

We studied by in-silico sampling the distribution and proper-
ties of three of the most common variables used to quantify the
viral quasispecies complexity in the literature, the diversity
through S and Sn and the heterogeneity through Mf. The qua-
sispecies richness by the number of estimated haplotypes in the
population is also studied because of its implications on Sn and
Mf. We propose methods for inference for each sampling
scheme—CCSS and NGS—with these complexity indices.

2 METHODS

2.1 Basic assumptions

To make simulations of CCSS or NGS sampling experiments, we need
the distribution of haplotypes of a viral quasispecies. We can empirically
approach a 1010 genomes distribution by taking the raw data from high
coverage amplicon ultra-deep pyrosequencing (UDPS) experiments of
samples of a wide complexity spectrum as reference distributions.
Simulations of measures by CCSS will be obtained by in-silico sam-
pling a given number of particles from the reference distribution, where
any particle has the same probability to be sampled. Simulations of meas-
ures from NGS data will be obtained by in-silico sampling a number of
particles from these distributions and setting an abundance ﬁlter, corres-
ponding to RT+ PCR+ NGS noise levels (Archer et al., 2012;
Beerenwinkel and Zagordi, 2011; Beerenwinkel et al., 2012; Flaherty
et al., 2012; Gilles et al., 2011; Huse et al., 2007; Loman et al., 2012;

Macalalad et al., 2012; Mild et al., 2011; Prosperi and Salemi, 2012;
Prosperi et al., 2011; Vandenbroucke et al., 2011; Zagordi et al., 2012).
This study is based on the following set of basic assumptions:

(a) A very high coverage (~50 000 times) UDPS amplicon dataset from
patient samples of HCV may be considered as a coarse approxima-
tion to the high complexity of RNA virus quasiespecies, and the
observed distribution of haplotypes may be used as a viral popula-
tion reference distribution from which to sample viral particles.

(b) A CCSS in-silico experiment consists in sampling a given number
of viral particles from a reference distribution. All obtained se-
quences are accepted as true members of the population.
Measures of viral quasispecies complexity are then computed
from the observed haplotypes and frequencies.

(0) The NGS methods have a noise level, due to Reverse transcription
(RT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) sequencing errors,
below which we may not distinguish true from erroneous muta-
tions. Any data treatment of amplicon NGS sequences requires
some sort of abundance ﬁlter to exclude artifactual haplotypes and
point mutations.

(d) As a simple approach, a NGS in-silico experiment consists in
sampling a given number of molecules from the reference distribu-
tion, followed by an abundance ﬁlter to exclude all haplotypes
with abundance below the noise level. Measures of viral quasispe-
cies complexity are then computed from the ﬁltered haplotypes
and frequencies.

2.2 Indices of diversity, deﬁnitions and equations

We give in the Supplementary Material all relevant deﬁnitions and equa-
tions used throughout this work. That is, the deﬁnitions related to viral
quasispecies and to diversity indices, and the equations with and without
bias corrections.

2.3 Distribution of diversity measures

The distribution of a variable measuring viral quasispecies complexity
obtained by a CCSS experiment will be estimated by repeating a
number of times (2000) an in-silico sampling of a given number of viral
particles, and computing such variable each time. In this study, we re-
peated a number of times experiments with 20 and 50 clones, covering the
most common range of sample sizes in the literature. The distribution of
NGS measures were obtained by repeating the same number of times
(2000) in-silico samplings of 400 and 1000 reads sampled from the refer-
ence populations, ﬁltering at a noise level of 0.5% and computing the
complexity variables each time. This is a feasible expected mean coverage
in clinical settings with ~50 samples in a 454 Junior plate.

2.4 Shannon entropy normalization

In the ecology literature, the Shannon entropy (Supplementary Equation
SI) is normalized to the natural logarithm of the number of estimated
species in the population (Supplementary Equation SVI) so that a popu-
lation where all species are equally represented corresponds to a max-
imum entropy of 1, whereas a population with a single species is a
population of minimum entropy, with Sn 2 0. In the virology literature,
we observe other two normalizations. Either to log(N) (Abbate et al.,
2005; Cabot et al., 2000; Grande—Perez et al., 2002; Pawlotsky et al.,
1998) or to N (Fishman and Branch, 2009; Nasu et al., 2011; Nishijima
et al., 2012), where N is the sample size, that is the number of clones in
each sample. The normalization to logm) is justiﬁed by saying that max-
imum entropy is attained when all observed molecules are different. These
two normalizations are sample size-dependent, that is, having the same S
for two samples of different size from the same population, we obtain two

different Sn. Normalizing to logGV) may be accepted when the number of
clones of all samples to be compared is the same as in (Abbate et al., 2005;
Pawlotsky et al., 1998) but lacks justiﬁcation otherwise.

A different measure of Shannon entropy may be obtained by the aver-
age of the per-site S, which would be normalized to log(4) for nucleotide
sequences, or to log(20) for amino acid sequences—the natural logarithm
of the alphabet size.

In this study, we use the per-haplotype S, with Sn normalized to log(h),
where h is the number of estimated haplotypes in the population, accord-
ing to the deﬁnition of Shannon entropy used in ecology. The meaning of
the three normalizations is different. Where S/log(N) and S /N are scaled
versions of S with equivalent statistical properties, and S/log(h) requires
the estimate of h, and is inﬂuenced by its distribution.

2.5 Rarefaction

When the expected value of a diversity index depends of the sample size,
we render comparable two samples of different size by rarefaction. The
process of rarefaction (Magurran and McGill, 2010) is deﬁned as a re-
peated resampling without replacement from a sample to a smaller
sample size. In ecology, it is speciﬁcally used to compare species richness
values, and to construct rarefaction curves. This is particularly useful for
biased estimators where the bias is a function of the sample size, as the
number of haplotypes, S and Sn.

2.6 Fringe trimming

When ﬁltering the haplotypes of an NGS experiment above a given noise
level, say 0.5% for instance, because of the sampling process there are
chances to accept haplotypes with real abundances <0.5% while rejecting
haplotypes that are >0.5% in the population. This produces fringes of
haplotypes at the lower end of the NGS ﬁltered sample, which could
compromise the comparison of samples. A conservative way to make
comparable samples of ﬁltered data, eventually of different sizes, is to
trim these fringes up to a given conﬁdence level. Fringe trimming and
haplotype ﬁltering may be carried out in a single step by excluding all
haplotypes with

P(n 5 n,-|N,P = 0.005)<0.9

that is, by excluding the haplotypes with n, reads for which the probabil-
ity to observe up to n, counts in a sample of size N, when the haplotype
abundance in the population is 0.5%, is <90%. Both the noise level and
the conﬁdence level may be modiﬁed as required. As examples, 0.5 and
90% are just given, which ﬁt our requirements on HCV NS3 samples,
according to previous experience (Gregori et al. 2013, Ramirez et al.
2013). In the Supplementary Material, we show results ﬁltering at 0.2
and at 1%, and trimming at different conﬁdence levels.

2.7 Software and statistical methods

The in-silico sampling and all the computations and graphics were done
on the open source R language and environment (R Core Team, 2013)
using default libraries, and libraries in the Bioconductor project

(Gentleman et al., 2004) as the Biostrings library (Pages et al., 2012).
The R scripts are available upon request. NGS data simulations from a
set of haplotypes of the high complexity population were performed by
the Grinder program (Angly et al. 2012) with the parameters described in
the Supplementary Material.

2.8 Data

Samples from two patients, one with an acute HCV infection and another
with a chronic HCV infection were used to obtain the reference distribu-
tions used in the in-silico sampling. Six amplicons covering the NS3 HCV
region were compared. The methods and protocols followed from patient
sampling to UDPS sequencing have been described elsewhere (Cubero
et al., 2013). A coarse quality ﬁlter is used on the raw 454 reads to exclude
all haplotypes represented by a single read, or those with more than two
indeterminations or three gaps. We took the haplotype distribution of
three of these amplicons as reference distributions of examples of quasis-
pecies with low, mid and high complexity. The corresponding fasta ﬁles
are included in the Supplementary Material, with frequencies (number of
reads and percentage) in the header of each haplotype. The characteriza-
tion of these reference quasispecies, along with the number of reads ob-
tained in sequencing are given in Table 1. Although the reference
distributions are based on HCV patient samples, we think that the con-
clusions are equally extensible to any virus passing through an RNA
phase.

2.9 In-silico sampling

The statistical properties of diversity indices are studied by in-silico sam-
pling from the reference distributions described above. The sampling is
done by generating n random integers, where n is the sample size, between
1 and N, where N is the number of molecules in the reference population,
with replacement, and assigning each random number to the correspond-
ing haplotype by the population cumulative distribution (Fig. 1A).

3 RESULTS

3.1 Data characterization

Three reference distributions of different levels of viral quasispe-
cies complexity—low, mid and high—are used as datasets
(Table 1). The proﬁle of these quasispecies populations may be
depicted by the cumulative distribution of its haplotype frequen-
cies (Fig. 1A). A complementary plot in Figure 1B gives the haplo-
type frequencies in descending order, with a dash-dot line at the
0.5% cutoff showing the incidence of ﬁltering on each population.
On the other hand, Supplementary Table S1 shows the effect of
ﬁltering at different noise levels on the reference populations. The
most dramatic change is produced on the number of haplotypes,
followed by the number of polymorphic sites. Mf and Pi show a
smooth transition, while Sn displays a similar behavior except for
the mid-complexity population where larger changes are

observed. Increasing levels of ﬁltering are considered as the grad-
ual elimination of genomes of low replication ﬁtness. The number
of reads excluded by these ﬁlters is particularly high for the high-
complexity population, where ﬁltering at 1% abundance repre-
sents the exclusion of 42.5% of the population. This is consistent
with the production of tails of low ﬁtness mutants from each of the
haplotypes with enough replicating ﬁtness.

3.2 Inference on complexity values in CCSS

We studied the distribution of S, Sn and Mf for CCSS samples of
20 and 50 clones, respectively, by 2000 replicates of in-silico
sampling, for each of the three populations. The median of the
observed values and the standard deviations are given in
Supplementary Table S2A. The corresponding boxplots are
shown in Figure 2A. Mf shows no bias with respect to the popu-
lation value in any of the three populations. For S and Sn, we
observe a bias with respect to the population value, which is
sample size-dependent. When comparing pairs of samples of

size 20 and 50, this differential bias could bring to the wrong
conclusion that they come from populations of different
diversity.

When applying the bias corrections of Hutcheson
(Supplementary Equation SII) (Hutcheson, 1970) and Chaol
(Supplementary Equation SIII) (Chao et al., 2009) the bias is
partially corrected but remains sample size dependent
(Supplementary Table S2B and Supplementary Fig. S1). While
applying the rarefaction of the samples of size 50 to size 20, the
median values of both samples are brought to the same level
(Supplementary Table S2C and Supplementary Fig. S2) and
the samples become comparable despite the different sample size.

In conclusion, the Mf values are not biased and may be dir-
ectly compared with no further precaution, but the comparison
of S or Sn values requires a bias correction. When the sizes of the
two samples being compared are unbalanced, the comparison of
S or Sn also requires the rarefaction of the big sample to the
small sample size (Box 1). Inference is carried out by the t-test
(Supplementary Equation SXI) (Hutcheson, 1970).

3.3 Inference on complexity values in NGS

We have taken 400 and 1000 reads as feasible sample sizes in a
clinical setting for the determination of the viral complexity by
NGS, with the same ratio as the 20 and 50 clones used in CCSS.
Now we consider as population diversity values those obtained
from the populations ﬁltered at the noise level (Supplementary
Table S2D). That is, the values that at best could be obtained by
NGS.

While ﬁltering at the noise level most ‘rare’ haplotypes are
removed and the bias correction on S and Sn, as seen under
CCSS, has a lower impact. On the distribution of 2000 replicates
of samples of 400 and 1000 reads, ﬁltered at 0.5%, we still ob-
serve a sample size differential bias, not only for S and Sn, but
also for Mf in this sampling scheme (Supplementary Table S2D
and Fig. 2B). The bias correction of Hutcheson (Supplementary
Equation SII) has a limited impact, as expected.

We observed that the ﬁltering has effects that depend of the
sample size, as may be seen in Figure 3A with a scatterplot of the
number of haplotypes observed on 2000 replicates of pairs of
samples of size 400 and 1000. The small samples are clearly
biased toward higher number of haplotypes despite being
sampled from the same population, and ﬁltered at the same
abundance level. This effect is explained by the lower frequencies
at which the same haplotypes are observed when increasing the
sample size, particularly for those at the lower frequency end.
The number of haplotypes observed before ﬁltering in the big
samples is higher than those observed in the small samples. As a
consequence, the relative frequencies of the same haplotypes are
lower in the big than in the small samples. This is illustrated in
Figure 3B, where we show a barplot with the probabilities to
observe an haplotype at a frequency of 0.5% in the population
with a number of reads up to a given number of counts, both for
samples of size 400 and 1000. The probability to observe such
haplotype in a sample of size 400 with up to 2 reads is higher
than the probability to observe the same haplotype in a sample
of size 1000 with up to 5 reads.

According to this observation, after ﬁltering at noise level, the
small sample carries more information than the big sample. So

the clean big sample is not useful for rarefaction. Instead the
basis for rarefaction should be the raw big sample, including
all rare haplotypes and artifacts. At each rarefaction cycle, the
resampled reads should be ﬁltered previously to compute the di-
versity indices. An alternative strategy could be trimming the
haplotype fringes at noise level at a given conﬁdence level. The
effect of this additional ﬁltering is seen by comparing Figure 3A
and C. The bias of S, Sn and Mf is also greatly reduced
(Supplementary Fig. S3). To assess the sensitivity of this
method to small changes in the parameters, we explored the re-
sults ﬁltering at levels of 0.2 and 1%, and trimming at 80, 90 and
99% conﬁdence. Filtering deeper, into the noise level at 0.2%,
the differential bias is exacerbated for S and Sn, and a differential
bias is introduced in Mf. In these circumstances, the fringe trim-
ming alleviates both, the absolute and the differential bias, of S,
Sn and Mf, but does not completely cancel them. On the other
hand, ﬁltering well above noise level, at 1%, the absolute and the
differential bias are rather limited and the fringe trimming strat-
egy alone is able to compensate for the differential bias (See
Supplementary Materials Parameters Sensitivity.doc).

Finally to assess the generality of the two strategies (rarefy the
raw sampled data, and fringe trimming), we performed a pro-
spective simulation study using the Grinder program
(Angly et al. 2012) to simulate NGS data on the 18 clean haplo-
types of the high complexity population, with corresponding

frequencies. We used a linear error rate proﬁle with three differ-
ent mean error rates (0.15, 0.25 and 0.35%) and with three dif-
ferent slopes each. This simulation conﬁrmed that the fringe
trimming approach reduces both bias and differential bias,
with the rarefaction giving the minimum differential bias, but
showing higher absolute bias (See Supplementary Materials
Grinder Simulations.doc).

In conclusion, under the NGS sampling scheme the compari-
son of diversity indices—S, Sn and Mf—requires of rarefaction
or haplotypes fringe trimming above noise level. When the sizes
of the two samples being compared are markedly unbalanced,
the use of rarefaction should be preferred for S and Sn. The
fringe trimming sufﬁces for Mf in either case. The use of analyt-
ical formulations of rarefaction for S and Sn (Chao et al. 2013) is
not possible with NGS data as the abundance ﬁlter discards
singletons, doubletons and rare haplotypes in general.
Resampling should be used instead.

4 DISCUSSION

Quasispecies dynamics represents an important challenge for the
control of infectious diseases associated with RNA viruses and
some DNA viruses. In particular, we are interested in improved
molecular diagnosis of B and C hepatitis viruses, which are re-
sponsible for >500 million cases of chronic infections worldwide.

As strongly evidenced by recent reports, viral quasispecies com-
plexity, measured by diversity indices, has clear clinical relevance
in the course and prognosis of these diseases. Moreover, the ad-
equate diagnosis of quasispecies complexity has direct implica-
tions for antiviral treatment failure because of its reﬂection in
genetic barriers to resistance (Cheng et al., 2013; Homs et al.,
2011, 2012; Jacobson et al., 2011; Jardim et al., 2013; Liu et al.,
2011; Margeridon—Thermet et al., 2009, 2013; Nasu et al., 2011;
Nishijima et al., 2012; Perales et al., 2012; Poordad et al., 2011;
Powdrill et al., 2011; Sarrazin and Zeuzem, 2010; Solrnone et al.,
2009). Because of these reasons, it is paramount to establish a
standard method of measuring and comparing diversity indices
with statistic grounds and ﬁtted to the expected degrees of viral
quasispecies complexity.

We argue that the virus ﬁeld would beneﬁt of implementing
solutions already established in ecology to compare diversity
indices.

Useful connections between ecology and viral quasispecies
have been previously established. Self-organization of subpopu-
lations from a viral quasispecies that exhibited competition-col-
onization dynamics was approached by applying ecological
models of biodiversity in spatially structured habitats (Tilman,
1994). The study revealed that host cell killing by viruses can be
modulated by a trade-off between competition and colonization,
and suggested a model of virus virulence based on intramutant
spectrum interactions (Ojosnegros et al., 2010). Also niche theory
of competition communities and the replicator-mutator equation
were combined to show that a typical quasispecies proﬁle
required both competition and cooperation among variants
(Arbiza et al., 2010; Vignuzzi et al., 2006).

By a review of methods used in ecology that could be ap-
proached to describe RNA viral quasispecies, and thanks to
deep coverage amplicon UDPS data, which has been used as
source of in—silico sampling, we have studied the behavior and
statistical properties of S, Sn and Mf under the sampling schemes
of CCSS and NGS.

By CCSS, we may sample any virion with equal chance, but
their estimated frequency will never be lower than l/N, the
granularity or resolution of the device, where N is the number
of clones in the experiment. That is, when using 20 clones, no
observed haplotype will have an estimated frequency in the
population <5%. This granularity together with the high diver-
sity of RNA viruses causes a systematic bias in the estimation of
S and Sn. On the other hand, Mf does not suffer of estimation
bias. Another consideration for the CCSS method is that we lack
any means to control whether any of the observed clones are
artifactual or of low abundance. In a recently published study
(Ramirez et al., 2013), we compared experimentally a patient
sample of HBV sequenced in replicates by UDPS (two 454-
FLX+, one 454-FLX and one 454 Junior, in the forward and
reverse) and by 150 sequences obtained by CCSS. Among the 36
singleton haplotypes by CCSS, 10 were also identiﬁed by UDPS
in 5—8 of the UDPS replicates, and 24 could not be identiﬁed in
any of the replicates with 96 221 quality ﬁltered reads covering
the full amplicon. As an example, ﬁltering at 0.5% the high
complexity reference population, a 36.2% of the reads is
removed (Supplementary Table S1), which means that in CCSS
experiments, on this kind of viral populations, roughly one out

Box 1 Quasispecies diversity inference on S, Sn or Mf with CCSS samples

 

(1) Establish the signiﬁcance level.
(2) Specify the null and alternative hypotheses.

(3) For Mf compute variance and go to step 7. For S or Sn,
follow to next step.

(4) Use Chaol (Supplementary Equation SIII), or other meth-
ods to estimate the number of haplotypes in the popula-
tion from the distribution of haplotypes in the sample.

(5) Correct the bias in S or Sn by Hutcheson (Supplementary
Equation SII), preferably to the third term, using the esti-
mated number of haplotypes and the sample size.

(6) If the samples to be compared are unbalanced rarefy the
big sample to the size of the small one to obtain an esti-
mate of S or Sn and its variance. Use the observed value
and the computed variance for the small sample, and the
rareﬁed values of S or Sn and variance for the big sample.

(7) Test the null hypothesis by the Welch t-test
(Supplementary Equation SXI) and compute the CI.

 

of each three clones observed will correspond to haplotypes
<0.5% in the population.

Under the assumption that all observed clones are true
members of the population, we observed by this sampling
scheme that S and Sn are biased, and that the bias is sample
size-dependent. We also observed that S shows a better behavior
to analytical bias correction than Sn, and that Mf is an unbiased
estimator. A less biased comparison of S or Sn values between
samples requires of intra-sample normalization, composed of
terms of correction (Supplementary Equations S11 and S111).
When the sample sizes are unbalanced, the normalization requires
a rarefaction of the big sample to the small sample size as well.

On the other hand, NGS methods are highly sensitive and re-
producible but they are limited by the technical noise level. By
discarding observed haplotypes, our diversity estimates are biased
with respect to the true population values. We may nevertheless
consider the haplotypes below the 0.5% frequency in our example
as spurious or of low biological relevancy at the sampling time
point. In this case, we used the diversity values of the ﬁltered
population as gold standard, being the best we can achieve by
NGS. We observed a sample size-dependent bias on S, Sn and Mf.

The minimum differential bias is provided by rarefaction for S
and Sn. For Mf, fringe trimming provides an unbiased compari-
son. When the samples to be compared are not very unbalanced
and the abundance ﬁlter is above noise level, fringe trimming
could give good results for S, Sn and Mf.

The in—silico sampling and simulation allowed us to assess the
validity of the estimate and tests used in ecology when dealing
with viral quasispecies with S, Sn and Mf, and permitted to
identify the key points for less biased comparisons of complexity
indices under the same sampling scheme.

In this work, we have empirically studied the statistical proper-
ties of S, Sn and Mf while observing the quasispecies viral com-
plexity either by CCSS or by NGS, and through this we assessed

(2) Establish the signiﬁcance level.

(3) Specify the null and alternative hypotheses.

(4) Clean the NGS sequences by the method of choice.
(5) Trim haplotypes at the noise level, at 90% conﬁdence.

(Supplementary Equation SII), preferably to the third
term

(7) Compute variances by the theoretical expression.

tion before ﬁltering, as in Box 1.

the means for less biased comparisons of complexity indices.
These methods could allow us to statistically conclude whether
a viral quasispecies is expanding or contracting in diversity, in-
dependently of the size of the samples being compared.

In the Supplementary Material we give the formulation, and in
Boxes 1 and 2 we propose the methods of data treatment for
inference for each of the two methodologies, CCSS and NGS.

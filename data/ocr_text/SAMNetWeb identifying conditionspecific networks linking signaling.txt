Abstract

Motivation: High—throughput datasets such as genetic screens, mRNA expression assays and
global phospho—proteomic experiments are often difficult to interpret due to inherent noise in each
experimental system. Computational tools have improved interpretation of these datasets by ena—
bling the identification of biological processes and pathways that are most likely to explain the
measured results. These tools are primarily designed to analyse data from a single experiment
(e.g. drug treatment versus control), creating a need for computational algorithms that can handle
heterogeneous datasets across multiple experimental conditions at once.

Summary: We introduce SAMNetWeb, a web—based tool that enables functional enrichment ana—
lysis and visualization of high—throughput datasets. SAMNetWeb can analyse two distinct data
types (e.g. mRNA expression and global proteomics) simultaneously across multiple experimental
systems to identify pathways activated in these experiments and then visualize the pathways in a
single interaction network. Through the use of a multi—commodity flow based algorithm that re—
quires each experiment ‘share’ underlying protein interactions, SAMNetWeb can identify distinct
and common pathways across experiments.

Due to large consortium—based data collection efforts such as
ENCODE (Birney et al., 2007) and TCGA(TCGA Network, 2012),
the quantity of biological signaling data is growing at an astounding
rate. These data repositories release mRNA expression data, chro—
matin accessibility data, DNA sequencing data and proteomics data
for hundreds of tissues and thousands of patients. As a result, there
is a growing need for algorithms to meaningfully interpret diverse
types of data across experimental conditions such as different
diseases and tissues.

There are numerous network—based analysis tools (Tuncbag
et 61]., 2013; Yeger—Lotem et 61]., 2009), including their web—server
counterparts (Lan et 61]., 2011; Tuncbag et 61]., 2012) that perform
visualization and functional enrichment of high—throughput datasets
within a single experiment. These algorithms improve the functional

et 61]., 2012) by identifying ‘hidden’ nodes that are likely involved in
the experiment but not measured as changing. However, these tools
only analyse one experimental condition at a time, making visualiza—
tion of multiple networks cumbersome. Furthermore, when applied
to different perturbations in the same experimental system, these
algorithms select similar networks (Gosline et 61]., 2012).
SAMNetWeb is able to analyse multiple experiments by mapping
both signaling and transcriptomic datasets to the same underlying
protein—protein interaction network. Representing each experiment as
a ‘commodity’, the algorithm identifies common and distinct paths
between the two datasets for each experiment using the SAMNet
multi—commodity flow—based algorithm (Gosline et 61]., 2012). This
approach makes it easier to visualize multiple experiments in the
same network as well as enhances the ability to perform pathway

enrichment to identify biological processes perturbed in each
pathway. SAMNetWeb is implemented in an easy—to—use web server
interface that enables the experimentalist to analyse multiple high-
throughput experiments with both transcriptional and signaling data
from each experiment. The end result is the identification of pathways
shared between experiments and those unique to each experiment.

2 Description

SAMNetWeb analyses signaling and transcriptomic data from mul-
tiple experiments by mapping the data to a weighted graph and then
running a constrained optimization algorithm that selects the
combination of nodes and edges that best explains the observed
data. Protein—level signaling changes are mapped to a protein inter-
action network, which connects to mRNA expression changes via a
transcriptional regulatory network. Each edge in the network is
weighted by confidence, enabling the SAMNet algorithm to create a
reduced network that best explains the connections among the
inputs. Usage is described in Figure 1.

2.1 Required input
SAMNetWeb requires two sets of data, representing protein—level
signaling changes (Step 1) and mRNA expression changes (Step 2).
These data are uploaded to the web page in tab—delimited format.
Multiple experiments are accommodated by including an experi—
ment description in the first column (exp), next to the protein or
gene identifier (‘prot’ or ‘gene’, second column) and the weight
(third column) representing their measured change. The weight
allows the algorithm to prioritize inclusion of particular edges,
and can be set to the log—fold change across conditions or the signifi-
cance of the change [e.g. —log(P value)]. SAMNet processes the
inputs by taking the absolute value and normalizing the weights.
SAMNetWeb provides interaction networks to facilitate analysis.
The user can select from three protein-protein interaction networks
from established repositories (Step 3). The provided transcriptional
regulatory networks (Step 4) are derived from DNase I hypersensitive
clusters from the ENCODE consortium to predict protein—DNA
interactions using clusters of TRANSFAC motifs (MacIsaac et al.,

2010). We also provide two cell—line specific networks, derived from
DNase I hypersensitive regions from A549 cells (lung cancer cell line)
and MCF7 cells (breast cancer cell line). For each of these, edge
weights between transcription factors and mRNA are determined by
motif scores within hypersensitive regions 2kb upstream of the gene
transcription start site. When using only protein—level data in Step 2,
the transcriptional regulatory network is not necessary so the user
must check ‘use sink weights directly’ in Step 4.

Lastly, a user must select a value of Gamma to run the algorithm.
Gamma limits the number of nodes that can connect to the source.
Gamma : 0 results in an empty network, and the network solution
size will increase with Gamma until the network is saturated. We use
a default Gamma value of 14.0, but we recommend the user experi—
ment with a number of values to identify the best network.

2.2 SAMNetWeb results

Once the files are properly formatted they can be submitted (Step 5)
for analysis. Results are queued and processed within ~15 min and
displayed on a static web page. Users can download relevant
Cytoscape (Shannon et al., 2003) files, resulting DAVID enrichment
(Jiao et al., 2012) analysis and view the network using the
Cytoscape plug—in (Lopes et al., 2010).

We demonstrate the results of SAMNetWeb at http://fraenkel.
mit.edu/samnetweb/emt. In this analysis, we showcase the ability to
study multiple conditions at once by combining phospho—proteomic
measurements and mRNA expression measurements across four
experimental models of epithelial—mesenchymal transition (EMT).
The resulting network and DAVID enrichment demonstrate the
individual interactions predicted in each EMT model as well as the
biological processes that are enriched for each dataset.

3 Discussion

With the publication of more high—throughput datasets there is a
growing need for easy—to—use, integrative analysis tools.
SAMNetWeb is able to integrate signaling and transcriptomic data
across multiple experimental systems to facilitate hypothesis gener—
ation following initial high-throughput sequencing experiments. The
intuitive web—server interface and pre—formatted interaction net—
works make the algorithm useable without prior programming
knowledge. Furthermore, SAMNetWeb is very flexible in its inputs,
allowing the user to map any type of data to the interactome. This
ﬂexibility will enable SAMNetWeb to remain useful as new technol—
ogies are developed to analyse genome—wide data.

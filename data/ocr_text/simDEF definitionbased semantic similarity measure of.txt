Abstract

Motivation: Measures of protein functional similarity are essential tools for function prediction,
evaluation of protein—protein interactions (PPls) and other applications. Several existing methods
perform comparisons between proteins based on the semantic similarity of their GO terms; how—
ever, these measures are highly sensitive to modifications in the topological structure of GO, tend
to be focused on specific analytical tasks and concentrate on the GO terms themselves rather than
considering their textual definitions.

Results: We introduce simDEF, an efficient method for measuring semantic similarity of GO terms
using their GO definitions, which is based on the Gloss Vector measure commonly used in natural
language processing. The simDEF approach builds optimized definition vectors for all relevant
GO terms, and expresses the similarity of a pair of proteins as the cosine of the angle between
their definition vectors. Relative to existing similarity measures, when validated on a yeast reference
database, simDEF improves correlation with sequence homology by up to 50%, shows a correlation
improvement >4% with gene expression in the biological process hierarchy of GO and increases PPl
predictability by > 2.5% in F1 score for molecular function hierarchy.

1 Introduction

Gene Ontology (GO) (Ashburner et al., 2000) describes the attributes
of genes and gene products using a structured vocabulary. Many bio—
medical databases, such as UniProt (The UniProt Consortium, 2008)
and SwissProt (Boeckmann et al., 2003), are annotated by GO terms to
communicate semantic meanings of biomedical entities. Computing
functional similarity of biomedical entities has been applied to prob—
lems such as prediction of protein—protein interaction (PPI) (Pu et al.,
2015), gene expression studies (Ovaska, 2015) and homology analysis

(Piovesan et al., 2015). Also, in the context of text mining various
studies (Jin and Lu, 2010; Jin et al., 2011) have aimed to enhance the
literature—based GO annotation of gene products.

There are two main computational models available to measure
similarity of terms. Ontology-based models take advantage of lex—
ical structures in their estimation of term similarity. Edge—based
ontology measures like Wu (Wu and Palmer, 1994) and RSS (Wu
et al., 2006) consider the number of edges along the paths that link
two GO terms. Node—based measures (which we designate as

information—content—based), such as Resnik (1995), Jiang (Jiang and
Conrath, 1997), Lin (1998), Schlicker et al. (2006), TCSS (Jain and
Bader, 2010), GraSM (Couto et al., 2011) and AIC (Song et al.,
2014) compare the properties of the terms augmented with the prop—
erties of their ancestors or descendants. IC vectors (Pesaranghader
and Muthaiyah, 2013) represent IC values in distributed forms in
the computation of semantic similarity. Hybrid measures such as
those of Wang et al. (2007), Liu et al. (2009) and HRSS (Wu et al.,
2013) combine node—based and edge—based measures. While these
measures first compute semantic similarity of two gene products and
then aggregate the results as a single functional similarity value,
group—wise measures such as simUI (Falcon and Gentleman, 2007),
simGIC (Pesquita et al., 2007) and SORA (Teng et al., 2013) calcu—
late similarity by measuring two sets of GO terms annotating these
genes. Huang et al. (2007) also proposed a similarity measure where
gene functional similarity is based on vector representations of their
GO terms. Ontology—based measures suffer from three important
limitations: first, they depend on the constantly changing topo—
logical structure of GO; second, they use incomplete GO annota—
tions to compute statistical information; and third, they offer no
guarantee of generalization to multiple biological tasks.

Distributional-based approaches derive from Firth’s idea (1957)
that a term is characterized by the company it keeps in its context.
Measures following this notion calculate terms’ specifications from
relevant text data and represent them in a vector space for subsequent
computation of their similarities. The Gloss Vector semantic related—
ness measure (Pedersen et al., 2004) is a distributional—based approach
with a wide application in natural language processing. This measure
constructs definitions (glosses) of terms from a predefined thesaurus,
and estimates semantic relatedness of two terms as the cosine of the
angle between those terms’ gloss—vectors. Interpolation of content
words of a text corpus into the terms’ definition was shown to outper—
form the direct definition comparison. Gloss vectors offer a new op—
portunity to exploit the information of GO term definitions and to
infer gene functional similarity. Liu et al. (2012) successfully applied
the Gloss Vector measure to the biomedical domain using MEDLINE
as the text corpus and the unified medical language system and
WordNet for the construction of extended definitions of medical con-
cepts. The Gloss Vector approach requires a frequency cut—off in se—
lecting the best features describing one term (Pesaranghader et al.,
2013, 2014a). We have developed simDEF, an optimized version of
the Gloss Vector targeted to analysis of gene functions. Here, by using
MEDLINE as the text corpus, we compare the performance of
simDEF with other leading approaches, and demonstrate its effective—
ness using comparisons based on sequence homology, gene expression
and PPI data.

2 Experimental data

2.1 GO and GO annotations

GO comprises three GOs which express different biological attri-
butes: biological process (BP) for processes such as metabolism
or cell proliferation; cellular component (CC) such as the nucleus
or cell membrane; and molecular function (MF) such as catalytic
or binding activities. G0 is maintained and constantly updated by a
group of curators.

A GO annotation consists of a GO term associated with a specific
reference and an evidence code to indicate how a given annotation is
supported. Out of all the evidence codes available, Inferred from
Electronic Annotation (IEA) is not assigned by a curator and is thus
the least reliable so we treat them separately. GO and the required GO

annotations were downloaded from the GO website (http://geneontol
ogy.org (November 2, 2015).

2.2 MEDLINE abstracts

MEDLINE (https://mbr.nlm.nih.gov/Download/) contains over 20
million citations of biomedical articles from 1966 to the present.
The database includes journal articles from medicine, pharmacy,
dentistry, nursing, healthcare and covers the literature in biology
and biochemistry. For this study, we used MEDLINE 2013 as the
corpus to build a first—order word—word co—occurrence matrix for
the later computation of second—order co—occurrence (SOC) matrices
which are used by simDEF.

2.3 Validation datasets

2.3.1 Sequence homology

We used bitscores from the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool
(BLAST) (Altschul et al., 1997) to create our sequence homology
dataset. In the first step, we performed an all—versus—all comparison
of proteins in the yeast Saccloaromyces cerez/isiae database (Cherry
et al., 1998) with an expectation—value threshold of 0.1. Although
this threshold is liberal, the corresponding bitscores associated with
e—values near this threshold will be very low and have a minimal ef-
fect on our analysis. Since a bitscore for query and subject proteins
is not symmetrical, we calculate log—reciprocal BLAST score (LRBS)
and relative reciprocal BLAST score (RRBS) to express the general
sequence similarity of protein pairs. For proteins A and B, the LRBS
and RRBS are

 

LRBS(A, B) 2 log (B1tscore(A, B) —l— B1tscore(B, A)>7 (1)

2

_ Bitscore(A, B) —l— Bitscore(B, A)
_ Bitscore(A, A) —l— Bitscore(B, B) ’

 

RRBS(A, B) (2)

Finally, after LRBS and RRBS computations, we have a dataset
of 20 167 protein pairs from the yeast S.cerez/isiae database along
with their LRBS and RRBS sequence similarity scores. All proteins
in the dataset have their own GO annotations from the CC, BP and
MF ontologies without considering IEAs.

2.3.2 Gene expression

The gene expression dataset comes from the study by Jain and Bader
(2010). In their study, the gene—expression dataset for S.cerez/isiae
was downloaded from GeneMANIA (Warde—Farley et al., 2010)
and other microarray experiments. The authors prepared test data—
sets of 5000 S.cerez/isiae gene pairs randomly selected from a list of
all possible pairs of proteins in their gene expression dataset. This
was done independently for CC, BP and MF annotations of gene
products. Since in our experiments we mainly consider genes with
non—electronic annotations, we used 4800 fitting gene pairs from
their study.

2.3.3 Protein—protein interaction

For the PPI experiment, we employed subsets of the yeast PPI dataset
from Wu et al. (2013). In that study, for each GO, independent
gold—standard positive datasets for yeast were built from a core sub—
set of the Database of Interacting Proteins (DIP) (Salwinski et al.,
2004). Negative datasets were independently generated by randomly
choosing annotated protein pairs in BP, CC and MF, which are ab—
sent from a combined dataset of all possible PPIs. Since for different
GOs the numbers of generated PPI pairs are different and more im-
portantly many of them do not have GO annotations after excluding

IEA, we selected subsets of 3000 positive and 3000 negative PPIs for
each ontology from that study to evaluate our measure against other
similarity measures in a PPI prediction task.

3 Methods

Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) is a measure of association
used in information theory. In computational linguistics, the PMI
for two given words indicates the likelihood of finding one word in
a text document that includes the other word. PMI is formulated as

Mil/1:102)

PMI(w1, wz) = logm’

(3)

where [)(w1, w2) is the probability that words wl and wz co—occur
in a document, and [)(u/1) and [)(u/Z) for wl and Leg, respectively, are
the marginal probabilities of their occurrence in a document. It is ex—
pected that rare words are highly associated with and descriptive of
each other, yet due to their sparse nature their bigram frequency (i.e.
number of times they have been seen next to each other) is small in
the corpus. This is the main drawback of the Gloss Vector measure
in selection of the best descriptive features.

We use PMI in our proposed measure, simDEF, for statistical
elimination of insignificant features (words). simDEF requires pro—
cedures for building the co—occurrence matrix from a proper text
corpus, constructing extended definitions for GO terms using GO
term definitions, and finding words that are appropriate descriptors
of that GO term. simDEF comprises six steps (Fig. 1) (see
Supplementary Material for pseudocode of the steps laid out in
simDEF).

3.1 Step 1—counting bigrams and building the first—
order co—Occurrence matrix

After discarding punctuation, changing all characters to lowercase,
and removing stop words (a pre—defined list of 204 non-informative
words like a and the) from the MEDLINE corpus, a list of bigrams
and their frequencies for all the content words is constructed. A win—
dow size of 2 is used for extraction of bigrams. This window size

Fig. 1. Computation of the simDEF semantic similarity measure

controls how close two words can appear in bigrams. Stemming was
found to reduce accuracy and was not adopted in simDEF. Then, by
ignoring the order of occurrence in a bigram, we transform it from a
bigram list to a co—occurrence list. Finally, we construct the first—
order co—occurrence matrix, which is symmetric and sparse and rep—
resents the contextual information of MEDLINE words. Cell values
in the first-order matrix represent how many times the word associ—
ated with its row is seen in this corpus alongside the word associated
with its column.

3.2 Step 2—definition construction of GO terms and
then building BP, CC, and MF definition matrices

In this step, we construct an extended definition for every term in GO.
From the theoretical perspective, definition extension of parent GO
terms (i.e. broader concepts) with their children’s definitions (i.e. nar-
rower and more specific definitions) adds more specific information.
Although child GO terms may contain contradictory information, this
information may nonetheless provide essential context when calculat—
ing functional similarity with other genes (which may in turn be aug—
mented with conﬂicting information). From the practical perspective,
we examined all the combinations of definition extension considering
GO relationships such as is_a, bas_part, part_of, regulates, siblings
and synonyms. What is represented in Figure 2 yielded the best re—
sults in our experiments conducted in this study. Improvement in the
results using relationships such as part_of and regulates indicates
that besides the similarity, simDEF accounts for relatedness as
well. See Supplementary material for more in—depth explanation of
why definition extension can be beneficial.

Each GO term has an identifier, a representative name, a G0 defin—
ition, a namespace defining the sub—ontology of the GO term and other
information such as its relationship to the other GO terms. For ex—
ample, GO:0001104 has the representative name ‘RNA polymerase II
transcription cofactor activity’ and belongs to the MF hierarchy. This
GO term has the definition ‘Interacting selectively and non—covalently
with an RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) regulatory transcription factor
and also with the RNAP II basal transcription machinery in order to
modulate transcription. Cofactors generally do not bind DNA, but ra—
ther mediate PPIs between regulatory transcription factors and the
basal RNAP II transcription machinery.’ In order to make this defin-
ition even richer we concatenate definitions of its direct parents (i.e.
GO:0003712 or ‘transcription cofactor activity’ and GO:0001076 or
‘RNA polymerase II transcription factor binding transcription factor
activity’) and direct children (i.e. GO:0001105 or ‘RNA polymerase II
transcription co—activator activity’ and GO:0001106 or ‘RNA poly—
merase II transcription co—repressor activity’) to its definition. We also
add this GO term’s representative name to this extended definition con—
sidering this name as part of its own definition. This process is done for

all GO terms in BP, CC and MF. Now we see that for each word in the
definition of a GO term we have an associated first—order co—occur—
rence vector calculated in Step 1. After changing all characters to low—
ercase and removing punctuation and stop words from these extended
definitions we store them in different matrices for three different sub—
ontologies. In these matrices, the value of a cell represents how many
times the word associated with its column appears in the definition of
the GO term associated with its row.

3.3 Step 3—building SOC matrices

To build the SOC vector for a GO term we sum the first—order co—
occurrence vectors from the words in the constructed definition of
that GO term (i.e. compute the centroid), and then normalize the re-
sult vector by the number of words in the definition. We do this pro-
cess separately for each GO. The results are three different matrices
for BP, CC and MF; each row again represents a GO term and fea—
tures are the words. We have three SOC matrices for BP, CC and
MF at the end of this step.

3.4 Step 4—PMI on SOC matrices (PMI—on—SOC
matrices)

In our similarity measure, PMI—on—SOC matrices replace a conven—
tional approach of low— and high—frequency cut—offs for detection of
insignificant features or words in the Gloss Vector measure. We stat—
istically measure the level of association between GO terms and
their describing features in the SOC matrices and then apply a cut—
off threshold on this level in the next step. Following (3), here,
PMI(t,-, wj) measures the level of association between GO term i and
feature j to discover how descriptive the word j of that GO term is.
PMI is biased toward low—frequency words and consequently tends
to favor them by assigning them a higher degree of importance
(Pesaranghader et al., 2013); in order to resolve this weakness, we
employ the add—one technique. Before applying PMI on a matrix, all
the elements of the matrix are incremented by 1 unit.

3.5 Step 5—removing insignificant features from the
PMI—on—SOC vectors

Defining a PMI threshold allows us to skip those words which pro—
vide low information for GO terms in their constructed PMI—on—
SOC vectors. By using the available dataset in an iterative way, we
gradually increase the threshold of PMI cut—off from zero and then
evaluate the results generated by simDEF. Depending on the bio-
medical task, for a chosen cut—off threshold, criteria such as
Pearson’s correlation or AUC (see Section 4.3) can be used for the
performance evaluation of the estimated similarity results. In gen—
eral, as cut—off thresholds increase we tend to get better results until
a point where performance starts to drop rapidly. Therefore, by re—
cording this curve for different performance results and cut—off
points we try to find the optimal cut—off point in order to keep only
those informative features describing one GO term. Also, to avoid
this interval being sensitive to the choice of dataset, we use 5—fold
cross validation to predict the extent to which the threshold will
generalize to an independent dataset. This cut—off selection is done
separately for the three constructed PMI—on—SOC matrices of the BP,
CC and MF ontologies.

3.6 Step 6—calculating semantic similarity

In this final step, the semantic similarity among GO terms is esti—
mated. The cosine of the angle between optimized PMI—on—SOC vec—
tors of two GO terms will indicate the degree of similarity for those
terms. For the final usage of the measure, the last produced matrix is

loaded into memory and used for measuring similarity between GO
terms. In these matrices, each row stores the calculated optimized
definition vector of its associated GO term.

As, in most cases, gene products are annotated with more than
one GO term in the same ontology hierarchy (BP, CC or MF), there
are several methods to measure the functional similarity of gene
products based on the semantic similarity of these GO terms. MAX
and AVE define functional similarity between gene products as the
maximum or average semantic similarity values, respectively, over
the GO terms annotating the genes. MAX has been shown to be
more useful for a PPI task (Wu et al., 2006). If TA and TB are the
sets of GO terms which annotate proteins A and B, respectively, the
MAX for their functional similarity measurement is achieved by

simMAX(A,  = Haj/£1226qu (sim(t1, t2». 

The best—match average (BMA) method is found to be the best
for evaluation of semantic similarity measures and the correlation of
its results with sequence homology and gene expression data
(Pesquita et al., 2008). BMA for two gene products A and B with n
and m GO annotations is given by

, 1 1 . 1 .
51mBMA(A, B) = Z (n  (51m(t1,t2)) + a  (Slm(t1, t2))) .

t1 ETA t2 6TB

(5)

Consider that in these formulae TA of different ontologies would
be different (likewise for TB). Therefore, we will achieve three differ—
ent protein functional similarity values for three different gene
ontologies.

MAX and BMA measure similarity between two gene products
by combining semantic similarities between their terms. Semantic
similarity estimation was used to evaluate the Resnik, Lin, Jiang,
GraSM, Wang, AIC and simDEF measures (see Supplementary ma
terial for definitions and formulas). In contrast, groupwise measures
like simGIC and simUI are functional similarity measures by nature
and do not rely on combining similarities between individual terms
to assess gene product similarity, but calculate it directly by their an-
notation sets. By employing GO annotations for the previous meas—
ures and MEDLINE for the simDEF as the needed corpora, we
implemented these measures as appropriate, and reported results
alongside the best cut—off point for feature removal in each task.

4 Results

4.1 Correlation with sequence similarity

Several authors have compared the performance of different seman-
tic similarity measures by testing how well these measures correlate
with sequence similarity. Various studies (Lord et al., 2003) showed
that the more similar two sequences are the more similar their onto—
logical annotations will be.

To evaluate the semantic similarity measures, we used two dis—
tinct sequence similarity measures: LRBS and RRBS with the formu-
lae of (1) and (2). LRBS is similar to the sequence similarity measure
used previously by Lord, but compensates for the fact that BLAST
scores are not symmetric. RRBS, suggested by Joshi and Xu (2007),
is another indicator of functional similarity acting like the sequence
identity percentage by taking amino acid substitutions into account.
Figure 3 shows the degree of correlation between LRBS and the
functional similarity estimations calculated by semantic measures of
20 167 protein pairs (without IEAs included).

A.Pesaranghader et al.

 

In all cases, whether we use MAX or BMA, simDEF correlates
with sequence similarity better than the other IC—based measures.
The high correlation between simDEF and LRBS in the MF ontology
is notable as it is more than the twice of the second best measure’s
result (Jiang). Supplementary Table S1 shows the exact numerical
results of this experiment (with and without IEAs).

The other metric used for sequence similarity measurement is
RRBS which is not directly affected by sequence length (unlike
LRBS). We assessed whether the dependency on sequence length af—
fects the outcome of the evaluation. Figure 2 shows the degree of
correlation between the similarity estimations calculated by seman—
tic measures and RRBS. RRBS, like LRBS, shows the highest degree
of correlation with simDEF among the similarity measures.

In general, measures of functional similarity correlate more with
LRBS sequence similarity than RRBS. We also observe among IC—
based measures tested here that no single measure is superior to all
others in the BP, CC and MF ontologies, which suggests task—de—
pendency of these measures. AIC, the latest variant of IC—based
measures, does not offer any improvement over the earlier measures.
The Wang topological measure of similarity works only slightly bet-
ter than the IC—based measures in the RRBS sequence similarity
comparison of BP. The correlation results for LRBS and RRBS also
demonstrate that BMA is the appropriate metric for functional simi-
larity measurement of proteins from BP and CC points of view
when we use IC—based measures while for simDEF in CC it is re-
verse. The difference between results generated by BMA and MAX
for simDEF is typically small, whereas other pairwise semantic simi—
larity measures tend to show larger discrepancies. Supplementary
Table S2 shows the exact results of this experiment.

4.2 Correlation with gene expression
Correlation with gene expression is another desirable criterion (e.g.
Pesaranghader et al., 2014b). Since genes involved in the same pro—
cess tend to exhibit similar expression patterns, we could expect
good semantic similarity estimations calculated on the BP ontology
to be correlated with the expression similarity (Yang et al., 2012).
For our experiments, the evaluation is done against the available
standard reference of 4800 gene expression values. Here, we report
Pearson’s correlation between gene expression data and the results
from simGIC, simUI and BMA of pairwise measures. We focus on
the BMA criterion as it always gave higher correlations. Pearson’s
correlation between gene expression and semantic measures for CC,
BP and MF ontologies with and without IEAs considered are shown
in Table 1.

The highest correlations in all cases are seen with the CC ontol—
ogy, followed by BP and MF. Although the difference in correlation
coefficients is not as striking as in the homology example, simDEF

outperforms the next best method, GraSM, by 4% on the BP ontol—
ogy and 1—2% on the CC ontology. GraSM has the best correlation
for MF, 1—2% better than simDEF, which was also outperformed
by the Resnik. Correlation coefficients were generally higher for
datasets with IEAs, suggesting that electronic annotations have
some value when investigating gene—expression profiles.

Wang et al. (2004) and Sevilla et al. (2005) showed that the cor—
relation between gene expression and semantic similarity was negli-
gible when semantic similarity values were low, but the two
measures were highly related when semantic similarity was high. Xu
et al. (2008) further showed a linear relationship for gene pairs with
high levels of expression correlation. We examined this trend by
comparing Resnik against simDEF for variable numbers of the high-
est correlated genes. For this purpose, after sorting gene expression
data from the highest to the lowest values, we measured correlation
of these data with Resnik and simDEF as we go from the top corre—
lated expressions to the bottom. Figure 4 demonstrates the trend of
change for this test.

Considering other studies’ findings and our result demonstrated
in Figure 4, we see that by being more focused on high—correlated
gene expression pairs the overal correlation between functional simi-
larity and gene expression increase only when we take the BP ontol—
ogy into account. For CC and MF the reverse is true. The other
important point learned for BP is that by employing simDEF as se-
mantic measure, when we ignore electronic annotation we get better
correlation with highly—correlated gene expression data while this is
not true for Resnik. Moreover, we observe that for BP and CC
simDEF works better than Resnik no matter which subset we con—
sider. Nevertheless, this issue does not hold for MF and we only get
better results from simDEF when we focus on higher correlated
genes in terms of their expression.

4.3 Comparison with PPls

Semantic similarity can also be used as an indicator for the plausibil—
ity of putative PPIs, as proteins that interact in the cell in vivo are ex—
pected to participate in similar cellular locations and BPs. Like other
studies (Jain and Bader, 2010; Wu et al., 2013), we formulated this
as a classification problem and checked how well the different se—
mantic similarity measures perform for predicting true PPIs. For this
purpose, the MAX and BMA results are directly interpreted as the
classification probability of ‘Interaction’ and ‘Not Interaction’. The
higher this value is, the higher the probability of interaction will be.
We applied this approach to a dataset of 6000 PPI pairs for each
GO while half of the data have positive labels (due to experimentally
confirmed PPIs) and the other half have negative labels.

Fig. 4. Relationship of gene expression correlation and semantic similarity in
three GO ontologies. X: 500 means that only the 500 most highly correlated
gene pairs were considered when generating the correlation scores

In our evaluation, the results of prediction were investigated by
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, with area under the
curve (AUC) as the main accuracy criterion. Here, we report only
MAX since, as we expected from the previous studies, for all the
cases MAX predicted better results compared with BMA. Table 2
shows the values of AUC for different semantic measures, including
a hybrid measure that uses the average of the simDEF and Resnik
values as the probability of interaction.

As in the gene expression case, we found that including IEA re-
cords from GO improved the accuracy (in this case, the AUC).
simDEF gave the highest accuracy when the BP and MF ontologies
were used, while Resnik and GraSM performed best for CC. The hy—
brid classifier’s AUC results are represented in the last row of Table 2.
This result shows that simDEF is useful on all three ontologies,
whether alone or as a complement to the Resnik measure. We believe
different approaches of simDEF and IC—based semantic measures in
similarity estimation is the main reason for this improvement. With
consideration of IEA, the ROC for CC ontology shown in Figure 5
represents that the combination of Resnik and simDEF benefits from
the results of simDEF and Resnik both.

ROC is not always the only best approach to evaluate a classi—
fier’s performance in a PPI task (Jain and Bader, 2010; Wu et al.,
2013). Therefore, in our second experiment, by keeping the feature

measure, and including IEA in the evaluation, we calculated differ—
ent F1—scores for different classification cut—off points in the
simDEF, Resnik and hybrid measures. Then, we compared the cal—
culated mean and maximum F1—score values. While the mean and
maximum F1—scores can be indicators of one classifier’s perform—
ance in the detection of positive interactions (similar to AUC),
maximum F1-score also helps in selection of the best classification
cut—off point of a classifier having its ROC curve. The mean and
maximum F1-score results are shown in Table 3.

The simDEF prediction of PPIs based on the F1—score is always bet—
ter than the results achieved by Resnik. Even though Resnik gave the
best AUC for the CC ontology, the simDEF mean F1-score is

considerably higher than that of Resnik, while the maximum scores dif-
fer by < 1%. For the other two ontologies the improved mean of the
F1-scores in the simDEF measure against Resnik is notable. For MF
the difference between max F1-score in the hybrid measure is >2.5%
compared with Resnik’s F1—score itself. We also see this improvement
in the result is due more to simDEF than to the Resnik measure.

5 Discussion

Our approach to similarity estimation based on shared context
makes intuitive sense, as concepts which share closely related attri—
butes in their representation should exhibit high levels of similarity.
We have shown that implementing these ideas via the Gloss Vector
representation yields improved effectiveness across the majority of
ontologies and problem types. For the yeast database, simDEF in—
creases the correlation of semantic similarity with sequence hom-
ology by 5 0%, yields an increase of > 4% in correlation with gene
expression on the BP ontology, and improves the PPI prediction F1-
score by >2.5 % on the MF ontology.

A key advantage of simDEF in comparison with IC—based measures
is its reduced dependency on annotation data, and the GO structure.
New GO terms typically do not have rich annotation information,
which can inﬂuence the IC calculation of all GO terms as they depend
on the root frequency which itself depends on all GO term frequencies.
In contrast, simDEF needs to access only the direct parents and children
of one GO term to expand that GO term’s definition.

In future work, simDEF can be evaluated against Enzyme
Commission (EC) and protein family (Pfam) similarities. Gene clus—
tering and orthologous protein distinguishing tasks present yet an—
other opportunity for simDEF performance evaluation. simDEF
needs to be tested on the other species than S.cerez/isiae as well.
Moreover, other statistical measures of association, such as Chi—
square and log—lokelihood, can be examined in replacement of PMI
for further improvement of simDEF. More in—depth studies can also
find out if using larger window sizes of bigrams or even tri-grams in
the word extraction of MEDLINE abstracts would improve the
achieved results. Also, current advancement in deep neural networks
for the low—dimensional yet more accurate representation of GO
terms leaves room for further investigation of semantic similarity
measures in the distributional model.

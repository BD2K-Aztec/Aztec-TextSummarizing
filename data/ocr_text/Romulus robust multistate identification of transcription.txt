Abstract

Motivation: Computational prediction of transcription factor (TF) binding sites in the genome re-
mains a challenging task. Here, we present Romulus, a novel computational method for identifying
individual TF binding sites from genome sequence information and cell-type—specific experimental
data, such as DNase-seq. It combines the strengths of previous approaches, and improves robust-
ness by reducing the number of free parameters in the model by an order of magnitude.

Results: We show that Romulus significantly outperforms existing methods across three sources
of DNase-seq data, by assessing the performance of these tools against ChlP-seq profiles. The dif-
ference was particularly significant when applied to binding site prediction for low-information-
content motifs. Our method is capable of inferring multiple binding modes for a single TF, which
differ in their DNase I cut profile. Finally, using the model learned by Romulus and ChlP-seq data,
we introduce Binding in Closed Chromatin (BCC) as a quantitative measure of TF pioneer factor ac-
tivity. Uniquely, our measure quantifies a defining feature of pioneer factors, namely their ability to
bind closed chromatin.

1 Introduction

Eukaryotic transcription is an extremely complex process, controlled
by transcription factor (TF) binding to regulatory elements in multiple
locations in the genome. The traditional method of analyzing individ-
ual active regulatory elements in the genome involves the digestion by
DNase I and subsequent identification of regions where TFs are bound
to the DNA fragment and protect the DNA from degradation by the
enzyme. These protected sites, or TF footprints, can be identified on a
large scale by a more recent protocol, DNase I digestion followed by
high-throughput sequencing (DNase-seq) (Crawford et al. , 2006).

CENTIPEDE (Pique-Regi et al., 2011) was the first algorithm
aimed at combining sequence information with chromatin state data
to identify the sites where a particular TF was bound in the genome.
This method relied on the presence of a DNA sequence motif at candi-
date binding sites. A logistic regression model allowed for multiple
types of prior information to be incorporated, e.g. Position Weight
Matrix (PWM) score, distance to the nearest Transcription Start Site
and sequence evolutionary conservation. The posterior component
consisted of a combination of negative binomial and multinomial pos-
itional models for each type of experimental data, such as DNase-seq
or histone modification ChIP-seq. Overall, the main strength of

CENTIPEDE is the ability to identify binding sites for multiple TFs
from a single DNase-seq experiment.

MILLIPEDE (Luo and Hartemink, 2013), a method inspired by
CENTIPEDE, also aims at identifying TF binding sites, and also com-
bines DNase digestion data with TF binding specificity information,
but performs the analysis in a supervised manner. The supervised ap-
proach allows for the model to be explicitly trained to discriminate
bound and unbound sites, but requires to provide such a classification
as input. The method of MILLIPEDE is a simplification of the
CENTIPEDE approach. Instead of a comprehensive combination of
negative binomial and multinomial models to represent the positional
distribution of DNase I cuts, these cuts were grouped into several (e.g.
5 or 12) bins. The log-transformed DNase I cut counts within these
bins were incorporated in the logistic regression model, together with
all the prior information. Overall, the number of parameters in
MILLIPEDE is at least an order of magnitude smaller than in
CENTIPEDE. The authors showed that MILLIPEDE outperforms
CENTIPEDE marginally in human but dramatically in yeast. This
was attributed mostly to avoiding over-fitting of parameters by focus-
ing on a more coarse-grained set of features, capturing the large-scale
differences between the bound and unbound states. The selection of
optimal discriminative features is a hallmark of another similar
method, BinDNase (Kahara and Lahdesmaki, 2015), which also fol-
lows the supervised approach and outperforms MILLIPEDE.

Wellington (Piper et al., 2013) is another recent algorithm to pre-
dict occupied TF binding sites from DNase-seq data. This algorithm
is based on a completely different approach, and does not require a
DNA sequence motif to identify the prior set of candidate binding
sites. Instead, Wellington quantifies an imbalance in the DNA
strand-specific alignment information of DNase-seq data around
virtually every location in the genome. The authors argue that in a
‘double hit’ DNase-seq experiment, where each end of a DNA frag-
ment represents an in vivo DNase I cleavage site, most of the DNA
fragments captured for sequencing are in the order of 50—150 bp in
length, and they are expected to originate from within the DNase I
hypersensitive sites, as opposed to nucleosomal DNA.

Since the length of DNase I hypersensitive sites is usually 200—
250 bp, the captured fragments are likely to span the regions of DNA
protected by bound TFs. These captured fragments manifest them-
selves after sequencing as 5’ sequence tags, representing just one end
of these fragments. Hence, a typical DNase I hypersensitive site should
be enriched in forward strand tags upstream and in reverse strand tags
downstream of bound TFs. Wellington takes advantage of this strand
imbalance criterion to greatly increase the specificity by reducing the
number of false positives. For each basepair, Wellington tests the hy-
pothesis that there are significantly more reads aligning to the forward
strand in the upstream shoulder region with respect to the reads align-
ing to the forward strand in the footprint region. Moreover, a reverse
complement hypothesis is tested, i.e. that there are significantly more
reads aligning to the reverse strand in the downstream shoulder region
with respect to the reads aligning to the reverse strand in the footprint
region. The final Wellington P-value for a given genomic location is a
product of the two for the aforementioned hypotheses.

None of the existing methods mentioned above allows for direct
incorporation of knowledge about TF complexes which could be
formed by the TF of interest. The comprehensive knowledge of such
functional structures is essential to fully understand the mechanisms
of transcriptional regulation. Recently, several computational meth-
ods are focused on the identification of the putative structures of TF
complexes that bind cooperatively to DNA, using ChIP-seq
(Whitington et al., 201 1) or chromatin accessibility data (Jankowski
et al., 2014; Kazemian et al., 2013). Such a prior information on TF

complex structures should be incorporated by the methods aimed at
identification of individual TF binding sites.

Here, we propose Romulus, a novel computational method to ac-
curately identify TF footprints from genome sequence information and
cell-type—specific experimental data, such as DNase-seq data. Our ap-
proach combines the strengths of CENTIPEDE and Wellington, while
keeping the number of free parameters in the model relatively low. For
a given TF, we first identify candidate binding sites that have above-
background sequence affinity, using a Position Weight Matrix. Then,
following CENTIPEDE, we employ an Expectation—Maximization-
based approach to simultaneously learn the DNase I cut profiles and
classify the binding sites as bound or unbound by the TF.

Our method allows for multiple bound states for a single TF, dif-
fering in their cut profile and overall number of DNase I cuts. To
make the model robust, we employ a systematic approach to group
the DNase I cuts, according to their location and strand. Inspired by
Wellington, we take the forward strand DNase I cuts only upstream
and within the binding site, while the reverse strand DNase I cuts
only within the binding site and downstream. We model the total
number of cuts as a negative binomial component, while the cut dis-
tribution (regularized by binning outside the binding site) is mod-
elled as a multinomial component.

Overall, Romulus predictions agree well with experimental ChIP-
seq measurements of TF binding at candidate motif instances. We also
comprehensively compared the predictive performance of Romulus,
CENTIPEDE and Wellington, and show that Romulus significantly
outperformed CENTIPEDE and Wellington, especially when applied
to DNase-seq datasets with lower sequencing depth. Finally, we intro-
duce Binding in Closed Chromatin (BCC), a single statistic represent-
ing the chromatin state component of Romulus for ChIP-seq—inferred
binding sites, as a quantitative correlate of pioneer factor activity.

2 Methods

2.1 DNase-seq data from multiple sources

The ENCODE Project (Bernstein et al., 2012) provides three
different tracks with human DNase-seq data. The track
ngncodeOpenChromDnase from Duke University (Duke) follows
the ‘single hit’ protocol (Boyle et al., 2008), while ngncoderDnase
and ngncoderDgf, both from University of Washington (UW), fol-
low the ‘double hit’ protocol (Sabo et al., 2006). The latter track,
termed Digital Genomic Footprinting (DGF) yields much higher num-
ber of sequencing reads (Supplementary Table S1). We used all tracks
in three cell types: A549, HepG2 and K562.

2.2 ChIP-seq data as a TF binding benchmark

We downloaded a collection of human ChIP-seq datasets (narrowPeak
files) from ENCODE and used them as a gold standard for benchmark-
ing TF binding predictions (Supplementary Table 52). This collection of
datasets was also used to assess the performance of Wellington in (Piper
et al., 2013). The corresponding DNA sequence motifs (Supplementary
Table S3) for these TFs were taken from the HOMER (Hypergeometric
Optimization of Motif EnRichment) suite (Heinz et al., 2010).

The motif instances in the human genome for these motifs were
downloaded from http://homer.salk.edu/homer/ (HOMER Known
Motifs track). We considered these motif instances as candidate
binding sites (test cases) in performance assessment of the three
methods. The reference classification of the candidate binding sites

was obtained as follows: motif instances overlapping any ChIP-seq
peak were classified as bound, and all the remaining ones were clas-
sified as unbound.

2.3 Prior probabilities of TF binding

The prior component of the model captures the genomic sequence
and other prior (i.e. independent of cell type or conditions) charac-
teristics of the candidate binding site for a given TF. Let us denote
by i a particular genomic instance (motif match) of a motif of inter-
est. Typically, the prior characteristics assigned to motif instances
could be: the respective PWM score, average evolutionary conserva-
tion and so on.

To formalize the model, let us denote the value of the jth prior
characteristic for motif instance 2' by a real number xim, where 1 S j
S ]. In the simplest case, where each motif instance can be either
‘bound’ or ‘unbound’, we apply a logistic approach to model the
ratio of the prior probabilities:

P(z,- = 1)/P(Z,- = 0) = expwo + gig-x20").

Here, Z,- = 1 indicates that the ith motif instance is bound,
whereas Z: 0 indicates that it remains unbound. Such a model has
been used in CENTIPEDE (Pique-Regi et al., 201 1).

We generalize the above-described model. Let us consider a TF
that manifests one or more cooperative binding modes, with well-
defined offsets and orientations within the underlying motif com-
plexes. The cooperative binding modes, and the corresponding
motif complexes, will be both denoted by k =2, . . ., K + 1, where
K is the number of cooperative binding modes. Each of these com-
plexes imposes certain offset and orientation of the partner motif
with respect to the primary motif (Jankowski et al., 2013, 2014).
The genomic location of the motif instance 2' therefore implies the
corresponding locations for all partner motifs within all defined
motif complexes. The prior characteristics for these partner motif
instances are calculated no matter how unfavourable they may be
for binding, and are included in the sequence xi”), where 1 S j S ].
Note that in the homodimer case, some of these characteristic may
be derived from the same PWM, however scored at a different gen-
omic location.

Now let us focus on a particular cooperative binding mode k,
where 2 S k S K + 1. We introduce binary indicators 12}- (k) 6 {0,1},
specifying whether the prior characteristic xim should be taken into
account in a cooperative binding mode k. The values of these indica-
tors ensure that only the characteristics specific to the primary motif
instance and to the partner motif instances within lath motif complex
will be taken into account. The monomer binding mode, denoted by
k = 1, should be characterized only by the characteristics referring to
the primary motif instance. Hence, 12,-(1) = 0 for all the characteris-
tics j referring to any of the partner motifs. To model the prior prob-
abilities, we apply a logistic model against the unbound ‘pivot’ case
of Z,- = 0:

P(Zi = I€)/1)(Zi = 0) = CXPWOUQ) + Ziﬁj(k)l’j(k)xi(j)),

where Z,- = 0 indicates no binding, Z,- = 1 refers to binding as mono-
mer, and Z: 2, . . ., K + 1 refer to the respective cooperative bind-
ing modes. This way, we have K + 1 outcomes separately regressed
against the pivot outcome Z,- = 0 (see Supplementary Methods).

2.4 Chromatin state component
The chromatin state component of the model captures the cell-type—
specific and condition-specific experimental data around the

candidate binding sites. Typically, these experimental data will in-
clude DNase-seq or histone modification ChIP-seq profiles. In this
study, we use DNase-seq profiles around the candidate binding sites,
but other types of data might be used as well.

For each motif instance 2', we consider the numbers of DNase I
cuts at individual basepairs in the vicinity in a strand-specific man-
ner. The forward strand cuts are taken only upstream and within the
candidate binding site, while the reverse strand cuts only within the
candidate binding site and downstream. In this study, we consider a
200 bp margin. Assuming that L is the length of the motif, the ma-
trix DNase+,-,,- contains the numbers of forward strand DNase I cuts
(genomic positions 7': 1, ..., 200+L, relative to the position of
motif instance, starting 200 bp upstream of the motif, continuing
downstream), and the matrix DNase—L,- contains the numbers of re-
verse strand cuts (7' = 1, . . ., 200 + L, starting at the motif, continu-
ing downstream). We consider such matrices for all the chromatin
state data available to the model.

We also observed that all kinds of datasets based on short se-
quence reads, in particular all kinds of DNase-seq data, are prone to
artifactual spikes of reads (above 100 reads) mapped to a single lo-
cation and strand in the genome. These spikes may arise from the se-
quence fragments originating at repetitive regions with incomplete
representation in the reference genome. Hence, we applied clipping
to the number of reads mapped to a single location and strand,
choosing the threshold as the value of 99.9% quantile of all the
entries (for all i and j) of both matrices. The values above the thresh-
old were set to be equal to the threshold itself. We tried to use other
quantiles apart from the 99.9% quantile, namely 99% and 99.99%;
they all gave similar results (data not shown).

Let X,- = ((DNase+,-,,-)I-, (DNase—,,,-)I-,...) denote all the chro-
matin state data available to the model for a given motif instance 1'.
As stated in the previous subsection, we introduce latent variables Z,-
such that P(Z,- = 0|X,-) is the probability of motif instance 2' to be
unbound, P(Z,~ = 1 |X,-) is the probability of it being bound by
monomer, P(Z,~ = 2 |X,-) is the probability of it being bound in the
first cooperative binding mode, and so on. Our primary interest is

K+1
p,- = 2H2,- = k|X,—) = 1 — P(Z,— = 0|X,—),
k=1

i.e. the probability of the motif instance 2' to be bound in any binding
mode. It follows from the Bayes’ theorem (see Supplementary
Methods) that

p,- _ K+1 P(X,-|Z,- = k)P(Z,~ = k)
1 —p,' — k=1  =  = 0),

 

 

where P(Z,— = k) /P(Z,~ = 0) is the prior component of the model dis-
cussed in the previous subsection.

The remaining conditional probabilities P(X,-|Z,-= k) for k: 0,
. . ., K + 1 are modelled as follows. We assume that all the chromatin
state data included in the model are independent, given its binding
state Zi. Hence, the conditional probability is a product of the cor-
responding conditional probabilities for each type of chromatin state
data:

5 5

P(X,-|Z,- = k) = P((DNase+,-,)I.|Z,- = k) -P((DNase_,-,)I.|Z,- = k)
Each of the conditional probabilities on the right side is mod-
elled separately, using a factorized model. For brevity, we discuss

the parametrization only for P((DNase+,-,,-)I-|Z,-=k), i.e. forward
strand DNase I cuts; it is analogous for the other strand and for

112 [BJO'SIBIIJHO[p.IOJXO'SODBIIHOJIIIOIQ/ﬂ(11111 111011 pepeolumoq

other types of data. The first, negative binomial component cap-
tures the total number of reads mapped in the vicinity of the
motif instance 2' in binding mode k. The negative binomial distri-
bution is naturally parametrized by the success probability p+(k)
6 (0,1) and the real-valued number of failures r+(k) > 0. The se-
cond, multinomial component quantifies the probability of a par-
ticular spatial distribution of the given total number of DNase I
cuts, using the multinomial distribution (see Supplementary
Methods for details).

As opposed to CENTIPEDE (Pique-Regi et al., 2011), we do not
keep a separate free parameter for each position (respective to the
motif location) and strand, but apply a more ﬂexible approach. For
each binding mode k, we divide the positions 7' into one or more
bins. Let us denote by DNaseBin,-+U‘) the bin number for position i
in binding mode k. Note that binding modes may differ in the way
the positions are split into bins. In this study, we take 20 bp long
bins outside the motif site, and single-basepair bins within the motif
site. Moreover, for the unbound mode (k = 0) we put all the pos-
itions in a single bin.

For a given binding mode k, we associate a free parameter 2b+(k)
with each bin 19 = 1, . . ., BH“). However, for the multinomial distri-
bution we must provide a vector of probabilities covering every sin-
gle position in the vicinity of the motif instance. Hence, we calculate
the actual multinomial coefficients Zﬁa‘) by taking the values of 2;,
H“ for b =DNaseBin,-+(k) and normalizing them so that
Zi/iﬁUQ) = 1. By definition, the multinomial coefficients Zi+(0)for
the unbound state are equal, i.e. there is no positional preference for
DNase I cuts in the null model.

2.5 Expectation—Maximization approach

To estimate the model parameters (1) = (ml-(9)112, (p+(k))k, (p_(k))k,
(r+(k))k, (1’09) k, (2b+(k))b,k, (lib—(1‘)) we), we apply the Expectation—
Maximization approach using a complete likelihood function. We
found no closed-form solution for (ﬁi(k))i,k,(r+(k))k and (r_(k))k
that maximizes the likelihood function, hence we apply the
Broyden—Fletcher—Goldfarb—Shanno (BFGS) numerical optimiza-
tion procedure (see Supplementary Methods). To increase the ro-
bustness of the model, we employ a shrinkage estimator of the
parameters (21,4419) we and (lib—(k))b,k. For each 19 and k, we take
the regularized estimator 52b+(k) + (1 — 6)|]b|/Zb|]b|, where |];,|
is the size of the bin 19, and 5 is the mixing parameter, equal to 0.5
by default.

The Expectation—Maximization procedure was initialized by
assigning the prior probabilities as follows. In the monomer bind-
ing mode, we put P(Z,- = 1)/P(Z,- = 0) = 100 for the top 10% of
motif instances with highest total number of DNase-seq cuts. In a
dimer binding mode k, we put P(Z,-= k)/P(Z,- = 0) = 100 for the
motif instances satisfying both of the following criteria: being
within the top 10% of motif instances with highest total number of
DNase-seq cuts, and being within the top 10% of motif instances
with highest dimerization partner motif score. In the cases not
mentioned above for any bound mode k, we put
P(Z,~= k)/P(Z,~ = 0) = 0.01. This default initialization procedure
allows for robust convergence of the algorithm; other procedures
may perform similarly (Supplementary Fig. S9; see Supplementary
Methods).

We then estimate the values for (ﬁi(k))i,k, and for the first
Maximization step we take the prior probabilities as the posterior
ones. We iterate the Expectation—Maximization procedure, in each
iteration getting a revised vector of parameters, until the posterior

probabilities do not change by more than 0.001. In most of the cases
described here, the algorithm converged in fewer than 30 iterations.

3 Results

3.1 Romulus systematically outperforms existing
methods

We systematically benchmarked Romulus along with two above-
mentioned tools for TF binding site identification, CENTIPEDE
(Pique-Regi et al., 2011) and Wellington (Piper et al., 2013). As
described in the previous section, we applied all the methods in
an unsupervised manner to DNase-seq data from three ENCODE
sources: Duke DNase, University of Washington (UW) DNase
and UW Digital Genomic Footprinting (DGF). From each of the
DNase-seq data sources, sequence tag profiles were fetched for
three human cell types: A549 (lung adenocarcinoma epithelial
cell line), HepG2 (hepatocellular carcinoma cell line) and K562
(leukemia cell line). To validate the predictions, we used 39
ChIP-seq datasets from ENCODE to define genuine TF binding
sites (see Methods); note that no ChIP-seq data were used for
training.

Since both Romulus and CENTIPEDE learn a model for TF foot-
prints, we visualized these models by plotting their multinomial
components for representative cases (Fig. 1). Clearly, the DNase I
cut profiles fitted by CENTIPEDE capture much more noise than
their Romulus counterparts. Note that the curves for Romulus were
smoothed for the purpose of visualization by replacing the fixed-
value bins by a piecewise linear function. The multinomial models
for Romulus were based on a far smaller number of free parameters
than their CENTIPEDE counterparts (e.g. 48 versus 825 free param-
eters for 10 bp motif and 200 bp margin), hence they are less prone
to overfitting.

To systematically benchmark the three tools, we assessed their
predictive power for each combination of cell type and TF for
which we have reference ChIP-seq data (see Methods). The stand-
ard approach in assessing binary classifier performance is the
Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, showing the rela-
tionship between false positive rate (i.e. 1 — specificity, x axis) and
true positive rate (i.e. sensitivity, y axis). However, albeit routinely
performed, application of ROC curves to assess the performance
of TF binding site prediction is not adequate. These classification
tasks are characterized by highly skewed datasets containing rela-
tively small number of true positives (motif instances actually
bound by the TF) and large number of true negatives (motif in-
stances that remain unbound). Hence, the shape of ROC curves
and area under them is mostly affected by the ability of a particu-
lar tool to correctly predict unbound motif instances (Piper et al.,
2013).

To address the above-mentioned problem, we plotted Precision-
Recall curves, showing the relationship between recall (i.e. sensitiv-
ity, x axis) and precision (y axis). These curves were found to give a
more informative picture of an algorithm’s performance when clas-
sifying highly skewed datasets (Davis and Goadrich, 2006).
Example Precision-Recall curves for several TFs in K5 62 cells (Fig.
2A) suggest that Romulus outperforms the existing methods in most
of the cases. This observation is also supported by the corresponding
ROC curves (Supplementary Fig. 1A).

Common single-dimensional measures in assessing classifier
performance are the area under ROC curve (AUC-ROC) and the
area under Precision-Recall curve (AUC-PR). We calculated these
statistics for all the combinations of cell types and TFs considered,

for each of the three DNase-seq data sources (Supplementary Figs
52 and S3), and found that indeed Romulus outperformed the
other tools in most of the cases. A similar trend was observed for
Spearman correlation of binding predictions with ChIP-seq peak
height (Supplementary Fig. S4).

To obtain a summary view of the performance of each of the
three tools considered (CENTIPEDE, Wellington and Romulus) we
aggregated the AUC-PR statistics as violin plots, combining them
across different cell types and TFs (Fig. 2B). We used two-sided
Wilcoxon signed-rank test to compare the statistics between three
tools for each DNase-seq data source, and found that Romulus sys-
tematically and significantly outperformed the other tools. The same
trend was observed using AUC-ROC statistics (Supplementary Fig.
S1B). These aggregations also suggests that the performance of
CENTIPEDE is most affected by the choice of DNase-seq data
source, while the performance of Romulus and Wellington remain
stable. Intriguingly, CENTIPEDE performed poorly for the datasets

from UW DGF, despite the fact that UW DGF datasets had at least
2.25 times more reads than the corresponding Duke and UW DNase
datasets (Supplementary Table S1).

3.2 Romulus improves TF binding site prediction for
Iow—information-content motifs

We also studied the difference between AUC-PR performance of
Romulus and the second best performer, Wellington, and found that
for some specific TFs the difference is noticeably higher. We
hypothesized that this may be related to the motif information con-
tent of these TFs. To test this hypothesis, we calculated the Pearson
correlation coefficient r of the difference between AUC-PR perform-
ance, as described above, and the motif information content (Fig. 3).
A similar calculation was performed for AUC-ROC (Supplementary
Fig. 55).

We also performed a 1000-fold permutation test to calculate the
empirical P-value for the Pearson correlation coefficient, randomly
pairing the AUC-PR performance and the motif information con-
tent. For all the three DNase-seq data sources, we observed a statis-
tically significant negative correlation: P = 0.005 for Duke,
P = 0.024 for UW DNase-seq data and P < 0.001 for UW DGF (Fig.
3). Thus, the gain of predictive power of Romulus over Wellington
is significantly higher for TFs with low-information-content motifs,
perhaps because of the Romulus’ ability to capture the shape of the
DNase I cut profile.

3.3 Knowledge of TF dimerization modes does not
improve the prediction of individual TF binding sites
Next, we tested the hypothesis that accounting for dimer binding
modes could significantly improve TF-DNA binding predictions.
The TFs AR, FOXA1, SOX2 and OCT4 are known to form strongly
cooperative dimeric binding complexes (Jankowski et al., 2013). We
therefore used matching ChIP-seq datasets (Supplementary Table
S4) to benchmark the binding predictions made by Romulus for
these TFs when information on their dimer binding modes was sup-
plied. We considered putative partner binding sites positioned at a
specific offset and orientation with respect to the primary motif, and
included the motif scores at these positions as prior characteristics in
the prior component of the model (see Methods).

Apart from the known AR—AR homodimer (Nelson et al., 1999)
and AR—FOXA1 heterodimer (Wang et al., 2011), we included two
predicted FOXA1—FOXA1 homodimers: one with convergent, and
one with divergent motifs (Jankowski et al., 2013; Starick et al.,
2015). Hence, the Romulus model had four states for AR (i.e. AR
monomer, AR—AR, AR—FOXA1 and unbound), and five states for
FOXA1 (FOXA1 monomer, FOXA1—AR, FOXA1—FOXA1 diver-
gent, FOXA1—FOXA1 convergent, unbound). The performance of
TF binding site prediction was assessed in unstimulated, as well as
androgen-stimulated, LNCaP cells.

For SOX2 and OCT4, we included the canonical SOX2—OCT4
heterodimer (Ng et al., 2012). The Romulus model had three states
for SOX2 (i.e. unbound, SOX2 monomer and SOX2—OCT4 hetero-
dimer), and three states for OCT4 (i.e. unbound, OCT4 monomer
and OCT4—SOX2). The performance of TF binding site prediction
was assessed in H1-hESC embryonic stem cells.

We expected that the additional binding modes would improve
overall predictive power, given that prior information on partner
motif scores could facilitate separation of distinct dimer footprints.
However, in terms of Precision-Recall curves (Fig. 4) and ROC
curves (Supplementary Fig. S6) we found no observable improve-
ment. We also confirmed that predicted dimer binding amounted for

32—71% of total predicted binding for a given TF, DNase-seq data
source and condition. To verify whether the dimer binding modes in-
deed have distinguishable profiles, we plotted the components of the
Romulus model: the negative binomial component (Supplementary
Fig. S7) and the multinomial component (Supplementary Fig. SS).
We found that the models learned by Romulus clearly differ between
the binding modes, yet their inclusion does not improve the predic-
tion of individual TF binding sites.

3.4 Binding in Closed Chromatin as a quantitative
predictor of pioneer factor activity

We noted that in the case of several TFs it was particularly challeng-
ing to predict their binding, and we hypothesized that it might be be-
cause these TFs are able to bind closed chromatin in violation of the
assumptions of Romulus and other algorithms. In such a situation of
binding to nucleosomal DNA, the way Romulus model accounts for
the local chromatin openness profile is not necessarily appropriate.
We found it promising to quantify this discrepancy. To this end, we
limited the scope to the bound motif instances according to the
ChIP-seq data, and considered the probabilities of the chromatin
state component in the Romulus model. We then plotted the cumu-
lative distribution functions of these probabilities (Fig. 5). These
functions should be perceived having two model cases in mind. If a
particular TF can only bind open chromatin, its binding sites will all
have high chromatin state component probabilities. The cumulative

Fig. 5. Cumulative distribution functions of the chromatin state component.
For each combination of TF and cell type, the cumulative distribution func-
tions of the chromatin state component calculated by Romulus using three
sources of DNase-seq data are shown. Cumulative distributions correspond-
ing to BCC values above the threshold from Figure 6 (for each cell type, one
MAD above the median) are highlighted (Color version of this figure is avail-

distribution function will therefore remain ﬂat early on and then
show a spike towards the right end of the x-axis.

In contrast, a TF that can also bind closed chromatin will toler-
ate lower chromatin component scores. Its cumulative distribution
function will show some elevation at low-to-moderate scores, i.e. in
the middle of the x-axis range. Such an ability to bind closed chro-
matin without the aid of other TFs is a defining feature of pioneer
factors. Several pioneer factors have been identified so far, including
the forkhead box A (FOXA) factors, GATA-binding (GATA) fac-
tors, PU.1 and FOXD3 (Zaret and Carroll, 2011).

To quantify the amount of TF binding that takes place in loci
without a pronounced local chromatin openness signal, we introduce
Binding in Closed Chromatin (BCC). The value of BCC is calculated
as the Area-Under-Curve of a cumulative distribution function
described above (Fig. 5 ). Note that we take only the chromatin state
component, and exclude the prior (genomic sequence) component.
Incorporation of the primary motif score would be unreliable here,
since for some TFs their binding to closed chromatin may be
achieved only by their half-site, as is the case for Pax7 (Budry et al.,
2012). We observed that the chromatin state component probabil-
ities showed no correlation with ChIP-seq peak height or rank (data
not shown). We also compared the BCC values with Spearman

correlation coefficient between DNase I accessibility and motif score
(Blatti et al., 2015), and found no evident relationship between them
(Supplementary Fig. S10, see Supplementary Methods).

We found that the median value of BCC, for all TF binding site
predictions in all cell types, was 0.11 1 in Duke DNase, 0.099 in UW
DNase and 0.051 in UW DGF (Fig. 6). We focused on the TFs that
had a BCC value, in at least one case, more than one MAD (median
absolute deviation) above the median (Fig. 5, highlighted cumulative
distribution functions). Eight out of 26 TFs had BCC values above
the threshold in at least three cases; these candidate pioneer factors
are: CEBP, CTCF, FOXA1, JunD, Max, NRSF, PU.1 and USF1.

Notably, FOXA1 is a canonical example of a pioneer factor
(Lupien et al., 2008). We also noted that CTCF and NRSF both
have have long, information-rich motifs, which may allow them to
bind with high specificity regardless of local chromatin openness. It
has been also suggested (Garber et al., 2012) that at an early stage in
lineage commitment of dendritic cells, PU.1 and CEBP act as master
pioneer factors, while binding of second-tier factors JunB, IRF4 and
ATF3 primes the response and sets the basal expression levels of
other genes. Our results also suggest a previously unreported pioneer
factor activity of upstream stimulatory factor 1 (USF1) in HepG2
and K5 62 cell lines.

4 Discussion

In this study, we comprehensively compared the predictive perform-
ance of three tools aimed at predicting TF binding sites from
DNase-seq data. Two of them, CENTIPEDE and Wellington, used
completely different approaches to address this problem. In our
method proposed here, Romulus, we combined the benefits of both
of the two other tools, and showed that Romulus significantly
outperformed CENTIPEDE and Wellington, regardless of the
DNase-seq protocol used (‘single hit’ or ‘double hit’). The advantage
of Romulus was observed especially when applied to binding site pre-
diction for low-information-content motifs. It is likely that Romulus
gained in robustness and predictive power by limiting the number of
free parameters in the multinomial component to 2 - (motif
width + 9). In contrast, CENTIPEDE used 2 - (motif width + 400) — 1
free parameters in the multinomial component, and Wellington does
not estimate any model parameters from the data.

When allowing for more than one bound state in Romulus, we
found that the additional DNase I cut profiles can differ greatly.
However, the inclusion of these additional states for the known TF
dimers did not yield an increase in predictive power. We hypothesize
that three factors potentially contributed to this effect. Firstly, dimer
binding sites constitute only a small fraction of all binding sites, and
thus the overall improvement from considering dimer binding modes
is necessarily limited. Secondly, dimer binding may not induce
strong changes in the DNase I cut profile, relative to monomer bind-
ing. Rather, the profile shape could be influenced to a greater degree
by other parameters, such as the width of the hypersensitive region,
the location of the binding site in question with respect to the centre
of the region, and the spatial distribution of neighbouring binding
sites. If so, the shape of the DNase I cut profile would be only
weakly indicative of the binding mode. Finally, inclusion of add-
itional binding modes substantially increases the number of free par-
ameters in the model, which increases the likelihood of overfitting.

A recent computational method, protein interaction quantitation
(PIQ), used the correlation between TF binding and chromatin
openness to identify TFs that function as pioneer factors (Sherwood
et al., 2014). We have shown the value of a different approach that
prioritizes binding sites in closed chromatin. We propose that this
Binding in Closed Chromatin (BCC) score is a quantitative correlate
of pioneer factor activity. In other words, BCC values constitute a
measure of a TF’s ability to bind nucleosome-occluded DNA.
Indeed, multiple known pioneer factors were detected as having
high BCC scores. Notably, while PIQ requires data from two differ-
ent experimental conditions (before and after differentiation, for ex-
ample) to identify pioneer factors, the calculation of BCC requires
data from one condition only. Note that the BCC scores of some
TFs varied significantly across cell types. While some of this vari-
ability could be attributable to biological factors such as variation in
TE expression, technical factors may also play a role. For example,
closed-chromatin binding sites, which tend to be weaker, would be
detected in smaller numbers in the noisier ChIP-seq datasets.

Intriguingly, CTCF and NRSF (REST) were predicted both by
BCC and PIQ as pioneer factors, despite the use of divergent strategies
by the two algorithms. A unique feature shared by these two TFs is
that they have long, information-rich PWMs (both 20 bp; 32.7 and
34.9 bits of information, respectively) and bind DNA strongly using
multiple zinc-finger domains. They could therefore potentially bind
DNA ‘alone,’ without requiring co-binding by neighbouring factors
over 5 0—100 bp. In such a scenario, CTCF and NRSF could tightly
bind a 20-bp stretch of DNA closely ﬂanked by nucleosomes, leaving
little room for DNA cleavage by DNase I. This would explain the
high BCC scores of these two TFs. On the other hand, given their
high DNA affinity, they would also be likely to bind motif instances
in promoter or enhancer regions characterized by highly open
chromatin. Thus, they would be predicted as pioneer TFs by both
methods, but for different reasons. Pioneer TFs with fewer DNA-
binding domains could adopt yet another configuration: they have
been shown to bind DNA that is wrapped around a histone octamer
(Iwafuchi-Doi and Zaret, 2014), Given the diversity of such possibil-
ities, we anticipate that TF-DNA binding predictions will eventu-
ally need to account for multiple binding ‘strategies,’ each defined by
the precise nature of the interplay between the TF and nucleosomes.

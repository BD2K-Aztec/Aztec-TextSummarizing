Abstract

Motivation: Proteomic mass spectrometry analysis is becoming routine in clinical diagnostics, for
example to monitor cancer biomarkers using blood samples. However, differential proteomics and
identification of peaks relevant for class separation remains challenging.

Results: Here, we introduce a simple yet effective approach for identifying differentially expressed
proteins using binary discriminant analysis. This approach works by data-adaptive thresholding of
protein expression values and subsequent ranking of the dichotomized features using a relative en-
tropy measure. Our framework may be viewed as a generalization of the ’peak probability contrast’
approach of Tibshirani et al. (2004) and can be applied both in the two-group and the multi-group
setting. Our approach is computationally inexpensive and shows in the analysis of a large-scale
drug discovery test dataset equivalent prediction accuracy as a random forest. Furthermore, we
were able to identify in the analysis of mass spectrometry data from a pancreas cancer study biolo-
gical relevant and statistically predictive marker peaks unrecognized in the original study.
Availability and implementation: The methodology for binary discriminant analysis is implemented
in the R package binda, which is freely available under the GNU General Public License (version 3 or

1 Introduction

 

Mass spectrometry, a high-throughput technology commonly used
in proteomics, enables the measurement of the abundance of pro-
teins, metabolites, peptides and amino acids in biological samples.
The study of changes in protein expression across subgroups of sam-
ples and through time provides valuable insights into cellular mech-
anisms and offers a means to identify relevant biomarkers, e.g. to
distinguish among tissue types, or for predicting health status. In
practice, however, there still remain many analytic and computa-
tional challenges to be addressed, especially in clinical diagnostics
(Leichtle et al., 2013).

A recent overview of statistical issues in the analysis of prote-
omics mass spectrometry data is Morris (2012) who discusses a
wide range of methods ranging from data preprocessing, i.e. re-
moval of systematic bias, peak identification, peak alignment and
quantification and calibration of relative peak intensities, to meth-
ods for high-level statistical analysis, such as peak ranking and clas-
sification. Of particular importance is the problem of differential
protein expression and the identification of peaks informative for
group separation and class prediction.

A special characteristic of mass spectrometry data is their dual-
valued nature, i.e. they contain both continuous as well as discrete

information. Specifically, a protein may be differentially expressed if
its intensity of expression varies among groups and is relatively up- or
down-regulated, or if a corresponding peak is either absent or present
in a specific group. Consequently, mass spectrometry intensity matri-
ces typically contain very large amounts of missing values, which ren-
ders application of standard statistical methodology from other omics
platforms, such as regularized t-scores, difficult and potentially sub-
optimal. Accordingly, this has initiated the development of new statis-
tical methodology (Tibshirani et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2012).

Two main strategies to address this issue in the high-level ana-
lysis of mass spectrometry data have emerged:

1. All data are treated as continuous, with missing intensity values
set to zero or imputed. Subsequently, standard omics methods
are employed, such as t-scores for feature selection (e.g. Datta
and DePadilla, 2006).

2. The absence—presence data are used for data analysis in conjunc-
tion with the intensity values. Tibshirani et al. (2004) propose
peak probability contrasts (PPCs), the absolute difference in fre-
quency of occurrence of a peak, for ranking and feature selec-
tion, and also use PPC to improve absence—presence data by
dichotomization of intensity values. Wang et al. (2012) propose
a test based on the PPC statistic and propose to apply joint false
discovery rate control of the union of intensity-based and PPC-
based rankings.

Here, we follow the second route and propose a novel coherent model
for differential protein expression and prediction based on binary dis-
criminant analysis (BinDA). Our approach may be viewed as a gener-
alization of Tibshirani et al. (2004) and comprises the following:

° The binary absence—presence data are explicitly modeled by a
multivariate Bernoulli (MVB) distribution.

° Multi-group binary discriminant analysis (BinDA) is employed
for feature ranking, variable selection and prediction.

° For ranking of peaks the natural relative entropy variable im-
portance measure coherent with BinDA is used, rather than PPC.

° Likewise, for dichotomization of the intensity data matrix contain-
ing missing values we employ the same entropy-based criterion.

As a result, we obtain simple principled framework for analyzing
dual-valued mass spectrometry data without the need for imputation,
with a natural measure for variable ranking and for differential protein
expression, and with coherent prediction rules. In contrast to many
other methods this approach also allows multiple groups as response
variable, and thus extends beyond simple pairwise comparisons.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Next, we de-
scribe in detail the statistical methodology underlying BinDA. Then,
for validation we investigate the performance of the proposed ap-
proach in comparison with a random forest on a large-scale chemo-
metric dataset. Subsequently, we present a detailed case study
analyzing mass spectrometry data from a pancreas cancer study. For
reproducibility, we provide the R package binda implementing our
approach and R scripts for all analyzes described. Finally, we discuss
applicability of the BinDA approach to other molecular data as well
as further extensions.

2 Methods

2.1 Setup and notation
Our analysis starts after the raw mass spectrometry data have been
adequately preprocessed, i.e. transformed, smoothed, background-

removed, calibrated, aligned and peak-extracted (e.g. Morris, 2012;
Gibb and Strimmer, 2012).

We denote the resulting peak intensities by z,-,- 2 0, with spectrum
index i E {1, . . . ,n} and peak indexj E {1, . . . ,d}. The data matrix z),-
typically contains missing values as not all of the registered d peaks will
be present in all of the n spectra. In a classification setting each spectrum
2' also carries a class label y,- E {1, . . . ,K} that assigns it to one of K dif-
ferent groups, for instance health status, tissue type or treatment out-
come. The label is known for training data and unknown for test data.
The sample size in group with label y is 11,, with n 2 25:1
From the continuous data zij we obtain binary peak intensities

11),.

x,,- by thresholding at peak-specific levels w = (w1,...,wd).
Specifically, we set xi]: 1 if the peak is present in sample 2' and
zii 2 L0,. Conversely, if the peak is absent or zii < w,- then x,,- = 0. The
methodology we present here uses the binary matrix x,,- for predic-
tion and variable ranking, rather than the original data zij, and it
also estimates the thresholds w.

2.2 Modeling binary data

Stochastic models for multivariate binary data are well established
(e.g. Cox, 1972; Dai et al., 2013). A univariate binary random vari-
able X N Be(,u) with two states x = 0 and x = 1 is completely
described by a Bernoulli distribution Be(,u) with expectation
E(X) = u and variance Var(X) = u(1 — y).

In the multivariate case this generalizes to X 2 (X1, . . . ,Xd) ~
Bed(u,C) where d denotes the dimension of the MVB distribution,
u = (M1,...,ud) is the vector of expectations E(X) = u, and C con-
tains the 2d — d — 1 interaction parameters. As in the univariate case
the variances Var(X,-) = ,ul-(1 — ,ui) are fully determined by the means.

In many cases it is useful to ignore the dependencies among the
individual variables X,- in order to reduce the number of parameters
in the model. Despite, or perhaps because, of its simplicity the inde-
pendence ‘naive Bayes’ assumption can be very effective, especially
for prediction in high dimensions and small sample size, see Hand
and Yu (2001) and Park (2009). For MVB with independent pre-
dictor variables the joint probability mass function is given by

d _. - ,2
pr(x)=H {1 u; 1fo 0,

with diagonal covariance matrix Var(X) = diag{,ul-(1 — up}.

2.3 Discriminant analysis with binary predictors
For prediction of the class associated with an unlabeled spectrum we
need to construct a prediction rule. Here, we employ a Bayesian pre-
diction rule similar as in diagonal discriminant analysis (DDA) that
is routinely and successfully used, e.g. in transcriptomics (Tibshirani
et al., 2003).

We first define group-specific models for each group with
label y,

Pr(xly) = H (1)

d {1—pyi ifxi=0,
i=1

,uyl- ifxl- = 1.

For each group y we also specify a prior probability Pr(Y = y) 2 TC),
with 25:1 R), = 1. By yo,- 2 25:1 nyuyl- we denote the pooled mean
for each variable i, i.e. the mean we would assign if there was only a
single category.

The posterior probability of each group is then given by Bayes’
theorem Pr(y|x) = Pr(x|y)7ty/Pr(x) which after taking the logarithm
yields the discriminant function

dy(x) = log Pr(y|x) = log 71), + log Pr(x|y) + C. (2)

As the purpose of dy (x) is only to compare among different groups
we can drop all terms that do not depend on 3), such as Pr(x), repre-
sented above by the constant C. Prediction of a label for test data x
is carried out by choosing the group y that maximizes the discrimin-
ant function,

51 = arg max dy (x)
y

This MVB independence prediction rule has shown to be highly
effective (e.g. Park, 2009), even if there is correlation among
predictors.

Typically, the parameters of discriminant function are unknown
themselves and have to be learned themselves from training data, i.e.
from spectra with known group labels. The training is done by esti-
mating the means u,,,- and the group probabilities TC), in Equations (1)
and (2). We suggest a ﬂexible estimation strategy by employing
maximum-likelihood estimation for large sample size, and otherwise
using regularized estimation. For instance, to estimate the group
probabilities we use observed frequencies fry 2 ny/n if n is large,
and for small 11 the Stein-type shrinkage estimator of proportions
described in Hausser and Strimmer (2009).

2.4 Variable ranking and selection

Closely tied in with prediction is the question which variables are
most important for successful assignment of a class label, and con-
versely, which variables are irrelevant. Especially in large-dimen-
sional problems it is very important to remove the null features as
the build-up of random noise from these variables can substantially
degrade the overall prediction accuracy (cf. Ahdesmaki and
Strimmer, 2010).

For ranking features in discriminant analysis with binary vari-
ables there have been many, in part contradictory, propositions. For
the case of K = 2 groups the following criteria, among others, have
been used:

° The X2 statistic of independence between response and predictors
(An et al., 2013),

° PPCs |uy1 — uy2| (Tibshirani et al., 2004),

0 Quinlan’s information gain measure (Bender et al., 2004), and

° ratio of between-group and within-group covariance (Wilbur et
al., 2002).

See Tan et al. (2004) for many other proposals for measuring as-
sociations between categorical outcomes and binary variables. Only
some of the criteria above can also be applied to the multiple group
case (K > 2).

We use a principled approach to variable ranking relying on pre-
dictive information, see Gelman et al. (2014) for an overview.
Conceptually, we use the expected log-predictive density as measure
of model fit, and compare the fully specified joint model containing
all predictors and the response with a ‘no-effects’ model where the re-
sponse is independent of the predictors. The difference of expected
log-likelihood between full and ‘no-effects’ model is given by the rela-
tive entropy or Kullback—Leibler divergence D = KL(Ffu11| an0_eff).
The relative contributions of each individual predictor to D then pro-
vides a measure of variable importance. This procedure applied to lin-
ear regression with independent predictors results in squared marginal
correlations, and applied to DDA it yields squared t—scores, both of
which are optimal measures for variable ranking in their respective
settings (Zuber and Strimmer, 201 1).

For independent binary predictors the joint full model is

d (1 — “JV-ﬁt), ifxl- = 0,
Pr(xay)full : H {

[=1 ,uyI-ny if x,- = 1

whereas the no-effects model is

d (1 — MOI-)ny ifxl- = 0,
Pr(xa no—eff : H {

i=1 MOI-TC), 1fx,- = 1.

This results in

where 01-2 = MOI-(1 — ,uoj) is the variance of Be(u0/-). For the special
case of K = 2 groups S,- simplifies to

SW) 2 m  2_
2 07

By construction, the score S,- is a measure of variable importance of
feature 7' where S,- is a weighted sum of the squared z—scores that
compare each group mean with the overall pooled mean. This is pre-
cisely analogous to the pooled-mean formulation of discriminant
analysis described in Ahdesmaki and Strimmer (2010). If the vari-
ances 01-2 are similar across features, then Si(K=2) is apart from a scale
factor the squared PPC.

As above for learning the discriminant function, we use for estima-
tion of the entropic ranking scores S,- either maximum-likelihood or
shrinkage estimates of proportions, depending on sample size.

that are properly scaled to allow to contrast the individual contribu-
tions of each class relative to each other, similar as in the methods
described in Ahdesmaki and Strimmer (2010) and Tibshirani et al.
(2003). The estimated ranking score may also be expressed in terms
of a weighted sum of the t-scores via

K
S,- = 20 — antic/(21¢).
y=1
After ranking variables according to the estimated scores Si,
with highest scores indicating the most relevant predictors, we use
cross-validation to evaluate prediction accuracy for different num-
bers of included predictors to determine a suitable cutoff.

2.5 Dichotomization

With the above setup for BinDA it is straightforward to per-
form dichotomization. Specifically, we choose thresholds
w = (w1, . . . ,wd) to discretize the continuous data z,,- to maximize
the entropy score D (Equation 3). As in our model assume the pre-
dictors are assumed to be independent we can optimize each thresh-
old wl- independently by maximizing the individual Si. Note that the
same entropy measure is used both for determining the thresholds
and for ranking the predictors, thus ranking and discretization is
done in an integrative fashion.

3 Results

3.1 Implementation and reproducible research

We have implemented our approach for multi-class discriminant
analysis using binary predictors including functions for variable
ranking and dichotomization in the R package binda that is freely
available under the GNU General Public License (version 3 or
later) from URL http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bindal.
For reproducibility of the analyzes presented in this paper we pro-
vide corresponding R scripts at http://strimmerlab.org/software/
binda/.

3.2 Validation of binda

BinDA has been studied extensively and is well established in the lit-
erature (e.g. Cox, 1972). More recently, it was demonstrated that
BinDA with naive Bayes assumption can yield high rates of predict-
ive accuracy even if the underlying assumption of independence of
predictors is not met (Wilbur et al., 2002; Bender et al., 2004; Park,
2009; An et al., 2013).

For validation of our implementation of BinDA in the R package
binda we analyzed a large-scale chemometric test dataset.
Specifically, we investigated the ‘Dorothea’ drug discovery dataset
from the NIPS 2003 feature selection challenge (Guyon et al., 2005).
The dataset contains d = 100 000 binary features describing the 3-D
properties of chemical compounds that either bind (response
label+1) or not (label— 1) to thrombin, an enzyme involved in
blood clotting.

We used the ‘Dorothea’ training data with 11min 2 800 samples
and corresponding class labels to learn a classifier with
binda. Subsequently, we applied the resulting classification rule to
the validation dataset with nval = 350 samples and predicted the
sample labels of the validation data. As for the validation data the
true labels are known we were then able to compute the actual pre-
diction accuracy, i.e. the proportion of correctly identified labels.

Due to its algorithmic simplicity training the classifier and
ranking variables with binda was computationally inexpensive.
Applying class-balanced 5-fold cross-validation with 20 repeti-
tions using the R package crossval on the training data alone we
determined that the response can be predicted well with only
very few top ranking predictors included in the classification
rule. For instance, a binda classifier with three predictors yielded
prediction accuracy on the validation set of 0.9371 and of
0.9429 if 10 predictors were used. The predictive accuracy with-
out any variable selection including all 100000 predictors was
0.9057.

For comparison we also trained a random forest (Breiman,
2001), a tree-based machine learning approach that emerged as
one of the overall best performing methods for classification in a
recent systematic study (Fernandez-Delgado et al., 2014). Due to
the high-dimensionality the running time for learning the random
forest from the training data was two magnitudes slower than
binda, taking 652 seconds on our workstation in comparison to 5
seconds for binda. The random forest yielded an accuracy of 0.94
for prediction of the labels of the independent validation dataset.
This analysis confirms that BinDA, though very simple, is able, at
least for this data, to perform prediction as accurately as random
forest. Correspondingly, if variables in the random forest were
ranked according to the Gini variable importance measure the top-
ranking features were mostly identical to those ranked best by
BinDA, which indicates that BinDA is indeed able to select the
most relevant variables.

3.3 Analysis of pancreas cancer proteomics data

3.3.1 Pancreas cancer study

For illustration of our proposed approach to classification and peak
ranking in mass spectrometry data we also reanalyzed experimental
proteomics data from a pancreas cancer study conducted in Leipzig
and Heidelberg (Fiedler et al., 2009). For the training dataset of this
study 40 patients with diagnosed pancreas cancer as well as 40
healthy controls were recruited. Each participant of the study
donated serum samples which provided the basis for MALDI/TOF
measurements. For each sample four technical replicates were

obtained. Due to the presence of strong batch effects in our analysis
below we restrict ourselves to patients and controls from
Heidelberg, leading to a raw dataset containing 160 spectra for 40
probands,

The aim of the study was to determine biomarkers to discrimin-
ate patients with pancreas cancer from healthy persons. Fiedler et al.
(2009) found marker peaks at m/z 3884 (double charged) and 7767
(single charged) and correspondingly supposed platelet factor 4
(PF4) as potential marker, arguing that PF4 is down-regulated in
blood serum of patients with pancreatic cancer.

3.3.2 Preprocessing and dichotomization

(A) double- and (B) single-charged peaks

MALDIquant (Gibb and Strimmer, 2012). Specifically, the raw
data were variance-stabilized, smoothed, baseline-corrected, TIC-
standardized and aligned. Technical replicates were then averaged,
peaks were identified and corresponding intensities extracted from
each averaged spectrum. Precise details on the preprocessing can be
found in the R script. As a result a protein expression matrix of size 40
patients times 166 peaks was obtained. In total 26% of intensities in
the matrix were missing, corresponding to about 44 missing peaks per
spectrum.

Subsequently, we performed dichotomization of the intensity
matrix using the relative entropy criterion of Equation (3). To illus-
trate the improvement of the resulting binary data matrix over the
original absence—presence matrix we conducted hierarchical cluster-
ing on the samples. As can be seen in Figure 1 the clustering based
on the optimized binary matrix almost perfectly separates pancreas
cancer samples from healthy samples, indicating that there is a
strong signal in the data.

3.3.3 Peak ranking and differential expression thresholds

In order to identify features responsible for the separation of cancer
versus healthy samples in Figure 1B we applied peak ranking for bin-
ary data according to BinDA. The resulting ranking of the 30 best
discriminating peaks is shown in Figure 2. As a consequence of the
discrete data, the first three top-ranking peaks with m/z values
4495, 8868 and 8989) achieved the same maximum score, followed
by the next three peaks 1855, 4468 and 8937, that also achieved an
identical score.

We note that none of these peaks was identified in the original
study. The two PF4 peaks with m/z 3884 and 7768 (the slight differ-
ence is due to the MALDIquant alignment procedure) rank on places
148—151 and 157—163, respectively.

Using cross-validation, we estimated prediction errors for group
separation from the binary data matrix. As for the ‘Dorothea’ data-
set we employed class-balanced 5-fold cross-validation with 20
repetitions. Interestingly, using only five predictors was sufficient
to achieve an accuracy of 0.96, sensitivity of 0.96, specificity of
0.97, positive predictive value of 0.97 and negative predictive
value of 0.95. This indicates that the observed clear separation be-
tween cancer and control samples in Figure 1B is attributable to
only very few features of the data.

Visual inspection of the group of top-ranking differentially ex-
pressed peaks revealed a further pattern (Fig. 3). First, five of the
peaks are all part of the same peak group. Second, the peak group
appears both in a single charged (m/z 8868, 8937, 8989) version as
well as in a mirrored double charge version (m/z 4468 and 4495).
This affirms that there must an underlying biological marker driving
the observed changes between cancer and control samples.

To study this further, we inspected the intensities for the peaks
belonging to the differentially expressed peak group. Figure 4 shows
the overall density, as well as the sub-density for the cancer samples,
along with the dichotomization threshold estimated by binda. For
all five peaks the expression respectively the underlying protein
abundance is up-regulated in the cancer samples compared with the
controls. In addition, the estimated thresholds provide an effective
means to separate the two groups.

3.3.4 Biological relevance

Finally, we also tried to identify the biological molecules behind the
differentially expressed peak group shown in Figure 3. Specifically,
we used the TagIdent tool (Gasteiger et al., 2005) with settings Mw
8936.97, Mw range 0.05% and organism homo sapiens to query the
UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database (The UniProt Consortium, 2015).
This indicated a potential link of the central peak m/z 8937 to
PDPFL_HUMAN, the pancreatic progenitor cell differentiation and
proliferation factor-like protein, as well as to a fragment of
C3adesArg, an acylation stimulating protein. The increased abun-
dance of PDPFL_HUMAN in pancreas cancer tissue appears highly
plausible, and the increased concentration of C3adesArg in serum of
cancer patients has also been reported previously (e.g. Opstal-van
Winden et al., 2011).

Another biologically relevant result of our analysis based on
BinDA is that the originally proposed PF4 marker is not differen-
tially expressed and hence cannot be used to distinguish between
cancer and healthy samples.

4 Discussion

We have presented a simple yet effective approach to differential ex-
pression and classification for mass spectrometry data using BinDA.
Our approach may be viewed as generalization of Tibshirani et al.
(2004) and can be applied also for multi-group discriminant ana-
lysis. A particular feature is the use of the same relative entropy cri-
terion for peak ranking and selection and for dichotomization of the
continuous protein intensity data. In addition, we obtain decision
thresholds from the protein intensities that are biologically and diag-
nostically easy to interpret.

In illustrative analysis of high-dimensional drug discovery data
we showed that our approach implemented in the R package binda
is computationally effective and yet competitive with a random for-
est. Furthermore, in reanalysis of proteomics data from a pancreas
cancer study we found statistically predictive marker peaks to tumor
cell growth unrecognized in the original analysis. This confirms the
importance of reproducible research in proteomics, where it is

unfortunately still not common to provide analysis scripts and soft-
ware openly.

In addition to mass spectrometry analysis, there are many bio-
informatics applications in which binary data are collected, and
hence, in which the present methodology and software will potentially
be useful. Examples include meta-genomics, where the absence and
presence of proteins and genes is compared with a pan-genome
(Medini et al., 2008), community analysis by DNA fingerprinting
(Wilbur et al., 2002), and chemometrics (Bender et al., 2004).

Exploring additional applications may also lead to further meth-
odological extensions of the procedures currently implemented in
binda, such as modeling overdispersion, e.g. by employing the Beta-
Bernoulli rather than Bernoulli distribution, and to take account of
interactions among predictors, e.g. by modeling pair-wise correlation.

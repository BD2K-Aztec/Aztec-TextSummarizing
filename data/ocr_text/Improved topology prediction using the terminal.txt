Abstract

Motivation: The translocon recognizes sufficiently hydrophobic regions of a protein and inserts
them into the membrane. Computational methods try to determine what hydrophobic regions are
recognized by the translocon. Although these predictions are quite accurate, many methods still
fail to distinguish marginally hydrophobic transmembrane (TM) helices and equally hydrophobic
regions in soluble protein domains. In vivo, this problem is most likely avoided by targeting of the
TM-proteins, so that non-TM proteins never see the translocon. Proteins are targeted to the translo-
con by an N-terminal signal peptide. The targeting is also aided by the fact that the N-terminal helix
is more hydrophobic than other TM-helices. In addition, we also recently found that the C-terminal
helix is more hydrophobic than central helices. This information has not been used in earlier top-
ology predictors.

Results: Here, we use the fact that the N- and C-terminal helices are more hydrophobic to develop
a new version of the first-principle-based topology predictor, SCAMPI. The new predictor has two
main advantages; first, it can be used to efficiently separate membrane and non-membrane pro-
teins directly without the use of an extra prefilter, and second it shows improved performance for
predicting the topology of membrane proteins that contain large non-membrane domains.

1 Introduction

The biogenesis of most oc-helical transmembrane (TM) proteins follows
a path where the synthesis is halted after a signal peptide is recognized
by a signal recognition particle (Rapoport et al., 2004). After the recog-
nition, the ribosome is transported to the ER—, organelle- or plasma-
membrane, where translation starts again with the emerging peptide
chain threaded through the translocon channel, additional TM helices
being recognized and, in some cases, the signal peptide is cleaved off.
Although it is clear that, for some proteins, additional rearrangements
occur (Kauko et al., 2010), most membrane proteins appear to follow
a folding procedure where the recognized TM helices come together to

pack optimally (Rapoport et al., 2004). This means that the location
of membrane helices is primarily determined by the recognition of
hydrophobic segments by the translocon.

The positive-inside rule (von Heijne and Gavel, 1988) governs
the overall orientation of a protein, so that there is a global pattern
of positively charged amino acids in the loops that occur on the peri-
plasmic side of the membrane. The exact way in which the positive-
inside rule acts is unclear, but even the presence or lack of positively
charged residues close to the C-terminal can shift the orientation of
the protein entirely (Seppala et al., 2010). Ultimately, the combin-
ation of hydrophobic segments recognized by the translocon and the

localization of positive charges determines the topology of mem-
brane proteins.

All membrane protein topology predictors take into account the
biological mechanisms for membrane protein biogenesis, consciously
or non-consciously. Many different computational methods, including
Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) (Kall et al., 2004, 2005; Krogh
et al., 2001; Tusnady and Simon, 2001; Viklund and Elofsson, 2004,
2008), Support vector machines (SVMs) (Nugent and Jones, 2009),
Dynamic Bayesian Networks (Reynolds et al., 2008) and Artificial
Neural Networks (Jones, 2007a; Viklund et al., 2008) have been used
in topology prediction. A common feature in all these methods is that
they identify hydrophobic TM helices and then combine these predic-
tions with the positive-inside rule in order to determine the topology.
The positive-inside rule is used to allow for less hydrophobic TM-
segments to be recognized if this results in that more positive residues
are found in periplasmic loops. Exactly how the balance between the
hydrophobicity cut-off and the positive-inside rule is optimized varies
between methods. In some methods, such as TOPPRED (Claros and
von Heijne, 1994) the two parts are performed independently, while in
most others the optimization is done simultaneously.

In contrast to most other topology predictors, the SCAMPI pre-
dictor performs topology prediction using no additional information
apart from the hydrophobicity of the segments and the positive-in-
side rule (Bernsel et al., 2008). SCAMPI only requires that two par-
ameters, namely the hydrophobicity weight and the relative weight
of the positive-inside rule, are optimized. The performance of
SCAMPI is comparable with other state-of-the-art methods that util-
ize much more complicated schemes and many more parameters
(Viklund and Elofsson, 2008).

One frequent problem when predicting the topology is that TM-
helices are often erroneously predicted in non-TM domains. This
problem becomes stronger in predictors that show the best overall
performance (Tsirigos et al., 2012). The reason is that the hydropho-
bicity of the most hydrophobic segments in non-TM domains may
overlap with the hydrophobicity of some TM helices, see Figure 1.
This makes it impossible to use a single strict cut-off to separate
membrane and non-membrane regions, see the overlapp in Figure 1.

C-terminal helices are compared with the hydrophobicity of the most hydro-
phobic region located in a soluble domain. The overlap between the non-TM
and TM hydrophobicity indicate regions that computationally are difficult to
distinguish

Most non-TM proteins never see the translocon and therefore
the insertion of hydrophobic non-TM segments is not a problem
in vivo (Elofsson and von Heijne, 2007). Here, the targeting of
proteins to the translocon is either guided by a signal peptide or by
the most N-terminal TM-helix. In either case, the N-terminal helix
is, on average, more hydrophobic than later helices (Hedin et al.,
2010), see Figure 1. From a prediction point-of—view, this means
that, at least one helix in a TM-protein, has to be more hydropho-
bic than almost any segment in a non-TM protein. This fact has
been used by many predictors by including a prefilter that deter-
mines whether a protein is a membrane or a non-membrane one
(Bernsel et al., 2008; Jones, 2007). In Figure 1, it can be seen that
the overlap in hydrophobic regions of non-TM proteins (dotted
line) is smaller for the N-terminal helix, than for the other TM-
helices. Because of that, a stricter cut-off can be used in the prefil-
ter, resulting in fewer falsely predicted TM-proteins. Although this
strategy is useful for TM-protein identification, it does not solve
the problem of falsely identifying TM helices in non-TM domains
of a TM-protein.

In addition to the more hydrophobic N-terminal helix, we recently
found that the C-terminal TM-helix is also more hydrophobic than
central TM-helices (Virkki et al., 2014), see Figure 1. To understand
this, we have to take into account marginally hydrophobic helices, i.e.
helices that under normal circumstances are not fully recognized by the
translocon. These helices can be inserted if the number of positively
charged residues in an inside loop is sufficient. However, we noted that
the effect of the positive residues in the loop is weaker if they are
located at the C-termini, i.e. if they are not followed by another TM-

helix. It therefore seems as if the positive-inside rule is stronger when a
following TM helix is present. Since no TM-helix follows the most C-
terminal helix, the insertion of it cannot be aided by the positive-inside
rule, i.e. it needs to be sufficiently hydrophobic to be inserted by itself
(Virkki et al., 2014).

To the best of the authors’ knowledge, all topology predictors
treat all TM-helices equally and do therefore ignore the fact that the
N- and C—terminal TM-helices should be more hydrophobic. Here,
we present a new version of SCAMPI that improves predictions by
utilizing this observation.

2 Methods

In the original SCAMPI method, only two parameters, namely pKR
and AGshift, are optimized, see Figure 2. pKR stands for the positive-in-
side bias, which is the ratio of positively charged residues between the
inside and the outside of the membrane. AGshift is a hydrophobicity
parameter used for the identification of TM helices. The topology is
produced by finding the optimal path through an HMM with AGshjft
and mm as the only optimizable parameters. However, for large-scale
use, a strict prefilter based on the AG of the most hydrophobic region
was employed in order to separate TM and non-TM proteins. In
Table 1, it can be seen that both AGshift and the prefilter cut-off are
higher than 0, i.e. even helices that, experimentally, have <5 0%
chance to be inserted into the membrane, have a good chance to pass
the filter. The optimal AGshjft is actually close to the value that is best
at separating TM and non-TM regions.

In the new version of SCAMPI, we introduce two additional par-
ameters, AGN and AGC. These are the hydrophobicity parameters for
the N- and C—terminal helices. For SCAMPI2, all four parameters were

optimized based on a 3-fold cross-validation, using a grid-search (see
Supplementary information for details). If several sets of parameters
provide identical performance, they are all used. Therefore, there is an
upper and lower limit in some of the numbers in Table 2. Similar to the
original SCAMPI version, there are two ﬂavors of SCAMPI2, one that
uses single sequence and one that uses multiple sequence alignments
(MSA). In the later case, the MSA is obtained using PSI-BLAST
(Altschul et al., 1997) with Uniref90 (Suzek et al., 2015) as reference
database. The MSA version is identical to the single sequence version
but uses the average AG for all the sequences in the MSA, see
Supplementary information.

TM proteins were extracted from the PDBTM database (Kozma
et al., 2013) and mapped to the respective Uniprot (UniProt
Consortium, 2014) sequences using the SIFTS database (Velankar
et al., 2013). In contrast to some earlier studies, the full-length
Uniprot sequences are used and not only the structurally determined
regions. We assumed that no additional TM regions were present. A
correct predicted topology requires that (i) the number of TM re-
gions is correctly predicted, (ii) the location of each predicted helix
overlaps with at least five residues with the observed helix and (iii)
the N- and C—termini are located to be at the correct side of the
membrane.

For topology assignment, we used PDBTM, OPM (Lomize et al.,
2006), TOPDB (Dobson et al., 2014) and Uniprot annotations.
After performing a 20% sequence identity homology reduction,
285 TM-proteins remained. Of them, 60 proteins contain non-mem-
brane domains longer than 200 residues (denoted as long domains
in Table 2). As a non-TM set 3597 non-TM proteins originating
from SIGNALP4.0 (Petersen et al., 2011) and previously used in
TOPCONS (Tsirigos et al., 2015) were used for evaluation. For the

Methods that are marked with an asterisk (*) include a preﬁlter, methods with dagger (T) also predict signal peptides. The accuracies are measured on the entire

dataset (Overall), only the membrane proteins (TM), only the membrane proteins with long non-TM domains (Long) and the non-TM proteins (non-TM). The re-

sults for SCAMPIZ are cross validated, while the others are not. However, during the cross validation it is possible that in the training set several different param-

eters provide identical results. In such cases, all these parameters were tested and the maximum/minimum results are shown in the table. For TM proteins without

a signal peptide, a topology is deemed correct when the predicted topology has the same N-terminal, same number of TM helices as the experimentally veriﬁed

one and the helices overlap by at least ﬁve residues. For TM proteins with a signal peptide, a correct topology for SCAMPI (and other methods not designed for

signal peptide prediction) is considered if no TM regions are predicted in the N-terminal part of the protein. The non-TM accuracy is given for the large dataset

containing 3597 non-TM proteins and it requires that neither TM helix nor a signal peptide is predicted in these proteins

3 Results and discussion

When optimizing the parameters for SCAMPI2, AGShift (describing
the hydrophobicity cut-off for central helices) is set to 1.00 kcal/mol,
slightly higher than the numbers in the original SCAMPI version
(0.80), see Table 1. This provides the opportunity for less hydropho-
bic helices to be inserted, as opposed to the original SCAMPI.
However, the cut-offs for N- and C—terminal helices, AGN and AGC,
are set to be much stricter, —1.60 and —1.40, respectively. This re-
sults in that marginally hydrophobic regions that may occur before
or after the TM regions are not erroneously predicted. This increases
the accuracy for membrane proteins that contain non-TM domains
longer than 200 residues, see Table 2. In Figure 3, we show four ex-
amples where SCAMPI2 avoids erroneous predictions.

The original single-sequence-based SCAMPI method predicts the
correct topology for 61% of the proteins but only for 35% of the pro-
teins with long non-TM domains, see Table 2. Furthermore, around
one-third of non-TM proteins are wrongly classified as TM-proteins.
This gives an overall accuracy in our benchmark of 67%. Adding
a prefilter increases the overall accuracy to 78% by improving the

separation between TM and non-TM proteins drastically. Using MSA,
the overall accuracy increases to 74% without the prefilter and to 85%
with the prefilter, but still only 43% of the proteins with long non-TM
domains are predicted correctly.

The overall performance of SCAMPI2 is 79—81 % when using sin-
gle sequences and 86% when using MSA, see Table 2. More import-
antly, the prediction accuracy for the subset of proteins with the long
non-TM domains is increased to 5 3—5 7 and 67%, respectively.
Further, the discrimination between TM and non-TM proteins is
slightly better in SCAMPIZ than when using the prefilter and
SCAMPI. Still, ~40% (25% for MSA) of the topologies are wrongly
predicted. An analysis of the errors indicates that 10% (3%) of the
proteins are predicted in a wrong orientation of the entire protein in
SCAMPI, while 25% (15%) are due to over or under-prediction of
TM-helices and the rest because of misplaced helices.

In contrast to other state-of-the-art methods, SCAMPI2 only
uses four parameters, yet its performance is comparable to more
sophisticated predictors, see Table 2. For single-sequence methods,
Philius shows a slightly better performance within the TM proteins,
but Philius is not as accurate as SCAMPI2 for the separation of TM
and non-TM proteins, which results in a similar overall perform-
ance. One important difference between Philius and SCAMPI2 is
that Philius treats signal peptides separately, indicating a possible
path toward further improvement of SCAMPI.

For MSA methods, there is a similar picture, with MEMSAT3
showing a better topology predictions of TM proteins, but being
slightly worse at separating TM and non-TM proteins. Finally, the
consensus predictor TOPCONS that combines the predictions from
several methods, including SCAMPI, shows a slightly higher per-
formance than SCAMPI2.

However, SCAMPI2 has some additional advantages over the
other methods; first it is significantly faster than Philius or
MEMSAT3 (in single- or multiple-sequence modes, respectively).
Moreover, the results presented here are cross validated, whereas for
the rest of the methods there is certainly some overlap between our
datasets and their training set.

Finally, we found it interestingly that the method that is best at sep-
arating TM and non-TM proteins is the 15 -years-old TMHMM, with
99% accuracy. However, the good separation comes at the price of
non-optimal accurate topology predictions. The accuracy is 56 versus
63% for HMMTOP developed at the same time. This highlights the
importance and problems with recognition of marginally hydrophobic
helices. If they are recognized, the topology predictions are better but
there is a higher chance of false predictions in non-TM proteins.

4 Conclusions

We present a novel topology prediction method, SCAMPIZ, that, to
the best of the authors’ knowledge, for the first time uses the obser-
vation that the N- and C-terminal helices in a TM-protein are, on
average, more hydrophobic than the other TM-helices. By increasing
the hydrophobicity requirement for the N- and C-terminal helices in
TM proteins, it is possible to improve topology predictions, in par-
ticular for proteins with long non-TM domains. An additional ad-
vantage of this method is that no prefilter to distinguish TM and
non-TM protein is required. Clearly, the difference in hydrophobi-
city of central and terminal helices could also be included in other
methods, demonstrating therefore a possible improvement for all
topology predictors, in particular if the hydrophobicity of signal
peptides is also taken into account.

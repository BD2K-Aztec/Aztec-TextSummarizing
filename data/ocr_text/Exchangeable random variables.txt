In his seminal text, Testing Statistical Hypotheses, ﬁrst set down
in the late 1950s, the late and sorely missed Eric Lehmann wrote, ‘. . .
one may prefer to try to obtain an exact level-a unbiased test (valid
for all [probability distributions] f) by replacing the original normal
model with the nonparametric model for which the joint density of
the variables is

f(X1)---f(Xm)f(yi-A)---f(yn-A) (1)

where f is a member of the family of probability densities that are
continuous almost everywhere.’

Apermutation test g0(x1 , . . . ,xm , y1 , . . .yn) for testing A = 0 against
A > 0 is obtained by choosing a set of rearrangements S of the n +m
observations, such that

(n+m)! ,
mun): Lamb“ 

 

If Equation (1) be satisﬁed, then all sets S are equally likely
under the null hypothesis. To obtain a permutation test that is both
unbiased and most powerful, one need only select the set S so
that its probability under the alternative A > 0 is a maximum. This
is accomplished in most cases by rejecting the hypothesis for all
values of the test statistic that lie in the upper tail of the permutation
distribution.

As research during the intervening half century has amply
demonstrated, permutation tests should be used to do all of the
following:

(1) Make a multivariate comparison of population means.
(2) Analyze the one-way layout.

(3) Compare variances.

(4) Analyze cross-over designs.

(5) Analyze contingency tables.

(See, for example, Resampling Methods, Good, Birkhauser, 3rd edn,
2005).

But permutation tests are applicable only if the observations
are exchangeable, that is, if under the null hypothesis, the
joint distribution in Equation (1) remains invariant under all
rearrangements of the subscripts. [See, for example, Good, P. (2002)
Extensions of the concept of exchangeability and their applications.
J. Modern Appl. Statist. Methods, 1, 243—247.]

Thus the belated rediscovery by Yifan Huang, Haiyan Xu,
Violeta Calian, and Jason C. Hsu writing in Bioinformatics 2006,
22, 2244—2248 that ‘for such tests, if the two distributions are
not identical (as for example when they have unequal variances,
correlations or skewness), then a permutation test for equality of
means based on difference of sample means can have an inﬂated
Type I error rate even when the means are equal’ comes as a surprise
only to those authors and to their article’s reviewers.

Conﬂict of Interest: none declared.

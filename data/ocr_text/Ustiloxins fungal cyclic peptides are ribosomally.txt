Abstract

Motivation: Ustiloxins A and B are toxic cyclic tetrapeptides, Tyr—Val/AIa—IIe—Gly (Y—V/A—I—G), that
were originally identified from Ustilaginoidea virens, a pathogenic fungus affecting rice plants.
Contrary to our report that ustiloxin B is ribosomally synthesized in Aspergillus flavus, a recent re—
port suggested that ustiloxins are synthesized by a non—ribosomal peptide synthetase in U.virens.
Thus, we analyzed the U.virens genome, to identify the responsible gene cluster.

Results: The biosynthetic gene cluster was identified from the genome of U.virens based on
homologies to the ribosomal peptide biosynthetic gene cluster for ustiloxin B identified from
A.flavus. It contains a gene encoding precursor protein having five Tyr—VaI—IIe—Gly and three
Tyr—AIa—IIe—Gly motifs for ustiloxins A and B, respectively, strongly indicating that ustiloxins A and
B from U. virens are ribosomally synthesized.

Availability and implementation: Accession codes of the U.virens and A.flavus gene clusters in
NCBI are BR001221 and BR001206, respectively.

1 Introduction

Ustiloxins are toxic cyclic peptides that were originally identified
from Ustilaginoidea virens, a pathogenic fungus affecting rice plant
(Koiso et al., 1992, 1994, 1998). The circular moieties of these pep—
tides are composed of Tyr—Val/Ala—Ile—Gly tetrapeptides that are
circularized at the side—chains of Tyr and He (Koiso et 61]., 1992,
1994, 1998). Ustiloxin A, a derivative of ustiloxin peptides, contains
a circularized tetrapeptide With the composition of Tyr-Val-Ile-Gly
(YVIG), Whereas ustiloxin B, another derivative of ustiloxin pep—
tides, contains the circularized peptide of Tyr-Ala-Ile-Gly (YAIG).

The aromatic rings of the Tyr residues in both ustiloxins A and B are
modified by norvaline, a non—protein—coding amino acid, through a
sulfoxide bond (Koiso et 61]., 1994, 1998) (Fig. 1).

Recently, the ustiloxin B biosynthetic gene cluster was eXperi—
mentally identified from Aspergillus ﬂavus using a novel method to
predict gene clusters from transcriptome data, MIDDAS—M, and the
subsequent validation by liquid chromatography—mass spectrometry
analysis of the gene deletion mutants (Umemura et 61]., 2013, 2014).
The ustiloxin B gene cluster contains 15 genes including those
encoding a fungal type C6 transcription factor, a major facilitator

superfamily transporter and cytochrome P450. Until recently, this
cyclic peptide was believed to be biosynthesized by the so—called
non—ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) because it contains a non—
proteinogenic amino acid, norvaline, in its chemical structure.
However, bioinformatic analyses of amino acid sequence indicated
that no NRPS domains were observed in the gene cluster (Umemura
et al., 2013). Instead, a function—unknown gene, ustA, with a trans-
lated product containing 16 repeats of the tetrapeptide YAIG, which
is the exact amino acid sequence of the cyclic moiety of ustiloxin B,
was identified in the gene cluster (Umemura et al., 2014) (Fig. 1A).
Consequently, ustiloxin B was shown to be the first case of a riboso—
mally synthesized peptide reported from filamentous fungi
(Umemura et al., 2014).

Very recently, Zhang et al. (2014) reported the whole genome se—
quence of U.virens, and proposed that an NRPS gene cluster is re—
sponsible for biosynthesis of ustiloxins in U.virens. However, our
analysis strongly suggests that an entirely different gene cluster is re—
sponsible for the ustiloxin biosynthesis as ribosomal peptides in
U.virens, based on homology to the ustiloxin B biosynthetic gene
cluster from A. ﬂat/us.

2 Methods

2.1 Reannotation of coding sequences in the ustiloxin B
gene cluster from A.flavus by RNA—seq analysis

To reannotate the gene coding sequences (CDSs) in the ustiloxin B
biosynthetic gene cluster, we performed RNA—seq analysis using
15 types of transcriptome data for A. ﬂat/us obtained under different
conditions in the NCBI SRA database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/SRA) (accession codes. SRR283857, SRR283858, SRR495778,
SRR495942, SRR495943, SRR544871, SRR544872, SRR544873,
SRR610531, SRR610532, SRR610533, SRR610534, SRR610535,
SRR6 105 37 and SRR6 105 38). We mapped the sequence reads >30
bp after trimming the bases with average quality values of <20 over
7 bases, without unidentified bases, on the genome sequence of
A.ﬂavus, GenBank EQ963472—EQ96623211, using the Bowtie
(Langmead et al., 2009) and Tophat (Trapnell et al., 2009)

softwares on a DELL server with Ubuntu 13.10 (CPU, Intel Xeon
E52643; memory, 256 GB; hard disk, 40 TB). We visually observed
the mapping results in the region of the ustiloxin cluster,
AFLA_094940—AFLA_095110 (Umemura et al., 2013, 2014), using
the IGV software (Robinson et al., 2011) and determined the region
without inconsistencies in the start and stop codons as the gene cod—
ing regions.

The ustiloxin B biosynthetic gene cluster from A.ﬂavus contained
15 genes; two pairs of two genes, AFLA_095 000—AFLA_095 010 and
AFLA_095080—AFLA_095090, were concatenated to single genes;
AFLA_094970 was omitted because it did not express; the CDSs for
eight genes, AFLA_094950, AFLA_094960, AFLA_094990,
AFLA_095020, AFLA_095050, AFLA_095070, AFLA_095100 and
AFLA_095110, were corrected. The other five genes in the
ustiloxin cluster, AFLA_094940, AFLA_094980, AFLA_095030,
AFLA_095040 and AFLA_095060, were identical to those in the
NCBI database after RNA—seq analysis. The functions of the reanno-
tated genes were analyzed by Blastp search (Altschul et al., 1997)
against UniProtKB (Magrane and Consortium, 2011) (Table 1).

2.2 Identification of the ustiloxin gene cluster from the
U. virens genome

A tBLASTX search (Altschul et al., 1997) was performed against the
U.virens genome sequence of UV—8b (NCBI accession nos.
JHTR01000001—JHTR01000449) (Zhang et al., 2014) with an
E—value cutoff of <1e—4 using all 15 gene sequences of the ustiloxin
B gene cluster from A.ﬂavus identified by the RNA—seq analysis as
queries. The region detected by the tBLASTX search in the U.virens
genome was reannotated by the pipeline used for the Aspergillus
oryzae and Umbelopsis isabellina genomes (Machida et al., 2005;
Takeda et al., 2014). Briefly, the pipeline uses two different types of
gene finding methods, ALN (Gotoh, 2000) and GlimmerHMM
(Majoros et al., 2004). The ALN method predicts gene structures
based on homologies to known genes. In this case, the 15 ustiloxin
biosynthetic genes from A.ﬂavus, genes encoded in the A. oryzae
genome and genes in the UniProtKB database (Magrane and
Consortium, 2011) were used as the known genes. The prediction of

gene structure by GlimmerHMM depends on the statistical features
of genes, such as frequencies of codons in exons and nucleotides
around splice sites. Regarding the precursor gene, uv_ustA,
UV8b_7487 was adopted because it retains the signal peptide.
Because the sequence of UV8b_7487 is largely different from the se-
quence of A.ﬂavus ustA in the repeat count of the core peptide
(Fig. 1), it is difficult to correctly align the A. ﬂat/us ustA sequence es—
pecially at the 5’ terminal against U.virens genome. Using the amino
acid sequences of the reannotated genes in the sequence region of
the U.virens genome as queries, Blastp search (Altschul et al., 1997)
was performed against the 15 A.ﬂavus ustiloxin genes after the
RNA—seq analysis to evaluate homologies between the two gene
clusters from U.virens and A.ﬂavus, and against the UniProtKB
(Magrane and Consortium, 2011) database to annotate their func—
tion (Table 1).

2.3 NRPS analyses

The NRPS gene clusters in the U.virens scaffold of JHTR01000005
(Zhang et al., 2014), which contains the gene cluster Zhang et al.
(2014) believed to be the ustiloxin biosynthetic cluster, were
analyzed using the antiSMASH program (Blin et al., 2013; Medema
et al., 2011). One NRPS gene cluster from UV8b_1483 to
UV8b_1497 was detected, including two and one NRPS A domains
in UV8b_1490 and UV8b_1491, respectively. The amino acid se—
quence of UV8b_1490 was aligned with the sequence of the destrux—
ins (Dtxs) NRPS gene from Metar/oizium anisopliae (UniProtKB;
E9FCP4) using the MAFFT program (Katoh et al., 2005).

3 Results and discussion

3.1 Identification of the ustiloxin biosynthetic gene
cluster in the U.virens genome

Our sequence analysis revealed that the U.virens genome sequence
(Zhang et al., 2014) contains a gene cluster homologous to the usti—
loxin B biosynthetic gene cluster in A. ﬂat/us (Fig. 2A). The U.virens

gene cluster is composed of 13 genes, out of which 10 genes of
UV8b_7484—UV8b_7494 were already annotated (Zhang et al.,
2014) but three other genes newly annotated by us, all of which are
highly homologous to the genes in the ustiloxin B biosynthetic gene
cluster from A. ﬂat/us (Table 1). The order and direction of the genes
in U.virens are different from those in A. ﬂat/us, but the components
of the cluster are the same in both genomes, except the former lacks
two peptidase genes, ustP and ustH.

In U.virens, UstA, the precursor protein for ustiloxins, has five
YVIG motifs and three YAIG motifs for ustiloxin A and ustiloxin B,
respectively, whereas 16 YAIG motifs have been identified in UstA
from A.ﬂavus (Umemura et al., 2014) (Fig. 1). The sequence charac—
teristics are fairly consistent; U. virens produces both ustiloxin A and
B (Koiso et al., 1992, 1994), whereas A.ﬂavus produces only usti—
loxin B (Umemura et al., 2013, 2014). This report indicates that two
types of ustiloxins are synthesized from a single precursor protein,
UstA, which is the first identification of the precursor protein for the
ribosomal peptide ustiloxin A. Our results strongly suggest that the
cyclic peptide ustiloxins are not synthesized by NRPS but are instead
ribosomally synthesized in U. virens, in the same manner as in
A. ﬂat/us.

3.2 Previously reported NRPS as ustiloxin biosynthetic
gene

In the recent article on the U.virens genome sequence, Zhang et al.
(2014) suggested that ustiloxins are synthesized by an NRPS and
proposed that an NRPS gene cluster was responsible for ustiloxin
biosynthesis (Fig. 1B). They selected the UV8b_1490 gene as the
NRPS for ustiloxin biosynthesis because it is similar to the NRPS for
Dtxs biosynthesis in Metarkizium robertsii, an insect pathogenic
fungus (Wang et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2014). Although Zhang
et al. (2014) insisted that ustiloxin compounds are similar to Dtxs,
they are composed of an oc—hydroxyisocaproic acid and the five resi—
dues of L—proline (Pro) or pipecolic acid (Pip), L-isoleucine (Ile) or
L-valine (Val), N—methyl-L-valine (MeVal), N—methyl-L-alanine

U.virens. (B) The putative NRPS cluster for ustiloxin biosynthesis suggested by Zhang et al.

(MeAla) and ﬂ—alanine (ﬂ—Ala) (Wang et al., 2012), indicating an en-
tirely different amino acid composition from that of ustiloxins
(Supplementary Figure S1). Furthermore, the NRPS gene
(Uv8b_1490) suggested by Zhang et al. (2014) contains only two
NRPS adenylation (A) domains according to an antiSMASH ana—
lysis (Blin et al., 2013; Medema et al., 2011). The amino acid se—
quence of UV8b_1490 only shared 16% similarity with the NRPS
for Dtxs (UniProtKB; E9FCP4), which contains six NRPS A do-
mains, according to the MAFFT software (Katoh et al., 2005 ). Even
including the neighbouring gene UV8b_1491, which contains an A
domain, only three A domains of NRPS in total can be identified in
the gene cluster (Supplementary Figure S1 (B)). With only three A
domains, the NRPS does not synthesize a tetrapeptide, nevertheless
the main cyclic component of both ustiloxins A and B is composed
of a tetrapeptide. Instead of NRPS domains, we identified a gene
corresponding to the precursor protein UstA, which contains the
cyclic moiety of ustiloxins A and B (YVIG and YAIG, respectively),
in the gene cluster from the U.virens genome. Therefore, we con—
clude that ustiloxins are ribosomally synthesized in U.virens, in the
same manner as in A. ﬂat/us.

3.3 Comparison of the two ustiloxin gene clusters from
U. virens and A. flavus

The ustiloxin gene cluster from U.virens exhibits some differences
from the A.flavus cluster. The primary difference is that the two
genes encoding peptidases, ustH and ustP, were not identified within
the ustiloxin gene cluster in U.virens. The ustH and ustP genes en—
code a glutathione hydrolase and peptidase S41 family protein, re-
spectively, both of which are major enzymes in fungi. Thus, the
functions of UstH and UstP essential for the ustiloxin biosynthesis in
A.flavus were considered to be compensated by the gene products
involved in basic metabolism in the case of U.virens.

Another significant difference is the order of the genes in the
cluster between U.virens and A.flavus (Fig. 2). Only a set of three
genes in the U.virens cluster, UV8b_7486, UV8b_7485 and
UV8b_7484, are conserved in the same order as in the A. ﬂat/us clus—
ter. Both clusters include two pairs of homologous genes, ustF1-
ustFZ and ustYa-usth; however, the genes in each pair are located
adjacent to each homologue in the U.virens cluster, whereas they are
located separately in the A. ﬂat/us cluster (Fig. 2). These homologues
may represent a duplication event in U.virens and may have sepa—
rated during the evolution of A. flat/us. Comparing the ustiloxin gene

clusters from U.virens and A.flavus will lead to further character—
ization of the ustiloxin biosynthetic pathway.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: The typical workflow for NMR structure determination
involves collecting thousands of conformational restraints,
calculating a bundle of 20—40 conformers in agreement with
them and refining the energetics of these conformers. The structure
calculation step employs simulated annealing based on molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations with very simplified force fields. The
value of refining the calculated conformers using restrained MD
(rMD) simulations with state-of-art force fields is documented. This
refinement however presents various subtleties, from the proper
formatting of conformational restraints to the definition of suitable
protocols.

Results: We describe a web interface to set up and run calculations
with the AMBER package, which we called AMPS-NMR (AMBER-
based Portal Server for NMR structures). The interface allows
the refinement of NMR structures through rMD. Some predefined
protocols are provided for this purpose, which can be personalized;
it is also possible to create an entirely new protocol. AMPS-NMR can
handle various restraint types. Standard rMD refinement in explicit
water of the structures of three different proteins are shown as
examples. AMPS-NMR additionally includes a workspace for the
user to store different calculations. As an ancillary service, a web
interface to AnteChamber is available, enabling the calculation of
force field parameters for organic molecules such as ligands in
protein—ligand adducts.

Availability and Implementation: AMPS-NMR is embedded within
the NMR services of the WeNMR project and is available at
http://py-enmr.cerm.unifi.it/access/index/amps-nmr; its use requires
registration with a digital certificate.

1 INTRODUCTION

Since the 1980’s NMR spectroscopy has been used as a technique
complementary to X—ray to determine the solution structure of
proteins (Cavanagh et al., 1996; Wuthrich 1986). Indeed, NMR has

contributed ~12% of the total content of protein structures in the
PDB (Berman et al., 2000), a share that has remained relatively
steady in the last few years. The usefulness of applying NMR as
a tool complementary to X—ray in protein structure determination
efforts has been extensively documented in the context of Structural
Genomics initiatives (Synder et al., 2005; Yee et al., 2005). A unique
aspect of NMR data is their capability to provide a View of protein
structural features that includes unfolded proteins and the residue—
speciﬁc characterization of disordered protein segments, including
functionally important ﬂexible surface loops (Bemado et al., 2005;
Mittermaier and Kay, 2009).

Standard protocols to determine protein structures by NMR
involve three basic steps: (i) determining the chemical shift
assignments of the target protein; (ii) measuring as many as possible
intra— and, particularly (Doreleijers et al., 1999), inter—residue NOEs
(nuclear Overhauser enhancements) among 1H nuclei to generate
proton—proton distance restraints (typically in the form of upper
distance bounds); and (iii) using the NOE—derived restraints to
perform simulated annealing calculations providing the 3D structure
of the protein. Additional restraints can be used, such as dihedral
angle restraints [which often are derived from J —couplings (Karplus,
1959) or from chemical shifts (Shen et al., 2009)], residual dipolar
couplings (rdc’s) (Tjandra et al., 1997), and paramagnetism—based
restraints (Bertini et al., 1996). More recently, alternative protocols
that are based on the use of chemical shift data (Shen et al., 2008)
or chemical shift and rdc’s (Raman et al., 2010) without any NOE
information have been described. However, the adoption of these
innovative protocols by the NMR community is still limited. Within
standard protocols, an additional step that may have a dramatic
impact on the quality of the ﬁnal NMR structure is structure
reﬁnement, which typically involves the application of molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations using a force ﬁeld more accurate than
that employed to generate the structural models to be reﬁned.
Indeed, it has long been realized that, due to the sparseness of
NMR restraints, the force ﬁeld used for reﬁnement can have a large
impact on the quality, and possibly the accuracy, of NMR structures
(Chen et al., 2004; Linge and Nilges 1999; Linge et al., 2003).
Reﬁnement of protein structures using state—of—the—art force ﬁelds
in MD calculations with explicit solvent molecules can afford a
signiﬁcant improvement of various stereochemical parameters that
are often used as indicators of structural quality and can also have
a positive impact on the accuracy of the structure, as measured
from the agreement with the NMR constraints (Nabuurs et al.,

2004; Nederveen et al., 2005). On the other hand, these very same
reﬁnement procedures may mask errors in the NMR structures,
at least as far as the normality of stereochemical parameters is
concerned (Nabuurs et al., 2006; Saccenti and Rosato, 2008).

Despite the last caveat, there is large consensus in the bio—
NMR community that structure reﬁnement in explicit solvent
should be included in standard protocols for the solution structure
determination of proteins. To this end, one can use specialized MD
programs, such as CNS (Brunger, 2007) or OPAL (Luginbuhl et al.,
1996) (which is no longer distributed), or more general packages
such as AMBER (Case at al., 2005), CHARMM (Brooks et al., 2009)
or GROMACS (Van Der et al., 2005). It is important to note that
not all of these programs comprise their own force ﬁeld (i.e. a third—
party force ﬁeld may be needed) and that often a program can be
used with more than one force ﬁeld. As a complementary approach
to reﬁnement in explicit solvent, the use of implicit solvent models
may also be warranted. For example, the AMBER package allows
the use of the Generalized Born model for this purpose (Xia et al.,
2002); this model might perform even better than explicit solvent
where large amounts of conformational space needs to be explored.
General MD programs rely on conversion tools to generate the
correct input data from the restraints used in the upstream structure
calculation program [such as Xplor—NIH (Schwieters et al., 2003),
CNS (Brunger, 2007) or CYANA (Herrmann et al., 2002)], whose
success may sometimes be tricky e. g. because of different atom
naming rules used by different programs. This creates a barrier to
the general use of these programs, thereby effectively restricting
the array of options available to bio—NMR spectroscopists. Another
general aspect is that the reﬁnement strategies to be implemented
require a wall time for calculations that is signiﬁcantly longer than
that required for the calculation of the structural models to be
reﬁned (hours versus minutes). To address these two points, we
developed a web interface that enables a very easy and quick set
up of structure reﬁnement from the restraint data used in common
structural calculation programs and distributes the calculation over
a computational Grid infrastructure comprising several thousands
CPUs. This resource, which we called AMPS—NMR (AMBER—
based Portal Server for NMR structures), is free for academia and
non—proﬁt users; access to the server requires prior registration
with the eNMR.eu Virtual Organization (Bonvin et al., 2010;
Loureiro—Ferreira et al. 2010).

2 METHODS

2.1 AMPS-NMR

To support the development of AMPS—NMR we have decided to use a Web
Application Framework, Pylons 1.0 (http://pylonshq.com/), a lightweight
web framework that emphasizes ﬂexibility and re—use (one of the ﬁrst
projects to leverage the emerging WSGI standard, http://wsgi.org/wsgi/) as
well as rapid development. As with many frameworks, Pylons follow the
Model View Controller (MVC) (Gamma et al., 1994) architectural pattern
to separate the data model with business rules from user interfaces (Fig. 1).
This is generally considered a good practice as it modularizes code, promotes
code reuse and allows multiple interfaces to be applied.

AMPS—NMR is based on an ad hoc mixture of HTML
(http://www.w3.org/), CSS (http://www.w3.org/) and Mako
(http://www.makotemplates.org/) (Fig. 1). The latter is the default
template language for the Pylons web framework, a totally Python—centric
system that is suited to the current generation of WS GI frameworks, and that
offer features that are not found in any other template language. The web

representation outlines the different components (rounded rectangular boxes)
and messages (solid black arrows with text) that constitute the software
system of AMPS—NMR. All interactions with the user take place via a web
browser (rounded black box) interacting with an Apache 2 Web Server
(rounded light gray box). This is the only part of the process visible to
the user. The Web Server exchanges messages with the Pylons Framework
(rounded dark gray boxes), and in particular with the Controller component.
The latter modiﬁes the status of the Model and View components, which, in
turn, signal back to the Web Server via the Controller component to send new
contents to the web browser for user visualization. The software technologies
used are indicated in the white rectangular boxes.

page’s interactivity, speed and usability have been increased through Ajax,
shorthand for Asynchronous JavaScript, XML (http://www.w3.org/XML)
and J Query (http://j query.com/), which is a cross—browser J avaScript library
designed to simplify the client—side scripting of HTML; both are web
development techniques for creating interactive web applications. The intent
is to make web pages more responsive by exchanging small amounts of data
with the server behind the scenes, so that the entire web page does not have
to be reloaded each time the user requests a change. With this approach
we made AMPS—NMR easy to use for an end—user, without requiring any
specialized training.

AMPS—NMR enables the users to create registered accounts through their
own Digital Certiﬁcate (DC) (as detailed in the text in Supplementary
Material), which is strictly required to be able to submit calculations
on the Grid Infrastructure. The DC also allows user data and jobs
to be maintained and managed across multiple work sessions. This
functionality has implemented through the combined use of the HTTPS
authentication protocol and a speciﬁcally designed database built on
version 8.1 of the PostgreSQL Object—Relational DataBase Management
System (http://www.postgresql.org/).

Running a calculation in AMBER through AMPS—NMR is a process
logically split in four macro steps:

(1) input data preparation;
(2) setting MD parameters;
(3) sending the calculation to the Grid infrastructure; and

(4) retrieving the output from the Grid Infrastructure.

In Step (1) the user must upload to her/his AMPS—NMR workspace
(Supplementary Fig. S 1, see also later) a ﬁle containing cartesian coordinates

for a macromolecular structure in PDB format, parameters and topology ﬁle
for any residues not present in the standard AMBER library, NMR restraints
ﬁles (upper distance limits, dihedral angles, pseudocontact shifts (pcs) and
rdc’s). To cope with different atom naming rules, custom numbering and the
possible presence of pseudo atoms, AMPS—NMR exploits newly developed
python—based utilities that automatically convert/adapt all the input data
from the native format of commonly used programs or databases (CYANA,
XPLOR, CNS, TALOS, PDB), to the AMBER format. This process is
completely transparent to the user. For Step (2), AMPS—NMR provides pre—
conﬁgured sets of MD parameters, deﬁned in standard XML. These range
from a simple energy—minimization in water or in vacuo to a multi—step
protocol for the reﬁnement of an NMR structure. AMPS—NMR additionally
allows users to set manually all MD parameters; for this purpose, an
interactive guide, extracted from the AMBER manual, to parameters setting
is available. In Step (3), the user deﬁnes a name for the new calculation. Then,
a series of python routines collect all information about the new calculation,
build all batch commands necessary to submit it, thereby creating a so—called
job, and submit the calculation to the Grid Infrastructure. The submission
process involves deﬁning the user identity. Finally, in Step (4), the portal
allows the user to check the status of the job (i.e. Scheduled, Running and
Completed) and, upon completion, retrieves all output data, making them
available through the AMPS—NMR Filemanager (Supplementary Fig. S2).

Finally, another relevant feature of AMPS—NMR is its persistent user
workspace, where users’ data and jobs are maintained and managed across
multiple work sessions (Supplementary Figs SI and S2). Users can exploit a
simple, user—friendly interface to organize their projects and calculations
within the workspace. This functionality has been implemented through
the combined use of the HTTPS authentication protocol and of the
SQLAlchemy (http://www.sqlalchemy.org/) Python Database Abstraction
Library. SQLAlchemy provides a hi gh—level interface to relational databases
such as Oracle, DB2, MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite. We have adopted
SQLAlchemy because it is unobtrusive to our Python code, allowing us
to map plain old Python objects to database tables without substantially
changing our existing Python code. Further, SQLAlchemy includes both
a database server—independent SQL expression language and an Object—
Relational Mapper (ORM) that allows SQL to persist our application objects
automatically. The entity relationship diagram, a specialized graphic that
illustrates the inter—relationships between entities of the database underlying
the user workspace is shown in Supplementary Figure S3.

2.2 AnteChamber

AnteChamber is a set of programs for molecular mechanics (MM) whose
purpose is to solve the following problems that are encountered during MM
calculations: (i) recognizing the atom type; (ii) recognizing bond type and
judging the atomic equivalence; (iii) generating residue topology ﬁle; and (iv)
ﬁnding missing force ﬁeld parameters and supplying reasonable and similar
substitutes. In the context of a combined use with AMBER, AnteChamber
can automatically generate input force ﬁeld parameters for most organic
molecules, thereby allowing users to use AMPS—NMR to reﬁne the structure
of protein—ligand adducts. To facilitate this, we developed a web interface
for the use of AnteChamber, in the same style of the AMPS—NMR interface
(Supplementary Fig. S4).

2.3 Examples

As examples for the use of AMPS—NMR we took two structures from
structural genomics projects: 2KTO, an all—helical protein and 2LOA, an all—
beta protein. Restraints were taken from the BMRB (Ulrich et al., 2007)
and used without modiﬁcations. They consisted of 889 distances and 382
dihedral angles for 2KTO, and of 1115 distances and 92 dihedral angles
for 2LOA. We used the CYANA web server on the WeNMR page to
calculate 100 conformers using the standard protocol and retained the 20
conformers in best agreement with the restraints. The output pdb ﬁle from
CYANA was submitted to AMPS—NMR with all the available restraints, using

the ‘restrainedMD.xml’ protocol. All conformers were kept for analysis.
To demonstrate the use of AMPS—NMR with a dataset including also rdc’s,
we used structure 2KMV, containing 185 amino acids, which was determined
in our laboratory. We took the ﬁnal bundle of the original CYANA calculation
and reﬁned it with AMPS—NMR, with 2059 distances, 180 dihedral angles
and 84 rdc’s, using the ‘restrainedMDrdc.xml’ protocol. The latter performs
an initial optimization of the alignment tensor parameters and then proceeds
with a calculation scheme identical to ‘restrainedMD.xml’.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 RMD reﬁnement with AMPS-NMR

The Welcome page to AMPS—NMR is shown in Figure 2. The
portal integrates a project manager, which allows the creation of
new projects (i.e. new top—level folders in the available disk space)
as well as the addition of new calculations to existing projects
(corresponding to sub—folders in the project folder, Supplementary
Figs S1 and S2). This organization of the data allows users to store all
their calculations relevant for an individual structure determination
project in a single folder. This can be particularly advantageous when
working on the structural characterization of two or more different
systems, such as the complexes of a protein with two different
ligands, or when trying various calculations schemes.
Alternatively, the ‘New calculation’ button automatically creates
a new folder with a standard name (new_project) followed by a
10—digit random number; this folder will contain the results of the
calculation in a user—deﬁned sub—folder (see next paragraph). The
protocol for the reﬁnement of a protein structure through restrained
molecular dynamics (Clore et al., 1985; Kaptein,R. et al., 1985) with
AMBER comprises three preparation steps and a ﬁnal submission
step (Fig. 3). The ﬁrst step is the upload of the bundle of conformers
(typically 20—40) to be reﬁned. For input to AMPS—NMR, the
entire bundle should be contained in a single PDB ﬁle, which
can be normally produced by the structure calculation program.

of the calculation to the Grid.

The server will automatically prompt the number of conformers
contained in the ﬁle and will notify the user if non—standard amino
acids or ligands are identiﬁed. In the latter case suitable parameter
ﬁles can be generated using the AnteChamber web interface also
provided on the website (Supplementary Fig. S4). After uploading
the PDB, the user can add bonds, ions or solvent molecules to
the system (Fig. 3A). Periodic boundary conditions are applied.
Two standard AMBER force ﬁelds can be selected, after which
the second step becomes available. In this (optional) step, the
available NMR—derived restraints can be included in the calculation
(Fig. 3B). The accepted restraint types are: upper distance limits
(as derived from NOESY spectra or deﬁning hydrogen bonds);
dihedral angle restraints; rdc’s; and pcs. The two latter types of
restraints can be obtained from systems containing a paramagnetic
metal ion (Bertini et al. 1996; Bertini et al., 2005), or, only for
rdc’s, by dissolving the protein sample in orienting media, such
as dilute liquid crystals (Tjandra et al., 1997). The extent of partial
orientation of the protein (for rdc’s) or the anisotropy of the magnetic
susceptibility of the metal ion (for pcs) can be obtained by ﬁtting to
an initial structural model (Banci et al., 1997), using a separate web
interface, AnisoFIT, on the WeNMR site (http://www.wenmr.eu).
After uploading the NMR restraints, the user can proceed to the next
step to deﬁne the calculation protocol. Skipping the optional second
step will result in an unrestrained molecular dynamics simulation
being set up. In the third step, the user can choose to create

her/his own calculation protocol by using the panel on the left side
of the web frame or can upload a predeﬁned protocol using the
‘load protocol’ button below the panel on the right side (Fig. 3C).
To reﬁne an NMR structure of a protein (or protein complex), we
recommend the users to select the predeﬁned ‘restrainedMD.xml’
protocol. The latter implements a calculation strategy similar to
that used for the construction of the DRESS database (Nabuurs
et al., 2004), which has been shown to signiﬁcantly improve the
quality of NMR structures in terms of their compliance to standard
stereochemical features (Saccenti and Rosato, 2008). The reﬁnement
protocol implemented in AMPS—NMR consists of the following
steps: (i) minimization of the hydration shell (whose thickness
can be deﬁned by the user; a layer of 10A is suggested); (ii)
minimization of the entire system (protein, water and counterions
if present); (iii) heating to 300K in 10000 rMD steps; (iv) 30 ps
(15 000 steps with a time step of 2.0 fs) of rMD at constant
temperature and constant pressure (1.0 bar); (v) cooling to 0K in
10000 MD steps; (vi) a ﬁnal energy minimization (Fig. 4). For
calculations including also rdc’s, a preliminary minimization with
all the atoms frozen is carried out to optimize the alignment tensor
parameters (‘restrainedMDrdc.xml’). After choosing the protocol,
the user can proceed to the submission of the calculation. This is
done by selecting the name of the sub—folder in which the results
will be stored (Fig. 3D). The chosen reﬁnement protocol is applied
to each conformer in the bundle. Thanks to the availability of the

WeNMR Grid computational infrastructure, the calculations for each
conformer in the bundle are run in parallel, thereby minimizing the
wall time needed for the overall procedure. Tutorials on how to setup
a calculation with example data are provided on the WeNMR site
(at www.wenmr.eu/wenmr/tutorials/nmr—tutorials/amber).

The Jobs menu allows users to monitor and update the status
of the various jobs. For practical reasons, the Jobs status is not
updated automatically; users must thus use the links at the top
of the job list for this purpose. When the result of an update is
that a job has been completed, the data are automatically retrieved
and saved in the user’s storage space, within the selected folder
structure. In particular, the results for each conformer of the
bundle are stored in a separate folder within the corresponding
calculation sub—folder (Supplementary Fig. S1). From there they
can be downloaded through the Project—> Manage menu, as entire
sub—folders (compressed) or as individual ﬁles. A PDB together with
AMBER output ﬁles are generated at the end of each step of the RMD
protocol of Figure 4; however a user will typically be interested
only in the ﬁles produced after the last step, i.e. after the ﬁnal
energy minimization. To this end, a button allows users to extract
the bundle of reﬁned conformers from a given calculation; energy
and violation statistics can be obtained similarly (Supplementary
Fig. S2). Calculations are typically uploaded to the grid in a few
minutes after the ‘Submit’ button has been pressed. At this point
they will appear in the S status in the Jobs list and will be queuing
at one of the grid sites. We have implemented a mechanism that
allows jobs to be submitted only to sites with a waiting time shorter
than 12h. Among these sites, the one with the largest number of
available CPU’s is selected. The average queue time is <1 h. When
calculations are running, their status in the Jobs list becomes R. For
the examples described in the next paragraphs, the run time was
4—6 h. Thus, from submission to completion the RMD reﬁnement of
a protein structure normally takes between 6 and 18 h.

The results of two example calculations run with the standard
strategy are shown in Figure 5. The re—calculated structures are
essentially indistinguishable, in terms of coordinate deviation, from
the deposited ones. Indeed, for both structures the backbone RMSD
deviation (over ordered residues, Table 1) between the two mean
conformers is less than the sum of the intra—bundle RMSD values
(0.7—0.8 A versus 1.1—1.7 A). Thus, there are no signiﬁcant global

rearrangements. This is also in agreement with the fact that restraint
violations are only marginally affected by the reﬁnement procedure
(Table 1). Further insights on the performance/usefulness of AMPS—
NMR can be obtained by looking at stereochemical parameters. The
Z—scores as well as the residue distribution in the Ramachandran
plot are for the AMBER—reﬁned bundle always very similar to or
better than both the deposited structure and the CYANA structure,
with only a couple of non—signiﬁcant exceptions. In some cases,
signiﬁcant improvements of the Z—scores are observed (highlighted
in Table 1). This is particularly true when comparing to the CYANA
structure, which is not unexpected due to the simpliﬁed force ﬁeld
used by CYANA (Nederveen et al., 2005). The beneﬁcial effects
of reﬁnement with AMPS—NMR are observed in particular for
the MolProbity clashscore (Davis et al., 2007) and the Procheck—
all Z—score. In the latter case, the major contribution is probably
due to improved side chain packing after reﬁnement (Saccenti and
Rosato, 2008). The same trends are observed also for 2KMV, which
additionally includes rdc data.

3.2 Long MD simulations with AMPS-NMR

The most common application of software packages such as
AMBER is presumably the simulation of molecular motions in the
absence of experimental restraints. Given the typical computational
power of the majority of the computing nodes of the current Grid
infrastructure, simulations of this kind for medium—sized proteins
may easily require wall times up to several weeks to reach the
range of simulated time scales that are currently published in the
literature. On the other hand, current Grid management policies
stop calculations that take longer than a predeﬁned wall time (of
the order of one week). To allow long unrestrained MD simulations
to be easily run on the Grid, our interface to set up AMBER
simulations that was described in the preceding section (typically
without adding any NMR restraint ﬁle) can be combined with a
web interface that allows users to rapidly restart the calculations
after their interruption by the Grid middleware. The latter interface
implements a three—step procedure (Supplementary Fig. S5) to: (i)
select a calculation present in the Projects catalog, where the ﬁles
containing the data (coordinates and velocities) necessary to restart
the AMBER simulation are located (the ﬁles will be automatically
identiﬁed); (ii) select (and, if necessary, modify) a saved set of
AMBER parameters to continue the simulation (from a list of either

4 CONCLUDING REMARKS

We have set up a publicly available, free of charge web portal
(AMPS—NMR) facilitating the use of the AMBER package. The
service exploits a Grid computational infrastructure in order to
guarantee that there is always adequate CPU availability, provided
by the European Grid Initiative, for calculations. In addition,
the portal integrates a workspace where users can store their
data and organize their projects and calculations. This service
has been set up initially within the e—NMR collaborative project
(http://www.e—nmr.eu) and it is now maintained in the context of
the WeNMR initiative (http://www.wenmr.eu), which will last until
31 October 2013.

The main intended use of the portal is the reﬁnement of NMR
structures. For this purpose a predeﬁned multi—step protocol (Fig. 4)
is available, effectively removing any need for the user to know
in detail the subtleties of the many parameters needed to set up a
relatively complex MD calculation. The Grid infrastructure easily
allows each conformer of the NMR bundle to be reﬁned separately,
yielding a signiﬁcant saving in time. The portal automatically
handles the native data formats of the most popular structure
calculation programs, making the four—step procedure to start a
calculation seamless from the user’s point of view. The NMR
structure reﬁnement protocol provides appreciable improvements in
various aspects of NMR structures, as indicated by different quality
parameters (Table 1 and Fig. 5). Furthermore, the web interface
can be used also to perform long unrestrained MD simulations.
To comply with Grid policies, these simulations are split into shorter
segments, which the user must manually restart via a speciﬁc web
page.

It is important to underline that even though the present article
and the current implementation of AMPS—NMR mainly focus on the
reﬁnement of protein solution structures, the excellent performance
of AMBER in the reﬁnement of the structure of nucleic acids is well
documented (Tolbert et al., 2010). Actually, the use of AMBER
could be even more useful for these systems than for proteins due
to the greater importance of electrostatics. The extension of AMPS—
NMR to speciﬁcally address also nucleic acid structures is already
underway.

AMPS—NMR has been available to users external to the WeNMR
project since July 2010. At present, there are 42 registered users.
Approximately 700 jobs have been already submitted (including test
jobs), consuming a total of more than 10 000 CPU hours.

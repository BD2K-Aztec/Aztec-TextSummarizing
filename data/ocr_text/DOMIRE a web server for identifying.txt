ABSTRACT

Summary: The DOMIRE web server implements a novel, automatic,
protein structural domain assignment procedure based on 3D
substructures of the query protein which are also found within
structures of a non-redundant protein database. These common 3D
substructures are transformed into a co-occurrence matrix that offers
a global view of the protein domain organization. Three different
algorithms are employed to define structural domain boundaries
from this co-occurrence matrix. For each query, a list of structural
neighbors and their alignments are provided. DOMIRE, by displaying
the protein structural domain organization, can be a useful tool for
defining protein common cores and for unravelling the evolutionary
relationship between different proteins.

1 INTRODUCTION

The modular nature of proteins is well established. First described
at the level of their structure, based on their compactness character
and folding properties (Wetlaufer, 1973), their evolutionary role
has been substantiated by comparing amino acid sequences,
following the pioneering works of Doolittle (1985). Databases such
as ProDom (http://prodom.prabi.fr/prodom/current/html/home.php)
or Pfam (http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/) provide domain deﬁnitions
at the level of amino acid sequences. Databases such as
CATH (http://www.cathdb.info/) and SCOP (http://scop.mrc—
lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/index.html) deﬁne domain at the level of the
3D structures. Domains are exchangeable segments of amino acids
that retain their 3D structure and molecular function. Domain
identiﬁcation is thus an important tool for a number of studies about
protein 3D structures or evolution.

Recently, we applied the protein structure comparison program
VAST (Gibrat et al., 1996; Madej et al., 1995) and we found that
the recurrence of small common 3D substructures (typically four
secondary structures) between the query protein and proteins of a
non—redundant dataset were sufﬁcient to deﬁne the boundaries of the
domains (Tai et al., 2011). The methodology described in the latter

paper is now available as an online server named DOMIRE for
DOMain Identiﬁcation from REcurrence. The server also provides,
for each query, a list of structural neighbors with their alignments.

2 METHODS

Domain deﬁnitions: VAST was used with very liberal cut—offs (Pcli Z —10
and rmsd :5 A) to collect a maximum number of common 3D substructures
between the query protein and target proteins of the non—redundant dataset.
Unaligned regions of <40 residues between two aligned secondary structures
were also included, giving rise to padded Locally Similar Structural Pieces
(pLSSPs). These pLSSPs were mapped onto the query protein, resulting in an
alignment matrix which was then transformed into a co—occurrence N matrix
(Fig. 1a) from which the domains were parsed by three different methods:
PCM, SMF and SVD (see Tai et al., 2011 for details).

Structural neighbors: from the list of pLSSPs used to build the N matrix,
some targets are highlighted when they fulﬁl the following two criteria:
(i) the length of the target pLSSP amounts to 280% of the target length
and (ii) >40% of the target length are aligned by VAST to the query in the
corresponding common 3D substructure. In other words, this region in the
query protein can be extensively aligned with most of the target 3D structure
in the PDB. These targets deﬁne the structural neighbors. Besides the list of
these targets, a graphic representation of their alignments along the query is
provided (Fig. 1b).

DOMIRE input/output: DOMIRE takes as input a single protein chain
with its PDB accession code. Altemately, user can upload a ﬁle of coordinates
with a PDB format. When the job is completed, the user receives an email
to reach a web page displaying three interactive 3D representations of the
query with colored domains using the Jmol applet (one for each domain
assignment method). It shows also the N matrix as a heat map and a contour
map (Fig. 1a) as well as the alignments of the structural neighbors on the
query protein (Fig. 1b). These results are available online for 1 month and
can be downloaded as a tarball.

3 DISCUSSION

With a benchmark of 128 chains, using SCOP or/and CATH
classiﬁcations as gold standards, SMF and SVD algorithms provided
results similar to those of the PUU server but less close to those of
Domain Parser or PDP (Tai et al., 2011). PCM performs better than
SMF and SVD for chains having three or more domains. For that
reason, we provide the results of the three algorithms on the web
site with their, possibly, different boundaries.

The criterion for selecting the structural neighbors of 40% or more
aligned residues is based on the fact that VAST alignments involve
essentially the secondary structures and that on average secondary

D3: (197—398), D4: (399—484), D5: (485—676), D6: (677—785). Note that D1 is a segmented domain as deﬁned in CATH and SCOP. This matrix made of

structures amount to ~50% of the residues of a protein. The criterion
of at least 80% of the target aligned with the query tends to select
regions of the query that can be aligned with whole structures in the
PDB. Some of them are homologues of the query or of its domains
(to be published).

4 CONCLUSION

In addition to offering an automatic partitioning of protein structures
into domains with performances comparable with the best existing
programs, DOMIRE provides the identiﬁcation and alignments of
structural neighbors. This can be useful for identifying remote
homologues. It provides a tool to analyze the common 3D
substructures in polypeptide chains shedding light on their evolution.

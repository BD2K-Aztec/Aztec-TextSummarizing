Abstract

Motivations: Characterizing protein—protein interfaces and the hydrogen bonds is a first step to
better understand proteins’ structures and functions toward high-resolution protein design.
However, there are few large-scale surveys of hydrogen bonds of interfaces. In addition, previous
work of shape complementarity of protein complexes suggested that lower shape complementar-
ity in antibody—antigen interfaces is related to their evolutionary origin.

Results: Using 6637 non-redundant protein—protein interfaces, we revealed peculiar features of
various protein complex types. In contrast to previous findings, the shape complementarity of anti-
body—antigen interfaces resembles that of the other interface types. These results highlight the im-
portance of hydrogen bonds during evolution of protein interfaces and rectify the prevailing belief

that antibodies have lower shape complementarity.

1 Introduction

Interactions are one of the most fundamental activities of biomol—
ecules. Disturbance of these interactions underlie biological disorders
including cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. Characterizing
interactions is important to understand the detailed mechanisms of
life (Russell and Aloy, 2008).

Complementarity is a key concept in molecular recognition.
Previous studies have extracted common features of protein—protein
interfaces and revealed peculiar features of particular classes of inter-
faces. Traditional structural surveys of protein—protein interactions
often divided complexes into hetero-dimers and homo-dimers and
into different functional classes, such as antibody—antigen, enzyme—
inhibitor/substrate and ‘other’ complexes (Jones, 2012; Lo Conte
et al., 1999; Ofran and Rost, 2003; Vreven et al., 2015). A key driving

force of molecular recognition and specificity is forming hydrogen
bonds and salt bridges. Unlike salt bridges, hydrogen bonds are orien-
tation-dependent. Hence, modulating hydrogen bond networks is crit-
ical for specificity in protein engineering and design (Stranges and
Kuhlman, 2013). Hydrogen bonds are also crucial for protein folding
where the patterns formed define secondary structure elements. Based
on 319 protein complexes, Nussinov and co-workers reported that
backbone—backbone hydrogen bonds are dominant within protein
structures whereas side-chain—side—chain hydrogen bonds are most
common across protein—protein interfaces (Xu et al., 1997).

Another important factor in the complementarity of molecular
recognition is the shape of the interfaces. There are several analyses
on shape complementarity of protein interfaces (Lawrence and
Colman, 1993; Tsuchiya et al., 2006). In such an analysis based on

15 of crystal structures including six antibody—antigen complexes, it
was proposed that the shape complementarity of antibody—antigen
interfaces was lower on average than that of protein—protein inter-
faces in general (Lawrence and Colman, 1993). Antibodies evolve
independently of foreign antigens, while other proteins involved in
protein—protein interactions typically evolve with their counterparts,
so that the shape complementarity of general interfaces is optimized
by both partners. However, a later analysis with two high-resolution
crystal structures suggested that the observed lower shape comple-
mentarity of antibody—antigen complexes was due to the low quality
of the crystal structures (Cohen et al., 2005). Since the discussions
were based on a limited number of protein—protein complexes, a
more comprehensive analysis of the complementarities of the inter-
faces is required to understand the essential nature of molecular rec-
ognition and to guide the rational design of protein therapeutics.
The question is relevant today as computational design efforts strive
to create de novo interfaces by optimizing only one protein in the
pair, as antibodies do. Antibodies provide a natural system that can
demonstrate what level of shape complementarity is possible in sin-
gle-sided interface design.

In this study, we focus on hydrogen bond networks using 6637
non-redundant protein complexes. Our main dataset includes 547
antibody VL—VH (light and heavy variable domain) pairs, 191 anti-
body—protein antigen complexes, 104 antibody—peptide antigen
complexes, 88 enzyme—inhibitor/substrate complexes, 102 ‘other’
complexes and 92 obligate complexes. For a reference, we also ana-
lyzed 2251 and 3262 protein—protein interfaces of hetero- and
homodimers. The analyses reveal peculiar features of each protein
complex type. We discuss the impact on antibody modeling, docking
simulations and interface designs.

2 Methods

2.1 Protein interfaces analyzed

The non-redundant antibody structures and the complexes, enzyme—
inhibitor/substrate, ‘other’ complexes, obligate complexes, hetero-
and homo-dimer complexes were taken from the PDB through
SAbDab (Dunbar et al., 2014), Docking Benchmark 5.0 (Vreven
et al., 2015), a work of obligate complexes (Mintseris and Weng,
2005) and the 3D-complex database (Levy et al., 2006), respect-
ively. Antibody structures were renumbered by Chothia’s standard.
Details of the dataset preparation are described in the
Supplementary Materials.

2.2 Hydrogen bond detection and shape
complementarity

Hydrogen bonds and shape complementarity by the SC measure were
calculated using the Rosetta libraries (Leaver-Fay et al., 2011). To
detect hydrogen bonds in protein—protein interfaces, we also used
HBPLUS (McDonald and Thornton, 1994). Since the results of
Rosetta and HBPLUS were comparable, we report only the Rosetta
results. The Rosetta command lines are available in the supplemen-
tary text.

3 Results

3.1 Asymmetric usages of the backbone and side chains
in antibody hydrogen bond networks

To study the pattern of hydrogen bonds in interfaces, we first
focused on the usage of backbone and side-chain polar atoms. As
previously observed (Xu et al., 1997), all interfaces other than

enzyme—inhibitor/substrate complexes showed dominant usage of
side-chain—side-chain hydrogen bonds (34—60%) (Fig. 1).
Interestingly, asymmetric usage of backbone and side chain was
observed in the VL—VH interfaces of antibodies. That is, the VH do-
main uses the backbone while the VL domain mainly uses the side
chain to form hydrogen bonds in the interface (Fig. 1A). Although
the number of hydrogen bonds is small in VL—VH interfaces (average
3.7 i 1.7), this trend is observed broadly across different antibodies
in the dataset with varying germline genes. We analyzed the VL—VH
interfaces as a separate category since VL—VH antibodies are a family
of closely related proteins. Proteins sequences evolve over time.
Likewise, but in much shorter time scale, the VL and VH sequences
diverge from germline genes of light and heavy chains, respectively.
The sequence identities in each domain family typically vary be-
tween 40 and >90%. To eliminate a potential bias caused by germ-
line gene family redundancy, we repeated the same analysis using
the 153 antibodies that have unique germline gene family pairings in
our dataset. Even after removing the redundancy, the observation
still holds (Supplementary Figure S1).

Visual inspection revealed that 94% (595/634) of these VH back-
bone—VL side chain hydrogen bonds involved the backbone of com-
plementarity determining region (CDR) H3 (H95—H102). This
observation can be viewed in light of the antibody evolution.
Relative to VL, VH, especially the CDR-H3, is more diverse in terms
of both sequence and conformation and more often involved with
antigen recognition. Thus, to maintain the VL—VH association, a VH
domain must use the backbone to form proper hydrogen bonds. On
the other hand, the light chain is relatively conserved in terms of se-
quence including CDRs, and it can use the side chain to form hydro-
gen bonds without losing these interactions during the evolution.
This implies that the sequences, especially in VL domain, encode the

correct VL—VH orientation during the antibody evolution, also
emphasizing the importance of the CDR-H3 backbone conform-
ation on the domain orientations.

A dominant hydrogen bond in VL—VH domains was between the
side chains of two glutamines at positions L38 and H39. This pair is
conserved in 86% (471/547) of the VL—VH dataset, and 88% (413/
471) of those side-chain pairs form hydrogen bonds. Despite the
high conservation in the sequences, an experiment has demonstrated
that the L38:Gln—H39zGln hydrogen bond does not correlate with
antibody stability (Tan et al., 1998). Analysis on the relative orienta-
tion of the VL—VH domains of antibodies has become an active area
of research (Abhinandan and Martin, 2010; Chailyan et al., 2011;
Dunbar et al., 2013; Narayanan et al., 2009), along with the de-
mand for high-resolution antibody modeling (Almagro et al., 201 1).
In light of this trend in the field, our analysis characterized VL—VH
interfaces by analyzing hydrogen bond networks, and our observa-
tion may be useful for the correct sampling of VL—VH domain orien-
tations. All hydrogen bonds in VL—VH interfaces are enumerated in
Supplementary Table 52.

Structure prediction of CDR-H3 is also a hot topic in antibody
modeling field (Almagro et al., 2011). Conformations of CDR-H3
can be classified into kink or extend forms (Kuroda et al., 2008),
and a few hydrogen bonds, such as L36:Tyr, appear to contribute
these conformations. However, these residues are not necessarily
conserved when CDR-H3 stems assume the kink conformation
(Kuroda et al., 2008), and these hydrogen bonds in the VL—VH inter-
faces alone do not define either kinked or extended conformations
(Weitzner et al., 2015). The kinked or extended region is defined as
four consecutive Coc atoms (H100X—H103) in antibodies having
CDR-H3 loops longer than four residues. In our VL—VH set, there
are 529 such antibodies, where kinked or extended conformations
are definable. When hydrogen bonds are broken down in the VL—VH
interfaces, 18.1% (354/1951) of them involve the kinked or ex-
tended regions, 30.5% of them involve the rest of the H3 loop and
39.4% of them are between L38:Gln—H39zGln. The remaining
hydrogen bonds are in the other parts of the VL—VH domains.

The difficulty of CDR-H3 modeling arises mainly from the fact
that CDR-H3 is governed by V(D)] recombination. Although D and
J germline gene segments assignments are difficult, we can predict
the V genes using IgBLAST (Ye et al., 2013). We found that, in 10
897 somatic mutations of V genes in our VL—VH set, only 0.95%
(104/ 10 897) of the mutations contribute to hydrogen bonds in the
VL—VH interface. In other words, most of the hydrogen bonds in V
genes are encoded already in germline sequences, in agreement with
our observations that VL domains, which are less variable, tend to
use their side chains to form hydrogen bonds.

The distributions of the number of hydrogen bonds in all types
of the interfaces are available in Supplementary Figure 52. Overall,
the number of hydrogen bonds in the VL—VH interfaces (average 3.7)
was smaller compared with other interfaces (average 62—15 .6), re-
ﬂecting the hydrophobic nature of the VL—VH interfaces. This obser-
vation is consistent with the higher fraction of buried non-polar
atoms in VL—VH interfaces compared with other interfaces
(Supplementary Figure S3).

The average hydrogen bond densities (number of hydrogen
bonds per 100 A2 buried surface area) in each interface are given in
Supplementary Table S3. VL and VH domains and other obligate
complexes do not exist in isolation, i.e. they are always associated to
form a complex. However, a critical difference between VL—VH and
obligate interfaces is that the VL—VH domain pairing is generally
considered to be random, and VH domains can associate with sev-
eral different VL domains, which is known as receptor editing

(de Wildt et al., 1999). The smaller number of hydrogen bonds may
enable the quasi-promiscuous binding.

In antibody—protein antigen interfaces, as expected, there were
more hydrogen bonds to the VH domain than to the VL domain
(5.2 i 3.0 and 2.4 i 2.0, respectively) (Supplementary Figure S2),
emphasizing the importance of the VH domain in antigen recogni-
tion. Forty two percent (418/987) of the VH-mediated hydrogen
bonds involved CDR-H3, followed by CDR-H2 (H52—H56) and
FRH-mediated hydrogen bonds (24 and 23%, respectively). In the
FRH cases, most of the hydrogen bonds were formed by the residues
adjacent to CDRs, such as H58 (in 42 of 231 FRH-mediated hydro-
gen bonds, or 18%), H50 (12%), H33 (12%) and H61 (6%).
Similarly to the VL—VH interfaces, we also found that, in 4,460 som-
atic mutations of V genes in our antibody-protein set, only a small
fraction (163/4460 = 3.7%) of the mutations contribute to hydrogen
bonds in the V genes. Note that, in the antibody-protein interfaces,
about half (49%) of the hydrogen bonds are mediated by CDR-H3
and L3, both of which are generated by V(D)] recombination, and
we investigated only V genes here. Unlike VL—VH interfaces, most of
the interactions in antibody-antigen interfaces are via CDRs. Hence,
it is still possible that hydrogen bonds to antigens would be formed
via somatic mutations in CDR-H3 and L3.

In antibody—peptide interfaces, the number of backbone—back-
bone hydrogen bonds was comparable to the number of backbone—
side-chain or side-chain—backbone hydrogen bonds (Fig. 1C). A pos-
sible explanation is that peptide antigens are smaller than protein
antigens, and the number of residues that can contribute to inter-
actions with the antibody is smaller. As a result, the backbone of
peptide antigens needs to contact the antibody for favorable bind-
ing. On the antibody side, as previously reported in Bates et al.
(1998), peptide recognition of antibodies can be divided into two
structural classes depending on the length of CDR-H3; when H3 is
short (<7 residues), the peptide conformations are extended on the
pocket formed by the six CDR loops whereas when H3 is long
(27 residues), the peptides are buried into the pocket
(Supplementary Figure S4). Due to the spatial constraint, the back-
bones of antibodies more easily contact the peptides, especially in
the latter case, where, on average, there are more hydrogen bonds
between backbones of antibodies and the peptide antigens than the
first class of antibody—peptide complexes (1.6 i 1.3 and 2.9 i 2.1
for short and long H3, respectively).

It is sometimes difficult for epitope scanning (Jemmerson, 1987)
to recognize a conformational epitope since tertiary interactions
within the protein stabilize the peptide conformation; these inter-
actions are absent in the lone peptide. So segmented proteins have
unsatisfied backbone hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, and antibod-
ies that recognize peptides may have to make backbone contacts to
stabilize the peptide conformation. Some antibodies may bind a lone
epitope peptide in a different conformation than the binding to the
epitope in the parent-protein context.

3.2 Backbone—backbone hydrogen bonds are common
in protease—inhibitor complexes, but not in the other
enzyme—inhibitor/substrate complexes

Unlike the other interfaces, the most frequent hydrogen bonding
pattern in enzyme complexes was the backbone—backbone pair
(Fig. 1D). When dividing the enzymes into proteases and other
types, the dominant hydrogen bonds in the protease-inhibitor com-
plexes were backbone—backbone hydrogen bonds whereas those in
the other types of enzymes came from the side-chain—side-chain
pairs, as seen in other interfaces. This observation is probably a

reﬂection of the difference in the biological roles: proteases cleave
peptide backbones of substrates, whereas other enzymes typically
recognize the other types of bonds, such as glycosidic or phospho-
diester ones.

In a previous work (Jackson, 1999), Jackson computed interaction
energies comprising van der Waals and electrostatic terms in a mo-
lecular mechanics formulation, showing that, in the 12 protease—in-
hibitor complexes studied, the energies from backbone—backbone
interactions account for the highest fraction (41%) of the total ener-
gies. However, although hydrogen bonds could be considered as elec-
trostatic interactions in general, in his calculations, the electrostatic
component of the protease—inhibitor interactions only account for
24% of the total energies. Perhaps the molecular mechanics formula-
tion could not fully describe hydrogen bonds because of the lack of
directionality in the functional form. Indeed, an orientation-depend-
ent hydrogen bonding potential in Rosetta discriminated native inter-
faces better than molecular mechanics calculations (Kortemme et al.,
2003), particularly due to hydrogen bond specificity.

The dominant contribution of backbone—backbone hydrogen
bonds is reminiscent of formation of secondary structure within pro-
tein structures (Pauling and Corey, 1951). Supplementary Figure S5
shows the examples of these hydrogen bonds. In these cases, the
backbones of enzymes and inhibitors become closer upon binding.
Thus, we next analyzed the shape complementarity of the interfaces.

3.3 Shape complementarity of antibody-protein antigen
complexes is close to those of generic proteins

Figure 2 shows the shape complementarity by the SC measure of eight
types of protein—protein interfaces. Contrary to previous findings
(Lawrence and Colman, 1993), these data indicate that the shape
complementarity of antibody—protein interfaces is comparable to
those of the enzyme complex, obligate, hetero- and homodimer inter-
faces while the ‘other’ interfaces show less complementarity
(Wilcoxon rank-sum test, P<0.01). It has been proposed that
the antibody—antigen complex interface shape depends on antigen

Fig. 2. Shape complementarity (Sc) of protein—protein interfaces. Higher val-
ues mean better complementarity. The result of antibody-peptide interfaces
was not shown because 80 measure can suffer from the edge effect of small
interfaces. For box-and-whiskers plots, medians are shown by the thick line,
boxes show the range from the first (01) to third (03) quartile, whiskers ex-
tend to the most extreme data point within 1.5 times the interquartile range of
the O1 and 03, and points show additional outliers

types: groove-like binding is common in antibody—peptide inter-
actions whereas antibody—protein interfaces tend to be more ﬂat (Lee
et al., 2006; MacCallum et al., 1996). Although antibody—peptide
interfaces do exhibit the highest shape complementarity (0.75 i 0.06,
P < 0.01), this observation may arise from the fact that SC can be af-
fected by edge effects. When SC is computed, grid points of molecular
surface are defined and a local geometric quantity is extracted from
them. SC is the median value of the local geometric quantity after
removing grid points on the edge of the interface. Many more edge
points could be removed in small interfaces or the elongated shape of
peptide interfaces than in larger protein interfaces (Janin et al., 2008),
which may lead to the higher SC values of peptide-mediated interfaces.
Shape complementarity of VL—VH domain interface are higher than
the other interfaces (other than antibody—peptide ones) (P< 0.01),
possibly due to the obligate nature of the interfaces.

Protease—inhibitor complexes have higher shape complementar-
ity than the other enzyme—inhibitor/substrate complexes (P < 0.01),
probably due to the larger number of backbone—backbone hydrogen
bonds in the interfaces.

SC values can suffer poor quality of crystal structures (Cohen
et al., 2005). Hence, we repeated the same calculation for 3487
high-resolution crystal structures (Resolutiong2.0 A), confirming
that the shape complementarity of antibody—protein antigen com-
plexes is close to the general interfaces (Supplementary Figure S6).

Shape complementarity of protein interfaces could be defined in
various ways (Bahadur et al., 2004). Therefore, we did a second
computation based on the gap volume index (Laskowski, 1995) as
another metric of shape complementarity (Supplementary Figure
S7). Gap volume index also suggested that shape complementarity
of antibody—protein interfaces is close to enzyme and ‘other’ inter-
faces while these interfaces are less complementary than obligate
complexes (P < 0.01). The lower complementarities of the antibody,
enzyme and ‘other’ complexes would be explained by the observa-
tions that these interfaces are more polar than the obligate ones
(Supplementary Figure S3), and polar interfaces often accommodate
water molecules to fill the gap regions (Ahmad et al., 2011; Cohen
et al., 2005; Lo Conte et al., 1999; Rodier et al., 2005). These gaps
or cavities could be filled in by water molecules. By definition, SC
values exploit the median of local geometric quantities based on nor-
mal products in interfaces to quantify the relative shape of the sur-
faces with each other. On the other hand, the gap volume index
measures the volumes of the cavities in interfaces and normalizes
them by the buried surface areas. Hence, SC values and gap volume
index provide different information on the complementarity of pro-
tein—protein interfaces, and both methods may help characterize
interfaces in protein docking and design.

4 Discussion and conclusions

What has been already known about protein—protein interfaces in
general was that obligate interfaces are more hydrophobic, have bet-
ter shape complementarity, and evolve slower than transient ones
(Keskin et al., 2008; Mintseris and Weng, 2005 ). Amino acid com-
positions of interfaces are also well studied; generally, compared
with the other surfaces on proteins, protein—protein interfaces are
enriched in non-polar and aromatic residues whereas charged resi-
dues tend to be depleted (De et al., 2005; Janin et al., 2008). Arg
residues are a notable exception in that it is one of the common hot
spot residues in interfaces, as well as Trp and Tyr residues (Moreira
et al., 2007). Based on 1150 two domain proteins, 583 homodimers
and 94 heterodimers, residue-level local network patterns were also

proposed in protein—protein interfaces (Luo et al., 2013).
Furthermore, by exploiting all the 57 944 PDB entries available at
that time (June 2009), 20 034 atomic-resolution motifs (i.e. 3D or-
ganization of atoms) were identified in protein—protein interfaces
(Kinjo and Nakamura, 2010). In the past, few studies investigated
the hydrogen bonds in interfaces beyond the average numbers and
the individual geometries, such as angles and distances (Lo Conte
et al., 1999; McDonald and Thornton 1994; Xu et al., 1997). In the
case of antibodies specifically, there are some studies about hydro-
gen bonds in antibody—antigen (protein) interfaces (Dalkas et al.,
2014; Peng et al., 2014; Ramaraj et al., 2012), but few discussed the
insights into evolution (i.e. somatic maturations) and peptide im-
munizations, nor analyzed VL—VH domain interface, as we have
done in this study. The results in this report have implications for
antibody modeling and protein—protein docking problems. Since
hydrogen bonds via backbones can be preserved after mutations,
asymmetry of hydrogen bonding patterns in VL—VH interfaces sug-
gests that mutations in VH domain might be more tolerated than
those in VL domain in engineering better antibodies. Hydrogen
bond density of VL—VH interfaces is almost half of those of the other
interfaces, highlighting the hydrophobic, promiscuous nature of the
domain associations. Although there seems to be no obvious correl-
ations between the number of hydrogen bonds and the geometric de-
scriptors of VL—VH orientations (Supplementary Figure S8) (Dunbar
et al., 2013), constraining the conserved L38:Gln—H39zGln hydro-
gen bonds during the domain orientation sampling would be a pos-
sible approach to better capture correct VL—VH orientations.
Packing VL side chains could be critical in CDR-H3 modeling and
VL—VH positioning. Finally, epitope scanning by fragmentation of
antigens may lead to unusual recognition of peptides and/or binding
that differs from the binding of the full antigen.

Backbone—backbone hydrogen bonds are common in the prote-
ase—inhibitor complexes. An important problem in protein—protein
docking is in global sampling i.e., identification of potential-binding
sites of protein surfaces. An application of our observations may be
to use backbone complementarity based on hydrogen bonds and,
possibly, to use information of dehydration of backbone atoms
(Fernandez and Scheraga, 2003) to identify binding sites in prote-
ase—inhibitor systems.

In contrast to the previous discussion, the shape complementar-
ity of antibody—protein interfaces seems to be similar to those of
other interfaces. Through somatic maturation, antibodies can evolve
over short time scales, leading to antibodies having higher affinity
and stability, even though the evolution toward binding is only on
one side of the interface, it is sufficient to reach high shape comple-
mentarity typical of other protein—protein interface types (Li et al.,
2003). Still, higher gap volume index being considered, water mol-
ecules could also play a role to complete the better fit of interfaces.
Although modulating hydrogen bonds in computational design is
still challenging, mimicking the maturation process, designing pro-
teins with higher shape complementarity by modulating backbone—
backbone hydrogen bonds, as observed in the protease—inhibitor
complexes, is a promising approach.

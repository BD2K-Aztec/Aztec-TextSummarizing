ABSTRACT

Summary: Pipit is a gene-centric interactive visualization tool de-
signed to study structural genomic variations. Through focusing on
individual genes as the functional unit, researchers are able to study
and generate hypotheses on the biological impact of different struc-
tural variations, for instance, the deletion of dosage-sensitive genes or
the formation of fusion genes. Pipit is a cross-platform Java applica-
tion that visualizes structural variation data from Genome Variation
Format files.

Availability: Executables, source code, sample data, documentation
and screencast are available at https://bitbucket.org/biovizleuven/

1 INTRODUCTION

Structural variation is deﬁned as a change of genomic DNA
greater than 1kb in size and can be either balanced or unba-
lanced (Stankiewicz and Lupski, 2010). A structural variation
may be benign, it may inﬂuence phenotypes, it may predispose
to or cause diseases, and it may be transmitted to next gener-
ations. In addition, it may also result in the formation of new
transcripts through gene fusion or exon skipping when break-
points disrupt gene structures (F euk et al., 2006). Understanding
the structural change in the genome, as well as its functional
impact, is critical for studying phenotypic variations and genetic
diseases in human and model organisms (Korbel et al., 2007).
When structural variations are studied, the structure of these
variants are usually Visualized by encoding breakpoints on a
linear or circular layout (Herbig et al., 2012; Krzywinski et al.,
2009). Other Visual encodings such as dot plot and graph repre-
sentations show the changes in the reference genome introduced
by the structural rearrangement (Nielsen and Wong, 2012).
These Visual encodings pose two challenges in analysis of struc-
tural variation data. First, they focus on size and position, rather
than the consequence of structural rearrangement. Second, they
introduce an implicit correlation between size and effect, whereas
small structural variations may have more severe effects than

some large variations. Therefore, an effective Visual encoding
of structural and copy-number variations based on functional
units is essential to gain insights into impact on human health
and disease.

We introduce an exploratory Visualization tool, named Pipit,
which uses a novel gene-centric Visual encoding to examine how
gene structures individually are affected by structural variants.
Pipit takes a Genome Variation Format ﬁle as input and encodes
an affected gene structure as a disk, showing how it is modiﬁed
and oriented towards other genes. By means of this data abstrac-
tion, the focus of the structural variants is shifted from the gen-
omic distance to the biologically relevant feature, i.e. the
underlying genes. This encoding enables swift Visual inspection
of genes that are affected by structural variants, which may be
examined further if deemed interesting. Not constrained or
biased by variation sizes, Pipit permits in-depth analysis and
exploration of structural variation data.

2 FEATURES

Pipit is an interactive Visualization tool developed in Processing,
an open source programming language and integrated develop-
ment environment based on Java. The executables are available
for Linux, Mac OS X and Windows. The input ﬁle is in Genome
Variation Format because it is a well-standardized format for
genomic structural variation data, extended from the Generic
Feature Format (Reese et al., 2010), and both the European
Bioinformatics Institute and the National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) curate, archive and make
data publicly available in this format Via DGVa (http://www.
ebi.ac.uk/dgva) and dear (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
dbvar), respectively (Lappalainen et al., 2013).

Pipit also uses the gene track, cytoband and gene ontology
(GO) information obtained from the UCSC table browser data-
base (Karolchik et al., 2004). The current version supports the
data from human (NCBI build 36 and 37) and mouse (NCBI
build 37/mm9 and GRCm build 38 /mm10), but the user can load
the data for other model organisms. In addition, the user can
load a comma-separated values ﬁle containing the Ensembl gene
ID and ordinal or categorical information, such as haploinsufﬁ-
ciency scores (Huang et al., 2010) and known oncogenes (Fig. 1
and Supplementary Material).

Each affected gene is represented as a disk and ﬁlled according
to which part of its structure is inﬂuenced by a structural vari-
ation (Fig. 1; see Supplementary Material). Structural variant

Fig. 1. Pipit visualizing the structural variation data of the mouse genome (estd118). (A) The deletion of the Met gene on chromosome 6 is selected.
03) The associated genomic information of the region is shown on the bottom panel. (C) Categories of the known oncogenes for the mouse are listed,
and the Oncogenes category is selected. GO terms associated with affected genes are listed below on the right panel

types are based on the data ﬁle and colour coded as shown on
the right panel. Unaffected genes are compressed into a line
connecting affected genes. The default promoter length upstream
of the gene sequence can be set when loading the data.

There are four layouts to explore the structural variation data.
The default view is the collapsed ordered gene view (Fig. 1). In this
view, a coloured disk may represent an affected gene or consecu-
tively ordered genes that are affected by the same type of struc-
tural variation. In the expanded view, all affected genes are
individually visualized. The chromosome position view shows
affected variants mapped to their genomic positions. Lastly,
the unit plot view visualizes affected genes by their type of struc-
tural variant event, such as deletion, tandem-duplication and so
forth (see Supplementary Material).

When a disk unit is selected (Fig. 1A), the underlying genes
and structural variation events are shown on the bottom panel,
along with the chromosome with cytobands and transcripts with
their exonic regions coloured in dark grey (Fig. 1B). The gene
name shown in this panel links to the Ensembl browser and
displays the genomic region. In the right panel (Fig. 1C), the
coloured square boxes for each structural variant types serve as
radio buttons to hide or show a selected type of variant. The text
ﬁeld below searches for a speciﬁc gene amongst affected genes.
GO terms associated with affected genes are listed, and con-
versely selecting a GO term highlights associated genes in the
main view. A screenshot can be saved as a PDF by pressing
the ‘p’ on the keyboard.

3 DISCUSSION

Pipit introduces a novel visualization paradigm and user inter-
action method to examine structural variants based on the
affected gene region. It facilitates the study of structural variants
from a gene-centric perspective to investigate various events, for
instance, how known dosage-sensitive genes are affected or
whether gene fusions are formed. Future work includes extend-
ing the functional unit to encompass important regulatory

elements as elaborated in the ENCODE project (Birney et al.,
2007). Additionally, functions to compare multiple samples from
various data formats, such as Variant Call Format (Danecek
et al., 2011), and options to incorporate other conventional
linear or circular representations are essential for more compre-
hensive study of structural variants.

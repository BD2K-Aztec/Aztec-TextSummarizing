Abstract

Motivation: There is a growing need in bioinformatics for easy—to—use software implementations of
algorithms that are usable across platforms. At the same time, reproducibility of computational
results is critical and often a challenge due to source code changes over time and dependencies.
Results: The approach introduced in this paper addresses both of these needs with AlgoRun, a
dedicated packaging system for implemented algorithms, using Docker technology. Implemented
algorithms, packaged with AlgoRun, can be executed through a user—friendly interface directly
from a web browser or via a standardized RESTful web API to allow easy integration into more
complex workflows. The packaged algorithm includes the entire software execution environment,
thereby eliminating the common problem of software dependencies and the irreproducibility of
computations over time. AlgoRun—packaged algorithms can be published on http://algorun.org, a
centralized searchable directory to find existing AlgoRun—packaged algorithms.

Availability and implementation: AlgoRun is available at http://algorun.org and the source code
under GPL license is available at https://github.com/algorun

1 Introduction

Using software tools developed by the bioinformatics community
presents several challenges, beginning with the installation of the
software itself and its dependencies. Reproduction of computational
results by others faces the challenge of frequent modifications in ei-
ther the implementation of the algorithm itself or in one of its
dependencies, or both (Boettiger, 2015 ; Peng, 2011). Although code
sharing is possible through online code repositories like GitHub, it is
hard to share the entire computational environment that a given
software implementation of an algorithm depends on. Boettiger
(2015 ) investigated the two main approaches to overcome these
issues. The first approach is workﬂow software (Altintas et 61].,
2004; Hull et 61]., 2006). Although it provides technical solutions to
the challenges of dissemination, it is marked by relatively low total

adoption rates (Gil et 61]., 2007). The second approach is the use of
virtual machines (VMs) running on cloud services (Dudley and
Butte, 2010; Howe, 2012). While this approach addresses the prob—
lem by capturing the entire software environment, it is sometimes
perceived as being a ‘black box’ not well suited to ensuring reprodu—
cibility. Also, researchers cannot easily build on virtual machines in
a consistent and scalable way (Boettiger, 2015). A more recent ap—
proach to solve this problem is to use software containers, particu—
larly Docker, an open source technology used to package
applications and their dependencies into a standardized software
container. Boettiger (2015) showed that using Docker will overcome
the problems related to dependency, documentation inaccuracy and
code changes. In this paper, we present an enhancement to the soft—
ware container approach by introducing AlgoRun. AlgoRun is a

Docker—based software container template designed to provide trad—
itional command-line algorithms with standard web capabilities: a
web user interface and a RESTful web API to allow easy integration
of algorithms into complex workflows. In the following sections, we
introduce AlgoRun and we show how it can be used to package
Bowtie (Langmead et 61]., 2009), a well—known bioinformatics soft—
ware. For better readability, the term ‘AlgoRun container’ will now
be used to refer to a ‘Docker—based software container created with
the AlgoRun template’.

2 Methods

AlgoRun is built on top of Docker, an open source technology used
to package applications and their dependencies into a standardized
and environment—agnostic software container. AlgoRun allows the
efficient creation of software containers dedicated to making algo—
rithms re—usable and making computational results reproducible by
the scientific community. AlgoRun requires no or minimal source
code changes, and is compatible with all programming languages.
To aid the dissemination of implemented algorithms, AlgoRun con-
tainers can be published on http://algorun.org. Building an AlgoRun
container requires installing Docker, providing information about
the algorithm and its dependencies in the package template, and, fi—
nally, building the AlgoRun container. Supplementary File 1 pro-
vides detailed instructions.

AlgoRun Features

AlgoRun containers provide implemented algorithms with:

Remote execution ability: AlgoRun enables users to run implemented
algorithms via the web API or via the web user interface (Fig. 1).
Ease-of-use: AlgoRun containers automatically generate a graphical
web interface that requires minimal technical expertise.

Portability and compatibility: AlgoRun inherits Docker’s main bene-
fits by removing issues related to code changes, dependencies and
backward compatibility over time.

Programmability and reusability: AlgoRun favors implemented al—
gorithms’ reusability to create more complex workflows by provid—
ing a standard RESTful web API.

3 Application examples

As examples of how AlgoRun makes packaging, running and pub-
lishing algorithms a straightforward process, Supplementary File 2
shows the AlgoRun container creation process for the following im-
plemented algorithms: Bowtie (Langmead et 61]., 2009), REACT
(Vera—Licona, 2014) and KS (Kavvadias and Stavropoulos, 2005).
To run these today, users need to download and install the necessary
packages, their dependencies and run them from the command line.
With AlgoRun however, users simply need to navigate to the dedi—
cated AlgoRun web URL to start running computations, with no in-
stallation required. Instructions are provided for the option to run
the container on the user’s local machine.

4 Conclusions

AlgoRun containers enable authors of algorithms to build a fully re—
usable software package for their work. The software package can
be used immediately over the web or deployed in any computer en—
vironment, providing a friction—less access to computational capabil—
ities. Taking the well—known Bowtie open—source software as an
example, along with REACT and KS algorithms, we have demon—
strated that the creation of such a software package requires min-
imal effort.

AlgoRun, with its robust web architecture, paves the way for
building pipelines and networks of parallel and sequential computa—
tions. AlgoRun containers can be used in a distributed environment,
which will greatly improve collaboration. Thus, AlgoRun has the
potential to become the core architecture for computational soft—
ware tools in the future.

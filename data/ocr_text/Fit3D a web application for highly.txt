Abstract

Summary: The clarification of linkage between protein structure and function is still a demanding
process and can be supported by comparison of spatial residue patterns, so—called structural
motifs. However, versatile up—to—date resources to search for local structure similarities are rare.
We present Fit3D, an easily accessible web application for highly accurate screening of structural
motifs in 3D protein data.

Availability and implementation: The web application is accessible at https://biosciences.hs—mittweida.

1 Background

The identification and thorough comprehension of spatial residue pat—
terns—so—called structural motifs—can undoubtedly help to bridge the
gap between protein structure and function. These patterns are often
highly conserved and not necessarily dependent on primary structure
due to occasionally large sequence insertions between motif residues.
The close proximity of structural motif residues in tertiary structure
forms essential ‘building blocks’ for synergy between protein structure
and function (Hedstrom, 2002; Koutsotoli et 61]., 2012).

Structural motifs are involved in the majority of biochemical
processes, for example in catalytic activity of enzymes (Hedstrom,
2002). Additionally, they were observed to aid structure stabiliza—
tion (Koutsotoli et 61]., 2012). Even highly divergent protein superfa—
milies such as the enolase superfamily can be represented adequately
by structural motif templates (Meng et 61]., 2004).

Although protein structure is resilient to mutation, small struc—
tural changes can have a drastic impact on protein function (Samish
et 61]., 2015). Such small alterations are not yet fully understood and
therefore the detailed investigation of spatial residue patterns is
beneficial to understand complex implications.

Nowadays the contemporary and rapid increase of structure—
related data results in the release of protein structures prior to cor—
rect functional annotation. Consequently, computational solutions
for large—scale screening and analysis of diverse structural motifs are
experiencing a high demand and are of significant interest for anno—
tation of protein function. The Structure Function Linkage Database
(Akiva et 61]., 2013) or the Catalytic Site Atlas (Furnham et 61].,
2014) are suitable starting points to deduce function representing
spatial residue patterns. Furthermore, computational protein design
approaches are often simplifying atomic structure, which can result

in misplaced sidechain orientations (Samish et al., 2015). Here, the
in silico comparison of sidechain placements with observations in
experimentally determined structures can be helpful to appraise or
improve design results.

The detection of local similarities in protein structures can be
seen as a pattern matching problem in 3D space and simultaneous
consideration of geometrical constraints—such as maximum
allowed least root—mean—square deviation (LRMSD) to the query
motif—as well as residue composition of match candidates. To date
various algorithmic approaches were presented (for a brief overview
see Supplementary Table 81), but most of them are either not access—
ible, difficult in usage or parametrization, deprecated, or limited in
functionality. More specifically, existing software or web services
lack at least one of the following primary features:

° convenient deﬁnition of structural motifs,

° consideration of position—speciﬁc exchanges (PSEs) of residues
(Kaiser et al., 2015),

° representation of structural motifs by Ca‘, backbone— or side—
chain-only atoms,

° detection of inter—molecular matches located in multiple protein
chains,

° interactive visualization of the results or

° (if available) annotation of hits with EC numbers and Pfam ac—
cession codes to assess function or family afﬁliation.

Recently we developed an algorithm for motif screening and utilized
it to demonstrate that multi—atom representation of motifs, based
on a definable selection, is essential for proper screening results (Kaiser
et al., 2015). The presented method significantly outperforms existing
approaches when identifying enolase superfamily members in terms of
sensitivity and specificity. Furthermore, algorithmic capabilities are ex—
tended by allowing matching of non—identical residues to mimic residue
substitutions, which might have occurred during protein evolution or
were directly induced by mutagenesis or protein design approaches.

Consequently, the presented method tackles these limitations
and aims at the combination and extension of advantages of existing
methods to enable powerful analyses of structural motifs.

2 Functionality

Based on the previously published matching algorithm (Kaiser et al.,
2015) we designed an intuitive web application called Fit3D.

 

Furthermore, we provide a platform—independent command line ver—
sion that allows more sophisticated calculations and extended fea—
tures for easy integration into existing processing pipelines. For an
auxiliary overview of the basic concept please refer to Figure 1.

Fit3D offers an ‘all-in—one’ solution, covering the whole process
of a structural motif screening pipeline from query motif definition
(Fig. 1A) and screening (Fig. 1B), up to retrieval and visualization
of the results (Fig. 1C). Compared to previous presented work,
our parameter—independent web application offers several improve—
ments: the definition of PSEs, different atom representations, the de—
tection of intra— and inter—molecular motif occurrences, and
interactive visualization of the results within the web browser (see
Fig. 1). Besides matching, Fit3D provides a statistical assessment of
the results by a P—value estimation (Fofanov et al., 2008; Stark et al.,
2003).

The mapping of meta information contributes to fast selection of
relevant matches. Consequently, structures where matches occurred
are annotated with EC number or Pfam accession codes (if available)
and cross—referenced to the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (Berman et al.,
2000).

For proper visualization of the results the Protein Viewer
(Biasini, 2014) was implemented. Different visualization types of
matches can be picked: alignment of all matches against the query
motif, alignment of a single match against the query motif, or visual—
ization of a single match in the structure of origin.

All results are provided as individual files or an archive file, bun—
dling all matches in a column—separated format (CSV) and their cor—
responding structures in PDB format. The distribution of LRMSD
values of all matches, which can be an important signature pattern
depending on characteristics of the query motif, is computed and
available for download.

Beside algorithmic efficiency the usability was a primary aspect
during development. The web application is optimized for highly ac-
curate screening of small (usually 3 five residues) and compact
(close spatial proximity) structural motifs and a filter is applied to
estimate the complexity of the query motif. For a three residue
motif the whole process takes only minutes, but the integrated email
notification allows the user to recall the results within 72 hours after
submission.

Summarizing the above, Fit3D can be valuable for versatile ap—
plications, offers an ample set of features and combines advantages
of existing methods. The usability and intuitive usage stands out and
facilitates quick acquisition of results.

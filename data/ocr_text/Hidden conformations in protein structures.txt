ABSTRACT

Motivation: Prediction of interactions between protein residues
(contact map prediction) can facilitate various aspects of 3D structure
modeling. However, the accuracy of ab initio contact prediction
is still limited. As structural genomics initiatives move ahead,
solved structures of homologous proteins can be used as multiple
templates to improve contact prediction of the major conformation
of an unsolved target protein. Furthermore, multiple templates
may provide a wider view of the protein’s conformational space.
However, successful usage of multiple structural templates is not
straightforward, due to their variable relevance to the target protein,
and because of data redundancy issues.

Results: We present here an algorithm that addresses these two
limitations in the use of multiple structure templates. First, the
algorithm unites contact maps extracted from templates sharing high
sequence similarity with each other in a fashion that acknowledges
the possibility of multiple conformations. Next, it weights the resulting
united maps in inverse proportion to their evolutionary distance
from the target protein. Testing this algorithm against CASP8
targets resulted in high precision contact maps. Remarkably, based
solely on structural data of remote homologues, our algorithm
identified residue—residue interactions that account for all the known
conformations of calmodulin, a multifaceted protein. Therefore,
employing multiple templates, which improves prediction of contact
maps, can also be used to reveal novel conformations. As multiple
templates will soon be available for most proteins, our scheme
suggests an effective procedure for their optimal consideration.

1 INTRODUCTION

Protein structure representations vary in their level of detail from
precise atomic resolution models to the coarser contact maps that
provide information at the level of the interactions between amino
acid residues. Despite its low resolution, contact map representation

holds advantages for speciﬁc applications (Holm and Sander, 1993;
Kliger, 2010; Kliger et al., 2009; Zaki, 2003). For example,
in multiple conformation analysis, whereas structural alignment
of conformations requires structural superimpositions, contact
map representation (which is translation and rotation invariant)
allows straightforward comparison of multiple conformations.
These advantages motivate the development of algorithms aimed
at predicting intramolecular residue—residue interactions. These
algorithms often do not use any explicit structural information,
but instead rely on statistical methods that quantify the correlation
between columns in a multiple sequence alignment (MSA), also
known as correlated mutation analysis (Ashkenazy and Kliger, 2010;
Dekker et al., 2004; Dunn et al., 2008; Dutheil et al., 2005; Eyal
et al., 2007; Fleishman et al., 2004; Gobel et al., 1994; Kass
and Horovitz, 2002; Martin et al., 2005; Olmea and Valencia,
1997). Improved performance has been achieved by various machine
learning methods that incorporate correlated mutation measures and
other features (Cheng and Baldi, 2005, 2007; Fariselli et al., 2001;
Miller and Eisenberg, 2008; Punta and Rost, 2005; Shackelford and
Karplus, 2007; Tegge et al., 2009). Currently, the best performing
‘ab initio’ contact predictor is NNCon (Tegge et al., 2009) as
determined by the analysis performed during the Critical Assessment
of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP8) (Ezkurdia
et al., 2009). However, despite the considerable progress, the
performance of ab initio contact map prediction methods is still
insufﬁcient for most potential applications (Grana et al., 2005;
Horner et al., 2008; Izarzugaza et al., 2007).

Fortunately, structural information extracted from templates can
facilitate contact prediction. Some template—based predictors use
various approaches to construct 3D models of the target, then extract
a contact map from each model, and ﬁnally produce the consensus
contact map (Gao et al., 2009; Stehr and Lappe, 2008). The rationale
behind this approach is that a consensus of many inaccurate models
will have a much higher reliability than predictions that are based
on any single model. Other template—based predictors implement
machine learning techniques to incorporate contact map information
extracted from several templates (Walsh et al., 2009; Wu and Zhang,
2008a, 0).

Whereas template—based structure prediction may allow more
accurate models, it has an intrinsic drawback: the template captures
the protein in a single conformation. However, the existence of
an ensemble of conformations is often important for the function,
interactability and evolvability of proteins (B oehr et al., 2006; Boehr
and Wright, 2008; Lange et al., 2008; Tokuriki and Tawﬁk, 2009).
In this study, we suggest that taking into account multiple templates
offers two opportunities: (i) the ability to improve contact map

prediction and (ii) the capacity to capture more than a single snapshot
of the protein’s conformational space. The latter is very appealing
when different experimentally derived 3D structures of identical,
or highly similar, sequences are available. Such data, which are
often considered as ‘redundant’ when sequence—based redundancy
removal procedures are used, may contain information about
alternate conformations (Dan et al., 2010; Kosloff and Kolodny,
2008; Zhang et al., 2007). However, taking into account multiple
templates raises the challenge of avoiding bias toward sequences
that are overrepresented in the databases. To address this challenge,
here we tested whether contact prediction that is based on multiple
templates can be further improved by considering appropriate
weighting of multiple templates. Our results demonstrate that an
algorithm that uses multiple templates performs better than any
previous contact prediction algorithm. This holds true even when
the best template (which can, in reality, be chosen only in retrospect)
available in the database is chosen as a single template. Furthermore,
this study demonstrates that by using multiple templates for the
target protein, we can capture a broader view of the protein
conformational space thereby identifying contacts derived from the
various conformations that the protein can adopt.

2 METHODS

Structural data: 3D structures were obtained from PDB (Berman et al.,
2000).

Template identiﬁcation: the templates were collected as described by
Godzik and colleagues (Rychlewski et al., 2000) with these modiﬁcations—
templates were considered if (i) they had a BLAST e—value < 10—5; (ii) their
release date predate the CASP8 start date (in order to fairly compare our
performance to that of CASP8 predictors); (iii) they shared < 90% identity
with the target (to avoid homologs that are too similar to the target); (iv) the
alignment between the target and template covered at least 50% of the target
length and at least 50% of the template length [as was found to be the optimal
criteria for homologous selection in correlated mutation analysis (Ashkenazy
et al., 2009)]; (V) they were determined by X—ray crystallography.

Building MSA: MSA of the target and templates sequences were built with
MAFFT (v6.240) (Katoh and Toh, 2008) using the L—INS—I procedure.

Contact maps: were extracted using contacts deﬁned by the CSU
algorithm (Sobolev et al., 1999), which is based on a detailed analysis of
interatomic contacts and interface complementarity.

Evolutionary distance: the distances between the templates and the
target protein were extracted from an evolutionary tree constructed by the
SEMPHY algorithm (Ninio et al., 2007). The distance matrix represented by
the phylogenetic tree was extracted using the Bio::TreeIO module, which is
part of the BioPerl (Stajich et al., 2002) package.

Performance evaluation: the number of interactions is linearly correlated
with the protein length, while the number of possible interactions is quadratic;
this may result in a bias in performance evaluation in favor of short proteins.
To allow a true comparison between proteins with different lengths, it is
common to compare the precision [Precision=TP/(TP+FP)] achieved for
the top—ranked prediction in proportion to the protein length. Thus, in this
study we sorted the predictions according to their scores and evaluated
the precision achieved for the Top L (tharget length) (or Top US, when
indicated) ranked predictions for residue pairs separated by more than six
residues (or 24 residues, when indicated) on the primary sequence. When we
compared two contact prediction methods, the signiﬁcance of the advantage
of one method was based on the difference in the number of per—protein ‘wins’
which was compared to the null hypothesis that each of the two methods have
an equal probability to outperform the other. This difference was standardized
to a Z—score, using the total number of proteins, and the corresponding
P—value was computed based on a standard normal distribution.

Contact map of the best template: evaluation was performed for the 65
target proteins that had at least two templates, and their best template structure
(as determined by CASP8 assessors) was based on a crystal structure (Tress
et al., 2009).

CASP8 predictions: Predictions submitted to the CASP8 experiment were
downloaded from the protein structure prediction center web site.

3 RESULTS

Multiple structural templates are already available in the PDB for
about half of the CASP8 targets (Supplementary Figs S1 and S2).
Below, we demonstrate that incorporating information extracted
from multiple templates substantially boosts correct prediction of
protein contact maps compared with all alternative approaches
(Figs 1 and 2 and Supplementary Figs S5 and S7). Furthermore, we
demonstrate that our algorithm often results in a contact map that
captures an ensemble of conformations that the protein can adopt as
illustrated for calmodulin (Fig. 3).

3.1 Current availability of potential templates for
structure prediction

Historical analysis reveals that as the number of structural domains
that were subject to CASP experiments increases, the fraction of
domains for which reliable templates cannot be identiﬁed [termed
FM (free modeling) since CASP7 and NF (new fold) before
that] or that have only small resemblance to known structures
(termed FM/T BM and FR/NF) sharply decreases (Supplementary
Fig. S2). Furthermore, for 65 out of the 112 CASP8 TBM (template—
based modeling) targets, more than one template was available
(Supplementary Fig. S1). It is noteworthy that many of these
templates share high sequence similarity (Supplementary Fig. S1).
These ﬁndings suggest that using multiple templates for structure
prediction is feasible.

3.2 Multiple conformations and evolutionary
information beneﬁts contact map prediction

Many proteins are dynamic machines, and their intramolecular
interactions may vary between conformations. A comprehensive
survey of PDB structures having identical or similar sequences
can capture part of the conformational space (Dan et al., 2010;
Kosloff and Kolodny, 2008; Zhang et al., 2007). Such a survey uses
information that is habitually discarded in computational biology
to avoid bias toward sequences overrepresented in databases such
as PDB. In this study, we looked for a way to incorporate such
‘redundant’ information for contact prediction while minimizing the
potential bias that might be caused by the unbalanced representation
of these structures in PDB. We suggested that weighting the
templates according to their evolutionary distances from the target
protein should be adequate for this purpose.

The evolutionary distances between each template and the target
protein were estimated according to the evolutionary tree that was
constructed by SEMPHY (Ninio et al., 2007) based on the protein
sequences. Then, templates (t) were grouped according to their
evolutionary distances, so all templates with a distance of less
than 0.02 to the group’s common ancestor were grouped together.
Then, for each group (g), a binary contact map (M) was greedily
constructed, where all interactions (between residue i and residue j)

found in at least one of the group members were noted.

Finally, the groups’ contact maps are summed up in a weighted
fashion to construct the predicted contact map. The prediction score
(SW) for each pair of residues is calculated as follow:

G
Vi,j:Llli—jl Z6:Si,j:ZWg'Mig:j
g=1

Where L is the length of the target protein, G is the number
of groups and Wg is the group’s weight. The weight of the
contact map of each group was calculated to be equal to
dT3, where d is the evolutionary distance and the third power
was empirically determined. This method was named ‘Weighted
Multiple Conformations’ (WMC).

Each of the two steps used in WMC, i.e. template weighting and
redundancy consideration, were evaluated separately and found to
improve prediction performance. First, the importance of template
weighting was demonstrated by comparing the performance of
two simple contact map predictors: ‘NR Weighted’ (where each
template weight equals dT3, where d is the evolutionary distance)
and ‘NR Average’ (where each template weight equals 1). These
methods, ‘NR Weighted’ and ‘NR Average’, consider only a single
representative structure out of the templates that share 100%
sequence identity (the structure with the highest resolution and
the lowest R factor was selected as the representative template);
thus, both methods are designated as non—redundant (NR) methods.
The results of this comparison reveal that weighting templates
according to their evolutionary distance (i.e. ‘NR Weighted’)
achieves signiﬁcantly higher prediction performance than using
a simple average (‘NR Average’) (Supplementary Fig. S3). The
second comparison demonstrates that the way used by our ‘WMC’
scheme to incorporate ‘redundant’ information, i.e. taking into
account all, rather than only one, PDB structures per sequence,
does not reduce the performance as could be expected from the
unequivocal representation of proteins in the PDB even when a large
number of templates are used (Supplementary Fig. S4). As will be
demonstrated below, such incorporation of ‘redundant’ information
enables to capture a wider view of the protein conformational space.

3.3 Improvement over ‘best template’

Predictors that use sequence and secondary structure prediction
to determine structural templates often do not identify the most
appropriate (best) template. Of course, the ‘best template’ can
be only determined with hindsight knowledge by using structural
alignment between the experimentally solved structure of the target
protein against the PDB. Thus, at the end of the prediction period,
CASP assessors use LGA (Zemla, 2003) and Mammoth (Ortiz et al.,
2002) to search the PDB for the ‘best template’ for each target (Tress
et al., 2009). Remarkably, most homology modeling prediction
methods have difﬁculties in generating 3D models that are more
accurate than the structure simply projected from the target’s ‘best
template’ (Kopp et al., 2007). This difﬁculty found in 3D homology
modeling prediction occurs also in contact map prediction. Thus,
to demonstrate the strength of our multiple template approach,
we compared our predicted contact maps with those derived from

The contact map projected from the best template [as determined by
CASP8 assessors by structural alignment of the target structure (determined
experimentally) (Ortiz et al., 2002; Zemla, 2003) after the end of CASP8]
is compared to our weighted multiple conformation (WMC) prediction. The
precision achieved when considering the Top L (L: protein length) ranked
predictions is shown. The ﬁgure reveals that the WMC predictor is more
accurate than the contact map projected from the best template.

the ‘best template’ that were determined by CASP8 assessors by
after—the—fact analysis (Tress et al., 2009). The results revealed that
the WMC method performs better than the contact map projected
from the best template (P—value=5.2><10_6; Fig. 1). The same
ﬁnding was obtained when the CASP evaluation procedure was
used—calculating the precision of the top US (L=protein length)
predictions while taking into account only residues which are
separated by > 24 residues on the primary sequence (P—value = 2.3 X
10‘4; Supplementary Fig. S5). Some of the improvement of the
WMC prediction over the ‘best template’ can be explained by the
number of available templates [Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient
(PCC) of 0.236], and by the correlation between the improvement
of WMC and the root—mean—square deviation (RMSD) between the
‘best—template’ and the structure of the target protein (PCC = 0.353).

These results suggest that it is beneﬁcial to consider templates
other than the ‘best’ one even in the hypothetical optimal case where
the ‘best template’ is known in advance. This conclusion is further
supported by looking at the nine targets for which the CASP ‘best
template’ was not considered by our algorithm (open triangles on
Fig. 1). In seven out of these nine cases, the precision of our predictor
was higher than that of the contact map projected directly from the
best template.

3.4 WMC is the best contact map predictor when
templates are available

CASP experiments aim to objectively compare performance of
structure prediction methods on proteins whose structure is not
yet available, and thus to determine the current ‘state—of—the—
art’ method (Moult et al., 2009). In CASP, contact prediction
evaluations are made only for the ‘free modeling’ (FM) targets,
i.e. when all predictors failed to ﬁnd a template for that target.

Fig. 3. Calmodulin multiple conformation contact map. (A) The full multiple conformation contact map as predicted by the WMC method (circles; upper left
segment) is compared with the uniﬁcation of contact maps of calmodulin’s two conformations that appear in MolMovDB (lower right segment): PDB IDs
1CLL and 1CTR (diamonds and ‘X’, respectively). A helix—helix interaction predicted by the WMC method, but not identiﬁed by MolMovDB, is marked by
a rectangle. (B) The same WMC predicted contact map (circles; upper left triangle) is compared with the ‘greedy’ contact map composed of the uniﬁcation of
contact maps of all X—ray structures of calmodulin proteins 100% identical in sequence to human calmodulin (squares; lower right triangle). Note that there
is at least one PDB structure that conﬁrms the helix—helix interaction predicted by the WMC method.

However, our method is relevant only for targets for which a
template can be assigned (TBM targets). Thus, for the purpose
of comparison between our method, and the current ‘state—of—the—
art’ methods we evaluated the predicted contact maps submitted by
CASP8 participants for the TBM targets (Supplementary Fig. S6).
Whereas some of the predictors are based on templates, for
example SVMSEQ/LOMETS (Wu and Zhang, 2007, 2008a, c)
(group RR413), SMEG—CCP (Stehr and Lappe, 2008) (group

RR014) and Pairings (group RR077), others do not directly use
templates, for example: Hamilton—Torda—Huber (group number
RR424), MULTICOM—CMFR (Cheng and Baldi, 2005; Tegge et al.,
2009) (group RR069) MULTICOM—RANK (Cheng and Baldi, 2007 )
(group RR131) and SAM—T06 (Shackelford and Karplus, 2007)
(group number RR477). Notably, the methods used by groups
RR069, RR131 and RR477 were ranked among the best ab initio
methods (i.e. on FM targets), during CASP7 (Izarzugaza et al.,

2007) and CASP8 (Ezkurdia et al., 2009); however, as can be
expected, the groups that were using the information derived from
templates (RR014, RR077, RR413) perform much better than
the others (RR477, RR424, RR131, RR069) on the TBM targets
(Supplementary Fig. S6).

A comparison between the contact maps predicted by the WMC
method and those submitted by the two TBM best groups, RR077
and RR014, reveals that, for most proteins, the WMC method
resulted in signiﬁcantly higher precision (Fig. 2). These results are
statistically signiﬁcant having P—value of 0.0003 when compared
with RR014, and P—value of 0.0008 when compared with RR077.
This conclusion is also supported when evaluating only the top
US (L=protein length) predictions achieved for residues that are
separated by >24 residues on the primary sequence (P—value of
3.47 x10—7 when compared with RR014, and P—value of 0.0006
when our WMC method is compared with RR077 (Supplementary
Fig. S7).

3.5 Multiple conformation prediction—calmodulin as a
test case

Calmodulin is a Ca2+ binding protein that mediates many cellular
processes in response to changes in calcium concentrations.
Calmodulin interacts with many cellular partners and is known to
change conformation accordingly (Akke and Chazin, 2001; Chou
et al., 2001). Here, human calmodulin was used to demonstrate the
ability of the WMC method to predict a contact map that represents
an ensemble of physiologically relevant conformations rather than
a single conformation (Fig. 3).

MolMovDB (Flores et al., 2006; Krebs and Gerstein, 2000)
deﬁnes two representative structures for calmodulin: PDB|1CLL_A,
which represents an open conformation, and PDB|1CTR_A, which
represents a closed one (see lower triangle of Fig. 3A). We extracted
contact maps from each of these structures, and used them to
evaluate the performance of WMC. The WMC prediction was based
on 114 templates that share 21—89% sequence identity with human
calmodulin (we discarded all templates that share more than 90%
sequence identity with human calmodulin). The results reveal that
both the open and closed conformations are predicted by the WMC
method (Fig. 3A). For the top L predictions (L = protein length = 149
residues), WMC achieved a precision of 0.92 and recall of 0.73 for
the closed conformation, and precision of 0.93 with recall of 0.86
when tested against the open conformation.

Note that WMC also suggests another conformation for
calmodulin that involves an interaction between two helices
(encircled by a rectangle in Fig. 3). Interestingly, this helix—helix
interaction, which is absent in PDB|1CLL_A and PDB|1CTR_A
structures, does appear in the 3D structures of calmodulin complexed
with the adenylyl cyclase domain of anthrax edema factor
(PDB|1SK6_D and PDB|1S26_D) (Guo et al., 2004; Shen et al.,
2004) (Fig. 3B; lower right triangle). As mentioned above, the
WMC prediction was based on 114 templates. The prediction of
the helix—helix interaction was supported by 32 of these templates,
which share 33—53% sequence identity with calmodulin. Among
these templates, there are proteins that, like calmodulin, have four
calcium—binding EF hands: chicken, turkey and rabbit Troponin—C
and human Centrin—2. In addition, there are templates that have three
calcium—binding EF hands (myosin regulatory light chain, myosin
light chain 6B, myosin light polypeptide 6 and myosin light chain 1)

and one template that has only two such motifs (myosin essential
light chain).

These ﬁndings demonstrate the ability of WMC to accurately
predict an ensemble of contact maps that represents multiple
conformations.

4 DISCUSSION

In structural biology, the ability to represent a protein as a contact
map is instrumental. For example, contact map representation
is useful for the identiﬁcation of structural motifs (Zaki,
2003) and for quantiﬁcation of structural alignment (Holm and
Sander, 1993). Recently, prediction of intramolecular helix—helix
interactions, which was based on predicted contact maps, enabled
the design of biologically active peptides that hold therapeutic
promise in cancer and inﬂammation (Kliger, 2010; Kliger et al.,
2009). In addition, several groups suggested approaches for
reconstructing 3D models from contact maps (Bau et al., 2006;
Di Lena et al., 2009; Pollastri et al., 2007; Porto et al., 2004;
Sathyapriya et al., 2009; Vassura et al., 2007, 2008a, b; Vendruscolo
and Domany, 2000; Vendruscolo et al., 1997). Other studies use
predicted contact maps as constraints in 3D modeling to enhance
convergence to the best model (Latek and Kolinski, 2008; Michino
and Brooks, 2009), to reﬁne the created models (Misura et al.,
2006) or to eliminate incorrect models after the modeling process is
completed (Miller and Eisenberg, 2008; Paluszewski and Karplus,
2009; Tress and Valencia, 2010).

In the current study, we suggest an approach for combining
structural data from several templates to enhance contact map
prediction of novel proteins. The basic idea is that tools that capture
a wider view of the protein conformational space can provide useful
insights on the contact map level, and serve as a better starting point
for downstream analysis involving contact maps (e. g. 3D modeling).
Indeed, as structural genomics initiatives move ahead (Bonanno
et al., 2005; Burley et al., 2008; Chandonia and Brenner, 2006;
Levitt, 2007; Nair et al., 2009), it has become more likely to ﬁnd at
least one structural template for most proteins (Tress et al., 2009).
Furthermore, as revealed in Supplementary Figure S 1, many proteins
already have at least two potential templates.

The contact map predicted by the WMC algorithm succeeded
in two different tests: WMC exhibits better performance than any
other contact prediction method when evaluated against a single
conformation (as done in CASP8; Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figs S5
and S7), and it also enables the prediction of a united contact map
that considers the multiple conformations that a protein can adopt
(as demonstrated for human calmodulin; Fig. 3).

This study suggests that the performance of template—based
contact prediction methods can be improved signiﬁcantly by using
information extracted from multiple templates. A similar conclusion
was suggested for the case of 3D modeling (Cheng, 2008; Larsson
et al., 2008).

Several methods such as Modeller (Eswar et al., 2006; Sali
and Blundell, 1993) and SwissModel (Bordoli et al., 2009)
utilize structural constraints derived from a template, or multiple
templates, to assist 3D modeling. The dynamic nature of proteins,
as exempliﬁed by the variation of intramolecular contacts observed
in different conformations (Bywater, 2010) pose the challenge of
predicting contacts in each of the different conformations. Our
study suggests a scheme for template—based contact prediction that

captures a wider view of the protein conformational space. The
scheme described here is based on three concepts that—to the best
of our knowledge—were not described previously: (i) weighting
multiple templates according to their evolutionary proximity to the
target protein; (ii) using multiple templates in the prediction process
in a fashion that avoids bias toward ‘redundant’ templates; and (iii)
predicting a contact map that may represent more than one snapshot
of the protein’s conformational space. The ﬁrst two ideas described
above can be further utilized for 3D modeling.

Several major directions can be considered when trying to
improve the framework suggested in this study. One major direction
is the use of structural data for searching and aligning the templates.
Optimal selection of templates, including remote homologs, may be
achieved by algorithms that identify evolutionarily remote templates
sharing similar structures with the target, even in the absence of
sequence similarity (Cheng and Baldi, 2006; Debe et al., 2006;
Ginalski et al., 2003; Jaroszewski et al., 2005; Karplus et al., 1998;
Soding, 2005; Wu and Zhang, 2008b).

WMC uses MAFFT (Katoh and Toh, 2008; Katoh et al., 2002,
2005), which is a method for MSA based only on sequence
information. A more accurate MSA, which may be offered by
methods that incorporate structural information through structural
alignment (Armougom et al., 2006; O’Sullivan et al., 2004),
may further improve performance. In addition, considering the
evolutionary forces for each pair of residues, rather than for the
entire protein, might also dramatically improve performance.

To further beneﬁt from the information about possible multiple
conformations suggested by the WMC method, it is reasonable
to try to separate different conformations. Whereas the ‘united
contact map’ may include some mutually exclusive contacts that
cannot coexist in a single state of the protein—each reﬂects a
different conformation—appropriate mathematical manipulations
can make it useful for various structural analyses, even without
such separation. For example, Fourier transform can enhance the
signal of a speciﬁc conformation and enable reliable predictions
of helix—helix interactions (Kliger et al., 2009). In addition,
using the scores assigned to each of the predicted residue—residue
interactions can give some information about the abundance of
each predicted conformation (at least as reﬂected by the current
databases).

In summary, this study describes an effective approach for
automatic integration of multiple templates in a weighted fashion
for contact map prediction in proteins. The best choice of
weighting functions to utilize multiple templates and to consider
multiple conformations will require further research. Yet, the results
presented in this study clearly demonstrate that using multiple
templates and multiple conformations in a weighted fashion can
dramatically improve protein contact map prediction. Our method
provides the most accurate prediction when multiple templates are
available, and we believe that a similar approach will prove useful
to developers of 3D modeling methods.

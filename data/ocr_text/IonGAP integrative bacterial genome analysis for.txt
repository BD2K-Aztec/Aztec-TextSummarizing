Abstract

Summary: We introduce lonGAP, a publicly available Web platform designed for the analysis of
whole bacterial genomes using Ion Torrent sequence data. Besides assembly, it integrates a variety
of comparative genomics, annotation and bacterial classification routines, based on the widely
used FASTO, BAM and SRA file formats. Benchmarking with different datasets evidenced that
lonGAP is a fast, powerful and simple-to-use bioinformatics tool. By releasing this platform, we
aim to translate low-cost bacterial genome analysis for microbiological prevention and control in
healthcare, agroalimentary and pharmaceutical industry applications.

Availability and implementation: lonGAP is hosted by the lTER’s Teide-HPC supercomputer and is
freely available on the Web for non-commercial use at http://iongap.hpc.iter.es.

1 Introduction

 

The application of Next-Generation DNA Sequencing (NGS) to bac-
terial genomic studies has a great impact in clinical microbiology
diagnosis and epidemiology, as well as in the management of infec-
tious disease outbreaks. Given the abundance of information
produced by the NGS platforms, affordable and fast access to
whole-genome sequence by means of intuitive bioinformatics tools
demanding minimal training is mandatory to translate this technol-
ogy into the clinical settings routine (Frike and Rasko, 2014).

Ion Torrent semiconductor sequencing technology (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Inc.) benefits from high sequencing speed at low
cost, constituting one of the preferred choices in settings demanding

fast turnaround NGS routine analysis (Frey et al., 2014).
Nevertheless, a comprehensive bacterial genomic data analysis de-
mands a number of software packages, which often have cumber-
some installation and use, and lack a graphical interface. Existing
Web platforms such as Orione (Cuccuru et al., 2014) aim to solve
this issue albeit the user still must configure many genome assembly
and analysis options. Alternatives for local execution of analyses,
often requiring expert installation, are also available for genome as-
sembly/annotation (Kislyuk et al., 2010) or variant calling (Qi et al.,
2010). However, they were designed for Illumina and Roche/454
sequencing data. Therefore, there is no specific package providing
an integrated collection of microbial genomic applications, specially

configured for rapid handling of data generated by Ion Torrent
sequencing. For this reason, we have developed IonGAP, a web-
based genome analysis platform to straightforwardly perform both
the assembly process and subsequent comparative analysis, variant
calling, functional annotation and bacterial typing routines in a
seamless, user-friendly way. Therefore, IonGAP offers a first-line so-
lution, making data analysis accessible to non-specialists but com-
patible with downstream advanced applications.

2 Features and Functionalities

The IonGAP processing pipeline is structured in three independent
modules, which can be optionally disabled in order to allow a user-
customized workﬂow. Once the project has finished, the user is noti-
fied by an email from which the compressed results folder can be
downloaded. This includes a summary HTML file for the user to fa-
cilitate browsing the results.

2.1 Genome assembly

The first module is composed by the MIRA assembler (Chevreux
et al., 1999) and the FastQC quality control software (http://www.
bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc). The assembler con-
figuration has been greatly simplified by means of a Web interface,
which allows to start a de novo assembly project simply by submit-
ting a FASTQ, BAM or SRA file. The platform admits compressed
files in .zip or .tar. 1922 format, which can be obtained directly using
the FileExporter plugin of the Torrent Suite. The input file may be
provided by direct upload or, alternatively, through a FTP or cloud
storage URL. At this moment, the pipeline limits the input file size
for this step to approximately 3 million reads or 1 GB (assuming an
uncompressed FASTQ file). The user is allowed to configure a

variety of relevant assembly parameters, in case the default assembly
is not satisfactory, as well as choosing between 11 assembly output
formats. The assembler conducts read pre-processing and filtering.
The assembly stage may also be omitted, as the service allows sup-
plying a file of assembled contigs (in FASTA format) as an input for
the rest of the pipeline, making it practical also for pre-processed
data from other NGS technologies (e.g. Illumina, Roche/454, Pacific
Biosciences).

2.2 Comparative genomics

To execute this module, a unique reference genome sequence
(FASTA format) or its NCBI accession/Sequence identification num-
ber must be provided by the user. Comparative analysis is conducted
by Mauve (Darling et al., 2014), Cortex (Iqbal et al., 2013) and
TRAMS (Reumerman et al., 2013), and involves contig alignment
and reordering based on the reference genome, as well as subsequent
identification of genetic variants, including single nucleotide poly-
morphisms (SNPs), indels, complex polymorphisms, structural vari-
ants and missing regions (Table 1). As part of this, IonGAP outputs
a VCF file for downstream epidemiological and evolutionary ana-
lyses, and a table of SNPs with their functional annotation.
Furthermore, publication-ready reports are generated by different
comparative visualization tools (Table 1 and Supplementary data).
Integrating Mauve in this module offers diverse capabilities and ver-
satility (Edwards et al., 2013), and provides assembly quality met-
rics. Cortex allows discovering and genotyping variants with high
specificity and sensitivity, and provides genotype confidence scores
to derive a high quality variant call set (Iqbal et al., 2012). This
memory-efficient suite works perfectly with haploid genomes (Iqbal
et al., 2013), and has been extensively used for bacterial epidemiolo-
gical analyses.

dVirulence and antibiotic resistance gene alignments 2500 bp are
indicated.

eOnly plasmid alignment lengths 23 000 bp were considered.

2.3 Bacterial classification and annotation

The last module of the platform is mainly dedicated to classification,
gene annotation and identification of mobile elements and patho-
genic factors. The underlying applications and their output results
are summarized in Table 1. The classification based on 16S rRNA
gene sequence might be useful as a checkpoint for sample DNA con-
taminations and/or phenotypic misidentification. Multilocus se-
quence typing (MLST) analysis runs only if the bacterial species is
selected by the user, and might help in a rational determination of
the closest reference genome(s) for further comparisons in case a
MLST scheme is available for the species. Projects running the
whole IonGAP routines employ the reordered contigs (based on a
given reference genome). Nevertheless, the original (unordered) con-
tigs can be used if the Comparative genomics module is disabled.

3 Results and Discussion

3.1 Testing using control datasets

The IonGAP pipeline has been tested using two public Escherichia
coli DH10B genome datasets, generated by the Ion PGM System
with 100 or 400 bp sequencing chemistries (refer to Supplementary
data). As expected, the best assembly results were obtained using
400 bp reads; IonGAP assembled 155 contigs containing a total of
4 589 812 hp, with a N50 length of 118 424 bp. In order to compare
with a reference pipeline, the same datasets were analyzed in the
Orione software by running the ‘Pre-processing’ and ‘Bacterial de
novo assembly’ workflows (Cuccuru et al., 2014). The whole pro-
cess required 2h and 38 min (single-end 400 bp dataset), and al-
though total assembled bases and annotated protein coding genes
were similar to those generated by IonGAP, a N50 length of
57 757 bp was obtained (see Supplementary data).

Besides assembly, IonGAP integrates two modules devoted to
compare, annotate and classify bacterial genomes (Table 1). In this
regard, the results generated by analyzing the mentioned datasets
were consistent with those previously reported for the reference gen-
ome, corresponding to the same strain (Durfee et al., 2008). A closer
inspection of the annotated SNPs list generated by the Comparative
genomics module evidenced the high performance of the variant
calling. For instance, from the total SNP calls retrieved for E.coli
control datasets against the reference, as few as eight of them

supported a nucleotide substitution in the worst case scenario
(400 bp dataset) when a minimally stringent threshold for confi-
dence was imposed (see Table 2 and Supplementary data). Based on
the 16S rRNA gene classification and MLST, sequencing reads were
unequivocally assigned to E.coli ST1060. Sequence annotation re-
vealed up to 4453 protein-coding genes, as well as 19 (>3 kb in
length) and 25 (>500 bp) contig alignments to previously described
plasmid and antibiotic resistance gene sequences, respectively (Table 2).
Furthermore, different virulence proteins coding genes (n = 111) and
pathogenicity islands (n =49) were identified. Noteworthy, the
whole IonGAP process only required up to 1 h and 44 min.

3.2 Validation using case study datasets

To further evaluate its performance, IonGAP was tested with two
different case study datasets derived with 200 bp chemistry corres-
ponding to bacteria with low or high percentage of GC genome con-
tent (see Supplementary data). One of the datasets corresponds to
Staphylococcus aureus (strain M34-B-1_1 1), a Gram-positive patho-
gen with 32.9% GC content that can be found in the upper respira-
tory tract and skin of healthy individuals, representing one of the
most common causes of hospital acquired infections worldwide.
The other dataset corresponds to Mycohacterium ulcerans (strain
Mu_F74), a Gram-positive bacterium with 65.5% GC content that
causes ulcerative skin diseases mainly confined to sub-Saharan
African human populations.

Analysis of the total processing time as well as assembly quality
metrics such as the number of contigs, N5 0 length and total assem-
bly size, evidenced that IonGAP outperformed Orione in both case
study datasets (see Supplementary data). Conversely, although both
datasets are comparable in terms of sequence reads number, average
read length and total sequenced bases, the two datasets performed
remarkably different in IonGAP, resulting in dissimilar assembly
quality metrics and processing time (see Supplementary data).
Ninety-four contigs with a N5 0 length of 218 499 bp were obtained
for S.aureus in as few as 3 h and 32 min. However, a total of 1 352
contigs (N50 length of 7674 bp) were generated for M.ulcerans.
Furthermore, in this latter case, IonGAP required more than 20 h
for completing the assembly process. Such discrepancies might be
attributed to the M.ulcerans genome complexity, which harbours a
megaplasmid as well as several insertion sequence elements (>1 kb)
in high-copy number (Doig et al., 2012).

Some of the most relevant results generated by IonGAP for the
case study datasets are summarized in Table 2. Apart from the total
assembly size, the number of annotated genes in each dataset fits
with values reported for their respective reference genomes. As ex-
pected, the variant calls also revealed differences between the two
datasets. For S.aureus, the comparison with a genetically distant ref-
erence genome (ST398 versus ST8) rendered a total of 19 671 confi-
dent SNP calls, from which 32.6 and 9.3% accounted for
synonymous and non-synonymous SNPs, respectively. In contrast,
only 278 SNP calls were retrieved from the M.ulcerans dataset
(~1z3 synonymous/non-synonymous ratio). Worth mentioning,
IonGAP only required 21 and 27 min to execute the Comparative
genomics and Bacterial classification and annotation modules with
the S.aureus and M.ulcerans datasets, respectively.

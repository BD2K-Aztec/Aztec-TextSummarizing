ABSTRACT

Motivation: Somatic homozygous deletions of chromosomal regions
in cancer, while not necessarily oncogenic, may lead to therapeutic
vulnerabilities specific to cancer cells compared with normal cells. A
recently reported example is the loss of one of the two isoenzymes in
glioblastoma cancer cells such that the use of a specific inhibitor se-
lectively inhibited growth of the cancer cells, which had become fully
dependent on the second isoenzyme. We have now made use of the
unprecedented conjunction of large-scale cancer genomics profiling
of tumor samples in The Cancer Genome Atlas (T CGA) and of tumor-
derived cell lines in the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia, as well as the
availability of integrated pathway information systems, such as
Pathway Commons, to systematically search for a comprehensive
set of such epistatic vulnerabilities.

Results: Based on homozygous deletions affecting metabolic en-
zymes in 16 TCGA cancer studies and 972 cancer cell lines, we iden-
tified 4104 candidate metabolic vulnerabilities present in 1019 tumor
samples and 482 cell lines. Up to 44% of these vulnerabilities can be
targeted with at least one Food and Drug Administration-approved
drug. We suggest focused experiments to test these vulnerabilities
and clinical trials based on personalized genomic profiles of those
that pass preclinical filters. We conclude that genomic profiling will
in the future provide a promising basis for network pharmacology of
epistatic vulnerabilities as a promising therapeutic strategy.
Availability and implementation: A web-based tool for exploring all
vulnerabilities and their details is available at http://cbio.mskcc.

1 INTRODUCTION

Comprehensive cancer proﬁling studies, such as The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA) and other studies by the International
Cancer Genome Consortium, have helped identify many gen-
omic alterations in cancer genomes, including homozygous dele-
tions that often result from genomic instability. Deletions that
confer a proliferative advantage, such as the homozygous

deletion of a tumor-suppressor gene, are selected in cancer cells
Via clonal expansion (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011). Other de-
letions with relatively little effect on the tumor’s proliferative
capabilities can be seen at low frequencies when they are, by
chance, co-selected with other oncogenic events. Both types of
deletions, however, result in the loss of a locus that often con-
tains multiple genes. Such a deletion may not be lethal to a cell if
one or more unaffected partner genes (e.g. an isoenzyme) can
sufﬁciently carry the load of the deleted partner, but the loss of
these passenger genes may create therapeutic vulnerabilities
(Fig. 1). On loss of an initial gene, interference with the function
of its partner gene(s) may result in cell death, a phenomenon
known as synthetic lethality.

Muller et a]. (2012) recently published a case study for syn-
thetic lethality for glioblastoma. Enolase performs an essential
function in cells, catalyzing the conversion of 2-phosphoglycerate
and phosphoenolpyruvate in the glycolytic pathway. At least
three known genes encode enolase isoenzymes: ENOl, ENO2
and ENO3. ENOl has been shown to be homozygously deleted
in certain glioblastomas, probably as a passenger event to the
deletion of ERFFIl, but the tumor cells are able to survive be-
cause of the activity of other enolase encoding genes, in particu-
lar ENO2. Although the loss of ENOl alone may not be lethal,
cancer cells lacking ENOl are selectively vulnerable to the loss of
ENO2 (i.e. synthetic lethality), whereas non-cancer cells with
intact ENOl can tolerate a loss of ENO2.

Most of the cancer genomics research focuses on identifying
driver alterations by frequency or occurrence pattern and exploit-
ing them to treat cancer (Ciriello et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2013;
Mermel et al., 2011; Taylor et al., 2008). However, there is an op-
portunity to exploit synthetic lethalities speciﬁc to particular popu-
lations of cancer cells created by the homozygous loss of genes
responsible for core cellular functions. These are rare patient-spe-
ciﬁc events, and there are no existing tools for identifying these
vulnerabilities for a given patient. A system that can efﬁciently
analyze genomic data from biological samples to identify particu-
lar therapeutic vulnerabilities in cancer cells speciﬁc to those sam-
ples based on potential synthetic lethal partner genes can identify
personalized treatments to inhibit or kill those cancer cells.

Here, we describe a computational method, Statius (named
after the Roman poet, Publius Papinius Statius, who is known
for his famous poems Achilleid and T hebaid), to systematically
predict metabolic vulnerabilities in tumor samples from genomic
proﬁles. We present results obtained from the analysis of 16

Fig. 1. Deletions often result in the loss of a locus (horizontal bars) that
often contains multiple genes. These deletions can sometimes cause loss of
a metabolic gene as a passenger event. This type of alterations are not
lethal to a cell if another gene can sufﬁciently carry the load of the deleted
metabolic gene, but the loss of these passenger genes may create thera-
peutic vulnerabilities in tumors

publicly available cancer studies (Fig. 2). Integrating data, in an
automated manner, from multiple data resources—including seV-
eral pathway databases, drug—target annotation resources and
cancer genomics utilities—we were able to predict sample-speciﬁc
metabolic vulnerabilities, which result from a homozygous dele-
tion event in the corresponding sample, and list drugs that can
help exploit each particular vulnerability. The complete list of the
predicted vulnerabilities can be found at http://cbio.mskcc.org/
cancergenomics/statius.

2 RESULTS
2.1 Data collection

2.1.1 Drug—target relationships As a ﬁrst step in our analysis,
we collected information on available targeted drugs and their
known targets. For this, we gathered drug—target data from mul-
tiple curated data resources including, but not limited to,
DrugBank (Knox et al., 2011) and KEGG Drug (Kanehisa
et al., 2012) using the PiHelper tool (Aksoy et al., 2013). We
further collected information from the National Cancer
Institutes’ Online Cancer Resource (http://cancer.gov) to anno-
tate whether a drug has been approved for cancer therapy. We
were able to extract information for 7817 targeted drugs and
17981 drug—target relationships corresponding to these drugs.
To remove non-speciﬁc drugs, we excluded from our initial ana-
lysis drugs that have more than ﬁve known targets, leaving 7625
drugs and 15 210 drug targets covering 1674 genes.

2.1.2 Gene sets representing isoenzymes We next created a list of
all known metabolic isoenzymes as representatives of synthetic
lethal gene groups. To accomplish this, we used curated human
metabolic pathway information from Pathway Commons in
BioPAX format (Cerami et al., 2011; Demir et al., 2010). We
speciﬁcally collected metabolism pathways provided by
Reactome and HumanCyc databases (Croft et al., 2011;
Romero et al., 2005). Using these data resources, we extracted
ofﬁcial gene symbols from protein entities that catalyze the same
metabolic reaction and considered them as isoenzymes.

In addition to these pathway databases, we also used meta-
bolic enzyme information provided by the KEGG Enzyme

Fig. 2. Overall process of identiﬁcation of therapeutic vulnerabilities.
Statius imports cancer genomics data provided by the cBioPortal
(Cerami et al., 2012; Gao et al., 2013), along with pathway and drug
annotations from a customizable list of external resources. It then pro-
duces a list of sample-speciﬁc vulnerabilities categorized by the cancer
study as output. These potential vulnerabilities can be further tested in

database (Kanehisa et al., 2012). For each enzyme, identiﬁed
by a speciﬁc Enzyme Commission (EC) number, we extracted
the corresponding human gene symbols and grouped them as
isoenzyme gene sets.

Combining data from these three resources, we were able to
extract 1290 unique gene sets. We ﬁltered out 1063 gene sets
consisting of more than ﬁve genes, as our preliminary screen
showed that gene sets with more than ﬁve genes do not increase
the number of predicted vulnerabilities in a considerable manner,
as well as those that consist of only non-targetable genes.

2.1.3 Cancer studies and genomic proﬁles Next, we obtained
genomic proﬁles, minimally somatic copy-number alteration
(CNA) data, from publicly available cancer studies. To obtain
information on multiple studies, we used the web service of the
cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics (Cerami et al., 2012; Gao et al.,
2013). We used categorical CNA information to identify whether
a gene is homozygously deleted for a given sample. Whenever
available, we also collected normalized gene expression levels for
a homozygously deleted gene of interest to see whether the gene
is underexpressed compared with the rest of the samples in the
same cancer study. For this analysis, we used genomic proﬁles
for 5971 samples (4999 tumor samples and 972 cell lines) from 16
different cancer studies that had publicly available CNA data
(Table 1). All but two studies we included in our set had also
the mRNA expression data available.

2.1.4 Additional gene annotations Most of the isoenzymes show
tissue-speciﬁc expression patterns where the expression of an iso-
enzyme is restricted to a single or multiple tissues. We wanted to
use this context-speciﬁc background information in our analysis
and take the tissue associated with a cancer study, when trying to
ﬁnd vulnerabilities. It is also known that some genes are essential
for the Viability of a cell, and therefore, targeting such a gene
causes some level of toxicity to all cells in a non-selective manner,
making these genes unpreferred targets for an ideal therapy.
Therefore, we annotated the genes to recognize tissue-speciﬁc
expression patterns and also essentiality. Using Tissue-speciﬁc
Gene Expression and Regulation (TiGER) database, we ﬁrst

Note: The majority of the cancer studies were from TCGA, and the others were from different individual institutions. We annotated each cancer study with its tissue of origin

extracted tissue-speciﬁc genes. We also, when possible, annotated
the cancer studies with a tissue in accordance with the TiGER
terminology (Liu et al., 2008). These data allowed us to query for
a given sample, associated with a cancer study and thus a tissue,
whether a gene of interest is expected to be expressed. We next
used data provided by Database of Essential Genes (DEG) to
annotate whether a gene of interest is essential for the organism
(Zhang et al., 2004). Using this dataset, we mark a human gene
as essential if its homologue in any of the well-known model
organisms is known to be essential for the viability of that par-
ticular organism.

2.2 Identiﬁcation of vulnerabilities

2.2.] Sample-specific vulnerabilities Putting all these informa-
tion together, we then analyzed each sample in our dataset—in
the context of the cancer study it belongs to—to identify poten-
tial metabolic vulnerabilities. To accomplish this, for a given
cancer study, a tumor or cell line sample and an isoenzyme
gene set, we looked for cases where (i) one or more isoenzymes
are lost because of homozygous deletion, (ii) and the other ex-
pressed isoenzymes can be selectively targeted by at least one
drug. Once we found the vulnerabilities in this selective
manner, we also included all possible drugs, selective or not, in
our ﬁnal results.

2.2.2 Vulnerability scores To sort all predicted vulnerabilities
based on their internal consistency and annotations, we assigned
a score over 4.0 to each sample-speciﬁc vulnerability. For this,
we checked whether a given sample-speciﬁc vulnerability satis-
ﬁed any of the following criteria: (i) the homozygously deleted
gene is also underexpressed (or not expressed), (ii) there are any
Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs in the

suggested drug list, (iii) there are any ‘cancer’ drugs in the sug-
gested drug list, where a cancer drug means a drug that is cur-
rently FDA-approved and being used in cancer treatment and
(iv) the target of the suggested drug is not an essential gene in any
of the model organisms.

2.2.3 Vulnerabilities in tumor samples and matching cell lines We
ran our analysis on 5971 cancer samples covering 16 distinct
cancer studies and identiﬁed 4104 metabolic vulnerabilities in
1019 tumor samples and 482 cancer cell lines (Figs 3a and b).
In all, 146 of 4104 (4%) vulnerabilities had a score of 3, whereas
31, 51 and 14% vulnerabilities had a score of 2, 1 and 0, respect-
ively. Overall, we were able to identify 263 distinct homozygous
deletions that cause a predicted vulnerability (Table 2;
Supplementary Data for complete results); we found that 220
of 263 homozygous deletions were present in tumor samples
and 71% of these had at least one matching cell line (Fig. 3c).
We also found that 1833 (44%) of the vulnerabilities can poten-
tially be targeted with at least one FDA-approved drug, but in a
less-selective manner (Fig. 3d). One such example to this less-
selective targeting is the potential use of methotrexate when
either DHFR or DHFRLl is deleted in the sample, although
the drug targets both genes in this isoenzyme pair (Table 3).
Furthermore, we found that in 1695 of 4104 (41%) vulnerabil-
ities that we identiﬁed, intervention with drugs will involve tar-
geting at least one essential enzyme (Supplementary Fig. S1).
To allow better investigation of these vulnerability results, we
developed a web user interface accessible at http://cbio.mskcc.
org/cancergenomics/statius. The interface allows users to browse
vulnerabilities either through a cancer study or gene set-based
views, and for each predicted vulnerability, it provides additional
context annotations and information with external links (Fig. 4).

types. (a) Across 16 cancer studies, we identiﬁed 4101 vulnerabilities. (b) We screened 5971 samples (972 cell lines and 4999 tumor samples) and found
1019 tumor samples and 482 cancer cell lines to have possible metabolic vulnerabilities (red). (c) All vulnerabilities were attributable to 263 distinct
homozygous deletion events; 156 (60%) of these deletions were shared between at least one cell line and one tumor sample. (d) Forty-four percent of all
identiﬁed vulnerabilities can potentially be targeted with an FDA-approved drug (green) and furthermore 8% with an FDA-approved drug that is

currently known to be used in cancer therapy (orange)

3 METHODS
3.1 Obtaining information on isoenzymes

3.1.] From pathway resources: Reactome and HumanCyc We
obtained biological pathway information from both Reactome and
HumanCyc (Croft et al., 2011; Romero et al., 2005). We used entity-
level normalized BioPAX Level 3 outputs for both data resources. The
normalization was accomplished through Pathway Commons 2 and

cPath 2 software to standardize external references of entities in these
pathway datasets (Cerami et al., 2006). We then parsed these BioPAX
Level 3 pathway data using Paxtools library and extracted isoenzyme
gene sets using the following procedure [(Demir et al., 2010, 2013);
http ://biopax.org/paxtools.php]: we ﬁrst iterated for all
BiochemicalReactions that have at least one Controller to it. For a
given BiochemicalReaction, we then iterated for all Controller entities of
the reaction and obtained corresponding Xrefs (external references).

Note: Our analysis revealed 263 candidate vulnerabilities. Each of these vulnerabilities is associated with a gene set that represents isoenzymes that catalyze a metabolic
reaction, and deletion of one or more partner genes results in a vulnerability if there are targeted drug(s) that can selectively inhibit the other enzymes in the gene set. The
majority of the vulnerabilities in tumors were also present in at least one cell line (see Supplementary Table SI for an extended version of this table).

Using X refs that map an entity to HGNC (HUGO Gene Nomenclature
Committee), we collect HGNC gene symbols of corresponding control-
lers and treat them as isoenzyme groups. For each isoenzyme group, we
keep the name of the reaction, the pathway it belongs to and an image of
the corresponding reaction associated with that particular group for later
visualization features. All reaction images were generated with ChiBE
(Babur et al., 2010). For the described procedure, we used the whole
HumanCyc dataset, but for Reactome, we only used the reactions that
belong to the Metabolism pathway (Resource Description Framework
identiﬁcation: http: //www.reactome.org/biopax/48 887Pathway991).

3.1.2 From KEGG enzyme We also extracted metabolic isoenzyme
information from KEGG Enzyme database using the provider’s
Representational-state-transfer (REST)-based web service. For this, we
ﬁrst obtained all metabolic enzymes, identiﬁed by their corresponding EC
numbers, registered in KEGG Enzyme (http://rest.kegg.jp/list/ec). Then,
for each enzyme, we obtained all human genes that are associated with
the enzyme and created groups of isoenzymes using their gene symbols.
For later reference, we keep the primary name of the enzyme and the text-
based description of the reaction associated with the corresponding iso-
enzyme group.

3.1.3 Combining isoenzyme data form multiple resources and
ﬁltering After collecting isoenzyme groups, we pooled isoenzyme
groups from these multiple resources. For isoenzyme gene sets that
came from different resources but had the exact gene composition, we
used the following priority for the data resources to decide which copy to
keep in the ﬁnal analysis: (i) KEGG Enzyme, (ii) Reactome (Croft et al.,
2011) and (iii) HumanCyc (Romero et al., 2005).

3.2 Collecting drug—target data

To collect drug—target data from multiple resources, we used PiHelper
and aggregated data from all data resource it supports by default: (i)
DrugBank (Knox et al., 2011), (ii) KEGG Drug (Kanehisa et al.,
2012), (iii) Rask-Andersen et al., 2011, (iv) Genomics of Drug
Sensitivity in Cancer (Yang et al., 2013), (v) Garnett et al., 2012 and
(vi) Cancer.gov (http://cancer.gov).

We ran PiHelper with the default parameters and exported all aggre-
gated drug—target data in TSV (tab-separated values) format as previ-
ously described (Aksoy et al., 2013). This provided us with a list of genes
that can be targeted with a drug, and we used this information to anno-
tate all genes in our isoenzyme gene sets.

Note: In some cases, deletion of either of partner genes can result in a therapeutic vulnerability. For example, TOP2A and TOP2B are isoenzymes that function as ATP-
hydrolyzing DNA topoisomerases. Of 5971 cases (tumor or cell line samples), 70 have either TOP2B- or TOP2A-deletion (*). Either of these deletions creates vulnerabilities
that can be exploited with drugs, such as Doxorubicin or Etoposide, that selectively inhibit these isoenzymes.

Fig. 4. Four vulnerabilities, with different contexts, identiﬁed in the ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (TCGA) cancer study. Each vulnerability is
associated with a sample and a metabolic context. Furthermore, for each vulnerability, the gene sets are annotated to provide information whether a gene
is homozygously deleted (red; HomDel), essential (black; E/G), not expressed (orange; N/E), shows tissue-speciﬁc expression (green; TS/E) or is known
to be selectively targeted by a drug (gray; drugs: N). For gene sets extracted from Pathway Commons, the metabolic reaction of interest is visualized as

an image that was produced by ChiBE (Babur et al., 2010)

3.3 Labeling genes using additional annotations

3.3.1 Annotating tissue-speciﬁc expression patterns For tissue-
speciﬁc gene expression annotation, we used data produced by TiGER
(Liu et al., 2008). We downloaded raw ﬁle containing tissue-speciﬁc
UniGene lists and mapped this information, i.e. whether the expression
of a gene is restricted to a single tissue, using gene symbol to UniGene

maps from the same provider. We also adopted the tissue terminology
used by TiGER and annotated cancer studies we used in our study in
accordance with this terminology (Table 1).

3.3.2 Annotating essential genes To annotate genes that are known
to be essential in a model organism, we used data provided by DEG
(Zhang et al., 2004). For this, we downloaded the whole database and

used gene symbol-based annotations for only eukaryotes. We annotate all
human genes in the database as essential in our analysis. For non-human
essential genes, we used homology-group datasets provided by the
HomoloGene (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/homologene) to map these
genes to their human homologues. When annotating a gene as essential,
we always include the species information as part of the annotation for
future reference. We collected annotations from the following model
organisms: (i) Homo sapiens, (ii) Mus musculus, (iii) Drosophila mel-
anogaster, (iv) Saccharomyces cerevisiae, (V) Caenorhabditis elegans,
(Vi) Danio rerio and (Vii) Arabidopsis thaliana.

3.4 Handling cancer studies and genomic proﬁles

We accessed public data for cancer studies listed in Table 1 using
cBioPortal’s web service [(Cerami et al., 2012; Gao et al., 2013); http://
cbioportal.org]. For each study, (i) we ﬁrst collected all case IDs, (ii) we
then obtained categorized gene-centric CNA data (when possible, we
used data generated through either GISTIC or RAE algorithms: —2:
homozygous deletion; —1: heterozygous deletion; 0: diploid; 1: gain; 2:
ampliﬁcation) (Mermel et al., 2011; Taylor et al., 2008), (iii) when avail-
able, we used normalized Z—scores for gene-centric mRNA expression
and treated values <—2 as underexpressed for a particular sample and
(iv) manually assigned tissues based on the type of the cancer.

One exception to these general rules was the Cancer Cell Line
Encyclopedia (CCLE), where normalized mRNA expression data was
missing. For this study, we used median-normalized gene-centric probe
levels and treated log2 values <5, which corresponds to upper limit of the
lower quartile of all expression data, as underexpressed.

A list of genomic proﬁle IDs that were used for this analysis can be
found within the Supplementary Material. Further details for each
genomic proﬁle can be accessed from the cBioPortal Web site: http://
cbioportal.org.

4 DISCUSSION

Cancer cell contains many somatic genomic alterations, some
of which may result in therapeutic vulnerabilities. Therapeutic
approaches targeting such vulnerabilities are promising because
they are expected to be lethal to cancer cells but not to healthy
(e.g. non-cancer) cells, thus reducing the potential for toxic side
effects. Here we present a systematic approach to identify a
subset of such vulnerabilities, involving metabolic pathways, by
taking advantage of publicly available data resources. As a proof
of concept, we ran our analysis on 16 cancer studies available via
the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics and predicted 4104 meta-
bolic vulnerabilities. We included the CCLE in our analysis as a
separate cancer study, and this allowed us to match vulnerabil-
ities in tumor samples with those in cell lines. Overall, we found
2706 vulnerabilities resulting from 220 distinct homozygous de-
letion events in 1019 tumor samples. In all, 71% of these vulner-
ability-causing homozygous deletions were also present in at
least one cell line, therefore, opening the possibility of testing a
majority of these predicted vulnerabilities in vitro. Reassuringly,
using this systematic method, we were able to detect a previously
veriﬁed metabolic vulnerability, which is due to a homozygous
deletion affecting an enolase isoenzyme (Muller et al., 2012)
(Supplementary Fig. S2). Unlike other studies that have previ-
ously predicted metabolic vulnerabilities using a theoretical
model of cancer metabolism, here we interpreted all datasets in
a sample-speciﬁc manner (Folger et al., 2011). This helped us
capture many vulnerabilities that were not reported previously
(Table 2) (Folger et al., 2011; Muller et al., 2012).

Furthermore, we based our analysis on homozygous deletions
in cancer samples with a particular focus on metabolic pathways,
but our method can easily be extended to signaling pathways and
also to any disabling genomic or epigenomic event, such as mu-
tations and hyper-methylation events. We restricted our analysis
to consider only homozygous deletions because at the time of the
study, the number of samples that have a copy-number proﬁle
was considerably higher compared with the number of samples
that have either mutation or methylation proﬁle. Moreover, we
only used metabolic pathways because details of metabolic reac-
tions are provided at a better level of granularity in many of the
pathway data resources. This allowed us to infer potentially syn-
thetic lethal gene sets from the pathway resources with higher
conﬁdence. For many signaling pathways, this type of inference
is considerably harder to accomplish because they are not as well
characterized and well curated as metabolic pathways yet.

The quality of our vulnerability predictions highly depends on
the quality of the homozygous deletion calls made for each meta-
bolic gene. A false-positive homozygous deletion call, for ex-
ample, will also lead to a false-positive vulnerability prediction
in our analysis. To overcome this problem, we assign a higher
score to vulnerabilities when the homozygously deleted gene is
also underexpressed in a speciﬁc sample. Another likely source of
false-positive predictions is our assumption that all metabolic
reactions are essential for cell viability, and therefore, genes cat-
alyzing the same reaction form a synthetic lethal group. These
types of issues, however, can be easily addressed by testing a
predicted vulnerability in vitro using one of the cell lines that
has the vulnerability of interest.

To better prioritize the vulnerabilities in terms of their applic-
ability to the clinic and their reliability, we assigned a score (over
4.0) to each individual vulnerability we identiﬁed based on the
following criteria. First, to emphasize the likelihood of homozy-
gous deletion being true, we checked whether transcripts of
homozygously deleted genes are also expressed relatively at low
levels compared with the diploid samples. Next, we looked
whether the suggested drug to exploit a vulnerability is either
FDA-approved or already being used in cancer therapy, where
satisfying either criteria indicates not only better availability of
the drug for validation experiments but also relatively easier
translation to clinical trials. Finally, we checked whether target-
ing the vulnerability will inhibit an essential gene, hence increas-
ing the possibility of a toxic effect for the host.

These criteria reﬂect a subjective view of a reliable vulnerabil-
ity prediction and can be expanded by incorporating more an-
notation and supportive datasets to the analysis. For example,
various drug screen studies and small hairpin RNA knockdown
assays provide relative sensitivities of cell lines toward inhibition
of various cellular species as public datasets (Barretina et al.,
2012; Cheung et al., 2011), and this information can be further
used in the context of vulnerabilities, where sensitivities that can
be explained by a predicted vulnerability are given an extra score.
Another possible extension to our scoring scheme is to give extra
scores to vulnerabilities for which suggested drugs are currently
being tested in clinical trials for the tumor type that matches the
patient’s.

Our analysis identiﬁes only vulnerabilities for which the target
gene can selectively be inhibited by a compound, but for each
vulnerability prediction, we also report drugs that are less

Cancer Genomic Computational Metabolic Vulnerability Testing Clinical Trials

Fig. 5. Potential applications to personalized and/or precision cancer
therapy. Our method can easily be extended to identify vulnerabilities
from the genomic proﬁle of a recently diagnosed cancer patient. The
candidate vulnerabilities for this patient can then be tested on primary
cell cultures or xenograft models (established from patient’s tumor
sample) with drugs of interest as suggested by our analysis. Once the
vulnerability is veriﬁed, ‘basket’ clinical trials can be designed to test
the efﬁcacy of the drug on patients who are predicted to have this par-
ticular vulnerability

selective and yet potentially interesting for exploiting a vulner-
ability. Considering both selective and non-selective drugs, our
results show that 44% of the identiﬁed vulnerabilities can poten-
tially be targeted with an FDA-approved drug; moreover, a
smaller fraction, 8%, of all vulnerabilities seems to be targetable
with drugs that are both FDA-approved and already being used
in cancer therapy (Table 3).

Opportunities to exploit these vulnerabilities have previously
been overlooked because genomic alterations that cause such
vulnerabilities are relatively less frequent within each cancer
study. We show that with the help of a systematic method that
can efﬁciently combine data from diverse resources, it is possible
to identify vulnerabilities that cover a considerable number of
patients when aggregated across different cancer studies. We be-
lieve this type of systematic and patient-speciﬁc treatment sug-
gestion will prove essential especially in designing ‘basket trials’
that will investigate the effects of a targeted agent against a spe-
ciﬁc genetic alteration (Fig. 5).

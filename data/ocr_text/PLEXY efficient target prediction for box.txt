ABSTRACT

Motivation: Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are an abundant class
of non-coding RNAs with a wide variety of cellular functions including
chemical modification of RNA, telomere maintanance, pre-rRNA
processing and regulatory activities in alternative splicing. The main
role of box C/D snoRNAs is to determine the targets for 2/-O-ribose
methylation, which is important for rRNA maturation and splicing
regulation of some mRNAs. The targets are still unknown, however,
for many ‘orphan’ snoRNAs. While a fast and efficient target predictor
for box H/ACA snoRNAs is available, no comparable tool exists for
box C/D snoRNAs, even though they bind to their targets in a much
less complex manner.

Results: PLEXY is a dynamic programming algorithm that computes
thermodynamically optimal interactions of a box C/D snoRNA with
a putative target RNA. Implemented as scanner for large input
sequences and equipped with filters on the duplex structure, PLEXY
is an efficient and reliable tool for the prediction of box C/D snoRNA
target sites.

1 INTRODUCTION

Box C/D snoRNAs are mainly involved in 2’ —0—ribose methylation
of speciﬁc nucleotides in ribosomal and spliceosomal RNAs (Tems
and Terns, 2002). They are characterized by two sequence motifs,
the C—box (RTGATGA) close to the 5’—end, the D—box (CTGA) close
to the 3’ —end, and in most cases, an additional C’— and D’—box.
The targeted position is located exactly 5 nt upstream of the 5’—end
of the D— and/or D’—box. It is determined by sequence—speciﬁc
hybridization (Fig. 1A). The base—pairing region has a length of
7—20 nt and exhibits a simple structure consisting of stacked base
pairs and only a few mismatches. In particular, bulges are absent
(Ni et al., 1997).

Recently, an efﬁcient and reliable tool for predicting the much
more complex interactions of box H/ACA snoRNAs with their

targets has become available (Tafer et al., 2010). It is based on
the thermodynamic principles of RNA folding. No comparable
approach is currently available for the simple box C/D snoRNA—
RNA duplexes. snoTarget (Bazeley et al., 2008), at present
the only computer program devoted to box C/D snoRNA target
prediction, employs pattern matching to ﬁnd candidates, which
are then ranked by the cofolding energy of snoRNA and target
as computed by RNAcof old (Bernhart et al., 2006). In contrast,
PLEXY directly computes the interaction energies by means of
dynamic programming.

2 RESULTS

The PLEXY Algorithm: PLEXY takes a snoRNA sequence with
annotated box—motifs and a list of potential target RNAs as input.
First, PLEXY extracts the putative antisense elements (ASEs), which
are deﬁned as the 20 nt long segments directly upstream of the
D/D’—boxes. PLEXY then calls the RNApleX algorithm to compute
stable duplexes between the ASE and the putative targets. RNApl ex
is a fast folding algorithm for unbranched RNA structures that
utilizes a linearized energy model to achieve a linear runtime
behavior (Tafer and Hofacker, 2008). In contrast to RNAcof old
used in snoTarget, RNApleX neglects the internal structure of
the interacting RNA sequences and hence is fast enough for genome—
wide searches without the need for additional preﬁltering steps. The
resulting duplexes are then ﬁltered using the rules compiled by Chen
et al. (2007):

(a) the interaction should be at least 7 nt long,

(b) no bulges are allowed,

(0) the core duplex region contains at most one mismatch, and
(d) the methylated residue forms a Watson—Crick pair.

Finally, putative target sites are ranked by their duplex energies
(Supplementary Material S2).

Runtime: the runtime of PLEXY scales linearly with the length of
the target sequence. It scans 106 nt of target sequences in 19 s on a
2.66 GHz Intel processor (Q9400). This is only four times slower
than the pattern search algorithm employed by snoTarget.

Accuracy: to compare the performance of PLEXY and
snoTarget, we used a collection of experimentally veriﬁed
snoRNA—rRNA interactions of yeast (Lowe and Eddy, 1999) and
human (Lestrade and Weber, 2006) and used yeast (Samarsky and
Fournier, 1999) and human (Lestrade and Weber, 2006) snoRNA

and rRNA sequences. In yeast, PLEXY correctly predicted all 50
target sites, 49 (98%) being ranked ﬁrst. In contrast, snoTarget
recovered only 37 of 50 (74%) of the methylation sites, and only
20 (40%) achieved the top rank. In human, PLEXY found 116 of
118 (98.3%) known rRNA targets, 108 (91.55%) with top rank
(Supplementary Material S1). snoTarget retrieved 78.88% of
these targets and ranked 55.77% of them at the top. The data are
summarized as ROC curves in (Fig. 1B). The minimum free energy
for the predicted duplexes on the rRNAs averages —20.4kcal/mol.
The energy distribution is shown in Figure 1C.

False positive rate: we tested 116 snoRNAs with known targets on
rRNAs against a 10 Mb segment of the human genome (chr12:2M—
12M). A duplex is a false positive hit (FP) if its interaction energy
is lower than that of the true interaction. For 24 snoRNAs no FP
was found, 39 additional snoRNAs had less than one FP per Mb,
and more than 80% (98/116) of the snoRNAs had less than one FP
per 100 Kb. The false positive rate depends exponentially on the
interaction energy (Fig. 1C), hence PLEXY cannot reliably predict
the few snoRNA—rRNA interactions that have very poor interaction
energies.

Targets in mRNAs: in contrast to the majority of the box C/D
snoRNAs, the members of the brain—speciﬁc HBII-52 family do not
methylate rRNAs or snRNAs but basepair close to an alternative
splice junction in the mRNA transcript 5H T—2 C, which codes for the
serotonin receptor (Kishore and Stamm, 2006). A target search in a
large dataset of (primary) transcripts expressed in brain (covering
about ~0.75 X 109 nt) returned the known target site with median
duplex energy of —29.1kcal/mol for 41 of the 42 members of the
snoRNA family, and revealed a second putative target with a median
interaction energy of —29.3 kcal/mol in 37 of the 42 snoRNAs.
The second region is located in a large intronic region of the
neurexin primary transcript (hg18/chr2:50666208—50666189). The
example demonstrates that PLEXY can be employed for essentially
transcriptome—wide target searches.

3 DISCUSSION

Recently, it was discovered that HBII—52 is also processed into
shorter RNAs, so—called psnoRNAs (for processed snoRNAs), that
appear to be involded in splicing regulation. The psnoRNAs form
RNPs distinct from the ‘common’ snoRNPs. It is not surprising,
therefore, that the psnoRNAs—mediated mode of action follows

somewhat different interaction rules, although they involve the same
regions of the snoRNA. For instance, psnoRNA—mRNA duplexes
appear to have more mismatches than canonical snoRNA—rRNA
ones (Kishore et al., 2010). As soon as these recognition parameters
are better understood, they could be easily included in the PLEXY
algorithm by simply adding new ﬁltering rules.

Finally, we remark that the speciﬁcity of PLEXY can be enhanced
by considering evolutionary conservation of the target site. This can
be achieved most easily by ﬁltering the predicted putative targets by
their sequence conservation or by using the ability of RNApleX to
compute interactions between multiple sequence alignments.

In summary, PLEXY is a computationally efﬁcient tool to predict
target sites for box C/D snoRNAs. It is speciﬁc enough to reliably
identify modiﬁcation sites on rRNAs and snRNAs. At the same time,
it is efﬁcient enough to perform genome—wide searches for potential
mRNA targets of orphan snoRNAs.

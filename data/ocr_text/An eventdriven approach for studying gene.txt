Abstract

Motivation: Gene blocks are genes co—located on the chromosome. In many cases, gene blocks are
conserved between bacterial species, sometimes as operons, when genes are co—transcribed. The
conservation is rarely absolute: gene loss, gain, duplication, block splitting and block fusion are fre—
quently observed. An open question in bacterial molecular evolution is that of the formation and
breakup of gene blocks, for which several models have been proposed. These models, however,
are not generally applicable to all types of gene blocks, and consequently cannot be used to
broadly compare and study gene block evolution. To address this problem, we introduce an event—
based method for tracking gene block evolution in bacteria.

Results: We show here that the evolution of gene blocks in proteobacteria can be described by a
small set of events. Those include the insertion of genes into, or the splitting of genes out of a gene
block, gene loss, and gene duplication. We show how the event—based method of gene block evolu—
tion allows us to determine the evolutionary rateand may be used to trace the ancestral states of
their formation. We conclude that the event—based method can be used to help us understand the
formation of these important bacterial genomic structures.

1 Introduction

 

In bacterial and archaeal genomes, gene blocks are sequences of
genes co—located on the chromosome, whose evolutionary conserva—
tion can be conservation of gene blocks can be strikingly apparent
(Overbeek et al., 2005; Pellegrini et al., 1999) and has been used in
phylogenetic and functional studies (Enault et al., 2003; Overbeek
et al., 1999, 2014; Srinivasan et al., 2005). Conservations across
numerous taxa indicate that at least some conserved blocks are
operons: a special case of gene blocks where the genes are co—
transcribed to polycistronic mRNA and are often associated with a
single function, such as a metabolic pathway or a protein complex.
It is estimated that 5—50% of bacterial genes reside in operons

(Cherry, 2003; Wolf et al., 2001). Typically operons are under the
control of one or more regulator proteins, which facilitate co—regu—
lated transcription. From an evolutionary point of view, there are
several questions that are asked about operons and gene blocks.
How did these units evolve? What confers fitness upon genes in an
operon or block structure as opposed to not being neighboring? Are
certain operons more or less evolutionarily conserved in bacteria?
What affects the conservation of the operon or gene block structure
in different taxa?

Several models exist to explain gene block evolution (for more
extensive reviews see Fondi et al., 2009; Martin and McInerney,
2009). One of the first models proposed for biopathway evolution

is the Natal or Retrograde model which proposed that genes are
arranged in blocks and operons due to tandem gene duplications
derived from the depletion of metabolites in the environment
(Horowitz, 1945). However, this model does not explain many op—
erons which encode for proteins that are not homologous. Early
co-adaptation models (reviewed in Stahl and Murray, 1966)
applied to operons propose that neighboring genes into operons
would lower the chances of co—adapted genes being separated by
random recombination. However, orthologous replacements of
operon genes have been observed, suggesting that preservation of
co—localization of co—adapted alleles is not an exclusive reason for
operons to form. The coregulation model is derived from the ori—
ginal definition of an operon: that the neighboring operon genes is
due to the increased benefit of coregulation, providing an increased
fitness for the population which has the operon (Price et al., 2005).
However, intermediate stages involving the cotranscription of non-
beneficial genes cannot explain an incremental increase in fitness.
The selfish operon model (Lawrence and Roth, 1996) proposes
that the formation of gene blocks in bacteria is mediated by trans—
fer of DNA within and among taxa. The model proposes an in—
crease in fitness for the constituent genes because it enables the
transfer of functionally coupled genes that would otherwise not in—
crease fitness if they were separate. Furthermore, the joining of
genes into blocks and eventually operons is beneficial for the hori-
zontal gene transfer (HGT) of weakly selected, functionally
coupled genes. Thus, we expect to see a certain percentage of ‘gen—
etic hitchhikers’: non—beneficial genes that are coupled to benefi—
cial genes in the operon. It seems that the selfish operon model
does account for the structure of some operons, but is not the only
mechanism of operon construction. The main finding against the
selfish operon model’s exclusivity is the much lower number of
‘hitchhiking’, non-essential genes than expected (Pal and Hurst,
2004). Price et al. proposed that operon evolution is being driven
by selection on gene expression patterns, and they also found that
although genes within operons are usually closely spaced, genes in
highly expressed operons may be widely spaced because of regula—
tory fine-tuning by intervening sequences. This study was based on
a comparative analysis of two genomes, but included extensive
expression data (Price et al., 2006). Another model is that of the
mosaic operons (Omelchenko et al., 2003). In this model,
shuffling, disruption, and HGT play dominant parts in operon for—
mation. Under this model, an operon is not a steady—state evolu—
tionary entity, but rather a dynamic entity which continuously
acquires or loses genes via HGT. In their study, Omelchenko et al.
have shown that although some operons follow the selfish model,
many do not, with HGT of individual genes into operons being
quite common. Whole operon transfer was identified in ~30% of
the operons studied. Another 20% of the operons were identified
as mosaic operons. However, the study does not attempt to further
classify the different types of mosaic operons, but rather provides
an in—depth study of some of them. A study of the his operon by
Fani et al. (2005) has proposed a ‘piecewise’ model to operon evo—
lution. The piecewise model suggests that the construction of the
his operon is a sequential series of events starting from a scattered
set of constituent genes. Other models include an adaptive life
cycle of operons, which explains why they rarely evolve optimally
(Price et al., 2006). To explain the persistence of gene blocks and
operons once they are formed, Fang et al. (2008) suggest that co—
transcription, protein—protein interactions and functional coupling
are a stabilizing force maintaining genomic neighborhoods (Fang
et al., 2008). One interesting study has done away with genes as
the atomic unit of gene blocks, and instead investigated domain

rearrangements to identify and classify conserved gene blocks
(Pasek et al., 2005 ). Another process suggested to contribute to the
formation of gene blocks is that of strand replication bias (Rocha
and Danchin, 2001). It should be noted that plasmids are also a
platform that selects for and maintains gene blocks (Gonzalez
et al., 2003); however, in this work we limited our study to
chromosomal DNA.

Each of the operon evolution models presents a mechanism and
fits a biological rationale to the observation that operons/gene
blocks exist in extant taxa. However, these models do not readily
allow us to quantify the changes between either operons/gene
block or between different organisms. Moreover, more than one
model can generally be applied to a chosen gene block and set of
taxa. Therefore, there is a need to create a universally applicable
method for charting gene block evolution, and quantifying its
conservation across taxa. Having such a method on hand can help
determine the specific evolutionary trajectory of any given gene
block. Here we describe such a method, which, in conjunction
with a novel phylogenetic visualization method, dubbed
‘phylomatrix’, enables the quick examination of gene block conser—
vation across taxa.

2 Approach

We present a novel approach to investigate gene block evolution
which we call the event-driven method. Our approach borrows
from the model describing the evolution of DNA and protein se—
quences. The accepted model for sequence evolution posits two
types of basic events leading to change over time in DNA or
protein sequences: indels and mutations. Indels and mutations are
assigned scores based on the frequency of their occurrence over
time (Dayhoff, 1978; Henikoff and Henikoff, 1992). Given a pair
of sequences, a typical hypothesis is posed as to whether they are
homologs. The hypothesis is not rejected if we can show that these
two sequences are similar with a reasonable statistical significance.
In practical terms, the similarity between two sequences is
ascertained if the cumulative score of indels and mutation events
differentiating the sequences is above a certain threshold, deter—
mined by an appropriate null model, so that it can be stated that
the sequences are significantly similar. Note that the smallest unit
in which a change can happen is the nucleotide (DNA) or the
amino—acid (protein).

The event—driven method of gene block evolution describes evo—
lutionary events that occur between gene blocks that are homolo—
gous between different bacterial species. The atomic unit of change
is now the gene as a building—block of a gene block, rather than the
nucleotide as the building block of a gene. This procedure is best
explained by example. Suppose that genome A has neighboring
genes A(a, h, c) in that order (In this annotation, upper case letters
are the taxon, lower case letters are the genes). Genome B has
homologs to those in A 8(a, b) are neighboring, but Bc is located
somewhere else in the chromosome, and reversed. As for genome
C, c was deleted, so C(a, h) are neighboring. For the scenario
described, we can say that there was a gene split event between A
and B, and a gene deletion event between C and any of the other
genomes for the gene block A(a, h, c). When the phylogenetic tree
is known, these events can be placed on the tree. See full example
in Figure 1.

If changes in gene blocks can be represented using a small set of
events, the number and type of these events can be used to describe
the evolutionary history of the gene block. Here we report on a set
of 38 operons from Escherichia coli whose homologs we have

examined across 33 taxa of proteobacteria. For these 38 operons
and related orthologous gene blocks, we show an implementation of
the event—driven approach to operon evolution.

3 Methods

We define the following concepts: reference taxon is a taxon
where operons have been identified by experimental means. Here
we use E.coli K—12 MG1655 as the reference taxon. We chose
E.coli because it is expertly and comprehensively annotated in the
RegulonDB database (Salgado et al., 2006). Neighboring genes:
two genes are considered neighboring if they are 500 nucleotides
or fewer apart, and on the same strand. A gene block comprises no
fewer than two open reading frames, or ORFs which are neighbor-
ing. An event is a change in the gene block between any two
species with homologous gene blocks. Orthoblocks (gene blocks
that are orthologous) are defined as follows: two organisms have
orthoblocks when each organism must have at least two neighbor—
ing genes that are homologous to genes in a gene block in the
reference taxon’s genome. Genes are considered homologous if
their pairwise BLAST e—value is 10—10 or less. Relying on a strict
BLAST threshold may exclude homologous proteins whose
sequence similarity is not high (false negatives). However, this
strategy will rarely include proteins with a different function (false
positives). This rigorous threshold was chosen with the primary
goal of minimizing false positives when inferring function by
similarity.

3.1 Evolutionary events

Next we define events that we use to examine changes in gene block
structure between different bacterial taxa relative to E.coli. We
chose a set of target taxa with known phylogenetic relationships.
The genomes of the target taxa were searched for homologous
blocks to the operons found in E.coli. The operons we chose were
selected based on the following criteria: (i) all the genes were protein
coding; (ii) for all blocks chosen, the co—transcription was experi—
mentally determined in E.coli; (iii) each operon comprised at least
five genes; (iv) each operon has orthoblocks in at least nine other
genomes. Using these filtering criteria, and RegulonDB’s annotation
of E.coli as our reference taxon, we compiled 38 operons for this

study. See Supplementary Material, Table 81 for a full list of op-
erons, and Supplementary Table S3 for a list of taxa used.

We define the following pairwise events between orthoblocks
from different taxons:

1. Splits If two genes in one taxon are neighboring and their homo-
logs in the other taxon are not, then that is deﬁned as a single
split event. The distance is the minimal number of split events
identiﬁed between the compared genomes.

2. Deletions A gene exists in the operon in the one taxon, but its
homolog cannot be found in an orthoblock in another taxon.
Note that the deﬁnition of homolog, e—value 10—10 is strict, and
may result in false negatives. The deletion distance is the number
of deletion events identiﬁed between the compared target
genomes.

3. Duplications A duplication event is deﬁned as having gene j in a
gene block in the source genome, and homologous genes (1", j”)
in the homologous block in the target genome. The duplication
distance is the number of duplication events counted between
the source and target genomes. The duplication has to occur in a
gene block to be tallied.

Other events were examined too: rearrangement of genes, genes
moving to another strand, fusion and fission of ORFs. These event
types correlated strongly with one or more of the three event types
listed above, and were therefore discarded. Fusion/fission of ORFs
was rare in our data set, so this event type was discarded as well.

The event—driven method does not account for HGT, which is
suggested as a common mechanism for transferring neighboring
genes (Lawrence and Roth, 1996). However, we have not yet incor—
porated HGT into our model. We have tried using AlienHunter
(Langille et al., 2008), and the IslandViewer (Langille and
Brinkman, 2009) suite to detect HGT events in our data. Given that
the taxa we are analyzing are closely related, these softwares were
unable to detect HGT events.

3.2 Different conservation rates for gene blocks in
proteobacteria

3.2.1 Determining orthology

To trace the events that affect genes in gene blocks, it is necessary
to determine which genes are orthologous between any two taxa
when more than two possible homolog pairings may exist. The
problem may be stated as follows: given a gene g in genome A, and
a set of homologs to g in genome B, H; : {g1,g2, ...,g,,}, which of
the genes in H; is the ortholog to g? The Best Reciprocal Hits
(BRH) method is commonly used to find orthologs, however, BRH
assumes that ortholog g,- is necessarily that which is most similar to
g, discounting the possibility of different evolutionary rates of
paralogs. We therefore take a different approach in determining
ortholog identity for genes in homology blocks. When selecting a
single ortholog among all possible homologs in H g, we use synteny
and sequence similarity to determine which of the genes in an
examined genome is the correct ortholog. To do so we use the fol—
lowing three criteria:

1. Prioritizing by gene blocks We prioritize orthologs that are in
gene blocks over orthologs that are isolated in the genome, and
we look for the minimal number of such blocks that contain a
representative of every ortholog that we recover. Example: the
operon in E.coli had gene block (ahcdef). The target genome has
the following orthologs grouped in its genome: (ahcd), (ahc). In
this case, we will choose as orthologs the genes populating

(abcd).

2. Recovering maximum number of genes We consider the number
of genes found. Example: the reference taxon operon had the
gene block (ahcdef). The studied genome has the following
blocks (ahcd) and ((ahc), (de)). We would choose ((ahc), (de)),
two blocks,even though (ahcde) is one block, because in the lat—
ter case we recover more homologs.

3. Minimizing duplications If in the target genome we have a
choice between ortholog groups ((ahc), (de)) or ((ahcd), (de)),
we choose the ﬁrst because it has the minimal number of gene
duplications.

We now define a target homolog as a gene in the target genome
that is a homolog to a gene in a gene block in the reference genome
E.coli. and a target homolog block as one or more target homologs,
spaced 3500 bp.

6: Use a greedy algorithm to recover the maximum number of

target homologs prioritizing by gene blocks while minimizing gene
duplications and maximizing number of genes recovered.
7: end for

3.2.2 Event-based distances

Once orthologs are chosen, we are able to define the event—based
distance between any two gene blocks with respect to split events,
duplication events and deletion events. The distance between any
two homologous gene blocks found in target organisms is defined as
follows:

1. Split distance (ds) is the absolute difference in the number of rele-
vant gene blocks between the two taxa. Example: for the refer-
ence gene block with genes (ahcdefg) Genome A has blocks
((ahc), (defg)) and genome B has ((ahc), (de),  Therefore,
dS(A,B) = |2 — 3| 2 1.

2. Duplication distance (du) is the pairwise count of duplications
between two orthoblocks. Example: we have a reference gene
block (ahcde). Now, for genomes A and B the orthoblocks are
A : ((ahd)) B : ((ahhcc)). Gene Ab is duplicated in genome B,
thus a duplication distance d, (A, B) of 1. Gene c generates a dis—
tance of one deletion (see below) and one duplication. This is be—
cause the most parsimonious explanation is that the most recent
ancestor for A and B may have had one copy of c, thus generat—
ing a duplication in one lineage, and a deletion in another.
Because gene d exists only in the reference genome, it has no
bearing on the event—based distance between the homologous
gene blocks A and B.

3. Deletion distance dd is the difference in number of orthologs
that are in the homologous gene blocks of the genome of one or—
ganism, or the other, but not in both.

3.2.3 Gene block frequency matrices: phylomatrices

The rules outlined above allow us to determine the pairwise dis—
tance, for a given event and gene block, between any two genomes
in our corpus. To visualize the frequency of an event in a block, we
created matrices whose axes are the examined species, and whose
cell is the normalized value of the pairwise distance for any given

event. For an event 11 being one of insertion, deletion or duplication,
for any two taxa i and j with homology blocks, the value for the nor—
malized distance matrix entry M,,- is:

 _ fdv

Mij =
0d

where fdv is the mean value of the distance for event 1) calculated
over all pairs of taxa np sharing that event:

_ 1 . .

xdv : — -dV(17/)

'<
np 1 I

and adv is the standard deviation.

3.2.4 Choice of proteobacteria species and

phylogenetic tree construction

We chose our species as in Fani et al. (2005 ), removing a few species
that we deemed to be too evolutionarily close. The phylogenetic
trees shown in the study were constructed from multiple sequence
alignments of the rpoD gene, using ClustalX 2.1 (Larkin et al.,
2007), followed by neighbor—joining. Supplementary Table S3 lists
the species used.

4 Results

The results of this study show an interesting variety in gene block
evolution. First, we show the gene bloc/e tree diagrams in a phylo—
genetic tree. These diagrams show the gene blocks as we find them
in the different species we examine. The lack of a gene in the gene
block phylogenetic tree does not mean the homolog does not exist in
that taxon, but rather that it is no longer detectable by BLAST at the
threshold of 10—10. Further, if a gene block is missing from the
phylogenetic tree, it means that there are no two genes in the gene
block that are neighboring in the genome within a distance of
£5 00 bp.

To visualize the frequency of events, we generate gene block
event frequency matrices or colored phylomatrices as described in
Section 3. The value of each matrix is a z—score. Figure 2 shows two
conserved gene blocks, and Figure 3 shows two non—conserved gene

blocks.

4.1 Conservation of gene blocks and relationship to
function

The event—driven method enables us to examine the relative conser—
vation of gene blocks in proteobacteria. Figure 4 the gene blocks are
arranged in descending order of conservation. The most conserved
block is the operon rleAJL-rpoBC, a highly conserved transcrip-
tion unit of ribosomal proteins (rle, rle, rplA and rplL) and two
RNA polymerase subunits (rpoB and rpoC) (Steward and Linn,
1991), Figure 2(a).

No gene duplications or deletions were detected. Our program
does erroneously call a deletion of the rle in Wolinella, but this is
an error due to the stringent e—value cutoff and having a single exem-
plar of the rpl] gene as a query. The splits we detect are mostly be—
tween the rleA and rpl]L-rpoB C transcription units. The genes in
this operon have multiple promotor and attenuator sites (Ralling
and Linn, 1984), and have been shown to be governed by a complex
set of signals (Steward and Linn, 1991). It appears that a complete
tetracistronic product is transcribed from rleAJL with less abun-
dant bicistronic products of rle-rplA and rplj-rplL (Downing and

panel. High-resolution figure available at: http://iddo-friedberg.net/operon-evolution/

Dennis, 1987), which may explain the strong conservation of these
four genes in this gene block.

Another well—conserved operon is the atp operon, which codes
for the genes for the HT—ATPase complex. ATP synthase is respon—
sible for generating ATP using the proton motive force across
the cell membrane (Fernandez Moran et al., 1964). We examined
the operon coding for ATP synthase, athBEFHAGDC. Although
highly conserved, this operon does exhibit gene deletions in some
taxa. Most notably the gene ath, a nonessential gene that codes
for a helper protein that assists the assembly of the ATP—synthase
complex’s rotor. We readily recover this gene in orthoblocks in or-
ganisms that are closely related to E.coli. We did not observe any
duplications in our dataset, The ath deletion was a true deletion,
which makes sense functionally as the ath gene codes for the Ath
protein which is a nonessential component of the HT—ATPase
complex. The other components supposedly deleted, apr, atpE in
e—proteobacteria and oc—proteobacteria are highly dissimilar to
the equivalent E.coli genes, and are therefore not identifiable
as homologs (e—value using BLAST > 0.01, data not shown;
Figure 2b).

At the other edge of the conservation spectrum, we examined the
hyf operon (Andrews et al., 1997). As the phylomatrix shows, the
gene block of 12 genes is not conserved as a single block in any of
the proteobacteria in our data set. The hyf proton—translocating for-
mate hydrogen lyase block of 12 genes appears to be an operon only
in E.coli, although many of the genes appear in separate blocks in
other bacteria. The hyf operon in E.coli is probably silent, at least
under the environmental conditions examined, and has only been
expressed under artificial conditions (Self et al., 2004). Not being
able to express it in E.coli under native conditions suggests it may be
redundant, as does its lack of conservation in the species examined.
See Figure 3(a).

The paa operon in E.coli encodes for a multicomponent oxygen—
ase/reductase subunit for the aerobic degradation of phenylacetic
acid. The E.coli operon comprises 11 genes. The distribution of the
genes of this operon in 102 bacterial genomes was studied in detail
in (Martin and McInerney, 2009). The authors’ conclusions from
this study were that de novo clustering of some of this orthoblock’s
genes occur repeatedly, due to weak selective pressure. The proxim-
ity of genes sets up opportunities for co—transcription. Specifically,

this study has shown that genes paaA, B, C and paaD, when they
are found, always co-occur in an operon. This makes sense, as those
genes form a stable molecular complex with those genes coding for
essential subunits for the degradation of phenylacetate (Grishin
et al., 2011). Both our study and Martin et al.’s (2009) found the
full gene block only in E.coli and Pseudomonas putida. Another
gene-block co-occurrence we find in our study is that of paaF and
paaG, in 12 out of 23 species in which any components of the paa
orthoblock occur. The products of these two genes form the FaaGH
complex, another stable complex which catalyzes consecutive steps
in the phenylacetate degradation pathway, and it was hypothesized
that the proximity of the two proteins in a complex provides a fit-
ness advantage (Grishin et al., 2012).

Another use of the event-driven method is the reconstruction of
ancestral gene blocks along the evolutionary tree. Supplementary
Figure 51 shows such a reconstruction for paa in the y-proteobacte-
ria species used in our study. We manually examined the possible
events needed to transition between the tree’s nodes, and along each
branch minimized the number of events leading to the extant ortho-
blocks. One interesting outcome of this analysis, is that paa ortho-
block appears to be the result of HGT events in E.coli and in
Rpatida, where an entire gene block exists in both species, but not
in the closely related ones.

To determine if there is a relationship between gene block conser-
vation and the function of the gene blocks, we assigned each operon

keywords based on its function. The categories we used were
Metabolism, Information, Molecular Complex, Stress Response,
Energy and Environmental Response. The keywords were assigned
based on reading the literature relevant for each operon, and the in-
formation provided in EcoCyc (Keseler et al., 2013). As can be seen
in Figure 4, from the gene blocks we studied, gene blocks whose func-
tion is information or protein complex tend to be more conserved
which agrees with previous studies, and those dealing with stress re-
sponse are less conserved. Gene blocks whose primary function was
identified as metabolism were found at all levels of conservation. We
conclude that there may be a relationship between gene block conser-
vation and function, and that gene blocks having to do with informa-
tion or molecular complexes are more conserved than those dealing
with stress response and/or environmental response. Other studies
have shown similar trends (Dandekar et al., 1998).

5 Discussion and conclusions

We introduce a method to examine gene block and operon evolution
in bacteria. This method, coupled with the phylomatrix visualiza-
tion we introduce, enables the interrogation of the evolution of gene
blocks in a bacterial clade. The event-driven approach we use allows
for the quantification of evolutionary conservation of any gene
block. Most importantly, the event-driven method does not attempt
to present a predictive evolutionary model such as the models

Fig. 4. Relative conservation of operons and their primary biological functions. Each bar shows the cumulative number of events per genome pair per orthoblock.
The orthoblocks are numbered as in Supplementary Table S1. Conserved orthoblocks have shorter bars, operons are ordered top-to-bottom left-to-right from

most conserved to least conserved

reviewed in the introduction. Rather, it allows for these models to
be examined in specific gene blocks with specific taxa. The event—
driven method is agnostic to any model predicting how an operon or
gene block evolved.

To determine the conservation of gene blocks, a choice needs to
be made for the proper orthologs between genomes. Identifying
orthologs is a challenging problem that has been studied extensively.

Several methods have been developed to do so including use of inter—
species clusters (Powell et al., 2014; Remm et al., 2001; Tatusov
et al., 1997), reciprocal best hits (Tatusov et al., 1997) or phylogen—
etic methods (Fulton et al., 2006). Here we used genomic context
and strict similarity criteria to choose which genes are orthologous,
and are likely to have the same function. The ortholog choice
method we use here assumes that evidence for orthology is

strengthened by genomic context. This assumption has been shown
to be useful for a more precise assignment of orthologs (Jun et al.,
2009; Ward and Moreno—Hagelsieb, 2014) and has been imple-
mented in computational resources (Aziz et al., 2008; Overbeek
et al., 2014; Szklarczyk et al., 2014) to resolve ortholog ambiguities.

We choose gene blocks on the basis that, at least in one species
(E.coli), the genes are co—transcribed. The initial motivation for this
study was the observation that orthoblocks have been shown to be
useful in inferring common function, even when co—transcription
has not been determined (Enault et al., 2005; Marcotte et al., 1999;
Nitschke et al., 1998; Overbeek et al., 1999). We have shown that
tracking gene block evolution in bacteria through the tallying of
simple events provides an objective method for quantifying their
evolutionary conservation, relative to a reference species.
Additionally, we have shown detailed examples of two highly con—
served orthoblocks (atp and ydc) and two less—conserved ortho—
blocks (paa and hyf). Finally, we have related overall conservation
to the type of orthoblock function, although a larger survey of
orthoblocks is needed to obtain a more reliable picture.

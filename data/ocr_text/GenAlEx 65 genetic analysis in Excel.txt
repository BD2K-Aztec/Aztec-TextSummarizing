1 INTRODUCTION

GenAlEx 6 was originally developed as a teaching tool to facili-
tate teaching population genetic analysis at the graduate level
(Peakall and Smouse, 2006). GenAlEx operates within
Microsoft Excel—the widely used spreadsheet software that
forms part of the cross-platform Microsoft Ofﬁce suite.
Packaging genetic analysis within a familiar and ﬂexible envir-
onment resulted in quick understanding and effective perform-
ance of population genetic analyses. Taking advantage of the
rich graphical options available within Excel, GenAlEx offers a
wide range of graphical outputs that aid genetic data analysis
and interpretation. GenAlEx is now widely used by university
teachers at both undergraduate and graduate levels around the
world. Moreover, the software has also attracted a large number
of researchers who utilize its unique features. Here we provide an
update on the new features offered in GenAlEx 6.5 that we be-
lieve will be welcomed by students, teachers and researchers.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

GenAlEx offers population genetic analysis of diploid codo-
minant, haploid, haplotypic and binary genetic data from ani-
mals, plants and microorganisms. It accommodates a wide range
of genetic markers, including microsatellites (SSRs), single-
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), ampliﬁed fragment length
polymorphisms and DNA sequences. Both allele frequency-
based and distance-based analysis options are provided. The
former includes estimates of heterozygosity and genetic diversity,
F—statistics, Nei’s genetic distance, population assignment and
relatedness. The latter includes Analysis of Molecular Variance
(AMOVA), Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA), Mantel
tests, TwoGENER, multivariate and 2D spatial autocorrelation.
Readers are referred to Peakall and Smouse (2006) for a more
comprehensive outline of these standard procedures, data for-
mats and data import options.

GenAlEx 6.5 maintains backward compatibility, but it pro-
vides access to the expanded spreadsheet of Excel 2007
onward. Thus, the maximum numbers of loci and samples are
vastly expanded and only constrained by memory. More than 30
different Excel graphs summarize the outcomes of genetic ana-
lyses. Graphics can be further manipulated with Excel options
and easily converted to pdf or other publication-quality formats.

2 NEW FEATURES

2.1 New estimators of population structure

There has been much recent debate about the utility of FST as a
measure of population genetic structure (J 0st, 2008; Ryman and
Leimar, 2009; Whitlock, 2011). GenAlEx 6.5 offers the calcula-
tion of G’ST, G”ST and J ost’s Dest, providing [0,1]-standardized
allele frequency-based estimators of population genetic structure,
following Meirmans and Hedrick (2011), testing the null by
random permutation and estimating variances via jackkniﬁng
and bootstrapping over loci. New AMOVA routines now
enable the estimation of standardized F ’ ST, following
Meirmans (2006). The calculation of these statistics was vali-
dated by comparison with the software GenoDive v2.0b22
(Meirmans and Van Tienderen, 2004).

2.2 Shannon’s information statistics

Shannon information indices have been widely used in ecology
but largely overlooked in genetics despite offering a framework
for quantifying biological diversity across multiple scales (genes
to landscapes). GenAlEx offers the calculation of a series of

Shannon indices, including the mutual information index SHUA,
an alternative estimator of population structure. The methods
follow Sherwin et al. (2006) who assessed the performance of
Shannon indices for estimating genetic diversity. Smouse and
Ward (1978) extend to multiple hierarchical levels, with a
unique three-level partition option and statistical testing by
random permutation offered in GenAlEx 6.5.

2.3 Tools for comparing pairwise population statistics

The Mantel test capability of GenAlEx has been extended to
allow multiple comparison among pairwise population statistics
SUCh as FST, F/ST, G/ST, GHST, Dest and SHUA.   allow
informed comparison of the new estimators of population
structure.

2.4 Heterogeneity testing for spatial autocorrelation

GenAlEx 6.5 introduces novel heterogeneity tests (Smouse et al.,
2008), extending application of the multiallelic, multilocus spatial
autocorrelation analysis methods of Smouse and Peakall (1999),
Peakall et al. (2003) and Double et al. (2005). These new methods
provide valuable insights into ﬁne-scale genetic processes across
a wide range of animals and plants. Banks and Peakall (2012)
have conﬁrmed the statistical power and performance of this
heterogeneity test by spatially explicit computer simulations.

2.5 Linkage disequilibrium tests (LD) for biallelic data

Despite its importance, there is no universal test for disequilib-
rium (Slatkin, 2008). GenAlEx 6.5 offers pairwise tests for dis-
equilibrium between biallelic markers such as SNPs. When phase
is known, this includes the calculation of D, D’, r and r2, follow-
ing Hedrick (2005). Maximum likelihood estimation is used to
calculate D and r when phase is unknown Meir, 1990, p. 310).
The results were validated against GDA (Lewis and Zaykin,
2001). Inclusion of LD ﬁlls an important technical gap, particu-
larly for teachers. For large SNP sets, or multiallelic data,
GenAlEx users are encouraged to take advantage of the options
to export their data to other packages such as Arlequin 3.5
(Excofﬁer and Lischer, 2010).

2.6 New allele frequency format

Retrospective calculation of the new estimators of population
structure such as G’ST, Best and Shannon indices are now pos-
sible from published allele frequency data. Teachers will also ﬁnd
this a helpful option for the re-analysis of textbook examples.

2.7 Import and export options

GenAlEx offers data import from several popular formats and
tools for importing and manipulating raw data from DNA se-
quencers. Export to more than 30 other data formats is provided,
enabling access to myriad other software packages. For example,
direct export is offered to programs such as GENEPOP
(Rousset, 2008) and STRUCTURE (Pritchard et al., 2000),
and via these same formats to many other programs, including
genetic packages in R such as adegenet (J ombart, 2008) and
pegas (Paradis, 2010). The full list of export options, along
with notes on the export process, can found at the website.

3 SPECIAL FEATURES FOR TEACHING

Offering a user-friendly software package for university stu-
dents and teachers remains an ongoing goal of GenAlEx. We
continue to expand the popular step-by-step output options that
allow students to follow the steps in the analytical pathway.
Teaching-speciﬁc menu options are also provided. For example,
the Rand menu allows students to permute and bootstrap hypo-
thetical datasets with color tracking, to aid an understanding of
how these statistical tests work. Finally, we have made freely
available a set of tutorial notes and supporting datasets drawn
from the graduate workshops that we have offered (both jointly
and independently) around the world.

4 DOCUMENTATION

More than 150 pages of documentation are provided. This
includes Appendix 1 that outlines the statistical analyses
used and their supporting references. The revised guide to
GenAlEx 6.5 fully cross-links with the GenAlEx tutorials
and Appendix 1.

5 CONCLUSION

GenAlEx 6.5 offers a wide range of population genetic analysis
options for the full spectrum of genetic markers within the
Microsoft Excel environment on both PC and Macintosh com-
puters. When combined with its user-friendly interface, rich
graphical outputs for data exploration and publication, tools
for data manipulation and export options to many other soft-
ware packages, we believe that GenAlEx offers an ideal launch-
ing pad for population genetic analysis by students, teachers and
researchers alike.

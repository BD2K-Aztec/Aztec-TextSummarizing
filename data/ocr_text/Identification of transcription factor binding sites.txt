ABSTRACT

Motivation: Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to next-gener-
ation sequencing (ChlP-seq) is widely used to study the in vivo binding
sites of transcription factors (T Fs) and their regulatory targets. Recent
improvements to ChIP-seq, such as increased resolution, promise
deeper insights into transcriptional regulation, yet require novel com-
putational tools to fully leverage their advantages.

Results: To this aim, we have developed peakzilla, which can iden-
tify closely spaced TF binding sites at high resolution (i.e. resolves
individual binding sites even if spaced closely), as we demonstrate
using semisynthetic datasets, performing ChIP-seq for the TF Twist
in Drosophila embryos with different experimental fragment sizes, and
analyzing ChIP-exo datasets. We show that the increased resolution
reached by peakzilla is highly relevant, as closely spaced Twist binding
sites are strongly enriched in transcriptional enhancers, suggesting a
signature to discriminate functional from abundant non-functional or
neutral TF binding. Peakzilla is easy to use, as it estimates all the
necessary parameters from the data and is freely available.

1 INTRODUCTION

Gene expression is mainly regulated at the transcriptional level
and achieved through the binding of transcription factors (TFs)
to genomic regulatory regions called promoters and enhancers.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChlP-
seq) is extensively used to determine transcription factor binding
sites (TFBSs) genome-wide (Johnson et al., 2007; Robertson
et al., 2007). Compared with ChIP-chip (Iyer et al., 2001; Ren
et al., 2000), ChIP-seq has dramatically improved the resolution
of the identiﬁed TFBSs (from hundreds to only tens of

nucleotides). A recent reﬁnement of ChIP-seq, the ChIP-exo
method (Rhee and Pugh, 2011), further increases the resolution
of ChIP-seq experiments, theoretically to single nucleotides.

The speciﬁc features and strategies of TF ChIP-seq data ana-
lysis have been well described by several reviews (e.g. Pepke
et al., 2009) and protocols (e.g. Bardet et al., 2012). Brieﬂy, as
typically only one of both ends of the immunoprecipitated DNA
fragments is sequenced, the sequencing reads (or tags) result in a
bimodal distribution that is characteristic for true TFBSs
(Fig. 1a). This distribution is typically used to estimate the aver-
age size of the fragments, which subsequently allows the predic-
tion of TFBSs across the genome.

Many computational tools have been developed and are suc-
cessfully used to predict such binding events ONilbanks and
Facciotti, 2010). However, in our experience, these tools are
not optimized to take advantage of recent methodological im-
provements, which comprise paired-end sequencing, high
sequencing depth (e.g. on Illumina HiSeq systems) and—most
importantly—an increase in experimental resolution, both of
conventional ChIP-seq and of ChIP-exo. Available tools typic-
ally merge closely spaced read-density peaks into large regions,
which is preferable when analyzing certain chromatin features
that mark extended regions (e.g. histone modiﬁcations), but
means that the ability to distinguish (i.e. resolve) individual clo-
sely spaced TFBSs is lost. High resolution and precision [i.e. the
correct prediction of the TFBSs’ exact locations as measured for
example as the distance from the inferred TFBS (the reported
peak summit) to the TF’s sequence motif] are crucial when deter-
mining individual TFBSs (e. g. Guo et al., 2012), as promoter and
enhancer regions often consist of multiple TFBSs for the same
TF (homotypic TFBSs clusters) (Gotea et al., 2010; He et al.,
2011; Lifanov et al., 2003) or different TFs (Berman et al., 2002;
Schroeder et al., 2004). Thus, to fully leverage current ChIP
methodologies toward understanding the structure and function
of enhancers, the ability to determine multiple closely spaced
TFBSs is critical. To meet this need, we developed a new com-
putational tool, peakzilla, which fully exploits the bimodal dis-
tribution of sequence reads characteristic of true TF binding
events, to identify closely adjacent TFBSs with high resolution
and precision. Peakzilla is not meant for the identiﬁcation of
broad enriched regions (e. g. histone marks) for which we recom-
mend using MACS or similar programs.

We evaluate peakzilla by comparing it with three widely used
peak-ﬁnders of the ﬁrst generation such as MACS (Zhang et al.,
2008), QuEST (Valouev et al., 2008) and cisGenome (Ji et al.,
2008), as well as four methods developed more recently for the
detection of high-resolution peaks such as spp (Kharchenko
et al., 2008), SISSRs (Jothi et al., 2008), GPS (Guo et al.,
2010) and PeakRanger (Feng et al., 2011). Peakzilla shows
superior resolution and precision on conventional ChIP-seq
datasets from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Zheng et al., 2010),
Caenorhabditis elegans (Zhong et al., 2010), Drosophila melano-
gaster (He et al., 2011), mouse (Schmidt et al., 2010) and human
(Kasowski et al., 2010; Cuddapah et al., 2009) and on recent
ChIP-exo datasets (Rhee and Pugh, 2011). We also speciﬁcally
test the resolution limits of each method using semisynthetic
ChIP-seq datasets and show experimentally that peakzilla fully

reﬂects increased experimental resolution by performing ChIP-
seq experiments for Twist in Dmelanogaster at normal, medium
and high resolution. These results suggest that peakzilla is best
suited for the identiﬁcation of TFBSs with recent ChIP methods.

2 PEAKZILLA ALGORITHM

Peakzilla uses the bimodal distribution of the reads (Fig. la) not
only to estimate the fragment length but also to weight the read
counts during peak calling and to score the candidate TFBSs.
This has two important advantages: ﬁrst, it enables peakzilla to
more clearly discriminate between reads from adjacent TFBSs,
leading to a substantial increase in resolution compared with
treating reads irrespective of their directionality. Second, it
avoids false positives that originate from artifacts during library

preparation or sequencing, without the need to collapse or down-
weight reads that map to identical genomic positions (Fig. 1b
and Supplementary Fig. S1). This is especially important when
working with high sequence coverage, as obtained for small gen-
omes (e.g. yeast, ﬁies or nematodes) and with modern next gen-
eration sequencers (Chen et al., 2012). Finally, when using
peakzilla on paired-end ChIP-seq data, the estimated fragment
size is directly averaged from the mapped reads.

Peakzilla ﬁrst scans the genome for candidate TFBSs that
show high coverage in sequencing reads of the immunoprecipi-
tated (IP) sample compared with the control sample (note that
the control sample is optional, allowing peakzilla to be used with
ChIP-exo). It then scores the candidates by the normalized read
count of IP sample minus the control sample if available. To
discriminate between artifacts and true binding events in en-
riched regions, each candidate TFBS score is further weighted
by a distribution score that estimates how well the observed dis-
tribution of the reads in the peak region ﬁts to a model for the
bimodal read distribution (Fig. 1c and d). Indeed, further ana-
lyses suggest that candidates who are penalized using this distri-
bution score are likely false because they contain substantially
less diverse sequence reads (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. S2).
Their high read densities stem from only a few highly duplicated
sequences, which are likely ampliﬁcation artifacts, and are sig-
niﬁcantly less enriched in the corresponding TF motif (Fig. If).
The method is illustrated in the method section and in
Supplementary Figure S3.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Overall performance

To evaluate peakzilla, we compared it with other methods using
diverse ChIP-seq datasets from S.cerevisiae, Celegans,
Dmelcmogaster, mouse and human. Although the number of
peaks called by the different methods is highly dependent on
the thresholds and parameters used, the respective genomic
regions overlap well (Supplementary Fig. S4), demonstrating
the maturity of available tools for ‘peak calling’. For example,
all known Twist enhancers are identiﬁed by all methods, except
for four and three enhancers that are not found by QuEST and
GPS, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S5). For most TFs tested,
of all peaks identiﬁed by only one of the methods, those found
exclusively by peakzilla are signiﬁcantly more highly enriched in
TF motif occurrences (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. S6). They
also have higher fold enrichments of ChIP over input than peaks
found exclusively by any of the other methods (Fig. 2b and
Supplementary Fig. S6).

3.2 High precision of peakzilla peaks

When identifying TFBSs at high resolution, the correct predic-
tion of the precise TFBSs’ location is important and critical for
subsequent analyses of sequence features of TF binding. We
found that most methods, including peakzilla, place the summits
of the peak regions closely to the nearest motif occurrence
(Supplementary Fig. S7, which also shows that the fraction of
peaks that contain a motif is comparable across methods),
arguing that the high resolution of peakzilla’s peak (see below)
does not come at the expense of precision.

3.3 Multiple peak regions function as transcriptional
enhancers

The main strength of peakzilla is its ability to ﬁnd peaks at high
resolution. As the locations of sequencing reads that originate
from a single TFBS are limited by the fragment size used for
library preparation, we adjust our search window for counting
and scoring sequence reads accordingly, and report peak regions
as the average fragment size centered on the summit position.
This is different from the large peak regions reported by MACS
and to a lesser extent QuEST, CisGenome and PeakRanger (and
from reporting only the summit positions as do SISSRs and spp;
Fig. 3a), and is one of the key features that allow peakzilla to
resolve closely spaced peaks up to distances that correspond to
half the fragment size. This is the highest resolution that can
easily be obtained without losing the ability to uniquely assign
reads to individual TFBSs. A further gain in resolution would
require the deconvolution of overlapping read distributions by
model ﬁtting, a computationally intensive approach used, for
example, by GPS (Guo et al., 2010).

Peakzilla splits a substantial number of MACS peaks (e.g.
22% for Twist) into several peaks, each constituting a putative
TFBS (Supplementary Fig. S8). Indeed, as expected for
independent TFBSs, both the split peaks that correspond to
the MACS summits (major peaks) and the minor peaks were

Fig. 3. Functionality of multiple peak regions. Analyses performed on the Twist dataset in D.melan0gaster. (a) Example of peak split. Peakzilla detects
three adjacent peaks, while MACS, QuEST, CisGenome and PeakRanger report a single large peak region, and SISSRs and spp report two peak regions
(GPS did not call any peak in that region; we considered all peaks called with standard parameters for each method). (b) Split peaks match motif
occurrences. All peakzilla peaks corresponding to a single MACS peak (major: same summit; minor: additional summit) are more highly enriched in
Twist motifs than control regions, suggesting that they constitute true independent TFBSs. The same is true for motifs of Snail and Dorsal, which are
TFs known to cooperate with Twist. (c) Split peaks are highly conserved. (d) Split peaks are enriched for known enhancers. (e) Split peaks are enriched

for mesodermal enhancers

signiﬁcantly enriched for the Twist motif (Fig. 3b). Thus, many
split MACS peaks may represent homotypic clusters of Twist
binding sites. In addition, minor peaks frequently contained
motifs for the TFs Snail and Dorsal, which are known to co-
operate with Twist and might have been co-precipitated after
cross-linking (Fig. 3b).

Most importantly, MACS peaks split by peakzilla appear to
be more often functional than MACS peaks that are not split
(one-to-one peaks) and control regions (Fig. 3c): TF binding to
split peaks is more highly conserved in other Drosophila species
(He et al., 2011) and they are signiﬁcantly more enriched for
known Twist or mesodermal enhancers than one-to-one peaks
one or controls (Fig.3d and e). This is highly relevant as the large
fraction of TFBS that are identiﬁed by ChIP approaches yet do
not appear to be functioning as transcriptional enhancers (‘neu-
tral binding’ (Li et al., 2008; Kvon et al., 2012)) have been a
major obstacle to studying the direct regulatory targets of TFs
and to understanding the true number and density of enhancers
in animal genomes. All together, these results suggest that peak-
zilla is ideal for identifying regions with multiple binding sites
and that such information is important for detecting functional
enhancers.

3.4 High resolution of peakzilla

The evaluation of TFBS predicted from ChIP-seq data (i.e.
peaks) is complicated by the fact that a ground truth typically
does not exist for experimental ChIP-seq datasets. This is espe-
cially true for the evaluation of peak calls at different resolutions
that predict a single TFBS versus several closely spaced TFBS.
Although the occurrence of TF motifs is a good proxy for inde-
pendent binding events, we sought to demonstrate the validity of
peak splitting more directly by generating semisynthetic datasets
with deﬁned peak-to-peak distances. We found that peakzilla is
still able to separate all peak pairs at 150 bp without calling any
false positives, which is the best resolution compared with all
others methods (Fig. 4).

3.5 Peakzilla leverages increased resolution of ChIP
experiments

To directly demonstrate peakzilla’s ability to make use of
increased experimental ChIP resolution, we performed conven-
tional ChIP-seq for Twist from Drosophila embryos with increas-
ingly smaller fragment sizes. For this, the chromatin was
sonicated into relatively small DNA fragments and then further

Resolution (peak-to-peak distance)

Fig. 4. High resolution of peakzilla. We evaluated the different methods on semisynthetic datasets that contained peak pairs at decreasing peak-to-peak
distances (i.e. resolution). For each method, we determined a true-positive rate (TPR; number of correct peak calls divided by the total number of true
peaks) and FDR (number of false peak calls divided by the number of total peak calls) and indicate the best resolution reached (in base pairs below each

method’s name)

trimmed by DNase I digestion before ChIP (see ‘Methods’ sec-
tion). This yielded three ChIP datasets with estimated fragment
sizes of 102, 72 and 49 bp, from which we called peaks with the
different peak ﬁnders (Fig. 5a). We expected that with decreasing
fragment sizes, the width of the identiﬁed peaks should decrease
and the resolution, i.e. the ability to resolve closely spaced bind-
ing sites, should increase. Indeed, the peak regions reported by
peakzilla, but not those reported by most other methods, showed
decreased width with decreasing fragment sizes (Fig. 5a). More
importantly, the resolution, as measured by the minimal peak-
to-peak distance (after removing 1% outliers), increased with
decreasing fragment sizes for peakzilla, but not for other meth-
ods (Fig. 5b). SISSRs, GPS and peakzilla performed well on the
small-fragment sample, with peakzilla reaching the highest reso-
lution of all methods. These results demonstrate that the max-
imum beneﬁt of experimental methods with higher resolution
can only be obtained when used together with high-resolution
computational methods such as peakzilla.

3.6 Peakzilla as a peak caller for ChIP-exo data

The recently developed ChIP-exo method adds a lamda exo-
nuclease digestion step after ChIP, which trims the 5’ DNA
strand until the cross-linked TFBS (Rhee and Pugh, 2011).
This digestion end point can be mapped to the genome using
the remaining single-stranded overhang. Because each TFBS can
be mapped from both sides, the resulting distribution of mapped
breakpoints is also bimodal and resembles that of conventional
ChIP-seq, with the ‘fragment sizes’ corresponding directly to the
actual sizes of the TF footprints. To our knowledge, no compu-
tational method has been speciﬁcally developed for the analysis
of ChIP-exo data.

We therefore assessed how well peakzilla and other methods
perform on ChIP-exo datasets. We called human CTCF binding
sites from published ChIP-seq data (Cuddapah et al., 2009) and
ChIP-exo data (Rhee and Pugh, 2011). Peakzilla reported esti-
mated fragment sizes of 98 bp for ChIP-seq and 36 bp for
ChIP-exo (Fig. 5c) and had the highest resolution (smallest
peak-to-peak distance) among all methods tested (Fig. 5d).

This suggests that peakzilla is well suited for high-resolution
ChIP-seq data, including ChIP-exo.

4 DISCUSSION

Understanding how combinations of TFs bind to DNA to regu-
late gene expression is one of the most pressing questions of
today’s biology. Its importance is witnessed by recent community
efforts that aim to determine all functional elements in the gen-
omes of model organisms and the human [e.g. ENCODE
(ENCODE Project Consortium, 2004), modENCODE
(Celniker et al., 2009), Mouse ENCODE (Mouse ENCODE
Consortium et al., 2012)]. The availability of high-throughput
sequencing at low cost widely promoted the use of the ChIP-
seq methodology and an enormous number of datasets for dif-
ferent TFs from various species, developmental stages or tissues
are becoming available. This enables the identiﬁcation of in viva
binding sites and thus enhancers that contain multiple binding
sites for a single TF or multiple different TFs. While it is widely
accepted that enhancers are characterized by clusters of TF bind-
ing motifs (Berman et al., 2002; Schroeder et al., 2004), it has
remained less clear to what extent each of several clustered TF
binding motifs is bound in vivo (Yaﬁez-Cuna et al., 2012).
Similarly, potential constraints on the relative distance or orien-
tation of co-bound TFs have remained unclear, yet might be
crucial to understand the molecular mechanisms and to decipher
the sequence basis of gene regulation (Yaﬁez-Cuna et al., 2013).

To experimentally address this question, it is important to re-
solve closely spaced binding sites and precisely predict their lo-
cation from ChIP-seq data, challenges that current
improvements to the ChIP methodology have started to address
[e.g. ChIP-exo (Rhee and Pugh, 2011)]. However, while many
computational tools exist to identify enriched regions (peaks)
from ChIP data (‘peak calling’), many of them are not designed
to fully leverage these improvements, e.g. the increased reso-
lution or the vastly increased number of deep sequencing reads
of modern deep sequencing (Chen et al., 2012). To meet these
challenges, especially the need for discovering TFBSs at high

(blue) peaks for Twist (best 1000 peaks of each method). SISSRs, spp and GPS are not shown, as they do not report peak regions but only summit

methods calculated as in (b)

resolution, we have developed a new computational method,
peakzilla.

The importance of high resolution and precision is also sup-
ported by alternative efforts to correctly position predicted
TFBSs, for example, by taking the location of enriched sequence
motifs into account (Boeva et al., 2010; Guo et al., 2012; Wu
et al., 2010). Although TFBSs predicted by peakzilla coincide
well with the known sequence motifs of the respective TFs, it
is important to note that we chose to predict the TFBS locations
from the ChIP-seq data alone, without taking sequence motifs
into account: it is well established that within TFBSs, motifs for
different TFs can be more highly enriched in TFBSs than motifs
for the precipitated TF itself. For example, the binding sites of
most TFs in the early Drosophila embryo are highly enriched in
motifs for the TF Zelda (Bradley et al., 2010; Li et al., 2008;
Kvon et al., 2012; modENCODE Consortium et al., 2010;
Satija and Bradley, 2012; Yaﬁez-Cuna et al., 2012), such that
the Zelda motif—which is sometimes more highly enriched than
the motif of the TF of interest—might bias the correct prediction
of the TFBSs and possibly hinder the study of relative position-
ing and orientation of TFBSs.

The combination of maximum experimental resolution and a
peak caller like peakzilla thus makes full use of recent ChIP-seq
approaches and will be invaluable for testing hypotheses on how

combinatorial TF binding realizes the developmental blueprint
encoded in the regulatory regions of our genomes. Indeed, clo-
sely spaced Twist binding sites resolved by peakzilla coincided
and were strongly enriched in known enhancers, corroborating
the prevalent model that functional enhancers are characterized
by clusters of TFBSs. The increasing number of ChIP studies
that determine the in vivo binding sites of TFs at high resolution
will prove invaluable for our understanding of enhancer function
and transcriptional regulation.

5 METHODS

5.1 Peakzilla algorithm

Initially, peakzilla reads the coordinate ﬁles of the mapped reads of the IP
and—optionally—control sample. These can stem from either single-end
(BED format) or paired-end (BEDPE format) deep sequencing data.
Peakzilla then ﬁrst determines the average fragment size of the sequen-
cing library to determine the peak size that should result from a true
TFBS. For paired-end data, this corresponds directly to the average frag-
ment size (i.e. the average distance of the two mapped ends of each
fragment). For single-end data, the average fragment size is estimated
from the shift size of positive and negative reads in the top 200 enriched
regions in the ChIP sample as described before. Peakzilla then deﬁnes
peak size as two times the fragment size, as all reads from the ends of

Peak calling at high resolution

 

fragments immunoprecipitated due to a single TFBS will on average lie in
this region.

In a second step, the distribution of positive and negative strand reads
that are to be expected is modeled. By default, two normal distributions
are used with standard deviations stdev=peak size/5 and locations of
their means at one-fourth and three-fourth of the peak size, respectively.
Alternatively, the user can choose to estimate the model empirically from
the average distribution of reads within the top 200 candidate peaks in the
ChIP.

To call TFBSs, peakzilla ﬁrst scans the genome counting reads within
a ‘double-window’: each putative (candidate) TFBS receives the counts of
positive strand reads within a window of the fragment size downstream of
the candidate TFBS and the negative strand reads within an equivalent
window upstream of the candidate TFBS. This scores all candidates with
a raw score deﬁned as the normalized read count in the IP sample (nor-
malized to a library size of 1 million reads) minus the normalized read
count in the control (i.e. input) sample (note that the correction with a
control sample is optional). Final peaks are the candidates with summits
that are local maxima at least one fragment length (half peak size) apart
from each other. This scanning mode allows for both fast and compre-
hensive investigation of large genomes at single base resolution.

To obtain a ﬁnal peak score, each raw score is corrected with a multi-
plicative distribution score [0...1] that assesses the ﬁt of the observed
read count distribution to the distribution expected from the model
(see above). This ﬁt is assessed by a chi-square test and the chi-square
P—value becomes the distribution score, which provides a measure of how
likely the candidate peak is a true TFBS (distribution score: 1) or the
result of a sequencing artifact (distribution score: 0). Note that to robustly
estimate the average fragment size we only count distinct reads, i.e.
remove duplicates (before model building). For peak calling, however,
we did not remove duplicates but use the model to penalize polymerase
chain reaction duplicates. This strategy is more sensitive for datasets on
small genomes or with high coverage (see main text).

If a control sample is provided, an empirical false discovery rate
(FDR) is calculated for each peak by repeating the peak-calling step
(after fragment size estimation) with swapped IP and control sample
and scoring the resulting control peaks by the raw and distribution
score. This provides for each ﬁnal peak score the number of true and
control peaks that achieve this score or better and thus an FDR estimate.

Peakzilla reports the TFBSs in a BED-like format including the gen-
omic positions, raw, distribution and ﬁnal score, FDR and a peak
number according to each peak’s rank. In addition, the control peaks
and a log are reported.

The method is illustrated in a ﬂowchart in Supplementary Figure S3.

Peakzilla can be downloaded from http://github.com/steinmann/peak-
zilla or http://www.starklab.org/data/peakzilla/

5.2 Program implementation

Peakzilla is implemented in Python 2 and runs on both the standard
CPython and the fast PyPy interpreter. The program is freely available
under the terms of the General Public License at http://github.com/stein-
mann/peakzilla. It runs from the command line under any Linux distri-
bution or OSX. The only required argument is the name of the ﬁle with
the aligned reads from the ChIP sample and—optionally—from the control
sample (both BED format). In addition, the following parameters can be
used: —m to specify the number of candidate binding sites to use to
estimate fragment size (default: 200); —l to limit the candidate regions
to lengths above a certain minimum length (which may be necessary if the
dataset contains a large number of strong polymerase chain reaction
artifacts; default: off [1]); —f to set a FDR cutoff (default: off [100]);
—c to set an enrichment cutoff (default: 2); —s to set a score cutoff (de-
fault: 1); —l to specify logﬁle (default: log.txt); —e to use an empirical
estimate derived from the data for the model instead of a normal distri-
bution (default: 011); —p to specify that the data corresponds to fragments

sequenced at both ends (paired-end sequencing; default: 011). For a
human ChIP-seq dataset with 19.7 million reads and 7.8 in the control
peakzilla runs in 4 min and consumes <800 MB of memory under
CPython. Using the faster PyPy interpreter reduces time needed for ana-
lysis and memory requirements by half. Peakzilla can therefore be run
efﬁciently on any modern desktop computer.

5.3 ChIP-seq datasets

Raw sequencing reads for Twist in Dmelanogaster (He at al., 2011)
(ArrayExpress accession code E-MTAB-376), CEBPA in Mus musculus
(Schmidt et al., 2010) (GEO accession code GSE22078) and PHA-4 in
C.elegans (Zhong et al., 2010) (GEO accession code GSE14545) were
aligned uniquely using bowtie allowing for three mismatches to the cor-
responding genomes (assemblies dm3, mm9 and ce6, respectively). For
NFkB in Homo sapiens (Kasowski et al., 2010) (GEO accession code
GSE19486), Ste12 in S.cerevisiae (Zheng et al., 2010) (GEO accession
code GSE19636) and CTCF ChIP-seq (Cuddapah et al., 2009) (GEO
accession code GSE12889) and ChIP-exo (Rhee and Pugh, 2011)
(which the authors kindly shared) in H.sapiens, already mapped reads
were used (assemblies hg18, sarCer2 and hg18, respectively).

5.4 Semisynthetic datasets

We generated semisynthetic control (input) and ChIP samples by sub-
sampling input samples and ChIP peaks: we generated two 30 million bp
artiﬁcial chromosomes by repeatedly randomly subsampling an arbitrar-
ily selected region from the Twist input sample that showed no strong
enrichment, one as a semisynthetic input control and the second as a
ChIP background. We next selected several highly ranking peaks from
the Twist ChIP sample that were found by all methods, had no other
peak nearby and showed a regular fragment density distribution. We
subsampled them to yield peaks with an enrichment of 5-fold or higher
over background and placed such peaks as pairs with deﬁned peak-to-
peak distances into the background every 30 000 bp for 1000 peak-pairs.
For each distance between the semisynthetic peak-pairs, we combined the
semisynthetic chromosome with the experimental ChIP data for peak
calling of the combined set (i.e. parameters are estimated primarily on
the experimental dataset as it contains higher peaks).

5.5 High-resolution ChIP-seq

Embryos aged 2—4h after egg laying were processed and immunopreci-
pitated with Twist antibodies based on the protocol by He et al. (2011)
with slight modiﬁcations. Sonication occurs in three microfuges, each
with ~80 mg chromatin extracts resuspended in 250 ul A2 buffer, in a
Biorupter sonicator for 15min on high (30s on and off) at 4°C. After
15min cooling, the sonication step is repeated, followed by high-speed
centrifugation at 4°C for 10min and pooling of the supernatant (the
DNA fragments should be mostly between 200—500 bp). Six hundred
microliters of supernatant are then incubated with 120 pl of DNAse I
(RNAse-free from NEB, to 0.3 U/ul ﬁnal concentration) and 80111 of
DNAse I buffer for 30 min at 37°C. To stop DNAse I activity, A2
buffer with 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate is added to a give a ﬁnal con-
centration of 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate. The extract is then directly used
for ChIP (the DNA fragments should now be mostly between 50 and
200 bp). During Illumina library preparation, the samples are run on a
2% gel at 90V for ~2 h, and fragments corresponding to ~50, ~75 and
~100 bp inserts are cut out of the gel (slices are ~25 bp thick). The ﬁnal
libraries are run a BioAnalyzer to measure the actual average insert size.
The high-resolution ChIP-seq data for Twist is deposited on GEO under
the accession code GSE40664.

5.6 Peak calling

The format of the mapped reads was adapted to each method. Peakzilla,
SISSRs (J othi et al., 2008) version 1.4, cisGenome (Ji et al., 2008) version
2.0, Spp (Kharchenko et al., 2011) version 1.8 and GPS (Guo et al., 2010)
version 0.10.1 were run with default parameters. MACS (Zhang et al.,
2008) version 1.4.1 was run with an mfold parameter 3,30 and the gsize
parameter was adapted for each genome. QuEST (V alouev et al., 2008)
version 2.4 was run with the following interactive choices: TFBSs with
recommended (or relaxed) peak calling parameters. PeakRanger (Feng
et al., 2011) read extension length parameter was run using peakzilla’s
estimated fragment length. Both QuEST and PeakRanger could not be
used for the CTCF samples without a control dataset.

5.7 Functional analyses

We used the known motif CACATGT for Twist and the motifs from
JASPAR (Sandelin et al., 2004): snail (sna MA0086.1), dorsal (dl_1
MA0022.1), NFkB (NFKBl MA0105.1), CEBPA (CEBPA MA0102.2),
pha-4 (Foxa2 MA0047.1), Ste12 (STE12 MA0393.1). We searched for
motif de novo using MEME (Bailey and Gribskov, 1998) within 31 bp
around peak summits and for occurrences of the known motifs using
MAST (Bailey and Gribskov, 1998) (from the MEME suite programs
version 4.1.1) with a P—value of 10‘3 (10‘2 for Twist, which corresponds
to allowing for one mismatch) in an area of 151 bp (average genomic frag-
ment length) around each peak summit. We called a peak conserved when
it overlapped with a peak region in all other Drosophila species from He
at al. (2011) (Drosophila simulans, Drosophila yakuba, Drosophila erecta,
Drosophila ananassae and Drosophila pseudaabscura). We overlap peaks
with known Twist enhancers from He et al. (2011) and the known meso-
dermal enhancers from Bonn et al. (2012) (only M for mesoderm at stage 5,
6 and 7). To create a set of control peaks, we shufﬂed peaks randomly
within the same chromosomes.

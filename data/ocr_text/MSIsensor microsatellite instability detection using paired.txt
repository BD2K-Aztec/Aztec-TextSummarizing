ABSTRACT

Motivation: Microsatellite instability (MSI) is an important indicator of
larger genome instability and has been linked to many genetic dis-
eases, including Lynch syndrome. MSI status is also an independent
prognostic factor for favorable survival in multiple cancer types, such
as colorectal and endometrial. It also informs the choice of chemother-
apeutic agents. However, the current PCR—electrophoresis—based de-
tection procedure is laborious and time-consuming, often requiring
visual inspection to categorize samples. We developed MSIsensor, a
C++ program for automatically detecting somatic microsatellite
changes. It computes length distributions of microsatellites per site
in paired tumor and normal sequence data, subsequently using
these to statistically compare observed distributions in both samples.
Comprehensive testing indicates MSIsensor is an efficient and effect-
ive tool for deriving MSI status from standard tumor-normal paired
sequence data.

1 INTRODUCTION

Microsatellites are repetitive sequences with unit length varying
from 1—6 bp. During DNA replication, those repetitive sequences
may expand or shrink due to strand slippage (Kawai et al., 1998).
Those errors are often recognized and repaired by the DNA
mismatch repair machinery, which includes genes such as
MLH1 and MSH2 (Prolla et al., 1994). However, when mis-
match repair enzymes are defective, replication errors will
evade repair and will persist in somatic cells, as occurs in patients
with hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer, also known as
Lynch syndrome Wasen et al., 1999).

Levels of microsatellite instability (MSI) are traditionally
determined experimentally. The sizes of microsatellite marker
sets in tumor DNA are compared via electrophoresis with cor-
responding DNA isolated from a normal tissue sample of the

same patient. The most widely used set of markers was recom-
mended by a National Cancer Institute consensus group and
consists of either ﬁve or seven repeat markers Wasen et al.,
1999). Samples are normally classiﬁed as microsatellite instability
high (MSI-H), microsatellite instability low (MSI-L) and micro-
satellite stable (MSS).

Although the experimental approach is considered the gold
standard, its detection procedure is expensive and its scope is
limited to only a small subset of microsatellites. Conversely,
paired tumor-normal genome sequencing allows for comprehen-
sive investigation of MSI sites simultaneously and will likely
become a routine part of diagnosis and treatment procedures.
Recently, it was reported that MSI status can be derived from
RNA-seq data (Lu et al., 2013), but no stand-alone pipeline is
provided in that study. Here, we describe MSIsensor, a software
tool that quantiﬁes MSI in paired tumor-normal genome sequen-
cing data and reports somatic status of corresponding microsat-
ellite sites in the human genome.

2 METHODS
2.1 Approach

2.1.] Cataloging of sites in the reference genome MSIsensor starts
with scanning a given reference genome for the locations of homopoly-
mers and microsatellites. By default, it records homopolymers of at least
5—bp length and microsatellites of maximum repeat unit length 5 from the
reference genome. The location and ﬂanking sequences of each site are
saved to a loci ﬁle for the subsequent analysis. This ﬁle can be used for
additional samples as long as the reference remains unchanged.

2.1.2 Generation of null and candidate distributions for hypothesis
testing For each microsatellite site examined in 2.1.1, all read pairs
having at least one read mapped within 2kb of the site are extracted
from both tumor and normal Binary Sequence Alignment/Map format
(BAM) ﬁles. The histogram of read counts for a set of k-mer alleles is
then constructed in a two-step process. First, a dictionary is created by
concatenating the ﬂanking sequences to all possible repeat lengths in the
range 0 to L—lO, where L is read length. Then, observed instances for each
entry are tallied over the set of sequencing reads associated with this site.
For example, when a homopolymer (10 As, ‘A’ as the repeat unit) has
ﬂanking sequences ACGAT and CCGAC, the process will tally k-mers of
ACGATCCGAC (repeat length 0), ACGATACCGAC (repeat length 1),
ACGATﬁCCGAC (repeat length 2), ACGATAAACCGAC (repeat
length 3) and so forth. Tallies are recorded separately in both tumor
and normal data. This process furnishes candidate and null distributions
for tumor and normal, respectively, for each site.

from MSS (microsatellite stable) ones. The x-axis is clinical classiﬁcation
of MSI and MSS. The y-axis is the percentage of microsatellite sites with

2.1.3 Goodness-of-fit test for somatic calling A standard x2 test is
performed at each site having at least 20 reads in both the tumor and
normal samples to assess the goodness-of—ﬁt between their respective
k-mer distributions (Sokal and Rohlf, 2012). A site is tagged as somatic
if distributions are signiﬁcantly different, as quantiﬁed by standard mul-
tiple testing correction of x2 P-values (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995).
MSIsensor speciﬁes a default false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of
0.05, but this is user conﬁgurable.

2.1.4 Quantification of MSI For each sample, we note the total
number of sites with sufﬁcient data (at least 20 spanning reads in both
normal and tumor) and also the number of somatic sites. The percentage
of somatic sites is the score for MSI.

2.2 Test dataset

A cohort of 242 endometrial exome-sequenced cases was used to test the
performance of MSIsensor. Of these, 85 had been designated as MSI
based on experimental measurement (The Cancer Genome Atlas
Research Network, 2013).

3 RESULTS

3.1 Runtime and memory

MSIsensor is implemented in C++ and was applied to The
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) endometrial exome sequence
data from 242 tumor-normal pairs. Each pair requires roughly

660 MB of memory and 30min of compute time on a Dell
PowerEdgeTM Blade with Ubuntu OS and with Intel® Xeon®
CPU E5420 2.50 GHz with four threads for parallel computing.

3.2 Correlation with experimental measure

As shown in Figure l, MSIsensor’s score correlates well with the
experimental measurements of MSI in 242 endometrial tumor-
normal pairs (Pearson coefﬁcient 0.79). We consider one sample
as MSI if both ﬁve and seven markers indicate positive.
Otherwise it is MSS. Among 71 MSI samples, 70 have an MSI
score >3.5. In addition, 165 of 168 MSS samples have a score
<3.5. Of those three special cases, one is classiﬁed as MSI-H by
ﬁve marks and MSI-L by seven markers, whereas the other two
are MSI-L by both sets of markers (Supplementary Table S1).

4 CONCLUSION

MSIsensor is an efﬁcient and effective software tool for deriving
MSI status from tumor-normal paired genome sequencing data.
We will apply it to TCGA data for MSI screening and anticipate
a wider usage of this tool in cancer clinical sequencing.

ABSTRACT

Summary: A large number of proteins function as homo-oligomers;
therefore, predicting homo-oligomeric structure of proteins is of pri-
mary importance for understanding protein function at the molecular
level. Here, we introduce a web server for prediction of protein
homo-oligomer structure. The server takes a protein monomer struc-
ture as input and predicts its homo-oligomer structure from oligomer
templates selected based on sequence and tertiary/quaternary struc-
ture similarity. Using protein model structures as input, the server
shows clear improvement over the best methods of CASP9 in predict-
ing oligomeric structures from amino acid sequences.

1 INTRODUCTION

Many proteins self-assemble into oligomers to perform their bio-
logical functions (Poupon and Janin, 2010). For example, certain
enzymes form substrate-binding pockets at their dimer interfaces
(Snijder et al., 1999), whereas antibodies form oligomers to
create additional binding sites, increasing effective binding affin-
ity via a ‘multivalent effect’ (Pluckthun and Pack, 1997). Many
membrane proteins also form oligomers for effective signal trans-
duction (Heldin, 1995). Knowledge of the protein oligomeric
state is therefore crucial for understanding protein function at
the molecular level.

In the case of experimental protein structures deposited in the
Protein Data Bank (PDB), oligomeric states may be annotated
by the authors or can be assigned from crystallographic infor-
mation through the Protein Interfaces, Surfaces and Assembly
(PISA) database (Krissinel and Henrick, 2007). When such
information is not available, e.g. for protein model structures,
prediction of the oligomeric state is required. Recent studies
have suggested that homology-based homo-oligomer prediction
methods can be more powerful than ab initio methods (Morita
et al., 2012).

Methods for prediction of protein oligomeric structures were
assessed in a blind fashion for the first time in the 9th Critical
Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction (CASP9; Mariani
et al., 2011). In this experiment, participants were asked to pre-
dict homo-oligomer structures from amino acid sequences.
Surprisingly, no method performed better than na'ive predictors
that take the top-ranking protein by HHsearch (Soding, 2005)
as a template, implying that the current methods for prediction
of oligomeric structures are ineffective, with substantial room for
improvement.

In this context, we introduce a new web server GalaxyGemini
for predicting protein homo-oligomer structure, which shows
clear improvement over nai've predictors on two test sets.

2 METHODS
2.1 Oligomer database and test sets

We constructed a database of known homo-oligomer structures contain-
ing 22 233 proteins with mutual sequence identity <70°/o from all the
structures deposited in the PDB (April 10, 2010). Oligomer templates are
selected from this database. For each crystal structure, the oligomeric
state was assigned as the biological unit determined by authors if
“REMARK 350’ in PDB was available and assigned by PISA otherwise.
When PISA predicted multiple oligomeric states, the top oligomeric state
was used, instead of being removed from the database, to increase the
coverage of the database. According to the previous benchmark results,
PISA assignments can be regarded reliable with a success rate of
80~90°/o. For protein structures solved by NMR, the oligomeric states
were deﬁned as the assembled chain structures in the PDB entry.

The database was generated before CASP9 experiment, so the current
test results on the CASP9 set (96 proteins containing 43 monomers;
Mariani et al., 2011) can be fairly compared with CASP9 predictors
including Naive predictors. For parameter training on the PISA bench-
mark set (195 proteins containing 55 monomers; Ponstingl et al., 2003),
target proteins were removed from the oligomer template lists.

2.2 Oligomer structure prediction

For a given input protein, HHsearch is ﬁrst run on the oligomer database.
Whether the query protein is oligomeric or not is then predicted by a
scoring function Sl. If the top-ranking protein is monomeric, the query
protein is predicted to be monomeric. Otherwise, an oligomer template
is selected by ranking with a second function 52. Prediction of the oligo-
meric state corresponding to each template is obtained by superimposing
the input monomer structure onto the subunits of the oligomer tem-
plate using the structure alignment tool TM-align (Zhang and
Skolnick, 2005). Finally, rigid-body energy minimization is performed
to remove steric clashes at the oligomer interface as explained in
Supplementary Information.

The two scoring functions S1 and S2 are expressed as the weighted
sums of Z-scores of ﬁve components. The ﬁrst four components are
derived from HHsearch: (i) HHsearch sequence score, (ii) HHsearch sec-
ondary structure score, (iii) ratio of aligned residues to the query sequence
length and (iv) ratio of aligned residues to the sequence length of template
candidate in the HHsearch alignment. These components account for
sequence similarity to the query protein. The ﬁfth component, called
interface alignment score, accounts for tertiary and quaternary structure
similarity by adding BLOSUM62 matrix scores (Henikoff and Henikoff,
1992) between the interface residues of template candidate and the resi-
dues of the query protein aligned to them. Addition of this component is
important because interface residues are more conserved than other sur-
face residues (Caffrey, 2004). The weight parameters for the two scoring
functions were determined by training on the PISA benchmark set with a
grid search. Details on scoring functions and cross-validation results are
described in Supplementary Information.

3 RESULTS

Identiﬁcation of the correct number of subunits in an oligomer
was evaluated by measuring the ‘relative accuracy’. For more
precise evaluation of the predicted structure, the ‘contact agree-
ment score’ (Sagree) was measured, which reﬂects the fraction
of correctly modeled interface contacts in the complex. Both
measures were used in the CASP9 assessment and explained in
Supplementary Information.

GalaxyGemini increased relative accuracy from 75.4% (for the
naive predictor NaiveSechore that takes the HHsearch top

Fig. 1. Comparison of the performance of GalaxyGemini as measured by
(a) relative accuracy and (b) sum of Sagree for the CASP9 set with those of
CASP9 predictors and three naive methods, which take the HHsearch top
ranker by sequence score (NaiveSechore), sequence identity
(N aiveSquD) and coverage (NaiveCoverage). Target-based comparison
of Sagree with naive predictors (c) NaiveSechore and (d) NaiveCoverage
are also shown for the CASP9 set using the model structure obtained by
GalaxyTBM (Ko et al., 2012) as input

ranker by sequence score) to 79.5% for the training set (PISA
benchmark set) and from 69.8% to 77.1% for the test set
(CASP9 set) (Fig. la). The sum of Sagree over the targets
increased from 74.7 to 88.0 for the training set and from 13.6
to 17.6 for the test set when ‘experimental’ monomer structures
were used as input (Supplementary Fig. S1). When tertiary struc-
tures predicted by GalaxyTBM (Ko et al., 2012) were used as
input for the CASP9 set, the sum of Sagree increased from 9.4
to 12.1 (Fig. lb—d for target-based comparison). GalaxyGemini
outperforms all other CASP9 predictors including na'r've pre-
dictors by the two measures, implying that GalaxyGemini may
be successfully applied to ‘sequence-based’ oligomeric structure
prediction.

A successful example of CASP9 target T0576 (3na2) highlights
the strength of GalaxyGemini (Supplementary Fig. S2). This
protein forms a dimer through an inter-chain ,8—sheet. The best
template determined by the NaiveSechore (2grg) is monomeric,
but GalaxyGemini successfully selects a dimer template (3fm2),
which has an oligomer structure similar to the native structure,
resulting in a high Sagree of 0.742.

4 WEB SERVER

On the input page of GalaxyGemini, a user may enter e-mail
address (optional) and upload a protein monomer structure in
the PDB format. On completion of the job, a result page is
generated and a link is sent via e-mail if the address is provided.
The three best models can be downloaded, and information on
the number of subunits and selected oligomer templates can
be viewed on the result page. The average run time is ~30 min
without energy minimization of the ﬁnal models (default) and
~l h with minimization.

5 CONCLUSIONS

A new web server GalaxyGemini predicts homo-oligomeric state
of a protein from a monomer structure. The method outperforms
other prediction methods tested in CASP9, implying wider
applicability to oligomer state prediction from sequence.

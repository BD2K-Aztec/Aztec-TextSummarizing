ABSTRACT

Summary: Frameshift (FS) prediction is important for analysis and
biological interpretation of metagenomic sequences. Since a genomic
context of a short metagenomic sequence is rarely known, there is not
enough data available to estimate parameters of species-specific stat-
istical models of protein-coding and non-coding regions. The chal-
lenge of ab initio FS detection is, therefore, two fold: (i) to find a way
to infer necessary model parameters and (ii) to identify positions of
frameshifts (if any). Here we describe a new tool, MetaGeneTack,
which uses a heuristic method to estimate parameters of sequence
models used in the FS detection algorithm. It is shown on multiple test
sets that the MetaGeneTack FS detection performance is comparable
or better than the one of earlier developed program FragGeneScan.

1 INTRODUCTION

Metagenomic sequences are obtained from environmental micro-
bial communities. The short sequences are usually sequenced
using next generation sequencing (NGS) platforms such as
Roche 454 and Illumina or traditional Sanger sequencing.
Each platform produces reads of different lengths and has dif-
ferent error models. 454 sequencing platforms produce reads of
~450 nt; errors are usually insertions and deletions (indels) in
homopolymer regions. Illumina platform currently generates se-
quences of length ~150 nt with substitutions constituting almost
all errors. Sanger sequencing produces reads that may contain
both types of errors, and the read length is ~900 nt. Before gene
calling, quality control methods are used to reduce errors on raw
reads (e.g. trimming the error-prone 20—25 nt in Illumina 3’ read
ends). Short reads are assembled into longer (shotgun) sequences
and contigs. In assembled sequences, the per-nucleotide error
rate can be reduced from 0.5% in raw reads to as low as

0.005%. Still, errors may affect ~3% to ~4.5% of genes in
assembled sequences (Luo et al., 2012). Even several thousand
nucleotides long metagenomic sequences do not carry enough
sequence data to accurately estimate parameters of statistical
models for protein-coding and non-coding regions. Moreover,
the performance of conventional tools of gene prediction and
annotation are impaired by indels in protein-coding regions
(Hoff, 2009). On the other hand, tools of comparative genomics
that have certain power in detection of frameshifts interrupting
evolutionary conserved regions rely entirely on comparison with
sequences from existing databases; these tools would not help to
analyse novel genes and genes having low similarity with known
genes (Kunin et al., 2008).

Previously we have developed an algorithm and software pro-
gram GeneTack (Antonov et al., 2010), an ab initio tool for
ﬁnding frameshifts in prokaryotic genomes. Since GeneTack re-
quires a species-speciﬁc statistical model, it cannot work with
sequences shorter than several hundred kilobases. The long
enough sequence is necessary for self-training of GeneMarkS
(Besemer et al., 2001), the gene ﬁnder providing model param-
eters and gene predictions to GeneTack. Here we introduce an ab
initio frameshift ﬁnder, MetaGeneTack, designed for metage-
nomic sequences. MetaGeneTack uses a heuristic method
(Besemer et al., 1999) to infer model parameters suitable for
analysis of a short sequence at hand (e. g. 400 nt). A recently
developed ab initio gene ﬁnder, FragGeneScan (Rho et al.,
2010), is also able to detect frameshifts in short sequences. We
have assessed the performance of MetaGeneTack in tests on
short sequences from 18 prokaryotic species. We have shown
that MetaGeneTack performs comparably or better in frameshift
detection than F ragGeneScan.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

The idea of the heuristic method for building models of protein-coding
regions is that frequencies of oligonucleotides, if cannot be derived dir-
ectly owing to insufﬁcient sequence length, can be inferred as functions of
the sequence GC content. Thus, the oligonucleotide frequencies could be
reconstructed as soon as we compute GC content of the short sequence
that may serve as an estimate of GC content of the genome the sequence
originated from. MetaGeneTack uses the ﬁfth-order polynomial approxi-
mations of dependencies of hexamer frequencies on genome GC content
derived from data on 582 annotated prokaryotic genomes (for details see
Zhu et al., 2010).

Meta GeneTack

 

Heuristic method is used in two major steps of the MetaGeneTack
pipeline. At the ﬁrst step the pipeline is running MetaGeneMark (Zhu
et al., 2010), an ab initio gene ﬁnder using the heuristic method in the
algorithm of analysis of short metagenomic sequences. This step identiﬁes
an initial set of protein-coding genes and selects a corresponding heuris-
tic model (of bacterial or archaeal type of a particular GC content) for
each sequence. The input sequence is then split into fragments where pre-
dicted genes are located in the same strand. The fragments assigned to the
same model are grouped together. At the second step, the selected heuristic
models are used in GeneTack for FS prediction in the grouped fragments.

To reduce the number of false positives, MetaGeneTack uses three
post-processing ﬁlters for the initial FS predictions. Filter I rational is
as follows. In a frameshifted gene with two overlapping protein-coding
open reading frames (ORFs), the downstream ORF should not possess a
functional ribosomal binding site (RBS). Therefore, if a gene predicted in
the downstream ORF has a high RBS score (>2.0), the FS prediction is
ﬁltered out. Filter II is based on the following observation: in high GC
genomes, true FS is separated by a rather long distance from a stop
codon terminating the upstream ORF. Therefore, a predicted FS situated
on a short distance from the stop codon (D(0) <0.80 — 40, with 0 desig-
nating GC content in percentage scale) is ﬁltered out. Filter III works as
follows: if an FS is predicted too close (<50 nt) to a border of the putative
frameshifted gene or to 3’ or 5’ end of the sequence fragment, such FS
prediction is ﬁltered out. Filters II and III are applied to fragments with
high GC content (0 > 50) and low GC content (0 5 50), respectively. As a
training set for assignment of the ﬁlters’ parameters, we used genomic
sequences of Escherichia coli. To produce the program output, the ﬁnal
set of FS predictions is mapped back to the initial metagenomic sequences
and combined with gene predictions of MetaGeneMark, thus producing
the full list of genes with or without frameshifts.

To evaluate the accuracy of FS detection, we generated multiple test
sets accounting for different sequence lengths and error models. To simu-
late metagenomic data, 18 prokaryotic genomes with GC content ranging
from 28% to 75% were cut into 400 nt, 600 nt and 800 nt fragments
(see Supplementary Table S1 for genome names). In a given genome,
we selected 2000 fragments of each length. Frameshifts (indels) were
similated in coding regions of a certain fraction of the fragment set:
5%, 10% and 20% of all fragments. Selection of the 400 nt as the min-
imum fragment length is in agreement with the conventional practice
where fragments shorter than 400 nt are used for detecting nucleotide
polymorphisms and short functional motifs Wooley et al., 2010).
Selecting 5%, 10% and 20% fractions correspond to current estimates
of per-nucleotide error rates in metagenomic fragments assembled from
raw reads ranging from 0.0065% to 0.05%.

In the simulations, the indels were made in long stretches of coding
regions (>200 nt) at a random location, separated by a distance of at least
50 nt from the fragment boundary. If an FS was predicted in the 20 nt
vicinity of the true FS position, it was reported as a true positive, other-
wise as a false positive.

3 RESULTS

Using A to denote the number of all F S predictions, T to denote
the number of predicted true positives and S to denote the number
of simulated frameshifts, we calculated sensitivity, Sn 2% and
speciﬁcity Sp 2 g. Note that this deﬁnition of speciﬁcity, accepted
in bioinformatics literature, corresponds to the deﬁnition of pre-
cision in machine learning publications. Accuracy of
MetaGeneTack was compared with accuracy of F ragGeneScan
(version 1.15, downloaded from http://omics.informatics.indiana.
edu/FragGeneScan/). F ragGeneScan requires users to select a
sequencing method likely used for generating the input sequence
along with indication of approximate sequencing error rate. We

chose the option Sanger sequencing with 0.5 %, as it yielded the
best results of F ragGeneScan among all available options. The Sn
and Sp values averaged on the whole set of genomes are shown in
Table 1. To give an example of genome speciﬁc values of Sn and
Sp, we provide Supplementary Table S1 for the set of 400 nt frag-
ments with 20% containing F Ss. Results are averaged between
sets of fragments with F S made by insertions and F S made by
deletions (see also Fig. 1).

In terms of (Sn + Sp) /2, MetaGeneTack performed better
than F ragGeneScan by 7—12%. The values of F ragGeneScan Sn
and Sp differed by ~55 percentage points, whereas for
MetaGeneTack, this gap was much smaller. The differences were
likely due to different methods of derivation of sequence models
and differences in the hidden Markov model architectures.

To assess how effective the ﬁlters were, we evaluated
MetaGeneTack’s performance produced with various combin-
ations of ﬁlters and compared with performance of
FragGeneScan on fragment sets with insertion F S (Fig. 1A)
and sets with deletion F S (Fig. 1B). Here we show results for
600 nt-long sequences with 20% fragments containing frame-
shifts. Without ﬁlters, the Sn of MetaGeneTack was close to

With the ﬁlters, the average Sn and Sp of MetaGeneTack
increased by ~5 percentage points. Similar results were observed
when an F S prediction was reported as a true positive if located
within 10 nt from the simulated F S (data not shown). The
distribution of the distance between predicted F S positions and
true F S positions is shown in Supplementary Figure S1. The
standard deviation is 10.3 and 12.6 for MetaGeneTack and
F ragGeneScan, respectively.

4 CONCLUSION

The new software program, MetaGeneTack, addresses the chal-
lenging question of predicting frameshifts in protein-coding re-
gions of metagenomic sequences without extrinsic knowledge.
An advantage of ab initio approach is the ability to detect frame-
shifts in genes of orphan proteins that do not have known homo-
logs. We have shown that the accuracy of MetaGeneTack is
comparable or better than the accuracy of the ab inito gene
prediction tool F ragGeneScan. Most of the frameshifts predicted
by MetaGeneTack are supposed to result from sequencing
errors; still like GeneTack, the program is also able to detect
frameshifts caused due to indel mutations and ones related to
recoding (programmed frameshifts involved in gene regulation).
MetaGeneTack could be integrated into pipelines of metage-
nomic sequence annotation.

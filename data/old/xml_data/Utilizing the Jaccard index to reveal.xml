				<p>Motivation: Population stratification is one of the major sources of confounding in genetic association studies, potentially causing false-positive and false-negative results. Here, we present a novel approach for the identification of population substructure in high-density genotyping data/next generation sequencing data. The approach exploits the co-appearances of rare genetic variants in individuals. The method can be applied to all available genetic loci and is computationally fast. Using sequencing data from the 1000 Genomes Project, the features of the approach are illustrated and compared to existing methodology (i.e. EIGENSTRAT). We examine the effects of different cutoffs for the minor allele frequency on the performance of the approach. We find that our approach works particularly well for genetic loci with very small minor allele frequencies. The results suggest that the inclusion of rare-variant data/sequencing data in our approach provides a much higher resolution picture of population substructure than it can be obtained with existing methodology. Furthermore, in simulation studies, we find scenarios where our method was able to control the type 1 error more precisely and showed higher power.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In genetic association studies, the importance of population substructure/admixture and its potentially negative impact on the analysis results have long been recognized. Numerous methods have been designed to detect population substructure and adjust genetic association analysis. So far, almost all methods implicitly assumed that the<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Devlin et al., 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Devlin et al., , 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Epstein et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Lee et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Li and Yu, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Patterson et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Price et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Pritchard et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Reich and Goldstein, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Satten et al., 2001</ref>) extract the information about population substructure from the variance/covariance matrix of genotype data. The approaches have been shown to be efficient and are able to guard genetic association analysis under most circumstances. With the arrival of next-generation sequencing data, rare variants, i.e. genetic loci with small minor allele frequencies, are moving to the center of the genetic association analysis. The hypothesis is that rare variant/sequencing data will enable the direct identification of disease susceptibility loci, which genome-wide association studies have not been very successful at. Although availability of rare variant/sequence analysis holds great promise, the effects of population substructure/ admixture on the association analysis of rare variants are unclear and suitable adjustment methods have not been discussed widely in the literature (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Babron et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Epstein et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Mathieson and McVean, 2012</ref>). The effectiveness of existing adjustment approaches which are mostly built on the estimation of the genetic variance/covariance matrix is unclear for rare variants, since the estimation of the allelic covariance based on rare variants might not provide sufficient power. This expected power loss can be attributed to the low variance of rare variant genotypes and thus the covariance matrix can be unreliable for small allele frequencies, e.g. it is suggested to use SNPs with common allele frequencies for the EIGENSTRAT approach. Moreover, the key feature of rare variant data in terms of population substructure is that such variants are genetically much 'younger' (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Keinan and Clark, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Kryukov et al., 2009</ref>). The mutations that originated rare variants have occurred much more recently than those of common variants, allowing rare variant data to reflect even relatively new admixture/substructure. It is therefore unclear whether the application of adjustment methods, when they are computed based on common variants, is a suitable way to control for population substructure/admixture in rare-variant analysis. In this article, we propose a method that is designed to detect population substructure/admixture both in rare variant data and in common variant data. Instead of utilizing the genetic variance/covariance matrix, the Jaccard similarity index (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Jaccard, 1908</ref>) is used. Among existing similarity measures, the Jaccard similarity index is most suitable for the similarity calculation based on sparse binary data, since it emphasizes mutual presences of minor alleles. In comparison to identity-by-state similarity measure the Jaccard index has the advantage that it doesn't account for SNPs where a pair of individuals shares a 0 genotype, which is very efficient in a sparse dataset with only rare variants. We recommend, when available, to exclude potentially associated variants from the population structure estimation. If no such information is available, we recommend to include all rare variants in the analysis. In fact, rare variants typically do not show strong linkage disequilibrium with other rare or common variants. This is particularly due to their low minor allele frequencies (<ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Pritchard, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Pritchard and Cox, 2002</ref>). If the sample size is marginal and the sample contains only variants with very small allele frequency, excluding some long-range LD regions can reduce the resolution of population structure. However, if the Jaccard index is applied to common variants, we recommend to apply LD-pruning on the common variants prior to analysis. The approach has the advantage that it can be applied to all available genetic loci and it is computationally fast. We have implemented a C program, which takes the genotype matrix and the position file as input and produces the Jaccard similarity matrix between individuals. The application to the complete dataset of the 1000 Genomes Project (2504 individuals, 31 202 510 variants with MAF 0.01) on one processor with 2 GB RAM running under Linux took only 8 h. First, we assess the performance of our approach by application to the 1000 Genomes Project phase 3 data. A comparison of the results with existing methodology suggests that our approach provides better discrimination between subpopulations than current methodology. The approach seems to work particularly well, when we restricted the method to rare variant loci. In simulation studies, we evaluate the type-1 error of our approach and compare it to EIGENSTRAT, which uses PCA based on the genetic covariance matrix. For completeness we include in the simulation studies a model-based method ADMIXTURE (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Alexander et al., 2009</ref>), which uses a likelihood model to estimate population structure. Under different scenarios, the proposed methodology preserves the type-1 error much better.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Methods</head><p>Babron et al. (2012) have shown for the UK population that the population stratification pattern for rare variants is different from that of more common variants. Moreover, several Consortia (<ref type="bibr">The 1000</ref><ref type="bibr">Genomes Consortium, 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">, 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">The UK10K Consortium, 2015)</ref>showed that rare variants are found more often within the same population, especially those which are present only twice through the sample. Based on these findings, we aim to develop a measure, which is suitable to capture the most recent differences between individuals based on rare variant data. This information would represent a finer resolution of population structure in rare variant data. In order to keep the notation and the derivations simple, we outline the proposed method for one chromosome/genomic region. We assume that one defined genetic region or one entire chromosome has been sequenced in N individuals. For the purposes of this article, we do not distinguish whether one or two copies of the minor alleles are observed. Given the fact that we deal with rare variants it is rather unlikely to observe homozygous variants. We only differentiate between the absence and the presence of the minor allele at a variant. Let G represent our modified genotype matrix with N individuals and M markers:</p><formula>G ¼ g 11 Á Á Á g 1M .. . .. . .. . g N1 Á Á Á g NM 0 B B B @ 1 C C C A ; g ik 2 f0; 1g</formula><p>For two sample sets the Jaccard similarity coefficient is defined as the proportion of intersection between samples A and B divided by the proportion of their union:</p><p>JacðA; BÞ ¼ jA \ Bj jA<ref type="bibr">[ Bj</ref>When the two samples A and B represent binary vectors or modified genotypes, as in our case, the Jaccard similarity for individual i and j is defined as following.

Then, the Jaccard similarity coefficient is equal to:Based on the measures Jac ij we construct a symmetric similarity matrix with N rows and N columns for our study subjects, where each entry corresponds to a pair of study subjects i and j:In the EIGENSTRAT approach (<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Patterson et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Price et al., 2006</ref>) PCA is applied to the genetic variance/covariance matrix to visually detect population structures. The principal components could also be incorporated into the genetic association analysis as covariates in order to adjust for population substructure. PCA could also directly be applied to the similarity matrix SM. This corresponds to kernel PCA (<ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Schö lkopf et al., 1998</ref>), where the Jaccard index is considered as a positive definite kernel (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gower, 1971</ref>). In this article the kernel (Jaccard) matrix is centered, as this allows us to relate the eigenvalues of the Jaccard matrix to the variance explained by a given component in the feature space. Subpopulation structure can be visualized by</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1">Results for common variants</head><p>We created a setting that is commonly used in practice. We selected all common SNPs which remained after linkage disequilibrium (LD) pruning in order to reduce the LD structure between the variants. In addition, known, long-range LD regions were excluded from the analysis (<ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Price et al., 2008</ref>). This resulted in a total of 1 934 536 common variants for dataset 1 and 744 520 common variants for dataset 2. Then, based on the selected loci, we calculated the genetic covariance matrix and the Jaccard similarity matrix SM, and applied PCA to both matrices. We used all available variants, although, when information about potentially associated variants is provided, they should be excluded from population structure estimation. The<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figures 3</ref>–5. We used common axis ranges for both methods for comparison reasons. For PCA based on the genetic covariance matrix (EIGENSTRAT), the ability to distinguish between the different populations has been substantially diminished. Many of the populations are clumped together and are not identifiable. The left panel in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>depicts that the first twoPCs are driven by the large amount of variance within African populations which is captured by the covariance matrix on rare variants. The left panel in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref>illustrates that the second PC is driven by individual with the largest variance in the sparse genotype matrix. This creates 'outliers' in the principal components and reduces the resolution of the picture. In<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>, we removed the Iberian outlier for visual inspection for both methods, but we can still see that only the Finnish population is separated well in the left panel (PCA based on the covariance matrix). However, for the PCA based on the Jaccard similarity matrix SM, we observe the opposite effect. The plot for all 26 worldwide populations is similar to the one based on common variants and the first two principal components separate the main continents quite well. For the European subpopulations the first principal component separates the Finnish subpopulation and the second PC separates the two southern populations (IBS and TSI) from the two north-western populations (GBR and CEU).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Simulation study</head><p>We performed a simulation study for rare variants in order to evaluate the type 1 error and power of our approach. The goal of the simulations was to evaluate the performance of standard association analysis adjusted for population substructure, using PCA based on the Jaccard similarity matrix and using PCA based on the genetic covariance matrix. For completeness we also evaluated the performance of a model-based approach, which is not utilizing PCA. We modified the simulation design described in Price et al (2006) and utilized it. We used three different minor allele frequency cutoffs: 0.001, 0.005 and 0.01. A small diagram displaying the simulation workflow can be found in Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure S1</ref>. For each MAF setting we extracted the allele frequencies corresponding to this cutoff from the 1000 Genomes four European populations: CEU, GBR, IBS and TSI. We excluded the Finnish population, which is known to be a population isolate. Due to a restricted sample size (404 individuals), which is currently available at 1000 Genomes for given populations, we decided to keep the overall proportion of the allelic counts during our simulations. That means we generated data based on allelic counts and not allele frequencies which are sample size dependent. This allowed us to simulate larger sample sizes without loss of information about variants with really small minor allele frequencies. For the association analysis, we used the multi-loci rare variant test SNP-set Kernel Association Test (SKAT) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Wu et al. 2011</ref>). This is a flexible regression approach, which is able to incorporate population specific covariates. As covariates, we included principal components obtained either from genetic covariance matrix or from Jaccard similarity matrix or ancestry estimates obtained from ADMIXTURE. We expect the top three principal components to distinguish between the four subpopulations, so we used three principal components or ancestry estimates as covariates. As recommended by Price et al. we also included a setting with 10 principal components as covariates based on the genetic covariance matrix or the Jaccard similarity matrix. In each replication, we considered three categories of SNPs: training SNPs, null SNPs and causal SNPs. Category 1 and 2 were simulated without any disease model, i.e. without genetic effect on the phenotype, whereas for category 3 we considered a multiplicative disease model with a relative risk of 2 for every SNP. Within each category, we randomly generated 100 000 SNPs for a given MAF cutoff from the drawn allele frequencies. In total that resulted in 300 000 independent SNPs. The proportions of simulated individuals coming from four populations, which mimic the four European populations were kept as following: (0.4, 0.1, 0.1 and 0.4) for cases and (0.1, 0.4, 0.4 and 0.1) for controls. Category 1 was used for population structure identification and the other 2 categories were used for association analysis, where we divided the 100 000 SNPs into 1000 groups, which are supposed to represent genes or regions of interest. We then performed the variance-component test SKAT on each group and assessed the type 1 error and power with the nominal significance level of 0.01. We performed 500 replications with different minor allele cutoffs (0.001, 0.005, 0.01) and different sample sizes (500 and 2000The outlined correction for population structure for rare variants based on Jaccard similarity matrix performed better compared to EIGENSTRAT and ADMIXTURE. Our method showed great performance in the scenario with the smallest minor allele frequency cutoff, it was the only method, which was able to control the type 1 error in this scenario. All three methods were able to maintain the type 1 error under the nominal level in the other scenarios, except ADMIXTURE in the scenario with 500 individuals and 0.005 minor allele frequency cutoff. All methods showed similar power, when 3 covariates were included in the analysis. When increasing the number of covariates to 10, we found that our proposed correction method did not lose the achieved power and showed the best performance, whereas the values for EIGENSTRAT dropped down. Overall, our proposed correction method showed the best performance ratio between type one error and power.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Conclusion</head><p>Next generation sequencing data is becoming highly available and numerous methods have been developed to study the association of variants with low minor allele frequencies with complex traits (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Ionita-Laza et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Li and Leal, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Madsen et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Price et al., 2010b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Wu et al., 2011</ref>). However, the fact that rare variants might represent different patterns of population stratification is currently underestimated. Recently, several Consortia (1000 Genomes, UK10K) showed that variants with a very low minor allele frequency often cluster within one population. Those variants might represent 'younger' population-specific mutations and, hence, can be utilized for population structure correction in rare variant tests. We propose an approach for the detection of population substructure in sequencing data that utilizes the information about co-appearances of the minor alleles between individuals. The attractive features of the approach are its computational speed and its capability to expose population substructure with higher resolution within sequence data than standard methodology. It requires no removal of long-range LD regions, when the dataset contains only rare variants. The approach can be seen as a modification of the EIGENSTRAT approach in which the genetic covariance matrix is replaced by the Jaccard similarity matrix. Consequently, existing methodology can be used to guard association tests against confounding due to population substructure. For example, the principal components based on the Jaccard similarity matrix can be included into the association analysis as covariates (<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Price et al., 2010a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">, Wu et al., 2011</ref>), or into the conditional sampling approach for rare variant analysis (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Epstein et al., 2012</ref>). Several studies (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Baye et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Zhang et al. 2013</ref>) assessed the population structure in rare variants by applying standard PCA, based on genetic covariance data. Zhang et al. showed that including multiple classical PCs based on variants with low minor allele frequency might lead to power loss (overestimation) in association analysis. They also showed that classical PCA, when applied to variants with MAF &lt; 1% is sensitive to outliers and hence isn't effective in separating subpopulations. We confirm this in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref>, left panel. Here the second PC is driven by the largest variance of the sparse individual genotypes based on rare variants. Our method based on Jaccard similarity matrix was specifically designed to detect population stratification based on variants with small minor allele frequencies. We can see that due to sparsity of datasets with rare variants standard covariance-based methods fail to detect population structure. Given the imminent arrival of large-scale whole genome sequencing (WGS) studies, there is a urgent need for methods that account for population structure in datasets with rare variants. We evaluated our approach by simulation studies and by application to the 1000 Genomes Project data. Our empirical evidence based on the application to the 1000 Genomes Project Data and simulation studies suggests that the proposed methodology provides a finer resolution picture of population substructure than existing methodology. The simulation studies show that our method is able to achieve equal or higher power in most of the simulated scenarios, while maintaining the type 1 error under the nominal level. Overall, our method did not lose the power, when increasing the number of principal components, included in the analysis, in comparison the classical PCA. This is an important feature for real data analysis with big sample sizes.</p></div>

			<note place="foot">plotting the first principal components, and association analysis results can be adjusted for population substructure by including the principal components of SM as covariates. The number of covariates to use in an association analysis strongly depends on the dataset, which is analyzed. It is important to note that there exists no generally accepted rule to determine the optimal number of eigenvectors sufficient to correct for population structure in association analysis. However, there exist several mostly heuristic methods in order to choose the number of components to use. The Kaiser-Guttman criterion and its modifications (Guttman, 1954; Lambert et al., 1990) are based on the average value of the eigenvalues from the data matrix. Another popular method is to visually inspect the scree plot, which plots the eigenvalues in a decreasing order against the number of principal components. Usually one chooses only those PCs, which explain the highest amount of variance in the data, i.e. until the slope is still steep. Another modification of this approach is the eigengap heuristic (Lee et al., 2010), which is based on differences between consecutive eigenvalues. We provide the code that we used to calculate the Jaccard similarity matrix. It is provided on request from authors. The further calculation, analysis and simulations were performed with R. To assess the properties of the Jaccard similarity matrix SM and compare them to similarity matrices that are built on the genetic variance/covariance matrix, the matrix SM will be computed for the 1000 Genomes Project data based on loci with common minor allele frequency (i.e. MAF &gt; 1%) and based on rare variant data, i.e. minor allele frequencies of &lt;1%. Then, we will apply PCA to visualize the information about population substructure that is contained in the Jaccard similarity matrix. The results are benchmarked with the EIGENSTRAT approach on real data from the 1000 Genomes Project and further assessed in a simulation study. 3 Results 3.1 Application to 1000 genomes data The data of the 1000 Genomes Project Consortium (2012) is an ideal instrument to assess the capability of the proposed methodology to detect population substructure in sequence data and to benchmark its results with the existing standard approach (i.e. PCA of the genetic covariance matrix). The recent phase 3 release of the project includes now 2504 indivduals from 26 populations. For the preliminary analysis of the 1000 Genomes Project data, we created two datasets. For dataset 1, we selected sequence data that is available for the autosomal chromosomes of 2504 unrelated subjects from 26 different populations (Table 1). For dataset 2, we created a subset with only European individuals (504 subjects). We assessed how well PCA based on the Jaccard similarity matrix SM is able to differentiate between the known populations. We compared the results of our proposed method to PCA based on the genetic covariance matrix as proposed by EIGENSTRAT (Price et al., 2006). Each approach was applied twice to the 1000 Genomes Data, once to data for common variants (MAF &gt; 1%) and then to rare variant data (MAF 1%, singletons excluded).</note>

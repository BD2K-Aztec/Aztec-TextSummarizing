			<abstract>
				<p>Motivation: Genetic studies focus on increasingly larger genomic regions of both extant and ancient DNA, and there is a need for simulation software to match these technological advances. We present here a new coalescent-based simulation program fastsimcoal, which is able to quickly simulate a variety of genetic markers scattered over very long genomic regions with arbitrary recombination patterns under complex evolutionary scenarios. Availability and Implementation: fastsimcoal is a C++ program compiled for Windows, MacOsX and Linux platforms. It is freely available at cmpg.unibe.ch/software/fastsimcoal/, together with its detailed user manual and example input files. Contact:</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Coalescent theory has revolutionized the field of population genetics by providing a very powerful and intuitive framework for the study of molecular diversity within and between species (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hudson, 1990</ref>). It has also provided very efficient ways to simulate diversity under complex evolutionary scenarios (<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Wakeley, 2009</ref>). A variety of coalescent-based simulation programs have been developed in the past few years (e.g.<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chen et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Ewing and Hermisson, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hudson, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Laval and Excoffier, 2004</ref>), allowing one to generate genetic data much more quickly than with classical forward approaches [see e.g.<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Carvajal-Rodriguez (2008)</ref>for a review of recent coalescent and forward genetic simulators]. However, many standard simulation programs now have problems in generating polymorphisms over long genomic regions, like those now produced by new generation sequencing technologies (e.g.<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Durbin et al., 2010</ref>). In this article, we present fastsimcoal, a completely rewritten continuous-time implementation of simcoal2 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Laval and Excoffier, 2004</ref>), with a fast sequential Markovian coalescent (SMC) model for recombining DNA sequences (<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Marjoram and Wall, 2006</ref>). fastsimcoal retains simcoal2 full flexibility in setting up complex demographic scenarios, arbitrary recombination distances between markers, arbitrary migration rates between populations and historical events. In addition, fastsimcoal allows users to specify the * To whom correspondence should be addressed. sampling times of different population samples making it suitable for serial sampling</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">METHODS AND IMPLEMENTATION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Continuous-time coalescent</head><p>The slow generation-by-generation approach implemented in simcoal2 has been replaced by a faster continuous-time coalescent framework similar to that implemented in ms (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hudson, 2002</ref>). Despite this change, we have kept the same parameterization of evolutionary scenarios as in simcoal2. Times of demographic events are still defined in generations, population sizes are defined in number of haploid individuals and mutation and recombination rates are defined per base pair per generation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Sequential Markov coalescent</head><p>In recent years, some new approximations of the recombination process have been developed (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chen et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Marjoram and Wall, 2006</ref>;<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">McVean and Cardin, 2005</ref>) that allow one to simulate DNA sequences over hundreds of megabytes much faster than under the traditional ancestral recombination graph (ARG) model. The new SMC (<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">McVean and Cardin, 2005</ref>) has been shown to produce patterns of polymorphisms and linkage disequilibrium extremely similar to those generated under a classical ARG model (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chen et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Eriksson et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Marjoram and Wall, 2006</ref>), while being much faster and demanding less memory resources. Under SMC, one generates a tree on the left end of the sequence under study, and computes the position of a recombination event on the right-hand side assuming an exponential distribution of recombination positions along the sequence. A recombination event is then implemented at random along the current tree, and the detached recombining lineage is then free to coalesce with the other remaining lineages, leading to a new tree with a potentially different topology and most recent common ancestor (MRCA). This procedure is continued until one reaches the end of the sequence to be generated. Some variations of this SMC' algorithm have been proposed to allow for coalescent events to occur between the detached lineage and the exact same branch that was cut by the recombination event [SMC' algorithm, Marjoram and<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Wall (2006)</ref>], or with trees that are further than one recombination away on the left-hand side (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chen et al., 2009</ref>). We have implemented here the SMC' algorithm in a structured population with demes connected by migrations. For each tree, we thus record all migration events having occurred in addition to all coalescent events. These events are then replayed to generate the next tree, such that the detached recombinant lineage can migrate in any deme and potentially coalesce with lineages from the left tree that were present there at the same time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Arbitrary recombination rates between markers</head><p>As in simcoal2, we have retained the possibility to simulate genetic markers at arbitrary recombination distances, such as to be able to model an array of markers at fixed locations on the genome or hot spots of recombination,</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>fastsimcoal: a fast genomic coalescent simulator</head><p>which is not directly possible with ms. We have thus implemented the possibility to have multiple recombination events between adjacent markers (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig. S1</ref>). This strategy results in patterns of linkage disequilibrium between pairs of markers that are virtually identical to those obtained under an ARG model (see Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig. S3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Serial sampling</head><p>Ancient DNA is becoming increasingly easy to extract and analyze, and when combined with present samples, it can shed new light on ancient demographic processes [see e.g.<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Ramakrishnan et al. (2005)]</ref>. Moreover, ignoring sampling heterochrony can lead to severe biases in demographic inferences and statistical tests (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Depaulis et al., 2009</ref>). It therefore appears important to take into account uneven sampling time when using simulations to generate expected diversity. Like serial simcoal (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Anderson et al., 2005</ref>), fastsimcoal now offers the possibility to define the age of each sample. Input file compatibility is preserved with simcoal2, by assuming present sampling when this age is omitted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Sampling simulation parameters</head><p>Coalescent simulation programs are now central to several Approximate Bayesian Computation<ref type="bibr">[ABC,Beaumont et al. (2002)</ref>] procedures to estimate demographic, mutation or recombination parameters from genetic data (e.g.<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Cornuet et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Lopes et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Wegmann et al., 2010</ref>). In order to facilitate this integration and efficiently perform simulations for a series of different parameter values, fastsimcoal can directly draw parameters from predefined prior distributions, or it can read parameter values directly from a definition file. These parameter values are then substituted to specific keywords present in a template input file, in a way similar to what is implemented in ABCToolBox (<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Wegmann et al., 2010</ref>). This integration is useful here since a single continuous-time coalescent simulation can be much faster than the calling of an external program that generates random parameter values. fastsimcoal now outputs site frequency spectra from DNA sequence data, which can be directly used as a summary statistic in ABC.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6">Input and output files</head><p>We have retained full compatibility with simcoal2 parameter files, and former input files should run without modifications with fastsimcoal. Additional options can now be explicitly given on the command line, according to the linux command line style. For instance, typing './fastsimcoal –i test.par –n 100' will launch 100 simulations of the model defined in input file test.par. './fastsimcoal –h' will list all possible command line options. Output files are similar to those generated by simcoal2, except that only polymorphic sites are now output for DNA sequences, with an indication of their position on the chromosome.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.7">Benchmarks</head><p>fastsimcoal has been extensively tested against ms (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hudson, 2002</ref>), MaCS (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chen et al., 2009</ref>) and simcoal2, with and without recombination (Supplementary Tables S2–S4 and Figs S2 and S3). In summary, fastsimcoal leads to patterns of diversity and linkage disequilibrium identical to those produced by MaCS, while always being faster (up to nine times for small sample sizes). Both MaCS and fastsimcoal give patterns of genetic diversity very similar to ms, and are much faster with recombination. Additional comparisons between the SMC and forward approaches can be found in<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chen et al. (2009)</ref>. Other comparisons between forward simulations and continuous-time coalescent approaches (e.g. ms) can be found in<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Davies et al. (2007)</ref>or in<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Padhukasahasram et al. (2008).</ref></p></div>

			<note place="foot" n="3"> DISCUSSION While preserving all the simulation flexibility of simcoal2, fastsimcoal is based on a faster continuous-time SMC, similar to that implemented in MaCS (Chen et al., 2009), while being always faster than MaCS, especially in case of migration between populations and for small sample sizes (n &lt;100). In addition to MaCS, fastsimcoal allows one to (i) generate genetic data other than just DNA sequences [e.g. short tandem repeats (STRs), single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)], (ii) simulate markers at arbitrary chromosome positions (e.g. by using a recombination map), (iii) simulate samples at different time periods (e.g. ancient DNA, or different viral strains) and it includes a parameter sampler allowing its integration into Bayesian parameter estimation procedures. Note however, that the use of the continuous-time coalescent approximation has been criticized for simulating diversity over long chromosomal segments, as it neglects the possibility of multiple and simultaneous coalescent events, the probability of which increases with recombination rate (Davies et al., 2007), and as it ignores overlapping recombinations in case of selfing (Padhukasahasram et al., 2008). However, despite these simplifying assumptions, patterns of diversities and linkage disequilibrium generated by continuous-time coalescent simulators are found very similar to those produced by forward and more realistic simulators (e.g. Davies et al., 2007; Padhukasahasram et al., 2008). For this reason, SMC-based simulators should thus be clearly favored for generating long stretches of DNA when computing time is an issue. Other ARG-based coalescent approaches like ms (Hudson, 2002), or those allowing for multiple and simultaneous coalescent events (e.g. Laval and Excoffier, 2004; Liang et al., 2007) may be preferred otherwise.

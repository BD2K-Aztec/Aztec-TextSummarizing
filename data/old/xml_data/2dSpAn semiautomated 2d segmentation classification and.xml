				<p>Motivation: Accurate and effective dendritic spine segmentation from the dendrites remains as a challenge for current neuroimaging research community. In this article, we present a new method (2dSpAn) for 2-d segmentation, classification and analysis of structural/plastic changes of hippo-campal dendritic spines. A user interactive segmentation method with convolution kernels is designed to segment the spines from the dendrites. Formal morphological definitions are presented to describe key attributes related to the shape of segmented spines. Spines are automatically classified into one of four classes: Stubby, Filopodia, Mushroom and Spine-head Protrusions. Results: The developed method is validated using confocal light microscopy images of dendritic spines from dissociated hippocampal cultures for: (i) quantitative analysis of spine morphological changes, (ii) reproducibility analysis for assessment of user-independence of the developed software and (iii) accuracy analysis with respect to the manually labeled ground truth images, and also with respect to the available state of the art. The developed method is monitored and used to precisely describe the morphology of individual spines in real-time experiments, i.e. consequent images of the same dendritic fragment.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Neuronal cells in different brain regions are covered with dendritic spines (<ref type="bibr">Ramon and Cajal, 1904</ref>), which are small membranous protrusions having a length of around few microns. They form the postsynaptic compartment of most excitatory synapses in the central nervous system (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Bourne and Harris, 2008</ref>). Dendritic spine is usually composed of a spine head and a spine neck that connects the spine head to the dendritic shaft (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gray, 1959</ref>). More specifically, a spine head, where the excitatory synapse is located, is separated from the parent dendrite by a thin neck, isolating the spine cytoplasm from the dendrite (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Harris, 1994</ref>). Spines are likely to play an essential role in neural circuits but their exact function is still a matter of debate (<ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Sala and Segal, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Shepherd, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Yuste, 2011</ref>).Because of their morphology, dendritic spines are assumed to play a role in electrical and biochemical compartmentalization (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bonhoeffer and Yuste, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Lee et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Tønnesen et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Yuste et al., 2000</ref>). Synaptic plasticity is essential for brain development and higher brain functions (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Alvarez and Sabatini, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Holtmaat and Svoboda, 2009</ref>). Changes in dendritic spine morphology are believed to associate synaptic plasticity (<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Holtmaat and Svoboda, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Matsuzaki et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Oh et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Tønnesen et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Yuste and Bonhoeffer, 2001</ref>), which seem to be critical for synaptic function (<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Matsuzaki et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Nusser et al., 1998</ref>). However, the understanding of the relationship between the changes in dendritic spine structure and synapse functions remains inadequate. The quantitative contribution of spine morphology to biochemical compartmentalization is still unknown, in spite of being a long-standing hypothesis (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Chang, 1952;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Crick, 1982</ref>). Therefore, the important question is, whether or how much the synaptic strength may be adjusted through structural changes in spine necks (or the complete spine) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Araya et al., 2014</ref>). Effective solution to this problem is particularly difficult due the complex morphology of the dendritic spines. The problem gets compounded with the limited resolution of optical microscopic images (<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Papa et al., 1995</ref>). In many situations, the spines are difficult to be segmented from the images of dendritic segments having hundreds of these protrusions. Identification of true spine boundaries is difficult and time-consuming (<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Mishchenko et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Mukai et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Son et al., 2011</ref>). Accurate quantitative analyses of the spines depend on the question, 'how easily and effectively the spines can be segmented from the dendrite?' Recently, some researchers have tried to address the earlier issue. A Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) application (<ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Wong et al., 2006</ref>) presents a method for characterizing one or more neurons comprising dendritic spines utilizing a grassfire process. The technique is particularly efficient for detecting separated spine heads. However, no detailed description is provided on how to precisely detect the contours of the spine. The work by<ref type="bibr">Ruszczycki et al. (2012a,b</ref>) presents a method for segmentation and analysis of every spine separately using a contour tracing algorithm. Two points are marked for each spine, one at the bottom of the neck and the other at the head [the farthest point (FP) on the spine from the neck]. Then a parameterized contour tracing algorithm detects the spine boundary and the morphological attributes. This process requires extensive user-intervention. In images with hundreds of spines, marking two end-points and choosing appropriate segmentation parameters for every spine is a rigorous job. This makes segmentation of dendritic spines both times consuming and error-prone. In one of the recent developments,<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Heck et al. (2015)</ref>proposed an advanced 3D approach for segmentation of the spines, however, that kind of approach requires many optimization steps and extensive manual supervision. Apart from the works mentioned earlier, several neuromorphological tracing tools are also available (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Donohue and Ascoli, 2011</ref>). Many of these techniques use the commercial reconstruction software Neurolucida (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Halavi et al., 2012</ref>). Existing tracing tools like, Filament Tracer (http://www.bitplane.com/imaris/filamenttracer), Amira (http://www.fei.com/software/amira-3d-for-life-sciences/), Eutectic NTS (http://neuronland.org/NLMorphologyConverter/ MorphologyFormats/Eutectics/Spec.html), 3DMA-Neuron (http:// www.ams.sunysb.edu/~lindquis/3dma/3dma_neuron/3dma_neuron. html), NeuronJ (http://www.imagescience.org/meijering/software/neu ronj/), NeuronStudio (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeuronStudio), Neuron_Morpho (http://www.southampton.ac.uk/$dales/morpho/), etc. require extensive manual annotations and parameter selection for automated/semiautomated reconstructions. For example, Filament Tracer (a module of the commercial Imaris software) incorporates visualization and editing utilities and performs morphometric calculations by fitting the objects from the finite list of shapes (such as, cone, ball and cylinder). Similarly, Neuron_Morpho, an open-source tool for semiautomatic digital tracing of neurons from image stacks, generates outline of the neurite or soma by drawing straight lines across the width of the section. None of these applications provides formal morphological definitions of spines. Some applications like NeuronJ are developed as ImageJ (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abr amoff et al., 2004</ref>) plugins and are slow in analyzing images. These tools are often applicable on specific types of images, like, 8-bit grayscale or indexed color images. The proposed 2dSpAn method significantly reduces human involvement and allows the operators to quantitatively assess dendritic spine plasticity. Users need to mark a specific dendritic segment, automatically segment the spines using the designed convolution kernels and finally mark the spines of interest to extract relevant features with high accuracy and minimal intervention. Moreover, the proposed 2dSpAn method allows morphological analysis of spines from different type of images including those acquired by super-resolution, confocal and wide field microscopy images. The overall method is divided in two steps: (i) segmentation of the dendritic spines and (ii) quantitative assessment of spine morphology. In the article, we briefly describe the theory behind the developed segmentation algorithm and highlight the main features of the 2dSpAn interface and software architecture. The performed experimental validation is done with respect to the confocal images of dendritic spines from dissociated hippocampal cultures. Finally, we conclude with a discussion on open-source software development, limitations and future plans.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Theory and methods</head><p>Present work considers a 2D grayscale image (I) of dendrites with spines as the input to the segmentation method. In I, dendrites with the spines are defined as the object region (O) and the region (I À O) is considered as the background (B). For segmentation of the dendritic spines, a dendritic segment is first identified by marking the two points p; q in O. We then estimate the region of interest (ROI) around p; q as R, such that R I. We have used adaptive binarization algorithm (<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Otsu, 1975</ref>) in R to segment O from B (<ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>).<ref type="figure">1</ref>. A grayscale image ðIÞ with dendrites and spines, along with the object region ðOÞ and the background ðBÞ. The ROI (R) is identified by manually selecting the points ðp; qÞ in O and binarized using adaptive thresholding. R 3 is the segmentation result obtained after applying the complementary convolution kernels with a ¼ 45 2dSpAn: segmentation, classification and analysis of dendritic spine plasticity</p><p>Moreover, previously we have designed a set of convolution kernels (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Basu et al., 2007</ref>), for segmentation of the dendritic spines in R. Convolution kernels ðK a Þ are represented as mutually exclusive set of 3-tuples, such that, K a : f a; k 11 ; k 12 ð Þ ; a; k 21 ; k 22 ð Þ ... a; k M1 ; k M2 ð Þ g , where a represents the angular spread (in degree) of the kernel and M ¼ 360=a. Designed convolution kernels with a ¼ 90 and a ¼ 45 are shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2a</ref>and b. During the segmentation process, we first apply the kernel k i1 from p until q or a boundary condition is reached. Let the expanded region in this step be R 1 &amp; O [<ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>. Then k i2 is applied from q until p or a boundary condition is reached. Let the region expanded after applying k i2 be R 2 &amp; O (<ref type="figure">Fig. 3f and g</ref>). Then, we estimate, R 3 ¼ ðR 1 \ R 2 Þ as the intersection of the two expanded regions generated by the two kernels, k i1 and k i2 (<ref type="figure">Fig. 3h</ref>). We then manually select a spine seed s k as a point inside a potential dendritic spine region, bounded by B and R 3 (<ref type="figure">Fig. 3h</ref>). The bounded region, expanded from s k using a region growing algorithm (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Adams and Bischof, 1994</ref>), is marked as segmented spine (S k ) (<ref type="figure">Fig. 3i</ref>). Variation of segmentation results with different choices of a, and varying binarization thresholds are illustrated in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4</ref>(a–g). The rationale behind the choice of the segmentation kernels is included in supplementary.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Quantitative assessment of spine morphology</head><p>The morphology of the dendritic spines is complex and difficult to segment and quantify. In most cases, they are described by simple parameters like length and head width (<ref type="bibr">Ruszczycki et al., 2012a,b</ref>). However, high resolution confocal microscopy allows visualization of the complex structures in greater details. In this work, we have attempted to define key morphological attributes from the 2D images of dendritic spines and classify the segmented spines in four categories; (a) Stubby, (b) Mushroom, (c) Filopodia and (d) Spine-head Protrusion (see<ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 5</ref>for illustration). Specifically, we propose formal definitions of the base, neck and head of the spine, using the standard mathematical notations of digital topology and geometry. First, we identify the base (B k ) of the dendritic spine S k as the set of points (S base ) in R 3 such that S base and S k are adjacent. Please note that, 8 À neighbourhood of a point is used to define the adjacency criterion.</p></div>

Let the DT values (distance of each point from the background) for any point (p) in R be XðpÞ. We use local scale of an object pixel as the DT value (depth) at the closest locally deepest pixel. Specifically, a pixel p 2 S k is said to be locally deepest if 8q 2 N l ðpÞ, XðqÞ XðpÞ, where N l ðpÞ is the 2l þ 1 ð Þ 2 neighborhood of p; here, l ¼ 2 is used to avoid noisy local maxima.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Classification of the segmented spines</head><p>Using the morphological definitions discussed in Subsection 2.1, we classify the spine shapes into one of the four categories: Stubby, Mushroom, Filopodia and Spine-head Protrusion. Formal morphological definitions for these spine categories are not available in the literature and these classifications were largely subjective and decided empirically by the experimental biologists. To address this issue, we have developed a rule-based approach for automatic categorization of the spine shapes into one of the four classes as discussed in Algorithm 1, where, 0 c; d 1 and D max HP k ð Þ is the distance between the two farthest locally deepest points (HP k ) in S k. The basic classification logic relies on the accurate estimation of the neck length NL k ð Þof a spine. If the neck length is zero, we classify a spine as Stubby. Otherwise, we check the positions of the locally deepest points HP k ð Þ. In case of a thin, Filopodia, the locally deepest points are usually spread along the length L K ð Þ of the spine. This is not common in Mushroom or Spine-head Protrusions, where the locally deepest points are usually concentrated around the spinehead regions. Therefore, the ratio D max HP k ð Þ=L k returns higher values in case of a Filopodia. Then, to classify the Mushroom type spines we estimate the base-to-head distance ðBH k Þ of a spine. We have observed that the Mushroom spines have short base-to-head distance in comparison to the overall length of spine and the ratio BH k =L k decisively classifies the Mushroom spines from the Spinehead Protrusions. Spine classification results on different dendritic segments with c ¼ 0:5 and d ¼ 0:5 are shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 7</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Results</head><p>The developed 2dSpAn tool is useful in a variety of applications involving large-scale annotation of dendritic spines for quick and accurate assessment of spine plastic changes. There are two specific challenges involved in this process: (i) accurate segmentation of individual spines from the dendritic segment and (ii) quantitative analysis of spine morphology for effective assessment of dendritic spines' structural changes. As discussed before, the objective of this work is to demonstrate the efficacy of the 2dSpAn tool in annotation of dendritic spines and to compare its performance with respect to the available tools. Specifically, we have concentrated on the analysis of spine plasticity using the morphological features presented in the previous section. The confocal light microscopy images of dendritic spines from dissociated hippocampal cultures have been used for: (i) quantitative analysis of spine morphological changes, (ii) reproducibility analysis for assessment of user-independence of the developed software,(iii) accuracy analysis with respect to the ground truth (GT) annotations generated by the experimental biologists and also with respect to the available state of the art. In the following subsection, we first describe the image acquisition protocol and the image sets used for the experimental validation. Then, we present the analysis of spine structural changes of the mentioned datasets, mutually blind three-user reproducibility analysis using the developed 2dSpAn software and finally, the error analysis with respect to the GT annotations and also with respect to the work by<ref type="bibr">Ruszczycki et al.

Hippocampi were triturated in plating medium, then centrifuged for 10 min at room temperature, at 208.5 g. The resulting cell pellet was suspended in plating medium, cells were counted and plated at density 120 000 cells per 18-mm-diameter coverslip (Assistent, Germany) coated with 1 mg/ml poly-L-lysine (Sigma) and 2.5 lg/ml laminin (Roche). At 3 h after plating medium was exchanged for maintenance medium (Neurobasal-A without Phenol Red, 2% B-27 supplement, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 0.5 mM glutamine, 12.5 lM glutamate, 25 lM b-mercaptoethanol) and cells were kept at 37 CC, under a humidified 5% CO 2 atmosphere. 3.1.2 Live cell imaging and chemical long-term potentiation (cLTP) stimulation Cultured hippocampal neurons were transfected at 14 days in vitro (DIV) with Syn-GFP plasmid to visualize neuronal morphology. Live cell imaging was performed on 20–22 DIV. Prior the imaging, the cells were placed in an acquisition chamber with controlled temperature (37 C) and stable CO 2 (5%) concentration. Dendritic segments decorated with dendritic spines were imaged at the Time 0, before stimulation, and then was induced by bath application of a mixture of 50 lM forskolin, 50 lM picrotoxin and 0.1 lM rolipram (each dissolved in DMSO) in maintenance media. Dendritic segments were imaged at 10 min after cLTP induction. Images were acquired using the Carl Zeiss LSM780 confocal microscope with a C-Apochromat 40Â/1.2 NA water immersion objective using 488 nm wavelength argon laser at 3% transmission at 70 nm/pixel resolution. A series of z-stacks were acquired at 0.4 lm step.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Analysis of spine plasticity</head><p>For detailed quantitative analysis of the dendritic spines, first we have analyzed the 2dSpAn classification results of 459 segmented spines obtained from nine sets of T0 and T10 images. Initially in T0, $31% were classified as Stubby (S), $32% as Filopodia (F), $27% as Mushroom (M) and the rest 10% as Spine-head Protrusions (P). After imaging of the same spines 10 min after cLTP (in T10), we got $35% Stubby spines, $33% Filopodia, $23% Mushroom and $9% Spine-head Protrusion spines. More than half of the spines ($54%) remain in the same state 10 min after cLTP induction. The transition patterns of spines are illustrated in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 8a</ref>. The transition patterns among three types of spine categories, Stubby, Mushroom and Filopodia (by combining Spine-head Protrusions with Filopodia) are shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 8b</ref>. To further investigate the relative changes in various morphological attributes of the segmented spines, two important features, area and length are considered from the overall experiment (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig. S1</ref>). Please note that, the method allowed to record noticeable changes in area and length of dendritic spines, the two most important attributes for spine plasticity, during cLTP induction. In the previous section, we have morphologically defined the neck-length attribute, and used this feature to classify the Stubby spines (when neck-length is zero). In T0, the initial population of some Stubby spines remains in the same state, whereas some get transformed to Filopodia or Mushroom. On the other hand, some Filopodia spines in T0 became Mushroom in T10. All these activities are reflected in the changes of length and neck-length attributes (Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. S2</ref>). Likewise, the variations in average neckwidth along the neck region of the segmented spines are also observed during the experiment. Stubby spines are excluded in this analysis since they do not have any neck region. Head-width estimates are important for all spine categories. The changes in neck width and head-width for all Mushroom spines at T10 are included in Supplementary<ref type="figure">Figure S3</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Reproducibility analysis</head><p>In this section, we present both qualitative and quantitative analysis of multiuser reproducibility of the 2dSpAn tool to assess the reliability and robustness of the developed software. The reproducibility analysis is performed on the two image datasets from three mutually blinded independent experimental biologists. In the first image, 112 spines are segmented by each of the users in both T0 and T10 images. In the second image, 39 spines are segmented in T0 and T10 images by the independent experts using our custom designed 2D graphical interface. Segmented images of dendritic spines from T10 by three different users are illustrated in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 9</ref>. Although segmentation results show significant similarity, there are some mismatches in classification results. For example, in case of segmented spine#9, results from user#1 automatically annotates it as Spine-head Protrusion, whereas the results from user#2 and user#3 annotate the same spine as Filopodia. Similarly, there are some mismatches in the classification results in spine#12, 13, 28, 41, 47, etc. The reason behind such disagreements may be illustrated from the example of spine#47, where different users segment the spine in different ways leading to varying classification results for the segmented spine. The differences in segmentation results are due to the differences in the choice of the seed pixels and other segmentation parameters like binarization thresholds, etc. Also, we have some manual segmentation and joining options in our developed 2dSpAn tool, to give more controls to the users. Uses of these advanced controls/parameters often lead to differences in segmentation and classification results. For quantitative evaluation of the reproducibility, we have used the statistical SD of the area estimates of individual spines by the three independent users. In T0 and T10 images, the average SD values are observed as 0.09 and 0.07, respectively (see Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. S4</ref>for detailed analysis).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Accuracy analysis and comparison with prior works</head><p>For accuracy analysis, we first generated GT spine segmentation results for all the nine neuronal images using the open source image processing software called Fiji (<ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Schindelin et al., 2012</ref>). Although, Fiji is a general purpose image analysis tool and not capable of extracting morphological attributes specific to a dendritic spine, we have considered the most generic and one of the most significant features, area of a spine (in micron 2 ), for comparative analysis. For accuracy assessment of the features, we have used mean absolute error (MAE) to measure the differences of the 2dSpAn estimates with respect to the GT annotations. We measure the MAE for area with respect to Fiji based GT annotations as,</p><formula>MAE 2dSpAnÀGT j j area ¼ 1 n P n i¼1 f i 2dSpAn À y i GT ,</formula><p>where, n is the total number of spines, f i and y i are the area estimates of the i th spine by 2dSpAn and Fiji based GT annotations, respectively. The2dSpAn: segmentation, classification and analysis of dendritic spine plasticityMA E 2dSpAnÀGT j j area values for 459 spines over T0 and T10 images are obtained as 0.23 and 0.21, respectively. The SD of errors over T0 and T10 images are observed as 0.18 and 0.19, respectively. To compare with the prior works, we have extensively evaluated the spine segmentation and annotation tool developed by<ref type="bibr">Ruszczycki et al. (2012a,b</ref>) over all the images. Although there are significant differences in the working principal and user intervention, we found this software as the closest match with the work developed by us. Please note that, the work by Ruszczycki et al. use extensive manual intervention for segmentation of individual spines. The MA E Ruszczycki et al:ÀGT j j area for T0 and T10 are obtained as 0.26 and 0.24, respectively. The SD of errors over T0 and T10 images are observed as 0.21 and 0.17, respectively. Likewise, MA E 2dSpAnÀRuszczycki et al:values for T0 and T10 are estimated as 0.25 and 0.37, respectively.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">Figure 10</ref>shows the comparative plot of the area feature estimated by our developed 2dSpAn tool, the Ruszczycki et al. software and Fiji based GT annotations over the segmented spines in the complete image set (T0). The accuracy analysis shows that the developed 2dSpAn tool is more accurate than the work by<ref type="bibr">Ruszczycki et al.</ref>with respect to the estimated area of the segmented spines on both T0 and T10 images. Also, 2dSpAn requires considerably less user involvement in comparison to the work by<ref type="bibr">Ruszczycki et al. (2012a,b</ref>)Therefore, large number of spines can be annotated quickly and effortlessly without compromising on the accuracy of the estimated spine features. We have also assessed the accuracy of the spine classification results with respect to the manual annotations done by the one experimental neurobiologist. The spines are annotated in three classes as Mushroom, Stubby or Filopodia. 2dSpAn successfully classified 63.7% spines in T0 and 60.4% spines in T10 images. In many cases, the manual annotator was unsure about the true label of the segmented spine, thus a consensus of manual annotators would be required to improve the quality of the manual annotations. Also, automatic spine classification module itself may be improved in the future by incorporating advanced machine learning algorithms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Discussion</head><p>In this work, we present a new tool for fast and accurate annotation of dendritic spines from confocal microscopy images. However, the 2dSpAn method allows determining the morphology of spines from super-resolution microscopy and is not limited only to confocal images. Please note that, the applied confocal imaging technique provides sufficient resolution to detect the changes of dendritic spines morphology (<ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Szepesi et al., 2014</ref>). We also define and extract several morphological features from the segmented spine images for quantitative assessment of spine structural plasticity. Although there are some tools that serve somewhat similar purposes, like the one developed by<ref type="bibr">Ruszczycki et al. (2012a,b</ref>), they do not provide theformal morphological definitions to different spine compartments. For example, there were no formal morphological characterizations to base, neck and head of a spine, in the prior works. There are plenty of biological discussions in contemporary literature but most of them are subjective with respect to digital image segmentation and analysis. We also provide an automatic spine classification framework based on the features extracted from the segmented spines. The proposed spine classification model works on a rulebased decision tree framework and may be improved further in future versions of the software. The performance of the classifier is assessed by comparing the manual annotations from experimental biologists. The developed spine segmentation methodology is based on a novel convolution kernel-based approach. This methodology is effective in isolating the dendritic segment in between two manually embedded seed points on the image, using the 2D graphical user interface of the developed software. The spines on either side of the dendritic segment are marked by the user by placing a single inside seed, leading to segmentation of the spine from the dendritic segment. The morphological features like area and length of the spine are computed immediately. Other features like neck-length, neck-width and head-width are also estimated for each segmented spine. The segmentation and classification steps in the 2dSpAn tool are extremely fast and almost instantaneous on a standard desktop computer. The segmentation task takes $1 s and the classification of individual spines takes several milliseconds computation time on the desktop computer used in our experiment. To assess the efficacy of the developed tool, we first analyzed dendritic spine structural changes with respect to two image datasets, before and after cLTP. We have quantitatively assessed the transitions between the spine categories Stubby, Filopodia, Mushroom and Spine-head Protrusions. The changes in spine area and length are observed over all segmented spines. For all nonStubby spines, the changes in neck-length and neck-width values are analyzed. We have also assessed the changes in head-width in all Mushroom type spines. Please note that the objective of this study is to demonstrate the capabilities of the developed 2dSpAn tool and therefore we are not inferring any biological significance from the experimental observations. For stability and robustness study, a three-user reproducibility analysis has been performed. Both qualitative and quantitative analysis show exciting results on the T0 and T10 image sets. The accuracy analysis is performed with respect to the manually annotated GT dataset and also with respect to the prior works available in this domain. There are still scopes for improvement especially with respect to the design of the user interface and also with respect to the preprocessing steps for the image sets. The complete work depends on the binarization algorithm applied on the ROI marked by the user. At this moment, we use a global binarization on the complete region. This process may sometime inflict noise in the data, leading to inappropriate segmentation of the spines. We are currently working on that issue and hope to improve the same in the upcoming version of the software. The basic software architecture, along with a representative screenshot (Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. S5</ref>) is discussed in supplementary and also in the user manual. Finally, on the availability of the developed software, we would like to mention that the complete open-source, platform-independent package is available at https:// sites.google.com/site/2dspan/ for non-commercial use by the research community.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig.</head><figDesc>Fig. 1.

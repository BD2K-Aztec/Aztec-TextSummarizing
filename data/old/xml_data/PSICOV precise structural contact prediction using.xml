			<abstract>
				<p>Motivation: The accurate prediction of residue–residue contacts, critical for maintaining the native fold of a protein, remains an open problem in the field of structural bioinformatics. Interest in this long-standing problem has increased recently with algorithmic improvements and the rapid growth in the sizes of sequence families. Progress could have major impacts in both structure and function prediction to name but two benefits. Sequence-based contact predictions are usually made by identifying correlated mutations within multiple sequence alignments (MSAs), most commonly through the information-theoretic approach of calculating mutual information between pairs of sites in proteins. These predictions are often inaccurate because the true covariation signal in the MSA is often masked by biases from many ancillary indirect-coupling or phylogenetic effects. Here we present a novel method, PSICOV, which introduces the use of sparse inverse covariance estimation to the problem of protein contact prediction. Our method builds on work which had previously demonstrated corrections for phylogenetic and entropic correlation noise and allows accurate discrimination of direct from indirectly coupled mutation correlations in the MSA. Results: PSICOV displays a mean precision substantially better than the best performing normalized mutual information approach and Bayesian networks. For 118 out of 150 targets, the L/5 (i.e. top-L/5 predictions for a protein of length L) precision for long-range contacts (sequence separation &gt;23) was ≥0.5, which represents an improvement sufficient to be of significant benefit in protein structure prediction or model quality assessment.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Residue–residue contacts are known to play critical roles in maintaining the native fold of proteins and guiding protein folding (<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Gromiha and Selvaraj, 2004</ref>). Such residue contacts are usually well * To whom correspondence should be addressed. separated with regards to the primary sequence but display close proximity within the 3D structure. Although different geometric criteria for defining contacts have been given in the literature, typically, contacts are regarded as those pairs of residues where the C-β atoms approach within 8 Å of one another (C-α in the case of Glycine) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Fischer et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr">Graña et al., 2005a, b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hamilton and Huber, 2008</ref>). It has long been observed that with sufficient correct information about a protein's residue–residue contacts, it is possible to elucidate the fold of the protein (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Gobel et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Olmea and Valencia, 1997</ref>). However, accurate prediction of intrachain residue–residue contacts from sequence data alone remains an open problem. A solution would yield benefits for a range of endeavours including fold recognition, ab initio protein folding, 3D model quality assessment and de novo protein design. The majority of successful approaches for contact prediction attempt to extract contact information from the content of a multiple sequence alignment (MSA); usually through the simple identification of correlated mutations (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ashkenazy and Kliger, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Gobel et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Neher, 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Pollock and Taylor, 1997</ref>) or by calculating the mutual information (MI) between columns in the MSA (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Burger and van Nimwegen, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Dunn et al., 2008</ref>). The underlying rationale rests on the fact that any given contact critical for maintaining the fold of a protein will constrain the physicochemical properties of the amino acids involved. Should a given contacting residue mutate and potentially perturb the properties of the contact, then its contacting partner will be more likely to mutate to a physicochemically complementary amino acid residue, to ensure the native fold of the protein remains stabilized. Turning this observation around, pairs of residues seen to coevolve in tandem and thus preserving their relative physiochemical properties, are likely candidates to form contacts. Such linked mutational events are often referred to simply as 'correlated mutations'. The physicochemical similarity of residue pairs is typically scored with the McLachlan matrix (<ref type="bibr" target="#b29">McLachlan, 1971</ref>), although recent work has called into question its use (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Burger and van Nimwegen, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Lena et al., 2011</ref>). To date, a wide variety of information theory and machine learning algorithms have been applied to the problem of correlated mutation analysis including MI, Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines and linear regression models (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Fariselli et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hamilton et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">MacCallum, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Martin et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Pollastri and Baldi, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Punta and Rost, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Shao and Bystroff, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Xue et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Yuan, 2005</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PSICOV: contact prediction using sparse inverse covariance estimation</head><p>A thorough review of the currently available methods can be found in<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Horner et al. (2008)</ref>Despite significant attention, what success there has been in predicting structurally important contacts has generally been rather modest, and progress in the field has remained slow (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Ezkurdia et al., 2009</ref>). Even the best methods display low accuracies and, while the predictions are better than random, an accuracy between 20% and 40% is typical (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Burger and van Nimwegen, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Fariselli et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hamilton et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Pollastri and Baldi, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Punta and Rost, 2005</ref>). This low accuracy, indicating a large number of false positives in the prediction, is a consequence of two further features of the MSA: additional phylogenetic residue correlations and linked chains of covariance. Both these factors add considerable noise to the signal contained in the MSA (<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lapedes et al., 1999</ref>). Many prediction methods attempt to enrich the prediction set by filtering out the false positives using simple heuristic rules. The most direct method being to filter out contacts in excess of the expected number of contacts each residue can make (<ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Yuan, 2005</ref>). Additionally, statistical methods such as bootstrapping (<ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Olmea and Valencia, 1997</ref>), estimating the background phylogenetic noise (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Dunn et al., 2008</ref>) or the use of ancillary predictions such as secondary structure prediction (<ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Shao and Bystroff, 2003</ref>) have also been applied with a degree of success. As already mentioned, for purely sequence-based approaches to contact prediction, there are two main sources of noise in the analysis of correlated mutations: phylogenetic bias and indirect coupling effects (<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Lapedes et al., 1999</ref>). The latter problem of determining direct from indirect coupling effects in correlation mutation analysis seems to have received the lesser amount of attention in the literature.<ref type="bibr">Lapedes et al.</ref>related the problem of decoupling mutation correlations in sequence alignments to the inverse Ising problem in statistical physics, and proposed a solution based on maximization of entropy. This idea has been further refined using a message-passing algorithm (<ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Weigt et al., 2009</ref>). Recently, Burger and van Nimwegen (2010) used a computationally efficient Bayesian network approach to tackle the same indirect coupling problem. In this article, we propose the use of sparse inverse covariance estimation techniques (<ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Meinshausen and Bühlmann, 2006</ref>) to deal with the coupling effects and test our method on a benchmark set of experimentally determined protein structures. These graphical inference techniques are simple and yet remarkably powerful, and while they have been applied to other areas of computational biology such as gene network discovery (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Friedman et al., 2008</ref>), they have not previously been applied to sequence analysis problems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Mutual information</head><p>The most common method for identifying correlated mutations in MSAs is to calculate the MI between two sites:</p><formula>MI = ab f (A i B j ) log f (A i B j ) f (A i )f (B j ) (1)</formula><p>where f (A i B j ) is the observed relative frequency of amino acid pair ab at columns ij, f (A i ) is the observed relative frequency of amino acid type a at column i and f (B j ) is the observed frequency of amino acid type b at column j. The usefulness of MI to predict protein contacts can be further enhanced by normalization to take into account bias in the sequence family being analysed (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Dunn et al., 2008</ref>). Both entropic bias and some measure of phylogenetic bias can be removed by this kind of normalization. Entropic bias refers to the false signals that arise from either having insufficient sequences to properly sample residue types or from extremes of conservation (sites with very high or very low conservation can lead to spurious predictions of contacts). Phylogenetic bias refers to the false signals due to functionally related clusters of residues appearing to co-evolve according to the structure of the underlying evolutionary tree. Despite doing a reasonable job of correcting for entropic and phylogenetic bias, such normalization cannot help reduce the effects of chaining within the protein's contact graph (i.e. indirect coupling effects where direct coupling between sites AB and BC can result in observed correlations between AC, even though no direct interaction exists between AC). Here we attempt to correct for these effects using sparse inverse covariance estimation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Inferring directly coupled sites using covariance</head><p>The starting point of our method is to consider an alignment with m columns and n rows, where each row represents a different homologous sequence and each column a set of equivalent amino acids across the evolutionary tree, with gaps considered as an additional amino acid type. We can compute a 21m by 21m sample covariance matrix as follows:</p><formula>S ab ij = 1 n n k=1 (x ak i −¯ x a i )(x bk j −¯ x b j ) (2)</formula><p>where x ak i is a binary variable (x ∈{0,1}) indicating the presence or absence of amino acid type a at column i in row k and x bk j the equivalent variable for observing residue type b at column j in row k. This calculation of covariance based on binary amino acid variables is similar to that used by<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Halabi et al. (2009)</ref>to determine independent evolutionary units. Based on the standard identity for covariance of Cov(X,Y ) = E(XY )−E(X)E(Y ), and the expectation of a binary variable E(x) being equivalent to the probability of a positive observation p(x = 1), this simplifies to the following expression based on the observed marginal frequencies of amino acids (f (A i ) and f (B j )) and amino acid pairs (f (A i B j )) at the given sites in the set of aligned sequences:Any individual element of this matrix gives the covariance of amino acid type a at position i with amino acid type b at position j. By calculating the matrix inverse of the covariance matrix, the precision or concentration matrix () is obtained, from which a matrix of partial correlation coefficients for all pairs of variables can be calculated as follows:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>S</head><formula>ρ ij =− ij ii jj (4)</formula><p>In the simplest case, a partial correlation coefficient can be calculated between two random variables with the controlling effect of a third random variable taken into account. The partial correlation matrix above, however, gives the correlations between all pairs of variables with the controlling effects of all other variables taken into account [e.g. see Bühlmann and van de Geer (2011); Chapter 13, Section 13.4]. Here, the partial correlation matrix gives the correlation between any pair of amino acids at any two sites, conditional on the frequencies of amino acids at all other sites. Thus, assuming the sample covariance matrix can in fact be inverted, the inverse covariance matrix provides information on the degree of direct coupling between pairs of sites in the given MSA. Off-diagonal elements of the inverse covariance matrix which are significantly different from zero are indicative of pairs of sites which have strong direct coupling (and are likely to be in direct physical contact in the native structure). Unfortunately, the empirical covariance matrices produced in this application are guaranteed to be singular due to the fact that not every amino acid will be observed at every site, even in very large families, and thus there will be more variables than observations. Similar issues occur in the areas of finance (in calculating correlations between stock prices) and in gene Page: 186 184–190</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D.T.Jones et al.</head><p>network reconstruction where the number of observed variables is again often less than the dimensionality of the problem. Although different approaches have been proposed to allow inverse covariance estimation where the sample covariance matrix cannot be directly inverted, one of the most powerful techniques is that of sparse inverse covariance estimation. In the absence of other constraints on obtained solutions, the expected sparsity of the inverse covariance matrix itself provides a powerful self-contained constraint on the obtained solution. In general terms, where an inverse covariance estimate is constrained to be sparse, the non-zero terms tend to more accurately relate to correct positive correlations in the true inverse covariance matrix. The expectation of sparsity in this application is well justified from observations of contacts in known protein structures, where on average only around 3% of all residue pairs are observed to be in direct contact.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Sparse inverse covariance estimation</head><p>The problem of sparse inverse covariance estimation has previously been studied by different authors, for example see<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Banerjee et al. (2008)</ref>;<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Friedman et al. (2008)</ref>; Meinshausen and<ref type="bibr">Bühlmann (2006)</ref>; Yuan and Lin (2007) and the additional references therein. Here, we follow the formulation of<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Banerjee et al. (2008)</ref>, which is known as the graphical Lasso method, and the implementation provided by<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Friedman et al. (2008)</ref>. We summarize the main idea behind this method and comment on how the algorithm of (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Friedman et al., 2008</ref>) can be used to solve the problem. Let S be the empirical covariance matrix computed from a sequence of d-dimensional vectors, x 1 ,...,x n , sampled from some fixed but unknown probability distribution. Matrix S can be computed as</p><formula>S ij = 1 n n k=1 (x k i − ¯ x i )(x k j −¯ x j )</formula><p>, for every i,j = 1,...,d, where ¯ x is the empirical mean. The graphical Lasso is a statistical method which estimates the inverse covariance of the data by minimizing the objective function:</p><formula>d ij=1 S ij ij −logdet+ρ d ij=1 | ij | (5)</formula><p>In this function, the d ×d matrix is required to be symmetric and positive definite. The first two terms in (5) can be interpreted as the negative loglikelihood of the inverse covariance matrix under the assumption that the data distribution is a multivariate Gaussian. The third term in (5) is the 1-norm of matrix , a special kind of regularization or penalty term. One main insight behind such a regularizer is that it favours sparse solutions, in the sense that many of the components of the positive definite matrixˆwhichmatrixˆ matrixˆwhich minimizes (5) will be zero. The amount of sparsity inîsinˆinîs controlled by the positive parameter ρ, which needs to be chosen by the user. Typically, as ρ increases the number of zero components ofîncreasesofˆofîncreases, eventually reaching the point where all the components are equal to zero. The need for a sparse inverse covariance matrix is well understood when the data probability distribution is a multivariate Gaussian distribution with covariance. In this case, it is well known that −1 ij = 0 if and only if the variables i and j are conditionally independent. Hence, if we know a priori that many pairs of variables are conditionally independent, it seems appropriate to estimate the inverse covariance by the graphical Lasso method. The parameter ρ can be selected to reach a desired sparsity level, provided this is known a priori. An important rationale for sparse estimation comes from the observation that in many practical applications the size of the matrix is much larger than the number of data points n, but the underlying inverse covariance matrix which we wish to estimate is known to be sparse. Under this assumption and certain technical conditions, it has been shown that the solutionôfsolutionˆ solutionôf the above problem is a good estimate of the inverse covariance. More importantly, the sparsity pattern ofˆ,ofˆ ofˆ, namely the set of non-zero entries of this matrix, is close to the sparsity pattern of −1 , thereby providing a valuable tool for selecting the pairs of conditionally dependent variables, see for example Bühlmann and van de Geer (2011) and the associated references therein. We find the solutionˆbysolutionˆ solutionˆby solving the dual optimization problem (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Banerjee et al., 2008</ref>) and using the block coordinate descent technique described in<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Friedman et al. (2008)</ref>. This formulation also allows one to use the more general penalty term ij r ij | ij | where the r ij 's are some positive parameters, which incorporate prior knowledge on the relative important pairs of components. A final point worth noting here is that while all of the above is under the assumption that input data distribution is multivariate Gaussian, it has been shown by<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Banerjee et al. (2008)</ref>that this dual optimization solution also applies to binary data (as is the case in this application).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Shrinking the sample covariance matrix</head><p>Although the graphical Lasso approach works well in dealing with singular or poorly conditioned sample covariance matrices, the time taken to reach convergence can be problematic in some cases (e.g. families with few sequences or highly conserved regions). To speed up convergence, particularly in the worst cases, we condition the sample covariance matrix by shrinking towards a highly structured unbiased estimator:</p><formula>S = λF +(1−λ)S (6)</formula><p>where F is the structured estimator matrix and λ ∈<ref type="bibr">[0,</ref><ref type="bibr">1]</ref>is the so-called shrinkage parameter. The shrinkage target we used was F = diag( ¯ S, ¯ S,..., ¯ S) i.e. the identity matrix scaled by the mean sample variance (mean of the sample covariance matrix diagonal values). Although various approaches have been proposed to choose the ideal shrinkage parameter [e.g. Ledoit and<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Wolf (2003)</ref>], these methods either do not apply to binary variables or are based on unsuitable shrinkage targets. Here, therefore, we use the simple ad hoc approach of gradually increasing λ until the adjusted covariance matrix is no longer singular i.e. has no remaining negative eigenvalues (tested by Cholesky decomposition). Given the large number of dimensions, this shrinking procedure is generally much faster than the more common approach of truncating negative eigenvalues after finding all the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix. Having conditioned the covariance matrix by shrinking, the graphical Lasso algorithm is then used to compute its sparse inverse.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Final processing</head><p>To arrive at the final predictions of contacting residues, for alignment columns i and j, the 1-norm is calculated for the 20×20 submatrix of corresponding to the 20×20 amino acid types ab observed in the two alignment columns (contributions from gaps are ignored):</p><formula>S contact ij = ab | ab ij | (7)</formula><p>To calculate a final score which has reduced entropic and phylogenetic bias, we can correct the raw precision norms S contact ij using the same average product correction (APC) used to adjust MI for background effects as described by<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Dunn et al. (2008)</ref>. Thus, the final PSICOV score for positions i and j is given by:</p><formula>PC ij = S contact ij − ¯ S contact (i−) ¯ S contact (−j) ¯ S contact (8)</formula><p>where ¯ S contact</p><formula>(i−)</formula><p>is the mean precision norm between alignment column i and all other columns, ¯ S contact</p><formula>(−j)</formula><p>is the equivalent for alignment column j, and ¯ S contact is the mean precision norm across the whole alignment. Finally, this background corrected score can easily be converted into an estimated positive predictive value by fitting a logistic function to the observed distribution of scores.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6">Experimental details</head><p>A program to implement this method, called PSICOV (Protein Sparse Inverse COVariance), was written in C and linked to the glasso Page: 187 184–190</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>PSICOV: contact prediction using sparse inverse covariance estimation</head><p>Fortran code as obtained from the CRAN archive (http://cran.rproject.org/web/packages/glasso). Good initial results were obtained with the lasso regularization parameter ρ set to a constant value of 0.001. However, we find that slightly better results can be obtained (at the expense of a 2–3× increase in calculation time) by iteratively adjusting ρ to achieve a target density of 3% (i.e. 3% non-zero terms in the final precision matrix). This target density was chosen to roughly correspond to the expected fraction of contacting residue pairs in globular protein domains. We tried both the exact and approximate algorithms implemented in the glasso code and found the quicker to calculate approximate solution (<ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Meinshausen and Bühlmann, 2006</ref>) was often just as good as (and occasionally better than) the exact solution. However, with recent upgrades in the glasso code (V1.7 and later), the speed advantage of the approximation over the exact method is now only around 50% and so all results presented here are based on exact solutions. MIp values were calculated as described in Dunn et al.where a highly resolved (resolution ≤1.9 Å) X-ray crystallographic structure was available, the target protein was known to be a biological monomer, and where the structure comprised a single copy of the Pfam domain. Target sequences shorter than 50 residues and longer than 275 were not considered, giving a final total of 150 chains (listed in Supplementary Material). The actual target sequences were derived from the C-α ATOM records in the PDB files [http://www.pdb.org,<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Berman et al. (2000)]</ref>. As the seed alignments in Pfam are often derived from structure-based alignments, our alignments were generated automatically using the jackhmmer program, which is part of the HMMER 3.0 package (http://hmmer.org). For each of the 150 PDB-derived sequences, three iterations of jackhmmer, searching against the UNIREF100 data bank (Magrane and the UniProt<ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Consortium, 2011</ref>), were used to find and align homologues. In the final alignments, duplicate rows (i.e. sequences 100% identical over the length of the alignment) and columns with gaps in the target sequence were deleted so that the number of columns in each alignment equalled the target sequence length. Numbers of distinct sequences in each alignment ranged from 511 (AraC-like ligand binding domain) to 74 836 (response regulator receiver domain). A full list of the 150 targets used, along with PDB codes, Pfam identifiers, chain lengths and numbers of aligned sequences is provided as Supplementary Material. Full datasets will be made available alongside the program source code. In computing the marginal relative frequencies</p><formula>[f (A i B j ), f (A i ) and f (B i )]</formula><p>, simple BLOSUM-style sequence weighting (<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Henikoff and Henikoff, 1992</ref>) and pseudocount regularisation are used. The sequence weighting was carried out with a threshold of 62% sequence identity (as used in the construction of the standard BLOSUM62 matrix), and a pseudocount of 1 was used in all experiments. The same weighting and pseudocount procedures were also applied to the calculation of MIp values. For benchmarking purposes, a true contact was defined as any pair of residues where the C-β to C-β distance (C-α to C-α distance in the case of glycine) was &lt;8 Å. This corresponds to the standard contact prediction evaluation criteria used in the biennial CASP experiment (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Ezkurdia et al., 2009</ref>). In addition, all atom contacts were used, where a contact is defined when any pair of heavy atoms in the two residues are closer than &lt;6 Å.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1</ref>also shows the relative effects of sequence weighting on both PSICOV and MIp. It is quite clear that PSICOV is greatly superior to the best MI approach in predicting contacts. There is very little difference in results across all four methods for the top 100 ranked predictions at lower sequence separations, but this is only to be be expected as there are a limited number of true contacts to find in those ranges. The large gap between MIp and the two direct coupling approaches for sequence range 5–9 suggests that indirect coupling effects have a stronger effect for residue pairs close in the sequence. Possibly this is a result of the rigidity of secondary structure elements amplifying indirect coupling effects, and we are keen to investigate that hypothesis in future work. The earlier Bayesian network approach also performs better than MIp, in agreement with the original results of Burger and van Nimwegen (2010), but for long range contact prediction, it does not outperform MIp with sequence weighting. The importance of applying sequence weighting to the calculation<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Buslje et al. (2009)</ref>, and similarly, PSICOV also benefits from sequence weighting. Nevertheless, even without sequence weighting, PSICOV still significantly outperforms all the other methods across all sequence separation ranges. Looking at the rank-50 results for the hardest case of sequence separation &gt;23, PSICOV is able to predict over 50% of true contacts compared to just under 40% in the case of MIp (and around 20% in the case of raw MI). This level of accuracy is likely to be of very significant benefit in protein structure prediction applications. In this respect,<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>gives a more accurate view of performance, where precision values are given for the top L, L/2, L/5 and L/10 predicted contacts, where L is the length of the target protein. These thresholds are commonly used in independent assessments of contact prediction methods (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Ezkurdia et al., 2009</ref>). Although, for simplicity, C-β distances are most commonly used in benchmarking contact prediction methods, a more realistic criterion is to define contacts between any heavy atom in the two amino acids.<ref type="figure" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>gives the equivalent benchmark data for all heavy atom contacts. Again, PSICOV produces substantially more correct predictions than the other tested methods across all sequence separation ranges and for all ranking subsets. For the all-atom contact definition, we find that for 59% of the targets the L precision is &gt;0.5. With 1 predicted contact per residue and a precision of over 50%, this information would be sufficient to narrowly constrain the fold of a given protein.Average performance only provides part of the picture, of course. Of perhaps more interest is the distribution of benchmark results across the set of targets.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 2</ref>shows the range of precision values for all 150 targets, and from this we see that the L precision distribution is fairly symmetric, with around 25 poor results (L precision &lt;0.3) and a similar number of excellent results (L precision &gt;0.6). For the smaller subsets of predicted contacts, as expected, the precision distributions skew to higher values, with 85% of targets having an L/10 precision of 0.6 or better. Unfortunately, it is difficult to find a single factor that determines prediction accuracy. No correlations were observed between prediction accuracy and sequence length or number of gaps in the alignment. A weak correlation (Spearman ρ = 0.3) was observed with mean alignment entropy (basically the degree of sequence conservation). As might be expected, there was a moderate correlation with the number of aligned sequences (Spearman ρ = 0.596). No stronger correlation was observed (Spearman ρ = 0.588) with the effective number of aligned sequences (i.e. taking the sequence redundancy into account).<ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 3</ref>shows these two relationships. Finally, to look at the added value of the graphical Lasso procedure over and above the widely used MIp measure,<ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 4</ref>shows the L/2 precision for PSICOV compared with that of MIp. Clearly the treatment of indirect coupling effects by the graphical Lasso has a substantial positive effect on prediction accuracy in almost every case. In five cases, the graphical Lasso analysis seems to slightly reduce accuracy, although it is not clear to us what is special about these cases. The worst case example is that of one of the shortest targets 1M8A-A (61 residues) where PSICOV predicts 17 contacts, compared with 13 in the case of MIp. This is hardly a significant difference, but it is still apparent that the direct coupling analysis is not helping in this case, for whatever reason. Looking at the performance of PSICOV both in terms of average performance and performance in the best cases, it is clear that it can provide spatial constraints for protein modelling beyond those that can be obtained by even the best machine learning-based contact prediction approaches. In the CASP8 experiment, the best contact prediction server had a precision of 30% for the top L/5 predicted contacts (sequence separation &gt;23) over a common subset of nine targets (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Ezkurdia et al., 2009</ref>). Although the benchmark set in this case is different, PSICOV achieves an average accuracy of 62% using the same criteria. It is also possible that PSICOV could be further improved by incorporating it in a more general machine learning-based contact predictionmethod that also takes into account information such as predicted secondary structure and solvent accessibility. Although the problem of indirect versus direct coupling in residue covariation has been known for some time, surprisingly few approaches have been proposed to tackle it.<ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Weigt et al. (2009)</ref>focus on the problem of predicting protein–protein interactions, and their method is extremely computationally intensive, requiring several days of CPU time to evaluate just 60 pre-selected alignment columns in bacterial two-component systems. Recently, the same group have tried adapting the method to predicting intrachain contacts with apparently good results (C.Sander and D.Marks, personal communication). The method of Burger and van Nimwegen (2010) has actually been applied to the task of intrachain contact prediction, and here we have benchmarked it directly against PSICOV on the same set of alignments. This Bayesian network method is far less computationally demanding than the message-passing approach of<ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Weigt et al. (2009)</ref>, and is also substantially faster than PSICOV, taking a median of 2 mins per target compared with a median of 30 mins per target for PSICOV (range 1–240 mins). Despite the obvious speed advantage of the Bayesian network approach, it is clear from the results shown that PSICOV is the more precise method across all sequence separations and residue rankings. As high-throughput sequencing rapidly expands the sizes of protein families, the applicability of contact prediction from large MSAs will clearly be expected to increase. Nevertheless, it is important to consider the targets which performed poorly in our benchmark and yet had large numbers of homologous sequences available (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Fig. 3</ref>). These cases are unlikely to be improved by simply collecting further sequence data. Although PSICOV is able to effectively disentangle indirect coupling effects, some alignments are impossible to analyse due to functional or structural noise. A good example of a problem case would be a family of homo-multimers, where it would be impossible to determine which correlations are due to interchain contacts and which are due to intrachain contacts. Other problems would include high conservation in some families, particularly conservation around ligands or co-factors.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">CONCLUSION</head><p>We have demonstrated that the graphical Lasso procedure, previously applied successfully to other graphical inference problems such as gene network reconstruction, performs excellently in the task of identifying directly coupled covarying columns in large MSAs, which are indicative of residue–residue contacts in protein families. For 44% of the targets, contact prediction was excellent with a precision &gt;0.5 for the longest-range top-L/2 predicted contacts (i.e. &gt;50% correctly predicted long-range contacts per residue). At this level of accuracy, predicted contacts should be invaluable in determining protein folds; e.g. in protein model quality assessment or decoy selection (<ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Miller and Eisenberg, 2008</ref>). Both the mean and peak performance of PSICOV is substantially higher than that achieved by either the recently proposed Bayesian network approach of Burger and van Nimwegen (2010) or the APC corrected mutual information approach of<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Dunn et al. (2008)</ref>, and it is likely that when further combined with other predicted structural information such as predicted secondary structure and solvent exposure that PSICOV will be able to reach even higher levels of accuracy. Although PSICOV is able to deal with many of the statistical problems in contact prediction from large MSAs, there remain several practical issues. First, sequence weighting becomes more important as the sizes of families increase. It turns out that for large families, sequence weighting occupies the bulk of the computation time as it is an O(n 2 ) procedure. More efficient sequence weighting schemes do exist [e.g.<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Henikoff and Henikoff (1994)</ref>], but we found these schemes performed poorly in this application, probably because they tend to overweight misaligned or incorrect sequences. Secondly, the practical difficulties of accurately and automatically aligning tens or hundreds of thousands of protein sequences cannot be underestimated. Better alignment methods for large sequence families are certain to offer improvements in contact prediction accuracy. Although the standard graphical Lasso approach has been used in PSICOV, other sparse learning algorithms could easily be applied to the same problem. One interesting possibility, that we are currently investigating, is to make use of a group Lasso approach (<ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Ma et al., 2007</ref>) to cluster together covariances relating to different residue pairs. In the current approach, each potential contact is scored by summing 20×20 matrix values relating to the individual amino acid pairs in the two alignment columns. In a grouped Lasso approach, rather than treating the matrix values in the 20×20 submatrix as independent, they could be processed as a group of related variables. Overall, we would hope that more tailored sparse learning algorithms, better alignment algorithms, along with better sequence weighting and regularization schemes will significantly improve the results obtained from methods such as PSICOV in the future.<ref type="bibr">Page: 190 184–190 D.T.Jones et al.</ref></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><figDesc>[17:34 20/12/2011 Bioinformatics-btr638.tex] Page: 185 184–190</figDesc></figure>

Results are also subdivided by sequence separation of predicted pairs, as it is expected that contacting residue pairs far apart in the sequence will be harder to predict than those close together. Figure 1 also shows the relative effects of sequence weighting on both PSICOV and MIp. It is quite clear that PSICOV is greatly superior to the best MI approach in predicting contacts.

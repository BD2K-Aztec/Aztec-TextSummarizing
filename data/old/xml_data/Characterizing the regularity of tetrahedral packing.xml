				<p>Motivation: While protein secondary structure is well understood, representing the repetitive nature of tertiary packing in proteins remains difficult. We have developed a construct called the relative packing group (RPG) that applies the clique concept from graph theory as a natural basis for defining the packing motifs in proteins. An RPG is defined as a clique of residues, where every member contacts all others as determined by the Delaunay tessellation. Geometrically similar RPGs define a regular element of tertiary structure or tertiary motif (TerMo). This intuitive construct provides a simple approach to characterize general repetitive elements of tertiary structure. Results: A dataset of over 4 million tetrahedral RPGs was clustered using different criteria to characterize the various aspects of regular tertiary structure in TerMos. Grouping this data within the SCOP classification levels of Family, Superfamily, Fold, Class and PDB showed that similar packing is shared across different folds. Classification of RPGs based on residue sequence locality reveals topological preferences according to protein sizes and secondary structure. We find that larger proteins favor RPGs with three local residues packed against a non-local residue. Classifying by secondary structure, helices prefer mostly local residues, sheets favor at least two local residues, while turns and coil populate with more local residues. To depict these TerMos, we have developed 2 complementary and intuitive representations: (i) Dirichlet process mixture density estimation of the torsion angle distributions and (ii) kernel density estimation of the Cartesian coordinate distribution. The TerMo library and representations software are available upon request.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The existence of common secondary structure motifs in proteins, as initially proposed by<ref type="bibr">Pauling and Corey (1951a, b)</ref>, is well known, and application of these backbone sequence preferences has proven successful in protein structure design (<ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Kuhlman et al., 2003</ref>) and prediction (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bradley et al., 2005</ref>). As the packing of side-chains * To whom correspondence should be addressed. has been shown to be broadly regular and tetrahedral (<ref type="bibr">Bagci et al., 2003</ref>), characterizing the recurring elements that make up protein tertiary structure would improve approaches to protein design and the refinement of predictive models toward their native structure. Our work investigates repetitive units of tertiary structure using an intuitive analysis of tetrahedral packing. Using an approach combining graph theory and the Delaunay tessellation (<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Delaunay, 1934</ref>), we can classify recurring patterns of side-chain packing that clearly describe motifs of tertiary structure. Initial studies of protein tertiary structure (<ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kozitsyn and Ptitsyn, 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Nandi et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Rustici and Lesk, 1994</ref>) were limited by the size of the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Dutta et al., 2009</ref>). Currently, tertiary analyses are applied to improve structural alignment accuracy (<ref type="bibr">Artymiuk et al., 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Berger, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Berger and Singh, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Dudev and Lim, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Huan et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Liu et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Nebel et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Ortiz et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Roach et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Shi et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Sun et al., 1997</ref>), while classification of tertiary structure motifs has focused on side-chain packing within a fold family (<ref type="bibr">Bandyopadhyay et al., 2009a, b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bradley et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Holmes and Tsai, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Huan et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Selvaraj and Gromiha, 2003</ref>). For example, Tropsha and co-workers (<ref type="bibr">Bandyopadhyay et al., 2009a, b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Huan et al., 2005</ref>) used the Delaunay tessellation (<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Delaunay, 1934</ref>) and subgraph mining to identify tertiary packing motifs common to members of individual protein families, but no comparison of side-chain geometries were made. Comparison of the family subgraphs found no motifs in common between families. A number of studies have tried to identify tertiary motifs across protein fold families (<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Heringa and Argos, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kannan and Vishveshwara, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Kleywegt, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Nandi et al., 1993;</ref>). Using an agglomerative clustering scheme,<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Heringa and Argos (1991)</ref>found clusters that involved large side-chains and tended to be on the surface of the protein. Limiting their search for conserved clusters to immunoglobulins and globins showed that aligned clusters were generally at aligned positions. Side-chain packing motifs have also been used to characterize binding or active sites (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bagley and Altman, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Gregory et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gunasekaran et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Pidcock and Moore, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Shamim et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Spriggs et al., 2003</ref>). Here, we are interested in the tertiary packing that defines a protein's global structure and build on these studies of tertiary structure to develop a new approach to classify the regular packing motifs across the PDB (<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Dutta et al., 2009</ref>). Contact definitions based on radial distance cutoffs are ambiguous near their cutoff (see Section 2). The Delaunay tessellation (<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Delaunay, 1934</ref>) or its dual the (<ref type="bibr">Voronoi polyhedra Voronoi, 1908</ref>) avoids this ambiguity by finding pairs of atoms satisfying an empty<ref type="bibr">[</ref></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>R.Day et al.</head><p>sphere criterion: if a sphere is drawn with the two atoms representing the endpoints of its diameter, no other atoms will fall within that sphere. Previously, our group applied this method to analyze tertiary structure in terms of pairwise contacts within the globin fold family and showed that ∼85% of the globin sequences fall into the volume delineated by these tertiary contacts (<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Holmes and Tsai, 2005</ref>). This result strongly suggested that further investigation using the Delaunay tessellation had the potential to characterize the regular elements of protein tertiary structure. In this article, we have developed a simple construct to describe tertiary motifs: the TerMo. A TerMo is a clustered group of relative packing groups (RPGs). An RPG is a set of side-chain residues that are all in contact with each other when the Delaunay tessellation is used for contact identification. Analysis was performed on all tetrahedral RPGs from all folds in the PDB (<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Dutta et al., 2009</ref>). Geometric comparisons are made at the SCOP defined levels of Family, Superfamily, Fold and Class (<ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Murzin et al., 1995</ref>), before comparing across the entire PDB. We also find clear correlations between relative sequence positions of residues and the types of secondary structure being packed. Finally, we apply statistical modeling to the TerMos that produces a simplified descriptions of tertiary packing based on torsion angles and Cartesian coordinates, which are similar in spirit to the Ramachandran plot's description of protein secondary structure (<ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Ramachandran et al., 1963</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Construct definitions</head><p>We define a tertiary motif (TerMo) as a set of clustered relative packing groups (RPG). A relative packing group is a set of residues that all are in contact with each other, i.e. a clique in the contact graph. The contact graph was defined by performing a Delaunay tessellation (<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Delaunay, 1934</ref>) on all non-bonded, protein heavy atoms and connecting residues (nodes) that had at least one atom in contact (<ref type="figure">Fig. S1</ref>). In addition to side-chain to side-chain contacts, we included main-chain to main-chain contacts for all non-neighboring residues and side-chain to main-chain contacts for all residues. RPGs were defined using the maximal clique detection method of Bron and Kerbosch 1973). We found RPGs for all 15 273 domains in the ASTRAL SCOP 1.73 set of structures filtered at 95% sequence identity (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Chandonia et al., 2004</ref>) to permit comparisons of RPGs at the Domain and Family levels of SCOP. Also, the analysis considers the influence of redundancy added by such a high sequence cutoff. We focus our analysis on the tetrahedral RPGs defined by four residues. From our protein domain set, there are a total of 4 113 191 tetrahedral RPGs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Tertiary motif: clustering of RPGs</head><p>We defined TerMos by clustering the RPGs described above using RMSD as a distance metric. RPGs were grouped and labeled based on the number of residues falling into helical (H), extended sheet (E), turn (T) and coil (C), where H is all helical DSSP defined residues (h, g, i), E includes sheets with their bulges (e, b), T are all turns (t, s), and C is everything else. Thus, an RPG with one residue from each DSSP class would be [H1 E1 T1 C1], whereas an all helical RPG would be labeled<ref type="bibr">[H4-]</ref>. These secondary structure groups were the subjects of a complete hierarchical clustering based on the minimum root mean square distance (RMSD) between their α-carbons and their side-chain centers of mass for all possible permutations of residue ordering. In a complete clustering, RPGs (or an RPG cluster) are added to growing clusters if the maximum RMSD between that RPG and any member of the growing cluster is the current minimum in the all vs. all RMSD matrix. This procedure yields a tree structure that can be pruned at an arbitrary RMSD cutoff. To produce the TerMos, we pruned our tree at 1.5 Å RMSD and 2.0 Å RMSD. These cutoffs were chosen based on the distribution of RMSD's for RPGs from different proteins that are completely aligned in a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) using MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004;<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. S2</ref>). After an initial clustering within each sequence family, the member of each cluster with the lowest average RMSD to all others in the cluster and clustering of these representatives was repeated to identify TerMos at the SCOP (<ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Murzin et al., 1995</ref>) defined levels superfamily, fold, class and PDB levels. A 2.0 Å RMSD cutoff was required for clustering at the class and PDB levels. Clustering with a 2.0 Å RMSD cutoff does not always preserve side-chain orientations (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. S3</ref>). However, a post hoc division of the cluster based on these subpopulations preserved common side-chain orientations. Random TerMos were created to confirm that the observed clusters were meaningful. For each TerMo with at least 100 members, 1000 sets of randomly selected RPGs wer generated. Each of these randomly generated TerMos had the same number of members as the selected real TerMo. The radius of gyration and solvent accessible surface area were calculated for the real and random TerMos. The probability that a real TerMo could be formed at random was quantified by calculating the percentile of random TerMos with values as far or farther from the mean as the real TerMo.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1">Torsion angles</head><p>To calculate joint densities for angle pairs, we use a Dirichlet process mixture of bivariate von Mises distributions developed previously (<ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Lennox et al., 2009</ref>). For a set of angle pairs (φ i ,ψ i ),i = 1, ... ,n, we consider the model:</p><formula>(φ i ,ψ i )|µ i ,ν i ,, i ∼ p((φ i ,ψ i )|µ i ,ν i i ) (1) (µ i ,ν i ,, i )|G ∼ G (2) G ∼ DP(τH 1 H 2 ) (3)</formula><p>where DP(τG 0 ) is a Dirichlet process with mass parameter τ and centering distribution H 1 H 2. The distributions p and H 1 are bivariate von Mises sine models (<ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Singh et al., 2002</ref>), which are defined as:</p><formula>p((φ,ψ)|µ,ν,) = C exp{a} (4)</formula><p>where a = κ 1 cos(φ −µ)+κ 2 cos(ψ −ν)+λsin(φ −µ)sin(ψ −ν) with</p><formula>C −1 = 4π 2 x m=0 2m m λ 2 4κ 1 κ 2 m I m (κ 1 )I m (κ 2 ) (5) and = κ 1 −λ −λ κ 2 (6)</formula><p>and where I m (x) is the modified Bessel function of the first kind of order m. The distribution H 2 is a 2-dimensional Wishart distribution with parameters α 0 and β 0 , and mean α 0 /(2β 0 ). Note that the definition of the angle pairs as (φ i , ψ i ) is arbitrary, and these distributions are equally valid for the pairs</p><formula>(φ i , χ 1,i ) and (ψ i , χ 1,i</formula><p>). For all distributions of interest, we fit the aforementioned model using the sampling scheme described in<ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Lennox et al. (2009)</ref>. For H 1 , we used prior parameters µ 0 = υ 0 = 0, and was a diagonal matrix with elements 1/180 2. For H 2 , we took α 0 = 2 and β 0 was a 2×2 diagonal matrix with elements equal to 400. For each model fit, we ran two independent chains for 11 000 iterations with the initial 1000 iterations discarded as burn in. Using 1-in20 thinning gave 1000 total samples. We evaluated each distribution on a 360×360 grid of points for plotting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2">Centroid-Cα cartesian coordinates</head><p>The side-chain centroid positions within a TerMo and the Cα positions, as Cartesian coordinates, lend themselves to a kernel density estimation approach. Let our data consist of a set {c i } n i=1 of n RPGs, where each observation c i consists of the coordinates for the atoms from a clique of size m from the i-th RPG. That is c ij = (x ij , y ij , z ij ) for j = 1,...,m. We propose to model the distribution</p><formula>c i+1 ∼ 1 n n j=1 N(c j ,hI 3m ) (7)</formula><p>where the unknown protein c i+1 is distributed as an n-component mixture of 3m-variate normal distributions centered at observed RPG coordinate values and having a covariance matrix given by the 'normal reference rule' (<ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Zhang et al., 2006</ref>). We define the above row vector h of length 3m as:</p><formula>h i = s i 4 (3m+2)n 1/(3m+4) (8)</formula><p>where s i is the standard deviation of the observations in the i-th column of the data matrix.The vector h is then multiplied by I 3m , the 3m-dimensional identity matrix. A TerMos distribution of coordinate positions is a mixture of trivariate normal distributions, denoted as N, defined by the locations of the known RPGs.<ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Starovasnik et al., 1996</ref>). The second helix of protein A has been removed for clarity. (D) Examples of the most populated all loop motif<ref type="bibr">[-C4]</ref>from two loops in a single immunoglobulin light chain structure [1FAI (<ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Lascombe et al., 1992)]</ref>. Their sequence locality is different, 3+1 in black and 1+2+1 in gray, but they are superimposable.largest TerMo involving only helical residues describes the packing of one helix against another (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2C</ref>). This TerMo involves three residues from consecutive turns of one helix (i, i+1, i+4) packing with one residue from another helix (j) and is entirely defined by side-chain to side-chain contacts. The most populated TerMo in helix–sheet packing involves one residue from a helix packing against three residues from two strands of a sheet<ref type="bibr">[H1 E3-]</ref>, and as with the helix–helix packing motif described above, is entirely defined by side-chain to side-chain contacts (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2A</ref>and B). As an example of RPGs clustering from unaligned positions,<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2B</ref>depicts 2<ref type="bibr">[H1 E3-]</ref>RPGs from topologically distinct protein folds. TerMos involving turns and loops are more difficult to describe in terms of sequence separation. In regular secondary structure (i.e. α-helices and β-sheets) the orientations of consecutive residues are strongly correlated, whereas in turns and loops the orientations of consecutive residues are not correlated. Thus, in motifs involving turns and loops, consecutive residues in different RPGs do not necessarily align with each other. As an example,<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2D</ref>shows two loop RPGs from different loops in one immunoglobulin light chain structure. Both loops cluster in the largest all loop (<ref type="bibr">[-C4]</ref>) motif found in the immunoglobulin light chain structure. One of the RPGs is formed by three consecutive residues (i, i+1, i+2) from one loop packed against a residue (j) in another loop whereas the other loop is formed by three non-consecutive residues (i, i+3, i+4) in one loop packed against a residue (j) in a second loop. When the RPGs are aligned (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2D</ref>, inset), residue j from the first RPG aligns with residue i from the other, and the remaining residues i, i+1, and i+2 in the first RPG align with residues i+3, i+4 and j, respectively, in the other.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Dependency on sequence separation</head><p>As introduced by Singh and coworkers (<ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Singh et al., 1996</ref>), tetrahedral RPGs can be grouped into five classes based on the sequence locality of their contacts (<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>). We consider residues in an RPG to be locally consecutive in sequence if they are separated by three or fewer positions. The average number of RPGs in each of these locality groups is a linear function of the protein's length as shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3A</ref>larger proteins' local contacts increase at a faster pace than non-local contacts. The rate at which a protein folds has been shown to be correlated with its contact order, a measure of the sequence locality of contacts (<ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Plaxco et al., 1998</ref>), and these results corroborate the observation that larger proteins decrease in contact order. By collapsing these secondary structure TerMos into their dominant classes of helix, extended, turn, coil and mixed (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3B</ref>), we discover some simple propensities favored by helices and sheets. More detail is provided by Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig. S6</ref>, which shows the populations of each of the five types in<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>binned by the number of secondary structure types in the TerMo. Packing between and within helices favor RPGs with no local contacts (1+1+1+1 class), three local residues (3+1 class) and all local residues (4 class). In all helical residues<ref type="bibr">[H4-]</ref>, the 1+1+1+1 TerMos do not generally indicate that four separate helices are interacting, but rather that four residues in separate turns from two helices pack against each other. The 3+1 TerMos of<ref type="bibr">[H4-]</ref>indicate packing of two helices against each other, where two locally packed residues from one helical turn pick up one local residue from the next turn and pack against a residue from another helix. Somewhat similar trends are shown for helical residues interacting with other types of secondary structure (<ref type="figure">Fig. S6</ref>). We find that these all non-local TerMos are most favored by two helical residues from consecutive turns packing with at least one sheet residue. The 3+1 class is dominated by the packing of three helical residues to any of the other secondary structure conformations (<ref type="bibr">[</ref>). In helices, the all local 4 class is always 2 or 3 helical residues with either turn or coil that are towards the ends of a helix and again exposed to solvent. In direct complement to helical packing, extended sheets favor classes involving two local residues: 2+2 and 1+2+1 (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3B</ref>). The all sheet TerMos<ref type="bibr">[-E4-]</ref>favor the 2+2 class, but not the 1+2+1 class. As detailed in Supplementary<ref type="figure">Figure S6</ref>, The 1+2+1 configuration is dominated by 3 sheet residues packing against a helix<ref type="bibr">[H1 E3-]</ref>, where the sheet residues consist of 2 local residues from 1 strand with the third coming from a neighboring strand. The 2+2 is primarily favored by 2 or more sheet residues packing with either coil or turn (no helix residues are favored). In contrast, secondary structure classes favored in the 1+2+1 arrangement involve at least one sheet residue with one helix residue packing against turn or coil, which includes the [H1 E3-] discussed above. A similar propensity is seen in the 1+1+1+1 all non-local class with the exception that [H1 E3-] does not favor this packing arrangement. In general, turns and coils disfavor all non-local interactions 1+1+1+1. As expected, contacts in turns are dominated by the all local 4 interactions (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3B</ref>). Indeed, TerMos with four consecutive residues are found only in turns and TerMos with 2 or more turn residues display the highest frequencies in the all local 4 arrangement (see Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig. S6</ref>). Similarly, packing between coil elements tends to involve relatively long stretches of local residues, though it is more likely to include one or more non-local residue. Coil has the highest frequency in 3+1 arrangement. This is due to favored contributions from all the predominantly coil classes and is also characteristic of any secondary structure TerMo that involves coil. The 'mixed' category includes situations where two residues or fewer from a secondary structure class pack against other secondary structure classes and shows no strong preferences for any type of primary structure arrangement. Our more detailed explanation of the previous classes encompassed many of the specific instances included in this category.</p></div>

We chose to model a well-populated [H1 E3-] TerMo as it demonstrated the general trends found between local and non-local residues. The angular data provides a representation of the conformational preferences for different TerMos and can be expressed in terms of the torsion angles (χ1,χ2, ...) of their constitutive side chains. In order to relate backbone and side-chain conformational preferences, these χ angles can be related to the backbone φ, ψ angles through Ramachandran-like plots (<ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Ramachandran et al., 1963</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">DISCUSSION</head><p>Our goal in developing the RPG analysis of protein packing and the tertiary motif (TerMo) library of RPG clusters was to produce a construct that provided useful insight and an intuitive representation of the regular tetrahedral elements of protein tertiary structure. This is in contrast to sequence-structure motif finding algorithms, such as I-SITES (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bystroff and Baker, 1998</ref>) and TRILOGY (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Bradley et al., 2002</ref>), which look for structurally similar motifs with well defined sequence patterns primarily within a sequence contiguous secondary/super-secondary structure class or within a maximal contact pattern in protein fold families, respectively. While these methods have been successful in describing specific motifs, we are looking for more general relationships in, for example, how helices pack with sheets. We also draw a distinction between our work and that of Russell and coworkers () and others who have found regular motifs in protein active sites. Solvent accessible surface area calculations indicate that some TerMos are preferentially found on the surface of proteins, but we do not correlate any of our TerMos with specific active sites. The TerMo classification based on sequence locality provides a simple yet general vocabulary to discuss and compare repetitive tertiary structure between proteins of similar or different folds. In the following sections, we discuss the general implications of our findings within the context of current views of protein structure and lastly provide a specific example where our two representations provide a characterization of the tertiary propensities of a TerMo.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Contact Order, packing and protein size</head><p>Protein folding is generally thought of in terms of a funnel, where each unit of structure formed has to gain enough contact energy to overcome the conformational entropy lost in ordering that unit (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bryngelson et al., 1995</ref>). This is why proteins with high contact order fold more slowly than those with low contact order (<ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Plaxco et al., 1998</ref>). In high contact order proteins, long sections of chain must become ordered to form a unit of tertiary structure, leading to a greater loss of entropy and requiring a larger gain in contact energy to balance that loss.

RPGs thus maximize their ability to overcome conformational entropy loss, making them natural packing units. The distribution of RPGs having different sequence locality (e.g. all local 4, all non-local 1+1+1+1, and the three mixed local-nonlocal groups) suggests a limit on the possible packing topologies available to proteins. In a naïve random model, we would expect that the number of RPGs in each locality class would increase at the same rate with increasing protein size. As the protein size increases, however, the relative number of mixed local and non-local (i.e. 3+1, 1+2+1) RPGs increases (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3A</ref>). For every local RPG that is added, one 1+1+1+1, one 2+2, three 1+2+1 and three 3+1 RPGs will be added on average. There are three possible orderings of local and non-local residues in the 1+2+1 RPGs (1+2+1, 2+1+1, 1+1+2), so the increase in the number of 1+2+1 RPGs may still be described by a random model. There are only two possible ways to form a 3+1 RPG (3+1, 1+3), leaving us with the conclusion that packing arrangements in which one residue is packed against a cluster of three local residues are favored in larger proteins. The 3+1 class has the most local contacts of all of the mixed classes with 3 local contacts out of the 6 total contacts (2+2 has 2 of 6, 1+2+1 has 1 of 6). Only the all-local RPGs have more local contacts. Thus, the overall effect of these changes in packing is to decrease the relative contact order of longer proteins, consistent with earlier observations (<ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Ivankov et al., 2003</ref>). The detailed view of packing interactions provided by the TerMos also gives us insight into the differences between naturally occurring proteins and human designed proteins. For example, in most members of the protein G family, only one or two RPGs are within 1.5 Å RMSD of any other RPG from the same protein. In the designed protein L variant 1KH0 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Kuhlman et al., 2002</ref>), however, virtually all of the sheet only (<ref type="bibr">[-E4-]</ref>) RPGs are within 1.5 Å RMSD of each other. The structure derives much of its packing arrangements from the same TerMo. This design did not use a limited amino acid alphabet, so it is likely that this homogeneity is due to certain packing arrangements being excessively favored by the simple energy function used in the design (<ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kuhlman and Baker, 2000</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Tertiary motif depiction</head><p>While we do not have space to go into detail for all the TerMos, we use the well-populated<ref type="bibr">[H1 E3-]</ref>TerMo shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2B</ref>as an example and discuss the insights provided by our two representations of TerMos shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4</ref>. Both density plots are able to capture subtle features of the 1+2+1 packing arrangement that are not necessarily apparent by simple inspection. The gauche-side-chain conformation is favored by the two adjacent positions on the β-strand (i, i+2), whereas in the non-local sheet and the helical positions, both the gauche-and trans conformations are populated. Relating these data to backbone conformational preference, we find in this<ref type="bibr">[H1 E3-]</ref>case that a more negative φ residue angle in sheet conformation tends to shift the side-chain population towards the trans conformation (compare the 3 sheet distributions in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4A</ref>). The kernel density estimation in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 4B</ref>complements the torsion angle plots. The two adjacent positions on the β-strand are more constrained in their packing, as seen by their smaller volumes of density, while the non-local sheet and helical residues exhibit a much larger range of packing conformations. These data<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Gallagher et al., 1994)]</ref>are shown in ball and stick representation, while the backbone is depicted in the classic cartoon ribbon. (B) For the same protein in A, the core residues are replaced with the centers of masses based on Cβ position of the RPGs. Each is color coded according to the sequence locality of interacting residues (see<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>strongly suggests that the structural and sequence variation are largely accommodated by the non-local sheet and helical residues. Of particular interest is that the Cα atoms for the non-local sheet and helical positions exhibit the broadest range of spatial positions. The implication is that sequence changes in this TerMo cause larger backbone changes than side-chain rearrangements, but only for the non-local sheet and helix residues. The two local sheet residues remain more restrained in their backbone and side-chain positions. In this way, the TerMo construct in conjunction with our two representations is able to capture and depict the detailed tendencies for repetitive elements of tertiary structure. While the previous two representations provide a quantitative analysis of TerMo conformations,<ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 5</ref>demonstrates how the sequence locality classification of RPGs simplifies, yet clearly describes tertiary structure. Corroborating our results from<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>, the core of Protein G possesses the dominant classes of locality RPGs (3+1 and 1+2+1) are the major RPGs for the core of Protein G, where the helix favors the 3+1 RPGs and the sheet 1+2+1 RPGs. Also, the 3+1 RPGs are concentrated in the densest area of the helix/sheet packing. Dotting the outside of the core are a single 2+2 and three non-local 1+1+1+1 RPGs. As highlighted by<ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 5</ref>, the tetrahedral clique construct of an RPG describes a basic packing unit of tertiary structure. In conjunction with the sequence locality classification, the RPG becomes an intuitive description of the packing within a protein core. The construct is simple enough for analyses within and between protein folds, but complex enough to capture the uniqueness of individual fold's tertiary structure. By providing a precise vocabulary to discuss tertiary structure, the sequence locality RPG classification has the potential to produce new insight and characterizations of protein tertiary structure.<ref type="bibr">et al.

Because the angular data describes only residue conformations, a complete description of a TerMo also requires information about the positional relationship between the residues. We approximate the residues in a TerMo by considering the positions of the 4 sidechain centroids and 4 backbone Cα's. In this case, we have used a kernel density estimation to model the Cartesian space sampled by the TerMo (see Section 2) and the result is shown by Figure 4B. The modeling of the positional data has many advantages that can be seen by comparing Figure 2A with Figure 4B. The overlay of residues in Figure 2A provides a basic view of the TerMo residues, but the finer features of the data is obscured. The density in Figure 4B defines the orientation of the packing between the residues and their backbones in the TerMo and provides a clear depiction of the volume distribution occupied by the TerMo residues.

			<note place="foot" n="3"> RESULTS 3.1 RPG clustering to tertiary motifs The results of clustering the RPGs to TerMos with a 2.0 Å RMSD cutoff across the SCOP categories (Murzin et al., 1995) are given in Figure 1 and Supplementary Table S1. Our analysis shows that clustering is not random. We calculated the average and sample standard deviations of radius of gyration and solvent accessible surface area for all TerMos and for random sets of RPGs of the same size as the true TerMos. We then calculated the percentiles of the true TerMo statistics relative to the distribution for random RPG clusters. If the clustering were random, the random and real TerMos would have the same values and the distribution of these percentiles would be uniform. As shown in Supplementary Figure S4, the distribution is not uniform, indicating that the clustering is not random. Clustering within the Family level results in a 5-to 50-fold reduction in the number of tertiary motifs (TerMos). TerMo classes with more residues in regular helical and/or sheet secondary structure cluster better than TerMo classes with more irregular coil secondary structure, indicating more ordered packing. The Superfamily level has a smaller decrease in clustering. Many Superfamilies contain only one family, so no further clustering is observed in these cases. This is also true at the Fold level, where there are 10 to 100 times fewer clusters of classification than there are starting RPGs. The next major reduction in the number of clusters occurs at the Class level. Here, 1086 folds are placed in one of seven classes based primarily on their secondary structure, though small proteins, disordered proteins, and membrane proteins have their own classes. This 100-fold reduction in SCOP classifications results in an approximately 7-fold reduction in clusters, indicating that TerMos are relatively dissimilar in different folds. The final level of clustering compares representative structural motifs from different classes and yields another 2.5-fold reduction in the number of clusters. Overall, this agglomerative clustering scheme yields ∼200 clusters per TerMo secondary structure type, with α-helical and β-sheet TerMo classes clustering significantly more consistently than TerMos involving residues from turns and loops. From this final clustering, histograms of TerMo populations along with radii of gyration and solvent accessible surface area are shown in Supplementary Figure S5. Of the over 4 million RPGs, &lt;2% cluster in low populations of under 100 members, while the remaining 98% are 100 members of larger (Supplementary Fig. S5A). These wellpopulated TerMos display a smaller radius of gyration and solvent exposure with tighter distributions than the low populated TerMos (Supplementary Figs S5B and S5C, respectively). The number of different TerMos in a protein domain depends on the size of the domain. On average, the average number of TerMos per residue is 0.27, and 95% of domains have fewer than 0.5 TerMos per residue. The set of TerMos that are common to all domains of a Family, Superfamily, or Fold can be used to distinguish between different Families, Superfamilies, or Folds. We compared the sets of TerMos that were present in at least 90% of the structures in all Families, Superfamilies and Folds with at least 40 members. This resulted in 1404 pairs of Families, 3740 pairs of Superfamilies and 2911 pairs of Folds. There was one pair of Families in this set with identical TerMos (SCOP classes: b.1.1.2 and b.1.1.4) and one pair of Families that share more than 80% of their TerMos (SCOP classes: c.1.8.1 and c.1.8.3). All Fold and Superfamily conserved TerMo sets are unique. Comparing all the TerMo secondary structure classes individually provides the finer details of regular tertiary structure and is summarized in Table S1. To be clear in our discussion of TerMos, we will use a consistent notation, because the packing interactions are defined relative to each residue. Residues that are neighbors or near neighbors in the primary sequence will be referenced against an initial residue i, while non-local contacts will use j, k, &amp; l. The all sheet [-E4-], helix contacting sheet [H1 E3-], and all helix [H4-] TerMos ( Fig. 2A, B and C, respectively) produce the largest clusters with over 100 000 representatives within 2.0 Å RMSD of the representative RPG when clustering is carried across the full PDB. The largest [-E4-] TerMo describes the packing of three consecutive residues of one strand i, i+1, i+2 packing against one residue on the neighboring strand j (Fig. 2A). This TerMo involves side-chain to side-chain contacts between residues i, i+2, and j, as well as side-chain to main-chain contacts to residue i+1, and does not distinguish between parallel and anti-parallel strands.

				<p>Motivation: Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have found many common genetic variants associated with human diseases, it remains a challenge to elucidate the functional links between associated variants and complex traits. Results: We developed a package called eResponseNet by implementing and extending the existing ResponseNet algorithm for prioritizing candidate disease genes through cellular pathways. Using type II diabetes (T2D) as a study case, we demonstrate that eResponseNet outperforms currently available approaches in prioritizing candidate disease genes. More importantly, the package is instrumental in revealing cellular pathways underlying disease-associated genetic variations. Availability: The eResponseNet package is freely downloadable at</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have uncovered hundreds of common genetic variants contributing to human diseases. Various methods have been developed to translate statistical associations into biological functions, such as identification of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) using expression profiles (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Doss et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Heinig et al., 2010</ref>) or prediction of disease causative genes linked with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using biological networks (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Lage et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Wu et al., 2008</ref>). However, it is still an enormous gap to understand the biological mechanisms by which each DNA variation affects disease risk (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Frazer et al., 2009</ref>). Here, to address this gap, we developed a computational package by implementing and extending the ResponseNet algorithm. We showed that the extended package 'eResponseNet' can effectively prioritize candidate disease genes linked to disease-associated SNPs and uncover cellular pathways underlying disease-associated human genetic variations. * To whom correspondence should be addressed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Implementing the ResponseNet</head><p>We implemented the ResponseNet algorithm, originally designed to identify pathways linking genetic screen hits to transcriptional changes (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Yeger-Lotem et al., 2009</ref>), using C/perl language and GLPK package (www.gnu.org/software/glpk). The ResponseNet algorithm is a minimumcost flow optimization algorithm where flow goes from source nodes (genetic hits) to sink nodes (differentially expressed genes) through a weighted network, where each node or edge has been assigned a weight according to its confidence; edges are associated with a capacity that limits the flow and with a cost. The problem can be described as a linear programming formula that minimizes the overall cost of the network when distributing the maximal flow from source nodes to sink nodes (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Yeger-Lotem et al., 2009</ref>) Min</p><formula>⎛ ⎝ i∈V ,j∈V −log(w ij )·f ij ⎞ ⎠ − γ · i∈Source f Si</formula><p>where w ij and f ij represents the weight and the flow of edge connecting gene i and j, respectively; −log(w ij ) represents the cost of the edge; S is an auxiliary node pointing to the source nodes. The choice of the tuning parameter γ primarily determines the size and the quality of the output subnetwork. Higher γ values will allow more connections between the source and the sink genes but with lower confidence (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Yeger-Lotem et al., 2009</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Extending the ResponseNet</head><p>We designed the eResponseNet package to prioritize candidate disease genes or genes associated with a certain phenotype/trait, meanwhile, to predict the molecular interactions among these genes leading to the disease or trait. Instead of fixing the parameter γ to a default value in ResponseNet, we scan through a range of γ values (between 4 and 10 with increments of 0.05) to identify a series of optimal subnetworks from a weighted interactome. Then, to rank each candidate gene's relevance to the disease (network), the candidate genes was assigned a minimal parameter γ when the candidate gene first appears in an optimal subnetwork. The smaller the minimal parameter γ, the higher the priority is given to the gene. A summary of setting parameter γ and the main differences between eResponseNet and ResponseNet is presented in the Supplementary Material.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Prioritizing candidate disease genes</head><p>We used type II diabetes (T2D) as a study case (Supplementary Material) to test the performance of the eResponseNet packagein prioritizing candidate disease genes. All T2D candidate genes surrounding GWAS loci were considered as sources, while significantly differentially expressed genes detected by microarrays as sinks. A series of subnetworks were calculated from a weighted human interactome network integrated from three sources KEGG, HPRD and STRING, upon varying the parameter γ. Each of the candidate genes was assigned a minimal parameter γ (Section 2). As our expectation, the genes assigned with lower γ are preferentially more enriched in genetic association database (GAD) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Becker et al., 2004</ref>)-annotated T2D genes (Supplementary Material) in the subnetworks (Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. S1</ref>). The performance of prioritizing candidate disease genes by the minimal parameter γ in eResponseNet outperforms the gene ranking criteria by the amount of flow used in the original ResponseNet algorithm (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1A</ref>and Supplementary<ref type="figure">Table S1</ref>). Furthermore, in our dataset, its performance is even better than the random walk (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Kohler et al., 2008</ref>) (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1A</ref>), a best-performing algorithm in prioritizing candidate disease genes. By using the genes co-cited with diabetes ('literature diabetes genes', Supplementary Material) as another golden standard positive (GSP) set less biased for GWAS loci, we also confirmed that the performance of eResponseNet was not depending on the particular datasets or GSPs (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1A</ref>and Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig. S2A</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Uncovering cellular pathways underlying T2D-associated genetic variations</head><p>We further examined whether the subnetworks identified by eResponseNet can explain the molecular mechanisms of how these DNA variations affect disease risk. To this end, we found that the mediator genes connecting sources and sinks included many well-known T2D causative genes, such as AR, IFNG and SOCS1 (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1B</ref>and Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig. S2B</ref>), suggesting that some of the genes within T2D-associated loci (e.g. IDE and LEPR) affect T2D susceptibility by acting through or together with the known T2D causative genes. Indeed, our predicted pathways are consistent with reported mouse knock-out phenotypes and molecular interactions in the existing literature (Supplementary Material). In addition, the pathways also linked these genes to other genes previously unknown to affect T2D susceptibility, which are potentially new mediators to the disease. Overall, compared with those in full network, the mediator genes identified by eResponseNet were on average 2-fold more enriched for both the GAD and the literature diabetes genes, with the latter GSP which favors the mediator nodes more than the source nodes (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1C</ref>and Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig. S2C</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">CONCLUSION</head><p>In this article, we present eResponseNet, a package demonstrated effective for prioritizing candidate disease genes and identifying their underlying molecular pathways to human disease. This method apparently can be generalized to analyzing any complex disease and can be used to link any two layers of 'omics' data, including not only the SNPs to gene expression (as described here), but also epigenomic or microRNA data to gene expression, gene expression to proteomic or metabolic data and so on. The eResponseNet output files can be directly visualized in Cytoscape (Supplementary Material).

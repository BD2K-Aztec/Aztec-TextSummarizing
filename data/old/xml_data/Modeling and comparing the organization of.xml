				<p>Motivation: Most prokaryotic genomes are circular with a single chromosome (called circular genomes), which consist of bacteria and archaea. Orthologous genes (abbreviated as orthologs) are genes directly evolved from an ancestor gene, and can be traced through different species in evolution. Shared orthologs between bacterial genomes have been used to measure their genome evolution. Here, organization of circular genomes is analyzed via distributions of shared orthologs between genomes. However, these distributions are often asymmetric and bimodal; to date, there is no joint distribution to model such data. This motivated us to develop a family of bivariate distributions with generalized von Mises marginals (BGVM) and its statistical inference. Results: A new measure based on circular grade correlation and the fraction of shared orthologs is proposed for association between circular genomes, and a visualization tool developed to depict genome structure similarity. The proposed procedures are applied to eight pairs of prokaryotes separated from domain down to species, and 13 mycoplasma bacteria that are mammalian pathogens belonging to the same genus. We close with remarks on further applications to many features of genomic organization, e.g. shared transcription factor binding sites, between any pair of circular genomes. Thus, the proposed procedures may be applied to identifying conserved chromosome backbones, among others, for genome construction in synthetic biology. Availability: All codes of the BGVM procedures and 1000+ prokaryotic genomes are available at</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Most of the prokaryotic genomes (1158 out of 1194, NCBI, August 2010) are circular with a single chromosome (called circular genomes henceforth). Orthologous genes (abbreviated as orthologs)</p><p>are genes directly evolved from an ancestor gene (<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Tatusov et al., 1997</ref>), and can be traced through different species in evolution. The fraction of shared orthologs between two circular genomes was found to be better conserved than the order of genes (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Huynen and Bork, 1998</ref>), in which the fraction of shared orthologs between genomes was employed to measure genome evolution of nine prokaryotes. Here, our emphasis is on the structure of circular genomes, which, for example, plays an important role in synthetic biology. A review paper in synthetic genomics (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Carrera et al., 2009</ref>) indicates that genome organization may influence gene expression, which is vital for organisms. Further, predicting or modeling the rules of genome organization via comparative genomics may provide valuable information for genome construction. We reason that genome structure can be studied via distributions of shared orthologs between genomes, e.g. the most or least favored region in which shared orthologs between each pair of bacterial genomes are located. While the marginal distributions of shared orthologs are often found to be asymmetric and bimodal, to date there is no joint distribution with closed-formed marginals to model such data. This motivated us to develop a family of joint distribution and its related statistical inferences. Recent studies show that gene order is extensively conserved between closely related species, but rapidly become less conserved among more distantly related species. This trend is likely to be universal in prokaryotes (<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Tamames, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Wolf et al., 2001</ref>). However, the fraction of shared orthologs between two circular genomes is more conserved than the order of genes (see<ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>of<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Huynen and Bork, 1998</ref>). In addition to the fraction of shared orthologs between bacterial genomes, we further incorporate the distributions of shared orthologs of paired circular genomes to infer similarity of their genome organization. By converting the locations of shared orthologs in any paired circular genomes into angles, these pairs of angles can be viewed as bivariate circular vectors. Most of the marginal distributions of shared orthologs in circular genomes are asymmetric and/or multimodal, which can be modeled by the generalized von Mises distribution (GVM) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Maksimov, 1967;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Yfantis and Borgman, 1982</ref>). Therefore, we propose a family of bivariate circular distributions with each marginal assuming a GVM distribution, and call this family the bivariate generalized von-Mises (BGVM). The inference procedures, estimation of the parameters in BGVM and testing for independence of structures of paired circular genomes, are developed. A novel correlation measure, which is based on the fraction of shared orthologs and a circular grade correlation derived here, is introduced to measure organization<ref type="bibr">[</ref></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Modeling and comparing circular genomes</head><p>similarity between circular genomes. Furthermore, this similarity is visually depicted by the rose diagrams of shared orthologs. The marginal distributions of BGVM are quite flexible since GVM can model either symmetric or asymmetric, unimodal or multimodal circular data, depending on the values of its four parameters. The probability density function (pdf) of GVM is in closed form and thus is convenient for inferences; see Yfantis and Borgman (1982) for details. In the following, we briefly review literature on modeling bivariate circular data, e.g. shared orthologs of paired prokaryotic genomes.<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Thompson (1975)</ref>mentioned the wrapped bivariate normal distribution.<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Mardia (1975)</ref>proposed a generalized von Mises–Fisher model for paired angles (θ 1 ,θ 2 ). Wehrly and Johnson (1980) generated families of bivariate circular distributions with jpdf:</p><formula>f (θ 1 ,θ 2 ) = 2πg{2π[F 1 (θ 1 )−F 2 (θ 2 )]}f 1 (θ 1 )f 2 (θ 2 ), (1)</formula><p>wheredistribution. Unfortunately, the marginals of these distributions are symmetric and unimodal, hence they cannot be employed to model distributions of shared orthologs in paired circular genomes. Bivariate circular distributions with asymmetric and/or multimodal but closed-formed marginals have not been well explored, thus we study them here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">METHODS</head><p>Here, we investigate inference procedures under BGVM which has the probability density function:</p><formula>f j (θ j ) = C j −1 e κ j cos(θ j −µ j )+λ j cos[2(θ j −ν j )] for j = 1,2, where C j −1 = 2π{I 0 (κ j )I 0 (λ j )+2 ∞ n=1 I n (λ j )I 2n (κ j )·cos[2n(µ j −ν j )]</formula><p>}. These µ j and ν j (κ j and λ j ) are location (dispersion) parameters, and we denote this GVM distribution as GVM (µ j ,ν j ,κ j ,λ j ) henceforth. The joint density BGVM involves the cumulative distributions F j</p><formula>(θ 0 ) = θ 0 0 f j (θ)</formula><p>dθ, but with todays computing power this is not a serious drawback. We note that this class of bivariate circular distributions can include other marginals, e.g. t-distribution (<ref type="bibr">Shimizu and Iida, 2002</ref>), von Mises distribution (<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Shieh and Johnson, 2005</ref>) and Jones and Pewsey's distribution (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Jones and Pewsey, 2005</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Roles of some parameters in the BGVM model</head><p>The parameters κ and λ in a GVM (µ,ν,κ,λ) marginal control not only the concentration at θ = µ and θ = ν but also the graphic shape of the density. If κ = 0, the GVM is antipodally symmetric and has two modes, depending on λ, at θ = ν and θ = ν±π. If λ = 0, the GVM reduces to the von Mises distribution, which is symmetric and unimodal, with mean direction µ and concentration κ; the larger κ is the more concentrated when the distribution is at µ. If µ 12 = 0 , the BGVM is a unimodal distribution, and as κ 12 increases the association between 1 and 2 increases, which indicates that the association between the given pair of circular genomes increases. From the copula representation in Section 2 of<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Shieh et al. (2006)</ref>, we have that 1 = 2πF 1 ( 1 ) given θ 2 is VM (µ 12 +2πF 2 (θ 2 ),κ 12 ). When µ 12 = 0, 1 centers on 2πF 2 (θ 2 ), and the dependence of 1 on 2 is controlled by the magnitude of κ 12. A BGVM generator written in R is available at http//:www.stat.sinica.edu .tw/∼gshieh/bgvm.htm.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">MLEs of the parameters</head><p>Assuming that shared orthologs between a pair of circular genomes follow a BGVM distribution, given their converted angles we can immediately obtain the fitted BGVM distribution by applying the MLE algorithm in MLE_LR-test.R of the Supplementary Material. The MLE algorithm was modified from the Newton–Raphson method (<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Tanner, 1996</ref>), to prevent the estimates for the model in Equation (2) being trapped in local maxima, which was caused by the sinusoidal functions in the joint density. Next, we derive the limiting distribution of MLEs for the parameters in BGVM. The likelihood ratio test for independence of the organization between genomes is addressed at the end of this section. To see how the MLE algorithm performs, we show its estimation results using data generated from BGVM with the parameters</p><formula>(µ 1 ,ν 1 ,κ 1 ,λ 1 ,µ 2 , ν 2 ,κ 2 ,λ 2 ,µ 12 ,κ 12 ) = ( π 2 , π 2 ,1,1, π 2 , πthen ={0 ≤ µ i &lt; 2π, 0 ≤ κ i &lt; ∞,0 ≤ ν i &lt; 2π, 0 ≤ λ i &lt; ∞,0 ≤ µ 12 &lt; 2π,0 ≤ κ 12 &lt; ∞ },</formula><p>for i = 1,2.

Asymptotic multivariate normality of the MLEs then follows from Lemma 1 and Theorem 2 of<ref type="bibr">Self and Liang (1987)</ref>, which indicates that this centered vector converges to a multivariate normal distribution as stated below.where I is the Fisher information matrix with entries</p><formula>I ik (η) = E ∂ ∂η i lnf 12 ( 1 ,, 2 |η ) ∂ ∂η k lnf 12 ( 1 ,, 2 |η ) .</formula><p>The 10 partial derivatives are straightforward and are omitted.where each partial derivative is evaluated at the MLEs. Different asymptotics apply if we include κ 12 = 0 in the parameter space. If κ i and λ i , i = 1,2 are still bounded away from 0, then according to the results in Self and<ref type="bibr">Liang (1987)</ref>, Theorem 2 and Case 2 of page 606, √ nˆκnˆκ 12 has limiting distribution</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">A novel circular correlation measure r pg</head><p>Huynen and Bork (1998) used the fraction of shared orthologs between genomes to study genome evolution. The ratio of shared orthologs between a pair of genomes to the maximum possible number of shared orthologs, which is estimated by the size of the smaller genome in each pair of genomes, is a reasonable index for association of organization between circular genomes. This ratio (denoted by r p ) can be written asTo characterize association between a pair of circular genomes more finely, the similarity of their distributions of shared orthologs should be taken into account. This association can be measured by a circular grade correlation (r g ) derived in the next subsection. Weighting both r p and r g equally gives rise to a novel circular correlation measure</p><formula>r p =</formula><formula>r pg = 1 2 (r p +r g ).</formula><p>Note that there is a parameter, namely protein sequence similarity, involved when choosing one-to-one orthologs between genomes. The rule of thumb is to choose a protein sequence similarity value such that r p and r g are of the same scale, e.g. 0.7 was suggested for the threshold of protein sequence similarity in a pilot study, in which the BGVM procedures were applied to the nine prokaryotic genomes in Application 1.</p></div>

Next, we estimated the association of genome organizations of each of the eight pairs of prokaryotes. Note that the origins of most prokaryotic genomes are unknown (and having no rules to predict) or predicted, which demonstrates the importance of r pg 's being invariant to the origins of both circular genomes. The values of r p , r g and r pg of these pairs (in<ref type="figure" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>) are incidentally consistent with their phylogeny relationships.

			<note place="foot">paralogs may share the same COG ID. That is, there are one-to-many, many-to-one and many-to-many corresponding shared orthologs besides the one-to-one corresponding ones. Using the following minimum angle distance, we can identify one-to-one shared orthologs. Let D(A,B) denote the distance between orthologs A and B, and D(A,B) = min{|angle of A−angle of B|,2π −|angle of A− angle of B|}. For an orthologous set (multiple paralogs with the same COG ID), we use the shortest distance ortholog pairs (A,B), where D min (A, B) = min i,j D(A i ,B j ) and 1 ≤ i ≤ m, 1 ≤ j ≤ n, provided that m and n are orthologs in genomes A and B corresponding to one COG ID. Let θ ij and θ kj for 1 ≤ j ≤ n, denote the corresponding angle of the first base of the shared ortholog j in genomes i and k, which were used for statistical inferences. Note that within any given pair of genomes, the locations of distinct ortholog pairs are assumed to be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples. Because marginals of shared ortholog genomes were often found to be asymmetric and bimodal, we fitted a BGVM model to each pair of shared orthologs for the prokaryotic genomes studied. In the following, we apply the proposed BGVM procedures and rose diagrams to two sets of prokaryotic genomes, consisting of eight pairs of prokaryotic genomes separated from domain down Fig. 1.

			<note place="foot">In this application, we compare the structure organizations for each of the following pairs of bacterial genomes, which are (Thermotoga, Sulfolobus), (Clostridium, Thermotoga), (Lactobacillus, Clostridium), (Staphylococcus, Lactobacillus), (Oceanobacillus, Staphylococcus), (Bacillus, Oceanobacillus), (Bacillus anthracis, Bacillus subtitlis) and (Bacillus anthracis Ames, Bacillus anthracis Sterne). These pairs of genomes belong to different domains, the same domain, phylum class, order, family, genus and the same species, respectively. Among them, we first tested whether the genome structures of each pair are independent or not. After using the threshold of 0.7 for protein similarity to identify shared orthologs between each pair of genomes, we plotted their rose diagrams, which showed that several of the marginals are bimodal. Due to a space limit, only the rose diagrams (using a binwidth of 10 • ) of the first three pairs are presented in Figure 1; see Supplementary Figure S1 in Application1.pdf for all rose diagrams. Some marginal distributions of these pairs of bacterial genomes were asymmetric, based on the result of the test for symmetry in Pewsey (2002). For instance, some marginals of (Thermotoga, Sulfolobus), (Clostridium, Thermotoga) and (Lactobacillus, Clostridium) are asymmetric at the 95% significance level; see Table 1 for details. For asymmetric and bimodal marginals of shared orthologs, it was reasonable to fit GVM distributions. Goodness-of-fit was checked by QQ-plots, similar to those in Shieh et al. (2006), which indicated that the fits were adequate for the marginals. For the fitted GVMs and QQ-plots, please see the file at http://www.stat.sinica .edu.tw/∼gshieh/bgvm.htm. The asymmetry and bimodality of the marginals suggested fitting a BGVM to shared orthologs for each pair of prokaryotic genomes. The MLE estimates of parameters in BGVM of (Thermotoga, Sulfolobus), (Clostridium, Thermotoga) and (Lactobacillus, Clostridium) are given in Table 2. Employing the LR-test based on the distributions of shared orthologs, we test whether genome organization of each pair of these prokaryotes are independent. (Not) rejecting this hypothesis indicates that their genome organizations are (not) correlated. For each pair of prokaryotic genomes, a LR-test of shared orthologs was computed, and the result showed that except (Thermotoga, Sulfolobus), the hypothesis was rejected for the other seven pairs at a 95% level using Case 2; see Application1.pdf of the Supplementary Material for details. This result indicates that for these seven pairs, their genome organizations are correlated based on the similarity</note>

			<note place="foot" n="4"> DISCUSSION The proposed BGVM distribution, with flexible and closed-formed marginal distributions, was shown to model paired angular data well, in which each marginal of the pair can be asymmetric or/and multimodal, e.g. shared orthologs between paired bacterial genomes. Statistical inferences employing the MLEs for parameters of the BGVM distribution and the LR-test for independence of the organization between circular genomes are established. A novel circular correlation measure (r pg ), invariant to the choices of origins of circular genomes which are mainly unknown or predicted, was derived and a visualization tool provided. We applied these procedures to two sets of prokaryotic genomes, consisting a set of relatively distant prokaryotes and a set of closely related bacteria. The novel correlation measure r pg was shown to 917 at :: on August 30, 2016 http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from</note>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Modeling and comparing circular genomes</head><p>The pairwise rose diagrams (with a binwidth of 10 @BULLET ) of these 13 bacterial genomes showed that several of the marginals were bimodal and asymmetric; see http://www.stat.sinica.edu .tw/∼gshieh/bgvm.htm for details. Hence, we fitted a BGVM distribution to the shared orthologs for each pair of bacterial genomes. Next, the correlation measure r pg was applied to these genomes to result in the values in. Interestingly, these associations are consistent with those measured based on similarity of their 16S rRNAs. Among these 13 bacterial genomes, the top few correlated pairs in terms of r pg are (M.genitalium G37, M.pneumoniae M129), (M.hyopneumoniae J, M.hyopneumoniae 7448), (M.hyopneumoniae 232, M.hyopneumoniae 7448) and (M.hyopneumoniae 232, M.hyopneumoniae J), whose values are equal to 0.77, 0.71, 0.69 and 0.67, respectively. The latter three pairs are hyopneumoniae, which cause chronic disease in pigs and attach to the same organ (lung cilia). From the rose diagrams of these hyopneumoniae in, we can see that their genome structures are quite similar in terms of shared orthologs. The most favored regions of their shared orthologs are 80 @BULLET −90 @BULLET , (20 @BULLET −30 @BULLET and 330 @BULLET −340 @BULLET ) and (20 @BULLET −30 @BULLET and 330 @BULLET −340 @BULLET ), respectively, in which 23, (16 and 17) and (14 and 16) genes are in common, respectively. Among these genes, the largest common functional group is translation, and their gene orders are also conserved. For details, please see Supplementary Tables S1 and S2 in Application2.pdf. In particular, the rose diagrams of (M.hyopneumoniae J, M.hyopneumoniae 7448) clearly depict their similarity in genome organization, and the most and least favored regions of shared orthologs are 80 @BULLET −90 @BULLET and 150 @BULLET −160 @BULLET , respectively. The genes located in the most favored region, encode ribosomal subunit proteins 30S and 50S, which are essential genes and are known to cluster together to form an operon structure in many bacterial genomes (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bratlie et al., 2010</ref>).Moreover, the aforementioned relationships depicted by rose diagrams are consistent with those of the other analysis on genome organization (Application2.pdf of the Supplementary Material). Thus, our procedures may provide useful information on comparing the organization of circular genomes and genome construction in synthetic biology.</p></div>			</div>

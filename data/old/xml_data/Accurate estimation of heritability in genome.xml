				<p>Motivation: Random effects models have recently been introduced as an approach for analyzing genome wide association studies (GWASs), which allows estimation of overall heritability of traits without explicitly identifying the genetic loci responsible. Using this approach, Yang et al. (2010) have demonstrated that the heritability of height is much higher than the ∼10% associated with identified genetic factors. However, Yang et al. (2010) relied on a heuristic for performing estimation in this model. Results: We adopt the model framework of Yang et al. (2010) and develop a method for maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation in this framework. Our method is based on Monte-Carlo expectation-maximization (MCEM; Wei et al., 1990), an expectation-maximization algorithm wherein a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach is used in the E-step. We demonstrate that this method leads to more stable and accurate heritability estimation compared to the approach of Yang et al. (2010), and it also allows us to find ML estimates of the portion of markers which are causal, indicating whether the heritability stems from a small number of powerful genetic factors or a large number of less powerful ones.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Many complex traits display a remarkable gap between the overall genetic variance estimated by population studies (such as twin studies) and the variance explained by specific genetic variants identified by genome wide association studies (GWASs). This gap has been coined the 'dark matter' of heritability (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Manolio et al., 2008</ref>). Suggested explanations for this gap include gene–gene and gene-environment interactions (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Manolio et al., 2008;</ref>), unidentified by the univariate GWAS scheme, though some of these explanations have been refuted by studies (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Hill et al., 2008</ref>). Height, being a trait that is easy to measure but genetically complex, has attracted special attention. Heritability of height, defined as the portion of height variability due to genetic factors, was estimated at around 80% (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Macgregor et al., 2006;</ref>) while the tens of specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified by large-scale GWASs account for only 10% of the heritability (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Gudbjartsson et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Lettre et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Weedon et al., 2008</ref>). Extrapolating from these data, under specific statistical assumptions,<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Goldstein (2009)</ref>estimated the number of causal SNPs affecting height at 93 000, which is at the high end of reasonable values.<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Yang et al. (2010)</ref>recently suggested the use of random effects models as a multivariate approach for estimating the heritability of * To whom correspondence should be addressed. height directly from GWAS data. In their model, each individual's height is affected by a genetic random effect, which is correlated across individuals by virtue of sharing some of the genetic variants affecting height, and an environmental random effect, which is uncorrelated across individuals. Consistent with the common definition, they define heritability as the ratio of the variance of the genetic random effect to the total variance. Using a straightforward maximum-likelihood approach for estimating heritability in this model requires knowledge of the identity of the causal SNPs, and hence the covariance matrix. This is of course not available, so<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Yang et al. (2010)</ref>approximate the genetic correlation between every pair of individuals across the set of causal SNPs by the genetic correlation across the set of all genotyped SNPs. Using this approximation they estimate the heritability of height at 45%. By adding some further assumptions about the nature and distribution of the causative SNPs they obtain heritability estimates of 56% and 80%. While the random effects approach proposed by<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Yang et al. (2010)</ref>is innovative and appropriate, the concept of using an estimated correlation matrix instead of the actual correlation matrix is a questionable heuristic. The very large number of SNPs used for estimating the genetic correlations—most of them likely not causative—might mask out the correlations on the set of causal SNPs. As we show below, this indeed leads to inaccurate and suboptimal estimation of heritability. Instead, we propose here to treat the identity of the causal SNPs as missing data, and find true maximum-likelihood estimates of our parameters of interest in this setting. Towards this end, we develop an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for this problem. Because of the exponentially large data space, we employ Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for the estimation of the E-step. This approach is known as Markov-chain expectationmaximization (MCEM;<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Wei et al., 1990</ref>). We also develop an efficient optimization approach for the M-step, based on spectral decomposition of the estimated covariance matrix. The resulting algorithm is computationally intensive, yet tractable for reasonably sized problems, as we demonstrate. As a by-product of our approach, we also get maximum-likelihood estimates of the portion of genotyped SNPs that are causative in the random effect model. This represents independently useful information, as it indicates whether the estimated heritability is likely due to a small number of large genetic effects, or a large number of smaller effects. For example, this knowledge may be useful in planning further studies to identify these specific factors. We empirically demonstrate using simulations that our method, in addition to being theoretically sound, does indeed lead to significantly more accurate estimation of heritability than the heuristic approach of<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Yang et al.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Random effect models of genetic causality</head><p>We first describe the random effects model proposed by<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Yang et al. (2010)</ref>. Assume we have n individuals with their quantitative phenotype (say, height) denoted by y j , j = 1...n, and we know there are m genetic factors affecting the phenotype, as described by the following model:</p><formula>y j = µ+ m i=1 z ij u i +e j ,</formula><p>where z ij is the value of the i-th causative SNP of the j-th individual after standardization, i.e.</p><formula>z ij = x ij −2p i √ 2p i (1−p i )</formula><p>where x ij is the actual genotype and p i is the minor allele frequency (MAF), so E(z ij ) = 0 and V (z ij ) = 1. u i ∼ N(0,σ 2 u ) is the effect of the i-th SNP on height. e j ∼ N(0,σ 2 e ) is the environmental effect which is assumed to be i.i.d. across individuals. µ is the mean term, that is typically assumed to be known and equal to 0 (i.e. it has been subtracted), and m is the number of causal SNPs. Defining g j = m i=1 z ij u i as the genetic random effect of individual j, the genetic variance is given by var(</p><formula>g j ) = σ 2 g = mσ 2 u , and cov(g j ,g k ) = σ 2 u n i=1 z ij z ik = σ 2 g m n i=1 z ij z ik .</formula><p>From here it follows that y ∼ N(0,Gσ 2 g +Iσ 2 e ) where G = 1 m ZZ T and Z is the genotypes matrix. G can be interpreted as the genetic correlation matrix. Heritability, or the share of the genetic variance in the overall variance, is given by</p><formula>h 2 = σ 2 g σ 2 g +σ 2 e</formula><p>. All that is needed for maximum-likelihood estimation of h 2 using standard random effects regression approaches (<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Searle et al., 1992</ref>) is the genetic correlation matrix G and the phenotypes vector y.<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Yang et al.

This can be thought of as regressing G on A and replacing A with the conditional expectation of G given A. After obtaining the A * matrix,<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Yang et al.

As we discuss later, this heuristic is statistically unbased and introduces substantial error to the estimation. We thus seek a more rigorous estimation approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Missing data representation of the problem</head><p>We wish to treat the identity of the causal SNPs as missing data, and therefore assume each SNP is causal with probability p. It is convenient to think about the set of causal SNPs as a bit mask represented by the number c with that bit mask as a binary representation. So 0 represents no causal SNPs while 2 N −1 means all SNPs are causal (where N is the number of genotyped SNPs), and the probability of observing a causal SNPs set c is p(c) = p #c (1−p) N−#c where #c is the number of causal SNPs in c. We denote by G(c) the genetic correlation matrix based on the causal SNPs in c.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.7">Simulation settings</head><p>In order to test our method on data with realistic LD structure, we used HapGen (<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Spencer et al., 2009</ref>) to simulate 700 genotypes of 10 000 SNPs each, roughly corresponding to every 10th SNP of the first 100 000 HapMap SNPs on chromosome 1, thus simulating the same SNP density as in the data used by<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Yang et al. (2010)</ref>. Given a desired proportion of causal SNPs p and a set of variances σ 2 g ,σ 2 e , each SNP was chosen to be causal with probability p independently of other SNPs. Following that, the genetic correlation matrix G was calculated, and the phenotypes were sampled from N(0,Gσ 2 g +Iσ 2 e ). It is important to note that, due to the randomization process, setting the value</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D.Golan and S.Rosset</head><p>of σ 2 g ,σ 2 e or p to a certain value does not necessarily imply that the actual values of the parameters in-sample would be the same. To avoid confusion, we use the term 'population value' to note the value of the parameters used to generate the data, and 'in-sample value' to note the parameters in each sample. The length of the burn-in period of each MCMC step, which is used to estimate the E-step, was determined using Geweke's convergence diagnostics (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Geweke, 1992</ref>). We then collected 2000 samples by taking every 500th sample from the MCMC process before proceeding to the M-step. We began by studying the convergence of the MCEM estimators. Towards this end, we set the expected variances to σ 2 g = σ 2 e = 1 and simulated a single set of phenotypes. Then, initializing the proportion of causal SNPs (denoted p 0 ) at its population value p, we set the initial estimators of the variance components to a range of values between 0.2 and 2 (in 0.2 intervals) thus creating a 10×10 grid of initial values around the expected values. We then ran the algorithm for 7 iterations. This exercise was repeated once with p = 1% and once with p = 0.1%. A similar exercise was carried out to study the convergence properties of the estimator of the proportion of causal SNPsˆpSNPsˆ SNPsˆp, initializing the variance components estimators to their expected values and setting the actual proportion of causal SNPs to p = 0.5%, we then set p 0 to a range of values from 0.1% to 1% (in 0.1% intervals). As mentioned earlier, the method suggested by<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Yang et al. (2010)</ref>approximates the actual genetic correlation matrix G by a modification to the observed correlation matrix A, which is the correlation across all genotyped SNPs, causal and non-causal alike. With this in mind, we wanted to compare the methods in scenarios where this approximation is appropriate, i.e. when the proportion of causal SNPs is high, and in scenarios when the approximation would be very different from the actual G matrix, i.e. when the proportion of causal SNPs is very small. We therefore defined a 'high' proportion of causal SNPs to be 1% of SNPs, and a 'low' proportion of causal SNPs to be 0.1% of SNPs and ran two sets of 50 simulations each. In the first set, we set p = p 0 = 1%, while in the second we set p = p 0 = 0.1%. It is important to stress that the actual number of causal SNPs in each simulation run is not fixed to the value of p, but is distributed Bin(p,N) with N being the total number of SNPs. This means that in the aforementioned simulations the initial estimate of the proportion of causal SNPs was not necessarily the 'correct' (in-sample) estimate, but only close to the true value. To test the robustness of our method to the initial estimate of the proportion of causal SNPs, we ran two more sets of simulations, one where p = 1% and p 0 = 0.1%, and one where p = 0.1% and p 0 = 1%. The four simulation scenarios were labeled A,B,C and D, respectively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">RESULTS</head><p>We first study the convergence properties of the MCEM algorithm. As can be seen in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>, convergence is achieved after a relatively small number of iterations, after which the estimators are almost identical, independent of their starting points. Clearly, some level of variance is expected due to the stochastic nature of the MCMC approximation of the E-step, and could therefore be reduced by either taking more samples or averaging over several consecutive MCEM iterations. The number of EM iterations required for convergence did not vary greatly even when the proportion of the causal SNPs was low (data not shown). We have also found that the lengths of burn-in periods, as determined by the Geweke (1992) algorithm varied greatly between simulations and between consecutive iterations of the MCEM algorithm. In general, we have found that burn-in periods were longer when the proportion of causal SNPs was high, and shorter when the estimators were closer to their true value.The estimators of the proportion of causal SNPs converged much slower, but did display convergence, as can be seen in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>. Starting from the 10 starting points that spread uniformly in the range (0.1%,1%), all 10 estimators were in the range (0.4%,0.7%) within 7 iterations. We noticed that the in-sample variances, and hence the in-sample heritability, varied greatly between simulations, especially when the number of causal SNPs was small. Thus, to compare the methods we first calculated the difference between the in-sample heritability (as estimated using the actual genetic correlation matrix G generated in</p><formula>(a) (b) (c)</formula></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Estimation of the proportion of causal SNPs</head><p>In scenarios A and B, in which the estimators of the proportion of causal SNPs were initialized to a value close to the true in-sample proportion, the estimators quickly converged. For the estimation error, the 95% confidence intervals (the difference between the estimated proportion and the in-sample proportion) are given by (−0.098%,0.075%) and (−0.013%,0.2%) for scenarios A and B, respectively (using inter-quantile range). In scenarios C and D, the estimators of the proportion of causal SNPs did not seem to converge, but in both cases all 100 estimators were closer to the expected value than the starting point, suggesting that given enough running time they, too, would have converged. Convergence was slower for scenario C, probably explaining the non significant change in heritability estimation error variance. The 95% confidence intervals for the estimation error of the proportion of causal SNPs in scenarios C and D are given by (−0.69%,−0.53%) and (−0.2%,0.6%), respectively. Note that in both cases the estimation error is significantly smaller than the estimation error of the initial estimator, which is 0.9%. We suspect that the high LD between SNPs allows finding sets of SNPs with different sizes which lead to a similar genetic correlation matrix, for example, by adding SNPs which are approximately a convex linear combination of other SNPs. We believe this slows the convergence of the estimators of the proportion of causal SNPs, and can be solved by running more iterations of the MCEM algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D.Golan and S.Rosset</head><p>depends on the likelihood ratio. We thus expect the MCMC to visit often high-likelihood areas of the search space, corresponding to combinations of candidate causal SNPs that lead to good estimation. The M-step combines all these good combinations to estimate the parameters. Convergence of EM in general, and MCEM in particular, to the true maximum-likelihood estimates is hard to guarantee and test (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Boyles, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Wu, 1983</ref>). Our simulations present evidence that the estimators of the variance components and heritability do, in fact, converge quickly to the neighborhood of the true value of the parameters, and provide some evidence that the estimator of the proportion of causal SNPs also converges. Some variance of the estimators is of course due to the Monte-Carlo nature of the MCMC approximation of the E-step and can be reduced either by taking more samples from the MCMC process, or by averaging consecutive EM iterations. More extensive research and simulations would be required to establish clear criteria for how long to run the algorithm in order to obtain optimal tradeoff between accuracy and computation time. Putting aside the theoretical difficulties with convergence of EM, maximum-likelihood estimates possess many desirable qualities, which facilitate accurate estimation and statistical inference (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Lehmann and Casella, 1998</ref>). In particular they are consistent and asymptotically normal. Moreover, once the process converges we can easily extract the information matrix (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Meilijson, 1989</ref>), with which we can construct asymptotically accurate confidence intervals and carry out proper statistical inference. Running times of the MCEM estimation are governed by two main factors: the number of individuals and the number of genotyped SNPs. Our current simulations have dealt with a toy example of 700 individuals and 10000 SNPs. Current running times of the MCEM algorithm would render it difficult, but not impossible, to estimate the heritability when using a realistic number of genotyped SNPs. Since the lion's share of running time is 'wasted' on burnin iterations (over 90% in most runs) before the MCMC process converges (as indicated by the convergence diagnostics of<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Geweke, 1992</ref>), we believe that smarter initialization of the MCMC process could reduce running times by an order of magnitude or more. Increasing the number of individuals is more problematic, as the time-complexity is cubic in the number of individuals, since every MCMC step involves computing the likelihood, and hence the inversion of a n×n matrix. We have shown that with even a small number of individuals our method produces very accurate estimates. Moreover, as noted earlier, the main bottleneck of the estimation is the eigenvector–eigenvalue decomposition, which is done in each MCMC iteration. The time complexity of this decomposition can be reduced from O(n 3 ) to O(n 2 ) using parallel algorithms (see, for example,<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bientinesi et al., 2006</ref>). We therefore believe that using the MCEM method for heritability estimation in realistic databases is definitely feasible. It is also appealing to think of replacing the 'soft' EM scheme we propose by a 'hard' EM, where in each M-step the parameters are estimated using the combination of SNPs with the highest likelihood encountered. In this case the Metropolis algorithm represents a simulated annealing optimization scheme. This setup has the advantage of also offering a possible identification of the set of causal SNPs, in addition to parameter estimation. We also expect such an approach to dramatically reduce running times. However, the hard approach is not a proper EM algorithm and is not as theoretically based as the standard EM approach. Therefore, it does not possess the favorable properties of EM estimators. We aim to study this alternative as means of reducing running times. Another alternative is to adopt a Bayesian approach altogether, as suggested by Guan,Y. and Stephens,M. (submitted for publication). The two approaches are not necessarily exclusive, as one might use the Bayesian estimate as a good starting point for the MCEM algorithm to reduce running times. In this article, we have concentrated on the application of random effects linear regression models for estimating heritability of quantitative traits like height. While this application area is clearly important, many of the phenotypes of interest in current research are dichotomous, like disease status. The extension to the linear regression approach that would apply in such cases would be to apply random-effects generalized linear models (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Breslow and Clayton, 1993</ref>), such as logistic regression. This direction presents significant complications because of fundamental differences in the statistical setup between linear random effects models and their generalized counterparts and the complexities involved in estimation methods of the latter (for example a MCEM algorithm by<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">McCulloch, 1990</ref>). We intend to pursue this direction further in future work.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig.1.</head><figDesc>Fig. 1.

A: p = p 0 = 1%, B: p = p 0 = 0.1%, C: p = 1%,p 0 = 0.1% and D: p = 0.1%,p 0 = 1%. our simulation) and the heritability estimates obtained by the Yang et al. (2010) method and our method. An advantage of this variability of in-sample heritability is that we, in fact, compared the methods over wide range of heritability values ranging from ∼ 0.2 to ∼ 0.8, and not just for 0.5. When comparing the heritability estimators obtained after 5 MCEM iterations to the estimators obtained by the Yang et al. (2010) method (Fig. 3), we found that in sets A and B, where the initial estimators of the proportion of causal SNPs were set close to the insample proportion, our method significantly reduced the variance of the heritability estimation errors (p &lt; 0.03 in both cases using Bartlett&apos;s test (Snedecor and Cochran, 1989)). It is important to note that while the performance of the method of Yang et al. (2010) deteriorates as the proportion of causal SNPs decreases, our method is more robust to such differences. The heritability estimation errors of Yang et al. (2010) in scenario A, where the proportion of causal SNPs is high, display a significantly lower variance than the heritability estimation errors of the same method in scenario B, when the proportion of causal SNPs is low (p &lt; 10 −3 ). This is reasonable, as a lower proportion of causal SNPs means that the approximation of G used by the method of Yang et al. (2010) is less appropriate. Our method explicitly models the causal SNPs, and therefore we expected it to be less affected by this problem. Indeed, while our method does show higher estimation error variance in scenario B, the difference between the variances in scenarios A and B is not significant. When initializing the estimate of the proportion of causal SNPs at a very different value, as in scenarios C and D, we saw a significant reduction in heritability estimation error from using our method only for scenario D (p &lt; 0.03). We suspect this is due to slow convergence of the estimators of p in scenario C, as discussed later. It is also interesting to note that the estimation errors of the environmental random effects variance were smaller than the estimation errors of the genetic random effects variance. This was true for both methods and for all simulation scenarios, as well as for the convergence studies we conducted earlier. We suggest that this is because the environmental random effects are uncorrelated while the genetic random effects are correlated (with G as the correlation matrix) and thus provide a more difficult estimation problem.</note>

			<note place="foot" n="4"> DISCUSSION The idea of using random effects models for analyzing genetic data is appealing and powerful. Even when only tag SNPs are genotyped, the high LD between tag SNPs and ungenotyped SNPs allows us to expect it to yield accurate results. However, the method suggested by Yang et al. (2010) might carry some hidden pitfalls. Replacing the correct genetic correlation matrix by a different matrix estimated from the data as if the latter matrix were the correct matrix is unfounded statistically. Indeed, using the A * matrix as the variance– covariance matrix introduces two additional sources of variance to the estimation. One is the error originating from the element-wise difference between A * and G (the noise from the non-causal variants) and one stems from the built-in variance of the estimated β. The former in particular is highly sensitive to the proportion of causal SNPs, as our simulations have demonstrated: with few causal SNPs, the noise in A * overwhelms the signal and estimation accuracy in the approach of Yang et al. (2010) deteriorates significantly. Ignoring both sources of variances would lead to inaccurate estimation and incorrect inference (overly optimistic confidence intervals). Our approach avoids these issues by performing maximum likelihood-estimation of the relevant parameters: the genetic and environmental effects (variances) and the proportion of causal SNPs. To intuitively understand how this is accomplished, it is beneficial to think of the Metropolis algorithm used in the MCMC evaluation of the E-step as a &apos;soft&apos; simulated annealing optimization scheme where we always switch to a SNP combination with higher likelihood, but switch to a lower likelihood combination with a probability that i321 at :: on August 30, 2016 http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from</note>

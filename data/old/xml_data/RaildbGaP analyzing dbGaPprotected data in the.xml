			<abstract>
				<p>Motivation: Public archives contain thousands of trillions of bases of valuable sequencing data. More than 40% of the Sequence Read Archive is human data protected by provisions such as dbGaP. To analyse dbGaP-protected data, researchers must typically work with IT administrators and signing officials to ensure all levels of security are implemented at their institution. This is a major obstacle, impeding reproducibility and reducing the utility of archived data. Results: We present a protocol and software tool for analyzing protected data in a commercial cloud. The protocol, Rail-dbGaP, is applicable to any tool running on Amazon Web Services Elastic MapReduce. The tool, Rail-RNA v0.2, is a spliced aligner for RNA-seq data, which we demonstrate by running on 9662 samples from the dbGaP-protected GTEx consortium dataset. The Rail-dbGaP protocol makes explicit for the first time the steps an investigator must take to develop Elastic MapReduce pipelines that analyse dbGaP-protected data in a manner compliant with NIH guidelines. Rail-RNA automates implementation of the protocol, making it easy for typical biomedical investigators to study protected RNA-seq data, regardless of their local IT resources or expertise. Availability and Implementation: Rail-RNA is available from http://rail.bio. Technical details on the Rail-dbGaP protocol as well as an implementation walkthrough are available at https://github.com/ nellore/rail-dbgap. Detailed instructions on running Rail-RNA on dbGaP-protected data using Amazon Web Services are available at</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Mailman et al., 2007</ref>) hosts controlled-access raw and processed human genomic data and associated phenotypic data. While datasets are stripped of metadata linking them with specific individuals, the remaining data is still sensitive in part because it could be combined with external information to identify individuals. The NIH requires adherence to security guidelines for the proper handling of dbGaPprotected data, from acquisition through destruction (see http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/pdf/dbgap_2b_security_procedures. pdf). These include physical security of computing infrastructure, restricting inbound internet access, multi-factor authentication (MFA) and password policies, encryption of data, enforcing the principle of least privilege and logging data access. For many investigators, the guidelines pose a practical challenge: institutional computer clusters may not be compliant, requiring IT policy revisions or intervention by IT administrators.</p></div>

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a popular choice for genomics data analysis. Key datasets such as 1000 Genomes, TCGA and ICGC are hosted in AWS storage, allowing researchers to use cloudenabled tools without copying data across the internet (see https:// aws.amazon.com/1000genomes/ and https://aws.amazon.com/pub lic-data-sets/tcga/). Input data, intermediate results and final results can all be kept in cloud storage before final results are downloaded or browsed. AWS also provides guidance on secure analysis of protected genomic data (see https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/com pliance/AWS_dBGaP_Genomics_on_AWS_Best_Practices.pdf). We describe two important first steps toward enabling typical investigators to analyse dbGaP-protected data on AWS: (i) RaildbGaP, a protocol for analyzing dbGaP data in the cloud using Elastic MapReduce (EMR), an AWS service; and (ii) the v0.2 line of our Rail-RNA tool (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Nellore et al., 2015</ref>), which implements the protocol to securely download and align many dbGaP-protected RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) samples at once on EMR. We demonstrate the tool by running it on 9,662 RNA-seq samples from the GTEx project.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Protocol features</head><p>An EMR Hadoop (http://hadoop.apache.org) cluster consists of a master instance and several worker instances. The Rail-dbGaP security architecture (<ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>) secures the cluster to satisfy dbGaP guidelines. These guidelines are described below in the context of AWS and are formulated more precisely in the supplementary docu ment entitled, 'The Rail-dbGaP protocol,' also available at https:// github.com/nellore/rail-dbgap/blob/master/README.md. The sup plementary document further walks the reader through the development of an EMR pipeline that uses the Rail-dbGaP protocol to analyse three dbGaP-protected test samples. @BULLET Cluster is within a subnet of a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). A VPC is a logically isolated unit of the cloud providing a private network and firewall. The connection with the cloud storage service (Amazon Simple Storage Service, or S3) is via a 'VPC endpoint,' which ensures that data transferred never leaves the data center. @BULLET Inbound traffic is restricted via security groups. A security group is essentially a stateful firewall. A master security group for the master instance and a worker security group for worker instances prevent initiation of any connection to the cluster except by essential web services. @BULLET Data are encrypted at rest. During cluster setup, before any sensitive data has reached the cluster, each instance runs a preliminary script ('bootstrap action') that uses Linux Unified Key Setup (LUKS) (https://guardianproject.info/code/luks/) to create an encrypted partition with a keyfile. The key is randomly generated on each instance and never exposed to the user. Temporary files, the Hadoop distributed file system and buffered output to the cloud storage service are all configured to reside on the encrypted partition via symbolic links. Files written to cloud storage are also encrypted. On S3, this is enforced by creating a bucket policy (i.e. rules governing user access to the bucket) barring uploads that do not use server-side encryption. @BULLET Data are encrypted in transit. Worker instances download dbGaP data using SRA Tools (http://ncbi.github.io/sra-tools/), ensuring encryption of data transferred from dbGaP to the cluster. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is enabled for transfers between cloud storage and the cluster as well as between cloud storage service and compliant local storage to which an investigator saves results. @BULLET Identities are managed to enforce the principle of least privilege. The principle of least privilege prescribes users have only the privileges required to perform necessary tasks. In the Rail-dbGaP protocol, an administrator uses multi-factor authentication, grants the user only necessary privileges and constrains the user to set up a password satisfying NIH security best practices at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ projects/gap/pdf/dbgap_2b_security_ procedures.pdf. @BULLET Audit logs are enabled. These record logins and actions taken by the user and on the user's behalf, including API calls made by processes running on the cluster. On AWS, audit logs take the form of CloudTrail logs stored in encrypted S3 buckets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Application</head><p>The Rail-dbGaP protocol is implemented in the v0.2 line of Rail-RNA. Detailed instructions on implementation are available at https://github. com/nellore/rail-dbgap, and Rail-RNA v0.2.x may be downloaded at http://rail.bio. We used the Rail-dbGaP protocol to align 9662 pairedend RNA-seq samples obtained by the GTEx consortium (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Lonsdale et al., 2013</ref>) in 30 batches across various human tissues over a period of 5 days, 5 h and 28 min for US$0.32 per sample. Computational details, mapped read proportions and a cost calculation are described in the Supplementary Material.

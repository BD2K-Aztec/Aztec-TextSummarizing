				<p>Motivation: Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), a major inflammatory cytokine, is closely related to several cardiovascular pathological processes. However, its effects on the cell cycle of vascular endothelial cells (VECs) have been the subject of some controversy. To investigate the molecular mechanism underlying this process, we constructed time-course protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks of TNF-α induced regulation of cell cycle in VECs using microarray datasets and genome-wide PPI datasets. Then, we analyzed the topological properties of the responsive PPI networks and calculated the node degree and node betweenness centralization of each gene in the networks. We found that p21, p27 and cyclinD1, key genes of the G1/S checkpoint, are in the center of responsive PPI networks and their roles in PPI networks are significantly altered with induction of TNF-α. According to the following biological experiments, we proved that TNF-α can promote G 1 /S transition of cell cycle in VECs and facilitate the cell cycle activation induced by vascular endothelial growth factor.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), a major inflammatory cytokine, plays a pivotal role in cardiovascular disease and induces multiple changes in vascular endothelial cells (VECs), which affect several pathological processes including tumor angiogenesis (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bradley, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Zhang et al., 2009</ref>). In addition to its well-characterized properties such as altered cell adhesion and increased apoptosis, TNF-α also modulates the cell cycle in VECs (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Fajardo et al., 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Lindner et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Wojciak-Stothard et al., 1998</ref>). However, its effects on the cell cycle processes of VECs have been the subject of some controversy. Previous studies indicate that TNF-α induces cell cycle arrest and blocks proliferation of VECs (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Dormond et al., 2002</ref>). Inhibition of TNF-α accelerates endothelial recovery after angioplasty (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Krasinski et al., 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">). Frater-Schroder et al. (1987</ref>found that TNF-α can enhance VECs proliferation and enhance angiogenesis in rabbit cornea assays.<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Fajardo et al. (1992)</ref>revealed that low doses of TNF-α can increase DNA synthesis and decrease the proportion of G 1 phase cells. Moreover, our recent studies showed that TNF-α-induced cell cycle may be regulated by dynamic pathway interactions in VECs (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Huang and Li, 2010</ref>) and that there is a complex gene network behind TNF-α-induced cell cycle processes in VECs (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gu et al., 2010</ref>). We also demonstrate the advantages of protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks in studies of disease mechanisms and drug actions (<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Li et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Wu et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Zhao and Li, 2010</ref>). In this study, we constructed time-course PPI networks of TNF-α-induced regulation of cell cycle in VECs and analyzed their topological properties to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying TNF-α-induced cell cycle processes.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Time-course microarray dataset</head><p>A time-course microarray dataset of TNF-α-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was downloaded from NCBI gene expression omnibus (GEO) database: GSE9055, Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array, HUVECs stimulated with 10 ng/ml TNF-α, 0–8 h (<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Wada et al., 2009</ref>). Original CEL format files were processed and normalized by dChip (<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Li and Wong, 2001</ref>). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were selected as those with base-2 log-transformed fold changes &gt;1.0 (fold change &gt;2.0) by comparing the gene expression value at the corresponding time point with the value at time zero. Then all the probe sets were mapped to known Entrez genes. To avoid noise caused by lowly expressed genes, we filtered out genes which were lowly expressed in HUVECs across 100 arrays collected from GEO.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Gene Ontology assay</head><p>DEGs from each of 16 time points were used to enrich to Gene Ontology (GO) terms, 'regulation of apoptosis' (GO:0042981), 'regulation of cell adhesion' (GO: 0030155), 'regulation of metabolic process' (GO:0019222) and 'regulation of cell cycle' (GO:0051726) by DAVID Bioinformatics Resources 6.7 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Dennis et al., 2003</ref>) (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig. S1</ref>).

We constructed one responsive PPI network for each time point using ClustEx (Supplementary Table S2, Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. S2</ref>–S4).

ECM consists of 500 ml of basal medium, 25 ml of fetal bovine serum, 5 ml of endothelial cell growth supplements and 5 ml of penicillin/streptomycin solution.

Result showed that the term 'regulation of cell cycle' (GO: 0051726) was significantly associated with stimulation by TNF-α in VECs (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig. S1</ref>). Thirty-five DEGs were associated with the term 'regulation of cell cycle' during induction (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Table S1</ref>), and their gene expressions were clustered as shown in<ref type="figure">Figure 1A</ref>. These genes were defined as 'seed' genes to construct time-course responsive PPI networks by ClustEx. Results showed that the number of nodes (gene) and number of edges (gene–gene interaction) in the responsive PPI networks increased with stimulation of TNF-α (<ref type="figure">Fig. 1B</ref>). The average number of neighbors and clustering coefficient also increased with stimulation of TNF-α (<ref type="figure">Fig. 1C</ref>). These results suggest that TNF-α might activate a signaling transduction cascade to regulate cell cycle processes (Supplementary Table S3).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">TNF-α altered topological properties of p21, p27 and cyclinD1 in the responsive PPI networks</head><p>To determine the key genes of TNF-α-induced regulation of cell cycle, we analyzed each gene's node degree and node betweenness centrality in each responsive PPI network. We added up the normalized node degree and the normalized betweenness centrality of each gene to calculate the total node degree and total betweenness centrality and determine the importance of each gene in the whole process. We found that CDKN1A(p21), CDKN1B(p27) and CCND1(cyclinD1), the key genes of the G1/S checkpoint, were also the most important key genes in the responsive PPI networks of TNF-α-induced regulation of cell cycle (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2A</ref>). Node degree and node betweenness of p21 and cyclinD1 were significantly changed with induction of TNF-α and p27 was significantly changed at the first 2 h, but it remained stable in the following time points (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2B</ref>and C). These results suggested that the G 1 /S checkpoint might be one of the most important targets of TNF-α-induced regulation of cell cycle.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">TNF-α promotes G 1 /S transition of cell cycle in VECs and facilitates the cell cycle activation induced by VEGF</head><p>To determine if TNF-α could alter the G 1 /S checkpoint of VECs, we first got quiescent HUVECs (Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. S2</ref>). Then, we treated quiescent HUVECs as shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3A</ref>. After inductions, the cells were harvested for cell cycle assay. Results showed that 8 h after induction with TNF-α, the percentage of VECs in S phase was not significantly different from the ECM-treated control (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3B</ref>), but after 24 h the percentage of VECs in S phase was significantly increased in both groups of pulse induction of TNF-α (for 8 h) and continuous induction of TNF-α (for 24 h) (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3C</ref>). At the same time, 8 h of induction by TNF-α also significantly promoted VEGFinduced cell cycle (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3C</ref>). In western blot, the expression of p21, p27 and cyclinD1 were sensitive to stimulation of TNF-α at thein the flow chart, quiescent VECs were treated with TNF-α (10 ng/ml) or media ECM alone for 8 h and then cells were induced with different cytokines for the following 16 h. During this process, the concentration of TNF-α and VEGF were both 10 ng/ml. 'VEGF/TNF' shows cells that were treated with TNF-α (10 ng/ml) and VEGF (10 ng/ml) together. (B) Quiescent VECs were treated with TNF-α (10 ng/ml) or ECM for 8 h and then cells were harvested for FCM. Result shows mean ± SD for triplicate independent experiments ( * P &lt; 0.05).

Four hours induction of TNF-α was enough to change the expression of p21 and p27, and 8 h induction was enough to increase the expression of cyclinD1. We used phosphorylated Rb as marker of G 1 /S transition. Results showed that the expression of phosphorylated Rb is consistent with cell cycle assay (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3D</ref>and E). All these results showed that TNF-α can promote G 1 /S transition of cell cycle in VECs and facilitate the cell cycle activation-induced VEGF.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">DISCUSSION</head><p>Quiescent VECs can rapidly reverse in response to signaling from the microenvironment; however, tight regulation of the cell cycle is necessary for VECs, for one of the most important properties of VECs is to separate blood from underlying tissues (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Augustin et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Dejana, 2004</ref>). In the present study, VEGF treatment alone doubled the number of cells in S phase after 24 h (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3C</ref>, ECM/VEGF). An 8 h pulse of TNF-α followed by removal of TNF-α (TNF/ECM) nearly tripled the amount of cells in S phase and, strikingly, an 8 h pulse of TNF-α followed by treatment with VEGF alone (TNF/VEGF) caused the highest amount of S phase induction. Conversely, continuous treatment with TNF-α for 24 h (TNF/TNF) or addition of VEGF after 8 h to cells continuously treated with TNF-α (TNF/VEGF + TNF) caused fewer cells to enter S phase than the 8 h TNF-α pulse. The pulse of TNF-α facilitated the cells for entry into S phase, but continuous TNF-α treatment also acted to repress entry into S phase in the absence of VEGF induction. These results suggest that TNF-α has a double role in regulation of the cell cycle in VECs and that the cell cycle of VECs is controlled by multiple cytokines in a balanced way (<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Mantovani and Sica, 2010</ref>). In this study, time-course microarray datasets and functional relationships of PPIs were used to construct responsive PPI networks. PPI networks are a type of scale-free network (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Han, 2008</ref>) in which node degree and node betweenness centrality can be used to determine the network center (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Barabasi et al., 2011</ref>).<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Liu et al. (2007)</ref>compared a metabolic network with the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) database and found that enzyme phylogenetic profile correlated best with betweenness centrality and also quite closely with degree. Based on these studies, time-course microarray datasets and the functional relationship of PPIs were used to construct responsive PPI networks in the present study. By employing node degree and node betweenness centrality, we quantified the role of genes in the time-course PPI network which made it easier to identify the key genes in the network. Combined with laboratory experiments, we found that TNF-α could affect the G 1 /S cell cycle transition in VECs. These results show that timecourse PPI network analysis could also be a useful way to study other time-course biological processes. In summary, combined with computational and experimental studies, we found that TNF-α can promote G 1 /S transition of cell cycle in VECs and facilitate the cell cycle activation induced by VEGF. All these results suggest that TNF-α can break the resting cell cycle and wake up quiescent VECs.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig</head><figDesc>Fig. 1.

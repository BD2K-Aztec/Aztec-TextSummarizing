				<p>Motivation: Accurate estimation, comparison and evaluation of read mapping error rates is a crucial step in the processing of next-generation sequencing data, as further analysis steps and interpretation assume the correctness of the mapping results. Current approaches are either focused on sensitivity estimation and thereby disregard specificity or are based on read simulations. Although continuously improving, read simulations are still prone to introduce a bias into the mapping error quantitation and cannot capture all characteristics of an individual dataset. Results: We introduce ARDEN (artificial reference driven estimation of false positives in next-generation sequencing data), a novel benchmark method that estimates error rates of read mappers based on real experimental reads, using an additionally generated artificial reference genome. It allows a dataset-specific computation of error rates and the construction of a receiver operating characteristic curve. Thereby, it can be used for optimization of parameters for read mappers, selection of read mappers for a specific problem or for filtering alignments based on quality estimation. The use of ARDEN is demonstrated in a general read mapper comparison, a parameter optimization for one read mapper and an application example in single-nucleotide polymorphism discovery with a significant reduction in the number of false positive identifications. Availability: The ARDEN source code is freely available at http:// sourceforge.net/projects/arden/.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Throughout the past years, the rapid development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies has shaped computational biology. The analysis of large amounts of data from sequencing runs, which regularly reaches millions of reads, is a key challenge in retrieving biological information. Hence, a common part of most NGS applications is to perform a read mapping, the search of given read sequences in a much larger reference sequence. Various methods have been published to efficiently solve the read mapping problem. Popular mappers include Bowtie2 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</ref>), mrsFAST (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Hach et al., 2010</ref>), BWA (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Li and Durbin, 2009</ref>) and RazerS (<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Weese et al., 2009</ref>). For a comprehensive overview on current read mappers, we refer the reader to (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Fonseca et al., 2012</ref>). However, it is difficult to judge whether a mapping result is appropriate for a given dataset and how to efficiently compare read mappers and how to choose their increasingly large number of tuning parameters. These challenges in read mapping become particularly apparent in the search for genomic variations, such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). By definition, the sequence of reads indicating SNPs differs from the reference genome. Hence, the difficulty is to distinguish true SNPs from sequencing errors or computational mapping errors. The distinction between error and variant is not obvious in case a read does not match perfectly to the reference. Here, the parameterization of a read mapper plays a crucial role. Using only default settings may result in imperfect mappings, as they might be optimized for certain organisms or sequencing platforms. Allowing mismatches may result in a high number of mappings, but these may be error prone and have a low quality. In contrast, requiring a high similarity might hinder the detection of SNPs. Thus, a method for evaluation and quality control is required to find an optimal setting for a read mapper. To the best of our knowledge, quality control of read mappers is primarily based on sensitivity measurements (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Holtgrewe et al., 2011</ref>) or relies on read simulation as in, e.g.<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Huang et al. (2012)</ref>, Oliver (2012) and<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Ruffalo et al. (2012)</ref>, as, in general, no ground truth is available for NGS experiments. However, we observed that adequate read simulations are difficult to achieve and prone to introduce a bias. It is infeasible to model all influence factors on data acquisition and the continuously improving sequencing chemistry poses a challenge to keep simulations up to date. Further, the correlation between simulation result and a specific real dataset is inexplicit, as it is challenging to set parameters such as the error rate of the instrument a priori. To avoid this bias, we developed ARDEN (artificial reference driven estimation of false positives in NGS data), which takes the opposite approach: rather than replacing reads by a simulation with a known ground truth, ARDEN uses real reads and a simulated decoy reference genome for generating confidence measurements. Thereby, ARDEN is able to estimate and to control the number of incorrect alignments. Similarly to the widely used decoy strategy in proteomics (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Elias and Gygi, 2007</ref>), our decoy approach is used to estimate the number of false-positive read mappings. This is motivated by the assumption that the number of hits on the decoy genome provides an estimate of the expected number of false positives in the original genome. The expectancy is that the occurrence of one hit on the decoy genome (considered as a random hit) has *To whom correspondence should be addressed. ß The Author 2013.

This leads to an approximation of a false discovery rate (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Choi and Nesvizhskii, 2008</ref>). As no read simulation is necessary, ARDEN is applicable on every dataset and adjusts to the specific sequencing runs. Thus, it can be applied as a concurrent quality control and allows adjusting specificity settings separately for single experiments and the exclusion of potentially incorrect mappings from subsequent analyses. Further, it provides a novel approach to benchmark read mappers or different read mapping settings. We demonstrate the applicability of ARDEN in several evaluations: first, we use ARDEN for a basic read mapper comparison. Further, we determine the best parameter setting for a specific read mapper, and, finally, we show a specific application example for SNP discovery.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">METHODS</head><p>The analysis of a given set of NGS reads includes three major steps and one optional post-processing step, as illustrated in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>. The first step is the creation of an artificial reference genome. This genome serves as a decoy for the read mapper; this strategy is comparable with the false discovery rate approach in proteomic peptide identification using a reversed sequence decoy database (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Elias and Gygi, 2007</ref>). In the second step, an alignment is performed. The reads are mapped to the reference, as well as to the artificial reference genome using the same settings. The third step is the analysis of the resulting mappings in terms of sensitivity and specificity based on the comparison of the number of mappings with the artificial reference genome (considered as indicators of false positives) and to the reference genome. In the following, each step is explained in detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Creating an artificial reference genome</head><p>First, ARDEN creates an artificial reference genome (A) only differing from the reference (R) in single-nucleotide substitutions. Neither structural changes nor insertions or deletions (indels) are introduced. The aim is to change the original reference in a way that none of the input reads has the same origin in R and A. If this is achieved, any hit on A can be classified as a random hit (see Section 2.3 for more details). At the same time, the artificial reference genome requires a maximal similarity to the reference genome to avoid the introduction of any biases. For instance, a change of the GC-content could change the performance of the mapper. Hence, the resulting artificial reference genome is still close to the original sequence, but contains substitutions in a pre-defined distance. These mismatches are randomly chosen, but fulfill the (optional) conditions that a substitution does not change the following properties between A and R:</p><p>(i) the nucleotide distribution and thus the GC-content, (ii) the amino acid distribution, (iii) the amino acid neighborhood, (iv) any putative start/stop codons. A rudimentary gene predictor is implemented to ensure that condition (iv) is not violated. Note that this algorithm is only designed to detect basic open reading frames and, therefore, does not respect splice sites. It has been shown that these characteristics are specific for each organism (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Botzman and Margalit, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Foerstner et al., 2005</ref>) and have a major impact on sequencing (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Benjamini and Speed, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Schwartz et al., 2011</ref>). Especially the amino acid properties are essential, as random substitutions could lead to a bias in the structural folding of the corresponding proteins (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Dill and MacCallum, 2012</ref>). Instead of optimizing the conditions (i)–(iv) by an objective function, we choose an exact algorithm to guarantee that the distributions as well as the neighborhood stay the same. This is achieved by exploiting the degeneration of the genetic code. An example iteration for the algorithm to obtain the artificial reference genome is illustrated in<ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. The algorithm works as follows:</p><p>(1) Choose randomly a position n in the translated protein sequence (first frame translation of the complete genome) and its corresponding codon c n .</p><p>(2) Store the amino acids at positions n À 1 and n þ 1, as well as the corresponding codons c nÀ1 and c nþ1 .</p><p>(3) Generate a list of possible amino acids whose codon c Ã i has Hamming distance ¼ 1 to c n .</p><p>(4) Search for every amino acid triplet corresponding to c nÀ1 , c Ã i , c nþ1 from</p><p>(3) in the protein sequence [respecting the constraints (i)–(iv)] and stop when one is found at a position pos i .</p><p>(5) Switch the codon at position n and pos i .</p><p>(6) Start again with (1) until no valid starting positions are left.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Performing the read mapping</head><p>Two mappings have to be computed in one ARDEN run: one on the reference and one on the artificial reference genome. ARDEN is applicable to any read mapper as long as the mapping is presented in the common SAM file format (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Li et al., 2009</ref>) sorted by read names andIn a second step, reads are aligned to both references using all read mappers of interest. It is important to note that the settings for one read mapper need to be equal for both, the artificial and the reference genome mappings. (C) Based on the mapping results, a comparison is performed by classifying hits as true positives (TP) and false positives (FP). This is used to calculate an ROC table and its corresponding AUC. (D) An optional step can be performed to improve the mapping results by excluding aligned reads with suboptimal properties including the MD tag. Refer to the Supplementary Material for a description of formatting details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Analysis</head><p>To compare different read mappers, we classify the alignments (hits) of one read in potential true positives (PTP) and clear false positives (FP). As we have no ground truth available, we regard each hit on the reference sequence as PTP. For the mappings on the artificial reference genome, a distinction in two cases is possible. Intuitively, all alignments on the artificial reference genome that map to the same position as in the reference sequence are considered as PTPs. A priori, we assume that no mistake has been made when for a read the same origin is found in the reference and artificial genome. Hence, every alignment on the artificial reference genome that does not have the same origin in the reference is denoted as distinct false hit and thereby contributes to the FP. The sum of all PTP and FP is declared as joint hits (JH). Knowing PTP and FP, a global measure between read mappers can be defined. Addressing the PTP comparison, a measure of sensitivity (Sn) is calculated as</p><formula>Sn ¼ PTP JH Á M, ð1Þ</formula><p>where M denotes the fraction of mapped reads. This fraction serves as a normalization constant to compensate the fact that some alignment strategies map more reads than others, which may influence the calculation. Note that this way the read mapping probability normalizes the hit probability. Even though there are more sophisticated approaches to define the sensitivity of a read mapper (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Holtgrewe et al., 2011</ref>), normalizing by the percentage of mapped reads yields a suitable metric. For FPs, a measure of specificity (Sp) is defined as</p><formula>Sp ¼ 1 À FP JH Á M : ð2Þ</formula><p>This follows the intuition that mappers cannot be specific if they tend to map more reads distinctly on the artificial reference. Combining these measurements, results in a robust statistical analysis of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and its corresponding area under the curve (AUC). The ROC curve is created by plotting the sensitivity estimate Sn in relation to the specificity estimate Sp. Hence, the ROC analysis provides a possibility to identify an optimal trade-off between the sensitivity of a read mapper and its specificity. To compute positions on the ROC curve for different trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity, we filter all reads according to various alignment features. Thus, features are selected that uniquely define points on the ROC curve. The set of features comprises the number of gaps in the alignment, the number of mismatches and a read quality score (RQS), which is calculated as</p><formula>RQS ¼ " q r maxðq b Þ À minðq b Þ þ 1 , ð3Þ</formula><p>where " q r denotes the average quality [a PHRED-based probability that a base call is wrong (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Li et al., 2009)]</ref>of read r, and q b is the base quality for a base of the sequence of read r. All alignment features contribute equally to the classification in PTP or FP and have an individual score range. To reduce the computational effort, we divide each of these individual ranges into five equally sized intervals, yielding a total maximum of 3 5 ¼ 243 possible combinations (sub-classes). By defining the sensitivity as well as the specificity for each sub-class, a point can be drawn in the ROC curve (<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Lo¨werLo¨wer et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Sing et al., 2005</ref>). There is no linear relationship between the features, and their impact on read filtering differs. To ensure that the ROC curve is indeed monotonously increasing, we use the envelope of all these points (see Supplementary Material and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref>for an illustration) and thus implicitly select the most suitable filtering criterion based on the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. Based on the envelope, an AUC can be calculated using an approximation of the integral of the ROC curve. This AUC provides a value for a combined measure of sensitivity and specificity. All in all, defining the overall sensitivity and specificity and the AUC for a given read mapper yields a robust method for read mapper comparison.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Optional filtering</head><p>As an optional step, it is possible to increase the accuracy of any read mapping result by applying a false discovery rate filter on the input alignments (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1D</ref>). This filter is based on the specified feature list and removes alignments with potentially suboptimal mappings. Hence, it generates a refined SAM-file only, including alignments that fulfill the user specified criteria.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">EXPERIMENTAL SET-UP AND RESULTS</head><p>The use of ARDEN is demonstrated in three different applications. First, we perform a general comparison of read mapping tools on a specific dataset, where we indicate the best mapper in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Second, we perform a read mapper parameterization comparison to identify the best setting for a specific read mapper. Third, we perform a variant calling where we investigate the impact of ARDEN as a pre-processing step on the accuracy of variant identifications.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Comparison of different read mapping tools</head><p>As a test dataset, we chose Caenorhabditis elegans reads available on the Short Read Archive (SRA, accession number SRR065388). From these reads, we sampled 1 million singleend reads. As a reference, we used the whole genome assembly from wormbase (<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Yook et al., 2012</ref>) of C. elegans (Release WS227). This reference was used along with the artificial reference genome, which was created using ARDEN (Supplementary Material for details). To represent different categories of read mapping approaches, we selected Bowtie2 and BWA as<ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>. Example iteration for creating an artificial reference genome. The algorithm starts by choosing amino acid D and its codon GAC as the triplet to mutate. A possible candidate GCC is generated (Hamming distance 1 to GAC), and the corresponding amino acid triplet YAN serves as a target sequence. Then all occurrences of YAN in the protein sequence are checked whether the center amino acid of YAN was generated by a GCC in the reference sequence. If that is the case and the distance constraint is fulfilled, the triplets GAC and GCC and the corresponding amino acids are switched. No change has been introduced in the nucleotide distribution and in the amino acid neighborhood. Annotations denote the algorithmic description in Section 2.1 any-best-mappers (reporting one single best hit), mrsFAST as an all-mapper (reporting all hits regarding a certain error level) regarding Hamming distance and RazerS2 configured as an all-mapper regarding edit distance (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Holtgrewe et al., 2011</ref>). Each mapper was applied to the test dataset (all parameters are available in the Supplementary Material) and analyzed with ARDEN. As illustrated in<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>, the analysis shows that for this dataset, mrsFAST and RazerS2 are the most sensitive read mappers and also have the largest AUC. It can also be observed that although the PTP differ considerably between the mappers, the achieved sensitivity measurements are still within a comparably close range. The same holds for the AUC. Here, the normalization effect of M becomes apparent: for instance, although mrsFAST yielded more PTPs than RazerS2, M is slightly smaller because of ambiguous mappings, which results in a similar AUC. For this reason, a mapper is regarded as good if it not only yields many PTPs but if these PTPs also have been derived by mapping many different reads. In terms of FPs, Bowtie2 mapped approximately three times as many reads distinctly to the artificial reference genome compared with RazerS2 and BWA. Thus, the AUC for Bowtie2 is the lowest, although Bowtie2 achieves the highest fraction of mapped reads. Hence, many of these reads have been mapped incorrectly, which is reflected in all three accuracy measurements (lowest Sn, Sp and AUC). The most specific read mapper in this example is mrsFAST, but this advantage is affected by the second lowest M value as pointed out earlier in the text. The corresponding ROC curve (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref>) and its resulting AUC metric provides an easily interpretable measure for the performance of a read mapper.<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>can serve as a guideline for the decision, which read mapper to choose for this particular dataset. For instance, here RazerS2 is preferable to mrsFAST to gain a higher sensitivity, at the cost of a decrease in specificity. Optionally, ARDEN can be used to find a feasible cut-off based on RQS, number of gaps and number of mismatches to improve the performance of a specific read mapper (for instance to minimize Sn loss while maximizing Sp). This can be achieved by filtering the initial SAM-file based on the results from the ROC table created by ARDEN. As an example, an excerpt of the ROC table for Bowtie2 is shown in<ref type="figure" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>(the complete table is provided in the Supplementary Material).<ref type="figure" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>can be used to define a cut-off for specificity control because here all alignments are classified according to the used feature set. For example, instead of using all alignments (<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>), it is possible to use a specific group of alignments that are selected depending on a user defined cut-off on the alignment features (gaps, mismatches, RQS) from<ref type="figure" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>. To achieve a better specificity for Bowtie2 in default settings, it is advisable to choose the cut-off shown in the highlighted row four of<ref type="figure" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>. When only alignments with number of gaps 16, number of mismatches 5 and RQS ! 0 are selected, the number of FPs decreases by $56%, whereas only 1.55% of the PTPs are lost. Choosing this cut-off improves the specificity from 0.929 to 0.969.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Comparison of different parameterizations for one read mapper</head><p>ARDEN not only facilitates the evaluation of different read mappers for a given dataset but also the comparison of different parameterizations to derive the optimal setting for a read mapper on a specific dataset. Without any a priori knowledge, a set of mapping parameters can be tested on the artificial ground truth provided by ARDEN. We demonstrate the usefulness of this strategy on an example using Bowtie2 with different settings on the same dataset as in Section 3.1. As Bowtie2 provides pre-defined settings, we chose three of them and also designed one custom setting. The pre-defined settings used here are veryNote: M refers to the fraction of mapped input reads. The exact parameters for each mapper are available in the Supplementary Material. The analysis was performed using the analysis module of ARDEN. All values are rounded to three decimal digits. For each column best values are marked in bold.Here, we used a C.elegans dataset with 1 million single-end reads. Selected cut-off parameters for RQS, number of gaps and number of mismatches are accentuated in the plot fast, default and very sensitive, whereas the custom setting is similar to the default setting along with the ÀN ¼ 1 option (error in seed allowed).<ref type="figure" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>shows the differences between the performances of the four settings. The number of mapped reads is %94:5% and is thereby similar for all four settings. Although the custom setting was the only setting allowing mismatches in the seeds, Bowtie2 mapped most false positives when configured as very sensitive (it contributes %28% to the sum of all FP) and least in the very fast configuration, which contributes %21% to the sum of all FP. Therefore, the very fast setting yields the highest AUC value (<ref type="figure" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>). As most results are similar (in PTP, FP and M), the AUC values are narrowly distributed (0.851–0.875). For this dataset, the very fast configuration is preferable to the other settings, as it yields the highest sensitivity, as well as the highest specificity. Based on ARDEN, the user has the choice to derive more sensitive or more specific results (guided by the artificial ground truth). For example, also the custom setting might be a good choice, as it yields more PTPs than the very fast modus, whereas it still has a higher Sn and Sp than the very sensitive option. Note that it might still be possible to improve a chosen setting by decreasing the number of FPs. This can be achieved as outlined in Section 3.1 by analyzing the ROC tables provided by ARDEN.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Improving SNP calling</head><p>In general, ARDEN can be applied before any application requiring read mapping, as it provides information on the mapping accuracy and can help to select alignments with a desired trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. To investigate the impact of ARDEN on analysis results, we apply ARDEN to an SNP calling problem. We simulated a SNP ground truth on the complete genome of Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655 (accession: NC_000913) and chromosome 21 of Homo sapiens (accession: NC_000021) and evaluated the impact of our method on the accuracy of variant calling. Similar to the experimental set-up described by<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Ruffalo et al. (2012)</ref>, we created two new genomes based on the original ones by randomly introducing 150 single point mutations to the E.coli genome and 1000 to chromosome 21 of H.sapiens. To avoid any biases by mutations introduced during a read simulation process, we chose to use two real datasets, for E.coli from the Ion Torrent community and for H.sapiens from the SRA (accessions DOC-1443 and DRX000307, respectively; see Supplementary Material for details). The artificial reference genomes were created using the parameters described in the Supplementary Material. The mappings are computed using Bowtie2, RazerS2 [RazerS3 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Weese et al., 2012)]</ref>and BWA and samtools mpileup (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Li et al., 2009</ref>) were applied for variant calling (refer to the Supplementary Material for details).<ref type="figure" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref>shows the results for the E.coli genome. The category filtered refers to all reads remaining after the application of a cutoff determined by the ROC analysis with ARDEN, whereas in all, all the alignments reported by the mappers are retained. When calling SNPs on the filtered results the number of TPs remains constant, whereas the number of FPs is reduced by a varying degree (strongly reduced with 72.04% for RazerS2, whereas slightly reduced with 5.05% for BWA). The filtering had almost no effect on Bowtie2. The cut-off for BWA was chosen at (RQS !0/gaps 6/ mismatches 2), for Bowtie2 atNote: The columns RQS, GAPS and MM indicate the cut-off parameters to divide the alignments in sub-classes. For instance, the first row includes a sub-class that includes all alignments that have an RQS ! 0, gaps 16 and mismatches (MM) 27.Note: The settings reflect pre-defined configurations of Bowtie2 (very fast, default and very sensitive), as well as a custom configuration that adds the ÀN ¼ 1 option to the default setting.

The complete ROC tables are provided in the Supplementary Material along with the sensitivity and specificity table.<ref type="figure">Table 5</ref>summarizes the results for the application on chromosome 21 of H.sapiens. In addition to the simulated ground truth, the results were compared with public available SNP data retrieved via the UCSC table browser [track: All SNPs (137)] (<ref type="bibr">Karolchik et al., 2012</ref>). The reduction of false positives is again more pronounced for RazerS3 and BWA than for Bowtie2 with a maximum of 54.33% reduced false positives for RazerS3. On the H.sapiens dataset, RazerS3 and BWA lost 5.42 and 7.51% TPs, respectively, whereas the TPs increased on the Bowtie2 mapping. When only considering the simulated ground truth, the TP loss was 51% for all mappers (Supplementary Material). The cut-off for BWA was chosen at (RQS !0/gaps 9/ mismatches 2), for Bowtie2 at (RQS !0/gaps 13/ mismatches 4) and for RazerS3 at (RQS !0/gaps 14/ mismatches 4).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">DISCUSSION</head><p>ARDEN is a method for the identification and control of false positives in mappings of NGS data, for which we demonstrate a broad range of applications. ARDEN allows the comparison of mapping algorithms on any dataset of interest rather than relying on a simulated dataset with potentially differing properties. The here presented comparison study also gives insight into characteristic algorithmic properties of different classes of read mappers. For example, fewer reads are expected to map distinctively to different positions on reference and artificial reference for Hamming-based methods, such as mrsFAST. For these approaches, a single point mutation does not change the start or end position of an alignment that falls into the same region on the reference and the artificial reference. Moreover, Hamming-based methods have harder constraints for finding an alignment, as they only consider substitutions. Because of the seed and extend step, index-based methods suffer from a higher probability for mapping a read to the same region but on a different shifted position. Thus, two classes of errors may contribute to false-positive alignments, shifted alignments and alignments that map to diverse regions. In general, this leads to a higher error rate for mappers, such as Bowtie2 or BWA, than for Hamming distance-based methods. Also, in general, edit distance mappers align a higher percentage of mapped reads (in comparison with Hamming distance mappers) at the cost of an increased probability of false mappings. The reason is that edit distance mapping has relaxed constraints for finding an alignment than Hamming distance mapping, as it allows substitutions and indels. Accordingly, RazerS2 (configured in edit distance mode) and Bowtie2 mapped a higherNote: The ground truth contained 150 simulated SNPs. ARDEN decreases the number of FP while retaining all TPs. The effect of filtering depends on the particular mapper and the respective results of ARDEN. For Bowtie2, BWA and RazerS2, the percentage of all alignments that have been removed by the filter are %6:8%, %2:5% and % 3:4%, respectively. The relative difference between the All and Filt. category is denoted as Á.Note: TPs were compared with a simulated ground truth containing 1000 simulated SNPs and to public available SNP data (a more detailed distinction is available in the Supplementary Material). For RazerS3 and BWA, the filtering with ARDEN considerably reduced the numbers of FPs along with a comparably small loss of TPs. For Bowtie2, the number of FPs is decreased along with a gain in TPs. The relative difference between the All and Filt. category is denoted as Á.</p><p>The error measurement allows the dataset specific optimization of mapping parameters and makes read mappers comparable by an AUC metric. Moreover, ARDEN provides the possibility to determine a user-specified cut-off to improve the accuracy of alignments for a specific read mapper based on sensitivity, specificity and the corresponding AUC. More accurate mappings improve the quality of follow-up applications, as we demonstrated in an SNP discovery experiment where using ARDEN decreased the number of false positives by up to 72% while maintaining the majority of true positives.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Fig.1.</head><figDesc>Fig. 1. ARDEN workflow. (A) An artificial reference genome is created based on the original genome. (B) In a second step, reads are aligned to both references using all read mappers of interest. It is important to note that the settings for one read mapper need to be equal for both, the artificial and the reference genome mappings. (C) Based on the mapping results, a comparison is performed by classifying hits as true positives (TP) and false positives (FP). This is used to calculate an ROC table and its corresponding AUC.

			<note place="foot" n="5"> CONCLUSION Previous approaches to benchmark read mappers either rely on the true sensitivity for a read mapper based on the mathematical formulation of the read mapping problem or are based on read simulations. However, we showed that only considering the sensitivity in read mapping can lead to error-dominated alignments, whereas read simulations are prone to introduce a large simulation bias to the analysis. Thus, it remains doubtful whether read simulation results can be transferred to a specific real dataset. ARDEN overcomes this problem by introducing a decoy reference as an artificial ground truth to obtain an error measurement based on the distinct alignments to this decoy genome. This way, ARDEN can concurrently be run to compute and control the rate of incorrect alignments for a specific dataset of interest.</note>

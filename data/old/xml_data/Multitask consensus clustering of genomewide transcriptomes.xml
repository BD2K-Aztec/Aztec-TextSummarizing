				<p>Motivation: Identifying the shared and pathogen-specific components of host transcriptional regulatory programs is important for understanding the principles of regulation of immune response. Recent efforts in systems biology studies of infectious diseases have resulted in a large collection of datasets measuring host transcriptional response to various pathogens. Computational methods to identify and compare gene expression modules across different infections offer a powerful way to identify strain-specific and shared components of the regulatory program. An important challenge is to identify statistically robust gene expression modules as well as to reliably detect genes that change their module memberships between infections. Results: We present MULCCH (MULti-task spectral Consensus Clustering for Hierarchically related tasks), a consensus extension of a multi-task clustering algorithm to infer high-confidence strain-specific host response modules under infections from multiple virus strains. On simulated data, MULCCH more accurately identifies genes exhibiting pathogen-specific patterns compared to non-consensus and nonmulti-task clustering approaches. Application of MULCCH to mammalian tran-scriptional response to a panel of influenza viruses showed that our method identifies clusters with greater coherence compared to non-consensus methods. Further, MULCCH derived clusters are enriched for several immune system-related processes and regulators. In summary, MULCCH provides a reliable module-based approach to identify molecular pathways and gene sets characterizing commonality and specificity of host response to viruses of different pathogenicities.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Transcriptional regulatory networks play an important role in driving genome-wide mRNA levels in dynamic biological processes, such as response to stress or pathogenic infections. Identification of unique and shared components of transcriptional regulatory networks can be useful for designing more sensitive therapeutics or to exploit shared vulnerabilities of the immune system. Recently, compendia of genome-wide mRNA levels measuring mammalian host response have become available for multiple related conditions that represent responses to similar types of infections (e.g. different influenza viruses) or from similar diseases (e.g. different respiratory diseases;<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aevermann et al., 2014</ref>). Such datasets can be computationally interrogated to identify common and pathogen-specific components of transcriptional regulatory networks. Transcriptional regulatory networks exhibit a modular organization, defined by sets of genes that are co-expressed under different environmental conditions (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bonneau et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Ihmels et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Marzorati et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Polanski et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Segal et al., 2003</ref>). Thus a module-based analysis for each condition, followed by a comparison of module patterns across conditions, can provide a systematic identification of the major patterns of conserved and condition-specific transcriptional response between different conditions. Differentially responding genes can be identified as those genes that change their module assignments between conditions. To study condition-specific modules and identify genes that switch module assignments, we need a correspondence between modules across multiple conditions, and, be able to identify statistically robust changes in module assignments between conditions. Consensus clustering is an established procedure for improving the robustness of clustering algorithms (<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Monti et al., 2003</ref>), which are typically used for module identification. However, consensus clustering has thus far not been applied to module identification across multiple conditions. A second challenge is that the individual conditions themselves might be related, which if exploited can improve the confidence in detecting shared and context-specific patterns (<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kirk et al., 2012</ref>). A third related challenge is that identification of differentially responding genes using modulebased analysis have typically focused on two conditions (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Amar et al., 2013</ref>), however, as the number of conditions increase, it is important to find sets of genes that might be induced in a subset of conditions but repressed in another subset. To reliably identify condition-specific and common patterns of expression across multiple conditions, such as infection to multiple viruses, we propose MULti-task spectral Consensus Clustering for Hierarchically related tasks (MULCCH), a new consensus clustering extension for existing multi-task clustering algorithms. Multi-task clustering provides a principled machine-learning framework to cluster multiple datasets, one from each condition, simultaneously (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Caruana, 1997</ref>). Each dataset from a condition is viewed as a separate task, and is clustered separately while information is shared between the tasks. Multi-task extensions have been developed for specific clustering algorithms, including k-means (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Cai et al., 2013</ref>) and mixture models (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bickel and Scheffer, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Roy et al., 2013</ref>). Multi-task clustering frameworks can provide a correspondence between the clusters across the datasets, making it straightforward to identify gene sets that respond in a conserved manner across the conditions. Here we provide a consensus clustering extension to an existing multi-task clustering algorithm Arboretum, (<ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Roy et al., 2013</ref>), which additionally exploits hierarchical relationships among the clustering tasks (Section 2). Arboretum is a Gaussian mixture model-based multi-task clustering approach that infers modules of co-expressed genes from multiple gene expression datasets, while incorporating the hierarchical relationships across different conditions. The Arboretum algorithm was originally applied to expression datasets from different species in a phylogeny, but is broadly applicable to multi-task clustering problems that are related by a hierarchy. The consensus clustering component of our approach relies on spectral clustering (<ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Von Luxburg, 2007</ref>), which is applicable for clustering entities related by a graph. We represent an ensemble of multiple clusterings of the same dataset as a weighted graph of genes, with edge weights representing the confidence of gene pairs that are in the same cluster. We compared our method to other existing clustering algorithms using simulated and real expression data. We evaluated the algorithms based on well-established measures of cluster quality, as well as new criteria that are important for identifying condition-specific (e.g. virus-specific and strain-specific) genes. Based on simulations, we found that MULCCH and consensus versions of tested clustering algorithms dominated most other clustering algorithms in terms of cluster quality and ability to accurately detect genes that change module assignments. We applied our approach to measurements of host transcriptional response to influenza virus infections in human Calu-3 cell line and mouse lung samples (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aevermann et al., 2014</ref>). Our results identified modules with common and pathogenicity-specific patterns that are associated with various immune response processes. Taken together, our approach provides a systematic way to detect common and condition-specific patterns of transcriptional response across multiple conditions, while exploiting known relationships among the conditions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Multi-task consensus clustering approach for hierarchically related contexts</head><p>To identify common and condition-specific patterns of transcriptional response from different conditions (e.g. host response to diverse viral infections), we developed MULCCH, a multi-task spectral consensus clustering approach. MULCCH accomplishes two goals: (i) identify high-confidence gene modules in each condition and (ii) reliably detect genes that transition between modules from different conditions. Our approach extends an existing multi-task Gaussian mixture model-based algorithm, Arboretum (<ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Roy et al., 2013</ref>). The inputs to Arboretum are (i) a set of gene expression datasets, one for each condition, (ii) a binary tree that describes the relationship between the conditions represented by the datasets and (iii) a desired number of clusters, k. The parameters of Arboretum include transition matrices for each branch in the tree to model the tendency for genes to maintain or switch their assignments from the parent, and the mixture model parameters. These parameters are learned using expectation maximization (EM). The clustering produced by Arboretum gives k clusters for each condition, mapped one-to-one between conditions, which enables easy identification of both co-expression patterns and genes that switch their module membership between conditions. Genes that switch modules between different sets of conditions can indicate pathways associated with strain and pathogen-specific responses.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>illustrates our entire approach with a simple example of three datasets, one each for a pathogenic virus (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>(1)). The relative similarities between the viruses are represented by the tree structure. Our consensus clustering procedure starts by running Arboretum many times separately with different initializations. In an individual Arboretum model, each leaf node represents one condition, and a Gaussian mixture with k components models the expression data of each module at the leaf node. In<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>(1), Arboretum is shown to produce k ¼ 2 clusters for each of the conditions. Next, consensus clustering is approached as a spectral clustering problem, which we describe in more detail in the next section. We obtain one consensus graph over genes for each infection condition (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>(2)), where the edges in each graph are weighted by the frequency at which genes are co-clustered in that condition. We then compute eigenvectors from the Laplacian of the graph for each condition, and use them to generate new data vectors for that condition<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>(3). See Supplementary Materials for details. Finally, we run Arboretum on the new data vectors to obtain a consensus multi-task clustering<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>(4) consisting of k clusters per virus infection, with a one-to-one mapping between the clusters. Note that gene C exhibits an example of module transition between the pathogenicity groups: it is clustered into Module 1 for H5N1 and PB1-F2del virus infections, and Module 2 for the H1N1 virus infection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Spectral consensus clustering</head><p>Consensus clustering obtains a consensus result from multiple runs of a clustering algorithm. Our consensus clustering approach relies on spectral clustering (<ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Von Luxburg, 2007</ref>), an approach well-suited for clustering entities connected by a graph. We first define a weighted graph of genes to summarize the co-clustering relationships of genes for each condition and apply spectral clustering to this graph. Let x 1 ;. .. ; x n denote the set of genes to be clustered. Suppose we run a clustering algorithm m times (typically, m ¼ 50). For every pair of genes clustered, we compute a co-clustering index defined as the fraction of times genes i and j are in the same cluster, divided by m. We represent the co-clustering relationship between all pairs of genes using a weighted graph G ¼ ðV; EÞ. Each vertex v i in this graph is a gene, and each edge is weighted by the co-clustering index between the two genes. Given a graph, G, spectral clustering makes use of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of the graph. The Laplacian is a special operator on the graph which is inherently tied to the topology of the graph (<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Qin and Rohe, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Von Luxburg, 2007</ref>). Following (<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Mohar and Alavi, 1991</ref>), we use the symmetric normalized graph Laplacian defined as:</p><formula>L sym ¼ D À1=2 LD À1=2 ¼ I À D À1=2 AD À1=2</formula><p>where D is an n Â n diagonal degree matrix, each entry D(i, i) is the degree of a vertex, and A is the adjacency matrix, with each entry A(i, j) specifying the status of the edge from i to j. To obtain k clusters, we compute the first k eigenvectors u 1 ;. .. ; u k of L sym. Let U 2 R nÂk be the matrix containing the vector u 1 ;. .. ; u k as columns. For i ¼ 1;. .. ; n let y i 2 R k be the ith row of U, which is our new data point. Spectral clustering entails applying the K-means clustering algorithm on the new data points y 1 ;. .. ; y n. However, instead of applying K-means independently to each graph, we apply Arboretum to the sets of eigen vectors (Supplementary Materials). We considered two versions of the graph to represent the co-clustering relationships: a binary graph and a weighted graph. We create a binary graph by applying a threshold, s, on the co-clustering index. In the binary graph, we keep edges with weights above that threshold, and set all the weights to be 1. In the weighted graph version, we keep edges weighted above the threshold, but exclude edges with weights below the threshold s. We experimentally examined different values of s ¼ f0; 0:1; 0:3; 0:5; 0:7g. s ¼ 0 means that we keep all weighted edges to produce a fully connected weighted graph. Based on multiple cluster evaluation criteria, we determined that a fully connected weighted graph provides the best results (Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. S1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Dataset description</head><p>We applied our method to expression data measuring host response to six influenza viruses in two host systems: human Calu-3 cell line (GEO Accessions GSE28166, GSE37571, GSE40844, GSE40844, GSE43203, GSE43204) and lungs of 20-week old C57BL/6 mice (GSE33263, GSE37569, GSE37572, GSE43301, GSE44441, GSE44445). The mouse dataset comprised a time series of three or four samples per virus strain and the human cell-line dataset comprised six to nine samples per strain. Values were normalized to paired time points from a mock treatment. Each virus infection represented a different condition. For the human cell line data, the viruses included three wild-type strains and three laboratory-generated mutants. The wild-type viruses included two low-pathogenicity strains of H1N1, A/ California/04/2009 (H1N1) and A/Netherlands/602/2009 (NL), and one high-pathogenicity strain of H5N1, A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1). The other three viruses were laboratory-generated mutants of H5N1: PB2-627E, NS1trunc124 and PB1-F2del. PB2-627E has a mutation in the PB2 protein that reduces the virus's ability to replicate in mammals. NS1trunc124 has a shortened version of the NS1 protein that hampers the virus's ability to suppress the host antiviral response. PB1-F2del is missing PB1 entirely, which interferes with various viral functions. The mouse data included two wild-type strains, H1N1 and H5N1 and four H5N1 mutant strains. In addition to the mutants mentioned above, there was a mouse-only lowpathogenicity strain, HAavir, which exhibits altered tissue tropism compared to wild-type H5N1.We modeled the relationship among the viruses according to their pathogenicity. Although the Arboretum algorithm was developed for expression data from multiple species in a phylogeny, it can be applied to any hierarchically related set of datasets. Our motivation for using the pathogenicity tree was to enable a systematic comparison of host response to viruses of different pathogenicities. Because several of the viruses were mutant strains of the same wildtype virus, a phylogenetic tree capturing the sequence divergence of different viruses may not reflect the pathogenicity of the virus, which is measured in the host system. Pathogenicity is measured by minimum lethal dose 50 (MLD 50 ), the dose that is lethal to 50% of infected mice (<ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Tchitchek et al., 2013</ref>). Higher doses indicate lower pathogenicity. The viruses represent different groups of pathogenicity: low (H1N1 and NL), medium (PB2-627E and NS1trunc124) and high (H5N1 and PB1-F2del). The pathogenicity tree used in our analysis connected the high and medium pathogenicity viruses first, and then connected the root of these two groups with the low pathogenicity group. We applied an initial pre-processing on the original expression data to focus on genes that have orthologs between human and mouse, and that were differentially expressed between two pathogenicity groups in either species. We assessed differential expression with a T-test, P &lt; 0.01 for human and P &lt; 0.05 for mouse. We chose these different thresholds to obtain similar number of genes for each host system, P &lt; 0.05 being too generous for the human cell line data and P &lt; 0.01 being too restrictive for the more heterogeneous mouse data. These thresholds created a dataset of 7192 human genes and 7240 mouse genes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Simulation experiments</head><p>We used simulations to evaluate our multi-task consensus clustering approach for two properties: (i) the ability of consensus clustering to recover better clusters and (ii) the ability to reliably detect genes that switch between clusters from different strains. We used Arboretum's generative model to simulate expression datasets along with simulated true cluster assignments. Using those cluster assignments, we then identified genes that transitioned between clusters for pairs of conditions. The parameters of Arboretum's generative model were learned from the real human cell line expression data with k ¼ 5 clusters (covering 7192 genes). Therefore, the simulated data had the same structure as the real expression data, with six viruses each contributing a short time course. In order to ensure that the simulated data had good cluster separation, we first generated ten simulated datasets and sorted them based on average silhouette index, a measure of cluster separation. We used the two simulated datasets with the best cluster separation for our experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Evaluation of clusters and transitions between clusters</head><p>We used multiple cluster evaluation criteria to assess the quality of clusters from different consensus, non-consensus, multi-task and nonmulti-task settings. These include (i) silhouette index, (ii) module stability and (iii) expression coherence. Silhouette index is computed for each data point i and measures the sharpness of boundaries of the clustering as aiÀbi maxðai;biÞ , where a i is the average dissimilarity of i with all other data points in i's cluster and b i is the average dissimilarity of i to the next best cluster of which i is not a member. We used two distance measures to measure the dissimilarity of genes: Euclidean distance and Pearson correlation. The larger the silhouette index, the better the clustering. Cluster stability is defined as the proportion of gene pairs that are in the same module under different initializations. Expression coherence is defined as the average proportion of genes whose expression profile has &gt;0.8 correlation with the module's mean. We introduced a fourth evaluation to measure the ability of each method to detect genes that change their module between different conditions. An important property of our multi-task clustering approach is that it outputs a one-to-one mapping between clusters from multiple clustering tasks. This is beneficial because the cluster ID then corresponds to a phenotype (pattern) of expression that can be compared across multiple conditions. In particular, the transitions of a gene between different clusters across conditions is indicative of differential expression. In order to test the ability of our method to reliably detect such transitions between different clusters, we used the simulated data described above. The simulated datasets provide the correct cluster assignment and are used to evaluate a clustering method's ability to detect true transitions in modules between any pair of conditions. We used precision, recall and F-score to quantify the predicted switched genes/transitions between each pair of conditions. Let S ab denote the set of genes that transition their cluster assignment between conditions, a and b, and let S 0 ab represent the set of genes predicted to transition between clusters inferred using the data from conditions a and b. Precision, P ab , for each pair of conditions, a and b is</p><formula>jS ab \S 0 ab j jS 0 ab j , recall R ab is jS ab \S 0 ab j jS ab j , and Fscore is 2ÃP ab ÃR ab P ab þR ab</formula><p>. For all three measures, higher values mean better results. While Arboretum provides a natural mapping of cluster IDs across different conditions, the standard Gaussian mixture model does not. We mapped the clusters IDs between different conditions by computing a mean and variance value for each cluster and then applying the Hungarian matching algorithm with Euclidean distance. Because each strain had different number of experimental time points, we collapsed the per time point mean and variance to the average across time points.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6">Number of clusters</head><p>For all clusterings, we set k, the desired number of clusters, to five. We evaluated our choice by empirically trying to learn k from the range {5, 6, 7}. We found that five clusters performed the best based on the silhouette index and the ability to match cluster patterns between virus strains (Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table S1</ref>). This choice was also motivated by our particular datasets, in which the expression values of each gene tended to be constant or change monotonically over time within each viral infection. Clustering can then be seen as an extension of differential expression assessment. Instead of dividing genes into only two clusters (differentially expressed and not), a five-way clustering divides genes according to both sign of expression change and magnitude.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.7">Clustering algorithms assessed</head><p>We compared several configurations of clustering algorithms that differed in whether they performed multi-task or consensus clustering, or how they performed consensus clustering. To assess the advantage of multi-task clustering over single task clustering in the context of immune response to infection from multiple influenza virus strains, we compared the original Arboretum to independent Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). The Arboretum algorithm was already shown to be more advantageous than traditional clustering in a multi-species context (<ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Roy et al., 2013</ref>); here our experiments tested this property in the application of multi-task learning to analyze multiple host response datasets. To assess methods of extracting consensus clusters from repeated clustering runs, we compared spectral clustering to hierarchical clustering, which has been previously used for consensus clustering (<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Nguyen and Caruana, 2007</ref>). In both cases, we used the consensus edge weights as pairwise similarities between data points. In all cases, GMM clustering was used as the base line clustering algorithm. The complete set of tested configurations are: @BULLET GMM (separate clustering for each of the conditions; neither multi-task nor consensus) @BULLET Arboretum (multi-task clustering, non-consensus) @BULLET MULCCH (multi-task clustering with spectral consensus clustering) @BULLET Consensus GMM with spectral clustering (single task clustering for each condition independently, with spectral consensus clustering) @BULLET Consensus GMM with hierarchical clustering (single task clustering for each condition independently, with hierarchical consensus clustering)</p></div>

To assess significance of module similarity and reassignment of genes we defined a score S XY ij , for module i of strain X and module j of another strain Y,</p></div>

We compared Arboretum, MULCCH, GMM, and Consensus GMM by computing precision, recall and F-score to evaluate the predicted transitions between pair of strains. For six different strains, there are 6 2 possible combinations. F-scores are shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>as 15 box plot pairs and precision and recall shown in Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure S2</ref>. Each subplot shows the distribution of F-score given by different algorithms for the switches between a pair of conditions estimated from 50 runs of each algorithm. We observed that for most of these 15 comparisons, the MULCCH F-scores are much higher than the average line of Arboretum, which supports that MULCCH performs better than Arboretum in terms of the ability to predict switched genes. On the other hand, the F-scores of Consensus GMM are located about the same height as the average of GMM for most of 15 runs; that is, we did not see much improvement of Consensus GMM compared with GMM. A similar result is also found for another simulated dataset (Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. S3</ref>), in which MULCCH dominated Arboretum while Consensus GMM performed about as well as or better than GMM. Importantly, MULCCH performed better than nonconsensus clustering (either Arboretum or GMM), suggesting that the multi-task framework together with the consensus clustering framework enables us to infer high-confidence cluster transitions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Spectral consensus clustering produces better clusters than hierarchical consensus clustering</head><p>We next compared spectral consensus clustering (using either Consensus GMM or MULCCH) against Hierarchical Consensus Clustering (Section 2). We performed these comparisons on the real expression data measuring genome-wide transcriptome levels in Calu-3 cells under infection with influenza viruses of different pathogenicities (Section 2.3). Specifically, we applied Arboretum, MULCCH, Consensus GMM, GMM and Consensus Hierarchical clustering algorithms on the six influenza expression time courses and used silhouette index to evaluate the clustering quality. We used two measures of dissimilarity between pair of genes: Pearson correlation distance (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref>) and Euclidean distance (Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig.  S4</ref>). We found that both consensus and non-consensus GMM and Arboretum yielded similarly good results, except for on one virus, PB2-627E. For that virus, Consensus GMM produced better clustering (see second row, first column). On the other hand, consensus hierarchical clustering performed the worst compared to all others. We found similar results using Euclidean distance (Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. S4</ref>). These results suggest that the specific strategy used to extract consensus clusters from multiple clustering results can greatly influence the results. Importantly, our graph-based spectral clustering approach performed significantly better than the hierarchical clustering approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Consensus clustering identifies high quality and stable clusters compared to non-consensus approaches</head><p>We next compared the clustering results using two additional metrics: (i) expression coherence (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4A</ref>, C) and (ii) module stability (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4B</ref>, D). Consensus methods performed well in all measures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Consensus multi-task clustering</head><p>First, modules inferred by consensus methods were more stable or at least as stable as non-consensus methods for four of the six strains (H1N1, NL, PB2-627E, PB1-F2del). MULCCH displays much better stability than simple Arboretum, as shown by the large difference in the proportion of consistently co-clustered gene pairs (dark blue bars compared to light blue bars in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4</ref>). Second, in terms of expression coherence, Consensus GMM achieved the best result for all six strains among these four methods. MULCCH produced equally coherent modules as non-consensus Arboretum. In summary, compared to a non-multi task approach (consensus GMM), MULCCH recovers more accurate module transitions, and compared to a nonconsensus approach (Arboretum), MULCCH has higher stability and silhouette index, maintaining the same levels of expression coherence. Thus, combining multi-task and consensus clustering makes MULCCH an overall more powerful approach than traditional clustering as well as their consensus versions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Shared immune response modules across viral infections</head><p>We applied our method to human and mouse expression data measuring transcriptional response under infection to influenza virus strains of different pathogenicities (Section 2.3).<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5A</ref>shows the modules identified from the human Calu-3 cell-line data. In all six viruses, we observed five major patterns of expression: strong repression (modules 0 and 1), mild repression (module ID 2), moderate induction (module ID 3) and strong induction (module ID 4). We observed similar patterns of expression in mouse lung as well, although mouse modules exhibited greater similarity in the expression patterns (Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. S5A</ref>). Although the general pattern of expression is similar for modules of the same ID, the genes within each module might not be same. To this end we assessed the significance of module overlap between pairs of viruses (Section 2,<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 5B</ref>and Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. S5B</ref>). When modules of the same ID exhibit high overlap, matrices in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5B</ref>have strong diagonals. All pairs of strains exhibit strongshows the similarity of modules between any two conditions. Off-diagonal elements show similarity between modules of different IDs, and diagonal elements show similarity between modules of same ID diagonal elements, suggesting that there are common genes between the same module IDs in different conditions. We also observe off-diagonal elements in some human modules. This suggests that the specific genes assigned to the same module ID across two conditions are generally the same, however, there are several genes that switch their module assignments (e.g. genes that switch from module 4 to 5 between H1N1 and NL,<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 5B</ref>). To biologically interpret these modules we tested them for statistical enrichment of curated gene set from Gene Ontology, KEGG, REACTOME and Biocarta pathways (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Croft et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gene Ontology Consortium, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Kanehisa et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Liberzon et al., 2011</ref>), transcription factor binding motifs from MSigDB (<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Liberzon et al., 2011</ref>) and gene sets identified by various screening studies (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Brass et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">de Chassey et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hao et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Karlas et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kö nig et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Shapira et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Sui et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Tafforeau et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Watanabe et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Zhang et al., 2009</ref>). Module 5, which exhibited conserved induction in all six virus strains, was enriched for immune response related processes and GPCR signaling (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Table S2</ref>). Module 3, exhibiting mild repression, was associated with several REACTOME pathways in all but H1N1. Such pathways have been observed to be down regulated in cellular response to pathogens (e.g. proteasome regulation (<ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Widjaja et al., 2010</ref>), destabilization of mRNA (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Cathcart and Semler, 2014</ref>); Supplementary<ref type="figure">Table S2</ref>). Similarly, Module 5 of mouse, which exhibited strong induced expression, is associated with innate immune response processes such as NFKB signaling and cytokine signaling (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Table S3</ref>). Furthermore, in both human and mouse the most induced module was enriched for the binding sites of IRF7 and ISRE, which are important regulators of innate immune response genes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Gene sets exhibiting pathogenicity specific patterns</head><p>We next examined the modules and genes for differential pattern of expression. We did this in two ways: comparing between pairs of strains, as well as between groups of strains. For pairs of strains, we examined the off-diagonal elements in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 5B</ref>and observed several off-diagonal elements that indicate that a significant number of genes switch their module assignments between viruses. For example, between the low pathogenicity virus H1N1 and the medium pathogenicity virus PB2-627E, we found transitions between Module 4 (mild induction) and Module 5 (high induction). Most of these transitions represented changes in the level of expression but not in direction. That is, we generally observed changes involving the mild repression and strong repression modules or mild and strong induction modules. One virus participated in several notable transitions: NS1trunc124, a medium pathogenicity virus. We observed a significant fraction of genes that switched between Module 3 (mild repression) in both low pathogenicity viruses (H1N1 and NL) to Module 4 of NS1trunc124 (moderate induction). Similarly, we find that Module 4 of PB2-627E has significant overlap with Module 3 (moderate repression) of NS1trunc124. Overall, we found that NS1trunc124 had the greatest number of off-diagonal elements. This is consistent with NS1trunc124's global expression profile being the least correlated with any of the other viruses (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig. S6</ref>) as well as the knowledge that the NS1trunc124 mutation impeded the virus's ability to modulate host antiviral response (<ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Tchitchek et al., 2013</ref>). Importantly, although there is little correlation of NS1trunc124's transcriptional host response with the transcriptional response of other viruses, we still identify conserved components of this virus's response with other virus responses. To systematically identify pathways and genes that are differentially expressed between more than two viruses, we compared module assignments for sets of viruses of different pathogenicity levels using a rule-based pattern extraction approach. Specifically, we represented each gene's module assignment across all six viruses as a string of six numbers, each number denoting a module assignment. We searched these strings for patterns where genes were in one module in one subtree (defined by the virus hierarchy in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 5A</ref>), but a different module in another subtree. For example, the pattern representing genes in Module 3 (mild repression) in the low pathogenicity viruses and Module 4 (mild induction) in the high and medium pathogenicity viruses is 334444. Rule-based pattern extraction to individual genes identified 871 genes that exhibited a pathogenicityspecific pattern, representing %12% of the total number of genes that were analyzed. We focused on patterns that represented transitions between clusters with opposite signs of expression. The pattern 334444 encoding repression (Module 3) in the low pathogenicity viruses and mild induction (Module 4) in the high and medium pathogenicity viruses had the largest number of genes (162 genes). Genes in this pattern were associated with chromatin modification and RNA splicing machinery. Another interesting signature was 224444, which exhibited a transition between reduced expression in low pathogenicity viruses to induced expression in high and medium pathogenicity viruses (Supplementary Dataset S1). The genes having this pattern were enriched for the REACTOME cell cycle pathway. A third signature pattern of note was 115555, which indicates repression in the low pathogenicity viruses and induction in all other viruses (<ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>). While as a whole they were not enriched for any specific pathway, several of these genes were associated with receptor activity, cell migration and adhesion and immune response processes (represented by the genes HEY1, EPHB3). These gene sets exhibit examples of pathogen-specific expression and implicate splicing, cell cycle and chromatin modification related processes to be differentially regulated between the different pathogenicity groups. We also applied our rule-based pattern extraction approach to entire modules by identifying pathways or GO processes associated with a particular pathogenicity type. We find numerous annotation categories that were associated with different pathogenicity groups (<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>, Supplementary Tables S2 and S3), that are indicative of host immune response pathways (Type 1 interferon signaling), host factors that are part of influenza viral replication, as well as immune response transcription factors. Interestingly, we found that the influenza transcription and replication gene sets were enriched only for the high pathogenicity viruses in the mildly induced expression modules. Among the transcription factors whose motifs were enriched in different modules were important immune response regulators(LFA1, E12, OCT1) as well regulators that are specifically associated with the myeloid cell lineage (GATA, FOXO4).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Discussion</head><p>With our ever increasing ability to profile transcriptional responses from multiple diverse biological contexts—different diseases, cell types, or infections—the need to identify common and context-specific regulatory network components is becoming increasingly important. This is especially a challenge in systems biology studies of infectious disease research where such shared and unique network components can guide common treatment regimens, as well as identify host response aspects that are triggered as a function of strain virulence. To address this challenge, we proposed MULCCH, a multi-task consensus clustering approach to identify sets of host genes that are co-expressed in a similar manner under infection with multiple viruses, as well as to identify genes that exhibit differential patterns of expression between subsets of virus infections. Application of our approach to human and mouse transcriptomic data enabled us to find genes and processes that responded in a virus-or pathogenicity-specific manner. Module-based analysis of transcriptional responses is a powerful approach to identify the major patterns of expression during a dynamic process and several approaches have been developed to identify these modules from one condition (<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Marzorati et al., 2008</ref>). However, when considering multiple labeled conditions, such as the different viruses in our problem, methods that can use existing condition labels while finding gene groups within each condition are needed (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bickel and Scheffer, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Roy et al., 2013</ref>). The benefit of multi-task clustering is that it is more likely to find commonalities in cases where an independent clustering might not. A global correlation of profiles of human Calu-3 cell response to different influenza infections showed that one medium pathogenicity virus, NS1trunc124, was not correlated with the other similarly pathogenic viruses (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig. S6</ref>). However, using our approach, we were still able to find modules in this virus that significantly overlapped with modules exhibiting the same pattern from other viruses. This suggests that there can be subsets of genes that are correlated despite there being little correlation between genome-wide profiles. The ability to reliably detect module transitions for individual genes is extremely important. Because clustering approaches in general are known to be prone to reaching local optima, we used a consensus clustering approach to extract high confidence cluster assignments and cluster transitions. The choice of the consensus clustering algorithm was important and influenced the quality of results. In particular, the spectral method produced better clusters than the hierarchical method as measured by silhouette index. While consensus GMM was able to learn stable clusters, it was not able to identify module transitions reliably, likely because it does not solve the matching problem across strains, which we had to do as a post clustering step. Incorporating the pathogenicity relationships using the hierarchical relatedness approach of the Arboretum framework was useful to identify genes exhibiting patterns of pathogen specificity. Instead of considering all possible types of transitions, we applied our rule-based pattern extraction procedure on virus groups defined by pathogenicity subtrees to identify genes that exhibited the same module assignment between the same group of pathogenicity, but differed in module assignment between pathogenicity groups. Most genes that exhibit such patterns are similar among the medium and high pathogenicities. In this work, we relied on the accuracy of the pathogenicity tree to relate the viruses. One direction of future research is to explore simultaneous learning of modules as well as the tree topologies to relate the different viruses. An alternate route would be to use multitask feature learning approaches (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Argyriou et al., 2008</ref>), that do not assume any structure on the tasks and aim to learn most informative features across all tasks simultaneously. Another promising extension to the model would be to integrate different types of-omic measurements (e.g. proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics), with appropriate data specific generative models. In conclusion, our consensus-based multi-clustering approach is a novel and robust approach to identify common and context-specific sets of co-expressed genes that can be applied to large numbers of related viruses. As systems biology studies expand to additional viruses, approaches such as ours will be increasingly useful for guiding targeted therapeutics.The numbers in each row specify the module in which the process was enriched. Only processes that were enriched in both viruses of a pathogenicity group were considered.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig.1.</head><figDesc>Fig. 1.

			<abstract>
				<p>Although the 1000 Genomes haplotypes are the most commonly used reference panel for imputation, medical sequencing projects are generating large alternate sets of sequenced samples. Imputation in African Americans using 3384 haplotypes from the Exome Sequencing Project, compared with 2184 haplotypes from 1000 Genomes Project, increased effective sample size by 8.3–11.4% for coding variants with minor allele frequency 51%. No loss of imputation quality was observed using a panel built from phenotypic extremes. We recommend using haplotypes from Exome Sequencing Project alone or concatenation of the two panels over quality score-based post-imputation selection or IMPUTE2&apos;s two-panel combination.</p>

Increasingly large reference panels available in the public domain [e.g. those from the 1000 Genomes Project (<ref type="bibr">The 1000</ref><ref type="bibr">Genomes Project Consortium, 2010</ref>) and UK10K project (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Futema et al., 2012</ref>)] together with improved statistical methods (Howie *To whom correspondence should be addressed. y The authors wish it to be known that, in their opinion, the first four and the last two authors should be regarded as joint First Authors. z On behalf of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute GO Exome Sequencing<ref type="bibr">Project. et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Liu et al., 2013</ref>) have enhanced imputation quality, especially for rare variants with minor allele frequency (MAF) 55%. These improvements have resulted in both discovery and refined mapping of association with complex traits (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Auer et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Holm et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Huang et al., 2012</ref>). However, few studies have examined the use of large study-specific reference panels, particularly the use of exome sequencing-derived panels in admixed populations. Here, we present a new resource for imputation in African Americans, built from 1692 African Americans sequenced by the Exome Sequencing Project (ESP) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Tennessen et al., 2012</ref>). We assessed the use of the ESP data as an imputation reference panel and compared the results with those obtained using the 1000 Genomes Project Phase1 (1000G; version 3, March 2012 release) (<ref type="bibr">The 1000</ref><ref type="bibr">Genomes Project Consortium, 2012</ref>) data. Additionally, we evaluated the potential consequences of using a reference panel built from samples selected on the basis of phenotypic extremes or disease status instead of a population-based random sample. Lastly, we compared multiple approaches to combine the ESP and 1000G panels for the imputation of rare coding variants.</p></div>

Variant detection and genotyping were performed on both exomes and flanking 50 bp of intronic sequence. Typical mean coverage of the target was 60–80Â. Variant data for each sample were formatted (variant call format) as 'raw' calls for all samples.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Comparison of imputation quality between ESP-based and 1000G-based imputation</head><p>We first performed imputation, using either ESP or 1000G as reference, into 1661 African Americans in the WHI study (the 'target' sample) who were genotyped by both the Affymetrix 6.0 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Auer et al., 2012</ref>) and the Illumina Metabochip array (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Buyske et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Liu et al., 2012</ref>). We used MaCH (<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Li et al., 2010</ref>), a hidden Markov model that leverages linkage disequilibrium information among samples of unrelated individuals, to pre-phase the 1661 WHI African Americans at the Affymetrix 6.0 markers. The ESP reference panel was built from 1692 African Americans with genotypes from both the Affymetrix 6.0 platform and whole exome sequencing. These genotypes were merged and phased using BEAGLE (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Browning and Yu, 2009</ref>). Imputation into the 1661 target WHI African Americans was performed with minimac (<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Howie et al., 2012</ref>) (similar results were obtained with IMPUTE2; see Methods) using their Affymetrix 6.0 genotypes only; genotypes from the Metabochip genotyping were saved for evaluation. Following the literature (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Browning and Yu, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Li et al., 2010</ref>), we used dosage r 2 [squared Pearson correlation between imputed dosages (ranging continuously from 0 to 2) and experimental genotypes (coded as 0, 1 or 2)], which directly determines effective sample size for subsequent association analysis (<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Pritchard and Przeworski, 2001</ref>), to gauge imputation quality. We also use Rsq, the estimated dosage r 2 generated by minimac, as the post-imputation QC metric.<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table S1</ref>). As imputation is routinely performed in 10 000–100 000 individuals (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Auer et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cho et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Dastani et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Holm et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Teslovich et al., 2010</ref>), such an increase would correspond to increasing the sample size for association testing by 1000–10 000 samples. Because the ESP panel is larger and consists entirely of African Americans, we conducted more comparisons by assessing the performance of 10 random subsets from ESP of the same size as 1000G (both for the full 1000G panel<ref type="bibr">[</ref><ref type="bibr">625]</ref>). The difference in effective sample size derived from the ESP and 1000G reference panels, although smaller, remains (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 2</ref>and Supplementary<ref type="figure">Table S2</ref>). For example, when comparing ESP.1092 with 1000G.1092 and retaining all imputed variants in the analysis (no post-imputation QC), we observed an average dosage r 2 increase of 11.3, 4.6 and 6.1% for variants with MAF 50.2%, 0.2–0.5% and 0.5–1%, respectively. The corresponding dosage r 2 increases for a comparison of ESP.625 with 1000G.625 were 13.9%, 1.0 and 3.1%, respectively. The superior performance of ESP over 1000G was likely driven by two primary factors. First, genotypes for rare variants from ESP were derived from high coverage sequencing, whereas those from 1000G were in part from low coverage sequencing (1000G data we used here are the integrated panel constructed from low coverage whole genome sequencing, deep exome sequencing and SNP array genotyping). Second, ESP African Americans ($50% also from WHI, detailed in Materials and Methods) were better matched to the 'target' WHI African Americans for ancestry than were the samples in the 1000G panel, which were pooled from several populations of European, African and African American ancestry.As expected, better quality imputation using the ESP panel produces a larger number of well-imputed rare coding variants than using the 1000G panel (Rsq40.6 for MAF50.5%; detailed in<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>). For example, the number of well-imputed variants was 2.28, 2.83, and 1.54 times greater than that from 1000G for MAF 50.2, 0.2–0.5 and 0.5–1%, respectively (<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>). The boost in imputation quality as well as in the number of wellimputed markers is expected to enhance power for testing association with phenotypic traits. For example, out of the eight novel blood trait associated variants reported in<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Auer et al. (Auer et al., 2012</ref>), two are not in 1000G but ESP only (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Table S3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Impact of imputation reference panel constructed from subjects selected based on extreme phenotypes</head><p>Many subjects sequenced in ESP were selected on the basis of phenotypic extremes or disease status (detailed in Materials and Methods), an approach that has been shown to increase power for association testing of the specific phenotype (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Barnett et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Guey et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Kryukov et al., 2009</ref>). To our knowledge, the consequences of such a design for developing an imputation reference panel have not been previously evaluated. To this end, we constructed two ESP-derived reference panels: 'ESP.extreme' and 'ESP.normal' each of size H ¼ 853 Â 2. The former included 254 African Americans from LDL cholesterol extremes, 247 from blood pressure extremes, 40 stroke cases, 39 early onset MI (EOMI) cases and 273 with extremely high BMI. The latter included 85 samples with high LDL, 85 with low LDL and 683 from the 'middle' of the phenotype distributions. We observed no loss of imputation quality using the 'Extreme' panel. (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 3</ref>and Supplementary<ref type="figure">Table S4</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Alternative options to use or combine ESP and 1000G reference panels</head><p>Although our results suggested that the ESP panel led to substantially improved imputation accuracy of rare coding variants compared with the 1000G panel, the combination of the two panels could potentially result in even better performance than either one individually. We considered the following four options. The default option, Option 0, was to select a single panel a priori based on reference panel size, marker density and ancestry match. In this case, Option 0 would be the ESP reference panel alone, as it contains more haplotypes (3384 over 2184 in 1000G), greater marker density in exons and a better ancestry match with the target African Americans. Option 1 was to first impute using each panel separately, and then for each marker to select the one with higher Rsq. Option 2 was to impute using a concatenated panel of the two (ESP_U_1000G). Option 3 was to impute using IMPUTE2, which allows two separate reference panels (ESP þ 1000G). The best option among the four was the concatenation of the two panels (Option 2) with ESP alone (Option 0), a close second best. For example, the average dosage r 2 increased by 1.8%, 2.3% and 1.5%, respectively, for markers with MAF 50.2, 0.2–0.5 and 0.5–1% using Option 2 over Option 0 (Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. S2</ref>and Supplementary<ref type="figure">Table S5</ref>). We observed no noticeable gains using Option 1 compared withOption 0 with differences in dosage r 2 in the range of 0.02–1.5% (Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. S3</ref>and Supplementary<ref type="figure">Table S6</ref>). Therefore, we would not recommend using Option 1, the Rsq-based selection, because higher Rsq does not guarantee better imputation quality. In fact a low quality reference panel could lead to poorly estimated Rsq values. Finally, IMPUTE2's ability to combine two reference panels (Option 3), led to decreased imputation quality compared with Option 0. For example, dosage r 2 decreased by an average of 7.3, 4.3 and 3.9% for markers with MAF 0.2, 0.2–0.5 and 0.5–1% (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 4</ref>and Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. S4</ref>and Supplementary<ref type="figure">Table S7</ref>). Although less accurate, the convenience provided by IMPUTE2's approach warrants closer consideration. Decreases in quality could be due to software implementation because we used minimac for options 0–2 and IMPUTE2 for option 3. But importantly, our recommendation of concatenation of the two or ESP alone over 1000G alone or post-imputation Rsq-based selection holds when IMPUTE2 was used for all four options (see 'Imputation using IMPUTE2' in Materials and Methods, Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig.  S5</ref>and Supplementary<ref type="figure">Table S8</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">DISCUSSION</head><p>We note that ESP is heavily enriched for extremes from several phenotypes rather than a single phenotype. Thus, it is unclear whether these results generalize to a design where sequenced subjects are selected based on extremes for a single phenotype. We did not attempt to select one phenotype for evaluation, as doing so would reduce our reference size to below 300, which we view as of little value for the imputation of rare variants. We expect such 'Extreme' panels to make little difference for imputation overall and may affect imputation in the specific trait associated regions when the causal variant(s) exert large effect(s). Although we recommend the concatenation of ESP and 1000G, we observed only modest gains in imputation quality by combining the two. Previous studies suggest that these gains may depend in part on the ethnic make-up of the study subjects (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Browning and Yu, 2009</ref>) and whether 1000G data add substantial haplotype diversity. These gains should be weighed against the logistical challenges of combining data from multiple sources to avoid batch effects (e.g. mismatched strands, inconsistent marker naming schemes or systematic differences in genotype calling, QC or phasing). In summary, we found that the ESP African American reference panel outperformed the 1000G reference panel for the imputation of rare coding variants in African Americans, both in terms of imputation quality, the number of imputable markers and consequently power for trait association testing. The finding was robust to adjustment of reference size and matching on ethnicity. We did not observe loss of imputation quality because of the ESP design for enriched sequencing of subjects selected for phenotypic extremes. Regarding the optimal way to combine the two panels, our evaluations suggested that ESP alone or concatenation of the ESP and 1000G reference panels was superior to either post-imputation selection based on Rsq or IMPUTE2's implementation of two separate reference panels. We focused here on imputation of coding variants from ESP. However, we believe that the conclusions drawn here apply to rare variants across the genome as recently reported by several whole-genome sequencing-based studies (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Fuchsberger et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Sanna, 2012</ref>) in individuals of European ancestry. These studies and our present work strongly suggest that population matched samples, even in diverse populations such as African Americans, can clearly outperform 1000G imputation performance. Therefore, we recommend investigators routinely consider sequencing for the design (<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kang et al., 2013</ref>) and analysis of the study samples.</p></div>

				<p>Motivation: Protein–DNA interactions often take part in various crucial processes, which are essential for cellular function. The identification of DNA-binding sites in proteins is important for understanding the molecular mechanisms of protein–DNA interaction. Thus, we have developed an improved method to predict DNA-binding sites by integrating structural alignment algorithm and support vector machine–based methods. Results: Evaluated on a new non-redundant protein set with 224 chains, the method has 80.7% sensitivity and 82.9% specificity in the 5-fold cross-validation test. In addition, it predicts DNA-binding sites with 85.1% sensitivity and 85.3% specificity when tested on a dataset with 62 protein–DNA complexes. Compared with a recently published method, BindNþ, our method predicts DNA-binding sites with a 7% better area under the receiver operating characteristic curve value when tested on the same dataset. Many important problems in cell biology require the dense non-linear interactions between functional modules be considered. Thus, our prediction method will be useful in detecting such complex interactions.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Protein–DNA interactions play essential roles in a variety of vital biological processes, such as DNA replication, transcription, packaging (<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Luscombe et al., 2000</ref>). For example, the interactions between DNA and transcription factors are important for modulating the process of gene replication and transcription (<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Ptashne et al., 2005</ref>). The interactions of DNA and histones are involved in chromosome packaging in the cell nucleus (<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Kornberg, 1974</ref>). Moreover,<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bullock and Fersht (2001)</ref>have shown that mutations of DNA-binding residues, such as those on the tumor repressor protein P53, may predispose individuals to cancer. Thus, the accurate identification of DNA-binding sites in proteins is not only important for understanding the mechanisms of these biological processes but also helpful for annotating the function of proteins. Protein–DNA interaction sites can be detected by using biochemical techniques, such as DNase I foot-printing (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Brenowitz et al., 1986</ref>), Gel retardation (<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Lane et al., 1992</ref>) in vivo foot-printing (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Dumitru and McNeil, 1994</ref>) in vitro binding assay (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Diekmann and Hall, 1995</ref>) and methylation (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Baldwin et al., 2001</ref>). However, traditional biochemical methods are time-consuming and laborious to carry out for the rapidly increasing number of protein–DNA complexes. Therefore, developing an objective and effective computational approach to precisely predict DNA-binding sites would be necessary. Several computational methods have been developed to identify DNA-binding sites in proteins based mainly on protein sequence or protein structure. The sequence-based method can be further divided into two classes. The first class is based on the following: side chain pKa value, hydrophobicity index and molecular mass of the amino acid residues and DNA-binding residues predicted by support vector machine (SVM) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Wang and Brown, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Wang et al., 2010</ref>) and random forests classifier (<ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Wang et al., 2009</ref>). The second class uses evolutionary and other sequence information to identify DNA-binding sites in proteins (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ahmad and Sarai, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Huang et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Hwang et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Kuznetsov et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Ofran et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Wu et al., 2009</ref>). Structure-based methods are further classified into a structural alignment-based method and a structural alignment-free method. For the structural alignment-based method, the DNA-binding sites are recognized from a structural alignment between the query sequence and a template known to bind DNA (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Gao and Skolnick, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Holm and Sander, 1993</ref>). In the structural alignment-free method, DNA-binding sites are predicted using electrostatic potentials and the shape of the molecular surface (<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Jones et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Tsuchiya et al., 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Tsuchiya et al., , 2005</ref>). With the rapid increase in the number of high-quality protein structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), developing new and efficient techniques for predicting DNA-binding sites using geometric structures has become feasible. In this article, we introduce a two-stage machine-learning strategy to predict DNA-binding sites. In the first stage, DNA-binding sites are predicted by a structural alignment algorithm using the geometric structure. In the second stage, DNA-binding sites are predicted by SVM using evolutionary information, torsion angles ('<ref type="bibr">, )</ref>present in the backbone structure and solvent accessibility. The final results are obtained by a consensus of SVM predictions and geometric structure-based predictions. *To whom correspondence should be addressed.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Dataset preparation</head><p>In this study, two datasets, PDNA-62 and PDNA-224, were used to evaluate the performance of our method. A summary of these datasets are shown as follows: PDNA-62: This is a non-redundant database of representative protein–DNA complexes from the PDB (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/), which was constructed by Ahmad and Sarai (2005) and used by several other studies (<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Kuznetsov et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Wang and Brown, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Wang et al., 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Wang et al., , 2010</ref>). The sequence identity in the dataset was 25% and the resolution of the structures was 2.5 A ˚ or better. Based on the cutoff distance of 3.5 A ˚ , the PDNA-62 dataset contained 1215 DNA-binding residues and 6948 non-binding residues (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ahmad and Sarai, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ahmad et al., 2004</ref>). PDNA-224: In addition to the latest PDB (released by January 25, 2011), a new DNA-binding protein dataset was constructed from 978 protein–DNA complexes in this work. The 978 protein–DNA complexes were determined by radiographic crystallography with a resolution better than 3.0 A ˚. Redundancy among the amino acid sequences was removed using the PISCES software (<ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Wang and Dunbrack, 2003</ref>) with a threshold of 25% set for sequence identity. Any proteins homologous to those in the PDNA-62 were also removed by the PISCES software. Finally, 224 non-redundant protein chains containing 57 348 amino acids were obtained. According to an identical criterion suggested in previous studies, a residue is regarded as interacting with DNA if the distance between an atom of the residue and an atom of base is 53.5 A ˚ (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ahmad and Sarai, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ahmad et al., 2004</ref>). Using this criterion, 3778 interacting residues and 53 570 non-interacting residues were projected to be present in the PDNA-224 dataset. The PDNA-224 dataset and the binding sites information are listed in the Supplementary Data S1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Methods for prediction</head><p>Our method consisted of a SVM predictor and a geometric structure-based predictor. For the SVM predictor, a SVM decision value (sdv) for each site in a protein is obtained by SVM using the evolutionary information, solvent accessible surface area and the protein backbone structure (PBS). For the geometric structure-based predictor, another geometric decision value (gdv) for each protein site is obtained by the structural alignment method using the geometric structure information. The final result for each site is obtained by combining the two decision values of SVM-based predictor and geometric structure-based predictor. The whole prediction procedure is illustrated in<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">SVM-based predictor</head><p>Owing to the fact that the DNA-binding site is determined not only by the central residue, but also by other residues present in its neighboring sites, a sliding window with K residues is selected to represent the information of the central site. The information of each residue in the sliding window is constructed using evolutionary information, the torsion angles (', ) in the PBS and the solvent accessible surface (<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Li and Li, 2012</ref>). These features and the encoding scheme are described in Part 1 of the Supplementary Data S2. Then, the encoded features are selected as the input parameters of the SVM, which is a popular machine-learning approach mainly used in pattern recognition and orientation (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Cai et al., 2002</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Cai et al., , 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Kuznetsov et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Shu et al., 2008</ref>). In this work, the publicly available LibSVM software (version 3.0) was used (http://www. csie.nut.edu.tw/$cjlin/libsvm) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Chang and Lin, 2011</ref>). The SVM outputs (SVM decision value) have been converted into conditional probabilities using a sigmoid function. The probability interpretation of sdv(x) is used for evaluating the performance of the SVM predictor. The sigmoid function is defined as follows:</p><p>PðY ¼ 1jxÞ ¼ 1=ð1 þ expðA Â sdvðxÞ þ BÞÞ ð1Þ where x is the SVM input of each feature for position x, sdv(x) denotes the decision value of the test feature for position x, P(Y ¼ 1jx) is the probability of DNA-binding prediction, and A and B are the slope and offset, respectively, to be learned by a 3-fold cross-validation method suggested in Platt (2000) (see Part 2 in Supplementary Data S2 for more details) from the training set for the sigmoid function. Empirically, one could use A ¼ À2.0, B ¼ À0.5 for DNA-binding prediction. To combine linearly the scores of SVM predictions with the scores of geometric structure-based predictions (see section 2.5 for more detail), we converted conditional probabilities back to SVM decision value by, sdvðxÞ ¼ fln½ð1 À PÞ=P À Bg=A ð2Þ where sdv(x) is the decision value of the test feature for position x, P is the conditional probability for DNA-binding and A and B are the same as used in the sigmoid function. Equation</p><p>(2) is an inverse of Equation (1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Geometric structure-based predictors</head><p>Generally speaking, if a protein has a geometric structure similar to a DNA-binding protein, the probability that this protein is also DNA-binding protein is much higher. In our study, we use a structural alignment method (see Section 2.5 for more details) to detect structural similarities between a query protein and a template known to bind DNA. The quality of the structural alignment method is determined by an interface alignment score (IAS), which provides a quantitative measure of the similarity between two protein–DNA complexes in the geometry. Therefore, for a complex in the test set, a protein–DNA complex in the training set with the highest IAS is kept, including the PDB code and the DNA-binding information. This information is used to calculate the decision values for all matched residues of the target chain according to the following strategies: If the matched residue in the detected chain is a DNA-binding site, a positive amino acid–amino acid similarity score is assigned to the site in the target chain. On the other hand, if the matched residue in the detected chain is a non-DNA–binding site, a zero score is assigned to the site in the target chain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Structural alignment method for detecting structural similarity</head><p>According to the local coordinate systems, the vector (O *</p><p>) connecting the nucleotide–amino acid pair (base to amino acid) is determined as set out in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2A</ref>. The magnitude of the O * vector for all nucleotide–amino acid pairs is calculated in our datasets. As in the previous study (<ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Siggers et al., 2005</ref>), a pair is regarded as 'contacting' if it had a O * vector whose magnitude was 516 A ˚. Therefore, this value is chosen as the distance cutoff used to define an 'interfacial' amino acid–nucleotide pair when determining amino acid–amino acid similarity scores. Step 2: Calculating amino acid–nucleotide geometric similarity score Based on the coordinate system, the indices i and c are introduced to represent an amino acid and nucleotide subunit, and m and n for the other, respectively. By comparing the geometric similarity between two amino acid–nucleotide subunits ic and mn, the geometric parameters such as the rotation angle and the distance displacement are obtained. The rotation angle is in the form ofS2 for more details). Therefore, the constant coefficients used here are 25.0 (A d ) and 0.5 (B d ) for s d {(i,c)(m,n)}, 5.0 (A ) and 2.6 (B ) for s {(i,c)(m,n)} and 0.45 (A ) and 25.0 (B ) for s {(i,c)(m,n)}. The final stage in this step is to calculate the amino acid– nucleotide geometric similarity score; the amino acid–nucleotide geometric similarity score can be written in the form, sfði, cÞðm, nÞg ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi s d fði, cÞðm, nÞg s a fði, cÞðm, nÞg s fði, cÞðm, nÞg gdvðx, mÞ ¼ 0 if the matched residue in the alignment chain is a nonDNA À binding Sfx, mg if the matched residue in the alignment chain is a DNA À binding</p><formula>8 &gt; &lt; &gt; : ð9Þ</formula><p>where S {x,m} is the average amino acid–amino acid similarity score for position x and gdv(x,m) is the gdv for position x.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6">The combination of the decision values from the SVM and geometry-based predictor</head><p>To predict the DNA-binding sites accurately, we used a novel scheme by combining the SVM decision value with the gdv. The scheme is based on the expected value in probability theory; suppose a random variable X can take value x 1 with probability p 1 , value x 2 with probability p 2 , and so on, up to value x k with probability p k. Then the expectation of this random variable X is defined as follows,comðxÞ ¼ ð1:0 À pÞ Â sdvðxÞ þ p Â gdvðxÞ ðx ¼ 1, 2:::LÞ ð11Þ where sdv(x) is the SVM decision value for the position x, gdv(x) is the gdv for the position x, com(x) is the combined decision value for the position x, L is the length of the protein sequence and p is the proportion factor, p ¼ 0.45 is used by learning the method from the training set (See Part 4 in Supplementary Data S2 for more details). Then, the com(x) elements are normalized to fall with the range of O $1 by the sigmoid function, which is analogous to equation (1) as shown below, pcomðY ¼ 1jxÞ ¼ 1=ð1 þ expðA Â comðxÞ þ BÞÞ ð12Þ where com(x) denotes the combined decision value for the position x, pcom(Y ¼ 1jx) is the probability interpretation of the com(x), and A and B are the slope and offset, respectively. In this article, we use A ¼ À6.0, B ¼ À0.2 for the final prediction. The final prediction result is obtained using the probability interpretation of the com(x). Given a protein sequence X with l residues, we obtain an l-dimensional feature vector [pcom(1), pcom(2),.</p><formula>. ., pcom(l)]</formula><p>. Then, we use a threshold 0 to integrate the vector into a non-linear discriminant function. The threshold 0 gives the decision for sample X. As pcom(x)4 0 , the sample X is classified into the positive group, or into the negative group as pcom(x) 0. Empirically, one could use 0 ¼ 0.52 for DNA-binding prediction (See Part 5 in Supplementary Data S2 for more details).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</head><p>In predicting DNA-binding sites, the 5-fold cross-validation test is often used to examine the effectiveness of a predictor (<ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Wang and Brown, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Wang et al., 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Wang et al., , 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Wu et al., 2009</ref>). The performance of our predictor was also assessed by the 5-fold cross-validation test. During this test, a dataset is randomly divided into five non-overlapping sets, four of which are used for training the predictor and the accuracy of the predictor is assessed on the remaining sets. This process is repeated five times. The predictive capability of our method was evaluated by the sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC), overall prediction accuracy (Acc), strength (Str) and false-positive rate (FPR):To further evaluate the capability of using our method on an unbalanced dataset, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (<ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Swets, 1988</ref>), one of the most robust approaches for classifier evaluation, was also used. It is obtained by plotting the true-positive rate (sensitivity) on the y-axis against the FPR (1-specificity) on the x-axis. The area under the ROC curve (AUROC) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bradley, 1997</ref>) can be used as a reliable measure for the prediction performance. The maximum value of AUROC (1) denotes a perfect prediction. A random guess receives an AUROC value close to 0.5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Effect of the sliding window size in the construction of the SVM input vectors</head><p>To obtain the best performance for predicting DNA-binding sites, the sliding window size is optimized with respect to the overall accuracy, MCC and Strength values. The optimized sliding window size is obtained by testing the performance of different sliding window sizes from 3 to 21 with the default parameters c, g and weight in SVM.<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>shows the results of different sliding window sizes on the dataset PDNA-62. It was found that a sliding window of 11 amino acids achieves the best predicting performance. Therefore, the optimized sliding window size was set to 11 in this study.<ref type="figure" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>shows the predicted results for the PDNA-62 dataset with various combinations of features. We show that the lowest overall prediction accuracy is 62.6% when only using the PBS as the input parameter. By using the PSSM profiles as the input vector, the accuracy of the SVM classifier is significantly improved up to 79.4%. However, the prediction performance slightly increases when the PSSM profiles were combined with PBS or normalized solvent accessible surface area (NSASA) are used as the input vectors. The best results (Acc of 83.6%, MCC of 0.50 and Strength of 82.2%) were obtained when all the<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>.

Therefore, in our work, the SVM-based prediction model was constructed by combining all the features. By integrating SVM with geometric structure-based predictor, we obtained a final ROC curve for the final prediction shown in<ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. It is clear that the AUROC values in our predictions are $5–10% higher than those obtained in other studies. The best values for Acc, MCC, strength and AUROC were 85.5%, 0.55, 85.3% and 0.926, respectively, in our study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">The predicted results on the new PDNA-224 dataset</head><p>To further evaluate the performance of our method in predicting DNA-binding sites, we applied it to a new dataset PDNA-224 generated in this work. The test results of the SVM models using various features are listed in<ref type="figure" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>. Our results show that the prediction performance increases significantly while using the PSSM profiles as the parameter of the SVM model. When the PSSM profile was combined with one or more additional features as input vectors, the performances were slightly improved. The best performance was achieved with an MCC of 0.35, overall accuracy of 81.8% and strength of 79.2% (with a sensitivity of 76.1% and specificity of 82.2%) by combining the PSSM profiles, PBS and NSASA. In addition, the ROC curves of predicting DNA-binding sites for the PDNA-224 dataset (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4</ref>) was obtained by combining the SVM predictor using different parameters with the geometric structure-based predictor. The AUROC values show that the combined results are better than the results of the SVM models using various features. The best AUROC value was 0.898 in the 5-fold cross-validation test.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Comparison with other computational methods</head><p>DNA-binding sites have been predicted successfully using predictors, such as Dps-pred (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ahmad et al., 2004</ref>), Dbs-pssm (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ahmad and Sarai, 2005</ref>), BindN (<ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Wang and Brown, 2006</ref>), Dp-bind (<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Kuznetsov et al., 2006</ref>), DP-Bind (<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Hwang et al., 2007</ref>), BindN-RF (<ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Wang et al., 2009</ref>) and BindN þ(<ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Wang et al., 2010</ref>). When we compared our method with prior methods using the common dataset, PDNA-62, we obtained the results shown in<ref type="figure" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref>. Overall, the best results of our prediction were 85.2% (85.2% sensitivity and 85.3% specificity).

Both the sensitivity and specificity of our predictor were also better than those of other predictors shown in</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">False-positive sites predicted with high confidence</head><p>To further illustrate the predictive capability of our predictor, our results for the common PDNA-62 dataset were compared with those of the PDB. The results show that 197 residues that do not bind to DNA in the PDB annotation are predicted as DNA-binding sites with 490% confidence. However, based on deep and comprehensive analyses, the 197 residues can be classified into five groups. We used the pdb_idþchain_letter (e.g. 1B3TA) to name the protein chains. In the first group, we found 27 false-positive residues with other related functions. Some of the residues are protein–protein interaction sites (Ala46 in 1A02J, Gly82 in 1B3TA, Asp50 in 1CF7A, Gln18 in 1FJLA, Glu128 in 1GDTA, Lys22 in 1HWTD, Gln44 in 1HWTD, His 32 in 1IHFB, Leu37 in 1IHFB, Cys93 in 1MNMA, Val63 in 1PYIA, Asn117 in 1TSRA, Thr118 in 1TSRA, Gln28 in 1YRNA), while others represent water-binding sites (Val99 in 1A02N, Gly158 in 1A74A, Thr9 in 1BHMA, Ala40 in 1CDWA, Trp65 in 1FJLA, Glu30 in 1HCQA, Met 42 in 1HCQA, Leu83 in 1IGNA, Glu101 in 1IGNA, Tyr57 in 1PUEE, Thr30 in 1TSRA). Moreover, Ser49 in 1DP7P is a ligand-binding site and Cys125 in 1A74A is a Zn-binding site. Although these predicted residues are not DNA-binding sites, they do interact functionally with other residues or small molecules. The results seem to indicate that our method is helpful for predicting other functional sites. The second group contains 21 false-positive residues. Our results show that these residues (Lys42, Phe63, Leu76, Asp77, Lys102 and His113 in 1UBDC) have higher amino acid–amino acid similarity scores with actual DNA-binding residues based on the structural alignment method. Because of structural relatedness to actual DNA binding residues, these false-positives may indeed bind to DNA. In the third group, seven sites (Gly158 in 1GDTA, Arg10 in 1PERL, Thr27 in 1PERL, Lys23 in 1SRSA, Gly36 in 1SRSA, Arg17 in 1YSAC and Ser19 in 1YSAC) are neither functional nor geometrically similar. But the sequences of 1GDTA, 1PERL, 1SRSA, 1YSAC are exactly the same as 1GDTB, 1PERR, 1SRSB, 1YSAD. And Gly158 in 1GDTB, Arg10 in 1PERR, Thr27 in 1PERR, Lys23 in 1SRSB, Gly36 in 1SRSB, Arg17 in 1YSAD and Ser19 in 1YSAD have been verified in actual DNA-binding experiments (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Berman et al., 2000</ref>). Therefore, the results show that our method can detect true DNA-binding sites.The fourth group has 110 mis-predicted residues that are located in DNA-binding regions (DBRs). A DBR is an independently folded protein region that contains at least one motif that recognizes double-or single-stranded DNA. From the predicted results, it is obvious that some demonstrated binding regions are in reasonable agreement with experimental data (see Supplementary Data S3 for more details). For example, in 1A02F, we observe that Arg7, Asn10, Lys11, Ala13, Lys16, Ser17, Arg18, Arg21 form a DBR. The results indicate that our method predicts DNA-binding with greater accuracy and will be of help to biologists. Besides the four groups mentioned above, only 32 residues in the fifth group were incorrectly predicted by our method.</p></div>

For example, Lys17, Thr130 in 1B3TA are DNA-binding residues according to experimental data. But these are mis-predicted in this article. From the spatial structure of 1B3TA (<ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>), we find Lys17 is located in the beginning of-helices and Thr130 is located in the end of-strands. As alluded to earlier, residues of this nature are difficult to predict, as they occur in the beginning or end of-helices and-strands that are usually distorted randomly (<ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Zhou et al., 2010</ref>).</p></div>

Because the geometric parameters Ád {(i,c)(m,n)}, Á {(i,c)(m,n)} and Á {(i,c)(m,n)} are discrete distributions, these parameters are transformed into corresponding geometric parameters s d {(i,c)(m,n)}, s {(i,c)(m,n)} and s {(i,c)(m,n)} so that the transformed geometric parameters are continuous distributions in the range of $0–1. In this article, s d {(i,c)(m,n)}, s {(i,c)(m,n)} and s {(i,c)(m,n)} are calculated by using the following logistic function: s d fði, cÞðm, nÞg ¼ expðA d ðB d À ÁdÞÞ=ð1þ expðA d ðB d À ÁdÞÞÞ ð3Þ</figDesc></figure>

(A) Orthonormal coordinate systems constructed on the amino acid backbone (i) and DNA base (m). The vector O * connects the origin of the base system to the origin of the amino acid system. The three coordinate vectors of the amino acid frame and the O * vector are transformed into the base reference frame. These four vectors describe the relative spatial orientation of the amino acid backbone with respect to the base. (B) Geometric parameters Ád and Á for (ic) and (mn) amino acid–nucleotide pairs. Amino acid–nucleotide-pair geometric relationships are described in the base reference frame. In the base reference frame, the radial displacement Ád is the difference between the magnitude of the O * ic and O * mn vectors: Ád {(i,c)(m,n)} ¼ abs (jjO * ic jj À jjO * mn jj). The angle displacement Á, which is analogous to an arc length, is represented by the base of an isosceles triangle where the shorter of the two O * vectors determines the length of the two equivalent sides.

Therefore, for a test instance, a complex in the training set with the highest IAS is kept, including the PDB code and the DNA-binding information. The amino acid–amino acid similarity score is used to calculate the gdv for all matched residues of the test instance. However, there are two important differences in the usefulness of the amino acid–amino acid similarity score: (i) In our study, the amino acid–amino acid similarity scores are converted into the average amino acid–amino acid similarity score using the normalized function suggested in a previous study (Chang and Lin, 2011) in order that the average amino acid–amino acid similarity score remains the same as the decision value derived from SVM predictions. (ii) Not all the amino acid–amino acid similarity scores are used in our study. The amino acid–amino acid similarity scores in which the matched residues in the detected chain are non-DNA–binding sites are not included in this study. The remaining amino acid–amino acid similarity scores are regarded as the gdv. The scheme is defined as follows:</note>

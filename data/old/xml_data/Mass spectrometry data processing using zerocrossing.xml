				<p>Motivation: Peaks are the key information in mass spectrometry (MS) which has been increasingly used to discover diseases-related proteomic patterns. Peak detection is an essential step for MS-based proteomic data analysis. Recently, several peak detection algorithms have been proposed. However, in these algorithms, there are three major deficiencies: (i) because the noise is often removed, the true signal could also be removed; (ii) baseline removal step may get rid of true peaks and create new false peaks; (iii) in peak quantification step, a threshold of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is usually used to remove false peaks; however, noise estimations in SNR calculation are often inaccurate in either time or wavelet domain. In this article, we propose new algorithms to solve these problems. First, we use bivariate shrinkage estimator in stationary wavelet domain to avoid removing true peaks in denoising step. Second, without baseline removal, zero-crossing lines in multi-scale of derivative Gaussian wavelets are investigated with mixture of Gaussian to estimate discriminative parameters of peaks. Third, in quantification step, the frequency, SD, height and rank of peaks are used to detect both high and small energy peaks with robustness to noise. Results: We propose a novel Gaussian Derivative Wavelet (GDWavelet) method to more accurately detect true peaks with a lower false discovery rate than existing methods. The proposed GDWavelet method has been performed on the real Surface-Enhanced Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-Of-Flight (SELDI-TOF) spectrum with known polypeptide positions and on two synthetic data with Gaussian and real noise. All experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms other commonly used methods. The standard receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are used to evaluate the experimental results.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Mass spectrometry (MS) is a crucial analytical tool in proteomics research to provide tremendous information for disease proteomics study and drug targets identification at the protein/peptide level. Due to measurement error, chemical and other background noise, MS usually contains high-frequency noise and consequently a multitude of misleading peaks. Peak detection is one of the most important steps in MS data analysis because its performance directly effects the final proteomics study results. Because the noise in MS comes from different resources and cannot be estimated, false positive peak detection results are * To whom correspondence should be addressed.</p><p>unavoidable. This makes peak detection as a challenging problem. In recent years, several peak detection methods have been proposed (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Coombes et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Du et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Morris et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Nguyen et al., 2009</ref>). Most previous algorithms have four common preprocessing steps: denoising, baseline correction, alignment of spectrograms and normalization. After preprocessing, local maxima is usually used to detect peak positions and design rules to quantify peaks. In this article, we will explore the limitations of existing peak detection methods and propose several new algorithms to solve them. Most peak detection methods employed denoising step by removing noise in each scale of wavelet, such as commonly used Cromwell (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Coombes et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Morris et al., 2005</ref>) and continuous wavelet transform (CWT) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Du et al., 2006</ref>) methods. However, true peaks in MS could have large frequency response and be removed by denoising step. As a result, these true peaks cannot be detected. We propose using bivariate shrinkage model, which considers relationship of two neighbor scales, to remove noise in stationary wavelet domain. Because utilizing relationship between two neighbor coefficients or two scales of wavelets can keep highfrequency true signal (<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Selesnick et al., 2001</ref>). Stationary wavelet transform (SWT) utilizes spatial information of signals and suppress artifacts by redundant representations. Baseline removal step was widely used in peak detection methods, but it often got rid of true peaks and created new false peaks. To avoid removing baseline, the CWT-based pattern-matching algorithm was introduced in study by<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Du et al. (2006)</ref>. Using Mexican Hat wavelet in multi-scale, this method gave good results in peak detection with high sensitivity and low false discovery rate (FDR). However, the more important property of multi-scale in wavelet domain was not used in this method (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Mallat, 2009</ref>). Instead of considering peaks as the sum of delta functions, more generally, we consider MS peaks as a mixture of Gaussian in which each peak corresponds to one Gaussian. We propose to use Gaussian derivative wavelet, instead of Mexican Hat wavelet which is only the second derivative of Gaussian wavelet. Zero-crossing lines which are robust to noise are also introduced to replace Ridge-lines in<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Du et al. (2006)</ref>. We study the zero-crossing lines in multi-scale wavelet and provide new theoretical analysis. In most peak detection methods, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was used to remove the small energy peaks with SNR values less than a threshold. But MS noise cannot be correctly estimated in either time domain or wavelet domain. Thus, in this article, instead of SNR, frequency response, height and SD of Gaussian peaks calculated by zero-crossing in Gaussian derivative wavelet domain are used to remove false peaks. In order to improve sensitivity, the Envelope analysis (<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Nguyen et al., 2009</ref>) is also used to save some important peaks with small energy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>N.Nguyen et al.</head><p>In this article, we propose a new Gaussian derivative wavelet-based peak detection method (GDWavelet) for SurfaceEnhanced Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-Of-Flight (SELDITOF) spectrum. Both simulated and real spectrum with known polypeptide positions and compositions are used to evaluate our method. With simulated data, we compare different peak detection algorithms by both Gaussian and real noise. All experimental results show that our new approach can detect more peaks (in both high and low amplitude) with a lower FDR than state-of-the-art methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">METHODS</head><p>In this section, our new GDWavelet method will be introduced. In GDWavelet, we utilize bivariate smoothing model, Gaussian derivative wavelet and envelope analysis. First, bivariate shrinkage estimator in SWT domain will be used to reduce noise and to keep whole true signal. Second, we will introduce how to detect peaks using Gaussian derivative wavelet through peak properties such as frequency response, SD and height. Finally, envelope analysis is performed to save true small energy peaks which will be missed if only peak properties are used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Smoothing by bivariate shrinkage function</head><p>Noise smoothing in MS is an important step which should remove noise and keep true peaks. In<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Myers et al. (2004)</ref>, they tried to remove noise as much as possible, hence some true peaks were also removed. We propose to utilize bivariate shrinkage estimator in SWT domain to reduce noise and keep whole true signal. More precisely, we decrease the noise level without removing most of them. SWT is chosen due to its fast speed and redundant representations. The later step will further handle the remaining noise. To estimate wavelet coefficients, the most well-known rules are universal thresholding and soft thresholding (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Donoho et al., 1995</ref>) which was applied to Cromwell method (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Coombes et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Morris et al., 2005</ref>). These algorithms assume that wavelet coefficients are independent. Unfortunately, frequency response of peak is rather wide. Hard or soft thresholding only considers coefficients in a sub-band with narrow frequency. Recent research shows that algorithms utilizing the dependency between coefficients can give better results than those using the independency assumption (<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Sendur et al., 2002). Sendur et al.</ref>exploited this dependency between coefficients and proposed a non-Gaussian bivariate pdf for the child coefficient w 1 and its parent w 2 as follows</p><formula>p w (w) = 3 2πσ 2 exp − √ 3 σ |w 1 | 2 +|w 2 | 2 .</formula><formula>(1)</formula><p>The marginal variance σ 2 is dependent on the coefficients index k. By this bivariate pdf and the Bayesian estimation theory, the MAP estimator of w 1 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Sendur et al., 2002</ref>) is derived asˆw</p><formula>asˆ asˆw 1 = ⎧ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎩ 0 i f |y 1 | 2 +|y 2 | 2 &lt; √ 3σn 2 σ , √ |y 1 | 2 +|y 2 | 2 − √ 3σn 2 σ √ |y 1 | 2 +|y 2 | 2 .y 1 otherwise.</formula><formula>(2)</formula><p>where y 1 is child noisy coefficient, y 2 is parent noisy coefficient. This estimator is a bivariate shrinkage function. It has been used to smooth many kinds of signals such as image (<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Sendur et al., 2002</ref>), DNA copy number (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Huang et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Nguyen et al., 2010</ref>), etc. In this article, bivariate shrinkage estimator is used to smooth MS signals. An example of denoising result is shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3a</ref>. This example will be discussed in Section 2.4.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Peak detection by Gaussian derivative wavelet</head><p>In previous works (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Coombes et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Morris et al., 2005</ref>), MS peaks were considered as the sum of delta functions. That means only heights of peaks have been used for peak detection throughout SNR.<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Du et al. (2006)</ref>utilized width of peaks to improve peak detection results a lot. We consider MS peaks as a mixture of Gaussian in which each peak corresponds to one Gaussian:</p><formula>f (t) = N i=1 f i (t) = N i=1 A i exp − (t −µ i ) 2 2σ 2 i .</formula><formula>(3)</formula><p>With this assumption, four parameters providing intrinsic differences between true peaks and noise are peak position, SD, height and frequency response of peak.

(2006).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">Theory of zero-crossing lines in multi-scale</head><p>Scaling theory for zerocrossings has been studied and applied to many applications.<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Yuille et al. (1986)</ref>assumed that signal is the sum of delta functions. Another similar assumption of signal, bandlimited signal, has been studied in<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Vo et al. (1996)</ref>. However, studying zero-crossing of signals with Gaussian mixture assumption still is a new and challenging problem. We will build new theory of zero-crossing lines in multi-scale in following sections. Through our theory, parameters (position, SD, height and frequency response) of a Gaussian peak can be accurately estimated. We use the first derivative of f i (t) to locate local maxima corresponding peak position: f i (t 0 ) = 0 with t 0 = µ i. We continue using the second derivative and third derivative of f i (t) to estimate height and SD of Gaussian peak:</p><formula>f i (t 0 ) = 0 with t 0 = µ i ±σ i , f i (t 0 ) = 0 with t 0 = µ i and t 0 = µ i ± √ 3σ i .</formula><p>Since smoothing performed in denoising step only reduces noise and keeps small true peaks, multi-scales of Gaussian derivative wavelet are used to make local maxima and minima more robust to noise instead of only one Gaussian filter in<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Nguyen et al. (2009)</ref>. The wavelet transform can be written as convolution product in (4):</p><formula>Wf (u,s) = +∞ −∞ f i (t) 1 √ s t −u s dt. (4)</formula><p>According to Chapter 6 in<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Mallat (2009)</ref>, the wavelet transform in (4) can be rewritten as a multi-scale differential operator in (5)</p><formula>W n f (u,s) = s n d n du n (f i ¯ θ s (t)</formula><p>)(u).</p><formula>(5)</formula><p>In this article, the Gaussian wavelet is used. So, ¯ θ s (t) can be followed as (6):</p><formula>¯ θ s (t) = 1 √ s exp − t 2 s 2 .</formula><formula>(6) If convoluting f i (t) and ¯ θ s (t)</formula><p>, we get result in (7)</p><formula>(f i ¯ θ s )(u) = K 1 exp −K 2 (u−µ i ) 2 ,</formula><formula>(7) where K 1 = A 1 2πσ 2 i s 3 and K 2 = 1 s 2 +2σ 2 i . Remark. The zero-crossing of W 1 f (u,s) and W 2 f (u</formula><p>,s) belong to connected curves that are never interrupted when the scale decreases.</p><p>Proof. With the first derivative, (5) can be rewritten as (8)</p><formula>W 1 f (u,s) = 2sK 1 K 2 (u−µ i ) exp −K 2 (u−µ i ) 2 .</formula><formula>(8)</formula><p>If W 1 f (u,s) = 0, we got u 0 = µ i and u 0 (s+1)−u 0 (s) = 0 with any scale s. With the second derivative, (5) can be rewritten as (9):</p><formula>W 2 f (u,s) = 2s 2 K 1 K 2 [−2K 2 (u−µ i )+1] exp −K 2 (u−µ i ) 2 .</formula><formula>(9) If W 2 f (u,s) = 0, we get u 0 = µ i ± σ 2 i + s 2 2</formula><p>, then 0 &lt; u 0 (s+1)−u 0 (s) ≤ 1 with any scale s. With the third derivative, (5) can be rewritten as (10)) and Gaussian noise (SD = 1); (b) Using Gaus1, the zero-crossing line corresponds to peak position, t = 5; (c) Using Gaus2, two zero-crossing lines correspond to two peak edges whose distances to peak position are σ i = 0.5; (d) Using Gaus1, two ridge lines are corresponding to two peak edges whose distances to peak position are σ i = 0.5; (e) Using Gaus3, three zero-crossing lines are corresponding to one peak position and two peak edges whose distances to peak position are √ 3σ i = 0.866; (f) Using Gaus2, three ridge lines are corresponding to one peak position and two peak edges whose distances to peak position are √ 3σ i. 0 ≤ u 0 (s+1)−u 0 (s) ≤ 1 with the first and second derivative and zero-crossing lines belong to connected curves. Another conclusion is that zero-crossing lines is discontinuous lines if the third derivative Gaussian wavelet is used. Thus, only the first and second derivative Gaussian wavelets should be used in peak detection. If f i is a discrete signal, (4) can be rewritten as follows:</p><formula>W 3 f (u,s) =−2s 3 K 1 K 2 · (u−µ i )[2K 2 (u−µ i ) 2 −3] exp −K 2 (u−µ i ) 2 .</formula><formula>(10) If W 3 f (u,s) = 0, we get u 0 = µ i or u 0 = µ i ± √ 3 σ 2 i + s</formula><formula>(d) ( e) ( f)</formula><formula>Wf (u,s) = k f i (k) K+1 k 1 √ s t −u s dt.</formula><formula>(11)</formula><p>We get f (k) by sampling f i (t) with T s :</p><formula>f i (k) = f i (kT s ) = A i exp − (k − µ i Ts ) 2 2( σ i Ts ) 2 .</formula><formula>(12) If W 2 f (u,s) = 0, we get u 0 = µ i ± σ 2 i + (s×Ts) 2 2 . if W 3 f (u,s) = 0, we get u 0 = µ i or u 0 = µ i ± √ 3 σ 2 i + (s×Ts) 2 2 .</formula><p>Note: zero-crossing line is more robust to noise than ridge line. This conclusion is illustrated by an example in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1c</ref>and e show that zero-crossing lines are easier to detect than ridge lines linking local maxima or local minima points.</p></div>

Estimation of peak height: finally, we develop a way to estimate real height of Gaussian peak.

The Mexh, Mexican hat wavelet corresponding to Gaus2, is used as core part to detect peak in CWT method (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Du et al., 2006</ref>) and peak tree method (<ref type="bibr">Zhang et al.,</ref>submitted for publication). Based on result's in<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>, the error rate when using Mexh wavelet (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Du et al., 2006</ref>) is the largest. We note that we use package 'MassSpecWavelet' (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Du et al., 2009</ref>) which uses denoising with DWT and finds peak position using ridge lines (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Du et al., 2006</ref>) with Mexh wavelet. 'Gaus1 with denoise' has the smallest error rate. However, error rates in Gaus1 without denoising and in Gaus2 are still acceptable and much better than in Mexh wavelet. We can estimate σ x by (18) or (21). However, with Gaus3, zero-crossing lines are not continuous lines (see Remark in Section 2.2.1). Thus, estimation of zero-crossing in 128 scales of Gaus3 is a problem. This problem causes a larger error in calculating the σ x. From result of<ref type="figure" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>, we can conclude that Gaus2 with denoising should be used to estimate σ x because its error rate is the smallest. By using (22) with zero-crossing lines of both Gaus2 and Gaus3, the height of Gaussian peak is estimated. In this case, baseline b which is used in (24) is a constant. From<ref type="figure" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>, Gaus2 with denoising gives the smallest error rate and should be used to calculate A x. i662<ref type="bibr">[11:15 28/8/2010 Bioinformatics-btq397.tex]</ref>Page: i663 i659–i665From above example, the best way to estimate peak position µ x is from the first Gaussian derivative wavelet, Gaus1. The second Gaussian derivative wavelet, Gaus2, should be used to estimate SD σ x and height A x of a Gaussian peak.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1d</ref>and f shows Ridge lines which correspond to zero-crossing lines in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1c</ref>and e.

As a result, noise in signal is reduced and smoothed signal still has a little noise. Second, without applying baseline removal that often discards true peaks and creates new peaks, smoothed signal is used to estimate frequency response, position, height and SD of Gaussian peak by zero-crossing lines in multiscale Gaussian derivative wavelet domain. Frequency response of Gaussian peak is proportional to the length of zero-crossing line if the first derivative Gaussian (Gaus1) is used. Peak position, µ i , is estimated by (13). SD, σ i , of Gaussian peak is calculated by (18). Result of (22) with Gaus2 gives heights of peaks. Using the first and the second derivative Gaussian wavelet, we can estimate all parameters of a Gaussian peak. After removing peaks with frequency response and SD less than a threshold, we get all peak candidates. Third, in peak quantification step, we use two rules to remove false peaks:</p><p>(i) all peak candidates are quantified by peak rank (PR;<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Nguyen et al., 2009</ref>) in Envelop analysis. Peaks with PR = 1, even small peaks, are important peaks. (ii) Peak height is used to remove peaks with height smaller than threshold. We use peak height to substitute SNR that was used by<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Morris et al. (2005) and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Du et al. (2006)</ref>, because noise cannot be exactly estimated in either time domain or wavelet domain. Finally, the union results of two quantifying rules are the final detected peaksraw signal and red one is signal smoothed by (2). A zoom in subfigure draws the peak which is used to show its zero-crossing lines in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3b</ref>. Using one zero-crossing line in multi-scale of the Gaus1 and two zero-crossing lines in multi-scale of the Gaus2, position, height, SD, and frequency response of this peak are estimated. In<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3c</ref>, we quantify peaks by two rules: peak height and PR (in Envelope analysis). The circles are results from peak height-based quantification. The stars are from PR-based quantification. Union results include all peaks with heights larger than a threshold or PR one.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 3d</ref>shows receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of four related methods.

Using zero-crossing lines in multi-scale of Gaussian derivative wavelet, there are three ways to estimate peak position as in (13, 14, 15). We compare errors of these estimations 
and CWT's estimation (Du et al., 2006). The error rate is defined by (25). In each Gaussian noise level, σ, we created 200 signals. Error value shown in this table is average value.

			<note place="foot" n="3">.2 Experimental results Three simulated datasets and one real SELDI-TOF dataset are used to create ROC curves in Figures 4 and 5. In all four datasets, the performance of Cromwell is not stable and gets worse than CWT and GDWavelet. Between GaborEnvelop which used Envelope analysis and CWT which used ridge lines and SNR in peak quantification, GaborEnvelop is better than CWT in real data in Figure 4b and CWT is better than GaborEnvelop in simulated data. In all cases, our GDWavelet method has much better performance than GaborEnvelop and CWT methods. At the same FDR, the sensitivity of our method is consistently higher than GaborEnvelops and CWTs. It is clear that utilizing both of Envelope analysis and Gaussian derivative wavelet in peak quantification made significant contributions to detect both high energy and small energy peaks. Bivariate shrinkage estimator in wavelet domain guarantees that denoising step in our method saves more true signal than in Morris et al. (2005). Zero-crossing lines-based peak parameters estimations in our article is more accurate and robust to noise than ridge lines in Du et al. (2006). Envelope analysis is more efficiently used in GDWavelet than in GaborEnvelop. Therefore, the GDWavelet has better peak detection results than Cromwell, GaborEnvelop and CWT. Thus, it is an efficient and accurate method to detect peaks in both real and simulated MS data. In Figures 4 and 5, CWT&apos;s ROC curves is limited in small FDR because two thresholds of the length of ridge lines and the scale corresponding to the maximum amplitude on the ridge line are used as default in MassSpecWavelet (Du et al., 2009). Finally the runtime of GDWavelet algorithm is comparable to CWT method, because both methods need more computational time to decompose a signal to many scale using continuous wavelet transform. 4 CONCLUSIONS In this article, we proposed new zero-crossing line theory in multiscale of Gaussian derivative wavelet to estimate parameters of peaks in MS which has been assumed as a mixture of Gaussian. A novel GDWavelet method was proposed to efficiently and accurately detect MS peaks by integrating bivariate shrinkage model, Gaussian derivative and Envelope analysis. The bivariate shrinkage estimator in SWT domain was used to reduce noise and still keep true peaks. i664 at :: on August 31, 2016 http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from</note>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>N.Nguyen et al.</head><p>(a) (b)in this dataset, we can estimate the sensitivity and the FDR. There are seven polypeptides which create seven true peaks at 7034, 12 230, 16 951, 29 023, 46 671, 66 433 and 147 300 of the m/z values. The sensitivity and FDR of four methods are calculated for 60 real MS signals and three simulated MS datasets with 100 signals each. The SNR thresholding values are increased gradually to calculate the ROC curves of Cromwell and CWT methods. The SNR thresholding values are chosen from 0 to 20 for Cromwell method and from 0 to 120 for CWT method. In our GDWavelet method, the peak height ratio, which is defined as the ratio of current peak height over average height of peaks, is changed from 0 to 10 to build the ROC curve. We plot the average ROC curves in Figures 4 and 5. We should notice that we take average of all ROC points with the same SNR threshold (for Cromwell and CWT) and the same peak height rate (for our GDWavelet method).</p><formula>(a) ( b)</formula></div>			</div>

				<p>Motivation: Probabilistic approaches for inferring transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) and regulatory motifs from DNA sequences have been developed for over two decades. Previous work has shown that prediction accuracy can be significantly improved by incorporating features such as the competition of multiple transcription factors (TFs) for binding to nearby sites, the tendency of TFBSs for co-regulated TFs to cluster and form cis-regulatory modules and explicit evolutionary modeling of conservation of TFBSs across orthologous sequences. However, currently available tools only incorporate some of these features, and significant methodological hurdles hampered their synthesis into a single consistent probabilistic framework. Results: We present MotEvo, a integrated suite of Bayesian probabilistic methods for the prediction of TFBSs and inference of regulatory motifs from multiple alignments of phylogenetically related DNA sequences, which incorporates all features just mentioned. In addition, MotEvo incorporates a novel model for detecting unknown functional elements that are under evolutionary constraint, and a new robust model for treating gain and loss of TFBSs along a phylogeny. Rigorous benchmarking tests on ChIP-seq datasets show that MotEvo&apos;s novel features significantly improve the accuracy of TFBS prediction, motif inference and enhancer prediction.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>What the sequence specificities of different transcription factors (TFs) are and where in the genome their transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) occur remain central questions in gene regulation. For over two decades, a large number of computational methods has been developed that aim to support answering such questions, see e.g.<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bulyk (2003);</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hannenhalli (2008)</ref>for reviews. Although *To whom correspondence should be addressed. much progress has been made, it remains highly challenging to obtain accurate computational TFBS predictions, especially on a genome-wide scale. For example, although from a biophysical point of view identical sequence segments should have equal affinity for the TF, one typically finds that only a small fraction of the sequences with high binding affinity act as functional TFBSs. That is, TFBS functionality is context dependent and thus researchers have searched for additional features that are predictive for the functionality of putative sites. One approach that has proven particularly fruitful is comparative genomic analysis of the conservation of putative TFBSs across related species, i.e. putative TFBSs that are highly conserved are generally more likely to be functional. A large number of approaches for incorporating conservation information has been proposed including several simple ad hoc methods, e.g.<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kellis et al. (2003)</ref>, but it has become clear that highest performance is obtained by methods that use explicit evolutionary models for the evolution of TFBSs along a phylogeny (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hawkins et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Moses et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Siddharthan et al., 2005</ref>). As a consequence, there has been considerable interest in extending methods for regulatory motif finding and TFBS prediction to include such explicit phylogenetic models. For example, the well-known Gibbs sampling (<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Lawrence et al., 1993</ref>) and expectation–maximization strategies (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bailey and Elkan, 1994</ref>) for ab initio motif finding have been extended to methods that work on multiple alignments of orthologous sequences and use explicit evolutionary models (<ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Siddharthan et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Sinha et al., 2004</ref>). Beyond conservation information, other features have also proven highly useful in improving the accuracy of TFBS prediction. For example, especially in higher eukaryotes, functional TFBSs often come in clusters where multiple binding sites for a small subset of TFs co-occur in close proximity to each other (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Davidson, 2001</ref>). Several methods were developed that, instead of looking for TFBSs for one TF at a time, explicitly look for clusters of sites for a collection of TFs. These methods have been especially successful in identifying cis-regulatory modules that are distal to their target gene (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Frith et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Rajewsky et al., 2002</ref>). It has also proven useful to take into account the contribution of many weak binding sites and the competitive binding of multiple TFs to a DNA sequence by explicitly considering all possible configurations of non-overlapping binding sites using a dynamic programming procedure, e.g.<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Rajewsky et al. (2002);</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Roider et al. (2007)</ref>;<ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Wasson and Hartemink (2009)</ref>. However, currently these methodologies are spread over multiple computational tools each of which only implements some of these methods. For example, the methods for finding cis-regulatory modules have been extended to analyze pairs of aligned species (<ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Sinha et al., 2003</ref>) but not to general multiple alignments and phylogenetic relationships. Other methods can only make predictions for one TF at a time, ignoring the competitive binding of multiple TFs [e.g.<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Moses et al. (2004)</ref>;<ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Sinha et al. (2004)</ref>] and the methods that incorporate sophisticated models for explicitly considering all possible binding configurations of multiple TFs cannot incorporate conservation information [e.g.<ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Wasson and Hartemink (2009)]</ref>. Beyond this, as we show below, current methods that incorporate explicit evolutionary models make several implicit assumptions that cause 'pathologies' that significantly affect their performance. Here we present a computational tool, MotEvo, that integrates a suite of Bayesian probabilistic methods for the prediction of regulatory sites and motifs on multiple alignments of phylogenetically related sequences. MotEvo not only implements and extends the functionality of many of the tools and methods mentioned in the introduction into a single integrated method, it also incorporates a number of new features that address the 'pathologies' that current methods suffer from, as we explicitly demonstrate below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">METHODS</head><p>MotEvo takes as input either sequences from a single species or multiple alignments of orthologous sequences from several species, a collection of one or more position-specific weight matrices (WMs), and a phylogenetic tree relating the species. The user designates one of the species as the 'reference species' and MotEvo can then be asked to provide the following. @BULLET Posterior probabilities for a TFBS for each possible WM to occur at each position in the input sequences of the reference species. @BULLET The probability, at each position, for an unknown functional element (UFE) to occur, i.e. a TFBS for an unknown motif not contained in the input set. @BULLET The estimated site densities for each WM and for UFEs (possibly fitted to the data). @BULLET Updated versions of the WMs (fitted to the data).</p><p>@BULLET Log-likelihood ratio scores, at each position, for the occurrence of cis-regulatory modules containing TFBSs for the input motifs.</p><p>We now discuss the methods that MotEvo uses to calculate these quantities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Binding site configurations</head><p>We first introduce some notation. We denote by {S} a collection of multiple alignments of sequences, by S an individual multiple alignment (or a segment from such an alignment) and by s an individual sequence or sequence segment. To indicate the segment of length l from sequence s, starting at position (i+1) we use the notation s<ref type="bibr">[i,l]</ref>, and similarly S [i,l] indicates columns (i+1) through (i+l) of the multiple alignment S. Column numbers are always counted with respect to the position in the reference sequence. As in most approaches, we assume that nucleotides at different positions in TFBSs are statistically independent and use position-specific WMs to represent TF binding specificities. We denote a collection of WMs by {w} and a single WM from the set by w. The weight matrix entry w i α denotes the probability that nucleotide α occurs at position i of a binding site for WM w. MotEvo considers all ways in which configurations of TFBSs (<ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>) for the WMs {w} can be assigned to the sequences of the reference species.<ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>. A segment from a multiple alignment of orthologous mammalian sequences, together with an example configuration of three binding sites: one for the motif of the CCCTC-binding factor TF (CTCF) and two for the motif of the serum response factor TF (SRF). Human is considered the reference species. Note that hypothesized TFBSs are not allowed to overlap within one configuration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Fig. 2. A single</head><p>hypothesized TFBS for CTCF on a segment of the multiple alignment. For each sequence s, the species from which it derives is shown on the right, and its WM score is shown on the left. The species with WM score larger than zero are selected (red sequences), the subtree involving these species of the full phylogenetic tree (red subtree of the black tree on the right) is obtained and the probability of the selected sequences is calculated under an evolutionary model that incorporates selective constraints set by the WM. A sequence logo (<ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Schneider and Stephens, 1990</ref>) of the CTCF motif is shown below the alignment. To explain how MotEvo calculates probabilities of possible configurations, we first explain how MotEvo scores a single hypothesized TFBS.<ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>shows a single hypothesized site for the CTCF motif from the TFBS configuration of<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. MotEvo calculates a probability ratio P(S|w,T )/P(S|b,T ) for observing this multiple alignment segment assuming that the sequences are evolving under constraints set by the WM w and assuming that the sequences are evolving 'neutrally' under a background model b, given the phylogenetic tree T. In contrast to most algorithms that implement explicit phylogenetic models, e.g.<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Moses et al. (2004)</ref>, MotEvo takes into account that functional TFBSs may only occur in a subset of the species. Sites may either have been truly lost or gained in some species during evolution, or sites may appear to have been lost as a consequence of errors in the multiple alignments. After experimenting with several procedures for treating these possibilities, including explicit models that incorporate rates of gain and loss of sites along different branches of the tree, we found that the most robust results are obtained using the following species selection procedure. We follow the generally made assumption that TFs bind DNA in a fixed configuration, so that TFBSs for a single TF have a fixed length. Consequently, only species that are gaplessly aligned with respect to the reference can have an orthologous TFBS at the same location in the alignment. For example, in<ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>the alignment implies that no orthologous site appears in dog. For every species that is gaplessly aligned relative to the reference, MotEvo calculates the probability of its sequence</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Probabilities under the evolutionary model</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Page: 489 487–494</head><p>MotEvo s under the WM and under a background model b. The probability P(s|w) of a sequence segment s under the WM w is simply given by the product of WM-components, i.e.</p><formula>P(s|w) = l i=1 w i s i ,</formula><formula>(1)</formula><p>where l is the length of the WM and s i is the nucleotide occurring at position i in sequence s. MotEvo allows for a variety of background models. In the simplest model, there are four parameters b α representing the probabilities for a nucleotide α to occur at a background position. MotEvo also allows k-th order background models in which the probability of a nucleotide depends on the k preceding nucleotides, i.e. 4 k+1 conditional probabilities P(s i |s i−1 s i−2 ...s i−k ) that are estimated from the input sequences by default. For the simple singlenucleotide background model, P(s|b) is given by replacing the WM entries w i s i with the corresponding background probabilities b s i in Equation (1), and analogously for the higher order models. We refer to the log-ratio log[P(s|w)/P(s|b)] as the WM score of sequence s. For the species selection procedure, MotEvo selects all species for which the WM score is larger than zero (the red sequences in<ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>). The key assumption that MotEvo now makes is that, whatever the reason is for the apparent loss of the TFBS from certain species, they should not contribute to the evolutionary evidence for a TFBS to occur at this position in the reference species. Specifically, we obtain the subtree T that is defined by the subset of 'red' species ( indicated in<ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>) and replace the probability ratio P(S|w,T )/P(S|b,T ) by the one obtained using only this subtree, i.e. by P(S|w,T )/P(S|b,T ). This ensures that the 'black' sequences in<ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>do not contribute to the ratio P(S|w,T )/P(S|b,T ). The probability ratio P(S|w,T )/P(S|b,T ) is the product of independent contributions from the individual alignment columns, i.e.</p><formula>P(S|w,T ) P(S|b,T ) = l i=1 P(S i |w i ,T ) P(S i |b,T ) ,</formula><formula>(2)</formula><p>where w i denotes the i-th WM column. Imagine an alignment column that is evolving under the constraints set by WM column w i and consider one branch of the phylogenetic tree T. Distances d along the branches of T are measured by the number of expected substitutions per neutrally evolving site. The key evolutionary quantities are the probabilities P(α|β,w i ,d) that, when evolving under WM column w i along a branch of length d, a base β evolves into a base α. MotEvo uses a F81 model (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Felsenstein, 1981</ref>). In this model, the transition probabilities are given by</p><formula>P(α|β,w i ,d) = δ αβ e −d +w i α 1−e −d .</formula><formula>(3)</formula><p>Although it is straightforward to implement more sophisticated evolutionary models, such as the model of Halpern and Bruno (1998) in practice the F81 model behaves very similarly. We chose the F81 model for consistency with the UFE model calculations, which require the F81 model to be computationally tractable (see below). The probability P(S i |w i ,T ) is given by multiplying the probabilities P(α|β,w i ,T ) for the transitions at each of the branches of the tree, setting α to the corresponding nucleotide for branches leading to the leafs of the tree, and summing over the unknown nucleotides at all internal nodes of the tree. To calculate the sum over the nucleotides at the internal nodes, we use recursion relations introduced by Felsenstein (1981) (see Supplementary Materials for details). For the single nucleotide background model, the probability P(S|b,T ) is calculated entirely analogously, i.e. simply replacing the WM column w i with the column of background frequencies b in the above equations. One novel feature of MotEvo is that it allows the use of higher order background models in a phylogenetic setting by estimating the sequence context at internal nodes by averaging over their descendants in the tree (see Supplementary Materials for details).<ref type="figure">Fig. 3.</ref>A small segment of a multiple alignment of orthologous mammalian sequences. The stars at the bottom of the alignment indicate columns that are perfectly conserved across all six species. A hypothetical binding site for the SRF motif is indicated (blue box) and the WM scores are shown for each of the sequences s. Without the UFE model, MotEvo assigns a posterior probability of 0.97 for a site for SRF to occur at this position, whereas with the UFE this probability drops to 0.01.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Unknown functional elements</head><p>Even though the number of TFs for which WM models are available is increasing steadily, the sequence specificity of the large majority of TFs is still unknown for most model organisms. Consequently, within the input alignments, there are likely many binding sites for TFs that are not represented by the WMs in our set {w}. Moreover, these TFBSs will often show significant evolutionary conservation, i.e. much more than can be expected under the background model and this can have undesirable consequences, as illustrated in<ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. In this example, a TFBS for the SRF motif is predicted with high probability, despite the fact that the sequences show very poor matches to the WM (with the exception of mouse). The reason for this pathological behavior is that algorithms that do not explicitly take into account that UFEs may occur in the input sequences, are forced to choose at each position of the alignment between assuming that the alignment segment contains a TFBS for one of the WMs in the input set, or that the alignment segment contains neutrally evolving sequences. Given a segment that is much more conserved than can be expected under neutral evolution, such algorithms may thus assign a high posterior to a site for WM w occurring, even when the sequences in the segment poorly match the WM. To avoid such spurious predictions, MotEvo explicitly takes into account that the input alignments will contain well-conserved segments for motifs other than those in our input set {w}, which we call Unknown Functional Elements (UFEs). To calculate the probability P ufe (S k |T ) of a single alignment column under the UFE, we integrate the probability P(S k |w k ,T ) over all possible WM columns w k , i.e.</p><formula>P ufe (S k |T ) = P(S k |w k ,T )P(w k )dw k ,</formula><formula>(4)</formula><p>where P(w k ) is a prior distribution over possible alignment columns for which MotEvo uses a Dirichlet prior (see Supplementary Material). To be able to calculate such integrals analytically, MotEvo uses the F81 model for the evolution along each branch of the tree. The Supplementary Materials provide details of the calculation of this integral. Another parameter used by MotEvo is the length l u of the UFE model, which is generally set to the typical length of TFBSs. The UFE model is then treated as any other WM, and the probability ratio P ufe (S|T )/P(S|b,T ) is calculated for the l u consecutive alignment columns of an hypothesized site of the UFE. For the example shown in<ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>, when the UFE model of length 10 is used, the posterior of the SRF motif drops to 0.01 and sites for the UFE are predicted in this area with moderate posteriors. Note that MotEvo can also be run using only the UFE model. In this way, a conservation profile that quantifies the evidence for purifying selection across the alignments canPage: 490 487–494</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>P.Arnold et al.</head><p>be obtained without the need of providing specific motifs (Molina and van Nimwegen, 2008), i.e. providing a functionality similar to algorithms such as phastcons (<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Siepel et al., 2005</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Forward/backward algorithm</head><p>In contrast to MONKEY (<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Moses et al., 2004</ref>) and other algorithms that scan with a single WM at a time, MotEvo predicts TFBSs for an arbitrary number of WMs and considers all possible configurations of nonoverlapping TFBSs. Above we calculated the WM/background probability ratio P(S|w,T )/P(S|b,T ) for alignment segment S assuming a single hypothesized site for w. The probability ratio for an entire alignment given a configuration containing multiple binding sites is simply the product of the ratios for each of the binding sites. Note that all parts of the alignment where no binding sites occur do not contribute to this ratio, i.e. their contributions cancel between numerator and denominator. To assign prior probabilities to configurations, MotEvo assumes that scanning the reference species sequence from left to right, there is at each position a probability π w for a site for WM w to start. For notational simplicity, we consider both the UFE model and the background model b as members of our set {w} of WMs. The prior probability for a binding site configuration in which there are n w sites for WM w is then proportional to w</p><formula>π w nw .</formula><formula>(5)</formula><p>Note that we have the normalization condition</p><formula>w π w = 1.</formula><p>To calculate posterior probabilities, we will need to sum over the probability ratios of all possible binding site configurations, i.e. calculate a partition sum. To this end, we use recursion relations similar to those of the forward/backward algorithm used in the theory of hidden Markov models (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Durbin et al., 1998</ref>). Let the sum of the probability ratios of all possible configurations of TFBSs up to position n in the reference species be denoted by F n. Noting that any configuration ending at position n in the reference species has to end with a site for one of our WMs (which now include the background and UFE models), we have the recursion relation</p><formula>F n = w∈{w} π w P(S [n−lw,lw] |w,T ) P(S [n−lw,lw] |b,T ) F n−lw ,</formula><formula>(6)</formula><p>where l w is the length of WM w. Instead of moving from left to right over the multiple alignment, we can also move from right to left and define R n as the sum over the probability ratios of all possible binding site configurations from position n until the end of the alignment. Further details are provided in the Supplementary Materials.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">TFBS predictions</head><p>Once the forward and backward sums F n and R n have been obtained, we can calculate the posterior probabilities P(w,n|S,{w},T ) that a binding site for WM w occurs at positions n+1 through n+l w :</p><formula>P(w,n|S,{w},T ) = F n P(S [n,lw ] |w,T ) P(S [n,lw ] |b,T ) π w R n+lw+1 F L ,</formula><formula>(7)</formula><p>where F L is the sum over probability ratios of all configurations for the entire alignment of length L. Note that the sum over all configurations in which a site for w occurs at n is equal to the sum over all possible configurations up to position n and all configurations from (n+l w +1) onwards. Using the procedures described above, posterior probabilities P(w,n|S,{w},T ) at every position n for every WM w can be calculated in a time that is proportional to product of the length of the multiple alignment L, the number of WMs and the number of species in the alignment. This linear scaling of the runtime allows MotEvo to make comprehensive site predictions for very large sequences using a large number of WMs in relatively short computational times. For example, when a TF is known to have different types of binding sites, e.g. half-sites separated by spacers of different lengths, MotEvo can easily run with WMs for each site type in parallel. Note that, when running on a single sequence, MotEvo is equivalent to a statistical mechanical model that calculates the binding frequencies along the genome of multiple factors competing for binding along the genome, i.e. on a single sequence MotEvo is equivalent to the approach presented in<ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Wasson and Hartemink (2009)</ref>. In this biophysical interpretation, the WM scores correspond to binding energies, the WM priors correspond to the concentrations of the different factors and the posterior probabilities correspond to the fractions of time a given TF is bound at a given site.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6">Prior updating</head><p>The prior probability distribution over binding site configurations is parametrized by the vector π that gives the expected binding site density π w for each WM w, including the background and UFE models. This prior π can be specified by the user, but MotEvo can also use an expectation– maximization algorithm to find the vector π that maximizes the probability of the observed alignments {S}. We start with an initial prior vector π and calculate the posterior probabilities P(w,n|S,{w},T ) for all alignments in the set {S}. We then calculate, for each WM, the sum n w of the posterior probabilities P(w,n|S,{w},T ) over all positions n in all alignments S. That is, n w represents to the total expected number of binding sites for WM w. Using these MotEvo calculates a new prior vector</p><formula>π w = n w w ∈{w} n w ,</formula><formula>(8)</formula><p>and calculates new posterior probabilities P(w,n|S,{w},T ) using this new prior vector. This procedure is iterated until the prior vector converges. It is easy to show, see e.g. van<ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Nimwegen (2007)</ref>, that this expectation– maximization procedure maximizes the probability of the input alignments with respect to the prior vector π.</p></div>

They are characterized by a high density of TFBSs for a particular subset of TFs and they are typically a few hundred base pairs in length. They can occur both upstream, downstream or in an intron of their target gene (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Arnosti and Kulkarni, 2005</ref>). To find enhancers, MotEvo extends previously developed algorithms (<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Rajewsky et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Sinha et al., 2003</ref>) to multiple alignments with an arbitrary number of species and phylogenetic relationships. A window of a given length (typically a few hundred base pairs) is slid over the input alignments and for each window MotEvo predicts posterior probabilities of binding site occurrence for the set of input WMs. Importantly, MotEvo then updates the priors π w separately for each window, allowing it to adapt the binding site densities to each window. Note that, because TFBSs cannot overlap within a single configuration, the prior updating roughly tries to maximize the number of TFBSs for the input WMs that can be bound at the same time to a given region. To assign a final enhancer score to a window, MotEvo calculates the log-ratio of the sum of the probabilities of all possible binding site configurations and the probability of the configuration with only background columns.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.8">Weight matrix refinement</head><p>MotEvo also implements an expectation–maximization procedure for refining WMs based on its TFBS predictions. Formally, the idea is to maximize the probability of the entire input data {S} with respect to the WMs {w}, starting from the WMs that were provided as input. As shown in the Supplementary Materials, this maximization can be obtained to a good approximation, using the following procedurein the WM and each nucleotide α, the sum n i α (w) of the posterior probabilities of all putative TFBSs that have a nucleotide α occurring at position i of the site in the reference species. That is, the statistics n i α (w) calculate the expected total number of TFBSs for WM w that, in the reference species, have nucleotide α at position i. Note that MotEvo can also be instructed to ignore sites with posteriors below a cut-off in calculating these sums. MotEvo then updates the WM as follows:</p><formula>w i α = n iα (w) β n iβ (w) .</formula><formula>(9)</formula><p>Site predictions are then performed with these updated WMs and this procedure is repeated until the WMs converge. Using this procedure, MotEvo thus extends the functionality of the PhyME algorithm (<ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Sinha et al., 2004</ref>), allowing for the simultaneous expectation–maximization of multiple motifs in parallel.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">RESULTS</head><p>Although a key benefit of MotEvo as a computational tool is that it integrates cutting-edge methods within a single executable, we here focus on evaluating the performance benefits of the novel features that MotEvo implements. For benchmarking, we collected five datasets (<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Jothi et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Valouev et al., 2008</ref>) in which chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) was performed for the human TFs CTCF, GABP, NRSF, SRF and STAT1. Using the peak finder MACS (<ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Zhang et al., 2008</ref>), we determined the regions bound by the TF in question for each ChIP-seq dataset. Binding regions that occurred in more than one dataset were removed to ensure that (at least in the conditions tested) only one TF is bound to each region. Finally, we selected the 900 regions with highest enrichment from each dataset (see Supplementary Materials for details). Using pairwise genome alignments from the UCSC database (<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Karolchik et al., 2008</ref>), we extracted orthologous regions from six other mammals (mouse, dog, cow, monkey, horse and opossum) and obtained seven-way multiple alignments using T-coffee (<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Notredame et al., 2000</ref>). For NRSF, GABP, SRF and STAT1 known WM motifs were taken from the literature (<ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Vlieghe et al., 2006</ref>) and a CTCF WM was inferred from ChIP-chip data in fly (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Holohan et al., 2007</ref>). To test the new features, we predict TFBSs with MotEvo on the benchmarking dataset both using the feature and with the feature turned off. We then compare the TFBS predictions and evaluate to what extent the TFBS predictions are able to infer which region was bound by which TF. In addition, we compared MotEvo's performance on these datasets with those of MONKEY (<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Moses et al., 2004</ref>) and PhyloScan (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Carmack et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Palumbo and Newberg, 2010</ref>). Finally, we test the performance of motifs obtained using MotEvo's motif refinement and compare it with the performance of motifs inferred by MEME (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bailey and Elkan, 1994</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">The UFE model strongly reduces spurious predictions</head><p>We argued above that, without the UFE, highly conserved regions are often mistakenly predicted as TFBSs for WMs in our set, even when the sequences poorly match the corresponding motif. To test this, we predicted TFBSs on all regions, once including the UFE and once without it. For each TF, we determined the WM score of the sequence occurring in the reference species at each predicted TFBS,and constructed histograms of the distributions of WM scores (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig.  4</ref>and Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig. S1</ref>). Inclusion of the UFE in general leads to substantial changes in the predicted TFBSs. First of all, the total number of predicted TFBSs is much lower with the UFE. Second, the UFE specifically causes predicted TFBSs that have a weak match to the motif to disappear. Finally, using the UFE the fraction of predicted TFBSs that fall in 'correct' regions, i.e. regions that were immunoprecipitated with the corresponding TF often increases dramatically, i.e. from around 40% to over 90% for three of the five TFs (insets of<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 4</ref>and Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig. S1</ref>). However, from this test it is not clear if this increased specificity comes with a cost in sensitivity of the site predictions, which we address in the following test.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">MotEvo's novel features improve TFBS prediction</head><p>To test MotEvo's performance, and the role of its novel features in a realistic setting, we tested how accurately the TFBS predictions can distinguish which region was bound by which of the five TFs. For each motif w and each region r, we assign a score n(r,w) by summing the posterior probabilities of all predicted TFBSs for w in r. We then obtain a sensitivity/positive predictive value (PPV) curve by, as a function of a cut-off on the score n(r,w), calculating the fraction of all regions bound by the corresponding TF that have a score above the cut-off (sensitivity) and the fraction of all regions with score above the cut-off that were indeed bound by the TF (PPV). We gather such sensitivity/PPV curves using MotEvo in its standard form, with the UFE model turned off, and with species selection turned off, i.e. including sequences from all gaplessly aligned species at each putative site. We also obtained binding site predictions for two TFBS prediction algorithms that also incorporate an explicit evolutionary model: MONKEY (<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Moses et al., 2004</ref>) and PhyloScan (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Carmack et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Palumbo and Newberg, 2010</ref>) (see Supplementary Materials for details), and determined their sensitivity/PPV curves. We first of all see that, without the UFE, MotEvo's performance is dramatically reduced. In particular, because of the large number of spuriously predicted sites, no high specificity can be obtained without the UFE (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 5</ref>and Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig. S2</ref>). Only at very high sensitivities, i.e. when detecting even the regions with the Page: 492 487–494weakest TFBSs, is the performance relatively unaffected. Besides the UFE, MotEvo explicitly considers that TFBSs may have been lost in a subset of the species, either through evolution or simply because of errors in the multiple alignment, by using the 'species selection' scheme described above. We find that species selection leads to an increase in performance for all TFs (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig.  S2</ref>) ranging from small improvements at some TFs (NSRF, CTCF) to moderate or even very large improvements for others (GABP and SRF,<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 5</ref>). Thus, MotEvo's method for treating loss and gain of TFBSs within the phylogeny significantly outperforms methods that assume that all sequences in the multiple alignment are evolving under the same selective constraints determined by the WM. Although we invested some efforts optimizing the performance of MONKEY and PhyloScan on this dataset (see Supplementary Materials), MotEvo significantly outperforms these algorithms (Fig.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">WM refinement improves TFBS predictions</head><p>Through the availability of next-generation sequencing technologies, many laboratories have started performing ChIP-seqof TFs of interest, and the number of available datasets is increasing rapidly. As ChIP-seq is able to identify large numbers, i.e. hundreds to thousands, of binding regions for a given TF genome-wide, this offers the possibility to investigate the binding specificity of TFs at much higher levels of resolution than was previously possible. MotEvo implements an expectation–maximization strategy for refining WMs from an input dataset of binding regions which we here test using the same benchmarking ChIP-seq data for five TFs. For each of the five TFs, we randomly selected 450 of the 900 peaks and pooled them into one large dataset that we used as a test set. The remaining 450 regions for each TF were used as a training set for WM refinement. Besides MotEvo, we also used MEME (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bailey and Elkan, 1994</ref>) to infer a WM motif for each of the five test sets. Sequence logos of the original and inferred motifs are shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 6</ref>and Supplementary Figures S3 and S4. To test the performance of these WMs in identifying which TF binds to which target region, we predicted TFBSs for all original and refined WMs on the test set using MotEvo. As in the previous section, we assign a score n(r,w) for each WM w to each region r by summing the posterior probabilities of predicted TFBSs, and obtain sensitivity/PPV curves that quantify the performance of the TFBSs in predicting which TF was bound by each region (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 6</ref>and Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig. S3</ref>). The improvement that refinement provides over the literature motif ranges from virtually no difference between original and refined WMs (GABP), through moderate improvements (SRF), to very dramatic improvements (CTCF). It is notable that, even when there is a clear difference in performance of the original and refined WMs, the sequence logos appear very similar visually. This illustrates that subtle changes in the WM can have substantial effects on TFBS predictions. Interestingly, in the case of STAT1 the refined motif is closer to a true palindrome than the original motif, suggesting that these sites are bound by the TF in dimer form. This is supported by the literature, i.e. it is known that STAT1 is 'activated' through phosphorylation at a tyrosine, after which STAT1 proteins form homo-dimers that are translocated to the nucleus to regulate transcription (<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">McBride and Reich, 2003</ref>). The most dramatic improvement in performance is observed for CTCF.This is not surprising given that, in contrast to the other TFs in this set, for CTCF the original WM was based on data from Drosophila. That is, it is plausible that the precise sequence specificity of CTCF may differ between Drosophila and human. MotEvo's refined WMs outperform the WMs inferred by MEME for all TFs (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 6</ref>and Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig. S3</ref>). Although the difference is marginal for NRSF, for some of the TFs MEME's motif performs clearly worse than the literature motif (see Supplementary Materials for further discussion). In summary, our results show that MotEvo's WM refinement consistently improves the ability of the WM to distinguish regions bound by the TF from regions that are bound by other TFs. In addition, this improvement can be very large in some cases.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Enhancer prediction accuracy increases with the number of species used</head><p>Finally, we evaluated MotEvo's ability to predict distal cisregulatory modules (also called enhancers). For testing, we used the set of 76 experimentally validated blastoderm cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) that was collected in<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Ivan et al. (2008)</ref>. The length of these CRMs ranges from ∼90 bp to 2 kb. For each CRM, we extracted the flanking region of 5 kb before and after the CRM on the genome. We then multiply-align these regions with other sequenced Drosophila species. As it is likely that these regions contain other blastoderm CRMs that are unknown, we shuffle the aligned columns of the flanking region without changing the conservation pattern, that is to say we substitute each column by a column with similar conservation (same gap pattern and subset of species that has the same base as the reference). Exonic regions are also excluded. To test how prediction accuracy depends on the number of species used in the multiple alignments, we made several pruned versions of the multiple alignments by selecting different subsets of the available species, ranging from only the melanogaster sequence, to sequences from nine available species (see Supplementary Materials and Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. S5</ref>for details). We use MotEvo with seven WMs for Drosophila TFs known to be involved in binding to these enhancers (Bcd, Cad, Dl, Hb, Kni, Kr and Tll), to perform enhancer predictions on all multiple alignments, selecting for each alignment the 900 bp window with the highest enhancer score as the predicted enhancer. To assess the performance, we calculated for each alignment the overlap between the predicted and the known enhancer. As<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>shows, the performance increases significantly as the number of species increases, reaching over 90% performance when nine species are used. This illustrates that MotEvo's ability to predict enhancers on multiple alignments of an arbitrary number of species significantly improves accuracy over methods that only allow pairwise analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">DISCUSSION</head><p>From a theoretical point of view, the major advantage of the MotEvo method we presented here is that it integrates cuttingedge Bayesian probabilistic methods for the prediction of TFBSs, regulatory motifs and conservation patterns within one consistent theoretical frame work, developing several novel features such as the UFE model and species selection in the process. In addition, our benchmarking tests have demonstrated that these features improve MotEvo's performance, and that MotEvo outperforms currently available methods. Another major advantage of the MotEvo tool is its versatility, i.e. by simple changes to the parameter file the tool can perform a wide array of tasks ranging from motif inference, to enhancer prediction, to conservation profile mapping, site density estimation and of course TFBS prediction. Moreover, essentially all variables used by the algorithm, from phylogeny to background models, to priors, can be controlled by the user, allowing these to be adapted to a wide range of applications. For example, using MotEvo in combination with genome-wide mapping of transcription start sites we have predicted functional TFBSs for hundreds of WMs in proximal promoters in human, mouse (<ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Suzuki et al., 2009</ref>), yeast (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chen et al., 2010</ref>) and Escherichia coli. We have also obtained refined WMs using MotEvo on ChIP-seq datasets for a number of TFs beyond those studied here. All these TFBS and motif predictions are available for download from our SwissRegulon database at www.swissregulon.unibas.ch. As experimental validation of the functionality of individual TFBSs is extremely labor intensive, it remains highly challenging to estimate the accuracy of large-scale TFBS predictions. In the past, it has sometimes been assumed that ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq datasets can be treated as a gold standard, but our own analysis suggests that computational predictions can, in fact, be considerable more accurate in mapping functional sites than such high-throughput experimental approaches (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chen et al., 2010</ref>). What is clear is that TF binding and function is highly context dependent. For a TF with a short degenerate motif, there may be millions of sites genome wide with motif matches at least as high as known functional sites, but in a typical ChIP-seq experiment only a few thousand of these are found to be actually bound, and even among these only a subset may directly affect gene expression. In the search for variables that provide important context, it is important to distinguish those that are merely predictive for the functionality of TFBSs from those that are explanatory. Crossspecies conservation is an example of an explanatory variable, i.e. highly conserved TFBSs are more likely to be functional, but conservation is not explanatory; sequences in other species cannot explain why a particular sequence is bound or functional in a given species. In higher eukaryotes, the chromatin state is likely to be an important explanatory variable. In areas where the nucleosomes are densely packaging the DNA, it may be hard for a TF to access an individual site in the DNA. This may explain why functional TFBSs come in clusters of nearby sites for co-expressed TFs: these TFs may passively cooperate in displacing the nucleosomes from the DNA. Such a model can potentially explain the observation that the genomic binding pattern observed for a given TF is dependent on the expression profiles of other TFs (<ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Wilczynski and Furlong, 2010</ref>). However, to what extent binding and function of TFBSs is dependent on a high-order 'grammar' of TFBS configurations, i.e. the precise Page: 494 487–494</p></div>

			<note place="foot" n="5"> and Supplementary Fig. S2). Especially striking is the inability of these algorithms to reach high sensitivity for motifs with high information content (NRSF, CTCF). Manual inspection of the differences in the predictions of MotEvo, PhyloScan and MONKEY strongly suggest that MONKEY and PhyloScan&apos;s performance is most affected by their inability to deal with alignment segments where a binding site occurs in only some of the species, i.e. where some of the species have either gaps relative to the reference species or low WM scores (see Supplementary Materials for more discussion). These algorithms effectively assume that a functional site must appear in all species of the alignment, and for multiple alignments involving seven species there are many cases where this is too restrictive an assumption. Finally, we checked whether MotEvo&apos;s performance is strongly affected by the alignment algorithm used (Supplementary Fig. S6) and find that sensitivity/PPV curves change only marginally when using different alignment methods. Similarly, use of a higher order background model also only marginally improves performance on these benchmarking datasets (Supplementary Fig. S6).</note>

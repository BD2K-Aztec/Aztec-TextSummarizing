				<p>Motivation: Many intracellular signaling processes are mediated by interactions involving peptide recognition modules such as SH3 domains. These domains bind to small, linear protein sequence motifs which can be identified using high-throughput experimental screens such as phage display. Binding motif patterns can then be used to computationally predict protein interactions mediated by these domains. While many protein–protein interaction prediction methods exist, most do not work with peptide recognition module mediated interactions or do not consider many of the known constraints governing physiologically relevant interactions between two proteins. Results: A novel method for predicting physiologically relevant SH3 domain-peptide mediated protein–protein interactions in S. cerevisae using phage display data is presented. Like some previous similar methods, this method uses position weight matrix models of protein linear motif preference for individual SH3 domains to scan the proteome for potential hits and then filters these hits using a range of evidence sources related to sequence-based and cellular constraints on protein interactions. The novelty of this approach is the large number of evidence sources used and the method of combination of sequence based and protein pair based evidence sources. By combining different peptide and protein features using multiple Bayesian models we are able to predict high confidence interactions with an overall accuracy of 0.97.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Protein–protein interactions (PPIs) are physical associations between protein pairs in a specific biological context. Their knowledge provides important insights into the functioning of a cell. Previously, experimental detection of PPIs was limited to labor intensive techniques such as co-immunoprecipitation or affinity chromatography (<ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Skrabanek et al., 2008</ref>). Though the detected PPIs are largely accurate, these techniques are difficult to apply to whole proteome analysis. This led to the development of various high-throughput PPI detection protocols such as mass-spectrometry combined with affinity-purification, yeast twohybrid and next-generation sequencing to detect PPIs at whole genome level (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Braun et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Davy et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Ito et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">McCraith et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Rain et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Uetz et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Yu et al., 2011</ref>). However, genome-scale methods are also highly resource intensive and single projects and techniques do not cover all known protein interactions. Further, they only cover interactions in one organism at a time. Computational approaches designed to predict reliable and novel PPIs based on experimental interaction datasets have the advantages that they are inexpensive to apply to genomes, including those that are V C The Author 2016.

Multiple kinds of protein–protein interactions exist. We focus on interactions involving peptide recognition modules (PRMs), in particular Src homology three (SH3), which are important in many cellular signaling processes. These domains bind to small, linear sequence motifs (peptides) within proteins (<ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Pawson and Nash, 2003</ref>). SH3 domains are approximately 60 amino acids long with five beta strands organized into two perpendicular beta sheets interrupted by a 3–10 helix (<ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Pawson and Gish, 1992</ref>). They often bind to proline-rich regions and multiple classes have been recognized based on their binding motifs. Class I SH3 domains bind to<ref type="bibr">[</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Mayer, 2001</ref>). They can also bind to proline-free regions containing arginine or lysine (<ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Tong et al., 2002</ref>). SH3 domains are involved in many regulatory or signaling processes, including endocytosis (<ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Tonikian et al., 2009</ref>), actin cytoskeleton regulation (<ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Pawson and Schlessingert, 1993</ref>) and tyrosine kinase pathways (<ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Schlessinger, 1994</ref>). Experimental methods such as phage display (<ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Tong et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Tonikian et al., 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Tonikian et al., , 2009</ref>) and peptide microarray (<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Hu et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">MacBeath and Schreiber, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Stiffler et al., 2007</ref>) have been used to identify the peptides binding to PRMs. The computational problem under focus in this work is to use the SH3 domain binding peptides identified from phage display experiments to predict SH3 domain mediated PPIs in S. cerevisiae. A straightforward approach is to construct position weight matrices (PWMs) from phage peptides and scan the whole proteome for potential binding sites in target proteins using some threshold score (<ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Obenauer et al., 2003</ref>). The problem with this simple approach is the lack of contextual information, for example, the predicted binding site might not be accessible or it might lie within a structured part of protein (e.g. domain).Proteome is scanned using a PWM built with experimentally derived binding peptides (e.g. from phage display) of a given SH3 domain for potential interactors. (B) Separate Bayesian classifiers for peptide and protein features. (C) Integration of classifiers for predicting interacting and non-interacting protein pairs (Color version of this figure is available at Bioinformatics online.)<ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Tonikian et al. (2009)</ref>addressed this problem by combining in vitro (phage display, peptide array screening) and in vivo (yeast two-hybrid) data to predict SH3 domain mediated PPIs in yeast. Verifying interactions using multiple experimental techniques improves the PPI confidence but it is both time and resource consuming.<ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Lam et al. (2010)</ref>combined comparative and structural genomic features with PWMs to reduce the number of false binding sites. But they did not consider that PPIs are influenced by many cellular constraints including that interacting proteins must be in close proximity and should be part of same process. Peptide-only features are not sufficient for predicting high confidence physiologically relevant PRM mediated PPIs with binding site resolution.<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Jansen et al. (2003</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">), Rhodes et al. (2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">), Li et al. (2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">), Zhang et al. (2012</ref>and others considered multiple types of cellular constraints and combined different evidence sources for PPI prediction, but their approaches are designed for full length proteins and cannot be used to predict PRM mediated PPIs, including identification of binding sites. More recently,<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chen et al. (2015)</ref>combined limited number of peptide and protein features for predicting PRM mediated PPIs in humans. Their protein features are based on one of the earlier the works in the field of ensemble PPI prediction (<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Jansen et al., 2003</ref>). Since then many advances have been made in improving the performance of individual features in PPI prediction (<ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Reimand et al., 2012</ref>). Also, their method is not compatible with high-throughput binding peptide data, such as from phage display. Here, we make use of a larger set of evidence sources to predict SH3-mediated PPIs and their binding sites than has been collected previously and combine peptide level and protein level features in a single predictor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Approach</head><p>PRM mediated PPIs do not occur in isolation in the cell. They are influenced by different sequence-based and cellular constraints. For example, SH3 domains can only bind surface accessible regions, interacting proteins must be present in same cellular compartment, and proteins in the same biological process with correlated gene expression profiles are more likely to interact compared to randomly selected protein pairs. Thus, diverse types of information can be used to help predict physiologically relevant protein interactions. In our method, PWMs constructed using peptides from phage display experiments are used to scan the yeast proteome for potential targets. Peptide features: disorder, surface accessibility, peptide conservation and structural contact are combined using naı¨venaı¨ve Bayesian integration to score the PWM targets. Another naı¨venaı¨ve Bayesian model is used to combine protein features: cellular location, biological process, molecular function, gene expression and sequence signature to score the same targets. Scores from both peptide and protein classifiers are then combined using Bayes theorem to predict physiologically relevant SH3 domain mediated PPIs in yeast.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>shows the work flow of our PRM mediated PPI prediction pipeline.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Position weight matrix and proteome scanning</head><p>Position weight matrices (PWMs) are statistical models for representing sequence motifs. They are real valued m Â n matrices, where m is the number of amino acids and n is the motif length. They are constructed using peptides from phage display experiments and then used to scan a protein sequences to find motif matches above a certain Pvalue threshold (<ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Pizzi et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Wu et al., 2000</ref>). Also, significant positions within the PWMs are identified and used in scoring peptide features: disordered region, surface accessibility and peptide conservation (see supplementary material for details).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Disordered region</head><p>PRMs bind to small peptide stretches containing a specific motif. Specifically interactions between proteins having SH3 domains and their targets are often mediated by proline rich peptide sequences containing PXXP, [R/K]xxPxxP, PxxPx[R/K] motifs. Proline disrupts the secondary structure of a protein by inhibiting the formation of helices and sheets (<ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Morgan and Rubenstein, 2013</ref>). Also, small linear motifs tend to accumulate in disordered regions of protein (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Beltrao and Serrano, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Davey et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Linding et al., 2003</ref>). Beltrao and Serrano showed that the binding sites of SH3 domains in S. cerevisiae often lie within the disordered regions of a protein (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Beltrao and Serrano, 2005</ref>). DISOPRED, a neural network based tool, is used to estimate the probability of the protein region being disordered.</p><formula>DR ¼ X i p i ¼</formula><p>( 1 if amino acid i is disordered</p><formula>0 otherwise N (1)</formula><p>where p i is the disorder score of the i th significant amino acid (either one for disordered or zero for ordered) and N is the number of significant amino acids in the binding site.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Surface accessibility</head><p>Sequences present on a protein's surface are more accessible to binding by SH3 domains than those that are buried inside a protein structure. The degree of solvent-accessible surface area of amino acid residues in a sequence indicates its level of exposure and is measured in terms of relative solvent accessibility (RSA) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adamczak et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Lam et al., 2010</ref>). We use SABLE (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Adamczak et al., 2004</ref>) to predict RSA values for target sequences. It uses a neural network based nonlinear regression model for continuous approximation of RSA values.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3">Peptide conservation</head><p>Biologically relevant peptides binding to yeast SH3 domains are more likely to be conserved in other yeast species (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Beltrao and Serrano, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Davey et al., 2010</ref>). For measuring the conservation, orthologs of S. cerevisiae protein sequences in C. glabrata, D. hansenii, K. lactis, Y. lipolytica, C. albicans, N. crassa and S. pombe (an optimal set as selected by (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Beltrao and Serrano, 2005</ref>)) are identified using INPARANOID (<ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Remm et al., 2001</ref>). The orthologous sequences are then aligned with MAFFT (<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Katoh et al., 2002</ref>) and the unweighted sum-of-pairs method from AL2CO (<ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Pei and Grishin, 2001</ref>) is used to estimate the conservation score of each position in the multiple sequence alignment (<ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Lam et al., 2010</ref>).</p><formula>PC ¼ X i p i N (3)</formula><p>where p i is the conservation score of the i th significant amino acid and N is the number of significant amino acids in the binding site.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.4">Structural contact</head><p>Known 3-D structures of SH3 domains complexed with peptides can be used to assess the binding potential of a query SH3 domain and peptide by reducing residue-residue contacts in 3-D structures to a binary 2-D contact matrix (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chen et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hui and Bader, 2010</ref>). Six yeast SH3-peptide co-complex PDB structures (1N5Z, 1SSH, 1ZUK, 2KYM, 2RQW, 2VKN) are used as base models. The Contact Map Analysis (CMA) tool from the SPACE software suite (<ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Sobolev et al., 2005</ref>) is used to reduce the 3-D structures to 2-D contact maps with residue level contact area for all base models. Query domain and peptide sequences are aligned with all base models using the Needleman–Wunsch algorithm and BLOSUM 62 substitution matrix to calculate the contact distance between aligned residues.</p><formula>SC ¼ max j X i c ij N (4)</formula><p>where c ij is the normalized contact area of the i th aligned domain and peptide residues of the j th base model. Alignment gaps in contact residues will negatively impact the average contact area as only the aligned residues are used for scoring (a gap at a position associated with a large residue contact area will reduce the SC score more than a gap associated with a smaller residue contact area). N is the number of aligned contact residues.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Protein features</head><p>3.3.1 Cellular location, biological process, molecular function Physical PPIs require proteins to be in close proximity to each other i.e. they should co-localize in the same cellular compartment. Also, interacting proteins are more likely to be part of same biological process or have the same function. The Gene Ontology (GO) contains a hierarchy of controlled terms describing cellular location, biological process and molecular function of proteins (<ref type="bibr">The Gene Ontology Consortium, 2000</ref>). The functional relationship between two proteins can be quantified using GO. Semantic similarity can be used to quantify relationships between different GO terms in an ontology. The higher the semantic similarity score between GO terms annotated to two proteins, more likely that they will interact with each other (<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Jain and Bader, 2010</ref>). Topological Clustering Semantic Similarity (TCSS) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Jain and Bader, 2010</ref>) is an accurate semantic similarity measure for PPI prediction. It normalizes the GO hierarchy before computing semantic similarity, according to cutoffs defined in the original TCSS paper.where a and b are the query proteins and C, P, F are the cellular component, biological process and molecular function ontologies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.2">Gene expression</head><p>Gene expression as a measure for assessing the confidence and biological relevance of high-throughput PPIs is based on the notion that the cell is optimized to co-express genes if they function together and if they function together, they are more likely to physically interact than by chance (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bhardwaj and Lu, 2005</ref></p><formula>z ¼ N À1 X N i¼1 1 2 ln 1 þ r i 1 À r i (9)</formula><p>where N is the number of profiles and r i is the Pearson correlation of the i th profile.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.3">Sequence signature</head><p>Sequence signature based PPI prediction methods are based on the notion that protein domains are correlated with specific functions. For instance, it has been shown that functionally related proteins have similar domain composition or they belong to the same 'domain club' (<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Jin et al., 2009</ref>). Information content of co-occurring InterPro (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Apweiler et al., 2001</ref>) signatures extracted from sequences of an experimentally verified set of 22 707 PPIs from DIP (<ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Salwinski et al., 2004</ref>) is used to score novel interactions, as described by<ref type="bibr">Sprinzak</ref>where p ij is the probability of seeing motif i on one protein and motif j on other protein in the experimentally verified PPI set, p i is the probability of seeing motif i and p j is the probability of seeing motif j in the same set.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Bayesian integration</head><p>The objective of a Bayesian PPI prediction model is to estimate the probability that a given protein pair interacts, conditioned on the biological evidence in support of that interaction. A naı¨venaı¨ve Bayesian model simplifies this problem by assuming independence between different types of biological evidence. While modeling the PRM mediated PPI prediction problem a set of observations are made on domain-peptides while others are made on full-length proteins. Assuming that peptide and protein features are independent of each other, two separate naı¨venaı¨ve Bayes models M pep for peptide features and M pro for protein features are built to independently assess the class probability Y. The posterior probabilities PðYjM pep Þ and PðYjM pro Þ are combined using Bayes' theorem (<ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Mitchell, 1997</ref>) (see supplementary material for details).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Model training</head><p>The goal is to construct a generalized model which can predict high confidence, in vivo yeast SH3 domain–peptide physical interactions.</p><p>To achieve this, both peptide and protein classifiers are trained on their respective positive and negative datasets. The peptide classifier is trained on a high confidence set of 628 SH3 domain–peptide interactions in yeast from the MINT database (P1) and an equal number of randomly selected negative interactions (N1). The protein classifier is trained on a high confidence set of 5215 pairwise yeast PPIs from the iRefIndex database (P2) and an equal number of randomly selected negative interactions (N2) (see supplementary material for details).<ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>shows the discriminatory power of individual features for peptide and protein classifiers. Disordered region (DR) and surface accessibility (SA) perform much better in separating positives from negatives as compared to structural contact (SC) and peptide conservation (PC). Prediction efficacy of PC is least among the peptide features. This is due to the difficulty distinguishing positive and negative interactions because both of these sets have high conservation scores caused by the high similarity of protein sequences (and peptides they contain) in general across different yeast species (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig. S2</ref>). Biological process (BP), cellular component (CC) and sequence signature (SS) outperform molecular function (MF) and gene expression (EX) in the protein feature set. Proteins could have the same molecular function but still belong to different processes and this could be one of the reasons behind molecular function feature's weak performance. Gene expression data alone is not as powerful as others in discriminating positives from negatives (<ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kim et al., 2014</ref>), which may be due to its moderate correlation with protein expression (i.e. gene expression may not imply that a functioning protein will be available for interaction) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Vogel and Marcotte, 2012</ref>). Highly correlated features can negatively affect the performance of a naı¨venaı¨ve Bayesian classifier. Maximal information coefficient (MIC) is used to quantify the correlation between different features. DR and SA in the peptide feature set and CC and BP in the protein feature set are correlated with MICs of 0.72 and 0.5 respectively. The effect of correlation on classifier performance is measured by comparing different models without one of the correlated features. Further, to identify the feature subset which maximizes the performance of both classifiers, all possible combinations of features are compared using different statistical measures, such as area under ROC curve (AUROC), area under precision-recall curve (AUPRC), Brier score (BRIER), F 1-score, Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) and accuracy (ACC). Peptide and protein classifiers with all features outperformed other models on at least one of statistical measure (see supplementary material for details).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Model evaluation</head><p>Blind validation protocols are used to assess the predictive power of peptide M pep and protein M pro naı¨venaı¨ve Bayesian classifiers. The majority of interactions in the P1 dataset are from two peptide array experiments (<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Landgraf et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Tonikian et al., 2009</ref>). This could lead to an experimental bias therefore, for blind testing, the peptide classifier is trained using interactions only from peptide array experiments and tested using interactions from all other experiments (no overlap between training and test datasets). Similarly, to make an unbiased assessment, the protein classifier was trained using P2 dataset but tested using the 2304 interactions (with no missing information) from the core subset of Database of Interacting Proteins (DIP) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Salwinski et al., 2004</ref>) that do not overlap the P2 training set and are based on different filtering criteria compared to the MINTinspired score used to select the iRefIndex P2 training set. The DIP core database includes PPIs derived from both small-scale and largescale experiments that have been scored by quality of experimental methods, occurrence of interaction between paralogs (PVM), probable domain–domain interactions between protein pairs (DPV), and comparison with expression profiles (EPR) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Salwinski et al., 2004</ref>). In a real world prediction scenario, both classifiers are expected to encounter cases with missing information. Therefore, the performance of both classifiers is also tested using an unfiltered blind set. The results are summarized in<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>. The AUROC for peptide clasifier is 0.92 and ACC lies within the range<ref type="bibr">[0.86, 0.87]</ref>.

Therefore, these sequences are scanned using the three P1 training set PWMs to identify binding sites and significant amino acid positions within those sites.

These PWMs are then used to predict SH3 domain–peptide interactions using the combined classifier. 534 unique PPIs (1481 binding sites) are predicted as positives for the stringent P-value PWM threshold of 1e-05 with no missing features (Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#tab_3">Table S3</ref>). Approximately 55% (295 PPIs, 1139 binding sites) of these interactions are known at the PPI level (iRefIndex and MINT) and at least 172 (464 binding sites) out of 295 PPIs are known SH3 domain mediated interactions at the peptide level (with ! 60% overlapping binding site). For example, the FUS1p SH3 domain is known to bind the STE5p protein (verified by two-hybrid assay and phage display) via an R(S/T)(S/T)SL motif, supported by two separate studies (<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Kim et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Nelson et al., 2004</ref>). This interaction is part of the predicted set. 143 (203 binding sites) out of 239 (342 binding sites) novel interactions are of high confidence with the combined classifier scores ! 0:9. Biological pathway enrichment (KEGG (<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kanehisa, 2002</ref>) and Reactome (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Croft et al., 2014</ref>)) of the interactors reveal that a number of over-represented processes or pathways are associated with known SH3 domain biology such as endocytosis (<ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Tonikian et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Xin et al., 2013</ref>), MAPK signaling (<ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Lyons et al., 1996</ref>) and Rho GTPase signaling (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bishop and Hall, 2000</ref>) (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Table S4</ref>). For example, some interacting partners of the MYO3 SH3 domain are found to be enriched in PI3K/AKT signaling. AKT is known to regulate actin organization and cell motility during endocytosis (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Enomoto et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Koral et al., 2014</ref>). MYO3 is also implicated in actin organization for the internalization step in endocytosis (<ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Toret and Drubin, 2006</ref>) (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Table S5</ref>). These examples support our results and suggest that our predicted interactions are biologically relevant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>We developed a novel method for predicting physiologically relevant PPIs in yeast. This method combines diverse binding site (peptide) features, including presence in a disordered region of the protein, surface accessibility, conservation across different yeast species, and structural contact with the SH3 domain, as well as protein features such as cellular proximity, shared biological process, similar molecular function, correlated gene expression and sequence signature. Two separate Bayesian models are used to combine peptide and protein features. Their respective posterior probabilities are further combined using Bayes rule for predicting high confidence interactions. The combination of peptide and protein models achieved a higher accuracy of 0.97 compared to individual models on a curated benchmark dataset from<ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Tonikian et al. (2009)</ref>. Disordered region and surface accessibility data from the peptide feature set and biological process, cellular location and sequence signature information from the protein feature set are able to separate positive from negative interactions significantly better than other features. The method presented is generic and modular in nature. Given binding peptide and feature data, we expect it can be used to predict other PRM mediated PPIs in yeast and other organisms. Additional features such as network topology, protein expression and text mining derived protein relationships can be added to our framework. Future development includes testing this method on other PRMs in different organisms, especially human.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig.1.</head><figDesc>Fig. 1.

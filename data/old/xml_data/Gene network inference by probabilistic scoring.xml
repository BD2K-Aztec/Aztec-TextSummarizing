				<p>Motivation: Epistasis analysis is an essential tool of classical genetics for inferring the order of function of genes in a common pathway. Typically, it considers single and double mutant phenotypes and for a pair of genes observes whether a change in the first gene masks the effects of the mutation in the second gene. Despite the recent emergence of biotechnology techniques that can provide gene interaction data on a large, possibly genomic scale, few methods are available for quantitative epistasis analysis and epistasis-based network reconstruction. Results: We here propose a conceptually new probabilistic approach to gene network inference from quantitative interaction data. The approach is founded on epistasis analysis. Its features are joint treatment of the mutant phenotype data with a factorized model and probabil-istic scoring of pairwise gene relationships that are inferred from the latent gene representation. The resulting gene network is assembled from scored pairwise relationships. In an experimental study, we show that the proposed approach can accurately reconstruct several known pathways and that it surpasses the accuracy of current approaches.

Epistasis asserts that two genes interact if the mutation in one gene masks the effects of perturbations in the other gene. Then, assuming a common pathway, the first masking gene would be downstream, and the products of the second gene would regulate the expression of the first one (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Avery and Wasserman, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cordell, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Huang and Sternberg, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Roth et al., 2009</ref>). Epistasis analysis uncovers the relationship between a pair of genes. Its logic can be further extended to uncover parallelism, where both genes have an effect on the phenotype but where there is no epistasis (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Battle et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Zupan et al., 2003</ref>) (<ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>). Uncovered pairwise relationships in a group of genes can give rise to a reconstruction of more complex multi-gene networks. An enlightening demonstration of the power of epistasis for assembly of gene networks is for instance a reconstruction of a four-gene cell death pathway in Caenorhabditis elegans (<ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Metzstein et al., 1998</ref>). Emergent technologies from molecular biology that record phenotypes of single and double mutants at a large, possibly genomic scale, prompt for the development of systematic approaches for epistasis analysis and pose the need to devise computational tools that support gene network inference. Approaches of mutagenesis by homologous recombination (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Collins et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Tong et al., 2004</ref>) or RNA interference can yield phenotype observations for thousands or even millions of mutants (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Costanzo et al., 2010</ref>). Several past studies considered mutant assays with qualitative phenotypes (Zupan *To whom correspondence should be addressed.<ref type="figure">Fig. 1.

The phenotypic difference between a double knockout [e.g. Rðu"v"Þ] and a single knockout mutant [e.g.<ref type="bibr">Rðv"Þ]</ref>is represented with the length of the corresponding dotted edge. Expected double mutant phenotypes, which assume no interaction between genes (see also Section 2.1), are denoted with E [e.g.<ref type="bibr">Eðu"v"Þ]</ref>. A double mutant u"v" (a) has a phenotype similar to that of a single mutant v", which indicates that v is epistatic to u. From the activity of genes v and w (b) we conjecture that gene v partially depends on gene w, i.e. v also acts through a separate pathway because their double mutant v"w" has a phenotype that is equally similar to the single knockout Rðw"Þ and the expected phenotype Eðv"w"Þ. The phenotype of double knockout u"w" (c) is close to the expected phenotype of u"w"; Eðu"w"Þ; which may be explained by u and w acting independently in parallel pathways. Gene ordering from these three relations is preserved in the joint network (d), which is a candidate pathway of genes u, v and w ß The Author 2014. Published by Oxford University Press.

Majority of these studies present gene networks as collections of directly observed pairwise interactions (e.g.<ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Phenix et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">St Onge et al., 2007</ref>) and do not propose a generally applicable formalism to model the data. Only few general-purpose algorithms for inference of epistatic networks have been proposed.<ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Zupan et al. (2003)</ref>introduced formal rules and inference algorithm to infer different types of relationships between genes, but could treat only qualitative phenotypes and could not handle noise. These limitations were elegantly bypassed by a Bayesian approach of Battle et al. (2010) that can handle larger data sets with few hundred genes. This algorithm is to our knowledge also the only modern approach to inference of epistasis networks. Gene epistasis analysis infers interactions that stem directly from mutant phenotypes. Its causative reasoning is different from other network reconstruction tools that observe correlations between gene profiles (e.g.<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ahn et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Mohammadi et al., 2012</ref>) and infer relationships that are circumstantial (<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hughes et al., 2000</ref>). Despite the growing body of quantitative genetic interaction data and our ability to collect such data, computational approaches and tools to support epistasis are at best scarce (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Battle et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Jaimovich and Friedman, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Zhang and Zhao, 2013</ref>). Devising methods for inference of gene pathways from mutant-based phenotypes and developing related software tools remains a major challenge of computational systems biology. We here present a new epistasis analysis-inspired computational approach to infer gene networks from a collection of quantitative mutant phenotypes. We refer to our method as R ed (pronounced as r ed, meaning 'order' in Slovene). Our work was motivated by the Bayesian learning method of<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Battle et al. (2010)</ref>, henceforth denoted by activity pathway network (APN), that starts from a random network and then iteratively refines it to best match data-inferred relationships. The model refinement in APN is carried out through a succession of local structural changes of the evolving network. This procedure may substantially depend on (arbitrary) initialization of network structure, and hence requires ensembling across many runs of the algorithm to raise accuracy of the final network. Our approach is conceptually different from APN. We first simultaneously infer a probabilistic model for the entire set of pairwise relationships. Relationship probabilities serve as preferences for different types of pairwise relationships (e.g. epistasis, parallelism and partial interdependence) used in a single-step construction of a gene network. In contrast to APN's local network changes, R ed applies a global procedure to infer the relationships between genes and does not require ensembling. The probabilistic model of R ed uses matrix completion-derived latent data representation to account for noise and sparsity. Inference of factorized model also includes construction of a gene-specific data transformation to account for the differences in single mutant backgrounds, which may affect the phenotype of double mutants. In an experimental study, we show that both components are necessary for inferring gene networks of high accuracy.</p><formula>(a) (c) (b) (d)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">MATERIALS AND METHODS</head><p>R ed, the proposed gene network reconstruction algorithm (Alg. 1), considers quantitative phenotype measurements over a set of single and double mutants, provides preferential order-of-action scores of possible pairwise relationships and assembles them in a joint gene network. The essential steps of the algorithm are overviewed in<ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>and are described in detail below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Problem definition</head><p>In quantitative analysis of genetic interactions we typically observe pairwise interactions between n genes and measure mutant phenotypes, such as the fitness of an organism or expression of a reporter gene (Reporter). Measurements over a set of double knockout mutants are given in a sparse matrix G 2 R nÂn and those of single knockout mutants in a vector S 2 R n : In these matrices, G u;v quantifies a phenotype of double mutant u"v" and S u denotes a phenotype of single mutant u": The expected mutant phenotypes, which represent phenotypes of double mutants in the absence of genetic interactions, are given by a matrix H. We aim to reconstruct a gene network that is consistent with pairwise gene relationships inferred from G, H and S. Inputs to network reconstruction are preferential scores for all four modeled gene relationships that include epistasis u ! v, epistasis u v, parallelism vjju and partial interdependence vnu (<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>). R ed represents the scores as P=ðP ! ; P ; P jj ; P n Þ and computes them from the latent gene representation, which is obtained in the inference of a factorized model.<ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>. An overview of R ed, a novel approach for automatic gene network inference from mutant data. Inputs to the preferential order-ofaction factorized algorithm of R ed include a matrix of double knockout phenotypes (G), a vector of single knockout phenotypes (S) and a matrix of expected phenotypes corresponding to the assumption of absent interactions between genes (H). R ed estimates a factorized model from G, whose gene latent feature vectors capture the global structure of the phenotype landscape, and learns a parametrized logistic map ), which is a gene-dependent non-linear mapping from latent to phenotype space. A scoring scheme is then applied to the inferred model to estimate the probabilities of pairwise gene relationships of different types. Finally, a multi-gene network is reconstructed, which aims to minimize the number of violating and redundant edges i247</p><p>Gene network inference</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Factorized model</head><p>To deal with noise and address possibly incomplete input data, R ed estimates probabilities of gene relationships through a factorized model. We use a Bayesian inference approach and formulate the conditional probability of observed double mutant phenotype data, given their latent representation, as follows:</p><formula>pðGjU; V; ); 2 G Þ= Y n u=1 Y n v=1 ðN ðG u;v jgðU T u V v ; ) u;v Þ; 2 G ÞÞ I G u;v ;</formula><p>where N ðxj; 2 Þ is a normal distribution with mean and variance 2 , and I G u;v indicates whether the phenotypic measurement of u"v" is available. We assume that the observed phenotype of u"v" is governed by the latent features associated with both genes u and v. To learn the latent features of u and v, we factorize double mutant phenotype data (G) into a product of two low-dimensional latent matrix factors U kÂn and V kÂn. Their column vectors, U u and V v , represent k-dimensional u-specific and v-specific gene latent feature vectors, respectively. Instead of using linear latent Gaussian model of gene interactions, we pass the dot product U T u V v through a parametrized logistic function g. Thus, the model of interaction between genes u and v is represented by the factorized parameter gðU T u V v ; ) u;v Þ. In the factorization, gene interactions depend on each other, as they overlap and share parameters. For instance, given genes u, v and w, their factorized parameters gðU T u V v ; ) u;v Þ and gðU T u V w ; ) u;w Þ share a common gene latent feature vector U u. Parametrized logistic function g is given bythe number of times that U T u V v must grow to reach the value of ð3Þ : If ð2Þ is positive, g is increasing in x, otherwise g is a decreasing function. Note that gðx; 1; 1; 1Þ corresponds to the well-known sigmoid function. For every double mutant u"v", we represent its logistic function parameters in a triple ) u;v =ð) ð1Þ u;v ; ) ð2Þ u;v ; ) ð3Þ u;v Þ and define ) to hold the parametrized logistic function representation over all possible double mutants:</p><p>)=ð) ð1Þ ; ) ð2Þ ; ) ð3Þ Þ.

The measurement noise variance ( 2 G ) and prior variances ( 2 U ; 2 V and 2 ) ) are kept fixed. This is equivalent to minimizing the following objective function (see Supplementary Material for a detailed derivation of a MAP estimator), which is a sum of squared errors with quadratic regularization terms:</p><formula>LðG; U; V; )Þ= 1 2 X n u=1 X n v=1 I G u;v ðG u;v À gðU T u V v ; ) u;v ÞÞ 2 + U 2 X n u=1 U T u U u + V 2 X n v=1 V T v V v + ) 2 X 3 i=1 X n u=1 X n v=1 I G u;v ð) ðiÞ u;v À 1Þ 2 ; ð2Þ where U = 2 G = 2 U ; V = 2 G = 2 V and ) = 2 G = 2 ) .</formula><p>Because ), U and V are unknown, the function L is not convex. In particular, L is convex in either U or V but not in both factors together, which is a known result from matrix factorization studies (<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Koren et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Lee and Seung, 2000</ref>). In our study, L is further coupled by the parametrization of ). Thus, it is unrealistic to expect an algorithm to solve the optimization problem defined by L in the sense of finding global minimum.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Gene-dependent weighting</head><p>We further reduce complexity of the model described in the previous section by combining evidence from multiple phenotypic measurements through their latent representation. We replace entrywise (doublemutant-phenotype-dependent) logistic function parametrization ) with gene-dependent parametrization that is given by ) ðiÞ u;v 1 nÀ1 P w ) ðiÞ u;w for i = 1, 2, 3. This reduces the number of parameters in ) that have to be learned from 3n 2 to 3n. Intuitively, measurements that involve gene u are not independent from each other but are rather governed by the gene pathways in which u participates. Gene-dependent parametrization of ) represents a method of regularization allowing us to remove penalty terms in Equations (5)–(7). Derivatives of ) use only available phenotypic measurements owing to the application of an indicator function<ref type="bibr">[</ref></p><formula>^ G u;v =gðU T u V v ; ) u;v Þ;</formula><p>where U and V are latent matrix factors from the previous iteration of gradient descent (Step 3c in Alg. 1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Preferential order-of-action scoring of gene pairs</head><p>Probabilities of gene–gene relationships in P are computed from the inferred phenotypes given by ^ G=gðU T V; )Þ, with the rules outlined in<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>. Estimated probabilities in P approach 1 when inferred phenotypic values in ^ G are close to the phenotypes, which would be expected if a certain network structure (!; ; jj; n) existed between genes, and they slowly vanish when the inferred values deviate from the values expected by a certain type of relationship. For instance, an epistatic genetic interaction u v is inferred when the trait ^ G u;v of the double mutant u"v" is similar to the single mutant u" phenotype S u and the two single mutant phenotypes are different (S u 6 % S v ). This brings j ^ G u;v À S u j close to 0 and, consequently, P u;v close to 1. With different single mutant phenotypes, the expected phenotype H u;v of the double mutant that assumes no genetic interaction is different from both single mutant phenotypes (S u 6 % S v ) S v 6 % H u;v ^ S u 6 % H u;v ), bringing P jj u;v and P n u;v close to 0. Likewise, the phenotype of v" would be different from the phenotype of the double mutant, bringing P ! u;v close to 0. Cases with less pronounced differences between phenotypes would lead to smaller differences in relationship probabilities. Preferential order-ofaction scores generalize the epistasis analysis framework by Avery and<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Wasserman (1992)</ref>, wherein the signal and the genes under study were strictly on or off with no intermediate levels of activity. An appealing feature of scores in P is that they have a direct probabilistic interpretation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Multi-gene network inference</head><p>Given probabilistic scores of gene–gene network structures in P from Section 2.4, we reconstruct a detailed multi-gene network that is consistent with the inferred relationship probabilities and contains a minimum number of violating and redundant edges. Examples of inferred networks are given in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figures 4</ref>–7. A network is a weighted directed graph with genes as vertices and directed edges that determine the order of action. A designated vertex represents the observed quantitative trait. A directed edge from u to v is violating (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 3a</ref>) if there is evidence in P for both u ! v and u v (e.g. P ! u;v % P u;v ). A directed edge from u to v is redundant (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 3b</ref>) if there is evidence in P that some intermediate gene exists between u and v. That is, u and v are not adjacent in a genetic network but rather u indirectly affects v, i.e. P ! u;v captures the extent to which strict weak ordering of u and v holds. Network inference procedure assigns a level to every gene in a manner that if there is strong evidence in P that gene u is placed upstream of gene v, that is, if v is epistatic to u, then levelðuÞ4levelðvÞ: In the case of stronger evidence of parallelism or partial interdependence between u and v the levelðuÞ % levelðvÞ: Several genes can be assigned the same level, but a designated vertex corresponding to a phenotype of interest is the only vertex placed on the lowest level. Inference of a genetic network involves two phases. In the first phase we perform an approximate topological sort through construction of a directed weighted graph. Given genes u and v and the inferred epistasis relationships between them, the direction and weight of a between-level edge are determined by the maximum of the values P ! u;v (edge u ! v) and P u;v (edge u v). Given a parallelism or partial interdependence relationship between u and v, a within-level edge is determined by the maximum of the values P jj u;v (no edge between u and v) and P n u;v (edge u ! v). This graph may contain directed cycles, and finding an exact topological ordering of its vertices with the minimal set of violating edges is a known NP-hard problem (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Charbit et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Eades et al., 1993</ref>). Thus, we proceed in the following way. We select a vertex with no incoming between<ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. 3</ref>. Illustration of violating (a) and redundant (b) edges (in gray) in a pathway with four genes. Edge y 1 ! v 1 is violating because there is evidence that v 1 is placed upstream of y 1 (v 1 ! w 1 and w 1 ! y 1 ) but also that y 1 is upstream of v 1 (y 1 ! v 1 ). Edge u 2 ! w 2 is redundant because there is evidence of an intermediate gene v 2 : Similarly, edge u 2 ! y 2 is redundant because of two intervening genes, v 2 and w 2 i249</p><formula>(a) ( b)</formula><p>Gene network inference level edges, assign that vertex to the currently top-most level and recurse on the graph with that vertex removed. We also look for vertices with no outgoing between-level edges and assign them to the currently lowest level. If in some step multiple vertices have no incoming or outgoing between-level edges, they are assigned the same level. It can happen that all vertices have incoming and outgoing between-level edges. In this case, we select the vertex with the highest differential between weighted incoming between-level degree and weighted outgoing between-level degree.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Mutant phenotype data</head><p>Jonikas et al. (2009) measured unfolded protein response (UPR) levels in single and double mutants to systematically characterize functional interdependence of yeast genes with roles in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) folding. The dataset contains 444 genes that caused high UPR reporter inductions. The interaction data include phenotypes of 42 240 distinct double mutants (matrix G) corresponding to 43% of all possible double mutants. Jonikas et al. also computed typical (i.e. expected) values of genetic interactions for every double mutant (matrix H). They considered multiplicative neutrality function (<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Mani et al., 2008</ref>) and computed it using reporter levels of pairs of single mutants, modified by a Hill function to account for the saturation of the reporter signal.<ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Surma et al. (2013)</ref>considered 741 genes and observed the growth phenotype (colony size) for all pairs of double mutants. In total, after filtering out unreliable measurements, their dataset comprises 251 383 double mutant fitness scores. We computed single mutant scores by averaging across all scores of double mutants that included mutations of the corresponding genes. We considered multiplicative model to calculate the expected fitness of a double mutant in the absence of a genetic interaction.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>M. Zitnik and B.Zupan</head><p>prediction of gene interaction scores with the following experiments: 1.<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Battle et al. (2010)</ref>provided 168 test gene pairs (v, u) from common KEGG pathways (<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Kanehisa et al., 2008</ref>). For 21 gene pairs v is known to be upstream of u, and for 147 gene pairs v is not known to be upstream of u. Given a gene pair, R ed predicted the probability of epistasis as</p><formula>P ! u;v =ðP ! u;v +P u;v Þ</formula><p>, and the accuracy of predictions on entire set of 168 gene pairs. 2. Using the setup from Battle et al. we evaluate the accuracy of prediction of direct edges u ! v in the N-linked glycosylation pathway (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 4</ref>) based on the model-estimated probability of epistasis P ! u;v. 3. We estimate the accuracy when predicting that two genes are in epistasis, that is, u ! v or v ! u. Note that in the literature this relationship is also referred to as an alleviating interaction, where the phenotype of a double mutant is less severe than expected from the phenotypes of the corresponding single mutants (<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Jonikas et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Mani et al., 2008</ref>). For the data from Jonikas et al. this means that the double-mutant cell responds to ER stress surprisingly better than how the ER stress would typically be mitigated. The data for this experiment were preprocessed according to the procedure described by Battle et al. A positive set included gene pairs (u, v) with significant alleviating genetic interactions, for which the observed phenotype (interaction score) was negative with a magnitude greater than jG u;v À max ðS u ; S v ÞÞj (see St<ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Onge et al., 2007</ref>). It was further required that the double-mutant phenotype data contained a sufficient number of observations that included u" or v", such that the geometric mean of such measurements for u and for v was at least 180. There are 2723 gene pairs in the data of Jonikas et al. that match these criteria. In each test run, we form a test set with a random selection of 5% of the positive gene pairs and a negative set of equal size of gene pairs that fail to satisfy the selection criteria. We remove the test data from the interaction score matrix G, and predict whether a test gene pair is alleviating using the probability that u and v occur together in a linear pathway, i.e. P ! u;v +P u;v. We report an averaged accuracy across 10 different test runs. We characterize the accuracy of predictions through the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC), with a baseline of 0.5 (random networks) and a perfect score of 1.0 (inferred networks that are identical to gold standard—known networks). We compare R ed, our network inference approach, with a recently published Bayesian approach by Battle et al. They developed preference scoring functions over all possible pairwise gene relationships and applied annealed importance sampling to reconstruct high scoring multi-gene networks. Their method (referred here as APN) was shown to be superior to a number of other approaches that can infer networks from gene interaction data by Jonikas et al. These other approaches include baseline techniques such as Pearson correlation of genetic interaction profiles and raw interaction values as well as more sophisticated techniques such as Gaussian process regression (GP;<ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Williams and Rasmussen, 1996</ref>), a method that uses the correlation of observed interaction profiles, the diffusion kernel method (DK;<ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Qi et al., 2008</ref>) and GenePath (<ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Zupan et al., 2003</ref>). For brevity, we therefore focus on comparing our method with APN, which was run with default parameters as chosen by Battle et al. for the dataset of Jonikas et al., but we also report the accuracies achieved by GP and DK. Two essential components of R ed are latent representation of gene interactions and their transformation through the logistic function. To test the extent to which the performance of R ed depends on these two components we also run experiments where the algorithm infers probabilities and makes predictions from raw (not factorized) phenotypes, and where the latent representation is used without logistic transformation. We refer to these two approaches as RAW and MF, respectively. In all experiments with data from Jonikas et al., the parameters of R ed are set as U = V =1 Â 10 À4 ; =0:1; =0:1; k=100. The same parameters are used on data from Surma et al. with the exception of =1 Â 10 À3 and k = 50, which were selected to minimize the normalized root mean square error of ^ G. This choice of regularization parameters and learning rates is common (cf.<ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Min and Lee, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Pedregosa et al., 2011</ref>). We also show (see Supplementary Material; Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig.  S4</ref>) that the performance of R ed does not critically depend on the rank of factorization k. R ed's optimization by gradient descent is terminated when the Frobenius distance between G and ^ G over known values fails to decrease between the two consecutive iterations of optimization.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Reconstruction</head><p>of a known gene pathway from data by<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Jonikas et al. (2009)</ref>We analyzed the ability of R ed to reconstruct the known N-linked glycosylation pathway.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4</ref>shows the inferred network next to the known pathway as reported by Helenius andAebi (2004). Genes CWH41, DIE2 and ALG8 are correctly placed such that they are dependent on the other genes. Also, ALG12 is placed upstream of ALG9, which is also upstream of ALG3. OST3 is correctly placed downstream, but OST5 is incorrectly placed, likely because double-mutant data with the other ALG genes were not available. Surprisingly, R ed correctly placed CWH41, a gene that encodes glucosidase I, an integral membrane protein of the ER involved in sensing ER stress (<ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Romero et al., 1997</ref>), at the beginning of the pathway despite mild downstream effects observed in CWH41 mutants. Note that the interaction profile of CWH41 is only moderately correlated with those of ALG genes, and thus, CWH41 was not clustered together with them (<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Jonikas et al., 2009</ref>). We hence conclude that R ed inference of the N-linked glycans synthesis pathway was successful with a network that closely resembles that reported in the literature.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Reconstruction of known gene pathways from data by Surma et al. (2013)</head><p>We applied R ed to mutant data by Surma et al. to reconstruct two thoroughly studied pathways of phospholipid biosynthesis. R ed's ordering of genes in the phosphatidylserine to PC conversion pathway is fully consistent with the reference pathway (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 5a</ref>). In the Kennedy pathway, R ed correctly placed PCT1 upstream of CPT1 and CKI1 upstream of CPT1 with high confidence (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 5b</ref>), but it misplaced gene pair PCT1 and CKI1 likely owing to the ambiguity in the data. However, as R ed performs global reasoning by combining evidence from all measurements, it handled the data uncertainty by assigning PCT1 ! CKI1 structure the lowest score in the reconstruction of the Kennedy pathway.<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Jonikas et al. (2009)</ref>identified several pathways that are important for ER protein folding. Of these, the pathways for ERAD and TA protein insertion were considered in<ref type="bibr">Battle</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2008</ref>). The ordering of inferred networks is entirely consistent with the partially known gene pathways. For instance, in the network for the ERAD pathway (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 6</ref>), the upstream placement of MNL1 to YOS9 is consistent with existing data showing that MNL1 generates the sugar species recognized by YOS9 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Clerc et al., 2009</ref>). Also, MNL1, YOS9, DER1 and USA1 are placed upstream of HRD3 and HRD1, which is compatible with data showing that degradation of certain substrates requires all six components (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Carvalho et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Kim et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Nakatsukasa and Brodsky, 2008</ref>). For the TA protein insertion pathway, R ed inferred a network (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 7</ref>) that placed the poorly characterized protein SGT2 upstream of the TA protein biogenesis machinery components according to its function in the insertion of TA proteins into membranes (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Battle et al., 2010</ref>). Similarly, positive results of network inference are also reported in (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Battle et al., 2010</ref>). Their method inferred a numberof candidate networks of which the best-scored were shown to be partially consistent with known gene interdependencies. In contrast, for each pathway, R ed inferred a single network that is entirely consistent with known gene relationships.<ref type="figure" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>reports the accuracies of gene ordering prediction obtained by four different algorithms, R ed, APN and two simplified variants of R ed. In comparison with APN, R ed performs substantially better in predicting the edges of the KEGG pathways and slightly better in predicting the edges of the N-linked glycosylation pathway (Supplementary Figs S1 and S2). The poor performance of the simplified variants of R ed (RAW and MF) indicates that R ed's latent representation inferred from the factorized model, the non-linear logistic map and genedependent weighting are the essential components of R ed. Without any of these, R ed would not be able to achieve the resulting accuracy.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Prediction of alleviating genetic interactions</head><p>Given the training and separate test datasets, we predict whether an interaction is alleviating (see Section 3.3).<ref type="figure" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>shows that R ed performs substantially better than APN (P50.001). R ed also outperforms standard two-factor matrix factorization (MF) by a large margin, which is an indicator that transformation via a logistic map is essential to the performance of our algorithm. We compare these results with those obtained by GP (<ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Williams and Rasmussen, 1996</ref>) using squared exponential autocorrelation model constructed from the genetic interaction profiles, and with the interactions predicted with the DK (<ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Qi et al., 2008</ref>). R ed achieves significantly higher accuracy than GP (P50.01) and DK (P50.001), although the difference with GP is small and may be worthy of further study. Note that RAW, a R ed variant without factorization, is not applicable for this experiment, as it does not generalize across gene interaction scores. We have observed that the probabilities of alleviating gene pairs predicted by R ed are well correlated to the strength of alleviating interactions (Spearman r= À 0:704; P 51 Â 10 À100 ; Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Fig. S3</ref>). R ed scores gene pairs with stronger alleviating effects (negative interaction values with greater magnitude) higher than those that interact moderately.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">CONCLUSION</head><p>R ed is a conceptually new approach for inference of gene networks from quantitative genetic interaction data. It implements a probabilistic epistasis analysis and assembles pairwise relationships into gene networks. In our experiments, R ed was able to reconstruct several known and partially known pathways with accuracy above that of the state-of-the-art approaches. R ed outperforms APN, the state-of-the-art method by<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Battle et al. (2010)</ref>, both in accuracy and speed, with CPU runtime of only a few minutes compared with APN's 30 min for an inference of a single full network in an ensemble of 500 networks. We also show that R ed's power of generalization comes from its two key components, a factorized model with latent representation of gene interactions and a gene-dependent logistic map of interaction scores. Our evaluation in this article was computational and thus limited to datasets for which several gene pathways or at least partial gene orderings were available (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Battle et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Jonikas et al., 2009</ref>). R ed can efficiently handle similar datasets as well as much larger ones, such as that from the recent yeast experiments by<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Costanzo et al. (2010)</ref>. These are also the datasets for which we foresee future applications of R ed and which will require subsequent verification of inferred networks in the wet lab.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><figDesc>cf.

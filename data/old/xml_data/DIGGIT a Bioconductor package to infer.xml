<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Identification of somatic mutations and germline variants associated to cancer and other complex diseases (driver mutations) is mostly performed on a statistical basis (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Lawrence et al., 2013</ref>). Achieving appropriate statistical power, however, requires large effect sizes or large cohorts to control for errors arising from the large number of tested hypothesis (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Califano et al., 2012</ref>). In addition, since statistical approaches do not provide mechanistic insight, many disease risk determinants, such as apolipoprotein E, were discovered long before they were mechanistically elucidated (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Liu et al., 2013</ref>). We have recently developed an approach that boosts the statistical power of GWAS by focusing the analysis to genes mechanistically linked to a specific phenotype or cell state, termed master regulators (MR,<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aytes et al., 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">, Carro et al., 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">, Lefebvre et al., 2010</ref>). Driver-gene Inference by Genetical-Genomic Information Theory (DIGGIT) searches for genetic alterations associated with dysregulation of MR protein activity, reducing the number of hypothesis to test, while providing regulatory clues to help elucidate associated biological mechanisms (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chen et al., 2014</ref>). We have recently used DIGGIT to identify causal genetic determinants of the mesenchymal subtype of human glioblastoma (GBM,<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chen et al., 2014</ref>). Here, we present the R-system implementation of DIGGIT, which is available as a software package from Bioconductor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Approach</head><p>DIGGIT evaluates candidate alterations within a set of functional disease drivers and their upstream regulators (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chen et al., 2014</ref>). This is accomplished by a five-step process, requiring gene expression, matched genetic-variant profiles, specifically copy number variation data (CNV), and context-specific transcriptional (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Basso et al., 2005</ref>) and post-translational (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Wang et al., 2009</ref>) regulatory models. The first step reduces the number of candidate genetic alterations, by selecting those whose ploidy is informative of gene expression as candidate functional CNVs (F-CNVs). This is assessed based on mutual information (MI) between copy number and expression. During the second step, the MRs for a specific phenotypic transition are inferred. The third step reduces the list of candidate genetic alterations by considering only the loci coding for MRs and their upstream post-translational modulators, as inferred by the MINDy algorithm. During the forth step, the statistical association between the functional genetic alterations, steps 2 and 3, and the activity of the MRs is inferred by MI analysis (activity Quantitative Trait Loci, aQTL). Finally, a conditional association analysis is performed to determine which, among multiple genes affected by the same amplified or deleted regions, are the most probable drivers of MR dysregulation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Implementation</head><p>DIGGIT is implemented as an R-system package and it is available from Bioconductor. Input data and results are encapsulated in an S4 object of class diggit, requiring an expression dataset, CNV data, and an appropriate tissue lineage-matched regulatory network (interactome). Two alternative methods were implemented to compute the F-CNVs: MI and correlation analysis (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 1A</ref>). MI is estimated using 1-and 2-dimensional Gaussian kernels with optimal bandwidth selection though a plug-in (hpi) approach, as implemented in the ks package (available from CRAN: http://cran.r-project.org). Finally, the statistical significance for the association is estimated by permutation analysis. MR analysis is then performed with the msviper function implemented in the viper package (Bioconductor). Before aQTL analysis, the relative activity of the MRs for each individual sample is computed with the viper algorithm (viper package, Bioconductor). This step is critical, because MRs are usually dysregulated at the protein level, while rarely differentially expressed (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Aytes et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Carro et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Lefebvre et al., 2010</ref>). Activity quantitative trail loci are then inferred by computing the statistical association between F-CNV and VIPER-inferred MR protein activity by MI or correlation analysis. Finally, the conditional association analysis is performed by estimating the statistical association between samples harboring F-CNVs in a gene 'a' and the phenotype groups, after conditioning for the presence of CNVs in other genes 'g', one at a time, by Fisher's exact test. Results for this analysis can be displayed as heatmaps (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 1B</ref>). Selection of candidate genes for experimental validation and biochemical characterization can be performed based on the aQTL analysis p-values, either before or after correction by conditional association analysis.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Discussion</head><p>Elucidating the causal genetic determinants of most complex diseases has proven more challenging than expected. Due to the large number of candidate loci, it is difficult to achieve enough statistical power to detect all but the most highly penetrant and frequent events. Furthermore, classic GWAS approaches are based on pure statistical associations, providing no mechanistic insights. DIGGIT aims to address both challenges by relying on context-specific models of cell regulation. It boosts the statistical power by focusing on the regulators mechanistically linked to the phenotype and on their upstream post-translational modulators (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chen et al., 2014</ref>). The algorithm relies on large (n &gt; 100 samples) expression and genetic profiles and requires cell context-specific models of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation.

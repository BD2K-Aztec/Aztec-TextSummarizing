				<p>Motivation: Cryo-electron tomography allows the imaging of macro-molecular complexes in near living conditions. To enhance the nominal resolution of a structure it is necessary to align and average individual subtomograms each containing identical complexes. However, if the sample of complexes is heterogeneous, it is necessary to first classify subtomograms into groups of identical complexes. This task becomes challenging when tomograms contain mixtures of unknown complexes extracted from a crowded environment. Two main challenges must be overcomed: First, classification of subtomograms must be performed without knowledge of template structures. However, most alignment methods are too slow to perform reference-free classification of a large number of (e.g. tens of thousands) of subtomo-grams. Second, subtomograms extracted from crowded cellular environments, contain often fragments of other structures besides the target complex. However, alignment methods generally assume that each subtomogram only contains one complex. Automatic methods are needed to identify the target complexes in a subtomogram even when its shape is unknown. Results: In this article, we propose an automatic and systematic method for the isolation and masking of target complexes in subto-mograms extracted from crowded environments. Moreover, we also propose a fast alignment method using fast rotational matching in real space. Our experiments show that, compared with our previously proposed fast alignment method in reciprocal space, our new method significantly improves the alignment accuracy for highly distorted and especially crowded subtomograms. Such improvements are important for achieving successful and unbiased high-throughput reference-free structural classification of complexes inside whole-cell tomograms.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Cryo-electron tomography enables the 3D imaging of macromolecular complexes at nanometer-scale resolution in near native conditions (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Best et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Lucic et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Medalia et al., 2002</ref>). Tomograms of individual cells are essentially 3D representations of the entire proteome providing a snapshot of the distributions of protein complexes (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Beck et al., 2011</ref>). However, comprehensive detection of individual complexes in cell tomograms is challenging because of the inherent low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), missing data, nonisotropic resolution and the fact that individual macromolecules are difficult to recognize in a highly crowded environment (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Beck et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Best et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bo¨hmBo¨hm et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Frangakis et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Medalia et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Nickell et al., 2006</ref>). Most methods for detecting complexes in cell tomograms rely on a template structure, which serves as a reference in searching for a similar pattern in the tomogram (e.g.<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Beck et al., 2009</ref>). However, for an unbiased detection and classification of all the different complexes in a cellular tomogram, template-free methods are needed (<ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Xu et al., 2011</ref>). Such an analysis is challenging and relies on three main steps: First, the locations of potential complexes are detected by using particle-picking methods and a subregion surrounding the potential complex is extracted (i.e. the subtomogram). Second, the subtomogram regions corresponding only to the target complex must be detected, which allows masking out all background regions, which in turn contain noise and in case of crowded subtomograms also fragments of surrounding structures. Third, reference-free structural classification of the masked subtomograms is performed, which is typically based on an iterative process of subtomogram alignments, classifications and averaging (e.g.<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Amat et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bartesaghi et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Chen et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fö rster et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Volkmann, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Xu et al., 2012</ref>). Finally, the averaging of aligned subtomograms of the same complexes will enhance the nominal resolution of the resulting density maps. In this article, we address two main challenges in reference-free subtomogram classifications. First, we propose an automatic method for adaptive masking of target regions in crowded subtomograms without the knowledge of the shape of the complex. Such a method is particularly important for subtomograms extracted from crowded environments, such as the cell cytoplasm. In such a case, subtomograms will also contain fragmental regions of other complexes owing to the high particle density in the tomogram. Masking out these regions is of great importance in the subsequent classification process. Unlike automatic masking methods based on voxel weighting (<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Xu et al., 2012</ref>) or dimension reduction methods such as Principle Component Analysis (<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Heumann et al., 2011</ref>), our method is highly scalable because it is independent of the classification process and does not involve iterative processing of a large number of subtomograms. Second, we propose a new method for fast rotational matching of subtomograms in real space. The 3D subtomogram alignment is computationally the most intensive step in the classification process. Currently, most alignment methods are based on maximizing the overlap similarity of two subtomograms through exhaustive search over all rigid transforms (rotation and *To whom correspondence should be addressed. ß The Author 2013.

Such methods scan exhaustively through each rotational angle, and find the best corresponding translation using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) (e.g.<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Amat et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Fo¨rsterFo¨rster et al., 2008</ref>). These methods are computationally intensive, which limits their applicability in reference-free classifications. To increase alignment accuracy, local search methods have been developed to refine initial alignments (e.g.<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bartesaghi et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Hrabe et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Xu and Alber, 2012</ref>). To increase computational efficiencies, two approximate alignment methods have been developed, which separate the translational from the rotational subtomogram alignments (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bartesaghi et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Xu et al., 2012</ref>). These methods are based on similarity scores defined in the reciprocal space (i.e. Fourier space). To separate translational and rotational search, these methods use an approximate score that introduces translational invariance by eliminating the phase information of the complex coefficients in the reciprocal space and use only the magnitude of the Fourier coefficients (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bartesaghi et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Xu et al., 2012</ref>). By expressing the structural information in Spherical Harmonics (SH) Expansion, it is possible to formulate the rotational alignment as a fast rotational matching, which simultaneously calculates alignment scores of all rotations using FFT. This procedure significantly increases the alignment speed. For example, our previously published method (<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Xu et al., 2012</ref>) achieved between hundreds to thousands fold speedup (depending on subtomograms size and rotational angle interval) compared with the standard scanning-based alignment method (Fo¨rster<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Fo¨rster et al., 2008</ref>) by using a translational invariance approximation of a similarity score equivalent to a popular score proposed by (Fo¨rster<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Fo¨rster et al., 2008</ref>). However, formulating the fast rotational matching in reciprocal space has some limitations. In reciprocal space, the majority of informative signals of a complex is usually contained in a relatively small amount of high magnitude Fourier coefficients (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Amat et al., 2010</ref>). These coefficients are often occupying relatively few voxels in the reciprocal space located within a small region centered at the origin. Therefore, the SH expansion in the fast rotational matching may be hampered by interpolation errors, which reduces the accuracy in the alignment process. In contrast, in real space, the signal covers a wider area within a subtomogram, and the SH expansion is expected to be more accurate. It is therefore beneficial to formulate fast rotational matching in real space. In addition, real space fast rotational matching uses the full constrained alignment score instead of a translation invariant approximation when the method is expressed in reciprocal space (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bartesaghi et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Xu et al., 2012</ref>). Here, we devise an improved alignment method, which formulates the fast rotational matching of subtomograms in real space. To achieve this goal, we first identify a keypoint in the target complex whose relative location is invariant to rigid transformations and serves as the center of rotation in the fast rotational matching of the two subtomograms. A natural choice is the center of mass of a complex. However, detection of the center of mass is not trivial and cannot be approximated by the geometrical or mass density center of the subtomogram. The reason for this complication is that tomograms are images of the crowded cellular environment (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Beck et al., 2009</ref>), and a subtomogram contains not necessarily mass density of only one single complex. When a potential complex is detected and its subtomogram extracted as a rectangular cube then this subtomogram typically contains also fragments of other surrounding structures that occupy parts of the subtomogram. Then, the center of mass estimation and subtomogram alignment are affected by the existence of the additional mass density in the subtomogram. It is necessary to focus only on the regions that contain the actual target complex. Even when a subtomogram does not contain any surrounding structures, its mean intensity is often close to background intensity owing to the suppression of low frequency signal owing to the Contrast Transfer Function (CTF) effect, which also makes the estimation of the center of mass of the complex inaccurate. Applying our automatic target complex segmentation method, it is possible to estimate a center of mass based only on the target complex regions in the subtomogram (i.e. the constrained center of mass). Once the constrained center of mass is detected, we design a fast subtomogram alignment method that uses real space signals and takes into account missing wedge corrections using reciprocal space signals. Moreover, the alignment focuses exclusively on the target complex regions in each subtomogram, which significantly decreases the influence of background noise and surrounding structures to the alignment process. Our experiments show that our new approach significantly increases the alignment accuracy compared with our previous proposed fast alignment method (<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Xu et al., 2012</ref>) for highly distorted subtomograms. Most importantly, the new method is highly robust to the influence of surrounding structures inside crowded subtomograms.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Automatic segmentation of the target complex in a subtomogram</head><p>The automatic target complex segmentation method consists of several steps (Figs 1, 2 and 7):</p><p>(i) automatic scale selection is performed to maximally enhance the detection of structural boundaries in a subtomogram;(ii) segments are defined that describe the boundaries between structural elements; and (iii) a classification of the detected structural segments into candidate regions is performed by using a statistical model based clustering.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1">Automatic</head><p>scale selection for optimal smoothing and boundary enhancement In this article, we assume that in a subtomogram high image intensity corresponds to high electron density. When a subtomogram is renormalized so that its mean intensity is zero, the boundary of a complex tends to have a negative intensity surface (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 3</ref>, yellow arrow). This property is due to the CTF effects in the electron tomography imaging process, which suppresses low frequency signals. We use this negative intensity surface as a main characteristic when identifying the segments at the boundary of structural elements, such as the target complex and those structures captured at the outer regions of the subtomogram. To reduce the influence of noise, smoothing of the subtmograms is needed. However, too much smoothing will weaken the negative intensity boundary. To find the optimal degree of smoothing, we use the scale-space representation method and propose an automatic scale selection method to find the optimal degree of smoothing that maximally enhances the boundary surface while minimizing the noise. Scale-space (<ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Witkin, 1983</ref>) is a framework for multi-scale signal representation. An image is represented as a one-parameter family of smoothed images, the scale-space representation, parameterized by the size of the Gaussian smoothing kernel (<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Lindeberg, 1994</ref>):</p><formula>g ðxÞ :¼ 1 ð2 2 Þ 3 2 e Àx &gt; x 2 2</formula><p>Given a subtomogram, f, a Gaussian smoothing can be expressed as the convolution between f and g :</p><formula>~ f :¼ f Ã g</formula><p>In the smoothed subtomogram ~ f , all features with a size smaller than are filtered out, whereas others are preserved. Our objective is to determine the optimal scale to enhance the formation of a negative intensity surface while minimizing the influence of noise. To do so, we scan a range of feasible values. For a given smoothed subtomogram with scale , we find all local minima with negative intensities in ~ f and denote this set as S min. We then define a local surface score for each minima in S min , to identify those minima that are likely part of a negative intensity surface. The surface score is calculated as follows: we calculate the Hessian matrix HðxÞ, whose elements are second-order derivatives of ~ f evaluated at</p><formula>x 2 R 3 , H ij ðx k Þ ¼ @ 2 ~ f ðxÞ @xi@xj x¼xk , 8k 2 S min , i, j ¼ 1, 2, 3</formula><p>where x k is the corresponding location of a voxel k. For any k 2 S min , let 1 , 2 , 3 be the ordered eigenvalues of Hðx k Þ such that j 1 j ! j 2 j ! j 3 j. Then, we can construct a local surface score s ~ f ðx k Þ similar to (Martinez<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Sanchez et al., 2011</ref>) as follows:</p><formula>s ~ f ðx k Þ ¼ j 1 j À ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi j 2 3 j p if 1 40, 0 i f 1 50:</formula><p>We find the value that maximally enhances the surface scores of all the minima so that the most negative minima tends to have a strong surface score. To do so, we calculate an accumulative surface score from all the minima. First, the minima are ordered in ascending order in ~ f such thatFor simplicity, in the following sections, we denote ~ f :¼ ~ f Ã (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figs 2C</ref>and 7B) and also denote ~ f i :¼ ~ fðx i Þ for any voxel i. 2.1.2 Detecting structural, boundary and background segments in the subtomogram After identifying the optimal scale Ã , we now determine those local minima that have strong surface scores and are likely to separate different structural elements (i.e. the target complex and surrounding structures). We define them as those local minima with both high surface scores and low intensity values. To do so, first we select the minima whose intensity is significantly smaller than the average intensity, i.e.The boundary feature is a surface that has strong negative intensity (yellow arrow). A local maxima in S max structural boundary is highlighted by a red cross, which is inside the macromolecular complex. Its corresponding structural boundary segment is highlighted by a red circle. A local maxima in S max background boundary is highlighted by a green cross, which is inside a background region. Its corresponding background boundary segment is highlighted by green circle. See Section 2.1.2 for the details of these two types of local maxima i276 where c min intensity factor is a constant parameter to control the significance level, and mad is the Median Absolute Deviation, which is a robust measure of variability. In addition, we also collect those minima whose surface score is significantly larger than the average scores of all minima, i.e.where c min surface factor is a constant parameter. All minima with strong surface scores are defined as the intersection of both groups. S min boundary :¼ S min intensity \ S min surface</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>S</head><p>We denote these minima as the boundary surface minima. We then determine all local intensity maxima S max in ~ f, which are likely to be inside structural elements. We first perform Watershed segmentation (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Beucher and Lantue´joulLantue´joul, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Volkmann, 2002</ref>) using S max as seeds (Figs 2D and 7C). Each segment corresponds to one local maximum, and therefore the terms local maximum and segment are used interchangeably. We then select all the segments that border with local minima defined in S min boundary and denote the corresponding set of maxima as S max boundary. The actual separations between structural elements and background regions are always at the boundary between segments in S max boundary. The segments in S max boundary can be divided into two types: a structural boundary segment is located in the target complex or the surrounding structures (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 3</ref>, inside red circle), and it contains a maximum with high intensity value (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 3</ref>, highlighted by red cross); a background boundary segment is located in the regions that do not contain structural elements (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 3</ref>, inside green circle), and which contain a maximum with low intensity value (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 3</ref>, highlighted by green cross). To separate these two types of boundary segments, we perform k-means clustering on S max boundary (with cluster number ¼ 2), resulting in the two groups S max structural boundary and S max background boundary. S max structural boundary are segments containing local maxima with higher intensity values and are defined as structural boundary segments (Figs 2E and 7D), whereas S max background boundary are defined as background boundary segments. After focusing on boundary segments (i.e. those that border with surface minima), we now characterize the remaining segments as either part of structural elements or background regions. To do this, we first determine a cutoff intensity value c maxima cutoff as the largest intensity value in all the background boundary segments S max background boundary. All remaining segments that contain a local maxima with an intensity value smaller that c maxima cutoff are assigned as background regions. Finally, the remaining segments whose maxima have intensity values larger than c maxima cutoff are defined as structural segments and are therefore assumed to be either part of the target complex or other structural elements, i.e. S max structural :¼ fk 2 S max : ~ f i 4c maxima cutoff g.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.3">Combining structural segments</head><p>into complexes using model based clustering We now cluster structural segments in S max structural according to the intensity values and location of their local maxima so that each cluster of segments will approximately correspond to one consecutive structural region. We choose a model-based clustering approach because it allows an automatic determination of the optimal set of clusters. To perform the clustering, we assume that the location and intensity of local maxima from clusters follows a probabilistic mixture model, where each component probability distribution corresponds to a cluster (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Fraley and Raftery, 2002</ref>). We model the probability of independently observing both location and intensity of a local maxima i 2 S max structural from a cluster k as:</p><formula>p ik ¼ p ~ fi Èðx i ; k , AE k Þ ð 1Þ</formula><p>where p ~ fi is a probability proportional to the intensity ~ f i , and È is a probability density function in the form of a multivariate normal distribution with mean k and covariance AE k. For simplification, we assume that the clusters are spherical with different sizes, i.e. AE k ¼ k I. The main difference between our model and the standard model-based clustering (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Fraley and Raftery, 2002</ref>) is the inclusion of the image intensity related term p ~ fi in Equation (1). Our simulation experiments show that the inclusion of image intensity improves the clustering performance (Supplementary Document). The likelihood for the mixture model with K clusters is:</p><formula>Lð 1 ,. .. , K ; 1 ,. .. , K ; 1 ,. .. , K jxÞ ¼ Y i2Smax structural X K k¼1 k p ik</formula><p>where x represents the collection of observed local maxima, and k is the probability of cluster k (i.e. cluster mixing probability). A model-based clustering determines the parameters f k g, f k g, f k g that maximizes L. We use a scale-space representation to estimate cluster centers f k g. Given a scale ! 2 Ã , we obtain the set S , max of local maxima with positive intensities in ~ f. The local maxima j 1 ,. .. , j jS,maxj are ordered with decreasing intensity values,</p><formula>i.e. ~ f ðx , j1 Þ !. .. ! ~ f x , jjS , maxj</formula><p>40, where x , jk is the corresponding location of local maxima j k on ~ f. We choose cluster centers as the first K local maxima, i.e k ¼ x , jk , 8k ¼ 1,. .. , K Similar to the standard model based clustering (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Celeux and Govaert, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Fraley and Raftery, 2002</ref>), an Expectation Maximization algorithm is used to estimate f k g and f k g. The expectation maximization is defined by two iterative steps: E-step: update an estimated posterior probability ^ z ik that the local maximum i belongs to cluster k:</p><formula>^ z ik k p ik P K j¼1 j p ij</formula><p>M-step: update the cluster mixing probability k , and variances k , given the new parameters in the previous step:</p><formula>k n k P K j¼1 n j where n k :¼ X i2Smax structural ^ z ik and k trðW k Þ 3n k where W k ¼ X i2Smax structural ^ z ik ðx i À k Þðx i À k Þ &gt;</formula><p>The Expectation Maximization algorithm iterates until there is no significant change in the likelihood L. The clustering of local maxima leads to clusters of the corresponding segments (Figs 2F and 7E). Using statistical modeling for clustering enables the determination of an optimal set of clusters through model selection. By varying the scale and cluster number K, we obtain the optimal values for scale and cluster set using the Bayesian Information Criterion (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Fraley and Raftery, 2002</ref>):</p><p>BIC ¼ 2 log L À K log jS max structural j</p><p>The final target complex is then represented by combining multiple segments that fulfill the following criteria: (i) they belong to same cluster in the model based clustering; (ii) they are in consecutive contact to each other; and (iii) the maximum intensity values _ f ij of the voxels between i277</p><p>Crowded subtomogram segmentation and alignment two consecutive segments i and j is larger than a threshold. The threshold is computed as c boundary cutoff factor std i, j2Smax structural ð _ f ij Þ, where c boundary cutoff factor is a constant parameter. The target complex region is then selected as the combined segments that contain at least one structural boundary segment (defined by S max structural boundary ) and are located closest to the center of the subtomogram. To prevent that small features of the target complex are excluded, a dilation operation is performed to define the target complex region A (Figs 2G and 7F).</p></div>

Given a 3D rotation R, we can calculate a correlation</p><formula>R ðf, gÞ ¼ R f Ã R g ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi R jF fj 2 Ã R M 2 g q ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi R M 2 f Ã R jF gj 2 q ð2Þ</formula><p>where Ã R is the rotation operator such that ðÃ R eÞðxÞ :¼ e½R À1 ðxÞ for any function e : R 3 ! C, and R 2 R 3Â3 is the rotation matrix corresponding to 3D rotation R. As in<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Xu et al. (2012)</ref>, the correlation measure R in Equation (2) is equivalent (up to a constant factor.) to a popular constrained correlation score with missing wedge correction (Fo¨rster<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Fo¨rster et al., 2008</ref>). The fast rotational alignment is based on sampling of R simultaneously over all rotations R. To do so, we apply a fast 3D volumetric rotational matching (<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kovacs and Wriggers, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Xu et al., 2012</ref>). It can be seen that Equation (2) can be formulated as being composed of three rotational correlation functions of the form R :¼ R p Ã R q, where p and q are component functions; " e denotes the complex conjugate (when e is a real valued function, the complex conjugate " e ¼ e.) of a function e. Specifically, we can represent R as</p><formula>R ¼ ð0Þ R ffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ð1Þ R q ffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ð2Þ R q ¼ R p 0 Ã R q 0 ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi R p 1 Ã R q 1 q ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi R p 2 Ã R q 2 q ð3Þ where p 0 :¼ f, q 0 :¼ g, p 1 :¼ jFfj 2 , q 1 :¼ M 2 g , p 2 :¼ M 2 f , and q 2 :¼ jFgj 2 .</formula><p>When represented in spherical coordinates, the p and q components of these three functions R can be approximated by an SH expansion. Following Garzo´n<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Garzo´n et al. (2007)</ref>, Kovacs and Wriggers (2002) and<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Xu et al., (2012)</ref>, the p and q components in Equation (3) can be expressed as:</p><formula>pðr, , Þ % X BÀ1 l¼0 X l m¼Àl C p lm ðrÞY lm ð, Þ qðr, , Þ % X BÀ1 l¼0 X l m¼Àl C q lm ðrÞY lm ð, Þ</formula><p>where B is the bandwidth, and C lm ðrÞ are the coefficients associated with the complex-valued spherical harmonic function Y lm ð, Þ with degree l and order m, where r, and are the radial distance, co-latitude and longitude, respectively, which define the position in spherical coordinate. When a suitable parameterization of the 3D rotational group is achieved, the rotational correlation function R :¼ R p Ã R q of all sampled rotations R can be represented as an inverse FFT of a 3D array of the sum of integrals as follows (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Garzo´nGarzo´n et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kovacs and Wriggers, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Xu et al., 2012</ref>):</p><formula>R ¼ F À1 m, n, m 0 X l d l mn d l nm 0 Z C p lm ðrÞC q lm 0 ðrÞr 2 dr " #</formula><p>where d l mh are real coefficients defining the elements of the Wigner small d-matrix evaluated at 90 . As a consequence of the aforementioned formulation, the cross-correlation functions can be efficiently sampled by using FFT simultaneously over all sampled rotations (<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kovacs and Wriggers, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Xu et al., 2012</ref>). The sampling is given as twice the bandwidth B used in the SH transformations. Therefore, R can be efficiently computed over all sampled rotations R. Similar to<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bartesaghi et al. (2008) and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Xu et al. (2012)</ref>, the set of candidate rotations are then obtained by identifying the local maxima of with respect to the rotational degrees of freedom R. To obtain the optimal translation, a fast translational search is performed for each candidate rotation over the full correlation function R by using FFT. Finally, the best combination of rotation and translation is chosen.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Generation of simulated tomograms from phantom and experimental structures</head><p>We follow a previously applied methodology for generating subtomograms from initial structures by simulating the tomographic imaging process as realistically as possible, allowing for the inclusion of noise, tomographic distortions due to missing wedge and electron optical factors such as CTF and Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Beck et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Fo¨rsterFo¨rster et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Nickell et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Xu and Alber, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Xu et al., 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Xu et al., , 2012</ref>). A density map of the complexes (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 4</ref>) are generated by applying a low pass filter at 4 nm resolution to the atomic structures using the PDB2VOL program of the Situs 2.0 package (<ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Wriggers et al., 1999</ref>) with voxel length of 1 nm. In addition, a density map of a phantom model is generated (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 4A</ref>). These density maps are used as base maps, both of size 64 3 voxels, and they are randomly rotated and translated to generate density map instances in uncrowded conditions. To generate a crowded environment, two additional structures (randomly chosen from the phantom model or the ribosome complex) are randomly oriented and placed into the density map $32 voxels away from the center of the map. The density maps of the target complex and neighboring structures are used as input for simulating electron micrograph images at different tilt angles. Our simulated subtomograms therefore contain a wedge-shaped region in reciprocal space for which no structure factors have been measured (i.e. the missing wedge effect), resulting in distortions in the density map as observed in the experimental measurements. To generate realistic micrographs, noise is added to the images according to a given SNR level (ranging between 0.05 and 0.001), defined as the ratio between the variances of the signal and noise (Fo¨rsterFo¨rster et al., 2008) (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 4A</ref>). The resulting image is convoluted with a CTF, which describes the imaging in the transmission electron microscope in a linear approximation (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Frank, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Nickell et al., 2005</ref>). We also convolute the density map with the corresponding MTF of a typical detector used in tomography. Typical experimental acquisition parameters (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Beck et al., 2009</ref>) were used: voxel grid length ¼ 1 nm, the spherical aberration ¼ 2 Â 10 À3 m, the defocus value ¼ À4 Â 10 À6 m, the MTF corresponded to a realistic electron detector (<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">McMullan et al., 2009</ref>), defined as sincð!=2Þ where ! is the fraction of the Nyquist frequency. Finally, we use a backprojection algorithm (<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Nickell et al., 2005</ref>) to generate a tomogram from the individual 2D micrographs generated at the various tilt angles (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Beck et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Xu et al., 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Xu et al., , 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Xu and Alber, 2012</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Segmentation of the target complex in simulated subtomograms</head><p>To determine the optimal scale for surface enhancement, we vary from 1.0 nm to 3.0 nm. At high noise levels (e.g. SNR 0:01), the optimal Ã is usually obtained at $2.0 nm. For the detection of boundary segments, we set the significance levels c min intensity factor ¼ c min surface factor ¼ 1. For determining the target complex, we choose c boundary cutoff factor ¼ 0, ignoring all boundary segment maxima with negative intensities in f _ f ij g. For combining segments, we scan from 2 Ã to 10 nm and scan the cluster number K from 1 to 5. To assess the target complex segmentation, we calculate the overlap between the determined target complex A and the ground truth A true complex. We also calculate the overlap between A and regions occupied by the surrounding structures in the crowded ground truth density map A surrounding structure. Then, we calculate the median of the following three overlap scores across 100 simulated subtomograms at each distortion level and for each of the benchmark structures: o true positive rate ¼ jA \ A true complex j jA true complex j o false positive rate ¼ jA \ A c true complex j jA c true complex j o surrounding structure ¼ jA \ A surrounding structure j jA surrounding structure j where A c denotes the complementary set of A. Our results show that for all distortion levels, the median of o true positive rate is at least 0.9, and o false positive rate is at most 0.004, demonstrating a good performance in segmenting the areas of the corresponding target structures. In contrast, the median of o surrounding structure is close to zero for most of the distortion levels, indicating that our target complex segmentation method can successfully exclude surrounding structures in the subtomograms. Only at high distortion levels, the median of o surrounding structure starts to deviate from zero (Supplementary Tables S7–S12).Crowded subtomogram segmentation and alignment</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Assessment of constrained center of mass detection</head><p>The constrained center of mass is expected to be invariant to rigid transforms of the corresponding structures. The assessment of the rotational invariance of our constrained center of mass is performed as follows. We randomly select 100 pairs of subtomograms for each of the benchmark structures. For each pair of subtomograms i and j, we calculate d ccm inverse, ij :¼ jjc ccm inverse, i À c ccm inverse, j jj 2 as a measure of the degree of invariance, where c ccm inverse, i and c ccm inverse, j are the corresponding locations of the constrained center of masses in the original complex that is used to generate the instances by random rigid transforms. The smaller d ccm inverse, ij , the higher is the degree of invariance, indicating a good performance. The performance is expressed as the median of fd ccm inverse, ij g, which is listed in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">Figure 5</ref>and Supplementary Tables S1, S4, S13 and S16. We can see that the estimation error is generally smaller than 3, indicating high accuracy even at high distortion levels. As can be seen in the following section, the degree of invariance is sufficiently small to allow successful pairwise fast rotational alignments in real space.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Fast rotational alignment of subtomograms</head><p>Our fast alignment method relies on fast rotational matching. In the following two subsections, we calculate the rotational alignment errors for the pairs of complexes, both for the crowded as well as uncrowded cases. The rotational alignment error is calculated as follows: Suppose R Ã is the rotation matrix calculated for an alignment, and R true is the true rotation matrix. The rotation alignment error can then be measured as d rot err ¼ jjR Ã À R true jj F , where jj Á jj F is Frobenius norm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.1">Uncrowded subtomograms</head><p>First, we test our alignment method with uncrowded subtomograms, which contain one complex without surrounding structures. We compare the alignment errors between our new alignment method presented here and our previous method that relied on fast rotational matching in reciprocal space (<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Xu et al., 2012</ref>) (left column of<ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>and Supplementary Tables S2 and S5). It is evident that our new method improves the alignment accuracy on highly distorted subtomograms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.2">Crowded subtomograms</head><p>Next, we compare the two alignment methods (<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Xu et al., 2012</ref>) with crowded subtomograms, which also contain fragments of additional complexes (right column of<ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>and Supplementary Tables S14 and S17). It can be clearly seen that when considering crowded subtomograms without excluding surrounding structures, our previous method (<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Xu et al., 2012</ref>) generally fails in finding the correct alignment. By contrast, our new alignment method aided by target complex segmentation is only marginally affected by crowding and the existence of the surrounding structures. Our new method clearly outperforms our previous method when dealing with subtomograms from crowded cellular environments. Similar improvement in performance is also observed by testing the crowded subtomograms of four additional benchmark complexes (Supplementary Tables S19–S22) (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. 4B</ref>) used in (<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Xu et al., 2012</ref>). We have also measured the correlation between d ccm inverse, ij and d rot err (Supplementary Tables S3, S6, S15 and S18) and<ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>. Rotational alignment error for the phantom model and the ribosome complex inside uncrowded and crowded subtomograms simulated at different distortion levels. The error is measured in terms of the median d rot err across 100 pairwise alignments. The nodes on the solid black grid correspond to the alignment performance of our new method. The nodes in the red dashed grid correspond to the alignment performance of our previous method (<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Xu et al., 2012</ref>). The green regions correspond to the distortion levels at which both methods can successfully perform alignments. The yellow regions correspond to the distortion levels at which our new method outperforms our previous method and correctly aligns the subtomograms, whereas our previous method (<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Xu et al., 2012</ref>) fails. The gray region corresponds to the distortion levels at which both methods fail. For both alignment methods, we choose a rotation angle interval 5 , i.e. the bandwidth B ¼ 36tested the performance with respect to the levels of crowdedness (Supplementary Figs S1–S3). At low to median distortion levels, we observe moderate correlation between the aforementioned two quantities. At high distortion levels, the correlations are small, showing that the alignment is more affected by high levels of distortions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Segmenting target complexes in subtomograms extracted from experimental whole-cell tomogram of the human pathogen Leptospira interrogans</head><p>We tested our method also on experimental subtomograms extracted from a whole-cell tomogram of Leptospira interrogans in undisturbed conditions (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Beck et al., 2009</ref>). Segmenting of complexes in such subtomograms is significantly more challenging because the macromolecular crowding is high and because the SNR levels and resolution of these subtomograms is typically low. Beck et al. (2009) have identified several complexes in the tomogram using template matching (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Best et al., 2007</ref>). The templates were generated by using density maps of structures in the Protein Databank and convoluted with CTF and MTF. As a test case, we use two subtomograms with high template matching scores to the ribosome template. For each of these matches, we extracted a subtomogram of size 49 3 voxels that was large enough to contain an instance of the complex and certain amount of surrounding structure fragments. The results shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">Figure 7</ref>demonstrate that our method can successfully segment the target ribosome complex while surrounding structures are clearly excluded. The ribosome positions agree with those detected in the template matching. We further extended the study to the subtomograms corresponding to the top 20 template matching scores. Overall, 18 of them showed successful segmentation (Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. S4</ref>). We also analyzed the target complex segmentation performance with respect to the level of crowdedness. The crowdedness of the Leptospira interrogans subtomograms ranges from 0 to 60%. The true-positive and false-positive rates plotted in Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure S4</ref>shows that, in most situations, our method can correctly identify the target complex region. Only at high crowdedness level, (i.e. 450%), our method fails to correctly identify the target complex regions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6">Analysis of computational costs</head><p>We implemented the methods in MATLAB and carried out our tests on a computer cluster consisting of 2.3–2.7 GHz computer nodes. On average, the target complex detection step takes 14.8 s. In this step, the major proportion of computation time was used for the scale selection (8.6 s on average). In practice, we can determine a fixed scale parameter from a set of training subtomograms and directly apply it to all subtomograms. Then, on average, only 6.2 s would be used for detecting the target complex. The computer memory consumption is small. Because a subtomogram is typically small (a subtomogram of size 64 3 corresponds to at most 2 M memory), our detection step uses no more memory than 20 times the size of a single subtomogram. The most computational intensive step in the classification process is the alignment. The computational cost of our new method is essentially the same as our previous method (<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Xu et al., 2012</ref>) and therefore allows high-throughput subtomogram classifications.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig.1.</head><figDesc>Fig. 1.

			<note place="foot" n="4"> CONCLUSION Cryo-electron tomograms provide useful information for simultaneously detecting the native structures and their spatial cellular locations of a large number of macromolecular complexes. However, the high level of macromolecular crowding and distortions in the extracted subtomograms makes such analysis challenging. In addition, the availability of a large number of subtomograms containing potential complexes requires highthroughput analysis techniques. In this article, we propose an automatic segmentation technique that isolates the target complex inside a crowded subtomogram. We further detect the rigid transform invariant center of mass of the target complex and propose an improved fast alignment method using fast rotational matching in real space. The new method shows good performance in segmenting target complexes in crowded subtomograms and performing fast rotational alignments using both simulated and experimental subtomograms. This performance is a necessary condition for high-throughput structural classifications of complexes in whole-cell tomograms. This work represents a step toward high-throughput and reference-free Visual Proteomics analysis of highly crowded whole-cell cryo-electron tomograms.</note>

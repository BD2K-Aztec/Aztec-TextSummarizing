				<p>Motivation: To understand the molecular mechanisms of neurons, it is imperative to identify genomic dissimilarities within the heterogeneity of the neural system. This is especially true for neuronal disorders in which spatial considerations are of critical nature. For this purpose, Hirudo medicinalis provides here an ideal system in which we are able to follow gene expression along the central nervous system, to affiliate location with gene behavior. Results: In all, 221.1 million high-quality short reads were sequenced on the Illumina Hiseq2000 platform at the single ganglion level. Thereafter, a de novo assembly was performed using two state-of-the-art assemblers, Trinity and Trans-ABySS, to reconstruct a comprehensive de novo transcriptome. Classification of Trinity and Trans-ABySS transcripts produced a non-redundant set of 76 845 and 268 355 transcripts (4200 bp), respectively. Remarkably, using Trinity, 82% of the published medicinal leech messenger RNAs was identified. For the innexin family, all of the 21 recently reported genes were identified. Spatial regulation analysis across three ganglia throughout the entire central nervous system revealed distinct patterns of gene expression. These transcriptome data were combined with expression distribution to produce a spatio-transcripto map along the ganglia chain. This study provides a resource for gene discovery and gene regulation in future studies.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Following the complete set of transcripts is elemental for uncovering novel molecular components, and for studying physiological and pathological conditions. Next-generation sequencing technologies provide cost-effective means for quantifying the transcriptome. Recent technological advances have revolutionized the field, making it possible to analyze the transcriptome of selected sets of cells within an organism, leading to the collection of data at a high spatial-transcriptomic resolution. Exploring gene expression profiles quantitatively in combination with the cellular physical distribution in an intact model may provide the link between genomic information, contextual function and behavior. In the brain, associating gene regulation of collections of neurons within their spatial organization and role is of special importance to the study of health and disease. Particularly it is important in neurodegenerative diseases where loss of function is highly correlated with abnormalities in form (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Gaggelli et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Kanaan et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Seixas et al., 2012</ref>). To perform such mapping, the nervous system of the medicinal leech, Hirudo medicinalis was selected. This system, a favorable model for investigating development, regeneration and repair, provides a useful model due to its simple structure and distinct behaviors (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Coggeshall and Fawcett, 1964</ref>). The central nervous system (CNS) of the leech consists of a chain of ganglia that has been characterized anatomically and physiologically, and presents high similarity between ganglia (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Coggeshall and Fawcett, 1964</ref>). Each such ganglion contains 400 neurons, most with known function and connections (<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Macagno, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Meriaux et al., 2011</ref>). Previous gene expression studies on leech CNS have resulted in the characterization of specific genes (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Harvey et al., 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Wysocka-Diller et al., 1989</ref>). Attempts have been made to clone genes of interest via the candidate gene approach (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Blackshaw et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Vergote et al., 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Vergote et al., , 2006</ref>). Recently, an expression sequence tag database was constructed and is now available to the scientific community (<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Macagno et al., 2010</ref>). Yet, functional genomic studies in the H.medicinalis are in their infancy (<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Kandarian et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Macagno et al., 2010</ref>). Recent approaches in RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis accommodate low amounts of total RNA, multiple condition comparisons and overcome the de novo assembly challenge (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Birol et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Grabherr et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Robertson et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Sadamoto et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Simpson et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Vijay et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Zhao et al., 2011</ref>). Here, an RNA-seq method is used to study transcription along the leech CNS. The transcriptome of three ganglia is examined: close to the head, mid-body and close to the tail. This choice of three representative ganglia enables querying of gene expression profiles and linking gene expression with CNS spatial organization, at the single ganglion level. The choice of three biologically distinct conditions and not the common two-condition differential analysis (<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Leng et al., 2013</ref>) adds a level of complexity, enabling the identification of latent patterns of expression. In the current study, a transcriptome of the adult leech H.medicinalis CNS was produced. A non-redundant set of transcripts has been identified and analyzed in various forms, including gene–isoform relationships, functional relationships, full-length analysis and gene ontology. To verify the full-length analysis and coverage level, the innexin family, which has been previously studied in the leech, was tested (H.medicinalis and Hirudo Verbana) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Anava et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Dykes and Macagno, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Dykes et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Kandarian et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Phelan, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref>*To whom correspondence should be addressed.<ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Yen and Saier, 2007</ref>). A differential expression analysis over the three spatially distinct regions has been used to identify patterns of gene expression. The gene expression profiles were characterized and classified into nine major patterns, demonstrating dominant expression distributions along the ganglia chain. In the present study, advantage is taken of a simple model, the leech CNS, together with a novel differential expression approach, to combine the transcriptome with the spatial configuration, thus, producing a spatio-transcripto map of the CNS. Resultant data provide a highly useful functional and genomic resource for future systemic studies. Moreover, the strategy for transcriptome analysis presented here may be helpful in other similar transcriptome studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Leech RNA</head><p>As described in the Workflow (Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. S1</ref>), RNA has been extracted from three adult medicinal leeches (Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. S2</ref>). All were obtained from a H.medicinalis colony grown in France at Ricarimpex Farm. Leeches are maintained in our animal facility in tanks populated with about 20 leeches in a controlled environment, at 16 C and 12 h/12 h day/night cycle. Before use, leeches were placed on ice for 30 min and then dissected dorsally. Three ganglia were harvested from each leech (numbers 2, 10 and 19) (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>and Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. S2</ref>). For technical replicas, ganglion number 10 was harvested from three additional leeches, pooled together for RNA isolation and separated into three samples for RNA-seq.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">RNA isolation and quality control</head><p>Total RNA was extracted from each ganglion using RNeasy Lipid Tissue (Qiagen). The quality and quantity of each RNA sample was assessed by Agilent's 100 Bioanalyzer pico chip. RNA samples contained a concentration of 45–170 pg/l.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">RNA amplification</head><p>RNA has been amplified using Ovation Kit v2.0 (NuGEN). Before amplification, all samples were lyophilized using a SpeedVac instrument and then suspended in 5 l of nuclease-free water.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Illumina sequencing and quality control</head><p>Complementary DNAs (cDNAs) were quantified using Nanodrop and Bioanalyzer DNA 1000 Chip (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Table S1</ref>). Two micrograms (in 100 l) of cDNAs were fragmented using Bioruptor instrument with three 10 s ('on') cycles of sonication interrupted by 90 s pauses ('off'). The library preparation proceeded with the 'END-REPAIR' reaction from the NEB kit (NEBNext) and then with TruSeq DNA/RNA library preparation. cDNA libraries were loaded on a high-sensitivity chip and quantified on the QuBIT instrument (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Table S2</ref>), to prepare the two 6-plex pools that were separated into two pools (Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. S2</ref>). The two pools were quantified (molarity) on Bioanalyzer with the High Sensitivity DNA kit and diluted. The cDNA libraries were generated using messenger RNA-seq (mRNA-seq) assay for transcriptome sequencing on Illumina Hiseq2000. Three cDNA libraries were generated from the total RNA of ganglion number 19 and three cDNA libraries were generated from the pooled total RNA of ganglion 10 in equal amounts, and sequencing was performed in one lane to generate 50 bp single end (SE) reads. A similar procedure was carried out for ganglia numbers 2 and 19. Library construction and<ref type="bibr">, 10, 19</ref>) and three more samples were taken for technical replicates from ganglion 10 (for more information see Section 2 and Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. S1</ref>–S3) sequencing was performed by a commercial service provider (IGA, Applied Genomics Institute). The sequenced data generated in this study were deposited at Gene Expression Omnibus (record GSE45569 or in Sequence Read Archive (SRA) accession number SRR799260-71).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">De novo assembly</head><p>Various programs for de novo assembly of the 50 bp SE sequence reads were tested to generate a non-redundant set of transcripts/transcripts. Among the various programs available, the publicly available program Trinity (version trinityrnaseq_r2012-03-17) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Grabherr et al., 2011</ref>) was used. Trinity has been developed for assembly of short reads using de Bruijn graph algorithm by single k-mer. Trinity was executed in the inchworm method and default assembly parameters were used. The publicly available program, Trans-ABySS (version 1.3.2) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Robertson et al., 2010</ref>), which has been developed for assembly of short reads using de Bruijn graph algorithm by multiple k-mer, was used as well. It has been suggested (<ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Robertson et al., 2010</ref>) to use the assembly of ABySS (version 1.3.2) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Ning Leng et al., 2012</ref>) followed by Trans-ABySS. Assembly of transcripts generated by ABySS into transcripts using Trans-ABySS with default parameters for SE sequence reads and k-mer values of (25–50) was performed.<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Li and Dewey, 2011</ref>), and then, as recommended by the Cufflinks pipeline (Version 2.0.2) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Roberts et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Trapnell et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Trapnell et al., 2012</ref>), Tophat (Version 2.0.4) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Langmead et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Trapnell et al., 2009</ref>) for splice junction mapping, followed by estimating read counts using cufflinks. To obtain a reasonably sized set of transcripts, a smaller set was defined by filtering out transcripts estimated by RSEM with mean counts of 53 and45000 across all samples. This range based on the x–y correlation as presented in the scatter plots (Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. S3</ref>) has led to $20% of filtered out transcripts. Those transcripts were irregular, such as ribosomal RNAs or polymerase chain reaction duplicates, products of amplification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6">Mapping reads and estimating counts</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.7">Full-length and coverage analysis</head><p>Identifying whether reconstructed transcripts are full-length is notoriously difficult. For de novo assembly, the task is even harder, as there is no reference to work with. Usually for de novo assembly, the alternative for organism transcripts is a close organism transcript. This was accomplished here in a few steps. First, published genes were examined and then innexin genes were analyzed as a well-studied family in the leech (<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Kandarian et al., 2012</ref>). Blast results of Trinity and Trans-ABySS assemblies were used to detect innexin genes in our reconstructed assemblies. Innexins with an E-value cutoff set to e À10 were chosen first, after which, for maximizing confidence, only the innexin genes with an E-value of 0.0 were chosen, filtered for a perfect match, otherwise the innexins may be aligned to 41 transcript (innexins show high levels of similarity among themselves). For further analysis, only innexin genes that both Trinity and Trans-ABySS reconstructed were used. For the coverage analysis, the same innexin genes reconstructed by both Trinity and Trans-ABySS were used and then Bowtie was used for mapping the raw reads to the innexins.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.8">Gene–isoform relationship</head><p>De novo assembled transcriptomes present a unique challenge in obtaining an accurate gene–isoform relationship. Therefore, the RSEM (<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Li and Dewey, 2011</ref>) tool 'rsem-generate-ngvector' was used to cluster isoforms based on measures directly relating to read mapping ambiguity. This tool first calculates the 'unmappability' of each transcript—the ratio between the number of k-mers with at least one perfect match to other transcripts and the total number of k-mers of this transcript where k is a parameter. Then, an Ng vector is generated by applying a K-means algorithm to the 'unmappability' values with the number of clusters set to 3. This ensures that the mean 'unmappability' scores for clusters are in ascending order. All transcripts with lengths 5k are assigned to cluster 3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.9">Functional relationships and gene ontology</head><p>To establish functional and evolutionary relationships, BLASTX (version 2.2.23) was used to identify sequence conservation. Both Trinity and Trans-ABySS assemblies were run against Swiss-Prot and non-redundant databases downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Best hits were used as DAVID (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Jiao et al., 2012</ref>) input for detecting enriched gene ontology for the assemblies. Results of the single best hit were extracted and hits with an E-value of e À10 were considered significant.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.10">Differential expression</head><p>Two approaches were implemented to determine the differential expression of the transcripts. Initially, EBSeq (Version 1.1.3) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Leng et al., 2013</ref>), which uses an empirical Bayesian approach to accommodate multiple condition comparisons was used. EBSeq uses RSEM counts as input with upper quartile normalization. EBSeq classified transcripts into five patterns with a false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of 0.05 (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 2C</ref>). Each pattern was further divided into sub patterns by changing 6 ¼ to ! and 5 symbols to achieve a more accurate representation of EBSeq patterns (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 2D</ref>). Next, EBSeq patterns were divided into three groups by a simple condition: all transcripts in the same state of expression in the first two ganglia were defined in the same group (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 3</ref>). In addition, Cuffdiff (Version 2.0.2) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Trapnell et al., 2012</ref>) was used with upper quartile normalization and with an FDR threshold of 0.05. Cuffdiff uses Cufflinks counts as input for the beta negative binomial approach. Unlike EBSeq, Cuffdiff sorts out only two conditions at a time.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Sequencing and quality control</head><p>An amount of 221 138 673 sequence reads were generated, each 50 bp in length, encompassing roughly 11 giga bases (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Table S3</ref>). The expression levels of the technical replicates, estimated by RSEM, showed a strong Pearson correlation (r ¼ $0.9) (Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. S3</ref>). All samples passed FastQC basic statistics for quality estimation, per base sequence quality, per sequence quality score and length distribution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">De novo transcriptome assembly</head><p>The de novo assembly of the H.medicinalis CNS transcriptome was reconstructed by various assembly programs. As described in Section 2, assembly was performed first using Trinity, which generated 76 845 non-redundant transcripts/contigs (4200 bp in length).Swiss-Prot database and a set of 100 601 transcripts produced significant alignment to the NCBI non-redundant database. Using BLASTN, Trinity was found to have identified 86 of 104 (82%) reported mRNAs, whereas Trans-ABySS identified 82 (78%). The N50, median, average length, total length of transcriptome and GC content for transcripts generated by Trinity was 2188, 550, 1124, 86 436 165 bp, 41.60%, whereas those generated by Trans-ABySS was 1140 , 535 , 809, 217 129658 bp, 42.24% (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Table S4</ref>). The same tests have been performed for Helobdella robusta and Capitella teleta, as described in Supplementary Table S4. Estimating mapping rate of the assemblies using Bowtie revealed that $50% of the reads with at least one reported alignment for Trinity assembly and $30% for Trans-ABySS assembly (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Table S5</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Gene–isoform relationship</head><p>Using RSEM over Trinity output isoforms showed that most transcripts had 1 isoform, 3 isoforms and 2 isoforms (50 548, 21 273, 5024, respectively), and Trans-ABySS showed that most transcripts had 3 isoforms, 1 isoform and 2 isoforms (212 543, 29 226, 26 586, respectively) (Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. S4</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Contribution of specific samples to the analysis</head><p>By estimating the percentile of transcripts expressed in each sample (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig. S5</ref>), we found that according to the Trinity assembly, the highest number of the transcripts expressed across all samples was in sample number 5, which is ganglion number 10. According to the Tran-ABySS assembly, this was sample number 12, which is also ganglion number 10. The lowest number of transcripts came from sample 1, which is ganglion number 2 for both the Trinity and Trans-ABySS assemblies. Other samples had similar quantities between assemblies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Full-length and coverage analysis</head><p>For both Trinity and Trans-ABySS assemblies, 21 different innexin genes were found, as reported previously (<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Kandarian et al., 2012</ref>). With an E-value cutoff of 0.0 (see Section 2), 13 innexin genes were found for Trinity assembly as well as for Trans-ABySS assembly, four of which were found to be highly similar, whereas the other nine presented various lengths in different assemblies. Trinity assembled longer transcripts compared with Trans-ABySS in eight of the nine cases (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig.  S6</ref>). In addition to full-length analysis, coverage of those 13 innexin genes was also tested and found without preferences to either 5 0 or 3 0 , as could be expected (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig. S7</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6">Pattern distribution</head><p>After filtering out, transcripts of 53 and 45000 mean counts across all samples, 63 077 transcripts were examined for spatial distribution using EBSeq. EBSeq classified Trinity transcriptsinto five patterns, each of which contained a different number of transcripts as shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 2A</ref>. Transcripts were then filtered out by setting an FDR of 0.05, which resulted in less transcripts per pattern (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 2B</ref>) and correlated transcripts in each pattern to the BLASTX results. A list of genes expressed within each pattern was found. DAVID analyses showed that many genes identified by EBSeq were involved in neuron projection, nervous system regulation, neurogenesis regulation, neural differentiation, developmental processes and metabolism. Once the groups were defined (as described in Section 2) and each of the sub groups counted, dominant sub groups were identified as described in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 4</ref>(G1.1, G2.2, G3.1). By examining this hypothesis using a 2 goodness-of-fit test, the data were found in consistent with random distribution (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig. S8A</ref>–C). Furthermore, all possible pairings between the leeches were examined (leech number 1 versus 2, 2 versus 3 and 1 versus 3), and the same dominant behavior of sub groups was observed (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig. S9A</ref>–C). In addition, using a 2 test for independence, a dependency was observed between the states (equal/unequal expression) of the transcripts in ganglion 2 and 10 and those of the transcripts in ganglion 10 and 19 ( 2 ¼ 1851.208, degrees of freedom (df) ¼ 1, P52.2e-16) (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig. S8D</ref>). To further establish the statistical significance of the abundance of the identified spatial gene patterns between the nine samples, 30 retagged locations out of the original data were produced (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Table S7</ref>). The identified patterns in the shuffled patterning were reevaluated., the middle circle is ganglion number 10 (orange) and the right is ganglion number 19 (green). EBSeq patterns can be categorized into sub patterns and then divided into three groups (G1, G2, G3) and nine sub groups ('<ref type="bibr">.1', '.2', '.3'</ref>) as described in Section 2. G1.1 is an example of equal expression between the three ganglia. G2.3 is an example of downregulation between the three ganglia from left to right. G3.3 is an example of upregulation between the three ganglia from left to rightResults from this analysis provide further validation to the statistical tests used to establish the patterns.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">DISCUSSION</head><p>Along with the rapid advances in sequencing technologies, a set of bioinformatics tools has recently been developed for shortread sequence data assembly (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Birol et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Grabherr et al., 2011</ref>) and analysis (<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Leng et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Sadamoto et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Trapnell et al., 2012</ref>). De novo assembly of short reads without a known reference genome is considered non-standard and non-trivial, but still attracts enough attention to provide the community with an adequate set of tools (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Duan et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Robertson et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Sadamoto et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Vijay et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Zhao et al., 2011</ref>). Whole-transcriptome sequencing provides a functional genomic view of the studied tissue. Recent developments in high-throughput technologies have provided a plethora of molecular data, but a thorough account of RNA expression levels in the H.medicinalis is still lacking. In this study, a de novo assembly of transcriptome is produced using short reads from non-model annelids, the H.medicinalis, for which public sequence data are still limited. The production of a verified transcriptome is used here as a tool to study the CNS of H.medicinalis. H.medicinalis is one of the most important annelids and as such a valuable model for studying nervous system structure, function, development, regeneration and repair. More than 221 million sequence reads were generated for H.medicinalis. Validation of the different assembly tools significantly affects the assembly output and is needed for optimal results. Trinity and Trans-ABySS have been used for the reconstruction of the H.medicinalis transcriptome. More reported mRNAs of H.medicinalis have been identified using Trinity. Moreover, examination of full-length transcripts reveals that Trinity reconstructed fuller transcripts for the innexin family, making Trinity transcripts the choice for downstream analyses. Furthermore, we found that the N50, median and average lengths of the transcripts generated using Trinity were longer (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Grabherr et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Mende et al., 2012</ref>) and with higher similarity to related organisms as shown in Supplementary Table S4 (a comparison with Trans-ABySS) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Macagno et al., 2010</ref>). A non-redundant set of 76 845 transcripts is reported. The gene–isoform relationship of the H.medicinalis transcripts shows that the largest fraction of transcripts presents a single isoform. About 30% of the transcripts show significant homology with Swiss-Prot sequences. Comparison with other openly available leech datasets, the transcriptome of H.robusta, shows a 39% identity at the amino acid level (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Table S6</ref>). Interestingly, a comparison with Capitella capitata (a polychaete) shows similar high levels of amino acid identity (34%) (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Table S6</ref>). The unannotated transcripts (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chopin et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Frobius and Seaver, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Murray et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Salzet et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Tahtouh et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Tasiemski et al., 2004</ref>) might indicate novel, and possibly, species-specific functions. Perhaps most importantly, the expression pattern distribution in the leech nervous system presents a significantly larger class of transcripts that are co-expressed along the leech's spatial configuration. Other patterns are much smaller and do not co-express, but rather dominate specific expression patterns along the nervous system. This may indicate that (i) most of the transcripts tend to be located in the ganglia butare not ganglion specific. For example, HSP90 belongs to the previously described 'pattern 1', which supports our classification patterns, and (ii) within each group there is a sub group more dominant, which may suggest that spatial regulation dominates gene function in the ganglia chain. In conclusion, the specific genes and their spatial templates of expression across the CNS of a whole organism provide the community, for the first time, a functional affiliation between genomic and nerve loci.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig.1.</head><figDesc>Fig. 1.

				<p>Constraint network analysis (CNA) is a graph theory-based rigidity analysis approach for linking a biomolecule&apos;s structure, flexibility, (thermo)stability and function. Results from CNA are highly information-rich and require intuitive, synchronized and interactive visualization for a comprehensive analysis. We developed VisualCNA, an easy-to-use PyMOL plug-in that allows setup of CNA runs and analysis of CNA results linking plots with molecular graphics representations. From a practical viewpoint, the most striking feature of VisualCNA is that it facilitates interactive protein engineering aimed at improving thermostability. Availability and Implementation: VisualCNA and its dependencies (CNA and FIRST software) are available free of charge under GPL and academic licenses, respectively. VisualCNA and CNA are available at</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Structural flexibility (and rigidity) is important for a protein's function and stability. Being able to accurately predict protein flexibility is thus instrumental in protein-science and-engineering as well as drug design. Our group developed the Python-based software package Constraint Network Analysis (CNA) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Pfleger et al., 2013a</ref>,b) for characterizing biomolecular flexibility both at the global and residue level. CNA functions as a front-and back-end to the graph theorybased rigidity analysis software Floppy Inclusions and Rigid Substructure Topography (FIRST) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Jacobs et al., 2001</ref>) and has been used to predict protein thermostability, identify structural weak spots (<ref type="bibr">Gohlke, 2008, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Rathi et al., 2012</ref>), and link protein flexibility and function, including allosteric regulation (C. Pfleger and H. Gohlke, unpublished results). CNA models a protein as a body-and-bar constraint network in which bodies (atoms) are connected by bars (covalent and non-covalent interactions). A rigidity analysis is then performed using the pebble game algorithm (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Jacobs and Thorpe, 1995</ref>), resulting in a decomposition of the network into rigid and flexible regions. By removing non-covalent constraints from the network in the order of increasing strength, CNA simulates thermal unfolding. From the unfolding trajectory, CNA calculates several global and local flexibility indices (<ref type="bibr">Pfleger et al., 2013a,b</ref>). From the global indices, phase transition points are identified at which the network switches from rigid to flexible. These points are used to predict the thermostability of a protein and identify structural weak spots. Local indices describe intrinsic biomolecular flexibility at the level of bonds and can be compared with quantitative data from experiments on biomolecular mobility. The output from CNA is highly information-rich. For a comprehensive analysis, the data needs to be visualized as plots (showing global and local flexibility indices) as well as 3D graphics representations of the biomolecule, the constraint network, and the decomposition into rigid and flexible regions. Furthermore, the speed of CNA allows performing real-time rigidity analyses on biomolecules.Thus, interactive structural modifications and/or editing of the constraint network followed by a re-analysis of the biomolecule's flexibility can be performed iteratively. With this in mind, we developed VisualCNA, an intuitive, easy-to-use graphical interface for CNA built as a plug-in for the molecular viewer PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.5.0.3 Schrö dinger, LLC). VisualCNA supports scientists interested in the rigidity analysis of biomolecules by a synchronized and interactive visualization of the CNA output. It also enables interactive protein engineering for improving thermostability by iteratively mutating identified weak spots, performing a subsequent rigidity analysis, and automatically comparing CNA output from wild-type and mutant structures.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Implementation</head><p>VisualCNA is implemented in the Python programming language as a PyMOL plug-in for Linux operating systems. It uses the external modules NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Biopython, tkintertable, and Open Babel. All modules and the PyMOL source code are packaged alongside VisualCNA for easy installation. VisualCNA requires CNA and FIRST for rigidity analysis, which are distributed independently. A user manual is also distributed with VisualCNA, and tutorial videos are available online.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Description</head><p>The VisualCNA GUI consists of four panels: Setup, Analyze, Modify and Mutate. The Setup panel allows preparing variations of thermal unfolding simulations, i.e. based on a single network derived from a single input structure (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Radestock and Gohlke, 2008</ref>), an ensemble of networks derived from a single structure using definitions of fuzzy non-covalent constraints (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Pfleger and Gohke, 2013</ref>) or a structural ensemble (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Rathi et al., 2012</ref>). In the Analyze panel (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1C</ref>), CNA output from multiple thermal unfolding simulations can be shown simultaneously, which helps comparing wild-type and mutants. CNA results are shown as interactive plots of global and local flexibility indices and weak spots. In parallel, an interactive 3D protein structure (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1B</ref>) is visualized in PyMOL in terms of states corresponding to the steps of the thermal unfolding trajectory. The trajectory can be played as an interactive movie and is linked with the flexibility indices by annotations in the plots. Clicking either the plots or the structure changes the appearance of both to focus on the selected residue and/or the corresponding unfolding state. Constraints are grouped by their associated rigid cluster or flexible region to aid visualization and selection. Constraints about to break in a given state are grouped, too, facilitating the identification of residues that could be mutated to stabilize these. The Modify panel contains several ways to modify the constraint network of the protein, which is useful when modeling the effect of ligands, ions or non-standard residues. An interactive table of constraints uses check boxes to enable or disable constraints, and a search box allows navigation. User defined constraints can be added by specifying atom pairs in text fields or the 3D structure. The Mutate panel is central to the interactive protein engineering capability of VisualCNA. After loading an alignment of multiple sequences, the residue conservation and substitution frequencies are calculated for each residue. Clicking a bar in the conservation plot and a mutation in the substitution frequency plot then mutates the corresponding residue and updates the constraint network. The mutation is done using the PyMOL mutation tool, which allows the user to select an appropriate rotamer for the mutant. The new structure can be automatically submitted for unfolding simulation and compared with the wild-type. In this way, the effect of point mutations can be iteratively analyzed to optimize the protein structure toward increased thermostability (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1A</ref>). In summary, the CNA approach derives maximal advantage from information on biomolecular flexibility by linking results from rigidity analyses to relevant structural characteristics. With VisualCNA, an intuitive, easy-to-use graphical interface is available that makes CNA studies amenable to non-bioinformaticians interested in rigidity analysis of biomolecules and interactive protein engineering.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig.1.</head><figDesc>Fig. 1.

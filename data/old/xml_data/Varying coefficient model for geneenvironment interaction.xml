				<p>Motivation: The genetic basis of complex traits often involves the function of multiple genetic factors, their interactions and the interaction between the genetic and environmental factors. Gene– environment (G×E) interaction is considered pivotal in determining trait variations and susceptibility of many genetic disorders such as neurodegenerative diseases or mental disorders. Regression-based methods assuming a linear relationship between a disease response and the genetic and environmental factors as well as their interaction is the commonly used approach in detecting G×E interaction. The linearity assumption, however, could be easily violated due to non-linear genetic penetrance which induces non-linear G×E interaction. Results: In this work, we propose to relax the linear G×E assumption and allow for non-linear G×E interaction under a varying coefficient model framework. We propose to estimate the varying coefficients with regression spline technique. The model allows one to assess the non-linear penetrance of a genetic variant under different environmental stimuli, therefore help us to gain novel insights into the etiology of a complex disease. Several statistical tests are proposed for a complete dissection of G×E interaction. A wild bootstrap method is adopted to assess the statistical significance. Both simulation and real data analysis demonstrate the power and utility of the proposed method. Our method provides a powerful and testable framework for assessing non-linear G×E interaction.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The genetic basis of a complex trait often involves multiple genetic factors functioning in a coordinated manner. The extent on how our genetic blueprint expresses also depends on the interactions between genetic and environmental factors. Increasing evidences have shown that gene–environment (G×E) interactions play pivotal roles in determining the risk of diseases, for instance, the psychiatric diseases (reviewed in<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Caspi and Moffitt, 2006</ref>), the neurodegenerative and * To whom correspondence should be addressed. cardiovascular diseases (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Costa and Eaton, 2006</ref>), and cancer (<ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Ulrich et al., 1999</ref>). Due to the complex nature of the form and mechanism of G×E interaction in different living organisms, hunting down the molecular machinery of G×E interaction has been a daunting task in the post-genomic era. There is a pressing need in developing efficient and powerful statistical methods for a rigorous investigation of G×E interaction. G×E interaction refers to how genotypes influence phenotypes differently in different environments (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Falconer, 1952</ref>). From a biological point of view, G×E interaction can be better viewed as the genetic responses to environment changes or stresses (<ref type="bibr">Hoffmann and Parsons,1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">McClintock, 1984</ref>). In a typical G×E interaction study design, environment is often defined as different conditions coded as a discrete variable in a statistical model. For example, in a study of G×E interaction related to lung cancer, smoking status can be defined as an environment condition coded as 1 (smoking) or 0 (no smoking). In many other studies, the environment condition is defined as a continuous measure. For one example, studies show that ∼80% of type II diabetes and 70% of cardiovascular disease are related to obesity [defined by body mass index (BMI)]. To track down genetic factors responsible for diabetes or cardiovascular disease, obesity can be defined as an environment factor that may induce or reduce the expression of particular genes to affect the disease status. The contribution of the same gene to a disease status may be largely different under different BMI levels. As another example, the peak bone mineral density (BMD) in adulthood varies a lot across different age groups. The amount of nutrition intake (e.g. vitamin D) is also an important environment factor influencing the variation of BMD (<ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Peacock et al., 2002</ref>). Individuals carrying the same gene may respond differently to the rate of density decrease as they get older. Also the peak BMD measure may vary a lot across groups with different nutrition intake, potentially due to the interaction of specific genes with the amount of nutrition intake (e.g. vitamin D). Statistical methods for testing G×E interaction can be broadly categorized into two areas: the model-based method, either parametrically, non-parametrically or semi-parametrically (e.g.<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Chatterjee and Carroll 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Guo 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Kraft et al.,. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Maity et al.,. 2009</ref>), and the model-free method such as the multifactor dimensionality reduction method (<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hahn et al., 2003</ref>). In a modelbased regression framework, traditional parametric methods need strong model assumptions such as assuming linear G×E interactionPage: 2120 2119–2126</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>S.Ma et al.</head><p>as given in model (1). This assumption, however, could be easily violated due to the underlying nonlinear machinery between the genetic and environment factors. Mis-specification in parametric models could lead to large bias. Non-parametric modeling as an alternative way reduces modeling bias by imposing no specific model structure and enables people to explore the data more flexibly at the cost of interpretability. The information about the relationship between the dependent and independent variables from the estimates is often difficult to interpret. Moreover, the variances of the resulting estimates tend to be unacceptably large when the dimension of the covariates is high, which is the so-called 'curse of dimensionality'. To overcome these difficulties, many different semi-parametric models have been proposed and developed, among which varying coefficient (VC) models have gained considerable attention in recent years and are becoming very popular in data analysis, see for example, the work of<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Cleveland et al. (1991)</ref>, Hastie and Tibshirani (1993),<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hoover et al. (1998)</ref>, Fan and Zhang (1999),<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Cai et al. (2000)</ref>, Fan and Zhang (2000),<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Huang et al. (2004)</ref>among others. VC models as natural extensions of linear models allow the coefficients to change smoothly with the value of other variables so that one can explore dynamic feature of datasets successfully with good interpretability and flexibility. See Fan and Zhang (2008) for a detailed review. In this article, we apply varying coefficient models to investigate G×E interactions. In G×E interaction problems, one is interested in understanding how genes respond differently across different environment conditions in determining the variation of a trait or the risk of a disease. We focus our attention to environment conditions measured on a continuous scale. From a statistical point of view, 'interaction' is typically modeled as a product term. A simple model to detect interaction would be a simple linear regression model with the form</p><formula>Y = α 0 +α 1 X +β 1 G+β 2 XG+ε,</formula><formula>(1)</formula><p>where Y is the phenotypic response; α 0 is the overall mean; α 1 and β 1 are the effects of the environment (X) and genetic (G) variables, respectively; β 2 is the effect for G×E interaction; and ε is the error term with mean 0 and variance σ 2. A simple rearrangement of model (1 ) leads to</p><formula>Y = α 0 +α 1 X +(β 1 +β 2 X)G+ε.</formula><formula>(2)</formula><p>With this representation, it is clear that the contribution of a gene to the variation of a phenotype Y is restricted to a linear function in X. The form and pattern of the responses are typically unknown and may not follow a linear relationship as described in model (1). In addressing the limitation of the linear model assumption in dissecting the role of a gene under different environment conditions, one can relax the linearity assumption of G×E interaction and allow for a non-linear interaction by replacing the linear G×E interaction coefficient β 1 +β 2 X in model (2) by a smooth non-linear function β(X) and apply a VC model to detect non-linear G×E interaction. A VC model has the form</p><formula>Y = α (X )+β (X )G+σ (X )ε, (3)</formula><p>for given covariates (X,G ) T and the response Y with E (ε|X,G ) = 0 and Var (ε|X,G ) = 1. β (X ) is a smoothing function in X and σ 2 (X ) =Var (Y |X,G ) is the conditional variance function. Under the VC modeling framework, the effect of a gene is allowed to vary as a function of environmental factors, either linearly or non-linearly, captured by the model itself. Thus, the VC model has the potential to dissect the non-linear penetrance of genetic variants. Methods for the estimation of VC models have flourished in the literature, which can be grouped into three categories. One is local polynomial kernel smoothing, see Fan and Zhang (1999), Xia and Li (1999) and<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Cai et al. (2000)</ref>. One is spline-based method, see<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Huang et al. (2004)</ref>for polynomial spline, and<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hoover et al. (1998) and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chiang et al. (2001)</ref>for smoothing spline. The last one is wavelet estimation, see Zhou and You (2004). In this work, we adopt the polynomial spline approach in<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Huang et al. (2004)</ref>to estimate the coefficient functions β(·) for several major reasons. First, the coefficient functions are approximated by a linear combination of B-spline basis functions, which provides a simple global solution to estimation and inference for VC models, and great flexibility is achieved by using different basis expansions for approximating different coefficient functions, which are stated in<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Huang et al. (2004)</ref>. Secondly, because of its global nature in computation, B-splines are computationally expedient compared with kernelbased methods, which is much necessary for analyzing highdimensional genetic data with hundreds of thousands of markers. Moreover, it is theoretically reliable guarded by the asymptotic consistency and normality property of the spline estimator β (· ), see<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Huang et al. (2004)</ref>. Besides estimation, to test whether the coefficient function of β (X ) in model (3) is significantly different from zero or a constant or has a presumed parametric form is also of our interest. Because of the distribution-free nature of semi-parametric models, the likelihood ratio test for traditional parametric models cannot be applied. We adopt the wild bootstrapping approach as in<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Härdle and Mammen (1993)</ref>to assess the significance of the tests. The integrated squared difference between the parametric and the nonparametric functional estimates is used as a test statistic, and the critical value is determined by the bootstrap method described in Härdle and Mammen (1993). The article is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the methodology of applying VC models to genetic data to detect G×E interaction. We introduce the B-spline fitting technique and its necessary notations. We introduce the test statistics for the hypothesis testing evaluated by the wild bootstrap strategy. In Section 3, we study the finite sample properties of the proposed procedure using the simulated example. Furthermore, the utility of the method is illustrated through the analysis of a real dataset detailed in Section 4, followed by the discussion in Section 5.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">A two-parameter VC model</head><p>In model (3), we only consider the additive effect of a genetic variant. In real life, we do not know the true gene action mode, hence a more flexible model is to consider both additive and dominance penetrance effects. We assume a continuous response variable Y which is a function of an environment variable X and the additive and dominance scales G 1 and G 2 of a genetic factor. Each genetic factor has three possible genotype categories represented by AA, Aa and aa. The three genotype categories can be coded as 1, 0 and −1 for the additive scale G 1 , and as −1/2, 1/2 and −1/2 for the dominance scale G 2 , corresponding to genotypes AA, Aa and aa, respectively. We assume allele A is the minor allele with Page: 2121 2119–2126</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Varying coefficient model for G×E interaction</head><p>its frequency represented by p A. We model the coefficients of G 1 ∈ (1,0,−1 ) and G 2 ∈ (−1/2,1/2,−1/2 ) for each genetic factor as smooth functions of the environment variable X. Since our major interests are the estimation and inference about the coefficient functions for G 1 and G 2 , for simplicity we impose a linear structure on the intercept function α (X ) defined in model (3) by letting α (X ) = α 0 +α 1 X, although a non-parametric smooth function can also be fitted. Thus, the redefined VC model is given as</p><formula>Y = α 0 +α 1 X +β 1 (X )G 1 +β 2 (X )G 2 +σ (X )ε, (4) for given covariates (X,G 1 ,G 2 ), with E (ε|X,G 1 ,G 2 ) = 0, Var (ε|X,G 1 ,G 2 ) = 1</formula><p>and the conditional mean function of Y given</p><formula>X, G 1 and G 2 is E (Y |X,G 1 ,G 2 ) = m (X,G 1 ,G 2 ) = α 0 +α 1 (X )+ β 1 (X )G 1 +β 2 (X )G 2 .</formula><p>The same model is fitted separately for each marker, followed by multiple testing corrections. The two-parameter model given in (4) is not only biologically more meaningful than the one-parameter model given in (3), but also statistically attractive since it is invariant to allele coding (i.e. whether code AA as 1 or code aa as 1 for variable G 1 ).</p><formula>β 1 (X ) = β 1 +β 3 X, and β 2 (X ) = β 2 +β 4 X, where β 1 , β 2 , β 3 and β</formula><p>4 are constants, model (4) can be written as</p><formula>Y = α 0 +α 1 X +β 1 G 1 +β 2 G 2 +β 3 XG 1 +β 4 XG 2 +σ(X)ε, (5)</formula><p>which is a linear regression model with main effects for X and (G 1 ,G 2 ) as well as their interaction effects (denoted hereafter as LM-I). If we assume a homogeneous residual variance, this is the commonly applied linear regression model for testing G×E interaction which reduces to model (1) if only additive effect is considered. If we impose a constant structure on β 1 (X) and β 2 (X), i.e. β 1 (X) = β 1 and β 2 (X) = β 2 , then model (4) is reduced to</p><formula>Y = α 0 +α 1 X +β 1 G 1 +β 2 G 2 +σ(X)ε,</formula><formula>(6)</formula><p>which is a linear regression model without the interaction terms (denoted hereafter as LM). Therefore, the traditional linear regression model for testing G×E interaction is a special case of model (4). Although, their properties are very well established, the conventional parametric approaches are infeasible in this case, since the functional forms of β 1 (· ) and β 2 (· ) are unknown to us due to the complexity of the underlying interaction mechanism. Any misspecification of the model would lead to uncertainty estimates and low power (see<ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref><ref type="bibr">[a,b ]</ref>.

For the superiority of T n over other goodness-offit tests, see the discussion in<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Härdle and Mammen (1993)</ref>. The authors pointed out that a way of computing critical values could possibly be based on resampling from the entire dataset. However, it was shown that this bootstrapping method (the classical bootstrap) failed, since the bootstrapped statistic does not have the same limit behavior. Thus, a new variant of the bootstrap method called wild bootstrap was proposed, which is adopted in this work. For the i-th observation, recall that</p><formula>m R (X i ,G 1i ,G 2i ) and m F (X i ,G 1i ,G 2i ) are the estimators of m (X i ,G 1i ,G 2i ) for</formula><p>the reduced and full model, respectively.

By simple calculation, we obtain that E (ε * i |X i ,G 1i ,G 2i ) = 0, E (ε * 2 i |X i ,G 1i ,G 2i ) = ε 2 i and E (ε * 3 i |X i ,G 1i ,G 2i ) = ε 3 i. Then we use (X i ,G 1i ,G 2i ,Y * i = m R (X i ,G 1i ,G 2i )+ε * i )</formula><p>as bootstrap observations and create T * ,W like T n by the squared deviation between the coefficient estimators under H 0 and H 1.

For a given genetic effect and a heritability level, σ(X i ) varies for different X i , and detailed calculation can be found in the following sections.

These spline coefficients were calculated from Equation (7) based on SNP 22 265 753 from a real dataset (<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>). The reason we generated β(X) this way is to mimic real data, even though we could generate β(X) from a parametric function such as a sin or a polynomial function. The variance function σ 2 (x ) was obtained by solving</p><formula>H 2 = V G /(V G + V E ), where H 2 is the heritability level; V G (x ) =β 2 1 (x )var (G 1 ) +β 2 2 (x )var (G 2 ) +2β 1 (x )β 2 (x )cov (G 1 ,G 2 )</formula><p>is the genetic variance in which var (</p><formula>G 1 ) = 2p A (1−p A ), var (G 2 ) = 1/4{1− (2p A −1 ) 4 }, and cov (G 1 ,G 2 ) = 2p A (1−p A ) (2p A −1 ); and V E = σ 2 (x). Simple algebra shows that H 2 =[1+σ 2 (x )/V G (x )] −1 , which gives σ 2 (x ) = (1/H 2 −1 )V G (x )</formula><p>. Assuming different heritability levels, i.e. H 2 = 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, the phenotype Y i can be generated assuming ε i ∼ N(0,1). As can be seen that the genetic variance is a function of the MAF, so does for the residual variance σ(X).</p><p>For a fixed MAF, the residual variance decreases as the heritability increases. Thus, we expect high power under high H 2 value. However, due to the way we defined the calculation of V G , it is no longer true that σ(X) decreases as the MAF increases for a fixed H 2 level. So the power no longer monotonically increases with the increase of the MAF as usually assumed in human genetic association studies. Based on the estimated frequency (p A = 0.08) of the SNP from the real data, we fixed the allele frequency and evaluated the power performance of the three methods under different heritability levels. Empirical power was recorded based on 1000 simulation repetitions, each with 10 000 bootstrapped samples.<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>shows that the testing power increases as the sample size n and heritability level H 2 increase for the three models. For a fixed genetic effect, large heritability level leads to small residual variance, and consequently leads to increased power. It is clear that the VC model outperforms the other two models in all cases. Since the linear model with interaction (LM-I) is closer to the VC model in structure, it achieves higher power than the linear model without interaction (LM). The simulation results indicate that when the nature of the G×E interaction is non-linear, i.e. when a variant shows a strong non-linear penetrance effect, a mis-specification of an analytical model assuming a linear structure suffers tremendously from power loss. We also evaluated the performance of the VC model when the underlying true interaction follows a linear structure or no interaction at all. False positive control of the methods were also studied (see Supplementary Material). Here, we provide a summary of<ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>. The power plot under different sample sizes and heritability levels for the three methods. Data were generated with the VC model and were analyzed with the VC, LM and LM-I models. the simulation: (i) when the underlying true interaction model is non-linear, the proposed VC model has the highest power among the three. The other two parametric linear models suffer tremendously from power loss (<ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>); (ii) when the underlying true model is linear with or without interaction, the linear model assuming interaction or no interaction has the best power. However, as the sample size and heritability level increase, the power difference between the VC model and the other two decreases significantly; and (iii) in real data analysis, the VC model cannot substitute the other two models before we know the true functional effect. We can first do a hypothesis testing to check if the coefficient functions β k (X), k = 1,2, are constant or linear in X, then apply the optimal model in the analysis. The non-linear VC model would be the choice if the constant or linear function is rejected. Otherwise, a linear model is suggested, especially when sample size is small.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">REAL DATA ANALYSIS</head><p>We applied the method to a real dataset which contains 1536 new born babies, recruited through the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Sotero del Rio Hospital in Puente Alto, Chile. Total 648 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) covering 189 unique genes were analyzed after eliminating SNPs with MAF &lt;0.05 and those departure from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. When fitting to the VC model, we found that the spline design matrix could be singular when there are extremely unbalanced genotype distributions, especially when only two genotypes categories were present for an SNP. Thus, we eliminated additional 143 SNPs and only 505 SNPs were included in our analysis. (Note that the 143 SNPs can also be analyzed by fitting a one-parameter VC model assuming only additive effect. To demonstrate the model application, we omitted the results of the 143 SNPs.) Phenotypes were initially dichotomized as small for gestational age (SGA) or large for gestational age (LGA) depending on the babies' birth weight and the mother's gestational age. The initial study were designed to identify genetic risk factors associated with SGA or LGA. We took the original birth weight (kg) measure as the response and merged the two datasets together to form one dataset for an analysis. It is postulated that baby's birth weight might be related to mother's body mass index (MBMI). When a baby resides inside of its mother's womb, the environmental conditions are defined through its mother, for instance, mother's age and obesity condition (measured by MBMI). Under different environmental stimuli (e.g.MBMI), fetus carrying the same genes might trigger different responses, consequently leading to different birth weights. This is due to the complex interaction between a mother's obesity condition and fetus' genes. With the combined data, we were interested in identifying genetic factors that can explain the normal variation of birth weight, and if any, influenced by MBMI. The results were tabulated in<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>. Additional information for real data analysis can be found in Supplementary Material. The first three columns list the SNP ID, the gene and location each SNP belongs to. When we applied the FDR control method (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</ref>), only two SNP showed statistical significance (indicated by * in<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>). To illustrate the method, we also listed SNPs with P-values that are &lt;0.005. The P-values for the overall genetic effect tests, i.e. H 0 : β 1 (· ) = β 2 (· ) = 0, are given in the column denoted by P_VC, P_LM and P_LMi when fitting the data with the VC, LM and LM-I models, respectively. The upper panel shows the results with the VC model fit. Testing constant coefficients (H VC 0 ) indicates that the function of these SNPs does vary across MBMI (P_const&lt;0.05). Further tests (H L 0 ) show that the function of these SNPs do not follow a linear structure either. Therefore, it is not surprising that the P-values obtained with the VC model are all smaller than the ones obtained by fitting the LM and LM-I models. SNPs with P &lt; 0.005 when fitting the LM model are listed in the middle panel of the table. Testing results show that the coefficients of these three SNPs do not vary across MBMI (P_const&gt; 0.05). Thus, we observed the smallest P-values for the three SNPs when they were fitted with the LM model. The bottom panel lists six SNPs when the best fitting model is the LM-I model (P_LMi&lt; 0.005). As a result, the smallest P-values were observed for the six SNPs when fitted with the LM-I model. Testing linear interaction indicates that the six SNPs do have strong interaction effects (P_i&lt;0.05). In summary, the real data analysis results are consistent with the simulation results in which optimal P-value is always obtained by fitting the data with the 'true' model. If we only fit the data with a linear model with or without interaction, we could potentially miss the ones detected by the VC model.</p></div>

The three curves correspond to the fitted BW for three different genotypes. The sample mean is indicated by the dashed straight line. The minor allele for this SNP is T and the estimated MAF is 0.1. From the fitted plot, we can see the non-linear interaction effect between this SNP and MBMI on infant's birth weight. When MBMI is low, infants carrying genotype CC have low birth weight, but not for those carrying the other two types of genotype. As MBMI increases, mother's body size has a positive effect on infant's birth weight, so we saw a slightly increasing trend for infant birth weight. However, infants carrying different genotypes show a clearly different response pattern on birth weight corresponding to the increase of MBMI. For example, infants carrying genotype TT show a sharp increase in their body weight compared with other two genotypes as MBMI passing 25. So mother's obesity condition triggers a stronger effect on TT genotypes than the other two genotypes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">DISCUSSION</head><p>The natural variation of a quantitative phenotype is not only determined by the inherited genetic factors, but also can be explained by how sensitive a genetic factor responds to environmental stimuli. Gene–environment interaction, the genetic control of sensitivity to environment, plays a pivotal role in determining trait variations. In humans, most diseases results from a complex interaction between an individual's genetic blueprint and the associated environmental condition. For example, type II diabetes and cardiovascular disease are often due to the complex interaction between an individual's genes and obesity condition. The more we learn about how genes interact with environment in determining trait variations and disease risks, the more we can achieve in prevention and treatment of illnesses.</p><p>The importance of G×E interaction in human disease has been historically recognized (e.g.<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Costa and Eaton, 2006</ref>). Many statistical methods have been proposed to target G×E interaction. In this work, we relaxed the linear G×E interaction assumption, and proposed a new method considering non-linear G×E interaction. We focused our attention on environment with continuous measurement (e.g. dietary intake, obesity condition and the amount of addictive substances). We adopted the well-known VC model into a genetic mapping framework and proposed to estimate the functional coefficient by the non-parametric B-spline technique. The superior performance of the VC model in detecting non-linear G×E interaction has been demonstrated with extensive Monte Carlo simulations. When the genetic contribution to the variation of a phenotype varies largely across environmental conditions, the proposed VC model achieves the optimal power compared with models assuming constant or linear coefficient. Although in theory, the B-spline estimator converges to the true underlying function, depending on various factors, the VC model may not achieve the optimal power when the true function is constant or linear. In real data analysis, often the heritability level is unknown before we fit a model. Thus, it is necessary to conduct a hypothesis test to assess the true underlying functional coefficient. Based on the results from simulation and real data analysis, we conclude that the VC model cannot completely substitute the linear parametric model in G×E analysis. Our practical recommendation is to do a hypothesis test first to assess the function of the coefficients, then fit the appropriate model. In many cases, linear or constant coefficients are preferred, and a linear model can be fitted. Noted that the estimation of the varying coefficients is essentially a least-squares problem, hence is computationally fast. The computational cost comes with the wild bootstrap procedure to assess the significance of the coefficients. By first assessing the function of the coefficients, we could save computation time dramatically. We applied the method to a real dataset to identify genetic factors interacting with mother's MBI to explain the normal variation of baby's birth weight. We adopted a two-parameter model which is biologically more attractive than a one-parameter model. We found a few SNPs showing non-linear penetrance across different environmental stimuli (i.e. different MBMI levels) (<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>). Even though only two SNPs showed statistical significance after multiple testing adjustments following the FDR procedure (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</ref>), we still found a few others with relatively strong signals (P&lt;0.005). In checking the function of the SNPs, some of those are growth factors that are directly related to fetal growth, for example, platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGFB) and fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF4). FGF4 is essential for mammalian embryogenesis and fetal growth (<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Lamb and Rizzino, 1998</ref>). SNP 634043245 in exon 3 located in FGF4 was also identified by a different model showing a strong dominance effect on small for gestational age along with maternal body weight when searching for genetic conflict effect (<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Li et al., 2009</ref>). Like many other statistical methods in association analysis, genotyping errors and missing data are certainly obvious issues as pointed out by one referee. In the current analysis, we focused on the model in a general setting. These issues need to be evaluated with extensive simulations and will be considered in our future work. In addition to these two issues, our method does not apply to rare variants either. Further model development is needed to take rare variants into consideration.

In this study, we focused on a continuous quantitative phenotype. Extension to other types of phenotype such as a binary disease phenotype is straightforward. A generalized linear model can be adopted with appropriately chosen link function. However, the estimation and inference procedure developed in this work cannot be directly applied. Such investigation will be considered in our future work.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><figDesc>[17:51 6/7/2011 Bioinformatics-btr318.tex]</figDesc></figure>

In this article, we apply the B-spline smoothing technique to estimate β 1 (· ) and β 2 (·), which solves only one least squares problem to get the estimators.

<figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_5"><head></head><figDesc>Figure 2B plots the heritability estimation under different mother's BMI conditions. The plot also shows the non-linear penetrance of the variant under different MBMI conditions. Strong penetrance effects (corresponding to large H 2 values) are observed when MBMI is between 25 and 30. The genetic effect (penetrance) tends to stabilize when MBMI reaches 35. This result fits to our intuition as we do not expect a fetus grow unlimited when mother's body size increases. If the phenotype of interest is a disease status measurement, prevention efforts should be geared toward those environment conditions corresponding to large heritability estimate. The spline estimators β k (· ) of the coefficient functions β k (· ), k = 1,2 are plotted in Figure 2C and D. It is clearly seen that β k (x ), k = 1,2, does vary across MBMI. The additive effect β 1 (X) shows a quadratic pattern and levels off as MBMI passes 33. This implies that the additive effect of this SNP variant approaches a limit for obese mothers (MBMI&gt; 33), so does for the dominance effect but with a more varying pattern of effect under low MBMI. Due to the non-linear penetrance effect of this SNP under different environment stimuli (measured by mother's obese condition), this SNP could be missed if we fitted the data with the traditional linear interaction model. This example demonstrates the advantage of the VC model in the identification of important genetic variants with non-linear penetrance under different environment stimuli.</figDesc></figure>

				<p>Motivation: Runs of homozygosity (ROH) are sizable chromosomal stretches of homozygous genotypes, ranging in length from tens of kilobases to megabases. ROHs can be relevant for population and medical genetics, playing a role in predisposition to both rare and common disorders. ROHs are commonly detected by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarrays, but attempts have been made to use whole-exome sequencing (WES) data. Currently available methods developed for the analysis of uniformly spaced SNP-array maps do not fit easily to the analysis of the sparse and non-uniform distribution of the WES target design. Results: To meet the need of an approach specifically tailored to WES data, we developed H 3 M 2 , an original algorithm based on heterogeneous hidden Markov model that incorporates inter-marker distances to detect ROH from WES data. We evaluated the performance of H 3 M 2 to correctly identify ROHs on synthetic chromosomes and examined its accuracy in detecting ROHs of different length (short, medium and long) from real 1000 genomes project data. H 3 M 2 turned out to be more accurate than GERMLINE and PLINK, two state-of-the-art algorithms, especially in the detection of short and medium ROHs. Availability and implementation: H 3 M 2 is a collection of bash, R and Fortran scripts and codes and is freely available at https://sourceforge. net/projects/h3m2/.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Runs of homozygosity (ROH) are chromosomal stretches that in a diploid genome appear in the homozygous state, that is, display identical alleles at multiple contiguous loci. The study of ROH can be relevant for both population and medical genetics. Genomic ROH patterns are governed by a number of factors, among which population genetic history (e.g. historical bottleneck, geographic isolation and population size), evolutionary forces (e.g. selective sweeps) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Sabeti et al., 2007</ref>) and cultural habits or historical and geographical factors. Recent parental relatedness favors the formation of long ROH (several megabases) that occur because of IBD (identity by descent, when the two alleles at a locus match because they originate from the same common ancestor), as opposed to identity by state (when the two alleles at a locus match simply by coincidence). Homozygosity originating from the occurrence of individual IBD regions owing to parental relatedness (autozygosity) is known to possibly contain recessive highly penetrant deleterious disease-causing mutations surrounded by an unusually long homozygous haplotype. This is the principle that inspired homozygosity mapping in the study of rare recessive disorders affecting inbred individuals (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Lander and Botstein, 1987</ref>). In outbred individuals, short (up to few hundreds of kilobases) or mediumsized ROH (from hundreds of kilobases to a few megabases) can surround disease-causing mutations as well (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Hildebrandt et al., 2009</ref>), playing a role in predisposition to disease through the effect of mildly deleterious recessive variants (<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Wang et al., 2009</ref>). To date, ROH detection has been achieved by microarraybased technologies. Currently available single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-array platforms contain millions of markers from the HapMap Project (<ref type="bibr">International HapMap Consortium, 2003</ref>) and have a mean SNP-to-SNP distance of around 3 kb. The past few years have seen the emergence of several next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms that are capable to sequence a full human genome per week at a cost 400-fold less than the previous methods. The advent of NGS platforms has revolutionized our ability of studying human genetic variation (<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Wang et al., 2009</ref>) allowing the achievement of large-scale re-sequencing projects, such as the 1000 Genomes Project (1000GP) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">1000</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Genomes Project Consortium et al., 2010</ref>) and the Cancer Genome Atlas (www.cancergenome.nih.gov). Recently, the 1000GP consortium, by combining low-coverage whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and high-coverage whole-exome sequencing (WES) of 1092 individuals from 14 populations, has genotyped $38 million single nucleotide polymorphic positions (1000 Genomes<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Project Consortium et al., 2012</ref>). This provided a genetic map characterized by a mean SNP-to-SNP distance of 73 bp and with475% of the inter-marker distances under 200 bp. This catalog captures up to 98% of accessible SNPs with minor allele frequency of !1%. *To whom correspondence should be addressed. At present, the cost and the computational complexity still limit the routine use of WGS and make WES an effective alternative that has been successfully used for the discovery of single-nucleotide variants (<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Ng et al., 2009</ref>), short indels and copy number variants (<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Magi et al., 2013</ref>) and that can be applied to the detection of ROH (<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Pippucci et al., 2011</ref>). However, the sparse nature of the WES target design makes this latter application challenging. The distance between adjacent 1000GP exomic SNPs ranges from 1 bp to 26 Mb (with an average value of around 500 bp), and consequently, large ROH may be covered by few and not uniformly spaced SNPs, whereas small and isolated ROH may display exceptionally high marker density. Currently available sliding-window methods, such as PLINK (<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Purcell et al., 2007</ref>) or GERMLINE (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Gusev et al., 2009</ref>), were developed for the analysis of uniformly spaced SNP-array maps and do not fit easily to the analysis of the sparse and non-uniform distribution of WES SNP maps. The identification of long ROH, typically those detected in a context of consanguinity, may be faced by applying these methods to WES data (<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Pippucci et al., 2011</ref>). However, medium or short ROH cannot be as easily captured from WES data by using traditional sliding-windows approaches. To meet the need of an approach specifically tailored to WES data, which could overcome the inherent limitations of currently available tools, we developed a novel computational approach [homozygosity heterogeneous hidden Markov model (HMM),</p><formula>H 3 M 2 ]</formula><p>for the identification of ROH. The algorithm is based on a heterogeneous HMM that, incorporating the distance between consecutive polymorphic positions into the transition probabilities matrix, is able to detect with high sensitivity and specificity ROH of every genomic size. The key feature of the algorithm is its heterogeneity, which makes it well-suited for WES data. To evaluate the capability of this novel method to detect ROH of different sizes, we applied it to the analysis of a synthetic dataset and compared its performance with that of PLINK and GERMLINE on real WES data. Another method for homozygosity IBD detection from sequences based on a HMM algorithm, IBDseq, has recently been reported (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Browning and Browning, 2013</ref>). We did not compare H 3 M 2 with IBDseq because this latter method is conceived explicitly for genome sequences and has never been applied to WES data. As a whole, the results we obtained in these analyses demonstrated that H 3 M 2 has the potentiality to capture most of the genomic ROH that overlap regions covered by exomic targets, and that it outperforms the existing algorithms especially in the detection of medium and short ROH.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">B-allele frequencies</head><p>As a measure of the homozygous/heterozygous genotype state of each polymorphic position i, we adopted the B-allele frequency (BAF). BAF i is defined as the ratio between B-allele counts (N B , the number of reads that match with the 1000GP alternate allele at position i) and the total number of reads mapped to that position (N, the depth of coverage):</p><formula>BAF i = N B N ð1Þ</formula><p>BAF i may thus assume values that belong to the interval<ref type="bibr">[0,</ref><ref type="bibr">1]</ref>: when BAF i = 0, all the reads aligned to position i match with the major allele; when BAF i = 1, all the reads match with the minor allele; and when BAF i 6 ¼ 0; 1, some reads match with the major allele, whereas some others match with the minor allele (see Supplementary Methods). It follows that BAF i can predict the homozygous/heterozygous genotype state of each polymorphic position i: when BAF i % 0, the polymorphic position is homozygous reference; when BAF i % 0:5, the polymorphic position is heterozygous; and when BAF i % 1, the polymorphic position is homozygous alternate. To the scope of the present work, the use of the BAF measure has some advantages compared with that of NGS genotype calls. First, BAF calculation does not require computationally intensive steps like binary sequence alignment/map (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Li et al., 2009</ref>) file realignment and recalibration, which are widely adopted to improve reliability of variant calls. Second, genotype calling is usually performed for variant sites only, thereby an additional genotype calling step would be needed to cover also non-variant sites.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Map construction</head><p>To create a map of exomic SNPs, we included all the polymorphic positions discovered by 1000 Genomes Project Consortium (2012) falling into the range of the 1000GP exomic target regions (downloaded at http://www.1000genomes.org/) plus 1000 bp of sequences flanking both sides of each target region. As a result of this procedure, we selected 4 163 299 SNPs: the distance between adjacent SNPs ranged from 1 bp to 22 Mb with mean and median values of 47 and 686 bp, respectively, (and !75% of the distances under 110 bp).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">H 3 M 2 model and algorithm</head><p>To identify homozygous DNA segments, we decided to model BAF data by means of a discrete state HMM with continuous output. A discrete HMM with continuous output is characterized by the following elements:</p><p>The number of hidden states, K, in the model. The states are denoted as S=fS 1 ; :::; S K g while q i denotes the actual state at position i (1 i n).The emission probability distributions b k ðiÞ, that is, the probability of observing O i at position i given the state S k :</p><formula>b k ðiÞ=P½O i jq i =S k .</formula><p>The transition matrix, A, giving the probability of moving from one state to another, A lm =Pðq i+1 =S m jq i =S l Þ for 1 i n À 1 and 1 l; m K.</p><p>To model our problem, we used a two-state HMM (K = 2) where the hidden states represent non-homozygous (S 1 =non À Hom) and homozygous (S 2 =Hom) states of the genome, and the observations are the BAF values at each polymorphic position i (BAF i ). The emission distributions are mixture of truncated Gaussian density with the following form:</p><formula>PðBAF i jq i =S 1 Þ=c 1 g u l ðBAF i ; 1 Þ+c 2 g u l ðBAF i ; 2 Þ+c 3 g u l ðBAF i ; 3 Þ PðBAF i jq i =S 2 Þ=c 1 g u l ðBAF i ; 1 Þ+c 3 g u l ðBAF i ; 3 Þ</formula><p>where c k is the proportion of the k-th component in the mixture withthe means and the variances of the three truncated Gaussians. The lower and upper bounds are l = 0 and u = 1 for the three truncated Gaussians. F is a parameter used to modulate the spread of the two truncated Gaussian distributions with mean 1 =0 and 3 =1. F can take values in the range ½1; 1, and the larger is its value the larger is the probability to include in homozygous regions BAF values that strongly deviate from 0 and 1. In practice, the parameter F allows our model to recognize ROH taking into account sequencing and alignment errors that, in complex regions of the genome, could generate BAF values that belong to the g 2 distribution (heterozygous state). The expression of a truncated Gaussian density g with lower bound l and upper bound u can be easily derived from the density of a non-truncated Gaussian: g u l ðBAF i ; Þ= fðBAF i ; Þ Fðu; Þ À Fðl; Þ I u l ðBAF i Þ; ð2Þ where fð; Þ and Fð; Þ represent the density and cumulative distribution functions of a non-truncated Gaussian of parameter =ð; 2 Þ and I u l ðB AF i Þ=1 if BAF i belongs to the interval ½l; u and I u l ðBAF i Þ=0 otherwise. Finally, to take into account the distance between consecutive polymorphic positions d=ðd 1 ; d 2 ; :::; :d nÀ1 Þ, we decided to incorporate them into the transition probabilities matrix A i defined for 1 i n À 1:</p><formula>A i = 1 À p 1 ð1 À e Àfi Þ p 1 ð1 À e Àfi Þ p 2 ð1 À e Àfi Þ 1 À p 2 ð1 À e Àfi Þ ! ð3Þ where p 1 (p 2</formula><p>) represents the probability of moving from State 1 to State 2 (from State 2 to State 1) in the homogeneous HMM, f i =d i =d Norm and d Norm is the distance normalization parameter. The parameter d Norm modulates the effect of genomic distance d i on the transition probabilities: the larger is d Norm the smaller is the probability to jump from one state to another. To estimate the parameters of the heterogeneous HMM, we developed a two-step computational recipe based on expectation-maximization (EM) and Viterbi algorithms. In the first step, we estimate the variances k and the proportions c k of the mixture of three truncated Gaussians, whereas in the second step we estimate the best state sequence (we associate each BAF value to particular states) by using the Viterbi algorithm. The inputs to the algorithm are the sequence of BAF values BAF=ðBAF 1 ; BAF 2 ; ::; BAF N Þ, the distance between consecutive polymorphic positions d=ðd 1 ; d 2 ; :::; :d nÀ1 Þ, the values of the parameters F, p 1 , p 2 and d Norm , and the output are genomic regions with consecutive SNPs in homozygous and heterozygous states. We decided to use the two transition probabilities p 1 and p 2 as algorithm parameters instead of estimating them with an EM algorithm, as we do believe that they can be useful in setting the resolution of our algorithm (the capability of our computational method to detect ROH of different size and with different number of SNPs). To estimate the parameters k and c k of the Gaussian mixture model, we make use of the classical EM algorithm (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Dempster et al., 1977</ref>). In brief, denoting with Z ki the hidden state for BAF i (Z ki is a random variable equal to 1 if BAF i belongs to state k and 0 otherwise), we can define the conditional probabilities ki =PrðZ ki =1jBAF i Þ. The basic ingredient of the EM family of algorithms is the iterative application of an expectation step followed by a likelihood maximization step. EM starts with initial values (c ð0Þ k ; ð0Þ k ) for the parameters and iteratively performs the two steps until convergence. In the E-step, the conditional probabilities ki are computed. Given the parameters estimated at h-th iteration, c ðhÞ k and ðhÞ k =ð ðhÞ k ; ðhÞ k Þ, the conditional probabilities h+1 ki are obtained with the following formula:</p><formula>h+1 ki = c ðhÞ k g u l ðm i ; h k Þ X N i=1 c k g u l ðm i ; l Þ : ð4Þ</formula><p>In the M-step, the proportions of the components in the mixture and the empirical estimators of the mean and the variance are computed. In particular at the iteration ðh+1Þ of the M-step, we compute ðh+1Þ k and c ðh+1Þ k</p><p>with the following formulas:</p><formula>ðh+1Þ k = X N i=1 h+1 ki ðm i À ðh+1Þ k Þ 2 X N i=1 h+1 ki ; ð5Þ c ðh+1Þ k = X N i=1 h+1 ki N : ð6Þ</formula><p>Finally, once all the parameters of the mixture of Gaussians have been estimated, we apply the Viterbi algorithm to find the best state sequence and consequently to associate each BAF value to one of the two (nonhomozygous/homozygous) states, thus identifying ROH.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">BAF properties and distributions</head><p>To evaluate the capability of BAF to predict the homozygous/ heterozygous SNP state, and of BAF profiles to discriminate between homozygous and heterozygous DNA segments, we studied the distribution of BAF values by analyzing WES data of three individuals (NA12878, NA12891 and NA12892) sequenced by the 1000GP consortium and previously genotyped with SNParray technologies by the HapMap consortium (see Supplementary Methods). For each position i of the SNP-map, we compared the BAF value with HapMap genotypes and with genotypes independently generated by SAMtools (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Li et al., 2009</ref>) and the Genome Analysis ToolKit (GATK) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">McKenna et al., 2010</ref>) on WES data (see Supplementary Methods). All the analyses were performed by progressively filtering out SNPs covered less than a defined threshold (5Â, 10Â, 15Â and 20Â). The results of these comparisons are reported in panels a, b and c of<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>and Supplementary<ref type="figure">Figures 1</ref>–3, and clearly show strong correlation between BAF and SNP genotypes calls. The 'Violin Plots' reported in panels a, b and c of<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>illustrate the capability of BAF values to predict the genotype calls made by SAMtools (R = 0.988), GATK (R = 0.993) and SNP-array data (R = 0.99). Moreover, as expected, higher the coverage over the polymorphic position higher the correlation between BAF and genotype calls (Supplementary Figs 1–3). Based on these results, we performed all the downstream analyses by using only SNPs covered ! 10. As a further step, to evaluate the capability of BAF profiles to discriminate between homozygous and non-homozygous regions of the genome, we studied the distributions of BAF in different sets of genomic regions. To this end, we defined as homozygous and non-homozygous gold standard regions, those classified as such by PLINK on HapMap calls (see Supplementary Material). The four sets in which we studied BAF distribution were (i) all the regions of the genome, (ii) the homozygous regions only, (iii) the non-homozygous regions only and (iv) the non-pseudoautosomal X chromosome of male individuals. The results reported in panels d, e, f and g of<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>reveal that the BAF distribution across all the polymorphic positions can be well approximated by a mixture of three truncated normal distributions:</p><formula>g u l ðBAF i ; c; Þ= X 3 k=1 c k g u l ðBAF i ; k Þ; ð7Þ</formula><p>where c k is the proportion of the k-th component in the mixture with</p><formula>X 3 k=1 c k =1 and k =ð k ; k Þ</formula><p>are the means and the variances of the three Gaussians with 1 =0; 2 =0:5 and 3 =1. The lower and upper bounds are l = 0 and u = 1 for the three truncated Gaussians.<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>also shows that in non-homozygous regions (<ref type="figure">Fig. 1e</ref>) c k 6 ¼ 0 for all the three distributions, whereas in homozygous regions (<ref type="figure">Fig. 2f</ref>and g) c 2 =0. Thus, homozygous and non-homozygous regions can be discriminated based on BAF distribution as signature. Genomic regions with BAF values generated by Equation 7 with c 2 6 ¼ 0 can be classified as non-homozygous, whereas genomic regions with BAF values generated by Equation 7 with c 2 =0 can be classified as homozygous.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Synthetic validations</head><p>To test the ability of H 3 M 2 to detect ROH of different sizes and constituted by different number of SNPs as a function of the distance between consecutive markers, we performed an intensive simulation based on synthetic data. To this end, we generated synthetic chromosomes starting from the BAF data of the three samples used in previous section. BAF data from the non-pseudoautosomal X chromosome of the male individual NA12891 were used to simulate homozygous DNA segments, whereas BAF data from the autosomal chromosomes of all the three samples were used to simulate heterozygous segments. Each synthetic chromosome was generated as a stretch of 2000 polymorphic positions in which:</p><p>Homozygous segments were simulated as N consecutive data sampled from the BAF values of the non-pseudoautosomal X chromosomes regions of male individuals.The 1:9 ratio was imposed to simulate at best the actual heterozygous/homozygous proportion and to prevent the emergence of false-positive (FP) homozygous segments. To reproduce the complex architecture and distribution of homozygous and heterozygous WES regions, we generated distances between adjacent SNPs as follows:</p><p>The distances between consecutive SNPs in non-homozygous regions are sampled from the distribution of the distances between adjacent WES polymorphic positions.<ref type="figure">Figure 2b</ref>demonstrates that for values of p 1 40.4 the specificity of our method drastically decreases. In summary, because global performance of H 3 M 2 is a result of the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity, we argue that the best performance can be obtained by setting p 1 =0:1 and p 2 2 ½0:1; 0:3.<ref type="figure">Figure 2c</ref>and d report the results of this analysis as a function of the d Norm parameter and show that d Norm has strong effect on global performance of H 3 M 2 : the larger is d Norm the smaller (larger) is sensitivity (specificity). To study the effect of the parameter F in modulating the capability of H 3 M 2 to tolerate sequencing and alignment errors in the detection of ROH, we built another synthetic dataset. The synthetic chromosomes of this dataset were generated with the same procedure described above, apart from the central SNP of the homozygous stretch. With the purpose of reproducing increasing error rates, BAF values ranging from 0.1 to 0.9 were assigned to the central SNP. We applied H 3 M 2 to this synthetic dataset using different values of the parameter F (F 2 ½1; 20), and the results are reported in the contour plot of<ref type="figure">Figure 2e</ref>. Each point in the plot represents the fraction of times the algorithm detects a unique ROH instead of splitting it in two ROH. These results show that larger F values make H 3 M 2 more tolerant of positions characterized by higher sequencing and alignment error rates that appear to be heterozygous sites: as an example, F = 10 induces the algorithm to include in a homozygous region BAF values as large as 0.35. As a further test, to evaluate the capability of H 3 M 2 to detect ROH of different size and comprising different number of SNPs, we calculated TPR and FPR as follows: a detected ROH is considered a true positive if it has any overlap with a synthetic ROH, whereas it is considered a FP if it has no overlap with a synthetic ROH. These analyses were performed by setting p 2 =0:1; p 1 2 ½0:05; 0:3 and d Norm =ð10 3 ; 10 4 ; 10 5 ; 10 6 Þ. As expected, the results (<ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>) show that the larger the number of SNPs falling within a given ROH the higher the probability to correctly identify the homozygous region. The same holds, considering the distance between adjacent positions (D): the larger D the higher the probability to call the region as homozygous. A detailed analysis of Figures 3a and b reveals that the sensitivity of H 3 M 2 increases with increasing values of the parameter p 1. However, setting p 1 ! 0:1 has little effect on the resolution of</p><formula>H 3 M 2 (i.e.</formula><p>the capability of the algorithm to detect ROH constituted by a small number of SNPs), while it favors the detection of FP events (<ref type="figure">Fig. 3c</ref>). On the other hand, the results of<ref type="figure">Figure 3d</ref>–f show that the parameter d Norm strongly affects the performance of the H 3 M 2 algorithm in terms of both sensitivity and specificity: the smaller d Norm the higher the probability to detect small ROH (ROH characterized by high SNP density) and FP events. The results of these analyses (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Figs</ref></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Real data analysis</head><p>To test the proposed computational pipeline for the identification of homozygous segments on real data, we analyzed the WES data of 15 individuals (five CEU, Utah residents with ancestry from Northern and Western Europe, five JPT, Japanese in Tokyo, and five YRI, Yoruba in Ibadan) sequenced by 1000GP consortium (see Supplementary Methods) by using the following parameter settings: p 2 =0:1; p 1 =½0:1; 0:2; 0:3 and d Norm =½10 3 ; 10 4 ; 10 5 . First, we studied the detected ROH in terms of both cumulative global size and fraction of SNPs within them. As expected (<ref type="figure">Fig. 4a</ref>–f), the larger the value of the parameter p 1 the larger the total size of the detected ROH, and accordingly the larger the total fraction of SNPs within the detected ROH. Conversely, the smaller is d Norm the larger is the total size and the total fraction of SNPs detected by H 3 M 2. By setting the most conservative set of parameters (d Norm =10 5 and p 1 =0:1), H 3 M 2 detected an average of around 160 Mb (10% of SNPs) in the YRI individuals, 330 Mb in the CEU (18% of SNPs) and 380 in the JPT (21% of SNPs), whereas using more inclusive parameters (d Norm =10 3 ; p 1 =0:3), we detected 860 Mb (38% of SNPs) for YRI, and around 1.25 Gb for both CEU and JPT individuals (50% of SNPs). Subsequently, we compared the results of H 3 M 2 with those obtained by PLINK and GERMLINE on the GATK calls. To allow for a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of the two tools, we defined six different parameter configurations for each of the tools (see Supplementary Methods). By using the most conservative configuration, PLINK (-homozyg-snp 500 and-homozyg-window-het 0) detected around 11 Mbthe entire genome with a mean SNP-to-SNP distance of around 2 kb. Conversely, the 4.2 million SNPs that we used are densely clustered in the exome target regions with a mean distance of 686 bp. It follows that these two different experimental designs may show limited overlap, making it difficult to compare results obtained by the respective analysis. To overcome this drawback, we evaluated only those polymorphic positions interrogated by both platforms and calculated precision and recall in the following manner:</p><p>To calculate precision, we considered all the polymorphic positions called in ROH by each of the three methods that belong to the HapMap dataset, and we then calculated the fraction of these positions that were called as homozygous also in the gold standard dataset.</p><p>To calculate recall, we considered all the polymorphic position called in ROH in the gold standard dataset that belong to WES experimental design, and we then calculated the fraction of these positions called as homozygous by each of the three state-of-the-art methods.</p><p>These analyses were performed for the three A, B, C ROH classes separately and the results are reported in<ref type="figure">Figure 4k</ref>–m. The precision–recall plots of<ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>show that the combination of large values of p 1 (0.2, 0.3) and small values of d Norm (10 3 , 10 4 ) increases the recall rate at the expense of the precision of H 3 M 2. On the other hand, the combination of small p 1 values (0.1) and large d Norm values (10 5 ) increases the precision of H 3 M 2 , while it decreases the recall rate. Moreover, changes in parameter configuration significantly perturb the performance of H 3 M 2 for Class A, but not for Class B and C, ROH. The combination of parameters that ensure the best trade-off between precision and recall is p 1 =0:1 and d Norm =10 5. Unlike H 3 M 2 , the performance of the two state-of-the-art algorithms is profoundly altered by changes in parameter configurations, whatever the ROH class. The high recall rate reached by GERMLINE and PLINK with less stringent parameter settings (-bits 50,-homozyg-snp 50) is obtained paying a tremendous cost in terms of precision at least for A and B ROH classes. On the other hand, attempts to improve precision adopting conservative parameter configurations (-bits 500 and-homozyg-snp 500) lead to a drastic deterioration of recall rates. With its best parameter configuration (-homozyg-snp 250,-homozygwindow-het 1), PLINK achieves a performance comparable with H 3 M 2 in the detection of Class C ROH (<ref type="figure">Fig. 4m</ref>), but not of Class A and B (<ref type="figure">Fig. 4k</ref>–l). Taken as a whole, these results disclose how H 3 M 2 outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of both precision and recall (sensitivity and specificity), and how H 3 M 2 performances are more robust with respect to changes in parameter configurations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION</head><p>In this article, we present a novel approach for the detection of ROH from individual WES data. The major computational issue we had to deal with was the non-uniform distribution of DNA markers in the exomic space. Current state-of-the-art methods for ROH detection have been conceived to be used with SNParray data, which in principle rely on genomic maps featuring equally spaced SNPs. This represents an intrinsic limitation to the application of such approaches to SNP maps retrieved from exome-targeted designs. If this issue can be overcome when focusing on ROH as large as megabases (Class C in the present article) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Pippucci et al., 2011</ref>), it can be less easily resolved when handling regions of smaller size (Class A and B in the present article). To meet the need of an approach tailored to WES data and develop a method that could efficiently capture exomic ROH of any size, we designed the H 3 M 2 algorithm that incorporates the distances between consecutive SNPs into the transition matrix of the heterogeneous HMM. We compared H 3 M 2 performances with those of two methods based on sliding–window algorithms, GERMLINE and PLINK. Previous application of GERMLINE to WES data offered poor specificity/sensitivity trade-offs to isolate even long IBD segments beyond 10 cM (<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Zhuang et al., 2012</ref>). We confirmed this observation: the highest recall rates reached by GERMLINE were obtained at a tremendous expense in precision. Conversely, demanding higher precision caused an indiscriminate fall of recall rates (<ref type="figure">Fig. 4k</ref>–m). As expected, based on what was already reported for SNP-array data (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Howrigan et al., 2011</ref>), PLINK algorithm holds well even on WES data, and behaved better than GERMLINE independently of the ROH class (<ref type="figure">Fig. 4k</ref>–m). H 3 M 2 , using the parameter configuration that guarantee the most appropriate F-measure according to the synthetic data analysis (p 1 =0:1 and d Norm =10 5 ), outperforms both GERMLINE and PLINK for A and B classes. The previously reported (<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Pippucci et al., 2011</ref>) ability of PLINK to detect long exomic ROH emerges also from the present analysis, where its performance in the detection of Class C is excellent with two different parameter configurations (-homozyg-snp 50,-homozyg-window-het 0 and-homozyg-snp 250,-homozyg-window-het 1) and highly comparable with that of H 3 M 2. Survey of the heterozygous genotypes independently called by GATK within detected regions emphasized how H 3 M 2 ensures the most accurate global ROH identification. The gain in performance of H 3 M 2 in the detection of Class B and Class A ROHs should not be undervalued. As it has been recently highlighted, despite their small size, such regions may be biologically relevant (<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Pemberton et al., 2012</ref>) and surround a causative mutation (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Hildebrandt et al., 2009</ref>). In ROH studies, it might be useful to take into account for LD, especially for Class A ROHs. This has been done in different ways (<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">McQuillan et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Nothnagel et al., 2010</ref>). Similarly, it might be desirable to identify autozygous ROHs according to the probability of ROHs to be IBD (<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Pemberton et al., 2012</ref>). H 3 M 2 detects all ROHs, without making such functional distinctions. All these approaches can be applied to ROHs identified by H 3 M 2 as part of downstream analysis. A notable advantage of H 3 M 2 is that its performance appears to be little altered by changes in parameter configuration. This is a particularly important property in the context of WES-based analyses, where the number and distribution of markers can vary extensively according to target design and experimental yield. Performance of sliding-window methods appears to be severely affected by this variability. Parameter changes affect H 3 M 2 performance less drastically than they do for PLINK and GERMLINE, indicating that H 3 M 2 results are robust across a wide range of parameter configurations. This is more evident for Class B and C, where all the F-measures fall in the range ½0:7; 0:8, than in Class A, where F-measures span the range ½0:5; 0:7. Another important feature of H 3 M 2 is its fast computational performance and its basic hardware requirements. Relying on BAF profiles instead of NGS genotype calls for the detection of ROH, the analysis of an aligned WES experiment with a mean coverage of 100Â requires around 20 min on a single 2.4 GHz processor with 2 Gb of RAM. Conversely, preparation of input genotype calls for tools like GERMLINE or PLINK requires at least few hours in the same machine. In conclusion, H 3 M 2 is a WES-based ROH-detection algorithm well-suited for direct identification and classification of exon-rich homozygous regions of every size. It outperforms GERMLINE and PLINK applied to the same training dataset, and most importantly it is less sensitive to parameter specification, ensuring that analysis results are not severely affected by the chosen parameter configuration as in GERMLINE and PLINK. The present work supports the use of H 3 M 2 for homozygosity mapping where it can efficiently replace SNP-arrays, and in studies of ROH variation and variation content across individuals in human populations.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><figDesc>The observed data O=fO 1 ; :::; O N g.

When d Norm is set to large values (10 5 ; 10 6 ), H 3 M 2 is not able to detect homozygous segments made of even hundreds of densely distributed SNPs and increasing p 1 has poor effect on the resolution of the algorithm. On the contrary, when d Norm is set to small values (10 3 ; 10 4 ), H 3 M 2 is able to detect homozygous segments made of densely distributed SNPs, and increasing p 1 has a relevant effect on resolution. Taken as a whole, these results suggest that to detect large homozygous segments and limit the false discovery rate, large values of d Norm (10 5 , 10 6 ) and small values of p 1 (0.1) should be used. On the other hand, to detect homozygosity with a high level of resolution, small d Norm (10 3 , 10 4 ) and large p 1 values (0.2, 0.3) are recommended.</figDesc></figure>

			<note place="foot">The total ROH length per individual detected with the most conservative parameter setting of H 3 M 2 is in general agreement with previously published work that studied homozygosity at a population level (Auton et al., 2009; Kirin et al., 2010; Pemberton et al., 2012). The YRI population has the shortest ROH per individual, reflecting the longer time over which recombination has been breaking haplotypes in this sub-Saharan African population, whereas the individuals in East Asia populations (JPT) have a slightly greater cumulative length of ROH than the other populations, which most likely reflects smaller founder population sizes in these populations. Subsequently, we studied the properties of the detected ROH by classifying them into three classes: ROH smaller than 500 kb (A), ROH in the interval (500 kb, 1.5 Mb) (B) and ROH 41.5 Mb (C), grossly following the classification adopted by (Pemberton et al., 2012). The first class (A) gathers short ROH mainly governed by local LD patterns; the second class (B) is that supposedly resulting from background relatedness in the population; and finally the third class (C) includes ROH originated from recent parental relatedness. The results obtained in this analysis completely reflect those of the synthetic data. When d Norm is large (10 5 ), increasing p 1 poorly affects the total amount of ROH detected in the three classes: Class A ranges between 101 and 141 Mb, Class B between 176 and 233 Mb and Class C between 232 to 310 Mb. Conversely, when d Norm is small (10 3 ) the parameter p 1 has strong effect on the total size of ROH detected in each of the three classes: Class A ranges from 200 to 460 Mb, Class B ranges from 311 to 520 Mb and Class C from 392 and 567 Mb. With regard to SNP proportions (Fig. 4b, d and f), when d Norm is large, increasing p 1 has little effect on the total fraction of SNPs involved in ROH regions (independently of the class), whereas for small values of d Norm , increasing p 1 drastically inflates the total fraction of SNPs within Class A ROH but has limited effect on the other two classes. All these results are explained by the fact that d Norm dictates the resolution of the algorithm. Large values of d Norm enable the algorithm to detect only large ROH or small ROH featuring a large number of SNPs. In this situation, increasing p 1 only improves the capability to detect Class B or C ROH containing a small number of markers. On the other hand, small d Norm values enable H 3 M 2 to efficiently detect also Class A ROH. In this case, increasing p 1 enables H 3 M 2 to identify the huge amount of small ROH made of small number of markers. On the three ROH class analysis, PLINK provided results similar to those of the present approach, while GERMLINE efficiently detected only large ROH. As a further step, to study the accuracy of the three algorithms, we examined the proportion of heterozygous variants independently called by GATK that in each of the 15 HapMap individuals overlapped the ROH detected by each of the three methods. Globally, as well as for any ROH class separately, ROH detected by H 3 M 2 are characterized by the smallest fraction of heterozygous GATK calls, with the sole exception of Class B ROH where one of the PLINK parameter configurations (-homozyg-snp 500 and-homozyg-window-het 0) performs slightly better (Fig. 4g–j). These results demonstrate the capability of our algorithm in detecting genuine homozygous segments with respect to the other methods. Finally, to evaluate H 3 M 2 ability to identify ROH from WES data and to compare its performance with respect to the other (a) ( b) (c) ( d) (e) ( f) (g) (k) ( l) ( m) (h) (j) Fig. 4. Performance comparison between H 3 M 2 , GERMLINE and PLINK on the WES data of the 15 individuals sequenced by the 1000 Genomes Project Consortium. The bar plots of panels a, c and e show the total length of ROH detected by the three approaches in the YRI (a), CEU (c) and JPT (e) individuals. The bar plots of panels b, d and f show the total percentage of SNPs that belong to the ROH detected by the three approaches in the YRI (b), CEU (d) and JPT (f) individuals. Each bar of the bar plot is colored with three different graduated shading: dark shading represents small ROHs (ROHs 500kb), lighter shading represents medium ROHs (500kb5ROHs 1500Kb) and light shading represents large ROHs (ROHs41500kb). The bar plots of panels g–j report the fraction of heterozygous single nucleotide variants that belong to all (g), small (h), medium (i) and large (j) ROHs detected by the three algorithms. The performance of the H 3 M 2 algorithm have been reported for different settings of the D Norm (10 3 ; 10 4 ; 10 5 ) and p 1 (0:1; 0:2; 0:3) parameters. The performance of PLINK have been reported for different values of heterozygote allowance (PL-H = 0and PL-H = 1) and different values of SNP threshold to call a ROH/sliding window size in SNPs (-snp = 50, 250 and 500). The performance of GERMLINE has been reported for different values of mismatching heterozygote allowance (G-H = 0 and G-H = 1) and different window size in SNPs (-bits = 50, 250 and 500).

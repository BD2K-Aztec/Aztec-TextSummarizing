			<abstract>
				<p>GREVE has been developed to assist with the identification of recurrent genomic aberrations across cancer samples. The exact characterization of such aberrations remains a challenge despite the availability of increasing amount of data, from SNParray to next-generation sequencing. Furthermore, genomic aberrations in cancer are especially difficult to handle because they are, by nature, unique to the patients. However, their recurrence in specific regions of the genome has been shown to reflect their relevance in the development of tumors. GREVE makes use of previously characterized events to identify such regions and focus any further analysis. Availability: GREVE is available through a web interface and open-source application (http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/GREVE).</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Genomic aberrations have been the subject of much interest in the past decade with variable degrees of success. Two categories have to be distinguished: exactly matching germline and unique, often somatic, aberrations. There has been much effort to identify and catalogue the former in order to treat them like regular markers such as SNPs (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Iafrate et al., 2004</ref>). The first difficulty lies in the exact characterization of the breakpoints. Furthermore, such inventory is impossible for somatic events that are by definition unique. Still, the recurrence of overlapping regions can indicate a key controlling area, e.g. a small deletion on 9p in adolescent acute lymphoblastic leukemia (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Paulsson et al., 2008</ref>). Current approaches are essentially based on either the integration into a general-purpose browser to provide context, but no measure of overlap, or the creation of a heatmap where the copy number itself is used as a metric across all types of events to characterize the recurrence (Cancer Genome WorkBench, https://cgwb.nci.nih.gov/cgi-bin/heatmap;<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Mermel et al., 2011</ref>). This single continuous value is then used to construct a score at every location. GREVE is designed to look into further details by allowing the user to define further subgroups such as copy neutral LOH that would be ignored otherwise. Furthermore, GREVE provides a highly configurable interface and specific statistics on recurrent events. GREVE has been successfully used in numerous cancer studies where the cohort size varied from a handful (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Langemeijer et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Olsson et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Paulsson et al., 2010</ref>) to hundreds (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Gupta et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">O'Shea et al., 2009</ref>). Highly flexible, GREVE provides the ability to statistically explore a given dataset and to present results in a ready-to-publish format.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">FEATURES</head><p>The purpose of GREVE is to enable a flexible view of aberrations across the genome, or per chromosome, and score their recurrence. Therefore, the default usage is very simple with the input of the sole list of events being sufficient, while it is highly configurable with further optional input to help the inspection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Key features</head><p>GREVE transforms a list of events into a genomic representation, summarizes and scores their recurrence across samples:</p><p>Read flat or Excel input files containing a list of event per individual and type, with build 35, 36 or 37 location (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 1b</ref>). Plot all events genome-wide and per chromosome with cytobands. The views can either sort all the events or overlay them with a fixed set of individuals (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 1c</ref>). Calculate, tabulate and plot recurrence within any given type of events (e.g. Gain, Loss and LOH), score each overlapping segment across multiple statistics (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 1c</ref>). Generate publication-ready figures in several graphical formats (EPS, PDF, PNG, JPG or TIFF;<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 1c</ref>). Inclusion of key genes on the per-chromosome plot as given in a separate list or known CNV from the Database of Genomic Variants (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Iafrate et al., 2004</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Formatting features</head><p>Because each study will have varying numbers of individuals and events, the default layout may not be optimal. All positions and colors are available in an optional configuration file.Merger of exactly matching events into a larger block.</p></div>

It requires ImageMagick software (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Still, 2005</ref>) for figure format conversion from the default Encapsulated PostScript format. The Poisson binomial test is implemented as a wrapper around the Poibin R-package (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Hong et al., 2011</ref>). The web interface allows the upload of all necessary files and a convenient way to select filters and options. It then outputs ready-to-publish figures as well as overlapping details. Examples and frequently asked questions are available on the website. All the options in the engine software are available through the graphical interface. However, to allow batch processing and further analysis, the source code is available on the website. This should allow specific extensions to match any given project such as subgrouping of individuals (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Purdie et al., 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Purdie et al., , 2010</ref>). The large demo analysis with 709 events across 30 samples takes 7 s on an AMD64 3.0 GHz processor with 64 Gb of RAM to process with overlaps and scores.</p></div>

It can be generated from the output of various aberration callers from SNP or CGH array as well as sequencing data with eventual post-processing (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 1a</ref>and b). Further optional flags, filters and files can be provided to add information or tailor the presentation:An optional configuration file allows further tailoring of the figures without the need to modify the program.</p></div>

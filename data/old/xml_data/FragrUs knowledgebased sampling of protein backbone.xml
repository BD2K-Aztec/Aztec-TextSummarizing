			<abstract>
				<p>Motivation The remodeling of short fragment(s) of the protein backbone to accommodate new function(s), fine-tune binding specificities or change/create novel protein interactions is a common task in structure based computational design. Alternative backbone conform-ations can be generated de novo or by redeploying existing fragments extracted from protein structures i.e. knowledge-based. We present Frag&apos;r&apos;Us, a web server designed to sample alternative protein backbone conformations in loop regions. The method relies on a database of super secondary structural motifs called smotifs. Thus, sampling of conformations reflects structurally feasible fragments compiled from existing protein structures. Availability and implementation Frag&apos;r&apos;Us has been implemented as web application and is available at http://www.bioinsilico.org/ FRAGRUS.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Structural-based computational design aims to alter and change the properties of proteins by using structural information. These include improving protein stability, change and/or optimization of catalytic activities, grafting of novel functionalities or altering the binding to small molecules, nucleic acids or proteins [see reviews (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Khare and Fleishman, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Kiss et al., 2013</ref>) and references therein]. Pioneering approaches in the field were focused in single amino acid changes with null or limited backbone flexibility (<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Lees et al., 2012</ref>). However, the remodeling and redesign of short fragments of the protein backbone, i.e. de novo design, overcomes the intrinsic limitations of fixed backbone design. Recent works have shown the potential of de novo design (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Eiben et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Murphy et al., 2009</ref>). The remodeling of the protein backbone usually occurs in the loop regions, given its intrinsic flexibility and variable nature. Usually, remodeling the loop regions seeks to accommodate specific interactions and restraints, e.g. catalytic residues (<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Murphy et al., 2009</ref>), or to create new local segments (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hu et al., 2007</ref>). The major limitation of de novo approaches is the inherent combinatorial complexity that makes almost impossible the systematic sampling of large insertions. In early works we have described the use of smotifs in loop structure prediction [including protein kinases (<ref type="bibr">FernandezFuentes et al., 2004)]</ref>, functional annotation (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Espadaler et al., 2006</ref>) and prediction of protein–protein interactions (<ref type="bibr">PlanasIglesias et al., 2013</ref>). Furthermore, we described that the dramatic increase of structures in the protein databank has resulted in the saturation of sampling of loop structures, even in the case of long loops (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bonet et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Fernandez-Fuentes and Fiser, 2006</ref>) subsequently confirmed (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Choi and Deane, 2010</ref>), and that the geometry of smotifs is fully sampled (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Fernandez-Fuentes et al., 2010</ref>). Here we extend the use of smotifs and we present Frag'r'Us, a knowledge-based approach designed to sample the conformation of loop regions between fixed flanking regular secondary structures. The sampling is based in the comparison of the geometry between query and candidate smotifs (see Server Usage in supplementary data), is length independent (the final loop length is not predetermined) and is very fast: a search among thousand of potential conformations is done in a matter of seconds. Candidate smotifs matching the geometrical constraints can then be grafted into the protein scaffold to be used as starting conformations for different de novo design manipulations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">APPLICATION</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Definition of smotifs and geometry features</head><p>Smotifs are super secondary elements composed of a loop region flanked by two regular secondary structures, i.e.-helix or-strand. The local structural arrangement of the two flanking secondary structures, i.e. Nt and Ct, defines the geometry of the smotif through four internal variables, a distance D and three angles, i.e. delta, theta and rho, as described in our earlier work (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Fernandez-Fuentes et al., 2006</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Server usage</head><p>The method has been implemented as a step-by-step web server. Frag'r'Us' basic inputs are the 3D coordinates and secondary structure definitions. In both cases, those inputs can be provided by the user (Supplementary Materials) or the coordinates can be automatically gathered from a Protein Data Bank (PDB) identification code (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Berman et al., 2000</ref>) and *To whom correspondence should be addressed. the secondary structure calculated using DSSP (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Kabsch and Sander, 1983</ref>). The chain of interest has to be defined. Additionally, the user can tune the tolerance for every search parameter exploited by the server. This includes the source database of smotifs, every geometrical property of the smotifs, the loop length and the structural fitting. Finally, it can perform three different tasks, namely, identify smotifs in the query coordinates, search for geometrically compatible smotifs and structurally align them. The search of candidate smotifs can be done in two different libraries: a redundant and non-redundant derived from the high-quality protein structures (i.e. X-ray resolution better than 2.5 A ˚ ) deposited in the PDB (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Berman et al., 2000</ref>) using PISCES (<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Wang and Dunbrack, 2003</ref>) at a 95 and 40% sequence identity cutoff respectively. See the Supplementary Material for a detailed explanation on both inputs and outputs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Smotifs sampling as strategy to generate useful initial conformations for backbone remodeling</head><p>The sampling of backbone conformations of loop regions is done using smotifs definitions. The sampling generates a comprehensive set of realistic conformations to be used as a starting point for further manipulation and optimization using protein design techniques. To further demonstrate that the sampled conformations are suitable, we have compiled a list of cases where the 3D structures of the scaffold and computationally engineered proteins are known. The set includes a wide range of examples in de novo computation design including a Diels-Alderase (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Eiben et al., 2012</ref>), a human guanine deaminase (<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Murphy et al., 2009</ref>), the catalytic loops in ()8-barrel scaffolds (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Claren et al., 2009</ref>), two retro-aldol enzymes (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Jiang et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Wang et al., 2012</ref>), a triosephosphate isomerase (<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Saab-Rincon et al., 2012</ref>) and the motifs to target antibody b12 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Azoitei et al., 2011</ref>). A detailed analysis of each case can be found in the Supplementary Material. Of the cases presented above, the remodeling of a 24-residue long insertion that included a helix-turn-helix motif is perhaps the most challenging (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Eiben et al., 2012</ref>). The remodeling of this region was carried by combining computational structure-based design: Rosetta (Leaver<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Fay et al., 2011</ref>), and crowdsourcing using the game-driven protein folding Foldit (http://fold.it). As shown in<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, the loop region of and smotif extracted from an uncharacterized protein from Porphyromonas gingivalis W83 (PG_1388; PDB code 2p3p) closely resembles the structure of the remodeled region.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">CONCLUSION</head><p>In this article, we present a server, Frag'r'Us, designed to sample loop conformations using the geometrical constrains of smotifs. Frag'r'Us has clear applications in de novo computational design by seeding the search of alternative backbone conformations using geometrically suitable backbone regions extracted from known protein structures. Frag'r'Us can be also used in protein–protein, protein–nucleic acids and protein-small ligand interface design by generating a set of alternative conformation of interface loops. Finally, Frag'r'Us can complement loop structure prediction methods and X-ray/NMR refinement protocols by generating loop conformations that are length independent.</p></div>

				<p>Tomo3D implements a multithreaded vectorized approach to tomographic reconstruction that takes full advantage of the computer power in modern multicore computers. Full resolution tomograms are generated at high speed on standard computers with no special system requirements. Tomo3D has the most common reconstruction methods implemented, namely weighted Back-projection (WBP) and simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique (SIRT). It proves to be competitive with current graphic processor unit solutions in terms of processing time, in the order of a few seconds with WBP or minutes with SIRT. The program is compatible with standard packages, which easily allows integration in the electron tomography workflow.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Electron tomography (ET) allows visualization of complex specimens in its native cellular context at near-molecular resolution (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Lucic et al., 2005</ref>). A series of projection images is taken with an electron microscope from a unique biological sample at different orientations around a single tilt axis. Tomographic reconstruction algorithms then combine those images so as to derive the 3D structure of the specimen. The number of images in the series usually ranges from 60 to 200. Due to the resolution needs, the image size generally ranges between 1024×1024 and 2048×2048 pixels, though 4096×4096 can now be used as well. Weighted Backprojection (WBP) is the standard reconstruction method. Iterative methods, such as Simultaneous Iterative Reconstruction Technique (SIRT), exhibit better performance in ET (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Lucic et al., 2005</ref>). However, they demand much longer processing time, which has prevented their extensive use so far. The complexity of the algorithms along with the data size turns 3D reconstruction into a computational intensive problem. Traditionally, high performance computing has been used to cope with the demands in ET (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Fernandez, 2008</ref>). Recently, the use of graphics processor units (GPUs) has revolutionized the field as they provide exceptional performance-to-cost ratio (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Castano-Diez et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Vazquez et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Xu et al., 2010</ref>), though a relatively specific * To whom correspondence should be addressed. hardware component, the GPU, is still necessary. Current standalone computers present tremendous power, thanks to technological and architectural advances (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Hennessy and Patterson, 2007</ref>), but they still have not been fully exploited in the field. We present a program, Tomo3D, that implements an approach to tomographic reconstruction based on the full use of the computational power within modern multicore computers. It takes advantage of the multiple cores and of the vector instructions within the cores, and also uses general code optimization techniques to make the most of the computers. The program significantly accelerates the 3D reconstruction methods WBP and SIRT, and even outperforms current GPU solutions. Furthermore, this program enables real-time tomography on standard multicore computers, without the need for clusters or GPUs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">IMPLEMENTATION</head><p>Current computers usually ship with one or more multicore processor chips, every one comprising several powerful cores (e.g. dual-2, quad-4, hexa-6). Moreover, the individual cores contain vector instructions, typically known as SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data), which perform multiple computations with different data elements of the same kind simultaneously (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Hassaballah et al., 2008</ref>). In particular, the SSE instructions (<ref type="bibr">Streaming SIMD Extensions)</ref>, present in all Intel and AMD processors, can perform four floating-point operations of the same type (addition, multiplication, etc) with their corresponding four pairs of operands. These features turn current computers into extremelly powerful platforms with two levels of parallelism available for the programmer: threads and SSE instructions to exploit cores and vector units within the cores, respectively. The 3D reconstruction problem in ET can be decomposed into a set of independent 2D reconstruction sub-problems corresponding to the slices perpendicular to the tilt axis. This has traditionally been the data decomposition used in ET for high-performance computing (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Fernandez, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Zheng et al., 2007</ref>). Each of the 2D slices of the volume can then be computed with any of the reconstruction methods, either WBP or SIRT but now working in 2D, from the corresponding set of 1D projections. The reconstruction of the independent slices can then be carried out in parallel. Tomo3D uses a multithreaded-vectorized approach to tomographic reconstruction (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 1</ref>). It relies on the Single Program, Multiple Data (SPMD) paradigm whereby the different threads essentially execute the same task over different data. The program creates a number of threads, typically as many as cores in the computer, that run in parallel. The program keeps a pool with the slices to reconstruct, clustered in slabs of four slices. The slabs are asynchronously dispatched to the threads when these become idle. When a slab is alloted to a thread, its four slices are reconstructed simultaneously, thanks to the SSE instructions (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agulleiro et al., 2010</ref>). Once a thread finishes the reconstruction of the slab, it requests for another one. The fact that slabs are dispatched on demand provides an inherent load-balancing mechanism (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Wilkinson and Allen, 2005</ref>), and makes Tomo3D flexible to adapt to situations where the computer is shared by several users/programs.Page: 583 582–583Tomo3D has been implemented in C under Linux, using Pthreads and SSE intrinsics. Single-core code optimization techniques have also been used to better exploit the memory hierarchy and the internal processing units within the cores (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agulleiro et al., 2010</ref>). Memory consumption has been reduced to a minimum, only keeping a small subset of slabs and precomputed tables (e.g. cosines, etc.) used throughout the reconstruction process. I/O operations have been optimized to reduce disk latencies. Tomo3D is equipped with the two most common reconstruction methods in the field: WBP and SIRT. For the iterative method SIRT, a number of options are available: the positivity constraint that ensures that all the points in the reconstruction be positive, a weighting to compensate the 'long object effect' (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Xu et al., 2010</ref>) and the possibility of resuming a reconstruction with more iterations. Tomo3D reads tilt-series and writes the output tomograms in MRC format and is fully compatible with standard ET packages (e.g. IMOD). Tomo3D is provided as a stand-alone, download-and-go, program that does not require any special hardware or software library in the system, which makes it especially attractive for structural biology laboratories. The program is freely available for predominant processing plaftorms and can be built for other platforms on request to authors.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">ILLUSTRATIVE PERFORMANCE TESTING</head><p>To illustrate the performance of Tomo3D in typical structural studies by ET, we used tilt-series of 70 and 140 images of sizes 1024×1024 and 2048×2048 to yield volumes of 1024×1024×256 and 2048×2048×256. The computation was carried out on a state-of-the-art server with two quadcore processors Intel Xeon E5405 at 2.0 GHz and on a standard desktop computer with a quad-core processor Intel Core 2 Q9550 at 2.83 GHz under Linux. Both reconstruction methods, WBP and SIRT (30 iterations) were tested. The experiments were carried out using eight threads on the server (denoted by 8T) and four threads on the desktop computer (denoted by 4T). For comparison, the reconstructions were also computed using the standard package in the field (see Supplementary Data).<ref type="figure">Table 1</ref>shows the processing times required by Tomo3D for the different experiments as well as the average speedup factors (based upon the time required by a single core with no use of vector instructions). As far as the processing time is concerned, Tomo3D succeeds in yielding full resolution reconstructions with WBP in the order of seconds (3–27 s and 2–16 s with 4 or 8 cores, respectively), which enables it for real-time ET (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Zheng et al., 2007</ref>). Even more interestingly, Tomo3D is able to provide iterative reconstructions in just a few minutes (3–23 min and 2–16 min, respectively). Finally, Tomo3D was compared to the most advanced GPU solution in the field. A reconstruction of 1424×2024×591 was computed from 61 images of</p></div>

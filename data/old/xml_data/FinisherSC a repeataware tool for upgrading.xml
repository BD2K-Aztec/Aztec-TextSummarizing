				<p>We introduce FinisherSC, a repeat-aware and scalable tool for upgrading de novo assembly using long reads. Experiments with real data suggest that FinisherSC can provide longer and higher quality contigs than existing tools while maintaining high concordance. Availability and implementation: The tool and data are available and will be maintained at</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In de novo assembly pipelines for long reads, reads are often trimmed or thrown away. Moreover, there is no evidence that stateof-the-art assembly pipelines are data-efficient. In this work, we ask whether state-of-the-art assembly pipelines for long reads have already used up all the available information from raw reads to construct assembly of the highest possible quality. To answer this question, we first collect output contigs from the HGAP (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Chin et al., 2013</ref>) pipeline and the associated raw reads. Then, we pass them into our tool FinisherSC to see if higher quality assemblies can be consistently obtained after post-processing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Usage and pipeline</head><p>FinisherSC is designed to upgrade de novo assembly using long reads (e.g. PacBio reads). It is especially suitable for data consisting of a single long reads library. Input to FinisherSC are contigs (contigs.fasta) constructed by an assembler and all the raw reads with adaptors removed (raw_reads.fasta). Output of FinisherSC are upgraded contigs (improved3.fasta) which are expected to be of higher quality than its input (e.g. longer N50, longer longest contigs, fewer number of contigs, high percentage match with reference, high-genome fraction, etc). In<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>, we show an example pipeline in which FinisherSC can fit. As shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>, FinisherSC can be readily incorporated into state-of-the-art assembly pipelines (e.g. PacBio HGAP).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Algorithm and features</head><p>The algorithm of FinisherSC is summarized in Algorithm 1. Detailed description of the algorithm is in the supplementary materials. We summarize the key features of FinisherSC as follows.</p><p>@BULLET Repeat-aware: FinisherSC uses a repeat-aware rule to define overlap. It uses string graphs to capture overlap information and to handle repeats so that FinisherSC can robustly merge contigs.</p><p>There is an optional component, X-phaser (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Lam et al., 2014</ref>), that can resolve long approximate repeats with two copies by using the polymorphisms between them. There is also an optional component, T-solver that can resolve tandem repeat by using the copy count information. @BULLET Data-efficient: FinisherSC utilizes all the raw reads to perform re-layout. This can fill gaps and improve robustness in handling repeats. @BULLET Scalable: FinisherSC streams raw reads to identify relevant reads for re-layout and refined analysis. MUMMER (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Kurtz et al., 2004</ref>MUMMER is single threaded, we provide an option to segment the files and run multiple MUMMER jobs in parallel. These techniques allow FinisherSC to be easily scalable to high volume of data.</p><p>Algorithm 1. Main flow of FinisherSC Input: contigs.fasta, raw_reads.fasta Output: improved3.fasta 1. Filter completely embedded contigs 2. Form a string graph with the BEST successors/predecessors as edges 3. Condense the string graph by contracting edges with both in-degree and out-degree being 1 4. Use raw reads to declare potential successors/predecessors of dangling contigs 5. Merge contigs (with gaps filled by reads) when they respectively only have 1 successor/1 predecessor 6. Form a string graph with ALL successors/predecessors as edges 7. Merge contigs with only 1 predecessor or 1 successor and each has no more than two competing edges</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Results and discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Experimental evaluation on bacterial genomes</head><p>We evaluated the performance of FinisherSC as follows. Raw reads were processed according to the pipeline in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 1</ref>. They were first error corrected and then assembled into contigs by an existing pipeline (i.e. HGAP). Contigs were upgraded using FinisherSC and evaluated for quality with Quast (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Gurevich et al., 2013</ref>). The data used for assessment are real PacBio reads. These include data recently produced at JGI and data available online supporting the HGAP publication. We compared the assembly quality of the contigs coming out from the Celera assembler (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Myers et al., 2000</ref>) of HGAP pipeline, the upgraded contigs by FinisherSC and the upgraded contigs by PBJelly (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">English et al., 2012</ref>). A summary of the evaluation is shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>. More details can be found in the supplementary materials. We find that FinisherSC can upgrade the assembly from HGAP without sacrifice on accuracy on these test cases. Moreover, the upgraded contigs by FinisherSC are generally of higher quality than those upgraded by PBJelly. This suggests that there is extra information from the reads that is not fully utilized by state-of-the-art assembly pipelines for long reads.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Experiments on scalability</head><p>We tested the scalability of FinisherSC by applying it to handle larger genomes. The data used are the benchmark data available on PacBio Devnet. We run FinisherSC with the option of using 20 threads (-par 20) on a server computer. The server computer is equipped with 64 cores of CPU at clock rate of 2.4–3.3 GHz and 512 GB of RAM. The running time is tabulated in<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Discussion</head><p>Although FinisherSC was originally designed to improve de novo assembly by long reads, it can also be used to scaffold long contigs (formed by short reads) using long reads. For that use case, we note that the contigs formed by short reads can sometimes have length shorter than the average length of long reads. Therefore, we suggest users to filter out those short contigs before passing them into FinisherSC.</p></div>

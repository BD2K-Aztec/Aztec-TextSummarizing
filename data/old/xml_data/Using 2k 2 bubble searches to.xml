				<p>Motivation: Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) discovery is an important preliminary for understanding genetic variation. With current sequencing methods, we can sample genomes comprehensively. SNPs are found by aligning sequence reads against longer assembled references. De Bruijn graphs are efficient data structures that can deal with the vast amount of data from modern technologies. Recent work has shown that the topology of these graphs captures enough information to allow the detection and characterization of genetic variants, offering an alternative to alignment-based methods. Such methods rely on depth-first walks of the graph to identify closing bifurcations. These methods are conservative or generate many false-positive results, particularly when traversing highly interconnected (complex) regions of the graph or in regions of very high coverage. Results: We devised an algorithm that calls SNPs in converted De Bruijn graphs by enumerating 2k þ 2 cycles. We evaluated the accuracy of predicted SNPs by comparison with SNP lists from alignment-based methods. We tested accuracy of the SNP calling using sequence data from 16 ecotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana and found that accuracy was high. We found that SNP calling was even across the genome and genomic feature types. Using sequence-based attributes of the graph to train a decision tree allowed us to increase accuracy of SNP calls further. Together these results indicate that our algorithm is capable of finding SNPs accurately in complex sub-graphs and potentially comprehensively from whole genome graphs.</p>

Rapid detection and creation of large libraries of SNPs is vital for timely investigation and identification of genes associated with important phenotypes. Contemporary sequencing technology can sample genomes comprehensively in only hours, with these data SNP detection is typically achieved by aligning reads to a reference genome and identifying SNPs as a difference between consensus and the reference (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Leggett and MacLean, 2014</ref>). Factors such as the need for a reference sequence and the assumption of a monomorphic sample mean that the consensus approach is limited in organisms for which we lack a reference genome, in outbred diploid samples, bulked population data or analysis of V C The Author 2014.

To deal with the very large amount of sequence data that current sequencing technologies produce, De Bruijn graphs have been used to represent k-mer (nucleotide subsequences of arbitrary length k) overlap patterns in sequence reads. These k-mer graphs have been implemented into efficient data structures for large collections of k-mers and have proven to be of great utility as the underlying data model over which numerous de novo genome assembly algorithms have been implemented (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Pevzner et al., 2001</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">, Zerbino and Birney, 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">, Simpson et al., 2009</ref>). Methods based on the De Bruijn graph have been implemented recently that can efficiently identify sample differences in sequence read sets (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Iqbal et al., 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">, Leggett et al., 2013</ref>).<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Iqbal et al. (2012)</ref>produced the first model and de novo assembly algorithms for variant discovery and genotyping directly from sequence data without using a reference genome. They incorporated a colour attribute for the edges in the graph that represents the sample from which the sequence is derived. In these multi-sample graphs polymorphisms appear as bubbles, a closing bifurcation of length 2k þ 2 with separate colours on each branch of the bifurcation 1. Discovering bubbles is a promising tactic for identifying SNPs in the graph, the bubble caller in Iqbal et al. and the more computationally intensive depth-first search method in<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Leggett et al. (2013)</ref>proceeds by marking the vertices in the graph that have at least two edges departing from them as starting points and following vertices sequentially until a vertex with at least two edges entering it is reached (<ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>). An alternative micro-assembly approach (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Peterlongo et al., 2010</ref>) begins by producing a tree of kmers for an input read set picking a seed k-mer and assuming that it lies on one path through a SNP and then looks for an opposite kmer, one substitution different, which would lie on another path through the bubble. If this can be found in the k-mer tree, then a recursive algorithm builds paths left and right of each k-mer until they join or no k-mer can be found. Further to graph structure, the attributes of the sample and sampled sequence reads can be used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Approach</head><p>De Bruijn graphs of sequence reads are typically very large with the vast majority of vertices having only a single in and out edge, as such no complex bubbles can exist in these areas and much of the graph need not be searched. Thus, we first build a sub-graph from a branching vertex that has at least two out edges and search subgraphs for cycles. We retain only cycles of length 2k þ 2 with two equidistant branching vertices in which the edge paths on each branch are a different colour. Internal nodes may be branching. These constraints allow us to simplify the search for cycles by only checking the locality of the starting branching vertex. Once the algorithm terminates, a simple walk of the vertices in the bubble, collecting the labels, gives the sequence. The two coloured k þ 1 walks result in separate nucleotide sequences of length k þ 1 in which the first nucleotide differs between the samples. Our method's very precise description of a bubble means that it has the potential to be extremely specific and generate highly accurate lists of SNPs from graph structure alone.</p></div>

A small sub-graph in a simple graph structure can return no SNPs and a sub-graph in a very complex structure has a prohibitive running time, there is no algorithmic bound. The algorithm as a whole is fast and can be easily modified for parallel processing. For the datasets used in this study searches ran from 4 to 48 h depending on the structure of the graph. In addition, the algorithm has a free parameter to choose the number of predicted SNPs to call and a time limit parameter to run. The algorithm allows flexible graph search strategies and by cutting the graphs into sub-graphs using a neighbourhood technique, we can speed up the search process and make the search extremely parallel, and therefore, potentially extremely scalable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Using canonical SNP lists to assess accuracy of the algorithm</head><p>To assess the accuracy of the SNPs predicted by 2k þ 2, we compared our predictions against published lists of SNPs called in the<ref type="bibr">Xiangchao et al. (2011)</ref>study. The contigs generated by the 2k þ 2 algorithm were used as query sequence in a BLASTn search with default settings (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Altschul et al., 1990</ref>) against the A.thaliana Col-0 reference sequence and used the top hit in the BLASTn to find the position of the predicted SNP in the genome. By comparing the position of the published SNPs with those from our algorithm, we could then calculate the number of SNPs accurately predicted by our algorithm as the number found in the published lists, accuracy is calculated as proportion of predicted SNPs that were included in the known SNP list. We used three measures of accuracy; sensitivity (true positive/true positive þ false negative), specificity (true negative/true negative þ false positive) and accuracy (proportion of predicted SNPs that were included in the known SNP list). Specificity in this analysis is always very close to 100% because of the very large number of non-SNP genome sites. As our algorithm searches only a subset of the graph defined in parameter T (Algorithm 1), we do not search the whole graph. In experiments here, we search a maximum of 200 000 sub-graphs and call accuracy on the number of SNPs retrieved in that set, not the whole graph.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Using bubble attributes to filter and improve accuracy</head><p>To use a classification algorithm such as decision trees (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Quinlan, 1986</ref>), 2k þ 2 bubble edge attributes were used to create a vector of values describing each bubble. We used coverage, summed coverage over each branch of the bubble and the mean number of branching vertices of the sub-graph where the bubble resides (See Supplementary Table S1 for summaries of the datasets used for classification). Each bubble in a graph was classified as a Real SNP or a false positive according to its presence in the SNP list and were divided into a training set and testing set. Two-third of the dataset is used for training the classifier and one third for testing. To train, we used a decision tree found in the freely available WEKA package () and kept the default parameters of the classifier.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Results and discussion</head><p>4.1 SNP prediction based on structure alone is highly accurate.</p><p>We ran the 2k þ 2 algorithm on graphs built with k ¼ 21 and predicted SNPs in the thirteen A.thaliana ecotypes. On average, we predicted 144541.6146741.9 6 19560.318183.2 SNPs. The total number of SNPs we predicted increases fairly linearly with the genetic distance of the test ecotype from the reference Col-0 (using the number of canonical SNPs between Col-0 and each ecotype as a proxy for distance,<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2B</ref>) and we achieved mean accuracy of 83.2783.7 6 3.83.5% of correctly predicted SNPs (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2B</ref>), indicating that bubble retrieval with our bubble search algorithm alone produces highly accurate SNP predictions and that the algorithm can detect more SNPs when there are more to be detected. The genetic distance of the ecotype from the Col-0 reference does not have a marked effect on accuracy in the majority of cases we examined. For 912 of the ecotypes, we observed accuracy clustered around the 85% mark (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig.  2C</ref>), indicating a natural limit on the accuracy of the prediction when using bubbles. Four of the ecotypes had lower than 80% accuracy. The accuracy is higher than that seen in the unsorted output of the Cortex (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Iqbal et al., 2012</ref>) variant caller, which we reported at around 40% but equivalent to that seen when the output from that program is sorted according to the Bubbleparse metric described in<ref type="bibr">Leggett</ref></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Accuracy of SNP calling is consistent across the genome</head><p>To determine whether our strategy suffered from bias towards particular genomic regions, we compared the position of SNPs predicted by the 2k þ 2 structure with those from the canonical lists for Col-0 and Tsu-1. Analysis of the proportion of published SNPs found by 2k þ 2 in windows of 20 kbp across the genome showed consistently high recovery of SNPs. Average recall in the windows was 73% (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref>). The number of published SNPs detected fell substantially in regions corresponding to the centromeres, though the proportion detected increased due to lower numbers of SNPs in these windows.To determine whether SNPs in any particular genomic feature types were preferentially missed by our algorithm, we examined enrichment of feature types in the 2.5% least sensitive 20 kbp windows. The distribution of accuracy–sensitivity estimates in the windows was observed to be approximately normal, and we applied a Bonferroni-corrected hypergeometric test to each feature type, comparing the proportion in the TAIR 9 Gene Ontology annotation of the genome with the proportion in the bottom 2.5% of accuracy–sensitivity windows. We saw that non-coding regions such as pseudogenes and transposable elements were enriched in the sample (P &lt; 0.001;<ref type="figure">Table 1</ref>), it is likely because centromeric regions are enriched in these features (AGI, 2000). The lack of bias towards successful SNP calls in any particular genomic feature or region indicates that the random search strategy we are using to create sub-graphs does not result in bias towards any specific parts of the genome, and we conclude that the 2k þ 2 algorithm has the potential to be part of a general SNP finding pipeline.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">The 2k 1 2 algorithm finds SNPs in complex portions of the graph</head><p>To establish the performance of the algorithm in complex regions of the graph, we compared the total number of branching vertices in a 100 vertex sub-graph with the number of SNPs that were predicted when each sub-graph was searched exhaustively. We looked at 54 616, 35 043 and 36 483 randomly sampled sub-graphs with more than two branching vertices for ecotypes Can-0, Bur-0 and Po-0, respectively. The majority of sub-graphs have just a few branching vertices though there are a few very heavily branched sub-graphs with more than 20 out of 100 vertices with branches (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4A</ref>). The number of SNPs predicted in each sub-graph is most usually 1 (49, 36 and 43 of sub-graphs contain only 1 SNP for Can-0, Bur-0 and Po-0, see Supplementary Data) regardless of the number of branching vertices. We would expect the total number of SNPs predicted to increase as graph complexity increases, since SNPs nearby in the genome (in particular within k of each other) would increase graph complexity. However, this is not observed, for sub-graphs with more than 15 branching vertices, we predict only one SNP in any ecotype (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4</ref>). Intuitively, we would expect the total number of SNPs predicted to increase as complexity increases as SNPs nearby to each in the genome other would increase graph complexity but this is not observed and for sub-graphs with more than 15 branching vertices, we predict only one SNP in any ecotype 4. Above 90% of predicted SNPs are in sub-graphs with only 2–5 branching vertices (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4B</ref>and Supplementary Data). The result indicates that the algorithm is most successful at retrieving SNPs in sub-graphs with only two branching vertices, though can handleFor each feature type, the proportion of all features in the genome and in the sample and a Bonferroni corrected P-value from the hypergeometric test is presented.Topographical detection of SNPsmoderately complex graphs and successfully identify SNPs within those sub-graphs. We have not been able to confirm whether SNP density does truly increase with graph complexity, and therefore, cannot rule out whether SNP prediction drop off in more complex regions is a true property of the graph or a failure of the 2k þ 2 algorithm to detect in these regions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Accuracy is improved by filtering candidate bubbles using a decision tree</head><p>We trained a decision tree to distinguish between known SNPs and non-SNP bubbles and applied it to the predicted bubbles from 16 ecotypes to successfully classify bubbles that represented real SNPs with higher accuracy whilst maintaining similar sensitivity and specificity than using bubble structure alone (<ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>). The specificity ranged between 97.22 and 86.33%, and sensitivities vary between 84.63 and 68.71% each of which is similar to the values seen when using structure alone. Accuracy in the predicted SNP set was from 86.33 to 97.04%, much higher than from structure. This result indicates that structure and extra bubble attributes can give very highly accurate sets of predicted SNP sets. In a similar approach, with very similar A.thaliana data<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Leggett et al. (2013)</ref>used a ranking heuristic to classify SNPs after initial prediction but found that accuracy of that heuristic was compromised as the number of SNPs predicted increased and in SNP sets of over 100 000 each newly predicted SNP has only a 40% likelihood of being accurate such that SNP sets of the size we predict contained very high numbers of false-positive SNP calls, the 2k þ 2 algorithm and classifier outperforms that approach significantly returning better than 90% accurate SNP calls for very large SNP sets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>The 2k þ 2 algorithm takes a graph theoretical approach to identifying topological structures, namely 2k þ 2 cycles in undirected graphs that can represent SNPs in sequences input to a donor De Bruijn graph. We have shown that 2k þ 2 can be used to generate sets of SNPs in graphs at high accuracy in the A.thaliana genome which is increased by application of the decision tree classifier. 2k þ 2 found SNPs across all portions of the A.thaliana genome without bias towards feature type or region. We did not find that all SNPs seen in alignment-based methods using a reference could be detected with this algorithm and in all our experiments, we found that around 70% of SNPs seen by alignment could be predicted. The 2k þ 2 strategy is, therefore, a useful algorithm that should find general use in reference-free SNP calling strategies in the future.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><figDesc>et al.

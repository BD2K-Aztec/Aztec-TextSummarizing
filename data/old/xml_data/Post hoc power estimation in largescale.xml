				<p>Background: The statistical power or multiple Type II error rate in large-scale multiple testing problems as, for example, in gene expression microarray experiments, depends on typically unknown parameters and is therefore difficult to assess a priori. However, it has been suggested to estimate the multiple Type II error rate post hoc, based on the observed data. Methods: We consider a class of post hoc estimators that are functions of the estimated proportion of true null hypotheses among all hypotheses. Numerous estimators for this proportion have been proposed and we investigate the statistical properties of the derived multiple Type II error rate estimators in an extensive simulation study. Results: The performance of the estimators in terms of the mean squared error depends sensitively on the distributional scenario. Estimators based on empirical distributions of the null hypotheses are superior in the presence of strongly correlated test statistics. Availability: R-code to compute all considered estimators based on P-values and supplementary material is available on the authors web page</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>In genomic and proteomic research thousands of hypotheses are tested simultaneously. Numerous procedures have been proposed to control multiple Type I error rates, e.g. the false discovery rate (FDR) or the family-wise error rate. The multiple Type II error rate or the statistical power, in contrast, have received less attention so far. The power of a multiple testing procedure can be defined in several ways (<ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Senn and Bretz, 2007</ref>). For example, one can consider the probability to reject at least one alternative hypothesis or the probability to reject all alternative hypotheses. We consider an intermediate approach, the average power, defined as the arithmetic mean of the elementary power values of all alternative hypotheses. The average power can be interpreted as the expectation of the proportion of rejected alternative hypotheses among all alternative hypotheses and corresponds to the so-called false negative * To whom correspondence should be addressed. rate (FNR) (e.g.<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Delongchamp et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Pawitan et al., 2005</ref>). The FNR is defined as the expectation of the false negative proportion (FNP), the proportion of retained true alternative hypotheses among all true alternative hypotheses and is related to the average power by Average Power = 1−FNR. The FNR depends on a number of parameters as the sample size, the effect sizes and the proportion of true null hypotheses among all hypotheses. Therefore, the FNR of an experiment is unknown a priori and can only be guessed based on preliminary assumptions. However, if data have already been observed, the FNR can be estimated based on the observed test statistics. This concept of 'post hoc power analysis' has been criticized for the case of a single hypothesis test (e.g.<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Hoenig and Heisey, 2001</ref>), where the post hoc power is just a 1:1 function of a single P-value. However, in experiments with a large number of hypotheses one can utilize the empirical distribution of the test statistics to estimate the FNR. Under suitable assumptions (e.g. if the elementary test statistics are sufficiently independent), the FNR is asymptotically equivalent to the FNP such that an estimator for the FNR can also be used to estimate the FNP. An essential element in the estimation of the FNR is the estimation of the proportion of true null hypotheses among all null hypotheses, denoted by π 0. Numerous estimators for π 0 have been proposed in the literature and we assess their performance in the estimation of the FNR. The FNR is a measure for the fraction of undetected alternative hypotheses and is therefore a crucial parameter to interpret negative findings in experiments where a large number of hypotheses is investigated. In addition, in large-scale multiple testing problems, FNR estimates can be used to define stopping rules for sequential testing. For example, one could continue sampling until the estimated FNR falls below a prespecified threshold. As shown in<ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Posch et al. (2009)</ref>under suitable assumptions such sequential testing asymptotically does not inflate the FDR if the sample size is increased for all hypotheses simultaneously and only the test at the final interim analysis determines which hypotheses are rejected. The nomenclature for the FNR is not consistent in literature: we label the expected proportion of retained true alternatives under all alternatives 'FNR' according to<ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Pawitan et al. (2005)</ref>and Norris and Kahn (2006).<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Delongchamp et al. (2004)</ref>label this quantity 'fraction of genes not selected', Craiu and Sun (2008) non-discovery rate. Additionally, the term FNR has also been used to denote the proportion of false negatives among all retained hypotheses (<ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Sarkar, 2004</ref>), a quantity that has also been labeled, e.g. 'false non-discovery rate (FNDR)' (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Genovese and Wasserman, 2002</ref>). In Section 2.1, we introduce a family of estimators of the FNR that depend on the data only through the number of</p></div>

In addition, we consider an estimator that is based on estimation of local FDRs. In Section 2.2, we review published and implemented estimators for π 0. These π 0 estimators and the resulting estimators of the FNR are evaluated in a simulation study in Section 3 for a variety of scenarios including different dependency structures of test statistics across hypotheses as independence, weak dependence and equi-correlation. Finally, we give several real data examples in Section 4.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Estimating the FNR and FNP</head><p>Consider a multiple testing procedure to test m hypotheses of which m 0 (m 1 ) are true null (alternative) hypotheses. Then the proportion of true null hypotheses among all hypotheses is π 0 = m 0 /m. Assume that for each of the elementary hypotheses a test with P-value p i ,i = 1,...,m, is defined. Let γ denote the critical value applied to the unadjusted elementary P-values. For example, for the Bonferroni test γ = α/m while for the Benjamini–Hochberg (BH) test γ = dα/m, where d = argmax i {p (i) ≤ iα/m} and p (1) ,...,p (m) denote the ordered P-values. We set γ = 0 if p (i) &gt; iα/m for all i = 1,...,m. Let R = R(γ) = #{p i ≤ γ} denote the total number of rejected hypotheses and V the number of rejected true null hypotheses. Then the FDR, defined as the expected proportion of erroneous rejections among all rejections, is given by FDR = E(V /max{R,1}) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</ref>).

If γ is chosen to control the FDR at level α, an alternative estimator is given by FNR = 1−A large variety of estimators for π 0 have been proposed, mainly as a tool to estimate the FDR. By (3) each such estimator defines also an estimator for the FNR. Given the underlying π 0 estimators are consistent as m →∞ and the observations are sufficiently independent across hypotheses (and some additional technical assumptions), the FNR estimators defined by (3) are consistent as well; if the π 0 estimator is asymptotically biased, the asymptotic bias of the resulting FNR estimator has the opposite sign (see Section 1 in the Supplementary Material for details). In Section 2.2, we give a review of estimators for π 0 and investigate the properties of the resulting FNR estimators for finite m in Section 3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2">FNR estimators based on estimates of local FDRs</head><p>An alternative estimator of the FNR can be defined using Efron's (2007b) empirical Bayes estimator of the density of the test statistics and estimates of the so-called local FDR. Consider the test of two-sided hypotheses H i : µ i = 0 versus</p><formula>H i : µ i = 0, i = 1</formula><p>,...,m. Then z-values z i are calculated by taking the standard normal quantile of the one-sided P-values. According to a Bayesian mixture model, it is assumed that the z-statistics belong to one of two classes, either corresponding to the true null hypothesis or the true alternative. The prior probability that a z-statistic corresponds to the true null hypothesis is π 0. Denoting the density of the z-statistics under the null (alternative) hypothesis by f 0 (z) (f 1 (z)), the mixture density f (z) of the z-statistics is given by</p><formula>f (z) = π 0 f 0 (z)+(1−π 0 ) f 1 (z).</formula><formula>(6)</formula><p>The local FDR for hypothesis i is defined as the posterior probability in the Bayesian mixture model that for hypothesis i the null hypothesis holds. The local FDR is given by fdr(z) = π 0 f 0 (z)/f (z), i = 1,...,m, such that f 1 (z) = (1−fdr(z)) f (z)/ ∞ −∞ (1−fdr(z)) f (z)dz (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Efron, 2007b</ref>). Let c 1−γ denote the (1−γ)-quantile of the standard normal distribution. Based on this representation of f 1 (z), we define an FNR estimator by</p><formula>FNR = c 1−γ/2 c γ/2 f 1 (z)dz = c 1−γ/2 c γ/2 (1−fdr(z)) f (z)dz ∞ −∞ (1−fdr(z)) f (z)dz</formula><p>(7) replacing fdr(z) and f (z) by appropriate estimates fdr(z) andˆfandˆ andˆf (z). Since fdr(z) = π 0 f 0 (z)/f (z), the estimate of fdr depends on estimates ofˆπofˆ ofˆπ 0 , ˆ f 0 andˆfandˆ andˆf. As in Efron (2007b), we estimatê f (z) by a natural spline and consider two estimators for f 0 (z) and π 0. First, it can be assumed that the null density is a normal distribution with mean δ and variance σ 2 and that the zvalues corresponding to alternative hypotheses have support outside a known interval<ref type="bibr">[−x 0 ,x 0 ]</ref>only. Then maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) of δ, σ 2 , and π 0 can be derived based on all observations falling into<ref type="bibr">[−x 0 ,x 0 ]</ref>. The threshold x 0 is chosen based on a heuristic algorithm. For the second option, it is assumed that f 0 (z) is a standard normal distribution [the 'theoretical null distribution' which corresponds to the assumption of uniformly distributed P-values in (4)] and π 0 can be estimated as above. For the actual computation we approximate fdr andˆfandˆ andˆf by piecewise constant functions using the R-package locfdr such that the integral simplifies to a sum. We consider two FNR estimators: LocThe based on the theoretical null distribution and LocMLE based on the estimated null distribution. Note that this FNR estimator is in<ref type="bibr">[0,</ref><ref type="bibr">1]</ref>by construction. If fdr(z) = 1 for all z, this suggests that the global null hypothesis holds and we set FNR = 0. Additionally, we consider two FNR estimators based on (7) where fdr(z) and f (z) are replaced by corresponding estimates from the fdrtool package.

They were chosen based on their availability in R (R Development Core<ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Team, 2009</ref>). As in Section 2.1.2, we assume that the distribution of the z-statistics and P-values can be modeled via a mixture model.

Two different methods to determine x 0 are proposed: the FNDR method is based on minimizing the estimated FNDR which is defined as the expected proportion of retained true alternative hypotheses under all retained hypotheses.

As outlined in Section 2.1.2, we also considered two FNR estimators, LocZfndr and LocZpct0, which are based on local FDR estimators from the fdrtool package: both local FDR estimators are based on z-statistics.

The mixing weight π 0 is estimated based on the marginal maximum likelihood. We considered the π 0 estimates resulting from a Laplace (ETLapl) and quasi-Cauchy prior (ETCau).

Additionally, we restrict the π 0 and FNR estimates to the interval<ref type="bibr">[0,</ref><ref type="bibr">1]</ref>. The simulations are performed for six reference scenarios. Here, we assume that m = 10000, n = 20 and consider three different proportions of true null hypotheses: π 0 ∈{0.9,0.95,0.99}. For the alternative hypotheses, we assume that the data are N(δ j ,1) distributed where the δ j are alternating −,−3/4,−/2,−/4 and ,<ref type="bibr">3/4,,/2,,/4</ref>for the (1−π 0 )m alternatives. For the reference scenarios, we consider ∈{1,2}. The actual FNRs in these scenarios are given in<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>. For the scenarios with correlated test statistics, the FNRs are practically identical. To investigate the impact of correlated test statistics on the properties of the FNR estimates, we performed the simulations for independent teststatistics, equi-correlated test statistics (as in<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Benjamini et al., 2006</ref>) and a block correlation structure (<ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Storey et al., 2004</ref>). For the latter, we assume that the test statistics are correlated in blocks of 10 hypotheses. Within one block, the correlation between the test statistics of hypotheses H j and H i is ρ, if i,j ≤ 5 or i,j &gt; 5, and −ρ if i ≤ 5 and j &gt; 5 or vice versa. For each block ρ is drawn from a uniform distribution on<ref type="bibr">[0,</ref><ref type="bibr">1]</ref>.<ref type="figure" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>shows the maximum RMSE and maximum bias of FNR for π 0 = 0.9,0.99 for independent and equi-correlated test statistics. The maximum is taken over the alternatives in {1,2}. Tables for all reference scenarios (RMSE and bias forˆπforˆ forˆπ 0 and FNR) can be found in the Supplementary Material. In all considered scenarios, ˆ π 0 has much lower RMSE than FNR. None of the FNR estimators has a uniformly lowest RMSE. Under independence, the Convest, LocThe and Pfndr estimator have the lowest maximal RMSE across the six considered scenarios (Section 2.3). For the scenario with block correlation, we observe somewhat larger RMSE than in the independent case (Supplementary Material). For the equi-correlated case (with ρ = 0.5), all estimators with the exception of the LocMLE and EfronMLE estimator have distinctively larger RMSE and bias compared with the independent case. Also the Jin estimator shows low RMSE in scenarios with equi-correlation but, as discussed below, its RMSE appears to depend very sensitively on the underlying parameters.<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>shows the RMSE of FNR of the Convest, Pfndr, LocThe, LocMLE and EfronMLE estimators when varying one of the parameters m, π 0 , or ρ in the reference scenario m = 10000, π 0 = 0.9, ρ = 0, = 2, n = 20. The figures for the remaining FNR estimators as well as for the π 0 estimators are given in the Supplementary Material. Due to the factor 1/(1−ˆπ1−ˆ 1−ˆπ 0 ) in the FNR estimators defined by (3), the RMSE is large for π 0 close to one even though the RMSE ofˆπ ofˆ ofˆπ 0 decreases with π 0. If π 0 = 1, with a large probabilityˆπprobabilityˆ probabilityˆπ 0 = 1 and the FNR is correctly estimated as 0. However, if the estimatê π 0 is less than 1, the FNR estimate is typically 1 (since under the global null hypothesis the BH test guarantees that with probability 1−α no hypothesis is rejected such that R(γ) = 0). Thus, in this setting, the distribution of FNR is concentrated on 0 and 1 which is reflected in a large RMSE. For π 0 &lt;&lt; 1 the estimators LocMLE and EfronMLE based on estimated null distributions have a larger RMSE than the estimators based on theoretical null distributions. Increasing the effect sizes of the alternative hypotheses does not lead to a consistent decrease of the RMSE of the FNR estimators. In contrast, for all FNR estimators in<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, the RMSE reaches a maximum for ∼ 1. For increasing m, the RMSE of most estimators slightly decreases.

In several of the plots the Jin estimate shows an erratic behavior (Supplementary Material). The estimator involves a tuning parameter γ and appears to depend quite sensitively on its value. In the simulation study, we used γ = 0.1 as recommended in Jin and Cai (2007). However, for some scenarios, choosing a slightly different value has a large impact on the RMSE (data not shown). In the simulation study, we applied the BH procedure which does not rely on a π 0 estimate but is strictly conservative if π 0 &lt; 1. This choice guarantees that the actual FNR is the same regardless of the π 0 estimator considered for the FNR estimation and allows for a better comparability of the investigated methods. Additional simulations for the Storey, Pfndr and Convest methods, where the FDR was controlled based on the same π 0 estimator as used in the FNR estimation, gave very similar RMSEs (data not shown). Normalization: It is well known that normalization can reduce the correlation in microarray datasets. We made further simulations for the five estimators considered above where the observations were standardized per chip such that they have mean 0 and variance 1. This standardization had hardly any impact in the independent and block correlated case. In the equi-correlated case, though, the correlation is practically removed by standardization and the</p><formula>0 1 2 3 4 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 ∆ RMSE(FNR)</formula><p>LocMLE Convest EfronMLE Pfndr LocThe FNR 0.5 0.7 0.9</p><formula>0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 π 0 RMSE(FNR) 0 20000 40000 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 m RMSE(FNR)</formula><p>0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8</p><formula>0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 ρ RMSE(FNR)</formula></div>

Note, however, that standardization may introduce a bias if a larger fraction of genes is differentially expressed and the effect of over-and underexpressed genes does not cancel out. To demonstrate that standardization cannot remove the impact of correlation in general, we performed additional simulations for the Convest, Pfndr, LocThe, LocMLE and EfronMLE estimators under a block correlation structure with larger block size. When increasing the block size to 100, standardization has practically no impact on the RMSE, but the RMSE (across = 1,2) increases compared with the scenarios with block size 10 even after normalization: for π 0 = 0.9 to 0.18, 0.19, 0.16 (for Convest, Pfndr and LocThe) and to 0.3, 0.36 (for LocMLE and EfronMLE); for π 0 = 0.99 to 0.38, 0.38, 0.34 (for Convest, Pfndr and LocThe) and to 0.39, 0.57 (for LocMLE and EfronMLE).

In the second example based on<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Huang et al. (2001)</ref>, we compare gene expression measurements of patients with papillary versus normal thyroid carcinoma (m = 12558, n = 8 per group). Due to the outliers and skewed distributions of expression values, the latter comparison was performed with Wilcoxon tests. As in the simulation study, the BH method was used to control the FDR at 5%. The considered estimators give rather divergent π 0 and FNR estimates for the Gruvberger data (<ref type="figure" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>). However, they can be classified into two groups: the estimators based on the assumption of a uniform null distribution of the P-values (Convest, LocTheand Pfndr) and the estimators based on estimated null distributions (EfronMLE and LocMLE). Within each group the results are similar. The differences between the estimates from the two classes of estimators may be due to either a large fraction of alternative hypotheses or correlation between the test statistics of different hypotheses. As described in Section 3.2, we investigated the distribution of pairwise correlation coefficients between pairs of genes and computed pairwise Pearson's (Spearman's) correlations for the Gruvberger (Huang) dataset. For the Gruvberger dataset, the distribution of the z-transformed correlation coefficients indicates much stronger dependence than for the Huang dataset<ref type="bibr">[</ref>. This indicates a strong dependence of observations, in the order of the magnitude of block correlation with block size 250 (Section 3.2). Thus, in this dataset standardization cannot remove the correlations. For the Huang dataset, the standardization is performed by subtracting the chip-wise median and dividing by the interquartile range. Since there is little correlation observed in the raw data, standardizing hardly changes the distribution of correlation coefficients [group 1</p><formula>(2), ˆ µ = 0.05 (0.04), ˆ σ = 1.08 (1.05)]</formula><p>. Note that in both examples after standardization a larger number of hypotheses can be rejected and the FNR estimates become smaller (<ref type="figure" target="#tab_3">Table 3</ref>). The example shows that the choice of the null distribution may be crucial for the estimation of the FNR. However, this also holds for hypothesis testing: for example, if the rejection threshold γ in the Gruvberger dataset is chosen such that the FDR estimate from the locfdr package is 0.05, one can reject 111 hypotheses assuming the theoretical null hypothesis but only seven when choosing the empirical null distribution.</p></div>

However, for finite m the simulation studies show that the estimation error in estimating the FNR is considerable larger than for the estimators of π 0. A reliable estimation of the FNR is difficult, especially if the number of alternative hypotheses is small. In these settings, the FNP is still highly variable and the FNR estimators are unreliable. Since the proposed FNR estimators are based on univariate P-values, they can be applied to a wide range of statistical tests including multi-stage procedures for which group-sequential P-values can be defined (<ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Victor and Hommel, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Zehetmayer et al., 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Zehetmayer et al., , 2008</ref>). The Convest, LocThe and Pfndr estimators that are based on theoretical null distributions showed the most favorable characteristics for independent test statistics in the considered scenarios, but have a large RMSE under strong dependence. In contrast, the EfronMLE and LocMLE estimators based on estimated null distributions are more robust in the equi-correlated scenarios, but show no advantage in the block correlated scenarios or if the proportion of alternative hypotheses is large. The latter comes from the fact that the estimation of the null distribution is based on the assumption that for most hypotheses the null hypothesis holds.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><figDesc>dz.

As in Efron (2007a), we apply Fisher's z-transformation to the correlation coefficients and standardize the approximate theoretical standard deviation (SD) 1/(n−3) such that the theoretical distribution of the transformed correlation coefficients is N(0,1) given that the true correlation is zero for all genes. The observed meanˆµmeanˆ meanˆµ and SDˆσSDˆ SDˆσ of the transformed correlation coefficients can then be compared with the theoretical values µ = 0 and σ = 1 under the assumption of independence. We performed a simulation study (1000 runs) to investigate how reliable the mean and variance of the pairwise correlation coefficients can be estimated. Assuming a per-group sample size of n = 20, we estimated the mean and SD of pairwise correlation coefficients under different correlation structures. For computational feasibility, we consider the pairwise correlations between the first 5000 genes in each dataset, only. The mean correlation coefficients showed very low variability under independence and block correlation (with block sizes up to 250) where 95% of the mean z-transformed correlation coefficients were in (−0.0008, 0.0006). Under equi-correlation (with ρ = 0.2,0.5 corresponding to z-transformed values of 0.84 and 2.26), the variation was somewhat larger and 95% of the z-transformed average correlation coefficients were in (0.45, 1.34) or (1.46, 3.25), respectively. This indicates that the order of magnitude of the mean correlation can be well estimated in the considered scenarios. Similarly, under independence the observed SD of the z-transformed correlations was close to the nominal value 1 under independence. However, under equicorrelation (ρ ∈{0.2,0.5}) the estimated SD was somewhat lower<ref type="bibr">[</ref>(1.14, 1.59), respectively. Standardizing the observations per chip as described in the previous section centers the distribution of z-transformed correlation coefficients around zero (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Efron, 2010</ref>). Consequently, the estimated mean correlation coefficients for the standardized data are close to zero under independence and under equi-correlation. For the estimated SDs, the impact of standardization is more intricate. While for equi-correlated data, the SD becomes practically 1 with very low variation, for block correlation standardization has only a marginal impact on the SD.</p></div>			</div>

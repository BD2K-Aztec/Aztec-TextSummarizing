				<p>Motivation: Representing domain knowledge in biology has traditionally been accomplished by creating simple hierarchies of classes with textual annotations. Recently, expressive ontology languages, such as Web Ontology Language, have become more widely adopted, supporting axioms that express logical relationships other than class–subclass, e.g. disjointness. This is improving the coverage and validity of the knowledge contained in biological ontol-ogies. However, current semantic tools still need to adapt to this more expressive information. In this article, we propose a method to integrate disjointness axioms, which are being incorporated in real-world ontologies, such as the Gene Ontology and the chemical entities of biological interest ontology, into semantic similarity, the measure that estimates the closeness in meaning between classes. Results: We present a modification of the measure of shared information content, which extends the base measure to allow the incorporation of disjointness information. To evaluate our approach, we applied it to several randomly selected datasets extracted from the chemical entities of biological interest ontology. In 93.8% of these datasets, our measure performed better than the base measure of shared information content. This supports the idea that semantic similarity is more accurate if it extends beyond the hierarchy of classes of the ontology.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Semantic similarity has direct application to the class–subclass hierarchy of many biomedical ontologies, such as the Gene Ontology (GO;<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Lord et al., 2003</ref>), the chemical entities of biological interest ontology (ChEBI;<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Ferreira and Couto, 2010</ref>) and the human phenotype ontology (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Ko¨hlerKo¨hler et al., 2009</ref>). Semantic similarity assigns a quantitative measure of similarity between two entities in an ontology, which has seen multiple applications in semantic web and bioinformatics contexts (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Grego and Couto, 2013</ref>). The state-of-the-art in knowledge representation in the biomedical domain is evolving to make use of ontology languages such as the Web Ontology Language (OWL). OWL allows for more logically expressive axioms than the simple class–subclass hierarchy and the relational statements favored in early bio-ontology releases (<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">McGuinness and van Harmelen, 2004</ref>). Following this trend, there is a need to adjust the current similarity measures to conform to current practices in ontology development (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Couto and Pinto, 2013</ref>). Ontologies such as ChEBI and GO now contain disjointness axioms, which express for a pair of classes the constraint that an instance of one of them cannot also be an instance of the other [Although the terms 'class' and 'concept' are usually interchangeable in literature, the former is favored by the Semantic Web and OWL language communities and the latter by the description logic (DL) community. In this article, we use the term '<ref type="bibr">class'.]</ref>. The constraint also restricts subclasses from being a subclass of both of the disjoint classes. If such shared instances or subclasses are detected by an ontology reasoner, the reasoner will flag the ontology as inconsistent, which can be used by ontology developers as a validation step to prevent errors in ontology development. In this article, we propose that disjointness axioms can also enhance the information that is exploited by similarity measures.<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>illustrates this situation. In this snippet, it is stated that no instance of Rectangle can simultaneously be an instance of Trapezoid. However, given the open-world assumption that underlies ontologies, there can be instances of Rectangle that are also instances of Parallelogram (in fact, it is a consequence of the relevant geometric definitions that all squares are both rectangles and parallelograms). (Informally, the open-world assumption states that what is not known to hold does not give any information about what is known not to hold. One consequence is that if an ontology does not contain subclasses for a given class, it cannot be assumed that no such subclasses exist.) For this reason, the similarity between Rectangle and Parallelogram should intuitively be higher than the similarity between Rectangle and Trapezoid. Using to represent the two-argument function that returns the similarity between two classes:Several current semantic similarity measures make use of the idea of information content (IC) applied to the classes of the ontology (<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Resnik, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Sa´nchezSa´nchez and Batet, 2011</ref>). The IC is a number that reflects how specific the class is. For example, in the illustration in<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>, Shape is the least specific class, receiving a lower IC than the other classes. There have been many proposals for how best to measure the IC of a class [See, e.g. Seddiqui and Aono (2010) and Van Buggenhout and<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Ceusters (2005)]</ref>. Another notion commonly used in semantic similarity is the most informative common ancestor (MICA;<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Resnik, 1995</ref>). This applies to a pair of classes x and y, and is defined as the class with the highest IC from the set of all ancestors of both x and y: MICAðx, yÞ ¼ arg max c fICðcÞ j c 2 AðxÞ \ AðyÞg ð2Þ where AðxÞ is the set of ancestors (super-classes) of x, including x. The first semantic similarity measure to make use of IC, by<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Resnik (1995)</ref>, estimates similarity as the IC of the MICA between x and y. The motivation behind this choice of the formula is simple: x and y share a certain amount of information, and the MICA is one way to estimate this shared information. Many semantic similarity measures are based on this notion of shared IC (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Jiang and Conrath, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Lin, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Pesquita et al., 2008</ref>). For example:</p><formula>Resnik ðx, yÞ ¼ ICðMICAðx, yÞÞ ð3Þ Lin ðx, yÞ ¼ 2 Â ICðMICAðx, yÞÞ ICðxÞ þ ICðyÞ ð4Þ</formula><p>On the other hand, work has been published recently showing a new approach to the problem of finding the best way to measure shared IC between two classes. Although shared IC has been assumed to be best estimated as ICðMICAðx, yÞÞ (<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Resnik, 1995</ref>), Couto and Silva (2011) suggest DiShIn, which behaves as an addon to the measure of IC, and contributes to a better measure of shared IC by exploring multiple parentage to ensure that all the shared information across multiple ancestors is taken into account. Just as was done for DiShIn, instead of proposing a semantic similarity measure, we propose an add-on that can be used by existing measures, such as the ones in Equations (3) and (4). Our add-on refines the estimation of shared information between the two classes by incorporating the disjointness axioms in the ontology. We call the new shared IC measure IC s disj ðx, yÞ, which will be based on a prior measure of shared IC, denoted by IC s ðx, yÞ. We stress that any measure of shared IC can be used as a base to IC s disj , not just the one proposed by Resnik, as is the case with DiShIn. Given the example presented in<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>and the inequality of Equation (1), it would be desirable for the measure of shared IC to decrease for classes that are known to be disjoint, to formalize the intuition that disjoint classes are less similar, as they cannot share instances. Furthermore, to respect the open-world assumption that often accompanies ontologies, the measure should stay unchanged when two classes are not known to be disjoint. With this novel measure of shared IC, we intend to show that semantic similarity can take advantage of the disjointness axioms of an ontology, thus providing evidence that future measures should consider them in evaluating the closeness in meaning between two classes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">CHEBI</head><p>For the evaluation of our proposal, we have computed shared IC for ChEBI, the ontology of Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Degtyarenko et al., 2008</ref>). It is worth, as such, to introduce the reader to the state of disjointness information that this ontology includes. In the Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies community (in which ChEBI is embedded), there is a tacit agreement that it is good practice to ensure that sibling terms are mutually disjoint. This is, however, not the case for ChEBI: mid-level chemical classes, which constitute most of ChEBI, are generally not pairwise disjoint, as chemical classification is compositional, i.e. classes often reflect parts or properties of molecules that may co-occur in many different combinations in fully specified molecules (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Hastings et al., 2012b</ref>). In an ontology of chemical compounds, a leaf class can, in theory, be regarded as disjoint with the other leaf classes. For example,-D-glucose is disjoint with histidine. However, ChEBI is not a complete ontology for chemistry, and some of the leaves it contains do not follow this rule. For example, aminophospholipid, defined as 'a phospholipid that contains one or more amino groups', is a leaf in ChEBI at present. However, this class represents the molecules that contain specific substructures and, as such, it is not necessarily disjoint with the other leaves. Given that ChEBI is a work in progress, where new knowledge is added after careful manual duration, this has resulted in aminophospholipid being presently a leaf. Other such cases can be found, rendering even the theoretical rule that all leaves are disjoint not applicable. Thus, in what follows, we have not attempted to automatically enhance the number of disjointness axioms available in ChEBI. Rather, we have used only those axioms that have explicitly been added to the ontology.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Shared information using disjointness</head><p>We propose the new measure of shared IC: IC s disj ðx, yÞ ¼ IC s ðx, yÞ À kðx, yÞ ð 5Þ<ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>. A snippet of a hypothetical shape ontology. Arrows represent class–subclass relationships and dashed lines represent disjointness axioms. We use the term Trapezoid to mean a quadrilateral with two parallel sides and two obtuse angles. Note that proper shape ontology would classify Square as a subclass of Rectangle, Rhombus and Parallelogram. However, for the sake of the argument being exposed, we assume that such information is as yet unknown by the ontology creators</p><p>where IC s ðx, yÞ is any measure of shared IC between x and y, kðx, yÞ40 if x and y are disjoint and kðx, yÞ ¼ 0 otherwise. Two points were crucial in the development of our measure. First, we note that, as is, this equation presents a discontinuity. In the hypothetical ontology of<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>, this measure leads to IC s disj ðD, EÞ5ICðBÞ. Depending on the value kðD, EÞ, this could lead to IC s disj ðD, EÞ5ICðAÞ ¼ IC s disj ðD, FÞ, which, however, should not be possible, as D and E share more information than D and F. Therefore, k was bounded according to the IC of the most informative ancestor of the MICA, which, in this case, results in kðD, EÞ ICðBÞ À ICðAÞ. The second major point associated with our measure is an operational notion: the likelihood of two classes sharing ancestors that are not asserted as such. We call this the potential for implicit common ancestors (ICAs). Take as an example the ontology snippets of<ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. In situation B, given the open-world assumption, there is a small chance that Y turns out to be a subclass of X 0 , while in situation A that cannot happen, as Y is inferred to be disjoint with X 0. This suggests that there is a lower potential for ICA between the classes X and Y in situation A, as the disjointness is declared between the direct subclasses of M. Rather than modeling the potential for ICA, we model the unlikelihood of ICA as the function fðx, yÞ, which returns higher values for situations with lower potential for ICA: fðx, yÞ ¼ max 1 pða, bÞ j a 2 AðxÞ ^ b 2 AðyÞ ^ Jða, bÞ [ f0g ð6Þ where AðxÞ is the set of ancestors of x (including x), Jða, bÞ is true when a and b are disjoint (either by assertion of inference), and false otherwise and pða, bÞ is the length of the shortest path from a to b. The path length takes into account only the class–subclass relations, not the disjointness arcs (the dashed edges of the figures). Using the example ontologies in<ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>, we can illustrate this definition by calculating fðX, YÞ. In B, Jða, bÞ is true only for ða, bÞ ¼ ðX, YÞ; the shortest path from X to Y, using only class–subclass relations, is X ! X 0 ! M ! Y 0 ! Y, which has length 4. Therefore, fðX, YÞ ¼ maxf 1 4 , 0g ¼ 1 4. In A, Jða, bÞ is true for ða, bÞ 2 fðX, YÞ, ðX, Y 0 Þ, ðX 0 , YÞ, ðX 0 , Y 0 Þg. These correspond to paths of length f4, 3, 3, 2g, respectively, leading to fðX, YÞ ¼ maxf 1 4 , 1 3 , 1 2 , 0g ¼ 1 2. Finally, for nondisjoint terms, such as X 0 and Y 0 in situation B, Jða, bÞ is always false: therefore, the first set of the union becomes empty, resulting in fðx, yÞ ¼ 0. The general procedure to calculate IC s disj ðx, yÞ is, therefore:</p><p>(1) Determine M ¼ MICAðx, yÞ;</p><p>(2) Determine Z ¼ arg max c fICðcÞ j c 2 AðMÞg, i.e. the most informative ancestor of M;</p><p>(3) Estimate the unlikelihood of ICA, fðx, yÞ, as described in (6);</p><p>(4) Calculate kðx, yÞ ¼ fðx, yÞ Á ðICðMÞ À ICðZÞÞ;</p><p>(5) Calculate IC s disj ðx, yÞ ¼ IC s ðx, yÞ À kðx, yÞ.</p><p>With this procedure, the new shared IC is estimated as a weighted average between ICðMÞ and ICðZÞ, where a higher f (lower potential for ICA) leads to a shared IC closer to ICðZÞ and lower f (higher potential for ICA) leads to a shared IC closer to ICðMÞ. This means that the shared IC decreases by a larger amount when there is a smaller potential for ICAs. Note that if the two classes are not disjoint, kðx, yÞ ¼ 0 and IC s disj ¼ IC s , which satisfy the open-world assumption.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Assessment</head><p>The assessment was done in the following three steps: (i) increase in correlation coefficient, (ii) effect of the number of disjointness axioms and (iii) the effect of our measure in several random datasets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Increase in correlation coefficient</head><p>First, we applied our new measure of shared IC to a subset of ChEBI. Disjoint axioms were supplied by the ChEBI development team (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Hastings et al., 2012a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Hastings et al., , 2013</ref>), and the main ontology was directly extracted from the official web page (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/downloadsForward.do) on October 18, 2012 (corresponding to version 96 of the ontology). To avoid any bias to an external corpus, IC for a class c was calculated with an intrinsic measure based on the total number of direct and inferred subclasses of c (Van<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Buggenhout and Ceusters, 2005</ref>):</p><formula>ICðcÞ ¼ À 1 log N Á log jDðcÞj N ð7Þ</formula><p>where D(c) is the set of subclasses of c (including c) and N is the total number of classes in the ontology. For example, leaves of the ontology (those classes without any descendants) have the maximum possible IC, 1.0. It is worth noting again that this is but one of the many possible ways of measuring IC, and that our measure can be adapted to any of them. We also used, for this assessment, the classical notion of shared IC proposed by Resnik (1995): IC s ðx, yÞ ¼ ICðMICAðx, yÞÞ ð8Þ</p><p>The subset of chemical classes from ChEBI used in this assessment (see Supplementary Material A) was randomly selected by first choosing<ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>. This image illustrates the notion of the potential for ICAs between two classes. In both cases, MICAðX, YÞ ¼ M, and the most informative ancestor of M is Z. The difference is in the location of the disjointness axiom. In situation A, there is a lower likelihood of ICA between X and Y, because the axiom of disjointness is closer to their common ancestryin the ontology, A 0 and B 0 , and then choosing two classes A and B, respectively, descendants of A 0 and B 0 , both fulfilling two conditions: Classes, not leaves: as many of ChEBI's leaves represent fully specified chemical compounds but we lack a trivial way to detect whether they do so (see Section 2), we decided not to use the leaves in the testing dataset. Classes with sufficient structural information: a class was included in the dataset if either (i) it contains a Simplified Molecular-Input Line-Entry System (SMILES) representation of its chemical structure or (ii) at least 80% of its leaf descendants contain such a representation. This allowed us to compare semantic similarity with a purely structural measure, as explained later in the text. Only classes in the chemical entity branch of ChEBI can fulfill this condition.</p><p>These selection criteria were applied until 40 distinct classes were found. Therefore, the resulting set contained some pairs of classes that are disjoint and some that are not. We chose to create a dataset bounded by a number of classes rather than use all disjointness axioms at once because it would be much larger and therefore analysis would take more time. To assess the usefulness of the disjointness axioms, we calculated the Pearson's correlation coefficient between the outcome of IC s disj and a purely structural measure of similarity between every pair of compounds in the dataset created previously. Semantic similarity, in general, is not intended to replace structural measures of similarity but to complement them with a knowledge-oriented perspective. Thus, it may seem strange, at first, that we use the correlation between structural similarity and IC s disj as a way to validate our measure. However, ChEBI's chemical entity branch models chemistry knowledge largely based on the structural properties of the molecules. As such, it is to be expected that measures of semantic similarity between classes from this branch of the ontology reflect, to some extent, the structural similarity between them. Therefore, in the particular case of this branch of ChEBI, semantic similarity should also reflect structural similarity, and, as such, it is valid to assume that an ontology-based measure with a higher correlation to structural similarity is better at estimating similarity than a measure with lower correlation to structural similarity. To measure structural similarity, we used PubChem's fingerprint method (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bolton et al., 2008</ref>). To compare classes x and y, we extracted the SMILES representations associated with their leaf descendants, using a best-match average approach to average over all the similarities, as follows:</p><p>(1) For class x, choose the leaf descendant classes that contain SMILES information, fx 1 ,. .. , x n g. If x has SMILES information, assume n ¼ 1 and x 1 ¼ x. Do the same for y to achieve the set fy 1 ,. .. , y m g.</p><p>(2) Generate a PubChem fingerprint for each x i and y j .</p><p>(3) Compare all the x i fingerprints with all the y j fingerprints, with the Tanimoto coefficient (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Flower, 1998</ref>), generating the matrix of structural similarities sðx i , y j Þ.</p><p>(4) For each i, find f x ðiÞ ¼ max j fsðx i , y j Þg; and for each j, find f y ðjÞ ¼ max i fsðx i , y j Þg.</p><p>(5) AssignIn summary, for the dataset created above, we compared all compounds with all the other compounds (780 distinct pairs) using three measures: structural similarity, classical IC s and IC s disj. We proceeded by using Wolfe's t-test (<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Rosner, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Wolfe, 1976</ref>) to determine the statistical significance of the increase from the correlation coefficient between ''structural similarity'' and IC s to the correlation coefficient between ''structural similarity'' and IC s disj .</p><p>It is important to notice here that we do our analysis over the raw value of IC s disj , rather than any one measure of similarity based on this value [such as in<ref type="bibr">Equation (4)]</ref>. This was done to show that we can increase the actual utility factor of the measure of shared IC rather than the utility of a specific measure of similarity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Effect of the number of axioms The second assessment step</head><p>was aimed at measuring the effect of the number of disjointness axioms in the increase of correlation. To this end, we created 10 sets of axioms based on the full set of 199 axioms of disjointness to which we had access. The first set contained 20 random axioms, the second contained these same 20 axioms plus 20 other random ones, etc, until the final set, which contained all the 199 axioms (see<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 4</ref>for a graphical representation of this procedure). For each of these sets, we ran the IC s disj algorithm and plotted a graph showing the increase in correlation versus the number of axioms. To remove any bias that could have resulted from the random method used to create these groups, we ran the same experiment 20 times.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.3">Effect on other datasets</head><p>As the third assessment step, we studied the increase in correlation coefficient on other datasets, as the dataset created for the first step resulted from a random selection process. Following the same selection process presented above, we created 550 more datasets (all with either 40 or 41 compounds) and compared the correlation coefficient as previously explained.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.4">Implementation</head><p>The semantic-related algorithms we used were implemented by us in Java, based on the OWL–API (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Horridge and Bechhofer, 2011</ref>). Python was used to calculate Pearson correlation coefficients and to compute the P-values of the Wolfe's t-test. We used scipy (http://www.scipy.org/) package for this effect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</head><p>We present three main results stemming from the comparison of structural and semantic similarity measures. Our main assumption is, as stated above, that in the chemical entity branch of ChEBI, a measure that correlates more strongly with structural similarity is performing better at estimating the real similarity than a measure with a lower correlation.Consecutively, each of these clusters is joined with the previous ones to create a set s i ¼ S i j¼1 p j , which is then used to compute the increase in correlation coefficient</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Increase in correlation coefficient</head><p>Our first conclusion is that exploring the axioms of disjointness leads to an increase in the correlation between structural and semantic similarity. The Pearson's correlation coefficient between the structural measure and IC s is 0.69883, and after taking the disjointness axioms into account, the correlation for structural similarity versus IC s disj becomes 0.71571. This represents an increase of 0.01688. Despite the small absolute increase, this value is statistically significant, with a P-value of 4:5 Â 10 À8. The small increase of the correlation can be attributed to at least three factors: As the annotation of disjointness is still incomplete in ChEBI, we have access to only a small subset of all the real disjointness axioms that could be expressed in ChEBI, which means that the shared IC changes only for a fraction of all the class pairs (39% from the sample selected). As more axioms of this kind are included in ChEBI, we expect both this fraction and the difference between correlation coefficients to increase. Although highly correlated, structural similarity and semantic similarity measures are inherently different, and as such, there is a maximum bound on the actual correlation that can be expected between the two. Also, different classes within ChEBI can be expected to show a lower increase, whereas others show a higher increase. Disjointness is only one of the logical axiom types that are used to express class definitions in an OWL ontology. In fact, ChEBI contains a number of other properties that are also used to capture the meaning of its classes, e.g. the property has-tautomer, which connects together closely structurally related chemicals, and has-role, which connects a chemical class to its biological activity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Effect of the number of axioms</head><p>To clarify the first item above, we performed the second assessment step, which aims to simulate the development of the ChEBI ontology with respect to the number of disjointness axioms. For each of the 20 runs, we studied the difference between the correlation coefficients as the number of disjointness axioms increases, and plotted a graph with this information. The graphs in<ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>show the result of some of these experiments. These graphs illustrate that not all disjointness axioms are important for a given dataset. In fact, only for some of the sets of axioms is the correlation coefficient significantly affected, which suggests that those sets contained the axioms that change the logical meaning behind the classes in the dataset. The graphs present a very obvious trend (see<ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>for an average of the graphs of all the 20 experiments) that indicates an increase of the correlation, which, again, indicates that the disjointness axioms improve the correctness of the measure of semantic similarity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Effect on other datasets</head><p>As the dataset created for the purpose of the results presented before resulted from a random selection process, we also studied the effect of considering the axioms of disjointness in other 550 datasets. The graph of<ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>is a histogram that represents the difference in the Pearson's correlation coefficient for all these datasets. As is visible in that graph and in<ref type="figure">Table 1</ref>, the vast<ref type="figure">Fig. 5</ref>. These graphs illustrate the effect of the number of disjointness axioms on the correlation coefficient between structural and semantic similarity. In each graph, the abscissa is the number of axioms used by the semantic similarity measure, and the ordinate is the correlation coefficient. The correlation coefficient for 0 axioms is always equal to the correlation measured with the classical IC s , which is 0.69883; the correlation coefficient for the maximum number of axioms corresponds to the value 0.71571 presented in Section 4.1. These graphs are representative of the behavior obtained in all of the 20 runs<ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>. This graph shows the average of all the graphs produced in the 20 runs of Section 4.2. Although these values do not have any statistical significance in themselves, they clearly show the trend that the more disjointness axioms are considered, the better is the correlation between structural and semantic similarity majority of the datasets are associated with an increase in the correlation coefficient. In fact, the effect of considering the disjointness axioms for the semantic similarity only impacts negatively 6.2% of the datasets. We observed a mean correlation increase of 0.0149, with a standard deviation for that value of 0.0130. Furthermore, in 72.5% of the datasets, the increase in correlation is significant at a confidence value of 0.05.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">LIMITATIONS</head><p>Although the work presented here shows with statistical strength the utility of IC s disj when measuring shared IC between two classes, it can still be improved. We presented the discontinuity problem, and how to avoid it by restricting k so that shared IC never reduces below ICðZÞ (where Z is the most informative ancestor of the MICA). This can lead to some other problems. For example, future changes to the ontology can lead to unexpected changes in IC s disj. Consider the ontology change of<ref type="figure">Figure 8</ref>. Assuming 1000 classes in the ontology, ICðBÞ % 0:77 and ICðAÞ ¼ 0. After the step illustrated in the figure, ICðXÞ % 0:72. This means that IC s disj ðE, FÞ increases unexpectedly from 0.38 to 0.74 because of a very small change in the ontology. These kinds of top-level additions, however, are not very common, and as such, the magnitude of this particular jump in similarity is not expected to happen very often. A second point of future development in our measure concerns Equation (6), used to model the potential for ICAs. Our approach depends on the edge distance between two classes; however, it may be possible to explore the semantics of the edges themselves to refine this measure. Another important point to notice in this work is that the measure of IC influences the results obtained with IC s disj. In this case, IC was calculated with the information contained in the ontology alone. It would be informative to see the effect of changing the IC measure used with IC s disj to a more realistic one. Finally, this assessment is valid in ChEBI because we may assume that semantic similarity correlates with structural similarity in the particular branch we used. For other ontologies, where such assumption is not valid, the most promising way to validate would be to rely on external and curated gold standards.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CONCLUSION</head><p>Recently, Couto and Pinto (2013) presented the benefits that result from using DL axioms in the calculation of similarity. To the best of our knowledge, this article is the first attempt to include DL axioms into ontology-based similarity measures in the biomedical domain. Accordingly, the main purpose of this work was to test whether exploiting the disjointness axioms of an ontology increases the performance of shared IC measures. We developed an add-on that can be used with any measure of shared IC, called IC s disj , which satisfies the designated requirements set forth in the beginning of the work, particularly that its value should decrease for disjoint pairs of classes. The assessment of our measure, which is based on the Pearson's correlation coefficient between structural similarity and semantic similarity, has shown that there is, in fact, an improvement of the measure of shared IC because its correlation with structural similarity in an ontology that encodes structural knowledge increases as the number of disjointness axioms increase. This new approach is able to successfully explore more than just the subsumption hierarchy of an ontology, relying<ref type="figure">Fig. 8.</ref>A hypothetical developing step in one ontology. From one iteration to the next, the ontology gained a new term between A and B. Before this change, the similarity between E and F depends on the difference ICðBÞ À ICðAÞ; after the change it depends on ICðBÞ À ICðXÞ<ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref>. Distribution of the difference in correlation coefficient for 550 random datasets. The majority of the cases show a positive difference. We used Wolfe's t-test to calculate the P-value associated with the hypothesis that the increase was due to random chance, and marked with a darker shade the amount of datasets for which P 50:05. The vertical line shows the 0 of the axis, i.e. where the two correlation coefficients are the same<ref type="figure">Table 1</ref>additionally on a partial subset of the description logic axioms that are included in the ontology to further refine the comparison of two classes. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first attempt to use description logic expressivity in semantic similarity in the biomedical domain. We demonstrated our hypothesis that disjointness axioms contain informative data that can be correctly explored by semantic similarity measures, even with a naı¨venaı¨ve approach. More sophisticated approaches may include the exploration of the semantics of edges, other types of IC based on external corpus, etc. In conclusion, this work strongly suggests that future measures of semantic similarity should consider the full logical formalism of the ontologies that they use to establish a measure of similarity that more accurately reflects the reality of the domain of knowledge therein modeled.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig.2.</head><figDesc>Fig. 2.

			<abstract>
				<p>SVAMP is a stand-alone desktop application to visualize genomic variants (in variant call format) in the context of geographical metadata. Users of SVAMP are able to generate phylogenetic trees and perform principal coordinate analysis in real time from variant call format (VCF) and associated metadata files. Allele frequency map, geographical map of isolates, Tajima&apos;s D metric, single nucleotide polymorphism density, GC and variation density are also available for visualization in real time. We demonstrate the utility of SVAMP in tracking a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus outbreak from published next-generation sequencing data across 15 countries. We also demonstrate the scalability and accuracy of our software on 245 Plasmodium falciparum malaria isolates from three continents. Availability and implementation: The Qt/Cþþ software code, bin-aries, user manual and example datasets are available at http://cbrc.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Associating sequence variants [single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and indels] with sample metadata such as geographical location and drug susceptibility have played a key role in studying the population structure (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Manske et al., 2012</ref>), identifying mechanisms of drug resistance (<ref type="bibr">Downing et al., 2011</ref>) and tracking the transmission of an infectious disease (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Harris et al., 2010</ref>). With the increasing application of deep sequencing as an approach, the number and volume of population studies with geo-biological information and associated genomic data will continue to grow. This increases the demand for tools to integrate, visualize and analyse complex genomic epidemiological data in real time, including browsing genome variation patterns and assessing population structure or geo-phylogeny. Although software such as Polylens (<ref type="bibr">Berry et al., 2013</ref>) and GenGIS (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Parks et al., 2009</ref>) can integrate geographical and genetic sequence data, there is a need to scale up to whole genome variation in the standardized VCF format (<ref type="bibr">Danecek et al., 2011</ref>) with informative population genetic analysis. This motivated us to develop SVAMP, a stand-alone Qt/Cþþ application capable of analysing variants in the context of geography and aiding in making inferences on the population structure. SVAMP is built on the open-source software VarB (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Preston et al., 2012</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">METHODS</head><p>Input to SVAMP software is a bundle of multisample VCF file, reference FASTA, annotation general feature format (GFF) and a precalculated SQLite database file. The bundle preparation script included as a part of SVAMP software captures the geographical coordinates, date of isolation and the genome coverage of samples. The files when loaded into SVAMP will aid the user in performing key population genomics analysis in real time and visualize the results. Two popular methods of analysing sample relatedness, principal coordinate analysis [PCoA; Torgerson–Gower scaling (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Gower, 1966)]</ref>and geo-phylogenetic tree, are integrated into SVAMP. The pairwise dissimilarity matrix D is first computed based on the Hamming distance (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Hamming, 1950</ref>) (d) between pairs of samples (i, j) using equation</p><formula>dði, jÞ ¼ 1=L X L k¼1 ½S i, k 6 ¼ S j, k </formula><p>where k is the index of the genomic position out of L considered positions. S i,k is the genotype called by sample i at position k in the genome. Positions that have missing genotype information are ignored in the computation; therefore, the multisample VCF file should ideally consist of samples and variants with reasonably complete data. The matrix D forms the basis for subsequent PCoA and phylogenetic tree reconstruction and consists of N (number of samples) rows and K (number of variant positions) columns. PCoA, equivalently multidimensional scaling, is computed as per the R function cmdscale, and the phylogenetic tree is constructed using Fitch– Margoliash algorithm (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Fitch and Margolia, 1967</ref>). The user is provided with an option to group colours based on a known phenotype (e.g. drug susceptibility) or a custom classification. The ability to perform tree computation using external phylogeny package is also supported by saving alignments in a compatible format and visualizing the tree in SVAMP. The PCoA, phylogenetic tree and exporting alignments can be performed on multiple regions of interest within a subset of samples. Integrating popular bam viewers such as LookSeq (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Manske and Kwiatkowski, 2009</ref>) to view read alignment evidence for variants is an added feature of SVAMP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">RESULTS</head><p>We have evaluated the application and scalability of SVAMP using two published datasets: (i) a bacterial population study (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Harris et al., 2010</ref>) on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (commonly known as MRSA) and (ii) a worldwide *To whom correspondence should be addressed.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Exploring the population structure of Malaria isolates using SVAMP</head><p>The raw sequencing data obtained from P. falciparum diversity study (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Manske et al., 2012</ref>) were mapped using smalt, and SNPs were called using samtools. Resulting variants were merged using vcftools. Only coding region variants that do not fall in var, rifin and stevor gene (the hypervariable gene families in malaria) sites were included. After filtering for quality and missing data, 26 918 SNPs were retained. This dataset consists of 245 samples from six countries: three from Africa (AFR), two from Southeast Asia (SEA) and Papua New Guinea (PNG). The PCoA analysis using SVAMP in Supplementary<ref type="figure">Figure S5</ref>clearly shows three different clusters as three different groups AFR, SEA and PNG, as seen in the paper by Manske et al. (2012). As expected, individual continental PCoA analyses demonstrate separation between East and West African samples (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig. S6</ref>) and between Thailand and Cambodia samples.

			<note place="foot">Memory usage and computational speed of SVAMP was evaluated on a laptop computer with 2 cores (4 GB RAM) and on a workstation with 12 CPU cores (96 GB RAM). The results were averaged for both MRSA and malaria datasets and are shown in Table 1. CONCLUSIONS By using the sequence variant and associated geographical information, we believe the software SVAMP will aid greatly in analysing isolates from an outbreak, as well as predicting the population structure in epidemiological studies.

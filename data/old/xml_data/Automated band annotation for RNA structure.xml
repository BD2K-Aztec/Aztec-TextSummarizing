				<p>Motivation: Capillary electrophoresis (CE) is a powerful approach for structural analysis of nucleic acids, with recent high-throughput variants enabling three-dimensional RNA modeling and the discovery of new rules for RNA structure design. Among the steps composing CE analysis, the process of finding each band in an electrophoretic trace and mapping it to a position in the nucleic acid sequence has required significant manual inspection and remains the most time-consuming and error-prone step. The few available tools seeking to automate this band annotation have achieved limited accuracy and have not taken advantage of information across dozens of profiles routinely acquired in high-throughput measurements. Results: We present a dynamic-programming-based approach to automate band annotation for high-throughput capillary electrophoresis. The approach is uniquely able to define and optimize a robust target function that takes into account multiple CE profiles (sequencing ladders, different chemical probes, different mutants) collected for the RNA. Over a large benchmark of multi-profile datasets for biological RNAs and designed RNAs from the EteRNA project, the method outper-forms prior tools (QuSHAPE and FAST) significantly in terms of accuracy compared with gold-standard manual annotations. The amount of computation required is reasonable at a few seconds per dataset. We also introduce an &apos;E-score&apos; metric to automatically assess the reliability of the band annotation and show it to be practically useful in flagging uncertainties in band annotation for further inspection. Availability and implementation: The implementation of the proposed algorithm is included in the HiTRACE software, freely available as an online server and for download at http://</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>RNA molecules play diverse roles in encoding and regulating genetic information, and much of this versatility can be traced to the formation of intricate RNA structures. To this end, chemical probing methodologies provide a general and rapid means to mapping RNA secondary and tertiary structure at single-nucleotide resolution (<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Weeks, 2010</ref>). There exist many chemical probing techniques, most of which have common experimental procedures, as follows. Given an RNA of interest folded in solution, a chemical reagent modifies the RNA, either cleaving it or forming a covalent adduct with it at a rate correlated with the accessibility of particular moieties at each nucleotide or the frequency at which each nucleotide fluctuates into a conformation activated for chemical reaction. Examples of such chemical reagents, all with distinct mechanisms, include hydroxyl radicals, 2 0-OH acylating chemicals (SHAPE), dimethyl sulfate (DMS) and 1cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl) carbodiimide metho-p-toluenesulfonate (CMCT) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Weeks, 2010</ref>). Subsequent reverse transcription detects the modification sites as stops to primer extension at nucleotide resolution. The resulting complementary DNA fragments are resolved in sequencing gels followed by individually quantifying band intensities. Prior to the mid-2000 s, the bottlenecks were the final steps (gel running and band quantification). To resolve fragments in a more high-throughput fashion, capillary electrophoresis (CE) was developed and is reaching wide use (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Mitra et al., 2008</ref>). CE-based chemical probing can produce hundreds of electrophoretic profiles exhibiting tens of thousands of individual electrophoretic bands from a single experiment, leading to recent developments in two-dimensional mapping of complex RNA structures (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Kladwang et al., 2011</ref>) and their excited states (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Tian et al., 2014</ref>) and extension to large complexes such as entire viruses (<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Watts et al., 2009</ref>) and to RNA design problems (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Lee et al., 2014</ref>). Further developments in next-generation sequencing readouts are promising but still show biases compared with CE measurements (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Kladwang et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Lucks et al., 2011</ref>). Analyzing a large number of electrophoretic traces from a highthroughput structure-mapping experiment is time consuming and poses a significant informatic challenge, requiring a set of robust signal-processing algorithms for accurate quantification of the bands embedded in these traces. Software methods for CE analysis include capillary automated footprinting analysis (CAFA;<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Mitra et al., 2008</ref>), ShapeFinder (<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Vasa et al., 2008</ref>), high-throughput robust analysis for CE (<ref type="bibr">HiTRACE;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Yoon et al., 2011</ref>), fast analysis of SHAPE traces (FAST;<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Pang et al., 2011</ref>) and QuShape (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Karabiber et al., 2013</ref>). A typical high-throughput CE analysis pipeline consists of the following steps (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Karabiber et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Kladwang et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Yoon et al., 2011</ref>): preprocessing such as normalization and baseline adjustment, alignment, peak detection, band annotation and peak fitting. Among these, band annotation refers to the process of mapping each band in an electrophoretic trace to a position in the nucleic acid sequence. For verification, visual inspection in this phase is inevitable to some extent. However, in practice, this band annotation step often takes significant manual efforts in CAFA and SHAPEfinder, for they were designed to focus more on alignment and peak fitting. HiTRACE, QuShape and FAST have provided improved levels of band annotation support, but band annotation remains still the most time-consuming and error-prone step for large datasets. This article describes a dynamic-programming based approach to automated band annotation for large CE datasets. These datasets involve at least four and up to hundreds of multiple traces that are aligned for each RNA, based on sequencing ladders for the four different nucleotide types, different chemical modifiers, and/or chemical modification under different solution conditions or with different mutations. The central innovations herein are (i) an accurate and well-tested procedure to integrate information across these multiple traces into a single consensus band annotation with accuracy approaching that of manual annotation and (ii) a reliability estimator for this procedure.<ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>shows the overview of the proposed methodology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Problem definition</head><p>Given an RNA sequence s probed at N nucleotides, assume that we carry out the chemical structure probing of this sequence using M different treatments, each of which is run in a separate capillary lane. Assume that the fluorescence intensity of each capillary is measured over K time points. We define a profile (also called a trace) as the sequence of intensity values from a capillary. For any particular profile, the reactivity of each nucleotide to the chemical reagent is represented at a specific location in the series of intensity values, and N such locations are sequentially spread throughout the entire profile. All profiles are assumed to be well aligned using the procedure described in<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Yoon et al. (2011)</ref>, such that each nucleotide corresponds to the same location across all profiles. The entire CE measurement can then be arranged in a K Â M matrix D. Normally, N ( K, i.e. each electrophoretic profile is finely sampled in time. On the basis of the characteristic of the chemical agent used in each treatment and the secondary structure computationally inferred from the input sequence, we can predict the fluorescence intensity at each position of s for each of M treatments. This prediction can be arranged in an N Â M matrix P called the prediction matrix (see below). The problem of band annotation is therefore formulated as selecting N out of the K rows of D using the information in P in such a way that a certain objective is optimized over all possible K N possibilities. The selected N points map to the locations of the nucleotides of the sequence s in the CE measurement (see Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig. S1</ref>).<ref type="figure">1</ref>. Overview of the proposed dynamic-programming-based band annotation methodology. Given an RNA sequence, we carry out high-throughput structure-mapping experiments, producing a number of CE traces. If available or estimated through computational prediction, we also provide the RNA's secondary structure. From this information and the characteristics of the chemical probing method used, we derive a prediction matrix that stores expected interaction patterns across the residues and traces. On the basis of the aligned CE traces and prediction matrix, we apply a dynamic-programming approach that finds the optimal selection of the band locations under a welldefined scoring scheme</p><p>The input of the proposed method consists of the following: @BULLET D 2 R KÂM : the fluorescence intensity matrix @BULLET P 2 f0; 1g NÂM : the prediction matrix @BULLET s 2 fA; C; G; Ug N : the nucleotide sequence and the output is an array y 2 Z N þ representing N band locations selected out of K.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Prediction matrix construction</head><p>Figure 2a defines the expected reactivity of each type of nucleotide to chemical reagents used for chemical probing under the (un)paired condition. The value of 1 means that the nucleotide is reactive to the reagent, whereas 0 indicates no reactivity. For instance, the DMS chemical modifies A and C but not U and G, and the entries for A and C are one, while those for U and G are zero. We allow the use of numerous chemical probing strategies: DMS alkylation, CMCT and 'others' that can produce bands at all locations, including 2 0-OH acylation (the SHAPE strategy) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Kladwang et al., 2014</ref>). We also allow input of a secondary structure in dot-parentheses notation. Nucleotides forming base pairs are not expected to show bands in DMS, CMCT, SHAPE and other structure mapping profiles. Sequencing experiments that terminate reverse transcription of the RNA with ddNTP incorporation produce bands after nucleotides complementary to the terminating nucleotide. On the basis of this information, we construct the prediction matrix P that stores the expected chemical reactivity for individual residues. The element p ij 2 P indicates such reactivity information of residue i to reagent j.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2b</ref>shows an example RNA sequence with its secondary structure.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2c</ref>shows the corresponding prediction matrix P.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Initialization of candidate peaks from profiles</head><p>The first step is to locate prominent peaks on each profile (each column of D). Peaks in CE profiles are the locations where significant reactivities are observed, implying that bands are more likely to exist at the same position. Thus, these peaks are matched with bands afterward. (Here and below, 'peak' refers to a local maximum in each profile, of which there may be many; whereas 'bands' refers to the desired N band locations.) Let d j be the jth column vector of D; 1 j M. Briefly, the following procedure is executed. 1. Select candidates for the peaks in d j that can be mapped into elements of the sequence s. These peaks are selected to satisfy the following conditions. First, a peak d j ðkÞ must have a higher intensity (a fundamental property of a peak) than those of its neighbors, d j ðk À 1Þ and d j ðk þ 1Þ. Second, a peak must be with a significant curvature which can be measured by the second derivative of time series; since the time series given are discrete, the curvature is estimated as below:</p><formula>C ¼ D À À D þ (1)</formula><p>where</p><p>D À ¼ maxðd j ðkÞ À d j ðk À 1Þ; ðd j ðkÞ À d j ðk À 2ÞÞ 2 Þ D þ ¼ minðd j ðk þ 1Þ À d j ðkÞ; ðd j ðk þ 2Þ À d j ðkÞÞ 2 Þ The D À and D þ in (1) approximate the slope of left and right side of peak, respectively, and C is the difference between them; thus, the magnitude of C represents how abruptly the curve has turned from upward to downward. Now we choose N peak j peaks with highest C from the points satisfying the first condition, where N peak j is set to twice the number of nucleotides reactive to the chemical agent used for the jth profile (i.e. the number of ones on the jth column of P). Call these candidate peak locations A i j ð1 i N peak j</p><p>). 2. In preparation for the sampling scheme and score function computation below, estimate the ideal separation between bands based on the remaining peak locations:</p><formula>q¼ D ðmin j k r j À min j k f j Þ=ðN À 1Þ,</formula><p>where k f j and k r j are the locations of the foremost peak and the rearmost peak respectively on the jth profile. 3. In preparation for the score function computation below, construct a matrix based on these candidate peak locations called the bonus matrix B 2 Z KÂM. Let C be the mean value of C i of the candidate peaks. Initialize B to all zero. At each peak A i j , we apply a uniform bonus, supplemented by a stronger bonus at sharp peaks: BðA i j ; jÞ ¼ C=2 þ C i .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Formulation as dynamic programming</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.1">Basic motivation</head><p>In essence, the band annotation problem is to select N out of K points and match them to peak locations (if at all possible) in an optimal way. This is similar to the problem of aligning two sequences ð1; 2;. .. ; NÞ and ð1; 2;. .. ; KÞ without allowing gaps for the latter.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>.. .. ..K</head><p>In the example above, the first three bands are located at 2, 5 and 9 time units. To find the most probable one among all such alignments, each possible alignment is given a score that represents its likelihood. Dynamic programming can be utilized to find thesolution set with the highest score, which in turn leads to the most likely locations of bands. More formally, define a matrix F indexed by n and k (1 n N; 1 k K) where the value Fðn; kÞ indicates the maximum score up to the band n and position k. (More details on F are given below.) The matrix F is filled up recursively:where Sðn; k 0 ; kÞ is the score attained by going from position k 0 to k for band n. As shown in Equation (2), the mappings in Fðn; kÞ consists of mapping band n to location k added to the solution for Fðn À 1; k Ã Þ, where k Ã is the argmax in (2). The constraint on k 0 in (2) implies that a jump from k 0 to k is forward and its width is capped by a reasonable upper bound so that the entire search space can be narrowed down for efficient implementation; it was also confirmed through tests that the existence of upper bound does not affect the outcome.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.2">Degeneracy breaking and primary profile</head><p>In the proposed method, a band is allowed to be matched to a candidate peak even if their positions are slightly off from each other; in other words, an exact positional coincidence is not required for a peak-band matching (see Section 2.5.2 for detail). Thus, the formalization of our problem in the previous section allows for an undesired scenario in which two different bands will be matched to the same closest peak (see Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. S2</ref>); this can be problematic especially near strong peaks [high C in (1)]. To avoid such degeneracies, an additional search variable p is introduced: the relative position of the matched peak to the band position k. The tuple (n, k, p) corresponds to the instance in which the band n is located at position k and matched with the peak at k þ p if there is any; there is no score bonus if there is no peak at the position. The matrix F is now redefined as a 3-dimensional matrix as follows:</p><p>Fðn; k; pÞ ¼ max k À 2:5q k 0 &lt; k jpj &lt; q=2 k 0 þ p 0 &lt; k þ p fFðn À 1; k 0 ; p 0 Þ þ Sðn; k 0 ; k; pÞg</p><formula>(3)</formula><p>The constraint jpj &lt; q=2 is to restrict bands to be matched only with nearby peaks, and the last constraint k 0 þ p 0 &lt; k þ p means that two distinct bands cannot share the same peak. One problem that arises with the use of p is that there should be M such p's for M profiles, implying that the matrix F should not be three-dimensional but actually (M þ 2) dimensional. However, this would make solving this problem too costly. As a compromise, the problem is simplified by choosing one primary profile among M profiles so that p is applied only to it; therefore, F may remain as a three-dimensional matrix. Our software automatically determines the primary profile based on the data type with a preference for sequencing ladders. For our datasets, the last profile (a ddTTP ladder) was selected; without loss of generality, d M will be considered as the primary profile in the rest of this article.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.1">Distance bonus term</head><p>It is empirically supported that the length between consecutive locations, k 0 and k, is quite evenly distributed. S dist is the bonus term that utilizes this fact and induces the dynamic programming to end up with regularly stretched output. In addition, observations on reference annotations suggest that a gap between two consecutive locations tends to be shorter when the preceding location corresponds to 'G' in the RNA sequence (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Mills and Kramer, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Sasaki et al., 1998</ref>). These observations lead to the definition of distance bonus term as follows:</p><formula>S dist ðn; dÞ ¼ f ðq 0 ; q 2 Þ ðdÞ f ðq 0 ; q 2 Þ ðq 0 Þ (7)</formula><p>wherewhere S m peak stands for the bonus from matching a peak to a band in d m , assuming such a band exists. The bonus was designed to be boosted for a greater curvature at the peak and the proximity of the peak to the band, so S m peak is defined as the product of a Gaussian density function and an entry of B corresponding to the candidate peak closest to location k:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.2">Peak bonus term</head><formula>S m peak ðkÞ ¼ max jqj&lt;q=2 f ð0; q 5 Þ ðqÞ f ð0; q 5 Þ ð0Þ</formula><p>Á Bðk þ q; mÞ</p><formula>(9)</formula><p>for m &lt; M, andAs described above, this last term is taken from the primary profile (typically a sequencing ladder) rather than searching for optimal peak/band matches across all profiles to allow degeneracy breaking at reasonable computational expense. [A separate dynamic-programming-based band annotation algorithm was also tested which does not carry out the peak/band degeneracy breaking of Equation (10) and gave slightly worse performance; see Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig.  S3.</ref>] The bonus in (10) is non-zero where k þ p coincides with a candidate peak location A i M. For some cases, the primary profile might have regions with few candidate peaks, and such matches do not occur; the bonus values become zero and the optimal values of p are instead set by positional constraints in (3) and candidate peaks in other profiles (9). A large number of such failed matches flag an unreliable band annotation, as described next.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.6">Reliability evaluation</head><p>Although the presented band annotation method was found to be quite accurate, it was not perfect. We therefore sought a method to assess the reliability of automatically determined band locations prior to practical application. We devised a score to predict the quality of results. The idea behind the score is that when optimization of Equation (6) fails to achieve the desirable solution, we typically see extraordinarily short or long distances between consecutive locations (little information from S dist ) or bands on the primary profile without proper matching to peaks (little information from S M peak ). The E-score is defined with the following terms: @BULLET n 1 : number of bands on the primary profile without corresponding peak. @BULLET n 2 : number of gaps with length &lt; q=4 or &gt; 2q. @BULLET N peak M : number of bands on the primary profile predicted by P.</p><formula>@BULLET E ¼ 1 À maxð n1 N peak M ; n2 KÀ1 Þ</formula><p>E-score is a value between 0 and 1 and conservatively estimates the fraction of well-annotated bands in the output. The relationship between E-score and accuracy is presented in Section 3.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure 4a</ref>–c shows the electrophoretic profiles annotated with band locations by three different methods: reference, proposed and QuShape (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Karabiber et al., 2013</ref>), respectively. The reference annotation was based on expert assignments carried out at the time of data acquisition (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Lee et al., 2014</ref>). QuShape was chosen as the comparison target for its superior accuracy in band annotation relative to other software we tested, FAST and ShapeFinder (data not shown); no-modification and ddTTP ladder profiles were used as references (RXS1, BGS1) while running QuShape. Visual inspection suggests that the proposed method produces annotations more compatible with the reference. In this profile, the annotation determined by QuShape deviates from the reference position, particularly near the beginning of sequence. To generally and quantitatively assess the accuracy of automated band annotation, we applied the proposed method and QuShape to 95 datasets acquired in the EteRNA project (<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>). For both methods, we computed the mean squared error (MSE) of the band<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Karabiber et al., 2013)</ref>locations determined by the proposed method with respect to the reference locations, in units of average distance between locations. For a sense of scale, the typical MSE achieved by expert annotation is 0.15, based on comparisons of different experts' annotations with each other and to next-generation-sequencing-based measurements, where sequence annotation is unambiguous (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Kladwang et al., 2014</ref>); see Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">Figure S4</ref>. In our experience, a band annotation result with MSE lower than 0.5 typically requires no or a small number of manual single-click corrections. The box plots in<ref type="figure">Figure 5a</ref>–c and individual MSE values (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2) reveal that the proposed method outperforms QuShape across the datasets. For example, the median MSE of the proposed method is 0.21, well under our target value of 0.5, compared with 0.72 from QuSHAPE. As separate metrics of accuracy, we measured the Pearson's correlation coefficient r and the Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence between the reference and computationally determined band positions. Again, the average correlation coefficient of the proposed method is 1.68 times closer to 1, and the average KL divergence is 5.84 times smaller. These results quantitatively confirm what we observed qualitatively on using these tools: significantly less manual intervention is needed with the proposed method compared with QuShape. Further tests confirmed the utility of using multiple profiles, secondary structure information and peak match degeneracy breaking in producing accurate band annotations (Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Fig. S3</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Accurate peak-area quantification</head><p>In the RNA structure mapping pipeline, the band annotation is followed by peak deconvolution, which fits each band with a Gaussian curve and outputs the quantified area of the band. To see how these final band quantification results are impacted by the band annotation method, we calculated Pearson's correlation coefficients between band areas quantified based on the band annotation found by the proposed method and those quantified based on the reference annotation. We also repeated the calculation with the band intensities quantified by QuShape. For fair comparison, we applied the same peak deconvolution software (<ref type="bibr">HiTRACE;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Yoon et al., 2011</ref>) to these three methods. As one example,<ref type="figure">Figure 6a</ref>and b shows the correlation of results between the proposed method and reference for a specific dataset (flavin mononucleotide binding branches) for two chemical modification strategies (SHAPE and DMS).<ref type="figure">Figure 6c</ref>and d shows the correlation between the QuShape and reference results, which is visually worse than the proposed method in both cases. Over all the datasets,<ref type="figure">Figure 5d</ref>and Supplementary Table S1 gives the distribution of the Pearson's correlation coefficients. The median correlation coefficient for the proposed method is 0.976, which is higher than that for QuShape (0.939) and the distribution for the proposed method shows smaller variance. This observation suggests that using the proposed band annotation can significantly enhance the accuracy of band quantification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">E-score reliability metric predicts MSE accuracy</head><p>In Section 2.6, we proposed E-score to evaluate the quality of results from our method. We assessed the use of E-score based on its ability to predict the accuracy of the band annotations compared with gold standard annotations, quantitatively evaluated as MSE.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 7a</ref>shows the distribution of MSE for results satisfying E ¼ 1:0; these values are substantially smaller than those in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 7b</ref>, which includes all 95 datasets. For example, all 26 results under constraint E ¼ 1:0 have MSE below 0.5 as shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 7a</ref>, confirming that aAutomated band annotation for RNA chemical probing'perfect' E-score essentially guarantees high quality of band annotations; furthermore, 50 out of 51 results with E &gt; 0:97 have MSE below 0.5 (even the one exception has MSE &lt; 1). In addition to this experimental test, artificial datasets were generated based on the original datasets through random convolution in terms of amplitude and interval for further verification.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 7c</ref>and d show the trends of mean and standard deviation of MSE with respect to E-score, where<ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 7c</ref>comes from artificial data generated from a single dataset, whereas artificial data involved in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 7d</ref>was generated from all 95 datasets. The trends shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 7c</ref>and d further confirm that a lower E-score corresponds to MSE values with higher (worse) mean and standard deviation.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">Figure 7e</ref>shows the histogram of the E-scores over the 95 datasets prepared. Overall, 39% of the datasets have E-score equal to 1, and 84% have E-score greater than 0.97, suggesting that poor E-scores and subsequent detail manual correction will be encountered in a minority of cases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Results in longer, biological RNA sequences</head><p>In an effort to test the proposed method's compatibility with a wide array of high-throughput RNA structure mapping datasets, we prepared sample experimental datasets of biologically derived RNAs. These additional 21 datasets include a class I ligase (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bagby et al., 2009</ref>), the Tetrahymena L-21 ScaI group I ribozyme (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Russell et al., 2006</ref>), a four-way junction from the Escherichia coli 16S ribosomal RNA (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Tian et al., 2014</ref>), RNA replicases (C19, tC19 and tC19Z) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Wochner et al., 2011</ref>), human Hox transcripts 5 0 UTR (Hox5 and Hox9D189) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Xue et al., 2015</ref>) and RNA Puzzle entries (#5–10 and 12) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Cruz et al., 2012</ref>). In each dataset, complete sets of chemical modifier reactions (no modification, SHAPE, DMS, CMCT) and reference ladders (ddNTPs) are present. In addition, a hepatitis delta virus genomic segment studied previously allowed direct comparison to the FAST software (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig. S5</ref>) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Pang et al., 2011</ref>). These RNAs had lengths up to 400 nucleotides, significantly longer than the 100-nt EteRNA designs (<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>). Despite this increase in length, the band annotation results from the proposed method were still consistent with the reference expert annotation. Excluding an abnormal result from the Tetrahymena ribozyme caused by an experimental issue that disallowed alignment of sequencing ladders, the maximum of MSE is only 0.68. Furthermore, the two worst MSE values (0.68 and 0.63) and two lowest E-scores (0.83 and 0.90) coincide in the results for RNA puzzle 6 (an adenosylcobalamin riboswitch) and tRNA(phe), confirming E-score's utility.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Discussion</head><p>The proposed method for band annotation is unique in its ability to take into account all available CE profiles; prior methods (such as those available in QuShape and FAST) have focused on a single profile at a time with a reference profile if needed. The distinctive robustness of the proposed method is primarily attributed to this capability to integrate information across profiles. The method does require an accurate alignment of all profiles prior to band annotation. Our prior work (<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Yoon et al., 2011</ref>) described a different dynamic programming algorithm to accomplish this preceding alignment based on standards co-loaded with each sample. In well over 100 datasets analyzed here, we saw only one case where interprofile alignment was problematic (Tetrahymena ribozyme) and required manual intervention. Therefore, our alignment and annotation results herein confirm that all steps, including alignment and annotation, of RNA structure mapping CE analysis can now be routinely achieved through automated algorithms. To flag cases with uncertain automated band annotation, we have introduced the E-score for reliability estimation. According to our results, given any dataset for CE analysis, the band annotations with E &gt; 0:97 are almost always reliable and can be safely adopted for final steps of band quantitation, whereas the results with E 0:97 are less likely to reliable. Informally, we have encountered datasets in which even expert annotation is ambiguous and has required special additional experiments (such as co-loading sequencing ladders in the same color as the sample) to resolve (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Tian et al., 2014</ref>). This suggests that automated band annotation cannot improve much further; a valuable development would be reliability estimates for specific subsets of bands rather than a global number. An additional useful development would be use of known band intensities based on prior experiments (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Karabiber et al., 2013</ref>) or on base pair probability estimates, rather than coarse predictions for profiles based on sequence, modifier and a single secondary structure. The proposed algorithm has order of NK time and space complexity, and the practical time demand of band annotation was reasonable in our experiments. The proposed method was implemented in the MATLAB programming environment (The MathWorks, http://www.mathworks.com), and under the experimental setup used (sequential execution on a Intel core i5 4570 processor with 8-GB main memory), the total time demand of annotating bands in all the 95 datasets did not exceed 4 min (for each dataset, mean 2.2837 s; median 2.2707 s).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>In the analysis of CE profiles, band annotation has remained the most time-consuming and error-prone step, due to the lack of robust computational tools for automating the process. Using a dynamicprogramming approach, the proposed algorithm can find an optimal arrangement of bands in a given CE profile, under a scoring schemesuitable for high-throughput CE experiments with multiple profiles. On over 100 CE datasets including designed and biological RNAs, the proposed method identified the band positions matching the reference positions with accuracy sufficiently high as to obviate or significantly reduce manual correction. Finally, the quality of the band positions are well predicted by E-score, flagging unreliable annotations to the user.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig.</head><figDesc>Fig. 1. Overview of the proposed dynamic-programming-based band annotation methodology. Given an RNA sequence, we carry out high-throughput structure-mapping experiments, producing a number of CE traces.

From this information and the characteristics of the chemical probing method used, we derive a prediction matrix that stores expected interaction patterns across the residues and traces. On the basis of the aligned CE traces and prediction matrix, we apply a dynamic-programming approach that finds the optimal selection of the band locations under a welldefined scoring scheme</figDesc></figure>

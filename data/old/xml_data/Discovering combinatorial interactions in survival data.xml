				<p>Motivation: Although several methods exist to relate high-dimensional gene expression data to various clinical phenotypes, finding combinations of features in such input remains a challenge, particularly when fitting complex statistical models such as those used for survival studies. Results: Our proposed method builds on existing &apos;regularization path-following&apos; techniques to produce regression models that can extract arbitrarily complex patterns of input features (such as gene combinations) from large-scale data that relate to a known clinical outcome. Through the use of the data&apos;s structure and itemset mining techniques, we are able to avoid combinatorial complexity issues typically encountered with such methods, and our algorithm performs in similar orders of duration as single-variable versions. Applied to data from various clinical studies of cancer patient survival time, our method was able to produce a number of promising gene-interaction candidates whose tumour-related roles appear confirmed by literature.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>From their inception, high-dimensional genomic data, such as obtained through genome-wide expression microarrays, have been used to identify genes that affects survival or tumour reoccurrence time spans among cancer patients (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bøvelstad et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Van De Vijver et al., 2002</ref>). Survival data generally contain partially known observations (e.g. when clinical follow-up of the patient ends before a decisive event) requiring the use of regression models that can specifically handle censored data. Cox proportional hazards model (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cox, 1972</ref>) is one such model that combines advantages of both parametric and non-parametric approaches to statistical inference, making it ideally adapted to the type of data obtained in clinical trials. Owing to the high dimensionality and small sample size of gene expression data, it is desirable to add a penalization component in fitting the Cox model (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Dudoit et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Ghosh, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Van De Vijver et al., 2002</ref>), with ' 1-norm often preferred for its ability to drive sparsity of the model and select a concise set of variables (gene expression values, mutation types, etc.) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Gui and Li, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Tibshirani et al., 1997</ref>). Different methods have been suggested (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Gui and Li, 2005</ref>;<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Lin and Wei, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Park and Hastie, 2007</ref>) for fitting ' 1-penalized Cox model.<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Park and Hastie (2007)</ref>, in particular, proposed a method to compute the regularization path of ' 1-penalized Cox model, producing a series of Cox models that have different levels of complexity and sparsity. As for many models in systems biology, it has been widely shown (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Tibshirani et al., 2002</ref>) that the gene regulatory pathways of cancer involve non-linear gene interactions. Although models based on linear combinations of gene expression may accurately approximate more complex interactions for some tasks, it can be desirable to specifically identify combinatorial covariates for such purpose as the identification of synthetic lethal genes (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Kaelin, 2005</ref>). However, all current methods rely on the ability to enumerate potential input variables: although it is computationally feasible to examine each single gene in such a way (even for a large microarray), issues of exponential complexity quickly arise when considering interactions between more than one gene at a time. In this article, we extend the approach in Park and Hastie (2007) to handle combinatorial interactions among genes. We deal with issues of combinatorial explosion and computational complexity by taking advantage of itemset mining techniques (<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Uno et al., 2004</ref>). Using this approach, virtually limitless combinations of genes and phenotypes, grouped in itemsets of boolean variables, can be used as single predictor variables in the model. Our proposed algorithm computes the regularization path of ' 1-penalized Cox models that account for the effects of combinatorial gene interactions on survival. Beyond proportional hazards models, our itemset-based method can be applied to any regression model with convex loss, each time making use of the input's structure and sparsity to sidestep complexity issues, while at the same time guaranteeing that events along the regularization path (values of the regularization parameter for which a change occurs in the model structure) are exhaustively explored. *To whom correspondence should be addressed. ß The Author 2013.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">' 1-penalized maximum likelihood estimation</head><p>A common defining feature to many major regression models, such as generalized linear models (GLM) or previously mentioned Cox model, is the use of a loss function to fit the parameters of otherwise analytically intractable problems. Adding an ' 1 penalty term to the original loss criterion results in the typical estimation problem:</p><formula>bðÞ ¼ argmin b ðÀLðy; XbÞ þ k k 1 Þ ð 1Þ</formula><p>where L denotes the log-likelihood function with respect to the given data ðX, yÞ, b is the vector of coefficients that needs to be estimated and the regularization parameter. For values of tending towards infinity, all coefficients in b will be forced to 0, whereas as decreases, more coefficients will have non-null values (i.e more predictor variables will be used in the model estimation).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Regularization path-following algorithm</head><p>Among various methods for solving ' 1-regularized problems similar to (1), the use of so-called 'regularization path-following' algorithms (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Hastie et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Park and Hastie, 2007</ref>) is of particular interest for their ability to finely control the number of active variables in the model, regardless of the dimensionality of the input. The general idea behind path-following is to study variations of the parameter in the space of b coefficient values (see<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>): by decreasing the value of , starting from the maximum max for which b is non-null, we can find a sequence of all discrete values of , for which new coefficients of b change between null and non-null (corresponding to a particular predictor variable exiting or entering the regression model). The resulting sequence of k and associated optimal bð k Þ allow us to model the data at varying levels of sparsity. Park and Hastie (2007) suggested a path-following algorithm for ' 1-regularized GLM that uses a predictor-corrector approach to efficiently find all k and the coefficients of the model associated with each level of regularization. If we define the 'active set', A k , as the set of non-null indices in the coefficient vector bð k Þ, their algorithm can be defined as a loop over four main steps:</p><p>(1) Predict: Starting with a known bð kÀ1 Þ and k : the next target value of , estimate b bð k Þ using a piecewise linear approximation of b, under the assumption that A remains unchanged.</p><p>(2) Correct: Solve the associated convex optimization problem to find the exact value of bð k Þ (using the linear approximation as a warm start).</p><p>(3) Update active set: By confronting the new values of b to the optimality conditions of the problem, update A (i.e. add/remove predictors from the model). Repeat step 3 if necessary to adjust b.</p><p>(4) Decrement : Analytically find the exact value of kþ1 , at which the active set will next change. It is worth noting that, when an ' 1-regularized model is fitted to high-dimensional small sample data, sparse models are usually selected (based on some model selection criteria). Therefore, we do not really have to compute the 'entire' regularization path (from 0 to 0). The algorithm is usually terminated for a value of where the size of the active set A is still much smaller than the input dimension. Because steps 1 and 2 only use variables in the current active set A, they can be performed at little computing cost for values of where jAj remains much smaller than the number of variables. Steps 3 and 4 require solving simple equations for each possible input variable (in linear time of the input's dimension). In their work, Park and Hastie (2007) showed that, along with GLM, their algorithm could also easily be applied to the Cox proportional hazards model. In fact, it can be shown that their results hold for any loss-based model fitting task, provided a loss function that exhibits certain mathematical properties (see section 3 and Supplementary Material).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Finding combinatorial covariates</head><p>When the linear model is extended to combinatorial interaction terms, the input dimension increases exponentially because of the combinatorial explosion of gene interactions. Of the steps enumerated in section 2.2, the predictor and corrector steps only deal with the small subset of covariates currently in the active set A, and therefore do not need to be changed. On the other hand, updating the active set in step 3 and finding the next value of at which an update event will occur in step 4, both potentially require examining a number of feature combinations that grows exponentially with the order of the interactions considered. One practical approach to dealing with issues of combinatorial explosion and computational complexities in steps 3 and 4 is to take advantage of the input's structure to efficiently explore its space. By discretizing our input (gene expressions or otherclinical data) and considering all possible sets of such binary variables, we can use itemset mining techniques (<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Saigo et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Uno et al., 2004</ref>) to preserve the computational efficiency of the path-following algorithm despite a high dimensional input. We show that step 3 can be reduced to a weighted itemset mining problem, easily solvable using existing optimization techniques (see Methods section 3.1.3), whereas step 4 requires solving a particular form of fractional programming problem, for which we developed an efficient pruning approach (see Methods section 3.1.4). Our method can therefore overcome those computational complexity issues, and identify complex interactions (between two or more factors) that contribute to the response model, at varying degrees of sparsity (controlled by the penalization component).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Application to Cox proportional hazards model</head><p>We applied our modified version of the path-following algorithm to the Cox proportional hazards model, where patient survival (or any timed event) is used as a response, allowing for missing data because of right censorship. To estimate this model, we seek to maximize a so-called log partial likelihood function (see Methods section 3.2) for a given set of data. As predictors, we use discretized values of the gene expression levels (see section 4.1).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">METHODS</head><p>In this section, we give a quick overview of the path-following algorithm first presented by Park and Hastie (2007) and the necessary changes to work on combinatorial interactions:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Path-following algorithm</head><p>Let JðbÞ be the criterion from</p><p>(1):</p><formula>JðbÞ :¼ ÀLðy; XbÞ þ jjbjj 1 ð2Þ</formula><p>In the regularization path, we consider the optimal parameter vector b as a function of the regularization parameter , and represent the optimal parameter vector at as bðÞ. We can write the optimality condition as follows:</p><p>HðbðÞ, Þ :¼ @JðbÞ @b j b¼bðÞ ¼ 0 ð3Þ</p><p>Our goal is to compute the path of solutions of (3) for all the. If we only consider the range of where the active set A does not change (noting b A : the restriction of b to the active set A), the partial change of the optimality condition (3) with respect to must satisfy:</p><formula>@HðbðÞ, Þ @ ¼ @H @ þ @H @b A @b A @ ¼ 0 ð4Þ</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1">Predictor step</head><p>In each predictor step, we assume that the current active set, A, does not change. In the k-th predictor step, we use a linear approximation to predict b with the current active set:</p><formula>b b A ð kþ1 Þ :¼ b A ð k Þ þ ð kþ1 À k Þ @b A ðÞ @ j ¼k ð5Þ</formula><p>3.1.2 Corrector step We also assume that the active set A does not change during each corrector step. Any convex optimization algorithm can be used to minimize the penalized loss function (2). The use of b b A ð kþ1 Þ as an initial starting point ensures that an optimal solution can be found in a small number of iterations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.3">Active set update</head><p>After each corrector step, it is necessary to identify all new features that should enter A. If we consider the set P of all possible patterns, up to a given length, of binarized input features (e.g. 'gene A over-expressed and gene B under-expressed') and assign each such pattern an index value, for any ' 2 f1,. .. , jPjg, we note x ' 2 B n (where n is the total number of observations) the indicator vector for the matching pattern. Our goal is to identify such values of ' that contribute to minimize the loss function (2), and for which the matching value of the parameter vector b should be non-null (noted as ' being 'active' and ' being in the 'active set' A). With the feature notation X :¼ fx ij g i, j , we define:</p><formula>w i :¼ À @L @b &gt; x i , c ' :¼ X n i¼1 w i x i' ð6Þ</formula><p>Assuming strong complementarity slackness, we obtain the following result (see Supplementary Material for detailed proof):</p><formula>THEOREM 1. ' is active , jc ' j ¼ ð7Þ</formula><p>Therefore, if jc ' j ! kþ1 after the corrector step, ' (and its associated parameter ' ) must be added to the active set A. If ' were an easily enumerable feature (such as in the case of single gene expression level), it would be computationally feasible to exhaustively enumerate all values of c ' for all possible '. In our case, however, ' can match an arbitrarily long pattern drawn from the power set of all binarized features; the number of such features grows exponentially with the maximum size of the patterns, making the problem highly impractical for sets of42 or 3 items. However, as long as c ' can be rewritten as linear sums of x i' , finding all such ' can be accomplished in reasonable time, using frequent itemset enumeration techniques. Because the values w i in the linear sum defined in (6) do not depend on ' (and are constant for 2 ½ kþ1 , k ), finding all items c ' ! kþ1 is equivalent to finding all itemsets with weighted support above kþ1 (the symmetrical problem of also finding fc ' j À c ' ! kþ1 g is then trivial). To solve this problem, we use the LCM program (http://research.nii.ac.jp/ $uno/codes.htm) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Uno et al., 2004</ref>), which provides an exhaustive enumeration of frequent itemsets in guaranteed polynomial time per itemset. If any variable is added to the active set A, or removed (indices f' 2 Aj ' ¼ 0g), we go back to the corrector step (where the new values of c ' are first recomputed). These two steps are repeated until the active set does not change, thus guaranteeing that the solutions are optimal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.4">Step length To determine</head><p>the optimal step length (the minimal value by which the regularization parameter must be decreased in order for the active set to change), we need to solve a similar problem, this time involving the ratio of two separate frequent itemset mining optimization problems. If we define the step length:</p><formula>Á k ¼ kþ1 À k</formula><p>the minimum decrement of for which the active set A changes (a variable is added or removed), it can be shown (see Supplementary Material for detailed proof) that:</p><formula>THEOREM 2. Á k ¼ À min þ '2A k À c k ' d ' À 1 , k þ c k</formula><p>where min þ is the smallest strictly positive value, d ' :¼ @c' @ and Á nonÀactive are obtained by:</p><formula>Á nonÀactive ¼ min '2A Àb k ' @b ' @ j ¼k À1 " # ð8Þ</formula><p>We note that Á nonÀactive only depends on the variables in the active set and can be easily computed. On the other hand, much like in section 3.1.3, exhaustively computing the values of the first two expressions in (2) for all ' in A is not computationally feasible given the dimension of our input. We designed an exploratory approach using bounds on each subproblem to efficiently prune the search tree and drastically reduce the number of solutions explored. First, we observe that both expressions can be rewritten as optimization problems of the form:</p><formula>min þ '2A p þ P i p i x i' q þ P i q i x i' ð9Þ</formula><p>where 8i : p i , q i 2 R only depend on the variables in the active set A (and can therefore be easily computed) and p , q : constant terms (fÀ k , À 1, k , 1g). We consider a relaxed form of (9), known as unconstrained fractional 0–1 programming, problem (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Hammer et al., 1968</ref>) and frequently encountered in the fields of scheduling or database query optimization (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hansen et al., 1990</ref>):</p><formula>Ã ' ¼ min fxig i 2B n p þ P i p i x i q þ P i q i x i ð10Þ</formula><p>where n is the number of non-zero values for the itemset ' being considered. fp i g i 2 R n and fq i g i 2 R n. Although the general form of this problem is shown to be NP-hard (by association to the well-known NP-complete subset sum decision problem), it has an easy polynomial solution (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Boros and Hammer, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Hammer et al., 1968</ref>) if certain conditions hold. With the following notation, separating positive and negative terms in the sums of p i and q i :</p><formula>8i, p i ¼ p þ i À p À i : p þ i , p À i 40; ~ p þ ' :¼ X p þ i x i' ; ~ p À ' :¼ X p À i x i' 8i, q i ¼ q þ i À q À i : q þ i , q À i 40; ~ q þ ' :¼ X q þ i x i' ; ~ q À ' :¼ X q À i x i'</formula><p>we have the following result: THEOREM 3. For a given itemset ', it is not necessary to explore any supersets of ' if either of the following conditions holds:</p><formula>ð q À ~ q À ' ! 0Þ ^ ð Ã ' ! curminÞ ð q þ ~ q þ ' 0Þ ^ ð Ã ' ! curminÞ</formula><p>where curmin is the current minimum value found by the algorithm up until itemset '. A much faster (Oð1Þ), albeit slightly weaker, pruning condition can also be obtained (see proof in Supplementary Material): THEOREM 4. For a given itemset ', it is not necessary to explore any supersets of ' if either of the following conditions holds:</p><formula>ð q À ~ q À ' ! 0Þ ^ p À ~ p À ' q þ ~ q þ ' ! curmin _ p þ ~ p þ ' q À ~ q À ' 0 ð q þ ~ q þ ' 0Þ ^ p þ ~ p þ ' q À ~ q À ' ! curmin _ p À ~ p À ' q þ ~ q þ ' 0</formula><p>Although this pruning-based method loses some of its efficiency as the regularization parameter decreases and the model becomes less sparse, for the range of values of k treated, it remains well within the reach of standard computing equipment (under a minute on a single 3.2 GHz CPU core).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Application to Cox proportional hazards model</head><p>To demonstrate the potential of our method, we applied it to the Cox model. This model uses survival data of the general form fðx i , y i , i Þg n i¼1 , where x i 2 R d is the vector of risk factors, for instance gene expression levels. In practice the x i used by our method is vector of binary indicators of under-or over-expression (possibly in combination); y i 40 is the time observed (survival until an event or censoring); i 2 f0, 1g is a binary variable indicating whether an event has taken place ( i ¼ 1) or the observation was right censored ( i ¼ 0). The Cox regression model (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cox, 1972</ref>) for the hazard of death at time t can be expressed as: hðtÞ ¼ h 0 ðtÞ expðb &gt; XÞ ð 11Þ where h 0 ðtÞ is the baseline hazard function, b 2 R d is the vector of parameters and X ¼ fX 1 ,. .. , X d g is the vector of risk factor variables with corresponding sample value of x i for the i-th sample. However, it is not necessary to know h 0 ðtÞ to infer the regression parameters, thanks to the use of the log partial likelihood function of the Cox model (<ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Tibshirani et al., 1997</ref>), defined as:</p><formula>LðbÞ ¼ X i:i¼1 b &gt; x i À log X j:yj!yi exp b &gt; x j !!! ð12Þ</formula><p>Refer to the Supplementary Material for the exact computation of the criterion c ' (6) in the case of the Cox proportional model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Gathering synthetic candidates</head><p>To extract as many interaction candidates as possible, while avoiding the risk of overfitting the data, we repeatedly run the path-following algorithm on a randomly chosen subset of the input. It has been shown (<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Meinshausen and Bu¨hlmannBu¨hlmann, 2010</ref>) that the use of such sampling method with regularized methods of variable selection provides a good estimator of the original data. On each run of the algorithm, we keep feature combinations that show a significantly improved predictive power over the linear models (likelihood ratio test P-value 50:01). We aggregate all such combinations and rank them by Kaplan–Meier test P-value to produce a list of candidate interactions positively or negatively affecting the timed outcome. As could be expected, a few combinations will tend to reoccur multiple times across successive iterations of the algorithm, whereas a large number only occurs once or twice. We hypothesized and verified a posteriori (see Supplementary Material) that combinations with low number of occurrences might be overfitting a particular iteration's training subset and have poor generalization power. We therefore set an additional screening thresholds on the list of interactions, keeping only those that occur in at least four (out of 100) iterations. This threshold value was selected as giving the best compromise between ratio of false positives and overall number of interactions found (see details in Supplementary Material). Independent testing shows remarkable stability of the list of selected interactions for a large-enough number of iterations. With our chosen occurrence and P-value thresholds, the final list of variables sees little change after $50 iterations (see plot in Supplementary Material). This trend is also confirmed when using an independent test: none of the rarely occurring combinations added in later iterations turn out to be significant in the test subset. For our experiment, we therefore set the total numberof total iterations to 100, a value that once again seems to offer a good compromise between exhaustivity and the risk of false discovery.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Datasets</head><p>To test our method, we used two datasets publicly available: survival studies of neuroblastoma (<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Oberthuer et al., 2006</ref>) and breast cancer (Van De<ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Vijver et al., 2002</ref>) patients. In both studies, complementary DNA microarray assays of gene expression (10 163 probes for 9878 unique genes and 24 158 probes for 23 031 unique genes, respectively), along with (right-censored) survival data, were available for n ¼ 251 and n ¼ 295 patients, respectively. In both cases, after setting aside a test subset (25% of all instances), the algorithm was iteratively applied on randomized subsets of the training data (95%) in a method similar to the leave-one-out procedure (<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Kearns and Ron, 1999</ref>). For each study, gene expression data were normalized across arrays using standard methods (<ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Yang and Thorne, 2003</ref>), then discretized in two binary classes depending on their distance to the mean () using a threshold proportional to the standard deviation (): genes that are over-expressed (expression value above þ , where is a thresholding parameter, set to 1.5 in this instance) or under-expressed (below À ). To compare the higher-order interactions found by our method with a linear combination search, we ran the original Park and Hastie (2007) algorithm on the same training datasets and ranked the resulting variables found by the order in which they entered the regularized model. These ranks appear in the result tables under the column 'single-variable rank' ('NA', standing for 'not applicable', indicates a variable that did not appear in any of the models fitted by the single-variable version of the algorithm before one of its default termination conditions were reached).<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>) not only features a large number of genes strongly associated with breast cancer prognosis in the medical literature, such as SLC2A3 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Sternlicht et al., 2006</ref>), CA9 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Span et al., 2003</ref>), RAB6B (van't<ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Veer et al., 2002</ref>), BBC3 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Cobleigh et al., 2005</ref>) or KIAA0882 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abba et al., 2005</ref>), many of which do not appear at all in single-variable model fits (see single-variable ranks); it also features interesting examples of synthetic interactions: e.g. the Kaplan–Meier plot for the interaction between BBC3 and KIAA0882 (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 2</ref>) shows perfect prediction of survival of all test samples (P50:0003), compared with the much less significant plot for BBC3 alone (P ¼ 0:03), whereas a strong synthetic effect can be observed with BBC3 over-expressed (logrank P-value: 0.008, see plots in Supplementary Material). Despite the overall small number of samples and difficulties to obtain good generalization power from such small training and test subsets, these results hold fairly well in test. Logrank P-values computed over an independent test subset for all selected combinations show 6 of 9 (66.7%) to be significant (P50:05), with 4 combinations (44%) still significant after Bonferroni correction for multiple-hypotheses testing.</p></div>

Locus BC046178 is associated with CENPW (previously known as C6orf173 or CUG2), a well-studied oncogene associated with apoptotic behaviours in tumour cells (<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Lee et al., 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Lee et al., , 2010</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Model validity and computation time</head><p>Although our goal is primarily not to create a predictor, but to gather input feature combinations (with promising synthetic lethality properties, in the case of cancer studies), we could still confirm that the model estimates produced by our method were sound and consistent with previous methods. Separating the original dataset in a training (75%), model-selection (12.5%) and test (12.5%) subsets and running nested cross-validation (100 iterations at the training level, each evaluated over 100 partitioning of the model-selection and evaluation subsets), we were able to compare the average log partial likelihood for both our algorithm and that of Park and Hastie (2007) (who use a ' 1-penalized path-following algorithm that only selects single variables, hereafter referred to as single-variable algorithm or single-variable model), both on the test subset. Using the breast cancer survival data from Van De Vijver et al.</p><formula>(2002)</formula><p>, our algorithm gave a mean log partial likelihood of À121.00 (SD: 27.56) compared with À117.10 (SD: 26.85) for the single-variable algorithm by Park and Hastie (2007), both significantly (P52:2e À 16) higher than the null model (À123.28, SD: 27.88), where no variables are used. With both algorithms, a large variance in the cross-validated results and overall middling performances are to be expected due to the small sizes of training, model-selection and testing subsets along with the typically high level of noise in microarray data. However, as the validation of the results in section 4.2 shows, there is still enough signal to detect meaningful covariates. Additionally, we ran our algorithm on a randomized version of the breast cancer data, where survival data had been shuffled so as to no longer match its particular gene expression data. Using the same experimental set-up as described in 4.1, the algorithm produced only two significant interactions (P50:05): one of which only occurred once (and therefore would not be selected under normal conditions), whereas the other, with a P-value of 0.03, was no longer significant after Bonferroni correction (correction factor: 36) for multiple-hypotheses testing. This is to be contrasted with the multiple Bonferroni-significant interactions found in regular data (see section 4.2). Computing time, although consistently longer for our algorithm was still within reasonable distance of the single-variable version: with similar termination conditions and the same input data, a single run of our path-following algorithm took on average 55 min (281 s AE 83 s) on a quad-core 3.2 GHz CPU, compared with a little under a minute for Park and Hastie (2007) (36 s AE 6 s).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">CONCLUSION</head><p>In this article, we presented an algorithm to follow the regularization path of any ' 1-regularized linear model fitting, using combinatorial interactions as covariates. Although the path-following method has been applied to microarray data in the past (<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Park and Hastie, 2007</ref>), it was until now only able to deal with single-valued features, ignoring possible higher-order effect of gene interactions. Our method makes uses of existing frequent itemset mining techniques and novel imports from fractional programming to avoid the intractability issues of combinatorial input and produce a regression model of accuracy and run time comparable with the linear case. By running multiple iterations of the algorithm on subsampled datasets, we can produce ordered lists of candidate interactions with strong predicting power. The interactions found by applying our method to cancer study survival data include many genes that could not be found through linear models, yet show up in literature as strongly tied to these conditions, confirming the crucial importance of taking interaction effects into account to detect some of the weaker signal in gene expression data. Although most significant interactions found by our method on experimental data were limited to two or three genes, there are no theoretical limitations to the size of interactions that can be searched, at no particularly higher computational cost, setting this method apart from other recent work on penalized selection of interactions in high-dimensional data (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bien et al., 2012</ref>). The strong noise inherent to gene expression microarray likely prevents the detection of weaker signals between more than three genes, making it an attractive prospect to work with less noisy types of data where larger interactions might be detectable. In the future, we plan to extend our field of application to a wider range of biomedical data, such as the identification of SNP interactions (<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Schwender and Ickstadt, 2008</ref>), as well as leverage our model's ability to deal with heterogeneous input, for example by</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig.1.</head><figDesc>Fig. 1.

			<abstract>
				<p>High-accuracy mass values detected by high-resolution mass spectrometry analysis enable prediction of elemental compositions , and thus are used for metabolite annotations in metabolomic studies. Here, we report an application of a relational database to significantly improve the rate of elemental composition predictions. By searching a database of pre-calculated elemental compositions with fixed kinds and numbers of atoms, the approach eliminates redundant evaluations of the same formula that occur in repeated calculations with other tools. When our approach is compared with HR2, which is one of the fastest tools available, our database search times were at least 109 times shorter than those of HR2. When a solid-state drive (SSD) was applied, the search time was 488 times shorter at 5 ppm mass tolerance and 1833 times at 0.1 ppm. Even if the search by HR2 was performed with 8 threads in a high-spec Windows 7 PC, the database search times were at least 26 and 115 times shorter without and with the SSD. These improvements were enhanced in a low spec Windows XP PC. We constructed a web service &apos;MFSearcher&apos; to query the database in a RESTful manner. Availability and implementation: Available for free at http://webs2. kazusa.or.jp/mfsearcher. The web service is implemented in Java, MySQL, Apache and Tomcat, with all major browsers supported.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Identification or annotation of metabolite peaks detected by mass spectrometers (MSs) is one of the crucial steps in MS-based metabolomic studies (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Saito and Matsuda, 2010</ref>). Accurate mass values measured by high-resolution MS instruments, such as Orbitrap MS and Time-of-Flight MS, are used in calculations of elemental compositions for the peaks and/or the product ions generated in multistage MS (MS n ) analyses (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Feng and Siegel, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rojas-Cherto√©t al., 2011</ref>), by which comprehensive identifications/annotations of metabolites have been reported (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Beale and Sussman, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Bo¬®ttcherBo¬®ttcher et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Iijima et al., 2008</ref>). Several software tools are available for calculation of elemental compositions: HR2 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Kind and Fiehn, 2007</ref>), AutoMFCalculator (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Nakamura et al., 2008</ref>), MassToFormula function of the Chemistry Development Kit (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Steinbeck et al., 2006</ref>) and Molecular Weight Calculator (http://www.alchemistmatt.com/). These tools generate all possible formulae under the condition of user-defined kinds and numbers of atoms (hereafter described as 'atom condition') and return elemental compositions that match the given mass value with the mass tolerance. An advantage of these tools is that users can change the atom conditions for each calculation. A disadvantage is that generations and evaluations of the same formulae cannot be avoided when similar mass values are repeatedly examined. This latent redundancy causes a limitation of the calculation rate when the tools are applied for the large number of mass data detected in metabolomic studies. To raise the throughput of metabolite annotations and then metabolomic data productions, acceleration of the calculation rate of elemental compositions is required. We report here a database approach that remarkably improves the prediction of elemental compositions. Because the atom condition can be fixed for high-throughput surveys, all possible elemental compositions under the atom conditions are calculated and stored in a relational database system. The elemental compositions that match the given mass values with the mass tolerances are searched from the database. Therefore, the latent redundancy occurring in other tools is eliminated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">METHODS</head><p>We chose the following atoms and their maximum numbers in the calculations of all possible elemental compositions‚ÄîC: 100, H: 200, O: 50, N: 10, P: 10, S: 10. The elemental compositions that fulfil the Senior and the Lewis valence rules were selected (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Nakamura et al., 2008</ref>). The formula weights of 400 billion elemental compositions were calculated and stored in a MySQL database (Oracle Corporation) named 'ExactMassDB'. To evaluate the formula-searching performance of our database strategy, the HR2 tool, which is one of the fastest programs for *To whom correspondence should be addressed.formula calculations that we tested (Supplementary<ref type="figure">Fig. S1</ref>), was selected for comparison. As HR2 filters some elemental compositions according to the Seven Golden Rules (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Kind and Fiehn, 2007</ref>), another database 'ExactMassDB-HR2' (EX-HR2), which returns the same results as does HR2, was prepared. The search time was measured by an in-house Java program on Windows PCs. To evaluate the search time, we prepared lists of mass values that consist of 1000 mass peaks and 1000 MS 2 peaks detected by high-resolution MSs in practical analyses (practical mass lists). To help users query their mass values in ExactMassDB, we constructed a RESTful web service named 'MFSearcher' with Apache, Tomcat and MySQL. The web service also provides querying functions for other databases, e.g. EX-HR2 database, KEGG, PubChem, KNApSAcK, FlavonoidViewer and a database of possible linear polypeptides. The search time for the MFSearcher web service was measured by querying from several PCs in different countries. Details are described in the Supplementary Material.</p></div>

			<note place="foot" n="123"> times (Table 1). The creation of an index for the formula weight column of the MySQL table contributed to the reduction of the search time; however, it was still at the same level as HR2 at 5 ppm mass tolerance (Supplementary Table S1). The search time was largely dependent on the record numbers found, and hence on the mass tolerance (Supplementary Figs. S1‚ÄìS4). A drastic improvement of the search rate was observed when the records of EX-HR2 were sorted by formula weight (Supplementary Table S1 and Fig. S4). It was speculated that the minimization of time for searching record data on the hard disk drive contributed to the reduction of the search time. This is proven by a further remarkable speed-up (488‚Äì1833 fold) when a solid-state drive (SSD) was applied (Table 1). These improvements were enhanced in a lower-spec Windows XP PC (Machine B) (Supplementary Tables S1‚ÄìS3). The search time of HR2 was largely dependent on the evaluated formula number during the calculation (Supplementary Fig. S5). A parallel execution of HR2 by threads reduces the total search time for a mass list, although it requires higher CPU occupations (Supplementary Fig. S7). EX-HR2 was still 26‚Äì29 times faster than HR2 executed with threads in the Windows 7 PC (8 threads), and 55‚Äì61 times faster in the Windows XP PC (2 threads) (Table 1, Supplementary Table S2). In a practical usage of EX-HR2, further speed-up was expected by the cache of MySQL and the OS (Supplementary Table S3 and Figure S8). Searching with the MFSearcher web service needs a longer time than those on the PCs, but was still faster than HR2 as far as we tested, except for the search at 5 ppm mass tolerance from Peru (Supplementary Table S4). A high-throughput prediction of elemental compositions by our database approach will improve comprehensiveness and throughput of annotations of metabolite peaks, and so will accelerate metabolomic data productions. For example, our approach boosts the analysis of elemental compositions of MS n fragments, which is one of the perspective strategies towards semi-automatic de novo identification of metabolites (Rojas-Cherto√©t al., 2011). Other tools such as HR2 are nevertheless powerful for thorough investigation of a small number of metabolites by searching various atom settings. Our database approach can be complementary with all these other tools.</note>

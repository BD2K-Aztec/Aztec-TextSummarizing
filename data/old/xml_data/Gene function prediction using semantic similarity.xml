				<p>Motivation: Functional genomics data provides a rich source of information that can be used in the annotation of the thousands of genes of unknown function found in most sequenced genomes. However, previous gene function prediction programs are mostly produced for relatively well-annotated organisms that often have a large amount of functional genomics data. Here, we present a novel method for predicting gene function that uses clustering of genes by semantic similarity, a naïve Bayes classifier and &apos;enrichment analysis&apos; to predict gene function for a genome that is less well annotated but does has a severe effect on human health, that of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Results: Predictions for the molecular function, biological process and cellular component of P.falciparum genes were created from eight different datasets with a combined prediction also being produced. The high-confidence predictions produced by the combined prediction were compared to those produced by a simple K-nearest neighbour classifier approach and were shown to improve accuracy and coverage. Finally, two case studies are described, which investigate two biological processes in more detail, that of translation initiation and invasion of the host cell. Availability: Predictions produced are available at http://www .bioinformatics.leeds.ac.uk/∼bio5pmrt/PAGODA</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>The massive improvements in DNA sequencing technology have led in the past decade to ever more genomes being sequenced. Most newly sequenced genomes contain a large number of genes whose function cannot be inferred through conventional homology methods such as BLAST and annotating the function of these genes has been aided in recent years by the production of large high-throughput datasets. These datasets can be based on genomic sequence data * To whom correspondence should be addressed. using methods such as gene fusion (<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Marcotte et al., 1999</ref>) and phylogenetic profiles (<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Pellegrini et al., 1999</ref>) or they can be derived from experimental methods such as yeast two-hybrid screens and microarray expression (<ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Troyanskaya et al., 2003</ref>). However, these datasets are often noisy and incomplete, which can often lead to problems of low reliability and limited coverage when the data are used to predict gene function. To address these problems, several gene function prediction programs have been produced that combine multiple datasets using machine learning techniques to create synergistic predictions, see the review of MouseFunc for examples (<ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Pena-Castillo et al., 2008</ref>). Most of these programs rely on a 'guilt by association' approach where a query protein's function is inferred from annotated proteins with 'similar' biological attributes. Many different approaches have been taken but they can effectively be split into either supervised or unsupervised learning methods. With a supervised approach, a training dataset is created from which an algorithm learns a set of rules that can then be used to predict the most likely annotation of a gene absent from the training set. Alternatively, an unsupervised approach can be taken where the data are separated into multiple clusters. Then, for each cluster, a statistical test is applied to see whether a cluster is overrepresented with a particular annotation. Functions can be defined using several different databases but the most popular is the Gene Ontology (GO;<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Ashburner et al., 2000</ref>). The GO database is structured as a directed acyclic graph, in which the terms form a hierarchy where more specific GO terms also inherit the more general terms above them. Early attempts at gene function prediction often overlooked these high levels of similarity between terms, but more recently programs have attempted to address this problem particularly by the inclusion of semantic similarity measures. Unfortunately, these programs all have drawbacks.<ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Tao et al. (2007)</ref>could only produce predictions for genes that already have an annotation, while<ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Yu et al. (2005) and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Pandey et al. (2009)</ref>both use a semantic similarity measure but only with a relatively simple K-nearest neighbour (KNN) classifier approach and only using microarray and protein–protein interaction data. Also, these two papers limit themselves to human and Saccharomyces cerevisaie, both organisms which have relatively well-annotated genomes. Gene function prediction programs for organisms that are less well annotated but have significant effects on humans, such as the<ref type="bibr">[</ref>causative agent of the most deadly form of malaria Plasmodium falciparum, are few. The sparse annotation of such genomes and, thus, lack of training data makes predicting gene function more challenging. Therefore, in this article, we collate a large, disparate collection of datasets for P.falciparum and present a novel method for gene function prediction that attempts to address this problem. Our program contains three steps: (i) clustering genes using a semantic similarity measure into functional clusters; (ii) calculating the probability that a pair of genes belong to the same functional cluster using a Bayes classifier; (iii) using these probabilities, we employ an enrichment analysis algorithm to predict the function of the gene. We call this program PAGODA (Protein Assignment by Gene Ontology Data Associations).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Measuring gene functional similarity</head><p>Plasmodium falciparum gene function was described using annotations from the GO database, which separates function into three categories: molecular function, biological process and cellular component. Measuring gene function similarity involved a two-stage process. First, the relationships between all GO terms within a GO category were quantified using a semantic similarity measure developed by<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Lord et al. (2003)</ref>, based on the method of Resnik (1999). Here, the similarity of two GO terms is based on the proportion of P.falciparum proteins that are annotated with the most specific shared parent term of these two terms. More formally, this is known as the probability of the minimum subsumer</p><formula>P ms (t 1 ,t 2 ) = min t∈A(t 1 ,t 2 ) {P(t)} (1)</formula><p>The P ms is calculated for both the most specific terms annotated to each protein and the parent terms as well, and from it the semantic similarity score between two terms is calculated as in below equation</p><formula>S(t 1 ,t 2 ) =−lnP ms (t 1 ,t 2 ) (2)</formula><p>In this way, annotations that are very close to each other on the GO graph but biologically dissimilar, e.g. the two organelles: the mitochondrion (GO:0005739) and the apicoplast (GO:0020011), which share seven out of eight parent GO terms, are given a low similarity score. For our purposes, the similarity score was normalized between zero and one by dividing by the highest similarity score possible in that GO category. Second, we used the GO term semantic similarity measures to calculate functional similarity between the two genes based on the method of<ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Wang et al. (2007)</ref>, where for two genes G 1 and G 2 annotated with GO term sets T 1 and T 2 , respectively, where</p><formula>T 1 = {t (1)</formula><p>i , i= 1, …, n} and T 2 = {t</p><formula>(2) j , j = 1</formula><p>, …, m}, the gene function similarity of the two genes is defined below</p><formula>S(G 1 ,G 2 ) = 1 (n+m) n i=1 max t (2) ∈T 2 {S(t (1) i ,t (2) )}+ m j=1 max t (1) ∈T 1 {S(t (2) j ,t (1) )} (3)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Clustering genes of similar function</head><p>To address the problem of sparse function annotation, we clustered genes with similar GO annotations together. When clustering the data, it is important to balance the need for the most detailed prediction possible with the demand for sufficient training data, which leads to the prediction of fewer and broader functional classes. Here, we approach this issue by clustering genes at different levels of specificity, using the DFMAX clique detection algorithm (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Carraghan and Pardalos, 1990</ref>), into clusters of similar function where all gene pairs in each cluster have a gene function similarity greater than a certain threshold. Eight thresholds ranging from 0.1 to 0.8 in 0.1 increments produced eight specificity levels for each GO category. Annotations that were inferred without any manual curation [genes with evidence code: Inferred from Electronic Annotation (IEA)] were excluded owing to their low reliability. Each cluster was then assigned a functional label, which was derived by finding the most specific GO term(s) shared by each gene in that cluster.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Bayes classifier</head><p>Creating clusters of similar function allowed us to calculate the probability that two genes belong to the same functional cluster. We calculated this probability using a Bayes classifier and eight different P.falciparum datasets, all of which have been shown to predict gene function (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Brehelin et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Pena-Castillo et al., 2008</ref>). A combined prediction using all these eight data types was then produced using a naïve Bayes classifier, which treats each data source as independent and is widely acknowledged as excellent for such data integration tasks. Our classifier was implemented using the Bayesian Network Toolbox for Matlab (<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Murphy, 2001</ref>), and we used the maximum likelihood algorithm to learn the model parameters. In this study, all continuous variable distributions (Bozdech and Affymetrix microarray, mass spectrometry, gene neighbourhood, gene conservation and domain) were modelled as Gaussian, while the class node, interaction and gene fusion nodes were discrete. For each dataset, a measure was produced indicating the similarity between the two genes. The detail of how the data for each method was collated and formatted for input into the Bayes classifier, and the measure used to indicate similarity, are outlined below.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1">Sequence domains</head><p>Each protein sequence was queried against the InterPro database (<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Mulder et al., 2007</ref>) using InterPro scan (<ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Quevillon et al., 2005</ref>). Then, for each protein pair the proportion of different domains shared between the two proteins was calculated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2">Gene neighbourhood</head><p>Genes that are found in close proximity to each other on the genome have been shown to be more likely to share the same function (<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Overbeek et al., 1999</ref>). The chromosomal location of all P.falciparum genes was downloaded from PlasmoDB (<ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Stoeckert et al., 2006</ref>). The smallest distance between the two genes was then calculated and divided by the total length of the chromosome on which the genes resided. Genes that resided on different chromosomes were assigned a value of 0.5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.3">Gene conservation</head><p>Proteins that exist in the same biological complex or pathway are likely to be co-conserved across a wide set of organisms, i.e. genes that share similar patterns of gene conservation and gene loss are more likely to be functionally related (<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Pellegrini et al., 1999</ref>). Gene conservation data (also known as phylogenetic profiles) were collated from the Prolinks database (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bowers et al., 2004</ref>), in which the conservation of each P.falciparum gene is calculated across 83 organisms. The confidence score produced by Prolinks was used to indicate the similarity of the two genes' patterns of conservation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.4">Gene fusion Two distinct genes involved</head><p>in the same biological process in one organism are sometimes found fused into a single gene in another organism (<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Marcotte et al., 1999</ref>). Gene fusion data were taken from Date and Stoeckert (2006), where 163 completely sequenced eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes were mined for incidences of gene fusion events. A binary score was used to indicate whether a gene fusion event had occurred in another organism between the gene pair.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.5">Microarray expression</head><p>Microarray data were split into two different types (Bozdech and Affymetrix) depending on the microarray used to obtain the results. The Bozdech microarray data were created using a custom-made 2-channel DNA microarray, and measured the expression profiles across 48 individual 1-h time-points from the asexual blood stage of the HB3 strain (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bozdech et al., 2003</ref>). Affymetrix microarray data consisted of expression Page: 2433 2431–2437</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gene function prediction in Plasmodium falciparum</head><p>profiles across 38 experiments from the gametocyte, sporozoite and asexual blood stage (<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Le Roch et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Young et al., 2005</ref>) of the parasite's life cycle. Co-expression between a pair of genes for both microarray sets was measured by calculating the Pearson's correlation coefficient.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.6">Mass spectrometry</head><p>The peptide counts from P.falciparum mass spectrometry experiments for the asexual blood stage and the gametocyte stage (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Florens et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Lasonder et al., 2002</ref>) were combined. Mass spectrometry experiments on the sexual stage, the asexual blood stage, gametocyte, ookinete, oocyst and sporozoite stage of P.berghei were also included by mapping the P.berghei proteins to their corresponding P.falciparum orthologs (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Khan et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Le Roch et al., 2004</ref>). Owing to the difficulty of detecting proteins at low concentrations, the data consisted of a significant number of zero counts. We, therefore, found the Manhattan distance to be the most appropriate correlation measure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.7">Protein–protein interactions</head><p>Interaction data for P.falciparum were downloaded from the IntAct database (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hermjakob et al., 2004</ref>). Two proteins were deemed not to interact if their interaction was absent from the IntAct database and a binary score was then used to indicate whether or not the two proteins interacted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Gene set enrichment</head><p>The Bayes classifier calculates the probability of a pair of genes belonging to the same functional cluster, and this can be applied to a query gene and a set of genes of known function. The next step is to exploit this information and assign a function or functions to the query gene. To do this, we assume that the functional cluster to which the query gene belongs is likely to be associated with gene pairs with the highest probabilities, in other words, the cluster should be 'enriched' with gene pairs of higher probability. To calculate this 'enrichment' factor for each cluster, we adapt an algorithm originally designed to perform a similar such calculation for a group of genes in the microarray data, the Gene Set Enrichment Algorithm (GSEA;<ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Subramanian et al., 2005</ref>). The schematic of this GSEA prediction process is outlined in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. At a given specificity level that contains the query gene and N other genes, the training set is created by using all gene pairs at that level which belong to the same functional cluster and an equal number of randomly chosen gene pairs that do not belong to the same functional cluster. A test set is then produced, consisting of N gene pairs, with each gene pair containing the query gene and one of the other genes. The Bayes classifier is then trained on the training set and used to assign the probabilities that the gene pairs in the test set belong to the same functional cluster. We now can calculate the functional cluster to which the query gene most likely belongs. In other words, the functional cluster most enriched among gene pairs with high probabilities. To measure this enrichment score (ES), the gene pairs (g j ) are ranked in descending order of probability. A running sum statistic is then calculated as follows: the list is descended and at each step and for all the functional clusters; a score is calculated that the gene belongs to the functional cluster (L cluster ) and does not (L not_in_cluster ) as shown in Equations (4) and (5). The running sum statistic is then L cluster –L not_in_cluster.</p><formula>L cluster = g j ∈S,j≤i P j N p where N p = g j ∈S P j (4)</formula><p>where P j is the probability that the pair of genes are in the same cluster.</p><formula>L not_in_cluster = g j / ∈S,j≤i 1 N not_in_cluster (5)</formula><p>where N not_in_cluster is the number of gene pairs not in the cluster. The ES for the cluster is then the maximum deviation of the running sum statistic from zero achieved during the process (the ES will be positive if the cluster is enriched and negative if it is impoverished).The ES is affected by the number and magnitude of the probabilities of the gene pairs assigned to each cluster, so to allow comparison between ES scores a normalized ES (NES) is produced. To calculate this, the ranked gene pair list is permuted (i.e. the probabilities in the list are randomly distributed across the gene pairs) and a random ES calculated. This is repeated 1000 times and the original ES divided by the mean random ES to give the NES. The NES score was calculated for all clusters at the given specificity level and the cluster with the highest NES score used as the prediction of the gene's function.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">RESULTS</head><p>To assess our method, a leave one out cross-validation procedure was performed for each GO category on all P.falciparum genes with a GO annotation (excluding IEAs). Plasmodium falciparum genes whose functions can be inferred from annotated orthologous proteins were also excluded where orthologs were defined by the OrthoMCL (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chen et al., 2006</ref>). A prediction was defined as a success if the NES score of the annotated function was one of three highest for that specificity level. Coverage was defined as the proportion of total number of genes for which a prediction could be made at that specificity level. Accuracy and coverage are shown for classifiers based on each dataset separately and all datasets combined are shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>, and given in Supplementary Tables 1–3. As expected,<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>shows that generally PAGODA achieves a greater degree of success with more general clusters, partly because there are fewer clusters to classify into but also because more genes are clustered at the more general levels and, therefore, more data are available to inform the prediction. The protein–protein interaction data, consisting mainly of the yeast two-hybrid data of<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">LaCount et al. (2005)</ref>, produced poor results and the quality of this dataset has been previously questioned (<ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Wuchty and Ipsaro, 2007</ref>). The most accurate methods were the domain and gene conservation methods, although the former achieved ∼60% coverage and latter only ∼15%. The combined method, which uses the predictions of all the other methods, achieved the highest coverage but not the highest accuracy. This is likely to be due to the ability of the combined method to predict the function of genes for which only sparse data are available but at the cost of decreased confidence in the prediction. The result is that the overall accuracy of the combined method is reduced.the three different GO classes. Each letter denotes the use of a single separate data source to make predictions and results for the combined data sources are also shown (f = Affymetrix, b = Bozdech, d = domain, c = gene conservation, u = gene fusion, n = gene neighbourhood, m = mass spectrometry, p = protein–protein interactions and a = combined) and the number represents the specificity level with one being the most general and eight being the most specific. A different coloured oval is used for each method to show where the majority of the methods results are (black = Affymetrix, blue = Bozdech, dark green = domain, orange = gene conservation, purple = gene fusion, grey = gene neighbourhood, red = mass spectrometry, yellow = protein– protein interactions, light green = combined).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Page: 2435 2431–2437</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gene function prediction in Plasmodium falciparum</head><p>Accuracy and coverage for each method are remarkably similar for molecular function and biological process, although corresponding numbers for cellular component are slightly higher. To complement the results for each separate dataset shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 2</ref>, we also investigated the performance of classifiers omitting each of the datasets in turn from the combined dataset. We found that with the exception of domain data, there was no dataset whose omission significantly reduced or increased the performance (omission of domain data reduced performance measures by 5–10%). This shows that the use of a large number of datasets leads to substantial redundancy in information, and that the classifier is robust to the inclusion of less predictive datasets. We then investigated the functional clusters most accurately predicted by PAGODA (accuracy defined as where at least threequarters of predictions for that cluster are in the top 3). Molecular function, biological process and cellular component were more accurate for the most specific clusters (Supplementary Tables 4–6). This is contrast to the overall accuracy of PAGODA, which performs better at more general clusters. This, in part, may be due to the small number of proteins in the clusters at these levels, therefore, meaning only a couple of genes needed to be predicted correctly for the cluster to be counted as accurately predicted, but can most probably be explained by a small number of highly specific functional clusters for which predictions are particularly accurate. This was especially true for molecular function compared with biological process and cellular component. Although the well-predicted clusters covered a wide range of functions, functions and processes relating to translation, DNA replication, processes involving RNA, and invasion and interaction with the parasite's host seemed to be particularly well predicted. We then examined GO clusters that were predicted accurately by multiple datasets (defined as three or more) as shown in Supplementary Tables 7–9. PAGODA predicted the most GO clusters in molecular function and showed a preference for predicting smaller, more specific, GO clusters. Significantly, fewer clusters were predicted in biological process and cellular component (cellular component = 32, biological process = 36, molecular function = 60) and more general functional clusters were preferred. More specifically, in the biological process category, PAGODA predicts most accurately proteins involved in the processing of RNA and proteins involved with cell invasion and interaction with cells in the host wall, while in the cellular component category, proteins in or near chromosomes and proteins in the translation initiation complexes were best predicted.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Case study: translation initiation factors and erythrocyte invasion</head><p>The translation of mRNA into proteins proceeds through the three major steps of initiation, elongation and termination. Translation initiation involves the binding of the Met-tRNA to the small ribosomal subunit, and then this to the mRNA followed by the joining of the large ribosomal subunit (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Acker and Lorsch, 2008</ref>). To perform this, a large number of eukaryotic translation initiation factors (TIFs) are required. The number of proteins required for translation initiation varies between species, with many of the TIFs being multi-subunit proteins (<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Rodnina and Wintermeyer, 2009</ref>). Also, Plasmodium is particularly unusual in expressing different rRNAs at different stages of its life cycle with P.falciparum producing asexual and sporozoite rRNA (<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">McCutchan et al., 1995</ref>). The precise proteins involved in translation is still not well understood and the difficulty of experimentally verifying annotations in Plasmodium has meant the TIF annotations in P.falciparum have mostly be assigned by homology methods, with certain TIF believed to exist but yet to be identified (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Ginsburg, 2006</ref>). Proteins involved in translation in P.falciparum were predicted accurately by several of the datasets in PAGODA (Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#tab_0">Table 10</ref>) with 10 of the 12 TIFs in P.falciparum correctly predicted by the combined method in PAGODA. Therefore, we investigated the proteins involved in translation initiation to see if PAGODA could improve the current annotations for TIF in P.falciparum. Another well predicted but far from completely understood process in P.falciparum is the invasion of the host cell. A similar process to that described below for translation initiation was also conducted and is outlined in Supplementary Materials. We describe 19 genes that are likely to be involved in invasion of the host cell and investigate 3 of these genes in more detail. PAGODA was run for biological process at level 6 specificity, the level of the functional cluster translational initiation (GO:0006413), on genes that did not have a manually curated GO biological process annotations in GeneDB (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Hertz-Fowler et al., 2004</ref>). Genes that were predicted to be TIFs with an NES &gt; 2 (this corresponded to 4.53% of genes at this level) and included at least one gene pair with a probability greater than 0.85 were extracted and this produced a list of 18 genes (Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 11</ref>) most likely to be involved in translation initiation. Encouragingly, five of these genes are already annotated as ribosomal genes (PF13_0228, PFC0775w, MAL13P1.209, PF13_0268 and PF14_0230) using the non-manually curated IEAs and one protein (PF10_0103) had also been putatively annotated as a TIF in the most recent GeneDB annotations, corroborating our predictions. Proteins involved in translation often show highly correlated patterns of expression (<ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Webb and Westhead, 2009</ref>) and in P.falciparum the microarray-based methods, especially the Bozdech microarray data, are the most informative in predicting the annotated TIFs. This high level of correlation is also seen in the 18 proteins predicted to be involved in translation initiation, e.g. for the hypothetical protein PFL0155c, seven of the eight most correlated genes in the Bozdech microarray data are proteins involved in translation (Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>and Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 12</ref>). Three RNA helicases are also in the list of 18 proteins predicted to be involved in translation initiation. RNA helicases unwind RNA strands and are known to be involved in translation (<ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Sonenberg and Hinnebusch, 2009</ref>). Again, with these RNA helicases we see high levels of correlation with proteins involved in translation, e.g. 7 out of the 10 genes most correlated with the RNA helicase PFB0445c in the Bozdech microarray data are genes involved in translation and all are correlated with a Pearson's correlation coefficient greater than 0.95 as shown in<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>. One of the most interesting proteins predicted to be involved in translation initiation is the protein PFD0880w. PlasmoDB annotates the protein as a proteasome regulatory component, possibly because the protein contains the Proteasome component region domain (IPR000717). The Plasmodium biological pathway database Malaria Parasite Metabolic Pathways (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Ginsburg, 2006</ref>) agrees with this annotation and annotates the protein as a lid subunit of the proteasome, involved in the proteasome-mediated proteolysis of Page: 2436 2431–2437subunit, putative 0.964 PFE0350c 60S ribosomal protein L4, putative 0.963 PF13_0316 40S ribosomal protein S13, putative 0.962 PF10_0264 40S ribosomal protein S2B, putative 0.961 PFD0770c 60S ribosomal protein L15, putative 0.961 PF13_0354 Alanine–tRNA ligase, putative 0.961 PFL0330c RNA polymerase III subunit, putative 0.958 ubiquinated proteins. Despite PAGODA, using domain information it does not predict the protein to be involved in protein degradation but instead predicts the protein to be involved in translation initiation, based on other TIF containing that domain (PFL0310c and PFE01405c), strong correlation with other TIF in the Bozdech microarray (r &gt; 0.95) and Affymetrix microarray (r &gt; 0.91) data. To evaluate our prediction, we performed a BLAST search of PFD0880w against Swiss-Prot and also looked at the fold of the protein using GenTHREADER (<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">McGuffin and Jones, 2003</ref>). BLAST results showed strong sequence similarity to Eukaryotic TIFs 3 subunit m (E-value = 3 ×10 −30 ). This protein was also originally annotated as a proteasome protein until Zhou et al.</p></div>

This role in allowing certain mRNAs to be translated is corroborated by the fold of the protein, which is predicted to be a three-domain protein consisting of the Anticodon-binding domain (SCOP ID = b.40.4.1), GAD domain (SCOP ID = d.74.4.1) and Class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase-like, catalytic domain (SCOP ID = d.104.1.1). GenTHREADER predicts only two other P.falciparum proteins with this fold, both of which are involved in translation (the asparagine–tRNA ligase PFE0715w and phenylalanyl–tRNA synthetase subunit PFF0180w). Both these proteins are involved in joining tRNA molecules to their specific amino acid suggesting PFD0880w/ETIF3m may have a similar role.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Comparison with existing P.falciparum gene function prediction</head><p>Most attempts to predict gene function in P.falciparum either rely on just one source of data (<ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Zhou et al., 2005b</ref>) or do not produce a combined prediction through a machine learning method (<ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Tedder et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Zhou et al., 2008</ref>). Here, we compare PAGODA with Plasmodraft, a program that predicts the function of unannotated P.falciparum genes (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Brehelin et al., 2008</ref>) using multiple sources of data and combining them using a KNN approach. Direct comparison between gene function prediction programs is difficult, with there being differences in annotation sets (Plasmodraft uses all the GO annotations, while PAGODA excludes IEAs) and differences in the datasets used. However, we attempt to compare the methods by evaluating the accuracy of the programs' most confident predictions for annotated genes. The Plasmodraft website includes a file containing its most confident predictions and these predictions were compared to the high-confidence predictions of the PAGODAcombined method (a high-confidence prediction was defined as a gene that had a NES &gt; 1.5 at any specificity level, with the most detailed prediction taken if the NES was greater than 1.5 at more than one level). The predictions produced by each method were then evaluated against the actual annotations of P.falciparum genes using the<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Lord et al. (2003)</ref>method and the coverage calculated as the number of genes with a prediction divided by the total number of annotated P.falciparum genes for that GO class.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figures 3 and 4</ref>show the mean of these measurements, and as can be seen, PAGODA produces more predictions at a greater accuracy than that of the Plasmodraft.</p></div>

For unannotated genes, a prediction can also be produced. The unannotated query gene is treated as the 'left out' gene in the PAGODA method. The gene IDs of PlasmoDB are used (if the user is unsure of this ID they can search the names, aliases, notes and descriptions of all P.falciparum genes from PlasmoDB on the front page of the PAGODA). Input consists of the gene, the GO class and the specificity level at which to run the prediction program. Once the process is completed the user is presented with a descending list of all the functional clusters at that specificity level and their respective NES scores indicating how likely the gene has that functional annotation.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>Eight years after the sequencing of the P.falciparum genome, the majority of P.falciparum genes remain as unknown function. Gene function prediction programs have shown their ability to work but have been mainly designed for well-annotated model organisms that have large amounts of the training data. In this work. we create a gene function prediction program using a wide range of datasets combined using a novel sophisticated machine learning algorithm. We use a semantic similarity measure on GO annotations, which circumvents the problem of GO annotations that are very close on the GO graph but are biologically speaking quite different. This measure is then used to cluster genes, thereby taking into account the interdependence of GO terms and with the use of the GSEA to remove arbitrary cut-offs, such as those used in KNN approaches, we produce a greater number of predictions with greater accuracy; and with the example of PFD0880w we show that PAGODA can actually improve on the current annotations of P.falciparum many of which are just inferred through sequence similarity.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig.1.</head><figDesc>Fig. 1.

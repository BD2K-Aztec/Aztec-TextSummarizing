				<p>Motivation: Genomes in higher eukaryotic organisms contain a substantial amount of repeated sequences. Tandem Repeats (TRs) constitute a large class of repetitive sequences that are originated via phenomena such as replication slippage and are characterized by close spatial contiguity. They play an important role in several molecular regulatory mechanisms, and also in several diseases (e.g. in the group of trinucleotide repeat disorders). While for TRs with a low or medium level of divergence the current methods are rather effective, the problem of detecting TRs with higher divergence (fuzzy TRs) is still open. The detection of fuzzy TRs is propaedeutic to enriching our view of their role in regulatory mechanisms and diseases. Fuzzy TRs are also important as tools to shed light on the evolutionary history of the genome, where higher divergence correlates with more remote duplication events. Results: We have developed an algorithm (christened TRStalker) with the aim of detecting efficiently TRs that are hard to detect because of their inherent fuzziness, due to high levels of base substitutions, insertions and deletions. To attain this goal, we developed heuristics to solve a Steiner version of the problem for which the fuzziness is measured with respect to a motif string not necessarily present in the input string. This problem is akin to the &apos;generalized median string&apos; that is known to be an NP-hard problem. Experiments with both synthetic and biological sequences demonstrate that our method performs better than current state of the art for fuzzy TRs and that the fuzzy TRs of the type we detect are indeed present in important biological sequences. Availability: TRStalker will be integrated in the web-based TRs Discovery Service (TReaDS) at</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><ref type="figure">Tandem</ref><p>Repeats (TRs) are multiple (two or more) duplications of substrings in the DNA that occur contiguously, and may involve some base mutations (such as substitutions, insertions and deletions). TRs of several forms (satellites, microsatellites, minisatellites and others) have been studied extensively because of their role in several biological processes. In fact, TRs are privileged targets in activities such as fingerprinting or tracing the evolution of populations (<ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kelkar et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Vogler et al., 2006</ref>). Several diseases, disorders and addictive behaviors are linked to specific TR loci (<ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Wooster et al., 1994</ref>). The role of TRs has been studied also within coding regions (O'<ref type="bibr">Dushlaine et al., 2005</ref>) and in relation to gene functions (<ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Legendre et al., 2007</ref>). Large scale comparative studies on TRs of the human genome are described in<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Ames et al. (2008)</ref>and<ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Warburton et al. (2008)</ref>. Data Bases of repetitive elements * To whom correspondence should be addressed. such as RepBase (<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Jurka et al., 2005</ref>) and Tandem Repeats Database (TRDB) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gelfand et al., 2007</ref>) are now available; and the detection of repetitive elements via library-based similarity matching, for example by using the tool Repeatmasker (<ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Smit et al., 2004</ref>), is a popular practice. However, tools for ab initio detection of repetitive elements that are not based on prior knowledge accumulated in data bases are still important in order to extend our comprehension of the role of TRs in biological mechanisms. Existing ab initio tools are successful when the TR exhibits a moderate amount of divergence and when the TR is easily validated. However, there is an emerging need for new tools that are able to cope with higher levels of sequence divergence and/or TR computationally more difficult to validate. For example,<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Boeva et al. (2006)</ref>study so called Fuzzy TRs and their role in gene expression. The technique in<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Boeva et al. (2006)</ref>works well for the Hamming metric (only substitutions and no insertions/deletions allowed) and for short repeat units (from 3 to 24 bp) that are common in micro-and mini-satellite families. Some of the most successful ab initio tools, such as TRF (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Benson, 1999</ref>) and ATRHunter (<ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Wexler et al., 2005</ref>), are based on a multistage filtering approach [see also (<ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Peterlongo et al., 2009)]</ref>. In the first stage the input sequence is analyzed to detect, via statistical criteria, likely position and length of candidate subsequences. The final stage is the validation one in which a more expensive test is applied to candidate substrings passing the first stages, so to determine an output that matches the implicit definition of TR and the user-defined filtering parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.1">Our contribution</head><p>Our contribution is a novel multi-stage filtering algorithm, called TRStalker, for finding long fuzzy TRs under the edit distance, that introduces new techniques (w.r.t. previous TR finding algorithms) in all stages. For the first stage, where over-represented distances between probes are sought, we employ gapped q-grams (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Burkhardt and Kärkkäinen, 2003</ref>) in place of the standard ungapped q-grams in order to collect evidence on the candidate substrings. Gapped qgrams have been used before in the context of textual and biological database searching, but less so in the area of TRs detection [with the exception of the system TEIRESIAS (<ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Stolovitzky et al., 1999)]</ref>. Because of errors due to insertion/deletions, the period of a TR is subject to fluctuations, thus we employ a weighting scheme with exponential decay so to reinforce the signal even in presence of this smearing effect. Finally, we use ranking instead of thresholds when deciding the substrings to pass to the next phases, in order to concentrate the computational effort on the zones with candidates with higher weight. For the final validation stage we employ an NP-complete definition of TR involving the concept of generalized median string under edit distance (de la<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Higuera and Casacuberta, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Sim and Park, 2003</ref>), together with an efficient heuristic for computing an approximation of such median string (<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Jiang et al., 2003</ref>) previously not used in a biological context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>TRStalker</head><p>By extensive experimental comparisons of TRStalker with two state-of-the-art tools, namely TRF and ATRHunter, we did find out that TRStalker has consistently better performance for a large range of error and length parameters for the class of fuzzy TRs under edit distance, with a recall ranging from 100 to 60%. Thus TRStalker improves the capability of TR detection for classes of TRs for which existing methods do not perform well. Tests performed on standard evolutionary TRs definitions (verifiable in polynomial time) also show recall performance close to 100%. Incidentally, this result confirms of the power of the new techniques developed for the initial filtering phase.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2">State of the art</head><p>We will briefly survey the state of the art in finding tandem repeats. First we will describe methods that for a given definition of TR are able to find all maximal substrings in the input that match the definition (exhaustive algorithms). Often exhaustive algorithms may not be available, or when available they may be too slow in practice. Thus, several heuristic algorithms have been developed which are shown experimentally to be able to detect a large fraction of TRs efficiently. Note that the time/precision trade-off is severely influenced by the allowed error thresholds. Performance often degrades quickly with increasing error levels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.1">Exhaustive algorithms</head><p>When we allow no error, it is possible to find all maximal exact TRs in a string of length n in time O(n) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Gusfield and Stoye, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Kolpakov and Kucherov, 1999</ref>). When we allow two consecutive repeats to differ by an amount at most k (either in Hamming or in edit distance)<ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Landau et al. (2001)</ref>give exhaustive algorithms running in time O(nk log(n/k)) for Hamming distance, and O(nk logk log(n/k)) for edit distance. A simpler algorithm with the same asymptotic complexity for the edit distance is proposed by<ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Sokol et al. (2007)</ref>. Kolpakov and<ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kucherov (2003)</ref>improved the bound for the Hamming distance to O(nk logk +s) where s is the number of TRs found. For the Hamming distance, Krishnan and Tang (2004) give an exhaustive method running sequentially in time O(n 3 ), that can be easily implemented onto a parallel architecture, since every possible pattern length is searched independently.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.2.2">Heuristic algorithms</head><p>The algorithmic techniques in<ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kolpakov and</ref><ref type="bibr">Kucherov (1999, 2003</ref>) have been extended in the tool mreps (<ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kolpakov et al., 2003</ref>) so to be able to handle approximate TRs (ATRs) under edit distance, with some additional heuristic filtering steps. The tool TRF (Tandem Repeat Finder) developed by<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Benson (1998</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Benson ( , 1999</ref>), based on statistical filtering of zones of DNA likely to contain TRs, is currently one of the standard heuristic methods. ATRHunter by<ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Wexler et al. (2004)</ref>is also based on a statistical filtering approach, placing greater emphasis in techniques for designing thresholds for the quantities of interest. Other proposed heuristics for finding TRs are REPuter (<ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Kurtz and Schleiermacher, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Kurtz et al., 2001</ref>), STRING (<ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Parisi et al., 2003</ref>), TEIRESIAS (<ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Stolovitzky et al., 1999</ref>) and TandemSWAN (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Boeva et al., 2006</ref>). A class of papers (see e.g.<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Brodzik, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Buchner and Janjarasjitt, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Gupta et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Sharma et al., 2004</ref>) tackle the problem of finding TRs as a problem in signal processing theory and usually map the input string into a time-signal in a suitable numerical domain for which several spectral techniques can be used, such as the Periodicity Transform or the Fourier Transform. Other methods use data compression techniques to detect repetitive elements (<ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Rivals et al., 1997</ref>). The methods cited above are rather general since they aim at treating efficiently TRs in a wide range of length values. There is also a large class of methods that are aimed at handling particular or special classes of TRs such as: microsatellites [e.g. IMEx (<ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Mudunuri and Nagarajaram, 2007</ref>)], palindromic repeats [e.g. CRISPFinder (<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Grissa et al., 2007)]</ref>, Variable Length TRs (VLTR) and Multi-period TRs (MPTR) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hauth and Joseph, 2002</ref>) and Variable Number TRs (VNTR) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Sammeth and Stoye, 2006</ref>). Since the focus of our research on TRs at present is on the more classical forms of TRs, we do not dwell longer on them. However, we just note that often methods for MPTR, VNTR, VLTR use standard TR finding as a subroutine, thus our proposed algorithm can increase also the ability to detect such higher order structures. Systematic comparison among TR finding tools and algorithms operating ab initio, that is without support of specific biological data bases has been tackled in recent years (<ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Leclercq et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Saha et al., 2008</ref>). A survey of problems on TRs in the context of evolutionary mechanisms, such as the construction of TR Evolutionary Trees, is proposed in<ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Rivals (2004)</ref>; see also Elemento and Gascuel (2002).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.3">Organization of the article</head><p>The article is organized as follows: in Section 2 we describe at a high level the principles guiding the different phases of the TRStalker algorithm. Section 3 gives a more technical description of key ingredients of TRStalker and discusses the formal definition of fuzzy TR employed. Section 4 describes the experiments devised to demonstrate the capacity of TRStalker in detecting fuzzy TRs, and a few interesting fuzzy TRs found in sequences of biological significance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">APPROACH</head><p>An example: To focus on the main ideas, let us consider the very simple case of Exact TR. Consider an alphabet ={A,C,G,T } of four symbols, and a string X = x 1 x 2 ...x t formed by the concatenation of t strings x i , embedded in a random string Y , where x i = x 1 for all i and |x 1 |=k, thus all replicas of x 1 are of the same length. An ungapped q-gram is a string of q symbols from that appears as a consecutive sequence of q symbols in Y. We aim at discovering k just by looking at the distances between occurrences of homologous (i.e. identical) q-grams in Y. For q-grams in X, the period k will appear at least (k −q+1)(t −1) times as the distance between homologous probes. More generally the distance hk, an integer multiple of k, will appear at least (k −q+1)(t −h) times for each value h = 1...t −1. A gapped q-gram is a sequence of q characters from with additional 'don't care' symbols, also called 'gaps', that appears as a consecutive sequence in Y. For gapped q-grams similar formulae hold. For values of k and t large enough, the period k and its integer multiples will occur more frequently than the expected number of occurrences of any distance of homologous q-grams in a random string, thus the empirical number of occurrences of the value k and its multiples will tend to be in the higher part of a ranking by frequency. This observation holds true as long as the length i359 of the super-string Y is sufficiently limited so that the frequencies generated by the random portion of Y do not overrun the frequencies generated by X. An exact characterization of such a distribution in terms of the parameters k, t, q and |Y | is complex since it can be characterized as the sum of non-independent random variables each with a negative binomial distribution. However we avoid the issue of characterizing exactly such a distribution by:</p><p>(i) splitting the input string into blocks of predefined length and limiting the analysis to each block separately, providing mechanisms to deal with TRs stranded across the block boundaries; (ii) ranking the periods by weighted frequency and exploring only the top L positions (for L = 50 in our experiments). Note that in most cases the top ranking periods not corresponding to TRs will be discarded quickly when the positional density is considered, thus we can be very slack in choosing L without incurring in a computational burden. The choice of block length could be critical too, but experimental results showed that blocks of length within a factor of up to 40 of the length of the TR do work well. For long input, string occurrences of the same q-gram that are too distant are unlikely to be related to a TR, thus we limit the number of pairs of homologous q-grams considered. While scanning each block of the input Y we record for each occurrence of a gapped q-gram in Y its distance to the five preceding and the five following homologous occurrences (10 in total). The high-level pseudocode of TRStalker is shown in the Supplementary Materials while we expose next the key algorithmic choices. Gapped q-grams: The presence of substitutions/insertions/ deletions in X has the effect that many instances of q-grams will be affected by error and a match will be missed, thus reducing the frequency counts for the period k. To cope with this effect, we use gapped q-grams (<ref type="bibr">Kärkkäinen, 2002, 2003</ref>) that are more resilient to the presence of substitutions/insertions/deletions. As suggested by experiments in<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Burkhardt and Kärkkäinen (2002)</ref>, just few gaps are sufficient to be effective, thus we will use the family of all gapped q-grams with three alphabet symbols and at most two gaps. Anti-smear weighting: If q 1 and q 2 are occurrences of homologous q-grams in X at distance k, before the implant of mutations, the effect of insertion and deletions on the positions of the string X between q 1 and q 2 is to alter their distance so that a different period k is detected. The difference k −k is equal to the algebraic sum of number of insertions and deletions in the positions between q 1 and q 2. Assuming that any such position can be an insertion or a deletion independently with the same probability, the random variable k −k is distributed as a sum of independent random variables with values in {+1,−1,0} with mean value 0, thus, by a Chernoff bound argument, its tail distribution decays exponentially (<ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Motwani and Raghavan, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Mulmuley, 1993</ref>). Also near-by probes in X have small variations in the value of the shift k −k. Inspired by the above observation, we devise a weighting scheme that increments the total weight of period k if another period of value ¯ k is discovered in a nearby position, with weights that decay exponentially with |k − ¯ k|.</p><p>The final weight w 0 (k) for a given period k is the sum of the individual anti-smear weights computed above for probes at distance k. Multiplicity weighting: Let w 0 (k) be the weight of the period k as assigned by the anti-smear weighting procedure. As observed before, for a TR with a large number of copies we will find also integer multiples of k with a relatively high frequency. We take advantage of this fact and compute new weights:</p><formula>w 1 (k) = h≥1 w 0 (hk).</formula><p>The candidate periods are then sorted by the weight w 1 (.), and processed in decreasing order. Positional density: We further exploit the property of TRs that the same period is detected by probes in near-by positions. We define a notion of positional k-density, that is the density of probes that contribute to the counter for the candidate period k. We search for position in Y of high k-density as candidates for the starting point of a TR. Validation: In the third phase we take each candidate pair (p,i) and we test explicitly whether there is a TR of period p starting in position i according to the definition (Section 3). In particular when using the definition of a Steiner-STR (Section 3.2) we use a double filtering. The fist filter uses a wraparound dynamic programming technique (WDP;<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Fischetti et al., 1993</ref>). The second filter computes an approximation to the generalized media string [inspired by an algorithm proposed in<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Jiang et al. (2003)]</ref>. In this phase, besides validating the TRs, we discover the (fractional) repetition number of the TRs eventually extracted. Post-processing: As a post-processing, we check for inclusion the TRs found and we filter out those TRs completely enclosed in another one. For TRs in the same position and length but different period we report the TR with shorter period. Finally we align the approximate generalized median string with the TR units so to give a graphical compact output of the TR.</p></div>

Note that condition (a) is vacuous for µ ≥ 1/c. The choice for the constant c depends also on the level of divergence. For low divergence c = 2 is a sensible choice since two copies at distance µ|¯ x| from ¯ x are also at distance at most 2µ|¯ x| from each other by the triangular inequality. Thus (a) is a necessary condition for (b). For higher level of divergence above 30%, the value c = 2 is too loose and we use a lower value c = 1.5, so as to maintain a good filtering ability of condition (a) and to avoid having as a possible solution a TR where the consecutive pairs may have a very irregular divergence.</p></div>

This definition is inspired by the evolutionary model of TRs in which it is assumed that TRs are generated by duplicating the last copy of a previous TR, possibly with duplication errors that truncate it. A k-edit repeat is maximal if it cannot be extended either to the left or to the right without violating its definition. In<ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Wexler et al.

In other words, the TR consists of t duplications of a single consensus string ¯ x with mutations. Such string ¯ x is also called a Steiner motif if ¯ x is not constrained to be equal to some repeat x j. Often in practice ¯ x is chosen as the repeat x j that minimizes the error function, and is called a pivot motif. The distinction is critical since, as mentioned before, Steiner motifs lead to NP-complete recognition problems, while pivot motifs do not. The η-Neighboring ATR (η-NATR) is a string X, so that for each<ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Wexler et al., 2004</ref>). The Pairwise ATR (PATR) is a string X, such that for every pair of indices i,j ∈[1,..t] 2 with i = j we have φ(x i ,x j ) ≥ η ij , where η ij is set to be a monotonically decreasing function of |i−j|, thus allowing more slackness when comparing distant copies of the basic motif. In Krishnan and Tang (2004) it is used a definition similar to that of the NATR, except that the Hamming distance is used and that the threshold is not absolute but relative to the length. A γ-Hamming ATR (γ-HATR) is a string X such that: for each i ∈[1,...t −1], D H (x i ,x i+1 ) ≤|x i |γ. In<ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Stolovitzky et al. (1999)</ref>, a more complex definition is given that takes into account the substring alignment score density function for pairs of random substrings of a given length. Here, the definition of a TR X depends on the properties of the longer string Y into which X is embedded. In particular, a (µ,p)-TR must comply to two conditions:</p><formula>i ∈ [1,..,t −1], φ(x i ,x i+1 ) ≥ η (</formula><formula>(i) t−1 i=0 φ(x i ,x i+1 ) ≥ (t −1</formula><p>)µ, that imposes an average high similarity score for adjacent repeats, and (ii) define α(p,k) as the value of similarity such that there is probability p that two random substrings of length k in Y have similarity above α(p,k). There must be an index q ∈<ref type="bibr">[1,...t]</ref>such that φ(x q ,x j ) ≥ α(p,k) for all j ∈<ref type="bibr">[1,...t]</ref>. Note that this condition limits the dispersion of the similarity with respect to one of the copies (called the pivot). TRF (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Benson, 1999</ref>) uses as final validation algorithm the WDP that tests efficiently the alignments of a given candidate motif with the surrounding portions of the input sequence, so as to determine the maximum number of adjacent repetitions within a user-defined score bound. This implies a notion of TR akin to that of SATRs with pivot motif. Classical results on string alignments (<ref type="bibr">Gusfield, 1997, p. 351</ref>) ensures that, for the metric score given by the sum of motif-repeats distances, the solution found using the optimal pivot motif has a score within a factor (2−1/t) of the score induced by the optimal Steiner motif. For low levels of errors one could use a pivot-SATR definition doubling the error threshold to capture a Steiner-SATR, however for higher error levels (say, above 25%), doubling the error threshold forces the existing systems to work in a range of values (say, above 50%) where most methods do not perform well.</p></div>

An index set I with |I|=q and span(I) = q−1 is called an ungapped qgram since its shape is shape(I) =[0,...q−1]. If we have an index set J with |J|=q and span(J) = s ≥ q we have a gapped q-gram since its shape is formed of non-consecutive integers. In order to generate a population of candidate periods we consider now all possible (q,s)-shapes with q = 3 and s = 4,3,2. Denoting with − the gaps and with # symbols from , (the first and last positions must be always #), we have the (, if we fix an ungapped shape and an error level in Hamming distance, there are error patterns for which every corresponding ungapped q-gram is affected by error. In contrast with the same Hamming error level, for some gapped shapes, there are always some gapped qgrams unaffected by the injected error. Thus using a small complete family of gapped q-grams we can detect the correct period in situations where ungapped q-grams cannot. 1</p></div>

The higher the similarity of the two TRs, the higher should be the score. Since perfect equality is rare we need a more flexible score function. A TR can be characterized by the triple: (b,p,r), where b is the initial position, p the period, r the repetition number. Also, the same TR covers the positions in Y from index b to b+rp−1. We identify the TR with the set of positions Seg(TR) =<ref type="bibr">[b,b+rp−1]</ref>. Given two TRs TR 1 and TR 2 represented as sets of positions, the classical Jaccard coefficient measure of set similarity JC is:</p><formula>JC(TR 1 ,TR 2 ) = |Seg(TR 1 )∩Seg(TR 2 )| |Seg(TR 1 )∪Seg(TR 2 )| .</formula></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.10">Evaluation of recall on biological sequences</head><p>The evaluation has been carried out according to the following procedure. Let T TRS ,T TRF ,T ATR be the set of TRs found by TRStalker, TRF and ATRHunter respectively. First, we removed from every set all the TRs that have a Jaccard coefficient greater than a threshold J when compared with another TR in the same set. In other words, we removed TR duplicates from every set of results, where two TRs are considered as duplicates when they cover the same region with an approximation J. Since TRF and ATRHunter have been executed with options that discard all TRs having a score lower than a given threshold, we filtered T TRS by removing all the TRs with a score under such value (this has been done to not penalize TRF and ATRHunter with respect to TRStalker). More in detail, TRF has been executed with match, mismatch and indel score equal to 2, 3 and 3, respectively, maximum motif length equal to 2000bp 2 , and threshold equal to 30. ATRHunter has been executed with match, mismatch, gap and terminal gap score equal to 1 0-1 0, maximum motif length equal to 500bp 3 and threshold equal to 30. For the TRs found by TRStalker, the score is computed by using the same weights used by TRF and ATRHunter then we filtered the results using the same threshold. After the filtering phase, we computed the union of the TRs found by all algorithms, U = (T TRS ,T TRF ,T ATR ). The removal of duplicates with threshold J is also applied to U. Naturally the higher the value of J less filtering will be performed.</p></div>

In order to select the definition of TRs among those allowed by ATRHunter, we performed a preliminary set of experiments: the definition that gave the best results was the third one (minimum alignment score). In this case, ATRHunter reports only the TRs that have a score higher than a given threshold. The value of the threshold has been set to 30. For the web-based version of TRF, all the experiments have been carried out with these parameters: match, mismatch and indel score equal to 2, 3 and 5, respectively; maximum period equal to 500; minimum score equal to 30. For the binary version, we used the following ones: match, mismatch and indel score equal to 2, 3 and 3, respectively; match and indel probability equal to 0.75 and 0.20; maximum period equal to 500; minimum score equal to 30. The parameters of the experiments have been set so as to make sure that the minimum allowed score for all the tools tested is attained on the input data.

TRStalker has recall always above 95%. TRF (binary) has always a recall above 80% except for TR with repeat number 2 for which the recall drops to 60%. ATRHunter has recall of a about 60%. These experiments confirm the effectiveness of the new techniques for the initial filtering steps. Results on Steiner-STR with motifs of length from 60 to 300, and a number of repeats from 2 to 8 are shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">Figure 2</ref>. Here we notice that all methods have degraded performance for longer motifs (&gt;200 bases) while TRStalker still manages to have recall above 60%. For shorter motifs (of &lt;100 bases) TRF (binary) is able to match TRStalker only when the repeat number is above 6. Thus for a large range of values, TRStalker attains the best performance in recall, or a matching one, always above 80%. The time performance of TRStalker has not been yet optimized. At the moment it is within an order of magnitude of TRF and ATRHunter. More details on the running time are in the Supplementary Materials.</p></div>

TRStalker aims at improving the capability of TR detection for a class of fuzzy TRs for which existing methods do not perform well. Initial testing on biological data show that fuzzy TRs not previously reported are present in biologically relevant sequences. In the case of the Frataxin sequence, the fuzzy TR reported is associated with the known variable copy number breakpoint of Frederich's ataxia. Future work will involve testing TRStalker on relevant families of repetitive elements such as centromeric α-satellites. An extension of TRStalker to handle amino acid sequences is under development.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><figDesc>We used two different definitions of TRs: @BULLET Neighboring TR (NTR): a string X, so that for each i ∈[1...t −1], D E (x i ,x i+1 ) ≤ µ|x i |, for a user defined parameter 0 ≤ µ ≤ 1 @BULLET Steiner-STR with sum: a string X = x 1 x 2 .</figDesc></figure>

			<note place="foot" n="1"> A precise characterization of the relative gain under different error models would be theoretically interesting but is now beyond the focus of this article. Selecting larger values of q and s, as a function of the period to be detected and the error level, may increase the filtering ability of the method at the cost of slower computations. Exploring these connections is left for future research. i361 at :: on August 31, 2016 http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from</note>

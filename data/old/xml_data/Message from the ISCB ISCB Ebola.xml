<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">EBOLA</head><p>The Ebola virus (EBOV) causes the Ebola virus disease (EVD), a disease with high fatality rates that has killed over 6300 individuals from February to December 1, 2014, in the current outbreak (Centers for Disease Control and<ref type="bibr">Prevention, 2014</ref>). The first reports assessing spreading risk have been published (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Gomes et al., 2014</ref>). Recently, 99 EBOV genomes from 78 patients have been analyzed (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Gire et al., 2014</ref>). To facilitate global research, the respective author teams made all their data freely available. This laudable decision aligns with the ISCB openaccess policy (<ref type="bibr">Lathrop et al., 2011a, b</ref>). Given the great urgency of creating an adequate response to Ebola in a short time frame, we urge funding agencies to develop special grant mechanisms for Ebola research, such as that which the United States National Science Foundation has recently announced (National Science Foundation, 2014). For example, funding agencies could allow existing grant recipients to redirect funds from or apply for administrative supplements to appropriate existing grants for research dedicated to Ebola. ISCB Fight against Ebola Award ISCB will confer the award, along with a prize of US$2000, at the ISCB annual meeting, Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology, in July 2016, Orlando, FL.</p></div>

A selected team comprising experts chosen from areas such as Ebola research, epidemiology, public health, computational virology, structural biology, vaccine development, translational bioinformatics, genomics and genome analysis will assess all *To whom correspondence should be addressed. submissions. We will only consider submissions that remain within a limit of two pages. Please note that your submission could be in the style of a journal paper. Be advised of the following constraints when fitting your material onto the two pages: (i) the typeface must be Arial font throughout, using a minimum 9-pt font size for figures and a minimum of 10-pt Arial for the text. The precise minimum page margins depend on your choice of format (US letter: a minimum of 1.25 inches on top and bottom and a minimum of 2.5 inches at the sides; A4: a minimum of 3 cm on top and bottom and a minimum of 1.5 cm on both sides). Submissions must be sent through email (a single PDF document) to Diane Kovats (admin@iscb.org) using the text 'ISCB Fight against Ebola Award' in the subject and body of the email. The deadline for submission is April 10, 2016 (any time zone). Conflict of Interest: none declared.</p></div>

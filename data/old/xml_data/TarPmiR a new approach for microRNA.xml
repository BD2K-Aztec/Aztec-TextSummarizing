				<p>Motivation: The identification of microRNA (miRNA) target sites is fundamentally important for studying gene regulation. There are dozens of computational methods available for miRNA target site prediction. Despite their existence, we still cannot reliably identify miRNA target sites, partially due to our limited understanding of the characteristics of miRNA target sites. The recently published CLASH (crosslinking ligation and sequencing of hybrids) data provide an unprecedented opportunity to study the characteristics of miRNA target sites and improve miRNA target site prediction methods. Results: Applying four different machine learning approaches to the CLASH data, we identified seven new features of miRNA target sites. Combining these new features with those commonly used by existing miRNA target prediction algorithms, we developed an approach called TarPmiR for miRNA target site prediction. Testing on two human and one mouse non-CLASH datasets, we showed that TarPmiR predicted more than 74.2% of true miRNA target sites in each dataset. Compared with three existing approaches, we demonstrated that TarPmiR is superior to these existing approaches in terms of better recall and better precision.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The prediction of microRNA (miRNA) target sites is critical in understanding miRNA function and their involvement in various biological processes (<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Lewis et al., 2003</ref>). MiRNAs are short noncoding RNAs that bind and regulate their target mRNAs in a variety of biological processes, such as cell development, differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis pathways (<ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Sassen et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Schanen and Li, 2011</ref>). The binding of miRNAs to their target mRNAs degrades the target mRNAs and/or prevents the target mRNAs from being translated into proteins, and thus modulates gene expression at the post-transcriptional level (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Axtell et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bartel, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Muljo et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Wang et al., 2011</ref>). By identifying miRNA target sites, the target mRNAs and the potential functional roles of miRNAs may thus be discovered. Several features are commonly believed to be important for predicting miRNA target sites. Among them, seed match, the exact sequence matching between the positions 2–7 of an miRNA and a segment of 6 nucleotides (nt) long in target mRNAs, has been reported to be essential for miRNA–mRNA binding (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Brennecke et al., 2005</ref>). Accessibility, which measures how likely a region in an mRNA sequence is 'open' or accessible for an miRNA to bind, is well known to be important for functional miRNA–mRNA binding (<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kertesz et al., 2007</ref>). In addition, other features such as AU content (<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Grimson et al., 2007</ref>), folding energy (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Enright et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Grimson et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Yousef et al., 2007</ref>) and conservation (<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Helwak et al., 2013</ref>) are also regarded as informative indicators of functional miRNA–mRNA bindings. Dozens of tools for miRNA target site prediction have been developed in the past decade, based on different subsets of the aforementioned features (<ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Peterson et al., 2014</ref>). For instance, miRanda (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Enright et al., 2004</ref>) utilizes the features of seed match, conservation and free energy for target site prediction. TargetScan (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Friedman et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Grimson et al., 2007</ref>) uses seed match, pairing of mRNAs with 3 0 of miRNAs, local AU content, etc., for target site identification. In addition to these traditional miRNA target site prediction tools, recently, several tools based on next-generation sequencing technologies have been developed (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chou et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Vejnar and Zdobnov, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Wang et al., 2014</ref>). For instance, miRTarCLIP (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chou et al., 2013</ref>) identifies miRNA target sites from the data generated by high-throughput sequencing of RNA isolated by crosslinking immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP) experiments (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chi et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Licatalosi et al., 2008</ref>) and photoactivatableribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) experiments (<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hafner et al., 2010</ref>). Despite the existence of dozens of computational methods, computational identification of miRNA target sites remains a challenging problem partially due to our limited understanding of the characteristics of miRNA target sites. For instance, although matching seed is not always sufficient for a functional miRNA–mRNA interaction (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Brennecke et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Didiano and Hobert, 2006</ref>), it has been thought to be necessary for most animal miRNA–mRNA binding. However, studies have shown non-canonical pairings that allow G:U wobbles and even mismatches can be functional (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Brennecke et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Didiano and Hobert, 2006</ref>). Recent crosslinking ligation and sequencing of hybrids (CLASH) experiments (<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Helwak et al., 2013</ref>) have further shown that seed match, including canonical and non-canonical seed-matching, is not required for certain miRNA–mRNA interactions. The CLASH experiments (<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Helwak et al., 2013</ref>) provide an unprecedented opportunity to advance our understanding of miRNA target sites and to develop better computational methods for miRNA target site prediction. Compared with other highthroughput experimental approaches such as HITS-CLIP (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chi et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Licatalosi et al., 2008</ref>) and PAR-CLIP (<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hafner et al., 2010</ref>) that identify miRNA target sequences only, CLASH experiments provide both miRNAs and their corresponding target sequences. With thousands of target sequences for dozens of miRNAs in one CLASH experiment, new features of miRNA target sites may be inferred and better computational methods for miRNA target site prediction may be developed. In this study, we developed a new approach for miRNA target site prediction called Target Prediction for miRNAs (TarPmiR). TarPmiR applies a random-forest-based approach to integrate six conventional features and seven new features to predict miRNA target sites. These features were learned from the only CLASH dataset in mammal that is made publically available by<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Helwak et al. (2013)</ref>. By cross-validation, we showed that TarPmiR had an average recall of 0.543 and an average precision of 0.181. Tested on three independent datasets, including two human PAR-CLIP datasets and one mouse HITS-CLIP dataset, we demonstrated that TarPmiR identified more than 74.2% of known miRNA target sites in each dataset. Compared with three existing approaches, we found that TarPmiR is superior to existing approaches, in terms of both higher recall and higher precision. The TarPmiR method is implemented in a python package, which is freely available at http:// hulab.ucf.edu/research/projects/miRNA/TarPmiR/.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Training and testing data</head><p>We downloaded 18 514 miRNA target sites of 399 miRNAs from CLASH experiments (<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Helwak et al., 2013</ref>). These target sites were considered as positive target sites. We also generated 18 514 corresponding negative or 'false' target sites in a manner similar to a previous study (<ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Li et al., 2014</ref>), with the following criteria: (i) A positive site and its corresponding negative site are on the same mRNA; (ii) The positive and its corresponding negative site has similar CG dinucleotide frequency; (iii) The positive and its corresponding negative site has similar number of the nucleotide G; (iv) A negative site does not overlap with any positive site; and (v) With multiple candidate negative sites in an mRNA, select the one with the lowest folding energy. We performed cross-validation to determine which machine learning method to be used in TarPmiR and to assess the accuracy of TarPmiR. To determine which method to be used, we randomly chose 10 000 positive sites and 10 000 negative sites for training and the remaining positive and negative sites for testing. We repeated this process five times and selected the method with the F2 scores. To test TarPmiR, we used the same five training datasets. For a corresponding testing dataset, we input the mRNA sequences that contain the corresponding remaining 8514 positive sites and the remaining 8514 negative sites for testing. The final model used to predict miRNA target sites by TarPmiR in this study was trained using the first set of randomly chosen 10 000 positive sites and 10 000 negative sites. We also collected two independent PAR-CLIP datasets from the human HEK293 cell line for testing. PAR-CLIP datasets were used because a large number of potential miRNA target regions called crosslink-centered regions (CCRs) could be obtained from PARCLIP. CCRs were considered as positive target sites. One PAR-CLIP dataset with 17 310 CCRs was from<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Hafner et al. (2010)</ref>. Only 16 041 of these CCRs were able to be mapped to mRNAs and resulted in 10 023 target mRNAs. In this dataset, 60 miRNAs accounted for more than 90% of total miRNA reads and 120 miRNAs accounted for 99% of total miRNA reads. In other words, depending on the cutoff to define active miRNAs, there were mainly 60 or 120 miRNAs related to these 17 310 CCRs. The other PAR-CLIP dataset with 44 497 CCRs was obtained from<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Kishore et al. (2011)</ref>. Only 43 251 of the 44 497 CCRs were able to be mapped to mRNAs and resulted in 17 794 target mRNAs. Same as the first PAR-CLIP dataset, depending on the cutoff to define active miRNAs, there were mainly 60 or 120 related miRNAs in this dataset. To test TarPmiR on general datasets, we compared the TarPmiR predictions with the experimentally validated miRNA targets by general methods in TarBase 7.0 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Vlachos et al., 2014</ref>). There are 421 086 POSITIVE TarBase 7.0 miRNA–mRNA interactions in human. We chose the top 100 and 50 miRNAs, which had the largest number of interactions in TabBase 7.0, for further analyses. The rationale to choose top miRNAs was that we had more experimentally validated target mRNAs of these miRNAs and thus could assess the accuracy of TarPmiR and other tools better. The top 100 and 50 miRNAs in TarBase 7.0 accounted for 100 608 (23.9%) and 60 818 (14.4%) of human TarBase 7.0 interactions, respectively. There were 9869 and 9823 mRNAs associated with these 100 and 50 top miRNAs, respectively. We ran TarPmiR and other tools with the 100 or 50 miRNAs and the corresponding mRNAs they interacted as input to predict miRNA target sites. In addition to the human datasets, we collected an independent HITS-CLIP dataset from the mouse cortex cell (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chi et al., 2009</ref>). This dataset provided an Argo–miRNA–mRNA ternary interaction map related to 20 miRNA families, 2953 mRNAs and 11 080 miRNA–mRNA interactions. We further downloaded the corresponding 119 miRNAs from the 20 miRNA families from miRBase (<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Griffiths-Jones et al., 2006</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Potential features considered</head><p>We considered the following 18 features of miRNA target sites in miRNA–mRNA duplexes: (i) folding energy; (ii) seed match; (iii) accessibility; (iv) AU content; (v) stem conservation; (vi) flanking conservation; (vii) difference between stem and flanking conservation;<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Ding et al., 2015</ref>). The first seven features had been used in existing tools (<ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Peterson et al., 2014</ref>), we thus considered them as conventional features. Remaining features that had not been commonly used by miRNAtarget prediction tools were defined as 'new' features. The detailed definition of all 18 features and how to calculate their values are provided in the Supplementary File S1. We briefly explain the m/e motif feature here, as it is not as self-evident as others. The m/e motif describes how different positions in miRNAs match the corresponding positions in target sites. Here two positions match means that nucleotides at the two positions are complement to each other. For instance, nucleotides at positions in miRNA seed regions tend to match the nucleotides at the corresponding positions in target sites and nucleotides at positions in other miRNA regions tend to form mismatches or bulges with the corresponding positions in target sites. We thus have a sequential pattern composed of two letters 'm' and 'e' to describe preferred matching and non-matching positions, respectively. To calculate the m/e scores, for each position in miRNAs, we calculate a probability p i that this position matches the corresponding position in target sites by using all positive target sites in the training dataset. The m/e motif score of a potential target site is calculated as score</p><formula>¼ 1 x X x i¼1 logp i ,</formula><p>where x is the length of the miRNA and x is smaller than 24.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">TarPmiR, a random-forest-based approach for miRNA target site prediction</head><p>With the 13 selected features, we developed a random-forest-based approach called TarPmiR for miRNA target site prediction. We chose the random forests method because we applied the above four approaches to the aforementioned training and testing datasets and found that random forests gave the best performance (Section 3.2). TarPmiR predicts miRNA target sites in three steps with the input of a set of miRNAs and a set of mRNAs. First, TarPmiR generates candidate target sites based on seed match or minimal folding energy (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Enright et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Grimson et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Yousef et al., 2007</ref>). For a given miRNA, TarPmiR scans an mRNA sequence with the seed region of the miRNA (positions 2–7) to find perfect seed-matching sites. These sites are defined as the first set of candidate target sites. In addition, TarPmiR applies RNA-duplex from the Vienna RNA package (<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hofacker, 2003</ref>) to obtain the top target sites with the lowest folding energy. These energy-based sites are defined as the second set of candidate target sites. The combination of seed match and folding energy helps TarPmiR to pick up almost all true target sites from the beginning. Second, for each candidate target sites, TarPmiR calculates the values of the 13 selected features (Supplementary File S1). Finally, TarPmiR applies the trained random-forest based predictor to predict target sites. The output of the random-forest model is the predicted probability that a candidate target site is a true target site. We have compared nine probability cutoffs to define target sites using the F2 score, since we put more emphasis on the recall than the precision. The cutoffs 0.5 and 0.6 have almost the similar F2 scores, while the cutoff 0.5 has the largest recall (Supplementary File S2). Therefore, we used 0.5 for the following analyses. We provide a parameter –p in TarPmiR, users can choose other cutoffs based on their own needs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Comparisons with other methods</head><p>We compared TarPmiR with the following methods: targetScan V2010 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Friedman et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Grimson et al., 2007</ref>), targetScan V2015 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agarwal et al., 2015</ref>), miRanda (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Enright et al., 2004</ref>) and miRmap (<ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Vejnar et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Vejnar and Zdobnov, 2012</ref>). The targetScan and miRanda are two of the most widely used miRNA target prediction tools. We used the following commands to run them: targetScan V2010-perl targetscan.pl &lt;miRNA.&gt; &lt;mRNA&gt; &lt;targetscan_out&gt;, perl targetscan_60_context_scores.pl &lt;miRNA&gt; &lt;mRNA&gt; &lt;targetscan_out&gt; &lt;targetscan_context_score_out&gt;; targetSan V2015-perl targetscan_70.pl &lt;miRNA&gt; &lt;mRNA&gt; TarPmiR&lt;targetscan_out&gt;, targetscan_70_BL_bins.pl &lt;Mrna&gt; &gt; &lt;BL_bins_ out&gt;, targetscan_70_BL_PCT.pl &lt;miRNA&gt; &lt;targetscan_out&gt; &lt;BL_ bins_out&gt; &gt; &lt;PCT_out&gt;, perl targetscan_count_8mers.pl &lt;mir&gt; &lt;Mrna_ORF&gt; &gt;ORF_out, perl targetscan_70_context_scores.pl &lt;miRNA&gt; &lt;Mrna&gt; &lt;PCT_out&gt; &lt;tar.lengths.txt&gt; &lt;ORF_out&gt; &lt;contextþ score&gt;; perl and miranda &lt;miRNA&gt; &lt;mRNA&gt;-sc 120 – en 1. MiRmap is a recently developed tool, which takes high-throughput sequencing data as input to predict miRNA target sites. MiRmap provides a python library and users can write a script to output miRmap predictions with the functions in the library. We used similar parameters as in Vejnar and Zdobnov (2012) when running miRmap.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">All but one conventional features and seven new features were selected by different approaches</head><p>We applied four approaches to select important features from the 18 potential features. Each approach selected a similar but slightly different subset of features (Supplementary File S3). By defining features selected by at least two approaches as important features, we discovered 13 important features (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 1</ref>) .<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1</ref>was the removal of one and only one conventional feature, the difference between stem and flanking conservation. This feature was used in previous studies (<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Helwak et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Pollard et al., 2010</ref>). The removal of this feature may be explained by the fact that most positive target sites from CLASH experiments were from coding regions and there was not much difference in terms of conservation between the seed regions and the flanking regions of target sites in coding regions. Because true target sites were functional and conserved, two features related to the conservation in miRNA–mRNA stem regions and in flanking regions around the stems, respectively, were selected. In addition to the six selected conventional features (folding energy, seed-matching, accessibility, AU content), four new features were selected by all four approaches (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 1</ref>). These features were the m/e motif, the length of the target site, the length of the largest consecutive pairings and the difference between the number of paired positions in the seed region and that in the miRNA 3 0 end. The inclusion of the m/e motif implied that there existed preferred matching positions shared by all miRNAs. The length of the target site was selected, showing the importance of the binding preference of miRNAs to mRNA regions with specific lengths. The length of the largest consecutive pairing positions mattered, which extended the concept of seed match, as seed match was just a simple case with a long consecutive pairing positions. The difference between the number of paired positions in the seed region and that in the miRNA 3 0 end also suggested that the seed match may be unimportant, given a high-quality 3 0 end region matching. This also supported the idea that a long consecutive matching region is critical for functional miRNA target sites. We further investigated the importance of the 13 selected features by the rank-sum test (<ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Mann and Whitney, 1947</ref>) (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 1</ref>). In brief, for each selected feature, we calculated its value for all positive target sites and for their corresponding negative target sites. We then compared the two groups of numbers by the rank-sum test. The numbers on the right side of<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1</ref>showed the P-values of the corresponding features. All 13 selected features had a significant difference between the positive target sites and negative sites (P-value &lt; 1.95eÀ5). Some significant features based on the rank-sum test were not selected by the four machine learning methods, which may be due to the fact that the contribution from the combination of the selected 13 features can already replace that of these removed features. In fact, we calculated the correlation between every pair of the 18 features and found that the discarded significant features correlate well with certain important features (Supplementary File S3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">TarPmiR had a &gt;55% recall and a &gt;19.1% precision</head><p>With the 13 selected features, we developed the TarPmiR method to predict miRNA target sites in the entire regions of mRNAs. TarPmiR applied the random-forest-based approach for target siteprediction. It applied the random forests approach instead of the other three approaches because when tested on five testing datasets, the random-forests-based approach always gave better recalls and precisions (<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>). To investigate the recall and precision of TarPmiR, we tested it on the five testing datasets described in Material and Methods. The precision and recall of TarPmiR in each set of test data were shown in<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>. Since the TarPmiR predictors built on each of the five training datasets had similar precision and recall, we chose the first TarPmiR predictor in our developed tool and in the following analyses. TarPmiR had a 55.1% recall and a 19.1% precision, which were higher than the recall and precision of existing methods reviewed in<ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Reczko et al. (2011)</ref>. Note that TarPmiR had a much smaller precision and recall than the above four methods (columns 2–5 in<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>), because it predicted target sites from the entire mRNA sequences instead of the 8514 sites that were not used for training.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">TarPmiR predicted the majority of true target sites in independent datasets</head><p>To investigate whether TarPmiR was able to predict true target sites in non-CLASH datasets, we applied it to two PAR-CLIP datasets in the HEK293 cell (Material and Methods). There were 16 041 'true' target sites in 10 023 mRNAs from the first dataset (dataset I). Moreover, the reads of the top 60 miRNAs and top 120 miRNAs accounted for more than 90% and 99%, respectively, of the total PAR-CLIP reads in this dataset. By inputting 60 miRNAs and 10 023 mRNAs, TarPmiR predicted 240 605 target sites, which included 74.2% of true target sites (<ref type="figure" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>). Similarly, by inputting 120 miRNAs and 10 023 mRNAs, TarPmiR predicted 481 135 target sites, which included 86.3% of true target sites (<ref type="figure" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>). The percentages of correctly predicted true target sites should be considered underestimated, as a portion of true target sites may not be target sites of the 60 or 120 miRNAs. By considering the 16 041 'true' target sites as all target sites in these mRNAs, we found that TarPmiR had a &gt;74% recall in this dataset (<ref type="figure" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>). For the second PAR-CLIP dataset (dataset II), there were 43 251 'true' target sites in 17 794 mRNAs. Because the cell was the same as that in the first PAR-CLIP dataset, we assumed that mainly 60 or 120 miRNAs related to these target sites. Similarly, we found that TarPmiR was able to identify 79.3% and 89.8% of 'true' target sites, when inputting 60 miRNAs and 120 miRNAs, respectively, together with the 17 794 mRNAs (<ref type="figure" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>). The above analyses demonstrated the successful performance of TarPmiR in the human dataset in the same cell type. It was unclear how well TarPmiR performed in other species and in other cell types. We thus applied TarPmiR to a third independent dataset, the mouse HITS-CLIP dataset in the cortex cell (dataset III). There were 119 potential miRNAs and 2953 mRNAs involved in a total of 11 080 target sites. With the input of these 119 miRNAs and 2953 mRNAs, TarPmiR predicted 285 491 target sites in total. There were 10 766 of the 11 080 (97.2%) target sites predicted by TarPmiR (<ref type="figure" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>). In addition to the above analyses on the crosslinking-based data, we tested TarPmiR using the annotated miRNA–mRNA interactions in TarBase 7.0 (dataset IV) (<ref type="figure" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>). For the top 50 miRNAs and the corresponding 9823 target mRNAs, TarPmiR predicted 52.3% of true target mRNAs (Methods). For the top 100 miRNAs and the corresponding 9869 target mRNAs, TarPmiR predicted 52.6% of true target mRNAs (<ref type="figure" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>) (Methods).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">TarPmiR showed superior performance to existing approaches</head><p>We compared TarPmiR with two widely used tools miRanda (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Enright et al., 2004</ref>), targetScan V2010 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Friedman et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Grimson et al., 2007</ref>), targetScan V2015 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Agarwal et al., 2015</ref>) and a recently published tool, miRmap (<ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Vejnar and Zdobnov, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Vejnar et al., 2013</ref>). The comparison was made on the CLASH dataset, the three independent datasets and the two databases described above. Overall, TarPmiR with the default cutoff 0.5 had a much higher recall and precision than the three existing methods on the CLASH dataset (<ref type="figure">Table 3</ref>). For instance, TarPmiR had a recall of 55.1%, which was at least 10% higher than other approaches. TarPmiR had a precision of 19.1%, which was at least 0.2% higher than other approaches. On the three independent datasets, we compared TarPmiR with the other three methods, including two versions of TargetScan (<ref type="figure" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>). Overall, TarPmiR had a similar or much smaller number of predicted target sites, while it had much more known miRNA target sites predicted in each dataset. By assuming the CCRs from PAR-CLIP and target sites from HITS-CLIP were the only true miRNA target sites in the corresponding mRNAs in the corresponding datasets, we found that TarPmiR had a recall at least 3.9% higher than other methods, and a precision at least 0.5% higher than other methods. Note that the performance of all five methods was relatively high in the mouse dataset than other independent datasets, because miRNA–mRNA interactions in this dataset were mainly inferred and majorly based on seed regions (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chi et al., 2009</ref>). For the known miRNA–mRNA interactions in TarBase 7.0, we also compared TarPmiR with other three methods (<ref type="figure" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>). TarPmiR had a similar or slightly larger number of predicted interactions, while it predicted much more known miRNA–mRNA interactions. Similar to the results on crosslinking-based datasets, TarPmiR had a much higher recall and a higher precision than other methods. We also compared the running speed of the all methods. Because TarPmiR was a machine learning based method and it calculated more features, it was much slower than miRanda and TargetScan.<ref type="figure">TarPmiR</ref>The running speed was similar to that of Mirmap, which was also a machine learning-based method. It was worth pointing out that, although TarPmiR was relatively slow, its speed was reasonable. For instance, it took TarPmiR about 7940 CPU s to predict target sites of 20 miRNAs in 400 mRNA sequences, on average each 2000 nt long.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Discussion</head><p>In this study, we identified seven new features together with six conventional features of miRNA target sites. Based on these 13 selected features, we developed a new approach called TarPmiR to predict miRNA target sites. We tested TarPmiR on a human CLASH dataset, two human PAR-CLIP datasets, a mouse HITS-CLIP dataset and a general dataset from TarBase 7.0, and showed that TarPmiR performed at least the same or better than three existing approaches. TarPmiR is freely available at http://hulab.ucf.edu/research/projects/ miRNA/TarPmiR/. Not all new features were completely new. We claimed some features as new because they were not used by most of the existing tools, such as miRanda (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Enright et al., 2004</ref>), TargetScan (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Friedman et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Grimson et al., 2007</ref>), DIANA-microT-CDS (<ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Maragkakis et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Paraskevopoulou et al., 2013</ref>), rna22-gui (<ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Loher and Rigoutsos, 2012</ref>), TargetMiner (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bandyopadhyay and Mitra, 2009</ref>), PITA (<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kertesz et al., 2007</ref>) and RNAhybrid (Krü ger and<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Rehmsmeier, 2006</ref>). However, several new features were mentioned in previous studies directly or indirectly. For instance,<ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Thomson et al. (2011)</ref>stated that 'some validated miRNA target sites do not have a complete seed match but instead exhibit 11–12 continuous base pairs in the central region of the miRNA'. We observed similar target sites in the CLASH dataset and proposed the feature 'The length and position of the longest consecutive pairs'. The selected new features significantly improved the prediction accuracy of TarPmiR. To show the contribution of the new features to the accuracy of TarPmiR, we removed the seven new features and retrained random forests in TarPmiR. Compared with the original TarPmiR with 13 features, the recall and precision of the modified TarPmiR dropped 8.6% and 9.7%, respectively. We also compared the predicted true target sites by different approaches (Supplementary File S4). TarPmiR had the largest number of predicted true sites shared by other tools. However, the percentage of shared true target sites predicted by TarPmiR was lower than that of other tools, suggesting that TarPmiRcomplements existing tools by predicting sites that cannot be predicted by other tools. In fact, there are 2090 'non-seed-matching' sites in the first CLASH test dataset. TarPmiR was able to identify 1585 (75.8%) of those sites. On the other hand, miRanda and TargetScan were only able to predict 173 (8.28%) and 34 (1.6%) sites, respectively. This also suggested that the traditional tools like TargetScan and miRanda almost cannot predict non-seedmatching binding sites. It is also worth mentioning that CLASH experiments may pick up direct and indirect miRNA target sites. The Argonaut proteins are guided by miRNAs to bind mRNAs, which is referred to as miRNA-dependent recruitment and results in direct miRNA target sites. There is also a miRNA-independent Argonaut protein recruitment mechanism, in which Argonaut proteins are recruited to target mRNAs by protein–protein interaction with RNA-binding proteins and thus miRNAs do not interact with the mRNAs directly (<ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Meister, 2013</ref>). In the future, one may want to distinguish these two types of target sites from the CLASH experiments before training predictors for target site prediction. In this way, we may also obtain better features and improve the prediction accuracy. Because of the existence of indirect target sites in CLASH data, the recall of TarPmiR on the CLASH testing datasets may be underestimated. In fact, TarPmiR had a much higher recall on the three independent human and mouse datasets, suggesting that TarPmiR may have a recall larger than 74%. On the other hand, TarPmiR had a much lower precision on the independent datasets, which may be underestimated as well. This was because we treated all segments other than the CCRs or identified miRNA target sites in these independent datasets as true negative target sites, which may not be the case. By the time of this study, only one CLASH dataset was publicly available (<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Helwak et al., 2013</ref>). This human CLASH dataset was used to train TarPmiR. We applied TarPmiR to human and mouse datasets and demonstrated that it works well on these datasets. In the future, with more CLASH datasets available, more important miRNA target site features including tissue-specific features may be discovered and the accuracy of TarPmiR, especially its precision, may be further improved.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><figDesc>(viii) m/e motif; (ix) the total number of paired positions; (x) the length of the target mRNA region; (xi) the length of the largest consecutive pairs; (xii) the position of the largest consecutive pairs relative to the miRNA 5 0 ; (xiii) the length of the largest consecutive pairs allowing 2 mismatches; (xiv) the position of the largest consecutive pairs allowing 2 mismatches; (xv) the number of paired positions at the miRNA 3 0 end, where 3 0 miRNA end was defined as the last 7 positions of the miRNA; (xvi) the total number of paired positions in the seed region and the miRNA 3 0 end; (xvii) the difference between the number of paired positions in the seed region and that in the miRNA 3 0 end and (xviii) exon preference (</figDesc></figure>

			<note place="foot" n="2">.3 Four computational methods for feature selection Not all of the aforementioned 18 features are effective for target site prediction. To select important features, we applied the following four machine learning methods: step-wise logistic regression (Ralston and Wilf, 1960), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) (Tibshirani, 1996), randomized logistic regression (Meinshausen and Bü hlmann, 2010) and random forests (Svetnik et al., 2003). The step-wise logistic regression repeatedly eliminates the least significant feature until all significant features are found, which is performed by using the GLM package in R (http://data. princeton.edu/R/glms.html). LASSO constructs a linear model and shrinks the coefficients of non-important features to zero. All features with non-zero regression coefficients are &apos;selected&apos; as important features. We used the glmnet package (http://cran.r-project.org/ web/packages/glmnet/index.html) in R for the LASSO analysis. The randomized logistic regression randomly chooses a portion of the training samples and performs the logistic regression to select significant features. It repeats this procedure many times and counts the number of times each feature is selected, which is regarded as the importance of the features. The randomized logistic regression was performed with the scikit-learn package (http://scikit-learn.org/sta ble/) in python. The random forests method grows many classification trees and assigns a new object to the class most trees vote for this object. We used the random forest model from sklearn package (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) in python. Each of the four methods has been applied to select features in previous studies (Chen and Lin, 2006; Chou et al., 2001; D ıaz-Uriarte and De Andres, 2006; Kim and Kim, 2004; Kokaly and Clark, 1999; Ma and Huang, 2008; Saeys et al., 2007; Yeo et al., 1995) and demonstrated good performance in feature selection. We claim a feature as an important feature if at least two of the four methods consider this feature important. By applying the four methods to the training data, we selected 13 important features (Section 3.1).</note>

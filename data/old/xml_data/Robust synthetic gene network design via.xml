				<p>Motivation: Synthetic biology aims to develop the artificial gene networks with desirable behaviors using systematic method. These networks with desired behaviors could be constructed using diverse biological parts, which may limit the development to complex synthetic gene networks. Fortunately, some well-characterized promoter libraries for engineering gene networks are widely available. Thus, a synthetic gene network can be constructed by selecting adequate promoters from promoter libraries to achieve the desired behaviors. However, the present promoter libraries cannot be directly applied to engineer a synthetic gene network. In order to efficiently select adequate promoters from promoter libraries for a synthetic gene network, promoter libraries are needed to be redefined based on the dynamic gene regulation. Results: Based on four design specifications, a library-based search method is proposed to efficiently select the most adequate promoter set from the redefined promoter libraries by a genetic algorithm (GA) to achieve optimal reference tracking design. As the number and size of promoter libraries increase, the proposed method can play an important role in the systematic design of synthetic biology. Contact:</p>

During the past decade, synthetic biology had significant progress in designing biological parts. Synthetic biologists have assembled these parts into genetic circuits to achieve basic functions such as toggle switches (<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Gardner et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kramer et al., 2004</ref>), oscillators (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Atkinson et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Goh et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Stricker et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Tigges et al., 2009</ref>), pulse generators (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Basu et al., 2004</ref>), genetic counters (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Friedland et al., 2009</ref>), logic evaluators (<ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Rinaudo et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Win and Smolke, 2008</ref>), filters (<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hooshangi et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Sohka et al., 2009a</ref>, b), sensors (<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Kobayashi et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Win and Smolke, 2007</ref>) and cell–cell communicators (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Basu et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Kobayashi et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Pai et al., 2009</ref>). Recently, the design concepts of next-generation gene networks, such as * To whom correspondence should be addressed. tunable filters, analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters, adaptive learning networks and protein-based computational circuits, have been proposed to enable the construction of more complex biological systems (<ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Lu et al., 2009</ref>). With the full understanding of biological parts and modules, synthetic biologists can construct useful next-generation synthetic gene networks with real-world applications in medicine, biotechnology, bioremediation and bioenergy (<ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Lu et al., 2009</ref>). At present, engineered organisms contain only very simple genetic circuits since there are problems for assembling biological parts into more complex genetic circuits. For example, although standard biological parts can be obtained from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts (http://partsregistry.org), only a few parts have measured characteristics describing quantitative behavior in the composed devices (<ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kelly et al., 2009</ref>). There is still lack of an efficient method to select adequate biological parts from usable libraries to engineer a genetic circuit to track the desired reference trajectory (<ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Wu et al., 2011</ref>). In this article, we first redefine the presented promoter libraries based on promoter activity, and then a proposed library-based search method is used to efficiently select adequate promoters through their promoter activities in order to engineer a synthetic gene network with desired behaviors despite intrinsic fluctuations and environmental disturbances on the host cell. The proposed librarybased search method can solve the global optimization problem by employing genetic algorithm (GA) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Goldberg, 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Grefenstette, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Holland, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Katayama and Narihisa, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Renders and Flasse, 1996</ref>). Hence, the most adequate promoters from redefined promoter libraries can be efficiently selected to achieve a desired reference trajectory. Finally, two design examples are given to illustrate the design procedure of the proposed method in silico. In the future, synthetic biologists can employ the proposed library-based search method to select the most adequate promoter set from redefined promoter libraries to construct a predictable synthetic gene network.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Redefinition of promoter libraries based on promoter activities</head><p>In general, two types of promoters are used to regulate gene expression in gene networks, i.e. constitutive-and repressor-regulated promoters. Their promoter activities of them are both indirectly measured by the fluorescent protein (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Canton et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Murphy et al., 2007</ref>), and a dynamic model can be used to indirectly evaluate the promoter activities (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Ellis et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kelly et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Leveau and Lindow, 2001</ref>). The scheme of indirectly measuring the promoter activities of promoters is shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2</ref>. It is worth to note that activatable promoters can also be used in synthetic gene networks. Since activatable promoters, however, are not used in this study, their promoterlibraries are not mentioned here. The related discussion of promoter libraries for activatable promoters is mentioned in the Supplementary Material. In order to redefine the constitutive promoter library, Lib const , a dynamic model in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2a</ref>for a promoter c in Lib const can be built. The promoter activity of c can be determined by assuming the dynamic model at a steady state (<ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kelly et al., 2009</ref>)</p><formula>c = β η γ yEGFP α y ss ,</formula><formula>(1)</formula><p>where y ss denotes fluorescence of the gene network at the steady state; β and γ yEGFP denote the degradation rates of mRNA yegfp and protein yEGFP, respectively. α denotes the translation rate; η is the ratio of fluorescence to the concentration of yEGFP (<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Hooshangi et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Leveau and Lindow, 2001</ref>). In this study, we redefine the constitutive promoters BBa_J23100BBa_J23118 in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts (http://partsregistry.org) to build a constitutive promoter library Lib const and denote as J 0 –J 18 listed in<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>. The detailed procedure of evaluating the promoter activity is shown in Supplementary Material. Since a repressor-regulated promoter is regulated by the repressor, it has always the minimum and maximum expression with and without the repressor binding, respectively. Therefore, a promoter in repressor-regulated promoter libraries has two promoter activities, with and without saturating concentration of repressor binding. In<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 2b</ref>, for example, a constitutive promoter expresses the TetR repressor, which is regulated by anhydrotetracycline (ATc) and represses the TetR-regulated promoter. In order to simplify the illustration, we denote the repressor activity r of TetR as the following form (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alon, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Nakanishi et al., 2008</ref>):</p><formula>r = TetR 1+(ATc/K ATc ) n ATc ,</formula><formula>(2)</formula><p>Page: 2702 2700–2706where K ATc denotes the ATc-TetR dissociation rate, and n ATc denotes the binding co-operativity between ATc and TetR. Then we denote the promoter regulation function p TetR (c,r ) as (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Ellis et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Nakanishi et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Semsey et al., 2009</ref>)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C.-H.Wu et al.</head><formula>p TetR (c,r ) = c r + cs−cr 1+(r/K TetR ) n TetR c = {c r ,c s }∈Lib TetR ,</formula><formula>(3)</formula><p>where K TetR and n TetR denote the TetR-DNA binding affinity and the binding co-operativity between regulatory protein TetR and DNA, respectively. The promoter c in Lib TetR has two promoter activities c r and c s , i.e. c ={c r ,c s }∈ Lib TetR. The promoter regulation function p TetR (c,r ) in (3) has the minimum value c r and maximum value c s with and without the saturating concentration of the repressor activity in (2). Finally, the promoter activities c r and c s of c can be determined as</p><formula>c r = p min TetR (c,r ) = β η γ yEGFP α y min (c,t ) (4) c s = p max TetR (c,r ) = β η γ yEGFP α y max (c,t ),</formula><formula>(5)</formula><p>where y min (c,t ) and y max (c,t ) denote the minimum and maximum fluorescence at the steady state, and γ yEGFP denotes the degradation rate of yEGFP. The promoter activities c r and c s of each promoter c in Lib TetR are shown in<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>. Furthermore, the parameters K ATc and n ATc from the repressor activity in (2) and K TetR and n TetR from the promoter regulation function in (3) are identified and listed in<ref type="figure" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>. The promoter activity c ={c r ,c s } of each promoter in the LacI-regulated promoter library Lib LacI can be also determined by a similar process, as listed in<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>. The detailed procedure for redefining the promoter libraries is shown in Supplementary Material. Finally, the promoter regulation function can be extended to illustrate the promoter activity in the constitutive promoter. The promoter regulation function for a constitutive promoter can be rewritten and described as</p><formula>p const (c,0 )= c r + c s −c r 1+(0/K const ) nconst = c s (6)</formula></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Synthetic gene network design: library-based search method</head><p>Consider a more general design for a synthetic gene network. We extend the above gene network in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>with promoters from constitutive, TetR-and LacI-regulated promoter libraries to an n-gene network with promoters from m promoter libraries Lib j , j = 1,2,...m based on a prescribed genetic circuit topology. In the n-gene–gene network, the promoter regulation function for the promoter can be represented as follows:</p><formula>p j (c i ,r i ) = c r i + cs i −cr i 1+(r i /K j ) n j c i = {c r i ,c s i }∈Lib j , j = 1, 2, ..., m ,</formula><formula>(11)</formula><p>where K j and n j are the corresponding parameters to be identified or estimated. For example, the parameters K TetR and n TetR are for the TetRregulated promoter library estimated and listed in<ref type="figure" target="#tab_2">Table 2</ref>. Hence, a dynamic model of the n-gene circuit topology with n promoters selected from m promoter libraries with intrinsic parameter fluctuations and environmental disturbances is represented as ˙ X (c,t ) = f (X,c,t )+f (X,c,t )n (t )+v (t ) y (c,t ) = HX (c,t )</p><formula>c ={c 1 ,c 2 ,...,c n }∈Lib j , j = 1, 2, ..., m ,</formula><formula>(12)</formula><formula>where x i (c i ,t ) and X i (c i ,t</formula><p>) denote the concentrations of mRNA and proteins in the synthetic gene network, respectively.</p><formula>X (c,t ) = [x 1 (c,t),X 1 (c,t),...,x n (c,t),X n (c,t)] T</formula><p>denotes the concentrations of mRNAs and proteins in the synthetic gene network; f (X,c,t) denotes the nonlinear gene regulation of transcription and translation based on the circuit topology; f (X,c,t ) denotes the parameter fluctuations of the non-linear gene regulation f (X,c,t ); and y (c,t ) =[y 1 (c,t),...,y p (c,t)] T denotes the observed proteins we are interested in. H is a p×n output matrix determining what proteins we are interested in. The stochastic dynamic system in (12) can be established from the prescribed genetic circuit topology, and the most adequate promoter set</p><formula>c * ={c * 1 , c * 2 ,...,c * n</formula><p>} selected from corresponding promoter libraries Lib j , j = 1, 2, ..., m can make the synthetic gene network track the prescribed desired trajectories via the library-based search method. For convenience in illustrating the proposed library-based search method, four design specifications are given as follows:</p><p>(1) Given the desired reference trajectory y r (t ) = f r (t ), which dimension is consistent with the numbers of fluorescent proteins y (c,t ) in (12).</p><p>(2) Given the promoter libraries Lib j , j = 1, ..., m as in(4) Select a promoter set c ={c 1 ,c 2 ,...,c n } from the promoter libraries Lib j , j = 1, ..., m to minimize the following cost function, i.e.</p><formula>J (c ) = E t f 0 (y (c,t )−y r (t ) ) T (y (c,t )−y r (t ) )dt (13)</formula><p>If the cost function in (13) can be minimized by selecting the most adequate promoter set c * ={c * 1 ,c * 2 ,...,c * n } under design specifications (1)–(4), then the observed output y(c * ,t)of the synthetic gene network can optimally and robustly track the prescribed reference trajectories y r (t ) under the intrinsic parameter fluctuations and environmental disturbances on the host cells. Using conventional optimal design methods, the many combinations of promoter sets required to satisfy four design specifications generally will waste a large amount of computation time and trail-and-error experiments. In this study, a library-based search method using a genetic algorithm (GA) is employed to select the most adequate promoter set c * from corresponding promoter libraries. GA is a stochastic optimization algorithm, originally motivated by the mechanisms of natural selection and evolutionary genetics. GA has been proven to be efficient for solving constrained optimization problems in many areas (<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Grefenstette, 1986</ref>) and further details on GA can are available elsewhere (<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Goldberg, 1989</ref>). The analysis of computational complexity is shown in the Supplementary Material. By the library-based search method and four design specifications, the most adequate promoter set c * can be selected in design specification (2). Despite intrinsic parameter fluctuations and environmental disturbances in design specifications (3), the gene network can achieve the desired reference trajectory in design specification (1) by minimizing the cost function J (c ) in design specification (4). In fact, this library-based optimal reference tracking problem in (13) is a highly non-linear optimization problem. In conventional search algorithms, the optimal solution can be obtained, but it may not be the global optimization. The library-based search method using GA is an iterative procedure to select the most adequate promoter set</p><formula>c * ={c * 1 , c * 2 ,...,c * n</formula><p>} that satisfies design specifications (1)–(4). When the most adequate promoter set c * is selected, design specifications (1)–(4) for the synthetic gene network can be satisfied, and then the synthetic gene network can track the desired reference trajectory robustly and optimally. A design procedure for this library-based search method using GA is given as follows.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">DISCUSSION</head><p>The main challenge in genetic circuit design lies in selecting wellmatched genetic parts that combine and produce the desired behavior reliably. Some studies have proposed to engineer a synthetic gene network to achieve a desired steady state (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Chen and Wu, 2009</ref>) or an H 2 optimal tracking of a desired oscillator (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chen and Wu, 2010</ref>). However, the above design methods need to tune some kinetic parameters to achieve the desired steady or oscillatory state. In fact, tuning intrinsic parameters of biological devices to fit the designed parameter is currently quite a difficult or even unfeasible task for biotechnology. Further, it is still hard to select adequate biological parts to implement a desired cellular function with quantitative value. To overcome this problem, synthetic biologists usually create many versions of synthetic circuits with diverse characteristic by directed evolution, point mutation or random combinational of DNA components, and the functions of these versions are investigated to engineer the gene circuit with the desired behavior (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Chatterjee and Yuan, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Guet et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Yokobayashi et al., 2002</ref>). But when the design of the genetic circuit is complex, the number of mutated versions needed to be created and tested is dramatically increased. Hence, these experimental steps become tedious and time consuming due to the significant amount of trail-and-error experiments. Our method is to select the existent promoters from promoter libraries and will be more appealing to synthetic biologists in the future. In this study, the present promoter libraries are first redefined based on the dynamic gene regulation from experimental data, and a library-based search method is then introduced to engineer a synthetic gene network with desired behaviors by satisfying four design specifications. Through re-characteristic biological part datasheets, we can design a synthetic gene network with a new function in the existing libraries without having to perform a large number of trail-and-error experiments. Using GA operators, the library-based search method is used to mimic the realistic gene network evolution under natural selection to fit four design specifications but with much fast evolution needed for synthetic gene networks to achieve their desired behaviors. Hence, the proposed method can efficiently engineer a synthetic gene network to perform its desired behaviors despite intrinsic parameter fluctuations and environmental disturbances. In design examples of the synthetic gene network, the most adequate promoter set c * is selected to achieve the minimum tracking error between the desired reference trajectory and the observed output (i.e. fluorescence) despite intrinsic parameter fluctuations and environmental disturbances in vivo, as shown in Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure S2</ref>. It is worth to notice that this method is also useful for constructing a synthetic oscillator (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4</ref>). After constructing the synthetic gene network and providing four design specifications, the library-based search method can efficiently select the most adequate promoter set to track the desired trajectory, as shown in Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure S3</ref>. For the oscillator design in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig. 4</ref>, only 71.4% of the promoter sets selected from<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>have oscillatory behavior, and only a few set of these can track the reference trajectory. Furthermore, by the proposed method, the design procedure of a synthetic gene network can be simplified for in vivo experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">CONCLUSION</head><p>In this study, promoter libraries are redefined based on their promoter activities so that they are more suitable for the gene circuit design of synthetic biology. The library-based search method can produce biological insights for how to design a synthetic gene network with prescribed functions. A GA-based search method is proposed to mimic the gene network evolution under natural selection to select adequate promoters to fit four design specifications with more fast evolution speed. The proposed design method to select the most adequate promoter set from promoter libraries will help synthetic biologists to simplify the design procedure of synthetic gene networks and accelerate the progress of synthetic biology. With advances in modern DNA synthesis technologies, together with well-defined characteristics of promoters and other standard biological parts, in the future our systematic method could be widely applied for the faster design cycle of synthetic gene networks.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig.2.</head><figDesc>Fig. 2.

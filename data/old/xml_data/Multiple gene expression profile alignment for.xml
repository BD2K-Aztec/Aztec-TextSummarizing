				<p>Motivation: Clustering gene expression data given in terms of time-series is a challenging problem that imposes its own particular constraints. Traditional clustering methods based on conventional similarity measures are not always suitable for clustering time-series data. A few methods have been proposed recently for clustering microarray time-series, which take the temporal dimension of the data into account. The inherent principle behind these methods is to either define a similarity measure appropriate for temporal expression data, or pre-process the data in such a way that the temporal relationships between and within the time-series are considered during the subsequent clustering phase. Results: We introduce pairwise gene expression profile alignment, which vertically shifts two profiles in such a way that the area between their corresponding curves is minimal. Based on the pairwise alignment operation, we define a new distance function that is appropriate for time-series profiles. We also introduce a new clustering method that involves multiple expression profile alignment, which generalizes pairwise alignment to a set of profiles. Extensive experiments on well-known datasets yield encouraging results of at least 80% classification accuracy.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>An important process in functional genomic studies is clustering microarray time-series data, where genes with similar expression profiles are expected to be functionally related (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Cho et al., 1998</ref>). A Bayesian approach (<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Ramoni et al., 2002</ref>), a partitional clustering based on k-means (<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Tavazoie et al., 1999</ref>) and a Euclidean distance approach (<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Tamayo et al., 1999</ref>) have been proposed for clustering time-series gene expression profiles. They have applied selforganizing maps (SOMs) to visualize and to interpret the gene temporal expression profile patterns. A hidden phase model was used for clustering time-series data to define the parameters of a mixture of normal distributions in a Bayesian-like manner that are estimated by using expectation maximization (EM;<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bréhélin, 2005</ref>). Also, the methods proposed in<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chu et al. (1998) and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Heyer et al. (1999)</ref>are based on correlation measures. A method that uses jack–knife correlation with or without using seeded candidate profiles was proposed for clustering time-series microarray data as well (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Heyer et al., 1999</ref>), where the resulting clusters depend upon the initially chosen template genes, because there is a possibility of missing important genes. A regression-based method was proposed in<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Ernst et al. (2005)</ref>to address the challenges in clustering short time-series expression data. Analyzing gene temporal expression profile data that are non-uniformly sampled and can contain missing values has been studied in<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bar-Joseph et al. (2003)</ref>. Clustering temporal gene expression profiles was studied by identifying homogeneous clusters of genes in<ref type="bibr">Déjean et al. (2007)</ref>. The shapes of the curves were considered instead of the absolute expression ratios. Fuzzy clustering of gene temporal profiles, where the similarities between co-expressed genes are computed based on the rate of change of the expression ratios across time, has been studied in<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Moller-Levet et al. (2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">). In Peddada et al. (2005</ref>, the idea of order-restricted inference levels across time has been applied to select and cluster genes, where the estimation makes use of known inequalities among parameters. In<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Rueda et al. (2008)</ref>, pairs of profiles represented by piece-wise linear functions are aligned in such a way to minimize the integrated squared area between the profiles. An agglomerative clustering method, combined with an area-based distance measure between two aligned profiles, was used to cluster microarray time-series data. Using natural cubic spline interpolations, we re-formulated the pairwise gene expression profile alignment problem of<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Rueda et al. (2008)</ref>in terms of arbitrary functions that are continuously integrable on a finite interval, and extended the concept of pairwise alignment to multiple expression profile alignment. Finally, we combined k-means and EM clustering with multiple alignment to cluster microarray time-series data, yielding at least 80% classification accuracy on well-known data.</p></div>

The k initial centroids are found by randomly selecting k pairs of profiles inˆDinˆ inˆD, and then take the centroid of each pair. In Step (4.6), we do not use pairwise alignment to find the centroidˆµcentroidˆ centroidˆµ i (t) closest to a ˆ x j (t); since, by Lemma 1, they are automatically aligned relative to each other.

An important implication of Equation (15) is that applying k-means on the non-aligned dataset D (i.e. clustering on D), without any multiple alignment, is equivalent to k-MCMA (i.e. clustering onˆDonˆ onˆD). That is, if a profile x i (t) is assigned to a cluster C µ i by k-means on D, its shifted profilê x i (t) will be assigned to clusterˆCˆµclusterˆ clusterˆCclusterˆCˆ clusterˆCˆµ i by k-MCMA (k-means onˆDonˆ onˆD). This can be easily shown by the fact that multiple alignment is order-preserving. In k-means on D, Step (6) would require O(sk) pairwise alignments to assign s profiles to k clusters; whereas no pairwise alignment is needed in k-MCMA. In other words, we show that we can multiple-align once, and obtain the same k-means clustering results, provided that we initialize the means in the same manner. This also, reinforces a known fact demonstrated in<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Roth et al. (2003)</ref>; which is a dissimilarity function that is not a metric can be made metric by using a shift operation. In this case, the objective function of k-means does not change, and convergence is assured. Thus, this saves a lot of computations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">EM clustering via multiple alignment</head><p>In this section, we present the EM clustering algorithm combined with the alignment methods. EM is used for clustering in the context of mixture models (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Dempster et al., 1977</ref>). The goal of EM clustering is to estimate the means and covariances for each cluster so as to maximize the likelihood of the observed data distribution. In EM, we want to partition a set of s profiles,</p><formula>D = {x 1 (t),...,x s (t)}, into k disjoint clusters C 1 ,...,C k , 1≤ k ≤ s, such that: (i) C i =∅,i = 1,...,k; (ii) k i=1 C i = D; and (iii) C i ∩C j =∅,i,j = 1</formula><p>,...,k and i = j.

Both steps iterate until the log-likelihood reaches a maximum. Thus, EM assigns profiles to multiple clusters, as in fuzzy clustering. Also, unlike in k-means, EM assigns each profile to the cluster that finds the maximum posterior probability.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</head><p>One of the datasets, the pre-clustered budding yeast genes of<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Cho et al. (1998)</ref>profiles to cluster microarray time-series data. The profiles are represented as natural cubic spline functions, where the expression measurements are not necessarily taken at regular time-intervals. Four cluster validity indices are used in conjunction with the above methods to determine the appropriate number of clusters and also the validity of the clusters. An objective measure for comparing the k-MCMA and EMMA clusters with the yeast phases is computed by taking the average classification accuracy. EMMA combined with natural cubic spline profiles performs better than piecewise linear profiles, and also outperformed VCD. Our experiments also show that EMMA is able to find better clusters than biologically characterized yeast phases. We finally note that our vertical alignment method is different from the temporal alignment of Bar<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Joseph et al. (2003) and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Ernst et al. (2005)</ref>, where the alignment is horizontal, i.e. it is performed along the time axis to match the time points of one profile to the time points of the other profile, in such a way that the integrated squared error between the horizontally aligned profiles is minimal. Temporal alignment is used for profiles that are either sampled at different time points, have different number of time points, or have different time extents. In the future, we plan to study other distance-based clustering approaches using our multiple alignment method. Other clustering algorithms with multiple alignment, cluster validity indices based on multiple alignment, phase detection by aligning over a portion of the time series expression and studying the effectiveness of our clustering methods in dose–response microarray datasets can alsobe interesting to investigate. Though our main focus is clustering, the effect of using different imputation methods rather than natural cubic spline in representing the profiles are also worth investigating.</p></div>

			<note place="foot">M phase (31 genes); the phases are visualized in Figure 2a. Another dataset used in the experiments is the Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which contains expressions of the transcriptomes from planktonic clusters at eight different points, from 0 to 48 h (Waite et al., 2006). The clustering methods were also tested on the dataset containing the expressions of the cell-cycle progressions of the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Peng et al., 2005). This dataset contains 747 genes, representing the expression ratios measured at 14 different time points, for two types of cells, namely, wild-type and cdc25 mutant cells. Setting k = 5, we applied k-MCMA and EMMA on the yeast dataset to see if k-MCMA and EMMA are able to find these phases as accurately as possible. Once the clusters have been found, to compare the clustering with the pre-clustered dataset of Cho et al. (1998), the next step is to label the clusters, where the labels are the &apos;phases&apos; in the pre-clustered dataset. To measure the performance of k-MCMA and EMMA, we assigned each EMMA cluster to a yeast phase using the Hungarian algorithm (Kuhn, 2005). The Hungarian method is a combinatorial optimization algorithm, which solves the assignment problem in polynomial time. Our phase assignment problem and the complete discussion of the solution can be found in Subhani et al. (2009). In Figure 2, the cluster and the phase of each of the five selected pairs, found by the Hungarian algorithm, are shown at the same level; e.g. cluster C3 of Figure 2b–d is assigned to the late G1 phase of Cho et al. (1998) by our phase assignment</note>

The same procedure by using k-MCMA of<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Subhani et al. (2009)</ref>and the results are in.

The dashed black lines are the cluster centroids learned by EMMA () and the known phase centroids of the yeast data (). In the figure, each cluster and phase were multiple-aligned using Equation (9) to enhance visualization.clearly shows a high degree of similarity between the EMMA clusters and the yeast phases. Visually, each EMMA cluster on the left is very similar to exactly one of the yeast phases, which we show at the same level on the right. Also visually, it even 'seems'that EMMA clusters are more accurate than the yeast phases and k-MCMA clusters, which suggests that EMMA can also correct manual phase assignment errors, if any. An objective measure for comparing EMMA and k-MCMA clusters with the yeast phases was computed as follows. For each EMMA or k-MCMA cluster, ˆ</p><formula>C ˆ µ c (1 ≤ c ≤ k = 5)</formula><p>, we find the shortest distance between each profile x i (t), 1 ≤ i ≤|ˆCˆµ≤|ˆ ≤|ˆC≤|ˆCˆ ≤|ˆCˆµ c |, and all five-phase centroids ν j (t), 1 ≤ j ≤ k = 5, using Equation (16) of<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Subhani et al. (2009)</ref>. Profile x i (t) will be assigned the correct label (i.e. assigned to phase label ofˆPˆνofˆ ofˆPofˆPˆ ofˆPˆν j ) whenever x i (t) ∈ ˆ P ˆ ν j andˆCˆµ andˆ andˆCandˆCˆ andˆCˆµ c , ˆ P ˆ ν j ∈ S the set of selected cluster-phase pairs; otherwise, x i (t) will be assigned the incorrect label, if clusterˆCˆµclusterˆ clusterˆCclusterˆCˆ clusterˆCˆµ c was not paired with phasê P ˆ ν j by our pair-assignment method. The percentage of correct assignments over the 221 profiles was used as our measure of accuracy, resulting in 83.26% for EMMA and 79.64% for k-MCMA. That is</p><formula>Acc = k c=1 | ˆ C ˆ µc | i=1 E c , argmin 1≤j≤k d x i ,ν j 221 ,</formula><formula>(25)</formula><p>where E(a,b) returns 1 when a = b, and zero otherwise. This criterion is reasonable, as k-MCMA is an unsupervised learning approach that does not know the phases beforehand, and hence the aim is to 'discover' the phases. In<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Cho et al. (1998)</ref>, the five phases were determined using biological information, including genomic and phenotypic features observed in the yeast cell-cycle experiments. EMMA's accuracy of 83.26% is quite high considering that it is an unsupervised learning method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comparison with previous approaches</head><p>We have compared our approaches with the following two previously published approaches:</p><p>(i) a clustering method that uses piecewise linear profiles in<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Rueda et al. (2008)</ref>; and (ii) the variation-based coexpression detection (VCD) algorithm, which is described in Zong-Xian and Jung-Hsien (2008). We used an objective measure for comparing EMMA clusters with the yeast phases. The measurement was computed by taking the average classification accuracy, as the number of genes that EMMA correctly assigned to one of the phases. Considering each EMMA cluster as a class, ˆ</p><formula>C ˆ µ c (1 ≤ c ≤ k = 5)</formula><p>, we trained a c-nearest neighbor (c-NN) classifier with clusters to classify the data with a 10-fold cross validation procedure, where c is the number of nearest profiles from the centroids. We found that k = 5 is the best number of clusters for the dataset, and we used the distance function of Equation 15 to measure the distance between the centroids and the nearest profiles. We applied the same procedure for k-MCMA clusters too. In<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Cho et al. (1998)</ref>, the five phases were determined using biological information, including genomic and phenotypic features observed in the yeast cell-cycle experiments. EMMA's average classification accuracy is 91.03%, whereas for k-MCMA it is 89.51%. We also applied the same objective measure as described above for comparing the EMMA clusters with the P.aeruginosa dataset, obtaining an average classification accuracy of 91.40%. In<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Waite et al. (2006) and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Rueda et al. (2008)</ref>, the correlation coefficient is used as the distance measure between gene profiles while here, we used the distance as defined in Equation (15).shows that EMMA yields better results than k-MCMA and the methods used in<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Waite et al. (2006)</ref>. The same objective measure as described above was applied in order to compare the k-MCMA clusters, using piecewise linear profiles (an approach of<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Rueda et al., 2008)</ref>with the yeast phases, which yielded an average classification accuracy of 86.12%. For the P. aeruginosa dataset, we obtained an average classification accuracy of 90.90%.shows the average classification accuracies of our approaches and the approach of<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Rueda et al. (2008)</ref>. Fromand Supplementary, we observe that natural cubic spline profiles performed better than piecewise linear profiles. k-MCMA and EMMA clusters using natural cubic spline profiles on both datasets obtained over 90% classification accuracy, which is very high considering that they are both unsupervised methods, while EMMA yields better results than k-MCMA. The same comparison was carried out against the VCD algorithm (Zong<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Xian and Jung-Hsien, 2008</ref>). In that approach, gene expressions are translated into gene variation vectors whose cosine values are then used to evaluate the variation vector similarities over time. EMMA and VCD are compared on two datasets: Saccharomyces cerevisiae and S.pombe datasets (). In, cluster number 5 of EMMA and k-MCMA are similar to the corresponding S phase, whereas VCD assigns many differentially expressed genes to it—the same situation occurs for cluster number 2 as well. From the figure, we observe that EMMA's clusters are more compact than those of all other methods. EMMA's clusters are even more well-separated than pre-characterized phases, at least visually. In, VCD identified three clusters that contain only two genes and many genes are assigned to incorrect clusters. In this dataset, k-MCMA's clusters are more well-separated than EMMA's. On the S.cerevisiae dataset, both EMMA and VCD found five clusters, whereas EMMA clusters obtained over 90% classification accuracy. On the S.pombe dataset, we ran EMMA in conjunction with four validity indices. We found eight meaningful clusters in this dataset. EMMA was applied by setting of k = 8, and yielded 89.53% classification accuracy. Setting λ = 0.59 and z p = 7, we applied VCD on S.pombe as well to find the clusters. VCD also identified eight clusters and yielded 70.46% classification accuracy. VCD identified 33 unique genes that do not belong to any cluster. According to<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Peng et al. (2005)</ref>, 71 clusters were obtained in the S.pombe dataset with parameters λ = 0.75 and z p = 1.96. In their method, λ covers the similarity between sets and z p determines the number of clusters. The eight EMMA and k-MCMA clusters on S.pombe yielded 86.94% and 87.63% classification accuracies, respectively, which shows that S.pombe contains eight meaningful clusters. In fact, EMMA and VCD are both unsupervised learning methods, while EMMA performs much better than VCD.</p></div>			</div>

				<p>Motivation: Protein–protein interactions (PPIs) underpin virtually all cellular processes both in health and disease. Modulating the interaction between proteins by means of small (chemical) agents is therefore a promising route for future novel therapeutic interventions. In this context, peptides are gaining momentum as emerging agents for the modulation of PPIs. Results: We reported a novel computational, structure and knowledge-based approach to model orthosteric peptides to target PPIs: PiPreD. PiPreD relies on a precompiled and bespoken library of structural motifs, iMotifs, extracted from protein complexes and a fast structural modeling algorithm driven by the location of native chemical groups on the interface of the protein target named anchor residues. PiPreD comprehensive and systematically samples the entire interface deriving peptide conformations best suited for the given region on the protein interface. PiPreD complements the existing technologies and provides new solutions for the disruption of selected interactions. Availability and implementation: Database and accessory scripts and programs are available upon request to the authors or at http://www.bioinsilico.org/PIPRED.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Protein–protein interactions (PPIs) are essential in the shaping of normal and pathological behaviors in cells. A new frontier in drug discovery is, therefore, the development of new therapeutic agents to modulate PPIs (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Fletcher and Hamilton, 2006</ref>). Although originally considered undruggable, PPIs are arising as promising therapeutic targets as reviewed in Wells and McClendon (2007) and they are attracting considerable attention from biotechnological companies as the 'unmined gold reserve' in drug discovery (<ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Mullard, 2012</ref>). One part of the problem is that proteins usually interact through large and flat surfaces that lack defining physicochemical traits that can be exploited to attain the required affinities. It is becoming clearer that chemistry originating from traditional drug discovery programs is perhaps not the most suited for targeting PPIs (<ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Rubinstein and Niv, 2009</ref>), and thus new chemotypes should be sought. It is in this context, and thanks to biotechnology advances that have improved its pharmacokinetic properties (<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">McGregor, 2008</ref>), that peptides are gaining momentum as emerging agents for the modulation of PPIs (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Gaestel and Kracht, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Marchioni and Zheng, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Rubinstein and Niv, 2009</ref>). Besides, peptide-mediated interactions are common in Biology, accounting for up to 40% of the interactions that take place inside the cell (<ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Petsalaki and Russell, 2008</ref>). They are also central to number of essential cellular processes such as signal transduction, protein assembly, protein localization and regulation (<ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Neduva and Russell, 2006</ref>) and thus are the more natural candidates for the inhibition of PPIs (<ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Mullard, 2012</ref>). Moreover, peptides do not preclude traditional chemistry as they can be used as precursors to derive chemical compounds, i.e. peptidomimetics (e.g. p53-MDM2 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Vassilev et al., 2004</ref>) and Bak BH3/ Bcl-xL (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Ernst et al., 2003</ref>).) Computational tools can be used to model the structure of peptides targeting protein interfaces. Such approaches include peptide<ref type="bibr">, 1991</ref>), linking (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Frenkel et al., 1995</ref>), property-guided searches (<ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Teixido et al., 2003</ref>), optimization (<ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Roberts et al., 2012</ref>) and docking (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Donsky and Wolfson, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Raveh et al., 2010</ref>). While useful, these technologies present a number of limitations: (i) the search is usually restricted to a small region of the interface given the time that will be required to fully explore the entire interface; (ii) the structure of peptides tend to be biased toward linear and extended conformations as its maximized the contacts with the target surface, however, peptides can adopt different conformations including a-helix (<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Kritzer et al., 2004</ref>); (iii) do not explicitly exploit the natural repertoire of peptide sequences, which has been proved to increase the chance to identify bioactive peptides (<ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Watt, 2006</ref>); (iv) some methods require the sequence of the peptides, and thus neglecting the discovery of novel sequences; and (v) other methods are based on the optimization of main-chain stretches isolated from its cognate partner(s), and thus cannot be used to explore novel conformations. Here, we present PiPreD, a novel, structure-and knowledgebased approach to model the conformation of peptides targeting protein interfaces. PiPreD relies on a bespoken library of structural motifs derived from interfaces named iMotifs and it uses native structural elements of the interface being targeted (targetinterface), so-called disembodied anchor residues. The search and sampling of peptides covers the entire interface, i.e. a systematic and comprehensive exploration without biases caused by specific location(s) of the target interface or by the conformation of peptides. PiPreD is therefore a good complement to existing methodologies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">iMotifsDB: a collection of structural motifs derived from protein interfaces</head><p>PiPreD is a knowledge-based approach that relies on a library of structural fragments, iMotifs, extracted from either protein–protein or protein–peptide complexes. The current library was derived from an initial set of 45 434 complexes downloaded from the protein databank (PDB) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Berman et al., 2003</ref>) and interface residues were defined using CSU (<ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Sobolev et al., 1999</ref>). Fragments containing at least two nonsequentially continuous interface residues were qualified as iMotifs and used to populate iMotifsDB. Subsequently, iMotifs were clustered to remove structural redundancies following a similar approach as in<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Lessel and Schomburg (1997)</ref>resulting in a final set of 171 306 iMotifs. iMotifsDB is available upon request to the corresponding author both as plain text or MySQL dump formats or downloadable from http://www.bioinsilico.org/PIPRED.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Structural modeling algorithm</head><p>PiPRED encompasses four consecutive steps described below (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig. 1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">Defining anchor residues and structural diversification</head><p>or main chain rotamers Disembodied interface residues or anchor residues are used to drive the modeling of peptides. The anchor residues defined as those mediating the interaction with the protein of interest, also known as contact residues, are selected using CSU (<ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Sobolev et al., 1999</ref>). The conformation of main chain atoms is then diversified by deriving inverse rotamers, i.e. a conformational sample of main chain rotamers with respect to a fixed position of the native contacts of the side chain atoms. This step yields alternative conformations maximizing (and subsequently optimizing) the number of modeled peptides.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2">Structural modeling of peptides using iMotifs</head><p>The structural modeling is done using an adaption of our early approach to model loops in protein structures (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Fernandez-Fuentes et al., 2006</ref>). Drawing analogies between both approaches, anchor residues are the equivalent to stem residues in loop modeling while iMotifs are the equivalent to loop fragments extracted form known protein structures. In the first step of the structural modeling, iMotifs are selected if the difference of the Euclidian distance between start–end Ca-atoms in both anchor residues and iMotifs is smaller than 0.5 Ang (i.e. analogue to distance between stem residues and the first and last residues of the loop fragment in loop modeling). Selected iMotifs are then superposed onto the anchor residues using an iterative structural superposition maximizing the number of structurally aligned residues between anchor and iMotifs. The iteration is performed as follow:</p><p>(i) it starts by aligning the main chain and Cb atoms (to preserve orientation of side chains) of anchors and start–end residues; the superposition is discarded if above 1.0 Ang root mean square deviation (RMSD); (ii) the nearest anchor residue is selected if it lies within a Ca–Ca distance of 2.0 Ang to any residue in the iMotif and subsequently added to the set of anchor residues in use. The fitting of iMotif-selected anchor residues is repeated and accepted if the resulting RMSD is smaller than previous RMSD 6 10%; (iii) step 2 is repeated or otherwise stops when there are no more new anchor residues to be included or the resulting RMSD is above the threshold. The native main chain conformation of the anchor residues and the derived inverse rotamers are used to compute the structural superposition. All possible combinations of nonstructurally equivalent pairs of anchor residues are used to direct the modeling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3">Computational design of peptides</head><p>The last step in PiPreD is implemented within the framework of the Rosetta macromolecular modeling software (<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Leaver-Fay et al., 2011</ref>). Two different protocols have been implemented: the first approach follows the protocol described by<ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Sood and Baker (2006)</ref>, in which the main chain of peptides is fixed (i.e. main chain conformations are explored at the level of iMotifs) whilst side chains are allowed to rotate and surface residues in the target protein have limited conformational flexibility (i.e. repacking). All 20 possible amino acids are allowed at any position of the peptide with the exception of those defined by the anchor residues where only rotameric changes are permitted. The second approach is based on the workby<ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Smith and Kortemme (2010)</ref>, in which structural ensembles are generated using peptide poses by applying backrub motions to derive sequence profiles. The latter is more suited to selected poses for the purpose of generating libraries of sequences for high-throughput screening. The peptides shown in this article as examples were derived using Sood and Baker's (2006) approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.2">Scoring of peptides</head><p>In the current implementation of PiPreD, the scoring of peptides–interface interaction is ranked using Rosetta score (<ref type="bibr">LeaverFay et al., 2011</ref>). Rosetta scoring function is a combination of physic-based and statistical-based potentials including several terms that account for a Lennard–Jones potential, a solvation term, orientation-dependent hydrogen bond, backbone and side chain torsion potentials, a short range electrostatic term, and an unfolded reference state (<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Leaver-Fay et al., 2013</ref>). Nonetheless, any structurebased scoring function of choice could be equally used.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Results and discussion</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">PiPreD comprehensively charts the entire interface during structural modeling</head><p>Protein interactions are mediated by large interaction surfaces (<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Lo Conte et al., 1999</ref>). Therefore, targeting a protein interface using peptides presents a combinatorial problem and thus the search is usually restricted to a small region of the interface. However, in PiPreD the selection of anchor residues drive the structural modeling implemented, hence the search and sampling of peptides covers the entire interface, i.e. it is a systematic and comprehensive exploration without any bias both in terms of the size of the specific region of the interface and in the conformation of the interfering peptides (see<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 2</ref>and Section 3.2). In the specific case presented in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>: Tweak in complex with the Fab fragment of a neutralizing antibody (<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Lammens et al., 2013</ref>), PiPred delivered around 1.7 M peptides, of which circa 650 000 were helical, resulting from using 25 anchor residues. Even considering the large number of potential conformations of the main chain of anchor residues produced by inverse rotamers, i.e. an average of 75 alternative conformations per anchor residues, the comprehensive charting of the interface is qualitatively better (as it covers a large size of the conformational space restricted to the interaction) and faster than a random charting by ab initio modeling of main chain conformations. Moreover, there is no need to predefine the size of peptides and/or sequences. On average, any given selection of anchor residues (two is the minimum) generates on average up to 12 000 candidate iMotifs. This number ranges between a few hundreds to tens of thousands depending mainly on the distance between anchor residues, i.e. the further apart, the less suitable iMotifs are found in the database. As expected, the number of generated peptides correlates with the number of anchor residues, which in turn relates to the size of the interface (<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Structural modeling generate peptides not biased toward specific conformations</head><p>A clear advantage of the PiPreD is that the modeling process is unbiased toward particular conformations. The modeling relies on a structural library of iMotifs looking for the most favorable conformations given the specific target-interface of a protein. Whether the conformations would be linear/extended or helical will entirely depend on the particular structural environment of the anchor residues and the conformational 'repertoire' of the iMotif library.Knowledge-based modeling<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>shows this aspect with three particular examples of modeled peptides. In one of the cases (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref>lower-left), the peptide has a linear conformation, which closely resembles and recapitulates an existing structural element of the original complex, i.e. an interacting loop located in the interface. In this example, PiPreD is similar to other methods that derive peptides utilizing native regions of the interface [e.g. (<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">London et al., 2010</ref>) or (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Donsky and Wolfson, 2011)]</ref>. However, the other two examples (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref>top and lower right), the peptides present a helical conformation. This is a new structural arrangement, not observed in the native complex, but that however surrogates an important number of anchor residues, or in other words, an important part of the native interface. In particular, one of the modeled peptides can act as a surrogate of a b-strand and a neighboring loop simultaneously accounting for up to 7 of the anchor residues, i.e. an important percentage of the total number of interactions observed in the interface (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 3</ref>). This is a remarkable example in which, PiPreD yielded 1.5 million peptide designs, where around one third had helical conformation. Besides, this example also shows that PiPreD brings new directions to the field of peptide designs. It is worth noting, that as a lead for drug development, helical peptides are preferred to linear/ extended conformations due to higher stability, permeability and resistance to proteases (<ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Walensky et al., 2004</ref>). In summary, not only PiPreD can generate peptides featuring conformations not present in the native complex but also recapitulate existing, native, elements even though they are not taken into consideration during the modeling process, i.e. anchor residues are presented as disembodied elements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">PiPreD combines native elements of different interfaces into single peptides</head><p>Another important feature of PiPreD is that it can integrate and combine multiple interfaces. The only requirement for structural modeling of peptides is the need of the anchor residues driving the modeling. These can be extracted from a single interface or combined using different interfaces, being irrelevant whether they overlap or not. Thus, modeled peptides can integrate anchor residues from independent interfaces and thus reach between different regions with the added value of engineering and designing de novo interactions, which were not present in the native complex. An example illustrating the combination of anchor residues extracted from different interfaces is shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref>. The biological unit of the TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) and Death Receptor 5 (DR5) complex (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Cha et al., 2000</ref>) is composed of 3 TRAIL and 3 DR5 monomers. Therefore, TRAIL monomers interact both with a TRAIL and DR5 monomers (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4</ref>). To account for this, PiPreD modeling uses the combination of anchor residues from different interfaces. As shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref>one for the modeled peptide, a helical peptide, integrates anchor residues both from TRAIL and DR5 monomers while reaching two different interfaces. This has the added value of engineering and designing de novo interactions, which were not present in the native complex (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 4</ref>), and thus being particularly important when looking at increasing the number of interactions between the peptide and the protein surface.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Combining anchor residues derived from different cognate partners</head><p>There are cases where different partners can bind the same protein by sharing a common interface. In the context of our modeling strategy, it means that anchor residues can be obtained from different cognate partners of the target protein and therefore they can be merged in the modeling step. One of such example is that of RAS, an important protein family involved in the regulation of signaling pathways linked to cell grow and proliferation (<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Malumbres and Barbacid, 2003</ref>), which interact with a range of protein effectors through a common interface called the switch I–II region (<ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Milburn et al., 1990</ref>). The structures of six RAS-cognate partners were used to extract anchor residues: RAS-p120Gap (PDB code: 1wq1) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Scheffzek et al., 1997</ref>), RAS-SOS-1 (PDB code: 1bkd) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Boriack-Sjodin et al., 1998</ref>), RAS-RAF (PDB code: 3kud) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Filchtinski et al., 2010</ref>), RAS-PLCe (PDB code: 2c5l) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bunney et al., 2006</ref>), RAS-RalGDS (PDB code: 1lfd) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Huang et al., 1998</ref>) and RAS-Anti RAS Fv (PDB code: 2uzi) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Tanaka et al., 2007</ref>). Interface sizes varies across complexes, being SOS-RAS (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Boriack-Sjodin et al., 1998</ref>) the complex with the largest interaction interface, which includes 52 residues and cover and area of around 3245 Ang 2 ; RAS-scFV Antibody (<ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Tanaka et al., 2007</ref>) is the complex with the smallest contact surface with 17 interface residues and 900 Ang 2. The target surface restricted to the intersection of all interfaces covers an area of 1200 Ang 2 and comprises 24 nonstructurally equivalent anchor residues (<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Fig 5)</ref>. A few examples of modeled peptides are also shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">Figure 5</ref>and these include anchor residues derived from different partners. The total number of modeled peptides was 1.5 M, of which over 600 000 were helical peptides.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.5">Targeting of small interfaces and structural diversity of peptides</head><p>Given the nature of the modeling strategy, the number of generated peptides, and thus conformational diversity of peptides, is necessary linked to the number of anchor residues used (<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>). However, even in the case of small protein interfaces, such as the case of the Myc–Max complex (<ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Nair and Burley, 2003</ref>), PiPreD is able to achieve a high conformational heterogeneity among designed peptides (<ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>).The interaction between Myc and Max is mediated by an extended helix-zipper and a helix-turn-helix domain. The helix-turnhelix domain comprises 13 anchor residues distributed in a surface of around 690 Ang 2. The modeling of peptides targeting this region generated over 550 000 peptides (over 300 000 of which had helical conformation). As expected around 65% of the helical peptides recapitulate different elements of native cognate partner Max (i.e. helical peptides of different sizes and spanning different regions of native interactions), but also and more importantly, peptides with linear/extended conformation (i.e. conformation not observed in the native complex) and even helical peptides whose conformation and interaction mode was not derived from existing elements of the native complex (<ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.6">Targeting of independent interfaces in the same target protein</head><p>The final example presented is the case of large protein complexes where there can be the situation that the same cognate partner interacts with two independent, nonoverlapping and structurally distant protein interfaces. Such example is presented in<ref type="figure">Figure 7</ref>, which illustrates the modeling of peptides to target ERP57 using anchor residues derived from Tapasin (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Dong et al., 2009</ref>). As shown, the two interfaces are independent and do not share a common continuous interface of the target protein and account for 60 anchor residues in total (<ref type="figure">Fig. 7</ref>). This example is different to the one presented in Section 3.3 as the interfaces are more distant and do not share a common, continuous, interface of the target protein. The number of modeled peptides, 2.5 M, was slightly lower than expected given the number of anchor residues considered, i.e. potentially one could expect a large number of combinations of pairs of residues but an important proportion of those corresponded to anchor residues from different, distant interfaces (<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>). Thus, this caused the modeling process to fail finding suitable iMotifs to surrogate these particular instances.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Conclusion</head><p>In this work, we present a novel, knowledge-based computational method to model and design orthosteric peptides: PiPreD. PiPreD relies on the structural information of the protein complexes and on a bespoken library of structural motifs: iMotifsDB. The residues that mediate the interaction of cognate partner(s) and target protein, i.e. anchor residues, are used to drive a comprehensive and systematic sampling and modelling of peptides derived from iMotifs. PiPreD can be applied to any protein complex for which the threedimensional structure is known and thus open a new avenue to exploit the repository of protein complexes present in structural databases. Additionally, the technology can be easily adapted to<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bunney et al., 2006</ref>), RAS-P120 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Scheffzek et al., 1997</ref>), RAS-RAL (<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Huang et al., 1998</ref>) and RAS-scFV (<ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Tanaka et al., 2007</ref>).

Finally, this new approach could be used in conjunction with high-throughput peptide synthesis techniques such as peptide microarrays to generate a pool of sequences that are biased toward the targeted surface, i.e. a directed search as opposed to a random peptide screening.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig.1.</head><figDesc>Fig. 1.

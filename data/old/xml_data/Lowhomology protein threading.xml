				<p>Motivation: The challenge of template-based modeling lies in the recognition of correct templates and generation of accurate sequence-template alignments. Homologous information has proved to be very powerful in detecting remote homologs, as demonstrated by the state-of-the-art profile-based method HHpred. However, HHpred does not fare well when proteins under consideration are low-homology. A protein is low-homology if we cannot obtain sufficient amount of homologous information for it from existing protein sequence databases. Results: We present a profile-entropy dependent scoring function for low-homology protein threading. This method will model correlation among various protein features and determine their relative importance according to the amount of homologous information available. When proteins under consideration are low-homology, our method will rely more on structure information; otherwise, homologous information. Experimental results indicate that our threading method greatly outperforms the best profile-based method HHpred and all the top CASP8 servers on low-homology proteins. Tested on the CASP8 hard targets, our threading method is also better than all the top CASP8 servers but slightly worse than Zhang-Server. This is significant considering that Zhang-Server and other top CASP8 servers use a combination of multiple structure-prediction techniques including consensus method, multiple-template modeling, template-free modeling and model refinement while our method is a classical single-template-based threading method without any post-threading refinement.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Template-based modeling (i.e. homology modeling and protein threading) is becoming more powerful and important for structure prediction along with the PDB growth and the improvement of prediction protocols. Current PDB may contain all templates for single-domain proteins according to the seminal studies in<ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Zhang and Skolnick (2005a)</ref>. This implies that the structures of many new proteins can be predicted using template-based methods. The error of a template-based model comes from template selection and sequence-template alignment, in addition to the structure difference between the sequence and template. At higher sequence identity (&gt;50%), template-based models can be accurate enough to be useful in virtual ligand screening (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bjelic and Aqvist, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Caffrey et al., 2005</ref>), designing site-directed mutagenesis experiments (<ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Skowronek et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Wells et al., 2006</ref>), small ligand docking prediction, and function prediction (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Baker and Sali, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Skolnick et al., 2000</ref>). When sequence identity is below 30%, it is difficult to recognize the best template and generate accurate sequence-template alignments, so the resultant models have a wide * To whom correspondence should be addressed. range of accuracies (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Chakravarty et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Sanchez et al., 2000</ref>).<ref type="bibr">Pieper et al. have</ref>shown that 76% of all the models in MODBASE are from alignments in which the sequence and template share &lt;30% sequence identity (<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Pieper et al., 2006</ref>). Therefore, to greatly enlarge the pool of useful models, it is essential to improve fold recognition and alignment method for the sequence and template with &lt;30% sequence identity. Considering that currently there are millions of proteins without experimental structures, even a slight improvement in prediction accuracy can have a significant impact on large-scale structure prediction and its applications. As reported in Melo and<ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Sali (2007)</ref>, even 1% improvement in the accuracy of fold assessment for the ∼4.2 million models in MODBASE can correctly identify ∼42 000 more models. The alignment accuracy is determined by a scoring function used to drive sequence-template alignment. When the sequence and template are not close homologs, their alignment can be significantly improved by incorporating homologous information (i.e. sequence profile) into the scoring function. HHpred (<ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Soding, 2005</ref>), possibly the best profile-based method, is such a representative. HHpred uses only sequence profile and predicted secondary structure for remote homolog detection. It works very well when proteins under consideration have a large amount of homologous information in the public sequence databases, but not as well when proteins under consideration are low-homology. A protein is low-homology if there is no sufficient homologous information available for it in the sequence databases (see Section 2 for quantitative definition). Many threading methods, such as MUSTER (<ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Wu and Zhang, 2008</ref>), Phyre2 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kelley and Sternberg, 2009</ref>) and SPARKS/SP3/SP5 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Zhang et al., 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Zhang et al., , 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Zhou and</ref><ref type="bibr">Zhou 2004, 2005</ref>), aim at going beyond profile-based methods by combining homologous information with a variety of structure information. However, recent CASP evaluations (<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Moult et al., 2005</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Moult et al., , 2007</ref>) demonstrate that HHpred actually is as good as if not better than these threading methods. Clearly, it is very challenging to outperform HHpred by simply adding structure information into template-based methods. In fact,<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Ginalski et al. (2005)</ref>claimed that 'presently, the advantage of including the structural information in the fitness function cannot be clearly proven in benchmarks'. This article describes a new scoring function for protein threading. In this function, the relative importance of structure information is determined according to the amount of homologous information available. When proteins under consideration are low-homology, our method will rely more on structure information; otherwise, homologous information. This method enables us to significantly advance template-based modeling over profile-based methods such as HHpred, especially for low-homology proteins. The capability of predicting low-homology proteins without close homologs in the PDB is particularly important because (i) a large portion of proteins in the PDB, which will be used as templates, belong to this class; and (ii) a majority number of the Pfam (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Finn et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Sammut et al., 2008</ref>) families without solved structures</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Low-homology protein threading</head><p>are low-homology (see Section 2 for exact numbers). Therefore, to predict structure for proteins in Pfam using templates, it is essential to have a method that can work well on low-homology proteins. In addition, the class of low-homology proteins may represent a substantial portion of metagenomics sequences of microbes (e.g. Staphylococcus aureus) generated from numerous metagenomic projects. It is very challenging to predict structure of a lowhomology protein because (i) its sequence profile is not diverse enough to link it to remote homologs in the PDB; and (ii) its predicted secondary structure usually has low accuracy as secondary structure is usually predicted from homologous information. Experimental results indicate that our method greatly outperforms the best profile-based method HHpred and the top CASP8 servers on low-homology proteins. Tested on the CASP8 hard targets, our method also outperforms nine of the top 10 CASP8 servers and is very close to the best Zhang-Server (<ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Zhang, 2009</ref>). This is significant considering that the top CASP8 servers use a combination of multiple structure prediction techniques including consensus method, multiple-template modeling, template-free modeling and model refinement while our method is a classical single-templatebased threading method without any post-threading refinement.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">NEFF: measuring the amount of homologous information</head><p>NEFF is not a new concept. It has already been used by PSI-BLAST (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Altschul et al., 1997</ref>) to measure the amount of homologous information available for a protein. The relationship between NEFF and the modeling capability of a profile-based method has also been studied before (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Casbon and Saqi, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Sadreyev and Grishin, 2004</ref>). NEFF can be interpreted as the effective number of non-redundant homologs of a given protein and be calculated from the multiple-alignment of the homologs. The homologs are detected in the NCBI NR database by PSI-BLAST (five iterations and E-value 0.001). NEFF is calculated as the exponential of entropy averaged over all columns of the multiple-alignment, so in this sense NEFF can also be interpreted as the entropy of a sequence profile derived from the multiple-alignment. NEFF is a real value ranging from 1 to 20. A protein with small NEFF is low-homology since we cannot obtain sufficient homologous information for it from existing protein sequence databases. The Pfam (version: 23.0) contains ∼10 000 families covering ∼75% protein sequences in UniProt (<ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Sammut et al., 2008</ref>). Among the ∼6600 Pfam families without solved structures, ∼90, ∼78, ∼58 and ∼33% of them have NEFF smaller than 6, 5, 4 and 3, respectively. 1 Among the ∼18 000 HHpred templates (i.e. a set of representative structures in the PDB), ∼36% of them have NEFF &lt;6. Later we will show that when either the sequence or template has NEFF ≤6, our method can generate much better alignments than HHpred. There are also ∼25% protein sequences in UnitProt not covered by the Pfam database. Many of these sequences are singletons (i.e. products of orphan genes) and thus, have NEFF = 1. In the foreseeable future, many of the low-homology proteins or protein families (i.e. NEFF ≤6) will not have solved structures. Therefore, to elucidate the structure of these proteins (or protein families), it is important to develop a protein threading method that can work well on low-homology proteins.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Method for protein alignment</head><p>Existing protein threading methods use a linear scoring function to guide sequence-template alignment. A linear function cannot accurately model correlation among protein features, although it has been observed that many features are correlated, e.g. secondary structure versus solvent accessibility. A linear function fixes the relative importance of various protein features without taking into consideration the special properties of proteins under consideration. However, the importance of structure information is not uniform across all threading instances. When the sequence and template are very similar at sequence (profile) level, using structure information may introduce noise. When the sequence and template are distantly related, structure information becomes more important. We have recently developed a non-linear scoring function for protein threading (<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Peng and Xu, 2009</ref>). This scoring function measures the sequencetemplate similarity using a set of regression trees, which take as input protein features and output the log-likelihood of an alignment state (i.e. match or gap). A regression tree consists of many paths, each specifying a rule to calculate the probability of an alignment state. One path can be as simple as 'if (mutation score &lt; −50), then the log-likelihood of a match state is ln0.9' or as complex as 'if (−50 &lt; mutation score &lt; −10) and (secondary-structure score &gt;0.9) and (solvent accessibility score &gt; 0.6), then the log-likelihood of a match state is ln0.7'. Thus, a regression tree can model the non-linear relationship between an alignment state and protein features. Here we briefly describe this method as follows. Let s denote the target protein (i.e. sequence) and its associated features, e.g. sequence profile, predicted secondary-structure and solvent accessibility. Let t denote the template and its associated information, e.g. positionspecific scoring matrix, solvent accessibility and secondary structure. Let X = {M,I s ,I t } be a set of three possible alignment states. Meanwhile, M indicates that two positions are aligned and I s and I t indicate insertion at sequence and template, respectively. Let a = {a 1 ,a 2 ,...,a L } (a i ∈ X) denote an alignment between s and t where a i represents the state at position i. Our threading model defines the conditional probability of a given s and t as follows:</p><formula>p a|s,t = exp i F a i−1 → a i |s,t Z s,t .</formula><p>Meanwhile, Z(s,t) is a normalizing factor and F a i−1 → a i |s,t is a function that calculates the log-likelihood of the state transition from a i−1 to a i given target and template features at position i. To model nonlinear relationship between an alignment state and protein features, we represent F(a i−1 → a i |s,t) as a linear combination of regression trees. Each regression tree is a nonlinear function of protein features, so the final threading scoring function is non-linear. This model is much more powerful than existing methods because a state transition in this model depends on a complex function of protein features while existing methods use only a linear function. Since this method considers only state transition between two adjacent positions, the optimal alignment can still be efficiently calculated using dynamic programming.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">Features for a match state</head><p>In addition to the features (profile similarity, secondary-structure similarity, solvent accessibility similarity and environmental fitness score) described in our previous work (<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Peng and Xu, 2009</ref>), we use the following extra information to estimate the probability of one template position being aligned to one target position. In order to determine the relative importance of homologous and structure information, the NEFF values of both the sequence and template are used as features. When NEFF is large, our threading method will count more on homologous information, otherwise on structure information. We use the CC50 matrix developed by Kihara group (<ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Tan et al., 2006</ref>) to calculate similarity between the sequence and template. This matrix is a statistical potential-based amino acid similarity matrix, originally designed for aligning distantly related protein sequences. One element CC50<ref type="bibr">[a]</ref><ref type="bibr">[b]</ref>in this matrix is the similarity score between two amino acids a and b, which is computed as the correlation coefficient of the pairwise contact potentials of these two amino acids. We also use a structure-based substitution matrix (<ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Prlic et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Tan et al., 2006</ref>) to improve alignment accuracy when the sequence and template</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>J.Peng and J.Xu</head><p>are distantly related. This matrix is more sensitive than BLOSUM in remote homolog detection. This scoring matrix is derived by a similar procedure as the BLOSUM matrices (<ref type="bibr">Henikoff, 1992, 1993</ref>) are done, based upon the structure alignments of structurally similar protein pairs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2">Features for a gap state</head><p>The gap event is related to multiple factors. Some studies indicate that a gap event is related to its local sequence and structure context. For example, SSALN (<ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Qiu and Elber, 2006</ref>) uses a contextspecific gap penalty model, in which a gap event depends on secondary structure and solvent accessibility. Other methods, such as HHpred and<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Ellrott et al. (Ellrott et al., 2007</ref>) use a position-specific gap penalty model, which contains evolutionary information of a protein. In our previous work (<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Peng and Xu, 2009</ref>), only context-specific gap penalty is used. In this work, we use both context-specific and positionspecific gap penalty and then use NEFF to determine their relative importance. If NEFF is large, we will rely more on position-specific gap penalty (i.e. homologous information); otherwise, context-specific gap penalty (i.e. structure information). To calculate the position-specific gap penalty of a protein, we run PSI-BLAST on it (with five iterations and E-value 0.001) against the NCBI NR database and generate a multiple sequence alignment. Then we calculate the probability of a gap event at each residue as the ratio between the number of the gap events and the number of sequences in the multiple sequence alignment. For context-specific gap penalty, we estimate the occurring probability of an insertion at the template using secondary-structure type, solvent accessibility, amino acid identity and hydropathy count (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Do et al., 2006</ref>). In addition, we use a binary value to indicate if a residue is in the core region or not. A core residue is usually more conserved and shall be. Similarly, we estimate the occurring probability of an insertion at the target using predicted secondary, predicted solvent accessibility, amino acid identity and hydropathy count. We train our threading model by maximizing the occurring probability of a set of reference alignments. See<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Peng and Xu (2009)</ref>for a detailed account.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3">Geometric constraints</head><p>When the sequence and template are not close homologs, their alignment usually contains displaced gap opening or ending positions. Even a single displaced gap in an alignment may result in a big quality drop of the resultant 3D model. The template provides some geometric information that can be used to improve alignment accuracy. Suppose that two adjacent sequence positions are aligned to two template positions j 1 and j 2 j 2 &gt; j 1 +1 , respectively. Since the distance between two adjacent C α atoms is around 3.8 Å, the two C α atoms at j 1 and j 2 should not be far apart. To tolerate some alignment errors, we use 7 Å (instead of 3.8 Å) as the distance threshold for such two C α atoms. We enforce this physical constraint when generating the optimal alignment between the sequence and template. All the alignments violating this physical constraint is discarded. 2 Our experiments indicate that by applying this constraint, we can improve alignment accuracy dramatically for some threading instances.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Training datasets</head><p>We choose 66 protein pairs from the PDB as the training set and 50 pairs as the validation set. The NEFF (i.e. the diversity of sequence profiles) values of these 66 pairs of proteins are distributed uniformly between 1 and 11. This is very important in order to avoid structure information being dominated by homologous information. In the training set, 46 pairs are in the same fold but different superfamily level by the SCOP classification (<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Murzin et al., 1995</ref>). The other 20 pairs are in the same superfamily but different family level. Any two proteins in the training and validation set have sequence identity &lt;30%. The proteins used for model training and validation have no high sequence identity (&lt;30%) with the proteins in the Prosup (<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Lackner et al., 2000</ref>) and SALIGN (<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Marti-Renom et al., 2004</ref>) benchmarks and the CASP8 2 The optimal alignment satisfying the physical constraint can still be efficiently calculated using dynamic programming. targets. We use TM-align (<ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Zhang and Skolnick, 2005b</ref>) to build a reference alignment for a protein pair in SALIGN.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Method for template selection</head><p>After aligning a given sequence (i.e. target) to all the templates in the database, we need to pick up the best alignment, from which we can build a 3D model for the target. We use a neural network to predict the quality, measured by TM-score 3 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Zhang and Skolnick, 2007</ref>), of the 3D model built by MODELLER from a sequence-template alignment and then use the predicted quality to rank all the alignments for a given target. In this work, we predict the TM-score using the following alignment-dependent features: sequence identity, distribution of various per-position scores such as mutation score, solvent accessibility score, secondary-structure similarity score and distribution of gap sizes. In addition, we feed the NEFF values of both the sequence and template into our neural network, in order to determine the relative importance of homologous and structure information. We trained our template selection method using the data set generated by RAPTOR for both CASP6 and CASP7 targets. Tested on these targets (using cross-validation), the absolute prediction error of TM-score is ∼0.045 on average (data not shown). The correlation coefficient between the predicted TM-score and the real one is above 0.9 on all alignments and 0.8 on lowquality ones (data not shown).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Performance on public benchmarks</head><p>We tested our method on two public benchmarks: Prosup (<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Lackner et al., 2000</ref>) and SALIGN (<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Marti-Renom et al., 2004</ref>), which contain 127 and 200 protein pairs, respectively. On average, two proteins in a pair share 20% sequence identity and 65% of structurally equivalent Cα atoms superposed with RMSD 3.5 Å. The SALIGN set is much more challenging than Prosup, as the former includes many pairs of proteins of very different sizes. We evaluate our method using both reference-dependent and reference-independent alignment accuracy. The referencedependent alignment accuracy is calculated as the percentage of correctly aligned positions judged by reference alignments, which are generated by structural alignment programs. To evaluate the reference-independent alignment accuracy, we first build a 3D model for the sequence in a protein pair using MODELLER (<ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Sali, 1995</ref>) from its alignment to the template and then evaluate the quality of the resultant 3D model using TM-score (<ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Zhang and Skolnick, 2005b</ref>). Since our ultimate goal is to predict 3D structure for a target, reference-independent alignment accuracy is a better measurement than reference-dependent alignment accuracy.<ref type="figure" target="#tab_1">Table 1</ref>, our method shows a significant advantage over the others. The absolute improvement over our own RAPTOR threading program (<ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Xu et al., 2003</ref>) is at least 24%. Our method is also better than the CASP-winning methods SP3 and SP5 by 16.5% (14.4%) and 10.7% (7.9%) on ProSup (SALIGN), respectively. The results of SPARKS/SP3/SP5 are taken from<ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Zhang et al. (2008).</ref></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.1">Reference-dependent alignment accuracy As shown in</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.2">Reference-independent alignment accuracy</head><p>The models generated by our new method in total have TM-score 66.77 and, respectively. To examine the performance of our method and HHpred with respect to the amount of homologous information, we divide the test protein pairs in the ProSup and SALIGN sets into 10 groups according to their NEFF values:<ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2</ref>), [2,3),…,<ref type="bibr">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr">10</ref>),<ref type="bibr">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr">20]</ref>. The NEFF of a protein pair is defined as the minimum NEFF of the sequence and template. Out of the 327 test protein pairs, 15, 26, 53, 72 and 114 pairs have NEFF smaller than 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, respectively. Then we calculate the average reference-independent alignment accuracy (measured by TM-score) of all the pairs in each group. As shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1</ref>, when either the sequence or template has a small NEFF (&lt;6), on average our method can generate much better 3D models than HHpred. When NEFF &lt;2, the model quality of our method is almost 100% better than HHpred. When NEFF &lt;3, the model quality of our method is at least 50% better than HHpred. Our method also performs as well as HHpred on highhomology targets (i.e. NEFF &gt;7). According to Skolnick group a model with TM-score ∼0.4 can be used for functional study while a model with TM-score ∼0.2 is almost random. This implies that when NEFF &lt;2, the HHpred models are almost random while our method can generate models useable for functional study. Since ∼90% of the Pfam families without solved structures have NEFF &lt;6, our method can improve over HHpred on a majority number of Pfam families. This study indicates that we can significantly advance the modeling capability of low-homology proteins with NEFF≤3, which represents approximately one-third of the Pfam families without solved structures.</p></div>

The three MULTICOM programs (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Cheng, 2008</ref>) (MUProt, MC-CLUSTER and MC-REFINE) use multiple threading programs, multiple-template techniques, model clustering and template-free modeling. Our RAPTOR++ (<ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Xu et al., 2009</ref>) program uses three in-house threading programs and then employs multiple-template technique for easy targets and template-free modeling for very hard targets. To do a fair comparison, our new threading method used the NCBI NR and a template database generated before CASP8 started (i.e. May 2008). We evaluated the model quality of the 119 CASP8 targets using both GDT-TS and TM-score. GDT-TS is similar to i297We exclude T0498 and T0499 from evaluation because they have been discussed in<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Alexander et al. (2007)</ref>well before CASP8 started. Due to space limitation, we evaluate only the #1 models generated by one. By comparing our method with Zhang-Server, we can see how far away our new method is from the best server in the community, although it is unfair to compare our single-templatebased method with a modeling method using multiple techniques. By comparing our method with the three mainly-threading-based methods HHpred2, MUSTER and Phyre2, we can see how much we have advanced the state-of-the-art of protein threading. This is important since all the top CASP8 servers including Zhang-Server heavily depend on single-template-based threading methods.<ref type="figure" target="#tab_2">Tables 2</ref>and 3, if only the low-homology targets (NEFF ≤4) are evaluated, our method outperforms all the top CASP8 servers including Zhang-Server. In particular, when only the targets with NEFF ≤3 are considered, our method outperforms HHpred2, MUSTER and Phyre2 by 41.2, 34.4 and 32.3%, respectively. When only the targets with NEFF ≤4 are considered, our method outperforms HHpred2, MUSTER and Phyre2 by 8.5, 9.2 and 10.1%, respectively. When only the targets with NEFF ≤3 and ≤4 are evaluated, our method is better than Zhang-Server by 20.8 and 3.2%, respectively. If we exclude the five easy targets 6 (i.e. T0390, T0442, T0447, T0458 and T0471) from evaluation, then our method is better than Zhang-Server, HHpred2, MUSTER and Phyre2 by 10.5, 15.9, 14.5 and 18.0%, respectively, on the 11 hard targets with NEFF ≤4. The performance of our method on low-homology targets is significant considering that our method is a pure single-templatebased threading method while Zhang-Server combines results from∼10 threading programs and also refines models extensively. Our new method is also better than our own RAPTOR++ program on low-homology targets. In CASP8, RAPTOR++ uses three in-house threading methods, a multiple-template method for easy targets and also a template-free method for hard targets. When all the targets are considered, our new method outperforms all the top CASP8 servers but Zhang-Server in terms of both GDTTS and TM-score. A paired Student's t-test between our method and each of the top CASP8 servers indicates that the difference between our method and all the top servers excluding RAPTOR++ and TASSER is significant (P&lt;0.05), as shown in<ref type="figure" target="#tab_4">Table 4</ref>.<ref type="figure" target="#tab_5">Table 5</ref>shows the performance of our method on the 25 hard targets. Our method is very close to Zhang-Server on the hard targets and better than all the other servers. In particular, our method outperforms our own RAPTOR++ server by ∼10% on hard targets. Our method is better than the three threading methods HHpred2, MUSTERand Phyre2 by 14.2, 14.9 and 20.3%, respectively. Among the 25 hard targets, our method is better than, worse than and comparable to Zhang-Server on 10, 13 and 2 of them, respectively. It is not unexpected that our method performs well on hard targets since many of them are low-homology, as shown in<ref type="figure" target="#tab_6">Table 6</ref>. If the targets with NEFF ≥5 are excluded, the difference between our method and Zhang-Server will further reduce. As shown in<ref type="figure">Table 7</ref>, our method is better than HHpred2, MUSTER and Phyre2 by 2.2, 3.4 and 6.3%, respectively, on the 94 easy targets. Zhang-Server is better than our method, partially because Zhang-Server uses multiple templates to model an easy target. By using multiple templates for a single target, it is possible to generate a model with accuracy higher than any single-templatebased models.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">DISCUSSION</head><p>Homologous information is very effective in detecting remote homologs, as evidenced by the profile-based method HHpred, which performed better than or as well as several top threading methods in recent CASP events. This paper proposes a new threading method and shows that homologous information is not sufficient for lowhomology protein threading. In particular, when NEFF ≤6 we can improve alignment accuracy over profile-based methods by using more structure information. Our experimental result indicates that our method outperforms all the top CASP8 servers on lowhomology targets (NEFF ≤4). Our method also performs well on both the CASP8 hard and easy targets and is slightly worse than the best CASP8 server. This result is encouraging considering that the top CASP8 servers use a combination of multiple techniques to do structure prediction while our method is only a classical single-template-based threading method. Our method is clearly better than several threading-based methods such as MUSTER, HHpred and Phyre2 on both low-homology and hard CASP8 targets. The capability of predicting structures for low-homology proteins is very important. The Pfam database contains ∼6600 families without solved structures. To predict structures for these families, we have to rely on templates remotely similar to these families. A simple statistics shows that ∼33, 58 and 90% of the 6600 Pfam families have NEFF &lt;3, 4 and 6, respectively. In our current template database, approximately one-third of the templates have NEFF &lt;6. Therefore, if we align the 6600 Pfam families to our templates oneby-one, around 93% of the threading pairs will contain at least one protein with NEFF &lt;6. This is surprising given that the NCBI NR sequence database currently contains millions of protein sequences. Along with the NCBI NR growth, the NEFF values of the Pfam families are also likely to increase. It will be interesting to study how fast the NEFF values will increase. The percentage of low-homology proteins in CASP8 is much smaller than that in Pfam. Only 16 (13.4%) and 43 (36.1%) of the 119 CASP8 targets have NEFF &lt;4 and 6, respectively. That is, the CASP8 targets are biased towards high-homology proteins. This is not unexpected since the CASP organizers obtain most of the targets from the worldwide structure genomics centers. These centers tend to solve structures for the targets in a large Pfam family to maximize the number of sequences within (homology) modeling distance of the structures in the PDB. A large Pfam family contains many proteins and thus, is more likely to have a large NEFF. Our data also show that most CASP8 hard targets are lowhomology. This is reasonable since it is very challenging to predict structures for a low-homology target. However, not all lowhomology targets are hard. We can easily predict structures for low-homology targets (i.e. T0471, T0458, T0447, T0442 and T0390) as long as they have good templates. The major challenge we are facing now is to identify the best template for a given target. As long as the best template can be identified, we can generate a reasonable alignment as shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 1</ref>. Since our new threading method demonstrates its superiority over other similar methods such as HHpred, MUSTER, Phyre2 and SP3/SP5, in particular on low-homology targets without close homologs in the PDB. A natural extension of this work is to incorporate our new method into Zhang-Server to see how much we can advance the state-of-the-art of protein modeling.</p></div>

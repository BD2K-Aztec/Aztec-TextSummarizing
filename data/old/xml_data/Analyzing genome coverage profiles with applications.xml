				<p>Motivation: Genome coverage, the number of sequencing reads mapped to a position in a genome, is an insightful indicator of irregularities within sequencing experiments. While the average genome coverage is frequently used within algorithms in computational gen-omics, the complete information available in coverage profiles (i.e. histograms over all coverages) is currently not exploited to its full extent. Thus, biases such as fragmented or erroneous reference gen-omes often remain unaccounted for. Making this information accessible can improve the quality of sequencing experiments and quantitative analyses. Results: We introduce a framework for fitting mixtures of probability distributions to genome coverage profiles. Besides commonly used distributions, we introduce distributions tailored to account for common artifacts. The mixture models are iteratively fitted based on the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. We introduce use cases with focus on metagenomics and develop new analysis strategies to assess the validity of a reference genome with respect to (meta-) gen-omic read data. The framework is evaluated on simulated data as well as applied to a large-scale metagenomic study, for which we compute the validity of 75 microbial genomes. The results indicate that the choice and quality of reference genomes is vital for metagenomic analyses and that validation of coverage profiles is crucial to avoid incorrect conclusions. Availability: The code is freely available and can be downloaded from http://sourceforge.net/projects/fitgcp/.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Genome coverage, the number of sequencing reads mapped to a specific position within a reference genome, contains valuable information about reference genome and the mapping process and is easily accessible. Therefore, it is frequently consulted in bioinformatics analyses to improve decisions in algorithms or to provide meaningful information to the user. For instance, experimental design methods (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Lo¨werLo¨wer et al., 2012</ref>) guide the experimentalist to achieve a specific average sequencing depth (i.e. genome coverage). After sequencing, the obtained reads can be mapped to a reference genome. Quality control tools (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">DeLuca et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Garcıá-Alcalde et al., 2012</ref>) analyze the mapping data and report measures such as coverage information, mapping quality or error rate to the user. For example, Qualimap (<ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Garcıá-Alcalde et al., 2012</ref>) visualizes the coverage profile and the coverage over the whole genome together with the GC content, which allows detecting biases in the sequencing process. If no reference genome is available, the reads can be assembled to complete genomes or at least longer contiguous sequences (contigs). The latter is nowadays possible for metagenomic data, i.e. datasets containing reads of many different species with different abundances. The assembler MetaVelvet (<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Namiki et al., 2012</ref>) uses the coverage information in the de Bruijn graph to connect contigs of similar coverage, as they are more likely to belong to the same organism. In addition to these examples, local coverage information is also used for detecting copy number alterations in genomes (e.g.<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Miller et al., 2011</ref>). Despite these versatile applications of genome coverage, a vast amount of information commonly remains unused. Most current methods either use the average coverage over a certain sequence (<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">DeLuca et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Lo¨werLo¨wer et al., 2012</ref>) or describe the coverage profile using single probability distributions such as the negative binomial (<ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Miller et al., 2011</ref>) or gamma (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Hooper et al., 2010</ref>) distribution. Yet, to the best of our knowledge, more complex models such as mixtures of distributions are not used to fit genome coverage profiles (GCPs). Here, we suggest that more complex models can improve current methods and can open doors for new analysis strategies. We see one application of complex coverage distribution models in metagenomics, where reference-based methods have become increasingly popular with the advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Mande et al., 2012</ref>). However, there are two major problems with reference genomes. First, the process of assembling and finishing reference genomes is time consuming and cumbersome and many reference genomes remain unfinished in the draft stage with varying qualities depending on the used sequencing technologies (<ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Mavromatis et al., 2012</ref>). Draft genomes are typically a set of assembled contigs, where many contigs may be erroneous or, if assembled from metagenomic data, belong to different organisms. The second problem is of biological nature; evolution in the microbial world proceeds at high pace due to short replication times, and new subtypes or even species emerge perpetually. This causes different microbial species to have high genomic similarities. Therefore, the coverage is generally far from homogenous when mapping metagenomic reads to a reference genome; describing it with a single uni-modal *To whom correspondence should be addressed. distribution would not be appropriate. Here, more complex models can have the power to disentangle and quantify different contributors to the genome coverage. In this article, we present a framework for fitting complex mixtures of probability distributions to GCPs. We demonstrate in simulated experiments that the proposed framework can produce reliable and robust results and present a real data experiment, where we use our framework to reanalyze the data presented in a large-scale metagenomic study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">METHODS</head><p>The proposed method has four steps (<ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>). After mapping a set of sequence reads to a reference genome, the mapped reads are analyzed and a GCP is constructed. Then, a mixture model of customized probability distributions is fitted to the profile using an iterative procedure that is similar to the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Dempster et al., 1977</ref>), seeking to identify and distinguish different contributors in the profile. Further analysis on the fit parameters can then be used to answer questions about the reference genome and the mapping process, such as the validity of a reference genome or the occurrence of multiple related organisms in one dataset. The presented method is not a new invention in itself, it is rather a combination of established statistical methods, which we demonstrate to be useful for analyzing GCPs. The novelty of this contribution is the composition of the mixture models and the subsequent analysis steps.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Genome coverage profiles</head><p>When reads are mapped to a reference genome, the per-base coverage for each position in the reference genome is given as the number of reads covering that position. We term the histogram over all per-base coverages the GCP. A GCP encapsulates valuable information about the relation between the reference genome and the genome(s) contained in the dataset. In the following, we solely operate on GCPs, as they provide a condensed view on the mapping of reads to a reference genome. A GCP can take shape in various ways: First, if the reference genome matches perfectly to the reads contained in the dataset, the genome is homogeneously covered and the GCP consists of a uni-modal distribution, as depicted in<ref type="figure">Figure 2a</ref>. In reality, the reads and the reference genome will differ owing to mutations and errors in the reads. Therefore, the differing parts of the reference genome will not be covered by reads and lead to an excess of zero-coverage counts in the GCP, as shown in<ref type="figure">Figure 2b</ref>. Note that the distribution has a tail at low coverages, which we discuss in Section 2.5. As a third type (shown in<ref type="figure">Fig. 2c</ref>), a reference genome may have an overall low coverage as well as positions differing from the reads. Then, positions with zero coverage may be caused either by a locally differing sequence or the position was not covered by chance owing to the statistical fluctuations in the coverage. In addition to the three simple types, a GCP can also be a more complex combination of coverage distributions, as shown in<ref type="figure">Figure 2d</ref>. In this example, the dataset contained two genomes, A and B, with differing coverages. Both genomes share parts with the reference genome and also have similarities among each other.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Genome coverage distributions</head><p>In this section, we give a short overview of probability distributions, which we consider relevant for describing GCPs. The simplest assumption we can make is the random sampling property of shotgun sequencing devices, meaning that we assume a uniform distribution of the reads over the genome. When reads are mapped to a genome, the coverage of each position follows a Poisson distribution PðxjÞ. The Poisson distribution is well studied and has one parameter , which simplifies fitting observed distributions. However, the Poisson distribution is often too narrow for fitting real genome coverage distributions, in particular for metagenomic data. This effect is called over-dispersion and occurs frequently in biological data. A common way (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bliss and Fisher, 1953</ref>) to</p><formula>(a) ( b) (c) ( d)</formula><p>Fig. 2. Exemplary GCPs after mapping a set of reads to a reference genome. (a) Reads matching perfectly to reference genome. (b) Reference genome partially covered by reads; the covered areas have high coverage. (c) Reference genome partially covered by reads with low coverage. The dashed curve has a non-zero value at zero coverage and thus adds to the number of positions that were not covered due to disagreement with the reads. (d) Reference genome partially covered by reads from two organisms A and B with different abundances, yielding a mixture of four distributions: (i) a zero-distribution for the parts of the reference not covered, (ii) the coverage caused by organism A (mean ¼ 6Â, dotted curve), (iii) the coverage caused by organism B (mean ¼ 16Â, dashed curve) and (iv) the coverage where A and B map to the same position (22Â, dash-dotted curve)</p><p>Coverage Profile Model Fiing Analysis Read Mapping ?<ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>. Method overview. Starting with a set of reads mapped to a reference genome, we construct a GCP and fit a mixture of probability distributions to the profile. This procedure is the basis for further analysis steps concerning the reference genome, the mapping process and the read dataset account for over-dispersion is assuming that the Poisson parameter is distributed according to a second distribution. When is assumed to be gamma distributed, we obtain a negative binomial distribution NBðxja, bÞ, which has two shape parameters and is thus harder to fit than the Poisson distribution. However, the negative binomial turned out to model GCPs well for both high and low coverages and has been used, for example, in differential expression analysis (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Anders and Huber, 2010</ref>). In<ref type="figure">Figure 2b</ref>, we observed a tail on the low-coverage end of the main distribution. The magnitude of the tail depends on the fragmentation of the reference genome with mutations, as we discuss in detail in Section 2.5. The shape of the tail is determined by the original parent distribution; therefore, the tail distribution does not have its own shape parameters and can rather be considered as an extensional distribution. We implemented the Poisson tail and the negative binomial tail in our framework and give a detailed mathematical description in the Supplementary Text. Finally, we introduce the zero distribution z(x), which is useful to describe the excess of zero coverage positions. The zero distribution has probability 1 at zero, and 0 everywhere else. It is static as it has no shape parameters, but proves its usability in combination with other distributions. The zero-inflated Poisson and zero-inflated negative binomial are defined as mixed distributions of zero and Poisson or zero and negative binomial. These zero-inflated (ZI) distributions were used, for example, to model the number of defects in manufactured items (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Lambert, 1992</ref>), but can also be applied for GCPs: the areas where the reference genome agrees with the reads in the dataset yields a coverage distribution according to Poisson or negative binomial, the areas with disagreement are modeled by the zero distribution. We want to regard mixtures consisting of more than one probability distribution and write the joint distribution function as follows:</p><formula>fðx, jÞ ¼ 0 Á zðxÞ þ X k i¼1 i Á D i ðxj i Þ ð 1Þ</formula><p>where k is the number of non-zero distributions, i are the non-negative mixing coefficients that sum to 1 and give a weight to each distribution, and D i is a Poisson, negative binomial or tail distribution with the corresponding set of parameters i. Fitting these mixture models to data cannot be done directly, but requires an iterative method, as described in the following section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Iterative algorithm for fitting the mixture model</head><p>The algorithm starts with a set of initial parameters for the distributions D i that can either be user defined or estimated from the GCP. With every iteration, the algorithm adjusts the parameters to increase the likelihood of the data given the mixture model in Equation (1). The iteration is stopped when an accuracy threshold is reached, e.g. the change of the likelihood drops below a predefined value. The algorithm repeatedly computes the so-called expectation step followed by an adjustment of the parameter set to improve the accuracy with which the corresponding model describes the data, i.e. the likelihood of the data given the model with parameters after iteration t þ 1 should be greater or equal to the likelihood after iteration t. This assumption is guaranteed if maximum likelihood estimation is used when adjusting the parameter set. In this case, the procedure is known as the EM algorithm (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Dempster et al., 1977</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.1">Expectation step</head><p>Following the initialization, the expectation step estimates conditional probabilities identical to the EM algorithm. Using the current set of parameters ðtÞ , we compute for each observed coverage value the probability of belonging to distribution D i. With these coverage-wise probabilities, we re-estimate the mixing coefficients i for each distribution D i. See Supplementary Text for more details.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.2">Parameter estimation step</head><p>In the second step, we optimize the parameter set ðtÞ by fitting the mixture model with respect to the previously calculated mixing coefficients ðtÞ. When fitting the distributions D i , we have to decide whether to use moment-based or maximum likelihood estimates. Using the method of moments, for 1-(2-) parametric distributions, we take the sample mean (the sample mean and the variance, respectively) and calculate the distribution parameters from these moments. Maximum likelihood estimation directly selects a set of parameters ðtÞ that maximizes the likelihood. Owing to the nature of our data there is no ultimate solution. Either method might be more suitable depending on the situation. Yet, for the negative binomial distribution, there is no closed form of the maximum likelihood estimator and requires application of, for example, Newton's method. The method of moments proves to yield similar results for the negative binomial distribution and is numerically more robust. The zero and the tail distributions do not require parameter estimation as the former has no shape parameters and the latter inherits the parameters from the parent distribution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Genome–Dataset Validity score</head><p>The standard scenario is that we have one reference genome and a set of genomic reads originating from one or more unknown genome(s). Then, we define the Genome–Dataset Validity (GDV) score as the fraction of the reference genome that has a counterpart in the genome(s) underlying the reads. The true similarity of the two sequences is not directly observable, as the unknown genome is realized as a set of short reads. The naı¨venaı¨ve way to estimate the similarity of both sequences is by mapping the reads to the genome and measuring the fraction of the genome that was covered by reads. This estimate can be sufficiently good for high genome coverages, such as coverages above 10Â. Here, the likelihood that a location shared between both genomes remains uncovered is negligibly small. Almost all sites on the known genome not covered by reads can be considered to be different from the unknown genome. In contrast, for low abundances, the probability that a base is not covered by reads although it is shared by both genomes can not be neglected anymore. Assume, for example, a simple model where the base coverages over the genome follow a Poisson distribution. While the probability of not covering a base at 10Â coverage is 0.0045%, it rises to 13.5% for 2Â coverage and 36.8% for 1Â coverage. The described iterative algorithm can improve on the naı¨venaı¨ve approach and provide reliable estimates for much lower coverages. Depending on the coverage distribution, we can fit a mixture of a Poisson or negative binomial distribution and a zero distribution to the GCP. The contribution of the zero distribution should then roughly correspond to the fraction of the reference genome that has no counterpart in the unknown genome(s). Therefore, we calculate the GDV score as follows:</p><formula>GDV ¼ 1 À 0 :</formula><p>This calculation has a clear advantage over the naı¨venaı¨ve approach: at low coverages, the probability that a position is not covered by chance (and not due to dissimilarity) is high, and the naı¨venaı¨ve approach is at risk of overestimating the fraction of the genome with no counterpart. In contrast, the mixture model approach makes use of the positions with higher coverage to estimate the probability of obtaining zero coverage by chance and thus provides more realistic and more reliable estimates.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Genome fragmentation estimation</head><p>In addition to the pure similarity of the sequencing reads and the reference genome, we can also question how fragmented the reference genome is with respect to the reads. With fragmentation, we mean the number of contiguous sequence fragments in the genome that conform with the reads. For example, single-nucleotide polymorphisms, insertions or deletions in the reads with respect to the reference genome can be the cause for genome fragmentation. As discussed in detail in the Supplementary Text, the effects at the fragment borders manifest in a tail structure in the GCP. The tail distributions can be included in the mixture model in Equation (1) and their mixing coefficients can be estimated with the described iterative algorithm. The size of the tail (i.e. Tail ) allows estimating the genome fragmentation directly, as the size of the tail depends on the number of fragment borders. With the genome length L and the read length RL, the number of fragments can be estimated as follows:</p><formula>Frag % Tail Á L 2 Á RL : ð2Þ</formula><p>A high fragmentation of the genome gives rise to additional correction terms for models with zero inflation. Due to the excess of zero coverage positions at fragment borders, which is most pronounced for genomes with partially non-zero low (1 Â À10Â) coverage and zero coverage elsewhere, we introduce a correction term z corr for the mixing coefficient of the zero component of the model. The correction term is a function of the number of fragments in the genome Frag, the genome length L and the average delay d of the first read mapped behind a fragment border:</p><formula>z corr ¼ 2 Á Frag Á d L :</formula><p>We provide a detailed derivation of the number of fragments and the correction term in the Supplementary Text.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS</head><p>The framework described in the previous section provides a powerful tool for solving problems related to reference genomes and genome coverage distributions. Here we present three experiments that demonstrate the applicability of the framework in a metagenomic context. In the first experiment, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can fit complex mixtures of distributions to GCPs and evaluate the influence of the choice of model on the fit quality. In the second experiment, we demonstrate the robustness of the framework: quantities calculated from the GCP fits (here: GDV scores) are stable over a wide range of genome coverages. This is crucial in metagenomics, where the number of mapped reads per genome is typically small, but can be high for single abundant species. In the third experiment, we apply the framework on real data and thereby illustrate a further application: we reanalyze data from a largescale human gut metagenomic study and compute the GDV scores for a selected set of reference genomes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Fitting complex mixture models</head><p>In this experiment, we evaluate the performance of the algorithm for fitting complex mixture models to multi-modal GCPs. Thus, we created a dataset with reads of two organisms sharing large genomic regions, Escherichia coli and Shigella boydii. We simulated 100 000 reads for E.coli and 600 000 reads for S.boydii with 75 bp length and Illumina sequencing characteristics using the Mason read simulator (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Holtgrewe, 2010</ref>). These reads were then mapped to the E.coli reference genome with Bowtie (<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Langmead et al., 2009</ref>). We expected the genome to be homogeneously covered by the E.coli reads and locally by additional S.boydii reads. Yet, the number of E.coli reads could only account for 1:5Â coverage. This challenged the algorithm in two ways. First, the low E.coli coverage caused a fraction of genome positions to have zero coverage; yet, they should not be explained by a zero distribution. Second, the S.boydii fragments with high coverage produced a tail in the GCP, which overlapped with the E.coli distribution. For fitting, we used models consisting of three components: (i) a zero distribution (abbreviated by z), (ii) a Poisson (p) or negative binomial (n) distribution for the E.coli reads and (iii) a Poisson, negative binomial, Poisson with tail (pt) or negative binomial with tail (nt) distribution for the S.boydii reads. The initialization was chosen such that component (ii) fitted the E.coli peak and (iii) fitted the S.boydii peak. All models were fitted to the GCP using an accuracy threshold of 0.1% and the zero-correction was calculated for the models with tail distribution. To compare the models by numbers, we calculated the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test statistic, the maximum absolute difference d max between the observed and the estimated cumulative mass function.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 3</ref>depicts the fits of selected mixture models, and detailed results about the mixing coefficients and fit errors are provided in the Supplementary Table. The results show a prominent difference between models with and without tail: models with tail fit the observed GCP much better (average d max ¼ 0:0022) than the models without tail (average d max ¼ 0:0073). The simplest model, zpp (see<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Fig. 3a</ref>), yields the highest fit error of all models (d max ¼ 0:0141). For the models without tail, the fit error decreases as the model complexity (parameters to fit) increases. The difference of the fit error between the models with tail is overall lower than between the models without tail: the lowest fit error is achieved by zpnt (d max ¼ 0:0018), the highest by znnt (d max ¼ 0:0026). In particular, the fit error does not decrease with increasing model complexity. Furthermore, the model fits with tail are highly similar: besides the similar fit error, they also have almost identical mean values for the two non-zero distributions<ref type="bibr">[</ref>) do not reduce the fit error. The spare distributions either take the same shape as one of the two original distributions or their mixing coefficients are reduced to zero, depending on the start parameters. This experiment shows that our algorithm can fit complex mixture models to GCPs accurately. Best results are obtained when the complexity and the selected distributions in the model match the data, but more complex models do not decrease accuracy and should thus be chosen in doubt. The low fit errors of the models with tail distribution support the usefulness of the tail distribution concept. Although our iterative algorithm is not guaranteed to converge to an optimal solution as EM does, we see that the fit results are highly similar, in particular for the models with tail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Influence of average coverage</head><p>In this experiment, we demonstrate the robustness of our framework over a wide range of genome coverages. Information about the genomes—both the source of the reads and the reference—derived from GCPs should generally not be affected by the overall number of reads mapped to the reference genome. We used the Shigella flexneri genome as reference and simulated datasets of short (75 bp) Illumina reads from the E.coli genome with Mason. The smallest dataset contained 1000, the largest 10 Million E.coli reads. We used Bowtie to map these datasets to the S.flexneri reference genome and fitted ZI Poisson and ZI negative binomial models, both with and without zero correction, to the GCPs. The GDV score was calculated for each model based on the fit parameters as described in Section 2.4. The true GDV score was estimated from the dataset with 10 Million simulated E.coli reads to be 0.826. Due to the high coverage, at least one read starts at each position in the E.coli genome, and a mapping should therefore cover all fragments in the S.flexneri genome that are identical with E.coli and at least 75 bp long. The estimated GDV score of S.flexneri for the E.coli reads is summarized in<ref type="figure">Figure 4</ref>and Supplementary<ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure S3</ref>.<ref type="bibr">Curve (a)</ref>shows the estimated GDV score for the ZI Poisson mixture models (without and with zero correction), (b) for the corresponding ZI negative binomial models. The estimated GDV score of the S.flexneri genome is close to the estimated true GDV score (gray dotted line) for all mixture models when the number of reads is above 1 Million. In the range from 100 000 to 1 Million reads, the ZI Poisson with correction yields the best estimates; it keeps the estimates on an almost constant level. For the ZI negative binomial model, the correction has a much smaller influence and the estimates are slightly worse than the corrected Poisson model. In the low-coverage regime (below 1:5Â coverage or 100 000 reads), the tail effect is not observed anymore and all models reduce to the ZI Poisson and ZI negative binomial, respectively. The Poisson model yields lower estimates as the number of reads decreases and therefore becomes increasingly unreliable. On the other hand, the negative binomial model yields relatively good estimates down to low numbers of reads ($10 000), which corresponds to only 0:16Â coverage in the covered fragments.</p><p>The results of this experiment suggest two different strategies for the selection of the mixture models: for coverages below 1Â, the plain ZI negative binomial distribution yields the best results and allows determining the GDV score with acceptable accuracy.

The charts show the estimated fraction of the S. flexneri genome that is similar to the E.coli genome, i.e. the GDV score, depending on the average coverage of the S.flexneri genome with E.coli reads.

The gray dotted line is the estimated true GDV score model is 2-fold: in addition to the better estimates, the Poisson model has one parameter less than the negative binomial model, and parameter estimation is faster. Conclusively, we see that the estimated GDV score is largely independent of genome coverage and estimation is possible even below 1Â coverage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Application: metagenomics</head><p>The validity of reference genomes is crucial for a sound interpretation of the data, in particular in metagenomics. Thus, we estimate GDV scores on real metagenomic data. The work by<ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Qin et al. (2010)</ref>serves as a test case; they sequenced the metagenomic communities in faecal samples of 124 European individuals on the Illumina platform (75 bp paired end reads) and conducted exhaustive analysis to provide insight into the composition of genes and bacterial species in the human gut. As one result, they report a list of 75 prevalent bacterial species, the common core, which were present (genome coverage 41%) in a large number of individuals. We obtained the original reference genomes of the common core and selected 17 genomes that were originally found in all 124 individuals with at least 1% coverage. The metagenomic reads of individual MH0012 were downloaded from the corresponding EBI database (accession numbers: ERX004076–ERX004082). In this experiment, we estimated the GDV score of the selected reference genomes with respect to the metagenome of individual MH0012. The 93 Million paired-end Illumina reads were mapped to the selected reference genomes using Bowtie 2 (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</ref>), and the coverage profile was calculated subsequently for each genome. We used Bowtie 2 here, as the metagenomic data and the quality of the reference genomes requires a higher tolerance toward mismatches between reads and reference, which cannot be accomplished with Bowtie. In the next step, we fitted a mixture model of a zero distribution, two negative binomial distributions (with maximum likelihood estimation), and a negative binomial tail distribution to the GCPs. We preferred the negative binomial over the Poisson distribution here, as we expected over-dispersion due to a high biological variability in the metagenomic data. Two negative binomial distributions were chosen with genomic similarities in mind, where one distribution should fit the matches from the correct species and the other distribution should account for the noisy matches obtained by organisms with partial sequence similarity. The fit error was calculated as in the first experiment. The run time of the framework was measured for the 17 selected reference genomes. Fitting the model to the GCP was accomplished on average within 2.9 s (minimum: 2.1 s, maximum: 4.5 s). Another 1–3 min need to be added for calculating the GCP from the SAM file before fitting. In general, we observe that the run time is strongly correlated to the number of matching reads, i.e. the genome coverage, and the complexity of the model. The GDV score of the 17 selected reference genomes is shown in<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 5</ref>and ranges from 0.140 (Clostridium sp. M621) to 0.965 (Bacteroides vulgatus). All genomes have a moderate average coverage (minimum 8Â, maximum 47Â), and the coverage has only low correlation to the GDV score (Pearson correlation coefficient: r ¼ 0:34). The fit error is below 0.02 for all genomes except Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. Despite the high-error level compared with the first experiment, manual inspection of the fits indicates that the assumed model is sufficient for the complexity of data. Manual inspection of F.prausnitzii showed that the GCP was too complex for the assumed model and required an additional negative binomial component.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">DISCUSSION</head><p>We introduced GCPs as a means to extract quantitative information from mapping data. By fitting mixtures of probabilitydistributions to the GCP, we obtain valuable information about the reference genomes and the mapping process, such as the fraction of the genome that could not be covered by reads or if there is more than one organism contributing to the coverage. This makes the proposed framework a powerful tool for the analysis of mapping data without restriction to the application. The introduced GDV score is a simple, yet powerful, measure for how well a reference genome fits to the mapped reads. Especially in metagenomics, reference genomes are typically not required to fit perfectly to the data; nevertheless, the degree of divergence should not become too large. As one example, we observed a GDV score of 0.82 in the experiment in Section 3.2, where we mapped E.coli reads to a S.flexneri genome. This illustrates a relatively high biological divergence between data and reference despite a high GDV score. We assessed GDV scores in a real metagenomic experiment conducted by Qin et al. (2010) and observed surprisingly low scores for genomes that were originally considered to be present in the dataset; only 9 of 75 reference genomes achieved scores 40.8. This is an imposing example for high discrepancy between metagenomic data and reference genomes, which we presume to be a common challenge of metagenomic experiments. One of the major reasons might be the quality of the reference genomes: as microbes from metagenomic experiments are typically not cultivable, their genomes must be assembled from environmental samples, which is significantly more complicated and error prone than assembly from pure samples. In the experiment at hand, 37 of 75 reference genomes consisted of 4100 (up to 1700) separate contigs, only six genomes were one contiguous sequence. The framework proposed and applied in this work makes these flaws quantifiable. The first experiment showed that the iterative algorithm is able to fit complex mixtures of highly specialized probability distributions to GCPs. The impact of the tail distributions became apparent, as they significantly reduced the fit error. The second experiment showed that quantities calculated on fitted GCPs are robust toward influences of the average genome coverage. There, we observed stable estimates of the GDV score over a wide range of coverages, starting at average coverages below 0:2Â. Although our method is robust toward the average coverage, it can be sensitive to the mapping parameters: more restrictive mapper settings typically yield a lower GDV score and a higher influence of the tail distributions. This has to be considered when comparing GDV scores over different experiments. The iterative algorithm encounters limitations in extreme cases, for example, when the average coverage is very low, but locally extremely high. This can be the case when a genome is not present in the data, but shares a gene with other highly abundant genomes. Then, the algorithm may fail to fit the low-coverage distribution, as intended by the user, but tries to fit the extremely high noise contributions. In other cases, the standard start parameters are inappropriate, such that the algorithm ends up in a local probability maximum instead of fitting the distribution as intended. These problems demonstrate that visual inspection of the fit is necessary and this is supported by the framework. Common strategies used for the EM algorithm are also possible, such as the initialization with different or manually determined starting parameters.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><figDesc>distribution (ii): 1:57551:60; distribution (iii): 10:545510:57]. The relative sizes of the tail distributions are on par with the other distributions, indicating a high degree of fragmentation of the E.coli genome compared with S.boydii. The number of S.boydii fragments in E.coli can be estimated via Equation (2); depending on the model, there are between 8032 and 8289 S.boydii fragments in the E.coli genome.

			<note place="foot">Considering that E.coli reads mapped to a S.flexneri genome yield a GDV score of 40.8, as demonstrated in the previous experiment, the numbers observed in this experiment are rather low. One reason may be that the selected reference genomes originally served as representatives for clusters of similar genomes. Furthermore, most reference genomes were sets of separate contigs, indicating that the reference genomes could be incomplete or have low quality. This is prototypic for metagenomics, as the majority of bacteria are still not or only poorly sequenced, such that a reference genome with low GDV score may be not a good, but the best possible choice. The only highquality reference genome (no contigs) is B.vulgatus, which achieves by far the highest GDV score (GDV ¼ 0:96). A similar picture can be observed on the full set of 75 genomes (see Supplementary Figure); the GDV scores are in the range from 0.013 (Enterococcus faecalis) up to 0.998 (Clostridium leptum). Interestingly, four out of the seven best scored genomes are high-quality genomes and the other three have5100 contigs. Manual validation confirmed the high validity and showed homogenous coverage over the genomes, only interrupted by small gaps and single high-coverage parts. On the other hand, the genome with the worst score—the gut bacterium E.faecalis— is also a high-quality genome. Manual validation showed that E.faecalis was not covered homogeneously. This underlines the features of the GDV score: to achieve a high validity, reference genomes must be homogeneously covered by reads and must have high quality. A high genome quality but a low and inhomogeneous coverage, indicating that the species itself is not present, is correctly penalized by a low score.</note>

			<note place="foot">Here, we focused on applications in metagenomics; however, the information obtained by fitting the coverage distribution is by no means limited to metagenomics but can be used for other purposes, such as experimental design and sequencing depth estimation (Hooper et al., 2010), the detection of copy number variations (Miller et al., 2011) or metagenome assembly (Namiki et al., 2012). As an example, metagenomic sequencing experiments can be designed in a way, such that the GDV score can be calculated robustly for reference genomes with a certain minimum abundance in the sample. The minimum amount of sequencing required can be found by finding the minimum required coverage for a robust GDV score calculation in a simulation-based experiment, as presented in Section 3.2. Tools for estimating species abundances in metagenomic data, such as GRAMMy (Xia et al., 2011), GASiC (Lindner and Renard, 2012) or READSCAN (Naeem et al., 2013), can make use of the GDV score to more precisely estimate the abundance of the organism truly contained in the dataset, if the used reference genomes have a low validity. Observations give rise to the assumption that our method is applicable to single contigs in unfinished reference genomes. There, the GDV score may support the identification of chimeric or erroneous contigs and thus contribute to the improvement of reference genomes. New applications arise, for example, in metagenomics where the information from the GCPs can be used to estimate the evolutionary distance of unknown organisms in the data to known organisms by mapping the reads to the known genomes and calculating GDV scores. In conjecture with phylogenetic information, the GDV score can be used to narrow the truly contained organism down to a certain area of a phylogenetic tree by excluding reference genomes yielding a lower GDV score. 5 CONCLUSION Genome coverage information is commonly consulted for assessing the quality of mapping data. Yet, we argue that the coverage information is not sufficiently exploited and does allow a deeper evaluation of the mapping process and the suitability of reference genomes. Thus, we introduced GCPs as a powerful tool to extract valuable information about the interplay of read data and reference genomes and described an algorithm for fitting specialized probability distribution functions to GCPs. In simulated experiments, we showed that the proposed algorithm performs well on complex GCPs and over a wide range of genome coverages, including coverages as low as 0:2Â. We demonstrated a use case of our framework in metagenomics, where we could apply our approach to quantify the discrepancy of metagenomic data and reference genomes. The observations suggest that the selection of reference genomes for metagenomic experiments should be done carefully and the validity of the reference genomes should be integrated in the further analysis.</note>

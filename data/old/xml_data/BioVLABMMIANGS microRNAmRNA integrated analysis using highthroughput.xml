				<p>Motivation: It is now well established that microRNAs (miRNAs) play a critical role in regulating gene expression in a sequence-specific manner, and genome-wide efforts are underway to predict known and novel miRNA targets. However, the integrated miRNA–mRNA analysis remains a major computational challenge, requiring powerful informatics systems and bioinformatics expertise. Results: The objective of this study was to modify our widely recognized Web server for the integrated mRNA–miRNA analysis (MMIA) and its subsequent deployment on the Amazon cloud (BioVLAB-MMIA) to be compatible with high-throughput platforms, including next-generation sequencing (NGS) data (e.g. RNA-seq). We developed a new version called the BioVLAB-MMIA-NGS, deployed on both Amazon cloud and on a high-performance publicly available server called MAHA. By using NGS data and integrating various bio-informatics tools and databases, BioVLAB-MMIA-NGS offers several advantages. First, sequencing data is more accurate than array-based methods for determining miRNA expression levels. Second, potential novel miRNAs can be detected by using various computational methods for characterizing miRNAs. Third, because miRNA-mediated gene regulation is due to hybridization of an miRNA to its target mRNA, sequencing data can be used to identify many-to-many relationship between miRNAs and target genes with high accuracy.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>miRNAs are small (19–24 nt) single-stranded non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression by specific targeting mechanism to mRNA molecules via complementary sequence pairing. Due to their critical implication in post-transcriptional regulation and impact on the developmental process, a number of (microRNA) miRNA–mRNA integrated analysis tools have been developed. MAGIA (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Sales et al., 2010</ref>) uses miRNA– mRNA expression profile matrices as input and provides gene set analysis and miRNA target prediction. DIANA-mirExTra (<ref type="bibr">Alexiou et al., 2010</ref>) accepts gene sets and computationally compares miRNA-associated motifs. miRGator (<ref type="bibr">Cho et al., 2013)</ref>provides pre-compiled public resources with browser interface to navigate data. However, several limitations exist for these and other existing tools, including the following: (i) support only microarray or sequencing data but not both; (ii) require preprocessing or manual data compiling step; (iii) demand cumbersome installation procedures with interdependent tools and databases; (iv) run on limited computational resources that are not capable of handling large datasets. Here we present the next-generation sequencing (NGS) data-compatible BioVLABMMIA-NGS, an updated version of our array-based miRNA– mRNA integrated analysis system mRNA–miRNA analysis (MMIA) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Nam et al., 2009)</ref>3 FEATURES Workflow: In BioVLAB-MMIA-NGS, the integrated analysis workflow begins with extracting differentially and (or) significantly expressed miRNAs (DEmiR) as in our previous published methodology (<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Xin et al., 2009</ref>). To identify miRNAs and their expression level, we adopted the miRDeep (<ref type="bibr">Friedl€ ander et al., 2011</ref>(<ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Kozomara and Griffiths-Jones, 2010</ref>), and the quantifier module measures expression levels based on read counts. Quality control and adaptor clipping processes are performed if necessary. Significance of expressed miRNAs is tested and visualized by DESeq (<ref type="bibr">Anders and Huber., 2010</ref>) based on read count measures. Differentially expressed mRNAs/genes (DEG)s are extracted by using the Tophat–Cufflinks pipeline (<ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Trapnell et al., 2012</ref>) with junction aligning based on the RPKM measure. Statistical significance is visualized by cummeRbund (<ref type="bibr">Goff et al., 2012</ref>). For microarray data, DEGs and DEmiRs are detected by Limma package (<ref type="bibr">Smyth, 2005</ref>). Once DEGs and DEmiRs are extracted, the next step, miRNA–mRNA combined analysis, is performed. For the combined analysis, we used miRNA target prediction algorithms/databases, TargetScan (<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Lewis et al., 2005</ref>), PITA (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Kertesz et al., 2007</ref>), miRSVR (<ref type="bibr">Betel et al., 2010</ref>) and PMTED (<ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Sun et al., 2013</ref>), as well as negative correlations between miRNAs and mRNAs, to extract DEGs targeted by DEmiRs. Gene set analysis is performed using extracted DEGs. Gene sets are automatically submitted to DAVID (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Huang et al., 2007</ref>) to provide functional annotation and clustering, BioCarta and KEGG (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Kanehisa and Goto, 2000</ref>) pathways mapping, and disease association.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>shows BioVLAB-MMIA-NGS workflow.</p><p>User interface: BioVLAB-MMIA-NGS keeps the user-friendly Web-based interface for sample information, analysis options and parameters, and computing nodes. To provide extended analysis interface, we integrated IGV (<ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Thorvaldsd ottir et al., 2013</ref>) for visualizing the alignment results with zoom in/out functionality with annotation tracks and Cytoscape (<ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Shannon et al., 2003</ref>) for illustrating identified miRNA–mRNA target networks. By using JAWS, IGV and Cytoscape automatically visualize the results; manual installation and data handling processes are not required. A Web page summarizing all the results helps the users to view and further investigate the data.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig.1.</head><figDesc>Fig. 1.

			<note place="foot" n="2"> APPROACH To perform integrated analyses between miRNA and mRNA using NGS data, we completely redesigned the MMIA Web server. BioVLAB-MMIA-NGS uses sequencing data to directly measure miRNA and mRNA expression levels on a genome scale and accurately detect changes in quantity based on read count. The system accepts raw sequencing data as input without requiring any preprocessing steps. By using RNA-seq and small RNA-seq data, not only can BioVLAB-MMIA-NGS predict novel miRNA candidates, it can also extract new information about miRNA targeting of intragenic regions, exons and introns as well as 3 0 UTRs, which have recently been used in the integrated analysis in plants (Meng et al., 2013). Furthermore, to completely remove the burden of manually installing additional analysis tools, BioVLAB-MMIA-NGS adopts Java Web start (JAWS), a single click JAVA application deployment technology. Moreover, to support large NGS data analysis, the preprocessing and computational processes in BioVLAB-MMIA-NGS moved data to Amazon cloud and peta-scale super computing system called MAHA (http://www.etri.re.kr/eng/res/res_ 06020402.etri).</note>

			<note place="foot">System: The information system architecture has also adopted several important changes. The analysis begins from the Web interface, and the graphical workflow composer shows progress status. In addition, BioVLAB, the cloud infrastructure used in our previous system, has been completely rebuilt using Apache Airavata (http://airavata.apache.org/), generating a highly flexible and extensible three-layered BioVLAB-MMIA-NGS architecture. Moreover, BioVLAB-MMIA-NGS now supports human, mouse and rice genomes. Funding: This work was supported by the IT R&amp;D program of MSIP/KEIT.

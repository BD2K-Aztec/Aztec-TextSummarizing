			<abstract>
				<p>Motivation: The existence of families with many individuals affected by the same complex disease has long suggested the possibility of rare alleles of high penetrance. In contrast to Mendelian diseases, however, linkage studies have identified very few reproducibly linked loci in diseases such as diabetes and autism. Genome-wide association studies have had greater success with such diseases, but these results explain neither the extreme disease load nor the within-family linkage peaks, of some large pedigrees. Combining linkage information with exome or genome sequencing from large complex disease pedigrees might finally identify family-specific, high-penetrance mutations. Results: Olorin is a tool, which integrates gene flow within families with next generation sequencing data to enable the analysis of complex disease pedigrees. Users can interactively filter and prioritize variants based on haplotype sharing across selected individuals and other measures of importance, including predicted functional consequence and population frequency.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Next generation sequencing has rapidly become the standard approach for identifying mutations responsible for Mendelian diseases (<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Bamshad et al., 2011</ref>). Although software and file formats for the processing of raw sequence data are relatively robust (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Danecek et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Li et al., 2009</ref>), there is currently a lack of easy-to-use software for downstream analysis of these data. For some study designs, such as focused analysis of fully penetrant de novo mutations or autosomal recessive inheritance, exome sequence data can be analysed and filtered relatively simply. Increasingly, however, sequence-based approaches are being applied to complex diseases, which are unlikely to follow a simple genetic model, such as autism (<ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Neale et al., 2012</ref>), and to more complicated scenarios, such as large pedigrees with incomplete penetrance. These studies require new tools to enable the diverse community of researchers working on such families to interactively and comprehensively analyze next generation sequence data.<ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>shows how our new program, Olorin, integrates within-family linkage analysis with exome sequencing in a user-friendly package.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">FEATURES</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">File formats</head><p>Olorin uses four types of data file: two that provide information about the gene flow calculated by MERLIN (<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abecasis et al., 2002</ref>), one defining the pedigree structure, and a list of variants identified by sequencing. MERLIN's haplotyping functionality is used to compute haplotype inheritance within the pedigree. Details of the genomic markers used in the estimation of haplotypes, and pedigree information about the relationships between individuals and their disease status are read from standard.map and.ped MERLIN format files. All variants identified from sequencing across samples need to be provided as a single variant call format (VCF) file (version 4.0 or greater) (<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Danecek et al., 2011</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Workflow</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1">Selecting individuals</head><p>On loading data, Olorin automatically generates an interactive pedigree using standard conventions for information such as sex and disease status. Users can *To whom correspondence should be addressed.This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/), which permits unrestricted reuse, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. obtain additional information, such as whether a particular individual has been sequenced, via a mouseover popup box. To begin filtering variants, the user first needs to select individuals to be used in searching for shared genomic segments by clicking on them in the pedigree (<ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2">Initial variant filtering</head><p>After selecting individuals, the user can customize the analysis via a filtering dialog (<ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>). First, they set the minimum number of individuals required to share a segment. This enables searches for variants of incomplete penetrance if the threshold is set below the total number of affected individuals in the pedigree. Next, the user can select which information fields from the VCF will be included for subsequent filtering and display. A population frequency cut-off can also be specified at this point if (as is often the case) the study design is focused on variants expected to be rare in healthy individuals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.3">Dynamic variant filtering</head><p>Olorin populates an analysis table (<ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>) with variants found in the shared segments. This table can be sorted on any column, and variants in the table can be filtered out in real time using a number of filtering tools (<ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref>), which are dynamically generated based on the user-selected data fields. Olorin can show variants discovered in any or all of these individuals, depending on the genetic model under consideration.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig.1.</head><figDesc>Fig. 1. Olorin uses patterns of gene flow estimated by MERLIN to identify genomic regions shared by affected individuals in large pedigrees. This information is combined with next generation sequence data, and only those variants that lie within shared regions are analysed. Users can further refine the list of variants using Olorin's realtime filtering tools</figDesc></figure>

			<note place="foot" n="2">.2.4 Predicted variant effects Because the &apos;consequence&apos; strings in the VCF information field contain a wealth of parseable information, Olorin supports further processing of two variant consequence string formats: the UK10K analysis pipeline format and the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor format (McLaren et al., 2010). Because each variant can have multiple consequences, Olorin automatically selects and displays only the most damaging effect for each variant, showing the remainder via a popup box. 3 IMPLEMENTATION Olorin is written in Java and will work on any platform with Java 1.6 or later installed. The interactive pedigree is drawn using the PedVizAPI (Fuchsberger et al., 2008). The genome-wide sharing plots are generated using source code from the visualization tool, IdeogramBrowser (Muïler et al., 2007).</note>

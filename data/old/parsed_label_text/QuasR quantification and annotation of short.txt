QuasR is a package for the integrated analysis of high-throughput sequencing data in R, covering all steps from read preprocessing, alignment and quality control to quantification. QuasR supports different experiment types (including RNA-seq, ChIP-seq and Bis-seq) and analysis variants (e.g. paired-end, stranded, spliced and allele-specific), and is integrated in Bioconductor so that its output can be directly processed for statistical analysis and visualization. Availability and implementation: QuasR is implemented in R and C/Cþþ. Source code and binaries for major platforms (Linux, OS X and MS Windows) are available from Bioconductor (www.biocon-ductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/QuasR.html). The package includes a vignette with step-by-step examples for typical work flows.
IntroductionHigh-throughput sequencing has become a powerful research tool in a wide range of applications, such as transcriptome profiling (RNAseq), measurement of DNA-protein interactions or chromatin modifications (ChIP-seq) and DNA methylation (Bis-seq). In the last years, there have been many efforts to provide software in R/ Bioconductor () to simplify data processing and biological interpretation, such as an efficient framework for working with genomic ranges (), or tools for read alignment (), quality control () and statistical analysis (). It is however still challenging to conduct a complete analysis from raw data to a publishable result in the form of a single R script, which would greatly improve documentation and thus facilitate the exchange of analysis details with coworkers. Often it is necessary to perform a subset of tasks outside of R, for example on

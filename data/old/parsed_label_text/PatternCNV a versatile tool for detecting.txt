Motivation: Exome sequencing (exome-seq) data, which are typically used for calling exonic mutations, have also been utilized in detecting DNA copy number variations (CNVs). Despite the existence of several CNV detection tools, there is still a great need for a sensitive and an accurate CNV-calling algorithm with built-in QC steps, and does not require a paired reference for each sample. Results: We developed a novel method named PatternCNV, which (i) accounts for the read coverage variations between exons while lever-aging the consistencies of this variability across different samples; (ii) reduces alignment BAM files to WIG format and therefore greatly accelerates computation; (iii) incorporates multiple QC measures designed to identify outlier samples and batch effects; and (iv) provides a variety of visualization options including chromosome, gene and exon-level views of CNVs, along with a tabular summarization of the exon-level CNVs. Compared with other CNV-calling algorithms using data from a lymphoma exome-seq study, PatternCNV has higher sensitivity and specificity. Availability and implementation: The software for PatternCNV is implemented using Perl and R, and can be used in Mac or Linux environments. Software and user manual are available at http:// bioinformaticstools.mayo.edu/research/patterncnv/, and R package at https://github.com/topsoil/patternCNV/.
INTRODUCTIONDNA copy number variations (CNVs) are genomic structural changes that result in regional or chromosomal loss or gain of DNA copies (). Owing to the significant roles in human diseases, various laboratory techniques have been developed to detect CNVs, including recently advanced massive parallel sequencing of whole genomes and coding exomes. For exome-seq, it is commonly observed that coverage depths of short reads across regions vary, caused by different target capture efficiencies (), as well as the differences in mappability of exons. Such coverage variations impose substantial challenges for reliable CNV detection. Most existing methods use a paired-sample approach, based on the intuitive assumption that somatic sample and its paired reference share similar coverage bias that can be cancelled out through pairing (). Although this assumption approximately holds, it oversimplifies the problem with two limitations unaddressed: (i) The region-specific noise (coverage variability) of a local region is not accounted for, leading to amplified noise in log-ratio values of coverage between sample and the paired reference. (ii) In the case of a missing or low-quality reference sample, CNV detection based on paired reference will be infeasible or have degraded accuracy/sensitivity. A recent published method, FishingCNV, tried to address the second limitation by using the average of multiple reference samples as the denominators in log-ratio calculation, but did not address the regional noises in individual samples (the numerator), which led to false CNV calls (details in Supplementary Section S2.3). Considering these issues, we proposed a novel method called PatternCNV, which summarizes overall consistent patterns of both depths and variability of exonic region coverage across samples, where 'patterns' of coverage and variability are summarized using multiple 'normal' or reference samples. We observed that the same patterns only exist between samples prepared using the same version of exome capture kit. During CNV detection, we compute the differences of observed coverage versus the common pattern, while penalizing regions associated with larger variability using a weighting scheme. Further, wholegenome CNV can be interpolated from exon-level CNV using any third-party segmentation method, e.g. circular binary segmentation (). The PatternCNV was implemented in two different versions: a Mac and Linux/Unix version, and an R package version. We also developed a conversion tool to transform Binary version *To whom correspondence should be addressed. y The authors wish it to be known that, in their opinion, the first two authors should be regarded as joint First Authors.

When compared with other state-of-the-art CNV algorithms in a lymphoma case study, PatternCNV displayed higher resolution and greater sensitivity/specificity.

Motivation: The integration of multiple datasets remains a key challenge in systems biology and genomic medicine. Modern high-throughput technologies generate a broad array of different data types, providing distinct—but often complementary—information. We present a Bayesian method for the unsupervised integrative modelling of multiple datasets, which we refer to as MDI (Multiple Dataset Integration). MDI can integrate information from a wide range of different datasets and data types simultaneously (including the ability to model time series data explicitly using Gaussian processes). Each dataset is modelled using a Dirichlet-multinomial allocation (DMA) mixture model, with dependencies between these models captured through parameters that describe the agreement among the datasets. Results: Using a set of six artificially constructed time series datasets, we show that MDI is able to integrate a significant number of datasets simultaneously, and that it successfully captures the underlying structural similarity between the datasets. We also analyse a variety of real Saccharomyces cerevisiae datasets. In the two-dataset case, we show that MDIs performance is comparable with the present state-of-the-art. We then move beyond the capabilities of current approaches and integrate gene expression, chromatin immunopreci-pitation–chip and protein–protein interaction data, to identify a set of protein complexes for which genes are co-regulated during the cell cycle. Comparisons to other unsupervised data integration tech-niques—as well as to non-integrative approaches—demonstrate that MDI is competitive, while also providing information that would be difficult or impossible to extract using other methods. Availability: A Matlab implementation of MDI is available from
INTRODUCTIONThe wide range of modern high-throughput genomics technologies has led to a rapid increase in both the quantity and variety of functional genomics data that can be collected. For example, large-scale microarray (), chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) chip () and tandem affinity purification () datasets are available for a broad selection of organisms, providing measurements of mRNA expression, proteinDNA binding and proteinprotein interactions (PPIs). In the forthcoming era of personal genomic medicine, we may reasonably expect genome sequences and other forms of high-throughput data (such as gene expression, alternative splicing, DNA methylation, histone acetylation and protein abundances) to be routinely measured for large numbers of people. The development of novel statistical and computational methodology for integrating diverse data sources is therefore essential, and it is with this that the present work is concerned. As is common in statistics and machine learning, data integration techniques can be broadly categorized as either supervised (where a training/gold-standard set with known labels is used to learn statistical relationships) or unsupervised (where there is no training dataset, but we nevertheless seek to identify hidden structure in the observed data; e.g. by clustering). Our proposed method is unsupervised, but there are also a number of supervised learning algorithms that are designed to integrate multiple data sources; we now briefly mention these for the sake of completeness. These have proven highly successful in several contexts, often when predicting whether a link or interaction exists between two genes or proteins. Depending on the application, the link might represent (to provide just a few examples) protein protein binding (), or a synthetic sick or lethal interaction () or might indicate that the two genes have been implicated in the same biological process (). Approaches for predicting these links often proceed by collecting a gold-standard set of positive and negative interactions (see, for contrasting examples,), and then training statistical models (e.g. decision trees, naive Bayes classifiers) that predict the presence/absence of these interactions. These models may then be applied to predict the presence/absence of previously unknown interactions. Because training and prediction are performed on the basis of information collected from multiple different data sources, these approaches provide a form of data integration. Such supervised data integration techniques have proven highly effective for predicting interactions, some of which may then be verified experimentally (e.g.). Moreover, the work ofdemonstrates that such approaches may be used to integrate whole-genome scale datasets. The Bayesian network approach ofwas a precursor to many of these supervised approaches, but differs from the others in that it uses knowledge *To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Here we propose a novel unsupervised approach for the integrative modelling of multiple datasets, which may be of different types. For brevity, we refer to our approach as MDI, simply as a shorthand for 'Multiple Dataset Integration'. We model each dataset using a Dirichlet-multinomial allocation (DMA) mixture model (Section 2.1), and exploit statistical dependencies between the datasets to share information (Section 2.2). MDI permits the identification of groups of genes that tend to cluster together in one, some or all of the datasets. In this way, our method is able to use the information contained within diverse datasets to identify groups of genes with increasingly specific characteristics (e.g. not only identifying groups of genes that are co-regulated, but additionally identifying groups of genes that are both co-regulated and whose protein products appear in the same complex). Informally, our approach may be considered as a 'correlated clustering' model, in which the allocation of genes to clusters in one dataset has an influence on the allocation of genes to clusters in another. This contrasts with 'simple' clustering approaches (such as k-means, hierarchical clustering, etc) in which the datasets are clustered independently (or else concatenated and treated as a single dataset). It also clearly distinguishes our methodology from biclustering (e.g.). Biclustering is the clustering of both dimensions in a single dataset (e.g. both genes and experiments in a gene expression dataset). MDI, in contrast, clusters a single dimension (e.g. genes) across multiple datasets. Biclustering is not applicable here as the datasets can be arbitrarily different, making any clustering across all features difficult. MDI avoids the problem of comparing different data types by instead learning the degree of similarity between the clustering structures (i.e. the gene-to-cluster allocations) in different datasets (Section 2.2). MDI makes use of mixture models, which have become widespread in the context of unsupervised integrative data modelling (e.g.), gaining increased popularity in recent years (). The principal advantages of using mixture models are as follows:(i) they provide flexible probabilistic models of the data; (ii) they naturally capture the clustering structure that is commonly present in functional genomics datasets; and (iii) by adopting different parametric forms for the mixture components, they permit different data types to be modelled (see also Section 2.1). An early application to data integration is provided by, who performed integrative modelling of gene expression and binding site data. As part of our approach, we infer parameters that describe the levels of agreement between the datasets. Our method may thus be viewed as extending the work of. In this regard, MDI is also related to the approach of, which models the correlation between data sources as part of a method that classifies genes as targets or non-targets of a given transcription factor (TF) using ChIPchip, gene expression and DNA binding data, as well as information regarding the position of genes on a gene network. Perhaps most closely related to MDI (in terms of application) are the methods of) and iCluster ().adopt a mixture modelling approach, using a hierarchical Dirichlet process (DP) to perform integrative modelling of two datasets. As well as significant methodological differences, the principal practical distinction between this approach and MDI is that we are able to integrate more than two datasets, any or all of which may be of different types (Section 2). Like MDI, the iCluster method ofpermits integrative clustering of multiple (! 2) genomic datasets, but uses a joint latent variable model (for details, see). In contrast to MDI, iCluster seeks to find a single common clustering structure for all datasets. Moreover, iCluster must resort to heuristic approaches to estimate the number of clusters, whereas MDI infers this automatically (Section 2.1). We demonstrate that MDI provides results that are competitive with the two-dataset approach of Savage et al.(2010) in Section 3.2, and provide a comparison of results obtained using MDI, iCluster and simple clustering approaches in the Supplementary Material. The potential biological applications of our approach are diverse, as there are many experimental platforms that produce measurements of different types, which might be expected to possess similar (but not necessarily identical) clustering structures. For example, in the two-dataset case, related methodologies have been used to discover transcriptional modules () and prognostic cancer subtypes () through the integration of gene expression data with TF binding (ChIPchip) data and copy number variation data, respectively. A related approach was also used byto investigate the correspondence between transcriptomic and proteomic expression profiles. In the example presented in this article, we focus on the biological question of identifying protein complexes whose genes undergo transcriptional co-regulation during the cell cycle. The outline of this article is as follows. In Section 2, we briefly provide some modelling background and present our approach. Inference in our model is performed via a Gibbs sampler, which is provided in the Supplementary Material. In Section 3, we describe three case study examples, in all of which we use publicly available Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast) datasets. We present results in Section 4 and a discussion in Section 5.
DISCUSSIONWe have presented MDI, a novel Bayesian method for the unsupervised integrative modelling of multiple datasets. We have established that MDI provides competitive results with an existing method for integrating two datasets (Section 4.2), and is also able to integrate collections of more than two datasets (Sections 4.1 and 4.3). Our application to a three-dataset example (Section 4.3) demonstrated that requiring agreement across multiple datasets of different types can enable us to identify clusters of genes with increasingly specific shared characteristics. Moreover, we have found that sharing information across multiple datasets can improve cluster quality. MDI adopts a modelling approach distinctly different from those adopted by existing integrative modelling methods. For example, the model ofperforms integrative modelling of two datasets only, achieved by introducing a 'fused context' (in which the two datasets are modelled together via a product of likelihoods) in addition to two 'unfused contexts' in which the two datasets are modelled separately. This is analogous to introducingand modellingan additional dataset. In contrast, MDI introduces just a single parameter, k' 2 R !0 , for each pair of datasets (Section 2.2), and it is this that provides MDI with the flexibility to perform integrative modelling of multiple datasets. The scalability of MDI may be further improved through parallelization of the type described by. This is an important direction for future work.

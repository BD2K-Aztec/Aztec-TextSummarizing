Sequencing pooled DNA samples (Pool-Seq) is the most cost-effective approach for the genome-wide comparison of population samples. Here, we introduce PoPoolation2, the first software tool specifically designed for the comparison of populations with Pool-Seq data. PoPoolation2 implements a range of commonly used measures of differentiation (F ST , Fishers exact test and Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test) that can be applied on different scales (windows, genes, exons, SNPs). The result may be visualized with the widely used Integrated Genomics Viewer.
INTRODUCTIONNext-generation sequencing of pooled DNA samples (allows the comparison of population samples on a genomic scale, thus facilitating the transition from single marker studies to population genomics. Due to its cost-effectiveness (), Pool-Seq can be used for a range of applications. The most intuitive application is the comparison of natural populations to perform standard population genetic analyses on a genomic scale (e.g.). The comparison of natural Arabidopsis lyrata populations from different habitats allowed the characterization of genes involved in heavy metal tolerance (). Also in experimental evolution studies, Pool-Seq has been used to identify genomic regions that show high differentiation between different selective treatments (). Finally, Pool-Seq offers an enormous potential for selective genotyping (). While several tools for analyzing Pool-Seq data of single populations are already available (), to our knowledge no standalone software * To whom correspondence should be addressed. tool is available for the comparison of Pool-Seq data for multiple populations. PoPoolation2 is a software tool dedicated to the comparison of allele frequencies between populations.

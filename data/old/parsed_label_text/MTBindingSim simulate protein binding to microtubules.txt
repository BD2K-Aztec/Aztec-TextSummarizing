Many protein–protein interactions are more complex than can be accounted for by 1:1 binding models. However, biochemists have few tools available to help them recognize and predict the behaviors of these more complicated systems, making it difficult to design experiments that distinguish between possible binding models. MTBindingSim provides researchers with an environment in which they can rapidly compare different models of binding for a given scenario. It is written specifically with microtubule polymers in mind, but many of its models apply equally well to any polymer or any protein–protein interaction. MTBindingSim can thus both help in training intuition about binding models and with experimental design. Availability and implementation: MTBindingSim is implemented in MATLAB and runs either within MATLAB (on Windows, Mac or Linux) or as a binary without MATLAB (on Windows or Mac).

INTRODUCTIONThe investigation of proteinprotein interactions is a critical issue in biochemistry, and many different models have been proposed to account for the various binding behaviors that have been observed. This wide array of possible models makes it difficult for both students and researchers to predict the binding data expected from these different models. This can make the interpretation of experimental data for an interaction without an established model particularly difficult (e.g.). In addition, it is difficult to design experiments that can conclusively determine which model is best if one does not have a solid understanding of the behaviors expected from the different models. We have written MTBindingSim to assist with these challenges. MTBindingSim provides researchers and students with an environment in which they can easily and rapidly visualize protein protein interactions under a variety of models and experimental designs. While MTBindingSim was written specifically with microtubule (MT) binding proteins in mind, all models except one apply to binding to any polymer, and four of the models can be used in any protein binding system. We are confident that MTBindingSim can therefore be useful for understanding protein binding in a wide variety of contexts, within both research and education. * To whom correspondence should be addressed.
CONCLUSIONWe here introduce a program, MTBindingSim, which provides an environment for the simulation and comparison of protein binding curves. This program is an excellent resource for students learning Page: 443 441443

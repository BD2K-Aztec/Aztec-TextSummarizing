METAL provides a computationally efficient tool for meta-analysis of genome-wide association scans, which is a commonly used approach for improving power complex traits gene mapping studies. METAL provides a rich scripting interface and implements efficient memory management to allow analyses of very large data sets and to support a variety of input file formats. Availability and implementation: METAL, including source code, documentation, examples, and executables, is available at
INTRODUCTIONMeta-analysis is becoming an increasingly important tool in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of complex genetic diseases and traits (). Meta-analysis provides an efficient and practical strategy for detecting variants with modest effect sizes (). We, and others, have used METAL for performing meta-analysis of GWAS to identify loci reproducibly associated with a variety of traits, such as type 2 diabetes (), lipid levels (), BMI (), blood pressure () and fasting glucose levels (). Meta-analysis of genome-wide association summary statistics, in contrast to direct analysis of pooled individual-level data, alleviates common concerns with privacy of study participants and avoids cumbersome integration of genotype and phenotypic data from different studies. Meta-analysis allows for custom analyses of individual studies to conveniently account for population substructure, the presence of related individuals, study-specific covariates and many other ascertainment-related issues. It has been shown that meta-analysis of summary statistics is as efficient (in terms of statistical power) as pooling individual-level data across studies, but much less cumbersome (). Since GWAS routinely examine evidence for association at millions of directly genotyped and imputed SNPs across dozens or even hundreds of individual studies, it is important to use a fast and flexible tool to perform meta-analysis. * To whom correspondence should be addressed.Overall P-value P = 2(|Z|)

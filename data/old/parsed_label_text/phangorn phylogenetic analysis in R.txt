phangorn is a package for phylogenetic reconstruction and analysis in the R language. Previously it was only possible to estimate phylogenetic trees with distance methods in R. phangorn, now offers the possibility of reconstructing phylogenies with distance based methods, maximum parsimony or maximum likelihood (ML) and performing Hadamard conjugation. Extending the general ML framework, this package provides the possibility of estimating mixture and partition models. Furthermore, phangorn offers several functions for comparing trees, phylogenetic models or splits, simulating character data and performing congruence analyses.

INTRODUCTIONWith more than 20 packages devoted to phylogenetics, the R software (R Development Core) has become a standard in phylogenetic analysis (see http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/ Phylogenetics.html for an overview). However so far it was only possible to estimate phylogenetic trees with distance methods in R. The phangorn package permits to estimate maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum parsimony (MP) trees. Besides reconstructing phylogenies, the package also focuses on assessing the congruence of different trees.

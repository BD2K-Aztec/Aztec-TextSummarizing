Motivation: With the advancement of high-throughput techniques, large-scale profiling of biological systems with multiple experimental perturbations is becoming more prevalent. Pathway analysis incorporates prior biological knowledge to analyze genes/proteins in groups in a biological context. However, the hypotheses under investigation are often confined to a 1D space (i.e. up, down, either or mixed regulation). Here, we develop direction pathway analysis (DPA), which can be applied to test hypothesis in a high-dimensional space for identifying pathways that display distinct responses across multiple perturbations. Results: Our DPA approach allows for the identification of pathways that display distinct responses across multiple perturbations. To demonstrate the utility and effectiveness, we evaluated DPA under various simulated scenarios and applied it to study insulin action in adipo-cytes. A major action of insulin in adipocytes is to regulate the movement of proteins from the interior to the cell surface membrane. Quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics was used to study this process on a large-scale. The combined dataset comprises four separate treatments. By applying DPA, we identified that several insulin responsive pathways in the plasma membrane trafficking are only partially dependent on the insulin-regulated kinase Akt. We subsequently validated our findings through targeted analysis of key proteins from these pathways using immunoblotting and live cell microscopy. Our results demonstrate that DPA can be applied to dissect pathway networks testing diverse hypotheses and integrating multiple experimental perturbations.

INTRODUCTIONPathway analysis has become a key approach to incorporate prior knowledge for interpreting '-omics' scaled data generated from high-throughput techniques such as microarray, RNA-seq and quantitative mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics. It has the advantage of leveraging high dimensionality and limited replicates by organizing genes and proteins into groups and analyzing them in biological meaningful contexts (). To date, numerous pathway analysis approaches have been proposed (Emmert) and several taxonomies have been described to categorize them (). One of the popular categorization approaches is to classify pathway analysis methods as using an over-representation approach or aggregate score approach (). The over-representation approach, exemplified by hypergeometric test using Gene Ontology (GO) (), requires a preselected list of differentially expressed (DE) genes to be supplied before the test. It could be sensitive to the cut-off applied to select DE genes (). The aggregate score approach, exemplified by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (), alleviates this requirement by considering statistics associated with all genes for testing pathway differential regulation. There are several recent extensions on pathway analysis. These include the extensions from univariate to multivariate statistics such as the use of Hotelling's T 2-statistics and N-statistics () and from single analysis to meta-analysis such as combining results from multiple studies (), different platforms () and/or multiple methods (). Nevertheless, current pathway analysis methodologies are mainly designed for testing hypotheses in a 1D space and focus on identifying pathways that show up, down, either or mixed differential regulations. Due to the growing complexity of large-scale experiments where multiple treatments are applied, for example, to dissect the signalling networks, a novel pathway analysis approach that can incorporate multiple perturbations into a single statistical analysis is desirable. *To whom correspondence should be addressed y The authors wish it to be known that, in their opinion, the first two authors should be regarded as joint First Authors. The broad term experimental perturbations is used to describe any situation in which a cell has been agitated and its reaction quantified. Practically speaking when referring to multiple experimental perturbations, we may be referring to quantifying the effects of a treatment versus control at various cellular levels (DNA, RNA, protein). We could also consider multiple experimental perturbations to refer to various treatment comparisons at the same cellular level. In this study, we propose direction pathway analysis (DPA) for integrating multiple perturbations in pathway analysis. This method integrates multiple experimental perturbations by coupling coordinate rotation with P-value combination techniques. It extends on traditional pathway analysis in the following aspects:The method increases statistical power by integrating multiple perturbations for testing in a high-dimensional space.The method improves biological interpretability by translating a biological question into a direction-specific test, broadening the hypothesis space and allowing many more biological questions to be investigated. The method is flexible and can be extended to n-dimensions, where n is the number of experimental perturbations. To demonstrate the effectiveness of P-value combination techniques at answering various alternative hypotheses, we designed and performed a set of simulation studies. These studies offer insight into the selection of an appropriate combination technique for DPA in integrating information on testing pathway enrichment. To explore the utility of the method, we applied this approach to MS-based proteomics data obtained from adipocytes aiming to identify insulin action pathways under various treatments. Adipocytes are one of the major targets of insulin action in mammals. One of the major pathways downstream of the insulin receptor is the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway (). To date, the majority of evidence points towards Akt alone being sufficient to elicit the majority of insulin's intracellular actions (). However, there are PI3K-dependent Akt-independent pathways that are activated by insulin stimulation () and it is possible that such pathways may also regulate protein trafficking events in response to insulin. To dissect PI3K-Akt pathways and determine the contributions of Akt-independent and Akt-dependent pathways, we used various pharmacological agents to target different signal transduction nodes and subsequently performed plasma membrane purification and SILAC-based () quantitative proteomic profiling (). By analyzing the proteomic profile using DPA, we identified that several pathways were enriched in the plasma membrane following insulin stimulation, and that these trafficking events were strongly dependent on PI3K signalling. However, the translocation of these pathways was not fully blocked in the presence of an Akt inhibitor, suggesting that there are Akt-independent pathways that promote membrane trafficking events in response to insulin. We validated these findings through targeted analysis of several key proteins from these insulin-regulated pathways using immunoblotting and live cell microscopy.
CONCLUSIONIn this study, we developed DPA for detecting biologically relevant pathways under multiple experimental perturbations. This method tests a hypothesis by rotating the test statistics and combining across both proteins and multiple experimental perturbations using P-value combination. Compared with traditional pathway analysis, DPA allows many more biological questions formulated as an alternative hypothesis and tested directly. We subsequently applied DPA to identify pathways that are significantly enriched at the plasma membrane in response to insulin stimulation and differentially inhibited by different inhibitors with the goal of dissecting insulin-regulated processes and their dependence on PI3K and Akt kinases. By examining a specific alternative hypothesis, we identified several key regulatory pathways to be plasma membrane enriched in a PI3K-dependent and partial Akt-dependent way. We then validated the key proteins in these pathways using immunoblotting and live cell microscopy techniques. Collectively, this study demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed DPA approach to aid the analysis of global datasets generated from experiments consisting of multiple perturbations. In this case, DPA helped identify and dissect the key signalling nodes of insulin regulation in adipocytes.. Microscopy of GLUT4 and TfR.

Data visualization can play a key role in comparative genomics, for example, underpinning the investigation of conserved synteny patterns. Strudel is a desktop application that allows users to easily compare both genetic and physical maps interactively and efficiently. It can handle large datasets from several genomes simultaneously, and allows all-by-all comparisons between these. Availability and implementation: Installers for Strudel are available for Windows, Linux, Solaris and Mac OS X at
INTRODUCTIONCrop genetics is still dominated by species for which fully sequenced and well-annotated genomes are unavailable. Comparative genomics is an important means of annotating unfinished genomes, and requires powerful visualization tools that elucidate the relationships with already annotated genomes. There are a number of tools in this area, which range from webbased applications with database back-ends to standalone desktop applications (). The challenges faced by any comparative visualization application are the increasing volume of data, fast delivery of these to users, efficient on-screen rendering of a large amount of information and layout constraints. Here, we present Strudel, a standalone Java desktop application that aims to combine ease of installation with ease of use, and allows the simultaneous multi-way comparison of several genomes. Usability has been a major design criterion for Strudel, and in early acceptance testing users were able to start generating insights into their data within minutes of downloading the application, without having to first consult the manual. Strudel's graphical interface has been designed to reduce visual clutter as much as possible, and a critical condition for this is that homologies between two chromosomes are never drawn across other genomes. * To whom correspondence should be addressed.

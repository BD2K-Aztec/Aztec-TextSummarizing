Motivation: Data quality is a critical issue in the analyses of DNA copy number alterations obtained from microarrays. It is commonly assumed that copy number alteration data can be modeled as piece-wise constant and the measurement errors of different probes are independent. However, these assumptions do not always hold in practice. In some published datasets, we find that measurement errors are highly correlated between probes that interrogate nearby genomic loci, and the piecewise-constant model does not fit the data well. The correlated errors cause problems in downstream analysis, leading to a large number of DNA segments falsely identified as having copy number gains and losses. Method: We developed a simple tool, called autocorrelation scanning profile, to assess the dependence of measurement error between neighboring probes. Results: Autocorrelation scanning profile can be used to check data quality and refine the analysis of DNA copy number data, which we demonstrate in some typical datasets.
INTRODUCTIONDNA copy number alteration (CNA) is one of the hallmarks of cancer () and has been linked to various complex genetic diseases (). Technological advances in microarrays () and next-generation sequencing () have made it possible to generate large amounts of CNA data (). Various methods developed for CNA data analysis have been compared in published reviews (). These methods differ in their focus, including preprocessing and normalization (), segmentation (), joint analysis of multiple samples (), copy number based on mapped sequence reads (), integrated analysis with genotyping, allelespecific copy number () and others (). However, there are still some challenging issues regarding quality assessment and biological interpretation of CNA data (). A common step of CNA analysis is segmentation, which transforms noisy measurements into genomic segments of equal copy number. This step aims to reduce noise and data dimension. Significant gains/losses of the segments can be subsequently recognized. The ends of the segments may correspond to DNA breakage points. The underlying assumptions in segmentation are (i) the data can be modeled as piecewise constant, and (ii) the measurement errors of different probes are independent. Although in most cases, methods such as circular binary segmentation (CBS;) yield reasonable results, we find that occasionally the piecewise-constant model appears to fit the data poorly and the independence assumption is grossly violated. The independence assumption is critical because it forms the basis for separating true signals from noise. Correlated errors are expected to lead to incorrect identification of aberrant segments. To address the issue, we have developed a method called the autocorrelation scanning profile (ASP). Autocorrelation is the cross-correlation of a signal with itself, which is a mathematical tool for finding repeating patterns in time series data. If the time series data can be modeled as piecewise constant and the noises in the data are independent at different time points, ASP has the following appealing properties: (i) the autocorrelation within each segment of a constant mean is expected to be 0; (ii) at the junction of an abrupt change-point, however, the autocorrelation rises significantly above 0. We observe different patterns when the ASP method is applied to published datasets. Our results show that ASP can be used to check for CNA data quality and refine the analysis.
DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have demonstrated the use of ASP in DNA copy number analysis. The issue of interdependence of probes has been largely ignored in the existing methods. We argue this is an important issue and show that there are elevated ASPs that can be frequently observed in published datasets. Elevated ASPs mean that one cannot assume that the microarray probes measure the copy number data independently. The elevated ASPs inflate the FPs in the identification of aberrant segments because they increase the probability of multiple probes having common biases. From the results of our computer simulations, we found that FPs in segmentation rise rapidly when the median); Case B from sample GSM487724 in GSE19574 (); Case C from sample GSM315235, GEO accession number is GSE12532 (); and Case D is from GSM535545, GEO accession number is GSE21420 (reported a dramatic increase in the absolute number of genetic alterations in all FFPE tissues relative to their matched fresh-frozen counterparts, suggesting that FFPE samples are more prone to produce spurious results of copy number changes. These results are similar to our current study, which showed that FFPE samples tend to have higher median ASPs than fresh-frozen samples (). Our ASP method provides a much needed tool for quality control. Existing tools such as the NanoDrop spectrophotometer aim to ensure that DNA samples to be hybridized onto the arrays are in sufficient quantity and have the appropriate length. There are also metrics commonly used to assess data quality, such as the derivative log-ratio spread (DLRS;) and genotyping call rate on SNP arrays. The DLRS estimates the log-ratio noise by calculating the spread of log-ratio differences between consecutive probes along all chromosomes. The genotyping call rate of a sample is the fraction of probes that have passed the detection filter. The DLRS and genotype call rate are correlated, both reflecting measurement noises on individual probes. ASP is conceptually different, as it measures the correlation of noises between neighboring probes. Hence, we recommend the use of ASP in addition to existing quality measures. It is interesting to note that the ASPs show several distinct patterns (). When only a localized region has a high ASP (), the phenomenon is similar to that reported as chromothripsis () or firestorm (). The CNP pattern seen incontains gradual changes, which poorly fit the piecewise-constant model. The piecewise-constant model is expected to hold under the condition that there is only one tumor clone in the tissue and the number of aberrant segments is less than the number of probe sites. The latter condition usually holds except in the case of chromothripsis. When there is only one tumor clone, the denoised copy number should take integer values after adjusting the scale. The gradual changes that fall between the level of single copy gain or loss (such as in) cannot result from a single tumor clone, andtherefore must come from the contribution of multiple clones. Tumor tissues containing multiple clones are commonly observed, which is recognized as another hallmark of cancer (). Taken together, our results show that ASP provides a useful tool in DNA copy number analysis.

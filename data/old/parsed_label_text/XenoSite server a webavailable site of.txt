Cytochrome P450 enzymes (P450s) are metabolic enzymes that process the majority of FDA-approved, small-molecule drugs. Understanding how these enzymes modify molecule structure is key to the development of safe, effective drugs. XenoSite server is an online implementation of the XenoSite, a recently published computational model for P450 metabolism. XenoSite predicts which atomic sites of a molecule—sites of metabolism (SOMs)—are modified by P450s. XenoSite server accepts input in common chemical file formats including SDF and SMILES and provides tools for visualizing the likelihood that each atomic site is a site of metabolism for a variety of important P450s, as well as a flat file download of SOM predictions. Availability and implementation: XenoSite server is available at
IntroductionCytochrome P450 enzymes (P450s) are a family of heme-thiolated enzymes that catalyze a variety of oxidation reactions. They oxidatively metabolize the majority of FDA-approved, small-molecule drugs (). P450s metabolize individual molecules at specific atoms: sites of metabolism (SOMs). The specific SOMs associated with a molecule's P450 metabolism are important to know because they affect its bioavailability, efficacy and toxicity. For example, acetominophen is metabolized by P450s at a specific site into NAPQI, which is toxic to hepatocytes, which can acute liver failure in some patients. Accurately predicting these SOMs enables medicinal chemists to modify molecule to avoid toxic metabolites and maximize bioavailability. There are in vitro assays capable of determining a molecule's SOMs, but computational methods for predicting SOMs are quicker, less expensive and frequently used in drug development. In addition to commercial software packages for predicting SOMs, there are at least two software packages produced by academic groups, RS predictor and SMARTCyp (). Recently, we reported a new method for predicting P450 SOMs, XenoSite, that is more accurate than other approaches (). This article reports a public web server that makes XenoSite available to predict the SOMs of usersubmitted molecules. XenoSite is a machine-learning approach to modeling P450 metabolism. Using a neural network, XenoSite models are trained on the largest set of publicly available P450 metabolism data consisting of over 680 compounds annotated with SOMs for the P450 isozymes 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4, as well as human liver microsomes (HLM), which combines the individual P450 models to represent the expected metabolism of compounds in vivo. In cross-validation experiments, XenoSite identifies experimentally observed SOMs within the top two rank positions for substrate sets of each P450 isozyme with a high level of accuracy: 87.1%, 85.7%, 83.4%, 88.7%, 86.7%, 89.0%, 88.5%, 83.5%, 87.6% and 89.4%, respectively, on these isozymes ().

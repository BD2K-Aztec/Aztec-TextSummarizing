pileup.js is a new browser-based genome viewer. It is designed to facilitate the investigation of evidence for genomic variants within larger web applications. It takes advantage of recent developments in the JavaScript ecosystem to provide a modular, reliable and easily embedded library.
IntroductionAs sequencing has become increasingly ubiquitous, there has been a proliferation of variant calling programs. Before a physician or researcher takes action on a variant; however, it remains essential to inspect the evidence for it manually. Track viewer visualizations such as those provided by UCSC (University of California Santa Cruz), IGV (Integrative Genomics Viewer) and Dalliance have long been the preferred way to do this (). As data and workflow management systems move to the browser, it becomes increasingly appealing to embed these visualizations directly within larger web applications. This results in reduced latency, allows extensive customization and avoids the cognitive overhead of context switching between applications. Here, we describe pileup.js, a JavaScript library for interactive and in-browser visualization of genomic data. pileup.js is extensively tested, uses a modern code base that is oriented towards re-usability and performance, and is well-documented for easier customization and usability by other developers. The latest version, v0.6.2 (the most recent version), supports visualization of genomic tracks for reference sequences, mapped reads (paired or unpaired), read depth, variants and gene annotations. pileup.js was initially developed to be embedded within the Cycledash variant inspector, but it can be used within any web application.

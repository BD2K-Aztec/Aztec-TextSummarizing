Motivation: High-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies are transforming the study of genomic variation. The various HTS technologies have different sequencing biases and error rates, and while most HTS technologies sequence the residues of the genome directly, generating base calls for each position, the Applied Biosystems SOLiD platform generates dibase-coded (color space) sequences. While combining data from the various platforms should increase the accuracy of variation detection, to date there are only a few tools that can identify variants from color space data, and none that can analyze color space and regular (letter space) data together. Results: We present VARiDâ€”a probabilistic method for variation detection from both letter-and color-space reads simultaneously. VARiD is based on a hidden Markov model and uses the forward-backward algorithm to accurately identify heterozygous, homozygous and tri-allelic SNPs, as well as micro-indels. Our analysis shows that VARiD performs better than the AB SOLiD toolset at detecting variants from color-space data alone, and improves the calls dramatically when letter-and color-space reads are combined. Availability: The toolset is freely available at
INTRODUCTIONHigh-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies are revolutionizing the way biologists acquire and analyze genomic data. HTS machines, such as 454/Roche, Illumina/Solexa and AB SOLiD are able to sequence up to a full human genome per week, at a cost hundreds fold less than previous methods. The resulting data consists of reads ranging in length between 35 and 400 nt, from unknown locations in the genome. Analysis of these datasets poses an unprecedented informatics challenge due to the sheer number of reads that a single run of an HTS machine can produce, the shortness of the reads, and the various technologies' different sequencing biases and error rates. The two basic steps in the discovery of variants in the human population from reads coming from any of these technologies are: first, the mapping of reads to a finished (reference) genome, and second the identification of variation by analysis of these mappings. In the last few years, there have been many approaches proposed for mapping reads from HTS technologies (among many others; see * To whom correspondence should be addressed.(b) show the correspondence between di-nucleotides and their color space representation with a translation matrix and the corresponding Finite State Automaton. In part (c), we show the effect of SNPs on the color-space representation of the read, as well as effect of sequencing errors on the trivial translation of the read from color to letter space. The first letter shown in the reads is actually the last letter of the linker, which helps us 'lock-in' on one of the four possible translations of a color-space read.for reviews) that utilize a wide variety of approaches. Compared to this multitude of mapping tools, there have only been a handful of toolsets for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and small (15 bp) indel discovery. The main challenge in detecting these variants is using the error rates of the sequencing platform, the potentially incorrect mappings, and the varying coverage to determine the likelihood that a position represents a heterozygous or homozygous variant with respect to some reference genome. We use the term heterozygous to refer to the case when a single donor allele differs from the reference, and homozygous to refer to the case when both donor alleles differ from the reference, and are the same as each other.

DISCUSSIONThe various HTS technologies that have emerged in the past few years have different data representations, advantages, biases and features. In this work, we introduced a novel probabilistic framework for variation identification, which can use both letter-and colorspace data simultaneously. We have shown in our results that when using only color-space dataa data type for which very few genomic analysis tools existthe model outperforms the AB SOLiD toolkit Corona Lite, and performs on par with gigaBayes predictions for letter-space data alone. More importantly, when the color-and letter-space data are combined, the VARiD framework allows for a significant performance increase, demonstrating that a method that can take into consideration multiple technologies, combining their different advantages and compensating for their different weaknesses can achieve higher accuracy variant predictions than are possible from any single data type.

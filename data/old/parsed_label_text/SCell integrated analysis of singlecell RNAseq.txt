Analysis of the composition of heterogeneous tissue has been greatly enabled by recent developments in single-cell transcriptomics. We present SCell, an integrated software tool for quality filtering, normalization, feature selection, iterative dimensionality reduction, clustering and the estimation of gene-expression gradients from large ensembles of single-cell RNA-seq datasets. SCell is open source, and implemented with an intuitive graphical interface. Scripts and protocols for the high-throughput pre-processing of large ensembles of single-cell, RNA-seq datasets are provided as an additional resource. Availability and Implementation: Binary executables for Windows, MacOS and Linux are available at
IntroductionSingle-cell sequencing enables heterogeneity assessments at unprecedented resolution. At a cost comparable to sequencing a sample in bulk, hundreds of single-cell datasets can instead be generated. We present SCell, a software tool to perform outlier filtering, to normalize cell-cycle effects, to select genes for dimensionality reduction and to estimate inter-sample expression gradients. Several groups have proposed reconstructing the gene-expression kinetics of developmental processes from transcriptomics data, by summarizing gene expression along the backbone of a spanning graph of the samples' PCA coordinates (). As single-cell sequencing becomes more widely adopted, the large number of available samples makes direct regression of gene expression on PCA coordinates an attractive alternative. SCell can regress/interpolate gene expression on PCA space, visualize expression gradients, and estimate expression kinetics along minimum spanning trees and minimum weight paths. These tools are accessible through an interactive, graphical interface.

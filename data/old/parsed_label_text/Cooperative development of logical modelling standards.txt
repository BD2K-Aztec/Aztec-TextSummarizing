The identification of large regulatory and signalling networks involved in the control of crucial cellular processes calls for proper modelling approaches. Indeed, models can help elucidate properties of these networks, understand their behaviour and provide (testable) predictions by performing in silico experiments. In this context, qualitative, logical frameworks have emerged as relevant approaches, as demonstrated by a growing number of published models, along with new methodologies and software tools. This productive activity now requires a concerted effort to ensure model reusability and interoperability between tools. Following an outline of the logical modelling framework, we present the most important achievements of the Consortium for Logical Models and Tools, along with future objectives. Our aim is to advertise this open community, which welcomes contributions from all researchers interested in logical modelling or in related mathematical and computational developments.

Mathematical models have become invaluable tools for understanding the dynamical behaviour of such systems. There are various types of formalisms, which differ in the level of detail and model complexity (de Jong, 2002; Karlebach and Shamir, 2008). Logical (or logic), discrete models comprise the most abstract dynamic models and constitute nowadays a popular modelling framework (for reviews see Bornholdt, 2005; Saadatpour and Albert, 2013; Samaga and Klamt, 2013). In logical models, components are represented by discrete variables with a small range of possible values , with the most extreme case being Boolean models, where each component can be either active or inactive (Kauffman, 1969;

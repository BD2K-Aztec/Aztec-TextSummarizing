We developed PSAR-Align, a multiple sequence realignment tool that can refine a given multiple sequence alignment based on suboptimal alignments generated by probabilistic sampling. Our evaluation demonstrated that PSAR-Align is able to improve the results from various multiple sequence alignment tools. Availability and implementation: The PSAR-Align source code (implemented mainly in Cþþ) is freely available for download at
INTRODUCTIONMultiple sequence alignment (MSA) is one of the most important foundations for cross-species comparative genomic analysis (). Although many algorithms for MSA have been developed (), MSA is still error-prone. For example, it was estimated that at least 10% of the human-mouse wholegenome alignment is misaligned at the UCSC Genome Browser and the number increases for other species (). We previously developed a novel measure, called PSAR (), which can assess the reliability of an MSA based on its agreement with probabilistically sampled suboptimal alignments (SAs). SAs provide additional information that cannot be obtained by the optimal alignment alone, especially when the optimal alignment is not far superior to the SAs. In this article, we introduce a new realignment method, PSARAlign, which refines a given MSA based on a probabilistic framework that takes advantage of the SAs of the given MSA. Briefly, PSAR-Align (i) samples SAs from the given MSA, (ii) estimates posterior probabilities of aligning two residues from two different sequences and (iii) generates a revised MSA using an expected accuracy-based alignment algorithm ().

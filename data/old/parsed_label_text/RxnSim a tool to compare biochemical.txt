Quantitative assessment of chemical reaction similarity aids database searches, classification of reactions and identification of candidate enzymes. Most methods evaluate reaction similarity based on chemical transformation patterns. We describe a tool, RxnSim, which computes reaction similarity based on the molecular signatures of participating molecules. The tool is able to compare reactions based on similarities of substrates and products in addition to their transformation. It allows masking of user-defined chemical moieties for weighted similarity computations. Availability and implementation: RxnSim is implemented in R and is freely available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network, CRAN (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RxnSim/).
IntroductionReaction similarity is used to classify biochemical reactions (), assess enzyme similarity (O'), plan molecular syntheses (), search reaction databases () and annotate new function to enzymes (). These methods were developed analogous to molecular similarity () wherein presence of key molecular signatures is encoded as bits in a feature vector and compared to compute similarity. For reaction similarity, signatures of transformation pattern are encoded into a reaction fingerprint (or feature vector) and used to compute similarity (; ChemAxon Docs; Daylight Theory Manual). Present approaches evaluate reaction similarity by comparing transformation patterns. Comparison with respect to substrates requires additional assessment. RxnSim evaluates reaction similarity by comparing molecular signatures of individual molecules involved in the reactions. Molecular signatures implicitly encode transformation patterns. Accuracy of such approaches is limited by presence of large chemical moieties, such as ATP (). To overcome this, RxnSim provides methods to mask user-defined moieties for weighted similarity computations.

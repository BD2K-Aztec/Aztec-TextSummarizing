Rule-based models are analyzed with specialized simulators, such as those provided by the BioNetGen and NFsim open-source software packages. Here, we present BioNetFit, a general-purpose fitting tool that is compatible with BioNetGen and NFsim. BioNetFit is designed to take advantage of distributed computing resources. This feature facilitates fitting (i.e. optimization of parameter values for consistency with data) when simulations are computationally expensive. Availability and implementation: BioNetFit can be used on stand-alone Mac, Windows/Cygwin, and Linux platforms and on Linux-based clusters running SLURM, Torque/PBS, or SGE. The BioNetFit source code (Perl) is freely available (http://bionetfit.nau.edu).
IntroductionBiomolecular interactions can be represented by formalized rules (). Collections of rules form rule-based models, which provide concise representations of biomolecular interaction networks and can be analyzed to obtain insights into how system-level behavior emerges from biomolecular interactions (). Rule-based models must be analyzed with specialized algorithms and software tools (), such as BioNetGen (), which interprets models encoded in the BioNetGen language (BNGL) and provides deterministic, stochastic and hybrid forward simulation capabilities (). To date, other critical methods of analysis, such as fitting (parameter estimation), have typically been applied ad hoc (e.g. by writing problem-specific programs), as in the study ofor, which leads to duplication of effort and hinders the ability to reproduce results. Although many algorithms and software implementations are available for analysis of models specified in traditional forms (), such as that of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), standard techniques are not easily applied to rule-based models except for those rule-based models that can be recast into a traditional model form. Translating a set of rules into a reaction network (i.e. a list of reactions) or the corresponding ODEs for the mass-action kinetics of the network, a capability provided by BioNetGen, is expensive and sometimes impracticable. In such cases, direct simulation methods), which is compatible with BNGL-specified models, expand the range of biomolecular interaction networks that can be studied, because the cost of network-free simulation scales with the number of rules in a model, not the number of reactions implied by the rules (). Software that provides a general-purpose fitting capability and that interfaces with a network-free simulator has not hitherto been available. Here, we present BioNetFit, a general-purpose fitting program for rule-based models that is compatible with BioNetGen and NFsim. Because of the potentially high cost of network-free simulation (), BioNetFit has been designed to be used on clusters. It can also be used on stand-alone computers. BioNetFit implements a genetic algorithm (). Below, we provide an overview of BioNetFit and a demonstration of its capabilities.

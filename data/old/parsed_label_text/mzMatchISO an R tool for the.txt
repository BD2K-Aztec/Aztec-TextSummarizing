Motivation: Stable isotope-labelling experiments have recently gained increasing popularity in metabolomics studies, providing unique insights into the dynamics of metabolic fluxes, beyond the steady-state information gathered by routine mass spectrometry. However, most liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry data analysis software lacks features that enable automated annotation and relative quantification of labelled metabolite peaks. Here, we describe mzMatch–ISO, a new extension to the metabolomics analysis pipeline mzMatch.R. Results: Targeted and untargeted isotope profiling using mzMatch– ISO provides a convenient visual summary of the quality and quantity of labelling for every metabolite through four types of diagnostic plots that show (i) the chromatograms of the isotope peaks of each compound in each sample group; (ii) the ratio of mono-isotopic and labelled peaks indicating the fraction of labelling; (iii) the average peak area of mono-isotopic and labelled peaks in each sample group; and (iv) the trend in the relative amount of labelling in a predetermined isotopomer. To aid further statistical analyses, the values used for generating these plots are also provided as a tab-delimited file. We demonstrate the power and versatility of mzMatch–ISO by analysing a 13 C-labelled metabolome dataset from trypanosomal parasites. Availability: mzMatch.R and mzMatch–ISO are available free of charge from http://mzmatch.sourceforge.net and can be used on Linux and Windows platforms running the latest version of R.

INTRODUCTIONisotope-labelled LCMS data to generate plots and tables that describe the labelling pattern in detail. The ability to generate a comprehensive graphical visualization of the output along with the extensible and scriptable nature of the software itself makes mzMatchISO a unique data analysis tool for isotope-labelling studies. mzMatchISO is an extension to mzMatch, an open-source Java toolbox for MS data processing and visualization (). Features of mzMatchenabled by the R package mzMatch.Rincluding the new PeakML data exchange format and the data analysis pipeline were described by. mzMatch has been applied to many metabolomics data analyses () and is the underlying platform for software such as IDEOM (). Currently, only LCMS data analysis is supported by mzMatchISO; however, it is possible to process gas chromatographymass spectrometry data analyses using mzmatch.R and mzmatchISO with some additional scripting.

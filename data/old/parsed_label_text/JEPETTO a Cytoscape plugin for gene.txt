JEPETTO (Java Enrichment of Pathways Extended To TOpology) is a Cytoscape 3.x plugin performing integrative human gene set analysis. It identifies functional associations between genes and known cellular pathways, and processes using protein interaction networks and topological analysis. The plugin integrates information from three separate web servers we published previously, specializing in enrichment analysis, pathways expansion and topological matching. This integration substantially simplifies the analysis of user gene sets and the interpretation of the results. We demonstrate the utility of the JEPETTO plugin on a set of misregulated genes associated with Alzheimers disease. Availability: Source code and binaries are freely available for down-load at http://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/jepetto, implemented in Java and multi-platform. Installable directly via Cytoscape plugin manager. Released under the GNU General Public Licence.
INTRODUCTIONThe integration of heterogeneous data derived from functional genomics experiments is an essential step in providing insights into biological systems behaviour, especially disease-related processes. Nowadays this integration is becoming easier, thanks to extendable network analysis platforms such as Cytoscape (). Although several existing Cytoscape plugins do functional analysis, not many go beyond performing a 'term-based' search or link ontology. In contrast, JEPETTO integrates gene sets with pathways and the molecular interaction networks they are embedded in. It uses information from three different web servers to perform network enrichment, pathways expansion and topological analysis.

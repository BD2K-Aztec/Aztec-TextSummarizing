Methyl-Analyzer is a python package that analyzes genome-wide DNA methylation data produced by the Methyl-MAPS (methylation mapping analysis by paired-end sequencing) method. Methyl-MAPS is an enzymatic-based method that uses both methylation-sensitive and-dependent enzymes covering 80% of CpG dinucleotides within mammalian genomes. It combines enzymatic-based approaches with high-throughput next-generation sequencing technology to provide whole genome DNA methylation profiles. Methyl-Analyzer processes and integrates sequencing reads from methylated and unmethylated compartments and estimates CpG methylation probabilities at single base resolution. Availability and implementation: Methyl-Analyzer is available at
INTRODUCTIONDNA methylation plays a critical role in gene silencing and chromatin remodeling (). DNA methylation is also involved in the transcriptional repression of retrotransposons, genomic imprinting and X-chromosome inactivation in females. In mammals, 5-methylcytosine occurs predominately in CpG dinucleotides. In recent years, a variety of methods, including DNA bisulfite conversion, enzymatic digestion and methylated DNA enrichment, have adapted high-throughput second-generation sequencing to delineate DNA methylation profiles. This presents a bioinformatics challenge in accounting for experimental biases in genome-wide DNA methylation approaches [for a comprehensive review see. Essentially, the concern is the impact of these biases on estimation of CpG methylation probabilities, which is highly dependent on the experimental assay used for DNA methylation profiling (noted above). Methyl-Analyzer was developed to analyze data from the Methyl-MAPS assay (). Methyl-MAPS utilizes both methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes (RE:YES

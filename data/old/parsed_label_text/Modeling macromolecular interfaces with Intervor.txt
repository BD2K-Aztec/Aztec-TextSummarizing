Intervor is a software computing a parameter-free representation of macro–molecular interfaces, based on the α-complex of the atoms. Given two interacting partners, possibly with water molecules squeezed in-between them, Intervor computes an interface model which has the following characteristics: (i) it identifies the atoms of the partners which are in direct contact and those whose interaction is water mediated, (ii) it defines a geometric complex separating the partners, the Voronoi interface, whose geometric and topological descriptions are straightforward (surface area, number of patches, curvature), (iii) it allows the definition of the depth of atoms at the interface, thus going beyond the traditional dissection of an interface into a core and a rim. These features can be used to investigate correlations between structural parameters and key properties such as the conservation of residues, their polarity, the water dynamics at the interface, mutagenesis data, etc. Availability: Intervor can be run from the web site
INTRODUCTIONProteinprotein recognition plays a key role in the formation of complexes which account for biological functions (). The investigation of interfaces of macromolecular complexes is therefore central to improve our understanding of the stability and specificity of macromolecular interactions. In conducting such investigations, one wishes to (i) improve the description of experimentally resolved complexes and (ii) improve scoring functions used to discriminate native structures among putative ones. The goal of this note is to present an interface model which has been used to refine most of the parameters involved so far in interface studies (), using a unique parameter-free geometric construction.

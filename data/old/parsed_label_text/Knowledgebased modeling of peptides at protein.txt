Motivation: Proteinâ€“protein interactions (PPIs) underpin virtually all cellular processes both in health and disease. Modulating the interaction between proteins by means of small (chemical) agents is therefore a promising route for future novel therapeutic interventions. In this context, peptides are gaining momentum as emerging agents for the modulation of PPIs. Results: We reported a novel computational, structure and knowledge-based approach to model orthosteric peptides to target PPIs: PiPreD. PiPreD relies on a precompiled and bespoken library of structural motifs, iMotifs, extracted from protein complexes and a fast structural modeling algorithm driven by the location of native chemical groups on the interface of the protein target named anchor residues. PiPreD comprehensive and systematically samples the entire interface deriving peptide conformations best suited for the given region on the protein interface. PiPreD complements the existing technologies and provides new solutions for the disruption of selected interactions.

IntroductionProteinprotein interactions (PPIs) are essential in the shaping of normal and pathological behaviors in cells. A new frontier in drug discovery is, therefore, the development of new therapeutic agents to modulate PPIs (). Although originally considered undruggable, PPIs are arising as promising therapeutic targets as reviewed in Wells and McClendon (2007) and they are attracting considerable attention from biotechnological companies as the 'unmined gold reserve' in drug discovery (). One part of the problem is that proteins usually interact through large and flat surfaces that lack defining physicochemical traits that can be exploited to attain the required affinities. It is becoming clearer that chemistry originating from traditional drug discovery programs is perhaps not the most suited for targeting PPIs (), and thus new chemotypes should be sought. It is in this context, and thanks to biotechnology advances that have improved its pharmacokinetic properties (), that peptides are gaining momentum as emerging agents for the modulation of PPIs (). Besides, peptide-mediated interactions are common in Biology, accounting for up to 40% of the interactions that take place inside the cell (). They are also central to number of essential cellular processes such as signal transduction, protein assembly, protein localization and regulation () and thus are the more natural candidates for the inhibition of PPIs (). Moreover, peptides do not preclude traditional chemistry as they can be used as precursors to derive chemical compounds, i.e. peptidomimetics (e.g. p53-MDM2 () and Bak BH3/ Bcl-xL ().) Computational tools can be used to model the structure of peptides targeting protein interfaces. Such approaches include peptide), linking (), property-guided searches (), optimization () and docking (). While useful, these technologies present a number of limitations: (i) the search is usually restricted to a small region of the interface given the time that will be required to fully explore the entire interface; (ii) the structure of peptides tend to be biased toward linear and extended conformations as its maximized the contacts with the target surface, however, peptides can adopt different conformations including a-helix (); (iii) do not explicitly exploit the natural repertoire of peptide sequences, which has been proved to increase the chance to identify bioactive peptides (); (iv) some methods require the sequence of the peptides, and thus neglecting the discovery of novel sequences; and (v) other methods are based on the optimization of main-chain stretches isolated from its cognate partner(s), and thus cannot be used to explore novel conformations. Here, we present PiPreD, a novel, structure-and knowledgebased approach to model the conformation of peptides targeting protein interfaces. PiPreD relies on a bespoken library of structural motifs derived from interfaces named iMotifs and it uses native structural elements of the interface being targeted (targetinterface), so-called disembodied anchor residues. The search and sampling of peptides covers the entire interface, i.e. a systematic and comprehensive exploration without biases caused by specific location(s) of the target interface or by the conformation of peptides. PiPreD is therefore a good complement to existing methodologies.
ConclusionIn this work, we present a novel, knowledge-based computational method to model and design orthosteric peptides: PiPreD. PiPreD relies on the structural information of the protein complexes and on a bespoken library of structural motifs: iMotifsDB. The residues that mediate the interaction of cognate partner(s) and target protein, i.e. anchor residues, are used to drive a comprehensive and systematic sampling and modelling of peptides derived from iMotifs. PiPreD can be applied to any protein complex for which the threedimensional structure is known and thus open a new avenue to exploit the repository of protein complexes present in structural databases. Additionally, the technology can be easily adapted to), RAS-P120 (), RAS-RAL () and RAS-scFV (). Bottom row, surface representation of RAS (gray) and Switch-I-II depicted in red.

Finally, this new approach could be used in conjunction with high-throughput peptide synthesis techniques such as peptide microarrays to generate a pool of sequences that are biased toward the targeted surface, i.e. a directed search as opposed to a random peptide screening.

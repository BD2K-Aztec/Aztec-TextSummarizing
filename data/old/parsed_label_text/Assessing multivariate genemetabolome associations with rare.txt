Motivation: A typical genome-wide association study searches for associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and a univariate phenotype. However, there is a growing interest to investigate associations between genomics data and multivariate phenotypes , for example, in gene expression or metabolomics studies. A common approach is to perform a univariate test between each geno-typeâ€“phenotype pair, and then to apply a stringent significance cutoff to account for the large number of tests performed. However, this approach has limited ability to uncover dependencies involving multiple variables. Another trend in the current genetics is the investigation of the impact of rare variants on the phenotype, where the standard methods often fail owing to lack of power when the minor allele is present in only a limited number of individuals. Results: We propose a new statistical approach based on Bayesian reduced rank regression to assess the impact of multiple SNPs on a high-dimensional phenotype. Because of the methods ability to combine information over multiple SNPs and phenotypes, it is particularly suitable for detecting associations involving rare variants. We demonstrate the potential of our method and compare it with alternatives using the Northern Finland Birth Cohort with 4702 individuals, for whom genome-wide SNP data along with lipoprotein profiles comprising 74 traits are available. We discovered two genes (XRCC4 and
INTRODUCTIONConcentrations of human metabolites are associated with risk of many common diseases; for example, low-and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL and HDL) levels are associated with coronary artery disease. For this reason, human metabolism has been under intensive investigation and over the past few years several genome-wide association studies have successfully uncovered a part of its genetic basis (*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

More recent studies used finer subclassifications of metabolites and discovered dozens of novel loci (). Despite these advances, the variance explained by all reported single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) falls far below the suggested heritability of the common metabolites, as estimated either from twin studies () or from more distantly related individuals (). This motivates us to develop new approaches for association testing that could better use all information available to us. The present-day cohort studies often come with a rich set of phenotypic features. Examples in addition to metabolomics () include studies of gene expression () and 3D-facial imaging (). As a consequence, we need statistical methods that increase the power to uncover genotypephenotype dependencies by combining information over several related phenotypes (). The underlying idea is that if a genetic variant affects a trait, then it is likely to affect other traits that are related to the first one and, by testing for association with the two traits jointly, power may be increased. This reasoning can be taken a step further by testing all traits in high-dimensional omics data simultaneously, for example, all metabolites in comprehensive metabolomic profiles. A comparison of different statistical methods available for joint testing of complete metabolomics profiles was recently conducted (). Besides testing several phenotypes simultaneously, the ability to detect certain kinds of associations may be boosted by combining statistical evidence over several SNPs. Usually this is done in a supervised manner, such that SNPs related by location or function, for example, are tested simultaneously. Combining information over multiple SNPs is particularly crucial with rare variants, i.e. SNPs where the minor allele is present in a small proportion of the population. Testing such SNPs individually is unlikely to yield significant findings because of limited power. Most approaches for handling rare variants are based on collapsing several rare SNPs into a single variable (). For example, one can simply collapse several rare variants into a single indicator, telling whether any of the rare variants is present in the individual () or to count the number of rare variants present in the individual (). The problem with the collapsing methods is the implicit assumption that the effects are in the same (or a predefined) direction. A more sophisticated variance component method avoiding this assumption is able to investigate the impact of several rare variants on a univariate trait (). Even if there exists a large number of methods for analyzing rare variants, none of those has been tailored for multivariate phenotypes. On the other hand, standard methods for multivariate phenotypes () have not been thoroughly investigated in the context of rare variants, and we will see later in the text that severe overfitting may occur. In summary, methods for dealing with rare variants in the context of multivariate phenotypes are clearly lacking. In this article, we derive a novel formulation of the Bayesian reduced rank regression model () to detect multivariate associations between predefined groups of SNPs and a high-dimensional phenotype. In particular, our approach is suitable for analyzing both common and rare variants. Our formulation incorporates prior knowledge about effect sizes to increase the power to detect associations. Furthermore, it is capable of correcting for the number of SNPs considered, which is important when testing a large number of SNP groups of different sizes. We validate our method by assessing associations between SNPs in all human genes, one gene at a time, and metabolic profiles comprising fine-scale lipoprotein measurements for 4702 individuals from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 (). Among the top-scoring genes without known associations to the traits studied, two genes (XRCC4 and MTHFD2L) replicated in a combined analysis of 2390 individuals from the Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns study (YFS;) and 3659 individuals from the FINRISK study (). Additional analyses of the same data confirmed that alternative methods discovered only one of these associations and did not identify any further associations that were not known before.
DISCUSSIONWe have presented a new statistical method for investigating associations in Genome-wide association study (GWAS) datasets with multivariate phenotypes. The method can combine information over multiple SNPs, making it particularly suitable for studying rare variants in the high-dimensional phenotype setting. For this setup, no methods known to the authors have beenNote: The table shows the numbers of gene-metabolome associations that had false discovery rate below the specified threshold.

Our method is based on estimating the proportion of total variance of the phenotypes that is explained by the SNPs under consideration. For this purpose, we have derived a Bayesian formulation of the reduced rank regression model, which enables us to incorporate our knowledge of the expected effects sizes in the analysis. We used the new method to analyze a real GWAS dataset with a multivariate lipoprotein phenotype. Two novel loci not previously associated with the phenotype were discovered and replicated in an analysis combining two additional datasets. Furthermore, two more loci were found that replicated significantly in one but not in the other test dataset. Possible reasons for the lack of success in replicating the findings in both the datasets include the following: (i) the associations were false positive in the first place, (ii) the associations involved rare variants that were not present in sufficient numbers to see the effects, (iii) the imputation accuracy of the rare variants was not sufficient in all datasets, (iv) the phenotype data, although preprocessed in exactly the same way with all the datasets, have not been fully equivalent. For example, the scaling of the phenotypes during preprocessing has been done using factors not exactly equal, and the parameters learned in one data may thus not represent the effects adequately in another data. Only further studies will help to distinguish between the alternative explanations. For doing inference with the model, the current implementation uses MCMC sampling, the computation time of which is approximately half an hour per gene on a 2.3 GHz processor. Thus, analyzing all human genes requires a cluster computer to parallelize the computations over the genes. Analytical approximations, such as the variational or Laplace approximations, e.g., could be used to speed up the computations and, based on our experiments with the current method, are worth doing in the future. Alternative ways to use the model might also be considered. For example, focusing the analysis on variants with a predicted function could improve power to detect associations and lessen the computational burden. As another example, we have used 0.01 as the threshold for defining the rare variants when computing their impact on the phenotypes. Results based on different thresholds could readily be extracted from the output of a single MCMC run and are likely to highlight different sets of genes.

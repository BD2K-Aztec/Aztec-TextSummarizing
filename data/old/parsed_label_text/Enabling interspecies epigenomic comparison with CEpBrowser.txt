We developed the Comparative Epigenome Browser (CEpBrowser) to allow the public to perform multi-species epigenomic analysis. The web-based CEpBrowser integrates, manages and visualizes sequencing-based epigenomic datasets. Five key features were developed to maximize the efficiency of interspecies epigenomic comparisons. Availability: CEpBrowser is a web application implemented with PHP, MySQL, C and Apache. URL: http://www.cepbrowser.org/.
INTRODUCTIONEpigenomes play pivotal roles in cell identity, organismal development and disease processes (), contribute to regulating cognition and behavior () and reflect personal variation (). By integrating environmental signals with genomic instructions, epigenomes are instrumental in bridging genotypic variation and phenotypic diversity. Leveraging a number of high-throughput sequencing enabled technologies, large international consortia are aiming to generate 41000 epigenomes from normal tissues and associated disease conditions (). Analyzing and interpreting epigenomic information has become a pressing need. The successes obtained in associating epigenomic marks with genomic features inspired initial efforts of systematic annotation of chromatin states (). However, our current capability of interpreting epigenomic information is still primitive. The concept of using cross-species comparison to annotate epigenomic functions may revolutionize epigenomic analysis (). Indeed, by exploiting the link between evolutionary selection and regulatory functions, 'comparative epigenomics' have annotated epigenomes with unprecedented details (). We have developed the Comparative Epigenome Browser (CEpBrowser) to allow the public to perform multi-species epigenomic analysis. The web-based CEpBrowser extends the concepts of the UCSC and Ensembl Genome Browsers () to integrate, manage and visualize large sequencing-based datasets for cross-species comparisons.

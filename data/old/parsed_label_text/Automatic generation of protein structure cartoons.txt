Protein topology diagrams are 2D representations of protein structure that are particularly useful in understanding and analysing complex protein folds. Generating such diagrams presents a major problem in graph drawing, with automatic approaches often resulting in errors or uninterpretable results. Here we apply a breakthrough in diagram layout to protein topology cartoons, providing clear, accurate, interactive and editable diagrams, which are also an interface to a structural search method.

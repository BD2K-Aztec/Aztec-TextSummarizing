We present bammds, a practical tool that allows visualiza-tion of samples sequenced by second-generation sequencing when compared with a reference panel of individuals (usually genotypes) using a multidimensional scaling algorithm. Our tool is aimed at determining the ancestry of unknown samples—typical of ancient DNA data—particularly when only low amounts of data are available for those samples. Availability and implementation: The software package is available under GNU General Public License v3 and is freely available together with test datasets https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/bammds/. It is using R (http://www.r-project.org/), parallel (http://www.gnu.org/-software/parallel/), samtools (https://
INTRODUCTIONPopulation structure plays an important role in determining the evolutionary history of a group. A great deal has been learned from single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array technology providing unmatched information of the population structure of several species [for humans, see (. The advent of new sequencing platforms, which can deliver millions to billions of sequencing reads within days, has shifted the focus from SNP array data to whole-genome shotgun (WGS) data. While the cost has steadily decreased (), obtaining many high-depth genomes remains prohibitive for many laboratories, in particular when working with ancient DNA (aDNA) samples where it is often desirable to screen many samples of potential interest while keeping the cost at a minimum. Methods based on non-parametric multidimensional statistics (more specifically principal components analysis, PCA) were first applied to genetic data more than 30 years ago (). PCA has since become a standard tool in population genetics () owing in particular to (i) the low computational demand of such analyses, (ii) the appealing graphical result and (iii) its ease of use. Here, we describe a tool that allows to assign an ancestry to low-depth mapped WGS data when compared with an existing reference panel of genotype data using multidimensional scaling (MDS) based on genetic distances, a related method that provides results similar to those of PCA ().
CONCLUSIONThe tool we present in this article is based on classical MDS, a technique that originated in the 1930s and is commonly used in other fields [see, e.g. () and citations therein]. We present a tool that was designed to be practical to assess the ancestry of mapped WGS data for samples sequenced at low depth, assuming that a relevant reference panel in terms of ancestry is provided. We show through simulations that useful ancestry information can be recovered for as few as 30 000 readscorresponding to a fraction ($1/60 in early 2014) of a HiSeq 2000 lane (www.illumina.com) for a sample with 1% endogenous content (or $1/4800 of a lane for a typical modern sample).

Motivation: Automated annotation of neuroanatomical connectivity statements from the neuroscience literature would enable accessible and large-scale connectivity resources. Unfortunately, the connectivity findings are not formally encoded and occur as natural language text. This hinders aggregation, indexing, searching and integration of the reports. We annotated a set of 1377 abstracts for connectivity relations to facilitate automated extraction of connectivity relationships from neuroscience literature. We tested several baseline measures based on co-occurrence and lexical rules. We compare results from seven machine learning methods adapted from the protein interaction extraction domain that employ part-of-speech, dependency and syntax features. Results: Co-occurrence based methods provided high recall with weak precision. The shallow linguistic kernel recalled 70.1% of the sentence-level connectivity statements at 50.3% precision. Owing to its speed and simplicity, we applied the shallow linguistic kernel to a large set of new abstracts. To evaluate the results, we compared 2688 extracted connections with the Brain Architecture Management System (an existing database of rat connectivity). The extracted connections were connected in the Brain Architecture Management System at a rate of 63.5%, compared with 51.1% for co-occurring brain region pairs. We found that precision increases with the recency and frequency of the extracted relationships.

INTRODUCTIONThe brain is a vast interconnected network. Each neuron communicates with many others through chemical and electrical synapses to integrate information. Groups of neurons (in structures such as nuclei or layers) make diverse connections across the brain, forming pathways of information flow. This structural connectivity is a major determinant of brain function and is frequently used by neuroscientists and clinicians to interpret physiological data. Examples include understanding strokes () and interpreting brain imaging results. Evidence for connectivity abnormalities has been found in bipolar (), autism (), Alzheimer's () and schizophrenia patients (). A major goal of modern neuroscience is to understand the organization of the brain at all levels in as much detail as possible, and to understand how this networked organization relates to brain function and ultimately behaviour and human health (). The characterization of the connectivity network or wiring diagram of the brain is incomplete (). In part this is due to the complexity of the brain and the difficulty in collecting data. However, we suggest that informatics technologies can be used to leverage existing knowledge that has already been collected to make new discoveries and guide further experimentation. In this work, we are primarily concerned with 'macroconnections', or connections that can be identified between small brain regions (as opposed to microcircuitry, which describes the connections among neurons per se). These macroconnections between groups of neurons are predicted to number between 25 000 and 100 000 (). This suggests a high level of complexity, although comfortably placed between the more gross levels of brain organization and the microarchitecture, which encompasses billions of neurons and quadrillions of synapses (). Furthermore, this estimated number of macroconnections is smaller in scale than estimates of the human protein interactome at 650 000 interactions among 25 000 proteins (). Connectivity between brain regions can be assayed using tract tracing or electrophysiology. Tract tracing typically involves injecting a dye or other tracer (e.g. horseradish peroxidase) into one brain region and tracking the fate of the tracer as it follows axonal pathways (). Electrophysiological methods use electrical or other stimulation in one site along with electrical recording at a second site to test the functional connectivity of regions. Using these methods, a researcher can determine connections that send signals to the region (afferent) or away from the region (efferent). Over many years, thousands of connectivity studies have been performed, each of which typically elucidates, at most, a few connections.

Attempts to turn this huge accumulation of knowledge into an 'omics' scale database have been limited, despite the potential value of such a resource. Previous efforts have primarily used manual reviews of the literature to laboriously generate connectivity maps for limited parts of the brain. In 1991, Felleman and Van Essen published a connectivity matrix of the macaque visual cortex covering 305 pathways between 32 areas (). Currently, a large number of collated connections are stored in the Collations of Connectivity data on the Macaque brain database (CoCoMac) (). CoCoMac contains detailed information from 413 literature reports regarding 7007 macaque brain regions. A fourth model organism with large-scale connectivity data is the rat, with more than 40 000 formalized reports of connections in the Brain Architecture Management System (BAMS) (). Information is added to these databases manually, and therefore, they are accurate but sparse. Currently, the only complete connectome scale database is the neuron-level wiring diagram of Caenorhabditis elegans, determined from electron micrographs (). We sought to extend and complement manual efforts with automated text mining techniques. More than 10 years of efforts to recognize gene and protein mentions and their interactions inspire our work (). In the gene interaction task, one must extract information from sentences such as 'gene A interacts with gene B' (to give a toy example). Despite the difficulty of this task, great progress has been made. A comprehensive evaluation of kernel methods for extracting proteinprotein interactions detailed precision and recall values ranging from 45 to 70% by varying experiment design, dataset and method tested (). At the second Critical Assessment of Information Extraction systems in Biology (BioCreAtIvE II), the top team was able to extract normalized directed interaction pairs from full-text articles, with precision of 37% and recall of 33% (). The analogy to brain connectivity is tight: we wish to extract information from sentences akin to 'brain region A connects to brain region B'. This related research gives us hope that the approaches applied to extracting gene interaction information can successfully mine connectivity relations. To our knowledge, there have been no previous attempts to extract connectivity information using text mining methods. The closest work to our own is that of, which was aimed at extracting information about tract-tracing experiments, trained and evaluated with a manually annotated corpus of 1047 sentences from 21 documents. Although Burns et al. describe named entity recognition (e.g. identification of label injection sites), they did not report extraction of connectivity statements themselves. For the work presented here, we have simplified the problem by limiting our input dataset and output results. We focus on abstracts from one journal, the Journal of Comparative Neurology (JCN), because it is enriched for tract-tracing studies. We used abstracts rather than full-text documents because they are enriched for high-level summary statements and are more accessible. We also break our task into several subtasks, isolating the steps of brain region term recognition and normalization from the evaluations (). We only consider the presence of connectivity relations, ignoring the type, strength or direction of the connection. These limitations make the task simpler and set the stage for future more detailed studies. Our results show that text mining approaches previously used to analyse protein networks can be usefully applied to brain connectivity. Our large manually annotated corpus allowed testing and training of various techniques possible, and we also perform extensive manual validation of the results. Beyond the corpus-based evaluations, we compared a large set of automatically extracted connectivity statements with an existing connectivity database with favourable results. Together with our previous work on term recognition and normalization, we present a completely automated system for extraction of brain connectivity information from abstracts.
DISCUSSIONWe reported a complete system for extracting connectivity statements from biomedical abstracts. The method provides high recall of manually annotated connectivity relations described in single sentences. Precision from two separate evaluations reached 50.3% and 55.3%. By comparing with an independent source of rat connectivity, we found that precision increases with the recency and frequency of the extracted relationships. A limitation of our work is that we did not consider the direction of connectivity, although most of the relationships we extracted have a direction described in the sentence. In addition, we did not consider negation (region A does not project to region B). Extracting this information by extracting keywords such as 'afferent', 'not' or 'input' will require additional work. These relationship modifiers are manually annotated in our training corpus and can be used to design more complex rules. Our methods also did not attempt to extract the large number of relations that span multiple sentences. When these connections are taken into account, the SLK method provides only 51.7% recall of annotated connections. Application of advanced natural language-processing techniques may be necessary to bridge the sentences (e.g. anaphora resolution). The comparison of seven previously published kernel-based approaches mirrored the previous results from the protein interaction relationship extraction domain (). Further, we note that the SLK parser was applied to the drug drug interaction domain with similar results (). Several of the kernel methods have lower performance than our simple rule-based technique. Effort spent crafting more complex rules may yield higher precision at the cost of lower recall. The top three kernel methods (SLK, all-paths graph, k-band shortest path spectrum kernel) all have similar accuracy (AUC and f-measure scores) but vary in precision and recall. This difference suggests higher performance may be achieved by combining the methods. Our results suggest a larger set of input abstracts will yield a larger number of precise connections. The largest extension set is Medline with more than 10 million abstracts and 120 million sentences. Tikk and colleagues calculated that the SLK parser could process all of Medline in 141 days (). A two-step process may reduce runtime and increase accuracy by first identifying abstracts with connectivity statements and then by extracting the specific connections with SLK (). In natural language processing, it has been observed that simple statistical models (e.g. co-occurrence) can outperform more complex models based on less data (). Our experiments confirm this. We found that brain region pairs with many co-mentions tend to be connected. This simple technique produces a larger set of potential connections with reasonable precision. Although this will produce a larger set of results than the SLK method, it does not target connections that can be directly curated in light of experimental evidence because the co-mentions may or may not describe connectivity. Further, such co-occurrences may result from region proximity or biases (i.e. popularity) that may influence research attention both in the literature and in BAMS. However, such co-occurrence networks show valuable areas of focus when combined with comentions of genes and diseases (). One of the most serious challenges we encountered was in mapping extracted brain region mentions to standardized lexicons. In our previous work, we reported resolution rates of 63%, with the major limitation being gaps in the lexicons (). For the current work, the resolution rate is greatly reduced, as both brain region mentions of a connectivity relation must be mapped. It also appears that regions forming connectivity relations are harder to resolve or map, on average. For this work, we managed to double the resolution rate to the BAMS lexicon by adding synonyms. Additional work to improve the lexicons will lead to better resolution of connectivity statements, allowing validation and linking to other resources. For our evaluation to an outside database, we focused on BAMS (). Although rat is the most frequent mentioned organism, other evaluations could compare the connectivity results with the CoCoMac () or the Avian Brain Circuitry Database (). Beyond evaluation, our dataset and method can provide a large set of extracted connectivity relationships for other species-specific databases. In conclusion, we provide the first application of large-scale text mining to neuroanatomical connectivity extraction. We demonstrated that machine-learning tools designed for extraction of proteinprotein interactions are generalizable to mining brain region connections. From an information retrieval perspective, our large set of predicted connections can aid neuroscientists in forming hypotheses and models. Future work will be aimed at further evaluating and disseminating the results before extending the analysis. Paul Pavlidis).

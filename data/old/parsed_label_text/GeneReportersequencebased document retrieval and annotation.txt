GeneReporter is a web tool that reports functional information and relevant literature on a protein-coding sequence of interest. Its purpose is to support both manual genome annotation and document retrieval. PubMed references corresponding to a sequence are detected by the extraction of query words from UniProt entries of homologous sequences. Data on protein families, domains, potential cofactors, structure, function, cellular localization, metabolic contribution and corresponding DNA binding sites complement the information on a given gene product of interest. Availability and implementation: GeneReporter is available at http://www.genereporter.tu-bs.de. The web site integrates databases and analysis tools as SOAP-based web services from the EBI (
INTRODUCTIONIn face of next-generation sequencing and high-throughput analyses, the link between obtained data and existing knowledge is crucial. Automatic annotation pipelines provide useful evidence of potential functions for genes and proteins, but in a last essential step, the scientist must manually evaluate the available information. Usually, the necessary evidence is derived from scientific publications, databases and in silico predictions. Thus, tools that provide a combination of all of these relevant data for a gene or protein of interest are of high practical impact. In this context, GeneReporter offers a customizable workflow for the integrated application of protein sequence analysis and document retrieval. A large number of diverse text-mining tools exist that provide different strategies and interfaces to satisfy the extensive datamining demands in biomedical sciences (). GeneReporter identifies citations related to a gene or protein sequence of interest. The UniProt annotations of homologous sequences are used to derive keywords such as gene names, synonyms and species. These keywords provide the query terms for a subsequent literature search in PubMed (). In * To whom correspondence should be addressed.this way, GeneReporter extends and replaces MineBlast (), a similar tool which is discontinued. In comparison with other tools that connect literature to sequence information, like quickLit () and Metis (), GeneReporter is characterized by highly customizable query options, the integration of InterPro and the direct access to the original EBI and NCBI databases.

The usage of current sequence search tools becomes increasingly slower as databases of protein sequences continue to grow exponentially. Tachyon, a new algorithm that identifies closely related protein sequences âˆ¼200 times faster than standard BLAST, circumvents this limitation with a reduced database and oligopeptide matching heuristic. Availability and implementation: The tool is publicly accessible as a webserver at http://tachyon.bii.a-star.edu.sg and can also be accessed programmatically through SOAP.

Elucidation of human disease similarities has provided new insights into etiology, disease classification and drug repositioning. Since dysfunctional regulation would be manifested as the decoupling of expression correlation, disease similarity (DS) in terms of dysfunctional regulation mechanism (DRM) could be estimated by using a differential coexpression based approach, which is described in a companion paper. Due to the lack of tools for estimating DS from the viewpoint of DRM in public domain, we implemented an R package DSviaDRM to identify significant DS via DRM based on transcriptomic data. DSviaDRM contains five easy-to-use functions, DCEA, DCpathway, DS, comDCGL and comDCGLplot, for identifying disease relationships and showing common differential regulation information shared by similar diseases. Availability and implementation: DSviaDRM is available as an R package, with a users guide and source code, at http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DSviaDRM/index.html.
IntroductionDisease similarity (DS) study has emerged as an active research area, which helps to systematically investigate etiology, pathogenesis and even perform drug repositioning because drug clinical application can be appropriated from one disease to its similar ones. In recent years, scientists explored DS based on clinical manifestations (), electronic medical records (), disease-related genes () and disease-related differentially expressed genes (). Accordingly, several analysis tools and databases have been released to detect disease relationships, such as DOSim (), DiseaseConnect (), Human Phenotype Ontology (), Comparative Toxicogenomics Database () and MalaCards (). It has been realized that although clinical manifestations and electronic medical records supply valuable information for estimating DS, it is hard to unravel underlying mechanisms hidden in disease relationships. While, the disease relationships generated from disease-related genes/pathways are inevitably biased to well-studied diseases and thus offer limited chance to discover novel findings. It has been well established that diseases are highly correlated to the rewiring of gene regulatory network or dysfunctional regulation, and differential coexpression analysis (DCEA) has proved to be useful in exploring potential differential regulation mechanism (i.e. dysfunctional regulation mechanism, DRM;shows the overall design and main outputs of DSviaDRM. First, DCEA carries out differential coexpression analyses at both gene level and gene pair level (). Second, DCpathway transforms the calculation results from gene level to pathway level, based on which DS estimates disease similarities and outputs significantly similar diseases in the form of a disease network. Then, comDCGL extracts common differentially coexpressed genes (DCGs) and differentially coexpressed links/ pairs (DCLs) shared by similar diseases. Finally, by integrating transcriptional regulation information, the common DCGs and DCLs are presented as a gene network via comDCGLplot. Following this architecture, we introduce the above five functions one by one. DCEA: DCEA includes DCp and DCe methods which were developed in our previous works to identify DCGs and DCLs (). DCp calculates differential coexpression values (dC) of N genes for M diseases, as well as their pand q-values; while DCe calculates correlation values of P gene pairs for M diseases, and their p-, q-values (see the Supplementary File for more algorithmic information of DCp and DCe). DCpathway: DCpathway includes a pathway library which comes from MSigDB and involves 6176 pathways and 21 075 genes. By calculating the dC of a pathway as the average dC of its component genes, DCpathway outputs the dC values of 6176 pathways for each disease as shown in. DS: DS is the core of the whole package. It computes the partial correlation coefficients of pathways' dCs between any two diseases as their DS measure. Partial correlation coefficient (Eq. 1) is evoked from an R package, ppcor.

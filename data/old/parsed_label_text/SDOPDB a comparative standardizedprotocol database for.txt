This article reports the development of SDOP-DB, which can provide definite, detailed and easy comparison of experimental protocols used in mouse phenotypic analyses among institutes or laboratories. Because SDOP-DB is fully compliant with international standards, it can act as a practical foundation for international sharing and integration of mouse phenotypic information.
INTRODUCTIONRecent progress in functional genomics has resulted in an enormous volume of experimental data in the biomedical field. In this context, standardized data formats to describe laboratory workflows are essential for effective archiving and sharing of experimental results. For example, the Functional Genomics Experiment (FuGE) models the components of an experimental activity that are common across different technologies including protocols, samples and data (). Also, the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBIs) provide an integrated ontology for the description of life science and clinical investigations (http://obiontology.org/page/Main_Page). Although both the FuGE and OBI provide general components to describe experimental protocols, there has been little effort to provide domain-specific components to directly compare differences between protocols for specific experimental assays. For that purpose, we have developed a new data format termed Standardized Description of Operating Procedures (SDOPs), which provides an assay-specific descriptive framework and enables direct and detailed comparison of procedural parameters. Using this data format, this work presents a comparative standardized-protocol * To whom correspondence should be addressed. database, SDOP-DB (http://www.brc.riken.jp/lab/bpmp/SDOP/), as a practical application to share, compare and evaluate the contents of protocols to enable data comparisons and analyses in the field of large-scale mouse phenotyping.

SELAM is a forward time population genetic simulation program that provides a flexible framework for simulating admixture between any number of ancestral populations. The program can be used to simulate complex demographic and selection models, including dioecious or mon-oecious populations, autosomal or sex chromosomes, local adaptation, dominance, epistasis, and mate choice. Availability and Implementation: The SELAM package (C þþ source code, examples and manuals) is available via github at https://github.com/russcd/SELAM. This package is distributed under version 3 of the GNU general public license.
IntroductionThere is a growing appreciation for the importance of admixture in a variety of evolutionary processes. Admixture has played a critical role in the evolutionary histories of non-African modern humans (), Drosophila melanogaster (), and numerous other species. Admixture has the potential to influence a wide variety of evolutionary processes including shaping patterns of neutral genetic variation, introducing adaptive () and deleterious alleles (), and producing novel ecologically and reproductively isolated lineages (). In order to study patterns of local ancestry across the genome and to develop novel theoretical predictions, an efficient and a flexible simulation framework that can track complete ancestry information and incorporate an array of selective and demographic functions is essential. Previous studies have used coalescent approaches to study the distributions of haplotype structure resulting from relatively ancient admixture events (). Though efficient, the coalescent has limited utility for studies that focus on natural selection, which is of central interest for many admixed populations (although see e.g. Ewing and Hermisson 2010). For this reason, forward in time simulations are appealing, and recently a number of efficient forward-time simulation programs have been released (). The majority of these software packages are designed to simulate the evolution and inheritance of mutations distributed along a chromosome. Although this approach is capable of simulating admixture (seefor one implementation), by design these programs do not retain full ancestral information and many require substantive burn-in periods to achieve genetic equilibrium. If the process and consequences of admixture are the primary interest, and not the evolutionary factors that generate the genetic diversity present in ancestral populations, an efficient simulation framework can be achieved by tracking local ancestry, rather than specific mutations, along chromosomes. Similar methods have been used previously in the context of studying relatively short evolutionary processes such as artificial selection (), and more generally for long term population genetic inference (). As the number of generations increases, this approach often performs poorly due to the rapid accumulation of recombination events that must be tracked in all descendent individuals. Here, we propose mitigating these issues by tracking local ancestry in genomic segments that can be accessed and inherited as a group. We implement this solution in SELAM, a forward-time population genetic simulator that is designed to efficiently handle both short and long-term admixture simulations while retaining complete local ancestry information. Furthermore, this program incorporates a broad spectrum of

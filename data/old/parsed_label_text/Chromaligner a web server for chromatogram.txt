Chromaligner is a tool for chromatogram alignment to align retention time for chromatographic methods coupled to spectrophotometers such as high performance liquid chromatography and capillary electrophoresis for metabolomics works. Chromaligner resolves peak shifts by a constrained chromatogram alignment. For a collection of chromatograms and a set of defined peaks, Chromaligner aligns the chromatograms on defined peaks using correlation warping (COW). Chromaligner is faster than the original COW algorithm by k 2 times, where k is the number of defined peaks in a chromatogram. It also provides alignments based on known component peaks to reach the best results for further chemometric analysis. Availability: Chromaligner is freely accessible at http://cmdd.csie .

Motivation: The global alignment of protein interaction networks is a widely studied problem. It is an important first step in understanding the relationship between the proteins in different species and identifying functional orthologs. Furthermore, it can provide useful insights into the species evolution. Results: We propose a novel algorithm, PISwap, for optimizing global pairwise alignments of protein interaction networks, based on a local optimization heuristic that has previously demonstrated its effectiveness for a variety of other intractable problems. PISwap can begin with different types of network alignment approaches and then iteratively adjust the initial alignments by incorporating network topology information , trading it off for sequence information. In practice, our algorithm efficiently refines other well-studied alignment techniques with almost no additional time cost. We also show the robustness of the algorithm to noise in protein interaction data. In addition, the flexible nature of this algorithm makes it suitable for different applications of network alignment. This algorithm can yield interesting insights into the evolutionary dynamics of related species.

INTRODUCTIONProteinprotein interactions (PPIs) are crucial to a wide variety of cellular processes, and the interacting proteins are likely to evolve with high correlation during the evolution of species (Barabasi;). Thus, the use of PPI information can help detect functional orthologs, while sequence homology alone is often not sufficient to identify conserved protein complexes (). Ever since high-throughput experimental screening techniques such as yeast two-hybrid analysis (), mass spectrometry () and tandem-affinity purification () made protein interaction networks available for several species, efforts have been made in the bioinformatics community to extract useful biological information from these networks. Protein interaction networks provide a more complete and higher-level representation of molecular components than has been available before, and also enable genome-scale understanding of the cell from a systems perspective (). One important goal has been to produce accurate alignments of two or more of these networks, with the expectation that this would help in establishing the biological function of unknown proteins by exhibiting their correspondence with the proteins of another species with known biological function and providing insight into evolutionary dynamics. Alignments of protein interaction networks can be broadly classified into two categories: local and global alignments. The distinction is similar to the one made for sequence alignment algorithms. More specifically, local network alignment is concerned with identifying a subnetwork of one species closely matching a subnetwork of another species or having a certain topology (). Typically, multiple closely matching subnetworks are identified by such algorithms, which may be mutually inconsistent (). On the other hand, global network alignment attempts to map two or more networks as a whole, and their output is a single mapping between the vertices of the networks (). Furthermore, the objective of global alignment of PPI networks is to search for the best consistent mapping between all vertices across the networks, which can reveal evolutionarily conserved functions at the system level. In contrast to local network alignment, relatively little attention has been paid to global network alignment. In the present article, which deals with the global alignment problem, we view this mapping as a bipartite matching, where the vertices on one side of the bipartite graph are the proteins in one network, and the vertices on the other side are the proteins in the other network. Following the rapidly increasing availability of large PPI networks, many analytical and algorithmic approaches have been developed for their comparative analysis. Previous work on the problem of PPI network alignment includes NetworkBLAST-M (), Graemlin 2.0 (), IsoRank (), IsoRankN (), PATH () and GRAAL (), although a number of other techniques exist as well (). A couple of these () build on a *To whom correspondence should be addressed.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press.

Moreover, some of these methods can handle more than two networks. NetworkBLAST-M uses a new data representation of networks and computes a local alignment by greedily finding regions of high local conservation based on inferred phylogeny. Graemlin 2.0 provides a network aligner to compute both local and global alignments by training a network inference algorithm on a known set of alignments, and then optimizing the learned objective function on the set of all networks. IsoRank first finds pairwise alignment scores across all pairs of networks, obtained by a spectral method on a product graph; it then uses these scores in a greedy algorithm to produce the final global alignment. The more recent IsoRankN uses a different method of spectral clustering on the multiple alignment graph to compute a global alignment of multiple PPI networks. PATH formulates the pairwise network alignment as a graph matching problem and solves its convex and concave relaxations by iteratively updating the weights and following the path of solutions thus created. GRAAL, in contrast, computes a sequence-free pairwise alignment by using the notion of graphlet degree signatures. As pointed out in the literature (), one of the main difficulties faced by network alignment algorithms is the lack of an accurate and reliable gold standard for evaluation purposes. Another challenge is the computational complexity of network alignment algorithms. The problem of network alignment is a generalization of the intractable subgraph isomorphism problem. A biological challenge is that a network alignment algorithm must efficiently and effectively identify biologically conserved functions.

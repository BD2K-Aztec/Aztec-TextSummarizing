Motivation: Recent developments in experimental methods facilitate increasingly larger signal transduction datasets. Two main approaches can be taken to derive a mathematical model from these data: training a network (obtained, e.g., from literature) to the data, or inferring the network from the data alone. Purely data-driven methods scale up poorly and have limited interpretability, whereas literature-constrained methods cannot deal with incomplete networks. Results: We present an efficient approach, implemented in the R package CNORfeeder, to integrate literature-constrained and data-driven methods to infer signalling networks from perturbation experiments. Our method extends a given network with links derived from the data via various inference methods, and uses information on physical interactions of proteins to guide and validate the integration of links. We apply CNORfeeder to a network of growth and inflammatory signalling. We obtain a model with superior data fit in the human liver cancer HepG2 and propose potential missing pathways.
INTRODUCTIONInformation about signalling networks is increasingly abundant. Thanks to novel high-throughput methods, large amounts of data about the interactions among proteins is available, which is encompassed in (unsigned and undirected) proteinprotein interaction networks (PINs) (). More precise (but with less coverage) information is derived from literature and is often described by means of signed and directed causal interactions among proteins. These give rise to what we will call here prior knowledge networks (PKNs). PKNs are partially collected in different databases [e.g. KEGG (), Reactome (), WikiPathways () and several are accessible via the portal Pathway Commons (. These databases typically contain literature-derived interactions curated with different degrees of stringency, and based on experimental publications under different experimental conditions using different cell types. PKNs are, for example, very useful to study topological properties of networks () or to map data (Ideker and Sharan 2008, Terfve and Saez-Rodriguez 2012). However, they are not functional in the sense that they cannot be used for simulation of a signalling process and therefore prediction of the outcome of a certain experiment, which is fundamental to understand signal transduction and its alterations. The most common way to model a signalling network is to write down its biochemistry and subsequently translate it to a mathematical form, typically a system of differential equations (). However, information in PKNs often lacks the required mechanistic detail. In these cases, logic formalisms are a useful approach since all they need is to add logic gates to the existing (signed and directed) interactions. One can generate logic gates by manual curation based on literature, for example (), reviewed in (). An alternative to manual curation consists of generating a logic model from the PKN that is subsequently trained to experimental data (). This method, implemented in the Bioconductor package CellNOptR (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/saezrodriguez/software.html), provides context-specific models with predictive power. It is efficient at handling large amounts of data as the space of possible models is limited by the prior knowledge. This key feature of the approach, however, is also its main limitation: there might be missing links as databases are not complete, and the effect of cross talk between pathways is often not taken into account in the canonical linear representation of the pathways. Hence, adding links to the PKN based on the dedicated data can lead to an improved goodness of fit (). With a different and complementary perspective, different 'reverse engineering' methods have been used to infer networks from perturbation experiments using data-driven methods that do not rely on prior knowledge of the network (). Most of these methods were first developed for transcriptional data but can be applied also to signalling data. For example, in () Bayesian networks () were used to infer the connections between 67 proteins with high-throughput data collected using a micro-western array.

Different methods were also applied in the context of the DREAM initiative (www.the-dream-project.org) for the DREAM4 Predictive Signalling Network Challenge (). Twelve research groups inferred signalling networks from perturbation experiments data and were evaluated based on the accuracy of their predictions of the outcome of the network under different experimental conditions. One of the methods that performed best in this task was a simple approach, strictly data-driven, that encodes significant effects of stimuli and inhibitors on measured proteins in a causeeffect network (). These purely data-driven methods need to consider all possible topologies, and thus in general, need more data and scale-up worse than methods that rely on a given topology such as CellNOptR. Furthermore, the resulting data-driven networks (that we will call here DDNs) are limited to interactions between perturbed and measured nodes that are only a subset of the nodes involved in the pathways. Thus, DDNs are not as biologically interpretable as the PKNs and mapping DDNs to PKNs is not simple as one link in the inferred network can generally correspond to multiple links in the PKN. Hence, it is not trivial how to correctly map this relationship. In this article we attempt to combine the strengths of literature-based and data-driven inference methods. We describe a procedure (implemented in the R package CNORfeeder), to integrate prior knowledge encoded in the PKN with data-driven information obtained using reverse-engineering approaches. PINs are used to prioritize links and to provide experimental support for them, and thus help to discriminate among options and add information on integrated links. The resulting network is then trained against experimental data to obtain a final refined model that has a better fit to data with respect to the PKN, highlighting plausible links that were missing in the PKN. We illustrate its application with a signalling network encompassing multiple pathways and readouts trained with data from the liver cancer cell HepG2. We show how CNORfeeder provides a significantly improved fit based on links supported by known interactions among proteins.

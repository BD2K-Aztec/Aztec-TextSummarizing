Motivation: The nucleosome is the basic repeating unit of chromatin. It contains two copies each of the four core histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 and about 147 bp of DNA. The residues of the histone proteins are subject to numerous post-translational modifications, such as methylation or acetylation. Chromatin immunoprecipitiation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) is a technique that provides genome-wide occupancy data of these modified histone proteins, and it requires appropriate computational methods. Results: We present NucHunter, an algorithm that uses the data from ChIP-seq experiments directed against many histone modifications to infer positioned nucleosomes. NucHunter annotates each of these nucleosomes with the intensities of the histone modifications. We demonstrate that these annotations can be used to infer nucleosomal states with distinct correlations to underlying genomic features and chromatin-related processes, such as transcriptional start sites, enhancers, elongation by RNA polymerase II and chromatin-mediated repression. Thus, NucHunter is a versatile tool that can be used to predict positioned nucleosomes from a panel of histone modification ChIP-seq experiments and infer distinct histone modification patterns associated to different chromatin states. Availability: The software is available at
INTRODUCTIONThe genome of eukaryotes is packaged into a macromolecular structure called chromatin. The basic repeating unit of chromatin is the nucleosome, which contains two copies each of the four core histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4, around which a 147-bp stretch of DNA is wrapped in a flat left-handed superhelix (). Nucleosomes form approximately every 200 bp along the genome to package the underlying DNA. Apart from the packaging function, nucleosomes may serve as a signaling module () that is integrated into biological processes acting with and on chromatin. This signaling function depends on post-translational modifications of the histone proteins, such as acetylation and methylation of lysine residues.These histone modifications may serve as a binding platform for non-histone proteins, whose activities change chromatin structure and function. When nucleosomes tend to form at the same or nearby genomic positions in different cells, they are called (well) positioned. Positioned nucleosomes are important for the hypothesis that nucleosomes constitute a signaling module, because gross movements of modified nucleosomes along the chromatin fibers may lead to a loss of coherence between the modifications and the genomic features and/or functions. The binding locations of modified histone proteins can be determined by a technique called chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing [ChIP-seq;. The immunoprecipitation step enriches for chromatin fragments containing a histone modification of interest, whereas the sequencing step is used to quantify the abundance of the underlying DNA. Because the core histone proteins are part of a stable protein DNA complex, it is natural to assume that the localization of modified histone proteins corresponds to the position of the nucleosomes. This suggests that histone modification ChIP-seq data can be used to infer nucleosome positions. However, this is far from being a trivial task for a number of reasons: (i) histone binding does not seem to be as sequence-specific as for many transcription factors; (ii) nucleosome positions can change considerably with time and across cells; and (iii) the data are affected by sparse sampling and high noise. Nucleosome calling algorithms, such as the one presented here, aim at detecting positioned nucleosomes. To obtain a comprehensive and reliable set of predictions, one should combine the information contained in as many ChIP-seq experiments as possible and allow for some plasticity in the shape of the signal. However, modified histones tend to be mixed-source factors (), which means that the degree of positioning can vary considerably across the genome. In regions where nucleosomes occupy different positions in different cells (e.g. within the body of actively transcribed genes), nucleosome calling algorithms are less suitable than segmentation approaches [Song and Smith (2011);, which aim at detecting domains of high nucleosome abundance. A number of tools for the inference of nucleosome positions have already been developed. Most of them apply signal processing techniques, such as Fourier transforms (), wavelet decomposition () and ad hoc filters (), to smooth the enrichment profile, followed by the detection of local maxima. Others are based on Bayesian modeling of the nucleosome *To whom correspondence should be addressed.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press.

These methods do not allow one to control for systematic biases by comparing the nucleosome calls with data from control experiments. Furthermore, they cannot integrate data from multiple histone marks in a straightforward manner. Finally, because of the large size of the problem, e.g. the human genome, and the potentially high number of histone modifications, the runtime and memory consumption of these tools may limit their applicability. Our tool can use information from a control sample to correct for systematic biases inherent in this high-throughput technology. It is designed to integrate multiple histone marks to broaden the range of nucleosome positions that can be detected. It annotates each identified nucleosome with the contributing histone modifications. We will demonstrate that these annotations can be used to cluster nucleosomes by their histone modification patterns. This clustering yields patterns of modifications that can be correlated to the function of the chromatin, such as transcriptional start sites and enhancers, or to the underlying process, such as transcriptional elongation by RNA polymerase II. These results support the assumption that nucleosomes serve as signal modules for biological process and that the corresponding histone modification patterns are a reflection of the signaling taking place on these modules.
DISCUSSIONThe fast-paced development of chromatin immunoprecipitationbased techniques is heading toward an increased spatial resolution for DNAprotein interactions. In line with this trend, we developed NucHunter, a software for base pair resolution nucleosome identification in ChIP-seq experiments. The innovative aspects of this tool reside in a more accurate and efficient signal processing, an improved statistical analysis of the peaks, the possibility of integrating data from a control sample and to consider multiple histone modifications at once. We put forward a nucleosome-centric view, because if we view the modifications (either sequentially or in a combinatorial pattern) as a reflection of a signaling activity then nucleosomes can be viewed as 'signaling modules' (). In agreement with this idea, we found that nucleosomes can be clustered into distinct subgroups. These subgroups either mark certain functional regions of the genome, such as promoters and enhancers, or are related to biological processes, such as elongation or chromatin-mediated repression. Although this is not a new finding [see Ernst and], we think that our approach has the benefit of assigning the data to a physical entity that carries the information: the nucleosome. Thus, separation of different histone modification patterns into distinct subgroups becomes much more meaningful than by arbitrarily binning the genome into non-overlapping windows (), where two nucleosomes with different modification patterns could be present.In summary, we developed a new tool called NucHunter that is able to identify positioned nucleosomes along the genome using ChIP-seq data of histone modifications and annotates each nucleosome with (i) a flag indicating presence or absence of a certain histone modification and (ii) the number of contributing reads (if one is interested in a more quantitative view). We demonstrated that NucHunter performs better than currently available tools and has some features not present in any of them. By focusing on the nucleosome as information carrier, charting the epigenome will become much more meaningful and will in the long run allow for unraveling novel chromatin-mediated mechanisms.

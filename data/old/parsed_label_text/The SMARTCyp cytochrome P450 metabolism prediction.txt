The SMARTCyp server is the first web application for site of metabolism prediction of cytochrome P450-mediated drug metabolism. Availability: The SMARTCyp server is freely available for use on the web at www.farma.ku.dk/smartcyp where the SMARTCyp Java program and source code is also available for download.
INTRODUCTIONThe most important drug-metabolizing enzymes in humans are cytochromes P450 (CYPs). They oxidize a wide range of substrates and contribute to the metabolism of 90% of all drugs (). While there are methods for site of metabolism prediction which are solely based on semi-empirical calculations of the substrates (), more accurate results should be achieved by explicitly including the reactivity of each site in a substrate. Hitherto, reactivity models for CYPs have been restricted to semi-empirical calculations of the stability of intermediates (). Later studies have shown that more accurate activation energies for CYPs can be computed by performing very time consuming density functional theory (DFT) transition state calculations on a heme group porphyrin ring model (). SMARTCyp, however, presents the first solution for both fast and exact prediction of CYP reactivity. Accuracy of activation energies is ensured by making very extensive DFT calculations and speed is gained by saving these in a precalculated library so that they need only be looked up at execution. SMARTCyp has been validated for prediction of metabolism by the 3A4 isoform, which contributes to the metabolism of half of all drugs (). SMARTCyp has also been shown to work well for six other CYP isoforms (, b). In this application note, we describe the SMARTCyp server, the first web service for prediction of CYP-mediated metabolism.

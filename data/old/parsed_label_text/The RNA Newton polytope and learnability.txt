Motivation: Computational RNA structure prediction is a mature important problem that has received a new wave of attention with the discovery of regulatory non-coding RNAs and the advent of high-throughput transcriptome sequencing. Despite nearly two score years of research on RNA secondary structure and RNA–RNA interaction prediction, the accuracy of the state-of-the-art algorithms are still far from satisfactory. So far, researchers have proposed increasingly complex energy models and improved parameter estimation methods, experimental and/or computational, in anticipation of endowing their methods with enough power to solve the problem. The output has disappointingly been only modest improvements, not matching the expectations. Even recent massively featured machine learning approaches were not able to break the barrier. Why is that? Approach: The first step toward high-accuracy structure prediction is to pick an energy model that is inherently capable of predicting each and every one of known structures to date. In this article, we introduce the notion of learnability of the parameters of an energy model as a measure of such an inherent capability. We say that the parameters of an energy model are learnable iff there exists at least one set of such parameters that renders every known RNA structure to date the minimum free energy structure. We derive a necessary condition for the learnability and give a dynamic programming algorithm to assess it. Our algorithm computes the convex hull of the feature vectors of all feasible structures in the ensemble of a given input sequence. Interestingly, that convex hull coincides with the Newton polytope of the partition function as a polynomial in energy parameters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach toward computing the RNA Newton polytope and a systematic assessment of the inherent capabilities of an energy model. The worst case complexity of our algorithm is exponential in the number of features. However, dimen-sionality reduction techniques can provide approximate solutions to avoid the curse of dimensionality. Results: We demonstrated the application of our theory to a simple energy model consisting of a weighted count of A-U, C-G and G-U base pairs. Our results show that this simple energy model satisfies the necessary condition for more than half of the input unpseudo-knotted sequence–structure pairs (55%) chosen from the RNA STRAND v2.0 database and severely violates the condition for $13%, which provide a set of hard cases that require further investigation. From 1350 RNA strands, the observed 3D feature vector for 749 strands is on the surface of the computed polytope. For 289 RNA strands, the observed feature vector is not on the boundary of the polytope but its distance from the boundary is not more than one. A distance of one essentially means one base pair difference between the observed structure and the closest point on the boundary of the polytope, which need not be the feature vector of a structure. For 171 sequences, this distance is larger than two, and for only 11 sequences, this distance is larger than five.

INTRODUCTIONComputational RNA structure and RNARNA interaction prediction have always been important problems, particularly now that RNA has been shown to have key regulatory roles in the cell (). Furthermore, with the advent of synthetic biology at the whole organism level (), high-throughput accurate RNA engineering algorithms are required for both in vivo and in vitro applications (). Since the dawn of RNA secondary structure prediction nearly two score years ago (), the research community has proposed increasingly complex models and algorithms, hoping that refined features together with better methods to estimate their parameters would solve the problem. Early approaches considered mere base pair counting, followed by the Turner thermodynamics model, which was a significant leap forward. Recently, massively feature-rich models empowered by parameter estimation algorithms have been proposed, but they provide only modest improvements. Despite significant progress in the last three decades, made possible by the work ofon measuring RNA thermodynamic energy parameters and the work of several groups on novel algorithms (;) and machine learning approaches (), the RNA structure prediction accuracy has not reached a satisfactory level yet (). Why is it so? Up to now, human intuition and computational convenience have led the way. We believe that human intuition has to be equipped with systematic methods to assess the suitability of a given energy model. Surprisingly, there is not a single method to assess whether the parameters of an energy model are learnable. We say that the parameters of an energy model are learnable iff there exists at least one set of such parameters that renders every known RNA structure to date, determined through radiograph or NMR, the minimum free energy structure. Equivalently, we say that the parameters of an energy model are learnable iff 100% structure prediction accuracy can be achieved when the training and test sets are identical. The first step toward high-accuracy structure prediction is to make sure that the *To whom correspondence should be addressed.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press.

In this work, we provide a necessary condition for the learnability and an algorithm to verify it. The problem of learnability was previously studied for sequence alignment using similar methods (). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach toward a systematic assessment of the suitability of an energy model for RNA structure prediction. Note that a successful RNA folding algorithm needs to have the generalization power to predict unseen structures as well. However, if an energy model is inherently incapable of predicting known structures correctly, then it does not matter if it has the generalization power. We leave analysis of the generalization power for future work.

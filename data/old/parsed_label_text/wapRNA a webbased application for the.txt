mRNA/miRNA-seq technology is becoming the leading technology to globally profile gene expression and elucidate the transcriptional regulation mechanisms in living cells. Although there are many tools available for analyzing RNA-seq data, few of them are available as easy accessible online web tools for processing both mRNA and miRNA data for the RNA-seq based user community. As such, we have developed a comprehensive web application tool for processing mRNA-seq and miRNA-seq data. Our web tool wapRNA includes four different modules: mRNA-seq and miRNA-seq sequenced from SOLiD or Solexa platform and all the modules were tested on previously published experimental data. We accept raw sequence data with an optional reads filter, followed by mapping and gene annotation or miRNA prediction. wapRNA also integrates downstream functional analyses such as Gene Ontology, KEGG pathway, miRNA targets prediction and comparison of genes or miRNAs different expression in different samples. Moreover, we provide the executable packages for installation on users local server. Availability: wapRNA is freely available for use at http://waprna .big.ac.cn. The executable packages and the instruction for installation can be downloaded from our web site. Contact:
INTRODUCTIONRNA-Seq is a recently developed revolutionary approach for transcriptome profiling and miRNA analysis using next generation sequencing technologies. It can allow us to study RNA in further depth and more accurate measurement. Studies using this method have already altered our view of transcriptome and miRNA. Recently, a lot of methods have been developed to process the different aspects of RNA-seq data, such as short reads mapping (), gene annotation and differential geneexpression analysis (). Meanwhile, several web-services for RNA and microRNA analysis have also been developed, such as rQuant.web (), MAGIA

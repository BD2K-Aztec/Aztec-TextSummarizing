PPfold is a multi-threaded implementation of the Pfold algorithm for RNA secondary structure prediction. Here we present a new version of PPfold, which extends the evolutionary analysis with a flexible probabilistic model for incorporating auxiliary data, such as data from structure probing experiments. Our tests show that the accuracy of single-sequence secondary structure prediction using experimental data in PPfold 3.0 is comparable to RNAstructure. Furthermore, alignment structure prediction quality is improved even further by the addition of experimental data. PPfold 3.0 therefore has the potential of producing more accurate predictions than it was previously possible. Availability and implementation: PPfold 3.0 is available as a platform-independent Java application and can be downloaded from
INTRODUCTIONThe Pfold package predicts (non-pseudoknotted) RNA secondary structure by combining a stochastic context-free grammar (SCFG) with an evolutionary model (). PPfold is a recent multi-threaded re-implementation of Pfold (SukosdSuko). The Pfold model has been shown to result in highly accurate predictions when the input alignment is of high quality (). In a different approach, data from high-throughput, quantitative RNA structure probing methods have also recently been used in thermodynamic prediction methods to increase prediction accuracy (). However, phylogenetic and probing data have only been used independently in RNA secondary structure prediction so far. Here, we present PPfold 3.0, which integrates these different sources of information at the level of the model. This is expected to increase prediction accuracy beyond what is possible with either evolutionary information or experimental data alone.

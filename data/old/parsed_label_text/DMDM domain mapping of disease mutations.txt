Domain mapping of disease mutations (DMDM) is a database in which each disease mutation can be displayed by its gene, protein or domain location. DMDM provides a unique domain-level view where all human coding mutations are mapped on the protein domain. To build DMDM, all human proteins were aligned to a database of conserved protein domains using a Hidden Markov Model-based sequence alignment tool (HMMer). The resulting protein-domain alignments were used to provide a domain location for all available human disease mutations and polymorphisms. The number of disease mutations and polymorphisms in each domain position are displayed alongside other relevant functional information (e.g. the binding and catalytic activity of the site and the conservation of that domain location). DMDMs protein domain view highlights molecular relationships among mutations from different diseases that might not be clearly observed with traditional gene-centric visualization tools.
INTRODUCTIONThe domain mapping of disease mutations (DMDM) database provides an aggregated view of all human coding disease-related mutations and SNPs for each protein domain. Domains are the structural, functional and evolutionary units of proteins (). Most proteins contain multiple domains in a variety of domain combinations; and different domain combinations are associated with different protein functions (). Thus, the aggregated view of all human mutations at the domain level is an extremely useful tool for visualizing the molecular events that lead to diseased and healthy states in organisms. DMDM will also aid scientists to generate new hypotheses concerning the role of protein domains in key complex biological systems.

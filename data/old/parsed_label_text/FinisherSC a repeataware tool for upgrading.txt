We introduce FinisherSC, a repeat-aware and scalable tool for upgrading de novo assembly using long reads. Experiments with real data suggest that FinisherSC can provide longer and higher quality contigs than existing tools while maintaining high concordance. Availability and implementation: The tool and data are available and will be maintained at
IntroductionIn de novo assembly pipelines for long reads, reads are often trimmed or thrown away. Moreover, there is no evidence that stateof-the-art assembly pipelines are data-efficient. In this work, we ask whether state-of-the-art assembly pipelines for long reads have already used up all the available information from raw reads to construct assembly of the highest possible quality. To answer this question, we first collect output contigs from the HGAP () pipeline and the associated raw reads. Then, we pass them into our tool FinisherSC to see if higher quality assemblies can be consistently obtained after post-processing.
DiscussionAlthough FinisherSC was originally designed to improve de novo assembly by long reads, it can also be used to scaffold long contigs (formed by short reads) using long reads. For that use case, we note that the contigs formed by short reads can sometimes have length shorter than the average length of long reads. Therefore, we suggest users to filter out those short contigs before passing them into FinisherSC.

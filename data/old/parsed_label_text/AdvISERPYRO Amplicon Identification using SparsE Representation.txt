Motivation: Converting a pyrosequencing signal into a nucleotide sequence appears highly challenging when signal intensities are low (unitary peak heights 55) or when complex signals are produced by several target amplicons. In these cases, the pyrosequencing software fails to provide correct nucleotide sequences. Accordingly, the objective was to develop the AdvISER-PYRO algorithm, performing an automated , fast and reliable analysis of pyrosequencing signals that circumvents those limitations. Results: In the current mycobacterial amplicon genotyping application , AdvISER-PYRO performed much better than the pyrosequencing software in the following two situations: when converting Single Amplicon Sample (SAS) signals into a correct single sequence (97.2% versus 56.5%), and when translating Multiple Amplicon Sample (MAS) signals into the correct sequence pair (74.5%). Availability: AdvISER-PYRO is implemented in an R package (http:// sites.uclouvain.be/md-ctma/index.php/softwares) and can be used in broad range of clinical applications including multiplex pyrosequen-cing and oncogene re-sequencing in heterogeneous tumor cell samples.
INTRODUCTIONPyrosequencing is a DNA sequencing technology that has many applications including rapid genotyping of a broad spectrum of bacteria. In this type of application, bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequence is a commonly used target for identifying organisms at the species and even strain level (). High throughput sequencing (NGS) is now emerging as a powerful technology able to characterize at the finest scale the diversity in natural microbial and viral populations (). However, NGS is expensive and requires complex sample preparation and elaborate data analysis. Despite the increased use of NGS for the study of microbial diversity, pyrosequencing therefore remains a cost-effective solution for genotyping a portion of the bacterial genome that allows rapid bacterial or viral genotyping as well as rapid assessment of microbial antibiotic resistance (). Pyrosequencing is based on pyrophosphate release during nucleotide incorporation (). The four possible nucleotides are sequentially dispensed in a predetermined order. The first chemi-luminescent signal produced during nucleotide incorporation is detected by a charge-coupled device camera in the pyrosequencer and displayed in a pyrogram TM. The pyrogram TM can then be converted automatically into a nucleotide sequence by dedicated software or visually by an experienced operator. The number of incorporated nucleotides at each position is computed from the corresponding peak height. The pyrosequencing data analysis software frequently produces reading errors in homopolymer regions due to the nonlinear light response following incorporation of consecutive identical nucleotides. However, pyrosequencing software interpretation is mostly reliable when a pyrogram TM with intermediate (45) unitary peak heights (i.e. the peak heights observed after incorporation of a single nucleotide) is obtained from a Single Amplicon Sample (SAS, i.e. a sample that includes a single target amplicon), as inwhere unitary peak heights are close to 30. Two main situations generate signals preventing automated translation into a correct nucleotide sequence. This happens first when a sample contains a very low DNA concentration, which induces a signal with peak heights close to the noise level (). It happens also when the pyrogram TM compiles signals from a Multiple Amplicon Sample (MAS, i.e. a sample that includes multiple target amplicons). In this case, the complex signal reflects indeed the integration of signals produced by each amplicon (). The pyrosequencing data analysis software is not able to distinguish each amplicon-specific signal; hence, it has a limited capacity to produce correct amplicon-specific nucleotide sequences. In such situations, the only option left is a cumbersome, time-consuming and usually very inefficient visual interpretation. *This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/), which permits non-commercial re-use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.

In this case, several primers are used simultaneously, which leads to overlapping of primer-specific pyrosequencing signals. The mPSQed and the MultiPSQ softwares were recently developed to aid researchers in designing and analyzing multiplex pyrosequencing assays (). The mPSQed software can be used to avoid situations where competing signals from SNPs in different sequences cancel each other out. The MultiPSQ software enables the analysis of multiplex pyrograms originating from various pyrosequencing primers. A second application is found in clinical molecular diagnostic laboratories testing mutations in KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA and EGFR genes (). Recently, a virtual pyrogram generator (Pyromaker) was developed to resolve complex pyrosequencing results () and could be used to generate simulated pyrogram TM based on user inputs. The interpretation of MAS-pyrosequencing signals was also addressed by Shen et al. who developed a pyrosequencing data analysis software for EGFR, KRAS and BRAF mutation analysis (). The software aimed at identifying the presence of mutated cells as well as their proportions. In a first step, this software compared peak heights with a known wild-type peak pattern. If the signal did not fit with the expected wild-type pattern, the software compared it with the mutant peak patterns. When a mutation was identified, the percentage of the candidate mutant gene in the specimen was computed using a built-in formula specific for each mutation. The main drawback of this software was the need for a built-in formula, defined specifically for each mutation and not based on objective parameter computation exploiting a statistical method. A third application that generates MAS signals is related to samples including a heterogeneous microbial population. In this context, a novel approach based on a single Sanger-sequencing reaction was recently proposed for identifying each microbial population from the original population mixture (). This novel approach was based on the reconstruction of a sparse signal using a small number of measurements. Sparse representations of signals have received a lot of attention in recent years (). The problem solved by sparse representation is to look for a compact representation of signals in terms of linear combination of atoms in an over-complete dictionary [i.e. a dictionary including a number of atoms (p) that exceeds the dimension of the signal space (n)]. In the present study, each atom of the dictionary corresponds to a pyrosequencing signal generated from a known amplicon. For a y testing signal of length n, the issue for sparse representation is to find a vector j (j  1 ,. .. , p) such that the following objective function is minimized:where x ij is i th element of the j th atom, and jj j jj 0 is the L 0 norm of vector j and is equivalent to its number of nonzero components. After having constructed the model, the values of j regression coefficients are used for identifying which of the atoms are contributing to the y testing signal. Unfortunately, finding the solution to this problem is NP-hard. However, a solution can be obtained by replacing the L 0 norm by a L p norm penalty on the regression coefficients. L 1 norm penalties are used in lasso regression while L 2 norm penalties are used in ridge regression and a combination of L 1  and L 2 norm penalties are used in Elastic Net (ELNET) (). To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that sparse representation of signals is used to analyze pyrosequencing signals. Accordingly, the objective of the present study was to develop a new algorithm for improving the analysis of pyrosequencing signals. This algorithm, called AdvISER-PYRO, deciphers each amplicon-specific signal that contributes to the resulting global signal. In the present study, AdvISER-PYRO was used to identify mycobacterial species by pyrosequencing. Considering the likely existence of heterogenous mycobacterial populations in a clinical specimen, this case study appears particularly relevant. Indeed, the identification of causative mycobacterial agents in infected samples can be affected by the presence of other ubiquitous mycobacterial species (). Moreover, coinfection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTB) in clinical samples, and notably in AIDS patients, can easily be overlooked when using conventional identification methods, and presents therefore a real challenge in diagnosis and treatment. This probably explains at least partially why evidence of dual infection with MTB and NTB is scanty (). The performance of AdvISER-PYRO in identifying mycobacterial amplicons was assessed using signals generated by SAS (n  220) and MAS (n  144), the latter containing twodistinct amplicons. For SAS signals, the AdvISER-PYRO performance was compared with the percentage of correct identification obtained with the pyrosequencing data analysis software (PSQ TM 96 MA Software V.2.1.1, Biotage AB, Sweden) and reflecting the pyrogram TM translation into a correct nucleotide sequence.
DISCUSSIONThe AdvISER-PYRO algorithm appears as an efficient tool that can reliably be used to identify amplicons in pyrosequencing signals generated by SAS or MAS. The first prerequisite is that pyrosequencing signal analysis by AdvISER-PYRO requires the corresponding amplicon representation in the dictionary. Otherwise, the model produced by AdvISER-PYRO would be wrong. In that case, the fitted values would be weakly correlated with the pyrosequencing signal, which will allow operators to avoid erroneous interpretation. From this study, it also appears that a quantitative interpretation of signal contributions is not feasible. Indeed, the estimated relative contribution of each amplicon in the MAS-2 pyrosequencing signals did not correspond to the initial ratio of each DNA target. This derives from significant differences in PCR amplification efficiency of these DNA targets, hence to differences in the respective amount of amplicons to be pyrosequenced. Moreover, the estimated relative contribution of each amplicon in the MAS-1 pyrosequencing signals did not correspond to the initial ratio of PCR product, as previously reported inwho showed that all primertarget association does not perform equally well. A second prerequisite for using AdvISER-PYRO is that each amplicon produces a specific signal which is different from signals generated by all other amplicons expected to be produced in the genetic identification process. If this is indeed the case, the AdvISER-PYRO algorithm can be applied to a wide spectrum of pyrosequencing-based genotyping applications other than mycobacterial species typing, and is able to analyze genotyping data generated by various types of polymorphisms including single nucleotide polymorphism, single nucleotide repeat sequence, deletion and insertion. A cyclic dispensation order can be used if itsatisfies this second prerequisite (i.e. if it produces distinct amplicon-specific signals). However, choosing a selected dispensation order can be advantageous to maximise the signal differences inherent to pyrosequencing signals produced respectively by each type of amplicon according to the genotyping application. Maximising signal differences could also be achieved by increasing the number of dispensed nucleotides with the deleterious consequence that long reads are associated with higher peak height variance. Consequently, the choice of an optimal nucleotide dispensation order is based on a difficult compromise between the quantity and the quality of the acquired information. In the context of oncogene re-sequencing in heterogeneous tumor cell samples, AdvISER-PYRO could be used as a tool complementary to Pyromaker (). The latter is used to complete the representative learning dictionary by generating a theoretical pyrosequencing signal for each mutation for which no biological sample is yet available; hence, experimental signal is still lacking in the dictionary. If multiplex pyrosequencing needs to be carried out, AdvISER-PYRO could be applied to the analysis of complex signals obtained with multiplex primers designed with the mPSQed software (). In this study, AdvISERPYRO showed a high percentage of correct identification with signals generated from samples containing two distinct amplicons. Although this has not been yet tested and needs to be validated, it should be pointed out that AdvISER-PYRO can also be used on samples containing more than two distinct amplicons. In the present study, the optimisation of AdvISER-PYRO hyperparameters was done on a validation dataset to obtain the higher percentage of correct identification, irrespective of the impact of a false-positive or-negative results. However, such optimisation should ideally be performed for each genotyping application by considering the global clinical context. In oncogene re-sequencing applications, the SCT could indeed be defined in terms of relative contribution by estimating the Limit of Blank (LoB) from a dilution series experiment. This LoB could be modulated to limit the probability of either false-negative or-positive results by considering the clinical impact relative to both types of error. As illustrated here, AdvISER-PYRO is expected to substantially help improve the reading and translation of the pyrogram TM into a correct sequence or set of sequences in case of SAS and MAS signals, respectively. Validation and optimization of AdvISER-PYRO in clinical applications other than mycobacterial genotyping are already under way.

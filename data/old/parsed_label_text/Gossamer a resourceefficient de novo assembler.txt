Motivation: The de novo assembly of short read high-throughput sequencing data poses significant computational challenges. The volume of data is huge; the reads are tiny compared to the underlying sequence, and there are significant numbers of sequencing errors. There are numerous software packages that allow users to assemble short reads, but most are either limited to relatively small genomes (e.g. bacteria) or require large computing infrastructure or employ greedy algorithms and thus often do not yield high-quality results. Results: We have developed Gossamer, an implementation of the de Bruijn approach to assembly that requires close to the theoretical minimum of memory, but still allows efficient processing. Our results show that it is space efficient and produces high-quality assemblies. Availability: Gossamer is available for non-commercial use from http://www.genomics.
INTRODUCTIONHigh-throughput sequencing technologies have enabled researchers to produce unprecedented volumes of short read data. The de novo assembly of such data is a core problem in bioinformatics with numerous applications in the analysis of genomes, metagenomes, and transcriptomes. There are several common approaches to the de novo assembly of short read data, including those based on greedy extension (), overlap layout extension (), and de Bruijn graphs (). Our assembler, Gossamer, is an extension of a prototype based on the succinct representation of de Bruijn assembly graphs as a bitmap or set of integers (). It assembles base-space paired reads such as those from an Illumina sequencing platform.

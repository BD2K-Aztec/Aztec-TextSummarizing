Motivation: Phybase is an R package for phylogenetic analysis using species trees. It provides functions to read, write, manipulate, simulate, estimate, summarize and plot species trees, which contain not only the topology and branch lengths but also population sizes. Availability: The Phybase package is available at the R repository. The manual and supporting materials including source code, sample R code and sample data files for the species tree analysis are available at
INTRODUCTIONSpecies trees are the fundamental tools in studying biodiversity and evolutionary history. It has been appreciated that phylogenies of genes (gene trees) are distinct from phylogenies of species (species trees) (). However, most phylogenetic programs are designed for estimation of gene trees and lack functions to perform species tree analysis. As an example, when species trees are recorded as modified Newick files, the population size parameter () in the species tree is not readable by most phylogenetic programs including PAUP (), PHYLIP () and MrBayes (), making it difficult to summarize species trees in these phylogenetic programs. It is desirable to have a phylogenetic program that can provide functions necessary for the analysis of species trees. Phybase is an R package designed specifically for species tree analysis, although it is also capable of analyzing gene trees. It provides functions to read, write, manipulate, simulate, estimate and summarize species trees. The input/output functions in the package can read and write DNA sequences and phylogenetic trees (gene trees and species trees) in the Newick format. Phylogenetic trees are read in as a string and then transformed to a matrix, which describes the ancestral relationships of nodes and branch lengths. The nodes matrix provides an easy access for developers to further manipulate the tree, while the tree string provides a useful interface to other phylogenetic packages in R such as the package APE (). Basic functions are available in the package to manipulate phylogenetic trees including deleting and swapping nodes, rooting and unrooting trees. Phybase includes functions to summarize collections of species trees such as those that arise from bootstrap analysis or the posterior distribution * To whom correspondence should be addressed.in Bayesian analysis of species trees (). Phybase is able to simulate DNA sequences from a prespecified species tree. Gene trees can be generated from a species tree under the coalescent model (), which assumes a molecular clock for gene trees and the species tree. Alternatively, gene trees can be generated from a non-clock-like species tree which allows variable mutation rates along the branches (populations) in the species tree (). The variable mutation rate is most likely due to changes in generation time as well as changes to the overall rate of mutation along the branches (populations) in the species tree. Phybase has functions to generate DNA sequences from gene trees under a variety of substitution models (). The species tree can be simulated from another phylogenetic package PhySim in R.

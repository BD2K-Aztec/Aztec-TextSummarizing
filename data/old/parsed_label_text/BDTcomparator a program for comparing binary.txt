The BDTcomparator facilitates the selection of the best performing binary classification model or binary diagnostic procedure from the many possible alternatives by comparing their predictions with a known output, measured with the use of a system recognized as the gold standard. The program calculates the estimates of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, predictive values and diagnostic likelihood ratios along with appropriate confidence intervals. Furthermore, all pairwise comparisons with respect to the above-mentioned measures are calculated. The formatted results can be exported to a text-file. Availability and Implementation: BDTcomparator is distributed under the GNU GPLv3 license and is freely available for download from http://www.tox-portal.net. We provide programs for both Linux and Windows operating systems. The source code of the program is provided in our companion website
INTRODUCTIONData analysis is one of the main driving forces of modern science. Among others, it results in the fast development of disease screening procedures and classification algorithms for data mining. In both areas, the ultimate goal is to select the best performing model or diagnostic procedure (DP) from the many possible alternatives by comparing their predictions with a known output, measured with the use of a system recognized as a gold standard. Furthermore, one may be interested in pairwise performance comparisons between the many competing models/DPs. In our report, we focus on the binary DPs/classification problems (both prediction and measured output can be either zero or one) and propose comprehensive, freely available software supporting this type of analyses. A reallife example of its functioning is presented based on the drug safety assessment problem.

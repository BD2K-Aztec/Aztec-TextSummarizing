We are constructing an ontology for traditional Korean medicine, and we started with medicinal materials to express the relationships between patients symptoms, diseases and treatments. Biological materials and mineral resources have been used traditionally for patient treatments. The ontology includes various data related to these materials, such as their scientific names, parts of materials used, effectiveness and related oriental organ of the human body.

Motivation: Nonlinear dose–response models are primary tools for estimating the potency [e.g. half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC) known as IC50] of anti-cancer drugs. We present drexplorer software, which enables biologists to evaluate replicate reproducibility, detect outlier data points, fit different models, select the best model, estimate IC values at different percentiles and assess drug–drug interactions. drexplorer serves as a computation engine within the R environment and a graphical interface for users who do not have programming backgrounds. Availability and implementation: The drexplorer R package is freely available from GitHub at https://github.com/nickytong/drexplorer. A graphical user interface is shipped with the package.
IntroductionUnderstanding the doseresponse relationship of therapeutic compounds is a major focus of clinical oncology. Large-scale drug screening in cancer cell lines has demonstrated that different genomic characteristics (mutations) confer distinct drug sensitivity, supporting patient stratification into treatment regimens on the basis of genomic markers (). Cell lines resistant to single-drug treatment may respond to synergistic drug combinations (). As cell viability assays become widely used, it is important to provide easily accessible tools to analyze drug profiling data. We developed drexplorer software in the R environment (R Core) to encompass several aspects of doseresponse analysis: assess reproducibility of replicated experiments, detect outlier data points, fit different models, identify the best model, estimate inhibitory concentration (IC) values and evaluate drugdrug interactions.
ConclusionDrexplorer is a versatile R package encompassing several aspects of doseresponse and drugdrug interaction analysis. The GUI enables biologists without programming skills to analyze their data.

RegaDB is a free and open source data management and analysis environment for infectious diseases. RegaDB allows clinicians to store, manage and analyse patient data, including viral genetic sequences. Moreover, RegaDB provides researchers with a mechanism to collect data in a uniform format and offers them a canvas to make newly developed bioinformatics tools available to clinicians and virolo-gists through a user friendly interface. Availability and implementation: Source code, binaries and documentation are available on http://rega.kuleuven.be/cev/regadb. RegaDB is written in the Java programming language, using a web-service-oriented architecture.
INTRODUCTIONAdvances in infectious diseases research require efficient collaboration and exchange of clinical and virological data.Researchers need access to large amounts of data to test hypotheses or extract valuable information through data mining (). For this purpose, RegaDB was developed as a free and open source data management and analysis environment for infectious diseases (). RegaDB runs on Windows, Linux or Mac OS X. The system can be installed within a hospital or institute so that the data stays within the clinical environment. RegaDB follows the idea of an integrated environment for bioinformatics analysis, such as the Genetic Data Environment (), ViroLab () and Geneious (). The difference is that RegaDB uses a relational database, and can be locally or remotely accessed. This allows RegaDB to be used for clinical management and/or research in one locality or for longterm data-sharing collaborations between different institutes.

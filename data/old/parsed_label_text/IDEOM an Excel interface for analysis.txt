The application of emerging metabolomics technologies to the comprehensive investigation of cellular biochemistry has been limited by bottlenecks in data processing, particularly noise filtering and metabolite identification. IDEOM provides a user-friendly data processing application that automates filtering and identification of metabolite peaks, paying particular attention to common sources of noise and false identifications generated by liquid chromatography– mass spectrometry (LC–MS) platforms. Building on advanced processing tools such as mzMatch and XCMS, it allows users to run a comprehensive pipeline for data analysis and visualization from a graphical user interface within Microsoft Excel, a familiar program for most biological scientists. Availability and implementation: IDEOM is provided free of charge at http://mzmatch.sourceforge.net/ideom.html, as a macro-enabled spreadsheet
INTRODUCTIONMetabolomics aims to measure all small molecules (metabolites) in a biological system. However, challenges associated with data analysis, in particular the accurate identification of metabolites () have restricted progress. Recent advances in high resolution mass spectrometry (MS) provide accurate mass detection that significantly improves metabolite identification from liquid chromatographyMS (LCMS) () although limitations still abound (), and noise or artifact peaks are often incorrectly identified as metabolites ().

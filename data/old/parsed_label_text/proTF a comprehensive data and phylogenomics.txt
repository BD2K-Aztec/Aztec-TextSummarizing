Investigation of transcription factors (TFs) is of extreme significance for gleaning more information about the mechanisms underlying the dynamic transcriptional regulatory network. Herein, proTF is constructed to serve as a comprehensive data resource and phylogenomics analysis platform for prokaryotic TFs. It has many prominent characteristics: (i) detailed annotation information, including basic sequence features, domain organization, sequence homolog and sequence composition, was extensively collected, and then visually displayed for each TF entry in all prokaryotic genomes; (ii) workset was employed as the basic frame to provide an efficient way to organize the retrieved data and save intermediate records; and (iii) a number of elaborated tools for phylogenomics analysis were implemented to investigate the evolutionary roles of specific TFs. In conclusion, proTF dedicates to the prokaryotic TFs with integrated multi-function, which will become a valuable resource for prokaryotic transcriptional regulatory network in the post-genomic era.
INTRODUCTIONIdentification, classification and phylogenomics analysis of transcription factors (TFs) within or among specific organisms can help us to highlight how they evolutionarily conserved or diverse in order to fit in the ever-changing environment effectively (). In the past decade, a number of specialized TF databases were established. The TRANSFAC and DBD databases were released as a universal data source covering putative TFs for all completely sequenced genomes and TrSDB contains the TFs derived from nine eukaryotic species (). Within the plant kingdom, progressively integrated and comprehensively annotated biological databases had * To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Various information of TFs in animal are abundantly explored by databases such as TFcat (), TFdb (), FlyTF () and ITFP (). In addition, fungal TFs can be accessed from FTFD (). Up to now, however, no comprehensive platform for computational repository is available to provide access to the large complete sets of prokaryotic TFs. RegTransBase is a database of regulatory interactions in prokaryotes, which captures the knowledge in public scientific literature and contains 1131 TFs in the latest version (). ooTFD is a database aimed at capturing information regarding the polypeptide interactions, which comprise and define the properties of TFs with limited species and TF entries (). ExtraTrain provides integrated and easily manageable information for 679 816 extragenic regions and for the genes delimiting each of them. For TF, it only contains 16 TF families (). In addition, the currently developed AraCXylS only holds information about TF family AraC in bacteria and the BacTregulators contains three TF families (TetR, AraC and IclR) in bacteria and archaea (). DBTBS (), RegulonDB (), TRACTOR_DB (), cTFbase () and ArchaeaTF () only aim to focus on the TFs in Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, gamma-proteobacteria, cyanobacteria and archaea, respectively. Herein, a new TF database proTF is constructed to provide an integrated useful resource for TFs research and facilitate further investigation of transcriptional regulatory network in prokaryotes. In comparison with other comprehensive TF databases, proTF contains the following prominent characteristics: (i) offered an extensively detailed annotation information of each TF entry in all the completely sequenced prokaryotic genomes; (ii) employed the workset as the basic frame to well organize the retrieved data and save intermediate records; and (iii) implemented a number of phylogenomics analysis tools to investigate the evolutionary roles of specific TFs in or across different prokaryotic organisms. In conclusion, proTF is dedicates to the prokaryotic TFs with multiple integrated phylogenomics function.Page: 2494 24932495

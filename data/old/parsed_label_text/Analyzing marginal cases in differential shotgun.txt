We present an approach to statistically pinpoint differentially expressed proteins that have quantitation values near the quantitation threshold and are not identified in all replicates (marginal cases). Our method uses a Bayesian strategy to combine parametric statistics with an empirical distribution built from the reproducibility quality of the technical replicates.

INTRODUCTIONShotgun proteomics describes a large-scale approach to analyzing complex peptide mixtures (i.e. mixtures originating from biological fluids, cell lysates, etc.). Briefly, the strategy is to perform protein digestion followed by peptide chromatographic separation online with tandem mass spectrometry (MS2) for protein identification (). The study of complex mixtures is challenging in itself because peptides are under-sampled during data acquisition by mass spectrometry. The combined nature of sample complexity, data acquisition methodologies and under-sampling is bound to generate considerable experimental variation. Indeed, one may expect to observe some 25% additional uniquely identified proteins when comparing two technical replicates of a complex mixture (). As we demonstrate below, this variation is largely due to peptide ions whose relative quantitation values lie near the detection threshold and therefore do not appear in all technical replicates (marginal cases). One of the goals of proteomics is to distinguish between various states of a biological system according to protein expression differences. By directly applying common statistical approaches to pinpoint differentially expressed proteins without taking the necessary precautions that are inherently related to technical

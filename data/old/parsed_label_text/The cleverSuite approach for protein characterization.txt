Motivation: The recent shift towards high-throughput screening is posing new challenges for the interpretation of experimental results. Here we propose the cleverSuite approach for large-scale characterization of protein groups. Description: The central part of the cleverSuite is the cleverMachine (CM), an algorithm that performs statistics on protein sequences by comparing their physico-chemical propensities. The second element is called cleverClassifier and builds on top of the models generated by the CM to allow classification of new datasets. Results: We applied the cleverSuite to predict secondary structure properties, solubility, chaperone requirements and RNA-binding abilities. Using cross-validation and independent datasets, the cleverSuite reproduces experimental findings with great accuracy and provides models that can be used for future investigations. Availability: The intuitive interface for dataset exploration, analysis and prediction is available at http://s.tartaglialab.com/clever_suite.
INTRODUCTIONDue to the latest advances in technology, a large number of sequences have been deposited into databases () and computational methods are being developed for their analysis and interpretation (). Some algorithms require per-case configuration () or lack intuitive interface (), which prohibits diffusion among non-computational scientists. Experimental scales encoding physico-chemical properties are useful to retrieve basic information on protein sequences () and to predict features associated with protein folding (), aggregation () and molecular interactions (). For instance, the Zyggregator method predicts aggregation propensity using a combination of physicochemical properties including secondary structure, solvent accessibility, hydrophobicity and polarity (). Similarly, the SVMprot algorithm exploits amino acid properties to predict protein families annotated in Pfam (). Indeed, experimental scales can be employed to investigate large-scale properties of proteomes and identify common features () but no systematic approach has been attempted so far to provide a general-purpose algorithm. We aim to provide researchers with an intuitive and statistically robust method to characterize protein groups exploiting the information contained in primary structure. Our premise is that the user should be able to make multiple hypotheses on the training sets and build models that others can test. As a general-purpose universal optimization is theoretically impossible (), our strategy is to build a class of predictors that are specific for the individual problems. We pay particular attention to derive unbiased models because over-fitting of internal parameters can undermine the general applicability of algorithms (). Our approach, the cleverSuite, provides a series of easy-to-use, configuration-free tools with interactive graphical interface. The central part of the suite is the cleverMachine (CM), an algorithm to characterize protein datasets. CM does not require external fitting parameters and returns multiple physico-chemical properties ranked by their significance. Relevant properties are merged together to provide coherent and consistent classification, allowing complex feature analysis. The second element of our suite is the cleverClassifier (CC) that builds on top of results generated by the CM to allow classification of protein datasets using state of the art machine-learning approaches (). CM and CC algorithms are freely available at http://s.tartaglia lab.com/page/clever_suite. We illustrate the powerfulness of our approach by making predictions of several protein features, including structural disorder (), solubility (), chaperone interactions () and RNA-binding abilities ().

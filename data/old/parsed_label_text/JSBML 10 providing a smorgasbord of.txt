JSBML, the official pure Java programming library for the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) format, has evolved with the advent of different modeling formalisms in systems biology and their ability to be exchanged and represented via extensions of SBML. JSBML has matured into a major, active open-source project with contributions from a growing, international team of developers who not only maintain compatibility with SBML, but also drive steady improvements to the Java interface and promote ease-of-use with end users. Availability and implementation: Source code, binaries and documentation for JSBML can be freely obtained under the terms of the LGPL 2.1 from the website http://sbml.org/Software/JSBML.

IntroductionThe Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) is a widely used format that enables easy distribution of systems biology data, models and diagrams, and it allows the easy exchange of data and models between a variety of software systems (). Given the wide coverage of the latest SBML version, it is unsurprising that the standard is relatively complex. An appropriate computational architecture greatly simplifies V C The Author 2015.

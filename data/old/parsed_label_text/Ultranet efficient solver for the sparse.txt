Graphical Gaussian models (GGMs) are a promising approach to identify gene regulatory networks. Such models can be robustly inferred by solving the sparse inverse covariance selection (SICS) problem. With the high dimensionality of genomics data, fast methods capable of solving large instances of SICS are needed. We developed a novel network modeling tool, Ultranet, that solves the SICS problem with significantly improved efficiency. Ultranet combines a range of mathematical and programmatical techniques, exploits the structure of the SICS problem and enables computation of genome-scale GGMs without compromising analytic accuracy. Availability and implementation: Ultranet is implemented in Cþþ and available at www.broadinstitute.org/ultranet.
INTRODUCTIONGraphical Gaussian models (GGMs) are rapidly gaining traction as a promising approach to identify gene regulatory networks from genomics data (; SchaferSchafer and). GGMs are created by estimating the inverse   of the sample covariance matrix S, and then computing the partial correlation matrix. Assuming that the observations (typically gene expression values) have a multivariate Gaussian distribution, P  ij  0 indicates that variables (genes) i and j are conditionally independent, given the other variables (i.e. all correlation between them can be explained by co-correlation with other variables); P  ij 6  0 indicates that they are conditionally dependent (i.e., the correlation between them cannot be explained in full by co-correlation with other observed variables). The advantage of GGMs is that edges (non-zero P  ij s) are more likely to reflect direct dependencies between genes than edges in correlation networks (; Schafer). Alongside computing a relevant input matrix, the difficulty with GGM networks is to estimate  . A robust way to achieve this is to solve the penalized log-likelihood maximization problem    arg max 10

Proteins can adopt a variety of conformations. We present a simple server for scoring the agreement between 3D atomic structures and experimental envelopes obtained by atomic force micros-copy. Three different structures of immunoglobulins (IgG) or blood coagulation factor V activated were tested and their agreement with several topographical surfaces was computed. This approach can be used to test structural variability within a family of proteins. Availability and implementation: DockAFM is available at http://

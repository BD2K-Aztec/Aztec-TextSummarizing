Motivation: DNA and protein patterns are usefully represented by sequence logos. However, the methods for logo generation in common use lack a proper statistical basis, and are non-optimal for recognizing functionally relevant alignment columns. Results: We redefine the information at a logo position as a per-observation multiple alignment log-odds score. Such scores are positive or negative, depending on whether a columns observations are better explained as arising from relatedness or chance. Within this framework, we propose distinct normalized maximum likelihood and Bayesian measures of column information. We illustrate these measures on High Mobility Group B (HMGB) box proteins and a dataset of enzyme alignments. Particularly in the context of protein alignments, our measures improve the discrimination of biologically relevant positions. Availability and implementation: Our new measures are implemented in an open-source Web-based logo generation program, which is available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Yu/ logoddslogo/index.html. A stand-alone version of the program is also available from this site.
INTRODUCTIONPatterns or motifs that are shared among multiple DNA or protein sequences often correlate with important biological functions. A widely used method for representing and studying such patterns is provided by 'sequence logos' (). A sequence logo represents concisely two important features of a multiple alignmentthe 'information content' at each alignment position and the frequencies of the nucleotides or amino acids observed at that position. Here, we suggest modifications to the way in which the information content is usually measured. These modifications yield a direct connection between the information for an alignment position and a multiple alignment log-odds score (). We have implemented a program that uses the modified information measures, and illustrate its application to protein alignments.

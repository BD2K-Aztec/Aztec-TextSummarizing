Motivation: Metagenome analysis requires tools that can estimate the taxonomic abundances in anonymous sequence data over the whole range of biological entities. Because there is usually no prior knowledge about the data composition, not only all domains of life but also viruses have to be included in taxonomic profiling. Such a full-range approach, however, is difficult to realize owing to the limited coverage of available reference data. In particular, archaea and viruses are generally not well represented by current genome databases. Results: We introduce a novel approach to taxonomic profiling of metagenomes that is based on mixture model analysis of protein signatures. Our results on simulated and real data reveal the difficulties of the existing methods when measuring achaeal or viral abundances and show the overall good profiling performance of the protein-based mixture model. As an application example, we provide a large-scale analysis of data from the Human Microbiome Project. This demonstrates the utility of our method as a first instance profiling tool for a fast estimate of the community structure.
INTRODUCTIONMetagenomics has significantly enhanced the exploration of the biological diversity on our planet. Shotgun sequencing of environmental DNA has provided a wealth of data for the analysis of the taxonomic and functional composition of a broad range of microbial communities. To make sense of the vast amount of sequences, novel tools had to be developed that could cope with the anonymous and fragmented nature of metagenomic data. In particular, to answer the classical 'who is there?' question, several specific problems have to be addressed. The short length of sequence fragments, the insufficient phylogenetic coverage of current genome databases and the computational expense of the underlying algorithms are still limiting factors in taxonomic profiling of metagenomes today. Because we usually have no a priori knowledge about the composition of a metagenome, a taxonomic profiling method, in principle, must be able to cover all three domains of life. To encompass the whole spectrum of possible biological sources, besides bacteria, archaea and eukaryota, also viral entities have to be considered. A major problem of such a full-range taxonomic analysis arises from the limited coverage of genome databases that provide the required reference data for the characterization of novel sequences. In particular, archaea and viruses are generally not well-represented by current database genomes, making it difficult to obtain realistic estimates of the corresponding abundances. The existing methods for taxonomic profiling can be divided into homology-based and model-based approaches. Among the homology-based approaches, most methods rely on a BLAST () similarity search of metagenomic sequences against a genomic reference database (e.g). In this case, the phylogenetic classification of sequences is derived from the taxonomic labels of those reference sequences with a significant similarity. This, in principle, enables the measurement of the proportions of bacterial, archaeal, eukaryotic and viral sequences. To reduce the computational cost of the homology search step, the analysis can be restricted to certain signature () or marker () genes. However, in the latter case, the estimation of viral abundances is complicated by the fact that there are no universal marker genes for viruses. Model-based approaches build a taxon-dependent, in most cases organism-specific, feature representation of reference genomes that is used for the analysis of metagenomic sequences. Currently, all methods rely on features derived from the oligonucleotide frequencies of the taxonomically labeled reference genomes (e.g.), which are therefore often termed as composition-based methods. While in the case of homology-based methods the computational cost for taxonomic profiling increases with the number of reference sequences, for model-based approaches, the cost just increases with the number of represented taxons. A good profiling accuracy of model-based methods has been reported for microbial metagenomes that mainly comprise bacterial DNA (e.g.). Recently, also the profiling of metagenomes with a substantial fraction of eukaryotic DNA has been addressed and promising results have been reported (). However, to our knowledge, there is no systematic study that investigates the ability of model-based approaches to measure the fraction of viral DNA. Conceptually, it is not clear whether unique viral oligonucleotide signatures exist that make them generally distinguishable from microbial signatures. Besides a possible host adaptation, there is no reason why viruses should *To whom correspondence should be addressed.  The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press.

The only model-based tool that explicitly includes viral reference data is NBC (). However, as outlined by the authors, the NBC tool should not be used with mixed reference databases of, for example, viral and prokaryotic models because of a preference of NBC estimates for longer genomes. Thus, NBC virus models are not meant to supplement the microbial models for full-range taxonomic profiling and should therefore only be applied to pure virus data where no microbial contamination is anticipated. We here present the 'Taxy-Pro' method as the first modelbased taxonomic profiling approach that uses protein signatures instead of the commonly used oligonucleotide signatures. The features of these protein signatures comprise the frequencies of protein domain families according to the Pfam database (). Because it does not make sense to estimate the protein signature of a single short sequence, we do not perform a classification of metagenomic reads by means of these protein features. Instead we make use of a mixture model for taxonomic profiling that has been introduced for oligonucleotide-based profiling of metagenomes (). For mixture modeling of protein signatures, we aim to reconstruct the overall Pfam domain frequencies of a metagenome by a linear combination of genomic reference signatures. Pfam domain hits have also been used as a basis for taxonomic profiling by the CARMA () and TreePhyler () tools. However, these tools do not analyze the overall domain frequencies, but perform a computationally expensive phylogenetic classification of each sequence with a Pfam hit based on a multiple alignment with the Pfam reference sequences. In the evaluation of Taxy-Pro, we show that the protein-based mixture model provides important advantages when compared with the oligonucleotide-based model. We observed a higher accuracy of Taxy-Pro in the quantification of archaeal DNA, where the narrow spectrum of available database genomes requires a good generalization of the profiling method. In addition, we demonstrate that protein-based models can be built from viral metagenomes to obtain realistic estimates of the virus fraction. Our results indicate a strikingly higher sensitivity of the extended Taxy-Pro mixture model when compared with homology-based classification methods merely based on genomic reference data. Using the domain frequencies as obtained from the CoMet web server (), computation is about three orders of magnitude faster than a speed-optimized BLAST analysis that includes viral metagenome sequences as reference data. Because of this computational efficiency, we were able to perform a large-scale analysis of sequence data from the Human Microbiome Project (HMP,) without using a computer cluster or special hardware. In agreement with previous HMP studies (e.g.), we found that archaea are not among the abundant organisms in any of the samples. However, we observed a significant eukaryotic fraction in some samples, which has not been reported in the original studies.
DISCUSSIONWe have shown that the functional profile of a metagenome in terms of the overall protein domain frequencies can be used to infer its taxonomic composition over the whole range of biological entities. In our evaluation, we demonstrated the difficulties of the existing tools in providing full range estimates that include the proportions of all domains of life and viruses. In particular, a reliable estimation of archaeal and viral fractions constitutes a major challenge for taxonomic profiling tools. Considering the coverage of current genome databases, we found that it is necessary to include reference data from viral metagenomes to obtain realistic estimates of the virus fraction. Our results indicate that the restriction to genomic reference data in current taxonomic profiling tools leads to systematic underestimation of the virus fraction. For that reason, a large number

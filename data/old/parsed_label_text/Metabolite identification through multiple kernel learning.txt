Motivation: Metabolite identification from tandem mass spectrometric data is a key task in metabolomics. Various computational methods have been proposed for the identification of metabolites from tandem mass spectra. Fragmentation tree methods explore the space of possible ways in which the metabolite can fragment, and base the me-tabolite identification on scoring of these fragmentation trees. Machine learning methods have been used to map mass spectra to molecular fingerprints; predicted fingerprints, in turn, can be used to score candidate molecular structures. Results: Here, we combine fragmentation tree computations with kernel-based machine learning to predict molecular fingerprints and identify molecular structures. We introduce a family of kernels capturing the similarity of fragmentation trees, and combine these kernels using recently proposed multiple kernel learning approaches. Experiments on two large reference datasets show that the new methods significantly improve molecular fingerprint prediction accuracy. These improvements result in better metabolite identification, doubling the number of metabolites ranked at the top position of the candidates list.
INTRODUCTIONMetabolomics deals with the analysis of small molecules and their interactions in living cells. A central task in metabolomics experiments is the identification and quantification of the metabolites present in a sample. This is mandatory for subsequent analysis steps such as metabolic pathway analysis and flux analysis (). Mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the two predominant analytical technologies for metabolite identification. Identification is done by fragmenting the metabolite, for example, by tandem MS (MS/MS), and measuring the massto-charge ratios of the resulting fragment ions. The measured mass spectra contain information about the metabolite, but extracting the relevant information is a highly non-trivial task. Several computational methods have been suggested to identify the metabolites from MS/MS spectra. Mass spectral databases (spectral libraries) have been created (e.g.), which allow us to search measured mass spectra. Unfortunately, this approach can only identify 'known unknowns' where a reference measurement is available. Fragmentation trees are combinatorial models of the MS/MS fragmentation process. B  ocker and Rasche (2008) suggested fragmentation trees for identifying the molecular formula of an unknown compound. Later, fragmentation trees were shown to contain valuable structural information about the compound (). The relation between spectral and structural similarities has been studied by. A kernel-based machine learning approach for metabolite identification was recently introduced by, relying on predicting the molecular fingerprints as an intermediate step. Molecular fingerprints are given as bit vectors with each bit describing the existence of certain molecular property such as substructures in the molecule. After the prediction, imposing some scoring strategy, the predicted molecular fingerprints are used for searching some chemical database and finally the ranked list of candidates are generated (). Besides these two approaches, methods have been suggested for predicting MS/MS spectra from molecular structures (); commercial software packages also exist for this task. Such simulated spectra can be used to replace the notoriously incomplete spectral libraries by molecular structure databases (). Combinatorial fragmentation of molecular structure serves the same purpose (). Finally, we can search spectral libraries for similar compounds, by comparing either MS/ MS spectra () or fragmentation trees (). Seefor recent reviews. We propose a joint strategy that combines fragmentation trees and multiple kernel learning (MKL) to improve molecular fingerprint prediction and, subsequently, the metabolite identification. We first outline the metabolite identification framework and introduce fragmentation trees and their computation. Next, we introduce a family of kernels for fragmentation trees, consisting of simple node and edge statistics kernels as well as path and subtree kernels that use dynamic programming (DP) for efficient computation. We then describe state-of-the-art methods for MKL. In these experiments, we evaluate different MKL algorithms with regards to the fingerprint prediction and the metabolite identification.gives an overview for our metabolite identification framework through MKL. Fragmentation trees are computed first, followed by the computation of kernels. MKL approaches are used to integrate different kernels for molecular fingerprint prediction. The final step of the framework is to query molecular structure databases with the predicted molecular fingerprint using a probabilistic scoring function. *To whom correspondence should be addressed.

DISCUSSIONThe present work combines the combinatorial fragmentation tree approach with machine learning through a kernel-based approach. We suggest several kernels for fragmentation trees, and show how to fuse their information through MKL. The result significantly enhances molecular fingerprint prediction and metabolite identification. The closest analogs to our fragmentation tree kernels in literature are those defined for parse trees in natural language processing (); our fragmentation trees can be seen as parses of the MS/MS spectra. DP techniques similar to ours are used there for computing kernels between trees (). However, fragmentation trees have important differences to the trees defined between parses of natural language and to kernels comparing molecular structures (Mah e and Vert, 2009). Differently from natural language parses, the node labels have partial order (via their molecular weights) and also the edges have labels. Differently from kernels for molecular graphs, the label spaces of both nodes and edges are vast (subsets of molecular formulae). The comparison with the PPK employed by the FingerID () software shows that the fragmentation tree kernels are able to extract more information out of the MS/ MS spectra. Improvements are seen in both the prediction accuracy and the F1 score. Comparing with FingerID (PPK), the uniform combination of the kernels (UNIMKL) improves the molecular fingerprint prediction significantly in accuracy and F1. As witnessed by many MKL applications, the UNIMKL algorithm is hard to beat. In our result, several MKL algorithms such as ALIGNF and ' 3-norm can give slightly better result than UNIMKL. The improvements in the molecular fingerprint prediction translate to improved metabolite identification. There are several possible routes forward with the current metabolite identification framework. First, post-processing on the candidates list, such as the one proposed by, is necessary when searching a large compound database such as PubChem, because the returned candidates (hundreds to thousands) may share the same fingerprints and there is no way to differ them based only on molecular fingerprints. Second, training a separate SVM for each fingerprint property is clearly an aspect that can be improved upon, for example, by a multi-label classification approach. A still more tempting yet challenging direction would be to replace the two-step identification by an integrated prediction approach. Such an approach would potentially learn to predict the fingerprint properties that are important for discriminating metabolites from each other.

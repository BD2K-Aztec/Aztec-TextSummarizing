FermiKit is a variant calling pipeline for Illumina whole-genome germline data. It de novo assembles short reads and then maps the assembly against a reference genome to call SNPs, short insertions/deletions and structural variations. FermiKit takes about one day to assemble 30-fold human whole-genome data on a modern 16-core server with 85 GB RAM at the peak, and calls variants in half an hour to an accuracy comparable to the current practice. FermiKit assembly is a reduced representation of raw data while retaining most of the original information.

IntroductionDeep resequencing of a human sample typically results in a BAM file of 60100 GB in size. Storing, distributing and processing many such huge files is becoming a burden for sequencing facilities and research labs. While better compression helps to alleviate this issue, it adds processing time and can barely halve the size, which does not keep up with the rapidly increasing sequencing throughput. Illumina and GATK use gVCF () as a reduced representation of raw data. However, gVCF is reference dependent and it is nontrivial to encode both large and small variants consistently. We still need to go back to raw data for long events and when upgrading the reference genome. Another idea from the past practice is to assemble sequence reads into contigs that ideally retains all information in the raw data, but whether this approach is practical to Illumina human resequencing remains to be confirmed.

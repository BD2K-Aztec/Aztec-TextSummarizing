IntroductionNetwork information in biology continues to grow in utility in many contexts, from analysis of cellular mechanisms to identifying disease biomarkers. Further, the web is increasingly a platform for apps with complex user interfaces that use standard technologies such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript (JS). Cytoscape.js provides a JS application programming interface (API) to enable software developers to integrate graphs into their data models and web user interfaces. Cytoscape.js can be used in several domains, such as biological networks or social graphs. Cytoscape.js is the modern replacement for the Adobe Flash-based Cytoscape Web ().

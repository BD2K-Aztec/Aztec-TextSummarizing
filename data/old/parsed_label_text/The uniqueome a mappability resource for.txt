Quantification applications of short-tag sequencing data (such as CNVseq and RNAseq) depend on knowing the uniqueness of specific genomic regions at a given threshold of error. Here, we present the uniqueome, a genomic resource for understanding the uniquely mappable proportion of genomic sequences. Pre-computed data are available for human, mouse, fly and worm genomes in both color-space and nucletotide-space, and we demonstrate the utility of this resource as applied to the quantification of RNAseq data.

pyDockWEB is a web server for the rigid-body docking prediction of proteinâ€“protein complex structures using a new version of the pyDock scoring algorithm. We use here a new custom parallel FTDock implementation, with adjusted grid size for optimal FFT calculations , and a new version of pyDock, which dramatically speeds up calculations while keeping the same predictive accuracy. Given the 3D coordinates of two interacting proteins, pyDockWEB returns the best docking orientations as scored mainly by electrostatics and desolva-tion energy. Availability and implementation: The server does not require registration by the user and is freely accessible for academics at http://life. bsc.es/servlet/pydock
INTRODUCTIONProteinprotein interactions mediate most cellular functions; thus, a detailed description of the association process at molecular level is essential to comprehend the fundamental processes that sustain life. In such line, proteinprotein docking tools aim to identify the native binding mode between two proteins (). Such predictions are required to complement experimental techniques that cannot provide structural information at a proteomics scale given their current technical limitations. pyDock () is a rigid-body docking method in which sampling is performed by means of FTDock () and scoring implements an efficient empirical potential, composed of electrostatics and desolvation terms, with a limited contribution from van der Waals energy. The method has been successfully tested in CAPRI (). Here, we present pyDockWEB server, a new fast implementation that allows easy access to non-expert users to state-of-the-art docking predictions.

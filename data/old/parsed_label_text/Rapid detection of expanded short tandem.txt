Motivation: Long expansions of short tandem repeats (STRs), i.e. DNA repeats of 2–6 nt, are associated with some genetic diseases. Cost-efficient high-throughput sequencing can quickly produce billions of short reads that would be useful for uncovering disease-associated STRs. However, enumerating STRs in short reads remains largely unexplored because of the difficulty in elucidating STRs much longer than 100 bp, the typical length of short reads. Results: We propose ab initio procedures for sensing and locating long STRs promptly by using the frequency distribution of all STRs and paired-end read information. We validated the reproducibility of this method using biological replicates and used it to locate an STR associated with a brain disease (SCA31). Subsequently, we sequenced this STR site in 11 SCA31 samples using SMRT TM sequen-cing (Pacific Biosciences), determined 2.3–3.1 kb sequences at nucleotide resolution and revealed that (TGGAA)-and (TAAAATAGAA)-repeat expansions determined the instability of the repeat expansions associated with SCA31. Our method could also identify common STRs, (AAAG)-and (AAAAG)-repeat expansions, which are remarkably expanded at four positions in an SCA31 sample. This is the first proposed method for rapidly finding disease associated long STRs in personal genomes using hybrid sequen-cing of short and long reads.

INTRODUCTIONMany genetic disorders are caused by or associated with short tandem repeats (STRs), repetitive elements of 26 nt. Regarding the mechanism underlying the phenomenon of repeat expansion, unusual structural features of repeat-containing regions that affect cellular replication, repair and recombination are thought to induce frequent replication slippage, thereby expanding repeats (). STRs have been found in a variety of genomic regions. Huntington's disease is associated with expansion of the triplet repeat (CAG) n (polyglutamine runs in proteins) in the coding region of huntingtin (The Huntington's Disease Collaborative Research), where n528 in normal samples, n  2835 in intermediate cases, n  3640 in reduced penetrance and n440 in full penetrance (). Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy is also associated with (CAG) repeats in one exon (). In addition to exons, STRs have been observed in a variety of genomic regions such as untranslated regions (UTRs), introns and promoters. Fragile-X syndrome is associated with (CGG) repeat in the 5 0-UTR () and myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) with (CTG) repeat in the 3 0-UTR (). In introns, spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 (SCA10) is associated with (ATTCT) repeat (), myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) with (CCTG) repeat (), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/frontotemporal dementia (ALS/FTD) with (GGGGCC) repeat () and SCA36 with (GGCCTG) repeat (). Consequently, whole-genome sequencing capable of observing non-exonic regions is required to characterize STRs peculiar to a personal genome. Several expanded repeats in RNA, such as CUG, CCUG, CAG, CGG, AUUCU and UGGAA, are associated with hereditary diseases and are known to accumulate in nuclear RNA foci in which several proteins are sequestrated in the process of foci formation (for a review see). These RNA foci are thought to have a negative effect on host cells, leading to disorders in cellular pathways (). To search personal genomes for STRs, the most cost-efficient way would be to resequence an entire personal genome and to collect billions of short reads of $100 bp in length using available high-throughput sequencers. However, the infeasibility of obtaining longer reads at reasonable cost might lead to the failure to detect important STRs because expandable repeats associated with diseases can sometimes be quite long [e.g. (ATTCT) n , n  8004500 in SCA10 and (CCTG) n , n  $5000 in DM2] and are much longer than 100 bp, the typical length of short reads, *To whom correspondence should be addressed  The Author 2013.

Another serious problem is that STRs have several variants with many mutations. The spontaneous mutation rate of STRs, 3.78  10 4 to 7.44  10 2 in the human Y-chromosome (), is far higher than the rate of copy number variation, 1.7  10 6 to 1.2  10 4 (), and the reported average rate of de novo single-nucleotide variation, 1.18  10 8 (SD  0.15  10 8 ) () and 1.20  10 8 (). The ultrahigh mutation rate of STRs is thought to be a major force driving genetic variation producing a variety of STRs with differences often specific to personal genomes. Therefore, detecting various STRs by processing billions of short raw reads is fundamental to the analysis of personal genomes. Several software programs list STRs, such as Tandem Repeat Finder (), Mreps (), ATRHunter (), IMEx () and T-reks () (for a recent review that compares these programs, see); however, these conventional programs are designed to retrieve STRs from nearly complete or draft long genomes and are not intended for processing billions of short reads in a reasonable amount of time. Another problem involved in handling short reads is the difficulty of determining the accurate positions of STRs in the genome because reads filled with STRs are not included in the genome or often map to multiple locations. The problem is solvable in some cases when a flanking region around an STR in a read is long enough to map to a unique position (). To resolve these special cases, Gymrek et al. developed the program lobSTR (), which improves the efficiency of this process by selecting $240 000 candidate regions harboring STRs in the human genome. Owing to severe restrictions in potential STR regions, however, we might overlook novel STRs hidden in numerous short reads because known STRs associated with diseases are frequently much longer than 100 bp, the typical length of short reads produced by highthroughput sequencers (). Here, we propose a new cost-efficient method for calculating a comprehensive collection of STRs that are longer than short reads by inspecting the frequency distribution of STRs in short reads. To approximate the locations of such STRs, we use paired-end sequencing to facilitate locating the opposite end of the read with the focal STR in a pair, thereby narrowing down the location of the focal STR. Finally, we present a statistical procedure for selecting STRs that are significantly expanded in the case sample.
DISCUSSIONSTRs in personal genomes remain largely uncharacterized. We proposed a novel method for listing long approximate STRs with mutations in personal genomes using a massive number of short reads of length $100 bp. Here, we discuss some situations in which detecting a long expansion of STRs specific to disease samples is inherently problematic. As genomic regions of GC content 470% are difficult to cover with an ample number of Illumina reads, our method is unlikely to detect long expansions ofoccurrences in one of SCA31, NA12877, NA12878 or NA18507. For example, the arrow in the second lowest row shows that the (AAAATAGAAT) repeat is expanded only in SCA31. Our ab initio procedure analyzes this bar chart and selects STRs that are significantly abundant in the case sample (e.g., SCA31) but absent in all of the control samples. The bar chart is also useful for confirming the abundance of (AATGG) and (AACCCT) repeats, equivalent to the (GGGTTA) repeat, where the former and latter motifs are known to be enriched in centromeres and telomeres, respectively. (B) Frequency distributions of the (AAAATAGAAT) repeat. SCA31 has many 100-bp occurrences, whereas no occurrences of length 455 bp were observed in NA12877, NA12878 and NA18507 Supplementary, massive numbers of long expansions of these STRs can be found in any sample. We also presented an ab initio procedure for detecting significant expansions of STRs in case samples that are absent in control samples via comparisons between the frequency distributions of STRs in case and control samples. We demonstrated the potential applicability of this method using three publicly available control samples. To exploit this approach, however, constructing a large-scale database of the frequency distributions of STRs collected from a number of control samples is necessary.The variety of expanded STRs of length 41 kb in disease remains unexplored. Also, examining whether expansions of STRs are more pronounced in germline and somatic cells would be intriguing. Thus, after locating STRs, sequencing expanded STRs is a promising direction of study. For this purpose, SMRT TM sequencing enables the sequencing DNA fragments averaging $5 kb long as of 2013. Using SMRT TM sequencing, we were able to determine a divergent set of 2.33.1 kb STR sequences in 11 SCA31 samples, showing the instability of STR expansions. Analysis of the stability of STR expansionsThe right boundary of the insertion could be identified using paired-end reads with AAAATAGAAT repeats at their left ends and uniquely mapped reads at their right ends. The lower bar illustrates the reference genome (hg19) with an AAAAT repeat. (B) A form of expanded repeat associated with SCA31 samples. The values of i, j, l and m vary in the individual SCA31 samples. (C) We determined the values of i, j, l and m in 11 SCA31 samples using SMRT TM sequencing. This shows that $90% of the repeat expansion are (TAGAA) j and (TAAAA TAGAA. Sizes of the common STRs, (AAAG)n and (AAAAG)n, at four genomic positions in the SCA31 sample and reference genome. Note that individual STR occurrences are significantly expanded in the SCA31 sample. The PCR primers used for amplifying individual regions and the sequences of amplicons can be found in Supplementary821Rapid detection of expanded short tandem repeats in germline and somatic cells of a specific disease might eventually lead to the recognition of a functional role of STRs. In the near future, the typical lengths of short reads in the majority of commercial sequencers should increase to 150500 bases. Our method is ready to process longer reads in a straightforward manner. Furthermore, our method was designed so that it could output STRs of repeat units of any length, and we presented an illustrative case in which detecting STRs of a 10-base repeat unit from an SCA31 sample was essential. Our program will serve as a valuable tool for discovering unknown STRs in a variety of diseases, even with future advances in sequencing technology.

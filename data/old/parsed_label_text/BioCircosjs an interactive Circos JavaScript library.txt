We here present BioCircos.js, an interactive and lightweight JavaScript library especially for biological data interactive visualization. BioCircos.js facilitates the development of web-based applications for circular visualization of various biological data, such as genomic features, genetic variations, gene expression and biomolecular interactions. Availability and implementation: BioCircos.js and its manual are freely available online at http://bio info.ibp.ac.cn/biocircos/.
IntroductionMulti-faceted and complex biological data increasingly require visualization and sophisticated analyses. However, suitable visualization tools are not always available to come readily at hand. Furthermore, many biological visualization tools are desktop applications that may be difficult to install and configure. Circos () is a powerful Perl-based tool for illustrating genomic features, and is widely used in biological research. However, the graphical files it outputs are not interactive and users can thus not obtained further details by moving a mouse pointer over the data points. Alternatives to Circos, such as Circoletto (), CIRCUS () and Rcircos (), are also not interactive, whereas J-Circos (), though interactive, is a desktop software. Web visualization applications have the advantage of generating interactive images in which all elements are interactive with mouse-over explanations and clickable buttons, and are thus far more userfriendly and provide more easily accessible information. As Circos and its alternatives do not function well on web applications, an interactive Circos-like tool for web applications would greatly facilitate visualization of biological data. Based on the powerful D3 (Data-Driven Documents) () and the jQuery JavaScript library, we have developed BioCircos.js, an interactive and lightweight JavaScript library especially adapted for interactive visualization of biological data on web applications. BioCircos.js thus facilitates the development of web applications for visualization of biological data in a circular format similar to that of Circos.

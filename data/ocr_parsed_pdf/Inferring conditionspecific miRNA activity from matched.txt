ABSTRACT

Motivation: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial roles in complex cellular
networks by binding to the messenger RNAs (mRNAs) of protein
coding genes. It has been found that miRNA regulation is often con-
dition-specific. A number of computational approaches have been
developed to identify miRNA activity specific to a condition of interest
using gene expression data. However, most of the methods only use
the data in a single condition, and thus, the activity discovered may
not be unique to the condition of interest. Additionally, these methods
are based on statistical associations between the gene expression
levels of miRNAs and mRNAs, so they may not be able to reveal
real gene regulatory relationships, which are causal relationships.
Results: We propose a novel method to infer condition-speciﬁc
miRNA activity by considering (i) the difference between the regulatory
behavior that an miRNA has in the condition of interest and its behav-
ior in the other conditions; (ii) the causal semantics of miRNA—mRNA
relationships. The method is applied to the epithelial—mesenchymal
transition (EMT) and multi-class cancer (MCC) datasets. The validation
by the results of transfection experiments shows that our approach is
effective in discovering significant miRNA—mRNA interactions.
Functional and pathway analysis and literature validation indicate
that the identified active miRNAs are closely associated with the
specific biological processes, diseases and pathways. More detailed
analysis of the activity of the active miRNAs implies that some active
miRNAs show different regulation types in different conditions, but
some have the same regulation types and their activity only differs in
different conditions in the strengths of regulation.

1 BACKGROUND

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of short non-coding RNA
molecules (usually 19725 nt) that regulate gene expression Via the
full degradation of the target messenger RNA (mRNA)

transcript or the translational repression of it (Bartel, 2009).
miRNAs have been found to be involved in most biological
processes, including developmental timing, cell proliferation,
metabolism, differentiation, apoptosis, stress responses, cellular
signaling and even various human cancers (Ambros, 2003;
Bartel, 2004; Du and Zamore, 2007).

miRNA target prediction is a Vital step toward the under-
standing of miRNA activity. Because experimental methods
are limited by their low efﬁciency and high cost, computational
approaches have become a key alternative for predicting miRNA
activity. Several tools have been developed to identify miRNA
targets, such as MicroCosm (Grifﬁths-J ones et al., 2008), PicTar
(Krek et al., 2005), TargetScan (Friedman et al., 2009) and
miRanda (Betel et al., 2008). However, the predictions are
based on sequence complementarity and/or structural stability
of the putative duplex and thus have a high rate of false positives
and false negatives (Rajewsky, 2006). Furthermore, sequence
data are static and they do not change in different conditions
or at different times. Thus, from sequence data alone we are
unable to identify the effect of miRNAs on their targets’ expres-
sion in speciﬁc biological conditions, while miRNA regulation or
activity is often condition-speciﬁc (Le and Bar-Joseph, 2013).

Some recent work has combined sequence data and gene
expression data to infer miRNA activity. Cheng and Li (2008)
employed an enrichment score used by the Gene Set Enrichment
Analysis (Subramanian et al., 2005) to infer miRNA activity.
They identiﬁed the activity enhancement of miRNAs in
miRNA-transfected HeLa cells. Madden et a]. (2010) combined
correspondence analysis, between group analysis and co-inertia
analysis to detect miRNA activity using microarray datasets.
They produced a ranked list of miRNAs associated with a
speciﬁc splitting in the samples, by combining miRNA target
predictions with gene expression levels. Volinia et a]. (2010) pro-
posed T-REX to build miRNA activity map. They used the
effect of miRNAs over their targets for detecting miRNA activity
with mRNA expression profiles. Some tools also have been de-
veloped, including miReduce (Sood et al., 2006), Sylamer (van
Dongen et al., 2008), BIRTA (Zacher et al., 2012), DIANA-
mirExTra (Alexiou et al., 2010), mirAct (Liang et al., 2011),
miTEA (Steinfeld et al., 2013) and cWords (Rasmussen et al.,
2013), to infer miRNA activity. The first three are stand-alone
applications and the last four provide online services.

Inferring condition-specific miRNA activity

 

Although these methods were successfully applied to infer con-
dition-specific miRNA activity, most of them only look at a
speciﬁc condition (e.g. cancer), without considering the differ-
ence in miRNA activity between conditions. Therefore, the
miRNA activity found based on the information in one condi-
tion of interest may contain regulatory relationships that are not
unique to the condition. Moreover, when considering only one
speciﬁc condition, the number of samples that can be used is
smaller, worsening the over-ﬁtting problem with high-dimen-
sional gene expression data.

Additionally, most existing methods use statistical correlations
or associations to identify miRNAimRNA interactions.
However, associations may not reveal gene regulatory relation-
ships that are indeed causal relationships. For example, the
expression levels of an miRNA and a gene can be strongly cor-
related, but the correlation may not indicate a regulatory rela-
tionship between the miRNA and the gene because the strong
correlation may be the consequence of the regulation of a
common regulator of them.

To address the above limitations, in this article, we propose a
novel approach to discovering condition-specific miRNA activity.

To identify miRNA activity that is speciﬁc to a condition of
interest, our method exploits the difference between the regula-
tory behavior of miRNAs in the condition of interest and in the
other condition. We divide matched samples of miRNA and
mRNA expression into groups according to sample conditions,
e. g. cancer and normal. Then miRNAimRNA causal inter-
actions are examined using each group of samples, respectively,
but only those interactions showing signiﬁcant difference in their
strengths in different conditions (called significant causal inter-
actions) are retained. These signiﬁcant causal interactions are
then used to ﬁnd out active miRNAs with respect to the condition
of interest, i.e. miRNAs that have significantly different causal
interactions with mRNAs in different conditions. The significant
causal interactions associated with an active miRNA are the
condition-speciﬁc activity of this miRNA.

To capture the causal semantics of miRNAimRNA regulatory
relationships, in the above procedure, we use IDA (Maathuis et al.,
2009, 2010), a causal inference method, to estimate the strengths of
miRNAimRNA interactions. With observational data, IDA
simulates an intervention process (e.g. a gene knockdown experi-
ment) and predicts the causal effects of the intervention. It is
proved to be an effective method for predicting the causal regula-
tory effects that an miRNA has on an mRNA (Le et al., 2013).

To validate the proposed method, we apply it to two gene ex-
pression datasets: epithelialimesenchymal transition (EMT) and
multi-class cancer GVICC), respectively. The identiﬁed miRNA
activity is validated by using the miRNA transfection experiments
data, as well as by functional analysis, pathway analysis and the
information from literature. The results show that the proposed
method can effectively infer condition-specific miRNA activity.

2 METHODS
2.1 Overview of the proposed method

As illustrated in Figure 1, the method comprises the following steps:

(1) Data preparation. Given the matched miRNA and mRNA expres-
sion proﬁles, a list of differentially expressed miRNAs and

mRNAs are identiﬁed. The expression proﬁles of the differentially
expressed miRNAs and mRNAs are then split into sample groups
according to the conditions (phenotypes) of the samples. In each
condition, the miRNA and mRNA samples are matched and inte-
grated into one dataset (matrix) as an input of the next step.

(2) Using IDA to learn a causal structure and to calculate the causal
effects of each miRNA on each mRNA. This is done for each
condition separately. To overcome the over-ﬁtting problem of
high-dimensional data, we use bootstrapping to improve the sta-
bility of the estimation of causal effects.

(3) Extracting signiﬁcant miRNAimRNA causal interactions.
Kolrnogorovisrnirnov (KS) test is used to evaluate the signiﬁcance
of the difference of the causal effects of an miRNAimRNA causal
interaction in different conditions. miRNA target binding informa-
tion is used as a constraint in this step for extracting signiﬁcant
causal interactions, and an interaction that passes the KS test and
is implied by the target binding information is selected as a signiﬁ-
cant miRNAimRNA causal interaction.

(4) Detecting active miRNAs and condition-speciﬁc miRNA activity.
For each miRNA, the difference of its signiﬁcant causal inter-
actions across all conditions is assessed using the KS test. If the
test result is significant for the miRNA, then it is an active miRNA
with respect to the condition of interest, and its activity in the
condition (signiﬁcant causal interactions with the mRNAs) is con-
sidered speciﬁc to the condition.

In the following, we will present the key steps in detail.

2.2 Causal inference with IDA

The application of IDA (Maathuis et al., 2009, 2010) to matched miRNA
and mRNA expression data can be divided into two steps: (i) learning a
causal structure from expression data, and (ii) calculating causal effects
(Le et al., 2013).

In step (i), the expression levels of miRNAs and mRNAs are repre-
sented by a set of random variables. The PC algorithm (Spirtes et al.,
2000) is used to learn the causal structure of the variables in the form of a
directed acyclic graph (DAG), where the nodes represent the random
variables (miRNAs or mRNAs) and the edges denote causal relationships
between these variables.

The PC algorithm is based on conditional dependence tests. Because
different DAGs may encode the same conditional independencies in a
given dataset, the output of the PC algorithm is an equivalence class of
DAGs, which can be uniquely described by a completed partially directed
acyclic graph (CPDAG) (Maathuis et al., 2009). Learning a CPDAG
from high-dimensional data is computational expensive, and we need
to select an efficient conditional independent test to implement it. The
PC algorithm with partial correlation test (Kalisch and Biihlmann, 2007)
is proved to be uniformly consistent in the high-dimensional context, and
thus, we can use it to learn causal structures with gene expression data in
inferring gene causal regulatory networks. In this article, we use the
R-package pcalg (Kalisch et al., 2012), which implements the PC algo-
rithm with partial correlation test and set the signiﬁcant level of the
conditional independence test or = 0.01.

In step (ii), we simulate the controlled experiments with do-calculus
(J udea, 2000), to estimate the causal effect that each miRNA has on an
mRNA. Given a DAG, do-calculus can estimate the causal effect of a
node on any other node in the DAG from observational data. For an
miRNAimRNA causal interaction, we calculate the causal effect
ef(miRNA, mRNA) based on each of the DAGs represented by
the CPDAG learnt by the PC algorithm, respectively. We then use
the minimum absolute value of the obtained causal effects as the
ﬁnal result of this step, to get a lower bound on the estimated
strength of miRNAimiRNA causal interaction. For example,

the conditions (phenotypes) of the samples, and in each condition the
matched miRNA and mRNA expression samples are integrated. Then,
we identify miRNAimRNA causal relationships with IDA learning
by combining target binding information, in each condition, respectively.
Bootstrapping is used to improve the result of IDA with high-
dimensional data. KS test is then conducted to identify signiﬁcant
miRNAimRNA causal interactions. To determine if an miRNA is an
active miRNA, in each condition, we obtain the median value of all
causal effects obtained in all the B runs of bootstrapping for each signiﬁ-
cant miRNAimRNA causal interaction associated with this miRNA,
and use KS test to evaluate the signiﬁcance of the difference of this
miRNA’s activity in the two conditions

ef(miRNA, mRNA) 6 {0.75, 0.55, 70.7, 0.65}, then the ﬁnal result ef
(miRNA, mRNA) is 0.55. It suggests that the causal effect of the
miRNA on the target gene is at least 0.55. Details of how the causal
effects are calculated are out of the scope of this article and interested
readers are referred to (Le et al., 2013; Maathuis et al., 2009, 2010) for
more information.

Unstable estimation caused by the small number of samples is a chal-
lenge to the proposed method, and the problem may get more serious
with high-dimensional gene expression data. To tackle this problem, we
use a bootstrapping strategy. The above described IDA procedure is
carried out in each run of the bootstrapping, and all the results will be
used in the next step for identifying signiﬁcant miRNAimRNA causal
interactions.

2.3 Identifying signiﬁcant miRNA—mRNA interactions

As mentioned previously, to identify condition-speciﬁc miRNA activity,
signiﬁcant miRNAimRNA causal interactions, i.e. those that vary in
their strengths in the condition of interest and the other conditions
should be the focus of the examination. The interactions that do not
change much across different conditions are not unique to the condition
of interest.

To evaluate the signiﬁcance of a miRNAimRNA causal interaction,
we compare its causal effect, ef, calculated in the two different conditions
using a two-sample KS statistic test. The KS test can assess whether the
distribution of ef in the samples of one condition is signiﬁcantly shifted
compared with the distribution in the samples of the other condition. We
choose to use KS test because it has the following advantages: (i) it is non-
parametric and hence does not rely on any assumptions about the distri-
bution of the changes of causal effects; (ii) it does not rely on arbitrary
thresholds; and (iii) it measures signiﬁcant shifts between the entire dis-
tribution rather than just comparing the tails.

Suppose that Fj(ef) = 1172,11 103.5,) is the empirical cumulative distri-
bution function (cab‘) of ef in the two groups of samples, where j e {1, 2},
B is the number of bootstrapping runs and I is the indicator function
whose value is 1 when ef,- 5 ef and 0 otherwise. Then the KS test is the
maximum difference (D) between the two groups of samples in value of
the calfs, i.e. D = .supqu1(ef) — F2(ef)|, where supef is the supremum of the
set of difference.

We use the Matlab function kstestZ to calculate the KS test statistic
and the asymptotic P-value [adjusted by BenjaminiiHochberg (BH)
method] of each miRNAimRNA causal interaction. The miRNAi
mRNA causal interaction with adjusted P<0.05 is regarded as a signiﬁ-
cant miRNAimRNA causal interaction between the two conditions.

In the implementation, before conducting the KS test, for each
miRNAimRNA causal interaction, we check if the mRNA is a predicted
target of the miRNA by using miRNA target binding information, and
the interaction is undergoing the KS test only if the interaction is con-
ﬁrmed by the target binding information.

2.4 Inferring condition-speciﬁc miRNA activity

Generally, a single signiﬁcant miRNAimRNA interaction only shows the
partial activity of the miRNA regarding the condition of interest, as the
miRNA may be involved in multiple signiﬁcant miRNAimRNA inter-
actions. Thus, to obtain a complete picture of the condition-speciﬁc ac-
tivity of an miRNA we need to investigate all the signiﬁcant interactions
in which the miRNA is involved. Note that our deﬁnition of an active
miRNA is speciﬁc to the condition of interest. The overall causal effect
that the active miRNA has on all the mRNAs signiﬁcantly interacting
with it must have changed signiﬁcantly between the condition of interest
and the other condition.

To infer such condition-speciﬁc active miRNAs or their activity,
ﬁrstly, for each identiﬁed signiﬁcant miRNAimRNA causal interaction,
we ﬁnd out the median value of its causal effects calculated during the
B times of bootstrapping, in each condition, respectively.

Then for each miRNA, we examine the difference of the distributions
of the median causal effects of all its associated signiﬁcant causal inter-
actions in the condition of interest and the other condition, using the KS
test. We also use the Matlab function kstestZ to calculate the KS test
statistic and the asymptotic P-value (adjusted by BH method) for the
miRNA. If the adjusted P is <0.05, then this miRNA is regarded as an
active miRNA speciﬁc to the condition of interest.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Data sources and preparation

To demonstrate our method, we apply it to the matched miRNA
and mRNA expression proﬁles from the EMT and MCC
datasets.

The miRNA expression proﬁles of EMT are from Sokilde
et al. (2011) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acccgi?
acc=GSE26375). They were profiled from the 60 cancer cell
lines of the drug screening panel of human cancer cell lines
at the National Cancer Institute (NCI-60). The mRNA

Inferring condition-specific miRNA activity

 

expression profiles of EMT for NCI-60 were obtained
from ArrayExpress (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress, acces-
sion number E-GEOD-5720). Samples of the EMT data categor-
ized as epithelial (11 samples) and mesenchymal (36 samples)
were used for this work.

The miRNA expression proﬁles of MCC were obtained from
Lu et al. (2005) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.
cgi?acc=GSE2564). The mRNA expression proﬁles of MCC
are from Ramaswamy et al. (2001) (http://www.broad.mit.edu/
cancer/pub/migcm). Samples of the MCC data classiﬁed as
normal (21 samples) and tumor (67 samples) were used in this
work.

We perform differential gene expression analysis on the gene
expression proﬁles to identify differentially expressed miRNAs
and mRNAs between the two conditions in each dataset using
the limma package (Smyth, 2005) of Bioconductor. Genes with
>10 missing values are removed. As a result, 46 probes of
miRNAs and 1612 probes of mRNAs for the EMT dataset
and 66 probes of miRNAs and 1318 probes of mRNAs for the
MCC dataset are identiﬁed to be differentially expressed at a
significant level (adjusted P< 0.05, adjusted by BH method).
The detailed results of the differentially expressed miRNAs and
mRNAs are in Supplementary Material 1.

We use the putative miRNA target information in MicroCosm
V5 (Grifﬁths-J ones et al., 2008) as the constraint when identifying
significant miRNAimRNA causal interactions (Fig. 1). Note
that the putative target information is an independent compo-
nent in our method, and any database of miRNA target infor-
mation can be used. We choose MicroCosm to illustrate the
method.

The number of bootstrapping, B, is set to 100.

3.2 Validations by transfection experiment result

In this section, we validate identiﬁed significant miRNAimRNA
interactions using the transfection experimental data from (Khan
et al., 2009), and the data included in the transfection data are
listed in Supplementary Material 2. The 18 unique miRNAs
overlap with 11 and 12 miRNAs in the EMT and MCC datasets,
respectively, which enables the validation of the significant inter-
actions involving these miRNAs. Differentially expressed genes
between the control and miRNA transfected samples are con-
sidered as targets of the miRNA, and are used as the ground
truth to validate the predicted miRNA targets (signiﬁcant
miRNAimRNA interactions). In the transfection experiment,
mRNA differential expression levels are calculated by comparing
mRNA expression levels between transfection and control sam-
ples Via log2 fold change (LFC). The larger the absolute value of
the LFC is, the more signiﬁcant the mRNA differential expres-
sion level is. The commonly used fold change (FC) cutoffs are 1.5
and 2.0 (Dalman et al., 2012), so we use the logarithm of the FC
cutoffs and round them to 0.5 and 1.0 in this work. The follow-
ing validations are done using the differentially expressed genes
(ground truth) obtained with both LFCs, respectively.

3.2.] Validation in comparison with MicroCosm To assess how
well the proposed method enriches the putative miRNA target
information (MicroCosm), we compare the performance of the
method with MicroCosm. For each dataset, we retrieve all the

culate the percentage of confirmed targets. As shown in Figure 2,
our method overall performs better than MicroCosm in most
miRNAs in both datasets. When the LFC cutoff is set to 1.0,
our method also performs better than MicroCosm in terms of the
number of validated targets (see Supplementary Fig. S1 in
Supplementary Material 3). The results suggest that the
method significantly enriches the putative target information
used in the model. We also conceive a cumulative hypergeo-
metric (HG) test to assess the statistical signiﬁcance of the
number of validated miRNAimRNA interactions in our
method. We found that the number of validated miRNAi
mRNA interactions is statistically signiﬁcant (P< 0.05) in both
the EMT and MCC datasets (see Supplementary Table S1 in
Supplementary Material 3 for details).

3.2.2 Validation in comparison with nonicondition-speciﬁc
approach To evaluate the effectiveness of the condition-speciﬁc
approach, we compare the performance of the proposed method
with its nonwondition—speciﬁc variant that does not consider
sample categories. The nonicondition-speciﬁc approach will
not split the dataset into different conditions, and it simply
applies IDA to the whole dataset to enrich the putative target
information.

We extract the top 10 and 20 predicted targets for all the
transfected miRNAs in the EMT and MCC datasets (11 for
EMT and 12 in MCC) and compare the total number of vali-
dated targets for the two approaches. Figure 3 shows that the
proposed condition-speciﬁc approach predicts more conﬁrmed
targets than that by the nonwondition—specific approach in
all cases (Top10-EMT, Top20-EMT, Top10-MCC and Top20-
MCC). When the LFC cutoff in transfection experiments is set to
1.0, the proposed method also performs better than nonicondi-
tion-speciﬁc method in terms of the number of validated targets
(see Supplementary Fig. S2 in Supplementary Material 3).

3.2.3 Validation in comparison with the cases using correlation
methods To show the advantage of causal inference, in this
section, we replace step (2) of our proposed method (see
Section 2.1) with each of the ﬁve correlation methods, Pearson,
Spearman, Kendall, Lasso and Elastic-net (called the correlation

We extract the top 10 and 20 predicted targets for all trans-
fected miRNAs in the EMT and MCC datasets (11 in EMT and
12 in MCC), and compare the total number of validated targets
obtained by different methods. As illustrated in Figure 4, our
method performs better than all the correlation methods in all
cases (Top10-EMT, Top20-EMT, Top10-MCC and Top20-
MCC). When the LFC cutoff is set to 1.0, the proposed
method also outperforms all the five correlation methods in
the number of validated targets (see Supplementary Fig. S3 in

in the EMT and MCC datasets, respectively. The identiﬁed

3.3.1 Causal eﬁ’ects vs. correlations for inferring condition-specific
active miRNAs To show the effectiveness of using causal effects
as the measure of the strength of miRNAimRNA interactions,
we also use the ﬁve correlation methods (Pearson, Spearman,
Kendall, Lasso and Elastic-net) for detecting condition-speciﬁc
miRNA activity. That is, in Step (2) of our method (Section 2.1),
instead of using IDA, we use one of the correlation methods to
compute the strength of an interaction, and the obtained values
instead of casual effects are used in the next two steps.

Because no benchmarks are available, to compare the
performance of each method in inferring condition-speciﬁc
miRNA activity, we use the number of identiﬁed active
miRNAs out of the differentially expressed miRNAs as the
criterion. If a method identiﬁes the largest number of condi-
tion-speciﬁc active miRNAs, the method performs the best. As
shown in Table 1, our method signiﬁcantly outperforms all the
five correlation methods in detecting active miRNAs, suggesting
that causal effect is a useful measure to detect active miRNAs.
The results of condition-speciﬁc miRNA activity using the five
correlation methods are provided in Supplementary Material 5.

3.3.2 Comparing with existing methods in inferring condition-
specific active miRNAs We evaluate the performance of our
method by comparing it with other ﬁve existing methods:
DIANA-mirExTra (Alexiou et al., 2010), Sylamer (van
Dongen et al., 2008), MIR (Cheng and Li, 2008), miReduce
(Sood et al., 2006) and cWords (Rasmussen et al., 2013).
Similarly, an miRNA with P<0.05 is regarded as an active
miRNA. We also use the number of identiﬁed active miRNAs
out of the differentially expressed miRNAs as the criterion. As
illustrated in Table 2, for the EMT dataset, our method is
comparable with cWords and performs better than the other
four existing methods. For the MCC dataset, our method out-
performs all the ﬁve existing methods. The results of condition-
speciﬁc active miRNAs (P<0.05) using the ﬁve existing methods
are provided in Supplementary Material 6.

3.4 Validation of active miRNAs

We use the TAM (Lu et al., 2010) software to conduct the func-
tional analysis of the active miRNAs found by our method.
Signiﬁcant biological functions and associated diseases are iden-
tiﬁed for an active miRNA with the adjusted P—Value (adjusted
by BH method) of 0.05. The analysis of the molecular pathways
that the active miRNAs are potentially involved is performed
with mirPath (V lachos et al., 2012), and TarBase 6.0
(Vergoulis et al., 2012) is regarded as a reference database to
mine signiﬁcantly enriched pathways.

Fig. 5. Functional analysis of active miRNAs. The results are generated
by TAM, and signiﬁcant biological functions and associated diseases are
identiﬁed with a P-value cutoff of 0.05

For the EMT dataset, the 47 samples are closely related to
nine human cancer cell lines, Breast, Cardiovascular Nervous
System, Colon, Leukemia, Lung, Melanoma, Ovarian, Prostate
and Renal. Here, we only discuss EMT in the biological func-
tions and diseases associated with these nine human cancer cell
lines.

As illustrated in Figure 5, 9 of the 18 active miRNAs identiﬁed
using our method are signiﬁcantly associated with EMT, and 11
miRNAs are closely related to Breast Neoplasms. As shown in
Figure 6, of the 18 active miRNAs, most of them are signiﬁcantly
enriched in the top five KEGG pathways, including Pathways in
cancer, Chronic myeloid leukemia, Cell cycle, HTLV-I infection
and Colorectal cancer.

Our method has found a number of literature-conﬁrmed active
miRNAs in EMT, including four members (miR-141, miR-200a,
miR-2000 and miR-429) of the miR-200 family and two members
(miR-192 and miR-215) of the miR-192 family. Previous studies
(Gregory et al., 2008; Mongroo and Rustgi, 2010) have revealed
that members of the miR-200 family play a critical role in the
suppression of EMT, tumor cell adhesion, migration, invasion
and metastasis and may have therapeutic implications for the
treatment of metastatic and drug-resistant tumors. The miR-
200 family and miR-192 family are critical mediators of p53-
regulated EMT (Kim et al., 2011).

The MCC samples are closely associated with 11 human
cancer lines, including Bladder, Breast, Colon, Lung,
Melanoma, Mesothelioma, Ovarian, Pancreas, Prostate, Renal
and Uterus. In the results, of the 41 miRNAs indentiﬁed to be
active between the normal and tumor samples, 20 miRNAs are
shown to be signiﬁcantly associated with miRNA tumor suppres-
sors in Figure 5. Furthermore, many active miRNAs are

Fig. 6. Pathway analysis of active miRNAs. The results are generated by

signiﬁcantly associated with Carcinoma of Renal Cell, Colonic
Neoplasms, Lung Neoplasms, Melanoma, Ovarian Neoplasms,
Pancreatic Neoplasms and Prostatic Neoplasms.

The pathway analysis indicates that more than half of the 41
active miRNAs are signiﬁcantly enriched in the top ﬁve KEGG
pathways including Prostate cancer, Pathways in cancer, Chronic
myeloid leukemia and Bladder cancer, except RNA transport
(Fig. 6).

Our method has also identiﬁed that six members (let-7a, let-
7b, let-7c, let-7d, let-7f and let-7g) of the let-7 family, two mem-
bers (miR-181a and miR-181c) of the miR-181 family and two
members (miR-29a and miR-29c) of the miR-29 family are active
in the process of tumor. Recent research (Boyerinas et al., 2010)
has found out that let-7 and its family members are highly con-
served across species in sequence and function, and misregulation
of the let-7 family leads to a less differentiated cellular state and
the development of cell-based diseases such as cancer. The miR-
181 family has been demonstrated to play an important role in
occurrence and progression of malignant tumors such as lung
cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer and breast cancer
(Zhu et al., 2012). The miR-29 family has also been shown to
be silenced or downregulated in many different types of cancer
and have subsequently been attributed predominantly tumor-
suppressing properties (Schmitt et al., 2013).

3.5 Condition-speciﬁc miRNA activity

To understand the types of regulation of active miRNAs on their
targets in different conditions, we compare the number of posi-
tive and negative effect of each active miRNA on their targets.
With our method, a positive (negative) causal effect indicates
upregulation (downregulation) of the miRNA on its interacting
mRNA. If the number of negative effects of an active miRNA on
its targets is more than that of positive effects on its targets in one
condition, the active miRNA dominantly downregulates its
target genes in the condition, and Vice versa. When an active
miRNA has the same number of negative effects and positive
effects on its targets in a condition, the regulation type of the
active miRNA is uncertain in the condition.

As shown in Table 3, most active miRNAs identiﬁed using our
method (13 of 18) downregulate their target genes in class E
(epithelial), but most active miRNAs (10 of 18) upregulate
their targets in class M (mesenchymal). Most active miRNAs
(11 of 18) have different regulation types between E and M.
For the MCC dataset, most active miRNAs (30 of 41) upregulate

their target genes in class N (normal), but most active miRNAs
(23 of 41) downregulate their targets in class T (tumor). In total,
17 active miRNAs have different regulation types between
N and T.

The results indicate that in each sample condition there is a
dominant regulation type. The results also show that some active
miRNAs behave differently in different conditions in the types of
regulation (up or down), but some active miRNAs have the same
regulation type in different conditions and the difference across
conditions is just the strengths of their regulation. If we only look
at the whole dataset without considering the difference between
conditions, we may miss the interactions in a speciﬁc condition
(e.g. cancer).

4 CONCLU$ONS

miRNAs have been regarded as the main regulators at the post-
transcriptional level. Identifying the targets of miRNAs is a fun-
damental task in predicting miRNA functions. Great efforts
have been made to elucidate miRNA functions and regulatory
mechanism. One stream of the research is focused on miRNA
activity speciﬁc to a condition of interest. However, most of the
studies only use samples obtained in the speciﬁc condition, with-
out examining the difference of miRNA behavior in the speciﬁc
condition and the other conditions, thus the miRNA activity
discovered may not be unique to the specific condition.
Furthermore, most computational methods only use associations
or correlations in predicting miRNAimRNA regulation while
the regulation is in fact causal relationships.

In this study, we have proposed an alternative method to
reveal ‘truly’ condition-speciﬁc miRNA activity with the consid-
eration of the causal semantics of miRNAimRNA relationships.

We have applied our method to the EMT and MCC datasets.
The validation with transfection experiment data illustrates that
our method is more efﬁcient than MicroCosm V5 in identifying
the miRNA targets, and considering the difference across differ-
ent sample conditions improves the number of validated
interactions.

The comparison with ﬁve correlation methods demonstrates
that causal effects provide a better measure than correlations in
modeling the strengths of miRNAimRNA interactions, leading
to more effective discovery of active miRNAs.

As the main aim of the article is to identify condition-speciﬁc
active miRNAs and their activity, we conduct function and

pathway analysis of the active miRNAs detected using our
method. The results have shown that a significant number of
the identiﬁed active miRNAs are closely related to the biological
functions associated with the conditions of samples in the EMT
and MCC datasets, and play a Vital role in the potential patho-
genesis of complex diseases. Furthermore, to understand the
activity of the active miRNAs, we investigate how these
miRNAs behave differently in different conditions. It was
found out that some active miRNAs show different regulation
types in different conditions and some active miRNAs have the
same regulation types and their activity only differs in different
conditions in terms of the strengths of regulation.

In conclusion, the validation and analysis results indicate that
the proposed method can be an effective method to detect con-
dition-speciﬁc miRNA activity.

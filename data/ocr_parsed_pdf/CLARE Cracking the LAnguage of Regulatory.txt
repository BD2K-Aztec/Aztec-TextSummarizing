ABSTRACT

Summary: CLARE is a computational method designed to reveal
sequence encryption of tissue-specific regulatory elements. Starting
with a set of regulatory elements known to be active in a particular
tissue/process, it learns the sequence code of the input set and
builds a predictive model from features specific to those elements.
The resulting model can then be applied to user-supplied genomic
regions to identify novel candidate regulatory elements. CLARE’s
model also provides a detailed analysis of transcription factors that
most likely bind to the elements, making it an invaluable tool for
understanding mechanisms of tissue-specific gene regulation.

1 INTRODUCTION

Gene regulatory elements play a primary role in transcriptional
regulation, a process required for the proper execution of various
genetic programs. Proteins called transcription factors (TFs)
recognize and bind speciﬁc regulatory elements on the DNA, leading
to the activation or repression of a target gene. Identiﬁcation of these
regulatory elements is therefore important for understanding the
regulatory mechanisms involved in the development and functioning
of an organism. Experimental approaches such as ChIP-Seq or ChIP-
chip can help identify regulatory elements on a genome-wide scale
by proﬁling a TF of interest or a coactivator like p300 or CBP that
colocalizes with active enhancers (Heintzman et (11., 2009; Visel
et al., 2009). However, these methods are restricted by the number
of TFs that can be proﬁled, the efﬁcacy of antibodies, experimental
noise, and the number of cell types that can be tested. Furthermore,
these methods are usually unable to identify regulatory regions
bound by an unknown TF. As a result, computational methods for
identifying TF-binding sites and regulatory elements are rapidly
gaining ground [see Su et al. (2010) for a review]. Few tools,
however, are easily accessible online and convenient for molecular
biologists who are not interested in getting through the hurdles
of installing and maintaining software. Here, we present CLARE
(Cracking the LAnguage of Regulatory Elements), a web interface

for the method that we recently developed to predict regulatory
elements active in a speciﬁc tissue or biological process (Narlikar
et (11., 2010). CLARE is written in Perl and runs on a Linux
platform. Our computational method has been shown to identify
mammalian heart enhancers with validation rates similar to those
obtained with ChIP-Seq experiments (Blow et (11., 2010). CLARE
is freely accessible online at http://clare.dcode.org.

2 SYSTEM OVERVIEW

Regulatory elements active in a particular tissue or biological
process are likely to be bound by a common set of TFs; by either
activators (in case of enhancers and promoters) or repressors (in case
of silencers) present in the nucleus. Consequently, binding sites of
these TFs should be statistically overrepresented in bound regulatory
elements. CLARE exploits this notion in a model that describes
regulatory elements based on a weighted linear combination of TF-
binding sites. Figure 1 illustrates the workﬂow of the CLARE web
server.

2.1 CLARE input

The only input required from the user is a set of sequences of
regulatory elements in FASTA format. Optionally, the user can also
enter a set of sequences to serve as controls and a query sequence
to search for putative regulatory elements.

2.2 Modeling regulatory elements
CLARE proceeds in three main steps:

2.2.1 Creating a control set In absence of a user-supplied control
set, CLARE will construct one that is length- and GC-balanced with
respect to the input set of regulatory elements. This ensures that
CLARE does not train purely on the GC content that is, in general,
different between non-ﬁlnctional regions and ﬁlnctional regions. The
server-side control set is sampled from the non-coding portion of the
human genome.

2.2.2 Feature mapping Each sequence from the input and control
sets undergoes a transformation into a feature vector, with features
describing the occurrence of putative TF-binding sites. For this
purpose, each sequence is scanned using thearch [(Ovcharenko
et al., 2005), see Supplementary Materials] with known motifs
from the TRANSFAC (Matys et al., 2006), JASPAR (Bryne et al.,
2008) and UniPROBE (Robasky and Bulyk, 2011) databases as
well as the top 10 overrepresented motifs among the regulatory

elements discovered de novo using a Gibbs sampler [implemented
in PRIORITY (Narlikar et al., 2007)].

2.2.3 Model training The problem of separating known
regulatory elements from background sequence is posed in the form
of linear regression, with the goal of learning the weight of each
feature. CLARE uses LASSO (Tibshirani, 1996) that returns an L1-
regularized solution to the problem. This ensures a small number
of weights have a non-zero weight, the assumption being that most
motifs are not part of the biological process under consideration,
and are therefore irrelevant for classiﬁcation.

2.3 CLARE output

After the job is completed, results are reported in a web-based table.
CLARE provides three primary outputs:

2.3.1 Relevant features CLARE returns a bar graph displaying
the weights of the features that are ﬁnally selected. A large positive
(negative) weight implies that the respective feature is positively
(negatively) correlated with the input set and negatively (positively)
correlated with the control set.

2.3.2 Classiﬁer performance The classiﬁer performance is
assessed by 5-fold cross-validation. The average receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under it are reported.

2.3.3 Predictions CLARE returns a score for each of the
candidate regions supplied by the user, indicating the likelihood of
the sequence being a regulatory element.

A basic protocol for the utilization of CLARE is given in the
Supplementary Materials. A typical CLARE job for input sets with
up to a few hundred sequences is completed in <30 min. However,
the run-time of CLARE is highly dependent on the number and
size of input sets, and can run into hours for sets on the order 1000
sequences (Supplementary Materials). This is primarily due to the
de novo motif discovery and LASSO.

3 CASE STUDY: ENHANCERS REGULATING
FOREBRAIN EXPRESSION

As a test case, we used CLARE to predict sequences with forebrain
enhancer activity in the human genome. The model was trained
with 49 human sequences that were validated for forebrain enhancer
activity in transgenic mouse assays (Visel et al., 2009). The classiﬁer

achieved an area under the ROC curve of 0.83, suggesting it
can effectively distinguish forebrain enhancers from background
sequences. The training sequences were extracted from a larger
dataset comprising 2453 p300 ChIP-Seq predictions in the genome
of developing mouse embryos. After mapping the mouse peaks
to the human genome, we selected a 2Mb region in the human
genome with the largest amount of p300 ChIP-Seq peaks for
enhancer prediction. This region, on chromosome 5, encompasses
the gene ZNF608, which is associated with Cornelia de Lange
Syndrome (Liu et al., 2009), characterized by slow growth before
and after birth, intellectual disability and skeletal abnormalities.
Thirteen-percent of the windows evaluated in this locus scored
positively, comprising regions overlapping with all ChIP-Seq peaks
(Supplementary Materials). These predictions also show signiﬁcant
overlap with regions conserved in chicken and mouse, with fold-
enrichments of 2.4 and 1.5, respectively (P <0.05), suggesting that
they are functional and may therefore have clinical relevance (Loots
and Ovcharenko, 2007). The datasets and results are available online
at: http://clare.dcode.org/index.php?id=example.

4 CONCLUSIONS

CLARE is a novel web server, capable of predicting regulatory
elements and ﬁlnctional TF-binding sites starting from a collection
of known regulatory sequences. Detailed advantages of CLARE
are listed in the Supplementary Materials. Brieﬂy, this tool can
aid in prioritizing genomic regions and TF-binding sites for
further experimental validation. Ultimately, this should improve the
functional annotation of the non-coding portion of the genome, and
our understanding of the mechanisms controlling gene regulation in
eukaryotes.

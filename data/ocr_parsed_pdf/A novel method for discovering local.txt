Abstract

Motivation: The three—dimensional structure of genomes makes it possible for genomic regions
not adjacent in the primary sequence to be spatially proximal. These DNA contacts have been
found to be related to various molecular activities. Previous methods for analyzing DNA contact
maps obtained from Hi—C experiments have largely focused on studying individual interactions,
forming spatial clusters composed of contiguous blocks of genomic locations, or classifying these
clusters into general categories based on some global properties of the contact maps.

Results: Here, we describe a novel computational method that can flexibly identify small clusters
of spatially proximal genomic regions based on their local contact patterns. Using simulated data
that highly resemble Hi—C data obtained from real genome structures, we demonstrate that our
method identifies spatial clusters that are more compact than methods previously used for cluster—
ing genomic regions based on DNA contact maps. The clusters identified by our method enable us
to confirm functionally related genomic regions previously reported to be spatially proximal in dif—
ferent species. We further show that each genomic region can be assigned a numeric affinity value
that indicates its degree of participation in each local cluster, and these affinity values correlate
quantitatively with DNase I hypersensitivity, gene expression, super enhancer activities and repli—
cation timing in a cell type specific manner. We also show that these cluster affinity values can pre—
cisely define boundaries of reported topologically associating domains, and further define local
sub—domains within each domain.

1 Introduction

 

Although genomes are commonly depicted as a linear sequence of
base pairs, they actually contain complex three—dimensional (3D)
structures. There has long been an interest in identifying biologically
meaningful territories from these structures (Cremer and Cremer,
2010). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has provided in—
sights into genome organization by visualizing individual pairs of
spatially interacting genomic regions (Cremer and Cremer, 2001),
but it has limited resolution and cannot be scaled up to study a large

number of interacting regions at the same time. These limitations
have been overcome by high—throughput experimental methods that
can probe interacting regions genome—Wide by means of cross—
linking and deep sequencing, such as ChIA—PET, Hi—C and TCC
(Fullwood et (11., 2009; Kalhor et (11., 2012; Lieberman—Aiden et (11.,
2009). Each sequencing read produced provides information about
two interacting regions. The Whole set of reads is summarized by a
contact map in the form of a square matrix, Where the Whole gen—
ome is binned into contiguous genomic locations with each bin

corresponding to a row and a column of the matrix, and each matrix
element represents the number of supporting reads linking up re—
gions from the two respective bins, which we refer to as the ‘contact
counts’ (Supplementary Fig. S1). Two bins that are closer to each
other in the 3D genome structures in a cell population receive a
larger contact count in general, subject to various types of bias to be
discussed below.

The appropriate size of each bin depends on the amount of data
produced. If a small bin size is used but there are not enough
sequencing reads, many values in the matrix would be small or even
zero, and would thus be heavily affected by background noise and
random sampling effects. Therefore, in order to produce contact
maps at high resolution, the amount of data produced in each ex—
periment has been increasing rapidly (Ay et (11., 2014; Dixon et (11.,
2012; Jin et (11., 2013; Kalhor et (11., 2012; Lieberman—Aiden et (11.,
2009). A recent in situ Hi—C dataset contains billions of pairwise
interactions obtained from a human cell line, which allows for a
high resolution of 1 kb bin size while the average contact count is
still sufficiently large for proper analyses (Rao et (11., 2014). These
massive datasets have created computational challenges in extract—
ing useful information about the underlying 3D genome structures.

Various methods have been applied to analyze DNA contact
maps with different goals. Statistical methods have been used to test
whether a set of genomic locations of interest are co—localized in the
3D genome structure (Duan et (11., 2010). Their reliability depend on
the normalization procedure (Cournac et (11., 2012) and the suitabil—
ity of the null model (Paulsen et (11., 2013). Conversely, methods
have been proposed for discovering groups of interacting genomic
regions without a predefined set of candidates. One way is to create
a global model for the whole 3D genome structure using the contact
map to define model constraints. Existing methods differ from each
other by their assumptions about global genome structures, their op—
timization procedures, and whether a single structure or a popula—
tion of structures is used to explain the observed contact map (Duan
et (11., 2010; Kalhor et (11., 2012; Lieberman—Aiden et (11., 2009;
Nagano et (11., 2013; Sexton et (11., 2012). Another way to identify
groups of interacting regions is to cluster genomic regions according
to their contact counts with other regions. One previous study used
principle component analysis (PCA) to identify a low—dimensional
representation of the contact map based on which genomic regions
were clustered. The clustering results revealed general open and
close compartments of the genome at 1 Mb resolution (Lieberman—
Aiden et (11., 2009). More refined topologically associating domains
(TADs) (Dixon et (11., 2012; Nora et (11., 2012) at 100 kb resolution
were later identified by using hidden Markov models. Recently,
chromatin loops at even higher resolutions were identified using dy—
namic programming. Clustering of the inter—chromosomal inter—
actions revealed six general groups using a Gaussian hidden Markov
model clustering algorithm (Rao et (11., 2014).

In general, the accuracy of these methods depends on how the
contact map is processed to remove biases. Some genomic regions
tend to have more contact counts than others, caused by factors
such as GC content and uniqueness of sequence (Yaffe and Tanay,
2011). These factors lead to a non—uniform distribution of contact
read counts, which could confuse the analysis and should be prop—
erly corrected. In an early correction method, the observed contact
counts are normalized by the expected counts based on a back—
ground model (Lieberman—Aiden et (11., 2009). An iterative correc—
tion approach was later proposed to enforce equal sums for all rows
in the contact map after normalization, assuming that after remov—
ing the biases, every bin should have approximately the same num—
ber of interactions with other bins. This normalization method was

proved to be more effective and have a better convergence property
(Imakaev et (11., 2012). Using the same framework, another effective
normalization method adopts a new updating rule by dividing row
sums with their Euclidean norms (Cournac et (11., 2012). Yaffe and
Tanay’s work followed a different direction by explicitly modeling
three types of biases observed in Hi—C data (Yaffe and Tanay,
2011). This method was further sped up by relaxing the objective
function (Hu et (11., 2012). In the recent high resolution study, a
faster iterative approach based on matrix balancing was used to
achieve the assumption of equal row sums (Knight and Ruiz, 2013;
Rao et (11., 2014).

Together, these data correction and analysis methods have led to
many interesting findings about genome structures. On the other
hand, so far most analyses have focused on either individual inter—
actions, domains composed of a contiguous segment on the primary
sequence, or grouping of these domains into general domain catego—
ries based on some global properties of the contact map. Given the
complexity of genome structures, it would be useful to have a way
to ﬂexibly identify local clusters of genomic regions that are spa—
tially close in the 3D structure but not necessarily adjacent in the pri—
mary sequence, such as multiple non—adjacent TADs that form a
higher—level spatial cluster. As to be shown in the Results section,
many of these local clusters are related to particular molecular activ—
ities such as transcription and DNA replication. Compared to the
domains identified in previous studies, these local clusters could pro—
vide information about local organizations of the genome structure
involving small subsets of genomic regions that are particularly
related to each other within larger domains, thereby supplementing
the previous methods.

In this study, our main goal is to identify these local clusters
from contact maps obtained from Hi—C experiments using matrix
factorization. In general, matrix factorization aims at decomposing
a matrix into two or more matrices with a certain objective. One of
the most well—known methods is eigenvalue decomposition, which
decomposes a diagonalizable square matrix X into QAQ‘I, where
Q contains the orthogonal eigenvectors and A is a diagonal matrix
containing the eigenvalues. A popular application of it is principal
component analysis, which uses eigenvalue decomposition to factor—
ize the covariance matrix of a dataset. Each eigenvector (i.e. a prin—
cipal component, PC) represents the direction with the largest data
variance after subtracting out the projections on the previous PCs
with larger eigenvalues. PCA has been used to identify key contribu—
ting factors of Hi—C contact maps (Lieberman—Aiden et (11., 2009).
Since each bin could have a negative coordinate along a PC, the bio—
logical meanings of the PCs are sometimes difficult to interpret. In
one of the studies, permutation tests have also indicated that only
the first few PCs were statistically significant (Imakaev et (11., 2012).

Conceptually, a perfect DNA contact map can be considered as
the superposition of contact counts from different local clusters and
a small number of counts linking different clusters. For example, the
contact map submatrix shown in Supplementary Figure S1 can be
well approximated by read counts within the first local cluster (con—
sisting of bins a, b and c) and read counts within the second local
cluster (consisting of bins d and e). Each bin can have an affinity
value indicating its participation in each local cluster, and bins at
the interface of multiple clusters (bins c and d) can have partial affin—
ities to these clusters. When only the contact counts between differ—
ent bins are available but not the 3D coordinates of each bin in the
genome structure, these local clusters can be identified by non—
negative matrix factorization (NMF), which decomposes the data
matrix into matrices containing only non—negative values
(Devarajan, 2008). For a DNA contact map, after considering some

global effects due to general open and close domains or chromosome
structures, the remaining factors could correspond well to the local
clusters. Comparing with analyzing DNA contact maps with PCA,
NMF enjoys the advantages of (i) having clear biological interpret—
ations for many factors, (ii) allowing only positive coefficients (i.e.
the affinity values) and (iii) focusing more on local sub—structures. In
fact, NMF was popularized by Lee and Seung’s work on image pro—
cessing (Lee and Seung, 1999), which clearly demonstrated that
each image of human face can be automatically factorized by NMF
into distinct facial features, such as the nose, the mouth and so on.
NMF has also been shown effective in many biological applications
such as analyzing protein—protein interactions (Greene et (11., 2008).

As discussed, DNA contact maps contain various types of bias
that should be properly corrected before applying NMF. Here, we
propose a novel method called balanced non—negative matrix fac—
torization (BNMF), which was specially designed for DNA contact
maps to handle data biases and relationships between data bins in
the primary sequence when performing NMF. We show that
BNMF can identify compact spatial clusters of genomic regions ac—
cording to simulated data that highly resemble real Hi—C data. The
clusters were identified without making any assumptions about the
whole genome structure. They are found to contain genomic re—
gions closer to each other than those identified by some other clus—
tering methods previously used to analyze Hi—C data. We further
describe how statistical tests can be performed to check whether a
group of genomic regions of interest are spatially close to each
other in the 3D genome structure based on the clusters identified
by BNMF. We use this testing procedure to confirm that various
functionally related groups of genomic regions are spatially close
to each other. We then show that the BNMF clusters are not only
good indicators of particular groups of functionally related gen—
omic regions, but their affinity values are actually quantitatively
correlated with various molecular activities. Finally, we show that
BNMF cluster affinities can precisely define boundaries of TAD,
and provide more fine—grained information about sub—domains
within these large domains.

2 Results

2.1 BNMF identifies local spatial clusters from DNA
contact maps

BNMF takes a contact map X as input, and finds an approximation
Y of it that can be decomposed into the product of several matrices:

x z Y : BHSHTB,

where B is a diagonal matrix that captures the position—specific con—
tact count biases, S is a diagonal matrix that defines the clusters, and
H contains the cluster membership values (Fig. 1). B, S and H all
contain only non—negative values. To understand this formula, first
we define a new matrix R as follow:

R :: B‘lYB‘l : HSHT

R is a balanced contact map required to have equal sums for all
rows and equal sums for all columns except for those bins with no
contact counts in the original contact map X. BNMF then looks for
non—negative matrices H and S such that R : HSHT. This decom—
position does not have a unique solution. For instance, if every elem—
ent in H is multiplied by a positive value and each element in S is
divided by the square of that value, HSHT would stay unchanged.
To make the decomposition result easy to interpret, we require each

column of H to sum to a given constant, and correspondingly each
column of W : SHT to sum to another constant (Fig. 1). With this
constraint, each column of H contains the memberships of different
bins to a cluster when each cluster has a fixed membership quota for
all the bins, and each column of W contains the affinity of a bin to
join the different clusters when each bin has a fixed affinity budget
for all the clusters.

To illustrate the decomposition procedure, consider the follow—
ing raw contact map:

8 4 0
X : 4 2 0
0 0 9

In this idealized example, we can find Y that is identical to X.

The position—specific biases can be removed by the bias matrix B:

R : B‘lYB‘l : B‘lXB‘l

and Wsums to 1:

From matrix S, the two diagonal entries state that there are

two clusters, with two members belonging to the first and one
member to the second. From matrix H, the first cluster assigns 0.5
membership to bin 1 and 0.5 membership to bin 2, and the second
cluster assigns 1 membership to bin 3. From matrix W, bins 1 and
2 both have full affinity to cluster 1 and bin 3 has full affinity to
cluster 2.

We developed an algorithm that searches for B, S and H at the
same time given an input contact map X. This algorithm also uses
the location of the bins in the primary sequence to define a manifold
component in the objective function, such that the resulting affinity
values are smooth (Section 4, Supplementary Fig. S2).

When applying BNMF to a published yeast Hi—C contact map
(Duan et (11., 2010), the identified clusters contain adjacent bins in
the primary sequence, as evidenced by blocks of large values in each
row of W (Fig. 1); On the other hand, there are also clusters with
member bins not adjacent in the primary sequence but have high
contact counts between them, seen as off—diagonal blocks. Overall,
when all clusters are considered, the approximated contact map Y is
highly similar to the raw contact map X.

An important parameter of BNMF is the number of clusters to
form, which is equal to the number of rows in matrix S. We have de—
veloped an automatic procedure to search for an appropriate num—
ber of clusters such that each cluster is sufficiently homogeneous but
not too fragmented (Section 4).

Fig. 1. Summary of the BNMF method. The Hi-C contact map based on Hindlll interactions at 1% FDR from Duan er al. (2010) is used as the input contact map X.
The goal of BNMF is to find a matrix Ythat can be decomposed into the product of several matrices and is close to X. Ycontains similar position-specific biases
as X, as shown by the column sums below the heat maps. These biases can be captured by a bias matrix B. When these biases are removed from Y, we get a bal-
anced contact map R. R is in turn decomposed into HSHT, where Sdefines the local spatial clusters and Hcontains the membership values that associate the bins

to the clusters

2.2 BNMF produces spatial clusters more compact than
other clustering methods

We used two methods to test whether BNMF produces clusters that
contain spatially proximal genomic regions. In the first method, we
used a space—filling Hilbert curve to draw an artificial 2D chromo—
some in a 16 X 16 area. Each of the 256 points mimics a bin of con—
secutive genomic locations. We then generated an idealized
synthetic contact map by assigning % contact counts between
any two points at a Euclidean distance of d in the 2D structure not
necessarily adjacent in the 1D sequence, where dmax is the maximum
Euclidean distance between any two points on the curve. The reason
for having contact counts inversely proportional to d2 in this 2D

chromosome is based on previous work of the 3D case in which con—
tact counts are inversely proportional to d3 due to the volume in 3D
space (Varoquaux et 41]., 2014). We next decomposed the matrix
using eigenvalue decomposition (EIG) and BNMF, respectively. For
EIG, we formed four clusters of points that have coefficients larger
than the corresponding means along the first four eigenvectors. For
BNMF, we formed four clusters comprising points with an affinity
value larger than the mean.

Figure 2 shows the resulting clusters produced by the two meth—
ods. For EIG, the first cluster separates the interior and exterior of
the structure. The second and third clusters separate points at differ—
ent sides of the whole area. In order to be orthogonal to the first

Fig. 2. Comparison between eigenvalue decomposition and BNMF based on
a space-filling curve. A Hilbert curve is used to generate an artificial 2D
chromosome and a corresponding synthetic contact map. The contact map is
decomposed by eigenvalue decomposition (EIG) and BNMF. In both cases,
four clusters are obtained by grouping the points with the highest coefficients
along the eigenvectors or affinity values to the clusters. A region with long-
range contacts, including points 22 and 235, is highlighted in the Hilbert
curve, the heat map and cluster 4 produced by BNMF

three eigenvectors, the fourth eigenvector results in a cluster that in—
volves two isolated parts of the structure. The four clusters overlap
each other substantially and are all based on some global data prop—
erties. In contrast, the clusters formed by BNMF clearly correspond
to spatial clusters at the four corners. These clusters include points
that are spatially close in the structure but not adjacent in the pri—
mary sequence. For example, points 22 and 235 are far away in the
primary sequence, but due to their spatial locality, they have a high
contact count, and are grouped into the same cluster. Similar results
could also be obtained from a 3D Hilbert curve. While BNMF is not
intended for identifying global compartments as was done in some
previous studies (Lieberman—Aiden et (11., 2009), this example clearly
illustrates how BNMF identifies spatial clusters.

In the second method, we generated a noisy synthetic yeast Hi—C
contact map with position—specific biases, and used it to compare
different clustering methods (Section 4). A volume exclusion model
was previously proposed for generating a population of simulated
3D structures of the yeast genome, which was shown to produce a
contact map similar to one obtained from real data (Tjong et (11.,
2012). We used this model to generate 3000 simulated yeast genome
structures at 3.2 kb resolution. The resulting contact map has data
patterns highly similar to a real contact map at 32 kb resolution
(Supplementary Fig. S3a,b). The average Pearson correlation be—
tween the rows in the two matrices is larger than 0.9
(Supplementary Fig. S3e). When we decomposed these two matrices
using BNMF, the cluster affinity values were highly similar
(Supplementary Fig. S3c,d), with clear correspondence between
most clusters obtained from the two maps (Supplementary Fig. S3f).
Having this highly realistic synthetic contact map, we used it to
check whether the bins grouped into the same cluster by BNMF are
spatially close, based on the known average distance between any
two bins in the 3000 simulated structures.

In addition to BNMF, we also applied four other methods to pro—
duce clusters from the noisy synthetic contact map. The first method
is PCA with a normalization step for removing position biases
(Lieberman—Aiden et (11., 2009), in which case each PC was used to
define a cluster (see below). The second method is Iterative
Correction and Eigenvalue Decomposition (ICE) (Imakaev et (11.,

2012), which uses an iterative procedure to remove biases in the con—
tact map before applying eigenvalue decomposition. The third
method is the standard k—means clustering method (MacQueen,
1967), in which case each row vector was used as the features of the
corresponding bin. The fourth method is standard NMF without cor—
recting for the biases. We required all methods to produce the same
number of clusters, with each bin assigned to exactly one cluster.

Figure 3a shows the synthetic contact map and Figure 3b shows
the corresponding pairwise Euclidean distances between the bins
based on the actual synthetic structures. The centromeres of the dif—
ferent chromosomes are in general close to each other as previously
reported in whole—genome models (Duan et (11., 2010). For each clus—
ter, we computed the average distance between the member bins
(Fig. 3c). For most cluster numbers, the clusters identified by BNMF
were the tightest. We found that some methods tended to put only
bins from the same chromosome in the same cluster. If we focused
on only bin pairs from the same chromosome, the average distances
were again smallest for BNMF (Fig. 3d).

Since BNMF uses an iterative optimization procedure, we
checked how the objective score and the average Euclidean distance
between bins assigned to the same cluster change across the iter—
ations. Supplementary Figure S4 shows that the objective score
decreased progressively across iterations as expected.
Correspondingly, the average distance between the bins in the same
cluster also decreased, and it had a good correlation with the object—
ive score, suggesting that the objective function is a good indicator
of intra—cluster bin distances in DNA contact maps.

Taking the results of both analyses together, the clusters identi—
fied by BNMF are shown to represent compact groups of genomic
bins coming from spatially proximal regions.

2.3 BNMF confirms spatial locality of functionally
related genomic regions

As an application of BNMF, we developed statistical tests for check—
ing whether a given set of genomic regions are spatially proximal
using the clusters identified by BNMF (Section 4). The basic idea is
that if a set of genomic regions are spatially close, they would have
large affinity values to a cluster simultaneously. The affinity values
to this cluster can thus well separate bins belonging to this group of

genomic regions from other bins. Our testing procedure performs
this analysis for every cluster, and reports a P—value corrected for
multiple hypothesis testing. One major difference between our test—
ing procedure and the ones used in previous studies is that we use
cluster affinity values to check the spatial locality of the bins of
interest while most previous methods use contact counts directly. If
a set of genomic regions of interest simultaneously have a high affin—
ity to a cluster, other genomic regions with a high affinity to this
cluster are also spatially co—localized with the regions of interest,
thus providing a simple way to discover new spatial relationships.
To check the effectiveness of our testing procedure, we applied it
to check the co—localization of previously reported groups of gen—
omic regions, including early replication sites in yeast (Imakaev
et al., 2012), VRSM genes in the parasite Plasmodium falciparum
(Ay et al., 2014) and tRNA genes in human, mouse and yeast (Duan
et al., 2010). Table 1 shows the resulting P—values. All these three
previously reported functional groups were found to contain bins
that could be well distinguished from other bins based on the cluster
affinity values of BNMF. As a control, we also applied the testing
procedure on late replication sites, which are not expected to be co—
localized. Indeed, the resulting P—value was not significant. These re—
sults demonstrate BNMF’s ability to test the spatial locality of

Several groups of functionally related genomic regions previously reported
to be spatially proximal were re—tested for their spatial co—localization using
BNMF cluster afﬁnity values based on the CCD method. Late replication
sites, which are not expected to be co-localized in the 3D genome structure,
were used as a control.

functionally related genomic regions, and its general applicability to
data from different species.

2.4 BNMF cluster affinities quantitatively correlate with
genomic features in a cell type specific manner

For functionally related regions, if their activities differ in different
cell types, their spatial locality may also change accordingly. To test
if such cell type specific structural information is captured by the
BNMF clusters, we collected Hi—C data from four human cell lines
and used BNMF to identify local spatial clusters from them. We also
collected cell type specific experimental data that indicate various
molecular activities, including genes with cell type specific expres—
sion, locations of super enhancers, DNase I hypersensitivity values
and replication time (Section 4). The first two types of data identify
genomic regions belonging to these categories, and we used the same
statistical procedure described in the last section to test the spatial
locality of these bins. The last two types of data provide numeric
values for each bin across the whole genome. We used a modified
testing procedure to check if these values were quantitatively corre—
lated with cluster affinity values.

Table 2 shows the analysis results. In 61 of these 64 cases, the
correlation between the cluster affinity values and the genomic fea—
tures is statistically significant, except for the three cases involving
highly expressed genes in K562 and local clusters from other cell
lines, indicating that genomic regions defined by these features are
in general close to each other regardless of their activities. On the
other hand, in many cases the highest correlations (in terms of AUC
or SPC, defined in Section 4) are observed when both the DNA con—
tact map and the genomic feature were obtained from the same cell
type. For example, the genes specifically expressed in a cell type ap—
pear to be most structurally proximal in the same cell type. The re—
sults for DNase I hypersensitivity and replication time further show
that the BNMF cluster affinity values not only can help identify the
local clusters related to particular genomic features, but also quanti—
tatively reﬂect the activity level of some features. These results indi—
cate that cell type specific structural changes related to differential
molecular activities are captured by the BNMF clusters.

showing a BNMF cluster with almost the same boundaries with a TAD, but

2.5 Local clusters identified by BNMF are consistent
with and supplement topologically associating domains
Previous work has identified topologically associating domains
(TADs), consecutive blocks of DNA locations that define structural
domains (Dixon et al., 2012; Nora et al., 2012). We investigated
how the clusters identified by BNMF are related to TADs.

We first reasoned that if TADs mark structural domains, the
boundaries of some TADs should also be boundaries of BNMF clus—
ters. We identified BNMF cluster boundaries by checking the affin—
ity values of the bins. Bins at cluster boundaries have affinities to
multiple clusters, and thus their vectors of cluster affinities have a
higher Gini impurity index (Section 4). When plotting all these Gini
impurity values from a contact map from the human IMR90 cell
line, a clear enrichment is seen around TAD boundaries (Fig. 4a). In
general, there is substantial overlap between TAD and BNMF clus—
ter boundaries (Supplementary Fig. S5a).

By inspecting individual TADs, we found that in some simple
cases each TAD corresponds to exactly one BNMF cluster (Fig. 4b).
In some more complex cases, one TAD contains multiple BNMF
clusters, and long—range contacts across TADs are captured by the
BNMF affinity values and appear as small distal peaks (Fig. 4c,
Arrows 1 and 2, Supplementary Fig. S5 b). Alternatively, some
BNMF clusters span multiple TADs, suggesting the spatial proxim—
ity between them as indicated by the contact map (Fig. 4c, green
cluster, Supplementary Fig. S5c).

One feature of BNMF is that it can identify clusters at different
resolution by decomposing contact maps at different bin sizes and/
or setting different number of clusters. We demonstrate this feature
by extracting the balanced contact map of a segment (from 53 to 56
Mb) of chromosome 12 from the human K5 62 cell line at 5 kb reso—
lution (Rao et al., 2014), and using BNMF to produce local spatial
clusters. There was a recent study using a novel DNase Hi—C method
to study the 3D genome structures around long intergenic noncoding
RNAs of human cell lines (Ma et al., 2015). Two distal regions were
clearly observed to have interactions with the promoter of the
HOTAIR gene, one of which is also supported by ChIA—PET (Fig.

4d). We checked the BNMF clusters around this genomic locus, and
found a cluster with almost identical boundaries with a surrounding
TAD. The two distal interacting regions have strong enrichment in
the affinity values of this cluster as compared to other regions within
the TAD, showing that BNMF identified these two distal regions
and the HOTAIR gene to be particularly close among all the bins in
this TAD.

These results suggest that the BNMF clusters are consistent with
TADs, but also provide additional information about more detailed
interactions within a single TAD and across multiple TADs.

3 Discussion and conclusion

In this paper, we have described the BNMF method for decompos—
ing a contact map and identifying local spatial clusters from it. We
have used synthetic contact maps based on both an artificial space—
filling chromosome and simulated yeast genome structures that re—
semble real yeast genome structures to show that the clusters identi—
fied by BNMF correspond to compact clusters of genomic regions
proximal in the 3D genome structure. Genomic regions in the same
spatial clusters are usually, but not necessarily, close to each other in
the primary sequence. Comparisons with other clustering methods
showed that the clusters produced by BNMF are more compact.
This is partially attributed to the non—negative requirements for the
decomposing matrices, which naturally attempts to explain the over—
all contact map by the summation of contact counts from different
local clusters. In contrast, if the decomposing matrices allow nega—
tive values, as in eigenvalue decomposition, the resulting clusters
may not correspond to local spatial clusters and their meanings
could be difficult to interpret.

Since BNMF does not require any prior knowledge about the
overall genome structure and does not make any assumptions about
it, the identified clusters are based purely on the contact map data
and could contain novel groups of genomic regions. We have shown
that BNMF can be applied to data obtained from a variety of
species.

One could also apply BNMF to the same contact map at differ—
ent bin sizes, to identify spatial clusters at different resolution.
Currently one limitation of BNMF is that when the input contact
map is too large, the computation involved in the decomposition
could be prohibitive due to expensive matrix multiplications. One
way to deal with this problem is to extract a subset of the contact
map of interest, such as one chromosome, and apply BNMF on this
subset only. When we used this strategy to study the sub—contact
map around the HOTAIR gene at 5 kb resolution, we were able to
identify the enhancer—promoter interactions around the HOTAIR
gene within a larger TAD. Some other technical methods for speed—
ing up the calculations are discussed in the Supplementary
Materials.

4 Materials and Methods

4.1 Formulation of balanced non—negative matrix
factorization, BNMF

Given a DNA contact map X, the BNMF method looks for positive
matrix B and non—negative matrices H and S such that
X z BHSHTB. This searching process requires an objective function
to evaluate how similar the reconstructed matrix BHSHTB and the
input matrix X are, and an algorithm for finding matrices B, H and
S that result in a good objective score. Here, we provide the details
of these two components of BNMF.

4.1.1 Defining the basic objective function

We begin with the simplified problem of decomposing X into
HSHT, assuming X is bias free. Later we will explain how the
bias matrix B can be identified to remove position—specific biases
in X.

Let W :: SHT be a non—negative matrix. In order to approxi—
mate X by H W, we assume that X is produced by adding Poisson
noise to H W. Maximizing the data likelihood is related to minimiz—
ing the Kullback—Leibler (KL) divergence between X and H W (Lee
and Seung, 1999) defined as follows:

ill

d(X1 IHW) : Z (xﬁrnm — Xi,- + (HW),,>
: Z [(HW)i/' — Xii1n(HW)ijj ‘I' Z IXiiInXii _ Xiil
ill" ill"
Since only the first term varies with H W, minimizing the KL di—
vergence is equivalent to minimizing the following objective
function:

rpm- : Z [<HW>.-,- — Xii1n<HW>.-,-I
ii
We also add to the objective function a manifold component,
such that bins adjacent to each other in the primary sequence are
more likely to have similar cluster membership values. The details
are given in Section S1.1.1.

4.1.2 Algorithm for solving X = HW
For the optimization problem based on the basic objective function
lpoi with non—negative constraints on H and W, locally optimal solu—
tions can be found by the Multiplicative Update Rules (MUR) (Lee
and Seung, 1999). These rules are obtained by gradient descent.

The partial derivative of the objective function jpoi with respect
to any element Hg), in H is

BIPoi : Z 6(HW)17 _ Z Xij 6(HW)17
aHab il- aHab ii  aHab

 

 

ii

 

where the divisions between two matrices are calculated
element—wise, and 1 is a matrix of all ones with the same size of X.
Similarly, the partial derivative of jpoi with respect to any element

Wab in W is

Therefore, the gradients of lpoi are

The update rules for the extended objective function with mani—
fold information, the way to decompose contact map matrix X into
HSHT and the way to handle sparse contact maps are discussed in
the Sections S1.1.2, S1.1.3 and S1.1.4, respectively.

4.1.3 Removing biases in contact maps
When studying Hi—C contact maps, it is desirable to correct the data
matrix such that signals coming from different genomic locations
are equally visible (Imakaev et al., 2012; Rao et al., 2014). Suppose
R is a matrix derived from X with all position—specific biases
removed, we require each row and each column of R to sum to the
same constant. We relate R and X by X :BRB, where B is a diag—
onal matrix with its diagonal elements indicating the biases at each
bin. BNMF applies non—negative factorization on matrix R, and
thus x : BHSHTB : (BH)S(BH)T.

To determine B and R from X, we first initialize B to be the iden—
tity matrix and iteratively normalize W : SHT and H:

nZ(SHTB),
b <— Diag T1

1:1 [:1
H <— b-lBH
B <— b

. 1 "
lo <— D1ag  
H <— H17-1
S <— IoS/o7

where Diag(v) is the diagonal matrix with the diagonal entries taken
from vector v. This process will produce suitable B and S that make
each column of SHT to sum to a constant and each column of H to
have an average of one, leading to HSHT having equal column sums
and equal row sums. Supplementary Figure S6a shows that our
method produces bias vectors highly similar to the ones produced by
the ICE method (Imakaev et al., 2012) based on a Hi—C contact map
obtained from the human GM06990 cell line (SRR027956). The
main difference between the two methods is that our method opti—
mizes a function for X z BHSHTB while the ICE method optimizes
X z BTB, which has much more free parameters. Supplementary
Figure S6b shows that after bias removal, the correlation between
contact maps obtained from the same cell line increased more than
the correlation between contact maps from different cell lines.

4.1.4 The final BNMF algorithm

Our BNMF algorithm combines the techniques discussed in the pre—
vious sections. For a non—negative symmetric matrix X 6 RM” and a
given number of clusters r, our algorithm finds diagonal matrix

Our algorithm initializes the matrices by the Non—negative

(Boutsidis and Gallopoulos, 2008). It then iteratively updates B, H
and S using the following rules:

where (X) represents element—wise multiplication and a small constant
e : 1 X 10—30 is added to avoid division—by—zero errors. The param—
eter A was always set to 1 in the current study. The algorithm ter—
minates when the decrease of objective score is less than 1 X 10—6 of
the score in the previous iteration, or a maximum number of iter—
ations is reached. In our analyses of the human and yeast datasets,
we observed that the objective score usually became stable after
1500 iterations. We therefore set the maximum number of iterations
to 3000, which guaranteed the convergence of the algorithm in most
cases.

BNMF contains a procedure for automatically determining the
number of clusters. The details are given in Section 9.1.5.

4.2 Statistical testing of co—localization

Using the BNMF clusters, we tested whether some genomic features
define bins that are co—localized. We considered two scenarios. In
the first, ‘binary’ scenario, genomic bins containing the feature or

have an average feature value exceeding a certain threshold will be
given a label of 1 (the positive bins), and all other regions will be
given a label of 0 (the negative bins). In other words, the feature pro—
vides a binary classification of the genomic bins. We used this setting
to test the co—localization of early replication sites, tRNA genes,
VRSM genes, genes highly expressed in specific cell lines, and super
enhancers (the data sources will be discussed in Section 4.3). In the
second, ‘continuous’ scenario, each bin is labeled by the average fea—
ture value across all genomic locations in the bin. We applied this
setting to the correlation between cluster affinity and either DNase I
hypersensitivity or replication time. For each scenario, we con—
sidered two different ways to perform the statistical tests.

For the binary scenario, we checked whether the positive bins
were spatially co—localized by using the cluster affinity values. The
first testing method was based on the area under the receiver oper—
ator characteristics (ROC), which was also used previously
(Cournac et al., 2012; Duan et al., 2010). Specifically, for each clus—
ter, we sorted all bins in descending order of their cluster affinity
values. We then used this order to make an ROC curve according to
the bin labels assigned by the feature. The statistical significance of
the AUC was evaluated by the Mann—Whitney U test. The resulting
P—values from all the clusters were then collected and the most sig—
nificant one was reported after Bonferroni correction for multiple
hypothesis testing.

The second method was inspired by the conserved consecutive
distances (CCD) method (Paulsen et al., 2013). The basic idea is to
compare a test statistic of the positive bins with a background distri—
bution of the test statistic. In our case, we used the average affinity
value to a cluster as the test statistic. The CCD method draws a large
number of random bins and computes the average affinity to the
cluster to form a corresponding background distribution of average
affinity values. In each sample, the bins are required to preserve the
same distance distribution between the positive bins in the primary
sequence. By having this requirement, the positive bins are con—
sidered significantly co—localized at a cluster only if their co—
localization is not simply due to their proximity in the primary se—
quence. The fraction of background bin samples with an average af—
finity higher than that of the positive bins is defined as the P—value.
Again, the most significant P—value after Bonferroni correction from
the different clusters was reported.

For the continuous scenario, we checked whether the cluster af—
finity values were quantitatively correlated with the feature values
of the bins. In the first testing method, we used Pearson correlation
coefficient (PCC), and in the second method, we used the Spearman
rank correlation coefficient (SPC). In either case, we used the
‘Numpy’ package in Python to calculate the P—values, and then
applied Bonferroni correction.

The key difference between our statistical tests and the ones pre—
viously used for analyzing DNA contact maps is that our tests in—
volve cluster affinity values instead of contact counts, which enables
us to test the relationship between a genomic feature and a specific
local cluster.

As a basic check of our statistical testing procedures, we exam—
ined the P—values computed from 100 randomly shufﬂed contact
maps. We used the yeast Hi—C contact map as a template and
shufﬂed each row and each column simultaneously to produce ran—
dom contact maps. In each random map, the bin labels were carried
over from the real case, but the contact counts were changed by the
shufﬂing. Supplementary Figure S8 shows that all four tests gave a
uniform distribution of the P—value as expected.

4.3 Data collection and pre—processing

Hi—C and TCC data were collected from multiple sources
(Supplementary Table S1). Human Hi—C data were mapped to the
th9 reference and pre—processed by the hiclib pipeline (Imakaev
et al., 2012). For the other Hi—C datasets, we downloaded the pro—
cessed data provided by the authors from public databases.

The synthetic yeast contact map was generated by using the vol—
ume exclusion model to produce 3000 simulated genomes and the
corresponding combined contact map, using the source codes pro—
vided by the author of a published study (Tjong et al., 2012). We
then added random position—specific biases to it to produce a noisy
contact map.

DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHS) and gene expression levels
based on RNA—seq in the four human cell lines GM12878, H1—
hESC, IMR90 and K562 were produced by the ENCODE consor—
tium (The Encode Project Consortium, 2012) and downloaded from
the UCSC Genome Browser (Kent at al., 2002). Cell—type specific
highly expressed genes in the four cell lines were defined as the genes
having an expression level of RPKM > 4 in a cell line but RPKM < 1
in the other three cell lines. Replication time of different regions in
the human genome was defined in a previous study (Ryba et al.,
2010) and we downloaded the data from http://www.replicationdo
main.org. Early replication sites in yeast were defined in a previous
work (Duan et al., 2010). The lists of super enhancers in the four
human cell lines were defined in a published study (Hnisz et al.,
2013).

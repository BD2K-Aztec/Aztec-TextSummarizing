Abstract

Motivation: DNA methylation signatures in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have been identified in fibro—
blast—like synoviocytes (FLS) with Illumina HumanMethylation450 array. Since <2% of CpG sites
are covered by the Illumina 450K array and whole genome bisulfite sequencing is still too expen—
sive for many samples, computationally predicting DNA methylation levels based on 450K data
would be valuable to discover more RA—related genes.

Results: We developed a computational model that is trained on 14 tissues with both whole gen—
ome bisulfite sequencing and 450K array data. This model integrates information derived from the
similarity of local methylation pattern between tissues, the methylation information of flanking
CpG sites and the methylation tendency of flanking DNA sequences. The predicted and measured
methylation values were highly correlated with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.9 in leave—
one—tissue—out cross—validations. lmportantly, the majority (76%) of the top 10% differentially
methylated loci among the 14 tissues was correctly detected using the predicted methylation val—
ues. Applying this model to 450K data of RA, osteoarthritis and normal FLS, we successfully ex—
panded the coverage of CpG sites 18.5—fold and accounts for about 30% of all the Cst in the
human genome. By integrative omics study, we identified genes and pathways tightly related to
RA pathogenesis, among which 12 genes were supported by triple evidences, including 6 genes al—
ready known to perform specific roles in RA and 6 genes as new potential therapeutictargets.

Recent studies have applied Illumina HumanMethylation450
BeadChip array to reveal distinct DNA methylation patterns that
distinguish RA samples from osteoarthritis (OA) and normal (NL)
FLS. Integrative analysis on the differentially methylated loci
(DML), the associated genes and relevant pathways has provided in—
sightful clues for identification of therapeutic targets (Ai et (11.,
2015; Ekwall et (11., 2015; Nakano et (11., 2013; Whitaker et (11.,
2013, 2015). A significant limitation of the Illumina 450K array is
that it only covers less than 2% of CpG loci in the entire human gen—
ome. Expanding the coverage of CpG loci in defining the DNA
methylation pattern of RA is becoming an urgent need.

Previously, computational methods have been developed to predict
methylation values based on DNA sequences, histone modifications or
integration of DNA methylation data from different techniques.
Methods using only DNA sequence features can learn the methylation
tendency for a CpG site based on its surrounding sequence compos—
itions in a specific tissue (Bock et (11., 2006; Fang et (11., 2006; Feltus
et (11., 2003; Feng et (11., 2014), but the trained model cannot be trans—
ferred to predict methylation levels in different tissues because the in—
put sequence features remain the same and cell—type specific
methylation obviously vary from one cell type to another. Histone
modification features can reﬂect cell specificity and incorporating his—
tone modifications allows prediction of cell—specific DNA methylation
patterns (Bock et (11., 2009; Fan et (11., 2008; Zheng et (11., 2013).
Using these models require histone modification data to be available
in the cell type of interest, which is not always the case. Recently com—
putational methods were developed to infer DNA methylation levels
in the entire genome using MeDIP—seq and MRE—seq data (Stevens,
et (11., 2013). Since neither histone modification data nor MeDIP—seq/
MRE—seq data are available for RA, a new computational method to
expand the coverage of Illumina 450K array is no doubt valuable to
further refine the DNA methylation signature of RA.

In this study, we developed a prediction model integrating cell—
type specific 450K array data and common DNA—sequence features.
The model was trained on 14 cell types/tissues that have both 45 OK
array and whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data as local
DNA methylation patterns are similar between similar tissues (Byun
et (11., 2009; Fan and Zhang, 2009), and the methylation status of a
CpG in one tissue is correlated with or affected by its ﬂanking CpG
sites and sequence compositions (Lister et (11., 2009; Stadler et (11.,
2011). The model aims to capture such local similarity of DNA
methylation patterns across cell types/tissues. We performed cross
validations to confirm the success of this method, with an average
prediction correlation coefficient around 0.9, accuracy over 0.9, and
AUC close to 0.9. Particularly, 70—80% of differential methylation
loci were correctly retrieved using the predicted methylation levels.

We previously used 450K array data to identify a characteristic
DNA methylation pattern in RA FLS, which are pathogenic cells that
form the lining of the joint (Firestein, 2003; Whitaker et (11., 2013,
2015). These data implicated genes and pathways in the pathogenesis
of RA, especially related to immunity, cell adhesion and matrix regu—
lation. Applying this model to the original 28 FLS 450K array data,
we expanded the CpG coverage to 8 555 846 sites, which is over 18—
fold greater than the number of CpG sites covered by 450K array.
Using the predicted methylation sites, we found 3874 genes differen—
tially methylated between RA and OA/NL (referred as differentially
methylated genes, DMGs). Combing these DMGs, genes differentially
expressed between RA and OA/NL (DEGs), and RA—associated genes
from Genome—Wide Association Study (GWAS) studies, we found 11
enriched KEGG pathways. Most of these pathways are related to im—
mune system and expand upon with those found by 450K array data
only. Twelve genes were supported by three—way evidences of DML,

DMG and GWAS, among which half are related to RA such as HLA—
DQA1, LBH and ELMOl (Castro et (11., 2001; Ekwall et (11., 2015;
Whitaker et (11., 2015).

2 Methods and results

2.1 Prediction model

We proposed the following strategy to predict the methylation levels
of Cst outside the Illumina 450K covered sites. This model is
based on the following assumptions:

1) The methylation level of a CpG site in two cell types or tissues
is similar if their flanking methylation patterns are similar (local
methylation pattern);

2) The methylation level of a CpG site is related to its adjacent
upstream and downstream CpG sites in the same cell type or tissue
(neighbor CpG methylation levels);

3) The methylation level of a CpG site is related to its ﬂanking
DNA sequence composition.

Let variables x1, x2 and x3 represent local methylation pattern,
neighbor CpG methylation levels and methylation information
derived from ﬂanking DNA sequence composition, respectively. We
constructed a logistic regression model I} : f (x1,x2,x3) to predict
the methylation values of a given CpG site (Fig. 1).

In Figure 1A, methylation patterns of tissue 1 to tissue 71 were
measured by both WGBS and 450K array. In order to get the methy—
lation value of the CpG locus I not covered by 450K array, we com—
pared its local 450K methylation pattern of region R1 with the n
tissues, and selected the WGBS methylation value of locus I from the
tissue which has the most similar local methylation pattern. The local
methylation pattern of region R] was represented by the 450K methy—
lation values of the closest 10 CpG loci, 5 upstream and downstream
in the genome. The similarity was measured by the Pearson correl—
ation coefficient between the local methylation patterns of different
tissues. As the methylation level of locus I would be weakly correlated
with CpG loci far away from it, we only considered the locus 1 within
5 kbp of a CpG site covered by 45 OK array.

In Figure 1B, x2 of CpG locus l is the weighted450K methylation
values of its closest upstream and downstream Cst. The normal—
ized weights of upstream and downstream CpG are inversely pro—
portional to its genomic distance to CpG locus I. To model the
relationship between DNA methylation and sequence composition,
we trained a sub—model before merging the three variables into
the final model to avoid the large number of sequence feature
dominating the final model (Fig. 1C). We extracted 362 features
including NpN ratio, NpN content (N represents any nucleotide,
i.e. A/G/T/C) and 1— to 4—mers occurrence frequencies (Fig. 1C), where
NpN content: (#N + #N)/len(Sequence), and NpN ratio : (#NpN ><
len(Sequence)))/(#N><#N). Then we performed feature selection using
random forest. For each chromosome of each tissue, 3—fold cross—
validation was repeated 10 times, and we recorded the 50 most fre—
quently selected sequence features. Support vector regression was used
to construct the sub model to obtain the methylation information x3 as
it showed better prediction results based on DNA—sequence features
(Bock et (11., 2006; Fan et (11., 2008; Fang et (11., 2006).

2.2 The model showed superior performance in
leave—one—tissue—out cross validations

We retrieved 14 tissues or cell lines that have both WGBS and 45 OK
array data, including adipose, adrenal, aorta, esophagus, H1, H9,
hippocampus, intestine, liver, lung, muscle, pancreas, spleen, thy—
mus, generated by the NIH epigenomics roadmap project (Bernstein
et (11., 2010). The methylation proportion values of WGBS data and
beta values of 450K array were downloaded from the GEO
Database directly. Both WGBS data and 450K array data were
quantile normalized. The performance of our strategy was assessed
by leave—one—tissue—out cross validation on all the 22 autosomes.
The evaluation metrics included Pearson correlation coefficient,
Concordance (the percent of Cst with a methylation proportion
difference <0.25 (Harris et (11., 2010), Sensitivity (SE), Specificity
(SP), Accuracy (ACC), Matthew’s correlation coefficient (MCC)
and AUC (Area Under ROC Curve). For calculating SE, SP, ACC
and MCC, we defined the methylation status as +1 if the methyla—
tion value is larger than 0.5, and the methylation status as —1
otherwise.

In leave—one—tissue—out cross validation, we trained the predic—
tion model on the remaining 13 tissues, and evaluated the prediction
performance on the left—out tissue. Figure 2A shows that the Pearson
correlation coefficients between the predicted and measured values
were 0.9025 : 0.0093, indicating that the predicted methylation
values are overall similar to the WGBS measurements. The scatter
plots between predicted and measured WGBS values of the 22
chromosomes (Supplementary Figure S1 in Supplementary
Materials) showed that the majority of the dots distributed along
the diagonal line. Consistently, high concordance (0.9103 :
0.0040), SE (0.9684 i 0.0039), SP (0.8260 : 0.0224), ACC
(0.9318 : 0.0045), MCC (0.8160 i 0.0167) and AUC (0.8565 :
0.124) also demonstrated a satisfactory performance of our pro—
posed strategy.

The most challenging but also the most meaningful prediction is
to correctly identify DMLs across tissues. To define DMLs, we cal—
culated the methylation value variation of each CpG site across the
14 tissues. CpG sites were sorted according to their methylation
variation. The CpG locus with larger variations would be regarded
to be more differentially methylated. We called DMLs using both
measured WGBS and predicted DNA methylation values. The over—
lapping of measured and predicted DMLs among the 14 tissues are
shown in Figure 2B. In the most distinguished 5, 10 and 15% of

and 78.91 i 0.92% were correctly identified by DML called by the
predicted DNA methylation values, respectively. When focusing on
the CpG loci corresponding to the top 10% DMLs, we got the aver—
age prediction ACCof 0.7033 : 0.0073 and AUC of 0.6856 :
0.0092, respectively (Fig. 2C).

We also investigated whether one tissue was always selected for
predicting another tissue. Figure 2D shows that the most predictive
tissues/cell line for the query tissue/cell was not dominant by a single
tissue/cell line, except H1 and H9. More than 75% of CpG loci of
H1 and H9 shared the most similar local methylation patterns,
which is not surprising because both H1 and H9 are human embry—
onic stem cell lines. The selected percentages of other tissues are
relatively evenly distributed, which indicates no biased selection of
predictive WGBS data in the model based on tissue/cell similarity.

2.3 Predicted RA methylation patterns

Illumina 450K array data on 11 RA, 11 0A and 6 NL samples were
generated in our previous studies (Whitaker et (11., 2013). Applying
the prediction model to FLS samples, we predicted methylation val—
ues for the CpG sites within 5 kbp of any 450K CpG. The over—
lapped CpG sites in the 14 tissues/cell lines and 28 FLS samples after

array quality filtering were 462 105. The number of predicted CpG
sites was 8 555 846, which is 18.5 times of the sites covered by
450K array and about 30% of all the Cst in the human genome.
The expanded number of Cst in each of the 22 autosomes is
shown in Figure 3A. Consistent with the cross validations, the pre—
dictive tissues for each RA/OA/NL tissue based on the local methy—
lation pattern were wide spread over the 14 tissues (Fig. 3B), which
further confirmed that the selection was not biased. For the valid—
ation purpose, we also predicted the methylation levels of Cst cov—
ered in 450K array using our model and then calculated the
correlations between the predicted and measured values (Fig. 3C).
All the Pearson correlation coefficients were around 0.95, confirm—
ing the success of the prediction model.

2.4 Identification of RA—related genes and pathways

We collected the original 450K data and the expanded CpG methy—
lation values from our predictions, based on which we aimed to
identify the DMGs between 11 RA, 11 OA and 6 NL samples.
Welch’s t—test was used to calculate the P—values of Cst located in
promoter regions [(TSS—2500 bp, TSS + 500 bp)] by comparing RA
versus OA, RA versus NL and RA versus (OA +NL). For each CpG
locus, the lowest P—value in the three pairs of comparison tests was
selected. For each promoter, the Fisher’s combined test was used to
evaluate whether a gene is differentially methylated. Then P—values

were adjusted to q—values. 3874 genes with q—value < 0.05 and
mean difference of DNA methylation >0.1 were selected as DMGs.

Next, we performed integration analysis from the expanded
DNA methylation data, gene expression data and GWAS studies to
identify gens whose relevance to RA are supported by multiple lines
of evidences. For Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) in RA, we
downloaded the microarray data of 9 RA, 11 OA and 11 NL FLS
samples from GEO database (Del Rey et al., 2012) (GEO ID
GSE29746). Using the same processing method in our previous
work (Whitaker et al., 2015), we took genes >2—fold change in ex—
pression and P—value < 0.05(Welch’s t—test), and found 2947 DEGs.
Furthermore, we collected GWAS genes from reference Hindorff
et al. (2009) and a recent meta—analysis of over 100 000 cases and
controls (Okada et al., 2014).

There were 484 genes supported by two evidences (Fig. 4A). We
first analyzed the GO terms of these 484 genes. Totally, there were 8
enriched GO Molecular Function (MF) terms, 25 cellular compo—
nent (CC) terms and 132 biological process (BP) terms. Some en—
riched GO termed related to RA are listed in Table 1 and others are
given in the Supplementary Materials. We next analyzed the enrich—
ment of KEGG pathways (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000) in these genes.
The enrichment P—value was calculated with hypergeometric distri—
bution and then adjusted to q—values. Pathways with q—value < 0.05
were considered to as significantly enriched. This way we found 11
enriched pathways (Fig. 4B). Among them, five are related to human

immune diseases: Graft—versus—host disease, Allograft rejection,
Autoimmune thyroid disease, Asthma, RA, which covers 62.5% of
all the 8 annotated immune disease related pathwaysin human; two
of them are immune system pathways: Intestinal immune network
for IgA production, Antigen processing and presentation; two are
signaling pathways: cell adhesion molecules, Cytokine—cytokine re—
ceptor interaction. These genes and pathways are highly relevant to
the pathogenesis of RA, which are consistent with our previous re—
sults based on only 450K array data (Whitaker et al., 2015). Despite
increasing the number of Cst by 18—fold, differentially methylated
pathways remained highly relevant to RA pathogenesis. Biologic
validation of the newly identified genes will be important, but the
fact that they are consistent with previously identified RA—associated
genes suggests that the results are not random.

There were 12 genes supported by all three evidences, including
IL23R, LBH, CASP8, HLA—DQA1, OLIG3, HLA—G, IRF5,
ELMO1, TRHDE, SLCO1C1, PLD4, AIRE. Five of them over—
lapped with the seven triple—evidenced genes identified from 45 OK
array data only analysis. More importantly, six of them have re—
ported association with RA. HLA—DQA1 has known roles in RA
(Castro et al., 2001), LBH is a regulator of cell cycle in RA FLS and
also a potential RA therapeutic target (Ekwall et al., 2015) and
ELMOl contributes to the pathogenesis of RA as a regulator of FLS
migration and invasion (Whitaker et al., 2015 ); The AIRE gene was
identified as a genetic risk factor for RA in a GWAS study(Garcia—
Lozano et al., 2013; Shao et al., 2014; Terao et al., 2011); IRF5 con—
fers susceptibility to RA and inﬂuences its erosive phenotype
(Dawidowicz et al., 2011); GWAS replication study confirmed the
association of PDE3A—SLCOlC1 with anti—TNF therapy response
in RA in reference Acosta—Colman et al. (2013).

Among the remaining six genes, HLA—G was reported to be a
candidate biomarker for prognosis and disease activity in early RA
patients (Rizzo et al., 2013); IL23R, which plays a role in Th17 cell
differentiation, was a controversial gene: one group found associ—
ation of two IL23R SNPs with RA in Hungarian population (Farago
et al., 2008; Szabo et al., 2013), while in a Spanish study no associ—
ation was detected (Orozco et al., 2007); OLIG3 was reported for
association with susceptibility and severity in an inception cohort in
Morgan et al. (2010), while a later study found it was not associated
with the severity of joint destruction in RA (Knevel et al., 2012); For
TRHDE, there was only one work reporting that it might be a RA
susceptibility genes based on Korean RA samples (Freudenberg

et al., 2011); For PLD4, there was no report showing its direct rela—
tion with RA.

To make sure that these results were not dominated by the 45 OK
array data, we repeated the above analyses using only the expanded
CpG loci not covered by 450K array. We called DMGs identified
this way as eDMGs (Fig. 4C and D). There were 391 genes sup—
ported by two evidences and the enriched pathways are shown in
Figure 4D. The 11 enriched pathways are the same as those analyzed
with CpG loci including 45 OK array data. There were 11 genes sup—
ported by all three evidences including LBH, CASP8, HLA—DQA1,
OLIG3, HLA—G, IRF5, ELMO1, TRHDE, SLCO1C1, PLD4, AIRE
(only IL23R was missed and its role in RA is controversial). These
results suggested that the expanded methylation data alone is in—
formative of RA pathogenesis.

Furthermore, we investigated the DMGs only identified by the ex—
panded data but not by 450K array data. We repeated the above ana—
lyses using eDMGs exclusively identified from the predicted data.
There were 275 genes supported by two evidences (Fig. 4E). The 12
enriched pathways are shown in Figure 4F, among which 11 are the
same as those found in the above two analyses and the additional
Jak—STAT signaling pathway is known to be important for RA.

3 Discussion

Illumina 450K BeadChip array is a useful way to investigate the dif—
ferent DNA methylation patterns in RA and many diseases. In fact,
tens of thousands of Illumina 45 OK array data have been generated
on precious disease samples. Despite the invaluable insights gener—
ated by these 45 OK array data, the small coverage of the CpG sites
limited the scope of the investigated DNA methylation patterns in
RA and other diseases. Our computational strategy to predict DNA
methylation based on 45 OK data alone opens a new avenue of repro—
cessing the existing data that were previously generated by 450K
array to uncover new disease—related genes before these samples are
re—analyzed using WGBS. When applying to a new sample, our
model only requires input of 45 OK array data and avoids the need of
histone modification or MeDIP—seq/MRE—seq data that are not al—
ways available, which significantly expands its applicability.

Illumina recently released a new Infinium MethylationEPIC
Array which is to replace the current methylation450K array
(referred to as the 850K array), which covers about 3% of Cst of
the human genome. It is straightforward to apply our expanding al—
gorithm to significantly expand the coverage of the 85 OK array once
enough 85 OK array data are available.

Our method significantly expanded the coverage of CpG sites,
which is 18.5 times of the Cst covered by 450K array and ac—
counts for about 30% of all the Cst in the human genome. The
current model is trained on 14 tissues that have both WGBS and
450K array data. The performance of the model is expected to be
further improved when more tissues/cells are included in training
the model. Importantly, our model can successfully predict DML
and its performance was confirmed by both leave—one—tissue—out
cross validations and identification of RA—related genes/pathways.
The 12 triple—evidenced genes with predicted DNA methylation
data, a significant increase from 7 based on 45 OK array data, include
6 genes with reported functions in RA and 6 genes as potential
therapeutic targets. We expect the similar applications to other dis—
eases would greatly facilitate discovery of new drug targets and
understanding of disease mechanisms.

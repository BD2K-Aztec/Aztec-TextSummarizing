and hexanucleotide composition (6—tuple). The second group
contains three feature sets: Moreau—Broto autocorrelation coef—
ﬁcient (Feng and Zhang, 2000), Moran autocorrelation coefﬁ—
cient (Horne, 1988) and Geary autocorrelation coefﬁcient (Sokal
and Thomson, 2006). These three autocorrelation features de—
scribe the level of correlation between two k—tuple nucleotides
in terms of their speciﬁc structural and/or physicochemical prop—
erties. The third group consists of two types of pseudo k—tuple
nucleotide compositions: Type I PseKNC and Type II PseKNC.

Compared with the PseKNC server, PseKNC-General has the
following major advantages and improvements.

First, PseKNC-General is a stand—alone program and can be
run on local computers. It does not require uploading sequences
to the server and hence can process large—scale datasets with no
data—size limit. Therefore, it is faster and easier to generate the
pseudo k—tuple compositions and to adjust the parameters.

Second, PseKNC-General can be used for not only DNA se—
quences but also RNA sequences.

Third, PseKNC-General incorporates additional structural
and physicochemical properties (Supplementary Material S1),
and more conveniently allows users to add or specify their own
structural and physicochemical properties. It is thus both more
ﬂexible and more expandable.

Fourth, a user—friendly GUI is also provided along with the
command—line program. Every parameter in PseKNC—General
can be easily configured from the GUI. Hence, users can com—
fortably choose the mode that they prefer to run the program.
All the source code together with the detailed illustration docu—
ments of the package can be freely downloaded from http://lin.
uestc.edu.cn/server/pseknc.

Finally, results can be saved in three different file formats: the
LibSVM format, the CSV format and the tab—delimited format.
All these formats are suitable for downstream computational
analyses, such as machine learning.

3 CONCLUSIONS

The continued expansion of genomic sequences necessitates the
development of computational tools to annotate functional

elements from DNA or RNA sequences. One of the important
tasks is to formulate the genomic sequences with an effective
expression form that can reﬂect the intrinsic correlation with
their structures and functions. PseKNC—General makes this
task readily achievable for any expert and/or non—expert users
via its highly ﬂexible, configurable and user—friendly design. It
allows for fast and accurate computation of a broad range of
physicochemical properties of k—tuple nucleotide in DNA/RNA
sequences. The effectiveness and usefulness of these properties
have been demonstrated by a series of existing works. Hence, we
anticipate that PseKNC-General will become a useful package in
exploring problems concerning computational genomics and
genome sequence analysis. In the future, we will collect more
experimental physicochemical properties for other k—tuple nu—
cleotides (k = 4, 5 or higher) and integrate them into the current
version of PseKNC—General to further enhance its power.

ABSTRACT

Summary: The rapid advancement of genomic technology has
revealed the enormous complexity and combinatorial nature of chro-
matin modifications. To facilitate interpretation of the combinatorial
nature of chromatin, we have developed a novel method to integrate
all chromatin datasets into distinct nucleosome types (nucleosome
alphabet). We have applied this approach to Saccharomyces cerevi—
siae, generating a nucleosome alphabet, which forms chromatin
motifs when mapped back to the genome. By applying novel chroma-
tin alignment and global word search approaches, we have defined
distinctive chromatin motifs for introns, origins of replication, tRNAs,
antisense transcripts, double-strand-break hotspots and DNase
hypersensitive sites, and can distinguish genes by expression level.
We have also uncovered strong associations between transcription
factor binding and specific types of nucleosomes. Our results demon-
strate the uses and functionality of defining a chromatin alphabet and
provide a unique and novel framework for exploring chromatin
architecture.

1 INTRODUCTION

The DNA of all eukaryotic organisms is organized and struc-
tured into chromatin, a nucleoprotein complex through which
genetic material is structured and manoeuvred to elicit cellular
processes such as transcription, cellular division, differentiation
and DNA repair The core component of eukaryotic chromatin is
the nucleosome, which is composed of 147 base pairs of DNA
wrapped around a histone octamer of H2A, H2B, H3 and H4.
The amino and carboxyl termini of histones are susceptible to an
enormous number of post-translational covalent modiﬁcations,
of which 59 distinct modiﬁcations have currently been identiﬁed.
These modiﬁcations have been proposed to function by directly
altering the intrinsic chromatin structure and/ or by presenting or
alternatively binding of chromatin-modifying complexes (Rando,
2012).

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) in combination with
high-throughput sequencing (NGS) and microarrays (ChIP—seq
and ChIP—chip) has been used to measure the occupancy of

speciﬁc histone modiﬁcations and histone variants at a genomic
scale. For Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a broad spectrum of histone
modiﬁcations, including but not limited to H3K14Ac, H3K9Ac
and H3K79me3, have been investigated with low-resolution
(20(%300 bp) microarrays (Pokholok et al., 2005). Higher-reso-
lution (5&100 bp) microarrays have been used to interrogate the
location of modiﬁcations such as H3K4me3, H3R2me2a and
H3K4Ac (Guillemette et al., 2011; Kirmizis et al., 2007). ChIP-
seq has recently been used to map H2A.Z, H2BK123ub,
H3K36me2 and H3K36me3 (Albert et al., 2007; Batta et al.,
2011). In addition to ChIP, micrococcal nuclease (MNase) diges-
tion assays have been used to map nucleosome positioning and
occupancy at near-bp resolution across the yeast genome (Rizzo
et al., 2011, 2012).

The analysis of these datasets has been instrumental in
expanding our understanding of chromatin’s regulatory poten-
tial. However, each of these genome-wide datasets is only a small
portion of an extremely complex system. Emerging evidence sug-
gests that chromatin modiﬁcations function in a combinatorial
code that extends across several neighbouring nucleosomes
(Rando, 2012). It is therefore advantageous to examine the pat-
tern and spacing of nucleosomes with their histone variants and
modiﬁcations, i.e. the chromatin ‘architecture’ of genomic func-
tional elements (Givens et al., 2012; Lai and Buck, 2010).

We have integrated numerous genomic datasets and identiﬁed
the dominant nucleosome types (nucleosome alphabet) by their
post-translational modiﬁcations and histone variants. Our nu-
cleosome alphabet has allowed us to identify chromatin motifs
for genomic functional elements, including novel motifs for in-
trons, ARS consensus sequences (ACS), tRNAs, DNase hyper-
sensitivity sites (DHS), double-strand-break hotspots (DSB
Hotspots) and antisense transcripts. We have also identiﬁed sig-
niﬁcant associations between transcription factor (TF) binding
and speciﬁc types of nucleosomes. Overall, our approach allows
us to uncover the shared chromatin architecture across all similar
functional elements, and apply traditional sequence alignment
and motif-finding algorithms to chromatin for the first time.

Methods.

2.1 Nucleosome calling and genomic datasets

The locations of 68 288 nucleosomes were determined from an MNase-
Seq dataset using the template-ﬁltering algorithm (Riuo et al., 2011;

Weiner et al., 2010). Histone modiﬁcation and RNA-Seq datasets were
downloaded from the Saccharomyces Genome Database and the
Sequence Read Archive (Supplementary Table S1). All sequencing data
were aligned to the r64 build of S.cerevisiae using the short-read align-
ment algorithm bowtie, allowing up to one mismatch (Langmead et al.,
2009). All histone modiﬁcation datasets were normalized, transformed
into logz ratios and used to score a 147-bp window around the dyad of
each nucleosome for that modiﬁcation. Fragments per kilobase of exon
per million fragments mapped were calculated using cufﬂinks for all
coding sequencing (CDS) and for genes with transcription starts and
stops (Trapnell et al., 2010).

2.2 Alphabetizing and annotating the nucleosomes

The data matrix containing the log ratio scores for each experiment at
each nucleosome was analysed using the Weka Java program’s imple-
mentation of the X-means algorithm to identify the optimal number of
clusters in the matrix (Hall et al., 2009; Pelleg and Moore, 2000). Eighteen
distinct clusters were identiﬁed with a peak Bayesian Information
Criterion of 325 867; see Supplementary File 1 with location of all
nucleosomes.

2.3 Chromatin alignment
Nucleosomes letters for gene alignment were extracted between their
known transcriptional starts and stops and binned according to the size

of each gene (Xu et al., 2009). Chromatin motifs were generated after
alignment with MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004).

2.4 Genome-wide chromatin word search

The list of 18 nucleosome letters was permutated to generate the list of all
possible ﬁve-letter combinations (words) to a total number of 1 889 568
possible words. All words in the S .cerevisiae genome were then annotated
to known functional elements and enrichment was determined by permu-
tation. Similar words were combined and motifs generated at signiﬁcantly
enriched functional elements.

2.5 Testing for nucleosome enrichment

Nucleosomes were assigned to conserved TF binding sites for 118 TFs
from Maclssac et a]. downloaded from Saccharomyces Genome
Database (Maclsaac et al., 2006). Hyper-geometric testing with multiple
testing corrections was performed to identify which, if any, nucleosome
letters enriched for a TF.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Correlation reveals histone code relationships

To examine the relationships between histone modiﬁcations, we
calculated the pairwise correlations between each histone modi-
ﬁcation at the 68 228 nucleosomes in the yeast genome (Fig. 1A).
In general, the correlation structure revealed two distinct classes
of histone modifications. The ﬁrst subset of correlated marks
includes H3K9Ac, H3K4Ac, H3K4me3, H3K14Ac, H4Ac,
H2A.Z and H3K4me2. Most of these modiﬁcations have been
independently associated with promoter activity and transcrip-
tionally active regions (Liu et al., 2005; Rando, 2012). Our
ﬁndings suggest that these modiﬁcations may function in
tandem and possibility cooperatively with each other.

The second subset of correlated modiﬁcations includes
H2BK123ub, H3K36me3, H3K36me2, H3, H3K79me3,
H3K4me1 and H3R2me2a. These modifications have been

independently associated with diverse biological function, includ-
ing, but not limited to, transcriptional repression (H3K79me3,
H3R2me2a) and exon-coding sequence (H3K36me2,
H3K36me3) (Batta et al., 2011; Kirmizis et al., 2007; Liu et al.,
2005; Pokholok et al., 2005). Known anti-correlation relation-
ships were also recapitulated, such as the previously character-
ized anti-correlation between H3K4me3 and H3R2me2a
(Guillemette et al., 2011; Kirmizis et al., 2007). The strong
correlation between H3R2me2a and H3K4me1 and the strong
anti-correlations between H3K4me1 and the promoter-
associated histone modiﬁcations suggest a broader role for
H3K4me1 than previously suggested in S.cerevisiae.

3.2 Eighteen distinct classes of nucleosomes deﬁne
biological functions

The 68228 by 14 nucleosome histone modiﬁcation matrix was
clustered to identify 18 dominant nucleosome letters
(Supplementary Table S2). We then compared each nucleosome
type with each other by examining the correlation coefﬁcients
between their respective histone modifications (Fig. 1B). After
2-D hierarchical clustering, the resulting correlation structure
reveals three blocks of similar nucleosome types with partially
overlapping relationships. Visual inspection of the nucleosome
types revealed that there was preferential positioning of each type
with respect to the underlying genomic feature (Fig. 1C). To
develop a clearer understanding of the relationships among the
nucleosome types, we clustered them by their histone modiﬁca-
tions (Fig. 1D). Many of the nucleosome clusters were similar,
with subtle, yet interesting, differences, with approximately six
sub-groups of nucleosome clusters representing the majority of
the diversity of nucleosome clusters. Comparison of nucleosome
classes with a variety of genomic features revealed shared biolo-
gical function (Fig. 1E and Supplementary Fig. S1).

Group 1 nucleosomes represented 13% of all yeast nucleo-
somes and contained the types A, B, C and D. These nucleo-
somes all possessed high occupancy scores for promoter regions,
the 5/ end of CD8 and transcriptional start site (TSS)—associated
nucleosomes across all genes, including both high and lowly
expressed CDS. The histone marks ranked highly at these
nucleosomes were H3K9Ac, H3K4Ac, H3K14Ac, H4Ac,
H3K4me3 and H2A.Z, which are all histone modiﬁcations that
have been shown in separate studies to associate with active
transcription (Liu et al., 2005; Pokholok et al., 2005).
However, to our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst analysis to demon-
strate that these modiﬁcations may function in tandem with one
another. This group of nucleosomes, speciﬁcally nucleosome C,
also possessed high occupancy scores for DHS and DSB
Hotspots, possibly due to this nucleosome’s lower H3 occupancy
(Hesselberth et al., 2009; Pan et al., 2011). In addition, genes with
a +1 A or B nucleosome are enriched for the Gene Ontology
(GO) processes DNA-dependent transcription, DNA metabol-
ism and RNA metabolic processes (Supplementary Table S3).

Group 2 (G, H and I, 10% of all nucleosomes) nucleosomes
are similar to Group 1 nucleosomes but lacked H2A.Z as well as
the PolII-associated modiﬁcations H3K36me3 and H3K79me3
(V enters and Pugh, 2009). In addition to preferential
placement at the promoters and 5/ regions of highly expressed
genes, these nucleosomes are also highly associated with the

PolIII-transcribed tRNA and may represent a nucleosome
speciﬁc for RNA PolIII transcription. Genes with a +1 H and
G nucleosome are enriched for translation and ribosome biogen—
esis (Supplementary Table S3).

The nucleosomes K, L, M and N composed Group 3 nucleo-
somes (27% of all nucleosomes), and were characterized by
higher occupancy scores at mid-coding regions of the CDS and
the 3/ end of CDS of all genes. Although the nucleosomes of
Group 3 appeared, on average, at all mid-coding and the 3/ ends
of CDS, they displayed a preference for highly expressed genes.
These nucleosomes contained high levels of the coding-associated
histone modiﬁcations H3K36me3, H3K36me2 and H3K79me3,
as well as possessing higher occupancy scores for H3 (Batta et al.,
2011; Pokholok et al., 2005). The high occupancy levels at active
coding regions in combination with higher levels of H3K36me3
may indicate that these nucleosomes represent a speciﬁc class of
nucleosomes that depend on PolII for transcription.

Representing 36% of all nucleosomes, Group 4 was the largest
group and consisted of Q, R, S and T nucleosomes. Similar to
Group 3 nucleosomes, these nucleosomes possessed high levels of
occupancy in mid-coding regions and the 3/ end CDS for all
genes. Also like Group 3 nucleosomes, they possessed moderate
enrichment at antisense transcripts. However, in contrast to
Group 3 nucleosomes, Group 4 nucleosomes occurred preferen-
tially at lowly expressed genes. Although possessing similar chro-
matin modiﬁcations to Group 3, Group 4 possessed negligible
levels of H3K4me2. Group 4 nucleosomes were also character-
ized with increased enrichment for H3R2me2a, a known tran-
scriptional silencer that correlates with the 3/ end of CDS
(Kirmizis et al., 2007). These data along with Group 4 nucleo-
somes’ preferential placement suggest that this group may repre-
sent a distinct nucleosome for lowly expressed coding regions.

The nucleosomes assigned the letters V and W belonged to
Group 5 (10% of total nucleosomes) and possessed moderate
scores across most modifications. In particular, they possessed
high scores for H2A.Z, a histone variant associated with
transcriptional activity. H2A.Z has also been implicated in tran-
scriptional repression of genes that are transiently repressed
(Brickner et al., 2007). Their presence at lowly expressed CDS
would imply that this group of nucleosome may be involved in
the repression of genes that may need to be quickly activated.

The Y nucleosome (4% of total nucleosomes) was unique in
that it was the only member of its group as well as being char-
acterized by lacking almost all modiﬁcations, with the exception
of low levels of H3R2me2a. The Y nucleosome has a strong
presence at known ACS, tRNAs, telomeres, DHS and DSB
Hotspots. This would indicate that nucleosomes at these genomic
features contain overall low nucleosome occupancy with a min-
imum of histone modiﬁcations. In addition, the Y nucleosomes
appeared prevalently throughout the CDS of the bottom 10% of
expressed genes, indicating that this speciﬁc nucleosome may be
indicative of non-expressed genes.

3.3 Alignment of alphabetized chromatin deﬁne
chromatin motifs

With every nucleosome in the genome assigned a letter, we then

examined how the arrangements of these nucleosomes deﬁne

genes. Genes were binned by size, and the intervening

nucleosomes between transcription start and stop were concate-
nated into a chromatin sequence. Analogous to protein and
DNA sequences, these chromatin sequences can be further inter-
preted using sequence alignment algorithms to identify the con-
served structural patterns at locations of interest. However, as no
chromatin sequence alignment algorithm currently exists, we
adapted the MUSCLE (MUltiple Sequence Comparison by
Log-Expectation) algorithm, which has been previously used to
perform nucleotide and amino acid alignments, to also perform
alignments of chromatin sequences (Edgar, 2004).

This novel application of sequence alignment allowed us to
identify a chromatin motif for genes (see Methods). The resulting
chromatin motif is similar across all genes regardless of size
(Fig. 2A). In these chromatin motifs, the +1 nucleosome is pre-
dominately an A, B or C nucleosome (Group 1). Position +2 is
predominately a D or V nucleosome (Group 1/5). Within the
middle of genes are K, M or N nucleosomes (Group 3), followed
by Q, R, S or T nucleosomes (Group 4).

Another defined functional element in the genome, origins of
replication were also aligned to determine whether a distinct
chromatin structure surrounds the origin of replications (Eaton
et al., 2010). Nucleosome types within 1 kb upstream and down-
stream of replication origins were aligned and a unique motif was
generated that was characterized by the absence of almost all
nucleosomes throughout the motif (Fig. 2C). This chromatin
motif did feature a preference for the Y nucleosome, which is a
lowly occupied nucleosome, lacking all histone modifications
except H3R2me2a.

3.4 Chromatin motif varies by gene expression

Expression data from RNA-Seq were used to identify the top
and bottom 10% of expressed genes Wassour et al., 2009). The
highly and lowly expressed genes were binned and aligned as
previously described (Fig. 2B). The resulting aligned chromatin
motifs revealed that the chromatin architectures of highly and
lowly expressed genes are fundamentally different from one an-
other. The 5/ CDS regions of highly expressed genes contained a
higher presence of the H nucleosome than the other motifs. This
nucleosome contained higher scores for histone modifications
related to active transcription, such as H3K9Ac and H3K4Ac,
and possessed the lowest H3. The mid-coding regions of highly
expressed genes followed the structural motifs of all CDS with a
high presence of Group 3 nucleosomes. However, the 3/ CDS
region was distinct in that it possessed much lower levels of
Group 4 nucleosomes compared with the other motifs and in
the case of short genes, completely absent. As the Group 4 nu-
cleosomes possess higher occupancy and the presence of the pre-
viously described repressive marks, it is expected that they should
be Virtually absent from highly expressed genes. The motif for
highly expressed long genes was noticeably less deﬁned than the
motif for smaller genes. This contrasts with the same size motif
for lowly expressed genes, implying that highly expressed genes
possess less deﬁned nucleosome positioning and organization
relative to lower expressed genes.

The chromatin motifs for lowly expressed genes were distinct
from all CDS and highly expressed CDS. The 5/ CDS region of
lowly expressed genes contained notably higher levels of nucleo-
somes from Groups 4, 5 and 6. Interestingly, the chromatin

using MUSCLE. (C) Chromatin sequences for S.cerevisiae origins of replication were extracted and aligned using the MUSCLE algorithm

motifs of lowly expressed genes were distinct from other motifs,
in that they possessed a large number of the V and W nucleo-
somes across the entire motif. The nucleosomes of Group 5 are
characterized by higher occupancy and high levels of H2A.Z, a
histone variant believed to play a role in reactivation of expres-
sion after repression (Brickner et al., 2007).

The mid-coding regions of lowly expressed genes again dif-
fered from all CDS in their preference for the L nucleosome
compared with the average CDS preference for the K, M and
N nucleosomes. This L nucleosome differs from the K, M and N
in that it almost completely lacks H3K36me3 and H3K79me3,
two covalent modiﬁcations dependent on PolII elongation. This
supports the idea of the L nucleosome being a mid-coding nu-
cleosome for lowly transcribed genes. The 3/ CDS region of lowly
expressed genes also showed a much more dominant Q
nucleosome.

3.5 Identiﬁcation of novel chromatin architectures at
functional elements

To identify novel chromatin motifs, we examined all possible
ﬁve-letter nucleosome arrangements and tested for significant
associations with functional elements (see Methods). We identi-
ﬁed three chromatin motifs that enriched for intronic regions
(Fig. 3A). These regions were characterized by motifs composed

ACS. These chromatin motifs mirrored the previous chromatin
motifs generated by multiple sequence alignment (Fig. 3B).
However, these motifs were far more clearly deﬁned than the
previous motifs and imply a chromatin polarity with
asymmetrical distributions of Y and Q nucleosomes, reminiscent
of the asymmetric chromatin architecture observed at
Schizosaccharomyces pombe origins of replication (Givens
et al., 2012).

tRNA-enriched chromatin motifs were composed primarily
of the transcriptionally active Group 1 and 2 nucleosomes.
This supports their role as highly transcribed genes in the
S.cerevisiae genome (Fig. 3C). However, the presence of the Y
nucleosome, which is characterized by exceptionally low occu-
pancy of almost all nucleosome modiﬁcations, was intriguing.
The frequency of nucleosome subtypes at each of the unique
codons was calculated, and on average, 25% of tRNA associated
nucleosomes were the Y nucleosome for each unique codon
(Supplementary Fig. S2). Of great interest was the ﬁnding that
the TTG and TTA codons, which both code for leucine, pos-
sessed considerably different compositions of nucleosome sub-
types. TTG is composed primarily of the Y nucleosome,
whereas TTA is composed primarily of the active Group 2 nu-
cleosomes. The TTG tRNA has recently been shown to be pref-
erentially transcribed in oxidative stress conditions (Chan et al.,
2012). This ﬁnding provides evidence that chromatin may play a
role in differential tRNAs’ regulation in the S .cerevisiae genome.
DHS and DSB hotspots were both enriched for similar chroma-
tin motifs that were composed of high levels of nucleosome
acetylation and nucleosomes containing low H3 occupancy
(Supplementary Fig. 83A and B). Antisense transcripts, on the
other hand, were enriched for chromatin motifs composed pre-
dominately of Group 5 nucleosomes (Supplementary Fig. S3C).

3.6 TFs enrich for speciﬁc nucleosomes

To determine if nearby binding by speciﬁc TFs was associated
and possibly directing certain histone modiﬁcation patterns, we
examined our nucleosome letters in relation (<100 bp from called
dyad) to known TF binding sites (Table 1 and Supplementary
Table S4). The majority of TFs were associated with nucleo-
somes B, C, H or I. These nucleosomes are enriched for pro-
moters and the :l:1 TSS nucleosome. These lowly occupied
nucleosomes have the active histone modifications H3K9ac,
H3K4ac, H3K14ac, H4ac and H3K4me3. The enrichment of
these nucleosomes at promoters was largely expected because
most TFs bind directly upstream of TSSs, where nucleosome
occupancy is the lowest (Harbison et al., 2004). However, there
are clear distinctions with certain TFs targeting to the Y nucleo-
some. The Y nucleosome lacks all histone modiﬁcations, except
H3R2me2a, and is strongly associated with the bottom 10%
expressed gene promoters.

Six TFs (Ume6, Phdl, Suml, Msn2, Sok2 and Swi4) enriched
for the Y nucleosome. The majority of these TFs have been
associated with repression. Suml was unique in that it enriched
for the Y nucleosome without any Group 1 or 2 nucleosome
enrichments. The Y nucleosomes appear predominately at the
nucleosomes immediately ﬂanking TSS (+1/—1 positions) of
lowly expressed CDS, which would indicate that this TF binds
preferentially at regions possessing a chromatin profile of low

genomic activity. Suml is a known transcriptional repressor
that has been shown to recruit histone deacetylases, which is
consistent with the low acetylation levels of the Y nucleosomes
(Irlbacher et al., 2005). In addition, Phdl has been shown to
directly interact with the Tupl co-repressor complex and recruit
it to its targets ﬂ-Ianlon et al., 2011). Swi4, Phdl and Sok2 en-
riched simultaneously for the C, H and Y nucleosomes, which
represent +1 /—1 nucleosomes for highly, lowly and all expressed
CDS. These TFs have all been shown to interact with each other
and are involved in chromatin remodelling (Pan and Heitman,
2000; Yeang et al., 2005). This would indicate that these TFs may
bind to promoters independent of chromatin state. Also of inter-
est were TFs that enriched solely for the B nucleosome that
included Adrl, Tye7, an4 and Fkhl. Although these TFs pos-
sessed a wide variety of functions, it is interesting to note that
they speciﬁcally enriched for the B nucleosome that differs from
the other Group 1 nucleosomes by having a higher level of
H3K36me3.

4 DISCUSSION

As high-throughput chromatin data are continually generated
through efforts such as the ENCODE and modENCODE pro-
jects, it is becoming increasingly important to be able to Visualize
and understand how these histone modiﬁcations interact with
each other (ENCODE, 2011). The importance of the combina-
torial nature of chromatin can be seen in the NuA4 complex in
human, a large multimeric complex that is involved in regulation
of transcription, cell-cycle and DNA repair. This complex has
seven chromatin binding domains, including two bromodo-
mains, two SANT domains, two chromodomains and a PHD
domain (Doyon et al., 2004). These domains could allow this
complex to bind simultaneously to histone tails containing
methylated lysines and arginines, acetylated lysines as well as,
deacetylated histone tails. This suggests that the targeting of

Understanding the combinatorial histone code at functional elements

 

this complex would require a special arrangement of modiﬁca-
tions across several nucleosomes, and demonstrates the need for
studying chromatin architecture across numerous covalent modi-
ﬁcations. To address the difﬁculties involved in interpreting
multidimensional datasets, we have implemented a novel
method that integrates numerous chromatin datasets across a
variety of platforms into a simple chromatin alphabet. Using
our chromatin alphabet, we have been able to identify chromatin
motifs for functional regions, deﬁne TF+nucleosome associations
and uncover novel chromatin architectures for introns, ACS,
tRNAs, DHS, DSB Hotspots and antisense transcripts.

Current approaches addressing interpretation of combinator-
ial covalent modiﬁcations in the human genome, such as
ChomHMM and Seqway, show that genome-wide analysis of
multiple modiﬁcations is feasible (Ernst and Kellis, 2012;
Hoffman et al., 2012). The advantage of our approach is the
identification of similar functional elements by their chromatin
architecture, the eventual development of BLAST-like algo-
rithms and identiﬁcation of biologically important chromatin
attributes by sequence alignment. As the number of genome-
wide datasets increases, our technique can be readily applied
while simultaneously incorporating older datasets from a variety
of platforms. Future applications of our chromatin sequence al-
phabet will allow for the development of a human chromatin
alphabet using the substantial amount of data generated by the
ENCODE project (ENCODE, 2011).

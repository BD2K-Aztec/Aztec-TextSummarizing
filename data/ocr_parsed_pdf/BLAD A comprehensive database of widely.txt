sequence database is also provided. The current version of
BLAD holds ~2000 gene sequences along with ~200 crystal
structures for different types of beta—lactamases. All the
data were collected from literature, NCBI, protein data
bank (Sussman et al., 1998) and other authentic resources
(Supplementary Fig. S1).

3 DATABASE INTERFACE AND TOOLS

BLAD was built on Apache server 2.2.11 (http://www.apache.
org/) with Hypertext preprocessor program PHP (http://www.
php.net/). The database tables were stored in MySQL 5.0 rela—
tional database. This database has six options for users.
(i) Home: Provides the basic introduction about the beta—
lactamases. (ii) Database: Users can use this option for searching
the gene query of their interests. (iii) Resistance Pattern: Provides
the information about the resistance pattern of each query.
(iv) PDBS: This is used to search and analyze the 3D structure
of beta—lactamase. (v) Contacts: Provides the contact address of
the developer. (vi) Feedback: Allows the users to send the sug—
gestions and comments for the further development of this data—
base. BLAD can be searched using class, type, variant, organism,
country, resistance type as keywords. The search output includes
a summary table (Supplementary Fig. S2a41) for all the matched
entries. We have also integrated the bioinformatics tools as
BLADrestrict and BLAST for analyzing the sequences.

4 DISCUSSION AND FUTURE PROSPECTS

BLAD is the ﬁrst comprehensive database especially developed
to catalog, and categorize, the resistance pattern about all classes
of beta—lactamases identified by experimental studies. It also pro—
vides the information about the 3D structure along with the
physiochemical properties of bound ligands. This database is
equipped with ﬂexible search features including user—friendly
browse and hypertext link—outs to nucleotide and protein
sequence databases. We trust that BLAD will be a useful
platform for experimental and computational analyses of

beta—lactamases. Future update of BLAD will contain the infor—
mation about primers for each class and their variants. This
database will be updated manually by incorporating new data
and resources as soon as they become available.

ABSTRACT

Summary: The development of bioinformatic solutions for microbial
ecology in Perl is limited by the lack of modules to represent and
manipulate microbial community profiles from amplicon and meta-
omics studies. Here we introduce Bio-Community, an open-source,
collaborative toolkit that extends BioPerI. Bio-Community interfaces
with commonly used programs using various file formats, including
BIOM, and provides operations such as rarefaction and taxonomic
summaries. Bio-Community will help bioinformaticians to quickly
piece together custom analysis pipelines and develop novel software.
Availability an implementation: Bio-Community is cross-platform
Perl code available from http://search.cpan.org/dist/Bio-Community
under the Perl license. A readme file describes software installation
and how to contribute.

1 INTRODUCTION

Sequencing is common in most fields of biological research, and
the throughput of modern platforms is orders of magnitudes
higher than traditional Sanger sequencing (Metzker, 2010). The
BioPerl bioinformatic toolkit (Stajich et al., 2002) has attracted a
large community of users and developers and has become critical
in many sequencing projects by allowing quick code development
and interaction between programs using incompatible ﬁle for-
mats. In microbial ecology, sequencing is used routinely for 16S
rRNA gene amplicon surveys (Tringe and Hugenholtz, 2008),
metagenomics (Handelsman, 2004) and metatranscriptomics
(Frias-Lopez et al., 2008). Because most microorganisms remain
uncultivated (Rappé and Giovannoni, 2003), culture-independent
molecular surveys are essential for the characterization of envir-
onmental microbial communities. However, they require large
computational resources, novel bioinformatic tools and elaborate
pipelines. Many tools have been developed to analyze the resulting
sequence data. For example, libraries written in Python (Knight
et al., 2007) and R (Dixon, 2003; Kembel et al., 2010) provide
blocks for building bioinformatic software. QIIME (Caporaso
et al., 2010) and mothur (Schloss et al., 2009) are dedicated pack-
ages with scripts to build complete analysis pipelines, but they use
incompatible file formats. Here, we introduce Bio-Community, a

set of format-agnostic modules and scripts to parse and manipu-
late taxonomic or functional microbial community profiles.

2 FEATURES

2.1 Object model

Bio-Community is a Perl object-oriented toolkit that extends
BioPerl. It is centered around the Communi ty object, which con-
tains a group of entities from the same geographic area (Fig. 1).
These entities are Member objects, representing individual gen-
omes, genes, taxa or operational taxonomic units from amplicon
and meta-omic surveys. Member objects store attributes such as an
identiﬁer, a taxon or a sequence and can be given weights to ac-
count for the fact that there is no one-to-one relationship between a
sequencing read and a microbial cell. The relative abundance or
abundance rank of a Member can be calculated based on this
Member’s count, weight and the total count in the Communi ty
(Fig. 2). Similarly, absolute abundance is based on total microbial
abundance in the community, quantiﬁable by epiﬁuorescence mi-
croscopy, qPCR or ﬂow cytometry (Rinsoz et al., 2008).

2.2 Diversity metrics

Bio-Community quantiﬁes community a, )3 and y diversity
(Whittaker, 1972) using a range of metrics [reviewed by
Magurran (2004)]. The diversity of a single Communi ty
object, a diversity, is represented by metrics of richness, evenness,
dominance and indices (Supplementary Table S1). Several
Communi ty objects can be grouped into a Meta object, repre-
senting a metacommunity (Leibold et al., 2004). This object pro-
vides methods to measure y diversity, i.e. the collective diversity
of its communities, and )3 diversity, i.e. their dissimilarity. The y
metrics are the same as those available for a diversity, whereas
those for )3 diversity include qualitative and quantitative forms
(Supplementary Table S1).

2.3 Data input and output

Community proﬁles (e. g. a site-by-species table) describe the dis-
tribution of members in biological samples. Operations to read
and write these files are handled by the IO module and are im-
portant for exchanging data between programs using different
formats. We have implemented parsers for five common ﬁle
types (Supplementary Table S2), including the BIOM standard
(McDonald et al., 2012). Examples of these ﬁle types are given in
the t/data folder of the Bio-Community package. The parsers
automatically detect ﬁle format based on its content using the

2.4 Tools

Tool modules can perform operations such as community trans-
formation, rarefaction and taxonomic summaries (Fig. 1). Utility
scripts using these modules are available in Bio-Community
(Supplementary Table S3). They allow biologists to perform spe-
ciﬁc operations on community profiles, but they do not form an
entire microbial analysis pipeline. These scripts can also be re-
garded as examples of integration of Bio-Community into bio-
informatic scripts (Fig. 3). This integration can also leverage
external modules to rapidly develop powerful custom scripts,
e. g. Getopt::Euclid for handling command-line arguments,
BioPerl modules for reading sequences or running external pro-
grams (e. g. BLAST) (Camacho et al, 2009) and StatisticszzR for
using R libraries or Visualization capabilities.

3 CONCLUSIONS

Bio-Community provides several ﬁle formats to interface with
popular programs and will help bioinformaticians quickly

construct custom analysis pipelines or novel software for micro-
bial ecology. The integration of relative and absolute abundance
with diversity metrics permits holistic microbial studies (Dinsdale
et al, 2008; Dove et al, 2013; Nathani et al, 2013), while weights
can be added to account for gene copy number (Kembel et al,
2012) or genome length (Angly et al, 2009; Beszteri et al, 2010)
bias. We encourage programmers to join the development of Bio-
Community at https://github.com/bioperl/Bio-Community and
to add support for new file formats, diversity metrics or tools.

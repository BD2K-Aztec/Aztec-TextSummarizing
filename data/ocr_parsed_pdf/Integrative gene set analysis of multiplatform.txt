which uses a logistic regression with all multi—platform values of a
gene as predictors and takes the model deviances as the gene
scores for downstream gene set analysis (Tyekucheva et al.,
2011). Bayesian methods have also been developed to analyze
multi—platform genomic data, e. g. iBAG (Wang et al., 2013) and
PARADIGM (Vaske et al., 2010). Compared with traditional
gene set methods, Bayesian methods often use extensive know—
ledge of the biological relationships among different data plat—
forms and/or the interactions between studied genes.

Sample heterogeneity refers to molecular and cellular differ—
ences among biological samples. Such differences are commonly
encountered in complex diseases like cancer, where cases with
different genotypes, genomic copy numbers or expression pat—
terns often lead to different disease progressions and treatment
strategies (Fisher et al., 2013; Russnes et al., 2011). Several meth—
ods have been developed to address sample heterogeneity, e.g.
cancer outlier profile analysis (MacDonald and Ghosh, 2006),
outlier sum (Tibshirani and Hastie, 2007), outlier robust t—statis—
tics (ORT) (Wu, 2007), cancer likelihood ratio statistics (LRS)
(Hu, 2008) and non—parametric change—point statistics (Wang
et al., 2011). Although the superiority of these methods over
ordinary analysis has been demonstrated with heterogeneous
data in a single platform, to the best of our knowledge, there
are no corresponding gene set approaches for multi—platform
heterogeneous data. The impact of sample heterogeneity on
multi—platform analyses can be more substantial than on single
platform analyses. First, the level of heterogeneity can be differ—
ent from platform to platform, e.g. platforms such as somatic
mutations and DNA methylation have much higher diversity
(heterogeneity) among individuals and samples than DNA
copy number (Aryee et al., 2013; Chin et al., 2011). In addition,
the heterogeneous subsets can be different from one platform to
another, e.g. some samples might have changes on platform A
but no changes on platform B, whereas different subsets of sam—
ples have changes on platform B but not on platform A. Such a
scenario may lead to power loss due to the attenuation of signals
when the association is evaluated across platforms. In contrast, a
multi—platform method that can tackle platform—specific hetero—
geneous data would be able to identify the signals when integrat—
ing information across platforms.

In this study, we perform simulation studies to systematically
evaluate different integrative methods under a range of scenarios.
We observe that the true—positive rates (TPR) and the true—
negative rates of existing multi—platform gene set methods decrease
dramatically when heterogeneity exists. These results motivated us
to construct three methods to account for sample heterogeneity in
multi—platform gene set analysis: multi—platform ManniWhitney
statistics (MPMWS), multi—platform outlier robust T—statistics
(MPORT) and multi—platform likelihood ratio statistics
(MPLRS). We use simulations and real data analyses to demon—
strate the utility of these methods under various conditions.

2 METHODS

2.1 TCGA datasets

We downloaded the TCGA breast cancer data from the National Cancer
Institute ftp site in January 2013. We focused on the level 3 gene summary
data from RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), methylation and copy number

variation (CNV) and extracted 530 common samples (480 case samples
and 50 control samples) and 10 371 common genes shared among the
three platforms. For RNA-Seq data, the log2 reads per kilo base per million
were used as gene expression values. Before the log2 transformation, a
minimal value (0.0001) was added to prevent inﬁnite values. For methyla-
tion, the mean beta values of all of the probes mapped to a gene were ﬁrst
computed and then converted into an M value for each gene (Du et al.,
2010). The CNV values were provided in log2 format. Within each plat-
form, the data were standardized to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1.
The TCGA breast cancer data were used to perform simulations and a real
data analysis. We also performed a data analysis on the TCGA Kidney
Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (KIRC) dataset, for which we applied the same
procedures of data processing and obtained 486 common samples (463 case
samples and 23 control samples) and 11 182 common genes shared among
the three platforms of methylation, CNV and RNA-Seq data.

2.2 Simulations design

We generated simulated data based on the TCGA breast cancer dataset,
which contains 480 cancer samples and 50 control samples (i.e. the case
proportion 17 = 91%). First, we created 207 non-overlapping gene sets by
randomly drawing genes from the 10 371 genes without replacement. The
sizes of the 207 gene sets were randomly determined based on the size
distribution of the MSigDB canonical pathways (Subramanian et al.,
2005). The genomic data for cases and controls were simulated using
the scheme described in the Tyekucheva study (Tyekucheva et al.,
2011). In short, we ﬁrst shufﬂed the casewontrol labels to remove any
association that may exist in the original data. Then, we randomly se-
lected 10 gene sets as causal gene sets and ‘spiked in’ signals into the
causal gene sets as detailed below. We performed 300 replicates for each
simulation scenario.

(A) Simulation with homogenous samples. Given a causal gene set, we
randomly selected 01% (25, 50 or 75%) of the genes as causal genes. For
each causal gene, one platform was randomly selected as causal and Ak
was added to the genomic values of the causal platform for cases. The
value of Ak was derived such that the two-sample t-test between cases
and controls had power )3 (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 or 0.9).

(B) Simulation with heterogeneous samples. We considered two scen-
arios (referred to as Scenarios B1 and B2) to simulate datasets with
sample heterogeneity. In Scenario B1, we followed the simulation
scheme for Scenario A, except we randomly selected y% (20, 40, 60,
80, 90 or 100%) of the case samples as ‘true’ cases for each causal
gene. In other words, we only ‘spiked in’ Ak signals into the (randomly
selected) causal platform of the causal gene for the ‘true’ cases. Because
the causal platform of a causal gene was randomly selected, the causal
genes in a platform are different from each other (although there may be
some overlaps).

In Scenario B1, there is only a single causal platform for each causal
gene for the ‘true’ cases. In real biological situations, we often see genes
that have changes in multiple platforms. To account for these scenarios,
we considered Scenario B2, in which each causal gene is allowed to have
changes in more than one platform. Speciﬁcally, let w be the number of
causal platforms of a casual gene; then, the probability of w = (1, 2, 3) is
(4/ 8, 3 / 8, 1 / 8), respectively. That is, we ﬁrst determined the number of
causal platforms from binomial (3, 1/2) and then converted w = 0 to
w = 1. We then added Ak values to the genomic data of the causal
platform(s) of a causal gene for the ‘true’ cases.

2.3 Multi-platform methods for gene set analysis without
sample heterogeneity

The general steps of integrative gene set analysis start with computing gene-

speciﬁc association scores (gene scores in short) of multi-platform data and

then using these scores to perform gene set analysis. For the gene set ana-

lysis, we conducted the gene set tests using R function ‘geneSetTest’

Integrative gene set analysis of multi-platform data with sample heterogeneity

 

from the R/Bioconductor package ‘limma’ (Smyth, 2005) and obtained
P-values for each gene set. The ranks of the gene scores were used instead
of the actual scores (Michaud et al., 2008). We selected different thresholds
of P-value cutoff and computed the TPR, i.e. the percentage of the causal
gene sets truly identiﬁed, and the false-positive rate, i.e. the percentage of
non-causal gene sets falsely identiﬁed as causal gene sets. We plotted the
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to compare the perform-
ances of the different methods using R. Below; we describe how different
methods obtain the multi-platform gene scores considered in the simulation
study.

0 Integrative (INT) analysis (Tyekucheva et al., 2011):
For each gene, regress the disease status on the genomic variables
from all platforms using a logistic regression model. The multi-plat-
form gene scores are computed by taking the differences of the de-
viances between the null models (excluding genomic predictors) and
the full models (including all genomic predictors).

Hotelling’s T2 (HT2):

For each gene, perform the Hotelling’s T2 test to conduct a casei
control comparison using the genomic variables from all platforms
(Xiong et al., 2002). The multi-platform gene scores are the
Hotelling’s T2 statistics.

SumZ (Xiong et al., 2012):

For each gene at each platform, calculate the association score (I-
statistics). Next, use permutations to obtain the null distribution of
the t-statistics within each platform. Then, standardize the t-statistics
of each gene based on the null distributions. Finally, for each gene,
obtain the gene scores by taking the sum of the standardized values
across different platforms.

0 Deviance summarization:

For each gene at each platform, ﬁt the logistic regression under the
null model (i.e. excluding the genomic variable) and under the full
model (i.e. including the genomic variable). Next, obtain the devi-
ance difference between the two models. Finally, for each gene, take
the average of the deviance difference across platforms as the multi-
platform gene scores (referred to as AveD). The method of MaxD is
obtained in the same manner except that the maximum is used rather
than the average.

Single platform method (benchmark):

For each gene at each platform, perform the same analysis as
described in ‘deviance summarization’. Then, obtain the single-plat-
form gene scores by taking the deviance difference between the null
model and the full model. We applied this strategy on methylation,
CNV and RNA-Seq expression platforms and referred to the corres-
ponding methods as Methy, CNV and Exp, respectively.

2.4 Multi-platform methods for gene set analysis
accounting for sample heterogeneity

We constructed three multi-platform methods to address sample hetero-
geneity. Speciﬁcally, we extended two current methods designed for single
platform analysis to the multi-platform setting, i.e. MPORT [based on
ORT of Wu (2007)] and MPLRS [based on LRS of Hu (2008)]. We also
developed a non-parametric method, MPMWS, which obtains the gene
scores based on the Mann7Whitney statistics and does not assume sym-
metric distributions for the genomic variables.

The general procedure of multi-platform heterogeneous methods is as
follows. Assume that there are M genes and L platforms measured from
no control samples and n1 case samples (i.e. in total, n = no + m samples).
Let Ximg be the observed value of the genomic variable for gene m and
platform (3 of sample 1'. For each gene, use the single platform method to
compute association statistic ng for platform 6. Next, similar to the
SumZ method, use permutations to obtain a null distribution of the

statistics for platform 6. Finally, calculate the standardized gene statistics
within platform 6, denoted by Tr’nl, using the mean and standard devi-
ation (denoted by E and 5.7, respectively) obtained from the permuted
null distribution, i.e.

Tint = (Tml — T—7)/S.7. + c] (1)

As is done in the SumZ implementation, these scores are made positive by
adding a constant, c], that is the absolute value of the most negative score
across the platform. This translation makes all of the TmZ values positive
but does not change the shape of their distribution. Then, the sum of the
standardized gene statistics from each platform deﬁnes the multi-platform
gene scores:

L
6.. = 2 Ta- (2)
7:1
The MPORT, MPLRS and MPMWS methods differ only in how Tm; is
obtained. We show the formula for computing ng when detecting
‘upregulated’ genes. (Here, the term ‘upregulated’ indicates the increase
of numerical values rather than the biological ‘turning on’ of the gene.)
The approaches can be extended to detecting downregulated genes by
reversing the signs of the observed values.

0 MPORT: TM is computed using the ORT method (Wu, 2007). For
each gene at each platform, calculate the mean absolute deviance
(MAD) by MAD = 1.4286 >< median(z,»m7), where

where I(A) is an indicator function of event A, q75¢m is the 75th

upregulated genes, the genomic data are sorted from the smallest to
the largest under the constraint that all controls are ranked lower

than cases.

o MPMWS: TM is computed using the non-parametric Mann7

CPM (Ross, 2013; Ross et al., 2011). The genomic data are sorted
from the smallest to the largest under the constraint that all controls
are ranked lower than cases; the Mann7Whitney U statistic, Ukmg,
for each case sample is computed; and TM is selected as the largest

2.5 Real data analysis

We performed real data analysis using the methods that have the best
performances in the simulation studies (i.e. MPMWS and INT). The 1452
pathways in MSigDB were tested using both the breast cancer and the

Integrative gene set analysis of multi-platform data with sample heterogeneity

 

and the percentage of ‘true’ cases among all cases varies, i.e.
y=(100, 90, 80, 60, 40 and 20%). The corresponding AUC
values are presented in Supplementary Table S1B. We see that
INT and SumZ, which are designed for multi—platform homoge—
neous data, quickly lost power as y decreased. In contrast,
MPLRS and MPMWS retained good power when y decreased.
However, the relative performance between MPLRS and
MPMWS depended on y. When y was low (e. g. 540%),
MPLRS performed the best; when y was 60%, MPLRS and
MPMWS had similar power. However, when y was high (e.g.
3 80%), MPLRS had less TPRs than MPMWS, sometimes even
less than INT. MPORT performed inferior to MPLRS and
MPMWS, and its power advantages over INT and SumZ did
not show until y became small, i.e. ~2(P40%. Because y is un—
known in practice, MPMWS appears to be the most robust
choice; it yielded the highest or the second highest TPRs regard—
less of the y values. Although the method is designed to account
for sample heterogeneity, it had similar power to INT when
samples were homogeneous (y: 100%). This behavior is likely
attributable to the fact that the genomic variables of certain plat—
forms tended to deviate away from normal distributions, e.g.
methylation values, and the non—parametric MPMWS is robust
against non—normality. Finally, the improved TPR obtained
using MPLRS and MPMWS with heterogeneous samples was
observed when we repeated the analysis for a = 50% and n = 0.5
(Supplementary Fig. S4) and 0.1 (Supplementary Fig. S5).

By design, INT is good at identifying pathways with system—
atic changes, whereas MPMWS has robust power to detect path—
ways involving sample heterogeneity. In Table 1, we show the

number of signiﬁcant pathways and the number of true—positive
(TP) pathways identified by INT and MPMWS. We observe that
both methods identiﬁed many common significant/TP pathways.
In addition, there was a high percentage of TPs among the
common signiﬁcant pathways, especially when the heterogeneity
level was not extremely high. The results also show that each
method identiﬁed some unique signiﬁcant/TP pathways that
were missed by the other method. For INT, the proportion of
TPs among the unique pathways became smaller as the hetero—
geneity increased. For MPMWS, the corresponding TP propor—
tion stayed roughly constant until severe heterogeneity (e. g.
y = 20%).

The analyses above were performed under Scenario B1, where
each causal gene only had one causal platform. We repeated the
same analyses under Scenario B2, where each causal gene had at
least 1 causal platform. We obtained similar results as observed
in Scenario B1 (Supplementary Fig. S6).

3.3 Real data application

We ﬁrst considered the TCGA breast cancer dataset containing
methylation, CNV and RNA—Seq measurements. We performed
multi—platform gene set analyses on the 1452 MSigDB pathways
using MPMWS and INT (i.e. the top two methods from
Scenarios B1 and B2). Unlike the simulated gene sets, pathways
in MSigDB often share common genes and can have signiﬁcant
overlaps. Figure 4 shows the number of pathways identiﬁed by
each method and their overlaps at false discovery rate (FDR)
0.05 using the Benjamini and Hochberg’s FDR procedure

Integrative gene set analysis of multi-platform data with sample heterogeneity

 

To address this issue, imputing can be used to ﬁll in the missing
values. Performing self—contained gene set analysis tests is an—
other strategy (Tyekucheva et al., 2011). Further research is
needed to characterize the patterns of missing data on different
platforms, understand their impact on the gene set analysis and
develop the proper statistical methods for missing data.

The R code for all of the methods and test datasets are avail—
able on the Web site: http://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~jytzeng/

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Enrichment tests are used in high-throughput
experimentation to measure the association between gene or
protein expression and membership in groups or pathways. The
Fisher’s exact test is commonly used. We specifically examined
the associations produced by the Fisher test between protein
identification by mass spectrometry discovery proteomics, and
their Gene Ontology (GO) term assignments in a large yeast
dataset. We found that direct application of the Fisher test is
misleading in proteomics due to the bias in mass spectrometry to
preferentially identify proteins based on their biochemical properties.
False inference about associations can be made if this bias is
not corrected. Our method adjusts Fisher tests for these biases
and produces associations more directly attributable to protein
expression rather than experimental bias.

Results: Using logistic regression, we modeled the association
between protein identification and GO term assignments while
adjusting for identification bias in mass spectrometry. The
model accounts for five biochemical properties of peptides:
(i) hydrophobicity, (ii) molecular weight, (iii) transfer energy, (iv) beta
turn frequency and (v) isoelectric point. The model was fit on 181 060
peptides from 2678 proteins identified in 24 yeast proteomics
datasets with a 1% false discovery rate. In analyzing the association
between protein identification and their GO term assignments, we
found that 25% (134 out of 544) of Fisher tests that showed
significant association (q-value 50.05) were non-significant after
adjustment using our model. Simulations generating yeast protein
sets enriched for identification propensity show that unadjusted
enrichment tests were biased while our approach worked well.

1 INTRODUCTION

Enrichment tests are commonly performed in high-throughput
discovery research such as mass spectrometry-based proteomics.
They are used, for instance, to determine the association between

whether a protein is expressed in a particular condition and
membership in a particular biologically relevant category such as
Gene Ontology (GO) term assignment. Discovery of signiﬁcant
associations, such as GO terms with over- or underrepresentation
of expressed proteins, then provide new hypotheses and directions
for ﬁirther research. These enrichment tests are commonly carried
out by using Fisher’s exact or chi-square tests (Curtis et al., 2005).
These are the most basic of the enrichment tests; others have been
proposed such as gene set enrichment analysis (Subramanian et al.,
2005). However, given their clear-cut nature Fisher’s exact tests are
still often applied and are considered robust enough to be used as a
guide or ranking mechanism for biological categories of proteins in
discovery research.

Mass spectrometry has now become the standard tool in
high-throughput discovery proteomics. It enables measurement of
expressed proteins (as opposed to gene sequences) that control and
enable most biological processes (Kolker et (11., 2006; Pandey and
Mann, 2000). Research studies will often compare the distribution of
expressed proteins in a given set of conditions or between organisms
(Schrimpf et al., 2009). The problem with analyzing proteomics
data, however, is the bias in how proteins are identiﬁed; which is
a function of their biochemical properties (Braisted et (11., 2008;
Mallick et al., 2007). These biases can affect tests of enrichment
for expressed proteins within proteins sets and produce misleading
biological conclusions in discovery proteomics studies if they are
not accounted for.

To address this, we demonstrate an approach to adjust Fisher’s
exact tests speciﬁcally for protein identiﬁcation bias. Our approach
is similar to ‘propensity scores’, developed for observational
studies in epidemiology, to adjust comparisons due to confounding
variables possibly associated with grouping and outcome variables
(Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1983). This helps avoid ﬁnding spurious
relationships between study groups. Propensity scores are used by
building a model to predict the probability that an object has a given
outcome based on potentially confounding variables (covariates).
They are then used to create strata that are balanced by their
covariates. In our case, the study groups are the protein categories
(GO terms) and the response variable is protein identiﬁcation
by mass spectrometry. We used logistic regression to model
the relationship between protein identiﬁcation, protein GO term
assignment and propensity scores of proteins assigned to the GO
term (see Section 2). Our method is different from those which adjust
enrichment P-values by accounting for the hierarchical relationships

between GO terms (Alexa et (11., 2006; Falcon and Gentleman, 2007)
and not for protein propensities.

When we analyzed a large yeast proteomics dataset, we found
that many signiﬁcant associations between GO terms and protein
identiﬁcations found using the Fisher’s exact test were actually not
signiﬁcant by our method. In addition, some non-signiﬁcant Fisher’s
exact tests became signiﬁcant by our method, but the number was
smaller. Given these results we believe that our method produces
associations which are more directly attributable to true differences
in protein expression between categories rather than the inherent
experimental bias in discovery proteomics.

2 METHODS

2.1 Mass spectrometry discovery datasets

A total of 24 mass spectrometry discovery datasets in yeast were obtained
from the Open Proteomics Database. Peptidome and PeptideAtlas and
searched against the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) (Hong et (11..
2008). Datasets were analyzed as in our previous publication (Higdon et (11..
2010). The data were input to the SPIRE proteomics pipeline with false
discovery rates (FDRs) estimated on a randomized database approach using
isotonic regression (Hather et (11.. 2010). Proteins with FDRs ﬁxed at 1%
were combined across experiments.

Of 6717 proteins (open reading frames) from the SGD there were 2678
identiﬁed at 1% FDR. within the 24 datasets. We generated fully tryptic
peptides from these 2678 proteins for a total of 273 270 peptides. A total
of 35 properties (e.g. hydrophobicity) were then determined for the peptides
(Braisted 21111.. 2008). Peptides were then ﬁltered to only retain peptides with
molecular weights between 530 and 3326 Da. which were the minimum and
maximum molecular weights actually identiﬁed in the experiments. This
resulted in 181 068 ﬁnal peptides which were separated into equal size test
and training sets by random sampling.

2.2 Peptide and protein identiﬁcation model

We developed a logistic model to represent the bias in mass spectrometry to
preferentially identify peptides with particular biochemical properties. Our
model for peptide identiﬁcation is:

idPﬁP N mWPCP + hydpep + plpep + btpep + tepep (1)

where idpep is the probability (logit) of a peptide identiﬁcation based on
the molecular weight (mw). hydrophobicity (hyd). pl (isoelectric point).
frequency of beta turn (bt) and transfer energy (te) of the peptide. These
were determined from the AAindex (Kawashima and Kanehisa. 2000).

The ﬁve predictors were selected based on hierarchical clustering
(R hclust function). Many of the possible 35 predictors were highly
correlated (Supplementary Material). which left us with the choice of the
remaining ﬁve. Amixed model with proteins as arandom effect was evaluated
to estimate possible differences in peptide properties while accounting for
differences in protein concentrations. There was little difference in the
ﬁts between the mixed model and a model ignoring protein membership.
indicating little variation in the peptide properties of proteins across different
concentrations.

Protein propensities were determined by aggregating the propensities of
their tryptic peptides using the following formula:

propenSityprotein = _10g  1 — idpeptides) (2)

where idpeplides are the peptide identiﬁcation probabilities associated with
a given protein determined from the above peptide identiﬁcation model.
We considered a number of different summarization methods but chose this
approach because it was most highly associated with protein identiﬁcation
and produced the most normally distributed protein propensity scores. All
models were ﬁt using the glm function in the R statistical package.

2.3 Unadjusted enrichment tests

Unadjusted enrichment tests to determine odds ratios (ORs) and P-Values for
annotation categories were performed using two-sided Fisher’s exact tests
as reviewed in (Curtis et (11.. 2005). Categories correspond to GO terms
assigned to proteins as determined by the SGD. Note the basic equivalence
between Fisher’s exact. chi-square and likelihood ratio tests based on logistic
regression for large sample sizes (McCullagh and Nelder. 1989). The null
hypothesis for these tests is that the proportions (distributions) between two
variables (e.g. has GO term or not) are the same. Also note the hierarchy of
the GO should be accounted for (Falcon and Gentleman. 2007). To account
for the GO hierarchy. children of parent terms were included in counts to
satisfy the ‘true path rule” of the G0.

2.4 Adjusted enrichment tests

We developed a second logistic model that represents our method for
adjusting enrichment tests. The formula for the model is:

idprot N categoryprot + propenSityprot (3)

where idpm is the probability (logit) that a protein is identiﬁed. the coefﬁcient
for the category term corresponds to the adjusted (log) OR of the protein
category (GO term) after adjusting for the propensity of the proteins
associated with that term to be identiﬁed (the propensity term). A P-Value
is associated with the OR of the category term. The model was ﬁt using the
glm function in R.

2.5 Adjusting for multiple testing

P-Values for unadjusted and adjusted enrichment tests were converted to (1-
Values using the R q-Value package (Storey and Tibshirani. 2003). Q-Values
50.05 were considered signiﬁcant. Differences in ORs between adjusted and
unadjusted tests were also calculated. Enrichment tests where the number of
proteins (identiﬁed or not) under consideration were <10 were excluded.

3 RESULTS

The peptide model developed on the training set indicated that
mass spectrometry indeed preferentially identiﬁes peptides with
particular properties, with molecular weight and hydrophobicity
having the largest inﬂuence. Model selection on the test dataset
indicated that a model with quadratic terms (with the exception
of hydrophobicity) provided superior performance over a model
with linear terms by receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve
analysis (Supplementary Material). This is to be expected given
the relationship between many of the peptide properties and the
probability of peptide identiﬁcation (Fig. 1). As a validity check
of our peptide model, predicted probabilities from our model were
compared with a model using a ‘random forest’ approach, the
enhanced signature peptide predictor (ESP) (Fusaro et (11., 2009).
ROC curve analysis indicated that our logistic model outperformed
the random forest model (area under the curve 76.5% versus 66.9%).
Possible explanations could be overﬁtting or high correlation
between peptide properties, indicating non-independence between
variables. Also, the ESP model was not developed speciﬁcally for
shotgun proteomics and is possibly inappropriate in our scenario.
Developing and training our own model was therefore a logical
choice. Another advantage of our logistic model it that it is easier
to deduce that molecular weight and hydrophobicity have by far the
most inﬂuence on the probability of peptide identiﬁcation by mass
spectrometry.

For protein propensity scores, the propensity for each protein was
determined by aggregating the predicted probabilities of its tryptic

peptides (see Section 2). Statistical analysis (using another logistic
model) indicated a 6.2% increase in the odds of identifying a protein
per unit increase in their propensity score.

To compare unadjusted versus adjusted tests, q-values for all GO
terms for identiﬁed and not identiﬁed proteins were determined (see
Section 2). Terms were from all three GO ontologies: GO cellular
component (CC), GO biological process (BP) and GO molecular
ﬁmction (MF). The incorrect assumption in unadjusted enrichment
tests is that a signiﬁcant result reﬂects the true difference in protein

expression for proteins assigned a particular GO term. We know that
is not true since we have seen that mass spectrometry preferentially
identiﬁes certain proteins (Fig. 1). In Figure 2, we illustrate the
difference in q-values between unadjusted and adjusted enrichment
tests for all applicable GO terms in our study as well as the absolute
percent change in the ORs for GO terms. Out of 1587 terms (326 CC,
904 BP, 357 MF) 29 had signiﬁcant enrichment tests (q-value £0.05)
in the adjusted test and not signiﬁcant in the unadjusted test, and
134 terms were not signiﬁcant in the adjusted test and signiﬁcant in
the unadjusted test. In all, 134 out 544 (25%) originally signiﬁcant
unadjusted tests became non-signiﬁcant when adjusting for protein
propensity. Overall, the tendency was for enrichment tests to become
non-signiﬁcant after adjustment (34.3% versus 27.7% signiﬁcant).
Note, however, that the decrease in the number of signiﬁcant tests
would tend to increase q-values in general since the denominator in
the FDR would tend to be smaller. All test results are provided as
Supplementary Material.

Speciﬁc examples of GO terms with P and q-values which
changed from signiﬁcant to non-signiﬁcant and vice versa can be
found in Table 1. All terms are associated with proteins with much
higher or lower propensity to be identiﬁed by mass spectrometry
than average. For instance, GO:0005815 (mitochondrial organizing
center) contains GO terms that have lower propensity scores
than average (Z-score = —2.55). Our method produces a signiﬁcant
P-value for this term versus a non-signiﬁcant P-value from a
Fisher’s exact test (0.01 versus 0.07). In contrast, for GO:0006418
(tRNA aminoacylation for protein translation...) a Fisher’s exact test
produces a signiﬁcant result versus a non-signiﬁcant result with our
method (0.02 versus 0.10). Proteins associated with this GO term
have higher propensity scores than average (Z-score = 0.93) and are
more likely to be identiﬁed. See Table 1 for examples of unadjusted
versus adjusted tests for GO terms from all three ontologies.

Adjusting is clearly more necessary when protein sets are
enriched in terms of identiﬁcation propensity. We simulated

protein datasets that were enriched for identiﬁcation propensity by
randomly selecting proteins with higher than average propensity. We
performed 1000 simulations based on protein sets of size 25, 50 and
100. The sets on average did not have increased protein expression
as measure by tandem afﬁnity puriﬁcation and green ﬂuorescent
protein (Ghaemmaghami et a1., 2003) as the correlation between
propensities and concentration was small (actually slightly negative
at —0.07). Unadjusted enrichment tests were severely biased toward
being statistically signiﬁcant with l2—44% having P-values <0.05.
Adjusted enrichment tests have very near nominal levels of P-values
(4—6% with P-values <0.05). Similar results were obtained for
below average propensity datasets (see Supplementary Material for
full details).

4 DISCUSSION

We introduce here a discovery proteomics data analysis method
for performing accurate tests of enrichment for expressed proteins
by adjusting for the bias in mass spectrometry to identify
proteins with particular biochemical properties. The fact that
mass spectrometry instruments preferentially identify proteins has
been studied previously (Braisted et a1., 2008; Fusaro et a1.,
2009). To our knowledge, however, no one before has used
this information to adjust enrichment tests to more accurately
determine which categories of proteins are signiﬁcantly associated
with over- or underrepresentation of expressed proteins. Our
approach theoretically works on any type of protein category:
GO terms, KEGG pathways or otherwise. It is certainly logical
from a biological standpoint that proteins with similar biochemical
properties associate in similar categories. Very hydrophobic proteins
for example often tend to be associated with cell membranes
(e.g. GO:0015075 in Table 1). It is these biochemical properties
that translate into varying propensities for identiﬁcation in mass
spectrometry and make adjusting enrichment tests necessary to
avoid incorrect conclusions of biological signiﬁcance in discovery
proteomics experiments.

We emphasize again that previous methods to adjust the
signiﬁcance of enrichment tests on GO terms do so in an entirely
different manner than our approach. These other methods work by
‘de-correlating’ related GO terms in various ways by accounting
for the relationships between GO terms (Alexa et a1., 2006; Falcon
and Gentleman, 2007). Unlike their approach, we adjust for the
nature of the data itself by considering the propensity of some
proteins to be preferentially identiﬁed in mass-spectrometry. Also,

the ﬁmctionality of these previous methods is largely conﬁned to
the GO (or produces trivial results on non-hierarchical categories),
whereas our method is category independent. For instance, it works
on KEGG pathways that are not hierarchically structured. Although
a caveat with our method may be that it is speciﬁcally designed for
mass spectrometry data, mass spectrometry has basically become
the stande method in discovery proteomics. Also, despite the fact
that we have applied our method to protein identiﬁcation, it is
relevant for comparing quantitative expression. This is due to the
fact that the inherent bias in how proteins are identiﬁed remains
true in how they are quantiﬁed (e.g. using spectral counts or total
ion current for determining their concentrations). Adjusting for
identiﬁcation bias is obviously less relevant for relative expression
since comparisons are made between identical sequences across
conditions. However, adjustment for identiﬁcation bias may improve
precision in measurements of protein expression by more optimally
weighting individual peptides thereby improving the power of tests
for relative expression.

So, it is apparent that na'1've application of enrichment tests
is problematic. Enrichment tests are intended to measure the
true difference in expression between protein sets not bias in
how proteins are measured. We would like to state here that
assessing the areas of possible variation and biases in data is
an important analytical exercise. Transparent statistical models in
research such as the logistic model that we have employed herein
can more clearly illuminate areas of variability and possible bias
(Higdon and Kolker, 2007; Higdon et a1., 2008; Louie et a1.,
2009). Also, all instrumentation methods certainly contain biases
in measurement; therefore, adaptations of our approach could be
applied to other high-throughput analysis approaches. Our intent
is to open the door to the possibilities of adjusting enrichment
tests for other sorts of data gathered by a myriad of various
means.

ABSTRACT

Summary: ChlP-based technology is becoming the leading
technology to globally profile thousands of transcription factors and
elucidate the transcriptional regulation mechanisms in living cells. It
has evolved rapidly in recent years, from hybridization with spotted
or tiling microarray (ChlP-chip), to pair-end tag sequencing (ChlP-
PET), to current massively parallel sequencing (ChlP-seq). Although
there are many tools available for identifying binding sites (peaks)
for ChlP-chip and ChlP-seq, few of them are available as easy-
accessible online web tools for processing both ChlP-chip and
ChlP-seq data for the ChlP-based user community. As such, we
have developed a comprehensive web application tool for processing
ChlP-chip and ChlP-seq data. Our web tool W-ChlPeaks employed
a probe-based (or bin-based) enrichment threshold to define peaks
and applied statistical methods to control false discovery rate for
identified peaks. The web tool includes two different web interfaces:
PELT for ChlP-chip, BELT for ChlP-seq, where both were tested on
previously published experimental data. The novel features of our
tool include a comprehensive output for identified peaks with GFF,
BED, bedGraph and .wig formats, annotated genes to which these
peaks are related, a graphical interpretation and visualization of the
results via a user-friendly web interface.

1 INTRODUCTION

ChIP-based technology is becoming the leading technology to
globally proﬁle thousands of transcription factors and elucidate
the transcriptional regulation mechanisms in living cells (Famham,
2009). It has evolved rapidly in recent years, from hybridization
with spotted or tiling microarray (ChIP-Chip) (Kim et al., 2005),
to pair-end tag sequencing (ChIP-PET) (Loh et al., 2006),
to current massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) (Johnson
et al., 2007). Despite the fact that microarray-based Chromatin
immuneprecipitation (ChIP) method, ChIP-Chip, is gradually being
replaced by the emerging sequencing-based method such as ChIP—
seq, both methods are currently being used in many laboratories as

a major tool to survey transcription factor binding patterns, study
various histone modiﬁcations in an unbiased manner.

Currently available tools for the ChIP-Chip data are exempliﬁed
and comprehensively compared in the Spike-In data (Johnson
et al., 2008). ChIP-seq technology and related computational
tools are also reviewed in Park (2009). CisGenome provided
an integrated analyzing software system for both technologies
(Ji et al., 2008). While we appreciate the accuracy and efﬁciency
of these tools, few of them are available as easy-accessible online
web tools for processing both ChIP-Chip and ChIP-seq data for
the ChIP-based user community. As such, we have developed a
comprehensive web application tool for processing ChIP-Chip and
ChIP-seq data. Our web tool W—ChIPeaks employed a probe-based
(or bin-based) enrichment threshold to deﬁne peaks and applied
statistical methods to control false discovery rate for identiﬁed
peaks. The web tool includes two different web interfaces: probe-
based enrichment threshold level (PELT) for ChIP-Chip and BELT
(bin-based enrichment threshold level) for ChIP-seq, where both
were tested on previously published experimental data.

2 METHODS

2.1 Overview

The utility and layout of the W—ChlPeaks is demonstrated in Figure l.
W—ChIPeaks provides a web-based interface with three main features:
identiﬁcation of peaks with GFF. BED. bedGraph and .wig formats.
annotated genes to which these peaks are related. annotated genes to which
these peaks are related. a graphical interpretation and Visualization of the
results Via a user-friendly web interface. The link of results will be emailed
to the address given in the contact information. For two or three ChlP-
chip datasets. a plot of overlapping comparison between datasets at different
threshold levels is also provided. Usage of W-ChIPeaks web service is simple
and does not require any knowledge of the underlying software.

2.2 Input

For ChIP-chip. there are three required inputs from the user: GFF ﬁles from
NimbleGen or Agilent Array (allow eight sets in maximum). the selection
of array types and genomes. and e-mail contact information; For ChIP-seq.
there are a few options and one required inputs from the user including Bland
and extended Eland for Illumia GAII. bowtie alignment output. BED. GFF.
SAM. or BAM format of aligned reads. and e-mail contact information.

2.3 Algorithms and statistical methods

2.3.] PELT We employed a probe-based enrichment threshold to deﬁne
peaks and a permutation-based statistical method to control false discovery
rate for identiﬁed peaks. Suppose for a sample with N probes (i = l,...,N)

on each array, after normalization of each array, a probe i on the array j has
an intensity: 1,7. For any particular peak Pk among B peaks, it is ﬁrst deﬁned
by a percentile level d based on a distribution of the probes, in which the
mean value of the peak intensity consisting of at least three probes in a row
has to be greater than the value of that percentile level d (for example, the
top 1, 2, or 5% of all probes on the array). We applied the permutation-based
approach to estimate the false discovery rate. We permutated each array,
and found the number of peaks at a percentile level d, and then repeated
the permutation process 1000 times, ﬁnally averaged the number of peaks
from these 1000 permutations. The number of peaks without permutation
at level d is considered as TP(d), and the average of the number of peaks
after permutations at the same level d is considered as FP(d). The FDR(d)
[FDR(d) =FP(d)/TP(d)] was then obtained at that level d.

2.3.2 BELT We employed a bin-based enrichment threshold to deﬁne
peaks and a Monte-Carlo simulation statistical method to control false
discovery rate for identiﬁed peaks. The BELT algorithm includes four steps:
(i) deﬁne a series of bin size by evenly dividing the genome varying from
100 bp to 500 bp, and counting the density of reads for each bin; (ii) calculate
an average length of ChIP fragments by considering the direction of the reads,
decoding the binding site position by shifting the reads (Zhang et al., 2008);
(iii) determine signiﬁcant enrichment threshold levels by a percentile rank
statistic method and (iv) Estimate false discovery rates by utilizing Monte
Carlo simulation for modeling background based on signal-noise-ratio of
ChIP-seq data. (Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Figure S1).

Scoring called peaks and estimation of FDR: A score for a called peak by
BELT is empirically deﬁned in Supplementary Methods formula (3) and is
used to rank the peaks. A FDR is estimated using Supplementary Methods
formulas (5) and (6).

Comparison with other ChIP-seq programs: The performance of BELT
was compared to four publicly available ChIP-seq programs: MACS, QUEST,
PeakSeq and SISSRs on four published datasets: CTCF, FOXAl, ER and
NRSF. The results of the number of overlapping peaks between BELT

and other programs showed that all of the overlap rates are over 74%
(Supplementary Figure S2A). A plot of the relative distance from the
predicted binding motif to the real motif showed our program has a similar
or higher accuracy than the other programs (Supplementary Figure S2B,
Supplementary Table S1).

2.4 Implementation
W—ChIPeaks was implemented with PHP, Perl, Java and C++.

2.5 Output

W—ChIPeaks has a comprehensive output for identiﬁed peaks with different
formats: GFF, BED, bedGraph and .wig ﬁles, annotated genes to which
these peaks are related, a graphical interpretation and Visualization for the
results. For two or three ChIP-chip datasets, a plot of overlapping comparison
between datasets at different threshold levels is also provided.

2.6 Sample test

The W—ChIPeaks was tested with different published datasets from the ChIP-
chip and ChIP-seq experiments. The array platform for ChIP-chip data is
from NimbleGen or Agilent Array Platform. Some of such datasets include
E2Fl (Jin et al., 2006), N-MYC (Cotterman et al., 2008), ZNF263 (Frietze
et al., 2010), PolH, H3K4m63 in K562 cell line (ENCODE consortium),
H3K9me2, H3Ac (Bapat et al., 2010) and results are available online at:

Abstract

Motivation: Metabolic pathways are an important class of molecular networks consisting of com—
pounds, enzymes and their interactions. The understanding of global metabolic pathways is ex—
tremely important for various applications in ecology and pharmacology. However, large parts of
metabolic pathways remain unknown, and most organism—specific pathways contain many missing
enzymes. Results: In this study we propose a novel method to predict the enzyme orthologs that
catalyze the putative reactions to facilitate the de novo reconstruction of metabolic pathways from
metabolome—scale compound sets. The algorithm detects the chemical transformation patterns of
substrate—product pairs using chemical graph alignments, and constructs a set of enzyme—specific
classifiers to simultaneously predict all the enzyme orthologs that could catalyze the putative reac—
tions of the substrate—product pairs in the joint learning framework. The originality of the method
lies in its ability to make predictions for thousands of enzyme orthologs simultaneously, as well as its
extraction of enzyme—specific chemical transformation patterns of substrate—product pairs. We dem—
onstrate the usefulness of the proposed method by applying it to some ten thousands of metabolic
compounds, and analyze the extracted chemical transformation patterns that provide insights into
the characteristics and specificities of enzymes. The proposed method will open the doorto both pri—
mary (central) and secondary metabolism in genomics research, increasing research productivity to
tackle a wide variety of environmental and public health matters.

1 Introduction

 

Metabolic pathways are an important class of molecular networks
that consist of chemical compounds (or metabolites), enzyme pro—
teins and their interactions. The understanding of global metabolic
pathways is extremely important for various applications in ecology
(Heidel—Fischer and Vogel, 2015) and pharmacology (Newman and
Cragg, 2012). However, large parts of metabolic pathways remain
unknown, and most organism—specific pathways contain many miss—
ing enzymes. For example, it is estimated that more than one million
compounds exist in the plant kingdom (Afendi et (11., 2012), al—
though the number of enzymes that are experimentally verified and

approved by the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular
Biology (IUBMB) is only approximately 5600 (McDonald and
Tipton, 2014). This indicates our lack of knowledge on enzymatic
reactions (Fig. 1a) . It is still difficult to experimentally verify en—
zyme functions in biological processes; thus, there is a strong need
for in silico metabolic pathway reconstruction (Karp, 2004).

A variety of methods have been developed for the in silico recon—
struction of metabolic pathways. They can be categorized into three
approaches (Fig. 1). The most traditional approach assigns putative
enzyme genes to appropriate positions in pre—defined reference path—
ways based on sequence homology with genes across different

tion by chemical structures, which is the focus of this study, enables the de
nova reconstruction of metabolic pathway by finding possible enzymes for
putative reactions involving orphan metabolites

organisms (Fig. 1b). This approach is useful for central metabolism
(often referred to as primary metabolism), which is common in
many organisms, and a number of software packages enabling this
approach, such as KAAS (Moriya et (11., 2007), MG—RAST (Meyer
et (11., 2008), Model SEED (Henry et (11., 2010), MEGAN (Huson
et (11., 2011), MAPLE (Takami et (11., 2012), BlastKOALA and
GhostKOALA (Kanehisa et (11., 2016), are available.

However, reference pathways are not available for most of the
surrounding metabolism (often referred to as secondary metabolism)
that forms a much larger part of the global metabolic pathway
(Fig. 13), because most of the compounds and enzymes are specific
to a limited number of organisms and are poorly characterized. This
secondary metabolism contains a vast number of ‘orphan metabol—
ites’, the compounds for which no enzymatic reactions or enzyme
proteins are yet known. Therefore, one of the challenging issues in
systems biology is the de novo reconstruction of global metabolic
pathways, i.e. identifying previously unknown reactions and en—
zymes that are not yet included in the reference pathway maps.

The de novo reconstruction of metabolic pathways has two
goals: (i) elucidation of putative reactions (previously unknown re—
actions) among compounds and (ii) elucidation of the associated en—
zymes catalyzing the putative reactions. Toward the first goal,
several in silico methods have been developed based on the chemical
structures of compounds by hypothesizing intermediate compounds
necessary between the source and target compounds (Darvas, 1988;
Ellis et (11., 2008; Faulon and Sault, 2001; Greene et (11., 1999;
Moriya et (11., 2010; Talafous et (11., 1994) or by predicting the en—
zymatic reaction—likeness among many compounds; that is, whether
given pairs of compounds can be chemically interconverted by single
enzymatic reactions (Hatzimanikatis et (11., 2005; Kotera et al.,

2008, 2013, 2014a; Nakamura et (11., 2012; Yamanishi et (11., 2015).
All of these previous methods fail to address the second goal, i.e. en—
zyme prediction for previously unknown reactions.

The use of genomic features and other omics data (gene orders,
phylogenetic profiles, gene expression profiles) is a possible ap—
proach to enzyme prediction (Enright et (11., 1999; Huynen et (11.,
2000; Kharchenko et (11., 2004; Marcotte et (11., 1999; Osterman
and Overbeek, 2003; Overbeek et (11., 1999; Yamanishi et (11.,
2007). However, this approach is applicable only to missing en—
zymes that are located near well—characterized enzymes on known
metabolic pathways (Fig. 1c), so it cannot handle reactions outside
of existing pathway maps.

Enzyme prediction is related to reaction classification. Previous
studies have focused on the automated classification of enzymatic
reactions from chemical structures (Egelhofer et (11., 2010; Hu et (11.,
2010; Kotera et (11., 2004; Latino and Aires—de Sousa, 2009;
Matsuta et (11., 2013; Nath and Mitchell, 2012; O’Boyle et (11., 2007;
Rahman et (11., 2014; Yamanishi et (11., 2009). All these previous
methods attempted to predict the Enzyme Commission (EC) num—
bers or sub—subclasses; that is, grouping enzymes by known reac—
tions. However, because of the principle of EC numbers and sub—
subclasses, it is not suitable to use them for predicting enzymes that
catalyze previously unknown reactions. Thus, the direct use of en—
zyme orthologs (grouping enzymes by sequence homology) is
required.

In this article, we propose a novel method for the de novo recon—
struction of metabolic pathways using metabolome—scale compound
sets (Fig. 1d). This approach enables the prediction of putative reac—
tion networks among compounds and the prediction of the associ—
ated enzyme orthologs catalyzing the putative reactions in a
seamless manner. We have already established an efficient super—
vised method that enables the prediction of putative reaction net—
works among compounds (Kotera et (11., 2013, 2014a; Yamanishi
et (11., 2015). In this work, we develop a novel algorithm to predict
enzyme orthologs catalyzing the putative reactions. This new algo—
rithm detects the chemical transformation patterns of substrate—
product pairs using chemical graph alignments, and constructs a set
of joint learning (JL)—based classifiers to simultaneously predict the
enzyme orthologs that could catalyze the putative reactions of these
substrate—product pairs. In the results section, we demonstrate the
usefulness of the proposed method by applying it to some tens of
thousands of metabolic compounds, and analyzing the extracted
chemical transformation patterns that provide insight into the char—
acteristics and specificities of enzymes. The proposed method will
open the door to both primary (central) and secondary metabolism
in genomics research, increasing research productivity to tackle a
wide variety of environmental and public health matters.

2 Materials

2.1 Enzyme orthologs

Enzymatic reactions and their associated enzyme orthologs were ob—
tained from the KEGG database (Kanehisa et (11., 2014). An ortho—
log is a group of homologous protein—encoding genes that are
thought to have the same biological function in different organisms.
To retrieve enzyme orthologs, we used KEGG Orthology (KO) data—
base. Each KO entry has an identifier (K number) consisting of the
letter ‘K’ and a following five—digit numeral (e.g. K00001 for alcohol
dehydrogenase [EC:1.1.1.1]). Starting from 17 553 KO entries, we
collected only the orthologs that included complete EC numbers in
their definitions (incomplete EC numbers such as EC 1.1.1.—were

not considered); 3584 orthologs were obtained. In this study, we
refer to such orthologs as ‘an enzyme ortholog’, or just ‘an enzyme’
for short. We use the word ‘an enzyme protein’ when we mean one
of the proteins belonging to the enzyme ortholog.

A sequence similarity matrix of all enzyme orthologs was con—
structed as follows. First, we regarded at most three enzyme proteins
present in eukaryotes and also in prokaryotes as the representative
proteins for each enzyme ortholog. Subsequently, we evaluated the
similarity among the enzyme orthologs using the maximum value of
Smith—Waterman scores (Smith and Waterman, 1981), from the all—
to—all comparison of enzyme proteins between enzyme orthologs.

2.2 Chemical structures of metabolic compounds

The chemical structures of metabolites (compounds) were retrieved
from the KEGG LIGAND database (Kanehisa et al., 2014), and are
converted to the KEGG Chemical Function (KCF) format (Hattori
et al., 2003). In the KCF format, atoms and bonds in a chemical
structure were represented as vertices and edges, respectively (with
the exception of hydrogen atoms). Each vertex is given a label repre—
senting different physicochemical properties [e.g. ‘C1a’ for a methyl
carbon (CH3—)]. Hydrogen atoms were implicitly represented in the
attached atoms (see http://www.genome.jp/kegg/reaction/KCF.
html). Chemically identical compounds with the same structures
(duplicates) were removed, so the chemical structures of all com—
pounds were unique. A total of 15 714 metabolic compounds were
used in this study. The number of all possible compound—compound
pairs (involving 15 714 compounds) is 246 914 082.

2.3 Substrate—product pairs in enzymatic reactions
Substrate—product pairs in enzymatic reactions (also referred to as
reactant pairs) were obtained from the KEGG RPAIR database
(Kanehisa et al., 2014). A substrate—product pair is defined as the
pair of a substrate and a product with a conserved chemical moiety
in an enzymatic reaction. For example, an enzymatic reaction
‘et/oanol + NADT : > acetalde/oyde + NADH+ HT’ is decomposed
into two substrate—product pairs ‘et/oanol - acetaldehyde’ and
‘NADJr - NADH’ based on the ﬂow of atoms other than hydrogen
atoms. Of these, frequently used pairs such as the oxidoreduction
cofactors ‘NADT - NADH’ are given the label ‘cofac’, whereas the
remaining pairs such as ‘ethanol - acetalde/oyde’ are given the label
‘main’. In this study, the substrate—product pairs that have only the
‘main’ label were retrieved, and different reaction directions were
dealt with as different pairs (e.g. ‘et/oanol—acetalde/oyde’ and ‘acetal—
dehyde—et/oanol’) in order to avoid missing the similarity between
the forward direction of a reaction and the reverse of another
reaction.

In order to explain the value of substrate—product pairs, we clari—
fied the difference between the two vocabularies ‘reaction’ and ‘trans-
formation’. The use of the word ‘reaction’ concerns all molecules in
the equation, such as ‘ethanol +NAD+ : > acetalde/oyde +
NADH +HT’, whereas the use of ‘transformation’ only concerns a
change in the substrate, such as ‘ethanol : > acetalde/oyde’ (Jones and
Bunnett, 1989). In other words, a substrate—product pair describes a
transformation. In analyzing putative novel reactions that are not yet
well characterized, it is more useful to deal with transformations, be—
cause transformations are available in many cases even when the reac-
tions are not apparent (Kotera et al., 2014b). We therefore use
substrate—product pairs for the de novo reconstruction of metabolic
pathways. For the sake of simplicity, we use the word reaction in this
paper, considering that a substrate—product pair partially describes
the characteristics of a reaction.

We used 7022 substrate—product pairs whose enzymes are
known as gold standard data, in which 2514 out of 3584 enzyme
orthologs were assigned to at least one substrate—product pair.
Known substrate—product pairs were regarded as positive examples
for one of the 2514 enzyme orthologs, whereas the remaining sub—
strate—product pairs were regarded as negative examples for the en—
zyme ortholog. Note that the numbers of positive examples and
negative examples differ from enzyme to enzyme.

2.4 Chemical transformation pattern descriptors

The design of chemical transformation patterns of substrate—prod—
uct pairs is crucial for the task of enzyme prediction. We represented
each substrate—product pair by a high—dimensional descriptor based
on chemical substructure changes between a substrate and a product
using Pairwise Chemical Aligner (PACHA), because it worked the
best among existing chemical descriptors for enzymatic reaction—
likeness prediction according to previous work (Yamanishi et al.,
2015 ). We applied PACHA to perform a chemical graph alignment
in order to detect chemical changes between two chemical com—
pounds, and represented each substrate—product pair as an integer—
valued vector (the PACHA feature vector) that describes conserved
atoms, as well as generated and eliminated bonds. As the result of
this effort, 7022 substrate—product pairs were represented by 3569—
dimensional PACHA feature vectors.

We also applied this operation to all possible pairs of compounds
in addition to known substrate—product pairs. Note that, in this art—
icle, we use the words ‘componnd—componnd pairs’ when we con—
sider all possible pairs, and the words ‘snbstrate—prodnct pairs’
when we specifically mention the pairs that occur in known reac—
tions. As the result of this effort, 246 914 082 compound—com—
pound pairs involving 15 714 compounds were represented by
35 69—dimensional PACHA feature vectors.

3 Methods

The de novo reconstruction of metabolic pathways consists of (i)
prediction of putative reaction networks and (ii) prediction of the
associated enzymes catalyzing the putative reactions. Here we pre—
sent a novel algorithm for the second task.

3.1 Predictive models for enzyme ortholog prediction
We address the problem of enzyme ortholog prediction by focusing
on the chemical transformation patterns of compound—compound
pairs (e.g. substrate—product pairs). Note that there are thousands of
candidates for enzyme orthologs, and different enzyme orthologs
may have common characteristics in terms of reaction mechanisms
and amino acid sequences. The same reactions are sometimes cata—
lyzed by multiple enzymes. Thus, we propose to formulate the prob—
lem in the framework of supervised multiple label prediction.

Suppose that there are M enzyme orthologs, and we are given N
compounds as C1, C2, . . . , CN and all possible compound—com—
pound pairs as (C1, C2), (C1, C3), . . . , (CN_1, CN). We consider pre—
dicting which enzyme orthologs would catalyze the putative
reaction; i.e. the (i, /)—th compound—compound pair (C,-, C,)
i,/' : 1,2, . . . ,N. Each compound—compound pair (C,, C,) is repre—
sented by a D—dimensional feature vector as ¢>(C,-, Ci). For example,
a compound—compound pair is represented by the PACHA feature
vector based on the chemical graph alignment between the two com—
pound structures in this study.

We construct a learning set of compound—compound pairs that
are substrate—product pairs for which the associated enzyme

Simultaneous prediction of enzyme orthologs from chemical transformation patterns i281

 

orthologs are known. There are M candidates for enzyme orthologs,
and each compound—compound pair in the learning set is assigned a
binary class label representing the m—th enzyme ortholog
(m : 1,2,...,M). Let ymﬁiﬁi E {+1,—1} be the class label for the
m—th enzyme ortholog assigned to (C,, C,-), where me-J- : +1
means that (C,, C,) is catalyzed by the m—th enzyme ortholog, and
ymﬁiﬁi : —1 means that (C,, C,) is not catalyzed by the m—th enzyme
ortholog.

We construct a predictive model to predict whether or not a
given compound—compound pair (C,, C,) would be catalyzed by the
m—th enzyme ortholog (m : 1, 2, . . . ,M). Linear models are a useful
tool to analyze extremely high—dimensional data for both prediction
and feature extraction tasks. Thus, we adopt a linear function
defined as fm(C,-, Ci) : me¢>(C,-, Ci), where Wm is a D—dimensional
weight vector for the m—th enzyme ortholog. We represent a set
of M model weights by a D X M matrix defined as
W :: [w1,wz, . . . ,WM], and estimate the weight matrix W by mini—
mizing an objective function based on the learning set.

3.2 Joint learning of multiple models
In order to overcome the scarcity of pre—knowledge concerning rela—
tionships between substrate—product pairs and enzyme orthologs,
we propose to jointly learn individual predictive models f1, f2,. . .,fM,
sharing information across M enzyme orthologs.

We attempt to jointly estimate all the weight vectors
W1, wz,...,wM in the models by minimizing the logistic loss as
follows:

M N '—1 N
MW) : Zm:1 21:1 {23:1 Pm“ + Emu PMNI’

where
Pmt')‘ : 10%(1 + eXp(_ymtit/WMT¢(C1‘7Ci)))‘

We introduce a regularization term Q(W) to the loss function in
order to enhance the generalization properties. Thus, the optimiza—
tion problem is written as follows:

tt‘tyilan) +o(W). (1)

Here we introduce two kinds of regularization terms. First, we
use a standard ridge regularization term to avoid the over—fitting
problem, which is defined as

1
o, :: ZTrait/WT).

Second, we design another regularization term reﬂecting the
amino acid sequence similarities among enzyme orthologs. In this
study we evaluated the similarity among enzyme orthologs using the
Smith—Waterman score, and construct an M X M similarity matrix S
for enzyme orthologs in which each element 5,3,- is a similarity score
between the i—th and j—th enzyme orthologs (see the Materials section
for more details). Then, we introduce the following regularization

 

 

 

 

term:
1 M M w, Wm
o W 2: — S ———
S( ) 4 21:1 Zm:1 ’«m  
1
: ETawny/T),
where  -  is the Euclidean norm, K is a diagonal matrix defined as

K” 2:211:15)”, and L5 is a symmetric normalized Laplacian
defined as KT1/2(K — S)K_1/2. The regularization term (25(W) has

the effect of making the weight vectors w,- and w,- close to each other
if Slim is high.

Finally, we introduce the following regularization term in the op—
timization problem (1):

Q(W) ;: Ago, (W) + 1,9,(W),

where is Z 0 and A, Z 0 are hyper—parameters to control the
strength of the regularization terms (25 and (2,, respectively.

Because Laplacian matrices are positive—semidefinite, the loss func—
tion and the regularization terms are convex. Thus, the optimization
problem (1) can be solved by using standard gradient—based methods.
We apply the Limited memory Broyden—Fletcher—Goldfarb—Shanno
(L—BFGS) algorithm (Liu and Nocedal, 1989) with the following
derivatives:

6R(W) N i—16Pmﬁiﬁ' N 6PM,-
[ 3W Lﬁm : Zi:1 {27:1 awml ‘I' Z/:i+1 awml}

where  denotes the m—th column vector of a matrix, and the de—

 

 

 

rivatives are calculated as follows:

6 HI: ¢(Ciﬁci)y H/eXP( 3’ ,,/W (“C CI»

 

3W”, _ 1 + exp(—ym,,-,,-me¢>(C,-, Ci)) '
The derivatives of the regularization terms can be calculated as
follows:
69, (W) i 39r(W) 7
BW _ WLS’ 6W _ W.

3.3 New enzyme ortholog prediction for any
compound—compound pairs

Once we have learned the predictive models, which is estimating W,
we can apply the predictive model to newly given compound—
compound pairs for which the associated enzyme orthologs are un—
known. Given a new compound—compound pair (Cinew), GEM”)
(k,l : 1,2, . . . .,N,,ew), where NM“, is the number of new unique
compounds, the enzyme ortholog prediction is performed with the
learned model fm(m : 1, 2, . . . ,M). If the output of fm(c§:ew), Gym”)
is a high score, the new compound—compound pair is predicted to be
catalyzed by the m—th enzyme ortholog.

3.4 Feature extraction of enzyme—specific chemical
transformation patterns

Linear models also have an interpretability of features. Since each
element of a feature vector ¢>(C,-, Ci) corresponds to an element of
the weight vector Wm, we can extract effective features contributing
to the prediction by sorting the feature elements of ¢>(C,-, Ci) accord—
ing to the corresponding values of the weight vector Wm in the model
fm(m : 1,2, . . . ,M). In this study, we extract highly weighted fea—
tures as the enzyme—specific chemical transformation patterns of the
m—th enzyme ortholog.

4 Results

4.1 Performance evaluation of the enzyme ortholog
prediction

We tested the ability of the proposed JL method to predict enzyme
orthologs from compound—compound pairs (i.e. substrate—product
pairs) based on their chemical structure data. We used the PACHA
feature vectors to represent the chemical substructure transform—
ation patterns of compound—compound pairs. As a baseline method,

we tested the nearest neighbor (NN) method, because the similarity
search is the most popular reaction classification approach (Kotera
et al., 2004; Rahman et al., 2014; Yamanishi et al., 2009), assuming
that the substrate—product pairs associated with the same enzyme
are likely to share conserved chemical substructures and their trans—
formation patterns.

As gold standard data, we used 7070 substrate—product pairs
associated with at least one of the 2514 enzyme orthologs, where
compound—compound pairs associated with an enzyme ortholog
were regarded as positive examples and the other compound—com—
pound pairs were regarded as negative examples for the enzyme
ortholog. We performed the 5 —fold cross—validation as follows. First,
we randomly split compound—compound pairs in the gold standard
data into five subsets of roughly equal size. Second, we took each
subset as a test set and the remaining four subsets as a training set.
Note that we used the same training set and the same test set across
all enzyme orthologs. Third, we constructed predictive models based
on only the training set. Finally, we evaluated the prediction accur—
acy using the prediction scores of compound—compound pairs in the
test set over the five folds. We evaluated the prediction performance
using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and sum—
marized the performance by the area under the ROC curve (AUC)
score.

Figure 2 shows the AUC scores for the 2514 enzyme orthologs
resulting from the five—fold cross—validation experiments with the
baseline NN method and the proposed JL method. The upper three
panels show index—plots of the AUC scores (upper left and middle)
and a scatter—plot of the AUC scores (upper right) for the NN and JL
methods. In most cases, the JL method outperformed the NN
method in terms of higher AUC scores, suggesting that JL is mean—
ingful for the prediction of enzyme orthologs. These results suggest
that the proposed JL method can capture the important features of

AUC score: Nearest Neighbor (NN)

AUC score: Joint Learning (JL)

enzyme—specific changes in chemical structure that occur during re—
actions more effectively than NN method.

The bottom left and bottom middle panels in Figure 2 show the
AUC scores based on the degrees (the number of positive examples
for each enzyme ortholog) for the NN method and the JL method,
respectively. It can be seen that the AUC scores generally increase
with the degrees of enzyme orthologs. This implies that it is difficult
to predict enzyme orthologs from compound—compound pairs when
the number of known substrate—product pairs in the learning set is
small because of the narrow substrate specificity of enzymes. The
bottom right panel in Figure 2 shows a comparison of the average
AUC scores calculated on the same degrees, obtained using the NN
method and the JL method. The JL method worked better than the
NN method for any degree, which suggests that the JL method can
effectively predict the responsible enzyme orthologs of given com—
pound—compound pairs in practice.

Figure 3 shows several examples of enzyme orthologs and
known reactions with various AUC scores obtained while perform—
ing the 5—fold cross—validation experiments. In general, the enzyme
orthologs with high AUC scores tend to act on a relatively large
number of substrates, mediating common types of chemical changes
to the characteristic common substructures. A typical example is
K05278 (ﬂavonol synthase), which is known to act on four sub—
strates, all mediating the hydroxylation of ﬂavonoid structures.
K08710 (N—isopropylammelide isopropylaminohydrolases) are
known to catalyze two reactions (RP09384 and RP05147). These re—
actions are not exactly the same type. RP09384 is the hydrolysis of a
primary amine (R—NH2), while RP05147 is the hydrolysis of a sec—
ondary amine (R—NH—R’). Nevertheless, they share common charac—
teristics in terms of reactions (hydrolysis of an amine) and a
conserved substructure (an ammelide residue), resulting in a rela—
tively high AUC score. If an ortholog is associated with just one

4.2 Extraction of enzyme—specific chemical transforma—
tion patterns

The proposed predictive models can extract enzyme ortholog—
specific chemical transformation patterns based on highly weighted
features in the models. The extracted features correspond to the
elements of the PACHA feature vectors, which represent the con—
served atoms, the atoms in which the physicochemical properties (or
the functional groups) changed, and the chemical bonds generated/
eliminated during the reaction.

Figure 4 shows several examples of the extracted chemical trans—
formation patterns. The first example is K01592, tyrosine decarb—
oxylase [EC:4.1.1.25]. This enzyme is known to catalyze two
reactions, RP01073 and RP0195 8, which are the same type of reac—
tion, but with different substrates (Fig. 4a, left). The chemical align—
ment highlighted atoms and chemical bonds that were conserved
and changed (Fig. 4a, middle), and they were represented as the
PACHA feature vectors (Fig. 4a, right). The two reactions catalyzed
by the enzyme ortholog K01592 share many features in common,
including ‘e:C1c-C6a’, which represents decarboxylation from a
branched $173 carbon, ‘a:C1c:C1b’, which represents the transform—
ation of a branched $173 carbon into a methylene carbon, and
‘a:N1a:N1a’, which represents the conserved amino group. These
three characteristics can be considered collectively and referred to as
‘decarboxylation from alpha-amino acids’. These common charac—
teristics were represented as the non—zero elements in the PACHA
feature vectors, and the corresponding non—zero elements were
highly weighted in the models.

The second example is K00052, 3—isopropylmalate dehydrogen—
ase [EC:1.1.1.85], which is also known to act on two different
substrates (Fig. 4b, left). The reaction converting D—erythro—3—
methylmalate (C06032) into 2—oxobutanoate (C00109) involves
two chemical changes (RP01224): dehydrogenation of a secondary
hydroxy group ‘a:01a:O5a,” and decarboxylation from a
branched $173 carbon ‘e:C1c-C6a’. The second substrate is 3—isopro—
pylmalate (C04411). It is known in this case that the enzyme cataly—
sis consists of two steps (RP04067 and RP01667). The
dehydrogenation of hydroxy group ‘a:01a : O5a’ occurs in the first
step (RP04067), and the spontaneous decarboxylation from a

branched $173 carbon ‘e:C1c-C6a’ (and ‘a:C1c:C1b’) occurs in the
second step. Because of this property, these two characteristics are
separately represented by two PACHA feature vectors, and the cor—
responding non—zero elements were highly weighted in the models.
In summary, these two examples have common characteristics
(both mediate decarboxylation) and different characteristics (only
K00052 mediates dehydrogenation, and the conserved atoms are
also different). Our method successfully extracted both the common
and different characteristics coded in their PACHA feature vectors.

4.3 Large—scale new predictions for enzyme orthologs
Finally, we performed a large—scale reconstruction of the metabolic
pathways connecting 15 714 compounds by predicting the enzym—
atic reaction—likeness and the associated enzyme orthologs for all
possible compound—compound pairs (246 914 082 pairs). First, we
performed the enzymatic reaction—likeness prediction using a previ—
ously developed method (Yamanishi et al., 2015 ). This provided
54 919 compound—compound pairs as new substrate—product pairs
in reactions. Note that the corresponding enzyme orthologs are not
known. Second, we made a comprehensive prediction of the enzyme
orthologs for the 54 919 compound—compound pairs using the JL
method proposed in this paper. We trained predictive models for
2514 enzyme orthologs using all substrate—product pairs in the gold
standard data, and applied the predictive models to the 54 919 com—
pound—compound pairs (potential substrate—product pairs). As the
result of this effort, we assigned high scoring enzyme ortholog candi—
dates to each of the compound—compound pairs.

Figure 5 shows examples of newly predicted associations be—
tween reactions and enzyme orthologs. Figure 5a and b show the re—
sults for the enzyme orthologs K01592 and K00052, respectively.
Note that K01592 and K00052 were also analyzed in Figure 4 in the
previous subsection. For the enzyme ortholog K015 92, the reactions
RP01073 and RP01958 have many common PACHA features such
as ‘e:C1c-C6a’, ‘a:C1c:C1b.’ and ‘a:N1a:N1a.’, which represent
the characteristic ‘decarboxylation of alpha-amimo acids’ (Fig. 4a).
The newly predicted reactions for K01592 also have the same char—
acteristics (Fig. 5a), of which the first reaction was verified in the
previous study (Pessione et al., 2009).

In contrast, for the enzyme ortholog K00052, the reac—
tion RP01224 has PACHA features such as ‘a:C1c : C1 b’,
‘a:01a:O5a’, ‘a:C1c:C5a’ and ‘e:C1c-C6a’ (Fig. 4b). The two

reactions RP04067 and RP01667 occur consecutively, and the
reaction RP04067 has the former two PACHA features (i.e.
‘a:C1c : Clb’ and ‘a:01a:O5a’), representing the dehydrogenation
of a secondary hydroxyl group. The reaction RP01667 has the latter
two PACHA features (i.e. ‘a:C1c:C5a’ and ‘e:C1c-C6a’), repre—
senting decarboxylation from a branched $173 carbon. The extracted
two PACHA features distinguished these two characteristics. The
newly predicted reactions for K00052 have one of these characteris—
tics (Fig. 5b), of which the first reaction was verified in the previous
study (Suzuki et al., 1997).

As another example, the enzyme orthologs K01824 (cholesterol
delta—isomerase [EC:5.3.3.5]) and K00213 (7—dehydrocholesterol re—
ductase [EC:1.3.1.21]) mediate similar reactions involving similar
substrates. K01824 catalyzes the intramolecular translocation of
double bonds (Fig. 5c). K00213 catalyzes the dehydrogenation of a
carbon—carbon bond to yield a double bond (Fig. 5d). In other
words, one of the common characteristics between K01824 and
K00213 is the dehydrogenation (intra— or inter—molecular) of a
cholesterol—related substrate. Because of these common characteris—
tics, the newly predicted reactions for the two enzyme orthologs
were the same (Fig. 5e), and the second reaction was verified to be
catalyzed by 7—dehydrocholesterol reductase in the previous study
(Shefer et al., 1998). In summary, our proposed method allows us to
find possible reactions for certain enzyme orthologs and to find pos—
sible enzyme orthologs catalyzing similar reactions.

5 Discussion

In this study, we proposed a novel method for the de novo recon—
struction of metabolic pathways from metabolome—scale compound
sets. This was made possible by elucidating the putative reaction
networks among compounds and by predicting the associated en—
zyme orthologs catalyzing the putative reactions in a seamless man—
nar. Particularly, we developed a novel algorithm to predict enzyme
orthologs catalyzing the putative reactions in the JL framework. The
originality of the method lies in its ability to make predictions for
thousands of enzyme orthologs simultaneously, as well as its extrac—
tion of enzyme—specific chemical transformation patterns of sub—
strate—product pairs. We demonstrated the usefulness of the
proposed method in terms of prediction accuracy, large—scale applic—
ability and interpretability of the predictive models. The proposed
method will enable us to analyze both primary (central) and second—
ary metabolism as well as ‘underground metabolism’, the series of
alternative reactions by known enzymes (Notebaart et al., 2014;
Colin et al., 2015) which is expected to be useful for various
applications.

Here we elaborate on the importance of predicting enzyme
orthologs rather than predicting EC numbers. There have been sev—
eral previous studies to predict EC numbers from chemical struc—
tures (Egelhofer et al., 2010; Hu et al., 2010; Kotera et al., 2004;
Latino and Aires—de Sousa, 2009; Matsuta et al., 2013; Nath and
Mitchell, 2012; O’Boyle et al., 2007; Rahman et al., 2014;
Yamanishi et al., 2009). An EC number consists of four numerals
connected by dots. The first three numerals (EC sub—subclasses) rep—
resent an enzyme classification based on the reactions they catalyze,
whereas full EC numbers (including the fourth numeral) are enzyme
identifiers, rather than an enzyme classification. When an enzyme is
found to catalyze a previously unknown reaction, a new EC number
is assigned (McDonald and Tipton, 2014). This makes it reasonable
to find existing EC numbers for a known reaction, but it makes no
sense to predict existing EC numbers (including the fourth digit) for

a previously unknown reaction. In contrast, it still makes sense to
predict existing EC sub—subclasses for a previously unknown reac—
tion. However, the number of EC sub—subclasses is much smaller
than the number of enzyme orthologs, meaning that an EC sub—
subclass generally corresponds to many enzyme orthologs, which
makes it ineffective to use EC sub—subclasses for enzyme prediction.
For this reason, we attempted to directly link enzyme orthologs to
reactions.

An ortholog is a group of highly homologous genes or proteins
that are considered to have the same biological function across dif—
ferent organisms. Examples include Clusters of Orthologous Groups
(Natale et al., 2000) and KO (Kanehisa et al., 2014). Theoretically,
any set of ortholog groups can be used in the analysis, but in this
study we used the KO database because of its higher coverage. To
date, 17 228 orthologs have been defined in the KO database, of
which there are 3584 enzyme orthologs. The number of enzyme
orthologs is larger than the number of EC sub—subclasses (281 EC
sub—subclasses). More importantly, enzyme orthologs represent
groups of enzymes based on the sequence homology, not on the re—
actions they catalyze. Therefore the enzyme function may change
due to amino acid substitutions. A limited number of enzyme pro—
teins within an enzyme ortholog catalyze a verified reaction. Some
enzyme proteins may catalyze the same reaction or different reac—
tions, and others may catalyze no reaction at all. It is therefore rea—
sonable to assume that an enzyme ortholog may catalyze a novel
reaction that is yet to be identified.

In order to elaborate on our results, we examined the distribu—
tion of sequence similarity calculated using the Smith—Waterman
score (Smith and Waterman, 1981) within the same enzyme ortho—
logs and between different enzyme orthologs. If the hierarchical clas—
sification of enzymes by EC numbers reﬂected the similarity of
enzyme proteins, then enzymes in the same EC sub—subclass whould
be more similar than those in different EC sub—subclasses. However,
this is not always true. The first, second and third box—plots in
Figure 6 show the distributions of sequence similarity scores among
enzymes associated with EC 4.1.1.25 and EC 1.1.1.85 (see Figs. 4,

5a and b). The median scores between EC 4.1.1.25 and EC 1.1.1.85
were not significantly different from those within the same EC sub—
subclasses. In fact, these two enzymes had common characteristics
in their reactions, as shown in Figure 4a for EC 4.1.1.25 and Figure
4b for EC 1.1.1.85.

The fourth, fifth and sixth box—plots in Figure 6 show the distri—
butions of the sequence similarity scores among enzymes associated
with EC 5.3.3.5 and EC 1.3.1.21 (see Figures 5c and d). The median
scores between EC 5.3.3.5 and EC 1.3.1.21 were larger than those
within EC sub—subclass 5.3.3, and also within 1.3.1. This implies
that EC 5.3.3.5 and EC 1.3.1.21 are very similar in terms of both en—
zymatic reactions and enzyme proteins, making it reasonable to pre—
dict the same chemical transformations (Fig. 56). These results
demonstrate an advantage of the enzyme ortholog over the EC sub—
subclass for the de novo reconstruction of metabolic pathways. The
proposed method is expected to reconstruct metabolic pathways
consisting of a wide range of new reactions that are not defined
within the existing EC numbers.

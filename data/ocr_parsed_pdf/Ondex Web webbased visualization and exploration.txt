ABSTRACT

Summary: Ondex Web is a new web-based implementation of the
network visualization and exploration tools from the Ondex data inte-
gration platform. New features such as context-sensitive menus and
annotation tools provide users with intuitive ways to explore and ma-
nipulate the appearance of heterogeneous biological networks. Ondex
Web is open source, written in Java and can be easily embedded into
Web sites as an applet. Ondex Web supports loading data from a
variety of network formats, such as XGMML, NWB, Pajek and OXL.
Availability and implementation: http://ondex.rothamsted.ac.uk/

1 INTRODUCTION

The integrative approach to systems biology studies the inter-
actions between molecular or cellular components to understand
how a behavior or phenotype might emerge from the properties
or structure of the interactions. This approach generally requires
data from diverse sources to be integrated and analyzed together.

It is common in systems biology to adopt network formalisms
to represent, visualize and explore interaction information, and a
number of web-based applications are available for the visual-
ization of biological networks (Gehlenborg et al., 2010). A well-
known example is Cytoscape Web (Lopes et al., 2010); version 1
of which is implemented using Flex/ActionScript and a
JavaScript API. Cytoscape Web can visualize small- to
medium-sized networks, (i.e. a few hundred nodes and edges).
The visual styles (e. g. color, size and opacity) of nodes and edges
can be dynamically changed by the client. However, loading of
data and customization of its appearance in Cytoscape Web re-
quire extensive JavaScript programming skills.

We have previously developed the Ondex software suite
(Kohler et al., 2006) (www.0ndex.org) to provide a general
framework for the integration of heterogeneous biological
data. We describe here a new implementation of the visualization
software from the Ondex suite that enables integrated networks
and associated quantitative data to be presented in a web brow-
ser. This enables delivery of results from pre—integrated datasets
to end-users, as featured in the QTLNetMiner system (http://
ondex.rothamstedac.uk/QTLNetMiner/), and overcomes the
signiﬁcant obstacle encountered by many biologists of installing

and learning complex data integration software system. Ondex
Web has been built as a Java applet, reusing proven functions
and plugins from the Ondex desktop application. This results in
a richer repertoire of functions for exploring and manipulating
heterogeneous information networks (Sun and Han, 2012) than
currently available in Cytoscape Web. Ondex Web provides new
features not described before, including easy-to-use search func-
tions for loaded data and across web services (e.g. ChEMBL,
UniProtKB). The network appearance can be changed using
dedicated plugins, and another new feature is the extensive con-
text-sensitive menus on nodes and edges (Fig. 1).

Ondex Web has direct support for loading data in common
network formats such as Cytoscape’s XGMML (Punin and
Krishnamoorthy, 2001), NWB (NWB, 2006), Pajek (Batagelj
and Mrvar, 2002). The Ondex desktop application can be used
to prepare datasets integrated from a large range of input for-
mats (see http://ondex.org/formats.html) and exported in OXL
format (Taubert et al., 2007) for use in Ondex Web. Example
data sets are available for download (http://ondex.org/doc.html).

2 FEATURES

Ondex Web supports two complementary strategies for the ex-
ploration and analysis of biological networks. The bottom-up
strategy, which is recommended for very large integrated datasets,
starts with a few nodes (e. g. from a search query). The new con-
text-sensitive right-click menus on nodes and edges can be used to
iteratively build a larger network by exploration. The top-down
strategy, used for small- or medium-sized networks, displays the
entire network, and parts of the network can be hidden using
right-click context menus or highlighted using annotation tools.

2.1 Exploring heterogeneous biological networks

A heterogeneous information network consists of multi-typed
objects (e.g. gene, pathway, ontology, literature) and semantic
links (e.g. encodes, interacts, expressed, published). This seman-
tic information is used to automatically map visual attributes like
node shape, node color or edge color.

Starting with a small part of the loaded network displayed, a
user can, for example, follow a bottom-up strategy by right-
clicking on a particular node or selection of nodes and then
using the context-sensitive menu to change the visibility property
of neighboring nodes. The context-sensitive menus ensure that
only valid operations are presented to the user. For example, if a
gene does not have any known proteins, then the menu item for
showing encoded proteins would not appear.

Fig. 1. A heterogeneous biological network is displayed in Ondex Web.
Right-click on nodes and edges to bring up a context-sensitive menu.
Annotators change the appearance of the network based on node/edge
properties. The search menu allows searching loaded data and across web
services

If additional information about the originating data source of
nodes and edges has been recorded as a URL, then a hyperlink
to the corresponding web page is presented at the top of the
context menu, enabling the user to easily obtain more informa-
tion from the web. The complete list of information on a node or
edge in the network is accessible using the “Item Info” (“View”
menu) function of Ondex Web.

2.2 Advanced search

Ondex Web offers a new advanced search function, which can be
shown via the “View” menu. The user can enter any keyword or
regular expression to search all the information held in the
loaded network. The search can be restricted to nodes of a
given concept class or data source. It is also possible to search
external web services like ChEMBL and UniProtKB using cor-
responding IDs, which will add search results as new nodes to the
network. The web-service interface can also be used to run
server-side data analysis tasks, as also exploited in the
QTLNetMiner application.

The search results are displayed in a separate frame in a tabu-
lar format. The matching text is highlighted. Selecting one or
more rows in the table propagates to the selection of the relevant
nodes in the network, immediately highlighting the search results
in the visualization. Furthermore, the network can be ﬁltered
down to a speciﬁed neighborhood surrounding the search results.

Once the user has obtained the most informative network for
their problem using the methods outlined above, it is possible to
either save the network in OXL format, or the current view can
be exported as an image (JPG, BMP, PNG) or vector graphics
(EPS).

3 IMPLEMENTATION

Ondex Web was refactored from the Java libraries used in the
Ondex desktop application. This ensures consistent behavior for

users of both tools. Ondex Web requires Oracle Java version 6 or
higher on the client side. Once loaded, the applet is cached by
Java, which makes subsequent calls much faster. The user can set
the size of the client-side applet memory. The applet HTML tag
of Ondex Web provides some parameters for customizing the
initial look and interaction with the displayed network.

3.1 Performance and availability

Ondex Web runs as a Java client applet in a web page, and is
therefore only limited by available client resources and the Java
runtime environment. In particular the more memory available
to the Java virtual machine on the client, the larger networks can
be loaded. The pragmatic limitations of visualizing and interact-
ing with large networks led us to provide a warning to the user if
a larger than usual network is to be displayed. The user can then
choose to adapt their strategy to a bottom-up style or change
from default initial force-directed layout to a faster, but simpler,
initial one.

The Ondex Web application and source code is available from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/ondex/files/OndexWeb/.

4 CONCLUSION

Heterogeneous biological networks require good exploration and
visualization tools. Ondex Web is free, open-source and can
easily be embedded on Web sites to visualize networks. It
comes with a rich and intuitive set of functions to explore and
manipulate biological networks. For an example application of
Ondex Web, visit QTLNetMiner (http://ondex.rothamsted.ac.
uk/QTLNetMiner/), where it is used to visualize evidence net-
works supporting candidate gene selections.

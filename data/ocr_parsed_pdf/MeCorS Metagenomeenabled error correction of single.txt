Abstract

Summary: We present a new tool, MeCorS, to correct chimeric reads and sequencing errors in lllumina
data generated from single amplified genomes (SAGs). It uses sequence information derived from
accompanying metagenome sequencing to accurately correct errors in SAG reads, even from ultra—low
coverage regions. In evaluations on real data, we show that MeCorS outperforms BayesHammer, the
most widely used state—of—the—art approach. MeCorS performs particularly well in correcting chimeric
reads, which greatly improves both accuracy and contiguity of de novo SAG assemblies.

1 Introduction

The vast majority of microbial species found in nature has yet to be
grown in pure culture, turning metagenomics and—more recently—
single cell genomics into indispensable methods to access the genetic
makeup of microbial dark matter (Brown et (11., 2015; Rinke et (11.,
2013). Frequently, single amplified genomes (SAGs) and shotgun
metagenomes are generated from the same environmental sample,
and are methodologically comhined e.g. to validate metagenome
hins with single cells or to improve the SAG’s assemhly contiguity
(Campbell et (11., 2013; Hess et (11., 2011). However, a single cell’s
DNA needs to be amplified prior to sequencing, as usually accom-
plished by multiple displacement amplification (MDA; Lasken,
2007). This amplification is heavily hiased, leading to uneven
sequencing depth including ultra-low coverage regions with basic-
ally no informed error correction possihle (Chitsaz et (11., 2011;
Supplementary Fig. S1). Moreover, chimera formation occurs
roughly once per 10 khp during MDA, further complicating SAG as-
sembly (Nurk et (11., 2013; Rodrigue et (11., 2009).

While an array of error correction tools exist for a variety of use
cases (Laehnemann et (11., 2016), only one tool was specifically

designed to correct SAG data: hammer (Medvedev et (11., 2011), re-
cently refined to BayesHammer (Nikolenko et (11., 2013). We pro-
pose a metagenome-enabled error correction strategy for single cell
sequencing reads. Our method takes advantage of largely unhiased
metagenomic coverage, enabling it to correct positions with too low
a coverage for SAG-only error correction, and to correct chimeric
SAG reads through non-chimeric metagenome reads.

2 Methods

We correct potential errors using an algorithm similar to solving the
spectral alignment problem (Pevzner et (11., 2001). Given a set of
trusted k-mers, we use a heuristic method to find a sequence with
minimal corrections such that each k-mer on the corrected sequence
is trusted. Using a k-mer size of 31, we consider a k-mer trusted if it
occurs at least twice in the accompanying metagenome. This cover-
age threshold was determined empirically to work with most data-
sets (Supplementary Fig. S2).

Our correction algorithm was inspired by fermi (Li, 2012) and
BFC (Li, 2015), but we do not act on the assumption of uniform

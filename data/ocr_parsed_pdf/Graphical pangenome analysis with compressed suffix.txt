Abstract

Motivation: Low—cost genome sequencing gives unprecedented complete information about the
genetic structure of populations, and a population graph captures the variations between many in—
dividuals of a population. Recently, Marcus et al. proposed to use a compressed de Bruijn graph
for representing an entire population of genomes. They devised an O(n log 9) time algorithm
called splitMEM that constructs this graph directly (i.e. without using the uncompressed de Bruijn
graph) based on a suffix tree, where n is the total length of the genomes and g is the length of the
longest genome. Since the applicability of their algorithm is limited to rather small datasets, there
is a strong need for space—efficient construction algorithms.

Results: We present two algorithms that outperform splitMEM in theory and in practice. The first
implements a novel linear—time suffix tree algorithm by means of a compressed suffix tree. The
second algorithm uses the Burrows—Wheelertransform to build the compressed de Bruijn graph in
O(n log a) time, where a is the size of the alphabet. To demonstrate the scalability of the algo—

 

rithms, we applied it to seven human genomes.

1 Introduction

1.1 Background

Second- and third-generation sequencers produce vast amounts of
DNA sequence information, and it is often the case that multiple
genomes of the same or closely related species are available. An ex-
ample is the I000 Genomes Project, which started in 2008. Its goal
was to sequence the genomes of at least I000 humans from all over
the world and to produce a catalog of all variations (SNPs, indels,
etc.) in the human population. In this article, the term ‘pan-genome’
of the population refers to the genomic sequences together with this
catalog. Tettelin et al. (2005) coined the term pan-genome a decade
ago; they evaluated the composition of six strains of Streptococcus
agalactiae. The pan-genome analysis of other bacteria followed: e.g.
the pan-genome structure of Escherichia coli was studied by Rasko

et a1. (2008). In a broader sense, the pan-genome defines the entire
genomic repertoire of a given phylogenetic clade (which may range
from species to phylum and beyond). One distinguishes between the
core genome that contains genes shared by all strains within the
clade (housekeeping genes, etc.), the dispensable genome (made of
genes shared by only a subset of the strains) and strain-specific
genes.

Since the (16 1101/0 assembly of, e.g. mammalian genomes, is still
a serious problem (both from a technological and a budgetary point
of view), the reference-based approach dominates in genomics.
Small wonder that most methods to represent a pan-genome by a
graph are reference based. Here, we briefly discuss a few of them:
Schneeberger et al. (2009) were the first to explicitly model vari-
ation in a population DAG of a few Ambidopsis tlaalimztz genomes.

Rahn et al. (2014) used a data structure called ‘Journaled String
Tree’ to consistently represent both SNPs and indels as edits to a ref—
erence genome, and Dilthey et al. (2015) use a population reference
graph for genome inference. In contrast to these works, which are
all alignment—based, Paten et al. (2014) came up with a different so—
lution: they proposed context mapping to relate genomes.

Marcus et al. (2014) proposed a reference— and alignment—free
approach for pan—genome analyses. Ideally, it takes multiple
assembled genomes as input, but it can also work with contigs. For
some species, especially medically important bacteria, multiple com—
plete genomes are available. For example, in 2015, NCBI GenBank
contained 72 strains of Chlamydia trachomatis (a sexually transmit—
ted human pathogen) and 62 strains of the prokaryotic model organ—
ism E.coli. Marcus et al. (2014) proposed a compressed de Bruijn
graph as a graphical representation of the relationship between gen—
omes. Basically, it is a compressed version of the colored de Bruijn
graph introduced by Iqbal et al. (2012). Marcus et al. (2014) de—
scribe an O(n log g) time algorithm that directly computes the com—
pressed de Bruijn graph based on a suffix tree (ST), where n is the
total length of the genomes and g is the length of the longest
genome. They write about their software splitMEM: ‘Future work
remains to improve splitMEM and further unify the family of se—
quence indices. Although . . . , most desired are techniques to reduce
the space consumption. . . ’ In this article, we present two different
techniques that achieve this goal. The first implements a novel lin—
ear—time suffix tree algorithm by means of a compressed ST (CST).
The second algorithm uses the Burrows—Wheeler transform to build
the compressed de Bruijn graph in O(n log a) time, where a is the
size of the alphabet 2. Preliminary ideas for the second algorithm
were presented by Beller and Ohlebusch (2015). In contrast to
splitMEM, both of our algorithms use only O(n) space.

The contracted de Bruijn graph introduced by CazauX et al.
(2014) is not identical with the compressed de Bruijn graph. A node
in the contracted de Bruijn graph is not necessarily a substring of
one of the genomic sequences [see the remark following Definition 3
in the article by Cazaux et al. (2014)]. Thus the contracted de Bruijn
graph, which can be constructed in linear time from the ST, is not
useful for our purposes.

Very recently, other alignment—free and reference—free
approaches were described by Solomon and Kingsford (2015) and
Holley et al. (2015 ). Both are k—mer approaches that use Bloom fil—
ters. We will discuss their relationship to the splitMEM approach in
Section 4.

1.2 Problem definition

Given a string S of length n and a natural number k, the de Bruijn
graph representation of S contains a node for each distinct length k
substring of S, called a k—mer. Two nodes 14 and U are connected by
a directed edge u —> v if u and U occur consecutively in S, i.e.
u : S[i..i + k — 1] and U : S[i + 1..i+ k], where S[i../[ denotes the
substring of S starting with the character at position i and ending
with the character at position /. Figure 1 shows an example. Clearly,

 

Fig. 1. The de Bruijn graph for k:3 and the string ACTACGTACGTACG$ is
shown on the left, while its compressed counterpart is shown on the right

the graph contains at most 11 nodes and n edges. By construction, ad—
jacent nodes will overlap by k — 1 characters, and the graph can in—
clude multiple edges connecting the same pair of nodes or self—loops
representing overlapping repeats. For every node, except for the
start node (containing the first k characters of S) and the stop node
(containing the last k characters of S), the in—degree coincides with
the out—degree. A de Bruijn graph can be ‘compressed’ by merging
non—branching chains of nodes into a single node with a longer
string. More precisely, if node 14 is the only predecessor of node U
and U is the only successor of u (but there may be multiple edges
14 —> U), then u and U can be merged into a single node that has the
predecessors of u and the successors of U. After maximally compress—
ing the graph, every node (apart from possibly the start node) has at
least two different predecessors or its single predecessor has at least
two different successors and every node (apart from the stop node)
has at least two different successors or its single successor has at
least two different predecessors; Figure 1. Of course, the compressed
de Bruijn graph can be built from its uncompressed counterpart (a
much larger graph), but this is disadvantageous because of the huge
space consumption. That is why we will build it directly.

Figure 2 shows how splitMEM represents the compressed de
Bruijn graph G for k : 3 and the string S :ACTACGTACGTACG$.
Each node corresponds to a substring w of S and consists of the four
components (id,len,posList,ad/List), where id is a natural number
that uniquely identifies the node, [en is the length (m) of w, posList is
the list of positions at which a) occurs in S (sorted in ascending
order) and ad/List is the list of the successors of the node (sorted in
such a way that the walk through G that gives S is induced by the
adjacency lists: if node G[id[ is visited for the 1th time, then its suc—
cessor is the node that can be found at position i in the adjacency list
of G [id] ).

In pan—genome analysis, S is the concatenation of multiple gen—
omic sequences, where the different sequences are separated by spe—
cial symbols (in practice, we use one separator symbol and treat the
different occurrences of it as if they were different characters). The
nodes in the compressed de Bruijn graph of a pan—genome can be
categorized as follows:

° A uniqueNode represents a unique substring in the pan—genome
and has a single start position (i.e. posList contains just one
element).

° A repeatNode represents a substring that occurs at least twice in
the pan—genome, either as a repeat in a single genome or as a seg—
ment shared by multiple genomes.

According to Marcus et al. (2014), the compressed de Bruijn
graph is most suitable for pan—genome analysis: ‘This way the com—
plete pan—genome will be represented in a compact graphical repre—
sentation such that the shared/strain—specific status of any substring
is immediately identifiable, along with the context of the flanking se—
quences. This strategy also enables powerful topological analysis of
the pan—genome not possible from a linear representation”. Figure 3
illustrates this point of view.

Analogously, the repeat a) is right-maximal if
[{S[SA[q] +Z][i§q§/}[ 22. A left— and right—maximal repeat is
called maximal repeat. [Note that Marcus et al. (2014) use the
term ‘maximal exact match” instead of the more common term
‘maximal repeat”. We will not use the term ‘maximal exact
match” here.] An internal node v in the ST is called left—maximal
if str(U) is a left—maximal repeat. Note that every internal node U
of the ST is right—maximal in the sense that str(U) is a right—max—
imal repeat.

2 Methods

Our algorithms are based on the following simple lemma:

Let 1} he a node in the compressed de Bruijn graph and let a) he
the string corresponding to v. If v is not the start node, then it
has at least two different predecessors if and only if the length k
prefix of a) is a left-maximal repeat. It has at least two different
successors if and only if the length k  of a) is a right-
maximal repeat.

The lemma provides a tool to decide at which positions a split
occurs. Both of our methods make extensive use of it.

2.1 Using a (compressed) Suffix tree

Marcus et al. (2014) describe an algorithm that computes the com—
pressed de Bruijn graph directly (i.e. without using the uncom—
pressed de Bruijn graph) based on an ST of the pan—genome. Their
algorithm consists of two phases:

1. Compute the set of repeatNodes of the compressed de Bruijn
graph.

2. Compute the uniqueNodes as well as edges between nodes in the
compressed de Bruijn graph.

They introduce so—called ‘suffix skips” to compute repeatNodes
in O(n log g) time. Our new linear—time Algorithm 1 computes
repeatNodes without them. The idea behind Algorithm 1 is as fol—
lows: Start the computation only with left—maximal internal nodes
that have no internal node as child and use suffix links to detect their
repeat—structure (i.e. where splits are necessary). Stop the computa—
tion if a left—maximal internal node x is encountered. This is because
either x has no internal node as child, so it will be considered later,
or x has an internal node y as child, so its repeat—structure will be
found when y is processed. In Algorithm 1, cur is a pointer to a re—
peat that must or must not be split later, and l is the number of char—
acters that must be skipped before the split occurs (note that if a
split occurs, then the left and right part overlap by k — 1 characters).
A split occurs if the k—length prefix of str(v) is left— or right—maximal,
where U is the current internal node. Let u : HAQ(U, k) and consider
the situation of Figure 5. In that situation, Algorithm 1 uses the fol—
lowing case analysis:

H

If str(u) is a left—maximal repeat, then the length k preﬁx of str(u)

is left—maximal. This implies that the length k preﬁx of str(U) is left—

maximal. If in this case 2 > 0, then a) must be split at the beginning

of str(u); so the length l + k — 1 preﬁx of w is a repeatNode.

1a If str(u) is a right—maximal k—mer (because sDepth(u) : k), then a)
must also be split at the end of str(u) because str(u) is also a
repeatNode. The algorithm continues with w[l + 2..  and l : 0.

1b If str(u) is not a right—maximal k—mer, then the algorithm con—
tinues with the string str(v) : w[l + 1..[w[[ and l : 1.

2a If str(u) is not a left—maximal repeat but a right—maximal k—mer,
then a) must be split at the end of str(u); so the length l + k pre—
ﬁx of w is a repeatNode. The algorithm continues with
w[l + 2..[w[] andl : 0.

2b If str(u) is neither a left—maximal repeat nor a right—maximal k—

mer, then the algorithm continues with the string a) and Z + 1.

The procedure CREATE—REP—NODE in Algorithm 1 creates a new
repeatNode if this node does not exist yet.

Fig. 6. The string a) is prefix of the suffix 5‘p of S and Cu) is prefix of Spc1. a)
must be split if (i) the length kprefix of Cu) is a right-maximal repeat or (ii) the
length kprefix of a) is a left-maximal repeat

We will next show that Algorithm 1 runs in O(n) time.
Since all operations in the algorithm take constant time, the
run—time is proportional to the overall number of suffix links
that are followed. The ST of a string S of length nhasn leaves.
Since every internal node is branching, ST has at most n — 1 in—
ternal nodes. It follows that there are at most n — 1 suffix links
because every internal node has exactly one suffix link. We
claim that every suffix link is used at most once in Algorithm
1. Suppose to the contrary that a suffix link from node v to
node to is used more than once. This is only possible if node U
has at least two incoming suffix links, say from nodes uand u’.
If str(U) : at, then we must have str(u) : aorandstr(u’) : a’oc for
two distinct characters aanda’. However, this implies that U is
left—maximal and Algorithm 1 stops whenever a left—maximal
node is reached. This contradiction proves our claim and shows
that Algorithm 1 runs in linear time.

Once Algorithm 1 has computed the repeatNodes, we pro—
ceed as in the second phase of splitMEM: the set of genomic
starting positions that occur in each repeatNode is sorted, so
that uniqueNodes that bridge any gaps between adjacent
repeatNodes as well as the edges in the compressed de Bruijn
graph can be computed in a single pass over the sorted list.
However, there is one difference to Marcus et al. (2014): to
achieve linear run—time, we use a non—comparison—based sorting
algorithm for this task; details can be found in the
Supplementary Material.

2.2 Using the BWT
Our second algorithm uses the BWT and the LF—mapping to
compute the complete compressed de Bruijn graph G
(uniqueNodes, repeatNodes and the edges between them) in a
single backward pass over the whole pan—genome S. To be
more precise, Algorithm 2 starts with the suffix Sn:$ at
index [:1 in the suffix array and successively computes the
indices of Sn_1,  ,S1 with the help of the LF mapping (i.e.
Sn_1 can be found at index i: LF[j], Sn_2 can be found at index
LF[i], etc.). In Algorithm 2, the current string a) is a prefix of
suffix Sp, which occurs at index i in the suffix array. The next
string that must be considered in the algorithm is ca), where
c:S[p— 1]. Note that cm is a prefix of suffix Sp_1, which
occurs at index i: LF(/) in the suffix array. The string a) must
be split if (i) the length k prefix of cm is a right—maximal re—
peat or (ii) the length k prefix of w is a left—maximal repeat;
see Figure 6 for an illustration.

Algorithm 2 uses three bit vectors B1, Bz and B3, which
are constructed in a preprocessing phase by the procedure

CREATE—BIT—VECTORS. Here, we only briefly explain this proced—
ure; it is described in detail in the Supplementary Material,
where it is also shown that its run—time is O(n log a). All three
bit vectors are initialized with zeros. The procedure obtains
the bit vector B1 by computing the suffix array interval [lb..rb]
of each right—maximal k—mer and setting B1[lb] :B1[rb] : 1;
see Figure 4 for an example. Moreover, B1 is preprocessed, so
that rank—queries can be answered in constant time. By means of B17
it is then possible to perform test (i) in constant time: if cm is prefix
of the suffix at index i in SA, then it has a right—maximal k—mer as
prefix if and only if Bl[i] : 1 or rank1(B1,i) is odd. If this is the
case, a split occurs and Algorithm 2 must continue with the k—mer
prefix of cm as next node. The number [(rank1(B1,i)+1)/2]
will serve as a unique identifier of this next node. In the fol—
lowing, rightMax : rank1(B 1,n) /2 is the number of right—maximal
k—mer intervals. Procedure CREATE—BIT—VECTORS also computes the bit
vectors 32 and B3 as follows: If the suffix array interval [lb..rb] of a
left—maximal repeat of length 2 k is detected (hence the correspond—
ing k—mer prefix is left—maximal), then Bz[q] is set to 1 for all q in
[lb..rb]. Moreover, for each c in BWT[lb..rb], the procedure sets Bg[
LF[q]] to 1, where q is the index of the last occurrence of c in
BWT[lb..rb]. Finally, the procedure resets each one bit in B3 that
marks a right—maximal k—mer to zero (the reason for this will be—
come clear in a moment); in the example of Figure 4, no bit of B3
had to be reset. By means of B; it is then possible to perform test (ii)
in constant time: if a) is prefix of the suffix at index i in SA, then it
has a left—maximal k—mer as prefix if and only if B;  : 1. If this is
the case, a split occurs and Algorithm 2 must continue with the
k—mer prefix x of cm, which is a prefix of the suffix at index
i: LF[j], as next node. If B1[i] : 1 or rank1(B1,i) is odd, then
[(rank1(B1,i) + 1) / 2] is the identifier of this next node. If not, then
we use the bit vector B3 to assign the unique identifier rightMax+
rank1(Bg,i— 1)+1 to the next node, which corresponds to (or
ends with) x. This is because rightMax is the number of all right—
maximal k—mers and rank1(Bg,i — 1): rank1(Bg,lb’ — 1), where
[lb’..rb’] is the x—interval. It can be shown that B 3 [lb’ ..rb’ — 1] solely
contains zeros and Bg[rb’] : 1; consequently rank1(Bg,i — 1) + 1 :
rank1(Bg,rb’).

To sum up, after the preprocessing phase it is known that
the compressed de Bruijn graph G has rightMax+leftMax+ 1
many nodes: there are rightMax : rank1(B1,n)/2 many nodes
that end with a right—maximal k—mer, leftMaxzrank1(Bg,n)
many nodes that end with a non—right—maximal k—mer and
the stop node that ends with the special symbol S.
Consequently, Algorithm 2 initializes an array G of that
size, in which a node is represented by the triple
(len,posList,ad/List), where posList is the sorted list of pos—
itions at which the corresponding string a) occurs in S, len
is the length of w and ad/List is the corresponding adja—
cency list. The for—loop of Algorithm 2 implements the sin—
gle backward pass over S as described above. A split occurs
whenever numberyé J_. In this case, the position p is added
to the front of the posList of the current node cur and cur
is added to the front of the ad/List of the next node
number. If number: I, then the length of the string corres—
ponding to node cur is incremented by one.

As explained in the Supplementary Material, the computation of
the bit vectors B1, 32 and B3 requires O(n log a) time. Apart from
the LF—mapping, all operations in Algorithm 2 take only constant time.
In our implementation, the LF—mapping is implemented by a wavelet
tree of the BWT, so it takes O(log a) time to compute a value LF(/).
Consequently, the overall run—time of Algorithm 2 is O(n log a).

2.3 The size of the compressed de Bruijn graph

It follows from the preceding section that the size of the compressed
de Bruijn graph can be characterized in terms of left— and right—
maximal k—mer repeats. The number of nodes equals
[V1] + [V2] + 1, where V1 : {w]w is a right—maximal k—mer repeat
inS}and V2 : {w]EliE {1,  ,n—k} 2w:S[i..i+k—1] a V1and
S[i + 1..i + k] is a left—maximal k—mer repeat in S}; the stop node is
taken into account by adding 1. The number of edges is
({i]1 Sign — kandS[i..i+k — 1] 6 Wu WM.

3 Results

We implemented our new algorithms in C++, using the library sdsl
of Gog et al. (2014). Software and test data are available at http://
www.uni—ulm.de/in/theo/research/seqana.html. Both algorithms use
a variant of the semi—external algorithm described in Beller et al.
(2013b) to construct the CST and the BWT, respectively. The experi—
ments were conducted on a 64 bit Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS (Kernel
3.13) system equipped with two ten—core Intel Xeon processors E5—
2680v2 with 2.8 GHz and 128 GB of RAM (but no parallelism was
used). All programs were compiled with g++ (version 4.8.2) using
the provided makefile.

With the CST—based and the BWT—based algorithm, respectively,
we built compressed de Bruijn graphs for the 62 E.coli genomes
(containing 310 million base pairs) listed in the Supplementary

Material of Marcus et al. (2014), using the k—mer lengths 50, 100
and 1000. Table 1 lists the results of our experiments. The run—times
include the construction of the index, but similar to splitMEM it is
unnecessary to rebuild the index for a fixed dataset and varying val—
ues of k. The peak memory usage reported in Table 1 includes the
size of the index and the size of the compressed de Bruijn graph.
Because of its large memory requirements, splitMEM was not able
to build a compressed de Bruijn graph for all 62 strains of E.coli on
our machine equipped with 128 GB of RAM. That is why we
included a comparison based on the first 40 E.coli genomes (con—
taining 199 million base pairs) of the dataset. The experimental re—
sults show that both of our algorithms use significantly less space
(two orders of magnitude) than splitMEM. The CST—based algo—
rithm is five times faster than splitMEM, while the BWT—based algo—
rithm is more than an order of magnitude faster. It is worth
mentioning that our two algorithms compute isomorphic—but not
necessarily identical—compressed de Bruijn graphs because the
node identifiers may differ.

To show the scalability of our new algorithms, we applied them
to five different assemblies of the human reference genome (UCSC
Genome Browser assembly IDs: hg16, hg17, hg18, hg19 and hg38)
as well as the maternal and paternal haplotype of individual
NA12878 (Utah female) of the 1000 Genomes Project; see
Rozowsky et al. (2011). The compressed de Bruijn graphs of their
first chromosomes (7xChr1, containing 1736 million base pairs) and
the complete seven genomes (7xHG, containing 21 201 million base
pairs) were built for the k—mer lengths 50, 100 and 1000. The ex—
perimental results in Table 1 show that the BWT—based algorithm
clearly outperforms the CST—based algorithm. It took slightly over
6 h (22 000 s) to construct the index of the seven human genomes
and less than 2 h (6000—7000 s) to build the graph with the
BWT—based algorithm for these genomes and a specific value of k
(5 0, 100 or 1000). Table 2 lists some statistics about the compressed
de Bruijn graphs.

In pan—genome analysis, S : S1#S2#  Sm_1#Sm$ is the con—
catenation of multiple genomic sequences S1, .. . ,Sm, separated by
a special symbol #. (In theory, one could use pairwise different sym—
bols to separate the sequences, but in practice this would blow up
the alphabet.) This has the effect that # may be part of a repeat.

The ﬁrst row in a block speciﬁes the experiment. The second row shows
the graph size in bytes per base pair. Rows 3—6 contain the numbers of edges,
nodes, uniqueNodes and repeatNodes, respectively. Rows 7—10 show the
average out-degree of the nodes as well as the average string length of the
nodes, uniqueNodes and repeatNodes. The remaining rows (if applicable)
contain the percentage of the nodes that are shared by x sequences.

Our CST—based algorithm mimics splitMEM in this respect,
whereas the BWT—based algorithm treats the different occurrences of
# as if they were different characters. Assuming that # is the second
smallest character, this can be achieved as follows. As explained in
the Supplementary Material, all right—maximal k—mers can be deter—
mined without the entire LCP—array if the algorithm in Beller et al.
(2013a) is used. If there are m — 1 occurrences of # in total and this
algorithm starts with m — 1 singleton intervals [i..i], 2 gigm, in—
stead of the #—interval [2..m], then the different occurrences of #
are treated as if they were different characters.

4 Discussion

We have presented two space—efficient methods to build the com—
pressed de Bruijn graph from scratch. An experimental comparison
with splitMEM showed that our algorithms are more than an order
of magnitude faster than splitMEM while using significantly less
space (two orders of magnitude). To demonstrate their scalability, we
successfully applied them to seven complete human genomes.
Consequently, it is now possible to use the compressed de Bruijn
graph for much larger pan—genomes than before (consisting, e.g. of
hundreds or even thousands of different strains of bacteria). Although
the BWT—based algorithm is the clear winner of the comparison, CST—
based algorithms are still important. This is because STs play a central
role in sequence analysis and most bioinformatics curricula comprise
courses that cover this important data structure. It is therefore con—
ceivable that a bioinformatician might be able to come up with a suf—
fix tree algorithm that solves his/her problem at hand, but not with an
algorithm that is based on the BWT and/or related data structures. If
the space requirement of the ST is the bottleneck in the application,
one can use a CST instead. CSTs with full functionality are, e.g. im—
plemented in the succinct data structure library (sdsl) of Gog et al.
(2014). On the downside, extra features such as suffix skips are not
implemented in those libraries so that a direct implementation of a
suffix tree algorithm by means of a CST might not be possible.

Future work includes parallel implementations of the algorithms.
Moreover, it should be worthwhile to investigate the time—space trade—
off if one uses data structures that are optimized for highly repetitive
texts, see Navarro and Ordoﬁez (2014) and the references therein.
Most important, however, is to address the problem of compressing
the ‘compressed de Bruijn graph” itself. (Our experiments show that for
smaller k, the size of the graph can be larger than the size of the index,
e.g. the graph for the seven human genomes and k :50 takes 1.65
bytes per base pair, whereas the BWT—index requires only 1.13 bytes per
base pair.) Very recently, two Bloom filter methods were presented
that can be used for this purpose. Solomon and Kingsford (2015) intro—
duced the Sequence Bloom Tree to support sequence—based querying of
large—scale collections of thousands of short—read sequencing experi—
ments and applied it to the problem of finding conditions under which
query transcripts are expressed. The second approach by Holley et al.
(2015) is closer to the splitMEM approach. Their data structure—the
Bloom Filter Trie (BFT)—allows to efficiently store and traverse the
uncompressed de Bruijn graph. In the Section Conclusion of their art—
icle, Holley et al. (2015 ) write ‘Future work concerns the possibility to
compress non—branching paths. . . ” This is exactly what splitMEM and
our new algorithms do, so maybe the combination of both approaches
will yield the ideal pan—genome representation.

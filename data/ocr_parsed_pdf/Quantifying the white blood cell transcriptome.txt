ABSTRACT

Motivation: We investigate and quantify the generalizability of the
white blood cell (WBC) transcriptome to the general, multiorgan
transcriptome. We use data from the NCBl’s Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO) public repository to define two datasets for
comparison, WBC and 00 (Other Organ) sets.

Results: Comprehensive pair-wise correlation and expression level
profiles are calculated for both datasets (with sizes of 81 and 1463,
respectively). We have used mapping and ranking across the Gene
Ontology (GO) categories to quantify similarity between the two sets.
GO mappings of the most correlated and highly expressed genes
from the two datasets tightly match, with the notable exceptions of
components of the ribosome, cell adhesion and immune response.
That is, 10 877 or 48.8% of all measured genes do not change >10%
of rank range between WBC and 00; only 878 (3.9%) change rank
>50%. Two trans-tissue gene lists are defined, the most changing
and the least changing genes in expression rank. We also provide a
general, quantitative measure of the probability of expression rank
and correlation profile in the 00 system given the expression rank
and correlation profile in the WBC dataset.

1 INTRODUCTION

One of the reasons that the Classiﬁcation of malignancy was one
of the earliest human applications of microarray transcriptional
proﬁling (Golub et (11., 1999) was that the tissue to be Characterized,
the tumor, was extracted as a matter of a routine surgical oncological
care. Other Clinical domains have lagged because the tissue involved
in a pathophysiology may not be reasonably obtained from a
living individual (e.g. in behavioral or psychiatric disorders) or
the organ speciﬁcity of a disease is unclear (e.g. type II diabetes
mellitus or hypertension). Increasingly, investigators have explored
the possibility of Classifying, prognosticating and Characterizing the
mechanism of diseases using the gene expression patterns measured
in white blood cells (WBCs) (Coppola et (11., 2008; Padmos et (11.,
2008; Scherzer et (11., 2007; Washizuka et (11., 2009).

For those studies seeking to ﬁnd the mechanisms/genes
dysregulated in the tissue of interest, the large majority have been
structured very similarly: a direct comparison is made between
expression proﬁling of peripheral blood and the speciﬁc tissue
where the disease is known to develop. An alternative method is to
establish the degree of isomorphism between the peripheral blood
transcriptome and the overlap in expression proﬁles from a ﬁxed
number of representative human tissues (e.g. brain, colon, heart,
kidney, etc., altogether nine tissue types) (see Liew et (11., 2006).
To the surprise of many, these investigations have proven to show
considerable shared transcriptome across these tissues. We adopt
here a systematic survey approach using the ever-growing mountain
of public microarray expression data of both WBC and dozens of
other tissues, under a variety of conditions and pathophysiological
states. Our goal is to provide a quantitative estimate of the
generalizability of gene expression ﬁndings in WBC to those in
other tissues. We seek to identify the most robust similarities and
corresponding differences in a genome-wide expression proﬁles, and
to quantify them appropriately. We hypothesize there will be robust
correlations that survive the well-known variability of the multiply
sourced gene expression database such as the Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO) (Barrett et (11., 2005), that allow large fractions
of the peripheral blood transcriptome to be reﬂected in other organs
and tissues.

This hypothesis (heretofore referred to as the WBC relevance
hypothesis) entails the following three questions: (i) to what extent
do those genes with the highest levels of expression in the WBC
transcriptome also have high levels of expression in other organ
systems? Speciﬁcally, can we quantify how the rank of the gene
in WBC informs us of the rank in non-WBC tissues? (ii) How
do correlations between pairs of genes in WBC inform us of
their correlation in non-WBC tissues? (iii) How does the overall
correlation structure [e.g. Relevance Network (Butte et (11., 1999)]
of WBC compare to those of other tissues? To the extent that the
WBC relevance hypothesis is supported we explore whether the
informativeness of WBC gene expression is broad or varies by
speciﬁc ﬁinctional categories. We look at both the broad categories
of gene annotation (Ashburner et (11., 2000; Dennis et (11., 2003),
such as apoptosis, as well as examining individual genes. We used
the NCBI’s GEO to ﬁnd experiments measuring WBC expression
and a large number of experiments on non-WBC tissues that we
lump into the Other Organ (OO) category. To minimize the noise
from inter-platform comparisons (Nimgaonkar et (11., 2003), we used
only those data obtained on the GEO’s GPL96 platform for both the
WBC and 00 categories. This resulted in a total of 1463 samples

for the OO and 81 samples for the WBC set. The 00 set consists
of about 95% solid tissue samples and about 8% are cancer-related
tissues (see Section 2.2).

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

The overall ﬂow of the analysis is summarized in Figure 1. The major steps
are listed in the ﬁgure caption and are also explained in detail.

2.1 GEO datasets

We have selected the NCBI’s public archive GEO as a source of the
microarray expression data (Barrett at 611., 2005). To minimize the noise
across platforms (Nimgaonkar at 611., 2003). we have elected to use only

datasets that were taken by the GPL96 platform. corresponding to the HG-
U133A chip by Affymetrix. and only included probeset-averaged expression
levels. A copy of the GEO database was downloaded on April 5. 2006. An
outlier detection and removal analysis was performed (Butte. 1999). There
are 1463 and 81 samples in the OO and WBC dataset. respectively.

2.2 Quantify tissue types in the 00 set

To quantify the types of tissues across the 00 set. we utilize the R package
GEOquery to download and parse out the annotation for each of the 1463
samples assigned to the set. Four of the ﬁelds in the GSM annotation were
used: ‘title’. ‘organism’. ‘source’ and ‘description’; the list is presented in
the Supplementary Table S1.

Overall. 27 GSM samples are no longer available from GEO and thus
cannot be included in the statistics. There are 1387 samples that are from

solid-tissue organs. or ~95% of all samples in the 00 set. One hundred
and sixteen (or ~8%) are samples that come from malignant tissues. The
resulting tissue categories distribution is shown in Figure 2.

2.3 Pair-wise correlation computation

For each of the datasets we have about ~250 million pair-wise correlations
between the 22 283 REF_IDs on the GPL96. Computations were carried out
on an HPC Cluster at Partners HealthCare System. Inc.

2.4 ‘Top N’ most highly expressed and correlated gene
lists as false discovery rate cutoff parameters

The selection of the top N used for the GO categories mapping statistics was
based on a false discovery rate (FDR) (Benjamini. 1995; Schweder. 1982;
with the speciﬁc q-Value thresholds described below.

For the most highly expressed gene list. we have transformed the
expression levels averaged over all samples to a ‘standard score” (z-score).
followed by a call to the ‘fdrtool” R package to determine the corresponding
q-Values (Strimmer. 2008). Both 00 and WBC cases were computed and
the minimum of the two cutoff parameters was taken to be the global FDR
cutoff parameter. The speciﬁc choice of N = 1000 used in the analysis below
corresponds to an FDR cutoff q-Value = 0.02.

Similarly for the case of top N most correlated gene lists. we
have transformed to z-scores for the Mutual Information Content (MIC)
(Strimmer. 2008) and also used |r| for the case of the Pearson”s correlation
coefﬁcient. Q-Values were computed for both similarity measure cases and
the minimum of the two was taken. The most correlated pairs list was
transformed to gene lists by adding the two members of all pairs less the
overlap set of genes between the members. Here. an FDR q-Value of 0.005
corresponds approximately to N = 1000 (most correlated genes) parameter.
for which comparison results are listed below.

2.5 Deﬁnition of change scores

Given two ranked lists of genes. we have deﬁned a change score of each
gene as the signed integer equal to the number of positions its rank changes
between the WBC and 00 datasets.

2.6 Test for independence of intersection of GO
categories

We have utilized the X2 test of independence to analyze the results listed
in Table 2 for the WBC and 00 overlap. Each of the lines in Table 2 was
fed into chisq.test() in R (ver. 2.10.1) with the parameter ‘simulate.p.value
= TRUE” set so that a Monte Carlo sampling simulation of the P-Value is
performed. The average P: 0.0004998 is based on 2000 MC simulations.

2.7 General least squares and principal component
analysis ﬁtting procedures

For the expression proﬁle modeling procedure. we ﬁrst applied the low
entropy ﬁler and then have removed the ribosome-related genes by removing
all genes that are annotated to belong to these two GO categories:
(i) 5840. annotation:“ribosome”” and (ii) 5842. annotation:“cytosolic large
ribosomal subunit (sensu Eukaryota)”. We have retained the more restrictive
low-entropy condition (for the WBC case) to keep the list of genes equal
in the OO and WBC expression sets. Both low-entropy and the removal of
ribosome genes procedures amounted to take 300 probes off the genes list.
For the list of remaining genes. we have averaged the expression levels for
each of them over the number of the samples in their corresponding dataset.
The resulting arrays were fed into the R lm() function and a linear model
was used for the functional relationship between 00 and WBC sets.

For the correlation proﬁles case. a similar procedure was used for
removing outliers (low-entropy ﬁlter) and the ribosomal-related set of genes.
For each correlation metric. we have transformed to standard z-scores and
computed the FDR q-Values for those pairs. and only retained q-Value below a
threshold ofoz < 0.05. The uniﬁcation of the OO and WBC sets was performed
and this enlarged set of correlation coefﬁcients between the gene pairs was
used as the basis for performing both general least squares and principal
component analysis (PCA) in the samples versus 00 and WBC gene-pair
correlation space. The corresponding sizes of the data matrices analyzed
were 30619 X 2 and 61 190 X 2 for the MIC and Pearson”s correlation
coefﬁcients. respectively. We used a standard singular value decomposition
method from the ‘pcaMethods” R package and lm() function for the linear
least squares. Results are summarized in Table 3.

2.8 Tissue of expression enrichment analysis in DAVID
A set of 48 REF_IDs for the GO category of sugar-binding genes (GO:5529)
was submitted to DAVID. These probesets were mapped to 36 internal
DAVID IDs. Only the ‘Tissue of Expression” submenu options were selected.
A functional annotation clustering was performed with the default options.
Results are listed in Supplementary Table S6.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Fold and rank analysis

To ﬁrst determine whether there was sufﬁcient similarity between
WBC and other tissues, we focused our analyses on those genes that
had behaviors that were mostly likely to be consistent: genes with
high levels of expression, with low entropies (i.e. low variances),
and with high correlations with other genes across the entire GEO
datasets on the GPL96 platform (see Section 2).

Solely reviewing the top N = 1000 most correlated genes
(i.e. those with high correlations with other genes in their respective
GEO datasets) and the1000 most expressed genes in the WBC and

00 categories (see Section 2.4 for a discussion on the choice of N),
we noted that the GO categories to which these 1000 genes belong
(a mere 4.5% of the total number of genes measured on the GPL96
platform) had a very high overlap. The distribution of distinct GO
categories within each of the three main GO hierarchies for 00 and
WBC datasets is shown in Figure 3. The hierarchies are ordered
by the number of genes annotated for 00 and the corresponding
number of annotations in WBC shown in the second column of the
ﬁgure. With the notable exceptions of components of the ribosome,
cell adhesion and the immune response, the annotations of these
top correlated genes in 00 samples are well represented by the
most correlated genes in WBC samples. For graphical compactness,
Figure 3 only shows the 30 most annotated GO categories in 00
samples. If we extend the analysis to all categories, then the GO
categories that change the most (as deﬁned by their Change Score
described in Section 2) include the ribosomal location and related
processes as before, but also includes nucleic acid binding, and
spliceosome-related processes as shown in the second column of
Table 1.

But this focuses on the differences rather than the larger
similarities between the WBC and 00 transcriptomes suggested by
the broad silhouettes in Figure 3. Indeed, 90% of the GO categories
change <1.37% for cellular components, 1.83% for molecular
ﬁrnction and 2.89% for the biological processes hierarchies, or in
average of slightly over 2%. The similarities between WBC and 00
are ﬁrrther quantiﬁed by examining which GO categories are shared
by the 1000 most highly expressed or the 1000 most correlated
genes in the two transcriptomes, respectively, as summarized in
Table 2. In all instances, the intersection is larger than any of
the distinct sets (ranging from 27% larger to 700% larger). The
details of the particular GO categories summarized in this table
are given in Supplementary Table S2. Of course, if all the genes
on the chip were used in this analysis, rather than the top 1000,
then all GO annotations would intersect completely across the two
transcriptomes, by deﬁnition. However, with only 4.5% of the genes
measured, the measured degree of overlap is highly improbable
(P=0.000499 by using Monte Carlo sampling simulation in X2
test, see Section 2). Supplementary Figure S1 illustrates the overall
stability of numbers of annotation by GO category by plotting the
frequency of change scores for each GO category. As shown, the

distribution of change score is centered on zero for all three GO
hierarchies. The top 1000 most expressed genes have a much tighter
distribution (more low change scores) than the 1000 most correlated
genes.

A broader examination of which genes change the most in their
rank (by entropy or by expression) within the 22 283 genes measured
on the GPL96 platform reveals a steep decline in the change in rank
of expression as illustrated in Supplementary Figure S2. That is,
10877 or 48.8% of all measured genes do not change >10% of
rank range between WBC and 00. Only 878 (3.9%) change rank
>50%. There is somewhat more change in rank of genes by entropy
as revealed in Supplementary Figure S3. That is, 5084 (22.8%) of
all genes do not change > 10% of rank range in entropy, and 4356
(19.5%) by >50%.

The individual genes that change the least in rank across WBC and
00, are itemized in Supplementary Table S3 as are those genes that
change the most. In the former list, are included HBB (hemoglobin
13 chain), H3F3A H3 histone, family 3A, MED6 (mediator of RNA
polymerase II transcription, subunit 6 homolog), FTL (ferritin, light
polypeptide), ACTGl (actin, gamma 1), B2M (ﬁ-2-microglobulin)
several HLA-related genes, several hemoglobin-related genes,
S100A9 (S100 calcium binding protein A9—calgranulin B). In
the latter list, are included the FCGR3B (Fc fragment of IgG,
low afﬁnity IIIb, receptor—CD16b), PSAP (prosaposin—variant
Gaucher disease and variant metachromatic leukodystrophy), CA1
(carbonic anhydrase I—most highly expressed in erythrocytes) and
UBB (ubiquitin B). In contrast to expression rank, UBB changes the
least in entropy rank between WBC and 00. Conversely, GAPDH
is highly invariant as viewed by change in rank in expression, but
is among the most changed in rank in entropy across WBC and
00. Many more genes have similar rank proﬁles in expression
and entropy: For example, H3F3A (H3 histone) is just as invariant
in rank as in expression of HLA genes, ribosomal genes and
several of the hemoglobins. The expression of HBB in avascular
and non-hematopoietic tissues has been previously documented
(e.g. Mansergh et (11., 2008).

3.2 Quantitative map between WBC and 00
transcriptomes

Having established the broad correlation between 00 and WBC
expression proﬁles, we next take the logical step of trying to ﬁnd
a quantitative relationship between the two transcriptomes. The
exact question we ask is: can one come up with the expression
rank in the 00 system given the expression rank in WBC? Or,
even more broadly, given the broader expression proﬁle (values and
cross-correlations) of a group of WBC genes how can one predict

with what probability? In doing this, we treat WBC expression (or
correlation) proﬁle as an independent random variable and determine
the conditional probability distribution of the OO expression or

Relevance networks generate graph of connected nodes in which
each node represents a gene and each edge represent a correlation
metric (e.g. Pearson’s) that exceeds a statistically signiﬁcant
threshold (Butte et (11., 1999, 2000).

Shown in Supplementary Figure S4 is the relevance network
for the WBC transcriptome depleted for ribosomal genes. The

and as a component of protein complexes that stably maintain
heterochromatin.) and PGDS (prostaglandin D2 synthase, plays a
role in the production of prostanoids in the immune system and
mast cells). The rank of these 200 top correlated gene pairs in
this WBC relevance network are compared with the ranks of those
same gene pairs in the 00 set, in Supplementary Figure S5. It does
reveal a signiﬁcant concordance in the ranks of correlation in gene
pairs from WBC and 00, even though the overall shape of the
presented distribution is somewhat peaked—the largest bin (N = 50)
corresponds to a rank change across WBC to 00 of maximum of
11.4%. Ninety percent of all WBC pairs do not change rank by
>31 positions or 15.5%. The top shared gene pairs are SF3B1 and
DDX5 (the ﬁrst is in the spliceosome and the other is DEAD domain
involved in spliceosome), YMElLl and FNTA (the ﬁrst is ATP-
dependent metalloprotease speciﬁc to mitochondria and the second
is a famesyl transferase, also involved in protein metabolism but in
the cytoplasm).

It is instructive to note in passing that the results reported here
do not depend on the actual permutation thresholds in the two
comparison sets. Since the two sets are very different in size (81
for WBC versus 1463 for 00), we did not use a permutation
scheme to select subsets for comparison (Kerr, 2009). Instead, we
deﬁne the number of genes used for the correlation analyses based
on global FDR thresholds. We built the relevance network of the
WBC correlation proﬁle based on a ﬁxed number (the top 200, as
reported in Supplementary Figure S1, most correlated pairs) as it is
of illustrative purposes only.

3.4 Transcription factors expression patterns:
the Mahoney atlas

The Mahoney is an atlas of transcription factors expressed in
the murine brain (Gray et (11., 2004). We determined how highly
expressed these TF”s were in the WBC. First, the homologues
of these 2342 human TF”s were mapped to their 2168 human
homologues by reciprocal best ﬁrst match (Moreno-Hagelsieb et (11.,
2008). Of those, 1212 are measured on the HG-U133A microarray.
The expression ranks of these 1212 were obtained from the WBC
transcriptome and are illustrated in Supplementary Figure S6. As
shown, the distribution of ranks is uniform over the range of ranks
measured by GPL96.

3.5 Gene ontology enrichment analysis

We used DAVID online tools (Dennis et (11., 2003) to perform
enrichment analysis of the set of 500 least-changing genes with
respect to Gene Ontology (GO) categories. The DAVID functional
annotation resulted in the 110 clusters listed in Supplementary
Table S4. The top cluster (enrichment score of 20.35) is clearly
reﬂecting the existence of a robust and well-correlated cluster of
ribosome-related genes (see discussion about Relevance graphs
above).

4 DISCUSSION

If the tools of functional genomics can be applied to peripheral
blood cell samples to develop biomarkers for other organs, two
questions are apparent: To what extent does expression in WBCs
reﬂect expression in other organ systems? Why should WBCs reﬂect
expression in other organ systems? This investigation focuses on the
ﬁrst question and we review some possibilities with regard to the
second at the end of this discussion.

Before a further discussion of our ﬁndings, here we comment
on the general validity of our approach. Two sets were deﬁned and
compared, the WBC and 00. The 00 set is composed of a large
number of different solid tissues (~95% of all samples come from
such tissue, see Fig. 2). Also, there was no discrimination between
diseased or normal samples in 00 or the WBC sets (i.e. ~8% of the
samples in 00 are from malignant tissues). In a sense, we compare
WBC expression to expression of an ‘averaged or generalized”
human tissue. A question might arise about the general validity of
such a procedure. To address it, we have redone the bulk of our
analyses for the case of an 00 set deﬁned as a superposition of
ﬁve samples taken at random from the solid tissue distribution in
Figure 2. The speciﬁc differences seen do not affect the quantitative
conclusions reported below (results not shown).

A bird’s eye view of the correspondence between the WBC and
00 transcriptome is provided by the GO (Ashburner, 2000). We
have performed a systematic mapping of the three main branches
of GO categories in the cases of the most correlated and expressed
genes, across the WBC and 00 datasets. From the results listed
in Figure 1 and Table 1, one is able to characterize the similarities
and the difference between the WBC and 00 transcriptomes. First,
the top most common annotations across the datasets show a tight
match, with the notable exception of the ribosome, cell adhesion
and the immune response GO codes; the nucleic acid binding
and spliceosome-related processes are added to this when one
considers all GO categories that change the most between WBC
and 00. Overall, 90% of the GO categories change only ~2% in
average across datasets. Next, focusing on the GO categories shared
between WBC and 00 in the expression and correlation spaces, the
intersections between the distinct gene sets across GO branches are
consistently larger than the distinct sets themselves, which is a highly
improbable for only 4.5% of measured genes (P=0.0004998 by
Monte Carlo sampling simulation in the X2 test; Table 2). This result
rules out the enrichment-by-chance hypothesis and suggests the high
level of overlap in GO annotation categories across the WBC and
00. Supplementary Figure S2 also demonstrates the overall stability
of GO categories change across WBC and 00, in both expression
and correlation spaces, as exempliﬁed by their change scores.

Two of the most changing (from WBC to 00) GO categories
and their corresponding genes are the ‘sensory perception of
sound” (biological process, GO code BP:7605) and ‘sugar binding”
(molecular function, MF:5529) listed in the second column
in Table 1. Some of the individual genes in the BP:7605
category are WRDl (WD repeat domain 1), MYH14 (myosin,
heavy polypeptide 14) and DIAPHl [diaphanous homolog 1
(Drosophila)]. Sugar-binding most frequent genes are LGALS8
[lectin, galactoside-binding, soluble, 8 (galectin 8)], PKDl
[polycystic kidney disease 1 (autosomal dominant)] and BCAN
(brevican). Additionally, the ‘nucleosome assembly” BP:6334 GO
category is quite overrepresented in going from 00 to the WBC
datasets (3 —> 14). Some of the genes included in this GO
category are H3F3A (H3 histone, family 3A), NAP1L4 (nucleosome
assembly protein 1-like 4) and HISTlHlT (histone 1, Hlt). The
complete lists of the genes included in these two GO categories are
listed in Supplementary Table S5.

To cross-validate the enrichment of sugar-binding and sensory
perception of sound categories in WBC, we have performed
enrichment analysis in DAVID using the ‘Tissue of Expression”
annotation option (see Section 2). For the sugar-binding individual
genes, Clusters #3 (enrichment score of 0.59) and Cluster #9
(enrichment score of 0.38) clearly indicate the relative enrichment of
this group of genes with respect to WBCs as a tissue of expression.
A similar analysis of the hearing genes has yielded a much weaker
WBC tissue association results bordering the method”s sensitivity
(results not shown).

We next took a more detailed look at some of the individual
genes in the least-changing group as presented in the Supplementary
Table S2. A GO terms enrichment analysis of those genes reveals
that two of the most overrepresented types of categories are
‘oxygen transport” (GO: 15671, BP), and ‘antigen presentation”-
related categories (GO:19882, GO:19883 and GO: 19884, BP;
Supplementary Material). These antigen presentation categories are
of course the genes part of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)

system, the name of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
in humans and are expected to be widely expressed across most
tissues (Shiina, 2009). Another story is the ‘oxygen transport”
category as exempliﬁed by a very stable levels of expression of
HBB (hemoglobin 13 chain) and several other hemoglobin-related
genes found in the list between WBC and 00 sets. One remote
but distinct possibility is the presence of contaminating red blood
cells (RBCs) in the samples of both groups. For example, albumin,
transferrin and some other major plasma proteins are quite abundant
in muscle tissues, but the presence of hemoglobin-related genes
in the WBC data is much more counterintuitive. To rule out the
possibility of RBC contamination, we have reviewed the annotation
for the GEO samples assigned to the WBC dataset (Supplementary
Table S6). Although it is difﬁcult to judge the exact sample collection
protocol from just the description ﬁeld in the GEO GSM format,
it appears that most studies had followed the proper protocols.
Therefore, the ﬁnding that HBB (hemoglogin 13 chain) and other
hemoglobin-related genes are widely expressed in WBC is a true, but
nevertheless a surprising one. The expression of HBB in avascular
and non-hematopoietic tissues has been previously documented thus
providing an example of another human tissue (and embryonic
development stage) where hemoglobin units might possibly play
novel development roles (Mansergh et (11., 2008).

Next, we have reviewed the list of 567 human housekeeping
genes (Eisenberg et (11., 2003) against the two lists presented in
Supplementary Table S3. It appears that the housekeeping genes
are well represented on both least changing and most changing
from WBC to 00 lists. Some of the most stable are e.g. HLA-
A/B/C (major histocompatibility complex, class I, A/B/C), TPTl
(Tumor protein, translationally controlled 1), VIM (Vimentin); some
of the most changing are e.g. TUBB (tubulin, f3), PSAP (prosaposin),
JUNB (Jun-B oncogene), CREBBP(CREB binding protein).

Finally, we would like to brieﬂy touch upon some of the biological
and physiological underpinnings of why the WBC transcriptome
might reﬂect the state of (including disease) another tissue or set
of tissues. First, as blood cells contact and interact with all human
tissues and transport and convey bioactive molecules (i.e. oxygen,
metabolites, nutrient, cytokines and hormones, etc.), there is a
distinct possibility that the WBC will themselves reﬂect the state(s)
of those tissues. Conceivably, these subtle changes due to interaction
of WBCs with diseased tissues might trigger speciﬁc changes in
the gene expression of the WBCs paralleling the initial stimulus. A
recent study comparing expression in nine human tissues with the
WBC transcriptome has found that ~80% of the WBC expression
proﬁle as being shared with any given tissue (Liew, 2006). After
all, a ‘cell is a cell” and the most fundamental characteristics of any
cells are expected to be shared across all human tissues. Secondly,
the WBC are the ‘etiological organ or tissue” for some diseases,
a good example being asthma which is not a disease of the lungs
(Weiss et (11., 2009). Thirdly, some diseases affect all tissues, e.g.
Pompe”s disease affects the ﬁrnction of the lysosomes, which are
found in all types of tissue (Vellodi, 2005).

5 CONCLUSION

We study the similarity between the WBC and 00 transcriptomes
using public repository expression data (GEO). The 00 sets has a
wide representation of solid tissues (~95%) and normal (~92%)
tissue samples.

WBC transcriptome

 

We utilize GO mapping and ranking across correlation and
expression level proﬁles selected by FDR thresholds to quantify
similarity between comparison sets. We ﬁrst identify that
components of the ribosome, cell adhesion and immune response are
among the most pronounced differences between the transcriptomes.

We next build predictive models of the rank in 00 given the
rank in WBC, across correlation (using linear least squares) and
expression level spaces (using general least squares and PCA), after
removing the ribosome-related genes. Two trans-tissue gene lists
were also deﬁned, the most- and least-changing in expression genes.
We also consider the individual genes on both ends of the spectrum
of WBC-OO change and gain further insight using ad hoc analyses,
including looking at TF expression in WBC from Mahoney atlas as
well as GO enrichment in tissue of expression.

We report on an overall very tight, quantitative match between the
WBC human transcriptome and the transcriptome of a generalized
set of solid tissues, across both correlation and expression level
spaces. These ﬁndings are essentially independent on exact subset
of tissues in the generalized 00 set indicating a shared ﬁrndamental
biology connection between the WBCs and 00s in the human body.
Our results underscore the utility of the peripheral blood cells in
applying the ﬁrnctional genomics tools for discovering biomarkers
for other organs.

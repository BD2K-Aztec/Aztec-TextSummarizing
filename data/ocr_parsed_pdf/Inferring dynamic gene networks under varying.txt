ABSTRACT

Motivation: Elucidating the differences between cellular responses
to various biological conditions or external stimuli is an important
challenge in systems biology. Many approaches have been
developed to reverse engineer a cellular system, called gene
network, from time series microarray data in order to understand a
transcriptomic response under a condition of interest. Comparative
topological analysis has also been applied based on the gene
networks inferred independently from each of the multiple time
series datasets under varying conditions to find critical differences
between these networks. However, these comparisons often lead
to misleading results, because each network contains considerable
noise due to the limited length of the time series.

Results: We propose an integrated approach for inferring multiple
gene networks from time series expression data under varying
conditions. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the
first reverse-engineering method that is intended for transcriptomic
network comparison between varying conditions. Furthermore, we
propose a state-of-the-art parameter estimation method, relevance-
weighted recursive elastic net, for providing higher precision
and recall than existing reverse-engineering methods. We analyze
experimental data of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells stimulated by
epidermal growth factor or heregulin with several doses and provide
novel biological hypotheses through network comparison.

1 INTRODUCTION

Systems biology aims to understand a cellular process through
quantitative mathematical models (Cantone et al., 2009). One Of
the important problems in systems biology is to reverse-engineer
the dynamics of gene—gene interactions, called gene network, from
time series expression data. Several techniques have been developed
for the mathematical modeling of these dynamics from time series
expression data, notably differential equation (Bansal et al., 2006;
Chen et al., 1999), state space model (Hirose et al., 2008; Rangel

et al., 2004), vector autoregressive (VAR) model (Opgen-Rhein and
Strimmer, 2007; Shimamura et al., 2009) and dynamic Bayesian
networks (Perrin et al., 2003; Tamada et al., 2009).

In this light, a key challenge in the application of these methods
is to develop new strategies and theoretical frameworks for the
comparative analysis of multiple gene networks, that is, to infer
gene networks from multiple time series expression data under
various biological conditions or external stimuli, for example,
different doses of a chemical compound or a growth factor, and
to identify subnetworks (interactions) that are conserved or not
conserved among the conditions. Comparative topological analysis
provides a very good opportunity to reveal the differences between
regulatory structures and understand cellular responses to varying
conditions. However, this is not an easy task because the number
of candidate interactions is very large as compared to the number
of true interactions. This problem becomes more serious for short
time series data. As of October 2009, in time series experiments
designed to comparison between multiple biological conditions from
public databases such as Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and
Array Express, >90% were short time series with fewer than 10
time points. In these cases, the application of existing reverse-
engineering methods to these short time series data leads to poor
performance in that a large number of false positives and false
negatives are produced in network inference. Therefore, the noisy
interactions inferred using existing methods make it difﬁcult to
identify critical differences and similarities between conditions and
to produce useful results.

In this study, we propose a novel-integrated approach for inferring
multiple gene networks from time series expression data under
varying biological conditions. It should be noted that earlier
algorithms aimed to infer a gene network under a condition of
interest and they were not intended to compare multiple gene
networks, that is, to infer each gene network independently based
on only samples from a condition of interest, called exact samples
(Hu, 1994). Our approach is different from these earlier approaches
in that it aims at both network inference and comparison, and
it uses exact samples along with samples from other conditions,
called relevant samples (Hu, 1994). To the best of our knowledge,
other than the proposed method, no other method is available for
reverse-engineering multiple gene networks in order to compare
transcriptomic responses under different conditions.

Figure 1 shows a conceptual view of the proposed method. Our
key assumption is that large regions of the gene networks are
conserved and that small regions are changed between conditions.
This implies that a network model for generating a sample under

compounds) from time series microarray experiments. Traditional inference

information (black line).

a condition is partially related to the other network models
for generating a sample under other conditions. We develop
a new parameter estimation method called relevance-weighted
recursive elastic net (RW-RENET) for inferring multiple network
structures based on both exact sample information and relevant
sample information. RW—RENET automatically infers conserved
interactions from samples under all the relevant conditions and
unconserved interactions from samples under each condition with
a similarity based on the comparison between estimators. This
enables us to achieve a higher prediction accuracy of inferring gene
networks as compared to earlier methods without losing critical
differences between gene networks under certain conditions. We test
our approach using simulated data and experimental data of MCF-7
human breast cancer cells to assess its performance relative to that
of the existing methods.

2 METHODS
2.1 Model description

We assume that time series expression data are obtained from In different
biological conditions. More formally. for each condition (I: l,...,m). we
have xi”, . . .126). where x?!) =(xil)(ti), . . . ,xg)(t,»))’ represents the mRNA
concentrations of [7 genes at time step i whose j—th element x;1)(t,») indicates
the concentration of the j—th gene transcript measured at time ti. and n, is the
number of observed time points in the l-th condition.

To represent the dynamics of geneigene interactions across time under

the l-th biological condition. we assume a Gaussian process of the form

We expect most gene transcripts to be regulated by only a small subset of
a total of [7 gene transcripts. and thus assume that a large number of by:

U:l,...,p and k=l,...,p) will be zero. The estimates for allj and k

provide a network topology among gene transcripts under the l-th biological

condition; nodes represent gene transcripts and an edge j —> k exists if and

2.2 Estimation

Without loss of generality. we explain the problem of estimating the para-

meters bil:,...,b](,l: and 02” under the ﬁrst condition. We assume that the

density functions fka), . . . ,fkm) might be related to the density function of the

ﬁrst condition ka). In this case. xii), . . . , x211) are called the exact samples and

xil),...,x£,l,) (l:2,...,m) are called the relevant samples (Hu. 1994). Since
the conditional density function of x21)(ti+1) depends on the parameters by)
and 01:1). we rewrite the conditional density as ¢(x1:l)(ti+1)|x(l)(ti); $0,020).

Classical maximum likelihood estimators of by]: 0: p) and 01:1)

(11),...,x£,11) alone. To incorporate the information from

the relevant samples xil),...,x£,l,) (l:2,...,m). we use the weighted log.

where p2”) is an weight parameter called likelihood weight for down-

weighting the relevant samples according to the degree of similarity between
ka) and fly). Note that although maximizing the weighted log-likelihood

(2) provides estimators of lelk). these estimators are not sparse. Therefore.

we need to further investigate whether bllk) is zero or non-zero. which is a
structure learning problem. In many cases: this task is computationally hard
(Chickering et al.. 2004).

For simultaneous parameter estimation and structure learning. we propose
a new parameter estimation method called RW-RENET to maximize the

following regularized weighted log-likelihood:

where  and A?) are regularization parameters of the L 1- and Lz-penalty

terms. respectively. and  is an importance weight of  that enables a
different amount of shrinkage for each coefﬁcient in the L1 -penalty term. The
L [-penalty shrinks some coefﬁcients to zero (Tibshirani. 1996). which gives
a sparse structure of graphical models. In contrast. the Lz-penalty encourages
the grouping effect in that highly correlated variables will be in or out of the
model and it stabilizes the solution (Zou and Hastie. 2005). The importance
weights  U = l, . . . ,p) allow for different tuning parameters for different

coefﬁcients . respectively. If  takes a large value. an estimator 
tends to be zero. In contrast. if 14/; 1,: takes a small value nearly equal to zero.

 tends to be non-zero. These weights encourage a more sparse structure
of the network than lasso and elastic net. For practical implementation.

these weights can be estimated by  = l ﬁll—2;}; | +6) where  is a plug-in
estimator and e is a positive constant to avoid dividing zeros (Shimamura
et al.. 2009). The degree of sparsity of 1k) with RW-RENET depends on the

values of p19”).  A?) and  Q: l,...,p). Therefore. the problem of
learning the network structure leads to the problem of selecting the values

of these parameters. as discussed in a latter section.

2.3 Similarity between densities

To obtain reasonable estimates for p2”). we present a method based on the

comparison between the estimated parameters. We expect that if the density
1:!) is similar to the density fkm. the parameters  U:1,...,p) are also
similar to the parameters bjllk). respectively. We then deﬁne the likelihood

weights p21 ’0 by

with hyperparameters oz and )3. The 021’ is the Pearson’s correlation

coefﬁcient between the estimators b; 1k) and by: U = l, . . . ,p). In the proposed
likelihood weights (4). if the estimators  are similar to the estimators

. the likelihood weight of pi”) approaches that of pi”). Otherwise.

p21 ’1) approaches zero. The likelihood weights (4) depend on two parameters

at and [3. as discussed in Section 2.4.

2.4 Model selection criterion

The regularization parameters A31: and A31). the importance weights wok)

(l 5 k 5 p) with the hyperparameters oz and [3 in the logistic function (5) affect
the sparsity of  that is. they determine the network structure. Therefore.
the problem of choosing these parameters is a crucial issue in practical
situations. We investigate this problem from the Viewpoint of statistical
model evaluation and derive an information criterion for choosing these
parameters theoretically.

Hens et al. (2006) derived a bias-corrected weighted Akaike information
criterion for evaluating models estimated by the weighted maximum
likelihood. To extend their methodology to the framework of evaluating
models estimated by the regularized weighted maximum likelihood. we
derive an unbiased estimate of the degrees of freedom for the regularized
weighted log-likelihood (3). Degrees of freedom can be used to quantify
the model complexity estimated by Ll-regularization (Zou et al.. 2007).
For simplicity of explanation. we introduce the notations

Using the result of a previous study (Shimamura et al.. 2009). an unbiased

Substituting the total number of estimated parameters in the bias-corrected

2.5 Learning algorithm

In this section. we propose iterative algorithms for inferring gene networks
from time series gene expression data based on RW-RENET; an iterative
learning algorithm for inferring a gene network under the l-th condition and
an iterative learning algorithm for inferring multiple gene networks under
m conditions. Supplementary Materials 1 and 2 describe the details of the
two algorithms and their pseudocodes. respectively.

These algorithms automatically update p2”). Ail?” kg) and  based

Note that the algorithms do not guarantee an increase in the regularized

sum of mWAIch). 11::lmWAIch). In these algorithms. the likelihood
weights pg”) (1 5 l, r 5 m and l 5 k 517) are ﬁrst initialized and then updated
by mWAICczl). The selection of the initial values of p21”) is described in
Supplementary Material 3.

3 REVERSE-ENGINEERING SYNTHETIC
NETWORKS

To evaluate the performance of RW—RENET, we performed a
comparison with other traditional reverse-engineering approaches
with L1-regularizati0n, namely, lasso (Tibshirani, 1996) and elastic
net (Zou and Hastie, 2005), on simulated time series gene expression
data from synthetic networks. It should be noted that elastic net is

equivalent to RW—RENET when we apply an uniform importance
(1)

weight W]. k = l and an uniform likelihood weight
(1, r) _ 0, 17$ r
pk — { l, l: r ’

and lasso is a special case of elastic net when we set A(l)=0.
Therefore, we can estimate gene networks with these traditional
approaches using the same algorithm based on RW-RENET.
It should also be noted that lasso, elastic net and RW—RENET
estimate gene networks with different numbers of edges. We then
controlled the numbers of edges identiﬁed using lasso and elastic
net to be equal to that using RW-RENET by deleting all the edges
whose llAajskl lies below a given threshold T. Here, lasso and elastic

net using such a threshold are described as lasso-T and elastic net-T,
respectively.

We generated two different scale-free graphs with p: 120 nodes
according to the Barabasi—Albert model, where the distribution of
the degree k follows the power law P(k)0(k_1‘1. For each of the
two graphs, ﬁve edges were randomly removed and 15 edges were
randomly added, and we then generated eight synthetic networks
(N1,...,N3), where N1 and N5 were the ﬁrst two scale-free graphs,
and {N2,...,N4} and {N5,...,Ng} were generated from N1 and
N5, respectively. Therefore, the structures of the four networks
{Nj+k;k=0, ...,3} (i=1 or 2) were similar to each other but
those of {N1, ...,N4} were different from those of {N5, ...,N3}. The
coefﬁcient bl]: corresponding to the non-zero edge was simulated
uniformly and randomly in the ranges [—0.8 to —0.4] and [0.4
to 0.8]. We simulated time series data with 10 time points from
each of the eight networks based on the Gaussian process model
(1). These settings are similar to the real data that we analyze in
Section 4. We also simulated time series data of different sample
size with n=20,30,40 and 50 in order to assess whether RW-
RENET gained better performances as the number of observations
was increased. We set a grid of parameters ({0.1,0.3,0.5} (n= 10)
or {05.10} (n=20,30,40 and 50) for lg), {100,300, 500} for a
and [0820.05 :0.9] for £3) and then infer gene networks using RW-
RENET. The reason for setting different grid values for Ag) is that
it depends on the number of observations.

The performance of each algorithm was evaluated from two
viewpoints: network selection and prediction for new observations.
In terms of network selection, the performance was evaluated on
how many overall, conserved and unconserved interactions were
recovered. Here, conserved and unconserved interactions between
N,- and Ni are deﬁned by C,,j={£,-n£j} and 6,-J={(8,-u£j)\(£jn
81)}, where 8,- and  indicate the edge sets of N,- ande, respectively.
As a performance measure of the network inference, we used F -sc0re
(Meyer et al., 2007b), which is the harmonic mean of the precision
(PR) and the recall (RC), that is, F = 2 X PR >< RC / (PR+RC). Here,
PR and RC are calculated by ISDSI/ISI and ISDSI/ISI, where S
is a true set of overall interactions 81-, conserved interactions Cisj
and unconserved interactions (ll-J; 3 is an inferred set of S by a
reverse-engineering algorithm; and IS I represents the size of S. The
F -sc0re is a performance measure because it tries to realize abalance
between the PR and the RC, and it is high only if both PR and
RC are high. In terms of prediction, the performance was assessed
on whether the method can predict new observations from the
true network rather than overﬁtting observations used for reverse-
engineering networks. Here, 50 new observations were generated
from each of the eight networks using different initial values of

Xll)(t0) and the prediction error of an estimator for l-th condition is
deﬁned using newly generated observations by

where 31:00,) (1 f i 350) are standardized observations with mean
zero and unit variance that are not used for reverse-engineering

networks and  (1 fj,k§p) are the standardized estimated
coefﬁcients.

Figure 2a—d shows the performance of ﬁve methods (lasso,
elastic net, lasso-T, elastic net-T and RW-RENET) when reverse-
engineering eight synthetic networks where the number of time
series data for each condition is 10 through 100 simulations. Each
point indicates the average value of F -sc0res or prediction errors
for 100 simulations. The F -sc0res for lasso-T and elastic net-T were
larger than those for lasso and elastic net, respectively. Whereas,
the prediction errors of lasso and elastic net were smaller than
those of lasso-T and elastic net-T, respectively. We found that RW-
RENET outperformed lasso, elastic net, lasso-T and elastic net-T
in all cases. The values of F -sc0re with RW-RENET represent
increases of approximately 1.9, 3.6 and 1.7 times as compared with
lasso, approximately 1.9, 3.5 and 1.6 times as compared with elastic
net, approximately 1.9, 2.5 and 2.0 times as compared with lasso-T
and approximately 1.9, 2.0 and 2.0 times as compared with elastic
net-T in (a), (b) and (c), respectively. While, the values of prediction
error with RW-RENET show decreases of ~7, 6 , 21 and 21 %
as compared to lasso, elastic net, lasso-T and elastic net-T in (d),
respectively.

The lower four panels of Figure 2 show the performance of the ﬁve
methods when the number of observations is increased by 10 from
10 to 50. As can be seen, all methods gain better performances with
increased number of observations. Although the differences between
RW-RENET and the other method in performance are smaller as
increasing the number of observations, RW-RENET was superior to
lasso, elastic net, lasso-T and elastic net-T in terms of both network
selection and prediction for new observations. Therefore, the results
of simulated data clearly indicate that RW-RENET has signiﬁcant
advantages in various situations when comparing multiple networks.

4 ANALYSIS OF MCF-7 BREAST CANCER CELLS
STIMULATED WITH EPIDERMAL GROWTH
FACTOR AND HEREGULIN

In this section, we investigated the following using time series
microarray data of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells upon
stimulation with four doses of two different ErbB ligands, epidermal
growth factor (EGF) and heregulin (HRG) (Nagashima et al., 2007):
whether RW-RENET can recover known biological relationships
and whether the conserved or non-conserved interactions estimated
by RW-RENET support biological hypotheses and provide new
ﬁndings. We considered eight dose conditions (stimulation with
0.1, 0.5, 1.0 and 10.0 nM of either EGF or HRG) and measured
the expression values at eight time points (0, 5, 10, 15, 30,
45, 60 and 90 min) using Affymetrix GeneChip U133A-2. These
datasets are available from GEO (Accession Number GSE6462).
The expression values with 10.0 nM at 60 min were not observed,
and were instead estimated by linear interpolation. These datasets
were also normalized by faster cyclic loess (Ballman et al., 2004).

4.1 Evaluating performances of inferring gene
networks using the cell system markup language
reaction database

The evaluation of the prediction performances of network inference
under each condition requires topology information of real
networks that are still unknown. Therefore, as a gold standard of
real networks, we used biological interactions from the system
markup language (cell system markup language, CSML) reaction

database (Nagasaki et al., 2008), which is a systematically
reconstructed database of the manually curated high-quality
pathway database TRANSPATH (Krull et al., 2006), using CSML
(http://www.csml.0rg/). The database contains information about
more than 100 000 direct gene regulations and signal transduction
regulations in mammals.

In addition to lasso and elastic net, we further performed a
comparison with different network inference algorithms: mutual
information networks with ARACNE (Basso et al., 2005), CLR
(Faith et al., 2007) and MRNET (Meyer et al., 2007a); graphical
Gaussian model (GGM) with an empirical Bayes approach
(Schafer and Strimmer, 2006); VAR model with the James—
Stein shrinkage (Opgen-Rhein and Strimmer, 2007); and dynamic
Bayesian networks using ﬁrst order conditional dependencies
(Lebre, 2009). For estimating gene networks with these approaches,
we used the following softwares: R-package minet (Meyer et al.,
2007b), R-package GeneNet (http://strimmerlab.0rg/), R-package
GlDBN (Ltﬂore, 2009) and R-code for the shrinkage estimation
of the VAR network (http://strimmerlab.0rg/). Although mutual
information approaches such as ARACNE, CLR and MRNET intend
to infer static relationships between genes rather than time-lagged
relationships, we considered time series data as static data and
applied them. Following the same idea of Shimamura et al. (2009),
we also considered a time-lagged data matrix whose (i, j)-element
indicates lel)(ti+1)—lel)(ti) and used it as an input of ARACNE,
CLR and MRNET in order to increase their capabilities of recovering
the time-lagged relationships. These modiﬁed versions of ARACNE,
CLR and MRNET were described as ARACNE-D, CLR-D and

MRNET-D, respectively. To calculate mutual information for
inferring mutual networks, a Spearman-based mutual information
was used. Here, mutual information approaches and GGM infer
gene networks as undirected graphs, while the other approaches
infer gene networks as directed graphs. To compare different types
of graphs, we converted the real and the inferred directed networks
to undirected ones and then performed comparisons. Although VAR
model using the James—Stein shrinkage, dynamic Bayesian networks
using GlDBN and Gaussian process model using lasso, elastic net
and RW-RENET can identify self-feedback loops, these inferred
self-feedback loops were not used to ensure a fair comparison
between algorithms.

Nagashima et al. (2007) identiﬁed 254 probes corresponding
to 240 genes as EGF- and HRG-regulated genes. Among the
240 genes, each of the 120 genes has no connection with the
other 239 genes within a path length of 2 in the CSML reaction
database, and therefore these 120 genes were removed. As a result,
all the methods were run on time series expression proﬁles with
119 probes corresponding to the remaining 120 genes for inferring
gene networks under eight conditions. We calculated the shortest
path matrix among all combinations of the 120 genes, and 62
direct interactions except for 113 self-loops and 1072 interactions
mediated through one gene (shortest path=2) were considered as
true interactions of the gold standard model.

It should be noted that the results are not perfect owing to the
limited knowledge of the real network (Bansal et al., 2006). Thus,
the performance of each algorithm was assessed on the number of
true positives (TP) and the PR (the proportion of the TP against all

The RAND refers to the expected performance of the algorithm that randomly selects the same number of geneegene pairs estimated by RW—RENET through 1 000 000 simulations.
Numbers in bold indicate the algorithms that performed signiﬁcantly better (P-value <0.05) than the random model that selected the same number of signiﬁcant edges randomly.
The P-value was calculated by calculating a null distribution based on the random model through 1 000 000 simulations.

the identiﬁed edges) that are relative criteria. We chose the thresholds
for the other methods so that the numbers of interactions inferred
by the other algorithms are equal to that by RW-RENET. We also
note that, since all the methods have the same numbers of inferred
interactions, the largest TP means the largest . The setting of the
tuning parameters of RW-RENET was also as same as that described
in Section 3.

As a result, the proposed method inferred eight gene networks
under stimulation with different dose levels of EGF (0.1, 0.5, 1.0
and 10.0 nM) and HRG (0.1, 0.5, 1.0 and 10.0 nM), which include
82, 94, 93, 82, 103, 105, 119 and 115 directed edges, respectively.
Supplementary Figures 1—4 illustrate the four inferred gene networks
under EGF stimulation and Supplementary Figures 5—8 illustrate the
four inferred gene networks under HRG stimulation, respectively.
After converting the direct graphs to undirected ones, the numbers
of undirected edges were 82, 93, 93, 82, 103, 105, 118 and 115,
respectively.

Table 1 lists the results of the analysis for the eight time series
datasets. In Table 1, RAND refers to the expected performance of
the algorithm that randomly selects the same number of gene—gene
pairs as that of RW-RENET through 1000 000 simulations. The
results can be summarized as follows: ARACNE, CLR, MRNET,
ARACNE-D, CLR-D, MRNET-D, GGM, VAR-J S and GlDBN
were better than random selection for 7, 6, 6, 6, 4, 3, 4, 4 and
4 datasets, respectively. Interestingly, we found that the usual
ARACNE, CLR and MRNET were better than their time-lagged
versions.

All algorithms expect for ARACNE and MRNET have a small
number of P-values <0.05 for the hypothesis that the difference
in terms of the number of TP was signiﬁcant as compared to that

with random selection. In contrast, Ll-regularization approaches
with lasso, elastic net and RW-RENET were better than random
selection for 7, 7 and 8 datasets, respectively. In particular, RW-
RENET outperformed lasso and elastic net in 7 datasets and it had
the largest number of P-values <0.05 among all algorithms (ﬁve
P-values <0.05). These results indicate that the proposed method
could recover the known biological interactions more stably than
the existing algorithms.

4.2 Comparing similarities between eight conditions

We investigated whether we can support recent biological
hypotheses by comparing the conserved interactions between
varying conditions. Nagashima et al. (2007) hypothesized that
transcription that is directly modulated by upstream pathways should
be controlled in a dose-dependent manner of EGF and HRG. Among
the 120 genes, 1 gene was regulated by only EGF, 78 by only HRG,
and 41 by both EGF and HRG. If their hypothesis is correct, we
expect that a certain amount of interactions in gene networks for
different dose levels of either EGF or HRG would be conserved.
We calculated how many edges were conserved between the two
networks for all combinations of the eight biological conditions.
Figure 3 shows 2D histograms that indicate the results of
these calculations for each of the 12 inference algorithms. For
clear visualization, the numbers of conserved interactions between
the same conditions were set to 0. The complete details of
the numbers of conserved interactions for the 12 algorithms are
provided in Tables 1—12 of Supplementary Material, respectively.
Clearly, all methods except for RW-RENET identiﬁed a small
amount of conserved interactions, contrary to the hypothesis of

all combinations of the eight biological conditions (stimulation of EGF 0.1 . 0.5. 1.0 and 10.0 nM. and HRG 0.1. 0.5. 1.0 and 10.0 nM).

Nagashima et al. (2007). There is an extremely high possibility that
the inferred networks include a large number of spurious interactions
due to the small number of time points. This also implies that it is
quite difﬁcult to compare the similarity and dissimilarity between
the inferred networks under different conditions using these existing
methods. However, the proposed method succeeded in reﬁning the
performance of identifying the conserved interactions by taking
advantage of the increasing numbers of relevant samples with
the regularized weighted log-likelihood estimation. For example,
in comparison between stimulation with 0.5 and 1.0 nM HRG,
ARACNE, CLR, MRNET, ARACNE-D, CLR-D, MRNET-D,
GGM, VAR-JS, GlDBN, LASSO and ENET identiﬁed 8, 19, 7,
10, 5, 5, 11, 5, 7, 7 and 7 conserved interactions including 1, 3, 1,
1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1 and 0 known biological interactions in the CSML
reaction database, respectively. Whereas RW-RENET identiﬁed 50
conserved interactions with 10 known interactions. Supplementary
Tables 13—24 list the number of known interactions in the CSML
reaction database that were included in the conserved interactions
estimated by the 12 algorithms, respectively. Therefore, only the
result of a comparison between the conserved interactions based on

RW-RENET in Figure 3 supports the hypothesis of Nagashima et al.
(2007), at least for the HRG-induced networks.

4.3 Comparing differences between EGF and HRG
stimulations

We also investigated whether we can provide a new biological
hypothesis by comparing the unconserved interactions between
EGF and HRG stimulations. We calculated out-degree, the number
of directed edges that start from each node, for each inferred
network using RW-RENET. Genes with a large out-degree are called
hub genes, and they are considered to be essential in complex real
networks (Albert and Barabasi, 2002). Supplementary Table 24
lists out-degrees of the 120 genes in the eight gene networks
under stimulation with different dosages of EGF and HRG. We
found that SIKI, JUN, KLF6, EGRZ, DUSPI and MAP3K8 have
different out degrees between EGF 10.0nM and HRG 10.0 nM
illustrated in Figure 4; 5, 0, 1, 22, 1 and 0 outdegrees for EGF
10 nM as compared with 27, 8, 9, 28, 6 and 4 outdegrees for HRG
10 nM. Interestingly, these six genes have F 0S as upstream genes.

It is known that EGF and HRG stimulations lead to proliferation
and differentiation of MCF-7 breast cancer cells, respectively
(Nagashima et al., 2007). Our comparative analysis based on RW-
RENET produced a new hypothesis that FOS might be a key
gene that is strongly associated with this ligand-speciﬁc cell fate
determination. Again, only the result of network comparison based
on our method supported the recent biological hypothesis and
provided a new hypothesis.

5 CONCLUSION

We addressed the problem of inferring and comparing multiple
gene networks between varying conditions from time series gene
expression data. Numerous approaches have been developed using
mathematical models in order to reverse-engineer a gene network
under a condition of interest from time series data. However, no
studies have addressed the problem of gene network inference
from the viewpoint of network comparison. We proposed a novel
integrated approach for reverse-engineering multiple gene networks
that is intended for transcriptomic network comparison. A state-
of-the-art estimation method called RW-RENET automatically
infers conserved interactions from samples under all the relevant
information and unconserved interactions from samples under each
condition with a similarity based on the comparison between the
estimators; this method achieves higher PR and RC than the
earlier methods in gene network inference and comparison. We
also supported biological hypotheses and provided new biological
ﬁndings in experimental data of MCF-7 breast cancer cells under
EGF and HRG stimulations through comparative network analysis
using RW-RENET.

We would like to discuss about computational time of RW-
RENET. Figure 5 presents the total calculation times using one core
of Intel Quad-Core Xeon Processor E5450 (3.0 GHz) when reverse-
engineering eight synthetic networks where we ﬁxed the number

of variables to 120 and varied the number of observations from 10
to 50 by 10. We observe that the time complexity is nearly linear
(more precisely it is more linear because of matrix calculations) with
respect to the number of observations. For the ﬁxed sample size, the
time complexity should be also linear with respect to the number of
variables (genes).

A limitation of our model comes from the assumption that time
lag is stationary (time points are equidistant). This is not the case
for many real applications where the sampling time points are
unequally spaced and vary with different conditions. However, we
believe that this problem can be solved by using a state space
representation (Kojima et al., 2009), which is one of our future
researches. Another limitation of our method comes from the high
computational cost. As described above, the RW-RENET algorithm
using single CPU is applicable only to medium-sized networks with
several 100 genes. To estimate larger gene networks based on larger
samples, super-computers should be useful, because the computation
of RW-RENET can be performed completely in parallel for every
gene.

With the rapid correction of high-dimensional and heterogeneous
data of complex cellular dynamic processes under various types of
biological conditions, we expect that the development of approaches
for comparative network analysis is of increasing importance. We
believe that the proposed method will serve as a valuable and timely
contribution for better understanding of the differences between
complex cellular dynamics and molecular diversities, and for easy
management of these large and complex datasets.

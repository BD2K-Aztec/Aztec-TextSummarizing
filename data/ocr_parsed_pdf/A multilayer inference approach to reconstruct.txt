ABSTRACT

An important topic in systems biology is the reverse engineering of
regulatory mechanisms through reconstruction of context-dependent
gene networks. A major challenge is to identify the genes and the
regulations speciﬁc to a condition or phenotype, given that regulatory
processes are highly connected such that a speciﬁc response is typ-
ically accompanied by numerous collateral effects. In this study, we
design a multi-layer approach that is able to reconstruct condition-
specific genes and their regulation through an integrative analysis of
large-scale information of gene expression, protein interaction and
transcriptional regulation (transcription factor-target gene relation-
ships). We establish the accuracy of our methodology against syn-
thetic datasets, as well as a yeast dataset. We then extend the
framework to the application of higher eukaryotic systems, including
human breast cancer and Arabidopsis thaliana cold acclimation. Our
study identified TACSTD2 (T ROP2) as a target gene for human breast
cancer and discovered its regulation by transcription factors CREB, as
well as NFkB. We also predict KIF2C is a target gene for ER—/HER2—
breast cancer and is positively regulated by E2F1. The predictions
were further confirmed through experimental studies.

1 INTRODUCTION

The accumulation of high-throughput transcriptome data has
driven the development and application of computational
approaches to infer networks, elucidate gene regulation and iden-
tify targets. Initial network inference methods based on gene
expression data were successful with prokaryotes (Faith et al.,
2007). However, higher eukaryotes systems, with their higher
number of genes, provided many more candidate genes (several
hundred) and interactions (more than a thousand) [e. g. (Jaffrezic
and Tosser-Klopp, 2009; Stephanopoulos et al., 2004)]. This
generates numerous hypotheses, and with this sheer number,

most of the candidates cannot be investigated or validated
through experiments, making it difﬁcult to assess the utility of
the proposed approach on these systems.

Generating too many hypotheses arises, in part, due to discon-
nect between the computational and biological assumptions
applied in the models. The direct applications of learning/
mining methods aim to infer ‘functional interactions’ in accord-
ance with certain presumed mathematical deﬁnitions, which may
not be appropriate in a biological context. For example, biologic-
ally, the ‘candidate genes’ speciﬁc to a phenotype usually refer to
genes that assume a major response for a condition or to causal
genes involved in the development of a phenotype. In contrast,
computationally, statistical analyses are applied to identify those
that are expressed differentially that help to classify two condi-
tions (Saeys et al., 2007), which does not deﬁne causal genes. In a
biological context, interactions refer to direct physical or regula-
tory interactions, whereas computationally the interactions
inferred are statistical correlations between gene expression
that may not necessary indicate direct regulatory relationships
(Markowetz and Spang, 2007; Segal et al., 2003; Wang et al.,
2003; Werhli et al., 2006). To address this challenge, one could
develop a model based on the biological question to be
addressed. For example, a correlation between two genes could
suggest ‘regulating’, ‘being regulated’ or an indirect relationship
in a biological context. The model of ARANCE assumes indirect
interactions should have lower correlations and is thereby able to
predict transcriptional interaction by removing the indirect inter-
actions (Margolin et al., 2006). Alternatively, incorporating
physical interactions by integrating proteiniprotein interaction
(PPI) and proteiniDNA (P—DNA) data with gene expression
data could help bridge and facilitate the interpretation of the
computational results into biological context (Chuang et al.,
2007; Ideker et al., 2002; Ulitsky and Shamir, 2007). In these
previous studies, the genes are selected based on differential
expression and correlation analyses and then superimposed
onto a physical interaction network, which helped to interpret
the identified genes/interactions.

Nevertheless, the aforementioned approaches still will provide
large numbers of hypotheses with hundreds of genes and inter-
actions identiﬁed in the reconstructed network. Notably, a
majority of the candidate genes/interactions are often related
to general processes that are not speciﬁcally responsive to the
condition being investigated. With this large number of possible
candidates literature search to ‘manually’ characterize many of

these predicted candidates are typically performed to identify
speciﬁc targets for further experimental investigation based on
one’s expertise. Alternatively, enrichment analysis, such as gene
set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (Subramanian et al., 2005) and
GO (http://www.geneontology.org/) annotations have been
applied in many reverse engineering studies to interpret the re-
sults, which provide understanding of the ‘general’ processes
involved rather than the direct molecular mechanisms.

Another challenge is that a majority of the reconstruction
methods used to identify transcriptional interactions/regulations
are based on correlation. However, an absence of a correlation
does not preclude a possible regulatory relationship, e.g. post-
transcriptionally regulated interactions, including RNA process-
ing, post-translational modifications (e.g. phosphorylation) or
co-factors of transcription factors (TFs). Note that analyses of
gene expression cannot distinguish the effect of RNA processing,
protein modiﬁcations or protein co-factors; thus, all these events
are considered as ‘post—transcriptional’ effects on the TF activity
in this study, and throughout this article. Although more
recently, methods have been developed to uncover these poten-
tial post-transcriptional interactions (Lefebvre et al., 2010; Wang
et al., 2009). Notably these recent methods are not ‘reconstruc-
tion approach’ in the strict sense and further require expert
knowledge that the user must provide. For example, the user
has to provide the TF and target gene pair along with a list of
potential regulators to determine the potential post-transcrip-
tional modulators.

The overall objective here is to provide regulatory hypotheses
that are more speciﬁc to the condition of interest rather than
those related to general responses. Our approach separates the
network reconstruction into multiple levels, each addressing a
speciﬁc biological question wherein a particular scenario of bio-
logical regulation is modeled. There are two major steps; ﬁrst is
to identify the candidate genes that are speciﬁc to the phenotype
and have distinct expression pattern under the condition of inter-
est (layer I). We note that the problem of generating too many
hypotheses is because the predictions are not speciﬁc enough.
For example, in biological systems, a speciﬁc and direct response
to a perturbation usually is accompanied by a cascade of collat-
eral effects on many genes and dozens of regulatory modules in
the network. For example, Stephanopoulos et a]. (2004) showed
that in an experiment that knocked out the GAL80 gene in yeast,
and comparing the transcriptomes before and after the treatment
showed that such modulation of a single pathway eventually
caused a global effect throughout the whole biomolecular inter-
action network. The specific response of the knock out experi-
ment is the activation of the galactose—processing pathways by
eliminating GAL80’s repression on the GAL4 transcription fac-
tor; nevertheless, the repression of this one pathway resulted in
hundreds of differentially expressed genes and dozens of acti-
vated modules, making it difficult to identify the essential ‘trig—
ger’, i.e. the speciﬁc pathway in response to the perturbation.
Therefore, in a typical network inference or module analysis,
many of the genes and modules identified would likely be such
‘side effects’ or collateral responses rather than direct and speciﬁc
effects. For example Wang et al., 2010) in identifying the activity
of the p450 gene in human liver, network analysis (clustering and
network reconstruction based on correlation) identified >5000
differentially expressed traits spanning many general functional

modules including immune response, cell cycle, lipid metabolism,
macromolecule biosynthesis and so forth. This provides a ‘rough
measurement’ of the overall inﬂuence, but it is difﬁcult to iden-
tify from this list the speciﬁc pathway(s) that regulates these
effects and to guide the experimental design for further in-
depth functional studies. Therefore, the speciﬁc responses are
usually concealed by many less speciﬁc effects, which are difﬁcult
to distinguished based on current network analysis methods.

We address this challenge by taking an alternative approach to
identify the target genes that are speciﬁc for the condition of
interest, and which may not necessary be hubs in a network
(Basso et al., 2005). Our approach compares the condition of
interest with multiple conditions, where the multiple conditions
are grouped together, which is in contrast to current studies that
evaluate multiple conditions (Churchill, 2004; McCarthy et al.,
2012; Smyth, 2004). Thus, in this ﬁrst step of our network
reconstruction framework, we integrate microarray data from a
diverse set of conditions to provide a common context (more and
better controls) for the expression behaviors of the genes and
apply advanced feature selection technique to identify the
target genes that are most speciﬁc to the condition being inves-
tigated. Incorporating these diverse conditions for comparison in
the feature selection of genes and interactions reduces the false-
positive rate and enhances the speciﬁcity.

The second step of our method identiﬁes the TFs of these
genes, including post-transcriptionally regulated TFs, by incor-
porating interaction data to account for the TF activity, beyond
the expression level of the TF. Thus, from these ‘speciﬁc’ target
genes identified in layer I, the network is expanded in layer II
based on known and predicted interactions with these genes,
obtained from the PPI and proteiniDNA networks, which pro-
vides conditional gene regulations. A ﬁltering approach based on
mutual information is applied to the physical interaction net-
work to reconstruct the regulatory pathway from the candidate
genes. In layer III, we infer the conditional TF activity to identify
the major regulators in the gene network, accounting for post-
transcriptional regulation. The multiple layers of learning with
their distinct biological assumptions at each level capture differ-
ent biological features in the regulation to achieve reconstruction
of condition-speciﬁc gene networks that account for both tran-
scriptional and post-translational molecular interactions. We
establish the accuracy of our methodology against synthetic
datasets, as well as a yeast dataset. Finally, we extend the frame-
work to the application of higher eukaryotic systems.

2 METHODS
2.1 Assumptions

The specific genes: we deﬁne the genes that are ‘speciﬁc for a condition or
phenotype’ as the genes that have distinct expression pattern that are
unique to the condition of interest (thus, the biological phenotype in
the condition is represented by unique combination of expressions).
Genes that can be identiﬁed as differentially expressed by comparing
two conditions in the traditional setting may not necessary be ‘speciﬁc’
genes, as they could include genes involved in collateral changes on gen-
eral processes. Nevertheless, when a gene is identiﬁed to be speciﬁc for a
given condition, it does not preclude the possibility that the gene plays a
role in other conditions, just that it may play a more signiﬁcant role for
the given condition, and thus is ranked higher under this condition than

in other conditions, which contributes to their distinct expression pattern.
A limitation in identifying these speciﬁc genes is that there could be genes
that encode for proteins that are expressed at a similar level but have
functional changes across conditions (e.g. because of post-transcriptional
modiﬁcations), these targets will not be identiﬁed from gene expression
data. We do not assume the gene expression to be independent, and we
do not use linear combination of genes as in discriminant analysis to
identify genes, as the biological meaning of such linear combination of
expression is unclear.

The specific interactions: we deﬁned the speciﬁc interactions as the
regulations by TFs of the speciﬁc genes, which could be responsible for
the distinct expression pattern of these genes under the condition of inter-
est. In layer II, similar to previous network reconstruction approaches, we
assume the TFs’ and their target genes’ expression are correlated to some
degree, and more importantly, there should be an increase in correlation
for the condition where a TF is activated. It is possible that a TF’s activity
depends on its co-factors; thus, the interacting proteins of a TF are also
taken into account when computing the correlations. The potential con-
nections are based on P-DNA (for TFigene) and PPI (for proteiniTF)
information, and then these interactions are scored by computing the
conditional mutual information (MI)7unconditional MI to determine
interactions that are condition speciﬁc (higher conditional MI than un-
conditional MI). In layer III, a correlation between the expression of the
TFs and their target genes is not assumed. To account for TF activity, the
putative target genes’ expression is assumed to reﬂect the TF activity.
Intuitively, a TF could be activated if many of its putative targets sud-
denly seem to be highly expressed for a given condition. However, that
does not suggest or assume that the TF can regulate these targets under
all conditions, or that the TF should regulate all of its targets for any
given condition. Thus, the assumption in layer III is similar to MARINa
(GSEA) in which the information of the putative targets is used in esti-
mating the TF activity. The information would not need to be complete,
but the quality of the putative target is important to achieve a good
estimation of the TF activity, as false positives could introduce irrelevant
effects. Thus, in layer III when applied to the human and plant datasets,
the putative targets are restricted to those that are identiﬁed from the
literature-curated databases.

2.2 Identiﬁcation of features

To identify features (genes and TFs) that can distinguish one phenotype
from all the other phenotypes, we need an approach that from a biolo-
gical perspective should fulﬁll the following requirements: (i) the
approach should weigh and rank genes according to their ‘importance’.
(ii) The approach should account for the fact that features (genes) are not
all independent. Gene expression is controlled by a complex regulatory
network; thus, there are intrinsic relationships between genes. (iii) There
are relationships between phenotypes whereby some phenotypes have
transcriptomes similar to our phenotype of interest; these phenotypes
should be more relevant for comparison to understand the unique
changes in our conditions.

Therefore, the approach should adopt a learning model that fulﬁlls
these requirements:

(1) A selection process that maps from the original feature space
X to a new feature space X’, by scaling each dimension with
weight w.

Xintﬂf:X—>WX ||W||2=c w30

(2) To account for the fact that features (genes) are not all indepen-
dent, each feature should be evaluated in the context of other
features and samples, which suggests a ‘local learning’ model.

(3) By comparing the transcriptomes, for a sample x”, we attempt to
ﬁnd its ‘nearest neighbor’ of the same phenotype is Hx”, whereas

its nearest neighbor from a different phenotype is Mx” and deﬁne a
‘margin’: p” =d(x,, ,Mx”) — d(x,, ,Hx”). We try to ﬁnd a mapping
such that the distance between the different phenotypes d(x,,,Mx,,)
are as large as possible, whereas samples within a phenotype
d(x,,,Hx,,) are as close as possible. Hence, the problem can be
formularized to maximize the margin:

max Zn pn(w) With respect to w, subject to H w “2: c w 3 0

Based on the modeling, there is a family of algorithm called ‘Reliet‘
that can solve this optimization problem, which we applied to identify the
most speciﬁc genes and TFs for a given phenotype.

2.3 The ReliefF algorithm

The basics of the ReliefF algorithm (Kononenko, 1994; Robnik-Sikonja
and Kononenko, 2003) are provided in the Supplementary Methods.
When ReliefF is used to identify condition-speciﬁc genes, the feature
vector for each gene is the expression of the gene in different samples.
When ReliefF is used to identify condition-speciﬁc TF activity change,
the feature vector for each TF is the summation of the expression of its
target genes in different samples based on the TRN (potential transcrip-
tional regulatory network, see Supplementary Methods).

2.4 Identiﬁcation of regulatory relationships
We compute the differences between conditional mutual information and
unconditional mutual information:

MI (gene pairlcondition) — MI( gene pair in all conditions)

for genes on paths to the target genes in the reference physical inter-
action network (PPI and P-DNA network), and each gene pair consists a
potential ‘regulator’ and a ‘target gene’ in the network (Supplementary
Methods).

2.5 Datasets

We used yeast, human and plant gene expression datasets, PPI data and
P-DNA interaction data (see Supplementary Methods).

2.6 Experimental studies

We performed experimental studies on human mammary epithelial and
breast cancer cell lines. The detail methods of the cell culture, quantitative
real-time polymerase chain reaction (RTiPCR), western blotting, RNA
interferences and the statistical analysis of RTiPCR results are in the
Supplementary Methods.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Layer 1. Identiﬁcation of candidate genes

In contrast to traditional microarray analysis where one com-
pares the condition(s) of interest with a single ‘untreated’ condi-
tion as the control, we propose that integrating multiple
conditions of gene expression data and applying a context-sensi-
tive algorithm ReliefF (see Section 2) identifies the genes that
speciﬁcally respond to the condition being investigated. Unlike
previous applications of pairwise comparison with ReleifF
(Wang, 2004), we apply ReliefF to a diverse set of conditions.
To model this, we generate a simulated expression dataset
(Fig. 1A and Supplementary Methods) with specific and general
changes for each condition. Different methods are applied to
identify the genes that change uniquely for a given condition

Fig. 1. Application of ReliefF on the integrated dataset with multiple
conditions. (A) The data are a simulated dataset with ﬁve conditions
(conditions AiE) plus a reference condition (ref). The goal is to identify
the genes that change uniquely for a given condition (condition A).
Traditional approach compares condition A with the reference condition,
whereas we suggest applying ReliefF on condition A against all the other
conditions that are available. (B) The ROC curves for identiﬁcation of
speciﬁc genes for the condition of interest (condition A). We compare two
different approaches: traditional approach based on t-test and the ReliefF

erence control, and integrating all the conditions available and comparing
against condition A. The AUC (area under curve): ReliefF with multiple
conditions>ReliefF with two conditions>t—test with two condi-
tions> t-test with multiple conditions. (C—E) The ‘MEGA’ yeast micro-
array dataset: the samples are plotted in 2D with their ﬁrst two principle
components. The condition ‘AltCarb’ is the condition of interest.
(C) A traditional treated/untreated analysis. (D) We plot other condi-
tions, such as hyperoxide stimulation, heat stress, etc. The samples of
these conditions are similar to samples in the ‘AltCarb’ condition as
compared with the same ‘untreated’ reference samples; thus, the gene
lists that are identiﬁed could be similar. (E) The integrated dataset
provides better coverage of the sample space, and ReliefF compares
‘AltCarb’ samples with all other samples in different conditions to achieve
better speciﬁcity. Nearest neighbors of AltCarb condition used in the
ReliefF procedure are shown in green. The Principle Component
Analysis (PCA) plot and ReliefF are performed in MATLAB with cus-
tomized codes. (F) The score of the yeast genes provided by the ReliefF
analysis correlates with the importance or relevance of the gene to the
speciﬁc condition

(condition A in Fig. 1A). The ROC curves in Figure 1B shows
that ReliefF applied on multiple conditions performs best.

We then evaluate our approach by reconstructing a gene
network for the ‘AltCarb’ condition, i.e. adding extra alternative
carbon source, in which the essential regulatory pathway is
known a prioriinamely, the GAL pathway. When adding
extra carbon sources into the yeast media, if the carbon source
is galactose, the GAL pathway, also known as the ‘Leloir path-
way’ will turn ON, if it is other types of carbon source, such as
glucose, the Leloir pathway is turned OFF leading to ‘glucose
repression’ (Rubio-Texeira, 2005). A successful gene selection
procedure is expected to identify the entire GAL pathwayithe
four GAL genes (GALl, GAL2, GAL7 and GAL10), which are
the essential transporters and enzymes for this condition.

In contrast to traditional analysis where conditions are com-
pared with a same, untreated reference (Fig. lCiD), our algo-
rithm analyzes an integrated reference pool (we use the ‘MEGA
yeast’ dataset, see Supplementary Methods) as a representation
of the diversity of gene expression behaviors to identify the most
speciﬁc genes for a target condition (Fig. 1E). The scoring of the
genes for the ‘AltCarb’ condition by ReliefF is shown in
Figure 1F. The four GAL genes are ranked as the top four
genes by ReliefF, and their scores (0.3414) are much higher
than the rest of the other genes (majority of which scored
<0.2). Therefore, our approach is able to re-discover all four
speciﬁc genes in the yeast Leloir pathway, which constitutes
the core metabolic processing by yeast in response to changes
in the carbon sources.

To compare with a traditional approach, we also performed a
per-gene permutation-based t—test between the galactose treated
and the control (untreated) yeast samples, which is a standard
method often applied to microarray analysis to uncover differ-
ential expression. This analysis identiﬁed 236 genes (P<0.01)
with GAL7, GAL2, GALl, GAL10 ranked at 17th, 53rd, 87th
and l24th, respectively, based on their P—Value. Many of the
genes identiﬁed are related to more general processes of stress
or environmental changes, e.g. MSN2/4 for general stress
responses, which are not directly associated with the condition
under investigation. Therefore, our approach identified the most
likely effectors, and the integration of multiple seemingly unre-
lated conditions, in fact, effectively reduced the number of
non-speciﬁc gene candidates.

3.2 Layer 11. Identiﬁcation of the potential gene
regulatory relationships

To explore the regulatory mechanisms of the candidate gene
‘effectors’ identiﬁed in layer I for a given condition, we integrate
PPI and P—DNA or TRN (from motif search, ChIP-chip data or
literature information if available) data of the same system
(denoted as the reference network) and apply mutual informa-
tion on the expression data to identify potential regulators of
these target genes.

Traditional approaches to determine gene regulatory relation-
ship are commonly based on mutual information (or correlation)
between pairs of genes (Ideker et al., 2002; Li et al., 2007;
Margolin et al., 2006), with comparison between a condition of
interest and a reference condition. Instead of using a single ‘un-
treated’ reference condition, we suggest incorporating multiple

conditions to provide a better reference pool and compute the
difference between the conditional and unconditional mutual
information (see Section 2 and Supplementary Methods). This
idea is essentially an extension of the two-way relationship (gene
x and gene y) to three-way dependencies (gene-pair x1, x2 and y)
in calculating the mutual information from gene expression, such
that the regulators of y, genes x1 and x2 could be readily distin-
guished. This approach, also called causal-filtering, was initially
suggested by Bontempi and Meyer (2010).

Therefore, Layer II can be used to identify the factors (i.e.
genes or proteins) that directly (physically) interact with and
causally regulate the target genes. The information on the phys-
ical interactions is derived from PPI and proteiniDNA inter-
action data, and the potential causal factors are inferred based
on the condition mutual information computed from the gene
expression data of these interactions.

We establish the accuracy of our methodology against a yeast
dataset of conditional TF binding. There are 34 ChIP-chip data-
sets for yeast samples treated with H202 (Harbison et al., 2004).
We used the TFigene binding indicated in these conditional
ChIP-chips experiments (with binding P-Value <0.001) as the
true TFigene regulatory relationships, and applied our method
in layer II to infer conditional regulatory information for these
34 TFs. Figure 2 shows the ROC curves for inferring the TF7
gene regulatory relationships. Incorporating information of
potential TRN based on binding motifs on the gene promoters
and literature information (solid lines in different colors) signiﬁ-
cantly reduce the false-positive rate as compared with
approaches that do not take advantage of such information,
shown in dotted lines (e. g. mutual information only based
approaches). Our approach of incorporating multiple conditions
enhances the speciﬁcity, which is shown by the red solid and
dotted lines (corresponding to with and without TRN) as com-
pared with the traditional setting denoted by the green solid and
dotted lines.

We applied layer II on the yeast ‘AltCarb’ condition to recon-
struct a condition-specific network, which resulted in 27 nodes
and 88 interactions (Supplementary Fig. $1). The GAL switch
genes identiﬁed in layer I are used as the targets in this layer to
retrieve their potential regulators. Many known regulators of the
GAL pathway, such as GAL4 and GAL80, are identiﬁed in the
network because their expression level (e.g. GAL80) or their
interacting partners’ (e.g. GAL80 as the interacting partner of
GAL4) expression level is correlated with the target genes under
this condition, leading to a potential regulatory pathway to the
target genes. For comparison, we applied ARACNE and ob-
tained thousands of nodes and interactions, but for its top-
ranked module, we cannot ﬁnd evidences in the current literature
to suggest the involvement in the GAL response (see
Supplementary Text). This suggests that many ‘collateral
responses’ may be as stronger as the GAL response. Therefore,
by integrating the PPI and P—DNA interactions and combining
layers I and II, our approach effectively reduced the number of
hypothesis, focused on the most specific candidates and identi-
ﬁed potential ‘causal’ and ‘direct’ regulators.

Nevertheless, similar to many previous network reconstruction
approaches, layer II is based on statistical dependencies between
gene expression, assuming a correlation between the expression
of the regulator and its targets, which may not necessarily hold in

and expression proﬁle for the condition of interest (H202). Those TF7
gene pairs with signiﬁcant changes (top 30) on both TF activity and gene
expression are elevated to the top of the list of potential TFigene regu-
latory relationship based on MI measurement of the multiple condition
setting. The result is shown in blue solid lines

all cases, especially when the transcriptional regulation involves a
transcription factor that requires post-transcriptional modifica-
tions or co-factors to be activated (Wu and Chan, 2011). Thus,
we add another layer in our framework, layer III, to address this
challenge by accounting for the TF activity.

3.3 Layer III. Inference of TF activity and transcriptional
regulation

In eukaryotes, post-transcriptional modiﬁcations (includes post-
transcriptional, post-translational modiﬁcations or protein co-
factors) are required for many TFs to be activated to regulate
their target gene expressions. Although such information cannot
be directly measured with microarrays, the target genes’
expression can reﬂect such regulatory events. Therefore, given
potential target genes predicted from motif search, ChIP-chip
data or literature information, we can infer the changes in TF
activity. In this layer, we use the summation of target gene ex-
pression level as the feature of a TF in the sample and apply
ReliefF to identify TFs that show distinct activity (i.e. features)
in the condition of interest as compared with all the other
conditions.

Layer III is applied to the yeast H202 condition, and the re-
sults are shown by the blue lines in Figure 2. With the inference
of the TF activity, the ROC shows a further increase in the spe-
ciﬁcity (achieve a false-positive rate of <0.01) of the predicted
relationships that are ranked at the top 10%.

We also applied layer III to identify the TFs that regulate the
expression of the GAL genes under the AltCarb (adding extra

Fig. 3. Network reconstruction of the GAL pathway. We estimate the
activity of the 2S transcription factors that can bind to GAL genes in the
TRN and use the top three TFs predicted to reconstruct the essential
regulatory networks, with the interactions extracted from the TRN (green
lines with arrow or dot at ends) and the PPI (blue lines, PPI information
obtained from www.yeastgenome.org). We compare different approaches
in estimating the TF activity (Wu and Chan, 2011): (A) TYPE 1: TF
activity is determined by its expression level; (B) TYPE 2: TF activity is
determined by the differential expression of potential target genes; (C)
TYPE 3: TF activity is implicated by the oo-expression of the target
genes; (D) our approach: use the target gene expression information
and integrate a wide range of conditions to determine the change of
TF activity. The true network includes regulators GAL4, GALSO and
IMP2 (ranked 1, 2 and 3, respectively, in our approach) shown by the
nodes colored in magenta, which are speciﬁc TFs regulating the GAL
pathway for galactose utilization and glucose repression in the AltCarb
condition. Nodes colored in gray are non-speciﬁc TFs for the AltCarb
condition, including AFTl (iron utilization and homeostasis), MSN2
(general stress response), GCN4 (amino acid biosynthesis), PIP2 (oleate
response) and SFPl (ribosome biogenesis and cell cycle). The functional
annotations are based on SGD (http://www.yeastgenome.org)

carbon source) condition. We use the top three predicted TFs to
reconstruct an essential regulatory network for the GAL system,
based on known PPI- and P-DNA-binding information. The
results shown in Figure 3D demonstrate that our approach can
re-discover the true network that includes the regulators GAL4,
GAL80 and IMP2, the three speciﬁc TFs that regulate the GAL
pathway for galactose utilization and glucose repression (Rubio-
Texeira, 2005). In contrast, previous approaches based on TF
expression level (TYPE 1, approaches based on mutual informa-
tion or correlation, e. g. Bayesian Network), differences in target
and non-target gene expressions (TYPE 2) or correlations within
target genes (TYPE 3) (Wu and Chan, 2011) did not correctly
identify the essential regulatory network (Fig. 3). In particular,
GAL4 is post-transcriptionally regulated by its protein
interaction with GAL80 (Rubio-Texeira, 2005), whose activity
changes can be captured by our approach but not the other
approaches compared. A GSEA-based approach (e.g.
MARINA) may be able to ﬁnd the enrichment of the target
gene groups for these TFs; however, it gives a lower speciﬁcity,
as many other TFs are identiﬁed to be more enriched for the
AltCarb condition than the 3 GAL regulators (Supplementary
Table S1).

3.4 Applications on human breast cancer

3.4.1 Layer 1: Breast cancer We apply our multi-layer inference
approach on an integrated human gene expression dataset
(ArrayExpress E-TABM-185, see Supplementary Methods) to
identify potential biomarkers or targets and their regulators for
ER (estrogen receptor)+ and ER— breast cancer subtypes.
Applying differential expression analysis is problematic with
such an integrated dataset. A per-gene permutation-based t-test
results in thousands of differentially expressed genes for ER+
breast cancer. This high number of genes is hard to validate,
whereas few genes are identiﬁed for ER— breast cancer because
of the heterogeneity among the samples in this subtype.

Layer I of our novel approach identiﬁed candidate biomarkers
for both ER+ and ER— breast cancer (Supplementary Table
S2), some of which are well-known targets for these subtypes.
Expression proﬁle of the predicted genes shows distinctive pat-
terns in the breast cancer samples (e. g. Supplementary Fig. S2).
The well-known target ESRl (estrogen receptor a) is correctly
identiﬁed as the top feature for ER+ breast cancer, whereas the
TACSTD2 (tumor-associated calcium signal transducer 2, aka
TROP2) gene is identiﬁed for both ER+ and ER— breast cancer,
which we recently discovered could be a potential target for both
ER+ and ER— breast cancer subtypes (Wu et al., 2011).

3.4.2 Layer 11: ER positive and negative breast cancers We then
reconstruct a regulatory network for ESRl in layer II and III,
incorporating human PPI and P—DNA information. The results
(see the Supplementary Text) show that our approach success-
fully identiﬁed many transcriptional regulators of ESRl.
Inspired by the positive results obtained for ESRl, we applied
this approach to identify the potential transcriptional regulators
of TROP2. We previously identiﬁed TROP2 as an important
biomarker for breast cancer (Wu et al., 2011); however, there
is no information currently available on the regulation of
TROP2. The ‘causal’ network inferred for TROP2 is shown in
Figure 4. Based on this network, we predicted CREBl is a likely
transcription factor that regulates TROP2 expression. Our
experiment (Supplementary Table S3) shows that the activation
of CREBl by F1 (Forskolin-IBMX:3-isobutyl-l-methylxanthine)
induces upregulation of TROP2 expression level in the breast
cancer cells (Wu et al., 2011), which supports our model predic-
tion that CREBl is a regulator of TROP2.

3.4.3 Layer 111: Breast cancer Although the human proteine
DNA binding information is far from completed as compared
with yeast, we obtained potential target genes of TFs for which
binding motifs are known, including TP53, JUN and REST for
ESR network and NFkBl, CREB and Evil for TROP2 network.
The protein-DNA interaction is obtained from TargetMine data-
base (Chen et al., 2011) based on both binding motif search on
the gene promoter and literature curation. Application of layer
III on these TFs identiﬁed that in the ESR network, TP53 activ-
ity changes the most, and in the TROP2 network. NFkBl activ-
ity changes more than CREBl and Evil (Supplementary Table
S4). This predicts a potential regulatory role of TP53 on ESR,
and NFkBl on TROP2, and their activity could be controlled at
the post-transcriptional level. It has been shown that TP53 tran-
scriptionally regulates ESRl expression and the regulation relies
on many protein co-factors (Shirley et al., 2009), which supports

Fig. 4. The regulatory network for TROP2. Seven transcription factors
(colored in yellow) are predicted to bind to TROP2 based on motif
search. Their interacting proteins are colored in blue. The causal
impact (score) is represented with the size of the nodes in the network.
Of the transcription factors that could regulate TROP2 only CREBl
shows a causal impact (a positive score), and it has the highest score
among all the proteins in the network that is connected to TROP2

this prediction. For TROP2, our approach predicted another
potential transcriptional regulator: NFkBl, which is likely regu-
lated at the post-transcriptional level, given that the activity of
NFkBl is primarily controlled by its cytosol-to-nucleic translo-
cation (Gilmore, 2006). Experiment in human breast cancer cell
lines (MCF10A and MDA-MB-231) shows that TROP2 gene
expression is downregulated within 2h on either the inhibition
of NFkB’s protein activity or reducing its translocation by inhi-
biting IKB kinase (IKK) (Fig. 5), which confirms a regulatory
role of NFkB on transcription of the TROP2 gene. This would
be difﬁcult to identify with current approaches, for example,
applying GSEA on the known TFs (Supplementary Table S5)
shows similar enrichment scores for almost all of the TFs, sug-
gesting its lower speciﬁcity when applied on large datasets with
diverse conditions. These results are similar to what is observed
when GSEA is applied to the yeast dataset, where many of the
enriched TFs show a zero P—Value, whereas GAL4 was not
detected (Supplementary Table S1). These results support that
our approach can identify TFs whose activity is regulated at the
post-transcriptional level.

As the completion of our study, two research articles have
been published in ONCOGENE (Guerra et al., 2013; Trerotola
et al., 2012) that provide experimental evidence in human cancer
tissues to support TROP2 as an oncogene. These independent
experimental studies confirm the effectiveness of our approach in
predicting speciﬁc genes for a phenotype and potential targets for
disease. Our discovery of the transcriptional regulators of
TROP2 complements the network biology study of TROP2 in
Guerra et al. (2013). We identiﬁed novel regulators of TROP2
that have not been discovered as yet based on previous
approaches of network reconstruction. Our discovery of NFkB
as a regulator of TROP2, together with the evidences provided in
Guerra et al. (2013) that TROP2 regulates NFkB expression,
suggests a potential positive feedback structure that supports
the ‘switching’ behavior of TROP2 expression, which was uncov-
ered in a previous analysis (Wu et al., 2011).

3.4.4 ER—/HER2— breast cancer Furthermore, our ReliefF
(layer I) analysis predicted KIF2C gene (also called mitotic cen-
tromere-associated kinesin, MCAK) as a speciﬁc biomarker for
ER—/HER2— breast cancer (Supplementary Table S2 and
Supplementary Fig. S2). Application of layers II and III suggests
that the transcription factor E2F1 regulates KIF2C expression in
ER—/HER2— breast cancer (Supplementary Table S6). E2F was
the top ranked TF for KIF2C in both layers II and III. It seems
counterintuitive that the relationship between E2Fl, a transcrip-
tion factor that controls cell proliferation (Wells et al., 2002), and
KIF2C, one of the many kinesin genes involved in cell mitosis
(V erhey et al., 2011), has been predicted to be ‘speciﬁc’ for ER—/
HER2— breast cancer. To test this hypothesis, we perform
experiments on ER+/HER2— (MCF7) and ER—/HER2—
(MDA-MB-23l) breast cancer cell lines. RNA interference was
performed to knock down E2F1 in both cell lines (Fig. 6A and
B). A signiﬁcant decrease of the KIF2C expression is observed in
MDA-MB-23l cells on E2F1 knock down, whereas the expres-
sion of KIF2C does not change in MCF7 cells (Fig. 6C). This
conﬁrms that the regulatory relationship of E2F1 on KIF2C is
speciﬁc to ER—/HER2— cells.

Indeed, higher KIF2C has been reported to be associate with
cancer (Jun et al., 2008), and especially in ER negative and triple
negative phenotypes, KIF2C has been suggested to be the best
prognostic target based on gene expression and immunohisto-
chemistry studies of patient samples (Abdel-Fatah et al., 2012).
The regulation of KIF2C gene has been studied in Jurkat cells
where E2F1 binds to and suppresses the expression of KIF2C
(Jun et al., 2008, p. 1). Nevertheless, our analysis shows that
previous understanding cannot be generalized to breast cancer
cells. In contrast to previous studies, knock down of E2F1
decreases KIF2C expression, and such regulation is speciﬁc to
ER—/HER2— cells.

It has been suggested that ER negative breast cancer cells have
an altered regulatory system that is different from ER positive
subtypes (Moggs et al., 2005; Stender et al., 2007). For example,
when estrogen or estrogen receptors are introduced, growth and
proliferation of ER+ cells are activated; however, these processes
are suppressed in ER— cells (Moggs et al., 2005). Thus, tamox-
ifen or other ER antagonist would have negative effects on the
ER— subtype (Moggs et al., 2005). Elucidating the mechanism of

the differences in regulation is important for the characterization
and treatment of ER— patients. E2F1 signaling could be an
important factor that mediates such of a difference (Stender
et al., 2007; Wang et al., 1999). The three-layer approach was
able to infer KIF2C as a speciﬁc target for ER—/HER2— breast
cancer and also predicted that KIF2C is regulated by E2F1. This
was confirmed experimentally to be speciﬁc to MDA-MB-23l
(ER+ cells) as compared with MCF7 (ER—) cells, thus providing
new evidence that connects a biomarker with a possible under-
lying mechanism in the regulation of the ER— subtype.

Overall, the application on human breast cancer shows that
our approach can be used to capture speciﬁc targets and regula-
tory relationships.

3.5 Applications on cold acclimation in plant

Next, we show an application of the three-layer inference
approach in Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) to study cold
acclimation; the process whereby plants increase their freezing
tolerance in response to low non-freezing temperatures (Ruelland
et al., 2009). One of the most well-studied cold-responsive path-
ways is the CBF pathway. This pathway comprises three genes
that encode members of the ERF/AP2 transcription factor
family, C-repeat binding factor 1 (CBFl), C-repeat binding
factor 2 (CBF2) and C-repeat binding factor 3 (CBF3Falso
known as dehydration responsive element-binding protein 1B
(DREBlB), dehydration-responsive element-binding protein 1C
(DREBlC) and dehydration-responsive element-binding protein

1A (DREBlA), respectivelyiwhich are induced within 15min
of exposing plants to low temperature (40C). The three CBF TFs
bind the CRT/DRE DNA regulatory element (rCCGAC) pre-
sent in the promoters of ~100 target genes, known as the CBF
regulon, and induce their expression leading to an increase in
freezing tolerance. The goal is to use the three-layer inference
approach to identify condition-speciﬁc genes, as well as their
potential regulators (e.g. TFs).

3.5.] Layer 1: ReliefF is applied on the Arabidopsis integrative
gene expression dataset (see Supplementary Methods) to identify
genes that are most speciﬁc to the condition of interest (e. g. cold
acclimation). Based on the ReliefF results (Supplementary Table
S7), the three CBF genes are ranked among the top seven genes
according to their ReliefF scores (CBFl, CBF2 and CBF3 were
ranked seventh, second and ﬁrst, respectively). Thus, ReliefF
retained three known cold-responsive genes as top ranked
genes based on their scores. To compare with a traditional
approach, we also performed a permutation-based t-test. This
analysis identiﬁed thousands of genes (P<0.01) with CBFl,
CBF2 and CBF3 ranked at 3072nd, 832nd and 933rd, respec-
tively, based on their P—Value. Furthermore, many of the genes
identiﬁed by t—test are related to more general processes, which
are not directly associated with the condition under investigation.
For instance, cytochrome P450, a protein located in the chlor-
oplast and involved in oxidationereduction process, was the top
ranked gene based on P—Value ranking. Similarly, Low-molecu-
lar-weight Cysteine-Rich 67 (LCR67), a protein coding gene
located in the extracellular regions and involved in physiological
defense response, gibberellic acid-mediated signaling pathway
and gibberellin biosynthetic process, HVA22B, a protein
involved in seed dormancy process, and EMl, a protein located
in the cytoplasm and involved in many biological processes (e. g.
cell division, seed dormancy process, seed germination, lipid
storage and regulation of ﬂower development. . .), were ranked
as the second, third and fourth, respectively, based on their P-
value. Therefore, ReliefF was able to identify cold-responsive
genes (e.g. CBFl, CBF2 and CBF3) as the top ranked genes as
compared with a permutation-based t-test.

3.5.2 Layer [1 In layer II, the regulatory network is recon-
structed for the top two ranked genes (CBF2 and CBF3). The
predicted regulatory network based on motif analysis contained
14 TFs as potential regulators of CBF2 and 15 TFs as potential
regulators of CBF3. The top regulators of CBF2 and CBF3
based on the difference between the conditional and uncondi-
tional mutual information are shown in Supplementary Table
S8. Circadian clock associated 1 (CCAl) and late elongated
hypocotyl (LHY), which are MYB-related transcription factors,
have been found to be involved in cold acclimation by regulating
the CBF cold pathway (e.g. CBFl, CBF2 or CBF3) (Dong et al.,
2011). Calmodulin-binding transcription activator 3 (CAMTA3)
was found to regulate CBF2 gene expression (Doherty et al.,
2009). Additionally, RAVl and ABFl have been found to be
induced in response to low temperature.

3.5.3 Layer [[1 Next, the top regulators of CBF2 and CBF3
based on the ReliefF scores are listed in Supplementary Table S9.
A reconstructed regulatory network based on the top four TFs of
CBF2 or CBF3 is shown in Supplementary Figure S4. Based on

A multi-layer inference approach

 

the predicted regulatory network, CCAl, LHY, CAMTA3 and a
member of the R2R3 factor gene family (MYB15) are the top
TFs that regulate CBF2 gene expression. Similarly, CCAl, LHY
and MYB15 are the top TFs that regulate CBF3 gene expression.
From the literature, CAMTA3 has been found to be a positive
regulator of CBF2 gene expression (Doherty et al., 2009).
Speciﬁcally, using blot analysis and RTePCR, they found that
a mutation of CAMTA3 resulted in a statistically signiﬁcant
decrease in the transcription of CBF2 between cold-condition
CAMTA3-mutated plants versus cold-conditioned wild-type
plants. Similarly, MYB15 has been shown to be involved in
the CBF pathway by negatively regulating the gene expression
of CBF2 and CBF3 (Agarwal et al., 2006). MYB15 was found to
bind to the MYB recognition sites present in the promoter
regions of CBF2 and CBF3, and overexpression of MYB15
decreased the transcription levels of CBF2 and CBF3 genes,
which reduced the plants’ freezing tolerance. On the other
hand, mutation of MYB15 induced the expression levels of
CBF2 and CBF3 and increased the plants’ freezing tolerance.
These results suggest that MYB15 plays an important role in
cold acclimation through the regulation of CBF2 and CBF3
gene expressions. Among the top seven regulators based on
layer III, there are five transcription factors known to be
involved in regulating CBF2 or CBF3 gene expression (LHY,
CCAl, CAMTA3, MYB15 and PIF4), as well as one potential
novel regulator (ATB2). Therefore, the three-layer inference
approach retrieved known regulators of CBF2 and CBF3.

4 DISCUSSIONS

4.1 Integration of multiple conditions to achieve better
speciﬁcity in network reconstruction

Identification of conditional-specific genes and ranking of the
changes in TF activity can be modeled as ‘feature selection’,
which is to select the best features (genes and TFs) that can
determine a class (phenotype/condition). Typical approaches,
i.e. t—test, ANOVA and other linear models (i.e. generalized
linear model), are used to determine differential expression
from pairwise data (Churchill, 2004; McCarthy et al., 2012;
Smyth, 2004), as shown in Figure 1C. Although some of the
applications include multi-factor (-condition) experiments, each
comparison is pairwise either between two conditions or with a
same untreated group. The problem with traditional approaches
is that they do not explicitly distinguish speciﬁc responses from
collateral and general responses (Fig. 1D); thus, it is less likely to
achieve the speciﬁcity required to identify the unique genes in
response to a given stimulation.

In contrast to traditional microarray analysis, we suggest using
an integrated reference dataset as a representation of the diver-
sity of gene expression behavior that exists to identify the speciﬁc
genes for a target condition (Fig. 1E). By comparing our condi-
tion of interest against such a wide range of ‘controls’, one can
obtain a more accurate boundary for the condition under inves-
tigation (Fig. 1E, green nodes versus red nodes). The integration
of multiple conditions increases the coverage of the problem- or
state-space to provide a better boundary, which increases the
speciﬁcity of the genes discovered by our approach. The
ReliefF algorithm that we applied is able to find important

samples close to the boundary by searching in the feature
space for the ‘nearest neighbors’ of the same/different classes
and comparing them with the given condition to achieve better
speciﬁcity. From a biological perspective, this is essentially deter-
mining better reference conditions by looking for transcriptomes
in other samples that are similar to the transcriptome for the
condition of interest, to enhance the speciﬁcity to identify
genes for the condition under investigation.

ReliefF is designed to deal with datasets that contain highly
interdependent features (Liu and Motoda, 2007; Ruiz et al.,
2003), which is another advantage of this algorithm for gene
selection. The majority of feature selection methods used in
microarray analysis assumes conditional independence of fea-
tures (genes) in different classes (conditions) and evaluates the
features separately. These include differential expression analysis
based on t—test, ANOVA and many consistency-based methods
(searching for the smallest subset of the features that is as con-
sistent as possible with the classiﬁcation) (Almuallim and
Dietterich, 1991). However, in biological networks, genes inter-
act with each other and one cannot assume that they are inde-
pendent. ReliefF is a context-sensitive method that accounts for
the distinctive state of a set of features for a speciﬁc condition.

ReliefF has been applied in genetic analysis to identify asso-
ciation between SNPs and phenotypes (Chen and Lonardi, 2009;
Moore and White, 2007). In addition to these genome-wide asso-
ciation studies, ReliefF has also been applied to small and clearly
curated microarray datasets as a pre-processing step to enhance
the accuracy of classiﬁcation, where the improvements have been
minimal Wuhang Wang and Makedon, 2004; Zhang et al.,
2008). This is because the microarray applications were based
on a traditional setting in which only two conditions (e. g.
cancer and control, a more limited search space) were compared
and did not take advantage of the full capabilities of ReliefF. In
such a two-class setting, ReliefF would not perform signiﬁcantly
better than other feature selection methods (Fig. 1B).

A limitation in the identiﬁcation of biomarkers/targets based
on gene expression changes is that there are proteins that could
be expressed at similar levels but have functional changes across
conditions. These cases are not readily discovered from gene
expression data.

4.2 Inference of regulatory relationships

Methods that use statistical inference to identify the interaction
between two genes are mostly based on the concept of
‘conditional independences’ (Markowetz and Spang, 2007), i.e.
‘is gene X independent/dependent of gene Y given genes Z’. In a
full conditional model, all genes other than X and Y are included
in Z, which is usually implemented with Gaussian graphic
models, e.g. (Schafer and Strimmer, 2005a, b) or Bayesian
network, e.g. (Imoto et al., 2002, 2003). The challenge with
such models is that they have too many parameters to be esti-
mated with limited number of microarray samples. In contrast,
approaches based on low-order conditional independence,
whereby Z is a single gene, e.g. ARACNE (Margolin et al.,
2006), are attractive because the model is less complex and
may provide clearer biological interpretation of genes X, Y
and Z.

Nevertheless, these methods have been shown to capture only
part of the relevant biological information. Indeed, a critical
analysis of the underlying assumptions of most in silico learning
approaches applied to expression data demonstrate that statisti-
cal dependencies in microarray date alone do not readily provide
direct mechanistic insights or interactions from functional geno-
mics (Wu and Chan, 2011). In our approach, the combined
layers II and III can infer the transcriptional regulation for
cases when the TF is regulated at the transcriptional level
(layer II incorporating P-DNA), as well as when the TF is
post-transcriptionally regulated (layer II incorporating PPI and
layer III). The computation of the scores in these two layers uses
different information, and the scores are independent of each
other and independent of the selection of the candidate genes
in layer I. For example, in cases when the candidate genes are
known a priori or provided by other sources, one could directly
apply layers II and III to identify the regulators. Furthermore, in
cases when the information of the candidate gene expression is
limited (e. g. newly identiﬁed ncRNAs that only appear in
RNAseq but not in microarray data), one could use its potential
or predicted TFs and apply only layer III to ﬁlter out the TFs
that are less likely to be activated for the speciﬁed condition.

4.3 Computational approaches to reconstruct
gene network

There have been numerous computational approaches developed
to reconstruct context-dependent gene network based on gene
expression proﬁles. The ﬁeld has been studied and reviewed
[e. g. (Wu and Chan, 2011)] extensively but predominantly from
the perspective of computational assumptions and methodolo-
gies. We attempt to clarify the biological problems and hypoth-
esis that can be solved or predicted by these different approaches.
In Supplementary Table S10, we summarize and compare our
approach with different computational approaches that are cur-
rently applied on gene network reconstruction. Approaches
based on Bayesian network or correlation network (e.g. in
module analysis) infer a ‘functional network’ where the connec-
tions predict statistical inﬂuences (i.e. correlation) between gene
expression, which does not necessary provide clear information
on the regulatory relationships and mechanisms. This also
includes applications based using graphic model (Segal et al.,
2003; Wang et al., 2003) in which ‘conditional clustering’ of
the co-expressed genes for a given condition implies potential
functional connections but not necessarily direct regulation
unless further interpreted with expert knowledge. ARACNe
(Margolin et al., 2006) and MINDy (Wang et al., 2009) aim to
study transcriptional regulation, which is built on the correlation
between the mRNA level of the TF and its target genes.
However, MARINA (Lefebvre et al., 2010) and NCA
(Galbraith et al., 2006; Liao et al., 2003) can account for post-
transcriptional regulation and infer TF activity by incorporating
known proteineDNA interactions. MARINA applies GSEA to
select the active TFs, where the gene sets contain the targets
genes of the TFs, whereas NCA requires many samples to
solve its complex parametric modeliwhich raises another con-
cern. Methods such as GLM and graphic models have been
applied effectively to human-scale data to identify target genes
(Li et al., 2010), but to identify TFegene relationships the

common constraints in statistics applied, for example, to illus-
trate a four-way relationship requires one to have at least four
samples [e.g. ‘the number of samples need to be at least larger
than the number of genes’ (Wang et al., 2003)]. The design of our
approach reduces the number of candidates using a layered
manner; thus, the information can be focused to address few
speciﬁc regulatory relationships at each level rather than learning
a general model for all genes and TFs. Other methods for esti-
mating TF activity usually require specific perturbation data, e. g.
time-series data (Ernst and Bar-Joseph, 2006; Shi et al., 2009) or
special experimental design of systematic perturbations on the
gene network (Ideker et al., 2000; Tegner et al., 2003).
Therefore, the primary goal of this study is to develop a frame-
work that can be widely applicable to the community in which
the current availability of expression data can be capitalized on
along with interaction data to identify TFs, including post-tran-
scriptionally regulated TFs. In our approach, the PPI and
P—DNA (TRN) information is incorporated with the gene
expression data, and the inference of the genes and their regula-
tory relationships is separated into three layers that represent
distinct biological scenarios. Based on currently known and
available information, the approach would be able to identify
the regulators (TFs) of the targets genes (selected to be most
speciﬁc to the condition) and are regulated either transcription-
ally (which other methods can do) or post-transcriptionally
(which current methods are not able to perform, without ﬁrst
providing a list of potential regulators a priori). In each of the
layers, multiple conditions are integrated to compare with the
condition of interest to infer the specific changes.

Similar to previous studies in TRN reconstruction, the limita-
tion of the approaches is primarily because of incomplete/inac-
curate information of proteineDNA interactions in higher
eukaryotic system. Similar to MARINA (or GSEA), the TF
activity estimation in layer III depends on the quality of the
putative target sets obtained from P-DNA information. Such
information is widely available in yeast for most of its TFs but
the predictions from binding motifs in human are incomplete.
This is partially why most current applications of TRN recon-
struction focus on yeast or prokaryotes (Faith et al., 2007; Segal
et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2003). In our approach, an incomplete
putative target set would not affect the prediction of the TF
activity if the given targets have been authenticated and are
representative of the entire target set. Therefore, when applying
layer III to human data, we only use information from literature-
curated databases, which essentially provides another piece of
information independent of the P-DNA predicted from motif
information in layer II. Given the same limitations (i.e. incom-
plete elucidation of the human network), the three-layer method
was able to identify regulators that are post-transcriptionally
regulated. Our approach was compared and validated with
yeast data, which existing tools were not able to recapitulate,
namely, the regulators of the GAL genes, despite the fact that
the regulation is well-known. We present examples of the appli-
cation of the approach in eukaryotic systems (human breast
cancer, plant cold acclimation), which show the generalizability
of the approach. The results obtained with the human data, at
present, have not been achieved with current approaches, and
further experimental validation was performed to conﬁrm that a
post-transcriptionally regulated TF is involved in the regulation

A multi-layer inference approach

 

of TROP2 (shown in Fig. 5), and the regulation of KIF2C by
E2F1 is specific to ER—/HER2— breast cancer cells, which is a
novel ﬁnding. Currently the approach is limited or constrained
by the availability of regulatory and binding data, however, as
more and more data are released from sequencing projects to
identify functional elements in gene regulation (e. g. the
ENCODE project: http://www.genome.gov/ 10005107, the
modENCODE project: http://www.modencode.org/), collating
and incorporating these condition-speciﬁc binding information
will beneﬁt future applications and improve the inference of gene
regulation.

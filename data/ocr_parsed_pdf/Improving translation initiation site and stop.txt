TIS and stop codon prediction using more than two classes

 

codon recognition. Thus, ﬁve different sets are created. First, we
create a set containing all sequences that contain positive in—
stances. Then, four additional sets are created containing nega—
tive sequences; these sets vary based on the position in the gene
of those negative sequences. One set was created for each of
the three following types of sequences: exons, introns and inter—
genic regions. A fourth set of negative sequences was created
using sequences from non—coding regions, that is, from introns
and intergenic regions together. As stated, the aim of this parti—
tioning of the negative set is to obtain more homogeneous nega—
tive sets.

In the second step, we must decide how to use these ﬁve sets of
instances. A straightforward approach would be to use any clas—
sifier that can handle more than two classes. However, as men—
tioned, SVMs are the best performing classiﬁers for both TIS
and stop codon prediction. Although multi—class methods have
been developed for SVMs (Hsu and Lin, 2002), two—class
approaches usually outperform those methods (Rifkin and
Klautau, 2004). Thus, we chose to train four different classiﬁers,
with each classiﬁer trained to differentiate between the positive
class and one of the four different negative classes. This approach
has the additional advantage that overwhelming evidence in the
machine learning literature indicates that a combination of dif—
ferent learners frequently outperforms methods using only one
classiﬁer (Rokach, 2009).

Additionally, we use another method in our approach. This
last method is the stop codon method. This method is chosen
because it only uses positive sequences; thus, it is not affected by
the problem of mixing in the different instances of the negative
classes. The stop codon method (Saeys et al., 2007) looks at
either the stop codon frequencies downstream of the TIS for
TIS recognition or the stop codon frequencies upstream of the
actual stop codon for stop codon recognition.

After these two steps, we have ﬁve trained classiﬁers that must
be combined to obtain a single value that tells us whether a
certain sequence is a true site. To classify a new sequence, we
obtain the output of each classiﬁer and use those ﬁve outputs to
predict the class of the sequence. There are many ways of com—
bining the outputs of different classiﬁers (Kuncheva, 2002), some
with high complexity. However, in most cases, simple methods
are not beaten by the most complex ones, and these simple
methods are faster and less prone to over—ﬁtting. The most
common of these simple methods include the sum of the outputs,
majority voting and the maximum output.

Given the outputs of the ﬁve classiﬁers, c1, . . . ,c5, and a thresh—
old for each one of these classiﬁers, t1, . . . ,t5, the ﬁnal answer of
the classiﬁer, C(x), for a given sequence x, is deﬁned as follows.
For the sum of outputs, the ﬁnal answer is given by the following
equation:

C(x) =  c,~(x) — ti. (1)

The threshold term, ti, corrects for the different ranges of the
classiﬁers. The majority voting approach is given by the follow—
ing equation:

C = 1. 2
0‘) arg Klara” Z 0

Ana-(x) = .v

Finally, the maximum is given by the following equation:

C(x) =c,~(x) : i=arg max Ic/(x) — til. (3)

Once C(x) is obtained by any of these methods, a general
threshold T should be ﬁxed to decide whether a certain sequence
is an actual site. One of the problems we have when choosing the
combination method is model selection, as we do not know a
priori whether any of the three methods would be consistently
better than the other two for all the chromosomes and all the
three evaluation measures we used as performance measures.
Thus, the best combination was chosen for each case using
cross—validation. This cross—validation method is explained in
the next section.

As a final remark, we should note that our approach is also
general enough to be used with any other classiﬁer. Because this
approach is based on modifying the number of classiﬁers and the
training sets, it can be used with any other classiﬁcation method.
Furthermore, this method can also be applied if a classiﬁer uses
other types of data besides the raw sequence if the information
used by the classiﬁer is extracted using the datasets described
above.

3 METHODS AND DATA

To evaluate our approach, we chose ﬁve different human chromosomes,
namely chromosomes 1, 3, 13, 19 and 21 for testing purposes, and
chromosome 16 for model selection. For each chromosome, we trained
the classiﬁers with all the remaining chromosomes except 16, then we
chose the best combination method using chromosome 16 and tested
the chosen model with all the true TIS or stop codons and the negative
samples of the given chromosome. That is, for chromosome 1, we trained
the models with chromosomes 2 to 22 and X and Y except 16. Then, we
chose the best combination method using chromosome 16 and tested this
model using chromosome 1. A summary of these datasets is shown in
Table l. The chromosomes were selected with the aim of choosing
chromosomes of different lengths and codiﬁcation density.
Chromosome 16 was chosen as validation set, as it is a chromosome of
average length and coding density. For SVMWD, as no model selection is
needed, chromosome 16 was added to the training set. We used all TISs
and stop codons of the Consensus CDS (CCDS) update released for
human of September 7, 2011. This update uses Human National
Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) build 37.3 and includes
26 473 CCDS IDs that correspond to 18471 GeneIDs.

One of the key aspects of the evaluation of any new proposal is the set
of previous methods used in the comparison. Many different methods
have been proposed for recognizing TISs and stop codons (Saeys et al.,
2007; Wang et al., 2003; Zeng et al., 2002, Zien et al., 2000). However,
these previous works and our own research (Garcia-Pedrajas et al., 2012)
have shown that an SVM with a string kernel is the best state-of-the-art
method not only for TISs and stop codons but also for splice sites
(Sonnenburg et al., 2007). To assure the general advantage of SVMs
with string kernels, we performed a preliminary study of the different
available methods that included position weight matrices, decision
trees, k-nearest neighbors, stop codon method (Saeys et al., 2007),
Wang et al.’s method (Wang et al., 2003), Salzberg’s method (Salzberg,
1997) and SVMs with linear and Gaussian kernels and three different
string kernels: the locality improved kernel, the weighted degree kernel
(WD) and the weighted degree kernel with shifts (Ratsch et al., 2005)
(WDS). SVMs with WD kernel obtained consistently the best results
and thus was chosen as the method to be compared with our proposal.
WDS obtained marginally better results than WD but with a far higher

Random undersampling was used for training; thus, the number of negative in—
stances was equal to the number of positive instances.

computational complexity. We will refer throughout the article to the
SVM with WD kernels as SVMWD. The same WD kernel was used
for the classiﬁers in our proposal. However, we must bear in mind that
our method, as it works on the design of the datasets, can be used with
any other classiﬁcation method.

Another key parameter of the learning process is the window around
the functional site that is used to train the classiﬁers. A further advantage
of our approach is that it allows the use of a suitable window for each
type of sequence. The value of the window for each classiﬁer was ob-
tained by cross-validation. We, considering the site as offset 0, and did
not count the TIS or the stop codon, and we tested the performance of
the following windows: [7100, 0], [775, 25], [750, 0], [750, 50], [725, 0],
[725, 25], [725, 75], [710, 15], [710, 40], [710, 90], [0, 25], [0, 50] and [0, 100].
For each trained classiﬁer, the best window was chosen. Table 2 shows
the window obtained by cross-validation for all the classiﬁers. For the
stop codon method, we used the additional window values of [0, 200], [0,
300], [0, 400] and [0, 500] for TIS recognition and the window values of
[7200, 0], [7300, 0], [7400, 0] and [7500, 0] for stop codon recognition.

Table 2 shows interesting results. First, the window for TIS recognition
depended on the classiﬁer and the chromosome. However, the window
for stop codon prediction was the same for all cases with only one ex-
ception. Second, this table also shows that the different classiﬁers used for
TIS recognition had different values; this finding supports our previous
claim that using different classiﬁers has the advantage of allowing better
ﬁne-tuning of the learning parameters.

Furthermore, SVMs are sensitive to the learning parameters; thus, we
also performed a cross-validation to obtain their values. The WD kernel
has two parameters: the standard C parameter of any SVM and the
window width of the string kernel. We tested values of l, 10, 100 and
1000 for C and 12 and 24 for the window width. All eight combinations
were evaluated using lO-fold cross-validation, and the best one was
chosen. Although it may be argued that this method might result in
suboptimal parameters, this method is a good compromise between the
performance of the SVM and the high computational cost of evaluating
each set of parameters. This same procedure was used for both SVMWD
and our approach.

For training the models, we used random undersampling (Hulse et al.,
2010) because previous studies have shown its usefulness for TIS recog-
nition (Garcia-Pedrajas et al., 2012). For random undersampling, we used
a ratio of l, which means that the majority class was randomly under-
sampled until both classes had the same number of instances.

To evaluate the obtained classiﬁers, we used the standard measures for
imbalanced data. Given the number of true-positive results (TP), false-

positive results (FP), true-negative results (TN) and false-negative results
(FN), we used the sensitivity, Sn = %, and the speciﬁcity,
Sp: %. The geometric mean of these two measures,
G — mean = W, will be our ﬁrst classiﬁcation metric. As a second
measure, we used the area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve (auROC). However, auROC is independent of class ratios and it
can be less meaningful when we have unbalanced datasets (Sonnenburg
et al., 2007). In such cases, area under the precision recall curve (auPRC)
can be used. This measure is specially relevant if we are mainly interested
in the positive class. However, it can be sensible for subsampling. In our
results, we use all the positive and negative instances for each one of the
ﬁve chromosomes tested, so no subsampling is used. This also yields to
small auPRC values.

We use these three metrics because they provide two different views of
the performance of the classiﬁers. The auROC and auPRC values de-
scribe the general behavior of the classiﬁer. However, when used in prac-
tice, we must establish a threshold for the classiﬁcation of a query
pattern. G-mean provides the required snapshot of the performance of
the classiﬁer when we set the needed threshold.

4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The first step of our experiments was devoted to studying the
usefulness of the ﬁve different classiﬁers that we considered.
As stated, we have ﬁve classiﬁers that are trained with the
same positive class, and a negative class consisting on negative
instances from exons, introns, intergenic regions and non—coding
regions. We had a ﬁfth classiﬁer using only positive instances.
Thus, we tested the performance, as measured by the auROC, of
the combined approach with all ﬁve classiﬁers and then removed
one classiﬁer at a time. A negative value means that the classiﬁer
had a negative effect on the performance of the model and thus
should not be used.

The results showed that the worst performing classiﬁer was the
one trained using negative instances extracted from exons. For
this classiﬁer, the positive and negative instances were the most
similar; thus, the training algorithm had more difﬁculties in dif—
ferentiating between the positive and negative instances. In fact,
the overall effect of this classiﬁer was harmful to the performance
of the method. Thus, this classiﬁer was removed and was not
considered in the subsequent experiments.

and auPRC for all ﬁve studied chromosomes. These results dem—
onstrate that the overall performance of the proposed method
was better than the performance of SVMWD. The actual ROC
and PRC curves shown in Figures 276 show that the curves cor—
responding to our proposal are always above than the curves of
SVMWD. This result indicates the better performance for all the
possible thresholds of classiﬁcation.

It is interesting to study how the proposed method achieved
its good performance. For both methods, Table 4 shows the
distribution of the FP according to the part of the gene to
which the TIS sequences belong. The behavior is clear.

Separating the negatives samples into four classes improves the
discrimination between positive instances and negative instances
from introns and intergenic regions. However, the number of FF
for instances from exons increases but to a lesser extent than the
decrease in the number of FF from introns and intergenic re—
gions. Furthermore, the FP from exons may be reduced using
other sources of information, such as content measures.

The second part of our experiments was devoted to stop codon
recognition. Stop codon recognition is a more difﬁcult task because
the achieved accuracy is less than that for TIS recognition. One of the
major sources of this increased complexity is the number of negative
instances. There are three different stop codons rather than just one
as it is the case for TIS recognition; therefore, the number of negative
instances is three times the number of negative instances for TIS
prediction. For instance, using the same ﬁve chromosomes from
the previous experiments, the best current method found >11.5 mil—
lion false—positive stop codons. This amount of incorrectly predicted
stop codons might be able to mar any annotation system, indicating
that there is ample room for improvement.

Our approach for stop codon prediction used the same classi—
fiers as for TIS recognition. Table 5 shows a summary of results
for stop codon recognition. The ﬁrst remarkable result is the
large improvement in the number of both FN and FF. The
FN were reduced by 26.8% in the worst case and by 57.9% in
the best case. This result indicates that the number of total FN
was reduced from 823 with SVMWD to 443 with our method. As
for TIS recognition, an annotation program may not be able to
recognize a gene when the stop codon is missing. Furthermore,
this improvement was achieved along with a signiﬁcant improve—
ment in the FP. The FP improvement was also large with a best
result of 46.9%. As a whole, 2.7 million FP from SVMWD were
accurately classiﬁed as negatives by our method. This quantity of
FF may overwhelm any annotation system; thus, the improve—
ment should have a signiﬁcant impact on automatic annotation.

Figure 7 shows the absolute improvement of our method in the
speciﬁcity, sensitivity, G—mean, auROC and auPRC. The im—
provement for auROC is particularly relevant. The proposed ap—
proach improved the auROC by 3.7% in the worst case and 7.2%
in the best case. Figures 8712 show the ROC/PRC curves for the
five chromosomes. As for TIS recognition, the ROC/PRC curves
of our approach not only achieved a better auROC and auPRC
but were also always above the curves of SVMWD.

recognition, the improvement was remarkable; the G—mean im—
proved by 8%, and the auROC increased from 0.8189 to 0.9372.
For stop codon classiﬁcation, the improvement was even better.
The standard approach had an auROC of 0.6853, whereas our
approach achieved an auROC of 0.9260. As it was the case for
the previous experiments, auPRC was low for all experiments
because of the huge number of negative instances.

5 CONCLUSION

In this article, we presented a new approach for TIS and stop
codon recognition. This approach uses more than one classiﬁer,
divides the negative class into four different groups and trains
one classiﬁer for each type of negative class. This approach was
applied to the recognition of TIS and stop codons in five human
chromosomes. The approach was compared with the best current
method for TIS and stop codon prediction. The proposed ap—
proach also has the advantage of its simplicity, which makes
it easily applicable to any program for TIS or stop codon
recognition.

The reported results show that the proposed method shows
improved sensitivity, specificity, auROC and auPRC compared

with SVMWD. The results show a remarkable improvement in
the ratio of FN and FF achieved over those of SVMWD.
Because state—of—the—art annotation systems rely heavily on the
accurate prediction of the functional sites of the gene, the pro—
posed method is an effective way of improving current gene
recognizers.

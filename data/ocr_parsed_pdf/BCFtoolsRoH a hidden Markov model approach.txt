Abstract

Summary: Runs 0f homozygosity (RoHs) are genomic stretches of a diploid genome that show
identical alleles on both chromosomes. Longer RoHs are unlikely to have arisen by chance but are
likely to denote autozygosity, whereby both copies of the genome descend from the same recent
ancestor. Early tools to detect RoH used genotype array data, but substantially more information is
available from sequencing data. Here, we present and evaluate BCFtools/ROH, an extension to the
BCFtools software package, that detects regions of autozygosity in sequencing data, in particular
exome data, using a hidden Markov model. By applying it to simulated data and real data from the
1000 Genomes Project we estimate its accuracy and show that it has higher sensitivity and specifi—
city than existing methods under a range of sequencing error rates and levels of autozygosity.

1 Introduction

The prevalence of runs of homozygosity (RoHs) varies worldwide
depending on past demography and recent mating patterns.
Targeted studies in families from populations with high consanguin-
ity have been successful in identifying genes underlying simple auto-
somal recessive disorders using autozygosity mapping. While several
methods exist to detect these RoH (Browning and Browning, 2010;
Gusev et (11., 2009; Purcell et (11., 2007) they were primarily designed
for genotyping data and do not exploit all the information available
from population sequencing, which includes fuller information
about allele frequencies and recombination rates; moreover, they
were not designed to be computationally efficient to accommodate
the higher complexity of sequence data. More recently, Magi et al.
(2014) introduce a new method H3M2 developed for sequence data

but which requires BAM files, which are not always available. We
present a software package, BCFtools/RoH, to allow geneticists car-
rying out genome-wide sequencing studies to infer autozygous sec-
tions from sequence-derived variation data in a more accurate and
more efficient way.

2 Methods

2.1 Identifying autozygous sections of diploid

genomes using a hidden Markov model

BCFtools/RoH uses a hidden Markov model (HMM) to identify
ROHs. The HMM is applied to genetic variation data (in VCF for-
mat) for the population containing the sample, with positions in the
chain corresponding to segregating sites in the population, and using

3.3 Application of the method to real data from

the 1000 Genomes Project

We applied our method to 2504 individuals from Phase 3 of the
1000 Genomes Project, both running on the full genome VCFs and
on the exomes. The fraction of the genome found to be autozygous
varies by individual and population (Supplementary Fig. S4). The
exome results provide estimates that are within 5% of the whole
genome estimate (Supplementary Fig. 55). Our estimates are also
close to independent estimates of the total percentage of autozygos—
ity measured by the inbreeding coefficient, in 31 individuals for
which it was at least 1% (Fig. 1B).

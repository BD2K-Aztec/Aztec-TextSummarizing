Abstract

Summary: CellMaps is an HTML5 open—source web tool that allows displaying, editing, exploring
and analyzing biological networks as well as integrating metadata into them. Computations and
analyses are remotely executed in high—end servers, and all the functionalities are available
through RESTful web services. CellMaps can easily be integrated in any web page by using an
available JavaScript API.

Availability and Implementation: The application is available at: http://cellmaps.babelomics.org/
and the code can be found in: https://github.com/opencb/cell—maps. The client is implemented in

 

JavaScript and the server in C and Java.

1 Introduction

Networks are becoming increasingly important to understand the re—
lationships between genotype and phenotype, specifically in the con—
text of disease. Consequently, the demand for efficient network
visualization and analysis tools, which can interoperate with mod—
ern data analysis environments, such as the web, is increasing in par—
allel. Most of the available web—based network analysis portals
often offer limited functionality, typically restricted to network visu—
alization and, in some cases, simple analysis options, such as
GeneMania (Warde—Farley et (11., 2010) or STRING (Franceschini
et (11., 2013). Other web tools are available, but based on Java, such
as OndeX Web (Taubert et (11., 2014) or Visant (Hu et (11., 2013).
Very recently, a JavaScript library with Cytoscape functionalities
has been made available (Franz et (11., 2015).

Here, we present CellMaps, an open—source HTML5 web—based
application that brings advanced visualization and network analysis
to end—users. Additionally, a JavaScript API was developed to facili—
tate the integration of CellMaps in any web page. CellMaps offers the
interactivity and the graphical advanced features typical for desktop
applications and the performance of client—server applications.

2 Implementation

CellMaps server code is written in Java and C. RESTful web services
and database queries have been implemented in Java. CellMaps cli—
ent has been implemented in JavaScript using the HTML5 and SVG
standards, providing a rich and user—friendly interface built with
Polymer web components (https://www.polymer—pr0ject.0rg/1.0/).

A JavaScript API facilitates an easy integration of the CellMaps cli—
ent by using plain HTML tags. Computations and analyses are exe—
cuted in remote high—end servers and all the functionalities are
available through RESTful web services. Data and session results
can be stored and recovered locally or in remote servers (for regis—
tered users), where computation is performed. Relevant biological
network information, including IntAct interactions, is available
through CellBase (Bleda et al., 2012b) web services (http://bioinfo.
hpc.cam.ac.uk/cellbasdwebservices/rest). KEGG and Reactome
pathways are directly taken from their respective web services.
CellMaps runs in the latest versions of ‘evergreen’ web browsers
(Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Edge) and has no browser plugins or
other libraries requirement.

3 Features

3.1 Data input/output

Networks can be imported from local files in SIF, XLSX or text for—
mats and exported in SVG or SIF formats Pre—defined networks can
also be imported from Reactome, KEGG or IntAct using CellBase
(Bleda et al., 2012b) web services. Attribute files containing meta—
data information about nodes and edges (e.g. gene expression, GO
terms, etc.) can also be imported as simple tab—delimited matrices.
Sessions are maintained in the server for registered users but can
also be saved in JSON format. See Additional Information for
detail.

3.2 Network editing and management

Once the network and attribute data are loaded, options for adding
and deleting nodes as well as defining the number and type of rela—
tionships (edges) among them are available. Based on edge and node
adjacency the user can perform different convenient ways of node
and edge selection options, in a convenient way. To facilitate the
visualization of the network CellMaps provides different layouts,
among others taken from Cytoscape.js (Franz et al., 2015), several
shapes, colors, sizes and transparency settings for nodes and edges
as well as the upload of background images.

Node and edge attributes can be visualized using simple visual
properties as color, size, etc. and more sophisticated features as
donut and pie charts (see an example in Fig. 1). They can be im—
ported from files or from CellBase, which provides information for
a total of 76 species. Of remarkable interest is gene—specific informa—
tion on diseases (from ClinVar and UNIPROT), drugs (http://dgidb.
org), Gene Ontology and tissue—specific gene expression (http://
www.proteinatlas.org).

3.3 Network analysis
Different options for network analysis and interpretation are avail—
able (described in more detail in the Supplementary information):

' Find interactions: locates a list of proteins within the interactome
and returns the subnetvvork that connects them, along with their
ﬁrst degree interactors.

' Community Structure Deﬁnition: ﬁnds the organization sub—
structure of the network using different popular algorithms
(FastGreedy Walktrap or Infomap) implemented in the igraph
(Csardi and Nepusz, 2006) R package.

' Topological Study: allows calculating basic network topological
parameters such as the connection degree, the betweenness cen—
trality and the clustering coefﬁcient.

ICGC cancer genomes through mutations in their interacting interfaces
(Porta-Pardo er al., 2015), completed with known drivers. The bottom left of
the figure shows an example of nodes with donut charts in a magnification of
the square in the network. Donut charts allows the simultaneous representa-
tion of several features in the nodes (connected by the gray lines)

' Network Enrichment: ﬁnds all the existing connections between
pairs of proteins in a list and then, it applies a test to check if the
level of connectivity of the network inferred is signiﬁcantly
higher than it can be expected by chance (Minguez et al., 2009),
a testing strategy also adopted by other resources, such as
STRING (Franceschini et al., 2013).

' Gene Set Network Enrichment: applies the gene set version of
the previous test, by looking for signiﬁcant subnetworks in a
ranked or prioritized list of genes or proteins (Garcia—Alonso
et al., 2012).

' Single Enrichment: carries out a conventional Gene Ontology en—
richment test (Al—Shahrour et al., 2004) of the network.

3.4 Example applications

As an example, CellMaps is embedded in RENATO (Bleda et al.,
2012a) providing an interactive graphical interface for the represen—
tation of regulatory networks (http://renato.bioinfo.cipf.es).
Another example is Babelomics (Alonso et al., 2015 ) (http://www.
babelomics.org), which implements it in several options. It is also
used in two pathway analysis programs, PathiWays (Sebastian—Leon
et al., 2013) and PathiPred (Amadoz et al., 2015) (http://pathiways.
babelomics.org/).

3.5 Future directions

In addition to KEGG and Reactome, we are planning to integrate
other web services such as Pathway Commons (http://www.pathway
commons.org/) or the recently released Ndex (Pratt et al., 2015). We
are also planning to include more options, from Cytoscape.js and
other useful graphic libraries.

4 Discussion

Despite the functionalities of desktop applications are increasingly
being ported to the web, there are no efficient, user—friendly web—
based solutions for the representation and analysis of biological
networks available yet. CellMaps is an open—source web—based ap—
plication oriented to end—users for advanced interactive visualization
and network analysis that offers the performance of a web—based cli—
ent/server application.
